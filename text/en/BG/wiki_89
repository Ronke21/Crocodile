<text>Uwe H. Schmidt (born 27 August 1968), also known as Atom™, Atom Heart, or Señor Coconut, is a German composer, musician and producer of electronic music. He was active in the development of electrolatino, electrogospel, and aciton music. In the nineties, Schmidt moved to Chile and developed part of his career there, adopting the alias Señor Coconut.

==Biography==
===1983–1990===
Uwe Schmidt was born in Frankfurt. He began making music in the early 1980s, first playing drums, then switching to programming a drum computer after he had heard a Linn Drum on the radio. In 1986, he co-founded the cassette label N.G. Medien, on which various tapes of international artists, including the Canadian electronic body music act Front Line Assembly and his first musical work under the name Lassigue Bendthaus, entitled &quot;The Engineer&#x27;s Love&quot;, were released.

Soon after, he started to work on what would become his first official Lassigue Bendthaus record release, the album &quot;Matter&quot;. The recordings and production for &quot;Matter&quot; began in 1986 and took almost four years, until the album finally came out in 1991 on the German Parade Amoureuse label. &quot;Matter&quot; as well as its related singles and maxi-singles were recorded and mixed by Tobias Freund (Pink Elln). That same year, he released his debut dancefloor track, &#x27;Whitehouse&#x27;. More releases followed on labels like Cyclotron, Rising High, and Pod Communications, for which (as Atom Heart) he co-created with Ata and Heiko the 12&quot; vinyl &quot;Mihon&quot;.

Lassigue Bendthaus, until that point, was musically categorized as EBM, even though part of the success of &quot;Matter&quot; may have been the fact that it did not quite fit the category and already incorporated musical elements of the 1990s. Uwe Schmidt played his first live show as Lassigue Bendthaus as the opening act for the British group Meat Beat Manifesto at the Frankfurt Batschkapp in 1989.

===1991–1994===
Still living in Frankfurt, Uwe Schmidt was directly influenced by the emerging &quot;pre-techno&quot; movement of the late 1980s known as house and acid house. A sub-label of Parade Amoureuse released some of Schmidt&#x27;s dance floor oriented productions under the alias Atom Heart which he adopted as his main artist name from then on. The early 1990s saw a series of 12-inch vinyl productions, mainly aimed at the dance floor, which were released under a variety of different project titles such as Atom Heart, Slot, etc.

In 1992, he was in charge of producing a series of tracks for the yet to be widely known DJs Pascal F.E.O.S. (Resistance D), Ata and Heiko M/S/O (Ongaku). Uwe Schmidt produced and co-wrote titles such as &quot;Ongaku&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Love&quot;, which became successful prototypes for the appearing trance movement. His activities as a music producer continued with the Austrian multimedia artists Station Rose whom had just moved from Vienna to Frankfurt in 1992. The 12-inch &quot;Digit Eyes&quot; was produced by Schmidt and Station Rose the same year. During the production of &quot;Digit Eyes&quot; he was introduced to Tetsu Inoue, a New York-based Japanese electronic music producer, with whom he founded the Datacide project in 1993.

Out of the N.G. Medien nucleus the record label POD Communication was founded in 1992. After the bankruptcy of Parade Amoureuse and its sub-labels in 1992, Schmidt moved his activities to POD Communication on which he released a series of 12-inches and albums under the guises of Atom Heart, Lisa Carbon and Atomu Shinzo. Also releasing on POD Communication was the German artist Pete Namlook whom Uwe Schmidt first met at the POD office in Frankfurt. Due to his releases on Parade Amoureuse and POD Communication and his successful production works, Schmidt had quickly obtained a reputation that let him play live concerts all around the world. Together with Tobias Freund, who by then used the Pink Elln pseudonym, Schmidt played a live show at one of the first rave parties ever in Finland in 1992. The live concert was recorded and released on Ongaku Music in 1992, known as &quot;Elektronikkaa – Atom Heart &amp; Pink Elln live in Montreux and Helsinki&quot;.

A vast amount of productions were released worldwide due to the licensing activities of POD Communication, Ongaku Music and a variety of other Frankfurt-based record companies. After Parade Amoureuse closed down in 1992, his first album &quot;Matter&quot; was re-released by the Italian record label Contempo Records from Florence.

In 1993, Schmidt released the follow-up album to &quot;Matter&quot;: Lassigue Bendthaus&#x27; &quot;Cloned&quot;. &quot;Cloned&quot; was produced and licensed to Contempo Records together with a sample CD titled &quot;Cloned:Binary&quot; which contained the sounds used on the original album. Contempo Records went bankrupt in 1993.

Due to open payments by those labels, lack of a recording studio and unresolved recording contracts, Schmidt decided to take some months off and lived for half a year in Costa Rica (end of 1992 until early 1993). On the way back from Costa Rica, he stopped over in New York City, where he visited Tetsu Inoue to record the first Datacide album. Back home in Frankfurt, his interest in Latin Music started to grow and in fact the birth of the Señor Coconut moniker can be located somewhere around that time. Even though Lassigue Bendthaus had not brought him much luck until then, he decided to start recording his third album during 1993 entitled &quot;Render&quot;. Because of the stagnation and inherent ignorance of the techno movement that surrounded Schmidt&#x27;s work, he soon began to distance from this musical format and scene. He also felt that the DJ and the dance floor were limiting targets for his musical output and that many of his musical ideas would not be compatible with it. As a consequence he founded his own record label Rather Interesting in 1994.

By this time, Pete Namlook had founded his FAX +49-69/450464 label and a new scene of musical styles appeared, such as ambient, jungle, IDM and others. Schmidt collaborated with Namlook under the names Millenium (for Pod) and as Subsequence (for FAX).

Uwe Schmidt, apart from his monthly release on Rather Interesting, continued recording with Tetsu Inoue (Datacide), Pete Namlook (Jet Chamber) and Victor Sol (+N) during 1994. That same year, the Lassigue Bendthaus albums &quot;Render&quot;, &quot;Render Audible (U.S. Remixes)&quot;, &quot;Matter&quot; (second re-release), &quot;Cloned&quot; (first re-release) and the 12-inch &quot;Overflow&quot; were released by the Belgian KK Records, a label that would officially declare bankruptcy in 2000. Right after the release and re-release of the Lassigue Bendthaus albums, Schmidt began to work on the last album to be released under that project name called &quot;Pop Artificielle&quot;.

===1995–1998===
In 1995, Uwe Schmidt collaborated with Bill Laswell and Tetsu Inoue on the Fax release &quot;Second Nature&quot;, which was recorded at Laswell&#x27;s studio in Brooklyn. Toward the end of 1995, another collaboration was concretized in Tokyo where Schmidt, Inoue, and Yellow Magic Orchestra founder Haruomi Hosono recorded the first &quot;HAT&quot; album, which was released on Schmidt&#x27;s Rather Interesting label and Haruomi Hosono&#x27;s Daisy World Discs. In an effort to escape the German winter, Schmidt spent the ends of 1994 and 1995 in Australia. A man with the same idea was the German music producer Bernd Friedmann, whom he met in Melbourne in 1995.

Two more +N and Datacide albums were produced between 1993 and 1996 as well as one album each month on Rather Interesting, all of them under different names that Schmidt later refers to as working titles, headlines, or simply &quot;words that label a musical idea&quot; rather than being aliases or projects in the traditional sense. Logically all works of Uwe Schmidt would later be summarized under just one name: Atom™. With a lot of traveling, playing live shows worldwide, such as the Love Parade in 1994 and Sonar Barcelona in 1994, as well as the stagnation to be felt in his European surroundings, Schmidt prepared for his departure from the old continent. Together with Dandy Jack, with whom he formed the project Gon, two live shows were played in Santiago de Chile in March and October 1996. Schmidt and the Chilean Dandy Jack, who lived all his life in Germany and Spain, on their way back from Chile, decided to try to relocate to Santiago in 1997.

1996 finally saw Schmidt&#x27;s Señor Coconut idea come to realization. After a couple of unsuccessful attempts during 1993–1995, still living in Frankfurt, he recorded eight tracks in the later declared electrolatino style. In a fever dream, the name Señor Coconut, placed on top of a coconut texture, a design that would become the artwork of the first Señor Coconut album, appeared to him. Even though Schmidt tried to complete the album in Frankfurt, the preparations for his move to Chile prevented this. In March 1997, Schmidt, together with his colleague Dandy Jack, moved to Santiago de Chile, where they shared a rented house and installed their studios. During March and April, he finished the &quot;El Gran Baile&quot; album, which would be the first work bearing the name of Señor Coconut.

Uwe Schmidt continued releasing one album per month on his Rather Interesting label, although due to the difficulties of adaptation in Chile, decided to reduce his output. Akashic Records, a Tokyo-based label owned by Tōwa Tei, licensed &quot;El Gran Baile&quot; for the territory of Japan. Tōwa Tei further requested a remix by Uwe Schmidt. By the end of 1997 Uwe Schmidt and Dandy Jack&#x27;s ways split and Uwe moved out of the shared house (while Dandy Jack moved back to Germany one year later).

During 1998, Tetsu Inoue and Haruomi Hosono visited Uwe in Santiago. The second HAT album was recorded. Toward the end of 1998, on his way back from Australia to Germany, Bernd Friedmann stopped over in Santiago and together with Uwe Schmidt they recorded their first Flanger album called &quot;Templates&quot;, which was recorded in a programming tour de force of one week at Uwe&#x27;s Mira, Musica! studio and released in 1999 on the British Ninja Tune label.

===1999–2003===
Lassigue Bendthaus&#x27; last album, &quot;Pop Artificielle&quot;, was finally finished and released in 1999. Due to a record company decision the album was released under the name of LB. &quot;Pop Artificielle&quot; caused quite a media reaction worldwide, due to the fact that the album contained electronic cover versions of famous pop and rock songs. &quot;Pop Artificielle&quot; stylistically may be considered as being one of the first productions that merged song structures with sounds coming from a &#x27;90s techno background. Many refer to it as an initial point for the development of the glitch genre.

During the production process of &quot;Pop Artificielle&quot;, the idea was born to cover the German electronic pioneers Kraftwerk in a yet-to-be-defined style and as a different production. Meant to be rough sketches, Uwe Schmidt started to program a couple of Kraftwerk cover versions in traditional cha-cha-cha arrangement and decided to make this the second Señor Coconut album. Entertained by the result of the first programmings, he produced a total of 4 songs which he sent to some record companies. One of those companies, Tōwa Tei&#x27;s Akashic Records, immediately licensed the album, entitled &quot;El Baile Alemán&quot;, releasing it upon completion of the production in 2000. Uwe Schmidt obtained official permission by Kraftwerk themselves to release &quot;El Baile Alemán&quot;, though had to remove his version of &quot;Radioactivity&quot;. European and North American record companies remained uninterested until triggered by the hype &quot;El Baile Alemán&quot; had caused in Japan. Soon a European, North American, Mexican, Hong Kong and a Russian release followed and the title &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot; was featured in the Mexican movie &quot;Y Tu Mamá También&quot;.

Señor Coconut&#x27;s first European tour started on 19 August 2000 in Germany. A US headlining tour was scheduled, but had to be canceled because of visa problems of one of the 7 Chilean musicians that accompanied Schmidt. In parallel to Señor Coconut project, Schmidt continued working on rather obscure ideas, some for Rather Interesting, some that were released on other labels, such as the Geeez &#x27;n&#x27; Gosh (2000 and 2002) albums which musically merge abstract electronic programmings and gospel vocals. Geeez &#x27;n&#x27; Gosh was released on the German Mille Plateaux label, which went bankrupt in 2004, leaving Schmidt as well as many fellow musicians, unpaid. The Flanger project was also continued, Friedman and Schmidt recording the &quot;Inner Space/Outer Space&quot; album in Santiago de Chile, which was then released in 2001.

===2004–2008===
Apart from his own productions and various collaborations he was solicited to remix artists such as Depeche Mode, Martin L. Gore, Air, Cesária Évora, Juan García Esquivel, Sketch Show, Tōwa Tei, Moreno Veloso, Merzbow and many others. An exclusive track entitled &quot;White Car&quot; was produced for and released on the Japanese anime movie, &quot;Appleseed&quot;. Still, Uwe Schmidt spent most of the time touring with his Señor Coconut moniker, which had grown to a full 9-man orchestra. The Señor Coconut album &quot;Yellow Fever!&quot; was released in 2006. The album contained cover versions of Yellow Magic Orchestra songs and became a very successful release in Japan. Amongst the YMO members themselves (Haruomi Hosono, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Yukihiro Takahashi) a large number of musicians appeared on this album such as Mouse on Mars, Akufen, Jorge González and others. &quot;Yellow Fever!&quot; was performed live at Sónar Sound Tokyo the same year, with both Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi performing each one song with the full orchestra on stage. The Señor Coconut album &quot;Around the World&quot; was released. It contains guest participations of Stephan Remmler (Trio) and the Austrian crooner Louie Austen.

===2009–present===
Uwe Schmidt&#x27;s Rather Interesting label remains his largest unified body of work. To date, R.I. alone has over 46 full-length releases under numerous aliases and styles, of which most of them are written, recorded, mixed and mastered by Schmidt himself. Additionally, Schmidt handles all the label management and most all of the album artwork and design.

Remixes for Les, Pérez Prado, Jamie Lidell, Plaid and Japanese superstar Kumi Koda have been continuing to garner attention for Uwe Schmidt. The collaboration Surtek Collective with Vicente Sanfuentes, invented yet another musical style called aciton, a blend of acid and reggaeton. Surtek Collective mainly tours Latin America, playing shows in Mexico, Venezuela, Brasil, Argentina and Chile.

The Flanger album &quot;Spirituals&quot; was released in 2005 on Bernd Friedmann&#x27;s label Nonplace and the HEADZ label for the Japanese territory. A couple of years later songs from &quot;Spirituals&quot; got licensed for the Hungarian movie &quot;Bibliotheque Pascal&quot;.

From 2007 until 2010, collaborating with Japanese composer Masaki Sakamoto, he produces the album &quot;Alien Symphony&quot; and the modified (online) version of it, called &quot;Meteor Shower&quot; which was released in 2010. The same year sees Atom™ acting a mini-role in the Mexican movie &quot;Orol&quot;. By the end of 2010 a short South American tour is played with the Sr. Coconut project.

Atom™, in collaboration with Japanese musician Toshiyuki Yasuda produces a cover version of the Brazilian Bossa Nova classic &quot;Aguas de Março&quot;, pre-released on the compilation &quot;Red Hot 2&quot; in June 2011. The vocals on this song are performed by Fernanda Takai and Moreno Veloso.

A photo exhibition called &quot;Winterreise&quot; was unveiled in Tokyo in May 2011, accompanied by a &quot;Playbutton&quot; release. Atom™ performances at the Lincoln Center in New York City, &quot;Communikey Festival&quot; in Boulder, the Raster-Noton/Mute festival at the Roundhouse in London, Labyrinth Festival in Japan plus many others. Exclusive contributions to Ryuichi Sakamoto&#x27;s &quot;Kizunaworld&quot; project and Tōwa Tei&#x27;s &quot;Mach&quot; online platform.

A second &quot;Winterreise&quot; exhibition was held in Frankfurt (Germany) in October 2011 as well as the &quot;Winterreise&quot; soundtrack was released in May 2012 through Raster-Noton. atom-tm.com was launched in July 2012 and serves as Atom™&#x27;s official news platform and archive. As a result of the &quot;Winterreise&quot; release, Atom™ received an invitation from Richie Hawtin to play an ambient set at his club in Ibiza. The invitation was accepted and the then entitled &quot;Alpha txt&quot; ambient set created, which was then again performed, opening the Labyrinth festival in September the same year. An initially abandoned album, which in 2005 carried the working title &quot;Hard Disc Rock&quot; (as a self-reference to the 1997 Atom™ title with the same name), resurfaced as &quot;HD&quot;, after some of the unfinished tracks raised interest at the Raster-Noton label. The album was finished during the second half of 2012, and mixed down during January 2013. The release of &quot;HD&quot; was then scheduled for March 2013. In the middle of the &quot;HD&quot; production, the terrible news of Pete Namlook&#x27;s sudden death reach Schmidt. Months later, as a practical consequence of Namlook&#x27;s passing away, the Rather Interesting label, which both Pete and Atom ran together since 1994, was shut down forever. Early 2013 sees Atom™ playing various live shows, such as the double opening feature at Berlin&#x27;s CTM.13, where he first performs &quot;Bauteile&quot; with colleague Marc Behrens, and later on, together with Material Object, plays a three-hour &quot;Alpha txt&quot; set. Extensive promotional activities for &quot;HD&quot;, which, amongst other results, bring Atom™ on the front page of Germany&#x27;s De:bug magazine and the preparation for the &quot;HD&quot; and &quot;Ground Loop&quot; live sets keep Atom™ busy during the first couple of months of 2013.

In July 2024, he was criticised for headlining the Outline festival in Russia during the country&#x27;s war against Ukraine. He argued that the criticism was a &quot;smear campaign&quot; against him. Ukrainian activist Maya Baklanova countered that &quot;All western artists who perform there are normalising the war and the Russian regime&quot;.

<text>Packard Bell is a personal computer hardware brand which originated as Packard Bell Electronics, Inc., an independent American computer company founded in Los Angeles in 1986 by Israeli-American investors who bought the trademark rights to the historic Packard Bell Corporation from Teledyne; in spite of similarities in their names, Packard Bell has no connection to either Hewlett-Packard or Bell System. 

Packard Bell helped to pioneer the mass market for PCs in the United States by selling in big office stores. In the early 1990s, the company entered the European market and opened its regional headquarters in Wijchen, Netherlands, in 1993. By this time, they had become the second largest OEM for IBM PC–compatibles in the U.S. Packard Bell merged its operations with Japanese electronics conglomerate NEC, known as Packard Bell NEC, in 1996; NEC took majority control in 1998 and made it a subsidiary.

At the time of the merger, Packard Bell was the largest PC maker in the American market having overtaken Compaq, but increasing competition and losses led to NEC stopping its North American operations by 2000, focusing squarely on European and other markets under its profitable Packard Bell Europe in the Netherlands, which later diversified to products such as portable media players. This unit, renamed to NEC Computers International, became responsible for all Packard Bell and NEC operations outside of Japan and China. In 2006, NEC divested the Packard Bell division to Chinese-American entrepreneur Lap Shun Hui, and in 2008, the brand was acquired by Taiwanese firm Acer, in the aftermath of their takeover of Gateway, Inc. Packard Bell BV under Acer, based in Nijmegen, continued making Packard Bell products for the European, African and Middle Eastern markets until at least 2013. Southern Telecom Inc. later acquired the rights to the brand in North America and started selling PCs there in 2018. Universal Exports Group Limited a Hong Kong based manufacturing company licensed the brand name from Acer in Taiwan in 2019 for the SADC region. 

==History==
===1986–1987: Foundation===

The Packard Bell computer company was incorporated in Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California, in 1986 by Beny Alagem, Jason Barzilay, and Alex Sandel, three Israeli-born United States businessmen based in California. Packard Bell was previously the namesake of an American consumer electronics company founded in the 1920s, Packard Bell Electronics. The latter made a name for itself for its radios before branching out to television sets in the 1950s.

In the 1960s, as with many American consumer electronics companies, Packard Bell encountered difficulty in the marketplace due to increasing competition from Japanese companies like Sony, Sanyo, and Panasonic. In 1968, Packard Bell was acquired by Teledyne Technologies, an electronics conglomerate. Teledyne let the Packard Bell trademark languish in the following years; by the mid-1970s, it was all but retired. Alagem, fascinated by Packard Bell&#x27;s history as a once-beloved consumer electronics brand, bartered Teledyne for the rights to the trademark for just under $100,000. Alagem later found that brand recognition for Packard Bell was at 70 percent, among a random sampling of adults in the United States.

Alagem and Barzilay met in the 1970s after the former had graduated from Cal Poly. Together, they founded a semiconductor distribution company. In 1983, they merged with another electronics supplier owned by Sandel to form Cal Circuit Abco, Inc., in Woodland Hills, California. Cal Circuit Abco sold computer peripherals on top of semiconductor and had generated over $500 million in annual revenues by 1985. Seeing the increasing commodification of the IBM Personal Computer standard by way of clone makers, or companies that manufactured systems which were plug- and software-compatible with the IBM PC architecture, the three businessmen decided they wanted in and reincorporated Cal Circuit Abco as Packard Bell Electronics in 1986, after Alagem had bought the Packard Bell name from Teledyne. The three leveraged their business connections with Asian electronics companies formed through Cal Circuit Abco to contract the production of an IBM PC clone. They settled on several companies, most prominently Samsung Electronics of Korea and Tatung Company of Taiwan—the former designing and manufacturing the desktop chassis and motherboards and the latter supplying their monitors.

===1987–1993: Market launch and early success===
The first Packard Bell PC was released to retail in late 1986. As the hardware was largely bare-bones and derivative, the company could not market the computer based on technical merit, nor could they stand to profit from royalties on patents. Instead, the founders were forced to rely on a low price tag for the system, as well as the founders&#x27; shared knowledge of marketing and merchandising learned from their electronics vending businesses. In selling the computer they developed three core strategies: equipping their computer systems with various value-adds while selling the complete bundle at a low cost, leaning on the history of the Packard Bell name, and vending the computers at mass retailers.

Packard Bell was the first PC clone manufacturer to have the MS-DOS operating system and various pack-in applications preinstalled onto the computers&#x27; hard drives, saving customers the hassle of formatting the hard drive with a functional file system, while providing novices basic software to get a running start on the PC paradigm. The hard drives of Packard Bell&#x27;s low-end line-up of computers were larger than the competition&#x27;s hard-drive-equipped offerings, at 40 MB, while sold at a lower price. Packard Bell was one of the first PC vendors to offer systems with both 3.5-inch and 5.25-inch floppy disk drives, providing a bridge to the newer 3.5-inch floppy format—the use of which in the PC world was being accelerated by IBM with their next-generation PS/2 line of personal computers.

Meanwhile, the company&#x27;s first slogan—&quot;America grew up listening to us. It still does&quot;—was devised to appeal to the nostalgia of older buyers while imparting a sense of longevity in the company. This combined with the Packard Bell trademark&#x27;s existing brand equity gave the company instant prestige, a rarity among newcomers to the PC market. The company sometimes benefited from misplaced name recognition, according to &quot;Fortune&quot;, with consumers, especially first-time computer buyers, erroneously associating the company with others of a similar name to Packard Bell, such as Hewlett-Packard, Pacific Bell, and Bell Laboratories.

Instrumental to Packard Bell&#x27;s early success was their decision to distribute their systems to mass market retailers such as Sears, as well as wholesale clubs and consumer electronics stores. Packard Bell was one of the first PC clone vendors to adopt these sales channels, at a time when PCs were nearly universally sold through mail order, sales representatives, or specialized computer stores. While the established name-brand PC vendors were reluctant to sell their systems at these types of retailers in favor of cultivating lucrative service contracts with their customers, the percentage of PCs sold through mass market retailers rose threefold between 1987 and 1992—from 4 percent to 12 percent—with Packard Bell dominating within this niche. Within less than three years of the company&#x27;s incorporation, Packard Bell saw an annual sales figure of US$600 million in 1989. Even amid the early 1990s recession, annual sales in 1991 grew to US$700 million. Sales were helped along by Packard Bell&#x27;s penetration into new markets—such as local area network systems for enterprises and CPU cards for power users—as well as the company&#x27;s extensive customer support package for all customers, offering live technical support over the phone, toll-free and around the clock. Packard Bell dubbed their customer support system Infinitech, which provided prerecorded troubleshooting tips in addition to a line to staffed technical support. The company also provided Infinitech through their bulletin-board systems hosted on CompuServe and Prodigy.

Packard Bell hoped to go public and file its initial public offering in the spring or summer of 1992. Planning a 5.2-million share offering at between $13.50 and $15.50 a share, the offering would have retired the majority of the company&#x27;s $93 million debt. However, Packard Bell&#x27;s IPO was postponed in June amid an inclement personal computer market that saw many other computer companies pull their IPOs due to mounting competition from Compaq, Dell, and AST Research. It was eventually cancelled altogether, Packard Bell remaining a private company throughout the rest of its existence.

=== 1993–1995: Increasing market share and expansion in Europe ===
After clocking annual sales of over $900 million in 1992, Packard Bell passed the $1-billion mark in 1993, with annual sales that year of nearly $1.25 billion, at which point the company employed over 700 workers in the United States. Packard Bell&#x27;s American market share among PC manufacturers likewise grew from 5.3 percent to 6.7 percent between 1992 and 1993. They were then the fourth-largest personal computer vendor in the United States, trailing IBM, Apple, and Compaq.

As other name-brand competitors began adopting Packard Bell&#x27;s core strategies of bundling software and expansions, slashing prices, and selling through mass market retailers, Packard Bell responded by offering products at the high-end of the market and moving into Europe, where they were beginning to make inroads. After netting $100 million in sales to Europe in 1992 (10 percent of the company&#x27;s global sales), Packard Bell constructed a 75,000-square-foot building in the Netherlands and hired 250 workers in the country, including a diverse remote customer service team providing technical support in 12 different languages. By 1993, Packard Bell&#x27;s products were stocked in 1,500 retail locations across 13 countries, and by 1994, the company was selling 2.1 million product units per year, doubling their previous year&#x27;s output.Packard Bell&#x27;s growing adoption rates into the mid-1990s were helped along by a new industrial design language and user-friendly software. In 1993, the company introduced Navigator, a shell replacement for Windows 3.1 intended for novice computer users that provides simple screens of large icons to launch their commonly used application software. In 1994, they released Navigator 2, replacing the icons with a hyper-skeuomorphic house metaphor, in which every screen of icons is within a prerendered 3D-CGI room in a house. Packard Bell acquired the software firm responsible for Navigator, Ark Interface of Seattle, Washington, in May 1994. That same year, Packard Bell acquired Active Imagination, Inc., of Westlake Village, California, a developer of edutainment video games for children. With this acquisition, Packard Bell made the shift toward providing standalone software packages in retail outlets for the first time.

Also in 1994, Packard Bell hired industrial design firm Frog Design, known for their work with Apple and NeXT, to redesign Packard Bell&#x27;s personal computer line. They designed the cases of company&#x27;s next generation of desktops with accented trim panels featuring wavy contours; these panels can be detached and replaced with ones of a different color. With these redesigned cases, Packard Bell was the first company to use a color-coding system for the external connectors on the rear of the computer, corresponding with the color of the shroud of the plugs on the devices that Packard Bell provided with their computers (e.g., purple for keyboards, teal for mice). This innovation was intended to make installation of peripherals easier and predated the PC System Design Guide standard for color-coding connectors, introduced in 1999.

Packard Bell&#x27;s Chatsworth headquarters were seriously damaged in the January 1994 Northridge earthquake—the epicenter of which was located just a few blocks from their six-building complex—grinding operations to a halt and putting 1,500 employees temporarily out of work. Buckling racks destroyed factory equipment and inventory, while the reactivation of municipal water activated sprinklers and caused substantial water damage, destroying much of the company&#x27;s paperwork. A week after the earthquake, its sales offices and part of its production operations were moved to a 160,000-square-foot complex in Westlake Village, California, on an interim basis. The company later relocated its operations to a new headquarter complex in Sacramento (the former property of the Sacramento Army Depot), in summer 1995. Its customer service team meanwhile was relocated to an out-of-state office in Utah.

===1995–2001: Reversal of fortunes and acquisition by NEC===

Packard Bell saw gross revenues of $3 billion in 1994 and became the third-largest personal computer vendor in the United States, trailing Compaq and IBM. In 1995, they overtook Compaq for the number one spot in American PC market share, cornering 13 percent of sales in the United States, following a 37-percent rate of growth from the previous year. While the company had seen tremendous growth in the mid-1990s, the long-term efficacy of the company&#x27;s core strategies were being challenged by mail-order computer vendors such as Dell and Gateway 2000, who were able to shirk the large overheads of warehousing and vending by selling build-to-order. Packard Bell&#x27;s reliance on retail also imparted a large rate of return on their products, due to the unqualified return and exchange policies most of Packard Bell&#x27;s retail partners afforded their customers. In 1991 alone, the company deducted $143 million in customer returns on $819 million in gross sales that year. By the end of 1995, Packard Bell saw their profit drop, and they dropped to the number two spot in American PC market share, behind Compaq. The company&#x27;s reputation around this time was also beginning to be marred by quality control issues and subpar customer service.

In April 1995, Compaq launched a lawsuit against Packard Bell for not disclosing that Packard Bell computers incorporated used parts, claiming that this practice of refurbishment without disclosure allowed Packard Bell to unfairly undercut their competition. This practice was, in fact, widespread in the computer industry, including Compaq itself. However, unlike its rival companies, Packard Bell was judged not to have advertised the practice sufficiently in its warranties—Compaq, for instance, placed numerous stickers on boxes of their refurbished hardware indicating this status. Attorneys general across 12 states launched investigations into Packard Bell in June 1995; the following month, Packard Bell settled nine class-action suits in three states, including California, providing reimbursement in the form of $50 worth of repairs for free in the short term, establishing a $1-million fund for monetary reimbursement in the long term, and changing its warranty policy. Packard Bell eventually paid $5 million to 22 states to settle the issue in September 1996. Packard Bell countersued Compaq in October 1995, citing &quot;unfair competition and defamation&quot;. They settled out of court in February 1996, after Compaq themselves were facing heat from multiple states for their own refurbishment practices.

In early 1996, Packard Bell acquired Zenith Data Systems from Groupe Bull of France, in a three-way deal which saw Groupe Bull and Japanese electronics conglomerate NEC increasing their existing stakes in Packard Bell. Shortly after, in June 1996, NEC announced that they would acquire Packard Bell, merging it with NEC&#x27;s global personal computer operations. The merger was finalized in July 1996; the resulting division became known as Packard Bell NEC, selling computer systems under both NEC and Packard Bell faceplates. For a brief period, Packard Bell NEC was the largest PC manufacturer, in terms of units shipped, in the United States, with 15 percent of market share; it was also the third largest PC vendor in the world in terms of sales at the end of 1996. However, Compaq overtook the number one spot from Packard Bell NEC in early 1997, at which point the latter fell behind Apple in retail sales to the number three spot.

Between 1997 and 1998, Packard Bell posted losses totaling more than $1 billion. In the United States, price pressure from Compaq and, later, eMachines, along with continued poor showings in consumer satisfaction surveys made it difficult for the company to remain profitable and led to Alagem&#x27;s departure in 1998. In 1999, NEC began withdrawing the Packard Bell name from the American market, while keeping it in Europe, where the brand was untainted by allegations of substandard quality. 

=== 2001–2006: NEC Computers International ===
By 2003, Packard Bell had offices in 24 countries—none in the United States.

===2006–2009: Divestiture from NEC and acquisition by Acer Inc.===
In 2006, the chairman of the California-based Clifford Holdings, Lap Shun Hui, acquired the rights to the Packard Bell name from NEC for an undisclosed sum, establishing PB Holdings Company in the process. Hui was in talks with Lenovo Group of China to sell the rights to the Packard Bell name to the latter in early 2007. However, Acer Inc. of Taiwan ultimately intervened, making a binding offer to acquire PB Holdings in October 2007. Acer&#x27;s acquisition of Packard Bell occurred in the aftermath of their recent takeover of Gateway in August 2007 and was said to be a strategic deal to prevent Lenovo&#x27;s expansion into Europe, where Acer had a strong presence. The deal was finalized between January and February 2008, Hui receiving $48.5 million in cash. 

With the purchases of Packard Bell and Gateway, Acer arranged their marketing strategy so that Gateway products were sold in the Americas and Asia, while Packard Bell products were sold in Africa, Europe and the Middle East; Acer-branded products meanwhile were sold worldwide. In 2013, Acer announced that the eMachines brand will be discontinued in the low-end market but that both Packard Bell and Gateway would continue.

=== 2018–present: Revival in North America ===
Since the mid-2010s, the Packard Bell brand in North America has been owned by Southern Telecom, Inc., a Brooklyn-based manufacturer of consumer electronics. In 2018, the company announced that it will release new computers branded as Packard Bell in this region.

=== 2019–present: Revival in Africa ===
Since 2019 Packard Bell has been manufactured under licensed by Universal Exports Group Limited from Acer Taiwan in the SADC region, Universal has released new models of Phones, Tablets and Laptops which are most prominently available in South Africa.

<text>A gale is a strong wind; the word is typically used as a descriptor in nautical contexts. The U.S. National Weather Service defines a gale as sustained surface wind moving at a speed between . Forecasters typically issue gale warnings when winds of this strength are expected. In the United States, a gale warning is specifically a maritime warning; the land-based equivalent in National Weather Service warning products is a wind advisory.

Other sources use minima as low as , and maxima as high as . Through 1986, the National Hurricane Center used the term “gale” to refer to winds of for coastal areas between and . The definition is very non-standard. A common alternative definition of the maximum is .

The most common way of describing wind force is with the Beaufort scale that defines a gale as wind from to . It is an empirical measure for describing wind speed based mainly on observed sea conditions. On the original 1810 Beaufort wind force scale, there were four different &quot;gale&quot; designations whereas generally today there are two gale forces, 8 and 9, and a near gale 7:

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;gale&quot; is derived from the Middle English &quot;gale&quot;, a general word for wind of any strength, even a breeze. This word is probably of North Germanic origin, related to Icelandic &quot;gola&quot; (breeze) and Danish &quot;gal&quot; (furious, mad), which are both from Old Norse &quot;gala&quot; (to sing), from Proto-Germanic *&quot;galaną&quot; (to roop, sing, charm), from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;gʰel&quot;- (to shout, scream, charm away).

<doc id="320911" wikidata="Q176075" url="?curid=320911" title="Robert Bond">
<text>Sir Robert Bond (25 February 1857 – 16 March 1927) was a Newfoundlander politician who was the last Premier of Newfoundland Colony from 1900 to 1907 and the first prime minister of the Dominion of Newfoundland from 1907 to 1909 after the 1907 Imperial Conference conferred dominion status on the colony.

== Early life ==
Bond was born in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, the son of merchant John Bond. Bond grew up in St. John&#x27;s until 1872 when his father died and left the family a good deal of money. He went to England where he was educated and came back to Newfoundland and articled under Sir William Whiteway.

==Political career==

He got involved in politics in 1882 when he ran for the House of Assembly in Trinity Bay. He was speaker of the House of Assembly before the Whiteway government was defeated in 1885. He was elected to the House for Fortune Bay in the 1885 election, Trinity Bay in the 1889 and 1893 elections, and for Twillingate in the 1897, 1900, 1904, 1908, 1909, and 1913 elections. When Whiteway came back into power in 1889; Bond was made Colonial Secretary. He tried to negotiate free trade with the United States but it failed because of Canada&#x27;s objection.

The government was defeated by judicial means in 1894; however, it came back to power shortly as a result of the bank crash of 1894. Bond became leader of the Liberal Party after Whiteway lost the 1897 election. He became Premier in 1900 after the Conservatives under Sir James Winter lost a vote of confidence. In 1902 he attended the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra and the conference of Colonial Premiers in London.

As Premier, he once again tried to negotiate free trade with the United States. It failed because of the objections of US senator Henry Cabot Lodge. Teddy Roosevelt tried to intervene but was not successful and it ended the friendship between the two nations. Relations between the United States and Newfoundland deteriorated to the point where, in November 1905 in Bonne Bay, local fisherman clashed with Americans trying to buy bait on shore. In 1904, Bond was re-elected with a clear majority. He went on to settle the French Shore issue which gave Newfoundland full control over the island. Following the 1907 Imperial Conference, Newfoundland and the other self-governing British colonies were given dominion status and Bond formally became the first prime minister of the Dominion of Newfoundland.

In 1907, his Attorney General Sir Edward Patrick Morris walked across the floor and started his own party called the Peoples Party. In the 1908 election the two parties came to a tie getting 18 seats each out of the 36 seats. Bond was asked by Governor William MacGregor if he could form a government and said that he could not because he would have to elect a government member as Speaker. Morris was asked and said he could and was sworn in as Prime Minister. His government failed as soon as Parliament was convened.

In the 1909 election, Morris won because he controlled government funds. Bond again led the Liberals into election in 1913 in an alliance with the Unionist Party of William Coaker. They failed to defeat Morris and Bond resigned as Liberal Leader in January 1914. In 1919 and again in 1923, the Liberals tried to persuade him to return. Bond responded with the prophetic response &quot;If only I had the strength, how the fitters would fly; My poor country Newfoundland, the last stage&quot;. Bond died on his country estate in Whitbourne at the age of 70.

==Honours==

Bond received several honours during his premiership. On 24 October 1901, Bond was invested as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) during the visit to St John&#x27;s of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary). During his 1902 visit to London he was sworn a member of the Imperial Privy Council on 11 August 1902, following an announcement of the King&#x27;s intention to make this appointment in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published in June that year. He was given the freedom of the city of Edinburgh during a visit to the city on 26 July 1902, and of the City of London, Manchester, and Bristol in 1907. When he visited Edinburgh in July 1902 ha was also awarded an honorary LL.D. by the University of Edinburgh.

<doc id="320917" wikidata="Q115055" url="?curid=320917" title="David Geffen">
<text>David Lawrence Geffen (born February 21, 1943) is an American film producer, record executive, and media proprietor. In music, he co-founded Asylum Records with Elliot Roberts in 1971 before founding Geffen Records in 1980, DGC Records in 1990, and co-founding DreamWorks Records (with Mo Ostin, Michael Ostin and Lenny Waronker) in 1996. In film, he founded the Geffen Film Company in 1986 and co-founded DreamWorks SKG (with Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg) in 1994.

== Early life and education ==
David Geffen was born in Borough Park, Brooklyn, New York, to Abraham Geffen and Batya Volovskaya (1909–1988). Geffen&#x27;s mother owned a clothing store in Borough Park called Chic Corsets by Geffen. Both of his parents were Jewish immigrants who met in Mandatory Palestine and then moved to the United States. His older brother Mitchell (born Mischa) Geffen (1933–2006) was an attorney who attended UCLA Law School and later settled in Encino, California.

Geffen graduated from Brooklyn&#x27;s New Utrecht High School in 1960 with a &quot;barely passing 66 average&quot;. He attended the University of Texas at Austin for a semester, and then Brooklyn College, before again dropping out. He then moved to Los Angeles, California to find his way in the entertainment business. He attended Santa Monica College (then known as Santa Monica City College) in Santa Monica, California, but soon left. Geffen attributed his challenges in school to dyslexia.

== Business career ==
After a brief appearance as an extra in the 1961 film &quot;The Explosive Generation&quot;, Geffen began his entertainment career in 1964 as a mailroom clerk at the William Morris Agency (WMA), where he quickly became a talent agent. He learned about showbiz politics while reading the memos he delivered between agents. In order to obtain the talent agent job, he had to prove he was a college graduate. As he later reported in an interview, he claimed in his job application at WMA that he had graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). Because he worked in the mailroom, Geffen was able to intercept a letter from UCLA to WMA which stated that he had not graduated from UCLA. He modified the letter to show that he had attended and graduated, then submitted it to WMA. His colleagues in the mailroom included Elliot Roberts, who later became Geffen&#x27;s partner at Asylum Records.

In 1968, Geffen left WMA and became a talent agent for Ashley-Famous Agency. In 1969, he was executive vice president and talent agent for Creative Management Associates. At this time he also started working as a personal manager and was immediately successful with Laura Nyro and Crosby, Stills and Nash.

When Geffen was engaged in the process of looking for a record deal for young Jackson Browne, Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun suggested that Geffen start his own record label.

=== Asylum Records ===
Geffen co-founded Asylum Records in 1971 with Elliot Roberts after Geffen was unable to get Jackson Browne a record deal anywhere else. The name Asylum was chosen because of the owners&#x27; reputations for signing artists who would struggle to find a record company that would contract with them. The label was distributed by Atlantic Records at this time. Asylum became a generator of the Southern California folk-rock sound and signed artists such as Eagles, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Linda Ronstadt, Warren Zevon, Judee Sill, and JD Souther. Later in the 1970s Geffen left Asylum, which was later acquired by Atlantic&#x27;s parent company, Warner Communications, and merged with Elektra Records in 1972 to become Elektra/Asylum Records. The label was revived in 2004 as an urban music operation, signing hip-hop artists such as Waka Flocka Flame, Cam’ron, Gucci Mane, Paul Wall, Mike Jones and Bun B.

Geffen remained in charge until December 1975, when he went to work as vice chairman of Warner Bros. film studios. He then retired and in 1977 was informed (erroneously) that he had cancer. During his retirement period he spent a short time (the fall of 1978 and spring of 1979) teaching a noncredit seminar on the music industry and arts management at Yale University, where he featured classroom guests Jackson Browne and Paul Simon. In 1980 a new medical diagnosis revealed the error in the original diagnosis and Geffen was given a clean bill of health, whereupon he decided to return to working in the entertainment industry.

=== Geffen Records ===
In 1980, he founded his eponymous record label and recruited Warner Bros. Records executive Ed Rosenblatt as president. The Geffen label&#x27;s meteoric rise to prominence within the year proved a bittersweet success. Geffen&#x27;s first artist to sign on was Donna Summer, who was anxious to leave Casablanca/PolyGram Records. Geffen shortly after released her &quot;The Wanderer&quot; album, the lead single of which reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and the album certified gold. Casablanca countered by releasing more singles off her 1979 &quot;Bad Girls&quot; album such as the song Walk Away and a similarly named hits compilation to compete, but by then New Wave sound was dominating the airwaves.

The November 1980 release of John Lennon&#x27;s album &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; seems an impressive feat for a new label, but at the time Lennon stated that Geffen was the only one with enough confidence in him to agree to a deal without hearing the record first. Yoko Ono, Lennon&#x27;s wife and partner, stated that Geffen was the only label head to pay attention to her. In December 1980, Lennon was murdered and &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; became a massive seller. Over the years Geffen Records/DGC has released recordings by artists including Olivia Newton-John, Asia, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Elton John, Cher, Sonic Youth, Aerosmith, Whitesnake, XTC, Peter Gabriel, Weezer, Lone Justice, Blink-182, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Nirvana, the Simpsons, Lifehouse, Tyketto, Pat Metheny, Sloan, the Stone Roses and Neil Young.

The label had been distributed by Warner Bros. Records since its inception, but in 1990 the label was sold to MCA Records with Geffen receiving shares in MCA worth $550 million. A year later, Matsushita Electric acquired MCA and paid Geffen $670 million. Geffen continued to run the label before leaving Geffen Records in 1995. In late 1996 after being sold to Seagram, MCA reincorporated into its subsidiary name, Universal Studios, Inc., while MCA Music Entertainment was renamed Universal Music Group. The Geffen label was restructured under the recently renamed company. On December 10, 1998, Seagram acquired PolyGram for $10.6 billion; the latter&#x27;s music division was merged into UMG, thus, on New Year&#x27;s Day 1999, Geffen Records was merged with its sister label, Interscope Records, and PolyGram subsidiary, A&amp;M Records, to become Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records. Its division, DGC Records, would be absorbed into Geffen soon after, but Beck and Sonic Youth did not fulfill their contracts with the sublabel until 2003. After years of low sales and profits, Geffen laid off or vacated 110 workers, but later recovered under Interscope&#x27;s supervision, which at the time, was under leadership of Jimmy Iovine. In 2003, Universal dissolved MCA Records and DreamWorks Records; MCA president Jay Boberg had resigned the prior spring while UMG (in October) acquired the latter label from Geffen&#x27;s film label, DreamWorks Pictures, with rosters from both labels transitioning to Geffen Records. The acquisitions and later dissolutions of both imprints caused 120 staff layoffs, while some remained under Geffen; few went to work for its parent, Interscope.

In February 2024, Universal Music Group reorganized Geffen Records and its parent label, Interscope Records, through a unit merger with sister label, Capitol Records (which they acquired from now-defunct EMI in 2012). As a result, in today&#x27;s time, Geffen, Interscope and Capitol now operate autonomously under a newly built music label unit, Interscope Capitol Labels Group.

Despite the fact that Geffen founded and owned Geffen Records, former president Eddie Rosenblatt, who died on July 17, 2024 (aged 89), was acknowledged to have been the one who led Geffen Records during its glory years in the 1980s and 1990s.

=== Geffen Film/DreamWorks SKG ===
Through the Geffen Film Company, Geffen produced dark-tinged comedies such as the remake of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (1986), &quot;Risky Business&quot; (1983) and &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988). Geffen was the Broadway backer for the musicals &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; and &quot;Cats&quot;. In 1994, Geffen co-founded the DreamWorks SKG studio with Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg. In 1995, DreamWorks signed a $100 million deal with ABC. In 2008, Geffen left DreamWorks.

== Philanthropy ==

In 1995, he donated $5 million towards UCLA&#x27;s Westwood Playhouse. The theater was renamed the Geffen Playhouse.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot; (&quot;The 400 Richest Americans of 2004&quot;) and other sources, Geffen has pledged to give whatever money he makes from now on to charity, although he has not specified which charities or the manner of his giving. In 2002, he announced a $200 million unrestricted endowment for the School of Medicine at UCLA. The School thereafter was named David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. On December 13, 2012, UCLA announced that Geffen had donated another $100 million in addition to his 2002 donation of $200 million, making him the largest individual benefactor for the UC system. The latest donation funds the full cost of attendance for up to 30 students per year, beginning with the Class of 2017.

In 2015, Geffen pledged $100 million toward renovation of what was then called the Avery Fisher Hall, part of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York. His gift, which amounted to about 20% of the hall&#x27;s renovation costs, gave him naming rights in perpetuity over the building, now known as David Geffen Hall.

In December 2020, Geffen pledged to donate $46 million to the UCLA medical school, which is named after him.

In June 2021, Geffen gave $150 million to the Yale School of Drama. This gift allowed the drama school to eliminate tuition for all students enrolled in master’s, doctoral, and certificate programs. The school was renamed the David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University.

In September 2021, Columbia Business School announced that David Geffen had made a gift of $75 million to support the school&#x27;s new facilities in the Manhattanville neighborhood, north of Columbia&#x27;s main campus. In recognition of his donation, the East Building will be renamed David Geffen Hall when opened in 2022.

== Personal life ==

=== Sexuality ===
Geffen was initially defensive about his sexuality. During the 1970s he dated Cher and spent 18 months in a relationship with her. They began their relationship in 1973, while Cher was still married to Sonny Bono, but their marriage was already ending. Geffen helped Cher gain independence in her career, since she was dependent on Sonny for some business contracts that Geffen would later call &quot;slave labor.&quot; In early 1974, Cher&#x27;s divorce became public and was heavily covered by the media, and it was at this time that Cher and Geffen made their first appearance together, at the Grammy Awards ceremony. It was from this moment that Geffen became a media celebrity. Eventually, Cher left him for Gregg Allman. Geffen eventually came out as gay in 1992. In May 2007, &quot;Out&quot; magazine ranked Geffen first in its list of the 50 &quot;Most Powerful Gay Men and Women in America&quot;. Geffen reportedly married former go-go dancer Donovan Michaels in 2023.

=== Wealth ===
As of October 2023, Geffen has an estimated net worth of $9.1 billion, making him one of the richest people in the entertainment industry.

In February 2020, Geffen sold his Beverly Hills estate to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos for $165 million, a price believed to be the highest ever paid for a home in a California real estate transaction. In June 2020, Geffen purchased Casey Wasserman&#x27;s Beverly Hills estate for $68 million.

In 2007, Geffen bought a half-share in friend Larry Ellison&#x27;s luxury yacht &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, then at the sixth largest motor yacht in the world. After Ellison ordered a new and more compact yacht, he sold his remaining half share in &quot;Rising Sun&quot; to Geffen in 2010.

In 2009, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich agreed to a divorce settlement with his wife Irina that resulted in her taking ownership of the yacht &quot;Pelorus&quot;. Approached on Geffen&#x27;s behalf by broker Merle Wood, Geffen bought &quot;Pelorus&quot; in 2011 for $300 million. Later that year Geffen sold &quot;Pelorus&quot; to Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan for €214 million, way below its former price.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Geffen drew backlash for posting on Instagram that he and a 45-member crew were self-isolating in the Grenadines on the &quot;Rising Sun&quot;.

David Geffen has been ranked the most polluting individual American and second most polluting individual in the world, largely due to his yachts.

=== Art collection ===
Geffen is a keen collector of American artists&#x27; work, including Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning. According to the chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, Paul Schimmel: &quot;There&#x27;s no collection that has a better representation of post-war American art than David Geffen&#x27;s.&quot;

In October 2006, Geffen sold two paintings by Jasper Johns and a De Kooning from his collection for a combined sum of $143.5 million. On November 3, 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Geffen had sold Pollock&#x27;s 1948 painting &quot;No. 5, 1948&quot; from his collection for $140 million (£73.35 million) to Mexican financier David Martinez. Martinez is the founder of London-based Fintech Advisory Ltd, a financial house that specializes in buying Third World debt. The sale made &quot;No. 5, 1948&quot; the most expensive painting ever sold (outstripping the $134 million paid in October 2006 for Gustav Klimt&#x27;s portrait &quot;Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I,&quot; purchased by cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder).

Wealth-X reported in June 2013 that Geffen owns the most valuable private art collection in the world, and estimated its worth at $1.1B at the time.

In February 2016, Bloomberg News reported that Geffen had sold De Kooning&#x27;s 1955 oil painting, &quot;Interchange&quot;, for $300 million, and Pollock&#x27;s 1948 painting, &quot;Number 17A&quot;, for $200 million, both to hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin.

=== Political views ===
Geffen is a donor to Democratic Party candidates and organizations, and was an early financial supporter of President Bill Clinton. In 2001, he had a quarrel with the former president over Clinton&#x27;s decision not to pardon Leonard Peltier, on whose behalf he had lobbied the President.

Geffen was an early supporter of Barack Obama’s presidential campaign and raised $1.3 million for Obama in a Beverly Hills fundraiser.

Along with other Hollywood figures including Steven Spielberg and Brad Pitt, Geffen donated to oppose Proposition 8 in the November 2008 election. Proposition 8 would have amended California&#x27;s Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. California&#x27;s voters passed Proposition 8 by a margin of 52.24% to 47.76%. Decisions in federal courts ultimately invalidated California&#x27;s prohibition of same-sex marriage. See 2008 California Proposition 8 § Legal challenges.

Geffen, among other wealthy Democrats, donated to the Lincoln Project, a Republican-led super PAC that opposed the re-election of Donald Trump and the Republican Senators who supported Trump in the 2020 election.

== Controversy ==
=== Coastal access ===
Until 2017, Geffen owned a Malibu compound on Carbon Beach. In 1983 Geffen received permits from the California Coastal Commission to build a Cape Cod-style compound over multiple beachfront lots in exchange for creating a public pathway to the beach. He failed to build that pathway, and in 2002, filed a lawsuit to block public access altogether. After a protracted three-year legal battle, Geffen reached a settlement with the Coastal Commission, granting the public a nine-foot-wide easement to the beach and reimbursing the state and non-profit groups $300,000 in legal fees. The pathway was opened on May 30, 2005, to national and international media coverage. The controversy has been called the &quot;most famous Malibu battle&quot; for beach access. The Coastal Commission later contacted the state transportation department without receiving a response to ask if the curb cuts that prevented public parking were valid, amid rumors that Geffen had installed four fake garage doors.

=== Accusations of insider trading ===
On March 9, 2022, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Geffen, Barry Diller and Diller&#x27;s stepson, Alex Von Furstenberg, were being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Department of Justice for insider trading of options on Activision Blizzard just three days before Microsoft&#x27;s announced acquisition. Diller denied the allegations and claimed it was &quot;simply a lucky bet&quot;.

== Awards and honors ==
In 2010, Geffen was a recipient of Ahmet Ertegun Award from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In 2011, Geffen was awarded with the President&#x27;s Merit Award for &quot;indelible contributions to the music industry&quot; from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at the 53rd Grammy Awards.

== Cultural references ==
While Geffen has produced music, he has also been the subject of several songs, documentaries and books.

Joni Mitchell and Geffen were close friends and, in the early 1970s, made a trip to Paris with Robbie Robertson and Robertson&#x27;s wife, Dominique. As a result of that trip, Mitchell wrote &quot;Free Man in Paris&quot; about Geffen. Geffen can be heard on Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;The Broadway Album&quot;, released in 1985. The track &quot;Putting It Together&quot; features Geffen, Sydney Pollack, and Ken Sylk portraying the voices of record company executives talking to Streisand.

Geffen is the subject of several books, most recently &quot;The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood&quot; (2001) by Tom King, who initially had Geffen&#x27;s cooperation, but later did not. An earlier biography was &quot;The Rise and Rise of David Geffen&quot; (1997) by Stephen Singular. He is also a featured character in &quot;Mailroom: Hollywood History From The Bottom Up&quot; by David Rensen, in &quot;Mansion On The Hill&quot; by Fred Goodman, in &quot;Hotel California&quot; by Barney Hoskyns, and in several books about Michael Ovitz.

He was the subject of an &quot;American Masters&quot; PBS television documentary titled &quot;Inventing David Geffen&quot;. The documentary was directed by Susan Lacy and was first broadcast on 20 November 2012. In the first series of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, the actor Bob Balaban played a character reported to be a thinly-veiled version of Geffen, as he pressured a sitting President to come out more strongly for Gay rights in America.

<text>Fredrik Bajer (21 April 1837 – 22 January 1922) was a Danish writer, teacher, and pacifist politician who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1908 together with Klas Pontus Arnoldson.

==Life==
He was son of a clergyman born in Næstved in 1837. Bajer served as an officer in the Danish army, fighting in the 1864 war against Prussia and Austria where he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. He was discharged in 1865, and moved to Copenhagen where he became a teacher, translator and writer.

He entered the Danish Parliament in 1872 as a member of Folketinget and held a seat there for the following 23 years. As a member of parliament, he worked for the use of international arbitration to solve conflicts among nations, and it Bajer&#x27;s efforts that caused foreign relations became part of the work of the Danish Parliament and that Denmark participated in the Inter-Parliamentary Union from the beginning and earned a distinguished position among its members.

He supported the early women&#x27;s suffrage organisation and many peace organizations, including the International Peace Bureau, both inside Denmark and Europe-wide, and he helped guide the passage of a bill to reach arbitration agreements with Sweden and Norway.

<doc id="320928" wikidata="Q376367" url="?curid=320928" title="Thomas Brisbane">
<text>Major General Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane, 1st Baronet, (23 July 1773 – 27 January 1860), was a British Army officer, administrator, and astronomer. Upon the recommendation of the Duke of Wellington, with whom he had served, he was appointed governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825.

A keen astronomer, he built the colony&#x27;s second observatory and encouraged scientific and agricultural training. Rivals besmirched his reputation and the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Bathurst, recalled Brisbane and his colonial secretary Frederick Goulburn. Brisbane, a new convict settlement, was named in his honour and is now the 3rd largest city in Australia.
==Early life==
Brisbane was born at Brisbane House in Noddsdale, near Largs in Ayrshire, Scotland, the son of Sir Thomas Brisbane and his wife Eleanora (née Bruce). He was educated in astronomy and mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. He joined the British Army&#x27;s 38th (1st Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot in 1789 and had a distinguished career in Flanders, the West Indies, Spain and North America. He served under the Duke of Wellington, and in 1813 he was promoted to major general. He saw much action during the Peninsular War, including leading a brigade in the 3rd Division that broke through at the Battle of Vitoria. He continued as a brigade commander in the War of 1812, where in 1814 he led a brigade at the Battle of Plattsburgh, which Brisbane claimed they could have won if they had been allowed to launch a full infantry attack.

During the battle, he used the Charles C. Platt Homestead as his headquarters. For his services in the Peninsula, Brisbane received the Army Gold Cross with one clasp for the battles of Vitoria, the Pyrenees, Nivelle, Orthez, and Toulouse; and the silver war medal with one clasp for the Nive.

In November 1819 he married Anna Maria Hay Makdougall of Makerstoun, Roxburghshire, Scotland. On his father-in-law&#x27;s death, Brisbane assumed the additional surname, becoming Makdougall Brisbane.

==Governor==
In 1821, on the recommendation of Wellington, Brisbane was appointed Governor of New South Wales, a post he held until 1825. Brisbane took over the government on 1 December 1821, and at once proceeded to carry out some of the reforms recommended in the report of John Bigge. While Governor he tackled the many problems of a rapidly growing and expanding colony. He worked to improve the land grants system and to reform the currency.

Brisbane&#x27;s keen interest in science led him to accept the invitation to become the first President of the Philosophical Society of Australasia that later became the Royal Society of New South Wales. He also set up the first agricultural training college in New South Wales and was the first patron of the New South Wales Agricultural Society. He conducted experiments in growing tobacco, cotton, coffee and New Zealand flax in the colony.

However, Brisbane did not always receive loyal support from his administrative officers, and in particular from Frederick Goulburn, the colonial secretary. A reference to Brisbane&#x27;s dispatch to Earl Bathurst dated 14 May 1825 shows that Bigge&#x27;s recommendations had been carefully considered, and that many improvements had been made. Brisbane did not limit his attention to Bigge&#x27;s report.

Early in April 1822, he discovered with some surprise the ease with which grants of land had hitherto been obtained. He immediately introduced a new system under which every grant had the stipulation that for every granted the grantee would maintain free of expense to the crown one convict labourer. He also encouraged agriculture on government land, streamlined granting of tickets of leave and pardons and introduced, in 1823, a system of calling for supplies by tender. When Dr. Robert Wardell and William Wentworth brought out their paper the &quot;Australian&quot; in 1824, Brisbane tried the experiment of allowing full latitude of the freedom of the press.

In 1823, Brisbane sent Lieutenant John Oxley to find a new site for convicts who were repeat offenders. Oxley discovered a large river flowing into Moreton Bay. A year later, the first convicts arrived at Moreton Bay. Brisbane visited the settlement in December 1824. Oxley suggested that both the river and the settlement be named after Brisbane. The convict settlement was declared a town in 1834 and opened to free settlement in 1839.

Brisbane was doing useful work, but he could not escape the effects of the constant faction fights which also plagued previous governors. Henry G. Douglass, the assistant-surgeon, was the centre of one of the bitter conflicts. Consequently, charges of various kinds against Brisbane were sent to England. The worst of these, that he had connived at sending female convicts to Emu Plains for immoral purposes, was investigated by William Stewart, the lieutenant-governor, John Stephen, assistant judge, and the Rev. William Cowper, senior assistant-chaplain, and found to be without the slightest foundation.

Brisbane discovered that Goulburn, the colonial secretary, had been withholding documents from him and answering some without reference to the governor, and in 1824 reported his conduct to Lord Bathurst. In reply, Bathurst recalled both the governor and the colonial secretary in dispatches dated 29 December 1824.

==Astronomer==

Brisbane was a keen astronomer throughout his career. He had an observatory built at his ancestral home in 1808. From this observatory he was able to contribute to the advances in navigation which took place over the next hundred years. He took telescopes, books and two astronomical assistants, Carl Ludwig Christian Rümker and James Dunlop to New South Wales with him. On arrival he had the first properly-equipped Australian observatory built at Parramatta while waiting for his predecessor, Governor Macquarie to complete his final arrangements.

The Parramatta observatory recorded stars of the southern hemisphere, the first detailed observations from the continent. Its major contribution was Rümker&#x27;s rediscovery of Encke&#x27;s comet in 1822. Brisbane left his equipment and books in the colony when he returned to Scotland. Remnants of this collection survive in the Sydney Observatory.

==Later years==
Brisbane left Sydney in December 1825 and returned to Scotland. In 1826 he was made colonel of the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot. He added the name of &quot;Makdougall&quot; before &quot;Brisbane&quot;, and settled down to the life of a country gentleman and took interest in science, his estate, and his regiment. He was elected president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1832) following the death of Sir Walter Scott, and in 1836 he was created a baronet. In the same year he was offered the command of the troops stationed in Canada and two years later the chief command in India, but declined both. He continued his astronomical researches, and did valuable work.

He was the first patron of science in Australia, and as such was eulogised by Sir John Herschel when he presented Brisbane with the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1828. Oxford and Cambridge universities gave him the honorary degree of DCL, and he was elected a fellow of the Royal Societies of both London and Edinburgh. He was created Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1814 and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1837.

In 1828, he won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. He published &quot;The Brisbane Catalogue&quot; of 7,385 stars of the Southern Hemisphere in 1835. The Observatory was used until 1855.

When Brisbane returned to Scotland he continued his studies and built a further observatory on his wife&#x27;s estate, Makerstoun, near Kelso in the Borders. He was a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and received its Keith Medal in 1848. In 1833 he acted as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He founded a gold medal for the encouragement of scientific research to be awarded by the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

Brisbane died on 27 January 1860 in Largs. His four children predeceased him. He is buried in the Brisbane Aisle Vault, which is in the small kirkyard next to the remains of Largs Old Kirk (known as Skelmorlie Aisle).

<text>Pinus radiata (syn. &quot;Pinus insignis&quot;), the Monterey pine, insignis pine or radiata pine, is a species of pine native to the Central Coast of California and Mexico (on Guadalupe Island and Cedros island). It is an evergreen conifer in the family Pinaceae.

&quot;P. radiata&quot; is a versatile, fast-growing, medium-density softwood, suitable for a wide range of uses and valued for rapid growth, as well as desirable lumber and pulp qualities. Its silviculture reflects a century of research, observation and practice. It is often considered a model for growers of other plantation species.

Although &quot;P. radiata&quot; is extensively cultivated as a plantation timber in many temperate parts of the world, it faces serious threats in its natural range, due to the introduction of a fungal parasite, the pine pitch canker (&quot;Fusarium circinatum&quot;).

==Description==
&quot;P. radiata&quot; is a coniferous evergreen tree growing to tall in the wild, but up to in cultivation in optimum conditions, with upward pointing branches and a rounded top. The leaves (&quot;needles&quot;) are bright green, in clusters of three (two in var. &quot;binata&quot;), slender, long and with a blunt tip. The ovulate cones are long, brown, ovoid (egg-shaped), and usually set asymmetrically on a branch, attached at an oblique angle. The bark is fissured and dark grey to brown. When not cut short by disease or harvesting, it has a lifespan of 80 to 90 years.

The specific epithet &quot;radiata&quot; refers to the cracks which radiate from the umbo of the cone scales.

It is closely related to bishop pine and knobcone pine, hybridizing readily with both species; it is distinguished from the former by needles in threes (not pairs), and from both by the cones not having a sharp spine on the scales.

The modern tree is vastly different from the native tree of Monterey. In plantations the tree is commonly planted at 4 square meter spacing on a wide variety of landscapes from flat to moderately steep hills. Because of selective breeding and more recently the extensive use of growth factor seedlings, forests planted since the 1990s have very straight tall trunks without the problem of twin leaders. The trees are pruned in three lifts so that the lower two-thirds of a mature tree is free of branches and hence of knots.

==Distribution and habitat==
In the United States, it is native to three very limited areas located in Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Luis Obispo Counties of California.

In Mexico, it is found on two islands in the Pacific Ocean, Guadalupe Island and Cedros Island. On Guadalupe Island, located off of the mainland coast, the pines are found on the steep northern end of the island, at elevations of around , where they follow the ridgetops and steep slopes. On Cedros Island, the pines are more abundant, being found in far greater numbers partly due to the lack of feral goats. They are found at lower elevations than on Guadalupe, at around , on the windward ridges and canyons of the north and central parts of the island. In both cases, the pines seem to be heavily dependent on locations with a high frequency of fog.

In Australia, New Zealand, and Spain it is the leading introduced tree and in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Kenya, and South Africa it is a major plantation species. It is also an introduced tree on the world&#x27;s most remote inhabited island, Tristan da Cunha.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Subdivisions ===
Two varieties of this species have been recognized, each corresponding to the island they are endemic to in Baja California. Some authors lump these taxa and do not recognize infraspecies.

On both islands it is the only pine species, and one of the few tree species. Compared to the mainland species, which are mostly three-needled, the insular varieties have their needles in bundles of two. Their cones are also smaller, and they show greater wind resistance in regards to wind-induced toppling.

* Pinus radiata var. binata — Commonly known as the Guadalupe Island pine. Endemic to Guadalupe Island.
* Pinus radiata var. cedrosensis — Commonly known as the Cedros Island pine. Endemic to Cedros Island.

==Ecology==

&quot;P. radiata&quot; is adapted to cope with stand-killing fire disturbance. Its cones are serotinous, i.e. they remain closed until opened by the heat of a forest fire; the abundant seeds are then discharged to regenerate on the burned forest floor. The cones may also burst open in hot weather.

In its native range, &quot;P. radiata&quot; is associated with characteristic flora and fauna. It is the co-dominant canopy tree, together with &quot;Cupressus macrocarpa&quot;, which also naturally occurs only in coastal Monterey County. Furthermore, one of the pine forests in Monterey, California, was the discovery site for Hickman&#x27;s potentilla, an endangered species. &quot;Piperia yadonii&quot;, a rare species of orchid, is endemic to the same pine forest adjacent to Pebble Beach. In its native range, &quot;P. radiata&quot; is a principal host for the dwarf mistletoe &quot;Arceuthobium littorum&quot;.

The habitat of the pines on Cedros Island contrasts greatly with the desert scrub on other parts of the island, forming zones of abrupt transition. The numerous groves form a mostly-monotypic forest of the species, with very few other plants besides seedlings emerging in the understory. In some areas, the edges of the forest form a zone that supports chaparral species, including &quot;Malosma laurina&quot;, &quot;Diplacus&quot; &quot;stellatus&quot;, and the endemic &quot;Eriogonum molle&quot;. With their large surfaces to condense fog, the pines create irrigation for themselves and their associates. Towards the far northern end of the island, a succulent community mostly consisting of &quot;Dudleya&quot; is found, and the endemic &quot;Dudleya pachyphytum&quot; can sometimes be found growing under the pines in the ecotone.

A remnant &quot;P. radiata&quot; stand in Pacific Grove, the Monarch Grove Sanctuary, is a prime wintering habitat of the monarch butterfly.

In South Africa, the tree is a threat to already scarce water resources. The tree has remarkable roots. Monterey pine roots will reach downward as far as physically permitted by subterranean conditions. Roots have been discovered up to long. Efforts to remove large quantities of the non-native tree in areas of South Africa have resulted in significant increases in accessible water.

==Conservation status==
===Fungal disease===
The three remaining wild stands of var. &quot;radiata&quot; (Monterey pine proper) are infected and under threat of extirpation from pine pitch canker caused by &quot;Fusarium circinatum&quot;, a fungal disease native to the southeast United States and found (in 1986) to have been introduced to California. When trees begin to die of the disease, they attract bark beetles which provide a pathway for infection of other trees. In some stands, 80–90% of trees are infected. If the disease is introduced in agroforestry areas dependent upon &quot;P. radiata&quot;, such as New Zealand, it could have catastrophic effects in those countries as well.

Sphaeropsis blight (&quot;Diplodia pinea&quot;) infects &quot;P. radiata&quot; in California and causes serious damage to plantations of the species in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, especially after hail damage to growing tips.

===Baja California===

On Guadalupe Island, var. &quot;binata&quot; is critically endangered. Most of the population was destroyed as tens of thousands of feral goats ate &quot;binata&quot; seedlings and caused soil erosion from the mid-19th century until just a few years ago. The older trees gradually died off until by 2001–2002 the population stood at only one hundred. With a program to remove the goats essentially complete by 2005, hundreds of young Guadalupe pines have started to grow up in habitat fenced after 2001, the first significant new growth in about 150 years. Possible accidental introduction of pine pitch canker is considered the biggest threat at present to the survival of the Guadalupe Island pine population. The University of California&#x27;s Russell Reservation forestry research station hosts an orchard planted with 73 &quot;P. radiata&quot; seedlings from Guadalupe Island and plays an important role in conserving the &quot;binata&quot; variety.

==Cultivation==

===Australia===

&quot;P. radiata&quot; was introduced to Australia in the 1870s. It is &quot;the dominant tree species in the Australian plantation estate&quot; – so much so that many Australians are concerned by the resulting loss of native wildlife habitat. The species is widely regarded as an environmental weed across southeastern and southwestern Australia and the removal of individual plants beyond plantations is encouraged. The Kuitpo Forest, south-east of the Adelaide city centre, is a planted forest of Monterey Pine trees. west of the Sydney city centre, there is a forest of introduced Monterey Pine trees in Prospect Hill, in the suburb of Pemulwuy.

===Chile===
&quot;P. radiata&quot; has greatly replaced the Valdivian temperate rain forests, where vast plantations have been planted for timber, again displacing the native forests. In 2001, this species produced 5,580,724 cubic meters of lumber, or 95% of Chile&#x27;s total lumber production. In 2021 1.3 million of Chile&#x27;s 2.3 million ha of forest plantations were planted with &quot;Pinus radiata&quot;.

===New Zealand===
The Monterey pine (always called &quot;Radiata Pine&quot; or &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; in New Zealand) was first introduced into New Zealand in 1859 and today 89% of the country&#x27;s plantation forests are of this species. This includes the Kaingaroa Forest (on the central plateau of the North Island), which is one of the largest planted forests in the world. Mass plantings became common from 1900 in the Rotorua area where prison labour was used. In some areas (particularly areas that were formerly grazed that have had stock removed) it is considered an invasive species (termed a wilding conifer or more commonly wilding pine) where it has escaped from plantations. It is the most extensively used wood in New Zealand.

Use of pine in construction did not become widespread until forced by wartime shortages. It had been used in Southland from about 1920, but doubts were being expressed about it as late as 1945, when at least one MP considered it only suitable for interior studding. Experiments in pressure treatment with water-soluble preservatives were made from 1943.

===Spain===
In the Iberian Peninsula since the nineteenth century they have been introduced mainly in the north area in order to take advantage of their wood for the manufacture of paper pulp and for shoring work in coal mines. It is found in low altitude areas of the Autonomous Communities of Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque Country, and in the north of the Canary Islands. On Tenerife the P. radiata was nearly eradicated by the 2010 cyclone Xynthia.

&quot;P. radiata&quot; forests have a negative effect on local ecology. In its plantations there are usually no other tree species, while its shady undergrowth does not allow the existence of a rich stratum of scrub. 13% of the wood cut annually in Spain comes from this pine.

===United Kingdom===
The cultivar &quot;P. radiata&quot; (Aurea Group) &#x27;Aurea&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===United States===
&quot;P. radiata&quot; is widely used in private gardens and public landscapes in temperate California, and similar climates around the world. It is particularly commonly grown as a landscape tree in coastal areas of California outside of its native range, where the climate is virtually identical to its native range. It is fast-growing and adaptable to a broad range of soil types and climates, though it does not tolerate temperatures below about . Its fast growth makes it ideal for landscapes and forestry; in a good situation, &quot;P. radiata&quot; can reach its full height in 40 years or so. Though a combination of biotic and abiotic factors determines the natural distribution of &quot;P. radiata&quot;, humans have broadly expanded its distribution up and down the California coast, even reaching Oregon.

== Uses ==
As timber &quot;P. radiata&quot; is suitable for a wide variety of uses, and has a resinous fragrance while being worked. It holds screws and nails well and takes paint and stain without difficulty, and modern kiln dried timber is very easy to work. It is about 1/3 heavier than dried western red cedar. It is brittle when bent, so does not have the same load-bearing features as Oregon pine (Douglas fir, &quot;Pseudotsuga&quot;).

&quot;P. radiata&quot; is used in house construction as weatherboards, posts, beams or plywood, in fencing, retaining walls, for concrete formers. It is also used to a limited extent in boat building where untreated ply is sometimes used, but must be encased in epoxy resin to exclude moisture.

The wood is normally kiln dried to 12% moisture in long, clear lengths. It is available treated with a range of chemical salts, or untreated. Chemical salt treatment is well proven and such timber is frequently used in the ground as posts and poles as part of structures such as retaining walls and pole houses. The name applied to this treatment is tanalized wood. H1 and H2 treatment is suited to indoor use. H3 is the standard house timber and this grade is used for fence palings. H4 and H5 are the standard for inground use. In New Zealand, a 1995 change to no longer require borate treatment in house framing timber was a key factor in the leaky homes crisis, but since 2003 a series of changes have now improved the regulations.

Lower grade timber is converted to pulp to make newsprint. Higher grade timber is used in house construction. &quot;P. radiata&quot; is used chipped to make particle board sheets, commonly used in flooring. Other sheet products are hardboard, softboard and ply. Most ply is structural and available in sizes. A small amount of higher grade ply is used to produce thinner () ply suitable for furniture, cabinet work and boat building. This is knot and crack free and glued with resorcinol waterproof glue. Since the 1990s finger jointed joinery-grade wood has become available in up to lengths in a wide range of profiles.

In 1958, New Zealand boat designer Des Townson started building 186 , cold-moulded Zephyr-class dinghies, using &quot;P. radiata&quot;. In 2011 these hand-built boats fetched very high prices and were generally in excellent condition.

The bark is used as a substrate for potting and re-potting orchids.

&quot;P. radiata&quot; is the most common species of Christmas tree in Australia and New Zealand.

In California, &quot;P. radiata&quot; is commonly planted to block wind or noise, or for ornamental reasons.

<text>Jack Tripper is a fictional character on the sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, which is based upon the character Robin Tripp from &quot;Man About the House&quot; created by Brian Cooke and Johnnie Mortimer. Jack was played by the actor John Ritter.

==Introduction==
Janet, another character in the show, reasoned with the landlord, Stanley Roper who lived downstairs and he agreed that Jack could stay because Janet told Mr. Roper that Jack was gay, without Jack&#x27;s knowledge. Jack was, however, actually straight (the comedy stemming from having to &quot;play gay&quot; provided much of the story for the sitcom). Jack is something of a ladies&#x27; man, but is also kind-hearted, loyal, and protective of the women he lives with.

==Jobs==
In the show, Jack attended a local technical college on the G.I. Bill for a degree in culinary arts. He is a Navy veteran. After graduating from cooking school, Jack held down odd jobs in his spare time. He got the chef job in Angelino’s restaurant, and shortly after, Jack got his own restaurant when Angelino rented out his vacant building, instead of turning it into a parking lot. Jack named his new restaurant “Jack&#x27;s Bistro”. His former landlord, Mr. Furley, came up with the name. Jack serves his specialty, which is French cuisine.

<text>The rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) is a medium-sized game bird in the grouse family. It is known simply as the ptarmigan in Europe. It is the official bird for the Canadian territory of Nunavut, where it is known as the &quot;aqiggiq&quot; (ᐊᕿᒡᒋᖅ), and the official game bird for the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. In Japan, it is known as the &quot;raichō&quot; (雷鳥), which means &quot;thunder bird&quot;. It is the official bird of Gifu, Nagano, and Toyama Prefectures and is a protected species nationwide. Unlike many arctic bird species, ptarmigan do not gain substantial mass to hibernate over winter.

==Etymology==
The ptarmigan&#x27;s genus name, &quot;Lagopus&quot;, is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;lagos&quot; (λαγώς &quot;lagṓs&quot;), meaning &quot;hare&quot;, + &quot;pous&quot; (πούς &quot;poús&quot;), &quot;foot&quot;, in reference to the bird&#x27;s feathered legs.

The species name, &quot;muta&quot;, comes from Neo-Latin and means &quot;mute&quot;, referring to the simple croaking song of the male. It was for a long time misspelt &quot;mutus&quot;, in the erroneous belief that the ending of &quot;Lagopus&quot; denotes masculine gender. However, as the Ancient Greek term λαγώπους &quot;lagṓpous&quot; is of feminine gender, and the species name has to agree with that, the feminine &quot;muta&quot; is correct.

The word ptarmigan comes from the Scottish Gaelic &quot;tarmachan&quot;, meaning croaker. The silent initial p was added in 1684 by Robert Sibbald through the influence of Greek, especially &quot;pteron&quot; (πτερόν &quot;pterón&quot;), &quot;wing&quot;, &quot;feather&quot;, or &quot;pinion&quot;.

==Description==
The rock ptarmigan is long with an tail and with a wingspan of and a weight of . It is smaller than the willow ptarmigan by about ten percent.

The rock ptarmigan is seasonally camouflaged; its feathers moult from white in winter to brown in spring or summer. The breeding male has greyish upper parts with white wings and under parts. In winter, its plumage becomes completely white except for the black outer tail feathers and eye line. It can be distinguished from the winter willow ptarmigan by habitat and markings—the rock ptarmigan prefers higher elevations and more barren habitat. It also has a slender bill and a black eye stripe, which is absent in the willow ptarmigan.

== Taxonomy ==
The rock ptarmigan has 23 recognized subspecies:

* &quot;L. m. atkhensis&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. dixoni&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. evermanni&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. gerasimov&quot;i 
* &quot;L. m. helvetica&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. hyperborea&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. islandorum&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. japonica&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. kurilensis&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. macruros&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. millaisi&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. muta&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. nadezdae&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. nelsoni&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. pleskei&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. pyrenaica&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. reinhardi&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. ridgwayi&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. rupestris&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. saturata&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. townsendi&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. welchi&quot; 
* &quot;L. m. yunaskensis&quot; 

== Sounds and displays ==
Male rock ptarmigans emit a repertoire of guttural snores and rattles, most often directed to other males during breeding season. On open leks, single or multiple males also carry out displays on the ground and in the air to assert their territory, including chasing other males while flying.

Aerial courtship rituals involve fast forward flight with rapidly-beating wings followed by an upward glide, tail fanned out. The male, at the peak of the display, belts out a rasping &quot;ah-AAH-ah-AAAAH-a-a-a-a-a-a!&quot;, with the sung latter part coinciding with a gliding descent afterwards. The sound is often described as that of a stick being pulled rapidly across the slats of a picket fence. 

On the ground, male ptarmigans defend their space by calling and giving chase to other males. Physical conflicts between territorial males rarely occur, while confrontations between the former toward subordinate males are intensified. Other signals via fanning their tails, extended necks, lowered wings and circling a receptive female are also utilized.

==Distribution and habitat==
The rock ptarmigan is a sedentary species which breeds across Arctic and Subarctic Eurasia and North America (including Greenland) on rocky mountainsides and tundra. It is widespread in the Arctic Cordillera and is found in isolated populations in the mountains of Norway, Sweden, Scotland, the Pyrenees, the Alps, Bulgaria, the Urals, the Pamir Mountains, the Altay Mountains, and Japan—where it occurs only in the Japanese Alps and on Mount Haku. Because of the remote habitat in which it lives, it has only a few predators—such as golden eagles—and it can be surprisingly approachable. It has been introduced to New Zealand, South Georgia, the Kerguelen Islands, and the Crozet Islands.

The small population living on Franz Josef Land in the Russian High Arctic overwinters during the polar night and survives by feeding on rich vegetation on and underneath high cliffs where seabird colonies are located in summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;FJL/&quot;&gt;Dinets, V. (2001) Winter ecology of Willow Ptarmigan &quot;Lagopus lagopus&quot; and Rock Ptarmigan &quot;L. mutus&quot; at the northern limit of their range. &quot;Ornitologia&quot; 29: 326–327 (in Russian with English summary).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last ice age, the species was far more widespread in continental Europe.

==Ecology==

=== Feeding ===
Food sources can vary tremendously depending on the region of their distribution. In Alaska, rock ptarmigans consume aspen buds, dwarf birch and willow buds and catkins as a staple winter diet. They transition their diets over to crowberries and lingonberry shrubs during the spring. The greatest variety in its diet occurs during early summer, when it feeds on willow leaves, as well as the leaves and flowers of &quot;Dryas&quot; and locoweed. It also feeds on berries, bistort seeds, and birch buds from late summer to autumn. Insects, larvae and snails are eaten by chicks.

=== Breeding ===
Apart from the red eye combs, male rock ptarmigans have no &#x27;distinct&#x27; plumage (other than the black eye stripe) that are more typical for other grouse in temperate regions. Studies on other grouses have shown that much variation in comb size and colour exists between the species, and that the comb is used in courtship display and aggressive interactions between males. Many studies have shown that there is a strong correlation between the comb size and the level of testosterone in males; one report from 1981 showed that the amount of testosterone is correlated to aggressiveness against other males.

The male&#x27;s comb has been the focus of studies regarding sexual selection. Studies of a population of male rock ptarmigans in Scarpa Lake, Nunavut, have shown that during the first year, mating success among males was influenced by comb size and condition, and bigamous males had larger combs than monogamous males. The correlation to size disappeared after the first year, but the correlation to comb condition remained. This is consistent with another study of the same population of &quot;L. muta&quot; that showed that mating success overall is correlated to comb condition. Exceptions were first-time breeders, in which the size of the comb influenced mating success.

The rock ptarmigan becomes sexually mature at six months of age and commonly has up to six chicks. Because of this high breeding rate, the size of the population is affected very little by factors such as hunting.

== Ecophysiology ==

=== Energy storage and assimilation ===
Rock ptarmigan have a limited capacity for fat storage, which requires overwintering birds to forage frequently. Most of the minuscule mass gained over winter is to the ovary, oviduct and hypertrophy, in preparation for the spring breeding season. Rock ptarmigan maximize assimilation of nutrient poor foods with their elongated ceca. Metabolic requirements can be partially supplemented by fermentation, the energy gain from fermentation alone, however, is not independently significant.

The Svalbard subspecies of rock ptarmigan is the only subspecies that exhibits a significant seasonal mass gain. Larger fat deposits can help them survive during periods of low food availability. However, this alone is not an adequate source of energy to survive during winter. Additional stored fat does not appear to increase the energetic cost in these birds&#x27; locomotion. This adaptation is key for a species that must move frequently to forage. Fat assimilation in these birds is correlated to changes in liver weight. Most rock ptarmigan have no more than 20 grams of adipose tissue year round. Without food, these reserves can supplement energy for 2 days. The Svalbard rock ptarmigan, however, gains about 100 grams of adipose tissue. This can serve as an energy source for up to 10 days of starvation.

The Svalbard subspecies inhabits the northern extent of the rock ptarmigans range. During winter, food availability is lower in Svalbard than in other parts of their range, which accounts for the necessary increased fat reserves not found in other sub populations.

==In culture==
Rock ptarmigan meat is a popular part of festive meals in Icelandic cuisine. Hunting of rock ptarmigans was banned in Iceland in 2003 and 2004 due to its declining population. Hunting has been allowed again since 2005, but is restricted to selected days, which are revised yearly and all trade of rock ptarmigan is illegal.

In Thomas Bewick&#x27;s &quot;A History of British Birds&quot; (1797) the species is named as &quot;White Grouse&quot; with alternatives &quot;White Game, or Ptarmigan&quot;. The birds feed, records Bewick, &quot;on the wild productions of the hills, which sometimes give the flesh a bitter, but not unpalatable taste: it is dark coloured, and has somewhat the flavour of the hare.&quot;

=== Provincial bird ===
The rock ptarmigan is the official territorial bird of Nunavut, Canada. Its Inuktitut name is &quot;ᐊᕐᑭᒡᒋᖅ ᐊᑕᔪᓕᒃ, aqiggiq atajulik.&quot; It is the official game bird of Newfoundland and Labrador.

<doc id="320937" wikidata="Q1140504" url="?curid=320937" title="Wadō-ryū">
<text>is one of the four major karate styles and was founded by Hironori Ōtsuka (1892–1982). Ōtsuka was a Menkyo Kaiden licensed Shindō Yōshin-ryū practitioner of Tatsusaburo Nakayama and a student of Yōshin-ryū prior to meeting the Okinawan karate master Gichin Funakoshi. After having learned from Funakoshi, and after their split, with Okinawan masters such as Kenwa Mabuni and Motobu Chōki, Ōtsuka merged Shindō Yōshin-ryū with Okinawan karate. The result of Ōtsuka&#x27;s efforts is Wadō-ryū Karate.

As such, Wadō-ryū places emphasis on not only striking, but &quot;tai sabaki&quot;, joint locks and throws. It has its origins within Shindō Yōshin-ryū jujitsu, as well as Shotokan, Tomari-te and Shito-Ryu karate.
== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Wadō-ryū&quot; has three parts: &quot;Wa&quot;, &quot;dō&quot;, and &quot;ryū&quot;. &quot;Wa&quot; means &quot;harmony,&quot; &quot;dō&quot; (same character as tao) means &quot;way,&quot; and &quot;ryū&quot; means &quot;school&quot; or &quot;style&quot;. Harmony should not be interpreted as pacifism; it is simply the acknowledgment that yielding is sometimes more effective than brute strength, which founds the art&#x27;s mentality in fighting. Additionally, Kanji &quot;Wa&quot; (和) used is also a Kanji for Japan, due to the influence of Japanese Jujutsu in Wadō-Ryū, meant in contrast to the other karate styles originating from Okinawa.

==Characteristics==
To the untrained observer, Wadō-ryū might look similar to other styles of karate, like its parent school of Shotokan. Most of the underlying principles, however, were derived from Shindō Yōshin-ryū, an atemi waza focused style of Jujutsu. Indeed, from one point of view, Wadō-ryū might be considered a style of Jūjutsu rather than Karate. Hironori Ōtsuka embraced jujitsu and was its chief instructor for a time. When Ōtsuka first registered his school with the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai in 1938, the style was called &quot;Shinshu Wadō-ryū Karate-Jūjutsu,&quot; a name that reflects its hybrid character. 

Additionally, there are noticeable differences in the katas compared to other styles such as Shōtōkan. Wadō-Ryū katas have a lighter, less powerful appearance and are economical in movement. Defensive techniques do not block an opponent’s attack, but rather redirect it.

===Technique===
Similar to Shotokan Karate, Wadō-ryū employs linear striking, but forgoes with Shotokan&#x27;s aggressive approach. Instead, Wadō-ryū opts &quot;tai sabaki&quot; (often incorrectly referred to as &#x27;evasion&#x27;) as its key principle. The Japanese term can be translated as &quot;body-management,&quot; and refers to body manipulation so as to move the defender as well as the attacker out of harm&#x27;s way. The way to achieve this is to &#x27;move along&#x27; rather than to &#x27;move against&#x27;—or harmony rather than physical strength. Using these principles, the energy of the attack is diverted and evaded, and then or simultaneously countered with joint-locking, throwing, or striking techniques. The technical execution is subject to the following principles:
* Sanmi Ittai – Every technique in Wadō-Ryū (Ten gi) simultaneously includes a change in position (Ten i) and a shift in the weight of the body (Ten tai).
* Execution of all movements while avoiding the following errors: No incorrect or superfluous technique, no superfluous movement, no superfluous expenditure of force.
* Control of your own center of gravity.
* Tai Sabaki – Leaving the line of attack by dodging.
* Defending against an attack and countering occur simultaneously, as well as doing so without hesitation.
* Kyusho – Techniques are aimed at the attacker’s vital points.
* Smooth transitions between the individual techniques.

Wadō-ryū is also characterised by a higher body position and stances than in other Karate styles.

Modern karate competition tends to transform Wadō-ryū away from its roots towards a new generic karate that appeals more to the demands of both spectators and competitors.

A block in Wadō may look much like a block in Goju/Uechi ryu, but they are executed from different perspectives.

While the core principles (at least with regard to the transmission of body mass into punches) of turning on the heel remain in Wadō, as it is the fastest way to push the hips in the direction of attack, the progression to the ball of the foot is a hallmark of the style.

===Kata===
&quot;Kata&quot; are predefined, specific patterns of movement that incorporate and encapsulate martial techniques, concepts, and applications. 
Wadō-Ryū takes a different approach to kata training than other styles. Ōtsuka Hironori adopted the katas from Gichin Funakoshi, but used a different kanji for the term kata. In Wadō-Ryū, he replaced the meaning of original mold or template (Japanese 型) of the kata in Shōtōkan with the meaning of symbol (Japanese 形). This means that the practitioner should not always aim for the same form of a kata, but rather allow and even encourage changes to a kata due to the age and other individual characteristics of the karateka. 

In his 1977 book on Wadō-ryū (published in English in 1997), Ōtsuka declared only nine official &quot;kata&quot; for Wadō-ryū: &quot;Pinan Nidan&quot;, &quot;Pinan Shodan&quot;, &quot;Pinan Sandan&quot;, &quot;Pinan Yodan&quot;, &quot;Pinan Godan&quot;, &quot;Kūshankū&quot;, &quot;Naihanchi&quot;, &quot;Seishan&quot; and &quot;Chintō&quot;. However, after his death, other organizations of the style have added other forms, such as unsu and kumpu. However, it can be said that all individual kata originate from Shuri-te.

As such, The exact movements of a &quot;kata&quot; often vary from one organization to another, and even from one school to another within the same organization. The variations can range from significant deviations apparent to the untrained observer to very subtle minutiae.

&quot;Kata&quot; associated with Wadō-ryū include:
* &quot;Ten-No&quot;: basic drills first invented by Gigō Funakoshi (son of Gichin Funakoshi).
* &quot;Taikyoku series&quot;: developed by Gichin Funakoshi as a preliminary exercise before the &quot;Pinan&quot; series; many Wadō-ryū schools teach these basic &quot;kata&quot;, particularly &quot;Taikyoku Shodan&quot; (太極初段).
* &quot;Pinan&quot; kata: created by Ankō Itosu, and consisting of &quot;Pinan Shodan&quot; (平安初段), &quot;Pinan Nidan&quot; (平安二段), &quot;Pinan Sandan&quot; (平安三段), &quot;Pinan Yodan&quot; (平安四段), and &quot;Pinan Godan&quot; (平安五段). Funakoshi renamed this series as the &quot;Heian&quot; series.
* &quot;Kūshankū&quot; クーシャンクー (公相君): &quot;Sky Viewing&quot;. Kūshankū was the Okinawan name for Kwang Shang Fu, a Sapposhi (emissary of China&#x27;s ruling class) sent to Okinawa in the 18th century. This &quot;kata&quot; uses stances and attacks consisting of the five previous &quot;Pinan kata&quot;. No new techniques are introduced. Funakoshi renamed this &quot;kata&quot; as &quot;Kankū Dai&quot;.
* &quot;Naihanchi&quot; ナイハンチ (内畔戦; also known as &quot;Naifanchi&quot;): this was the original name for the three &quot;Tekki kata&quot;, but was changed by Funakoshi. This is a lateral &quot;kata&quot; learned from Chōki Motobu. Wadō-ryū practices only the first Naihanchi &quot;kata&quot;.
* &quot;Seishan&quot; セイシャン (征射雲): the name means &quot;13 hands.&quot; This &quot;kata&quot; was named after a well-known Chinese martial artist who lived in or near Shuri &quot;c.&quot; 1700. The movements are repeated in sets of three, and has pivots and turning of the head. Funakoshi renamed this &quot;kata&quot; as Hangetsu.
* &quot;Chintō&quot; チントウ (鎮闘): formulated by Matsumura Sōkon from the teachings of a sailor or pirate named Chintō (or Annan, depending on the source). Crane stance occurs many times, and the flying kicks differentiate &quot;Chintō&quot; from other &quot;kata&quot;. Funakoshi renamed this &quot;kata&quot; as Gankaku.
* &quot;Bassai&quot; バッサイ (披塞; also known as &quot;Passai&quot;): a Tomari-te &quot;kata&quot; that uses dynamic stances and hip rotation. Funakoshi renamed this &quot;kata&quot; as &quot;Bassai Dai&quot;.
* &quot;Rōhai&quot; ローハイ (老梅): &quot;Rōhai&quot; has three variation invented by Itosu. Wadō-ryū practices &quot;Rōhai Shodan&quot;. Funakoshi renamed this &quot;kata&quot; as Meikyo.
* &quot;Niseishi&quot; ニーセイシ: the name means &quot;24 steps.&quot; Transmitted by Ankichi Aragaki, this &quot;kata&quot; is known in Japanese as Nijūshiho (二十四步).
* &quot;Wanshū&quot; ワンシュウ (晩愁): the name means &quot;flying swallow.&quot; This is a Tomari-te &quot;kata&quot; based on movements brought to Okinawa in 1683 by a Chinese envoy of the same name. The metaphorical name, &quot;Flying Swallows,&quot; comes from the soft blocking sequences near the end of this &quot;kata&quot;. Funakoshi renamed this &quot;kata&quot; as Empi.
* &quot;Jion&quot; ジオン (慈恩): A Tomari-te &quot;kata&quot;; part of the &quot;Jion kata&quot; group.
* &quot;Jitte&quot; ジッテ (十手): another Tomari-te &quot;kata&quot; of the &quot;Jion kata&quot; group; the name means &quot;10 hands.&quot;
* &quot;Suparinpei&quot; スーパーリンペイ (壱百零八拳): known as &quot;108 hands,&quot; representing the 108 evil spirits of man. This &quot;kata&quot; is also said to have represented a band of 108 warriors that travelled the Chinese countryside in the 17th century, performing &#x27;Robin Hood&#x27;-type tasks of doing good deeds, giving to the poor, and so on. It is also known by its Chinese name of Pechurrin, and occasionally referred to as &quot;Haiku Hachi Ho&quot; (a name given by Funakoshi). &quot;Suparinpei&quot; was originally listed as a Wadō-ryū &quot;kata&quot; with the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai by Hironori Ōtsuka, but he eventually discarded it. Some Wadō-ryū instructors and schools still teach this &quot;kata&quot;.
* &quot;Kunpu&quot;
* &quot;Unsū&quot;: the name means &quot;cloud hands&quot;. Advanced kata also found in Shotokan, as well as Shito-Ryu. Its origins are a mystery, and its speculated to have originated from either Dragon-style of Chinese Kung Fu or Arakaki Seishō.

In addition to the solo &quot;kata&quot; listed above, many Wadō-ryū schools also practice paired &quot;kata&quot;, which reflects its jujutsu heritage. These paired &quot;kata&quot; are performed by two people (one as the attacker and one as the defender), demonstrating a range of self-defense techniques. The paired &quot;kata&quot; of Wadō-ryū often vary from one organisation from another, because Ōtsuka did not standardise them. The paired &quot;kata&quot; are:
* &quot;Yakusoku Kihon Kumite&quot;: consists of 10 fundamental techniques of attack against combination attacks (combinations of kicks and punches), influenced by jujutsu body movements.
* &quot;Kumite Gata&quot;: consists of 10 – 24 varietal techniques (depending on the organisation) of attack emphasizing Katamae (pinning) and Kuzushi (breaking balance) and multiple strikes.
* &quot;Ohyo Kumite&quot;: consists of various techniques of attack, incorporating Karate blocks, kicks and strikes with jujutsu throws and body movements. This is a specialty of Tatsuo Suzuki Hanshi&#x27;s W.I.K.F organisation.
* &quot;Idori no Kata&quot;: consists of 5–10 techniques (depending on the organisation) of seated self-defense, influenced by jujutsu throwing and joint-locking techniques.
* &quot;Tantodori no Kata&quot;: consists of 7–10 techniques (depending on the organisation) of defenses against knife attacks, influenced by jujutsu body movements, throwing, and joint-locking techniques.
* &quot;Shinken Shirahadori&quot; (): consists of 5–10 (depending on organisation) techniques of defenses against sword attacks, influenced by jujutsu body movements, throwing, and joint-locking techniques.

In addition to the three paired &quot;kata&quot; above, there are also &quot;Gyakunage Kata&quot; (&quot;kata&quot; of throwing), &quot;Joshi Goshinjutsu&quot; (&quot;kata&quot; of women&#x27;s self-defense), &quot;Kodokan Goshin Jutsu&quot; &amp; some others, but they are not commonly taught.

==Ranks==
Wadō-ryū uses a typical karate belt order to denote rank. The beginner commences at 9th or 10th &quot;kyū&quot; (depending on the organisation and school) and progresses to 1st &quot;kyū&quot;, then from 1st–5th &quot;dan&quot; for technical grades. The ranks of 6th–10th &quot;dan&quot; are honorary ranks. Although some other karate styles add stripes to their belt for the &quot;dan&quot; ranks, Wado-ryū practitioners tend not to follow that practice.

The rank at which Wado practitioners are first able to teach is usually 3rd &quot;dan&quot;, but this depends on the organisation. Some Wado ryu organisations require completion of a special course in addition to attaining a certain &quot;dan&quot; rank.

Schools that use the same belt colour for multiple &quot;kyu&quot; ranks typically, although not necessarily, use stripes to indicate progress within that belt colour.

==History==

The founder of Wadō-ryū, Hironori Ōtsuka, was born on 1 June 1892 in Shimodate, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. In 1898, Ōtsuka began practicing &quot;koryū jujutsu&quot; under Chojiro Ebashi. From 1905–1921, he studied Shindō Yōshin-ryū jujutsu under Tatsusaburo Nakayama. In 1922, he met Gichin Funakoshi and began to train under him. In 1924, Ōtsuka became one of the first students promoted to black belt in karate by Funakoshi. To broaden his knowledge of Karate, Ōtsuka also studied with other prominent masters such as Kenwa Mabuni of Shitō-ryū and Motobu Chōki. 

By 1927, Ōtsuka had become an assistant instructor in Funakoshi&#x27;s Shotokan school. In 1929, Ōtsuka organised the first school karate club at Tokyo University. Eiichi Eriguchi coined the term &#x27;Wadō-ryū&#x27; in 1934.

In 1938, Ōtsuka registered his style of karate with the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai under the name of &quot;Shinshu Wadoryu Karate-Jujutsu.&quot; Soon after, however, this was shortened to &quot;Wadō-ryū&quot; (和道流). In 1938, the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai awarded Ōtsuka the rank of &quot;Renshi-Go&quot;, followed in 1942 by the rank of &quot;Kyoshi-Go&quot;. It was around this time that Tatsuo Suzuki, founder of the WIKF, began training in Wadō-ryū. In 1944, Ōtsuka was appointed Japan&#x27;s Chief Karate Instructor. In 1946, Ōtsuka awarded Tatsuo Suzuki the rank of 2nd &quot;dan&quot;.

Around 1950, Jiro Ōtsuka (the founder&#x27;s second son) began training in Wadō-ryū while in his adolescent years. In 1951, Ōtsuka awarded Tatsuo Suzuki the rank of 5th &quot;dan&quot;, the highest rank awarded in Wadō-ryū at that time. In 1952, the Wadō-ryū headquarters (&quot;honbu&quot;) was established at the Meiji University dojo in Tokyo. In 1954, its name was changed to &quot;Zen Nippon Karate Renmei&quot; (All Japan Karate Federation). In 1955, Ōtsuka published &quot;Karatejutsu no Kenkyu,&quot; a book expounding his style of karate. In 1963, he dispatched Suzuki, along with Toru Arakawa and Hajimu Takashima, to spread Wadō-ryū around the world.

In 1964, the Japan Karate Federation (JKF) was established as a general organisation for all karate styles. Wadō-ryū joined this organisation as a major group. In 1965, Ōtsuka and Yoshiaki Ajari recorded onto film (which is now still available on two video tapes) much of the legacy of Wadō-ryū karate. The first video, &quot;Wadō-ryū Karate Volume 1,&quot; consists of: in-depth history and recollections; demonstrations of the eight &quot;Kihon No Tsuki&quot; body shifts; the first five &quot;Kihon-Kumite&quot;; and the &quot;kata&quot; &quot;Pinan&quot; 1–5, &quot;Kūshankū&quot;, &quot;Jion&quot;, &quot;Naihanchi&quot;, and &quot;Seishan&quot;. The second video, &quot;Wadō-ryū Karate Volume 2,&quot; consists of: more history; the &quot;kata&quot; &quot;Chintō&quot;, &quot;Niseishi&quot;, &quot;Rōhai&quot;, &quot;Wanshu&quot;, and &quot;Jitte&quot;; as well as &quot;Kihon-Kumite&quot; 6–10, along with application. In 1966, Ōtsuka was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Fifth Class by Emperor Hirohito for his dedication to the introduction and teaching of karate. On 5 June 1967, the Wadō-ryū organisation changed its name to &quot;Wadōkai.&quot;

In 1972, the President of Kokusai Budō Renmei, a member of the Japanese royal family, awarded Ōtsuka the title of &quot;Meijin&quot;. In 1975, Suzuki received his 8th &quot;dan&quot;, the highest grade ever given (at the time) by the Federation of All Japan Karate-dō Organisations, and was named &quot;Hanshi-Go&quot; by the uncle of Emperor Higashikuni.

In 1980, as the result of a conflict between Ōtsuka and the Wadōkai organisation over personal withdrawals from the organisation&#x27;s bank accounts, he stepped down as head of the Wadōkai. Eiichi Eriguchi took over his place within that organisation. On 1 April 1981, Ōtsuka founded the &quot;Wadōryū Karatedō Renmei.&quot; (&quot;Renmei&quot; means &quot;group&quot; or &quot;federation.&quot;) After only a few months, he retired as head of this organisation. His son, Jiro Ōtsuka, took his place. On 29 January 1982, Hironori Ōtsuka died, and in 1983, Jiro Ōtsuka succeeded him as grandmaster of Wadō-ryū. The younger Ōtsuka changed his name to &quot;Hironori Otsuka II&quot; in honor of his late father. In 1989, Tatsuo Suzuki founded the third major Wadō-ryū organisation, &quot;Wadō Kokusai&quot; (Wadō International Karatedō Federation; WIKF). (&quot;Kokusai&quot; means &quot;international.&quot;) In 2011 following Suzuki&#x27;s death, Jon Wicks succeeded as the WIKF chief instructor. In 2015 following Jiro&#x27;s death, his son Kazutaka succeeded him as grandmaster of Wadō-ryū, assuming the name &quot;Hironori Otsuka III&quot;.

==Organisation==
Wadō-ryū is spread between three independently-led organisations: Wadōkai, Wadō Kokusai and Wadō-ryū Karate-dō Renmei.

===Wadō-ryū outside Japan===
Wadō-ryū has been spread to many countries in the world, by both Japanese and non-Japanese students of Hironori Otsuka. Japanese Wadō-ryū stylists Tatsuo Suzuki, Teruo Kono, Masafumi Shiomitsu, H. Takashima, Naoki Ishikawa, Yoshihiko Iwasaki, Kuniaki Sakagami and many others spread the art in Europe. Yoshiaki Ajari, Masaru Shintani and Isaac Henry Jr. spread the art in the United States and Canada, Joaquim Gonçalves (from Portugal) and many others have helped to spread the style in their respective countries. In 1968, Otsuka promoted Cecil T. Patterson of the United States to 5th &quot;dan&quot;, and charged him with the creation of the United States Eastern Wado-Kai Federation (USEWF). 

Following the split between Otsuka and the Wado-Kai in 1980, Patterson and the USEWF (renamed: United States Eastern Wadō-ryū Karate Federation) remained with Otsuka. Following Patterson&#x27;s death in 2002, his son John T. Patterson assumed the presidency of the USEWF. Patterson&#x27;s organisation continues as an active member of the Wadō Ryū Karatedō Renmei. In the UK, Wadō-ryū has been cited as a key influence in the development of the hybrid martial art Sanjuro.

<text>William Hilton Hovell (26 April 1786 – 9 November 1875) was an English explorer of Australia. With Hamilton Hume, he made an 1824 overland expedition from Sydney to Port Phillip (near the site of present-day Melbourne), and later explored the area around Western Port.

==Early life==
Hovell was born in Yarmouth, Norfolk, England. His father was captain and part owner of a vessel trading to the Mediterranean, which, during a voyage in 1794, was captured by the French and taken into a port, where he became a prisoner of war for two years. William, when only 10 years of age, went to sea to earn his living. After going through the hard life of a foremast hand, at 20 years of age he was mate of &quot;Zenobia&quot; bound to Peru, and two years later he was a mercantile marine captain of the &quot;Juno&quot; bound to Rio Janeiro, and others. He decided to come to Australia, arriving at Sydney New South Wales by the ship &quot;Earl Spencer&quot;, with his wife Esther &quot;née&quot; Arndell (daughter of the surgeon Thomas Arndell), and two children, a boy and a girl, on 9 October 1813. Making an association with Simeon Lord, Hovell became master of a vessel and made several trading voyages along the east coast of Australia coast and to New Zealand.

In June 1816, while in command of &quot;The Brothers&quot; he was shipwrecked in the Kent Group, Bass Strait, and along with his crew of eight survived for 10 weeks on the wheat from their cargo that was washed up, before being rescued by the &quot;Spring&quot;. In 1819 he settled on the land near Sydney and did some exploring in a southerly direction; he reached the Burragorang Valley in 1823.

==Explorer==
In 1824 Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane asked Hovell to join with Hamilton Hume to undertake the exploration of what is now southern New South Wales and Victoria in an attempt to obtain more information about any rivers that might run south in the direction of Spencer Gulf. Hovell had little bush experience, but had great experience as a navigator.

The planned official expedition did not eventuate, and Hume and Hovell decided to make the journey at their own expense. Some pack-saddles, clothes, blankets and arms were provided from the government stores. The explorers left on 3 October 1824 with six men. They reached Hume&#x27;s station on 13 October, and on 17 October began the expedition proper with five bullocks, three horses and two carts. On 22 October they found that the only way to pass the Murrumbidgee River, then in flood, was to convert one of the carts into a type of boat by passing a tarpaulin under it; the men, horses, and bullocks swam over, and everything successfully got across. A day or two later, in broken hilly country full of water-courses, they had great difficulty in finding a road for the loaded carts, deciding on 27 October to abandon them. Until 16 November their course lay through difficult mountainous country. On that day they came to a large river which Hovell called Hume&#x27;s River &quot;he being the first that saw it&quot;. This was an upper reach of the Murray River so named by Charles Sturt a few years later. It was impossible to cross here, but after a few days a better place was found, and constructing the rough frame of a boat, they managed to get across. By 3 December they had reached the Goulburn River, which they were able to cross without a boat.

Four days later impassable country was reached. The party spent three days attempting to cross the Great Dividing Range at Mt Disappointment but were thwarted. Hume shifted direction to the West then reached lower land at the future township of Broadford on the 12 December where they camped.
Hume headed towards low ranges to the South and found a pass in that direction next day. He led the party across the Dividing Range at Hume’s Pass, Wandong and on the 16th December, 1824 reached Port Phillip Bay at Bird Rock, Point Lillias adjacent to the future Geelong.
Hovell claimed that he measured their longitude on the same day but in reality he read it off the sketch map that they had drafted themselves during the trip.
Hovell admitted in 1867 that he did not take any longitude measurements and blamed Hume for it.
Prior to this admission, Dr William Bland, who wrote the first book on the journey in 1831, invented the myth that Hovell made an error of one degree in longitude in order to protect him.
The party turned back towards New South Wales on the 18 December. Hume chose to travel more to the west to avoid the mountainous country and save considerable time. This was a sound decision. On 16 January 1825, just as their flour ran out, they reached the carts they had left behind them, and then two days later the safety of Hume&#x27;s station at Gunning.

On 25 March 1825 Governor Brisbane mentioned the discoveries of Hovell and Hume in a dispatch and said that he intended to send a vessel to Western Port to have it explored. However, nothing was done until his successor, Governor Darling, towards the end of 1826, sent an expedition under Captain Wright to Western Port. Hovell was attached to this expedition, and when it arrived he saw that it was not the region that he had reached on his first trip. Hovell explored and reported on the land surrounding Western Port and to the north of it, and near the coast to the east at Cape Paterson he discovered &quot;great quantities of very fine coal&quot;. This was the first discovery of coal in Victoria. Hovell was away five months on this expedition and afterwards did no more exploring. He made various efforts during the next 10 years to obtain some special recognition from the government in addition to the grants of for the journey with Hume, and for the journey to Western Port, &quot;subject to restrictions and encumbrances so depreciatory of its value, as to render it a very inadequate remuneration&quot;. He appears to have had no success, but prospered on his pastoral run at Goulburn, where he lived for the rest of his life. He died on 9 November 1875, and in 1877 his widow left the substantial sum of £6000 to the University of Sydney as a memorial of him, which was used to found the William Hilton Hovell lectureship on geology and physical geography.

==Late life==
In 1854 ill-feeling arose between Hume and Hovell which led to each write public documents with contradicting claims on the conduct of their expedition. In December 1853 Hovell had been entertained at a public dinner in Geelong to celebrate the 29th anniversary of the discovery of the district. Reports reached Hume that Hovell was credited for the discovery of Geelong. The fullest report of Hovell&#x27;s speech available does not justify Hume&#x27;s contention.

Hovell died in Sydney on 9 November 1875 and was buried at Goulburn, survived by a son.

<doc id="320941" wikidata="Q277864" url="?curid=320941" title="Hume and Hovell expedition">
<text>The Hume and Hovell expedition was a journey of exploration undertaken in eastern Australia. In 1824 the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Thomas Brisbane, commissioned Hamilton Hume and former Royal Navy Captain William Hovell to lead an expedition to find new grazing land in the south of the colony, and also to find an answer to the mystery of where New South Wales&#x27;s western rivers flowed.

Surveyor General John Oxley asserted that no river could fall into the sea between Cape Otway and Spencer&#x27;s Gulf, and that the country south of parallel of 34 degrees was &#x27; uninhabitable and useless for all purposes of civilised men,&#x27; and for the time exploration in this direction was greatly discouraged. In 1824, newly appointed Sir Thomas Brisbane, who disbelieved this statement, offered to land a party of prisoners near Wilson&#x27;s Promontory and grant them a free pardon, as well as a grant of land, to those who found their way overland to Sydney.

Alexander Berry recommended the Governor to secure the services of Hume to lead the exploring party. Hume declined to undertake that task but instead offered, if supplied with men and horses, to go from Lake George to Bass Straits. This was not carried out. But shortly afterwards Hume and W. H. Hovell, of Minto, agreed together to undertake an expedition in that direction. They found men and horses and bullocks; the Government furnished them with pack saddles, tarpaulins, tent, arms, ammunition, and skeleton charts.

==Departure==

On 2 October 1824, Hovell and Hume met at Hume&#x27;s house in Appin, and started upon their expedition. The party, when complete, consisted of eight people, Hume and his three men, Claude Bossowa, Henry Angel, and James Fitzpatrick. As well as Hovell and his three men, Thomas Boyd, William Bollard, and Thomas Smith.

They reached Hume&#x27;s station near &#x27;Lake George&#x27; on the 13th. In those times, &#x27;Lake George&#x27; also referred to the district, and Hume&#x27;s station, Wooloobidallah—later called Collingwood Station—was closer to modern-day Gunning than to the lake. However, some of the party did make an excursion to the lake. On the 14th, &quot;Hume and Hovell, with two of the men, proceed to Lake George, in order to ascertain the bearings and distance of the Lake from Hume&#x27;s station&quot;. They returned to Hume&#x27;s station at dusk. They started their journey on the 17th. On the 18th, they camped near the site of Hume&#x27;s later residence, Cooma Cottage. On the 19th they passed Yarrh – or as they are now called Yass Plains.

Their first great difficulty was in crossing the Murrumbidgee which was in full flood at the time. The timber growing on the banks of this river was too heavy to float, so Hume resolved to make a raft of the body of one of their carts. Hume and Hovell&#x27;s man Boyd, swam across the river first, with a small rope between their teeth, to which was attached a line long enough to reach across the river. It was a work of peril, as the current was strong. But they succeeded, and then, with much labour, got the whole party, with baggage and cattle, safely over.

On 24 October they came up to what seemed an impenetrable mountain barrier. There was an argument between the leaders concerning the best route to take which resulted in the party splitting up. The equipment was divided, and they prepared to cut their one tent in halves. Hume and Hovell fought bitterly over the frying-pan, which broke in their hands. One of them taking the handle, the other the pan itself. Later, however, Hovell rejoined Hume when he found he had made a mistake.

Hume, with two men, following a chain of ponds, came to a chasm through which the whole party afterwards descended. On the 31st they found themselves on the western edge of the tableland. The descent was not accomplished without much difficulty. On 6 November, they came in sight of the snow-covered Australian Alps. They came after this upon a very rich country, abounding in kangaroos and other animals, with frequent tracks of aborigines; and on Tuesday, 16 November, they arrived suddenly on the banks of a &quot;fine river&quot;.

Hume was the first to see the river, near the site of Albury and named it the &quot;Hume&quot;, (now the Murray River) after his father. This river, where they first came upon it, is about 50m in breadth, and of considerable depth. The current was about three miles an hour, and the water clear.

They improvised a tarpaulin covered wicker boat and they were able to eventually cross and continue into what is now known as Victoria.

They proceeded south crossing the Ovens River and Goulburn River by a route further to the east of the Hume Highway and closer to the foothills of Mount Buffalo.

==Crossing the Great Divide==
Four days after crossing the Goulburn River, impassable country was reached. The party spent three days attempting to cross the Great Dividing Range at Mt Disappointment but were thwarted. Hume shifted direction to the west and, on the 12 December, reached less hilly country at the future township of Broadford, where they camped.

Hume headed towards similarly low ranges to the south and found a pass in that direction next day. He led the party across the Dividing Range at Hume’s Pass, Wandong, and, on 16 December 1824, reached Corio Bay, an arm of Port Phillip Bay, at Bird Rock, Point Lillias, north of the future site of Geelong.

Hovell left incontrovertible surveying proof of the Geelong location when he took a bearing of N10W (350 degrees) from there to Mt Flinders (Mt Wollstonecraft, You Yangs), at a distance of 8 miles, and wrote it in his diary that still exists. 

Hovell claimed that he had measured their longitude on the same day but, in reality, he had read it off the sketch map that they had drafted themselves during the trip. In 1867, Hovell admitted that he did not take any longitude measurements and blamed Hume for it. 

Prior to that admission, Dr William Bland, who wrote the first book on the journey in 1831, invented the myth that Hovell made an error of one degree in longitude in order to protect the explorer. It was not the only myth emanating from the pen of Bland. From 1825, Hume wrote on four occasions that he had reached Western Port, his original destination. That was repeated in nine newspaper articles by Bland. It was not until 1827, when it was demonstrated by Hovell that the journey had ended near Geelong, that the pair changed their stories to identify that location.

On 18 December, the party turned back towards New South Wales. Hume chose to travel more to the west to avoid the mountainous country and save considerable time. It was a sound decision because, on 16 January 1825, just as their flour ran out, they reached the carts they had left behind. Two days later, they arrived at Hume&#x27;s station at Gunning.

On 18 November 1826, based on the discoveries of Hume and Hovell, Colonel Stewart, Captain S. Wright, and Lieutenant Burchell were sent in (Captain Wetherall), with the brigs &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Amity&quot;, under orders to proceed to Western Port and establish a colony there. They took a number of convicts and a small force of troops from the 3rd and 93rd regiments. Hovell was sent with the party as guide. While exploring Western Port, it became apparent to Hovell that he had not reached it on his earlier trip.

Both Hovell and Hume were publicly rebuked for their error in incorrectly identifying Western Port. They had become implicated by association with the wasted expense of setting up a new settlement there, based upon their fulsome recommendations of the value of the region. 

==Return to Sydney==

Relations between the &quot;currency lad&quot; (first-generation Australian) Hume and the aloof Englishman Hovell had deteriorated, and they raced each other back to Sydney to claim credit for their discoveries. They arrived in January, 1825, and were both rewarded with large land grants by Governor Brisbane. They later published conflicting accounts of the journey, each claiming leadership.

The Hume and Hovell expedition disproved the widely held view that the interior of Australia was an uninhabitable wilderness. They found abundant well-watered grazing land between the Murrumbidgee and the Murray, on the huge fertile coastal plains around Port Phillip, and then on the plains across North Eastern Victoria all the way to the Murray River during their return journey. It took another thirteen years for settlers from New South Wales to follow their route in 1837, and only after the richness of the territory was confirmed by Sir Thomas Mitchell in 1836. Some parts of their route formed the Hume Highway from Sydney to Melbourne via Albury.

==The route==
==Monuments==
Within the Greater Melbourne area, monuments commemorating the route of the Hume and Hovell expedition can be found at Beveridge, Greenvale, St. Albans, Werribee and Lara. There are also monuments in other locations in north-eastern Victoria and southern New South Wales.

===Beveridge, Victoria===
This Beveridge Monument and interpretive panel was built in 1999, at the foot of Mount Fraser, to mark the location from which Hume &amp; Hovell first sighted the sea. 
The original monument, erected in 1924, is on private land nearby.

<doc id="320945" wikidata="Q1122304" url="?curid=320945" title="Kurtus">
<text>Kurtus is a genus of percomorph fishes, called the nurseryfishes, forehead brooders, or incubator fish, native to fresh, brackish and coastal marine waters ranging from India, through southeast Asia, to New Guinea and northern Australia. &quot;Kurtus&quot; is currently the only known genus in the family Kurtidae, one of two families in the order Kurtiformes. They are famous for carrying their egg clusters on hooks protruding from the forehead (supraoccipital) of the males, although this only has been documented in &quot;K. gulliveri&quot; and available evidence strongly suggests this is not done by &quot;K. indicus&quot; (where the hook likely also is too small to carry embryos). Females do not have a hook.

In addition to the egg hook, the kurtid gas bladder is enclosed in a tubular bony structure evolved from the ribs. In both species, the back is elevated into a hump shape.

Despite their unusual reproductive habits, little is known about these species. Historically, they have proven very difficult to keep alive in aquaria, although recent success with &quot;K. gulliveri&quot; has been achieved by Tokyo Sea Life Park in Japan.

==Species==
The currently recognized species in this genus are:
* &quot;Kurtus gulliveri&quot; (nurseryfish)
* &quot;Kurtus indicus&quot; (Indian humphead)

<doc id="320947" wikidata="Q370258" url="?curid=320947" title="Junior college">
<text>A junior college is a type of post-secondary institution that offers vocational and academic training that is designed to prepare students for either skilled trades and technical occupations or support roles in professions such as engineering, accountancy, business administration, nursing, medicine, architecture, and criminology. Often times, those types of colleges offer two-year associate&#x27;s degrees that are intended for students that want to later transfer to a college for a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree to finish their undergraduate education, pending adequate grades. Students typically attend those types of colleges for one to three years, which is also dependent on the country.

==By country==

=== Pakistan ===

In Pakistan, after the completion of Secondary School Certificate, students who want to further pursue their education, the mst apply for the junior college, which is also called as intermediate college. They can choose either of the three groups out of science, arts (or humanities) or commerce. They attend the college for 2 years. Some colleges also offer higher education like undergraduate and graduate degrees like GCUL, FCCU, MAOC etc.

=== Bangladesh ===
In Bangladesh, after completing the tenth-grade board exam (Secondary School Certificate), students attend two years of junior college, named intermediate college. After passing the SSC exam, students can apply for their desired colleges, where they study in three groups, namely Science, Humanities and Commerce, for two years. After that, students sit for Higher Secondary Certificate at the end of their second year in intermediate College.

===Canada===
====Quebec====
===India===
In India, junior colleges are higher secondary educational institutions that offer higher secondary education (Class 11th-12th), similar to Senior Secondary Schools or High Schools. However, unlike schools in India, which typically provide education from Nursery through Class 12th, these institutions are solely focused on higher secondary education (Class 11th-12th). While the majority of national and state boards in India offer continuous schooling from Nursery to Class 12th, some state boards, such as those in Telangana, Maharashtra, Odisha, Assam, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh, have a system where students must apply to junior colleges after completing Class 10th board exams (SSLC/ SSC) to continue their education in Class 11th and 12th. In these states, junior colleges are commonly referred to as Pre-University Colleges (PUC), Intermediate Colleges, or Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) institutions. Additionally, junior colleges are often co-located with Degree Colleges or Secondary Schools.

===Japan===
In Japan after World War II, junior colleges (短期大学) typically provide two-year courses of study but may also provide a three-year course of study. Students who complete the course of study at a junior college are entitled to an associate degree or diploma. 
In Japan before World War II, 
there were three years of national junior colleges (旧制高校). 
*The 1st junior college in Tokyo
* in Sendai
* in Kyoto
* in Kanazawa
*in Kumamoto
* in Okayama
* in Kagoshima
* in Nagoya

===Netherlands===

In the Netherlands, junior college is equivalent to MBO (middle-level vocational education). The MBO lasts one to four years, depending on the level. There are 4 levels offered to students:
*MBO level 1: Assistant training. It lasts 1 year maximum. It is focused on simple executive tasks. If the student graduates, he/she can apply to MBO level 2. 
*MBO level 2: Basic vocational education. The programme lasts 2 to 3 years and is focused on executive tasks.
*MBO level 3: The programme lasts 3 to 4 years. Students are taught to achieve their tasks independently.
*MBO level 4: Middle Management VET. It lasts 3 to 4 years and prepares for jobs with higher responsibility. It also opens the gates to higher education. 
At all levels, MBO offers 2 possible pathways: a school-based education, where training within a company takes between 20 and 59% of the curriculum, or an apprenticeship education, where this training represents more than 60% of the study time. Both paths lead to the same certification. Students in MBO are mostly between 16 and 35. Students of the &quot;apprenticeship&quot; path are overall older (25+). After MBO (4 years), pupils can enroll in HBO (higher professional education) or enter the job market.

===Singapore===

In Singapore, a Junior College (JC) is equivalent to a sixth form college in the United Kingdom. After the GCE &#x27;O&#x27; level examinations in Secondary 4 or 5, students may apply for admission to either a JC or a polytechnic. The two years spent in a JC culminate in a GCE &#x27;A&#x27; level certificate, which is the most common qualification used for university admission.

In the past, secondary schools offered both &#x27;O&#x27; and &#x27;A&#x27; Levels and students in classes studying for the &#x27;A&#x27; Levels were known as the &quot;Pre-University&quot; class. During the 1980s and 1990s, the government began the process of transferring all &#x27;A&#x27; Level courses to centralised JCs. At present, students finish their &#x27;O&#x27; Levels at a secondary school and may choose to take the &#x27;A&#x27; Levels at a JC or as a private candidate.

===South Korea===

In South Korea, junior colleges () typically provide 2-year courses of study but may also provide a 3-year course of study if permitted by presidential decree. Students who complete the course of study at a junior college are entitled to an associate degree or diploma. Junior colleges are also permitted, subject to presidential decree, to offer &quot;advanced major courses&quot; for their students that will lead to a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Junior colleges in South Korea include Yeungjin College and Jeonbuk Science College.

===United Kingdom===
===United States===
In the United States, a junior college is a (usually intermediate) two-year post-secondary school whose main purpose is to provide academic, vocational and professional education. The highest certificate offered by such schools is usually an associate degree, although junior college students may continue their education at a four-year university or college, transferring some or all of the credits earned at the junior college toward the degree requirements of the four-year school.

The term &quot;junior college&quot; historically referred to all pre- or non-bachelor&#x27;s degree (4-year) granting post-secondary schools; however, many public junior colleges, which typically aim to serve a local community, have replaced &quot;junior&quot; with &quot;community&quot; in their names. Thus, most self-identified junior colleges in the United States today are private institutions, although only a small percentage of all two-year institutions are private.

Private junior colleges in the United States reached their peak numbers in the 1940s, and have been declining ever since. In the course of the 20th century, many public and private junior colleges evolved into four-year colleges, in some cases passing through an intermediary period as a four-year junior college; institutions that followed this trajectory include Westminster College in Salt Lake City and Shimer College in Mt. Carmel, Illinois.

====Cultural connotations====
Junior colleges in the United States have long had to contend with a reputation for lower academic standards. The concept can be traced back 100 years to the original public junior college, Joliet Junior College, which was established in a high school as the equivalent of thirteenth and fourteenth grades, to prepare qualified students for the final two years of college. To some extent, this is inherent in the junior college mission of providing practical education to students who for various reasons fall outside the typical profile of a four-year college student (for example, someone who has graduated from high school and spent several years working in a relatively unskilled job). Over the years, such colleges developed a reputation as schools of last resort. According to federal statistics, 42% of public community college freshmen take remedial courses. This does not necessarily affect their future transfer prospects: a junior college graduate with good grades can generally transfer to a four-year school and go on to obtain a full bachelor&#x27;s degree. There is a growing movement of students who are attending junior colleges to save significant sums of money in the first two years of a four-year education.

====Athletics====
Certain junior colleges also serve as incubators for college athletes, particularly in basketball and football; in sports parlance, they are sometimes referred to as &quot;juco&quot;s. A talented player who would not meet the academic standards of a major college program may be able to play for two years in junior college, establishing an academic record in the process, and then transfer to a major college. This process has occasionally resulted in scandals, often involving the academics of the student athletes.

====Military junior college====
In the United States, a military junior college allows cadets to become commissioned officers in the armed forces reserve in two years, instead of the usual four. The students must go on to complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree before serving as regular officers on active duty.

There are currently four military junior colleges:

* Georgia Military College, Milledgeville, Georgia
* Marion Military Institute, Marion, Alabama
* New Mexico Military Institute, Roswell, New Mexico
* Valley Forge Military Academy and College, Wayne, Pennsylvania

<text>The Eurasia Party () is a neo-Eurasianist Russian political party. It was registered by the Ministry of Justice on 21 June 2002, approximately one year after the pan-Russian Eurasia Movement was established by Aleksandr Dugin.

== History and origins ==
Often seen to be a form of National Bolshevism, one of the basic ideas that underpin Eurasian theories is that Moscow, Berlin and Paris form a natural geopolitical axis because a line or axis from Moscow to Berlin will pass through the vicinity of Paris if extended. Dugin and his Eurasia Party foresee an eternal world conflict between land and sea, between the United States and Russia. He believes: &quot;In principle, Eurasia and our space, the heartland (Russia), remain the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, anti-American revolution&quot;. According to Dugin&#x27;s book &quot;The Basics of Geopolitics&quot; (1997): &quot;The new Eurasian empire will be constructed on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of Atlanticism, strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow liberal values to dominate us. This common civilisational impulse will be the basis of a political and strategic union&quot;. The party has been deemed neo-fascist by critics, a label Dugin denies.

The Eurasia Party was founded by Dugin shortly before George W. Bush&#x27;s visit to Russia at the end of May 2002. The party hopes to play a key role in attempts to resolve the Chechen problem, with the objective of setting the stage for Dugin&#x27;s dream of a Russian strategic alliance with European and Middle Eastern states, primarily Iran and states like Germany.

===Eurasia Movement===
The Eurasia Party is affiliated with the Eurasia Movement, a National Bolshevik Russian political movement founded in 2001 by the political scientist Aleksandr Dugin.
The movement follows the neo-Eurasian ideology, which adopts an eclectic mixture of Russian patriotism, Orthodox faith, anti-modernism, and even some Bolshevik ideas. It opposes &quot;American&quot; values such as liberalism, capitalism, and modernism.

Alexander Dugin, an exponent of neo-Eurasianism, initially followed the ideology of National Bolshevism. Expanding out of National Bolshevism, he brought into the existing ideology of Eurasianism the idea of a &quot;third position&quot; (a combination of capitalism and socialism), geopolitics (Eurasia as a tellurocracy, opposing the &quot;Atlantic Anglo-Saxon thalassocracy&quot; of the United States and NATO) and Russian conservatism and Stalinism (the Soviet Union as a major Eurasian power). In Dugin&#x27;s works, Eurasian concepts and provisions are intertwined with the concepts of European New Right. Researchers note that in the formulation of philosophical problems and political projects, he significantly deviates from classical Eurasianism, which is presented in his numerous works very selectively, eclectically. In Dugin&#x27;s version of neo-Eurasianism , the Russian ethnos is considered &quot;the most priority Eurasian ethnos&quot;, which must fulfill the civilizational mission of forming a Eurasian empire that will occupy the entire continent. The main threat is declared by the United States and the English-speaking world in general under a &quot;neo-liberal&quot; ideology he calls &quot;Atlanticism&quot;. His most preferred form of government is a Russian dictatorship and a totalitarian state with complete ideological control over society. In the 1990s, Dugin criticized Italian fascism and German Nazism as &quot;not enough fascist&quot; and accused China of anti-Russian subversion. In subsequent years, he abandoned direct apology for fascism and called for collaboration with China, and began to refer to his positions as being from the traditions of the conservative revolution and National Bolshevism. However, researchers typically refer to neo-Eurasianism (also known Fourth Political Theory and Duginism) as a form of fascism.

==Ideology==
Dugin states that the Eurasia Party is developing the foundations for an entirely new political ideology, the Fourth Political Theory, which integrates and supersedes liberal democracy, Marxism, and fascism. In this theory, the main subject of politics is not individualism, class struggle, or nation, but rather &quot;Dasein&quot; (existence itself). According to Dugin, his aim is to take elements from all three, &#x27;neutralise and decontaminate&#x27; negative aspects such as racism (in the case of fascism) and incorporate them into this new ideology. He refers to this ideology as a &#x27;timeless, non-modern theory&#x27; valid for all time.

Dugin views liberalism as having &#x27;defeated all its competitors&#x27;. He refers to the derision of the past by liberals and the modern concept of &#x27;progress&#x27; as being seriously flawed, going so far as to describe it as racism and even &#x27;moral genocide against the past&#x27;.

From the three other political theories, he discards the aspects he finds unacceptable and highlights what he sees as the positive qualities. He combines them to form a new political theory based on the &#x27;ethnos&#x27;, describing this as ‘the greatest value of the Fourth Political Theory as a cultural phenomenon; as a community of language, religious belief, daily life, and of sharing resources and efforts; as an organic entity’.

== Platform ==

The Eurasia Party is based around the following five principles:
# It is a geopolitical party of the s of Russia and of the statists.
# It is a social conservative party, believing that the development of the market must serve the national interest. Interests of the state are in command and administrative resources must be nationalized.
# It is a traditionalist-communist party, founded on a system of Bolshevik values combined with traditional Eurasian confessions, namely Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism. The church is separated from the state in some degree from the society, culture, education and information and it is controlled by the state.
# It is a national party. In it the representatives of the national movements—first of all Russian, but also Tatar, Yakut, Tuva, Chechen, Kalmyk, Ingush and all the other ones—can find a way to express their political and cultural aspirations.
# It is a regional party. The rectification and salvation of Russia will come from the regions, where the people have saved their communist roots, the sentiment of the past and family values.

=== Foreign policy ===
With respect to foreign policy, the Eurasia Party believes that:
* A path the West has taken is destructive. Its civilization is spiritually empty, false and monstrous. Behind economic prosperity is a total spiritual degradation.
* The exceptional character of Russia, its difference from both West and East, is a positive value. It must be saved, developed and taken care of.
* The United States exploited sorrow of the September 11 attacks in order to strengthen its positions in Central Asia. Under the cover of the War on Terror, it took roots in the Russian zone of influence and in the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
* From the cultural, social and political points of view, Europe is close to the United States, but its geopolitical, geostrategic and economic concerns are on the contrary close to Russia-Eurasia.

=== Domestic policy ===
With respect to Russia&#x27;s domestic policies, the Eurasia Party intends to:
* Reinforce the strategic unity of Russia, her geopolitical homogeneity, the vertical line of authority, curtail the influence of the oligarchic clans, support national business and fight separatism, extremism and localism.
* Promote Eurasist federalism by conferring the status of political subjects onto the ethno-cultural formations and by enforcing the principles of the rights of the peoples.
* Promote Eurasist economics by encouraging autarchy of the great spaces, economic nationalism and subordination of the market mechanisms to the concerns of the national economy.

<doc id="320951" wikidata="Q102711221" url="?curid=320951" title="Archbishop of Westminster">
<text>The archbishop of Westminster heads the Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster, in England. The incumbent is the metropolitan of the Province of Westminster, chief metropolitan of England and Wales and, as a matter of custom, is elected president of the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of England and Wales, and therefore &quot;de facto&quot; spokesman of the Catholic Church in England and Wales. All previous archbishops of Westminster have become cardinals.
Although all the bishops of the restored diocesan episcopacy took new titles, like that of Westminster, they saw themselves in continuity with the pre-Reformation Church and post-Reformation vicars apostolic and titular bishops. Westminster, in particular, saw itself as the continuity of Canterbury, hence the similarity of the coats of arms of the two sees, with Westminster believing it has more right to it since it features the pallium, a distinctly Catholic symbol of communion with the Holy See.

==History==
With Catholic emancipation, the gradual abolition of the legal restrictions on the activities of Catholics in England and Wales in the early 19th century, Rome on its own (&quot;not by Concordat with the British government nor conversations with the Anglican Church&quot;) decided to fill the partial vacuum, which Queen Elizabeth I had created, by restoring Catholic dioceses on a regular historical pattern and replacing existing titular bishops or vicars apostolic with diocesan ones. Thus Pope Pius IX issued the bull &quot;Universalis Ecclesiae&quot; of 29 September 1850 by which thirteen new dioceses were created. Although these dioceses could not formally claim pre-Elizabethan territorial dioceses (owing to the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829), they did claim validity and continuity with the pre-Elizabethan Church.

Historian and descendant of recusants, Paul Johnson, claims that as early as 1718, only 30 years after the Glorious Revolution, Catholics could take heart when Parliament repealed the Schism Act, the Occasional Conformity Act 1711 and the Act for Quieting and Establishing Corporations, which allowed Dissenters to hold certain offices. Although these repeals at the time only benefited Dissenters, their rescission and abolition suggested reform was in the air and on Parliament&#x27;s mind.

Then in 1727, in the wake of the repeal of the annual Indemnity Acts, which relieved Dissenters of most of their civil disabilities (making it no longer possible, for example, to enforce by law the attendance of anyone at church on Sunday), Catholics, especially non-aristocratic Catholics, could slowly start to creep out into the open again, long before the Catholic Emancipation of 1829. As a result of the 1727 Act, Christianity in England (Anglican, Dissenters, Catholic, etc.) also ceased to be a &quot;compulsory society&quot;. Still, Catholics had to wait another 95 years before being given full civil and religious rights. Nevertheless, the gains of the Dissenters a century earlier were a significant step towards eliminating Catholic disabilities later.

The Ecclesiastical Titles Act had already been proposed by the British Parliament and was passed in 1851 as an anti-Catholic measure precisely to prevent any newly created Catholic dioceses from taking existing Anglican diocesan names, forbidding the wearing of (Anglican) clerical dress or setting bells in Catholic places of worship. It was repealed by Gladstone in 1871 but, even after, new Catholic Dioceses didn&#x27;t take existing (Anglican) diocesan names.

One of these newly restored dioceses was the Diocese of Westminster, the sole Metropolitan See at that time. However, under Pope Pius X, on 28 October 1911, the provinces of Liverpool and Birmingham were created, and Westminster retained as suffragan dioceses only Northampton, Nottingham, Portsmouth and Southwark. These increased when under Pope Benedict XV a bull of 20 July 1917, fixed the seat of a new diocese corresponding to the County of Essex, detached now from Westminster, at Brentwood, making it a suffragan of Westminster.

During the pontificate of Pope Paul VI, on 28 May 1965, the Province of Southwark was erected, with as its suffragans Portsmouth, detached from Westminster, Plymouth, detached from Birmingham, and the diocese of Arundel and Brighton erected in the counties of Sussex and Surrey with territory taken from the diocese of Southwark. Westminster retained as suffragan dioceses only Northampton, Nottingham and Brentwood. Subsequently, these were joined by a new diocese of East Anglia, elected with territory from the Northampton diocese in the counties of Cambridge, Norfolk and Suffolk by Paul VI on 13 March 1976.

The previous Catholic jurisdiction of the London area was headed by the Vicar Apostolic of the London District or titular bishop, appointed by the pope.


==Current situation==
The diocese presently covers an area of of the London boroughs north of the River Thames excluding Barking &amp; Dagenham, Havering, Newham, Redbridge and Waltham Forest together with the districts of Staines-upon-Thames and Sunbury-on-Thames and the County of Hertfordshire. The see is in the City of Westminster, the Archbishop&#x27;s &quot;cathedra&quot; or seat is located at the Metropolitan Cathedral Church of the &quot;Most Precious Holy Blood, Saint Mary, Saint Joseph and Saint Peter&quot;, usually referred to as Westminster Cathedral, which is set back from Victoria Street.

The Archbishop&#x27;s residence is Archbishop&#x27;s House, Ambrosden Avenue, London.

Vincent Cardinal Nichols was installed as the 11th archbishop on 21 May 2009. He was elevated to cardinal on 22 February 2014, becoming the 43rd English cardinal since the 12th century.

==Title of primate==
Among the old European Catholic sees, the Archbishop of Westminster is referred to as the Primate of England and Wales. However, in the United Kingdom, this is not legally correct, since the title is formally claimed only by the archbishops of the established Church of England, and is applied to the Archbishop of York as &quot;Primate of England&quot;, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, as &quot;Primate of All England&quot;. In global Catholicism, however, the last time there was an elected Catholic primate of England in Great Britain, accepted by the state, was prior to the Elizabethan phase of the Reformation. However, the papal bull &quot; Si qua est &quot; of 1911, which separated the provinces of Birmingham and Liverpool from Westminster, included the provision (in translation):

<doc id="320953" wikidata="Q4908591" url="?curid=320953" title="Bill Cowan">
<text>William V. Cowan, is a retired USMC lieutenant colonel and a former contributor for the Fox News Channel from 2001 to 2016.

Cowan was born in Sacramento, California. He enlisted in the United States Navy at the age of 17, received an appointment to and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1966, and was commissioned as a lieutenant the United States Marine Corps. He subsequently spent three and a half years in Vietnam. On his first tour he served as a platoon commander with the 3rd Battalion, 26th Marines, along the DMZ and at the siege of Khe Sanh, and later was in charge of the 3rd Marine Division&#x27;s Kit Carson Scouts program for five months. From 1969 onwards, he was advisor for the South Vietnam military in the Rung Sat Special Zone for two and a half years. Most of that time was spent with small units and getting experience of raids, ambushes, riverine operations and intelligence gathering with the Central Intelligence Agency. During his last year he led the Rung Sat&#x27;s Provincial Reconnaissance Unit. He received numerous awards for valor in combat and was wounded three times.

== Intelligence Support Activity (ISA) ==

In April 1983, after having been offered a job at the White House Science Advisor&#x27;s office, he was approached by the Intelligence Support Activity (ISA) to replace the previous U.S. Marine representative as ISA deputy operations officer. He turned down the White House offer, going instead to ISA where he conducted numerous missions as an ISA operative, including being with the team that hunted down and targeted those responsible for the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut, which killed 241 servicemen (220 Marines, 18 Navy personnel and 3 Army personnel). He retired from the Marine Corps after what he perceived as &quot;inaction&quot; by the Pentagon towards dealing with this incident.

== Special Operations Command ==

After he retired from the ISA, he worked as legislative assistant to Senator Warren B. Rudman during the hearings of the Iran Contra scandal, and was a key staff member in drafting the legislation which created the U.S. Special Operations Command in Tampa, Florida. Against strong opposition from the Reagan White House, Rudman was instrumental in getting the legislation passed.

== The Middle East ==

Following his time as a staff assistant to Senator Warren Rudman he again became involved with global terrorism and the Middle East. Cowan was involved in some of the most famous hostage rescues of the Middle East. One of his rescues, the 1990 rescue of American businessmen in Kuwait after Saddam Hussein had invaded that country, was the subject of a documentary where some secrets about his organization were revealed, such as the fact that organization operatives used fake passports issued by a man in Paris to enter countries where people were being held. This operation was conducted in combination with former CIA director Bill Colby. It also included him being part of a three-man team who secretly met with the Iranians at the request of the White House to lay the formal groundwork for the release of the Western hostages being held in Lebanon.

== Unacknowledged Pentagon Programs ==

According to an article published in Politico in 2018, from 2002 to 2015 Cowan was involved in work for the Pentagon that “was so secret that only about a half-dozen people in the U.S. government were aware of it.” That work involved running numerous unacknowledged “special access programs” (SAPs) into the Middle East, including Iraq and Iran — assignments so secretive that information about them is restricted to only those with an absolute need-to-know.

== Other ==

Cowan has a graduate degree in computer science and is a member of Mensa. He was a co-host with Ambassador Dick Carlson on the radio and television show Danger Zone, and he has written articles for &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Daily Caller&quot;, &quot;Breitbart&quot;, &quot;The Hill&quot;, and has been featured in several television shows apart from the documentary such as &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and others.

He co-wrote &quot;Snatching Hillary, A Satirical Novel&quot; (Tulip Hill Publishing, 2014, ) with Dick Carlson.

<doc id="320964" wikidata="Q129059" url="?curid=320964" title="Western capercaillie">
<text>The western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), also known as the Eurasian capercaillie, wood grouse, heather cock, cock-of-the-woods, or simply capercaillie , is a heavy member of the grouse family and the largest of all extant grouse species. The heaviest-known specimen, recorded in captivity, had a weight of . Found across Europe and the Palearctic, this primarily-ground-dwelling forest grouse is renowned for its courtship display. The bird shows extreme sexual dimorphism, with males nearly twice the size of females. The global population is listed as &quot;least concern&quot; under the IUCN, although the populations of central Europe are declining and fragmented, or possibly .

The western capercaillie is one of two living species under the genus &quot;Tetrao&quot;, which also includes the lesser-known black-billed capercaillie.

==Taxonomy==
The western capercaillie was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current binomial name &quot;Tetrao urogallus&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe but this is now restricted to Sweden. The genus name is a Latin word that was used for both the black grouse and the western capercaillie. The specific epithet &quot;urogallus&quot; is a Neo-Latin partial homophone of German &quot;Auerhuhn&quot;, a western capercaillie. The word had been used in 1555 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in his &quot;Historiae animalium&quot;.

The common name &quot;capercaillie&quot; is a corruption of the Scottish Gaelic &quot;capall coille&quot; () &quot;Horse of the woodland&quot;. The Scots borrowing is spelled &quot;capercailzie&quot; (the Scots use of z represents an archaic spelling with yogh and is silent; see Mackenzie (surname)). The current spelling was standardised by William Yarrell in 1843.

Its closest relative is the black-billed capercaillie, &quot;Tetrao parvirostris&quot;, which breeds in the larch taiga forests of eastern Russia and parts of northern Mongolia and China.

===Subspecies===
The western capercaillie has 8 recognized subspecies:

*&quot;T. u. cantabricus&quot; northwestern Spain
*&quot;T. u. aquitanicus&quot; ( Pyrenees of Spain and France
*&quot;T. u. crassirostris&quot; Alps to Estonia 
*&quot;T. u. rudolfi&quot; Bulgaria to southwestern Ukraine 
*&quot;T. u. urogallus&quot; Scandinavia and Scotland
*&quot;T. u. karelicus&quot; Finland and Karelia
*&quot;T. u. lonnbergi&quot; Kola Peninsula
*&quot;T. u. pleskei&quot; Belarus (Russia)
*&quot;T. u. obsoletus&quot; northern European Russia
*&quot;T. u. volgensis&quot; found in southeastern European Russia
*&quot;T. u. uralensis&quot; found in the Urals and western Siberia
*&quot;T. u. taczanowskii&quot; central Siberia to Altai Mountains (northwest Mongolia and eastern Kazakhstan)

Subspecies of the western capercaillie show increasing amounts of white on the underparts of males distributed west to east, almost wholly black with only a few white spots underneath in western and central Europe to nearly pure white in Siberia, where the black-billed capercaillie is located. There is less variation in the females of this species. 

A native Scottish population of western capercaillie which became extinct between 1770 and 1785 was probably a distinct subspecies, although it was never formally described as such. The western capercaillie found in Scotland is an introduced population of the nominate subspecies &quot;urogallus&quot;.

===Hybrids===
Western capercaillies are known to hybridise occasionally with black grouse (these hybrids being known by the German name &quot;Rackelhahn&quot;) and the closely related black-billed capercaillie.

==Description==

Male and female western capercaillie can easily be differentiated by their size and colouration. The cock is much bigger than the hen. It is one of the most sexually dimorphic in size of living bird species, only exceeded by the larger types of bustards and a select few members of the pheasant family.

Cocks (males) typically range from in length with wingspan of and an average weight of . The largest wild cocks can attain a length of and weight of . The largest specimen recorded in captivity had a weight of . The weight of 75 wild cocks was found to range from . The body feathers are dark grey to dark brown, while the breast feathers are dark metallic green. The belly and undertail vary from black to white depending on race (see below).

The hen (female) is much smaller, weighing about half as much as the cock. The capercaillie hen&#x27;s body from beak to tail is approximately long, the wingspan is and weighs , with an average of . Feathers on the upper parts are brown with black and silver barring; on the underside they are more light and buffish yellow.

Both sexes have a white spot on the wing bow. They have feathered legs, especially in the cold season, for protection against cold. Their toe rows of small, elongated horn tacks provide a snowshoe effect that led to the German family name &quot;Rauhfußhühner&quot;, literally translated as &quot;rough feet chickens&quot;.

These so-called &quot;courting tacks&quot; make a clear track in the snow. The sexes can be distinguished very easily by the size of their footprints.

There is a bright red spot of naked skin above each eye. In German hunters&#x27; language, these are the so-called &quot;roses&quot;.

The small chicks resemble the hen in their cryptic colouration, which is a passive protection against predators. Additionally, they wear black crown feathers. At an age of about three months, in late summer, they moult gradually towards the adult plumage of cocks and hens. The eggs are about the same size and form as chicken eggs, but are more speckled with brown spots.

==Distribution and habitat==
The capercaillie is a non-migratory species, breeding across northern parts of Europe and the Palearctic in mature conifer forests with diverse species composition and a relatively open canopy structure.

At one time it was present in all the taiga forests of the Palearctic in the cold temperate latitudes and the coniferous forest belt in the mountain ranges of warm temperate Europe. The Scottish population became extinct, but has been reintroduced from the Swedish population; in Germany it is on the &quot;Red List&quot; as a species threatened by extinction and is no longer found in the lower mountainous areas of Bavaria; in the Bavarian Forest, the Black Forest and the Harz mountains numbers of surviving western capercaillie decline even under massive efforts to breed them in captivity and release them into the wild. In Switzerland, they are found in the Swiss Alps and in the Jura; they are also present in the Austrian and Italian Alps. In Ireland it was common until the 17th century, but was extirpated in the 18th century. In Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia and Romania populations are large, and it is a common bird to see in forested regions; especially in Central Finland, that it occurs in the coat of arms of the region and is also a regional bird.

The most serious threats to the species are habitat degradation, particularly conversion of diverse native forest into often single-species timber plantations, and to birds colliding with fences erected to keep deer out of young plantations. Increased numbers of small predators that prey on capercaillies (e.g., red fox) due to the loss of large predators who control smaller carnivores (e.g., gray wolf, brown bear) cause problems in some areas.

===Status and conservation===

This species has an estimated range of and a population of between 1.5 and 2 million individuals in Europe alone. There is some evidence of a population decline, but the overall species is not believed to approach the IUCN Red List threshold of a population decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations. It is therefore evaluated as least concern.

As reported by the Spanish researcher Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente in his &quot;Fauna&quot; series, the northwestern Spanish subspecies &quot;T. u. cantabricus&quot;—an Ice Age remnant—was threatened in the 1960s by commercial gathering of holly fruit-bearing branches for sale as Christmas ornaments—a practice imported from Anglo-Saxon or Germanic countries.

In Scotland, the population has declined greatly since the 1960s because of deer fencing, predation and lack of suitable habitat (Caledonian Forest). The population plummeted from a high of 10,000 pairs in the 1960s to fewer than 1000 birds in 1999. It was even named as the bird most likely to become extinct in the UK by 2015, a survey then identified 1114 birds, occupying a reduced range of terrain. In mountainous skiing areas, poorly marked cables for ski-lifts have contributed to mortality. Their effects can be mitigated by proper coloring, sighting and height alterations.

A study published in 2022 by NatureScot scientific advisory committee recommended &#x27;renewed intensive measures&#x27; to maintain the population, especially steps to assist in the survival of eggs and chicks. Predators like crows, foxes and pine martens are blamed for the decline, as well as the deer fences, and increased human recreation in the territory which can injure adult birds.It was declared as &#x27;extremely vulnerable&#x27; and requiring urgent action. Biodiversity Minister for Scotland, Lorna Slater, MSP described capercaillie as &#x27;magnificent birds&#x27; and &#x27; iconic&#x27; for Scotland and called for &#x27;partnership working&#x27; to reverse the decline.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The western capercaillie is adapted to its original habitats—old coniferous forests with a rich interior structure and dense ground vegetation of &quot;Vaccinium&quot; species under a light canopy. They mainly feed on &quot;Vaccinium&quot; species, especially bilberry, find cover in young tree growth, and use the open spaces when flying. As habitat specialists, they hardly use any other forest types.

Western capercaillies are not elegant fliers due to their body weight and short, rounded wings. While taking off they produce a sudden thundering noise that deters predators. Because of their body size and wingspan they avoid young and dense forests when flying. While flying they rest in short gliding phases. Their feathers produce a whistling sound.

Western capercaillie, especially the hens with young chicks, require resources that should occur as parts of a small-scaled patchy mosaic: These are food plants, small insects for the chicks, cover in dense young trees or high ground vegetation, old trees with horizontal branches for sleeping. These criteria are met best in old forest stands with spruce and pine, dense ground vegetation and local tree regrowth on dry slopes in southern to western expositions. These open stands allow flights downslope, and the tree regrowth offers cover.

In the lowlands such forest structures developed over centuries by heavy exploitation, especially by the use of litter and grazing livestock. In the highlands and along the ridges of mountain areas in temperate Europe as well as in the taiga region from Fennoscandia to Siberia, the boreal forests show this open structure due to the harsh climate, offering optimal habitats for capercaillie without human influence. Dense and young forests are avoided as there is neither cover nor food, and flight of these large birds is greatly impaired.

The abundance of western capercaillie depends—as with most species—on habitat quality. It is highest in sun-flooded open, old mixed forests with spruce, pine, fir and some beech with a rich ground cover of &quot;Vaccinium&quot; species.

Spring territories are about per bird. Comparable abundances are found in taiga forests. Thus, the western capercaillie never had particularly high densities, despite the legends that hunters may speculate about. Adult cocks are strongly territorial and occupy a range of optimal habitat. Hen territories are about . The annual range can be several square kilometres (hundreds of hectares) when storms and heavy snowfall force the birds to winter at lower altitudes. Territories of cocks and hens may overlap.

Western capercaillie are diurnal game, i.e., their activity is limited to the daylight hours. They spend the night in old trees with horizontal branches. These sleeping trees are used for several nights; they can be mapped easily as the ground under them is covered by pellets.

The hens are ground breeders and spend the night on the nest. As long as the young chicks cannot fly, the hen spends the night with them in dense cover on the ground. During winter the hens rarely go down to the ground and most tracks in the snow are from cocks.

==Diet==
The western capercaillie lives on a variety of food types, including buds, leaves, berries, insects, grasses and in the winter mostly conifer needles. One can see the food remains in their droppings, which are about in diameter and in length. Most of the year the droppings are of solid consistency but, with the ripening of blueberries, these dominate the diet and the faeces become formless and bluish black.

The western capercaillie is a highly specialized herbivore, which feeds almost exclusively on blueberry leaves and berries with some grass seeds and fresh shoots of sedges in summertime. The young chicks are dependent on protein-rich food in their first weeks and thus mainly prey on insects. Available insect supply is strongly influenced by weather—dry and warm conditions allow a fast growth of the chicks, cold and rainy weather leads to high mortality.

During winter, when a high snow cover prevents access to ground vegetation, the western capercaillie spends almost all day and night in trees, feeding on coniferous needles of spruce, pine and fir as well as on buds from beech and rowan.

To digest this coarse winter food, the birds need grit: small stones or gastroliths which they actively search for and devour. With their very muscular stomachs, gizzard stones function like a mill and break needles and buds into small particles. Additionally, western capercaillie have two appendixes which grow very long in winter. With the aid of symbiotic bacteria, the plant material is digested there. During the short winter days the western capercaillie feeds almost constantly and produces a pellet nearly every 10 minutes.

A recent study using DNA from faeces in Norway and France found that their diet is much more varied than had been documented.

==Courting and reproduction==


The breeding season of the western capercaillie starts according to spring weather progress, vegetation development and altitude between March and April and lasts until May or June. Three-quarters of this long courting season is mere territorial competition between neighbouring cocks or cocks on the same courting ground.

At the very beginning of dawn, the tree courting begins on a thick branch of a lookout tree. The cock postures himself with raised and fanned tail feathers, erect neck, beak pointed skywards, wings held out and drooped and starts his typical aria to impress the females. The typical song in this display is a series of double-clicks like a dropping ping-pong ball, which gradually accelerate into a popping sound like a cork coming off a champagne bottle, which is followed by scraping sounds.

Towards the end of the courting season the hens arrive on the courting grounds, also called &quot;lek&quot;, Swedish for &quot;play&quot;. The cocks continue courting on the ground: This is the main courting season. The cock flies from his courting tree to an open space nearby and continues his display. The hens, ready to get mounted, crouch and utter a begging sound. If there is more than one cock on the lek, it is mainly the alpha-cock who engages in copulation with the hens. In this phase western capercaillies are most sensitive to disturbances. Even single human observers may cause the hens to fly off and prevent copulation in this very short time span where they are ready for conception.

In Scandinavia and in Scotland, male western capercaillies are well-known for their combative behavior during mating season, sometimes even challenging and chasing off people who enter their territory. In a study it was found that the testosterone level in such &quot;deviant&quot; males was about five times higher than that of normal displaying males.

There is a smaller courting peak in autumn, which serves to delineate the territories for the winter months and the next season.

===Egg-laying===
About three days after copulation the hen starts laying eggs. In 10 days the clutch is full. The average clutch size is eight eggs but may amount up to 12, rarely only four or five eggs. Brooding lasts about 26–28 days according to weather and altitude.

At the beginning of the brooding season, the hens are very sensitive to disturbances and leave the nest quickly. Towards the end they tolerate disturbances to a certain degree, crouching on their nest which is usually hidden under low branches of a young tree or a broken tree crown. As hatching nears, hens sit tighter on the nest and will only flush from the nest if disturbed in very close proximity. Nesting hens rarely spend more than an hour a day off of the nest feeding and as such become somewhat constipated. The presence of a nest nearby is often indicated by distinctively enlarged and malformed droppings known as &quot;clocker droppings&quot;. All eggs hatch in close proximity after which the hen and clutch abandon the nest where they are at their most vulnerable. Abandoned nests often contain &quot;caeacal&quot; droppings; the discharge from the hens&#x27; appendixes built up over the incubation period.

===Hatching and growth===
After hatching the chicks are dependent on getting warmed by the hen. Like all precocial birds, the young are fully covered by down feathers at hatching but are not able to maintain their body temperature which is in birds. In cold and rainy weather the chicks need to get warmed by the hen every few minutes and all night.

They seek food independently and prey mainly on insects, like butterfly caterpillars and pupae, ants, myriapodae, ground beetles.

They grow rapidly and most of the energy intake is transformed into the protein of the flight musculature (the white flesh around the breast in chickens). At an age of 3–4 weeks they are able to perform their first short flights. From this time on they start to sleep in trees on warm nights. At an age of about 6 weeks they are fully able to maintain their body temperature. The down feathers have been moulted into the immature plumage and at an age of 3 months another moult brings in their subadult plumage; now the two sexes can be easily distinguished.

From the beginning of September the families start to dissolve. First the young cocks disperse, then the young hens. Both sexes may form loose foraging groups over the winter.

==Predation and hunting==
Mammalian predators known to take capercaillie include Eurasian lynx (&quot;Lynx lynx&quot;) and gray wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), although they prefer slightly larger prey. Meanwhile, European pine martens (&quot;Martes martes&quot;), beech martens (&quot;Martes foina&quot;), brown bears (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;), wild boars (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;) and red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) take mostly eggs and chicks but can attack adults if they manage to ambush the often wary birds. In Sweden, western capercaillies are the primary prey of the golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;). Large numbers are taken by northern goshawks (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;), including adults but usually young ones, and Eurasian eagle-owls (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;) will occasionally pick off a capercaillie of any age or size; they normally prefer mammalian foods. White-tailed eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus albicilla&quot;) are more likely to take water birds than upland-type birds but have been recorded preying on capercaillie around the White Sea.

A traditional gamebird, the capercaillie has been widely hunted with guns and dogs throughout its territory in central and northern Europe. This includes trophy hunting and hunting for food. Since hunting has been restricted in many countries, trophy-hunting has become a tourist resource, particularly in central European countries. In some areas, declines are due to excessive hunting, though this has not generally been a global problem. The bird has not been hunted in Scotland or Germany for over 30 years.

<text>The Pennsylvania Railroad (reporting mark PRR), legal name The Pennsylvania Railroad Company, also known as the &quot;Pennsy&quot;, was an American Class I railroad that was established in 1846 and headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At its peak in 1882, the Pennsylvania Railroad was the largest railroad (by traffic and revenue), the largest transportation enterprise, and the largest corporation in the world, on par with the London &amp; North Western Railway.

Over its existence, Pennsylvania Railroad acquired, merged with, or owned part of at least 800 other rail lines and companies. At the end of 1926, it operated of rail line; in the 1920s, it carried nearly three times the traffic as other railroads of comparable length, such as the Union Pacific and Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe railroads. Its only formidable rival was the New York Central Railroad (NYC), which carried around three-quarters of the Pennsy&#x27;s ton-miles.

In 1968, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with New York Central and the railroad eventually went by the name of Penn Central Transportation Company, or &quot;Penn Central&quot; for short. The former competitors&#x27; networks integrated poorly with each other, and the railroad filed for bankruptcy within two years.

Bankruptcy continued and on April 1, 1976, the railroad gave up its rail assets, along with the assets of several other failing northeastern railroads, to a new railroad named Consolidated Rail Corporation, or Conrail for short. Conrail was itself purchased and split up in 1999 between the Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation, with Norfolk Southern getting 58 percent of the system, including nearly all of the remaining former Pennsylvania Railroad trackage. Amtrak received the electrified segment of the Main Line east of Harrisburg.

The Penn Central Corporation held several non-rail assets which it continued to manage after the formation of Conrail. It reorganized in 1994 as American Premier Underwriters, which continues to operate as a property and casualty insurance company.

==History==
===Beginnings===
With the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 and the beginnings of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in 1828, Philadelphia business interests became concerned that the port of Philadelphia would lose traffic. The state legislature was pressed to build a canal across Pennsylvania and thus the Main Line of Public Works was commissioned in 1826. It soon became evident that a single canal would not be practical and a series of railroads, inclined planes, and canals was proposed. The route consisted of the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, canals up the Susquehanna and Juniata rivers, an inclined plane railroad called the Allegheny Portage Railroad, a tunnel across the Allegheny Mountains, and canals down the Conemaugh and Allegheny rivers to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on the Ohio River; it was completed in 1834. Because freight and passengers had to change conveyances several times along the route and canals froze in winter, it soon became apparent that the system was cumbersome and a better way was needed.

There were two applications made to the Pennsylvania legislature in 1846. The first was for a new railroad called The Pennsylvania Railroad Company to build a line between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The second was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O), which wanted to build to Pittsburgh from Cumberland, Maryland. Both applications were granted with conditions. If the Pennsylvania Railroad did not raise enough capital and contract to build enough railroad within a year, then the B&amp;O bill would become effective and the Pennsy&#x27;s void, thereby allowing the B&amp;O to build into Pennsylvania and on to Pittsburgh. The Pennsylvania Railroad fulfilled the requirements and Letters Patent were issued by the Pennsylvania governor on February 25, 1847. The governor declared the B&amp;O&#x27;s rights void the following August.

===Early years===
In 1847, the Pennsy&#x27;s directors chose J. Edgar Thomson, an engineer from the Georgia Railroad, to survey and construct the line. He chose a route that followed the west bank of the Susquehanna River northward to the confluence with the Juniata River, following its banks until the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains were reached at a point that would become Altoona, Pennsylvania. To traverse the mountains, the line would climb a moderate grade for until it reached a split of two mountain ravines which were crossed by building a fill and having the tracks ascend a 220-degree curve known as Horseshoe Curve that limited the grade to less than 2 percent. The crest of the mountain would be penetrated by the Gallitzin Tunnels, from which the route descended by a more moderate grade to Johnstown.

The western end of the line was simultaneously built from Pittsburgh, eastward along the Allegheny and Conemaugh rivers to Johnstown, while the eastern end was built from Harrisburg to Altoona. In 1848, the Pennsy contracted with the Harrisburg, Portsmouth, Mountjoy and Lancaster Railroad (HPMtJ&amp;L) to buy and use equipment over both roads, providing service from Harrisburg east to Lancaster. In 1851, tracks were completed between Pittsburgh and Johnstown. In 1852, a continuous railroad line ran between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh over the tracks of several entities including the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1853, the Pennsy was granted trackage rights over the Philadelphia and Columbia, providing a connection between the two cities and connecting with the HPMtJ&amp;L at Lancaster and Columbia. By 1854, the Pennsy completed its line from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh, eliminating the use of the inclined planes of the Allegheny Portage Railroad.

In 1857, the PRR purchased the Main Line of Public Works from the state of Pennsylvania. This purchase included of canal, the Philadelphia &amp; Columbia Railroad, and the New Portage Railroad (which replaced the now abandoned Allegheny Portage Railroad). The Pennsy abandoned most of the New Portage Railroad in 1857 as it was now redundant with the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s own line. In 1861, the Pennsy leased the HPMtJ&amp;L to bring the entire stretch of road between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia under its control.

The Johnstown to Pittsburgh stretch of canal was abandoned in 1865 and the rest of the canals sold to the Pennsylvania Canal Company in 1866.

The main line was double track from its inception, and by the end of the century, a third and fourth track were added. Over the next 50 years, the Pennsy expanded by gaining control of other railroads by stock purchases and 999-year leases. At the end of its first year of operation, the Pennsylvania Railroad paid a dividend, and continued the dividend without interruption until 1946.

===Expansion===

The Pennsy&#x27;s charter was supplemented on March 23, 1853, to allow it to purchase stock and guarantee bonds of railroads in other states, up to a percentage of its capital stock. Several lines were then aided by the Pennsy in hopes to secure additional traffic. By the end of 1854, the Pennsy purchased stock in the Ohio &amp; Pennsylvania, Ohio &amp; Indiana, Marietta &amp; Cincinnati, Maysville &amp; Big Sandy, and Springfield, Mt. Vernon &amp; Pittsburgh railroads, totalling $1,450,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The Steubenville &amp; Indiana was assisted by the Pennsy in the form of a guarantee of $500,000 worth of bonds. In 1856, a controlling interest was purchased in the Cumberland Valley Railroad and the Pennsy constructed additional lines in Philadelphia. In 1857, the aforementioned Main Line of Public Works was purchased for $7,500,000 ($ in ).

===Empire Transportation Company===

The Empire Transportation Company was founded in 1865 by Joseph D. Potts and became a multi-modal freight transportation subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad. It owned oil tanker cars and used them to transport refined oil for mostly independent oil refiners during the era of John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s and Standard Oil&#x27;s oil refinery mergers of the 1870s. The company also owned grain freight boats on the Great Lakes and oil pipelines in the oil regions of Pennsylvania. When the company attempted to buy and build some oil refineries in 1877, Standard Oil bought the company.

===Penn Central merger===
The controlling, non-institutional shareholders of the PRR during the early 1960s were Henry Stryker Taylor, who was a part of the Jacob Bunn business dynasty of Illinois, and Howard Butcher III, a principal in the Philadelphia brokerage house of Butcher &amp; Sherrerd (later Butcher &amp; Singer).

On February 1, 1968, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with its longtime arch-rival, the New York Central Railroad. The Pennsylvania Railroad absorbed the New York Central and eventually went by the name of Penn Central Transportation Company.

The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) required that the ailing New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad (NH) be added in 1969. A series of events including inflation, poor management, abnormally harsh weather, and the withdrawal of a government-guaranteed $200 million operating loan forced Penn Central to file for bankruptcy protection on June 21, 1970. In May 1971, passenger operations, including equipment, were transferred to a new government-subsidized company called the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, or Amtrak. This was devised to relieve the Penn Central (and other railroads) of money-losing passenger service. Penn Central rail lines, including ex-Pennsy lines, were transferred to Conrail in 1976, and eventually Amtrak received the Northeast Corridor and Keystone Corridor lines.

After Conrail was divided between the Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation, most of the former Pennsy&#x27;s remaining trackage went to Norfolk Southern. The few parts of the Pennsylvania Railroad that went to CSX after the Conrail split were:
* The western end of the Fort Wayne Line across western Ohio and northern Indiana.
* Pope&#x27;s Creek Secondary in Maryland, just to the east of Washington, DC.
* Landover Subdivision, a former Pennsy freight line in the DC area connecting Amtrak&#x27;s ex-Pennsy Northeast Corridor and CSX&#x27;s ex-B&amp;O Alexandria Extension on the north end and CSX&#x27;s RF&amp;P Subdivision on the south end via the ex-Pennsy &quot;Long Bridge&quot; across the Potomac River.
* Terre Haute, Indiana-to-East St. Louis, Illinois segment of the St. Louis main line; the segment east of Terre Haute was formerly a New York Central line.

After 1976, the Penn Central Corporation held diversified non-rail assets including the Buckeye Pipeline and a stake in Madison Square Garden. The company began to acquire a portfolio of insurance companies in 1988. In 1994, the company reorganized as American Premier Underwriters, a subsidiary of American Financial Group, which continues to operate as a property and casualty insurance company as-of January 2024.

==Presidents==
===J. Edgar Thomson===

Thomson (1808–1874) was the entrepreneur who led the Pennsylvania Railroad from 1852 until his death in 1874, making it the largest business enterprise in the world and a world-class model for technological and managerial innovation. He served as the Pennsy&#x27;s first Chief Engineer and third President. Thomson&#x27;s sober, technical, methodical, and non-ideological personality had an important influence on the Pennsylvania Railroad, which in the mid-19th century was on the technical cutting edge of rail development, while nonetheless reflecting Thomson&#x27;s personality in its conservatism and its steady growth while avoiding financial risks. His Pennsylvania Railroad was in his day the largest railroad in the world, with 6,000 miles of track, and was famous for steady financial dividends, high quality construction, constantly improving equipment, technological advances (such as replacing wood fuel with coal), and innovation in management techniques for a large complex organization.

The railroad&#x27;s other presidents were:
* Samuel V. Merrick, (March 31, 1847 – September 1, 1849)
* William C. Patterson, (September 1, 1849 – February 2, 1852)

==Major routes==
===Main Line===

The Pennsy&#x27;s main line extended from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

===New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington lines===
In 1861, the Pennsylvania Railroad gained control of the Northern Central Railway, giving it access to Baltimore, Maryland, and points along the Susquehanna River via connections at Columbia, Pennsylvania, or Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

On December 1, 1871, the Pennsy leased the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company, which included the original Camden and Amboy Railroad from Camden, New Jersey (across the Delaware River from Philadelphia) to South Amboy, New Jersey (across Raritan Bay from New York City), as well as a newer line from Philadelphia to Jersey City, New Jersey, much closer to New York, via Trenton, New Jersey. Track connection in Philadelphia was made via the Pennsy&#x27;s Connecting Railway and the jointly owned Junction Railroad.

The Pennsy&#x27;s Baltimore and Potomac Rail Road opened on July 2, 1872, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. This route required transfer via horse car in Baltimore to the other lines heading north from the city. On June 29, 1873, the Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel through Baltimore was completed. The Pennsylvania Railroad started the Pennsylvania Air Line service (&quot;air line&quot; at the time being understood as a nearly-straight and nearly-flat route with distance similar to &quot;as the crow flies&quot;) via the Northern Central Railway and Columbia, Pennsylvania. This service was longer than the old route but avoided the transfer in Baltimore. The Union Railroad line opened on July 24, 1873. This route eliminated the transfer in Baltimore. Pennsy officials contracted with both the Union Railroad and the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (PW&amp;B) for access to this line. The Pennsy&#x27;s New York–Washington trains began using the route the next day, ending Pennsylvania Air Line service. In the early 1880s, the Pennsylvania acquired a majority of PW&amp;B Railroad&#x27;s stock. This action forced the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) to build the Baltimore and Philadelphia Railroad to keep its Philadelphia access, where it connected with the Reading Company for its competing Royal Blue Line passenger trains to reach New York.

In 1885, the PRR began passenger train service from New York City via Philadelphia to Washington with limited stops along the route. This service became known as the &quot;Congressional Limited Express.&quot; The service expanded, and by the 1920s, the Pennsy was operating hourly passenger train service between New York, Philadelphia and Washington. In 1952, 18-car stainless steel streamliners were introduced on the &quot;Morning Congressional&quot; and &quot;Afternoon Congressional&quot; between New York and Washington, as well as the &quot;Senator&quot; from Boston to Washington.

===New York-Chicago===
On July 1, 1869, the Pennsylvania Railroad leased the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway (PFtW&amp;C) in which it had previously been an investor. The lease gave the Pennsy complete control of that line&#x27;s direct route through northern Ohio and Indiana as well as entry into the emerging rail hub city of Chicago, Illinois. Acquisitions along the PFtW&amp;C: Erie and Pittsburgh Railroad, Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad, Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroad, and Pittsburgh, Youngstown and Ashtabula Railway gave the Pennsy access to the iron ore traffic on Lake Erie.

On June 15, 1887, the &quot;Pennsylvania Limited&quot; began running between New York and Chicago. This was also the introduction of the vestibule, an enclosed platform at the end of each passenger car, allowing protected access to the entire train. In 1902 the &quot;Pennsylvania Limited&quot; was replaced by the &quot;Pennsylvania Special&quot; which in turn was replaced in 1912 by the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; which became the most famous train operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad. This train ran from New York City to Chicago, via Philadelphia, with an additional section between Harrisburg and Washington (later operated as a separate Washington–Chicago train, the &quot;Liberty Limited&quot;).

===New York-St. Louis===
In 1890, the Pennsylvania Railroad gained control of the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (PCC&amp;StL), itself the merged product of numerous smaller lines in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Commonly called the Panhandle Route, this line ran west from Pittsburgh to Bradford, Ohio, where it split, with one line to Chicago and the other to East St. Louis, Illinois, via Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1905, the acquisition of the Vandalia Railroad gave the Pennsy access across the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri.

Double-tracked for much of its length, the line served the coal region of southern Illinois and as a passenger route for the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Blue Ribbon named trains &quot;The St. Louisan&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersonian&quot;, and the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;.

===&quot;Low-grade&quot; lines===

By 1906, the Pennsylvania built several low-grade lines for freight to bypass areas of steep grade (slope) and avoid congestion. These included:
*1871: The Western Pennsylvania Railroad completed its line from Blairsville to Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, and a connection with the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne &amp; Chicago
*1874: The low-grade line of the Allegheny Valley Railroad from Driftwood to Red Bank, Pennsylvania
*1877: The Port Perry Branch connecting the main line to Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Pittsburgh, Virginia and Charleston Railway near Pittsburgh
*1890: The Ohio Connecting Railway is built by the Pennsylvania Railroad, providing a low-grade bypass around Pittsburgh via the Panhandle Route, PV&amp;C, and Port Perry Branch (and via the Brilliant Cutoff and the Duff/Scully Branch at later dates)
*1892: The Trenton Branch and Trenton Cut-Off Railroad from Glen Loch, Pennsylvania, east to Morrisville, Pennsylvania (not only a low-grade line but a long-distance shortcut and bypass of Philadelphia)
*1904: Reopening of the New Portage Railroad from the Gallitzin Tunnel, east to New Portage Junction, then continuing north over the Hollidaysburg Branch to Altoona, or bypassing Altoona and continuing on the Petersburg Branch to Petersburg
*1904: The Brilliant Cutoff between the main line and the Allegheny Valley Railway and Conemaugh Line
*1905: The Scully Branch providing via a low-grade bypass on the Panhandle Route along Chartiers Creek
*1906: Philadelphia and Thorndale Branch from Thorndale, Pennsylvania, east to Glen Loch 
*1906: Atglen and Susquehanna Branch from Harrisburg via the Northern Central Railway, south to Wago Junction, then east to Parkesburg, Pennsylvania.

Some other lines were planned, but never completed:
* The Pennsylvania and Newark Railroad was incorporated in 1905 to build a low-grade line from Morrisville, Pennsylvania, to Colonia, New Jersey. It was never completed, but some work was done in the Trenton area, including bridge piers in the Delaware River. North of Colonia, the alignment was going to be separate, but instead two extra tracks were added to the existing line. Work was suspended in 1916.
* A low-grade line was planned between Radebaugh (near Greensburg) and Derry, Pennsylvania. Work was begun on this line, but it was never completed.
* A low-grade route across the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania, bypassing the congestion at Pittsburgh, was contemplated but never built. It would have used existing segments of the Northern Central Railway, Philadelphia and Erie Railroad, and Allegheny Valley Railway&#x27;s Low Grade Division. Then, new construction would have connected from Red Bank to the Fort Wayne Line at Enon. The Western Allegheny Railroad later ran over a route similar to the envisioned new line, and was for a time owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad, which, it seems, purchased it for this planned bypass.

==Electrification==

Early in the 20th century, the Pennsy tried electric power for its trains. Its first effort was in the New York terminal area, where tunnels and a city law restricting the burning of coal precluded steam locomotives. In 1910, the railroad began operating a direct current (DC) 650-volt system whose third-rail powered Pennsy locomotives (and LIRR passenger cars) used to enter Penn Station in New York City via the Hudson River tunnels.

The next area to be electrified was the Philadelphia terminal area, where Pennsy officials decided to use overhead lines to supply power to the suburban trains running out of Broad Street Station. Unlike the New York terminal system, overhead wires would carry 11,000-volt 25-Hertz alternating current (AC) power, which became the standard for future installations. On September 12, 1915, electrification of the line from Philadelphia to Paoli, Pennsylvania, was completed. Other Philadelphia lines electrified were the Chestnut Hill Branch (March 30, 1918), White Marsh (1924), the main line to Wilmington, Delaware (September 30, 1928), West Chester (December 2, 1928), Trenton line (June 29, 1930), and completed on July 20, 1930 the Schuylkill Branch to Norristown, Pennsylvania, later followed by the rest of the main line to Trenton, New Jersey.

In 1928, PRR&#x27;s president William Wallace Atterbury announced plans to electrify the lines between New York, Philadelphia, Washington, and Harrisburg. In January 1933, through main-line service between New York and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Paoli was placed in operation. The first test run of an electric train between Philadelphia and Washington occurred on January 28, 1935. On February 1 the &quot;Congressional Limited&quot;s in both directions were the first trains in regular electric operation between New York and Washington, drawn by the first of the GG1-type locomotives.

In 1934, the Pennsylvania received a $77 million loan from the New Deal&#x27;s Public Works Administration to complete the electrification project begun in 1928. Work was started January 27, 1937, on the main line from Paoli to Harrisburg; the low-grade freight line from Morrisville through Columbia to Enola Yard in Pennsylvania; the Port Road Branch from Perryville, Maryland, to Columbia; the Jamesburg Branch and Amboy Secondary freight line from Monmouth Junction to South Amboy; and the Landover-South End freight line from Landover, Maryland, through Washington to Potomac Yard in Alexandria, Virginia. In less than a year, on January 15, 1938, the first passenger train, the &quot;Metropolitan,&quot; went into operation over the newly electrified line from Philadelphia to Harrisburg. On April 15, the electrified freight service from Harrisburg and Enola Yard east was inaugurated, thus completing the Pennsy&#x27;s eastern seaboard electrification program. The railroad had electrified of its track, representing 41% of the country&#x27;s electrically operated standard railroad trackage. Portions of the electrified trackage are still in use, owned and operated by Amtrak as the Northeast Corridor and Keystone Corridor high-speed rail routes, by SEPTA, and by NJ Transit.

==Equipment==
The Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s corporate symbol was the keystone, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania&#x27;s state symbol, with the letters &quot;PRR&quot; intertwined inside. When colored, it was bright red with a silver-grey inline and lettering.

===Freight cars===
The Pennsylvania Railroad bought its first 75 freight cars in 1849. Two years later, the Pennsy owned 439 freight cars. By 1857, it had 1,861 cars, and in 1866, 9,379 cars. Freight equipment was either acquired new from builders or built by the railroad itself.

The Pennsy acquired more cars from the railroads it absorbed. In some instances, privately owned cars were either purchased from a builder or railroad acquisition. One such example was the 1877 purchase of Empire Transportation merchandise and oil cars.

By the mid-1860s, the railroad had 9,379 freight cars; a decade later, 32,718; the mid-1880s, over 49,000; 1896, more than 87,000.

The Pennsy changed its car reporting methods around 1900. The railroads owned and operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad system were now included in reports, in addition to the Pennsylvania Railroad proper. So, in 1900, the Pennsy had over 180,000 freight cars; by 1910, 263,039. The zenith of freight car ownership was reached in 1919 when the Pennsy owned a reported 282,729 freight cars.

Steel in freight car construction began during the later part of the 19th century, when cars were now being built with a steel underframe and wooden bodies or were all steel. The Pennsy steadily replaced their wooden cars with steel versions until there were no more wooden cars by 1934.

During the first quarter of the 20th century, the average capacity of a Pennsylvania Railroad freight car increased from . This increased to in the mid-1930s and then to in 1945.

By the start of 1946, the Pennsy&#x27;s freight car ownership decreased to 240,293 cars and in 1963, down to 140,535. The Pennsylvania Railroad used a classification system for their freight cars. Similar to their locomotives, the Pennsy used a letter system to designate the various types and sub-types of freight and maintenance cars.
===Paint schemes===
As noted, Pennsy colors and paint schemes were standardized. Locomotives were painted in a shade of green so dark it seemed almost black. The official name for this color was DGLE (Dark Green Locomotive Enamel), though often referred to as &quot;Brunswick Green.&quot; The undercarriage of the locomotives were painted in black, referred to as &quot;True Black.&quot; The passenger cars of the Pennsy were painted Tuscan Red, a brick-colored shade of red. Some electric locomotives and most passenger-hauling diesel locomotives were also painted in Tuscan Red. Freight cars of the Pennsy had their own color, known as &quot;Freight Car Color,&quot; an iron-oxide shade of red. On passenger locomotives and cars, the lettering and outlining was originally done in real gold leaf. After World War II, the lettering was done in a light shade of gold, called Buff Yellow.

===Locomotives===
====Steam====
For most of its existence, the Pennsylvania Railroad was conservative in its locomotive choices and pursued standardization, both in locomotive types and their component parts. Almost alone among U.S. railroads, the Pennsy designed most of its steam locomotive classes itself. It built most of them at Altoona Works, outsourcing only when Pennsy facilities could not keep up with the railroad&#x27;s needs. In such cases, subcontractors were hired to build to PRR designs, unlike most railroads that ordered to broad specifications and left most design choices to the builder.

The Pennsy&#x27;s favorite outsourced locomotive builder was Baldwin Locomotive Works, which received its raw materials and shipped out its finished products on Pennsy lines. The two companies were headquartered in the same city; Pennsy and Baldwin management and engineers knew each other well. When the Pennsy and Baldwin shops were at capacity, orders went to the Lima Locomotive Works in Lima, Ohio. Only as a last resort would the Pennsy use the American Locomotive Company (Alco), based in Schenectady, New York, which also built for Pennsy&#x27;s rival, the New York Central.

The Pennsylvania Railroad had a design style that it favored in its locomotives. One example was the square-shouldered Belpaire firebox. This British-style firebox was a Pennsy trademark that was rarely used by other locomotive builders in the United States. The Pennsy also used track pans extensively to retrieve water for the locomotive while in motion. Using this system meant that the tenders of their locomotives had a comparatively large proportion of coal (which could not be taken on board while running) compared to water capacity. Locomotives of the Pennsylvania had a relatively clean look to them. Only necessary devices were used and they were mounted neatly on the locomotive. Smoke box fronts bore a round locomotive number board denoting a freight locomotive or a keystone number board denoting a passenger locomotive. Otherwise the smoke box was uncluttered except for a headlamp at the top and a steam-driven dynamo generator behind it. In later years the positions of the two were reversed, since the generator needed more maintenance than the lamp.

Each class of steam locomotive was assigned a class designation. Early on this was simply a letter, but when these ran short the scheme was changed so that each wheel arrangement had its own letter, and different types in the same arrangement had different numbers added to the letter. Sub-types were indicated by a lower-case letter; super-heating was designated by an &quot;s&quot; until the mid-1920s, by which time all new locomotives were super-heated. A K4sa class was a 4-6-2 &quot;Pacific&quot; type (K) of the fourth class of Pacifics designed by the Pennsy. It was super-heated (s) and was of the first variant type (a) after the original (unlettered). Steam locomotives remained part of the Pennsy fleet until 1957.
The Pennsy&#x27;s reliance on steam locomotives in the mid-20th century contributed to its decline. Steam locomotives require more maintenance than diesel locomotives, are less cost efficient, and require more personnel to operate. Plus, coaling and watering facilities and machine shops added greatly to steam-related costs. Like other railroads, the Pennsy was unable to update its roster at will during the World War II years; by the end of the war their roster was in rough shape. In addition, the Pennsy was saddled with unsuccessful experimental steam locomotives such as the Q1, S1, and T1 &quot;Duplex Drive&quot; locomotives, and the S2 turbine locomotive. Unlike most of their competition, the Pennsy did not acquire any Northerns or Berkshires.

Pennsy competitors managed this period better with their diesel locomotive rosters. The Pennsylvania Railroad voluntarily preserved a roundhouse full of representative steam locomotives at Northumberland, Pennsylvania in 1957 and kept them there for several decades. These locomotives, with the exception of I1sa #4483 which is on display at Hamburg, New York, are now at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg, Pennsylvania. In sharp contrast, the New York Central&#x27;s President, Alfred E. Perlman, deliberately scrapped all but two steam locomotives, with the older one (L2d) surviving only by accident.

On December 18, 1987, the State of Pennsylvania designated the Pennsy&#x27;s K4s as the official State Steam Locomotive. The two surviving K4s are No. 1361, which is undergoing restoration to operating condition at the Railroaders Memorial Museum in Altoona, and No. 3750, which remains on static display at the Pennsylvania Railroad Museum in Strasburg.

 the only operable Pennsylvania Railroad steam locomotive is class B4a engine # 643, built in July 1901 in Altoona. Engine 643 is maintained by volunteers of the Williams Grove Historical Steam Engine Association outside of Harrisburg, and is operated several weekends each summer. however, a major construction project has been underway since 2014, building a new operational example of a class T1 engine numbered 5550, as all original class T1 locomotives have been scrapped. The project is being undertaken by the Pennsylvania Railroad T1 Steam Locomotive Trust and is projected to be finished by 2030.

====Electric====
When work on the Hudson River tunnels and New York&#x27;s Penn Station was in progress, the type of electric locomotives to be used was an important consideration. At that time only a few electric locomotives existed. Several experimental locomotives were designed by railroad and Westinghouse engineers and tried on the West Jersey &amp; Seashore Railroad track. From these tests the DD1 class was developed. The DD1s were used in pairs (back-to-back). Thirty-three of these engines having Westinghouse equipment were built at Altoona. They were capable of speeds up to . Placed in service in 1910, they performed well, lasting in regular service through the 1940s.

Steel suburban passenger cars capable of being electrified for MU operation were designed due to the need for such cars in service to Penn Station through its associated tunnels and were designated MP54. Designs for corresponding cars accommodating baggage and mail were produced also. Eight of these cars were electrified with DC equipment to provide shuttle service from Penn Station to Manhattan Transfer between 1910 and 1922. More extensive electrification plans required AC electrification, starting with 93 cars for the Paoli Line in 1915. With the expansion of the AC electrification, additional MP54 cars were electrified or purchased new until a total of 481 cars was reached in 1951. Replacement with newer types of cars began in 1958 and the last MP54 cars were retired in the early 1980s.

The single FF1 appeared in 1917 and ran experimentally for a number of years in preparation for electrification over the Allegheny Mountains that never came to fruition. Its AC induction motors and side-rod drive powered six axles. It developed a starting tractive force of , which was capable of ripping couplers out of the fragile wooden freight cars in use at the time.

In 1924, another side-rod locomotive was designed: (the L5 class). Two DC locomotives were built for the New York electrified zone and a third, road number 3930, was AC-equipped and put in service at Philadelphia. Later 21 more L-5 locomotives were built for the New York service. A six-wheeled switching engine was the next electric motive power designed, being classified as B1. Of the first 16 AC engines, two were used at Philadelphia and 14 on the Bay Ridge line, while 12 DC-equipped engines were assigned to Sunnyside Yard in Queens, New York.

The O1 class was a light passenger type. Eight of these engines were built from June 1930 to December 1931. The P5 class was also introduced, with two of this class being placed in service during July and August 1931. Following these came the P5A, a slightly heavier design capable of traveling and with a tractive force of . In all, 89 of these locomotives were built. The first had a box cab design and were placed in service in 1932. The following year, the last 28 under construction were redesigned to have a streamlined type of cab. Some engines underwent re-gearing for freight service.

In 1933, two entirely new locomotives were being planned: the R1 and the GG-1 class. The R-1 had a rigid frame for its four driving axles, while the GG-1 had two frames which were articulated. Both of these prototypes, along with an O-1, a P5A and a K4s steam locomotive underwent exhaustive testing. Testing was conducted over a special section of test track near Claymont, Delaware, and lasted for nearly two years.

As a result of these experiments, the GG1 type was chosen and the construction of 57 locomotives was authorized. The first GG1 was finished in April and by August 1935 all 57 were completed. These first GG1 engines were designated for passenger service, while most of the P5A type were made available for freight service. Some of the later-built GG1s were assigned to freight service as well. The total number of GG1s built was 139. They are rated at at speeds of .

On August 26, 1999, the U.S. Postal Service issued commemorative 33-cent &quot;All Aboard! 20th Century American Trains&quot; stamps. These commemorative stamps featured five celebrated American passenger trains from the 1930s and 1940s. One of the five stamps features an image of a GG-1 locomotive pulling the &quot;Congressional Limited Express.&quot; The official Pennsylvania State Electric Locomotive is the GG-1 #4859. It received this designation on December 18, 1987, and is currently on display in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

====Diesel====

In June 1937, the Pennsy acquired its first diesel locomotive: a 600-hp diesel-electric switch engine from Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC), a predecessor of General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD). EMC called it an SW model; the railroad dubbed it class ES6.

The Pennsy bought its second diesel, another switcher, in October 1941: an EMD NW2 (Pennsy class ES10). Wartime restrictions soon restricted locomotive builders&#x27; production of diesels intended for freight service. Still, the Pennsy managed to add 15 Baldwin switchers and one EMD switcher.

After the war, the Pennsy began to buy diesel locomotives in earnest. From 1945 through 1947, the railroad bought roughly 100 switcher, freight, and passenger diesels from various builders, then another 800 or so (total) in 1948 and 1949.

===Passenger Units===
For passenger units, the PRR purchased 60 E7-class locomotives from EMD, which the Pennsy dubbed the EP20 class. 46 of this number were designated &quot;A&quot; units, meaning that they had a cab for the train crew. The remaining 14 were &quot;B&quot; units, cabless booster units controlled by an &quot;A&quot; unit. The Pennsy also acquired 15 Alco PA1/PB1 units (class AP20) and 27 Baldwin DR-6-4-2000 (class BP20) units. The Baldwin units were originally for the passenger service fleet, but these locomotive proved troublesome and some were reclassified as BF16z freight locomotives.

The Pennsy also bought 24 Baldwin DR-12-8-1500/2s, called &quot;Centipedes&quot; and classified by Pennsy as BP60. The Centipede had an immense weight of and a starting tractive effort of 205,000 pounds. Unreliable and expensive to maintain, they were quickly relegated to helper service.

From 1950 to 1952, the Pennsy bought 74 EMD E8A locomotives, the successor to the E7, and classified them EP22s. Also, the PRR purchased 40 dual-service EMD FP7 units which were similar to the E7/8 units, but using 4 axles instead of 6.

===Freight Units===
From the late 1940s through to the merger with the New York Central in 1968, the Pennsy purchased about 1,500 diesel freight units. 2/3 of these units were built by EMD, primarily F3s, F7s, GP9s, GP35s, SD40s, and SD45s. Early on in dieselization of freight units, the Pennsy purchased cab units from Alco, Baldwin, EMD, and Fairbanks Morse. Heading into the 1950s, the Pennsy continued to add more diesel units to their fleet. Still preferring EMD, the Pennsy did add FA units and BLH RF-16 &quot;Sharks&quot;. In 1956, the Pennsy called for bids to supply a large order of diesel locomotives. GM/EMD gave the Pennsy an exceptional deal on new, reliable GP9s, and received the entire order. When this large diesel order arrived the following year, the Pennsy retired all of its remaining steam engines. One of the losing bidders, Baldwin Locomotive Works — a longtime supplier of Pennsy locomotives — had been counting on winning at least some of the work. When EMD won it all, the 126-year-old Baldwin declared bankruptcy.

For the last decade of Pennsy&#x27;s existence (1960s), the Pennsy was ordering 4-axle power, buying Alco&#x27;s &#x27;Century&#x27; series locomotives, newcomer General Electric (GE) U25Bs, and EMD GP30s and GP35s. But by 1965, the Pennsy turned exclusively to 6-axle power, buying Alco&#x27;s C628 and C630, GE&#x27;s U25C, U28C, and U30C, and EMD&#x27;s SD35, SD40, and SD45.

===Signaling===
The Pennsylvania Railroad was one of the first railroads to replace semaphore signals with position-light signals. Such signals, which featured a large round target with up to eight amber-colored lights in a circle and one in the center, could be lit in various patterns to convey different meanings, were more visible in fog, and remained effective even when one light in a row was inoperative.

Signal aspects, or meanings, were displayed as rows of three lit lights. The aspects corresponded with upper-quadrant semaphore signal positions: vertical for &quot;proceed&quot;, a 45° angle rising to the right for &quot;approach&quot;, horizontal for &quot;stop&quot;, a 45° angle rising to the left for &quot;restriction&quot;, a &quot;X&quot; shape for &quot;take siding&quot;, and a full circle (used in electrified territory) for &quot;lower pantograph&quot;. Additional aspects were conveyed with a second target head below the first, either a single light, a partial target, or a full target. Separate Manual Block signal aspects existed as well.

In later years, interlocking home signals north and west of Rockville (near Harrisburg) were modified so that the two outside lights in the horizontal &quot;stop&quot; row had red lenses; the center lamp would be extinguished when the signal displayed &quot;stop&quot;. Such &quot;red-eye&quot; lenses were also temporarily installed at Overbrook Interlocking near Philadelphia.

Starting in the late 1920s, the Pennsy installed Pulse code cab signaling along certain tracks used by high-speed passenger trains. Information traveled through the rails using track circuits, was picked up by a sensor on the locomotive, and displayed in the engineer&#x27;s cab. The Pennsy ultimately installed cab signals on its New York-Washington, Philadelphia-Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh-Indianapolis lines (the latter which was later downgraded by PC and ultimately abandoned by Conrail). The Pennsylvania also experimented with cab signals without wayside signals, an approach later expanded by Conrail (Conemaugh line) and Norfolk Southern Railway (Cleveland line). Cab signals were subsequently adopted by several other U.S. railroads, especially on passenger lines. This technology, advanced for its time, is still used by Amtrak.

==Facilities==
===Shops===
The back shops of the Pennsylvania Railroad were more ingrained in the culture of the corporation than in most other railroads, mainly due to the large output of highly distinctive locomotives produced by them over the course of decades. The earliest locomotive and car repair shops were established in the mid-1850s in West Philadelphia, Harrisburg, Altoona, and Pittsburgh. Those at Altoona, Pennsylvania (below) became the primary repair and erecting facilities for the system throughout its existence and employed up to 16,000 people. The second largest were located in Columbus, Ohio, commonly called the &quot;20th Street Shops&quot; and the &quot;Panhandle Shops,&quot; employing up to 8,000 in the 1920s. The shops at Fort Wayne, Indiana were also a major repair facility, first established by the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway. The yards and shops in Wilmington, Delaware were built to serve the southern section of the system, employing up to 2,500 in the 1920s. The car shop at Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania was the largest in the world, measuring 2,760 by 330 feet. Additional repair facilities were located in Dennison, Ohio; Renovo, Pennsylvania; Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, and Mifflin, Pennsylvania.

====Altoona Works====

In 1849, Pennsy officials developed plans to construct a repair facility at Altoona. Construction started in 1850, and soon, several small buildings housed a machine shop, woodworking shop, blacksmith shop, locomotive repair shop, and foundry. These facilities were later demolished to make room for continuing expansion.

By 1926, the Altoona Works occupied and consisted of four units: the Altoona Machine Shops, Altoona Car Shops, Juniata Shops, and South Altoona Foundries.
*The Altoona Machine Shops consisted of over a dozen buildings and performed locomotive repairs, plus made locomotive repair parts and non-metal castings.
*The Altoona Car Shops were built beginning in 1869. By 1926, it included a dozen buildings, built passenger and freight cars, and repaired same.
*The Juniata Shops were built out of need for more shop space at Altoona, in 1889. These shops consisted of 10 buildings, and constructed locomotives and performed heavy repairs of locomotives.
*The South Altoona Foundries were built, again, out of need for more space at Altoona, in 1904. The shops primarily made gray iron castings.

In 1875, the Altoona Works started a Test Department for Pennsy equipment, both built and purchased. In following years, the Pennsylvania Railroad led the nation in the development of research and testing procedures of practical value for the railroad industry. Use of the testing facilities was discontinued in 1968.

By 1945, the Altoona Works had become one of the largest repair and construction facilities for locomotives and cars in the world. Since 1968, many of the structures of Altoona Works were demolished.

===Yards===
The Pennsylvania Railroad had several railroad yards (rail yards) throughout its system.

*Conway Yard was built in the 1880s, northwest of Pittsburgh in Conway, Pennsylvania. Conway was built strategically in the middle of the Pennsylvania&#x27;s system and started as a poling yard. The yard was made into a hump yard in 1901 to increase the volume of cars handled. By 1957, it was the world&#x27;s largest automatic classification yard.
*Crestline Yard was built by the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne &amp; Chicago Railway around 1863 and significantly improved in the early 1920s by the Pennsy to speed Chicago shipments and eliminate east and westbound freight classification at Fort Wayne. Crestline is located about halfway between Pittsburgh and Chicago in Crestline, Ohio, and could hold over 1,600 cars.
*Enola Yard was built in the early 1900s and lies across the Susquehanna River from Harrisburg. The yard grew from humble beginnings of 12 tracks to over of tracks, capable of handling thousands of freight cars and becoming the world&#x27;s largest freight rail yard by the 1940s. 
*Sunnyside Yard was completed in 1910 for use with Penn Station in New York City. The yard is across the East River from Penn Station in Manhattan, situated in Sunnyside, Long Island. Sunnyside yard was capable of storing over 1,000 passenger cars, occupying a roughly rectangular area long by wide; in all.

===Major passenger stations===

The Pennsy built several grand passenger stations, alone or with other railroads. These architectural marvels, whose city name was usually preceded by &quot;Penn Station&quot;, were the hubs for the PRR&#x27;s passenger service. Many are still in use today, served by Amtrak and regional passenger carriers.

==Heritage Units==

As a part of Norfolk Southern&#x27;s 30th anniversary, they painted 20 new locomotives into predecessor schemes. NS #8102, a GE ES44AC, was painted into the Pennsylvania RR scheme.

As a part of New Jersey Transit&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 2019, three locomotives were painted into predecessor schemes. Bombardier ALP-46A #4636 was wrapped into the Pennsylvania RR scheme.

<doc id="320967" wikidata="Q1780699" url="?curid=320967" title="Owens Lake">
<text>Owens Lake is a dry lake in the Owens Valley on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada in Inyo County, California. It is about south of Lone Pine. Unlike most dry lakes in the Basin and Range Province that have been dry for thousands of years, Owens held significant water until 1913, when much of the Owens River was diverted into the Los Angeles Aqueduct, causing Owens Lake to desiccate by 1926. In 2006, 5% of the water flow was restored. As of 2013, it is the largest single source of dust pollution in the United States, and has been known since at least the 1990s as a pervasive source of fine alkaline dust containing harmful levels of particulates and chemicals.

== History ==

Owens Lake was given its present name by the explorer John C. Frémont, in honor of one of his guides, Richard Owens. The lake is called &quot;Patsiata&quot; by the Mono people.

During the late Pleistocene, Owens Lake could reach a depth of and formed part of an interconnected series of 7 lakes, hundreds of miles long. The increased inflow from the Owens River, from melting glaciers of the post-Ice Age Sierra Nevada, caused Owens Lake to overflow south through Rose Valley into another now-dry lake bed named China Lake in the Indian Wells Valley, near Ridgecrest and a town that sports its name. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the depth of the lake varied between , covering an area of around , and sometimes overflowed to the south, after which the water would flow into the Mojave Desert. By 1905, the lake&#x27;s water was &quot;excessively saline&quot;.

Starting in 1913, the river and streams that fed Owens Lake were diverted by Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) into the Los Angeles Aqueduct, and the lake level started to drop quickly. As the lake dried, soda processing at nearby Keeler, California, switched from relatively cheap chemical methods to more expensive physical ones. The Natural Soda Products Company sued the city of Los Angeles and built a new plant with a $15,000 settlement. A fire destroyed this plant shortly after it was built, but the company rebuilt it on the dry lake bed in the 1920s.

During the unusually wet winter of 1937, LADWP diverted water from the aqueduct into the lake bed, flooding the soda plant. Because of this, the courts ordered the city to pay $154,000. After an unsuccessful appeal to the state supreme court in 1941, LADWP built the Long Valley Dam, which impounded Lake Crowley for flood control.

A 2004 court order required the LADWP to reestablish a small flow from the river into the lake. In winter 2006, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power restored 5% of the pre-aqueduct flow to the river by court order, allowing the Owens River Gorge, the river bed in the valley, and Owens Lake to contain a small amount of water. The lake was the epicenter of a magnitude 5.8 earthquake that occurred on June 24, 2020.

In 2022, the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District successfully sued LADWP for the department&#x27;s refusal to implement &quot;low-impact&quot; pollution controls at Owens Lake in an area with sensitive Native American cultural resources.

In 2023, the lake flooded for the first time in over 100 years due to the numerous storms that struck California during the first three months of 2023, increasing in volume from 5,000 acre-feet to about 50,000 acre-feet. Environmental groups are currently working with Indigenous leaders in hopes of keeping more water in the lake.

The lake is a large salt flat whose surface is made of a mixture of clay, sand, and a variety of minerals including halite, burkeite, mirabilite, thenardite, and trona. In wet years, these minerals form a chemical soup in the form of a small brine pond within the dry lake. When conditions are right, bright pink halophilic (salt-loving) archaea spread across the salty lake bed. Also, on especially hot summer days when ground temperatures exceed 150° F (66 °C), water is driven out of the hydrates on the lake bed creating a muddy brine. More commonly, periodic winds stir up noxious alkali dust storms that carry away as much as four million tons (3.6 million metric tons) of dust from the lake bed each year, causing respiratory problems in nearby residents. The dust includes carcinogens, such as cadmium, nickel and arsenic.

== Management ==

The LADWP and the California State Lands Commission own most of the Owens Lake bed, though a few small parcels along the historic western shoreline are privately owned. CDFW is using mitigation funds from CalTrans to enhance habitat.

As part of an air quality mitigation settlement, LADWP is shallow flooding of the salt pan to try to help minimize alkali dust storms and further adverse health effects. There are also about of managed vegetation being used as a dust control measure. The vegetation consists of saltgrass, which is a native perennial grass highly tolerant of the salt and boron levels in the lake sediments. Gravel covers are also used.

== Ecology ==

This once-blue saline lake was an important feeding and resting stop for millions of waterfowl each year. During a visit to Owens Lake in 1917 Joseph Grinnell from the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology in Berkeley reported &quot;Great numbers of water birds are in sight along the lake shore--avocets, phalaropes, ducks. Large flocks of shorebirds in flight over the water in the distance, wheeling about show in mass, now silvery now dark, against the gray-blue of the water. There must be literally thousands of birds within sight of this one spot&quot;.

Owens Lake is recognized as an Important Bird Area in California by the National Audubon Society. At the shore, a chain of wetlands, fed by springs and artesian wells, keep part of the former Owens Lake ecosystem alive. Snowy plovers nest at Owens along with several thousand snow geese and ducks. As a result of dust mitigation efforts, shallow flooding of the lake bed has created habitats approximately deep. This water, although seasonally applied, is helping to buoy the lake&#x27;s ecosystem causing hope in conservationists that an expanded shallow flooding program could do even more. There are no plans to restore Owens to anything resembling a conventional lake.

On April 19, 2008, the Eastern Sierra Audubon Society, Audubon California, and the Owens Valley Committee held the first lake-wide survey of the bird populations of Owens Lake. Volunteers recorded a total of 112 avian species and 45,650 individual birds — the highest total number of birds ever officially recorded at Owens Lake. Volunteers identified 15 species of waterfowl (ducks and geese) and 22 species of shorebirds. The highest totals for individuals of a species included 13,873 California gulls (an inland nester at Mono Lake and elsewhere); 9,218 American avocets; 1,767 eared grebes; 13,826 &quot;peeps&quot; or small sandpipers such as dunlin, western and least sandpipers; and 2,882 individual ducks.

===Public access===

In 2004, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) acquired a parcel at the foot of Owens Lake. Designated the Cartago Wildlife Area in 2007, it is one of the few remaining spring and wetland areas on the shore of Owens Lake. The site is open year-round for viewing numerous bird species attracted to the ponds and wetlands as well as the ruins of a historic soda ash plant from the World War I era and the 1920s.

== Industry ==

===Cerro Gordo Mines===

The town of Cartago, below the Sierra Nevada near present-day Olancha, California, was the western shipping port for the Cerro Gordo Mines production and transported goods across Owens Lake with the northern ports of Swansea and Keeler directly below the mines. From Cartago a barge-like vessel, the &quot;Bessie Brady,&quot; was launched in 1872, which cut the three-day freight journey around the lake down to three hours.

Much of the freight it carried was silver and lead bullion from the Cerro Gordo mines, which at their height were so productive that the bars of the refined metals waited in large stacks before twenty-mule team teamsters could haul it to Los Angeles. The trying three-week (one way) journey improved after the formation of the Cerro Gordo Freighting Company, run by ancestors of regional historian Remi Nadeau who has written of this period.

The town of Keeler, below the Inyo Mountains on the former north shore, replaced Swansea as the shipping port for the mines after the 1872 Lone Pine earthquake. In the 1870s it had a population of 5,000 people as the center of trade for the Cerro Gordo mines.

The Cottonwood Charcoal Kilns, traditional stone masonry &#x27;beehive&#x27; charcoal kilns, were built to transform wood from trees in Cottonwood Canyon above the lake into charcoal, to feed the Cerro Gordo mines&#x27; silver and lead smelters across the lake at Swansea. The ruins are located on the southern side of the lake bed near Cartago. They were similar to the nearby Panamint Charcoal Kilns near Death Valley. The kilns are identified as California Historical Landmark #537.

===Other enterprises===

In 1879 silver mining ended, but Keeler was saved when the Carson and Colorado Railroad built narrow-gauge rail tracks to the town. It then became a soda, salt, and marble shipping center until 1960. The rail line had been sold to Southern Pacific Railroad in 1900. Keeler&#x27;s current population is around 50 people and continues in decline.

In the 20th century the Clark Chemical Company operated on the northwestern shore at Bartlett, with evaporation ponds for lake brine and a plant to extract its chemicals.

Mineral extraction plants around the lake include:
* Inyo Development Company, 1887–1920
* Natural Soda Products Company/Michigan Alkali Company/Wyandotte Chemical Corporation, 1912–1953
* California Alkali Company/Inyo Chemical Company, 1917–1932
* Pacific Alkali/Columbia-Southern Chemical Corp./Pittsburgh Plate Glass, 1928–1968
* Permanente Metals Corporation, 1947–1950
* Morrison and Weatherly Chemical Corporation (M&amp;W)/Lake Minerals Corporation (LMC)/Cominco American Inc./Owens Lake Soda Ash Company (OLSAC)/U.S. Borax/Rio Tinto Minerals, 1962–present. Rio Tinto Minerals has mineral lease renewals through 2048.

==In popular culture==

Numerous Western films have been shot by Owens Lake, including &quot;Westward Ho&quot; (1935), &quot;Maverick&quot; (1994), &quot;Riders of the Dawn&quot; (1937), &quot;Across the Plains&quot; (1939), &quot;Stage to Tucson&quot; (1951), &quot;From Hell to Texas&quot; (1958) and &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; (1966).

Other films that had scenes shot at Owens Lake or the nearby Alabama Hills where Owens Lake is visible includes &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986), and &quot;Tremors&quot; (1990).

<doc id="320970" wikidata="Q3516339" url="?curid=320970" title="Sales taxes in Canada">
<text>In Canada, there are two types of sales taxes levied. These are :
*Provincial sales taxes or PST (), levied by the provinces. 
*[[Goods and services tax (Canada)|Goods and services tax]] or GST () / [[Harmonized sales tax]] or HST (), a value-added tax levied by the federal government. The GST applies nationally. The HST includes the provincial portion of the sales tax but is administered by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and is applied under the same legislation as the GST. The HST is in effect in Ontario, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.

Every province except Alberta has implemented either a provincial sales tax or the Harmonized Sales Tax. The federal GST rate is 5 percent, effective January 1, 2008.

The territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut have no territorial sales taxes, so only the GST is collected. The three northern jurisdictions are partially subsidized by the federal government, and their residents receive some additional tax concessions due to the high cost of living in the north.

==Provincial sales taxes==

Separate provincial sales taxes (PST) are collected in the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba (retail sales tax or RST) and Quebec (Quebec sales tax or QST, French: Taxe de vente du Québec or TVQ). Prince Edward Island switched to a HST on April 1, 2013, the same date that British Columbia reverted to a separate GST/PST after their adoption of a HST in 2000 was rejected in a referendum. Goods to which the tax is applied vary by province, as does the rate. In all provinces where the provincial sales tax is collected, the tax is imposed on the sale price without GST (in the past, in Quebec and in Prince Edward Island, PST was applied to the combined sum of sale price and GST). Of the provincial sales taxes, only the QST is a value-added tax.

== New housing rebate ==
Sales taxes on new or significantly renovated housing used as a primary residence may be eligible to have a portion of charged federal and provincial sales taxes rebated. New homes valued up to $450,000 may be eligible for a 36% rebate on GST charged up to a maximum of $6,300. Provincial sales tax rebate programs on new housing are offered in Ontario, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, and Quebec (for QST). Terms and conditions vary by province.

<doc id="320977" wikidata="Q2084556" url="?curid=320977" title="Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford">
<text>Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford ( – 28 July 1585) of Chenies in Buckinghamshire and of Bedford House in Exeter, Devon, was an English nobleman, soldier, and politician. He was a godfather to the Devon-born sailor Sir Francis Drake. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Devon (1584-5).

==Early life==
Francis was the son of John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford and Anne Sapcote. He was educated at King&#x27;s Hall, Cambridge and accompanied his father, to sit in the House of Commons. He represented Buckinghamshire in parliament in 1545–47 and 1547–52. In 1547 he was appointed High Sheriff of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. He assisted to quell the rising in Devon in 1549, and after his father had been created Earl of Bedford in January 1550, was known as Lord Russell, taking his seat in the House of Lords under this title in 1552.

Russell was in sympathy with reformers, whose opinions he shared, and was in communication with Sir Thomas Wyatt; and in consequence of his religious attitude was imprisoned during the earlier part of Mary&#x27;s reign. Being released he visited Italy, and came into touch with foreign reformers. He led the English contingent fighting for Philip II of Spain, then England&#x27;s King Consort, at the Battle of St. Quentin in 1557.

==Elizabeth I==
When Elizabeth I of England ascended the throne in November 1558 the Earl of Bedford, as Russell had been since 1555, became an active figure in public life. He was made a privy councillor, and was sent on diplomatic errands to Charles IX of France and Mary, Queen of Scots.

From February 1564 to October 1567 he was governor of Berwick and warden of the east marches of Scotland, in which capacity he conducted various negotiations between Elizabeth and Mary. Bedford represented Elizabeth as her ambassador at the baptism of Prince James on 17 December 1566 at Stirling Castle, and was guest of honour at the subsequent banquet and masque. Mary, Queen of Scots gave him a gold chain set with pearls, diamonds, and rubies. After the baptism, Mary&#x27;s half-brother James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray took him on a tour of Fife. They visited St Andrews and Hallyards, a house of William Kirkcaldy of Grange.

He appears to have been an efficient border warden, but was irritated by the vacillating and tortuous conduct of the English queen. When the northern insurrection broke out in 1569, Bedford was sent into Wales, and he sat in judgment upon the Duke of Norfolk in 1572.

In 1576 he was president of the council of Wales. In 1581 he was one of the commissioners deputed to arrange a marriage between Elizabeth and François, Duke of Anjou. Bedford, who was made a Knight of the Garter in 1564, appears to have been a generous and popular man, and died in London in 1585.

==Personal life==
His first wife was Margaret (née St John) Gostwick (1533–1562), a widow of Sir John Gostwick. Margaret was a daughter of Sir John St John (great-grandson of Margaret Beauchamp of Bletso) and Margaret Waldegrave (a daughter of Sir William Waldegrave). Together, they were the parents of four sons and three daughters:

* Lady Anne Russell (1548–1603), who married Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick.
* Henry Russell, Baron Russell (1551–1572), who married his step-sister, Jane Sybilla Morrison of Cashiobury, without issue.
* John Russell, Baron Russell (–1584), who married Elizabeth Hoby, widow of Sir Thomas Hoby and daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke. They had one son, Francis, who died young, and two daughters, which included Anne Russell, wife of Henry Somerset, 1st Marquess of Worcester.
* Francis Russell, Baron Russell (–1585), MP for Northumberland, from 1572 to 1584; captured at the Raid of the Redeswire in 1575, mortally wounded in a fray on the Scottish border, dying hours before his father. He married Juliana Foster and had issue, including Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford.
* William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh (–1613), the Lord Deputy of Ireland who married Elizabeth Long, granddaughter of Sir Richard Long. They had one son, Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford.
* Lady Elizabeth Russell (d. 1605), who married William Bourchier, 3rd Earl of Bath.
* Lady Margaret Russell (1560–1616), who married George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland.

Lady Bedford died on 27 August 1562. Bedford married his second wife, Bridget Manners, the Dowager Countess of Rutland (d. 1601), on 25 June 1566. Lady Rutland, a daughter of John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford and Lady Anne Grey (a daughter of George Grey, 2nd Earl of Kent), had been twice widowed; first from Ambassador Sir Richard Morrison of Cashiobury in 1556, and second from Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland in 1563.

Lord Bedford died in London on 28 July 1585. He was buried at the family chapel at St. Michael&#x27;s Church next to Chenies Manor House, the family estate which he had made his principal home and where he had entertained Queen Elizabeth in 1570. He was succeeded as third Earl by his grandson, Edward Russell (1572–1627), only son of Francis Russell, Lord Russell.

===Descendants===
Through his grandson, Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford (1587–1641) who was born two years after Lord Bedford&#x27;s death in 1585, he was a great-grandfather of William Russell (1616–1700) who married Lady Anne Carr (a daughter of Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset) and became the 5th Earl of Bedford before he was created Duke of Bedford and Marquess of Tavistock on 11 May 1694.

<doc id="320979" wikidata="Q290343" url="?curid=320979" title="David Starr Jordan">
<text>David Starr Jordan (January 19, 1851 – September 19, 1931) was the founding president of Stanford University, serving from 1891 to 1913. He was an ichthyologist during his research career. Prior to serving as president of Stanford University, he served as president of Indiana University from 1884 to 1891.

Jordan was also a strong supporter of eugenics, and his published views expressed a fear of &quot;race-degeneration&quot;, asserting that cattle and human beings are &quot;governed by the same laws of selection&quot;. He was an antimilitarist since he believed that war killed off the best members of the gene pool, and he initially opposed American involvement in World War I.

==Early life and education==
Jordan was born in Gainesville, New York, and grew up on a farm in upstate New York. His parents made an unorthodox decision to educate him at a local girls&#x27; high school. His middle name, Starr, does not appear in early census records, and was apparently self-selected; he had begun using it by the time that he was enrolled at Cornell. He said that it was in honor of his mother&#x27;s devotion to the minister Thomas Starr King.

He was inspired by Louis Agassiz to pursue his studies in ichthyology. He was part of the first freshman class of undergraduates at Cornell University, where he graduated in 1872 with a master&#x27;s degree in botany.

In his autobiography, &quot;The Days of a Man&quot;, he wrote, &quot;During the three years which followed [my entrance as a &#x27;belated&#x27; freshman in March 1869], I completed all the requirements for a degree of Bachelor of Science, besides about two year of advanced work in Botany. Taking this last into consideration, the faculty conferred on me at graduation in June 1872, the advanced degree of Master of Science instead of the conventional Bachelor&#x27;s Degree ... it was afterward voted not to grant any second degree within a year after the Bachelor had been received. I was placed, quite innocently, in the position of being the only graduate of Cornell to merge two degrees into one.&quot; His master&#x27;s thesis was on the topic &quot;The Wild Flowers of Wyoming County&quot;.

Jordan initially taught natural history courses at several small Midwestern colleges and secondary schools, including at Indianapolis High School. 

In 1875, while in Indianapolis, Jordan obtained a Doctor of Medicine degree from Indiana Medical College in 1875. The Indiana Medical College in Indianapolis opened in 1869, but merged out of existence in 1878. Standards at the college were not particularly high. Jordan himself, reflecting on the experience noted that &quot;I was also able to spend some time in the Medical College, from which, in the spring of 1875, I received the (scarcely earned) degree of Doctor of Medicine, though it had not at all been my intention to enter that profession.&quot; The following year, in 1876, Jordan taught comparative anatomy at the college. 

Jordan also holds an honorary PhD, awarded to him by Butler University in 1877.

==Career==
In 1879, Jordan was accepted into the natural history faculty of Indiana University Bloomington, where he served as a professor of zoology. His teaching included his version of eugenics, which &quot;sought to prevent the decay of the Anglo-Saxon/Nordic race by limiting racial mixing and by preventing the reproduction of those he deemed unfit.&quot;

===Indiana University president===
In 1885, he was named president of Indiana University and became the nation&#x27;s youngest university president at only 34 and the first Indiana University president who was not an ordained minister.

He improved the university&#x27;s finances and public image, doubled its enrollment, and instituted an elective system; like Cornell&#x27;s, it was an early application of the modern liberal arts curriculum.

===Stanford University president===

In March 1891, he was approached by Leland and Jane Stanford, who offered him the presidency of Leland Stanford Junior University, which was about to open in California. Andrew Dickson White, the co-founder and first president of Cornell University, who offered him the position, recommended Jordan to the Stanfords based on an educational philosophy fit with the Stanfords&#x27; vision of a nonsectarian co-educational school with a liberal arts curriculum. Jordan quickly accepted the offer, arrived at Stanford in June 1891, and immediately set about recruiting faculty for the university&#x27;s planned September opening. Pressed for time, he drew heavily on his own acquaintances; most of the 15 founding professors came either from Cornell or Indiana University. That first year at Stanford, Jordan was instrumental in establishing the university&#x27;s Hopkins Marine Station. He served Stanford as president until 1913 and then chancellor until his retirement in 1916. The university decided not to renew his three-year-term as chancellor in 1916. As the years went on, Jordan became increasingly alienated from the university.

While he was chancellor, he was elected president of the National Education Association. Jordan was a member in the Bohemian Club and the University Club in San Francisco. Jordan served as a director of the Sierra Club from 1892 to 1903. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1905.

====David Starr Jordan House====

In 1905, he was one of the first professors to build a summer home at the northeast corner of Camino Real and 7th Avenue, on what became known as &quot;Professors&#x27; Row&quot; in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. He was good friends with Stanford University professor of entomology Vernon Lyman Kellogg, who also lived in Carmel.

===Eugenics===

In 1899, Jordan delivered an essay at Stanford on behalf of racial segregation and racial purity. In the essay, Jordan claimed that &quot;For a race of men or a herd of cattle are governed by the same laws of selection.&quot; Jordan expressed great fears and phobias for &quot;race degeneration&quot; that would result unless great endeavors were put forward to maintain &quot;racial unity&quot;.

===Eugenics-based argument against war===
One of Jordan&#x27;s main theses in the essay was that his goals for an ideal society are better engendered by peace than war. His argument against warfare contended that it is detrimental because it removes the strongest men from the gene pool. Jordan asserted, &quot;Future war is impossible because the nations cannot afford it.&quot; As one commentator put it, &quot;Though he found meager evidence to support his preconceptions, he still confidently asserted that &#x27;always and everywhere, war means the reversal of natural selection.

Jordan was president of the World Peace Foundation from 1910 to 1914 and president of the World Peace Conference in 1915 and initially opposed American entry into World War I although he changed his position in 1917 after he became convinced that a German victory would threaten democracy.

===&quot;The Blood of the Nation&quot;===
Soon after it was first delivered, the essay was published by the American Unitarian Association (copyright 1902) under the main title of &quot;The Blood of the Nation&quot; and a subtitle of &quot;A Study of the Decay of Races Through the Survival of the Unfit.&quot; Multiple editions of that version followed over the next few years.

An expanded version of the essay was delivered in Philadelphia at the 200th anniversary of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s birth in 1906 and printed by the American Philosophical Society. The following year, an expanded version of the original essay with an embossed cover was published by Beacon Press in Boston under the new main title &quot;The Human Harvest&quot; and the same subtitle. This new version was dedicated to Jordan&#x27;s older brother Rufus, who had volunteered to fight in the American Civil War and, according to Jordan, was part of the &quot;&#x27;Human Harvest&#x27; of 1862.&quot; Jordan&#x27;s eugenic and anti-war views may have been in part shaped by the death of his brother in 1862 from a &#x27;camp fever,&#x27; likely typhoid, immediately after enlisting to fight in the American civil war.

In 1910, the original and slimmer version of the essay was again published by the American Unitarian Association in a &quot;less expensive form to insure the widest possible distribution.&quot;

In 1915, Jordan published an &quot;extended treatise on the same subject&quot; titled &quot;War and Breed&quot; again through the Beacon Press in Boston. Here Jordan defines and begins to employ the relatively recent term &quot;eugenics&quot; and its opposite &quot;dysgenics&quot;.

===Human Betterment Foundation===
After Jordan&#x27;s death, the Human Betterment Foundation, a political eugenics-advocacy organization that advocated for compulsory sterilization legislation in the United States, published a newspaper advertisement claiming Jordan as one of its prominent members. The Foundation published &quot;Sterilization for Human Betterment&quot;, advocating for legislation that would compel sterilization of the disabled and violent felons, allow for anyone in the public to voluntarily seek medical sterilization, and legalize the use of contraception.

==Role in apparent murder of Jane Stanford==
In 1905, Jordan launched an apparent coverup of the murder of Jane Stanford. While vacationing in Oahu, Stanford had suddenly died of strychnine poisoning according to the local coroner&#x27;s jury. Jordan then sailed to Hawaii, hired a physician to investigate the case, and declared she had in fact died of heart failure, a condition whose symptoms bear no relationship to those that were actually observed. His motive has been a subject of speculation. One possibility is that he was acting to protect the reputation of the university, since its finances were precarious, and a scandal might have damaged fundraising. He had written the president of Stanford&#x27;s board of trustees, offered several alternate explanations for Mrs. Stanford&#x27;s death, and suggested to select whichever would be most suitable. Since Mrs. Stanford had a difficult relationship with him and reportedly planned to remove him from his position at the university, he might also have had a personal motive to eliminate suspicions that might have swirled around an unsolved crime. Jordan&#x27;s version of Mrs. Stanford&#x27;s demise was largely accepted until the appearance of several publications in 2003 that emphasized the evidence that she was murdered.

==Retirement==
In retirement, Jordan remained active, writing on ichthyology, world relations, peace, and his autobiography.

==Lifetime honors and awards==
*1877 Honorary Ph.D. awarded by Butler University
*1886 Honorary LL.D. awarded by Cornell University
*1902 Honorary LL.D. awarded by Johns Hopkins University
*1909 Honorary LL.D. awarded by Indiana University

==Skepticism==
Although a proponent of eugenics, Jordan was skeptical of certain other pseudoscientific claims. He coined the term &quot;sciosophy&quot; to describe the &quot;systematized ignorance&quot; of the pseudoscientist. His later work, &quot;The Higher Foolishness&quot;, inspired the philosopher Martin Gardner to write his treatise on scientific skepticism, &quot;Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science&quot;. However, Gardner noted that &quot;the book is infuriating because although Jordan mentions the titles of dozens of crank works, from which he quotes extensively, he seldom tells you the names of the authors.&quot;

==Personal life==

Jordan married Susan Bowen (1845–1885), a biologist and a graduate of Mount Holyoke College, whom he met at Louis Agassiz&#x27;s Penikese Island Summer School of Science, in her hometown of Peru, Massachusetts, on March 10, 1875. She died at age 39, after 10 years of marriage, following a brief illness. Bowen was six years Jordan&#x27;s senior. They had three children: the educator Edith Monica (1877–1965), Harold Bowen (1882–1959), and Thora (1884–1886).

Jordan later married Jessie Knight (1866–1952) in 1887. At the time of their marriage, two years after his first wife&#x27;s death, Knight was 21 years old and Jordan was 36. They met while he was serving as president of Indiana University. He and his second wife had three children: Knight Starr (1888–1947), Barbara (1891–1900), and Eric Knight (1903–1926).

Two of his daughters, Thora and Barbara, died in childhood. His son Eric died in 1926 at age 22 in a traffic accident near Gilroy, California. Eric had participated in a paleontological expedition to the Revillagigedo Islands and was considering an academic career.

==Death==
On September 19, 1931, Jordan died at his home on the Stanford University campus after suffering a series of strokes over two years.

==Monuments and memorials==

===Geographical landmarks===
*Jordan Lake in the Uinta Mountains in Utah at 
*Mount Jordan, a mountain peak in Tulare County, California, located on the crest of the Kings-Kern divide of the west slope of the Sierra Nevadas at was named in 1926 in honor of Jordan by the United States Geographic Board at the behest of the Sierra Club. Jordan commented that it was not the first mountain named in his honor since the first such mountain did not retain his name since it already had a name.

In July 2020, the president of the Sierra Club denounced Jordan and its other early leaders for being &quot;vocal advocates for white supremacy and its pseudo-scientific arm, eugenics.&quot; The president also announced, &quot;We will also spend the next year studying our history and determining which of our monuments need to be renamed or pulled down entirely.&quot; It is not yet clear how their reassessment would affect the status of Mount Jordan, which the club had helped to name in 1926, or that of other geographic features that bear Jordan&#x27;s name.

===Namesake Tree===
The David Starr Jordan &quot;Namesake Tree&quot; at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Campus Arboretum, an Indian rubber tree, known as &quot;Ficus elastica&quot;, was given to Jordan at the outset of a trip to Japan, and planted by him on December 11, 1922, now listed as an Exceptional Tree of Hawai‘i.

===Fishery research vessel===
In 1966, the fisheries research ship &quot;David Starr Jordan&quot; was commissioned for service with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service″s Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. The ship later served in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fleet as NOAAS &quot;David Starr Jordan&quot; (R 444) before it was decommissioned in 2010 and sold to a private company, who renamed it the R/V &quot;Ocean Starr&quot;.

===Schools named or formerly named for David Starr Jordan===
During the early 20th century several schools were named after him or in his honor. However, after 2018, most of them were renamed, as his eugenics activities became well known.

* David Starr Jordan High School in Los Angeles, was established in 1923; in 2020 the name was shortened to Jordan High School to remove the reference to him while keeping &quot;Jordan&quot; as a generic legacy name for alumni.
* Jordan High School in Long Beach, California, established in 1934, was still named for him when the school district last explored its possible renaming in mid-2020. Three years later, a Long Beach middle school teacher tried to get the school board to restart the renaming process in October 2023, but nothing resulted from the attempt.
* Jordan Middle School in Palo Alto, California, established in 1937, was renamed in 2018 for African-American memory chip inventor Frank S. Greene.
* David Starr Jordan Middle School in Burbank, California, established in the 1940s, was renamed in 2021 for labor leader and civil rights activist Dolores Huerta.

===Campus buildings===
Since Jordan was closely associated with both Indiana University and Stanford University, both schools named buildings and other campus features after him. However, as his reputation became more controversial in the 2020s, they acted to remove Jordan&#x27;s name from their respective campuses.

====Stanford University====
Stanford honored its former president in 1917 by renaming its zoology building, built in 1899, to Jordan Hall. Other campus features were named Jordan Quad, Jordan Modulars, and Jordan Way. In October 2020 the Stanford Board of Trustees voted unanimously, on the recommendation of an advisory committee, to remove Jordan&#x27;s name from all four facilities. The former Jordan Hall was to be referred to as Building 420 until a permanent name could be selected sometime the following year. Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne was charged to rename Jordan Quad and Jordan Modulars; however, Tessier-Lavigne was not able to accomplish this task before he left Stanford in 2023. The advisory committee also recommended that the renaming of Jordan Way, a street on the medical campus, &quot;may take place during the course of ongoing construction and planning.&quot;

====Indiana University====
When Indiana University built a new building for its biology department in 1956, the building was named in honor of Jordan, its former president and biology faculty member. In October 2020 the Indiana University Board of Trustees voted overwhelmingly to remove Jordan&#x27;s name from the biology building as well as a parking garage and a &quot;river&quot; (actually a small creek) that runs through the center of the campus. Jordan&#x27;s name was stripped from these places immediately after the trustee meeting had concluded, and they were given temporary, generic names to be used until permanent names could be selected the following year. Jordan Hall, the Jordan River and the Jordan Avenue Parking Garage became respectively the Biology Building, the Campus River, and the East Parking Garage. In August 2021, staff members of the Biology Department sent a petition to the new IU President Pamela Whitten urging the university leadership to rename the Biology Building in honor of James P. Holland, an African-American IU alumnus, award-winning former faculty member and endocrinologist who died in 1998.

Indiana President President Michael McRobbie requested the University Naming Committee to work with the city of Bloomington to find a name as a replacement for Jordan Avenue, a thoroughfare that is owned in part by IU and in part by the city. , there were calls in the Bloomington City Council for Jordan Avenue to be renamed. In April 2021, the Mayor of Bloomington created a seven-member task force to investigate possible replacement names for Jordan Avenue. In September 2021, the City of Bloomington Plan Commission announced that it approved the renaming of Jordan Avenue to Eagleson Avenue while IU is in the process of renaming its section of the street to Fuller Lane pending approval by the IU Renaming Committee and IU&#x27;s board of trustees. The city planned to complete their street renaming by February 2022. Both new street names honor prominent African-American families who moved to Bloomington after being born into slavery. In December 2021, IU&#x27;s board of trustees reconsidered their decision to rename the university&#x27;s section of the street as Fuller Lane by adopting Eagleson Avenue as the new name for the University-owned section of Jordan Avenue.

, Indiana University South Bend campus has a scholarship named in honor of Jordan that enables its students to study outside of the United States for a short period.

===Cornell&#x27;s David Starr Jordan Prize (1986–2020)===
Starting in 1986, the David Starr Jordan Prize was funded as a joint endowment by Cornell University, Indiana University, and Stanford University. Every three years it was awarded to a young scientist (under 40 years) who made contributions in one of Jordan&#x27;s interests of evolution, ecology, population or organismal biology. The prize was last awarded in 2015 to a biology professor at the University of Texas at Austin.

As Jordan&#x27;s reputation became more controversial over his support of eugenics, and particularly after the removal of Jordan&#x27;s name from buildings on the campuses of Stanford and Indiana universities in 2020, there were calls to rename the prize. The prize was officially discontinued in 2020 and the endowment funds were returned to their respective universities.

<text>Genyornis newtoni is an extinct species of large, flightless bird that lived in Australia during the Pleistocene Epoch until around 50,000 years ago. Over two metres in height, they were likely herbivorous. Many other species of Australian megafauna became extinct in Australia around that time, coinciding with the arrival of humans. It is the last known member of the extinct flightless bird family Dromornithidae which had been part of the fauna of the Australian continent for over 30 million years. They are not closely related to ratites such as emus, and their closest living relatives are thought to be fowl.

== Taxonomy ==
The species was first described in 1896 by Edward Charles Stirling and A. H. C. Zeitz, the authors giving the epithet &quot;newtoni&quot; for the Cambridge professor Alfred Newton.
The name of the genus is derived from the ancient Greek &quot;γένυς&quot; (&quot;génus&quot;) &#x27;jaw; chin&#x27; and &quot;ὄρνις&quot; (&quot;órnis&quot;) &#x27;bird&#x27;, because of the relatively large size of the lower mandible.
The specimen is a left femur. It was found at Lake Callabonna in South Australia. The excavation was undertaken and described by Zietz. A description of the excavation was reported in &quot;Nature&quot; which had also unearthed material recognised as marsupials. 

Numerous fragments of avian fossils were noticed in the clay surrounding the removal of diprotodont fossils, then largely complete specimens including crucial evidence of the crania emerged from the site.
The paper reviewed previously described fossil remains of &quot;struthious [ostrich-like] birds in Australia&quot;, which had either been assigned to the ancient emus of &quot;Dromaius&quot; or the only described species of &quot;Dromornis&quot;, &quot;D. australis&quot; Owen.

A letter from George Hurst concerning the discovery of a partial skeleton of the species alerted Stirling to its existence in 1893.

The placement of this dromornithid species may be summarised as:

Dromornithidae (8 species in 4 genera)
* &quot;Dromornis&quot; 
* &quot;Barawertornis&quot;
* &quot;Ilbandornis&quot; Rich, 1979
* Genyornis
:*Genyornis newtoni Stirling &amp; Zietz, 1896

== Description ==
&quot;Genyornis newtoni&quot; was a medium-sized dromornithid with a robust body, measuring up to tall and weighing around , though body mass estimation may vary based on different methods. While larger than &quot;Ilbandornis&quot;, it did not attain the height and weight of &quot;Dromornis stirtoni&quot; or &quot;Dromornis planei&quot;. The fossils of the species have been found remaining in articulation, and no other dromornithid species has been discovered in this state. The remains of eggs have also been attributed to this species. Gastroliths belonging to these animals have been found alongside their remains, a feature that has revealed the sometimes shallow site of fossils.

Prior to 2024, reconstructions of the skull of &quot;Genyornis&quot; were primarily based on those of its closest relatives, due to the heavily damaged nature of the holotype. However, a 2024 study on the skull morphology of &quot;Genyornis&quot;, incorporating a recently-discovered well-preserved skull, found the physical appearance of the head of &quot;Genyornis&quot; to be much more different than previously believed. Namely, the bill was found to be much more goose-like, with a raised triangular casque. This goose-like bill differed from even other mihirungs, and may have been a specialization for feeding on aquatic vegetation. Other potential adaptations to an aquatic feeding style may have allowed for protection of the ears and throat when submerging their heads in water.

== Distribution ==
This mihirung has been found at sites in South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, dating to the Pleistocene Epoch. &quot;Genyornis newtoni&quot; is the only species of dromornithid known to have existed during the Pleistocene.

== Extinction==
Two main theories propose a cause for megafauna extinction - human impact and changing climate. A study has been performed in which more than 700 &quot;Genyornis&quot; eggshell fragments were dated. Through this, it was determined that &quot;Genyornis&quot; declined and became extinct over a short period—too short for it to be plausibly explained by climate variability. The authors considered this to be a very good indication that the entire mass extinction event in Australia was due to human activity, rather than climate change.

A 2015 study collected egg shell fragments of &quot;Genyornis&quot; from around 200 sites that show burn marks. Analysis of amino acids in the egg shells showed a thermal gradient consistent with the egg being placed on an ember fire. The egg shells were dated to between 53.9 and 43.4 thousand years BP, suggesting that humans were collecting and cooking &quot;Genyornis&quot; eggs in the thousands of years before their extinction. A later study suggested that the eggs actually belonged to the giant malleefowl, a species of extinct megapode. 

A 2022 study examined the protein sequences of these unidentified eggshells and, through phylogenetic analysis, concluded that the lineage that produced these eggs diverged prior to the emergence of megapodes, supporting the previous implication that the eggs in question were produced by &quot;Genyornis.&quot; The authors noted that the exploitation of &quot;Genyornis&quot; eggs appears to mirror that of earlier human usage of ostrich eggs throughout the Pleistocene in Northern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Southwestern and Northern Asia, and present-day India and China, though they were unable to determine to what extent humans interacted with &quot;Genyornis&quot;. 

A 2021 study found that, if &quot;Genyornis&quot; eggs were being consumed at similar rates to the eggs of the emu and the Australian brushturkey, then &quot;Genyornis&quot; would have become extinct at far lower rates of total consumption than these still-extant birds.

In May 2010, archaeologists announced the rediscovery of an Aboriginal rock art painting, possibly 40,000 years old, at the Nawarla Gabarnmung rock art site in the Northern Territory, that they suggested depicts two &quot;Genyornis&quot; individuals. In 2011, late survival of &quot;Genyornis&quot; in temperate south west Victoria was suggested, based on Aboriginal traditions. A later study suggested that the painting could not be more than 14,000 years old, long after the bird is thought to have gone extinct, and it could not be morphologically distinguished from depictions of other birds.

In a 2022 study, fossil evidence suggests that the population of &quot;Genyornis&quot; at Lake Callabonna died around 50,000 years ago, as the lake dried up as the climate changed and became drier. The birds recovered from the site seemed to have been particularly prone to osteomyelitis, as a result of getting stuck in the mud of the drying lake bed as the water receded. Eventually, when the lake dried, the population was left without their main source of water and subsequently died out.

A 2024 study of the skull morphology of &quot;Genyornis&quot; found apparent adaptations to feeding on aquatic plants, making them closely tied to freshwater habitats. A reliance on these habitats may have made the species uniquely vulnerable to the loss of freshwater lakes during the aridification of Australia during the late Pleistocene, potentially leading to its extinction.

<text>Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford PC (1587 – 9 May 1641) was an English nobleman and politician. He built the square of Covent Garden, with the piazza and St Paul&#x27;s Church, employing Inigo Jones as his architect. He is also known for his pioneering project to drain The Fens of Cambridgeshire.

==Early life==

He was the only son of William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh and his wife Elizabeth Long, to which barony he succeeded in August 1613. For a short time previously he had been Member of Parliament for the borough of Lyme Regis. In 1623 he was made Lord Lieutenant of Devon and on 3 May 1627 became Earl of Bedford on the death of his cousin Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford.

In 1621 Russell was one of the thirty-three peers who petitioned James I on the prejudice caused to the English peerage by the lavish grant of Irish and Scottish titles of nobility. In 1628, during the debates on the &quot;Petition of Right&quot;, he supported the demands of the House of Commons, and was a member of the committee which reported against the king&#x27;s right to imprison. In May he was sent down to Devon, ostensibly to assist in refitting the fleet returned from Rochelle, but according to report, on account of his opposition in the House of Lords. Bedford was one of the three peers implicated in the circulation of Sir Robert Dudley&#x27;s &quot;Proposition for His Majesty s Service&quot; (the others being William Seymour, Earl of Hertford, John Holles, 1st Earl of Clare and Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington), was arrested on 5 November 1629, and was brought before the Star-chamber. The prosecution, however, was dropped when the real nature of the paper was discovered, and Bedford was quickly released.

==Politician of the parliamentary crisis==

The Short Parliament meeting in April 1640 found the earl as one of King Charles I leading opponents. He was greatly trusted by John Pym and Oliver St John, and is mentioned by Clarendon as among the &quot;great contrivers and designers&quot; in the House of Lords. In July 1640 he was among the peers who wrote to the Scottish leaders refusing to invite a Scottish army into England, but promising to stand by the Scots in all legal and honourable ways. His signature was afterwards forged by Thomas, Viscount Savile, in order to encourage the Scots to invade England. In the following September he was among those peers who urged Charles to call a parliament, to make peace with the Scots, and to dismiss his obnoxious ministers; and was one of the English commissioners appointed to conclude the Treaty of Ripon.

When the Long Parliament met in November 1640, Bedford was generally regarded as the leader of the parliamentarians. In February 1641 he was made a privy councillor, and during the course of some negotiations was promised the office of Lord High Treasurer. He was essentially a moderate man, and seemed anxious to settle the question of the royal revenue in a satisfactory manner. He did not wish to alter the government of the church, was on good terms with Archbishop Laud, and, although convinced of the guilt of Strafford, was anxious to save his life. In the midst of the parliamentary struggle, Bedford died of smallpox on 9 May 1641.

Clarendon described him as &quot;a wise man, and of too great and plentiful a fortune to wish the subversion of the government&quot;, and again referring to his death, said that &quot;many who knew him well thought his death not unseasonable as well to his fame as his fortune, and that it rescued him as well from some possible guilt as from those visible misfortunes which men of all conditions have since undergone&quot;.

==Estate development==
In about 1631 with architect Inigo Jones, he built the square of Covent Garden, with the piazza and St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden. He was threatened with a Star-chamber suit for contravening the proclamation against new buildings, but the matter seems to have been resolved by compromise.

Bedford was the head of those who undertook to drain the great level of The Fens of Cambridgeshire, which were renamed the &quot;Bedford Level&quot; in his honour. He and the other undertakers were to receive 95,000 acres of land, of which 12,000 were to be set apart for the king, and the profits of 40,000 were to serve as a security for keeping up the drainage works. He spent a large sum of money on this work, and received 43,000 acres (174 km2) of land; but the project involved him in great difficulties. By 1637 he had spent £100,000 on the undertaking but after various jealousies and difficulties, the king took the work into his own hands in 1638, making a further grant of land to the Earl. The work was not declared finished till March 1653, twelve years after Bedford&#x27;s death.

==Marriage and children==
Bedford married Catherine Brydges (d. 1657), daughter of Giles Brydges, 3rd Baron Chandos and Frances Clinton. They lived at Corney House, Corney Reach, Chiswick. They had eight children:

*William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford (August 1616 – 7 September 1700).
*Francis Russell (d. circa April 1641).
*Colonel John Russell
*Edward Russell (d. 21 September 1665). Father by his wife Penelope Hill of Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford.
*Catherine Russell (d. 1 December 1676). Married Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke.
*Margaret Russell (d. 1676). Married first James Hay, 2nd Earl of Carlisle and secondly Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester.
*Anne Russell (d. 26 January 1697). Married George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol.
*Diana Russell (d. 30 January 1695). Married Francis Newport, 1st Earl of Bradford.

Lord Bedford died of smallpox in 1641 at the age of 48 and is buried in the &#x27;Bedford Chapel&#x27; at St Michael&#x27;s, Chenies.
Lady Bedford remained at Corney House until her death in 1657. Her son Edward inherited the house and later built Bedford House nearby.

<text>John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford (30 September 17105 January 1771) was a British Whig statesman and peer who served as the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1757 to 1761. A leading member of the Whig party during the Seven Years&#x27; War, he negotiated the 1763 Treaty of Paris which ended the conflict. Bedford was also an early promoter of cricket and a patron of the arts who commissioned numerous works from prominent artists, most notably Canaletto.

==Early life==

He was the fourth son of Wriothesley Russell, 2nd Duke of Bedford, by his wife, Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of John Howland of Streatham, Surrey. Known as Lord John Russell, he married in October 1731 Diana Spencer, daughter of Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland; became Duke of Bedford on his brother&#x27;s death a year later. 

Having lost his first wife in 1735, he married, secondly, in April 1737, to Lady Gertrude Leveson-Gower (died 1794), daughter of John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower. In 1749, John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, was made a Knight of the Order of the Garter.

==Early political career==
In the House of Lords he joined the Patriot Whig opposition hostile to the Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole, took a fairly prominent part in public business, and earned the dislike of George II. When Carteret, now Earl Granville, resigned office in November 1744, Bedford became First Lord of the Admiralty in the administration of Henry Pelham, and was made a privy councillor. He was very successful at the admiralty, but was not equally fortunate after he became Secretary of State for the Southern Department in February 1748. Pelham accused him of idleness and he was constantly at variance with his colleague The Duke of Newcastle.

Newcastle, who had previously admired The Earl of Sandwich, Bedford&#x27;s successor as First Lord of the Admiralty, for his forthright and hardline views, had increasingly begun to distrust him and his relationship with Bedford. Newcastle engineered the dismissal of both of them, by sacking Sandwich in June 1751. Bedford resigned in protest, as Newcastle had calculated, allowing him to replace them with men he considered more loyal personally to him. During his time in the post, he was accused of spending far too much time at his country estate playing cricket and shooting pheasants.

==Cricket==
Bedford was very keen on cricket. The earliest surviving record of his involvement in the sport comes from 1741 when he hosted Bedfordshire v Northamptonshire &amp; Huntingdonshire at Woburn Park. The combined Northamptonshire &amp; Huntingdonshire team won. Bedford arranged the match with his friends George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax (Northants) and John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich (Hunts). A few days later, there was a return match at Cow Meadow, Northampton, and the combined team won again.

By 1743, Bedford had developed Woburn Cricket Club into a leading team that was able to compete against London. The team was prominent in 1743 and 1744 but, after that, there is no further mention of it.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
===Lord Lieutenant of Ireland===
Instigated by his friends, he was active in opposition to the government, becoming the leader of a faction named after him, the Bedford Whigs. After Newcastle&#x27;s resignation in November 1756, Bedford became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the new government led by William Pitt and the Duke of Devonshire. He retained this office after Newcastle, in alliance with Pitt, returned to power in June 1757. 

In Ireland, he favoured a relaxation of the penal laws against Roman Catholics, but did not keep his promises to observe neutrality between the rival parties, and to abstain from securing pensions for his friends. His own courtly manners and generosity, and his wife&#x27;s good qualities, however, seem to have gained for him some popularity, although Horace Walpole says he disgusted everybody (but the word &quot;disgusting&quot; then had a much wider range of meanings than it has today, and at its mildest meant simply &quot;reserved&quot;).

He oversaw the Irish response to the threatened French invasion in 1759, and the landing of a small French force in northern Ireland. In March 1761, he resigned from this office.

===Peace negotiator===

Having allied himself with the Earl of Bute and the party anxious to bring the Seven Years&#x27; War to a close, Bedford was noticed as the strongest opponent of Pitt, and became Lord Privy Seal under Bute after Pitt resigned in October 1761. The cabinet of Bute was divided over the policy to be pursued with regard to the war, but the peace faction prevailed, and, in September 1762, Bedford went to France to open formal negotiations for peace.

He was considerably annoyed because some of the peace negotiations were conducted through other channels, but he signed the Peace of Paris in February 1763. Amongst other gains Britain received Canada from France and Florida from Spain. Resigning his office as Lord Privy Seal soon afterwards, various causes of estrangement arose between Bute and Bedford, and the subsequent relations between the two men were somewhat virulent.

==Grenville ministry==

The duke refused to take office under George Grenville on Bute&#x27;s resignation in April 1763, and sought to induce Pitt to return to power. A report, however, that Pitt would only take office on condition that Bedford was excluded, incensed him and, smarting under this rebuff, he joined the cabinet of Grenville as Lord President of the Council in September 1763. His haughty manner, his somewhat insulting language, and his attitude with regard to the regency bill in 1765 offended George III, who sought in vain to supplant him, and after this failure was obliged to make humiliating concessions to the ministry. In July 1765, however, he was able to dispense with the services of Bedford and his colleagues, and the duke became the leader of a political party, distinguished for rapacity, and known as the &quot;Bedford party&quot;, or the &quot;Bloomsbury gang&quot;.

During his term of office, he had opposed a bill to place high import duties on Italian silks. He was consequently assaulted and his London residence was attacked by a mob. He took some part in subsequent political intrigues, and although he did not return to office, his friends, with his consent, joined the ministry of the Duke of Grafton in December 1767. This proceeding led &quot;Junius&quot; to write his &quot;Letter to the Duke of Bedford,&quot; one of special violence. Bedford was hostile to John Wilkes, and narrowly escaped from a mob favourable to the agitator at Honiton in July 1769.

==Children==

Child of John Russell and his first wife Lady Diana Spencer:
*John Russell, Marquess of Tavistock (died at birth 6 November 1732)

Children of John Russell and his second wife Hon. Gertrude Leveson-Gower:
*Francis Russell, Marquess of Tavistock (27 September 1739 – 22 March 1767)
*Lady Caroline Russell (c. January 1743 – 26 November 1811), married George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough

==Death==
His health had been declining for some years, and in 1770 he became partially paralysed. He died at Woburn on 5 January 1771, and was buried in the Bedford Chapel at St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Chenies, Buckinghamshire. His sons all predeceased him, and he was succeeded in the title by his grandson, Francis. Francis suffered heavy financial losses, and began the development of Bloomsbury on the old Bedford Estate.

The duke held many public offices: lord-lieutenant of Bedfordshire and Devon, Colonel of the East Devon Militia, and chancellor of the University of Dublin among others, and was a Knight of the Garter. Bedford was a proud and conceited man, but possessed both ability and common sense. The important part which he took in public life, however, was due rather to his wealth and position than to his personal taste or ambition. He was neither above nor below the standard of political morality of the time, and was influenced by his duchess, who was very ambitious, and by followers who were singularly unscrupulous.

He served as the twelfth Chancellor of the University of Dublin from 1765 to 1770.

<text>Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford (23 July 1765 – 2 March 1802) was an English aristocrat and Whig politician, responsible for much of the development of central Bloomsbury.

==Life==
Francis Russell, eldest son of Francis Russell, Marquess of Tavistock (died 1767), by his wife, Elizabeth (died 1768), daughter of William Keppel, 2nd Earl of Albemarle, was born at Woburn Abbey and baptized on 20 August 1765 at St Giles in the Fields.

In January 1771 he succeeded his grandfather as Duke of Bedford, and was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge, afterwards spending nearly two years in foreign travel. Whilst abroad in 1784 he was involved in a menage a trois with Charles Maynard, second Viscount Maynard, and his wife Anne, Lady Maynard. This liaison was with Russell&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s approval and it continued until 1787.

Regarding Charles James Fox as his political leader, he joined the Whigs in the House of Lords, and became a member of the circle of the Prince of Wales, afterwards George IV.

Having overcome some nervousness and educational defects, he began to speak in the House, and soon became one of the leading debaters in that assembly. He opposed most of the measures brought forward by the ministry of William Pitt, and objected to the grant of a pension to Edmund Burke, an action which drew down upon him a scathing attack from Burke’s pen.

Bedford was greatly interested in agriculture. He established a model farm at Woburn, and made experiments with regard to the breeding of sheep. He was a member of the original Board of Agriculture, and was the first president of the Smithfield Club. He died at Woburn on 2 March 1802, and was buried in the &#x27;Bedford Chapel&#x27; at St. Michael’s Church, Chenies, Buckinghamshire, England. The duke never married, and was succeeded in the title by his brother, John.

==Trivia==
In 1795, when the government levied a tax on hair powder, as a form of protest Bedford abandoned the powdered and tied hairstyle commonly worn by men of that era in favour of a cropped, unpowdered style, making a bet with friends to do likewise. The new style became known as the &quot;Bedford Level&quot;, a pun on an area of The Fens reclaimed by the family and also known as the &quot;Bedford Level&quot;, as well as referring to Bedford&#x27;s radical (&quot;leveller&quot;) political views. It was also known as the &quot;Bedford Crop&quot;. Although natural, the Bedford crop was usually styled with wax.

== Influence on Bloomsbury ==
Francis Russell is responsible for much of the development of central Bloomsbury. Following the demolition of Bedford House on the north side of Bloomsbury Square, he commissioned James Burton to develop the land to the north into a residential area. Russell Square was designed as the focal point of the development. He commissioned Humphry Repton to landscape the square after the success of Repton&#x27;s work for the Duke at his Woburn Estate. A statue by Richard Westmacott, erected in 1809, has been conserved and stands on the south side of the square. It depicts Francis Russell as an agriculturalist with one hand on a plough, corn ears in the other and sheep at his feet. He looks out over the land he developed back towards Bloomsbury Square.

==Racing career==
Bedford established a stud at Woburn Abbey and had considerable success as a breeder and owner of racehorses. When he was only twenty-one his first notable horse, Skyscraper, was foaled, a colt which went on to win The Derby of 1789. Bedford bred two other Derby winners, Eager (1788), and the nameless Colt by Fidget (1794), as well as two Oaks winners, Portia (1788) and Caelia (1790).

<doc id="320996" wikidata="Q5725963" url="?curid=320996" title="Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester">
<text>Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester (7 November 1642) was an English judge, politician and peer. He is mainly remembered today as the judge who sentenced Sir Walter Raleigh to death.

==Life==
He was the 3rd son of Edward Montagu of Boughton and grandson of Sir Edward Montagu, Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench from 1539 to 1545, who was named by King Henry VIII one of the executors of his will, and governor to his son, Edward VI.

Henry was born at Boughton, Northamptonshire, about 1563.
He was educated at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, was admitted to Middle Temple on 6 November 1585 and was Called to the Bar on 9 June 1592. He was elected recorder of London in 1603, and in 1616 was made Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench, in which office it fell to him to pass sentence on Sir Walter Raleigh in October 1618.

In 1620, he was appointed Lord High Treasurer, being raised to the peerage as Viscount Mandeville and Baron Montagu of Kimbolton, Huntingdonshire. 
He became President of the Council in 1621, in which office he was continued by Charles I, who created him Earl of Manchester in 1626. 
In 1628, he became Lord Privy Seal, and in 1635 a commissioner of the treasury.

Although from the beginning of his public life in 1601, when he first entered Parliament, Manchester had inclined to the popular side in politics, he managed to retain to the end the favour of the King. He was a judge of the Star Chamber, and one of the most trusted councillors of Charles I. 
His loyalty, ability, and honesty were warmly praised by Clarendon. 
In conjunction with Coventry, the Lord Keeper, he pronounced an opinion in favour of the legality of ship money in 1634.

==Family==
Manchester was married three times: first, Catherine Spencer, daughter of Sir William Spencer of Yarnton, Oxfordshire; second, Anne Holliday (née Wincot), in 1613, daughter of William Wincot of Langham, Suffolk, and widow of Sir Leonard Holliday, third, Margaret Crouch, on 26 April 1620, daughter of John Crouch of Cornbury, Hertfordshire, who died in 1653.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward Montagu, Viscount Mandeville, from his first marriage. The second son of Henry and Catherine was Walter Montagu, the courtier and abbot. Another son he had with Catherine Spencer was James Montagu who served as MP for Huntingdon in the English House of Commons alongside Oliver Cromwell in 1628.

One of his sons by his third wife, Margaret Crouch, was George Montagu, father of Charles Montagu, created Earl of Halifax in 1699, and James Montagu, Attorney General from 1708 to 1710.

<doc id="320997" wikidata="Q556309" url="?curid=320997" title="Symmedian">
<text>In geometry, symmedians are three particular lines associated with every triangle. They are constructed by taking a median of the triangle (a line connecting a vertex with the midpoint of the opposite side), and reflecting the line over the corresponding angle bisector (the line through the same vertex that divides the angle there in half). The angle formed by the symmedian and the angle bisector has the same measure as the angle between the median and the angle bisector, but it is on the other side of the angle bisector.

The three symmedians meet at a triangle center called the Lemoine point. Ross Honsberger has called its existence &quot;one of the crown jewels of modern geometry&quot;.

==Isogonality==
Many times in geometry, if we take three special lines through the vertices of a triangle, or &quot;cevians&quot;, then their reflections about the corresponding angle bisectors, called &quot;isogonal lines&quot;, will also have interesting properties. For instance, if three cevians of a triangle intersect at a point , then their isogonal lines also intersect at a point, called the isogonal conjugate of .

The symmedians illustrate this fact. 
* In the diagram, the medians (in black) intersect at the centroid .
* Because the symmedians (in red) are isogonal to the medians, the symmedians also intersect at a single point, . 
This point is called the triangle&#x27;s symmedian point, or alternatively the Lemoine point or Grebe point.

The dotted lines are the angle bisectors; the symmedians and medians are symmetric about the angle bisectors (hence the name &quot;symmedian.&quot;)

== Construction of the symmedian ==

Let be a triangle. Construct a point by intersecting the tangents from and to the circumcircle. Then is the symmedian of .

&quot;first proof.&quot; Let the reflection of across the angle bisector of meet at . Then:

formula_1

&quot;second proof.&quot; Define as the isogonal conjugate of . It is easy to see that the reflection of about the bisector is the line through parallel to . The same is true for , and so, is a parallelogram. is clearly the median, because a parallelogram&#x27;s diagonals bisect each other, and is its reflection about the bisector.

&quot;third proof.&quot; Let be the circle with center passing through and , and let be the circumcenter of . Say lines intersect at , respectively. Since , triangles and are similar. Since 
:formula_2 
we see that is a diameter of and hence passes through . Let be the midpoint of . Since is the midpoint of , the similarity implies that , from which the result follows.

&quot;fourth proof.&quot; Let be the midpoint of the arc . , so is the angle bisector of . Let be the midpoint of , and It follows that is the Inverse of with respect to the circumcircle. From that, we know that the circumcircle is an Apollonian circle with foci . So is the bisector of angle , and we have achieved our wanted result.

==Tetrahedra==
The concept of a symmedian point extends to (irregular) tetrahedra. Given a tetrahedron two planes through are isogonal conjugates if they form equal angles with the planes and . Let be the midpoint of the side . The plane containing the side that is isogonal to the plane is called a symmedian plane of the tetrahedron. The symmedian planes can be shown to intersect at a point, the symmedian point. This is also the point that minimizes the squared distance from the faces of the tetrahedron.

In the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers the symmedian point appears as the sixth point, X(6). For a non-equilateral triangle, it lies in the open orthocentroidal disk punctured at its own center, and could be any point therein.

The symmedian point of a triangle with side lengths , and has homogeneous trilinear coordinates .

An algebraic way to find the symmedian point is to express the triangle by three linear equations in two unknowns given by the hesse normal forms of the corresponding lines. The solution of this overdetermined system found by the least squares method gives the coordinates of the point. It also solves the optimization problem to find the point with a minimal sum of squared distances from the sides.
The Gergonne point of a triangle is the same as the symmedian point of the triangle&#x27;s contact triangle.

The symmedian point of a triangle can be constructed in the following way: let the tangent lines of the circumcircle of through and meet at , and analogously define and ; then is the tangential triangle of , and the lines , and intersect at the symmedian point of . It can be shown that these three lines meet at a point using Brianchon&#x27;s theorem. Line is a symmedian, as can be seen by drawing the circle with center through and .

The French mathematician Émile Lemoine proved the existence of the symmedian point in 1873, and Ernst Wilhelm Grebe published a paper on it in 1847. Simon Antoine Jean L&#x27;Huilier had also noted the point in 1809.

For the extension to an irregular tetrahedron see symmedian.

<text>Bozhou () is a prefecture-level city in northwestern Anhui province, China. It borders Huaibei to the northeast, Bengbu to the southeast, Huainan to the south, Fuyang to the southwest, and Henan to the north. Its population was 4,996,844 at the 2020 census, of whom 1,537,231 lived in the built-up area made of Qiaocheng urban district, even though the county remains largely rural.

==Administration==

The prefecture-level city of Bozhou currently administers 4 county-level divisions, including 1 district and 3 counties.
*Qiaocheng District ()
*Guoyang County ()
*Lixin County ()
*Mengcheng County ()

==Geography and climate==
Bozhou features a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;) with four distinct seasons. With an annual mean temperature of , the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in August. Winters are damp and cold (yet the precipitation is low) while summers are hot and humid. Rainfall is heavily concentrated in the warmer months, as more than half of the annual total occurs from June to August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 46% in January and March to 54% in May, the city receives 2,242 hours of bright sunshine annually.

==History==
Bozhou was, in addition to being a prefecture during the Tang dynasty, once the Qiao Commandery () at the time of the Sui dynasty.

In 1355, during the Yuan dynasty, Han Lin&#x27;er () was proclaimed by Liu Futong () to be the Emperor of Great Song (, a reference to the extinct Song dynasty) with the regnal year Longfeng (). Chao was nicknamed &quot;The Little Ming King&quot; ().

In 1368, Bo Prefecture was downgraded in status and became a county. In 1496, it was again upgraded to a prefecture/Fu then later lowered to a county in 1912 (after 1911 Revolution) when it became Bo County. In May 1986, it was upgraded to a county-level city administered by Fuyang Prefecture (). In 1996, Bozhou was upgraded to a provincially directly administered city (), under the control of Fuyang City on behalf of the province. The province has directly administered Bozhou since February 1998. In June 2000, Bozhou was made a prefecture-level city.

The city is located on two main Chinese train routes running from capital Beijing to the south and from the east to Shanghai which facilitate the easy transportation of goods and people.

Bozhou&#x27;s population currently stands at around the three million mark which makes it small by Chinese standards. Whilst Bozhou is currently developing and expanding, it still has few internationally recognized brands based in the city.

==Traditional Chinese medicine market==
Bozhou is currently the capital of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in mainland China, with one of the largest TCM industries and production area in the country. In 2008, companies based in Bozhou exported over 160,000 tons of products (out of total Chinese exports of 240,000 tons). Whilst relatively underdeveloped compared to coastal regions of China, Bozhou continues to be the primary location and trading hub for TCM within China. The international TCM Expo is held in Bozhou in September each year which sees delegates from around the world coming to discuss TCM.

==Notable people==
*Cao Song, father of Cao Cao
**Cao Cao (155 - 220), last chancellor and &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the Eastern Han dynasty
*Hua Tuo (110 - 208 (estimated)), renowned Eastern Han dynasty physician, first inventor of general anaesthesia
*Hua Mulan, legendary heroine who disguised herself as a man in order to replace her father in the army draft
*Zhang Jun, (b. 1963), economist and professor at Fudan University

<doc id="321005" wikidata="Q332639" url="?curid=321005" title="Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne">
<text>Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne (2 July 178031 January 1863), known as Lord Henry Petty from 1784 to 1809, was a British statesman. In a ministerial career spanning nearly half a century, he notably served as Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer and was three times Lord President of the Council.

==Background and education==
Lansdowne was the son of Prime Minister William Petty, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne (better known as the Earl of Shelburne), by his second marriage to Lady Louisa, daughter of John FitzPatrick, 1st Earl of Upper Ossory. He was educated at Westminster School, the University of Edinburgh, and Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Political career==
He entered the House of Commons in 1802 as member for the family borough of Calne and quickly showed his mettle as a politician. In February 1806 he became Chancellor of the Exchequer in Lord Grenville&#x27;s Ministry of All the Talents, being at this time member for the University of Cambridge, but he lost both his seat and his office in 1807. In 1809 he became Marquess of Lansdowne, and in the House of Lords and in society he continued to play an active part as one of the Whig leaders. His chief interest was perhaps in the question of Roman Catholic emancipation, a cause which he consistently championed, but he sympathised also with the advocates of the abolition of the slave trade and with the cause of popular education. Lansdowne, who had succeeded his cousin, Francis Thomas Fitzmaurice, as 4th Earl of Kerry in 1818, took office with George Canning in May 1827 and was Secretary of State for the Home Department from July of that year until January 1828.

He was Lord President of the Council under Earl Grey and then under Lord Melbourne from November 1830 to August 1841, with the exception of the few months in 1835 when Sir Robert Peel was prime minister. He held the same office during the whole of Lord John Russell&#x27;s ministry (1846–1852), and, having declined to become prime minister, sat in the cabinets of Lord Aberdeen and of Lord Palmerston, but without office. In 1857 he refused the offer of a dukedom, and he died on 31 January 1863. Lansdowne&#x27;s social influence and political moderation made him one of the most powerful Whig statesmen of the time; he was frequently consulted by Queen Victoria on matters of moment, and his long official experience made his counsel invaluable to his party. In Kenmare, he donated the site of the Holy Cross Church to the town. In 1864, Father John O&#x27;Sullivan (1806–1874) built the church on that site.

==Other public appointments==
Lansdowne chaired the inaugural meeting of the London Statistical Society, and was its first president (1834–1836). He later served a second term (1842–1844). (See &quot;The Times&quot; 15 and 17 March 1834, and John Bibby (1987) &quot;HOTS: History of Teaching Statistics&quot;.)

==Family==

Lord Lansdowne married Lady Louisa Fox-Strangways, daughter of the 2nd Earl of Ilchester, in 1808. They had two sons and one daughter:

*William Thomas Petty-FitzMaurice, Earl of Kerry (30 March 1811 – 21 August 1836)
*Lady Louisa (1813 – 12 June 1906) married Hon. James Kenneth Howard, son of Thomas Howard, 16th Earl of Suffolk. They had a son Kenneth (married Lady Emily Bury, daughter of the Earl of Charleville) and daughter Winifrede.
*Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, 4th Marquess of Lansdowne (7 January 1816 – 5 July 1866).

Louisa died in April 1851, aged 65, and Lord Lansdowne in January 1863, aged 82. His eldest son, the Earl of Kerry, had predeceased him and he was succeeded in the marquessate by his only surviving son, Henry. The latter was the father of Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne, who also became a distinguished statesman.

<text>The Allen Mouse and Human Brain Atlases are projects within the Allen Institute for Brain Science which seek to combine genomics with neuroanatomy by creating gene expression maps for the mouse and human brain. They were initiated in September 2003 with a $100 million donation from Paul G. Allen and the first atlas went public in September 2006. 
, seven brain atlases have been published: Mouse Brain Atlas, Human Brain Atlas, Developing Mouse Brain Atlas, Developing Human Brain Atlas, Mouse Connectivity Atlas, Non-Human Primate Atlas, and Mouse Spinal Cord Atlas. There are also three related projects with data banks: Glioblastoma, Mouse Diversity, and Sleep. It is the hope of the Allen Institute that their findings will help advance various fields of science, especially those surrounding the understanding of neurobiological diseases. The atlases are free and available for public use online.

==History==
In 2001, Paul Allen gathered a group of scientists, including James Watson and Steven Pinker, to discuss the future of neuroscience and what could be done to enhance neuroscience research (Jones 2009). During these meetings David Anderson from the California Institute of Technology proposed the idea that a three-dimensional atlas of gene expression in the mouse brain would be of great use to the neuroscience community. The project was set in motion in 2003 with a 100 million dollar donation by Allen through the Allen Institute for Brain Science. 
The project used a technique for mapping gene expression developed by Gregor Eichele and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Goettingen, Germany. The technique uses colorimetric in situ hybridization to map gene expression. The project set a 3-year goal of finishing the project and making it available to the public.

An initial release of the first atlas, the mouse brain atlas, occurred in December 2004. Subsequently, more data for this atlas was released in stages. The final genome-wide data set was released in September 2006. However, the final release of the atlas was not the end of the project; the Atlas is still being improved upon. Also, other projects including the human brain atlas, developing mouse brain, developing human brain, mouse connectivity, non-human primate atlas, and the mouse spinal cord atlas are being developed through the Allen Institute for Brain Science in conjunction with the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas.

==Goals for the project==

The overarching goal and motto for all Allen Institute projects is &quot;fueling discovery&quot;. The project strives to fulfill this goal and advance science in a few ways. First, they create brain atlases to better understand the connections between genes and brain functioning. They aim to advance the research and knowledge about neurobiological conditions such as Parkinson&#x27;s, Alzheimer&#x27;s, and Autism with their mapping of gene expression throughout the brain. 
The Brain Atlas projects also follow the &quot;Allen Institute&quot; motto with their open release of data and findings. This policy is also related to another goal of the Institute: collaborative and multidisciplinary research. Thus, any scientist from any discipline is able to look at the findings and take them into account while designing their own experiments. Also available to the public is the Brain Explorer application.

==Research techniques==
The Allen Institute for Brain Science uses a project-based philosophy for their research. Each brain atlas focuses on its own project, made up of its own team of researchers. To complete an atlas, each research team collects and synthesizes brain scans, medical data, genetic information and psychological data. With this information, they are able to construct the 3-D biochemical architecture of the brain and figure out which proteins are expressed in certain parts of the brain. To gather the needed data, scientists at the Allen Institute use various techniques. One technique involves the use of postmortem brains and brain scanning technology to discover where in the brain genes are turned on and off. Another technique, called in situ hybridization, or ISH, is used to view gene expression patterns as in situ hybridization images.

Within the Brain Atlases, these 3-D ISH digital images and graphs reveal, in color, the regions where a given gene is expressed. In the Brain Explorer, any gene can be searched for and selected resulting in the in situ image appearing as an easily manipulated and explored fashion. Part of the creation of this anatomy-centred database of gene expression, includes aligning ISH data for each gene with a three-dimensional coordinate space through registration with a reference atlas created for the project.

==Contributions to neuroscience==
The different types of cells in the central nervous system originate from varying gene expression. A map of gene expression in the brain allows researchers to correlate forms and functions. The Allen Brain Atlas lets researchers view the areas of differing expression in the brain which enables the viewing of neural connections throughout the brain. Viewing these pathways through differing gene expression as well as functional imaging techniques permits researchers to correlate between gene expression, cell types, and pathway function in relation to behaviors or phenotypes.

Even though the majority of research has been done in mice, 90% of genes in mice have a counterpart in humans. This makes the Atlas particularly useful for modeling neurological diseases. The gene expression patterns in normal individuals provide a standard for comparing and understanding altered phenotypes. Extending information learned from mouse diseases will help better the understanding of human neurological disorders. The atlas can show which genes and particular areas are effected in neurological disorders; the action of a gene in a disease can be evaluated in conjunction with general expression patterns and this data could shed light on the role of the particular gene in the disorder.

==Brain explorer==
The Allen Brain Atlas website contains a downloadable 3-D interactive Brain explorer. The explorer is essentially a search engine for locations of gene expression; this is particularly useful in finding regions that express similar genes. Users can delineate networks and pathways using this application by connecting regions that co-express a certain gene. The explorer uses a multicolor scale and contains multiple planes of the brain that let viewers see differences in density and expression level. The images are a composite of many averaged samples so it is useful when comparing to individuals with abnormally low gene expression.

==Atlases==

===Mouse Brain===
The Allen Mouse Brain Atlas is a comprehensive genome-wide map of the adult mouse brain that reveals where each gene is expressed. The mouse brain atlas was the original project of the Allen Brain Atlas and was finished in 2006. The purpose of the atlas is to aid in the development of neuroscience research. The hope of the project is that it will allow scientists to gain a better understanding of brain diseases and disorders such as autism and depression.

===Human Brain===
The Allen Human Brain Atlas was made public in May 2010. It was the first anatomically and genomically comprehensive three-dimensional human brain map. The atlas was created to enhance research in many neuroscience research fields including neuropharmacology, human brain imaging, human genetics, neuroanatomy, genomics and more. The atlas is also geared toward furthering research into mental health disorders and brain injuries such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, autism, schizophrenia and drug addiction.

===Developing Mouse Brain===
The Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas is an atlas which tracks gene expression throughout the development of a C57BL/6 mouse brain. The project began in 2008 and is currently ongoing. The atlas is based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It traces the growth, white matter, connectivity, and development of the C57BL/6 mouse brain from embryonic day 12 to postnatal day 80.
This atlas enhances the ability of neuroscientists to study how pollutants and genetic mutations effect the development of the brain. Thus, the atlas may be used to determine what toxins pose special threats to children and pregnant mothers.

===Mouse Brain Connectivity===
The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas was launched in November 2011. Unlike other atlases from the Allen Institute, this atlas focuses on the identification of neural circuitry that govern behavior and brain function. This neural circuitry is responsible for functions like behavior and perception. This map will allow scientists to further understand how the brain works and what causes brain diseases and disorders, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease and depression.

===Mouse Spinal Cord===
Unveiled in July 2008, the Allen Mouse Spinal Cord Atlas was the first genome-wide map of the mouse spinal cord ever constructed. The spinal cord atlas is a map of genome wide gene expression in the spinal cord of adult and juvenile C57 black mice. The initial unveiling included data for 2,000 genes and an anatomical reference section. A plan for the future includes expanding the amount of data to about 20,000 genes spanning the full length of the spinal cord.

The aim of the spinal cord atlas is to enhance research in the treatment of spinal cord injury, diseases, and disorders such as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s diseases and spinal muscular atrophy. The project was funded by an array of donors including the Allen Research Institute, Paralyzed Veterans of America Research Foundation, the ALS Association, Wyeth Research, PEMCO Insurance, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, International Spinal Research Trust, and many other organizations, foundations, corporate and private donors.

<doc id="321019" wikidata="Q207634" url="?curid=321019" title="Cleisthenes">
<text>Cleisthenes ( ; ), or Clisthenes (), was an ancient Athenian lawgiver credited with reforming the constitution of ancient Athens and setting it on a democratic footing in 508 BC. For these accomplishments, historians refer to him as &quot;the father of Athenian democracy&quot;. He was a member of the aristocratic Alcmaeonid clan. He was the younger son of Megacles and Agariste making him the maternal grandson of the tyrant Cleisthenes of Sicyon. He was also credited with increasing the power of the Athenian citizens&#x27; assembly and for reducing the power of the nobility over Athenian politics.

In 510 BC, Spartan troops helped the Athenians overthrow the tyrant Hippias, son of Peisistratus. Cleomenes I, king of Sparta, put in place a pro-Spartan oligarchy headed by Isagoras. However, Cleisthenes, with the support of the middle class and aided by democrats, took over. Cleomenes intervened in 508 and 506 BC, but could not stop Cleisthenes and his Athenian supporters. Through Cleisthenes&#x27; reforms, the people of Athens endowed their city with isonomic institutions—equal rights for all citizens (though only free men and women were citizens)—and established ostracism as a punishment.

==Biography==
Historians estimate that Cleisthenes was born around 570 BC. Cleisthenes was the uncle of Pericles&#x27; mother, Agariste, and of Alcibiades&#x27; maternal grandfather, Megacles. Cleisthenes came from the family of the Alcmaeonidae. He was the son of Agariste and grandson of Cleisthenes of Sicyon. Unlike his grandfather who was a tyrant, he adopted politically democratic concepts. When Pisistratus took power in Athens as a tyrant, he exiled his political opponents and the Alcmaeonidae. After Pisistratus&#x27; death in 527 BC, Cleisthenes returned to Athens and became the eponymous archon. A few years later, Pisistratus&#x27; successors, Hipparchus and Hippias, again exiled Cleisthenes. In 514 BC, Harmodius and Aristogeiton assassinated Hipparchus, causing Hippias to further harden his attitude towards the people of Athens. This led Cleisthenes to ask the Oracle of Delphi to persuade the Spartans to help him free Athens from tyranny. Cleisthenes&#x27; plea for assistance was accepted by the Oracle as his family had previously helped rebuild the sanctuary when it was destroyed by fire.

=== Rise to power ===
With help from the Spartans and the Alcmaeonidae (Cleisthenes&#x27; &quot;genos&quot;, &quot;clan&quot;), he was responsible for overthrowing Hippias, the tyrant son of Pisistratus. After the collapse of Hippias&#x27; tyranny, Isagoras and Cleisthenes were rivals for power, but Isagoras won the upper hand by appealing to the Spartan king Cleomenes I to help him expel Cleisthenes. He did so on the pretext of the Alcmaeonid curse. Consequently, Cleisthenes left Athens as an exile, and Isagoras was unrivalled in power within the city. Isagoras set about dispossessing hundreds of Athenians of their homes and exiling them on the pretext that they too were cursed. He also attempted to dissolve the Boule (βουλή), a council of Athenian citizens appointed to run the daily affairs of the city. However, the council resisted, and the Athenian people declared their support of the council. Isagoras and his partisans were forced to flee to the Acropolis, remaining besieged there for two days. On the third day they fled the city and were banished. Cleisthenes was subsequently recalled, along with hundreds of exiles, and he assumed leadership of Athens. Promptly after his instatement as leader, he commissioned a bronze memorial from the sculptor Antenor in honour of the lovers and tyrannicides Harmodius and Aristogeiton, whom Hippias had executed.
=== Reformations and governance of Athens ===
==== Political reorganization ====

After this victory, Cleisthenes began to reform the government of Athens. In order to forestall strife between the traditional clans, which had led to the tyranny in the first place, he changed the political organization from the four traditional tribes, which were based on family relations, and which formed the basis of the upper-class Athenian political power network, into ten tribes according to their area of residence (their &quot;deme&quot;), which would form the basis of a new democratic power structure. It is thought that there may have been 139 demes (though this is still a matter of debate), each organized into three groups called &quot;trittyes&quot; (&quot;thirds&quot;), with ten &quot;demes&quot; divided among three regions in each trittyes (a city region, &quot;asty&quot;; a coastal region, &quot;paralia&quot;; and an inland region, &quot;mesogeia&quot;). D.M Lewis argues that Cleisthenes established the &quot;deme&quot; system in order to balance the central unifying force that a tyranny has with the democratic concept of having the people (instead of a single person) at the peak of political power. Another by-product of the &quot;deme&quot; system was that it split up and weakened his political adversaries. Cleisthenes also abolished patronymics in favour of &quot;demonymics&quot; (a name given according to the &quot;deme&quot; to which one belongs), thus increasing Athenians&#x27; sense of belonging to a &quot;deme&quot;. This and the other aforementioned reforms had an additional effect in that they worked to include (wealthy, male) foreign citizens in Athenian society.

He also established sortition – the random selection of citizens to fill government positions rather than kinship or heredity. It is also speculated that, in another move to lower the barriers of kinship and heredity when it comes to participation in Athenian society, Cleisthenes made it so foreign residents of Athens were eligible to become legally privileged. In addition, he reorganized the Boule, created with 400 members under Solon, so that it had 500 members, 50 from each tribe. He also introduced the bouleutic oath, &quot;To advise according to the laws what was best for the people&quot;. The court system (Dikasteria – law courts) was reorganized and had from 201–5001 jurors selected each day, up to 500 from each tribe. It was the role of the Boule to propose laws to the assembly of voters, who convened in Athens around forty times a year for this purpose. The bills proposed could be rejected, passed, or returned for amendments by the assembly.

==== Introduction of ostracism ====

Cleisthenes also may have introduced ostracism (first used in 487 BC), whereby a vote by at least 6,000 citizens would exile a citizen for ten years. The initial and intended purpose was to vote for a citizen deemed to be a threat to the democracy, most likely anyone who seemed to have ambitions to set himself up as tyrant. However, soon after, any citizen judged to have too much power in the city tended to be targeted for exile (e.g., Xanthippus in 485–84 BC). Under this system, the exiled man&#x27;s property was maintained, but he was not physically in the city where he could possibly create a new tyranny. One later ancient author records that Cleisthenes himself was the first person to be ostracized.

Cleisthenes called these reforms &quot;isonomia&quot; (&quot;equality vis à vis law&quot;, &quot;iso-&quot; meaning equality; &quot;nomos&quot; meaning law), instead of &quot;demokratia&quot;. Cleisthenes&#x27; life after his reforms is unknown as no ancient texts mention him thereafter.

==Attempt to obtain Persian support==

In 507 BC, during the time Cleisthenes was leading Athenian politics, and probably at his instigation, democratic Athens sent an embassy to Artaphernes, brother of Darius I, and Achaemenid Satrap, of Asia Minor in the capital of Sardis, looking for Persian assistance in order to resist the threats from Sparta. Herodotus reports that Artaphernes had no previous knowledge of the Athenians, and his initial reaction was &quot;Who are these people?&quot; Artaphernes asked the Athenians for &quot;Water and Earth&quot;, a symbol of submission, if they wanted help from the Achaemenid king. The Athenian ambassadors apparently accepted to comply, and to give &quot;Earth and Water&quot;. Artaphernes also advised the Athenians that they should receive back the Athenian tyrant Hippias. The Persians threatened to attack Athens if they did not accept Hippias. Nevertheless, the Athenians preferred to remain democratic despite the danger from the Achaemenid Empire, and the ambassadors were disavowed and censured upon their return to Athens.

There is a possibility that the Achaemenid ruler now saw the Athenians as subjects who had solemnly promised submission through the gift of &quot;Earth and Water&quot;, and that subsequent actions by the Athenians, such as their intervention in the Ionian revolt, were perceived as a breach of oath and a rebellion against the central authority of the Achaemenid ruler.

<text>The French civil service () is the set of civil servants (&quot;fonctionnaires&quot;) working for the Government of France.

Not all employees of the state and public institutions or corporations are civil servants; however, the media often incorrectly equate &quot;government employee&quot; or &quot;employee of a public corporation&quot; with &quot;fonctionnaire&quot;. For instance, most employees of the RATP and SNCF (metropolitan and national rail transport authorities) are not civil servants. The Civil Service is also sometimes incorrectly referred to as the &quot;administration&quot;, but, properly speaking, the &quot;administration&quot; is the compound of public administrations and public administrative establishments, not their employees.

Most employment positions in the French civil service are open to citizens of the European Union. Others, especially in police and justice, are specifically reserved for nationals, while a minority are open regardless of citizenship. About half of the civil servants are employed in the French public education system.

==Divisions==
The Civil Service is divided into:
* the civil service of the State (&quot;fonction publique de l&#x27;État&quot;);
* the judiciary (&quot;magistrature&quot;);
* the civil service of public hospitals (&quot;fonction publique hospitalière&quot;);
* the civil service of local governments (&quot;fonction publique territoriale&quot;).

Technically, &quot;fonction publique&quot; may also refer to &quot;fonction publique militaire&quot;, the personnel of military status. They are generally counted apart. There also exist &quot;ouvriers d&#x27;État&quot; - that is, State Workers - for industrial functions.

===Corps and ranks===
Civil servants of the State are divided into &quot;corps&quot; (&quot;professions&quot;). Corps are grouped in 3 categories (formerly 4): category A for management, design, and general studies professions (e.g. judges, engineers, professors...); category B for applications-related professions (e.g. librarians, superior technicians...); and category C for executions-related professions (e.g. technicians, administrative assistants...). Each corps has a set of possible job or task descriptions and may have its own particular statutes.

These corps may themselves be divided into ranks (&quot;grades&quot;, called &quot;classes&quot; in certain corps). For instance, the corps of university professors is a category A corps divided into 3 classes: second class (equivalent to an American associate professor), first class (full professor), exceptional class (leading full professor in their area). Generally, to avoid rank inflation, the number of civil servants in the higher ranks (especially &quot;exceptional class&quot;) is constrained by a maximal percentage of the total number of civil servants of the corps.

Other French Civil Services have different organisations; for instance the Fonction Publique Territoriale is not divided between rigid &quot;corps&quot; but between &quot;cadres d&#x27;emploi&quot; (type of job).

==== Grands corps de l&#x27;État ====

Certain corps enjoying particular prestige are called the &quot;grands corps de l&#x27;État&quot;:

* Grand Technical Corps of the State, consisting of engineers, generally recruited at École polytechnique (also at the écoles normales supérieures). In practice, they are more likely to be employed in executive positions than in purely technical positions.
** Corps des mines, merged with the Corps of Telecommunications in 2009
** Corps des ponts, des eaux et des forêts (IPEF)
** Corps des télécommunications, merged into the Corps des mines in 2009
** Corps de l&#x27;armement
** Corps de l&#x27;INSEE
** Administrateurs des assemblées parlementaires : administrateur de l&#x27;Assemblée nationale, administrateur du Sénat
* Grand Administrative Corps of the State, generally recruited through the Institut national du service public (INSP).
** Conseil d&#x27;État
** Inspection générale des finances.
** Cour des comptes

High-level administrative positions are typically paid much less than the equivalent positions in private industries. However, members of grand Corps often practice &quot;pantouflage&quot; — that is, they take temporarily (and sometimes permanent) leave from government work and go work in industry. Occasionally, people from a ministry supervising some industry would later go to work in that same industry; this practice was later prohibited. &quot;Pantouflage&quot; however still exists, and the coziness between some industrial, political and administrative circles is regularly denounced.

Members of the great administrative corps are well represented in politics. This is facilitated by civil servants (of any level) being able to exercise elected office on a temporary leave (&quot;détachement&quot;) from government.

==Duties==

Civil servants have duties; failure to carry them out may result in disciplinary action, up to discharge. The main duties are:

===Full commitment to professional activity===
A civil servant should devote their full professional activity to their appointed task. By exception, a civil servant may in addition to their regular activities write books; they may also accomplish certain tasks (teaching...) with the permission of their hierarchical supervisor.

===Morality===
One cannot be a civil servant if one has been convicted of a crime incompatible with one&#x27;s functions.

In certain exceptional cases, certain aspects of the private life of a civil servant may be termed incompatible with their functions. For instance, it is inappropriate for a member of the police or the judiciary to live with a partner or a prostitute. Appreciation of what is appropriate or not is largely a matter of case law.

===Reserve===
A civil servant should not, by their actions and especially by their declarations, cause harm to institutions.

Generally speaking, a civil servant should always refrain from enunciating personal opinions in a manner that can be construed as expressing the official opinion of the French government or a public institution. Obviously, this is more of a matter for the higher managerial positions. Agents operating abroad should be especially prudent. For instance, an ambassador should refrain from making any private comment on international issues.

The academic freedom of university professors is a principle recognized (in theory) by the laws of the Republic, as defined by the Constitutional Council; furthermore, statute law declares about higher education that &quot;&quot;teachers-researchers [university professors and lecturers], researchers and teachers are fully independent and enjoy full freedom of speech in the course of their research and teaching activities, provided they respect, following university traditions and the dispositions of this code, principles of tolerance and objectivity&quot;.

===Hierarchical obedience===
A civil servant must accomplish the orders given by their hierarchical supervisor, unless those orders are evidently illegal and contrary to public interest.

While the hierarchical authority is normally responsible for assigning civil servants to positions and evaluating their work, certain corps of civil servants follow specific rules regarding the management, evaluation and discipline of their members. For instance, professors and researchers are evaluated by elected committees of their peers. Furthermore, judges of the judiciary (&quot;magistrats du siège&quot;) as well as administrative magistrates cannot be removed from their position, even for a promotion, without their agreement.

===Professional discretion===
Civil servants must not reveal private or secret information that they have gained in the course of their duties. Depending on a civil servant&#x27;s corps, this obligation may be of varying intensity : while administrative magistrates are formally discouraged from making their profession in non-professional works and opinions, members of the military are expected to maintain a very high standard of discretion. This restraint on the side of the military has even led it to being nicknamed &quot;the great mute&quot; (&quot;la grande muette&quot;&quot;).

===Honesty===
Civil servants must not use the means at their professional disposal for private gain.

===Neutrality===
Civil servant must be neutral with respect to the religious or political opinions, origin, or sex, and should refrain from expressing their own opinions.

==Recruitment and career==
Most positions are open to citizens of the European Union. Certain positions involving the main powers of the state (e.g. Police) are open only to French nationals. Some rare positions, e.g. university professors and researchers, are open regardless of citizenship.

As an exception to the general rules concerning workers, civil servants do not sign contracts; their situation is defined by statutory and regulatory dispositions, most notably the General Statute of the Civil Servants (&quot;Statut Général des Fonctionnaires&quot;).

The general rule is that civil servants are recruited through competitive exams, either:
* external, reserved to competitors fulfilling certain conditions of diplomas and age;
* internal, reserved to civil servants in certain positions;
* external, reserved to competitors having certain professional experience and age.

The most common method is to organize written and/or oral exams in subjects pertaining to the tasks to be accomplished. For certain positions, such as professorships in universities, the exam, organized locally for each position or each set of similar positions, consists in the submission of a file listing the professional qualifications and experience of the candidate, followed by an interview.
In all cases, a committee ranks candidates by order of preference; the positions are filled by the candidates accepting them called in that order of preference.
For some top managerial positions, nominations are at the discretion of the executive.

High level nominations are made by the President of the Republic in the council of ministers. The rest are by the head of the agency they belong to, or by a minister; in fact, they are in general appointed by some person who has received from the head of agency or minister the authority to do so.

==Pay==
The pay of a civil servant is composed of:
* a base pay known as &quot;traitement&quot;
* possible overtime pay
* possible bonuses, which depend on the particular job assignment and possibly of the individual worker.

The &quot;traitement&quot; is for most civil servants fixed by multiplying an index by the value of the index point in Euros. The value of the index point is set by the executive and is raised regularly to compensate for inflation. The index depends on the corps, rank and seniority in rank (&quot;échelon&quot;).

In the case of high-level civil servants known as &quot;hors échelle&quot;, the corps, rank and seniority correspond to a letter code (e.g. A1, E2, G); the corresponding yearly pay can then be looked up in tables set by the executive. For instance, the topmost &quot;traitement&quot;, corresponding to pay grade G, is €82737.67 per year, starting 1 July 2009.

There are special rules for the pays of elected officials and government ministers.

==Statistics==
On 31 December 1999, official statistics give for the state civil service:
(1) Including 12,000 young employees on limited time contracts.

<doc id="321026" wikidata="Q1274227" url="?curid=321026" title="Street prostitution">
<text>Street prostitution is a form of prostitution in which a prostitute solicits customers from a public place, most commonly a street, while waiting at street corners or walking alongside a street, but also other public places such as parks, benches, etc. The street prostitute is often dressed in a provocative manner. The sex act may be performed in the customer&#x27;s car, in a nearby secluded street location, or at the prostitute&#x27;s residence or in a rented motel room.

==Legality==

Street prostitution is often illegal, even in jurisdictions that allow other forms of prostitution.

It is estimated that only 10-20 percent of sex workers are working on the streets; however, it is also estimated that 90 percent of the arrests of prostitutes are of street workers.

In some jurisdictions where prostitution itself is legal, such as in the United Kingdom, street prostitution has been made illegal.

Some jurisdictions also outlaw kerb crawling, slowly driving around with the intent to procure the services of a prostitute.

In Australia, in New South Wales it is legal to solicit on the streets, except in some areas (such as near schools). The other Australian states and territories prohibit street solicitation, although some of these jurisdictions allow licensed brothels.

Street prostitution is legal in New Zealand. In Germany it is allowed too, but cities can restrict it to certain areas or hours (regulations vary widely from place to place).

In the United States, street prostitution is illegal in all 50 states; 49 of the states outlaw all forms of prostitution. Nevada allows licensed brothels, but only in some rural areas, not in the major metropolitan areas (only eight counties have active brothels and prostitution outside these brothels is illegal throughout the state).

In four towns in the Netherlands, a special zone (&quot;tippelzone&quot;) is designated for legal street prostitution. The zone is often in a business park to avoid inconvenience for residents and can include a sex drive-in (afwerkplek). In most of the zones, the prostitutes need a licence.

==Risks and research==
Street prostitutes are extremely vulnerable to physical and sexual assaults, as well as to muggings by clients and pimps.

The World Health Organization reported that a study in Bangladesh found that between 50% and 60% of street-based prostitutes had been raped by men in uniform, and between 40% and 50% had been raped by local clients.

Melissa Farley&#x27;s study of 854 prostitutes in nine countries—Canada, Colombia, Germany, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, the United States, and Zambia—found that 95% of prostitutes had been physically assaulted, and 75% had been raped. 89% of the women interviewed stated that they wanted to leave prostitution. However, the methodology and neutrality of Farley&#x27;s studies has been criticised by other academics such as Ronald Weitzer. Weitzer has also said that Farley&#x27;s findings are heavily influenced by radical feminist ideology.

In a 2008 study of Chicago, USA street prostitutes, economists Steven D. Levitt and Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh found that women working without pimps work for an average hourly rate of about $25, and those working with pimps make 50% more. This is roughly four times the wage of other jobs available to them. Prostitutes are arrested once for every 450 encounters and every 10th arrest results in jail time.

In 2004, a study in the UK showed that up to 95% of women in street prostitution were problematic drug users, including around 78% heroin users and rising numbers of crack cocaine addicts.

==Impact of COVID-19==
During the COVID-19 pandemic, contact professions (which includes prostitution, amongst others) had been banned (temporarily) in some countries. This has resulted in a local reduction of prostitution.

== Modern terminology ==
In recent years there has been a movement to redefine the way that prostitution is talked about. Instead of &quot;prostitution&quot;, &quot;sex work&quot;, and &quot;sex workers&quot;, are the more preferred terminology. This movement began in the late 1970s and is still an effort currently. Sex work is not specifically associated with prostitution, but rather any type of work that is sexual in nature.

<text>Bath Rugby are a professional rugby union club in Bath, Somerset, England. They play in Premiership Rugby, England&#x27;s top division of rugby. Founded in 1865 as Bath Football Club, since 1894 the club has played at the Recreation Ground in the city centre.

Bath Rugby is one of the most successful clubs in England, having won 18 major trophies. It was particularly successful between 1984 and 1998, when it won 10 Domestic Cups, 6 League titles, and became the first English side to win the European Cup in 1998. In 2008, Bath also won the European Challenge Cup, the continent&#x27;s second-tier competition. However, the club has yet to win a major trophy since then.

Bath is one of only three clubs never to have been relegated from the top division of English rugby. Bath finished 2nd in the 2023–24 Premiership Rugby season, losing the play off final, this entitles them to play in the 2024-25 European Rugby Champions Cup. The current Head of Rugby is Johann van Graan, who started in July 2022. Matches with local rivals Bristol Bears and Gloucester are referred to as West Country derbies. Bath also have a longstanding rivalry with Leicester Tigers.

==History==
===Formation and the early years (1865–1954)===

Bath Football Club is one of the oldest clubs in existence, having been founded in 1865 by members of Lansdown Cricket Club in Bath, for &#x27;something to do in the winter&#x27;. This is the reason why the club colours of the two clubs are identical. With an original home base at The North Parade Ground, in Bathwick, The team then led a nomadic existence during the 1800s playing at Claverton Down, Lambridge Meadows, Taylor&#x27;s Field and Henrietta Park. They then leased a plot of land at Pulteney Meadow, where today&#x27;s Rec stands, with most games played against local opposition: Weston-super-Mare, Gloucester, Clifton and the &quot;Arabs&quot; from Bristol.

By the 1890s, Welsh clubs were starting to become regular opponents, with Cardiff and Penarth regularly appearing in the fixture list. With a traditionally lightweight pack, they would suffer regular defeats. The club played its first fixture against overseas opposition in 1907, as Racing Club de Bordelais crossed the Channel to play at the Rec. 1954 saw a first overseas tour by Bath, who beat the French teams St Claude (23–3).

===Competitive competitions and the glory years (1954–1995)===
The trip was repeated the following year with wins against St Claude (13–8), Dijon (14–0) and Macon (8–3) as captain Peter Sibley was the first to develop the ethos for fast, attacking rugby in the Sixties. With six-foot four-inch players such as England international back row David Gay, Peter Heindorff, Sibley had players with physique to impose this style of play. The side continued to develop Bath&#x27;s reputation in the early Seventies with wins over the top Welsh sides. However, the revolution began with the arrival of coach Jack Rowell in 1978.

Rowell transformed the ethos of a club that had traditionally drawn local players. When formalised competitions started in the 1980s Jack Rowell brought premature professionalism to Bath and began to assemble a side with power and precision. The power, provided by Gareth Chilcott, and the precision of Roger Spurrell, was complemented by the quality of John Horton and winger David Trick. By 1984, the first of ten knock-out cup successes had been achieved, at the expense of Bristol. Bath dominated the Anglo-Welsh Cup final winning it four years on a trot, from 1984 to 1987. Bath, after a blip in 1988, dominated, winning it a further six times.

The formalised rugby structure was formed in 1987, and Bath dominated the early years of the first division, being crowned league champions six times in just eight years and doing the &quot;double&quot; four times. Bath were an unstoppable force in 1988–89 and ran away with the league title, winning the first ten of their eleven league matches. A week later, in the Anglo-Welsh Cup final at Twickenham, Bath beat Leicester 10–6 to become the first English club to do the double of winning both League and Cup. 1990 saw the last of six consecutive Twickenham final wins, with the club defeating Gloucester 48–6. 1993–94 saw the team win the Anglo Welsh Cup, beating Leicester. In May 1996, Bath Rugby and Wigan made history by playing against each other at both codes. The first match was at Maine Road, Manchester under League rules and saw Bath struggle, eventually losing 82–6. In the return fixture under Union rules at Twickenham, Bath were able to regain a measure of pride by beating Wigan 44–19.

===Early Professional era (1995–2021)===

Jack Rowell&#x27;s departure in 1995 and rugby union becoming a professional sport in 1996 had seen Bath struggle to find consistency either on or off the field. With regular changes in the coaching staff and a steady turnaround of players, the formula that led to past successes was still being sought, albeit Bath still managed to be the first British club to lift the European Cup in the 1997–1998 season. Bath beat French club Brive 19–18 in an exciting final in Bordeaux with Jon Callard scoring all the points for Bath. Off the field, the official supporters&#x27; club of Bath Rugby was formed in January 1997.

Despite European glory, Bath slumped to sixth in the league the next season. In the disastrous league campaign of 2002–03, relegation was avoided by only a single point on the last day. Having narrowly avoided relegation and merger with rivals Bristol in the 2002–03 season, the club invested heavily in its squad, the team ended the regular season at the top of the table six points, but lost in the play-off final match at Twickenham. Bath finished 4th in the 2004–05 season and also reached the RFU Cup final, though lost to Leeds at Twickenham after a poor display. By the end of the 2004–05 season, coach John Connolly had announced his intention to return to his native Australia, having created one of the most dominant packs in club rugby.
In 2006 they defeated Leicester Tigers in the quarter finals at a sold out Walkers&#x27; Stadium in Leicester, Bath then went on to lose the semi-finals against Biarritz. As they finished 9th in the league that year, Bath were ineligible for the 2006–07 competition, instead contesting in the European Challenge Cup, the second level of European rugby. Steve Meehan was appointed the new acting head coach in the summer of 2006.

In 2008 Bath won their first trophy in ten years, beating Worcester in the European Challenge Cup. On 14 April 2010, British businessman Bruce Craig bought the club from chairman Andrew Brownsword and set out new plans for the future of the club, including a proposal to create a new club headquarters at Farleigh House and plans to create a new 20,000 seater stadium.

Mike Ford became the club&#x27;s head coach in May 2013. Ford guided Bath to the 2014–15 Premiership Final, where they lost to Saracens. Ford was awarded the Aviva Premiership Director of Rugby of the Year award in 2015 while his son, George Ford, won Player of the Year. However, after a disappointing campaign that saw Bath finish 9th in the table, Mike Ford left the club at the end of the 2015–2016 season.

===Decline &amp; Resurgence (2021–)===
The 2021–22 season was Bath&#x27;s worst ever campaign. In October 2021, they conceded the most points of any Premiership match in their history losing 71–17 at home to Saracens. They finished bottom of the Premiership for the first time in their history, and suffered their greatest ever defeat, against rivals, Gloucester, losing 64–0 at Kingsholm. Ahead of the 2022–23 season, South African coach Johann van Graan joined Bath. Van Graan described Bath as being “broken as a club” when he arrived, but he successfully turned the team around in his first season in charge. The team&#x27;s improvement in form over the course of the campaign culminated with a 61–29 win over Saracens on the final day, which saw them edge neighbours and rivals Bristol Bears for eighth in the table and a place in the 2023–24 Champions Cup.

Bath finished the 2023/2024 regular season in 2nd place, their highest finish since 2015. After defeating Sale Sharks in the semi-final, Bath competed against Northampton Saints in the Premiership Final, where Bath suffered a narrow 25–21 defeat.

In December 2024, Bath defeated Saracens 68–10 to inflict them with their worst defeat in Premiership history. That same month, owner Bruce Craig submitted a planning application for a new 18,000 capacity stadium.

==Stadium==
===The Recreation Ground===
Bath play at the Recreation Ground, also known as &quot;The Rec&quot;. The stadium is in the centre of the city, next to the River Avon. For the 2009–10 season the ground capacity was expanded to 11,700, and Bath play all of their home matches there during the club season. During summer, the ground is adjusted to make it capable for holding cricket matches. This cricket field is used for local contests and hosted Somerset County Cricket Club for one match a year until 2011.

In November 2009 the new chief executive, Nick Blofeld, stated the club is now seeking a mostly seated stadium for 20,000 to suit modern professional rugby, with potential for future expansion, containing &quot;restaurants and cafés, hospitality suites, conference facilities and good food and beverage outlets and other potential retail outlets&quot;. The issue of the charitable status of the Rec has prevented progress, but in 2013 the Charity Commission recommended a scheme to allow the club&#x27;s former training ground at Lambridge to be exchanged for an extended footprint on the Rec free from the charitable rules. While a few appeals remain to be heard, the club is pushing on with designs for an 18,500-seat stadium, and intends to apply for planning permission in 2014. 

The First Tier Tribunal decided to limit the land available to the club which has meant that pending leave to appeal the club&#x27;s development plans have had to be put on ice. As a result, the club has put in a planning application to extend its capacity to 14,000 on a temporary basis for next two seasons to cover their 150th anniversary celebrations in 2015. After being successful with recent planning applications, the club has been able to increase capacity by 1,000 for the 2016/17 season onwards – taking the capacity to 14,500 spectators for home games.

The works took place during the 2016 off-season and saw the West Stand partially demolished and improved facilities provided, including bars, food outlets and toilets. The new consents will last for four years and will enable Bath to focus solely on resolution of a permanent redevelopment solution for the Rec, without on-going debate around temporary stands during this period. Permanent development proposals are intended to be brought forward long before the expiry of the four-year period. Au updated decision in December 2016 from the Charity First-Tier Tribunal relating to a revised Scheme for the governance of the Bath Recreation Ground, including the use of the Recreation Ground site, was said by the club to &quot;re-open the door to redevelopment at the Rec&quot;.

===Twickenham Stadium===

Between the 2016–17 and 2018–19 seasons, Bath Rugby played an annual home fixture at Twickenham Stadium. The fixture; dubbed The Clash was normally played around Easter and formed part of a five-year deal to host games at Twickenham. The 2017 match had an attendance of 61,868, and the 2018 match had 60,880 spectators.

==Kit==
Between 2020 and 2023, the kit was supplied by Macron. On the front of the shirt, Dyson is at the centre. Compeed appears on the left sleeve. On the back of the shirt, Thatchers is at the top with Avon Protection on top of the squad number and Grant UK at the bottom. On the back of the shorts, Dyson (who is also at the centre on the front of the shirt) is on the top while on the bottom, the Bendac Group is on the left and Your Red Car is on the right. Castore are the kit supplier from the 2023–24 season.

<doc id="321032" wikidata="Q465360" url="?curid=321032" title="A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man">
<text>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is the second novel of Irish writer James Joyce, published in 1916. A &quot;Künstlerroman&quot; written in a modernist style, it traces the religious and intellectual awakening of young Stephen Dedalus, Joyce&#x27;s fictional alter ego, whose surname alludes to Daedalus, Greek mythology&#x27;s consummate craftsman. Stephen questions and rebels against the Catholic and Irish conventions under which he has grown, culminating in his self-exile from Ireland to Europe. The work uses techniques that Joyce developed more fully in &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922) and &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (1939).

&quot;A Portrait&quot; began life in 1904 as &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;—a projected 63-chapter autobiographical novel in a realistic style. After 25 chapters, Joyce abandoned &quot;Stephen Hero&quot; in 1907 and set to reworking its themes and protagonist into a condensed five-chapter novel, dispensing with strict realism and making extensive use of free indirect speech that allows the reader to peer into Stephen&#x27;s developing consciousness. American modernist poet Ezra Pound had the novel serialised in the English literary magazine &quot;The Egoist&quot; in 1914 and 1915, and published as a book in 1916 by B. W. Huebsch of New York. The publication of &quot;A Portrait&quot; and the short story collection &quot;Dubliners&quot; (1914) earned Joyce a place at the forefront of literary modernism.

==Background==

Born into a middle-class family in Dublin, Ireland, James Joyce (1882–1941) excelled as a student, graduating from University College, Dublin, in 1902. He moved to Paris to study medicine, but soon gave it up. He returned to Ireland at his family&#x27;s request as his mother was dying of cancer. Despite her pleas, the impious Joyce and his brother Stanislaus refused to make confession or take communion, and when she passed into a coma they refused to kneel and pray for her. After a stretch of failed attempts to get published and launch his own newspaper, Joyce then took jobs teaching, singing and reviewing books.

Joyce made his first attempt at a novel, &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;, in early 1904. That June he saw Nora Barnacle for the first time walking along Nassau Street. Their first date was on June 16, the same date that his novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; takes place. Almost immediately, Joyce and Nora were infatuated with each other and they bonded over their shared disapproval of Ireland and the Church. Nora and Joyce eloped to continental Europe, first staying in Zürich before settling for ten years in Trieste (then in Austria-Hungary), where he taught English. There Nora gave birth to their children, Giorgio in 1905 and Lucia in 1907, and Joyce wrote fiction, signing some of his early essays and stories &quot;Stephen &quot;. The short stories he wrote made up the collection &quot;Dubliners&quot; (1914), which took about eight years to be published due to its controversial nature. While waiting for &quot;Dubliners&quot; to be published, Joyce reworked the core themes of the novel &quot;Stephen Hero&quot; he had begun in Ireland in 1904 and abandoned in 1907 into &quot;A Portrait&quot;, published in 1916, a year after he had moved back to Zürich in the midst of the First World War.

==Composition==
At the request of its editors, Joyce submitted a work of philosophical fiction entitled &quot;A Portrait of the Artist&quot; to the Irish literary magazine &quot;Dana&quot; on 7 January 1904. &quot;Dana&quot;″s editor, W. K. Magee, rejected it, telling Joyce, &quot;I can&#x27;t print what I can&#x27;t understand.&quot; On his 22nd birthday, 2 February 1904, Joyce began a realist autobiographical novel, &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;, which incorporated aspects of the aesthetic philosophy expounded in &quot;A Portrait&quot;. He worked on the book until mid-1905 and brought the manuscript with him when he moved to Trieste that year. Though his main attention turned to the stories that made up &quot;Dubliners&quot;, Joyce continued to work on &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;. At 914 manuscript pages, Joyce considered the book about half-finished, having completed 25 of its 63 intended chapters. In September 1907, however, he abandoned it, and began a complete revision of the text and its structure, producing what became &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;. By 1909 the work had taken shape and Joyce showed some of the draft chapters to Ettore Schmitz, one of his language students, as an exercise. Schmitz, himself a respected writer, was impressed and with his encouragement Joyce continued to work on the book.

In 1911, Joyce flew into a fit of rage over the continued refusals by publishers to print &quot;Dubliners&quot; and threw the manuscript of &quot;Portrait&quot; into the fire. It was saved by a &quot;family fire brigade&quot; including his sister Eileen. &quot;Chamber Music&quot;, a book of Joyce&#x27;s poems, was published in 1907.

Joyce recycled the two earlier attempts at explaining his aesthetics and youth, &quot;A Portrait of the Artist&quot; and &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;, as well as his notebooks from Trieste concerning the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas; they all came together in five carefully paced chapters.

&quot;Stephen Hero&quot; is written from the point of view of an omniscient third-person narrator, but in &quot;A Portrait&quot; Joyce adopts the free indirect style, a change that reflects the moving of the narrative centre of consciousness firmly and uniquely onto Stephen. Persons and events take their significance from Stephen, and are perceived from his point of view. Characters and places are no longer mentioned simply because the young Joyce had known them. Salient details are carefully chosen and fitted into the aesthetic pattern of the novel.

The transition from &quot;Stephen Hero&quot; to &quot;A Portrait&quot; has been characterized as a radical, uncompromising act of refinement: &quot;[T]he original elements of Joyce&#x27;s first novel, particularly the characters, are subjected to a process of compression and distillation that rejects all irrelevancies, all particularities and ambiguities, and leaves only their pure essence.&quot;

==Publication history==

In 1913, W. B. Yeats sent the poem &quot;I Hear an Army&quot; by James Joyce to Ezra Pound, who was assembling an anthology of Imagist verse entitled &quot;Des Imagistes&quot;. Pound wrote to Joyce, and in 1914 Joyce submitted the first chapter of the unfinished &quot;Portrait&quot; to Pound, who was so taken with it that he pressed to have the work serialised in the London literary magazine &quot;The Egoist&quot;. Joyce hurried to complete the novel, and it appeared in &quot;The Egoist&quot; in twenty-five installments from 2 February 1914 to 1 September 1915.

There was difficulty finding a British publisher for the finished novel, so Pound arranged for its publication by an American publishing house, B. W. Huebsch, which issued it on 29 December 1916. The Egoist Press republished it in the United Kingdom on 12 February 1917 and Jonathan Cape took over its publication in 1924. In 1964 Viking Press issued a corrected version overseen by Chester Anderson that drew upon Joyce&#x27;s manuscript, list of corrections, and marginal corrections to proof sheets. This edition is &quot;Widely regarded as reputable and the &#x27;standard&#x27; edition.&quot; As of 2004, the fourth printing of the Everyman&#x27;s Library edition, the Bedford edition, and the Oxford World&#x27;s Classics edition used this text. Garland released a &quot;copy text&quot; edition by Hans Walter Gabler in 1993.

==Major characters==

Source:

* Stephen Dedalus – The main character of &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;. Growing up, Stephen goes through long phases of hedonism and deep religiosity. He eventually adopts a philosophy of aestheticism, greatly valuing beauty and art. Stephen is essentially Joyce&#x27;s alter ego, and many of the events of Stephen&#x27;s life mirror events from Joyce&#x27;s own youth. His surname is taken from the ancient Greek mythical figure Daedalus, who also engaged in a struggle for autonomy.
* Simon Dedalus – Stephen&#x27;s father, an impoverished former medical student with a strong sense of Irish nationalism. Sentimental about his past, Simon Dedalus frequently reminisces about his youth. Loosely based on Joyce&#x27;s own father and their relationship.
* Mary Dedalus – Stephen&#x27;s mother who is very religious and often argues with Stephen about attending services.
* Emma Clery – Stephen&#x27;s beloved, the young girl to whom he is fiercely attracted over the course of many years. Stephen constructs Emma as an ideal of femininity, even though (or because) he does not know her well.
* Charles Stewart Parnell – An Irish political leader who is not an actual character in the novel, but whose death influences many of its characters. Parnell had powerfully led the Irish Parliamentary Party until he was driven out of public life after his affair with a married woman was exposed.
* Cranly – Stephen&#x27;s best friend at university, in whom he confides some of his thoughts and feelings. In this sense Cranly represents a secular confessor for Stephen. Eventually Cranly begins to encourage Stephen to conform to the wishes of his family and to try harder to fit in with his peers, advice that Stephen fiercely resents. Towards the conclusion of the novel he bears witness to Stephen&#x27;s exposition of his aesthetic philosophy. It is partly due to Cranly that Stephen decides to leave, after witnessing Cranly&#x27;s budding (and reciprocated) romantic interest in Emma.
* Dante (Mrs. Riordan) – The governess of the Dedalus children. She is very intense and a dedicated Catholic.
* Lynch – Stephen&#x27;s friend from university who has a rather dry personality.

==Synopsis==
The childhood of Stephen Dedalus is recounted using vocabulary that changes as he grows, in a voice not his own but sensitive to his feelings. The reader experiences Stephen&#x27;s fears and bewilderment as he comes to terms with the world in a series of disjointed episodes. Stephen attends the Jesuit-run Clongowes Wood College, where the apprehensive, intellectually gifted boy suffers the ridicule of his classmates while he learns the schoolboy codes of behaviour. While he cannot grasp their significance, at a Christmas dinner he is witness to the social, political and religious tensions in Ireland involving Charles Stewart Parnell, which drive wedges between members of his family, leaving Stephen with doubts over which social institutions he can place his faith. Back at Clongowes, word spreads that a number of older boys have been caught &quot;smugging&quot; (the term refers to the secret homosexual horseplay that five students were caught at); discipline is tightened, and the Jesuits increase use of corporal punishment. Stephen is strapped when one of his instructors believes he has broken his glasses to avoid studying, but, prodded by his classmates, Stephen works up the courage to complain to the rector, Father Conmee, who assures him there will be no such recurrence, leaving Stephen with a sense of triumph.

Stephen&#x27;s father gets into debt and the family leaves its pleasant suburban home to live in Dublin. Stephen realises that he will not return to Clongowes. However, thanks to a scholarship obtained for him by Father Conmee, Stephen is able to attend Belvedere College, where he excels academically and becomes a class leader. Stephen squanders a large cash prize from school, and begins to see prostitutes, as distance grows between him and his drunken father.

As Stephen abandons himself to sensual pleasures, his class is taken on a religious retreat, where the boys sit through sermons. Stephen pays special attention to those on pride, guilt, punishment and the Four Last Things (death, judgement, Hell, and Heaven). He feels that the words of the sermon, describing horrific eternal punishment in hell, are directed at himself and, overwhelmed, comes to desire forgiveness. Overjoyed at his return to the Church, he devotes himself to acts of ascetic repentance, though they soon devolve to mere acts of routine, as his thoughts turn elsewhere. His devotion comes to the attention of the Jesuits, and they encourage him to consider entering the priesthood. Stephen takes time to consider, but has a crisis of faith because of the conflict between his spiritual beliefs and his aesthetic ambitions. Along Dollymount Strand he spots a girl wading, and has an epiphany in which he is overcome with the desire to find a way to express her beauty in his writing.

As a student at University College, Dublin, Stephen grows increasingly wary of the institutions around him: Church, school, politics and family. In the midst of the disintegration of his family&#x27;s fortunes his father berates him and his mother urges him to return to the Church. An increasingly dry, humourless Stephen explains his alienation from the Church and the aesthetic theory he has developed to his friends, who find that they cannot accept either of them. Stephen concludes that Ireland is too restrictive to allow him to express himself fully as an artist, so he decides that he will have to leave. He sets his mind on self-imposed exile, but not without declaring in his diary his ties to his homeland:

==Style==

The novel is a Bildungsroman and captures the essence of character growth and understanding of the world around him. The novel mixes third-person narrative with free indirect speech, which allows both identification with and distance from Stephen. The narrator refrains from judgement. The omniscient narrator of the earlier &quot;Stephen Hero&quot; informs the reader as Stephen sets out to write &quot;some pages of sorry verse&quot;, while &quot;A Portrait&quot; gives only Stephen&#x27;s attempts, leaving the evaluation to the reader.

The novel is written primarily as a third-person narrative with minimal dialogue until the final chapter. This chapter includes dialogue-intensive scenes alternately involving Stephen, Davin and Cranly. An example of such a scene is the one in which Stephen posits his complex Thomist aesthetic theory in an extended dialogue. According to Sanders, &quot;… it is the eucharistic theology of Thomas Aquinas that most determines the complex aesthetics that Stephen expounds. Although his faith is replaced by scrupulous doubt, Stephen retains an insistent Jesuit authoritarianism in his arguments about definitions of beauty. As the latter stages of the story affirm, Stephen assumes a new priesthood, that of the artist&quot;. Joyce employs first-person narration for Stephen&#x27;s diary entries in the concluding pages of the novel, perhaps to suggest that Stephen has finally found his own voice and no longer needs to absorb the stories of others. Joyce fully employs the free indirect style to demonstrate Stephen&#x27;s intellectual development from his childhood, through his education, to his increasing independence and ultimate exile from Ireland as a young man. The style of the work progresses through each of its five chapters, as the complexity of language and Stephen&#x27;s ability to comprehend the world around him both gradually increase. The book&#x27;s opening pages communicate Stephen&#x27;s first stirrings of consciousness when he is a child. Throughout the work language is used to describe indirectly the state of mind of the protagonist and the subjective effect of the events of his life.

The writing style is notable also for Joyce&#x27;s omission of quotation marks: he indicates dialogue by beginning a paragraph with a dash, as is commonly used in French, Spanish or Russian publications.

The first two pages of &quot;A Portrait&quot; introduce many of the novel&#x27;s key motifs, and have been shown to &quot;enact the entire action in microcosm&quot;.

Joyce introduced the concept of &quot;epiphany&quot; in &quot;Stephen Hero&quot; to preface a discussion of Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s three criteria of beauty, wholeness, harmony, and radiance: when the object &quot;seems to us radiant, [it] achieves its epiphany&quot;. The term is not used when Stephen Dedalus explains his aesthetic theory in &quot;A Portrait&quot;. Joyce critics, however, have used it freely when discussing the novel as well as &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. One critic has identified four distinct epiphany techniques in Joyce&#x27;s fiction, saying of &quot;A Portrait&quot; that &quot;in at least three instances an epiphany helps Stephen decide on the future courses of this life&quot;.

Stephen Dedalus&#x27;s aesthetic theory identifies three forms of literary art: lyric, epic, and dramatic. The Canadian scholar Hugh Kenner saw the three forms of literary art as a progression that applies to his novels, with &quot;A Portrait&quot; being lyric, &quot;Ulysses&quot; epic, and &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; dramatic. William York Tindall has noted that other critics have applied the three forms differently, some finding all Joyce&#x27;s works dramatic, one finding all three forms in &quot;A Portrait&quot;, another finding them in &quot;Ulysses&quot; &quot;with more justification from the text perhaps&quot;. Tindall has speculated on how they might apply to &quot;A Portrait&quot;, Stephen being &quot;lyric in his attitude toward himself&quot;, Joyce being dramatic in his attitude toward Stephen, so that at times &quot;he is the author of a dramatic book about a lyric hero&quot;, while at other times he is an ironist and so &quot;seems epic... standing between audience and victim&quot;.

==Themes==
===Identity===
As a narrative which depicts a character throughout his formative years, M. Angeles Conde-Parrilla posits that identity is possibly the most prevalent theme in the novel. Towards the beginning of the novel, Joyce depicts the young Stephen&#x27;s growing consciousness, which is said to be a condensed version of the arc of Dedalus&#x27; entire life, as he continues to grow and form his identity. Stephen&#x27;s growth as an individual character is important because through him Joyce laments Irish society&#x27;s tendency to force individuals to conform to types, which some say marks Stephen as a modernist character. Themes that run through Joyce&#x27;s later novels find expression there.

===Religion===
As Stephen transitions into adulthood, he leaves behind his Catholic religious identity, which is closely tied to the national identity of Ireland. His rejection of this dual identity is also a rejection of constraint and an embrace of freedom in identity. Furthermore, the references to Dr Faustus throughout the novel conjure up something demonic in Stephen renouncing his Catholic faith. When Stephen stoutly refuses to serve his Easter duty later in the novel, his tone mirrors characters like Faust and Lucifer in its rebelliousness.

In Catholicism, &quot;Eucharist&quot; refers both to the act of Consecration, or transubstantiation, and its product, the body and blood of Christ under the appearances of bread and wine. It is the Church&#x27;s central sacrament. Stephen uses it to dramatize his apostasy. He refuses to take communion during Easter time, every Catholic&#x27;s duty, to show he is a Catholic no longer. He notes that the Eucharist is &quot;a symbol behind which are massed twenty centuries of authority and veneration&quot;. Stephen parallels the literary artist with the Catholic priest and literary art with the Eucharist, both the act and the product. He sees himself as &quot;The priest of eternal imagination transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everliving life.&quot; 

===Myth of Daedalus===
The myth of Daedalus and Icarus has parallels in the structure of the novel, and gives Stephen his surname, as well as the epigraph containing a quote from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. According to Ivan Canadas, the epigraph may parallel the heights and depths that end and begin each chapter, and can be seen to proclaim the interpretive freedom of the text. Stephen&#x27;s surname being connected to Daedalus may also call to mind the theme of going against the status quo, as Daedalus defies the King of Crete.

===Irish identity===
Stephen&#x27;s struggle to find identity in the novel parallels the Irish struggle for independence during the early twentieth century. He rejects any outright nationalism, and is often prejudiced toward those that use Hiberno-English, which was the marked speech patterns of the Irish rural and lower-class. However, he is also heavily concerned with his country&#x27;s future and understands himself as an Irishman, which then leads him to question how much of his identity is tied up in said nationalism.

=== The artist ===
Richard Ellmann wrote that Joyce &quot;recognized his theme, the portrait of the renegade Catholic artist as hero&quot;. Critics have examined his debt to the Church theologian Thomas Aquinas for Stephen Dedalus&#x27;s aesthetic theory. It&#x27;s been argued that the theory also draws upon Catholicism&#x27;s central doctrines in each of its two parts: the first concerned with the artist&#x27;s intellect, the second with his imagination. Catholic theology distinguishes between God&#x27;s activity in eternity, His begetting of the Son, the Word, and His activity in time: the Creation (soul and body), the Incarnation—the Word made flesh—and the Consecration in the Mass. Stephen uses Aquinas&#x27;s application of the three criteria of beauty to the Son of God in eternity to model the artist&#x27;s act of understanding—&quot;epiphany&quot; in &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;—and then uses the Creation to model the artist&#x27;s act of (re)embodiment. In his reveries later, Stephen completes his aesthetic theory by also likening the artist to God at the Incarnation and, in the person of His priest, at the Consecration.

==Critical reception==

&quot;A Portrait&quot; won Joyce a reputation for his literary skills, as well as a patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver, the business manager of &quot;The Egoist&quot;.

In 1916, in his reader&#x27;s report to Duckworth &amp; Co., Publishers, Edward Garnett wrote that, to make it publishable, &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; needed to undergo extensive revision, especially at the beginning and the end. The public would call the book &quot;as it stands at present, realistic, unprepossessing, unattractive&quot;. He said it was &quot;ably written&quot; and &quot;arouse[d] interest and attention&quot;, and he approved of the rendering of the period and the characterizations. But he found the novel &quot;too discursive, formless, unrestrained, and ugly things, ugly words, are too prominent&quot;. He concluded that the &quot;author shows us he has art, strength and originality&quot;, but needed &quot;to shape [his novel] more carefully as the product of the craftsmanship, mind and imagination of an artist&quot;.

In 1917 H. G. Wells wrote that &quot;one believes in Stephen Dedalus as one believes in few characters in fiction&quot;, while warning readers of Joyce&#x27;s &quot; obsession&quot;, his insistence on the portrayal of bodily functions that Victorian morality had banished from print.

In 1917 Ezra Pound wrote, &quot;James Joyce produces the nearest thing to Flaubertian prose that we now have in English.&quot; &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; &quot;will remain a permanent part of English literature.&quot; He went on to further praise Joyce for writing in accord with Imagist standards: &quot;Apart from Mr. Joyce&#x27;s realism... apart from, or a piece with, all this is style, the actual writing: hard clear-cut, with no waste of words, no bungling up of useless phrases, no filling in with pages of slosh.&quot;

The following year Pound wrote, &quot;[Joyce] has his scope beyond that of the novelists his contemporaries, in just so far as whole stretches of his keyboard are utterly outside of their compass.&quot; He continued, &quot;[In] &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; there is no omission; there is nothing in life so beautiful that Joyce cannot touch it without profanation—without, above all, the profanations of sentiment and sentimentality—and there is nothing so sordid that he cannot treat it with metallic exactitude.&quot;

In 1927 E. M. Forster wrote, &quot;[Joyce] has shown (especially in the &quot;Portrait of the Artist&quot;) an imaginative grasp of evil. But he undermines the universe in too work-manlike a manner, looking round for this tool or that: in spite of all his internal looseness he is too tight, he is never vague except after due deliberation; it is talk, talk, never song.&quot;

In 1927 Wyndham Lewis criticized Joyce&#x27;s diction in a sentence from chapter 2 of &quot;A Portrait&quot;:

Fifty years later, Hugh Kenner used Lewis&#x27;s criticism to formulate what he called the Uncle Charles Principle. &quot;Repaired&quot; and &quot;brushed scrupulously&quot; are words Uncle Charles himself would use to describe what he was doing. Kenner argued, &quot;This is apparently new in fiction, the normally neutral narrative vocabulary invaded by little clouds of idioms which a character might use if he were managing the narrative. In Joyce&#x27;s various extensions of this device we have one clue to the manifold styles of &quot;Ulysses&quot;.&quot;

Kenner, writing in 1948, was critical of Stephen Dedalus, the protagonist of &quot;A Portrait&quot;, arguing that he &quot;does not become an artist at all... but an aesthete&quot; and &quot;to take him seriously is very hard indeed&quot;. Kenner lamented, &quot;[I]t is painful to be invited to close the book with an indigestibly Byronic hero stuck in our throats.&quot;

A later version of Kenner&#x27;s 1948 essay appeared in his first book on Joyce published in 1955.

Writing in 1959, William York Tindall was also critical of Stephen Dedalus, saying &quot;he never sees himself entirely&quot;. Tindall regretted Stephen&#x27;s &quot;failure to realize himself&quot;, adding that &quot;this is attended to in &quot;Ulysses&quot;, which makes &quot;A Portrait&quot; seem preliminary sketch.&quot;

In 1963 S. L. Goldberg took issue with Kenner&#x27;s negative appraisal of Stephen, conceding that &quot;Mr. Kenner is certainly right in pointing to the irony with which Joyce views him in both the &quot;Portrait&quot; and &quot;Ulysses&quot;&quot;, but faulting him for concluding that in doing so Joyce is rejecting Stephen himself. For Goldberg, Joyce&#x27;s &quot;irony is a qualifying criticism, which does not imply a total rejection&quot;.

==Adaptations==
A film version adapted for the screen by Judith Rascoe and directed by Joseph Strick was released in 1977. It features Bosco Hogan as Stephen Dedalus and T. P. McKenna as Simon Dedalus. John Gielgud plays Father Arnall, the priest whose lengthy sermon on Hell terrifies the teenage Stephen.

The first stage version was produced by Léonie Scott-Matthews at Pentameters Theatre in 2012 using an adaptation by Tom Neill.

Hugh Leonard&#x27;s stage work &quot;Stephen D&quot; is an adaptation of &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; and &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;. It was first produced at the Gate Theatre during the Dublin Theatre Festival of 1962.

As of 2017 computer scientists and literature scholars at University College Dublin, Ireland are in a collaboration to create the multimedia version of this work, by charting the social networks of characters in the novel. Animations in the multimedia editions express the relation of every character in the chapter to the others.

<text>A long firm fraud (also known as a &quot;consumer credit fraud&quot;) is a crime that uses a trading company set up for fraudulent purposes; the basic operation is to run the company as an apparently legitimate business by buying goods and paying suppliers promptly to secure a good credit record. Once they are sufficiently well-established, the perpetrators purchase the next round of goods on credit, then decamp with the goods and profits from previous sales. The goods can then be sold elsewhere. The procedure needs a certain amount of money to set up, often the proceeds from another crime or a previous long firm. Sometimes an individual who does time in jail for assisting the fraud is paid for the time served. Long firm frauds have become significantly less common in recent years since it is no longer possible to operate for any length of time without leaving a significant .

The name of the practice originated from the Kray twins&#x27; organized crime gang in 1960s London, known as &quot;the Firm.&quot; The gang practiced both quick (&quot;short&quot;) scams and &quot;long&quot; ones, that took time to set up and execute; these were known as &quot;long firm&quot; jobs.

<text>Dhardo Rinpoche (1917-1990), born Thubten Lhundup Legsang, was the 12th in a line of tulkus from Dhartsendo on the eastern border of Tibet who hailed from the Nyingma Gompa in Dhartsendo called Dorje Drak (not to be confused with Dorje Drak in Central Tibet). The 11th tulku rose to the Abbot of Drepung and during the 1912 invasion of Tibet by China was the most senior of the retired abbots in the National Assembly. He died in 1916 and the 12th Tulku was born in 1917.

Dhardo Rinpoche was educated in the traditional Tibetan monastic style, taking his Geshe Degree and graduating at the Lharmapa level at Drepung Monastery, and doing further study at Gyud-med Tantric College. In 1951 he was appointed abbot of the Tibetan monastery at Bodh Gaya, and from 1954 onwards combined this with a few months per year stay in Kalimpong near the India-Tibet border. Kalimpong was to become an important staging post for Tibetans fleeing the Chinese invasion. Dhardo Rinpoche founded the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Cultural Institute (ITBCI), in 1952 which then opened an orphanage and school for Tibetan refugees. He was abbot of Yiga Choeling Monastery, Ghoom from 1964 till his death in 1990.

During the 1950s and 1960s Dhardo Rinpoche was friend and teacher to Sangharakshita, an English Buddhist who spent 14 years based in Kalimpong before returning to England to found the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO), now the Triratna Buddhist Community. Sangharakshita considered Dhardo Rinpoche to be a living bodhisattva and he is still revered as such in the Triratna Community. In the 1980s the FWBO&#x27;s charity Aid For India (now known as the Karuna Trust (UK)) undertook to provide funding for the ITBCI School.

Portions of Dhardo Rinpoche&#x27;s relics, the ashes from his cremation, have been installed in several stupas in the West: at Sudarshanaloka Retreat Centre (near Thames, New Zealand), at Padmaloka Buddhist Retreat Centre (near Norwich, England), at Guhyaloka Retreat Centre, (near Alicante, Spain), at Tiratanaloka Retreat Centre in Wales, at Vimaladhatu Retreat Centre in Sauerland, Germany, and at Aryaloka Buddhist Center in New Hampshire, USA.

Dhardo Rinpoche&#x27;s motto was: &quot;Cherish the doctrine; live united; radiate love&quot;, which also became the motto of the school he founded. He was concerned especially to teach the children at his school that &quot;actions have consequences&quot;.

The thirteenth in the line of Tulkus, Tenzin Legshad Wangdi, was born in 1991 and still goes by the name of Dhardo Tulku.
