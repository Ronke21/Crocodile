<text>The Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), or common spoonbill, is a wading bird of the ibis and spoonbill family Threskiornithidae, native to Europe, Africa and Asia. The species is partially migratory with the more northerly breeding populations mostly migrating south for the winter.

==Taxonomy==
The Eurasian spoonbill was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the current binomial name &quot;Platalea leucorodia&quot;. Linnaeus cited works by earlier authors including the description and illustration by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin that was published in 1734. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe but restricted it to Sweden in 1761. The genus name &quot;Platalea&quot; is Latin and means &quot;broad&quot;, referring to the distinctive shape of the bill; the specific epithet &quot;leucorodia&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;leukerodios&quot; meaning &quot;spoonbill&quot;, itself derived from &quot;leukos&quot;, &quot;white&quot; and &quot;erodios&quot; &quot;heron&quot;. A molecular phylogenetic study of the spoonbills based on mitochondrial DNA found that the Eurasian spoonbill is sister taxon to a clade containing the royal and black-faced spoonbills. In England it was traditionally known as the &quot;shovelard&quot;, a name later used for the northern shoveler.

Three subspecies are recognised. These are listed below with their breeding ranges.
* &quot;P. l. leucorodia&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – Europe to north China, India and Sri Lanka
* &quot;P. l. balsaci&quot; Naurois &amp; Roux, F, 1974 – west Mauritania
* &quot;P. l. archeri&quot; Neumann, 1928 – coasts of the Red Sea and Somalia

The royal spoonbill (&quot;Platalea regia&quot;) was formerly considered as a subspecies. Birds in Asia were sometimes separated as &quot;P. l. major&quot;.

==Description==

This species is almost unmistakable in most of its range. The breeding bird is all white except for its dark legs, black bill with a yellow tip, and a yellow breast patch like a pelican. It has a crest in the breeding season. Non-breeders lack the crest and breast patch, and immature birds have a pale bill and black tips to the primary flight feathers. Unlike herons, spoonbills fly with their necks outstretched. The Eurasian spoonbill differs from the African spoonbill with which in overlaps in winter, in that the latter species has a red face and legs, and no crest.

They are mostly silent. Even at their breeding colonies the main sounds are bill snapping, occasional deep grunting and occasional trumpeting noises.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is found widely in Europe, Asia and Africa. In Europe, it breeds from the United Kingdom and Portugal in the west, locally through the continent; ranging north to Denmark and east to the Balkans and the Black Sea. In Asia, it breeds in a broad band across the central part of the continent, from the Black Sea to the Korean Peninsula, as well as Kuwait, southern Iraq, Iran, southern Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka. In Africa, it breeds locally in coastal Mauritania, but more widely along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden coasts. Whereas those breeding in warmer parts of Asia, in Africa and the Iberian Peninsula are resident or only move locally, more northern breeders generally migrate south to winter in southwestern Europe, the northern half of Africa or warm parts of Asia. However, some northern birds do remain in the general region during the winter, including the United Kingdom, the Low Countries and France.

Eurasian spoonbills show a preference for extensive, shallow wetlands with muddy clay or fine, sandy beds. They may inhabit any type of marsh, river, lake, floodplain or mangrove swamp, be it fresh, brackish or saline water. They are especially attracted to locations with undisturbed islands for nesting and habitats with dense, riparian-emergent vegetation (e.g. reedbeds) and scattered trees/shrubs, especially willow &quot;Salix&quot; spp., oak &quot;Quercus &quot;spp. or poplar &quot;Populus&quot; spp. Eurasian spoonbills may also frequent sheltered marine habitats during the winter, such as deltas, estuaries, tidal creeks and coastal lagoons.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
More northerly breeding populations are fully migratory but may only migrate short distances while other, more southerly populations are resident and nomadic or partially migratory. In the Palearctic, the species breeds in spring (e.g. from April) but in tropical parts of its range it times breeding to coincide with rainfall. Breeding is normally in single species colonies or in small single species groups amidst mixed-species colonies of other waterbirds such as herons, egrets and cormorants. Outside the breeding season Eurasian spoonbills forage singly or in small flocks of up to 100 individuals. Migration is usually conducted in flocks of up to 100 individuals. Most activity takes place during the morning and evening (although in coastal areas foraging is governed by tidal rhythms), they often roost communally in roosts which are up to away from the feeding areas.

The nest is a platform of sticks and vegetation which is either constructed on the ground on islands in lakes and rivers or in dense stands of reeds, bushes, mangroves or deciduous trees up to above the ground. Within colonies neighbouring nests are usually quite close together, no more than apart. Breeding colonies are normally sited within of feeding areas, often much less (although the species may also feed up to away).

===Food and feeding===
The diet consists of aquatic insects, mollusks, newts, crustaceans, worms, leeches, frogs, tadpoles and small fish up to long. It may also take algae or small fragments of aquatic plants (although these are possibly ingested accidentally with animal matter). They use sideways sweeps of their beaks to filter out the tiny fish and shrimps.

==Conservation==
Overall, the Eurasian spoonbill is not threatened and the total global population was estimated at 63–65,000 mature birds in 2015. In Europe, the population experienced a significant decrease between 1960 and 1990, but since then it has been increasing and was estimated to number 29,000 mature birds in 2020. For example, in the Netherlands, the population had reached a low point of less than 150 breeding pairs in 1968, but due to better habitat protection and bans of toxins like DDT it rapidly increased from the 1980s, reaching almost 3000 pairs by 2015. Up to the early 2000s, in Europe only the Netherlands, Spain, Austria, Hungary and Greece had sizeable breeding populations. The northernmost part of the Eurasian spoonbill&#x27;s range is in Denmark where the first known breeding was in 1900. Through the 1900s, this breeding population was small and highly irregular, including long periods with none. The species became more thoroughly established in Denmark in 1996 (where a few birds, likely from the Netherlands, arrived and began breeding) and its population has since rapidly increased with multiple colonies; first passing 100 pairs in 2011, and with almost 600 pairs as of 2021. It is likely that this northward spread has been aided by increasing temperatures. In the United Kingdom, it was extirpated around 1668, although in the previous century it had been a widespread breeding species in southern England and Wales, even near London. There were breeding attempts again in the mid-1990s, with the first successful breeding in 1998. This culminated with the formation of a small colony of 6 breeding pairs at Holkham in Norfolk in 2010. In 2011, 8 breeding pairs nested, successfully fledging 14 young, and in 2018 the colony had increased to 28 breeding pairs.

Threats to the Eurasian spoonbill include habitat loss and degradation by drainage and pollution, it is especially adversely affected by the disappearance of reed swamps. In Greece disturbance from fishing once caused the population to decline, and human exploitation of eggs and nestlings for food has threatened the species in the past. Breeding colonies are highly vulnerable to general disturbances and predators like red fox. Consequently, colonies are often restricted to islands free of ground predators; however, in some places, pairs in mainland colonies may breed successfully by nesting off the ground in trees and bushes.

The research network Eurasian Spoonbill International Expert Group was formed in 1991. It made an action plan for the bird in 2008. In 2013 the group joined the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds.

<text>Sumya Anani (born February 12, 1972) is a retired American professional female boxer nicknamed &quot;The Island Girl.&quot; She was 5&#x27;6&quot; and boxed as a junior welterweight. She is best known for a 1996 bout which left her opponent severely injured and may have served as an inspiration for the film &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;. Outside the ring, she is a yoga instructor and holistic healer.

Anani was born in Minnesota and raised in Kansas. She competed as a weightlifter in 1995 and 1996. She took up boxing for self-defense and started boxing professionally because she was &quot;short on cash.&quot; She began to box professionally in the summer of 1996.

She began by boxing against relatively unknown opponents. Her fourth professional bout was in St. Joseph, Missouri against Katie Dallam, a novice welterweight who had only gotten her pro boxing license the day before — a pairing described as &quot;an obvious mismatch.&quot; In four rounds she landed 119 blows to Dallam&#x27;s head. Dallam collapsed in her dressing room afterward and required brain surgery. Anani was so upset she considered quitting boxing.

She came to prominence in the boxing world on September 30, 1997, when she defeated former WIBF lightweight champion Stacy Prestage by a knockout. On March 28, 1998 she scored &quot;the sport&#x27;s biggest upset&quot; with a unanimous six-round decision over veteran Andrea DeShong, considered &quot;the standard bearer for the sport.&quot; On December 18, 1998, she fought boxing star Christy Martin and won the match, handing Martin her first defeat since November 1989.

In 2016, Anani was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The IWBHF was created and founded by Sue TL Fox.

<text>Kairos () is an ancient Greek word meaning &#x27;the right or critical moment&#x27;. In modern Greek, &quot;kairos&quot; also means &#x27;weather&#x27; or &#x27;time&#x27;.

It is one of two words that the ancient Greeks had for &#x27;time&#x27;; the other being (). Whereas the latter refers to chronological or sequential time, &quot;kairos&quot; signifies a good or proper time for action. In this sense, while is quantitative, &quot;kairos&quot; has a qualitative, permanent nature.

The plural, () means &#x27;the times&#x27;. &quot;Kairos&quot; is a term, idea, and practice that has been applied in several fields including classical rhetoric, modern rhetoric, digital media, Christian theology, and science.

==Origins==
In his 1951 etymological studies of the word, Onians traces the primary root back to ancient Greek associations with both archery and weaving.
In archery, &quot;kairos&quot; denotes the moment in which an arrow may be shot with sufficient force to penetrate a target. In weaving, &quot;kairos&quot; denotes the moment in which the shuttle could be passed through threads on the loom. Similarly, in his &quot;Kaironomia&quot; (1983), E.C. White defines &quot;kairos&quot; as the &quot;long, tunnel-like aperture through which the archer&#x27;s arrow has to pass&quot;, and as the moment &quot;when the weaver must draw the yarn through a gap that momentarily opens in the warp of the cloth being woven&quot;. Both are examples of the precise timing of a decision/action to achieve the best outcome.

In the literature of the classical ancient world, writers and orators used &quot;kairos&quot; to specify moments of opportune action, often through metaphors involving archery and one&#x27;s ability to aim and shoot at the exact right time on-target. The ancient Greeks formulated &quot;kairos&quot; in general as a tool to explain and understand the of humans for their actions and the due consequences.

&quot;Kairos&quot; is also an alternate spelling of the name of the minor Greek deity Caerus, the god of luck and opportunity.

==In classical rhetoric==

In rhetoric, &quot;kairos&quot; is &quot;a passing instant when an opening appears which must be driven through with force if success is to be achieved.&quot; &quot;Kairos&quot;, then, means that one must find the best situation, taking timing into consideration, to act.

&quot;Kairos&quot; was central to the Sophists, who stressed the rhetor&#x27;s ability to adapt to and take advantage of changing and contingent circumstances. In &quot;Panathenaicus&quot;, Isocrates writes that educated people are those &quot;who manage well the circumstances which they encounter day by day, and who possess a judgment which is accurate in meeting occasions as they arise and rarely misses the expedient course of action.&quot;

&quot;Kairos&quot; is also very important in Aristotle&#x27;s scheme of rhetoric. &quot;Kairos&quot; is, for Aristotle, the time and space context in which the proof will be delivered. &quot;Kairos&quot; stands alongside other contextual elements of rhetoric: &quot;The Audience&quot;, which is the psychological and emotional makeup of those who will receive the proof; and &quot;To Prepon&quot;, which is the style with which the orator clothes the proof.

In Ancient Greece, &quot;kairos&quot; was utilized by both of the two main schools of thought in the field of rhetoric, focusing specifically on how &quot;kairos&quot; applies to speeches. The competing schools were those of the Sophists and their opposition, led by philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato. Sophism approached rhetoric as an art form. Members of the school would travel around Greece teaching citizens about the art of rhetoric and successful discourse. In his article &quot;Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric&quot;, John Poulakos defines rhetoric from a Sophistic perspective as follows: &quot;Rhetoric is the art which seeks to capture in opportune moments that which is appropriate and attempts to suggest that which is possible.&quot; Aristotle and Plato, on the other hand, viewed Sophistic rhetoric as a tool used to manipulate others, and criticized those who taught it. 
&quot;Kairos&quot; fits into the Sophistic scheme of rhetoric in conjunction with the ideas of prepon and dynaton. These two terms combined with &quot;kairos&quot; are their keys to successful rhetoric. As stated by Poulakos, Prepon deals with the notion that &quot;what is said must conform to both audience and occasion.&quot; Dynaton has to do with the idea of the possible, or what the speaker is attempting to convince the audience of. &quot;Kairos&quot; in the Sophistic context is based on the thought that speech must happen at a certain time in order for it to be most effective. If rhetoric is to be meaningful and successful, it must be presented at the right moment, or else it will not have the same impact on the members of the audience. 
Aristotle and his followers also discuss the importance of &quot;kairos&quot; in their teachings. In his &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, one of the ways that Aristotle uses the idea of &quot;kairos&quot; is in reference to the specificity of each rhetorical situation. Aristotle believed that each rhetorical situation was different, and therefore different rhetorical devices needed to be applied at that point in time. One of the most well known parts of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Rhetoric&quot; is when he discusses the roles of pathos, ethos, and logos. Aristotle ties &quot;kairos&quot; to these concepts, claiming that there are times in each rhetorical situation when one needs to be utilized over the others.

&quot;Kairos&quot; has classically been defined as a concept that focused on &quot;the uniquely timely, the spontaneous, the radically particular.&quot; Ancient Pythagoreans thought &quot;kairos&quot; to be one of the most fundamental laws of the universe. &quot;Kairos&quot; was said to piece together the dualistic ways of the entire universe. Empedocles was the philosopher who connected &quot;kairos&quot; to the principle of opposites and harmony. It then became the principle of conflict and resolution and was thus inserted as a concept for rhetoric.

==Modern rhetorical definition==
Aaron Hess (2011) submits a definition of &quot;kairos&quot; for the present day that bridges the two classical applications: Hess addresses Poulakos&#x27; view that, &quot;In short, &quot;kairos&quot; dictates that what is said, must be said at the right time.&quot; He also suggests that in addition to timeliness, &quot;kairos&quot; considers appropriateness. According to Hess, &quot;kairos&quot; can either be understood as, &quot;the decorum or propriety of any given moment and speech act, implying a reliance on the given or known&quot;, or as &quot;the opportune, spontaneous, or timely.&quot; Although these two ideas of &quot;kairos&quot; might seem conflicting, Hess says that they offer a more extensive understanding of the term. Furthermore, they encourage creativity, which is necessary to adapt to unforeseen obstacles and opinions that can alter the opportune or appropriate moment, i.e. &quot;kairos&quot;. Being able to recognize the propriety of a situation while having the ability to adapt one&#x27;s rhetoric allows taking advantage of &quot;kairos&quot; to be successful. Hess&#x27;s updated definition of &quot;kairos&quot; concludes that along with taking advantage of the timeliness and appropriateness of a situation, the term also implies being knowledgeable of and involved in the environment where the situation is taking place in order to benefit fully from seizing the opportune moment.
Hess&#x27; conflicting perspective on &quot;kairos&quot; is exemplified by the disagreement between Lloyd Bitzer (1968) and Richard Vatz (1983) about the &#x27;rhetorical situation&#x27;. Bitzer argues that &#x27;rhetorical situations&#x27; exist independent of human perspective; a situation invites discourse. He discusses the feeling of a missed opportunity (&quot;kairos&quot;) to speak and the tendency to create a later speech in response to that unseized moment. However, Vatz counters Bitzer&#x27;s view by claiming that a situation is made rhetorical by the perception of its interpreter and the way which they choose to respond to it, whether with discourse or not. It is the rhetor&#x27;s responsibility to give an event meaning through linguistic depiction. Both Bitzer&#x27;s and Vatz&#x27; perspectives add depth to Hess&#x27; ideas that &quot;kairos&quot; is concerned with both timeliness and appropriateness. On one hand, Bitzer&#x27;s argument supports Hess&#x27; claim that &quot;kairos&quot; is spontaneous, and one must be able to recognize the situation as opportune in order to take advantage of it. On the other hand, Vatz&#x27; idea that the rhetor is responsible reinforces Hess&#x27; suggestion of the need to be knowledgeable and involved in the surrounding environment in order to fully profit from the situation.

According to Bitzer, &quot;kairos&quot; is composed of exigence, audience, and constraints. Exigence is the inherent pressure to do something about a situation immediately, with the action required depending on the situation. The audience are the listeners who the rhetor is attempting to persuade. Constraints are the external factors that challenges the rhetor&#x27;s ability to influence, such as the audience&#x27;s personal beliefs and motivations.

Additionally, factors such as cultural background, previous social experiences, and current mood, can influence the capacity to see and understand the correct and opportune moment of action. Thus, the difficulty of using &quot;kairos&quot; in a modern rhetorical setting is understanding and working within its constraints, while also carefully considering unexpected situations and encounters that arise, in order to present one&#x27;s rhetorical argument as naturally as possible.

Definitions of &quot;kairos&quot; using modern English are inherently vague: There is no one word in today&#x27;s English language that succinctly encompasses the meaning of &quot;kairos&quot; (similar to &quot;ethos&quot;, &quot;logos&quot;, and &quot;pathos&quot;). Michael Harker (2007) says, &quot;Like the &#x27;points&#x27; on the rhetorical triangle, the meaning of &quot;kairos&quot; is not definitive but rather a starting point for grasping the whole of an argument.&quot; The inclusion of &quot;kairos&quot; in modern composition has not been implicitly made, but there are undertones. Various components of &quot;kairos&quot; are included in modern composition and have made profound effects on modern composition theory.

The purpose of &quot;kairos&quot; in modern rhetoric is mostly focused on the placement of logos, pathos, and ethos. It is used as a &quot;starting point&quot; in modern rhetoric. Kelly Pender (2003) states the inclusion of &quot;kairos&quot; within discourse &quot;would try to shift the focus of personal writing from the writer&#x27;s experiences and emotions to a broader perspective that explicitly concentrates on the rhetorical situation ...&quot; &quot;Kairos&quot; is an expressive inclusion within the overall subject of discourse, and one that has an effect on the entire rhetoric.

Christian Lundberg and William Keith (2008) describe &quot;kairos&quot; in their rhetoric guide as the concept that &quot;there is an exact right time to deliver a message if the audience is to be persuaded.&quot; Concepts such as relevance, recent events, and who the audience is play a role in determining the right moment to speak. Which has to do with the implications of the original definition for &quot;kairos&quot;. This implication is if &quot;the target was moving and the soldier only had a narrow gap, the timing of the shot was crucial.&quot;

Douglas Downs (2016) defines &quot;kairos&quot; as the principle of rhetors having little influence over their discourse, which causes them to convey what makes sense in the moment. &quot;Kairos&quot; serves as a reminder that many of the topics rhetors will respond to are well out of their scope of control.

==In Christian theology==
In the New Testament, &quot;kairos&quot; means &quot;the appointed time in the purpose of God,&quot; the time when God acts (e.g. : the &quot;kairos&quot; is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand). &quot;Kairos&quot; (used 86 times in the New Testament) refers to an opportune time, a &quot;moment&quot; or a &quot;season&quot; such as &quot;harvest time&quot;, whereas &quot;chronos&quot; (used 54 times) refers to a specific amount of time, such as a day or an hour (e.g. and ). Jesus makes a distinction in between &quot;His&quot; time and &quot;His brothers&#x27;&quot; time: paradoxically, it is &quot;always&quot; () his brothers&#x27; time. In the context, they can go to Jerusalem any time they wish.

In the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches, before the Divine Liturgy begins, the Deacon exclaims to the Priest, (), i.e. &#x27;It is time [&quot;kairos&quot;] for the Lord to act&#x27;, indicating that the time of the Liturgy is an intersection with Eternity.

In &quot;The Interpretation of History&quot;, neo-orthodox Lutheran theologian Paul Tillich made prominent use of the term. For him, the &quot;kairoi&quot; are those crises in history (see Christian existentialism) which create an opportunity for, and indeed demand, an existential decision by the human subject—the coming of Christ being the prime example (compare Karl Barth&#x27;s use of &quot;Geschichte&quot; as opposed to &quot;Historie&quot;). In the Kairos Document, an example of liberation theology in South Africa under apartheid, the term &quot;kairos&quot; is used to denote &quot;the appointed time,&quot; &quot;the crucial time&quot; into which the document or text is spoken.

==In science==

In Hippocrates&#x27; (460–357 BCE) major theoretical treatises on the nature of medical science and methodology, the term &quot;kairos&quot; is used within the first line. Hippocrates is generally accepted as the father of medicine, but his contribution to the discourse of science is less discussed. While &quot;kairos&quot; most often refers to &quot;the right time,&quot; Hippocrates also used the term when referencing experimentation. Using this term allowed him to &quot;express the variable components of medical practice more accurately.&quot; Here the word refers more to proportion, the mean, and the implicit sense of right measure.

Hippocrates most famous quote about &quot;kairos&quot; is &quot;every kairos is a chronos, but not every chronos is a kairos.&quot;

In &quot;A Rhetoric of Doing: Essays on Written Discourse in Honor of James L. Kinneavy&quot; by Stephen Paul Witte, Neil Nakadate, and Roger Dennis Cherry (1992) also discusses the art of &quot;kairos&quot; in the field of science. Citing John Swales, the essay notes that the introduction sections of scientific research articles are nothing more than the construction of openings. This idea derives from the spatial aspect of &quot;kairos&quot;, or the creation of &quot;an opening,&quot; which can be created by writers and discovered by readers. This opening is the opportune time, or &quot;kairos&quot;. Swales created what he called the &quot;create a research space&quot; model, wherein &quot;kairos&quot;, or an opening, was constructed. It consisted of four rhetorical moves:

Step (3) is where a gap in previous research is indicated, thus creating the need for more information. The writer constructs a need, and an opening. Because &quot;kairos&quot; emphasizes change, it is an important aspect of science. Not all scientific research can be presented at the same time or in the same way, but creating an opening makes it possible to construct the right time.

This can easily be related back to Hippocrates&#x27; statement that not every opening is an opportunity. Yet, in science, the message can be adapted in such a way that chronos becomes &quot;kairos&quot;.

The idea can also be expressed as Carolyn Glasshoff (2011) wrote, that specifically in the field of scientific writing,


== In digital media ==

Some scholars studying &quot;kairos&quot; in the modern digital sphere argue that the aspects of body/identity, distribution/circulation, access/accessibility, interaction, and economics are handled differently in an online setting and therefore messages that are sent digitally need to be altered to fit the new circumstances. In order to reach online audiences effectively, scholars suggest that context of the information&#x27;s use, which includes considerations of legal, health-related, disciplinary, and political factors paired with smart rhetorical thinking can solve the issue of miscommunicated messages distributed on online forums.

<doc id="311980" wikidata="Q6375268" url="?curid=311980" title="Sakai River (Tokyo, Kanagawa)">
<text>The is a Class B river in Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefecture which flows into the Bay of Sagami of the Pacific Ocean.

==The Sakai River==
The Sakai River has with the length of 52.1 km and the basin size of 210.7 square km. It starts from Aihara-machi (Japanese: 相原町), Machida, Tokyo, to Katase, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, near Enoshima Island. It is called &quot;Sakai&quot;, meaning &quot;border&quot;, because it flows on the border of the former provinces of Musashi and Sagami.

As the Sakai River and its tributaries are prone to flooding (especially in spring and during the typhoon season), as a protection they were encased in concrete during the postwar period. The rivers continue to flood, but do not overflow their banks as frequently as in the past.

==Aliases==

The river often used to be called the Takakura River () because it flowed through Kōza District, Kanagawa (Japanese: 高座郡), the Kun&#x27;yomi reading of the two &quot;Kōza&quot; Kanji characters being Takakura. Also, the short section of the river from the point where it is joined by the Kashio River to the mouth of the river is sometimes called the Katase River.

==Recreation==
There are walking and bicycle routes along the banks of the Sakai River, from Machida, Tokyo, to the river mouth in Fujisawa, Kanagawa.

Mooring of pleasure boats in the river is now prohibited.

==Katase River==
The is a segment of the Sakai River in Shōnan, central Japan, about 50 kilometers southwest of Tokyo. The Katase is an approximately 3-kilometer-long segment of the Sakai River from (川名), Fujisawa, where the Sakai River and Kashio River join, to a point at Enoshima Island, where the river flows into Sagami Bay. The river&#x27;s name comes from Fujisawa City&#x27;s Katase area through which it flows, at the foot of Kataseyama (片瀬山), and goes under the Katase Bridge of Route 134, before it meets Sagami Bay beside Katase Fisheries Port.

<doc id="311982" wikidata="Q5284165" url="?curid=311982" title="Divine illumination">
<text>According to divine illumination, the process of human thought needs to be aided by divine grace. It is the oldest and most influential alternative to naturalism in the theory of mind and epistemology. It was an important feature of ancient Greek philosophy, Neoplatonism, medieval philosophy, and the Illuminationist school of Islamic philosophy.

==Catholic Church==

Plato quotes Socrates in &quot;The Apology&quot; as saying that he had a divine or spiritual sign that began when he was a child. It was a voice that turned him away from something he was about to do, although it never encouraged him to do anything. Apuleius later suggested the voice was of a friendly demon and that Socrates deserved this help as he was the most perfect of human beings.

The early Christian philosopher Augustine (354–430) also emphasised the role of divine illumination in our thought, saying that &quot;The mind needs to be enlightened by light from outside itself, so that it can participate in truth, because it is not itself the nature of truth. You will light my lamp, Lord,&quot; and &quot;You hear nothing true from me which you have not first told me.&quot; According to Augustine, God does not give us certain information, but rather gives us insight into the truth of the information we received for ourselves.

:If we both see that what you say is true, and we both see that what I say is true, then where do we see that? Not I in you, nor you in me, but both of us in that unalterable truth that is above our minds.
Augustine&#x27;s theory was defended by Christian philosophers of the later Middle Ages, particularly Franciscans such as Bonaventure and Matthew of Aquasparta. According to Bonaventure:

:Things have existence in the mind, in their own nature (&quot;proprio genere&quot;), and in the eternal art. So the truth of things as they are in the mind or in their own nature – given that both are changeable – is sufficient for the soul to have certain knowledge only if the soul somehow reaches things as they are in the eternal art.

The doctrine was criticised by John Pecham and Roger Marston. Thomas Aquinas is often seen as a harsh critiс of this doctrine; but his position is more nuanced. As Robert Pasnau observes, &quot;Thomas Aquinas is often thought of as the figure most responsible for putting an end to the theory of divine illumination. Although there is some truth to this view, as we will see, it seems more accurate to regard Aquinas as one of the last defenders of the theory, as a proponent of innate Aristotelian illumination.&quot; Undoubtedly, Aquinas denied that in this life we have divine ideas as an object of thought, and that divine illumination is sufficient on its own, without the senses, for natural knowledge. He also denied that there is a special continuing divine influence on human thought. People have sufficient capacity for thought on their own, without needing &quot;new illumination added onto their natural illumination.&quot; But this natural illumination, which Aquinas distinguishes from the supernatural illumination required for knowledge of intelligible things above human strengths (it is the case of faith and of prophecy), is, nevertheless, divine illumination, according to Aquinas; indeed, he writes that &quot;The material sun sheds its light outside us; but the intelligible Sun, Who is God, shines within us. Hence the natural light bestowed upon the soul is God&#x27;s enlightenment, whereby we are enlightened to see what pertains to natural knowledge; and for this there is required no further knowledge, but only for such things as surpass natural knowledge.&quot; Aquinas asserted also that &quot;the intellectual light that is in us is nothing other than a certain likeness of the uncreated light, obtained through participation, in which the eternal reasons are contained.&quot; For this reason, he concluded that, in this life, we know things in the divine ideas as in the principle of knowledge. He also claimed that his position was the right interpretation of Augustine&#x27;s doctrine on divine illumination; some scholars, as Lydia Schumacher, maintain that his claim is right. 

On the other hand, Henry of Ghent defended a different version of the theory, which, according to Henry himself and to various scholars, would be closer to the Augustinian one. Henry argued against Aquinas that Aristotle&#x27;s theory of abstraction is not enough to explain how we can acquire infallible knowledge of the truth, and must be supplemented by divine illumination. A thing has two exemplars against which it can be compared. The first is a created exemplar which exists in the soul through abstraction. The second is an exemplar which exists outside the soul, and which is uncreated and eternal. But no comparison to a created exemplar can give us infallible truth. Since the dignity of man requires that we can acquire such truth, it follows that we have access to the exemplar in the divine mind.

Henry&#x27;s defence of divine illumination was strongly criticised by the Franciscan theologian Duns Scotus, who argued that Henry&#x27;s version of the theory led to scepticism and presented his own version, according to which there are &quot;four senses in which the human intellect sees infallible truths in the divine light. In each sense, the divine light acts not on us but on the objects of our understanding.&quot;

<text>The Thames Tunnel is a tunnel beneath the River Thames in London, connecting Rotherhithe and Wapping. It measures wide by high and is long, running at a depth of below the river surface measured at high tide. It is the first tunnel known to have been constructed successfully underneath a navigable river. It was built between 1825 and 1843 by Marc Brunel, and his son, Isambard, using the tunnelling shield newly invented by the elder Brunel and Thomas Cochrane.

The tunnel was originally designed for horse-drawn carriages, but was mainly used by pedestrians and became a tourist attraction. In 1869 it was converted into a railway tunnel for use by the East London line which, since 2010, is part of the London Overground railway network under the ownership of Transport for London.

==History and development==

===Construction===

At the start of the 19th century, there was a pressing need for a new land connection between the north and south banks of the Thames to link the expanding docks on each side of the river. The engineer Ralph Dodd tried, but failed, to build a tunnel between Gravesend and Tilbury in 1799.

Between 1805 and 1809, a group of Cornish miners, including Richard Trevithick, tried to dig a tunnel further upriver between Rotherhithe and Wapping/Limehouse, but failed because of the difficult conditions of the ground. The Cornish miners were used to hard rock and did not modify their methods for soft clay and quicksand. This Thames Archway project was abandoned after the initial pilot tunnel (a &#x27;driftway&#x27;) flooded twice when of a total of had been dug. It only measured by , and was intended as a drain for a larger tunnel for passenger use. The failure of the Thames Archway project led engineers to conclude that &quot;an underground tunnel is impracticable&quot;.

The Anglo-French engineer Marc Brunel refused to accept this conclusion. In 1814 he proposed to Emperor Alexander I of Russia a plan to build a tunnel under the river Neva in St Petersburg. This scheme was turned down (a bridge was built instead) and Brunel continued to develop ideas for new methods of tunnelling.

Brunel patented the tunnelling shield, a revolutionary advance in tunnelling technology, in January 1818. In 1823 Brunel produced a plan for a tunnel between Rotherhithe and Wapping, which would be dug using his new shield. Financing was soon found from private investors, including the Duke of Wellington, and a Thames Tunnel Company was formed by the (5 Geo. 4. c. clvi), the project beginning in February 1825.

The first step was the construction of a large shaft on the south bank at Rotherhithe, back from the river bank. It was dug by assembling an iron ring in diameter above ground. A brick wall high and thick was built on top of this, with a powerful steam engine surmounting it to drive the excavation&#x27;s pumps. The whole apparatus was estimated to weigh . The soil below the ring&#x27;s sharp lower edge was removed manually by Brunel&#x27;s workers. The whole shaft thus gradually sank under its own weight, slicing through the soft ground like a pastry cutter.

The shaft became stuck at one point during its sinking, as the pressure of the earth around it held it firmly in position. Extra weight was required to make it continue its descent. 50,000 bricks were added as temporary weights. It was realised that the problem was caused because the shaft&#x27;s sides were parallel. Years later when the Wapping shaft was built, it was slightly wider at the bottom than the top. This non-cylindrical tapering design ensured it did not get stuck. By November 1825 the Rotherhithe shaft was in place and tunnelling work could begin.


The tunnelling shield, built at Henry Maudslay&#x27;s Lambeth works and assembled in the Rotherhithe shaft, was the key to Brunel&#x27;s construction of the Thames Tunnel. The &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; described how it worked:
Each of the twelve frames of the shield weighed over . The key innovation of the tunnelling shield was its support for the unlined ground in front and around it to reduce the risk of collapses. However, many workers, including Brunel himself, soon fell ill from the poor conditions caused by filthy sewage-laden water seeping through from the river above. This sewage gave off methane gas which was ignited by the miners&#x27; oil lamps. When the resident engineer, John Armstrong, fell ill in April 1826, Marc&#x27;s son Isambard Kingdom Brunel took over at the age of 20.

Work was slow, progressing at only a week. To earn income from the tunnel, the company directors allowed sightseers to view the shield in operation. They charged a shilling for the adventure and an estimated 600–800 visitors took advantage of the opportunity every day.

The excavation was hazardous. The tunnel flooded suddenly on 18 May 1827 after had been dug. Isambard Kingdom Brunel lowered a diving bell from a boat to repair the hole at the bottom of the river, throwing bags filled with clay into the breach in the tunnel&#x27;s roof. Following the repairs and the drainage of the tunnel, he held a banquet inside it.

====Closure====
Six men died when the tunnel flooded again the following year, on 12 January 1828, just four days after a visit by Don Miguel, soon to become Regent of Portugal. Isambard himself was extremely lucky to survive the flooding. The six men had made their way to the main stairwell, as the emergency exit was known to be locked. Isambard instead made for the locked exit. A contractor named Beamish heard him there and broke the door down, and an unconscious Isambard was pulled out and revived. He was sent to Brislington, near Bristol, to recuperate. There he heard about the competition to build what became the Clifton Suspension Bridge.

====Completion====

In December 1834 Marc Brunel succeeded in raising enough money, including a loan of £247,000 from the Treasury, to continue construction.

Starting in August 1835 the old rusted shield was dismantled and removed. By March 1836 the new shield, improved and heavier, was assembled in place and boring resumed.

In 1835, the Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi parodied the construction of the Thames Tunnel in lines 126–129 of the poem .

Impeded by further floods (23 August and 3 November 1837, 20 March 1838, 3 April 1840) fires and leaks of methane and hydrogen sulphide gas, the remainder of the tunnelling was completed in November 1841, after another five and a half years. The extensive delays and repeated flooding made the tunnel the butt of metropolitan humour:
The Thames Tunnel was fitted out with lighting, roadways and spiral staircases during 1841–1842. An engine house on the Rotherhithe side, which now houses the Brunel Museum, was also constructed to house machinery for draining the tunnel. The tunnel was finally opened to the public on 25 March 1843.

===Pedestrian usage===

Although it was a triumph of civil engineering, the Thames Tunnel was not a financial success. It had cost £454,000 to dig and another £180,000 to fit out – far exceeding its initial cost estimates. Proposals to extend the entrance to accommodate wheeled vehicles failed owing to cost, and it was used only by pedestrians. It became a major tourist attraction, attracting about two million people a year, each paying a penny to pass through, and became the subject of popular songs. The American traveller William Allen Drew commented that &quot;No one goes to London without visiting the Tunnel&quot; and described it as the &quot;eighth wonder of the world&quot;. When he saw it for himself in 1851, he pronounced himself &quot;somewhat disappointed in it&quot; but still left a vivid description of its interior, which was more like an underground marketplace than a transport artery:
Other opinions of the tunnel were more negative; some regarded it as the haunt of prostitutes and &quot;tunnel thieves&quot; who lurked under its arches and mugged passers-by. The American writer Nathaniel Hawthorne visited it a few years after Drew, and wrote in 1855 that the tunnel:
===Conversion into a railway tunnel===


The tunnel was purchased in September 1865 at a cost of £800,000 (equivalent to £ million in ) by the East London Railway Company, a consortium of six mainline railways which sought to use the tunnel to provide a rail link for goods and passengers between Wapping (and later Liverpool Street) and the South London line. The tunnel&#x27;s generous headroom, resulting from the architects&#x27; original intention of accommodating horse-drawn carriages, also provided a sufficient loading gauge for trains.

The line&#x27;s engineer was Sir John Hawkshaw who was also noted, with W. H. Barlow, for the major re-design and completion of Isambard Brunel&#x27;s long-abandoned Clifton Suspension Bridge at Bristol, which was completed in 1864.

The first train ran through the tunnel on 7 December 1869. In 1884, the tunnel&#x27;s disused construction shaft to the north of the river was repurposed to serve as Wapping station.

The East London Railway was later absorbed into the London Underground, where it became the East London line. It continued to be used for goods services as late as 1962. During the Underground days, the Thames Tunnel was the oldest underground piece of the Tube&#x27;s infrastructure.

It was planned to construct a junction between the East London Line and the Jubilee Line extension at Canada Water station. As construction would require the temporary closure of the East London Line, it was decided to take this opportunity to perform long-term maintenance on the tunnel and so in 1995 the East London Line was closed to allow construction and maintenance to take place. The proposed repair method for the tunnel was to seal it against leaks by &quot;shotcreting&quot; it with concrete, obliterating its original appearance, causing a controversy that led to a bitter conflict between London Underground, who wished to complete the work as quickly and cheaply as possible, and architectural interests wishing to preserve the tunnel&#x27;s appearance. The architectural interests won, with the Grade II* listing of the tunnel on 24 March 1995, the day London Underground had scheduled the start of the long-term maintenance work.

Following an agreement to leave a short section at one end of the tunnel untreated, and more sympathetic treatment of the rest of the tunnel, the work went ahead and the route reopened – much later than originally anticipated – in 1998. The tunnel closed again from 23 December 2007 to permit tracklaying and resignalling for the East London Line extension. The extension work resulted in the tunnel becoming part of the new London Overground. After its reopening on 27 April 2010, it was used by mainline trains again.

===Influence===

The construction of the Thames Tunnel showed that it was indeed possible to build underwater tunnels, despite the previous scepticism of many engineers. Several new underwater tunnels were built in the UK in the following decades: the Tower Subway in London; the Severn Tunnel under the River Severn; and the Mersey Railway Tunnel under the River Mersey. Brunel&#x27;s tunnelling shield was later refined, with James Henry Greathead playing a particularly important role in developing the technology.

In 1991, the Thames Tunnel was designated as an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Civil Engineers.

In 1995 the tunnel was listed at Grade II* in recognition of its architectural importance.

==Visiting==

Nearby in Rotherhithe, Brunel&#x27;s engine house (built to house drainage pumps) is open to visitors as the Brunel Museum.

In the 1860s, when trains started running through the tunnel, the entrance shaft at Rotherhithe was used for ventilation. The staircase was removed to reduce the risk of fire. In 2011, a concrete raft was built near the bottom of the shaft, above the tracks, when the tunnel was upgraded for the London Overground network. This space, with walls blackened with smoke from steam trains, forms part of the museum and functions at times as a concert venue and occasional bar. A rooftop garden has been built on top of the shaft. In 2016 the entrance hall opened as an exhibition space, with a staircase providing access to the shaft for the first time in over 150 years.

<doc id="311996" wikidata="Q680729" url="?curid=311996" title="Pornography in Japan">
<text>In Japan, pornography has unique characteristics that readily distinguish it from western pornography. Pornographic films are known as &quot;&quot; (AV) in Japan, so Japanese adult videos (JAV) refers to the Japanese Adult Video industry. Animated films are referred to as &quot;hentai&quot; in English, but in Japan the terms &quot; and &quot; (or &quot;ero anime&quot;) are used. In addition to pornographic videos and magazines featuring live actors, there are now categories of pornographic manga and anime (i.e., &quot;hentai&quot;), and pornographic computer games (&quot;eroge&quot;; for both PC and game consoles).

Reflecting Japan&#x27;s views on sexuality and culture, Japanese pornography delves into a wide spectrum of heterosexual, homosexual, and transgender sexual acts in addition to unique fetishes and paraphilias. Starting with erotic stories and wood block prints from before the 20th century, Japanese pornography evolved into distinct subcategories. Partly under attempts to circumvent Japanese laws regarding censorship, but also to cater to particular fetishes, actors and producers often feature subject matter that in western pornography had historically been unseen or rarely depicted, and even now is less frequently featured; bukkake (group ejaculation), gokkun (consuming semen), omorashi (needing to urinate), and tentacle erotica are a few uniquely Japanese genres of erotica. Lolicon (young girls), shotacon (young boys), and their contribution to the controversy regarding the regulation of cartoon pornography depicting minors has been a major issue concerning child protection, free speech, and public morality both inside and outside Japan.

The Japanese Penal Code from the early 20th century has provisions against &quot;indecent material&quot;, so any lawfully produced pornography must censor the genitals of actors and actresses; this type of censorship also extends to the graphics of hentai manga, video games, and anime. Up until the mid-1990s, any depiction of pubic hair was also censored. Anuses are only censored at contact or penetration. Breasts and nipples are not censored. Pixelization is commonly used to follow the censorship guidelines without being too obvious.

==History==
===Before the 20th century===
Shunga or pornographic wood-block pictures were printed with all imaginable situations. The actual uses of shunga in the period are still debated, but probably resembled modern uses of pornographic materials, including masturbation and shared viewing with a lover. Several notable woodblock artists to produce this and their creations were Hokusai&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of the Fisherman&#x27;s Wife, Lesbian&quot; and &quot;Two Lovers&quot; as well as Kitagawa Utamaro&#x27;s &quot;Client Lubricating a Prostitute.&quot; One of the most well-known collection of Shunga can be seen in Kunisada&#x27;s 1850 work &quot;A Bedside Guide to the Colours of Love in Spring.&quot;

After the Meiji Restoration in the second half of the 19th century, the publication of pornographic materials declined under government pressure.

===In the 20th century===
In the late Taishō period and early Shōwa period, an artistic movement called &quot;Eroguronansensu&quot;, literally &quot;erotic-grotesque-nonsense&quot;, occurred influenced by decadent works of Europe. Open sexual expressions were permitted in novels and &quot;manga&quot; but a strict control was applied on photographs and films. After World War II, the law against &#x27;obscenity&#x27;, Article 175, was the only official censorship law that remained in force. During the Allied occupation of Japan, which lasted until 1952, all forms of sexually explicit material were prohibited in the country. American forces occupying Japan imposed Western ideas of morality and law. The Japanese public slowly came to adopt some of these ideas and practices. Negative views foreign to Japanese culture about pornography were accepted and applied to visual depictions as they were the ones most likely recognized and thereby criticized by Westerners. As a result, once the occupation forces left, the Japanese government kept the ban on sexually explicit material in place until the late 1980s; images or depictions of frontal nudity were banned, as well as pictures of pubic hair or genitals. No sex act could be depicted graphically. Sex work was outlawed in Japan in 1958.

Influenced by magazines such as &quot;Playboy&quot;, pornographic magazines were printed soon after World War II. &quot;Playboy&quot;″s articles being about American lifestyle, women being mostly non-Asian, interviews being with people largely unknown in Japan, and fashion and sport being American spawned a fashion for a genre known as &quot;yōmono&quot; (literally &quot;Western things&quot;).

In the early 1960s, several movie studios began producing &quot;pink films&quot;. With censorship laws prohibiting genitals from being seen but otherwise free to express anything, these movies quickly diversified to cover all genres, including rape and bondage. Throughout the 1960s, the &quot;pink films&quot; were mainly produced by low-budget, independent filmmakers such as Kōji Wakamatsu. In 1971, the major studio Nikkatsu entered the pink film genre.

Starting in 1971, homosexually-oriented magazines began to appear, including &quot;Barazoku&quot;. Homosexual magazines tend to feature particular body types, such as &quot;Badi&quot; (younger adult males), &quot;Samson&quot;, (chubby men) and &quot;G-men&quot;, (muscular men).

The 1976 Japanese love film &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot; by Nagisa Ōshima was banned from Japan due to its nudity and erotic content. Despite quickly becoming a sensation at film festivals in New York and Cannes, in October 1976 the film was seized by Japanese authorities. While the film was based on a true story well known in Japan, its content, involving the vivid depiction of asphixiophilia, was considered too obscene for public viewing. The producer and script writer for the film were taken to court and charged with obscenity but were found not guilty. Frontal nudity was not permitted to appear on film in Japan until 1986.

====1980s====
The proliferation of pornographic videos in the 1980s commonly called A/V (short for adult video) arose as most Japanese families now had at least two television sets and VCRs. It is rumored, but not substantiated, that the VHS format vanquished Betamax because large numbers of A/V were released in VHS format. Few A/Vs were sold in laserdisc format. Playing games on personal computers with no limitation on content except for censorship laws was sometimes viewed as being synonymous with playing bishōjo games, because so few Japanese people saw any reason to play video games on these platforms, as opposed to video game consoles.

In the late 1980s, the dōjinshi market expanded. It is estimated that about half of this market consists of pornography. Copyright problems plague the market, yet the dōjinshi market was a common place for creators to start before making a debut in a professional magazine. Yaoi began in the dōjinshi market.

====1990s====
According to John Carr, a United Kingdom government adviser on Internet safety policy for children, two-thirds of all pedophilic images on the Internet in the late 1990s may have originated in Japan. Since the law against child pornography in 1999, the proportion is now believed to be less than 2%. ECPAT believes that many child pornography producers have simply turned to producing anime or films featuring adults dressed as children.

===21st century===
During the COVID-19 lockdowns, global viewership for Japanese pornography rose significantly as more people were forced to stay home. The sale of videos, sex toys, and even subtitles rose significantly in sales during this period. At the same time, the use of VR goggles has shot up during this period, mainly due to the increase in available content and faster internet speeds.

With the Japanese pornography industry growing, increasing numbers of women in the country have become victims of sexual exploitation. Many were tricked into believing they were signing up for &quot;modelling contracts&quot;, only to be coerced into becoming pornographic actresses. These continued occurrences have led to calls for greater regulation.

In September 2022, one of the largest Japanese adult video distribution websites, R18.com, announced that they would be closing down permanently on 31 January 2023 due to billing issues. The company&#x27;s Japanese website, DMM.com, will still remain operational, although international payments have been restricted.

In June 2022, the Japanese government passed a bill that aims to protect the rights of actors and actresses coerced into the pornography industry. The new set of laws gives people who have agreed to appear in pornographic films the right to terminate their contract at any time prior to and up to one year after the public release of their films without condition. The bill also states that a one-month period must pass between contract-signing and filming, and a four-month period must pass between filming and public release of the film, in order to give actors and actresses time to reconsider their decision. Additionally, the bill highlights a greater need for transparency around the types of sexual acts involved in a film by requiring producers to provide a written explanation of the nature of the content and details of sexual acts involved. Misrepresentation or intimidation to prevent withdrawal of contracts is liable to up to 3 years of imprisonment or 3 million yen for individuals, or 100 million yen for corporations.

==Considerations==
===Censorship laws===

Under Article 175 of the Criminal Code of Japan people who sell or distribute obscene materials can be punished by fines or imprisonment. Article 175 was included in the original document in 1907 and remains relatively unchanged. Showing pubic hair and adult genitalia was once considered obscene.

&quot;&quot; (literally &#x27;front patch&#x27;) is a Japanese slang term used in the pornography industry to mean &quot;hiding the pubic hair&quot;. Initially this was done by sticking adhesive tape over the crotch, and the term &quot;maebari&quot; was used for this tape. This technique allowed the film makers to conform with Japanese censorship requirements and avoid the risk of expensive re-shooting. In Japanese pink films these &quot;maebari&quot; evolved into self-adhesive bandage-like coverings that were discarded after use. They were often skin-coloured and triangular. Once the removal of pubic hair by shaving became popular, &quot;maebari&quot; fell out of use.

Video pornography routinely depicts explicit sex scenes with the participants&#x27; genitalia obscured by pixelization. The amount of censorship of the penis can vary. The publication of &quot;Waterfruit&quot; and &quot;Santa Fe&quot; by Kishin Shinoyama was likely the first publication that featured pubic hair. Many video production companies belong to ethical associations which provide guidance on what is acceptable and what is not. The Nihon Ethics of Video Association, the Ethics Organization of Computer Software and the are three examples of such organizations.

===Religion and pornography===

Japan&#x27;s indigenous religion, Shinto (&quot;Kami-no-Michi&quot;), is based in animism, with a belief that supernatural beings dwell in nature. The gods and goddesses of Shinto are not repositories of morality or perfection; instead, they exist within nature and thus, sexuality is an innate part of life itself. Therefore, religious attitudes are no obstacle to the presence of pornographic material in Japan&#x27;s society.

===Child pornography===

Possession of child pornography depicting real children has been illegal in Japan since June 2014. Distribution of child pornography was made &quot;de jure&quot; illegal in 1999 after international pressure from the United Nations, UNICEF and other international organizations, although the law made a distinction between hardcore pornography and softcore pornography, which is widely available in Japan, such as at junior idol and lolicon media centers like Akihabara and Nipponbashi, and at most konbini, or Japanese convenience stores. Prosecutions have been made under the new law by prosecutors under Japan&#x27;s unique legal system, resulting in some financial verdicts, with relative strictness of enforcement continuing to vary by prefecture.

In June 2008, a bill that proposed the imposition of a ban on child-pornography possession was submitted to the House of Representatives of Japan where it was brought before the Diet in September, but failed to pass. On 15 July 2014 penalties were added to the simple possession of child pornography as a result of the revision of the law.

=== Sexual assault ===
In 1999, Milton Diamond and Ayako Uchiyama postulated that the rise of pornographic material in Japan from the 1970s onwards creates a decrease in reported violence.

In 2016, the campaign group &quot;&quot; reported allegations that some women appearing in pornographic films had been forced to do so against their will. The group called for the introduction of legislation to regulate production companies and for help for any performers who had experienced abuse.

===Coercion===

In 2016, Japanese pornographic actress Saki Kozai told AFP, Tokyo that she was tricked into appearing in pornography. She had signed a deal with an agency believing she would be modelling. At the time of the first shoot, she was asked to take off her clothes and have sex in front of the camera. She was surrounded by 20 men and could not say &quot;no&quot; and had to perform the act in front of camera unwillingly. The agency also convinced her to cut herself off from her family to focus on work. Another woman from the pornography industry said that she was tricked into working in pornography by an agency on the pretense of becoming a singer.

In Tokyo, three people were arrested for allegedly forcing a woman to appear in more than 100 pornographic films. Pornography agencies use intimidating tactics when women try to refuse to perform sex acts, such as demanding huge fines, citing vaguely worded contracts, and telling them they will not find a job outside of the pornography industry. Many such women have committed suicide under the high pressure and coercion they face.

=== Depiction of illegal activity ===
Many Japanese-made pornographic films (JAV), have titles that suggest that they use minors, or that they show the recording of another actual crime. However, any and all titles that are circulated with the approval of Eirin, the Japanese film industry&#x27;s regulatory body, are in full compliance with and do not break any Japanese laws.

A common ploy is to have a part of a title replaced with a character, or to use a phonetically similar neologism.

== Types ==

===Dōjin and parodies===

&quot;Dōjinshi&quot; (often transliterated as doujinshi), or self-published works that are often manga, are frequently (but not always) pornographic, either as original works or as imitations of popular anime, games and manga.

===Anime===

Animated erotica (known in the West as &quot;hentai&quot; but in Japan as &quot;adult anime&quot;, &quot;ero anime&quot; or &quot;erotic animation&quot;) is a popular genre in Japan and generally maintains the same style of animation seen in other popular forms of Japanese animation (anime).

Used in everyday conversational Japanese, the default meaning of the term &quot;hentai&quot; is &quot;weird&quot; implying &quot;perverted&quot;, i.e., implying that &quot;any&quot; amount of lewdness is considered &quot;perverted&quot;, rather than making a distinction between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;perverted&quot; erotica.

(Used as a technical term, the word &quot;hentai&quot; can also mean &quot;metamorphosis&quot;/&quot;transformation&quot;, although this denotation does not inform the meaning of the word as it would be commonly used in conversation.)

===Games===

Adult-oriented games are a genre for video games in Japan. Because of the language barrier and cultural differences, the genre is less popular outside Japan. Known as &quot;bishōjo games&quot; or &quot;pretty girl games&quot; (alternately spelled &quot;bishoujo&quot;), or as &quot;eroge&quot; in Japanese, the games are known under several names used by English fans, including PC dating-sim game, hentai game/H game, and so on. Companies such as JAST USA and MangaGamer are translating dating sims and visual novels into English for the fledgling market outside Japan. For adult video games in Japan, the rating of &quot;18+&quot; was coined by the Ethics Organization of Computer Software or . Rating of adult video games has not gone in Computer Entertainment Rating Organization.

===The Internet===
Fanfiction, commonly found in websites, is not limited to fictitious characters and often uses real live people as well, though these works would make little sense to those who do not see Japanese TV programs. Dōjinshi writers typically use the Internet to market their products by offering previews of new works, a secret address where buyers can find additional works, and a sample of their games. They also recruit new writers and artists online. Several exclusively adult oriented search engines exist to let someone find a site they are looking for, without having to search through commercial websites that list all keywords. Many works of dōjinshi are featured in websites that collect the art and let people look for free.

Many websites feature seasonal greeting pictures, often pornographic, from linked sites and friends who frequent their sites. A typical Christmas greeting picture on such sites features a Santa-girl in various stages of undressing. The twelve zodiac animals of Chinese astrology allow for variations on catgirls.

===Magazines===
Magazines are, along with videos, popular media for pornographic materials. Magazines that contain pornographic manga or pictures are controlled, and feature age requirements for purchase. Many localities in Japan require pornographic magazines to be sealed when sold outside of adult bookstores, but it is not uncommon to find non-pornographic magazines that feature nudity. Many magazines, especially weekly tabloids, include nude images and photo spreads similar to Page Three girls featured in many western tabloids. So long as these images do not depict sexual organs or sex acts, they are not considered pornographic and, hence, are freely sold in public.

Confessional writings by both men and women are a popular topic in men&#x27;s and pornographic magazines.

===Movie adaptations===
In August 2019, Netflix released &quot;The Naked Director&quot; drama depicting the life of a Japanese adult video producer, Toru Muranishi and one of his first casts, Kaoru Kuroki. The drama received worldwide recognition, with a second season released in 2021. Today, Toru Muranishi is known as the &quot;Emperor of Porn&quot; and &quot;the dirtiest of the industry&#x27;s dirty old men&quot; for being one of the pioneers in the industry.

===Manga===

Manga with pornographic content targets both male and female audiences, and both male and female manga artists write pornographic works. Male-oriented pornographic manga is known as &quot;eromanga.&quot; In Western contexts, this is more commonly referred to as hentai manga.

===Video (JAV)===
Due to the large amount of videos produced, JAV films are typically assigned a code by the studio as a unique identifier. JAV codes usually consist of letters which identify the producer or type of content, followed by a sequential number.

===Virtual reality (VR)===
Virtual reality has risen in popularity in recent years, largely propelled by the pornography industry. Since the start of 2020, virtual reality use for Japanese adult videos has greatly increased, and this is largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and the industry maturing.

==Subgenres==
Among the various subgenres of Japanese pornography are the following:
* Lolicon (short for &quot;Lolita complex&quot;) : This genre involves young (or young-looking) girl characters in fiction (anime and manga).
* Shotacon (short for &quot;&quot;Shoutarou&quot; Complex&quot;): Similar to lolicon, this genre involves young (or young-looking) boy characters in fiction (anime and manga).
* Yaoi (&quot;Boy&#x27;s Love&quot;): Featuring two boys or men in a homosexual/gay relationship. Target audience is mainly (but not limited to) young adult women. It typically features a feminine &#x27;uke&#x27; or submissive/bottom, and a masculine &#x27;seme&#x27; or dominant/top, however this is not always the case as &#x27;uke&#x27; is often portrayed as masculine as well.
* Geikomi (sometimes &quot;Bara&quot;): Manga made by and for gay men that are often pornographic. Typically features adult men with varying degrees of muscle, body fat, and body hair, akin to beefcake or bears. Geikomi can focus on the more realistic obstacles and challenges that come with being gay in Japan.
* Yuri (&quot;Girl&#x27;s Love&quot;): Featuring two grown adult women in a homosexual/lesbian relationship. The target audience are mostly men or lesbians, but it is much less popular than Yaoi.
* Pornography for women: a new subgenre targeting women, portraying &quot;eromen&quot; (erotic men) who cater to women&#x27;s needs.

<text>The yellow-headed day gecko (&quot;Phelsuma klemmeri)&quot;, also commonly called the cheerful day gecko, Klemmer&#x27;s day gecko, and the neon day gecko, is a small diurnal species of gecko, a lizard in the family Gekkonidae. This endangered species is endemic to northwestern Madagascar and inhabits coastal forests (both dry and humid), dwelling on bamboo. The yellow-headed day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;klemmeri&quot;, is in honor of German herpetologist Konrad Klemmer.

==Description==
&quot;P. klemmeri&quot; is small, reaching a total length (including tail) of . The body colour of this slender and long-snouted gecko is turquoise blue at the upper and mid-back. The lower back is light brown. Most of the tail is turquoise blue. Remarkable is the laterally flattened body. Another typical characteristic is the yellow head. A dark black spot is present behind the eye, followed by a black stripe which extends to the rear extremities. The legs and toes are brown speckled. The ventral side is grayish white. The sexes can easily be distinguished by the orange color around the femoral pores of the males.

==Geographic range==
&quot;P. klemmeri&quot; inhabits northwest Madagascar, along the coast. It is only known from the Ampasindava Peninsula (at Antsatsaka) and near Mandrozo Lake.

==Habitat==
&quot;P. klemmeri&quot; typically lives in bamboo forest, at altitudes up to . It sometimes shares its habitat with &quot;P. seippi&quot; and &quot;P. madagascarienis grandis&quot;. &quot;P. klemmeri&quot; is most commonly found on yellow bamboo canes, but may be found on green bamboo or other nearby foliage. When threatened, &quot;P. klemmeri&quot; will hide inside narrow cracks in the bamboo.

==Diet==
&quot;P. klemmeri&quot; feeds on various insects and other invertebrates. It also likes to lick soft sweet fruit, pollen, and nectar.

==Behaviour==
&quot;P. klemmeri&quot; is primarily active during the cooler part of the day (diurnal) and likes to bask. It often lives in small groups.

==Reproduction==
&quot;P. klemmeri&quot; is oviparous. The female lays a pair of eggs and hides them in bamboo canes. At a temperature of 27 °C (80.6 °F), the young will hatch after approximately 39–52 days. Each juvenile measures .

==Captivity==
The species &quot;P. klemmeri&quot; is bred extensively in captivity, and the IUCN thinks it unlikely that it is still wild-caught.

When well cared-for, this species may live for up to 15 years.

<text>United States Satellite Broadcasting was a Saint Paul, Minnesota-based satellite television company that ran from 1981 to 1999. It was absorbed into DirecTV in 1999.

==History==
USSB was founded in 1981 by Hubbard Broadcasting President Stanley S. Hubbard, who is widely considered to be the father of modern satellite broadcasting. Hubbard spent most of the 1980s raising awareness and money to launch a digital satellite television service. In the 1990s, he had teamed up with Thomson Consumer Electronics and Hughes Electronics to come up with a practical digital satellite service capable of 175 channels. The original name of the service was HUBTV, named after Hubbard, but was soon changed to USSB. Other key early executives were his sons Stanley E. Hubbard, II and Robert Hubbard, as well as Paul Heinersheid, and Bernard Weiss.

When the service launched, USSB offered a comparatively small slate of channels, but included almost all of the major American premium channels and any channel in which Viacom had a stake at the time (which included the MTV Networks). Lacking any news channels, Hubbard instead used its in-house All News Channel, operated as a cooperative of Viacom and Hubbard-owned stations, as well as stations owned by other groups via the CONUS satellite network Hubbard operated. Hughes offered programming from most other cable television channels under the banner of DirecTV; viewers used the same satellite equipment, branded as the DSS (Digital Satellite System), to access both services (with USSB&#x27;s channel lineup starting in the 900s range). Though it wasn&#x27;t a requirement to subscribe to both services, many did, resulting in customers receiving two separate bills. On March 10, 1998, the Viacom channels (excluding the Showtime networks) moved to DirecTV while USSB added fXM and Showtime Extreme to its lineup.

Ultimately, the service was too small to succeed, with DirecTV outpacing it in channel capacity and marketing; an additional snag came when the DSS trademark was relinquished by DirecTV in a legal dispute. The Hubbards sold USSB to Hughes in December 1998, with only some employees transferring to DirecTV&#x27;s El Segundo, CA headquarters and Castle Rock, CO uplink center from USSB&#x27;s headquarters and uplink facility in St. Paul, MN; the channel lineup of USSB was integrated into DirecTV&#x27;s lineup by mid-1999.

<doc id="312007" wikidata="Q432726" url="?curid=312007" title="James F. Byrnes">
<text>James Francis Byrnes ( ; May 2, 1882 – April 9, 1972) was an American judge and politician from South Carolina. A member of the Democratic Party, he served in the U.S. Congress and on the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as in the executive branch, most prominently as the 49th U.S. Secretary of State under President Harry S. Truman. Byrnes was also the 104th governor of South Carolina.

Born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina, Byrnes pursued a legal career with the help of his cousin, Governor Miles Benjamin McSweeney. Byrnes won election to the U.S. House of Representatives and served from 1911 to 1925. He became a close ally of President Woodrow Wilson and a protégé of Senator Benjamin Tillman. He sought election to the U.S. Senate in 1924 but narrowly lost a runoff election to Coleman Livingston Blease, who had the backing of the Ku Klux Klan, a white-supremacist domestic-terrorist organization. Byrnes then moved his law practice to Spartanburg, South Carolina and prepared for a political comeback. He narrowly defeated Blease in the 1930 Democratic primary and joined the Senate in 1931.

Historian George E. Mowry called Byrnes &quot;the most influential Southern member of Congress between John Calhoun and Lyndon Johnson&quot;. In the Senate, Byrnes supported the policies of his longtime friend, President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Byrnes championed the New Deal and sought federal investment in South Carolina water projects. He also supported Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign policy, calling for a hard line against the Axis powers. He also opposed some of the labor laws proposed by Roosevelt, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, which established a minimum wage that hurt his state&#x27;s competitive advantage of very low factory wages. Roosevelt appointed Byrnes to the Supreme Court in 1941 but asked him to join the executive branch after America&#x27;s entry into World War II. During the war, Byrnes led the Office of Economic Stabilization and the Office of War Mobilization. He was a candidate to replace Henry A. Wallace as Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate in the 1944 election, but instead Harry S. Truman was nominated by the 1944 Democratic National Convention.

After Roosevelt&#x27;s death, Byrnes served as a close adviser to Truman and became U.S. Secretary of State in July 1945. In that capacity, Byrnes attended the Potsdam Conference and the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947; however, relations between Byrnes and Truman soured, and Byrnes resigned from the Cabinet in January 1947. He returned to elective politics in 1950 by winning election as the governor of South Carolina. As governor, he opposed the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; and sought to establish &quot;separate but equal&quot; as a realistic alternative to the desegregation of schools.

==Early life and career==
Byrnes was born at 538 King Street in Charleston, South Carolina, and was reared in Charleston. Byrnes&#x27;s father, James Francis Byrnes, died shortly after Byrnes was born. His father was Catholic of English, Irish, Welsh and Scottish ancestry. He was descended from Sir John Stawell, Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton and William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle, who all played significant roles in the English civil war as well as the Irish aristocrats Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare and Margaret Butler, Countess of Ormond. His mother, Elizabeth McSweeney Byrnes, was a dressmaker who was born in 1859. In the 1880s, a widowed aunt and her three children came to live with them; one of the children was Frank J. Hogan, later president of the American Bar Association. At 14, Byrnes left St. Patrick&#x27;s Catholic School to work in a law office, and became a court stenographer. Notably, he transcribed the 1903 trial of South Carolina Lieutenant Governor James H. Tillman (nephew of Senator and former governor &quot;Pitchfork Ben&quot; Tillman), for murdering a newspaper editor. In 1906, he married the former Maude Perkins Busch of Aiken, South Carolina; they had no children. He was the godparent of James Christopher Connor. At this time, Byrnes converted from the Catholic Church to Episcopalianism.

In 1900, Byrnes&#x27;s cousin, Governor Miles B. McSweeney, appointed him as a clerk for Judge Robert Aldrich of Aiken. As he needed to be 21 to take this position, Byrnes, his mother, and McSweeney changed his date of birth to that of his older sister, Leonora. He later apprenticed to a lawyer, then a common practice, read for the law, and was admitted to the bar in 1903. In 1908, he was appointed solicitor for the second circuit of South Carolina and served until 1910. Byrnes was a protégé of &quot;Pitchfork Ben&quot; Tillman and often had a moderating influence on the fiery segregationist Senator.

In 1910, he narrowly won the Democratic primary for US Representative from South Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, which was then tantamount to election. He was formally elected in the general election, and was re-elected six times, serving from 1911 to 1925.

The platform Byrnes stood on for Congress had several progressive points, such as better conditions for workers in textile mills. Byrnes proved a brilliant legislator, working behind the scenes to form coalitions, and avoiding the high-profile oratory that characterized much of Southern politics. He became a close ally of US President Woodrow Wilson, who often entrusted important political tasks to the capable young Representative, rather than to more experienced lawmakers. In the 1920s, he was a champion of the &quot;Good Roads Movement&quot;, which attracted motorists and politicians to large-scale road building programs.

==United States Senate and Supreme Court==
In 1924, Byrnes declined renomination to the House and instead sought nomination for the Senate seat held by incumbent Nathaniel B. Dial though both were former allies of the now-deceased &quot;Pitchfork Ben&quot; Tillman. Anti-Tillmanite and extreme racist demagogue Coleman Blease, who had challenged Dial in 1918, also ran again. Blease led the primary with 42 percent. Byrnes was second with 34 percent. Dial finished third with 22 percent.

Byrnes was opposed by the Ku Klux Klan, which preferred Blease. Byrnes had been raised as a Roman Catholic, and the Klan spread rumors that he was still a secret Catholic. Byrnes countered by citing his support by Episcopal clergy. Three days before the run-off vote, 20 Catholics who said that they had been altar boys with Byrnes published a professed endorsement of him. That group&#x27;s leader was a Blease ally, and the &quot;endorsement&quot; was circulated in anti-Catholic areas. Blease won the runoff 51% to 49%.

After his House term ended in 1925, Byrnes was out of office. He moved his law practice to Spartanburg, in the industrializing Piedmont region. Between his law practice and investment advice from friends such as Bernard Baruch, Byrnes became a wealthy man, but he never excluded himself from a return to politics. He cultivated the Piedmont textile workers, who were key Blease supporters. In 1930, he challenged Blease again. Blease again led the primary, with 46 percent to 38 percent for Byrnes, but this time, Byrnes won the runoff 51 to 49 percent.

During his time in the Senate, Byrnes was regarded as the most influential South Carolinian since John C. Calhoun. He had long been friends with Franklin Roosevelt, whom he supported for the Democratic nomination in 1932, and made himself Roosevelt&#x27;s spokesman on the Senate floor, where he guided much of the early New Deal legislation to passage.

He won an easy re-election in 1936, promising:

I admit I am a New Dealer, and if [the New Deal] takes money from the few who have controlled the country and gives it back to the average man, I am going to Washington to help the President work for the people of South Carolina and the country.

Byrnes also criticized those who spoke out against the interventionist policies of the Roosevelt Administration by making references to Thomas Jefferson and states’ rights, arguing that Jefferson was a progressive and liberal as well a “champion of the masses.” Adding to his point, Byrnes asserted that “if the sage of Monticello were alive today, he would frown upon any effort to use his views of states’ rights to block social and economic reforms so badly needed to improve conditions for those who labor in the factories and toil in the fields.”

Since the colonial era, South Carolina&#x27;s politicians had dreamed of an inland waterway system that would not only aid commerce but also control flooding. By the 1930s, Byrnes took up the cause for a massive dam-building project, Santee Cooper, that would not only accomplish those tasks but also electrify the entire state with hydroelectric power. With South Carolina financially strapped by the Great Depression, Byrnes managed to get the federal government to authorize a loan for the entire project, which was completed and put into operation in February 1942. The loan was later paid back to the federal government with full interest and at no cost to South Carolina taxpayers. Santee Cooper has continued to be a model for public-owned electrical utilities worldwide.

In 1937, Byrnes supported Roosevelt on the highly-controversial court packing plan, but he voted against the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, as a minimum wage would potentially make the textile mills in his state uncompetitive. He opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s efforts to purge conservative Democrats in the 1938 primary elections. On foreign policy, Byrnes was a champion of Roosevelt&#x27;s positions of helping the United Kingdom against Nazi Germany in 1939 to 1941 and of maintaining a hard diplomatic line against Japan. In this context he denounced isolationist Charles Lindbergh on several occasions.

Byrnes played a key role in blocking anti-lynching legislation, notably the Castigan-Wagner bill of 1935 and the Gavagan bill of 1937. Byrnes said that &quot;rape is responsible, directly and indirectly, for most of the lynching in America.&quot;

Byrnes despised his fellow South Carolina Senator &quot;Cotton Ed&quot; Smith, who strongly opposed the New Deal. He privately sought to help his friend Burnet R. Maybank, then the Mayor of Charleston, defeat Smith in the 1938 Senate primary. During the primary, however, Olin Johnston, who was limited to one term as governor, decided to run for the Senate. Because Johnston was also a pro-Roosevelt New Dealer, he would have divided the New Deal vote with Maybank and ensured a victory for Smith. Johnston was also supportive of the New Deal&#x27;s labor legislation, but Byrnes&#x27;s support was limited, and a series of labor strikes in the fall of 1937 made Byrnes withdraw consideration for potentially endorsing Johnston. Taking advice from Byrnes, Maybank decided to run for governor instead, and Byrnes made the reluctant decision to support Smith. Byrnes envisioned that Smith would retire in 1944 and that Maybank would successfully run for Smith&#x27;s Senate seat and build a strong political machine in the state with him.

On June 12, 1941, Roosevelt nominated Byrnes as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, and he was confirmed that same day. He served on the Court for only 15 months, from July 8, 1941, until October 3, 1942. His Supreme Court tenure is the shortest of any justice.

==World War II==

Byrnes left the Supreme Court to head Roosevelt&#x27;s Office of Economic Stabilization, which dealt with the vitally-important issues of prices and taxes. How powerful the new office would become depended entirely on Byrnes&#x27;s political skills, and Washington insiders soon reported that he was fully in charge. In May 1943, he became head of the Office of War Mobilization, a new agency that supervised the Office of Economic Stabilization. Under the leadership of Byrnes, the program managed newly constructed factories across the country that used raw materials, civilian and military production, and transportation for United States Armed Forces personnel and was credited with providing the employment that was needed to bring an official end to the Great Depression. Thanks to his political experience, his probing intellect, his close friendship with Roosevelt, and in no small part his own personal charm, Byrnes was soon exerting influence over many facets of the war effort that were not technically under his departmental jurisdiction. Many in Congress and the press began referring to Byrnes as the &quot;Assistant President.&quot;

Many expected that Byrnes would be the Democratic nominee in 1944 for vice president in Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s 1944 reelection campaign, replacing Henry A. Wallace, who was strongly felt by party officials to be too eccentric to replace an ailing president who would likely die before his next term ended. Roosevelt refused to endorse anybody other than Wallace. He had a personal preference for US Supreme Court justice William O. Douglas. Byrnes was on Roosevelt&#x27;s list but was hardly his first choice. In a July meeting at the White House, the party bosses pressed hard for Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri, and Roosevelt issued a statement saying he would support either Truman or Douglas. Byrnes was regarded as too conservative for organized labor; some big city bosses opposed him as an ex-Catholic who would offend Catholics; and blacks were wary of his opposition to racial integration. In short, Byrnes never had a serious chance at being nominated for vice president, and the nomination went instead to Truman. Roosevelt brought Byrnes to the Yalta Conference in early 1945 in which he seemed to favor Soviet plans. Written in shorthand, his notes comprise one of the most complete records of the &quot;Big Three&quot; Yalta meetings. At the same time, Byrnes did not participate in the foreign ministers&#x27; meetings or the direct meetings between Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin. After the Conference, he was influential in convincing the U.S. Congress and the general public to accept the terms of the agreement.

In 1945, Byrnes was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by President Truman for his work in the Office of War Mobilization.

=== Byrnes, World War II and the atomic bomb ===
As head of the wartime Office of War Mobilization, Byrnes provided oversight, material and financial resources for the high priority Manhattan Project.

Byrnes served on an Interim committee making a recommendations on the use of the atomic bomb during and after the war. The committee, headed by War Secretary Henry L. Stimson, included Byrnes, Vannevar Bush, James Conant, Karl T. Compton, Under Secretary of the Navy Ralph Austin Bard, and Assistant Secretary of State William L. Clayton. The scientific panel of the committee consisted of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Arthur Compton, Enrico Fermi and Ernest Lawrence. A business leaders branch of the committee included Walter S. Carpenter Jr. and James A. Rafferty. George C. Marshall was the US Military voice on the committee. Additional feedback was provided by the Committee on the Social and Political Implications of the Atomic Bomb, formed by Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, chaired by James Franck with Leo Szilard and Glenn T. Seaborg.

It was Byrnes who shared information with the new president on the atomic bomb project (until then, Truman had known nothing about the Manhattan Project).

In the 2023 film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;, directed by Christopher Nolan, Byrnes was portrayed by actor Pat Skipper.

==Secretary of State==
Upon his succession to the presidency after Roosevelt&#x27;s death, on April 12, 1945, Truman relied heavily on Byrnes&#x27;s counsel, Byrnes having been a mentor to Truman from the latter&#x27;s earliest days in the Senate. Indeed, Byrnes was one of the first people seen by Truman on the first day of his presidency. When Truman met Roosevelt&#x27;s coffin in Washington, he asked Byrnes and former Vice President Wallace, the two other men who might well have succeeded Roosevelt, to join him at the train station. Truman originally intended for both men to play leading roles in his administration to signal continuity with Roosevelt&#x27;s policies. Truman quickly fell out with Wallace but retained a good working relationship with Byrnes and increasingly turned to him for support.

Truman appointed Byrnes as US Secretary of State on July 3, 1945. Despite personally objecting to any guarantees of retaining Hirohito, Byrnes remained ambiguous on that point in a draft reply to Japan&#x27;s offer of surrender of August 10. As Secretary of State, he was first in line to the presidency (until adoption of the 1947 succession act) since there was no Vice President during Truman&#x27;s first term. He played a major role at the Potsdam Conference, the Paris Peace Conference, and other major postwar conferences. According to historian Robert Hugh Ferrell, Byrnes knew little more about foreign relations than Truman. He made decisions after consulting a few advisors, such as Donald S. Russell and Benjamin V. Cohen. Byrnes and his small group paid little attention to the State Department experts and similarly ignored Truman.

Because Byrnes had been part of the US delegation at Yalta, Truman assumed that he had accurate knowledge of what had transpired. It would be many months before Truman discovered that not to be the case. Nevertheless, Byrnes advised that the Soviets were breaking the Yalta Agreement and that Truman needed to be resolute and uncompromising with them.
Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin issued a joint statement announcing that they were combining the U.S. zone of Germany and the British zone of Germany into one new territory called &quot;West Germany.&quot; General Lucius D. Clay, who had been a top aide to Byrnes in 1944, heavily influenced Byrnes&#x27; famous September 1946 speech in Stuttgart, Germany. The speech, &quot;Restatement of Policy on Germany,&quot; marked the formal transition in American occupation policy away from the Morgenthau Plan of economic dismantlement to one of economic reconstruction.

Truman was rapidly moving toward a hardline position on Soviet intentions in Eastern Europe and Iran, but Byrnes was much more conciliatory. The distance between them grew and ties of personal friendship weakened. In late 1945, Byrnes argued with Soviet Foreign Minister Viacheslav Molotov over Soviet pressures on Bulgaria and Romania. Byrnes sent Mark Ethridge, a liberal journalist, to investigate; Ethridge found conditions were indeed bad. Ethridge wrote a damning report, but Byrnes ignored it and instead endorsed a Soviet offer. Truman read Ethridge&#x27;s report and decided that Byrnes&#x27;s softline approach was a failure and that the US needed to stand up to the Kremlin.

Personal relations between the two men grew strained, particularly when Truman felt that Byrnes was attempting to set foreign policy by himself and to inform the President only afterward. An early instance of the friction was the Moscow Conference in December 1945. Truman considered the &quot;successes&quot; of the conference to be &quot;unreal&quot; and was highly critical of Byrnes&#x27;s failure to protect Iran, which was not mentioned in the final communiqué. &quot;I had been left in the dark about the Moscow conference,&quot; Truman told Byrnes bluntly. In a subsequent letter to Byrnes, Truman took a harder line in reference to Iran: &quot;Without these supplies furnished by the United States, Russia would have been ignominiously defeated. Yet now Russia stirs up rebellion and keeps troops on the soil of her friend and ally— Iran. .. Unless Russia is faced with an iron fist and strong language another war is in the making. Only one language do they understand... I do not think we should play compromise any longer... I am tired of babying the Soviets&quot;. That led to the Iran crisis of 1946 in which Byrnes took an increasingly hardline position in opposition to Stalin, culminating in a speech in Germany on September 6, 1946. The &quot;Restatement of Policy on Germany,&quot; also known as the &quot;Speech of Hope&quot;, set the tone of future US policy by repudiating the Morgenthau Plan, an economic program that would permanently deindustrialize Germany. Byrnes was named &quot;TIME&quot; Man of the Year. Truman and others believed that Byrnes had grown resentful that he had not been Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate and successor and so was showing disrespect to Truman. Whether or not that was true, Byrnes felt compelled to resign from the Cabinet in 1947 with some feelings of bitterness.

==Governor of South Carolina==
Byrnes was not yet ready to give up public service. At 68, he was elected Governor of South Carolina in the 1950 gubernatorial election and served from 1951 to 1955. Supporting segregation in education, the Democratic governor stated in his inaugural address:

Byrnes was initially seen as a relative moderate on race issues. Recognizing that the South could not continue with its entrenched segregationist policies much longer but fearing that Congress would impose sweeping change upon the South, he opted for a course of change from within. To that end, he sought to fulfill at last the &quot;separate but equal&quot; policy that the South had put forward in Supreme Court civil rights cases, particularly in regard to public education. Byrnes poured state money into improving black schools, buying new textbooks and new buses, and hiring additional teachers. He also sought to curb the power of the Ku Klux Klan by passing a law that prohibited adults from wearing a mask in public on any day other than Halloween; he knew that many Klansmen feared exposure and would not appear in public in their robes unless their faces were hidden as well. Byrnes hoped to make South Carolina an example for other Southern states to follow in modifying their &quot;Jim Crow&quot; policies. Nonetheless, the NAACP sued South Carolina to force the state to desegregate its schools. Byrnes requested Kansas, a Midwestern state that also segregated its schools, to provide an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief in supporting the right of a state to segregate its schools. That gave the NAACP&#x27;s lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, the idea to shift the suit from South Carolina over to Kansas, which led directly to &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, a decision that Byrnes vigorously criticized.

The South Carolina Constitution then barred governors from immediate re-election and so Byrnes retired from active political life after the 1954 election.

==Later political career==
In his later years, Byrnes foresaw that the American South could play a more important role in national politics. To hasten that development, he sought to end the region&#x27;s nearly-automatic support of the Democratic Party, which Byrnes believed had grown too liberal and took the &quot;Solid South&quot; for granted at election time but otherwise ignored the region and its needs.

Byrnes endorsed Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, segregationist candidate Harry Byrd in 1956, Richard Nixon in 1960 and 1968, and Barry Goldwater in 1964. He gave his private blessing to US Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina to bolt the Democratic Party in 1964 and to declare himself a Republican, but Byrnes himself remained a Democrat.

In 1965, Byrnes spoke out against the &quot;punishment&quot; and the &quot;humiliation&quot; of South Carolina US Representative Albert Watson, who had been stripped of his congressional seniority by the House Democratic Caucus after endorsing Goldwater for president. Byrnes openly endorsed Watson&#x27;s retention in Congress as a Republican in a special election held in 1965 against Democrat Preston Callison. Watson secured $20,000 and the services of a Republican field representative in what he termed &quot;quite a contrast&quot; to his treatment from Democratic House colleagues.

Following Byrnes&#x27;s death at the age of 89, he was interred in the churchyard at Trinity Episcopal Church in Columbia, South Carolina.

==Legacy==
Byrnes is memorialized at several South Carolina universities and schools:

* The James F. Byrnes Building, housing the Byrnes International Center at the University of South Carolina.
* The James F. Byrnes Professorship of International Studies at USC, its first endowed professorship.
* Byrnes Auditorium at Winthrop University.
* Byrnes Hall, a dormitory at Clemson University, where Byrnes was a Life Trustee.
* James F. Byrnes High School in Duncan, South Carolina.

In 1948, Byrnes and his wife established the James F. Byrnes Foundation Scholarships, and since then, more than 1,000 young South Carolinians have been assisted in obtaining a college education. His papers are in Clemson University&#x27;s Special Collections Library.

Byrnes&#x27; portrait hangs in the South Carolina Senate chambers.

<doc id="312008" wikidata="Q1003236" url="?curid=312008" title="Fourier optics">
<text>Fourier optics is the study of classical optics using Fourier transforms (FTs), in which the waveform being considered is regarded as made up of a combination, or &quot;superposition&quot;, of plane waves. It has some parallels to the Huygens–Fresnel principle, in which the wavefront is regarded as being made up of a combination of spherical wavefronts (also called phasefronts) whose sum is the wavefront being studied. A key difference is that Fourier optics considers the plane waves to be natural modes of the propagation medium, as opposed to Huygens–Fresnel, where the spherical waves originate in the physical medium. 

A curved phasefront may be synthesized from an infinite number of these &quot;natural modes&quot; i.e., from plane wave phasefronts oriented in different directions in space. When an expanding spherical wave is far from its sources, it is locally tangent to a planar phase front (a single plane wave out of the infinite spectrum), which is transverse to the radial direction of propagation. In this case, a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is created, which emanates from a single spherical wave phase center. In the near field, no single well-defined spherical wave phase center exists, so the wavefront isn&#x27;t locally tangent to a spherical ball. In this case, a Fresnel diffraction pattern would be created, which emanates from an &quot;extended&quot; source, consisting of a distribution of (physically identifiable) spherical wave sources in space. In the near field, a full spectrum of plane waves is necessary to represent the Fresnel near-field wave, &quot;even locally&quot;. A &quot;wide&quot; wave moving forward (like an expanding ocean wave coming toward the shore) can be regarded as an infinite number of &quot;plane wave modes&quot;, all of which could (when they collide with something such as a rock in the way) scatter independently of one other. These mathematical simplifications and calculations are the realm of Fourier analysis and synthesis – together, they can describe what happens when light passes through various slits, lenses or mirrors that are curved one way or the other, or is fully or partially reflected.

Fourier optics forms much of the theory behind image processing techniques, as well as applications where information needs to be extracted from optical sources such as in quantum optics. To put it in a slightly complex way, similar to the concept of &quot;frequency&quot; and &quot;time&quot; used in traditional Fourier transform theory, Fourier optics makes use of the spatial frequency domain (&quot;kx&quot;, &quot;ky&quot;) as the conjugate of the spatial (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) domain. Terms and concepts such as transform theory, spectrum, bandwidth, window functions and sampling from one-dimensional signal processing are commonly used.

Fourier optics plays an important role for high-precision optical applications such as photolithography in which a pattern on a reticle to be imaged on wafers for semiconductor chip production is so dense such that light (e.g., DUV or EUV) emanated from the reticle is diffracted and each diffracted light may correspond to a different spatial frequency (&quot;kx&quot;, &quot;ky&quot;). Due to generally non-uniform patterns on reticles, a simple diffraction grating analysis may not provide the details of how light is diffracted from each reticle. 

== Propagation of light in homogeneous, source-free media ==

Light can be described as a waveform propagating through a free space (vacuum) or a material medium (such as air or glass). Mathematically, a real-valued component of a vector field describing a wave is represented by a scalar wave function &quot;u&quot; that depends on both space and time:
formula_1
where
formula_2
represents a position in a three dimensional space (in the Cartesian coordinate system here), and &quot;t&quot; represents time.

===The wave equation===

Fourier optics begins with the homogeneous, scalar wave equation (valid in source-free regions):
formula_3
where formula_4 is the speed of light and &quot;u&quot;(r,&quot;t&quot;) is a real-valued Cartesian component of an electromagnetic wave propagating through a free space (e.g., for where &quot;Ei&quot; is the &quot;i&quot;-axis component of an electric field E in the Cartesian coordinate system).

=== Sinusoidal steady state ===

If light of a fixed frequency in time/wavelength/color (as from a single-mode laser) is assumed, then, based on the engineering time convention, which assumes an formula_5 time dependence in wave solutions at the angular frequency formula_6 with formula_7 where formula_8 is a time period of the waves, the time-harmonic form of the optical field is given as
formula_9where formula_10 is the imaginary unit, formula_11 is the operator taking the real part of formula_12, 
formula_13 is the angular frequency (in radians per unit time) of light waves, and
formula_14 is, in general, a complex quantity, with separate amplitude formula_15 in non-negative real number and phase formula_16.

=== The Helmholtz equation ===

Substituting this expression into the scalar wave equation above yields the time-independent form of the wave equation,
formula_17
where 
formula_18
with the wavelength formula_19 in vacuum, is the wave number (also called propagation constant), formula_20 is the spatial part of a complex-valued Cartesian component of an electromagnetic wave. Note that the propagation constant formula_21 and the angular frequency formula_22 are linearly related to one another, a typical characteristic of transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves in homogeneous media.

Since the originally desired real-valued solution formula_23 of the scalar wave equation can be simply obtained by taking the real part of formula_24, solving the following equation, known as the Helmholtz equation, is mostly concerned as treating a complex-valued function is often much easier than treating the corresponding real-valued function. 
formula_25

===Solving the Helmholtz equation===

Solutions to the Helmholtz equation in the Cartesian coordinate system may readily be found via the principle of separation of variables for partial differential equations. This principle says that in separable orthogonal coordinates, an &quot;elementary product solution&quot; to this wave equation may be constructed of the following form:
formula_26
i.e., as the product of a function of &quot;x&quot;, times a function of &quot;y&quot;, times a function of &quot;z&quot;. If this &quot;elementary product solution&quot; is substituted into the wave equation, using the scalar Laplacian in the Cartesian coordinates system
formula_27
then the following equation for the 3 individual functions is obtained
formula_28
which is readily rearranged into the form:
formula_29

It may now be argued that each quotient in the equation above must, of necessity, be constant. To justify this, let&#x27;s say that the first quotient is not a constant, and is a function of &quot;x&quot;. Since none of the other terms in the equation has any dependence on the variable &quot;x&quot;, so the first term also must not have any &quot;x&quot;-dependence; it must be a constant. (If the first term is a function of &quot;x&quot;, then there is no way to make the left hand side of this equation be zero.) This constant is denoted as -&quot;k&quot;x2. Reasoning in a similar way for the &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; quotients, three ordinary differential equations are obtained for the &quot;f&quot;x, &quot;f&quot;y and &quot;f&quot;z, along with one &quot;separation condition&quot;:

formula_30

Each of these 3 differential equations has the same solution form: sines, cosines or complex exponentials. We&#x27;ll go with the complex exponential as formula_31 to be a complex function. As a result, the elementary product solution formula_31 is
formula_33
with a generally complex number formula_34. This solution is the spatial part of a complex-valued Cartesian component (e.g., formula_35, formula_36, or formula_37 as the electric field component along each axis in the Cartesian coordinate system) of a propagating plane wave. formula_38 (formula_39, formula_40, or formula_41) is a real number here since waves in a source-free medium has been assumed so each plane wave is not decayed or amplified as it propagates in the medium. The negative sign of formula_38 (formula_43, formula_40, or formula_41) in a wave vector formula_46 (where formula_47) means that the wave propagation direction vector has a positive formula_48 (formula_43, formula_40, or formula_41)-component, while the positive sign of formula_38 means a negative formula_48 (formula_43, formula_40, or formula_41)-component of that vector.

Product solutions to the Helmholtz equation are also readily obtained in cylindrical and spherical coordinates, yielding cylindrical and spherical harmonics (with the remaining separable coordinate systems being used much less frequently).

=== The complete solution: the superposition integral ===

A general solution to the homogeneous electromagnetic wave equation at a fixed time frequency formula_57 in the Cartesian coordinate system may be formed as a weighted superposition of all possible elementary plane wave solutions as

with the constraints of formula_58, each formula_38 as a real number, and formula_60 where formula_61. In this superposition, formula_62 is the weight factor or the amplitude of the plane wave component with the wave vector formula_63 where formula_64 is determined in terms of formula_65 and formula_66 by the mentioned constraint.

Next, let formula_67
Then: formula_68

The plane wave spectrum representation of a general electromagnetic field (e.g., a spherical wave) in the equation () is the basic foundation of Fourier optics (this point cannot be emphasized strongly enough), because at &quot;z&quot; = 0, the equation simply becomes a Fourier transform (FT) relationship between the field and its plane wave contents (hence the name, &quot;Fourier optics&quot;).

Thus:
formula_69
and
formula_70

All spatial dependence of each plane wave component is described explicitly by an exponential function. The coefficient of the exponential is a function of only two components of the wave vector for each plane wave (since other remained component can be determined via the above mentioned constraints), for example formula_65 and formula_66, just as in ordinary Fourier analysis and Fourier transforms.

=== Connection between Fourier optics and imaging resolution ===
Let&#x27;s consider an imaging system where the z-axis is the optical axis of the system and the object plane (to be imaged on the image plane of the system) is the plane at formula_73. On the object plane, the spatial part of a complex-valued Cartesian component of a wave is, as shown above, formula_74 with the &quot;constraints&quot; of formula_75, each formula_38 as a real number, and formula_77 where formula_61. The imaging is the reconstruction of a wave on the object plane (having information about a pattern on the object plane to be imaged) on the image plane via the proper wave propagation from the object to the image planes, (E.g., think about the imaging of an image in an aerial space.) and the wave on the object plane, that fully follows the pattern to be imaged, is in principle, described by the &quot;unconstrained&quot; inverse Fourier transform formula_79 where formula_38 takes an infinite range of real numbers. It means that, for a given light frequency, only a part of the full feature of the pattern can be imaged because of the above-mentioned constraints on formula_38; (1) a fine feature which representation in the inverse Fourier transform requires spatial frequencies formula_82, where formula_83 are transverse wave numbers satisfying formula_84, can not be fully imaged since waves with such formula_83 do not exist for the given light of formula_86 (This phenomenon is known as the diffraction limit.), and (2) spatial frequencies with formula_87 but close to formula_21 so higher wave outgoing angles with respect to the optical axis, requires a high NA (Numerical Aperture) imaging system that is expensive and difficult to build. For (1), even if complex-valued longitudinal wavenumbers formula_64 are allowed (by an unknown interaction between light and the object plane pattern that is usually a solid material), formula_64 give rise to light decay along the formula_91 axis (Light amplification along the formula_91 axis does not physically make sense if there is no amplification material between the object and image planes, and this is a usual case.) so waves with such formula_64 may not reach the image plane that is usually sufficiently far way from the object plane.

In connection with photolithography of electronic components, these (1) and (2) are the reasons why light of a higher frequency (smaller wavelength, thus larger magnitude of formula_21) or a higher NA imaging system is required to image finer features of integrated circuits on a photoresist on a wafer. As a result, machines realizing such an optical lithography have become more and more complex and expensive, significantly increasing the cost of the electronic component production.

== The paraxial approximation ==

===Paraxial wave propagation (optic axis assumed as z axis)===

A solution to the Helmholtz equation as the spatial part of a complex-valued Cartesian component of a single frequency wave is assumed to take the form:
formula_95
where formula_96 is the wave vector, and
formula_97
and
formula_98
is the wave number. Next, use the paraxial approximation, that is a small-angle approximation such that
formula_99
so, up to the second order approximation of trigonometric functions (that is, taking only up to the second term in the Taylor series expansion of each trigonometric function),
formula_100

where formula_101 is the angle (in radian) between the wave vector k and the z-axis as the optical axis of an optical system under discussion.

As a result,
formula_102
and
formula_103

=== The paraxial wave equation ===

Substituting this expression into the Helmholtz equation, the paraxial wave equation is derived:
formula_104
where
formula_105
is the transverse Laplace operator in the Cartesian coordinates system. In the derivation of the paraxial wave equation, the following approximations are used.

* formula_101 is small (formula_107) so a term with formula_108 is ignored.
* Terms with formula_109 and formula_110 are much smaller than a term with formula_111 (or formula_112) so these two terms are ignored.
* formula_113 so a term with formula_114 is ignored. It is the slowly varying envelope approximation, means that the amplitude or envelope of a wave formula_115 is slowly varying compared with the major period of the wave formula_116.

== The far field approximation ==

The equation () above may be evaluated asymptotically in the far field (using the stationary phase method) to show that the field at a distant point formula_117 is indeed due solely to the plane wave component with the wave vector formula_63 which propagates parallel to the vector formula_117, and whose plane is tangent to the phasefront at formula_117. The mathematical details of this process may be found in Scott [1998] or Scott [1990]. The result of performing a stationary phase integration on the expression above is the following expression,
{r}~ E_u(k~\sin\theta~\cos\phi,k~\sin\theta~\sin\phi) &lt;/math&gt;|}}
which clearly indicates that the field at formula_117 is directly proportional to the spectral component in the direction of formula_117, where,
* formula_123
* formula_124
* formula_125
and
* formula_126
* formula_127
* formula_128

Stated another way, the radiation pattern of any planar field distribution is the FT (Fourier Transform) of that source distribution (see Huygens–Fresnel principle, wherein the same equation is developed using a Green&#x27;s function approach). Note that this is NOT a plane wave. The formula_129 radial dependence is a spherical wave - both in magnitude and phase - whose local amplitude is the FT of the source plane distribution at that far field angle. A plane wave spectrum does not necessarily mean that the field as the superposition of the plane wave components in that spectrum behaves something like a plane wave at far distances.

=== Spatial versus angular bandwidth ===

The equation () above is critical to making the connection between &quot;spatial bandwidth&quot; (on the one hand) and &quot;angular bandwidth&quot; (on the other), in the far field. Note that the term &quot;far field&quot; usually means we&#x27;re talking about a converging or diverging spherical wave with a pretty well defined phase center. The connection between spatial and angular bandwidth in the far field is essential in understanding the low pass filtering property of thin lenses. See the section 6.1.3 for the condition defining the far field region.

Once the concept of angular bandwidth is understood, the optical scientist can &quot;jump back and forth&quot; between the spatial and spectral domains to quickly gain insights which would ordinarily not be so readily available just through spatial domain or ray optics considerations alone. For example, any source bandwidth which lies past the edge angle to the first lens (This edge angle sets the bandwidth of the optical system.) will not be captured by the system to be processed.

As a side note, electromagnetics scientists have devised an alternative means to calculate an electric field in a far zone which does not involve stationary phase integration. They have devised a concept known as &quot;fictitious magnetic currents&quot; usually denoted by M, and defined as
formula_130
In this equation, it is assumed that the unit vector in the z-direction points into the half-space where the far field calculations will be made. These equivalent magnetic currents are obtained using equivalence principles which, in the case of an infinite planar interface, allow any electric currents J to be &quot;imaged away&quot; while the fictitious magnetic currents are obtained from twice the aperture electric field (see Scott [1998]). Then the radiated electric field is calculated from the magnetic currents using an equation similar to the equation for the magnetic field radiated by an electric current. In this way, a vector equation is obtained for the radiated electric field in terms of the aperture electric field, and the derivation requires no use of stationary phase ideas.

==The plane wave spectrum: the foundation of Fourier optics==
The plane wave spectrum concept is the basic foundation of Fourier Optics. The plane wave spectrum is a continuous spectrum of &quot;uniform&quot; plane waves, and there is one plane wave component in the spectrum for every tangent point on the far-field phase front. The amplitude of that plane wave component would be the amplitude of the optical field at that tangent point. Again, this is true only in the far field, roughly defined as the range beyond formula_131 where formula_132 is the maximum linear extent of the optical sources and formula_19 is the wavelength (Scott [1998]). The plane wave spectrum is often regarded as being discrete for certain types of periodic gratings, though in reality, the spectra from gratings are continuous as well, since no physical device can have the infinite extent required to produce a true line spectrum.

Likely to electrical signals, bandwidth in optics is a measure of how finely detailed an image is; the finer the detail, the greater the bandwidth required to represent it. A DC (Direct Current) electrical signal is constant and has no oscillations; a plane wave propagating parallel to the optic (formula_91) axis has constant value in any &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; plane, and therefore is analogous to the (constant) DC component of an electrical signal. Bandwidth in electrical signals relates to the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies present in the spectrum of a signal, practically with a criterion to cut off high and low frequency edges of the spectrum to represent bandwidth in a number. For &quot;optical&quot; systems, bandwidth also relates to spatial frequency content (spatial bandwidth), but it also has a secondary meaning. It also measures how far from the optic axis the corresponding plane waves are tilted, and so this type of bandwidth is often referred to also as angular bandwidth. It takes more frequency bandwidth to produce a short pulse in an electrical circuit, and more angular (or, spatial frequency) bandwidth to produce a sharp spot in an optical system (see discussion related to Point spread function).

The plane wave spectrum arises naturally as the eigenfunction or &quot;natural mode&quot; solution to the homogeneous electromagnetic wave equation in rectangular coordinates (see also Electromagnetic radiation, which derives the wave equation from Maxwell&#x27;s equations in source-free media, or Scott [1998]). In the frequency domain, with an assumed time convention of formula_135, the homogeneous electromagnetic wave equation becomes what is known as the Helmholtz equation and takes the form

where formula_136 and formula_137 is the wavenumber of the medium.

===Eigenfunction (natural mode) solutions: background and overview===

In the case of differential equations, as in the case of matrix equations, whenever the right-hand side of an equation is zero (For example, a forcing function, forcing vector, or the source of a force is zero.), the equation may still admit a non-trivial solution, known in applied mathematics as an eigenfunction solution, in physics as a &quot;natural mode&quot; solution, and in electrical circuit theory as the &quot;zero-input response.&quot; This is a concept that spans a wide range of physical disciplines. Common physical examples of &quot;resonant&quot; natural modes would include the resonant vibrational modes of stringed instruments (1D), percussion instruments (2D) or the former Tacoma Narrows Bridge (3D). Examples of &quot;propagating&quot; natural modes would include waveguide modes, optical fiber modes, solitons and Bloch waves. an Infinite homogeneous media admits the rectangular, circular and spherical harmonic solutions to the Helmholtz equation, depending on the coordinate system under consideration. The propagating plane waves that we&#x27;ll study in this article are perhaps the simplest type of propagating waves found in any type of media.

There is a striking similarity between the Helmholtz equation () above, which may be written
formula_138
and the usual equation form for the eigenvalues / eigenvectors of a square matrix A,
formula_139

particularly since both the scalar Laplacian formula_140 and the matrix A are linear operators on their respective functions / vector spaces. (The minus sign in this matrix equation is, for all intents and purposes, immaterial. However, the plus sign in the Helmholtz equation is significant.) It is perhaps worthwhile to note that the eigenfunction solutions / eigenvector solutions to the Helmholtz equation / the matrix equation, often yield an orthogonal set of the eigenfunctions / the eigenvectors which span (i.e., form a basis set for) the function space / vector space under consideration. The interested reader may investigate other functional linear operators (so for different equations than the Helmholtz equation) which give rise to different kinds of orthogonal eigenfunctions such as Legendre polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials and Hermite polynomials.

In the matrix equation case in which A is a square matrix, eigenvalues formula_19 may be found by setting the determinant of the matrix equal to zero, i.e. finding where the matrix has no inverse. (Such a square matrix is said to be singular.) Finite matrices have only a finite number of eigenvalues/eigenvectors, whereas linear operators can have a countably infinite number of eigenvalues/eigenfunctions (in confined regions) or uncountably infinite (continuous) spectra of solutions, as in unbounded regions.

In certain physics applications such as in the computation of bands in a periodic volume, it is often a case that the elements of a matrix will be very complicated functions of frequency and wavenumber, and the matrix will be non-singular (I.e., it has the inverse matrix.) for most combinations of frequency and wavenumber, but will also be singular (I.e., it does not have the inverse matrix.) for certain specific combinations. By finding which combinations of frequency and wavenumber drive the determinant of the matrix to zero, the propagation characteristics of the medium may be determined. Relations of this type, between frequency and wavenumber, are known as dispersion relations and some physical systems may admit many different kinds of dispersion relations. An example from electromagnetics is an ordinary waveguide, which may admit numerous dispersion relations, each associated with a unique propagation mode of the waveguide. Each propagation mode of the waveguide is known as an eigenfunction solution (or eigenmode solution) to Maxwell&#x27;s equations in the waveguide. Free space also admits eigenmode (natural mode) solutions (known more commonly as plane waves), but with the distinction that for any given frequency, free space admits a continuous modal spectrum, whereas waveguides have a discrete mode spectrum. In this case, the dispersion relation is linear, as in section 1.3.

=== K-space ===

For a given formula_21 such as formula_77 for a homogeneous vacuum space, the separation condition,
formula_144
which is identical to the equation for the Euclidean metric in a three-dimensional configuration space, suggests the notion of a k-vector in a three-dimensional &quot;k-space&quot;, defined (for propagating plane waves) in rectangular coordinates as:
formula_145
and in the spherical coordinate system as
* formula_126
* formula_127
* formula_128

Use will be made of these spherical coordinate system relations in the next section.

The notion of k-space is central to many disciplines in engineering and physics, especially in the study of periodic volumes, such as in crystallography and the band theory of semiconductor materials.

=== The two-dimensional Fourier transform ===

A spectrum analysis equation (calculating the spectrum of a function formula_149):
formula_150

A synthesis equation (reconstructing the function formula_149 from its spectrum):
formula_152

The normalizing factor of formula_153 is present whenever angular frequency (radians) is used, but not when ordinary frequency (cycles) is used.

==Optical systems: general overview and analogy with electrical signal processing systems==

In a high level overview, an optical system consists of three parts; an input plane, and output plane, and a set of components between these planes that transform an image &quot;f&quot; formed in the input plane into a different image &quot;g&quot; formed in the output plane. The optical system output image &quot;g&quot; is related to the input image &quot;f&quot; by convolving the input image with the optical impulse response function of the optical system, &quot;h&quot; (known as the &quot;point-spread function&quot;, for focused optical systems). The impulse response function uniquely defines the input-output behavior of the optical system. By convention, the optical axis of the system is taken as the &quot;z&quot;-axis. As a result, the two images and the impulse response function are all functions of the transverse coordinates, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.
formula_154

The impulse response of an optical imaging system is the output plane field which is produced when an ideal mathematical optical field point source of light, that is an impulse input to the system, is placed in the input plane (usually on-axis, i.e., on the optical axis). In practice, it is not necessary to have an ideal point source in order to determine an exact impulse response. This is because any source bandwidth which lies outside the bandwidth of the optical system under consideration won&#x27;t matter anyway (since it cannot even be captured by the optical system), so therefore it&#x27;s not necessary in determining the impulse response. The source only needs to have at least as much (angular) bandwidth as the optical system.

Optical systems typically fall into one of two different categories. The first is ordinary focused optical imaging systems (e.g., cameras), wherein the input plane is called the object plane and the output plane is called the image plane. An optical field in the image plane (the output plane of the imaging system) is desired to be a high-quality reproduction of an optical field in the object plane (the input plane of the imaging system). The impulse response function of an optical imaging system is desired to approximate a 2D delta function, at the location (or a linearly scaled location) in the output plane corresponding to the location of the impulse (an ideal point source) in the input plane. The &quot;actual&quot; impulse response function of an imaging system typically resembles an Airy function, whose radius is on the order of the wavelength of the light used. The impulse response function in this case is typically referred to as a point spread function, since the mathematical point of light in the object plane has been spread out into an Airy function in the image plane.

The second type is optical image processing systems, in which a significant feature in the input plane optical field is to be located and isolated. In this case, the impulse response of such a system is desired to be a close replica (picture) of that feature which is being searched for in the input plane field, so that a convolution of the impulse response (an image of the desired feature) against the input plane field will produce a bright spot at the feature location in the output plane. It is this latter type of optical &quot;image processing&quot; system that is the subject of this section. The section 6.2 presents one hardware implementation of the optical image processing operations described in this section.

=== Input plane ===

The input plane is defined as the locus of all points such that &quot;z&quot; = 0. The input image &quot;f&quot; is therefore
formula_155

=== Output plane ===

The output plane is defined as the locus of all points such that &quot;z&quot; = &quot;d&quot;. The output image &quot;g&quot; is therefore
formula_156

=== The 2D convolution of input function against the impulse response function ===

formula_157
i.e.,
The alert reader will note that the integral above tacitly assumes that the impulse response is NOT a function of the position (x&#x27;,y&#x27;) of the impulse of light in the input plane (if this were not the case, this type of convolution would not be possible). This property is known as &quot;shift invariance&quot; (Scott [1998]). No optical system is perfectly shift invariant: as the ideal, mathematical point of light is scanned away from the optic axis, aberrations will eventually degrade the impulse response (known as a coma in focused imaging systems). However, high quality optical systems are often &quot;shift invariant enough&quot; over certain regions of the input plane that we may regard the impulse response as being a function of only the difference between input and output plane coordinates, and thereby use the equation above with impunity.

Also, this equation assumes unit magnification. If magnification is present, then eqn. () becomes

which basically translates the impulse response function, &quot;hM&quot;(), from &quot;x′&quot; to &quot;x&quot; = &quot;Mx′&quot;. In eqn. (), &quot;hM&quot; will be a magnified version of the impulse response function &quot;h&quot; of a similar, unmagnified system, so that &quot;hM&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;/&quot;M&quot;,&quot;y&quot;/&quot;M&quot;).

=== Derivation of the convolution equation ===
The extension to two dimensions is trivial, except for the difference that causality exists in the time domain, but not in the spatial domain. Causality means that the impulse response &quot;h&quot;(&quot;t&quot; − &quot;t′&quot;) of an electrical system, due to an impulse applied at time &quot;t&#x27;&quot;, must of necessity be zero for all times &quot;t&quot; such that &quot;t&quot; − &quot;t′&quot; &lt; 0.

Obtaining the convolution representation of the system response requires representing the input signal as a weighted superposition over a train of impulse functions by using the &quot;sifting property&quot; of Dirac delta functions.
formula_158

It is then presumed that the system under consideration is &quot;linear&quot;, that is to say that the output of the system due to two different inputs (possibly at two different times) is the sum of the individual outputs of the system to the two inputs, when introduced individually. Thus the optical system may contain no nonlinear materials nor active devices (except possibly, extremely linear active devices). The output of the system, for a single delta function input is defined as the &quot;impulse response&quot; of the system, &quot;h&quot;(&quot;t&quot; − &quot;t′&quot;). And, by our linearity assumption (i.e., that the output of system to a pulse train input is the sum of the outputs due to each individual pulse), we can now say that the general input function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) produces the output:
formula_159
where &quot;h&quot;(&quot;t&quot; − &quot;t′&quot;) is the (impulse) response of the linear system to the delta function input &quot;δ&quot;(&quot;t&quot; − &quot;t′&quot;), applied at time &quot;t&quot;&#x27;. This is where the convolution equation above comes from. The convolution equation is useful because it is often much easier to find the response of a system to a delta function input - and then perform the convolution above to find the response to an arbitrary input - than it is to try to find the response to the arbitrary input directly. Also, the impulse response (in either time or frequency domains) usually yields insight to relevant figures of merit of the system. In the case of most lenses, the point spread function (PSF) is a pretty common figure of merit for evaluation purposes.

The same logic is used in connection with the Huygens–Fresnel principle, or Stratton-Chu formulation, wherein the &quot;impulse response&quot; is referred to as the Green&#x27;s function of the system. So the spatial domain operation of a linear optical system is analogous in this way to the Huygens–Fresnel principle.

=== System transfer function ===
If the last equation above is Fourier transformed, it becomes:
formula_160
where
* formula_161 is the spectrum of the output signal
* formula_162 is the system transfer function
* formula_163 is the spectrum of the input signal

In like fashion, eqn. () may be Fourier transformed to yield:

formula_164

The system transfer function, formula_165. In optical imaging this function is better known as the optical transfer function &quot;(Goodman)&quot;.

Once again it may be noted from the discussion on the Abbe sine condition, that this equation assumes unit magnification.

This equation takes on its real meaning when the Fourier transform, formula_166 is associated with the coefficient of the plane wave whose transverse wavenumbers are formula_167. Thus, the input-plane plane wave spectrum is transformed into the output-plane plane wave spectrum through the multiplicative action of the system transfer function. It is at this stage of understanding that the previous background on the plane wave spectrum becomes invaluable to the conceptualization of Fourier optical systems.

==Applications of Fourier optics principles==
Fourier optics is used in the field of optical information processing, the staple of which is the classical 4F processor.

The Fourier transform properties of a lens provide numerous applications in optical signal processing such as spatial filtering, optical correlation and computer generated holograms.

Fourier optical theory is used in interferometry, optical tweezers, atom traps, and quantum computing. Concepts of Fourier optics are used to reconstruct the phase of light intensity in the spatial frequency plane (see adaptive-additive algorithm).

===Fourier transforming property of lenses===

If a transmissive object is placed at one focal length in front of a lens, then its Fourier transform will be formed at one focal length behind the lens. Consider the figure to the right (click to enlarge)

In this figure, a plane wave incident from the left is assumed. The transmittance function in the front focal plane (i.e., Plane 1) &quot;spatially modulates the incident plane wave&quot; in magnitude and phase, &quot;like on the left-hand side of eqn.&quot; () (specified to &quot;z&quot; = 0), and &quot;in so doing, produces a spectrum of plane waves&quot; corresponding to the FT of the transmittance function, &quot;like on the right-hand side of eqn.&quot; () (for &quot;z&quot; &gt; 0). The various plane wave components propagate at different tilt angles with respect to the optic axis of the lens (i.e., the horizontal axis). The finer the features in the transparency, the broader the angular bandwidth of the plane wave spectrum. We&#x27;ll consider one such plane wave component, propagating at angle &quot;θ&quot; with respect to the optic axis. It is assumed that &quot;θ&quot; is small (paraxial approximation), so that
formula_168
and
formula_169
and
formula_170

In the figure, the &quot;plane wave&quot; phase, moving horizontally from the front focal plane to the lens plane, is
formula_171
and the &quot;spherical wave&quot; phase from the lens to the spot in the back focal plane is:
formula_172
and the sum of the two path lengths is &quot;f&quot; (1 + &quot;θ&quot;2/2 + 1 − &quot;θ&quot;2/2) = 2&quot;f&quot;; i.e., it is a constant value, independent of tilt angle, &quot;θ&quot;, for paraxial plane waves. Each paraxial plane wave component of the field in the front focal plane appears as a point spread function spot in the back focal plane, with an intensity and phase equal to the intensity and phase of the original plane wave component in the front focal plane. In other words, the field in the back focal plane is the Fourier transform of the field in the front focal plane.

All FT components are computed simultaneously - in parallel - at the speed of light. As an example, light travels at a speed of roughly per nanosecond, so if a lens has a focal length, an entire 2D FT can be computed in about 2 ns (2 × 10−9 seconds). If the focal length is 1 in, then the time is under 200 ps. No electronic computer can compete with these kinds of numbers or perhaps ever hope to, although supercomputers may actually prove faster than optics, as improbable as that may seem. However, their speed is obtained by combining numerous computers which, individually, are still slower than optics. The disadvantage of the optical FT is that, as the derivation shows, the FT relationship only holds for paraxial plane waves, so this FT &quot;computer&quot; is inherently bandlimited. On the other hand, since the wavelength of visible light is so minute in relation to even the smallest visible feature dimensions in the image i.e.,
formula_173
(for all &quot;kx&quot;, &quot;ky&quot; within the spatial bandwidth of the image, so that &quot;kz&quot; is nearly equal to &quot;k&quot;), the paraxial approximation is not terribly limiting in practice. And, of course, this is an analog - not a digital - computer, so precision is limited. Also, phase can be challenging to extract; often it is inferred interferometrically.

Optical processing is especially useful in real time applications where rapid processing of massive amounts of 2D data is required, particularly in relation to pattern recognition.

====Object truncation and Gibbs phenomenon====

The spatially modulated electric field, shown on the left-hand side of eqn. (), typically only occupies a finite (usually rectangular) aperture in the x,y plane. The rectangular aperture function acts like a 2D square-top filter, where the field is assumed to be zero outside this 2D rectangle. The spatial domain integrals for calculating the FT coefficients on the right-hand side of eqn. () are truncated at the boundary of this aperture. This step truncation can introduce inaccuracies in both theoretical calculations and measured values of the plane wave coefficients on the RHS of eqn. ().

Whenever a function is discontinuously truncated in one FT domain, broadening and rippling are introduced in the other FT domain. A perfect example from optics is in connection with the point spread function, which for on-axis plane wave illumination of a quadratic lens (with circular aperture), is an Airy function, &quot;J&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;)/&quot;x&quot;. Literally, the point source has been &quot;spread out&quot; (with ripples added), to form the Airy point spread function (as the result of truncation of the plane wave spectrum by the finite aperture of the lens). This source of error is known as Gibbs phenomenon and it may be mitigated by simply ensuring that all significant content lies near the center of the transparency, or through the use of window functions which smoothly taper the field to zero at the frame boundaries. By the convolution theorem, the FT of an arbitrary transparency function - multiplied (or truncated) by an aperture function - is equal to the FT of the non-truncated transparency function convolved against the FT of the aperture function, which in this case becomes a type of &quot;Greens function&quot; or &quot;impulse response function&quot; in the spectral domain. Therefore, the image of a circular lens is equal to the object plane function convolved against the Airy function (the FT of a circular aperture function is &quot;J&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;)/&quot;x&quot; and the FT of a rectangular aperture function is a product of sinc functions, sin&quot;x&quot;/&quot;x&quot;).

==== Fourier analysis and functional decomposition ====

Even though the input transparency only occupies a finite portion of the &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; plane (Plane 1), the uniform plane waves comprising the plane wave spectrum occupy the entire &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; plane, which is why (for this purpose) only the longitudinal plane wave phase (in the &quot;z&quot;-direction, from Plane 1 to Plane 2) must be considered, and not the phase transverse to the &quot;z&quot;-direction. It is of course, very tempting to think that if a plane wave emanating from the finite aperture of the transparency is tilted too far from horizontal, it will somehow &quot;miss&quot; the lens altogether but again, since the uniform plane wave extends infinitely far in all directions in the transverse (&quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot;) plane, the planar wave components cannot miss the lens.

This issue brings up perhaps the predominant difficulty with Fourier analysis, namely that the input-plane function, defined over a finite support (i.e., over its own finite aperture), is being approximated with other functions (sinusoids) which have infinite support (i.e., they are defined over the entire infinite &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; plane). This is unbelievably inefficient computationally, and is the principal reason why wavelets were conceived, that is to represent a function (defined on a finite interval or area) in terms of oscillatory functions which are also defined over finite intervals or areas. Thus, instead of getting the frequency content of the entire image all at once (along with the frequency content of the entire rest of the &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; plane, over which the image has zero value), the result is instead the frequency content of different parts of the image, which is usually much simpler. Unfortunately, wavelets in the &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; plane don&#x27;t correspond to any known type of propagating wave function, in the same way that Fourier&#x27;s sinusoids (in the &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; plane) correspond to plane wave functions in three dimensions. However, the FTs of most wavelets are well known and could possibly be shown to be equivalent to some useful type of propagating field.

On the other hand, sinc functions and Airy functions - which are not only the point spread functions of rectangular and circular apertures, respectively, but are also cardinal functions commonly used for functional decomposition in interpolation/sampling theory [Scott 1990] - do correspond to converging or diverging spherical waves, and therefore could potentially be implemented as a whole new functional decomposition of the object plane function, thereby leading to another point of view similar in nature to Fourier optics. This would basically be the same as conventional ray optics, but with diffraction effects included. In this case, each point spread function would be a type of &quot;smooth pixel,&quot; in much the same way that a soliton on a fiber is a &quot;smooth pulse.&quot;

Perhaps a lens figure-of-merit in this &quot;point spread function&quot; viewpoint would be to ask how well a lens transforms an Airy function in the object plane into an Airy function in the image plane, as a function of radial distance from the optic axis, or as a function of the size of the object plane Airy function. This is somewhat like the point spread function, except now we&#x27;re really looking at it as a kind of input-to-output plane transfer function (like MTF), and not so much in absolute terms, relative to a perfect point. Similarly, Gaussian wavelets, which would correspond to the waist of a propagating Gaussian beam, could also potentially be used in still another functional decomposition of the object plane field.

==== Far-field range and the 2D2 / λ criterion ====

In the figure above, illustrating the Fourier transforming property of lenses, the lens is in the near field of the object plane transparency, therefore the object plane field at the lens may be regarded as a superposition of plane waves, each one of which propagates at some angle with respect to the z-axis. In this regard, the far-field criterion is loosely defined as: Range = 2&quot;D&quot;2/λ where &quot;D&quot; is the maximum linear extent of the optical sources and λ is the wavelength (Scott [1998]). The &quot;D&quot; of the transparency is on the order of cm (10−2 m) and the wavelength of light is on the order of 10−6 m, therefore &quot;D&quot;/λ for the whole transparency is on the order of 104. This times &quot;D&quot; is on the order of 102 m, or hundreds of meters. On the other hand, the far field distance from a PSF spot is on the order of λ. This is because D for the spot is on the order of λ, so that &quot;D&quot;/λ is on the order of unity; this times &quot;D&quot; (i.e., λ) is on the order of λ (10−6 m).

Since the lens is in the far field of any PSF spot, the field incident on the lens from the spot may be regarded as being a spherical wave, as in eqn. (), not as a plane wave spectrum, as in eqn. (). On the other hand, the lens is in the near field of the entire input plane transparency, therefore eqn. () - the full plane wave spectrum - accurately represents the field incident on the lens from that larger, extended source.

==== Lens as a low-pass filter ====

A lens is basically a low-pass plane wave filter (see Low-pass filter). Consider a &quot;small&quot; light source located on-axis in the object plane of the lens. It is assumed that the source is small enough that, by the far-field criterion, the lens is in the far field of the &quot;small&quot; source. Then, the field radiated by the small source is a spherical wave which is modulated by the FT of the source distribution, as in eqn. (), Then, the lens passes - from the object plane over onto the image plane - only that portion of the radiated spherical wave which lies inside the edge angle of the lens. In this far-field case, truncation of the radiated spherical wave is equivalent to truncation of the plane wave spectrum of the small source. So, the plane wave components in this far-field spherical wave, which lie beyond the edge angle of the lens, are not captured by the lens and are not transferred over to the image plane. Note: this logic is valid only for small sources, such that the lens is in the far field region of the source, according to the 2&quot;D&quot;2/λ criterion mentioned previously. If an object plane transparency is imagined as a summation over small sources (as in the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula, Scott [1990]), each of which has its spectrum truncated in this fashion, then every point of the entire object plane transparency suffers the same effects of this low pass filtering.

Loss of the high (spatial) frequency content causes blurring and loss of sharpness (see discussion related to point spread function). Bandwidth truncation causes a (fictitious, mathematical, ideal) point source in the object plane to be blurred (or, spread out) in the image plane, giving rise to the term, &quot;point spread function.&quot; Whenever bandwidth is expanded or contracted, image size is typically contracted or expanded accordingly, in such a way that the space-bandwidth product remains constant, by Heisenberg&#x27;s principle (Scott [1998] and Abbe sine condition).

==== Coherence and Fourier transforming ====

While working in the frequency domain, with an assumed &quot;e&quot;&quot;jωt&quot; (engineering) time dependence, coherent (laser) light is implicitly assumed, which has a delta function dependence in the frequency domain. Light at different (delta function) frequencies will &quot;spray&quot; the plane wave spectrum out at different angles, and as a result these plane wave components will be focused at different places in the output plane. The Fourier transforming property of lenses works best with coherent light, unless there is some special reason to combine light of different frequencies, to achieve some special purpose.

===Hardware implementation of the system transfer function: The 4F correlator ===

The theory on optical transfer functions presented in the section 5 is somewhat abstract. However, there is one very well known device which implements the system transfer function &quot;H&quot; in hardware using only 2 identical lenses and a transparency plate - the 4F correlator. Although one important application of this device would certainly be to implement the mathematical operations of cross-correlation and convolution, this device - 4 focal lengths long - actually serves a wide variety of image processing operations that go well beyond what its name implies. A diagram of a typical 4F correlator is shown in the figure below (click to enlarge). This device may be readily understood by combining the plane wave spectrum representation of the electric field (section 1.5) with the Fourier transforming property of quadratic lenses (section 6.1) to yield the optical image processing operations described in the section 5.

The 4F correlator is based on the convolution theorem from Fourier transform theory, which states that convolution in the spatial (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) domain is equivalent to direct multiplication in the spatial frequency (&quot;k&quot;x, &quot;k&quot;y) domain (aka: &quot;spectral domain&quot;). Once again, a plane wave is assumed incident from the left and a transparency containing one 2D function, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;), is placed in the input plane of the correlator, located one focal length in front of the first lens. The transparency spatially modulates the incident plane wave in magnitude and phase, like on the left-hand side of eqn. (), and in so doing, produces a spectrum of plane waves corresponding to the FT of the transmittance function, like on the right-hand side of eqn. (). That spectrum is then formed as an &quot;image&quot; one focal length behind the first lens, as shown. A transmission mask containing the FT of the second function, &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;), is placed in this same plane, one focal length behind the first lens, causing the transmission through the mask to be equal to the product, &quot;F&quot;(&quot;k&quot;x,&quot;k&quot;y) × &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;x,&quot;k&quot;y). This product now lies in the &quot;input plane&quot; of the second lens (one focal length in front), so that the FT of this product (i.e., the convolution of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) and &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;)), is formed in the back focal plane of the second lens.

If an ideal, mathematical point source of light is placed on-axis in the input plane of the first lens, then there will be a uniform, collimated field produced in the output plane of the first lens. When this uniform, collimated field is multiplied by the FT plane mask, and then Fourier transformed by the second lens, the output plane field (which in this case is the &quot;impulse response&quot; of the correlator) is just our correlating function, &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;). In practical applications, &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) will be some type of feature which must be identified and located within the input plane field (see Scott [1998]). In military applications, this feature may be a tank, ship or airplane which must be quickly identified within some more complex scene.

The 4F correlator is an excellent device for illustrating the &quot;systems&quot; aspects of optical instruments, alluded to in the section 5 above. The FT plane mask function, &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;x,&quot;k&quot;y) is the system transfer function of the correlator, which we&#x27;d in general denote as &quot;H&quot;(&quot;k&quot;x,&quot;k&quot;y), and it is the FT of the impulse response function of the correlator, &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) which is just our correlating function &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;). And, as mentioned above, the impulse response of the correlator is just a picture of the feature we&#x27;re trying to find in the input image. In the 4F correlator, the system transfer function &quot;H&quot;(&quot;k&quot;x,&quot;k&quot;y) is directly multiplied against the spectrum &quot;F&quot;(&quot;k&quot;x,&quot;k&quot;y) of the input function, to produce the spectrum of the output function. This is how electrical signal processing systems operate on 1D temporal signals.

=== Image restoration ===
Image blurring by a point spread function is studied extensively in optical information processing, one way to alleviate the blurring is to adopt Wiener Filter. For example, assume that formula_174 is the intensity distribution from an incoherent object, formula_175 is the intensity distribution of its image which is blurred by a space-invariant point-spread function formula_176 and a noise formula_177 introduced in the detection process:
formula_178

The goal of image restoration is to find a linear restoration filter that minimize the mean-squared error between the true distribution and the estimation formula_179. That is, to minimize
formula_180

The solution of this optimization problem is Wiener filter:
formula_181
where formula_182, formula_183, formula_184 are the power spectral densities of the point-spread function, the object and the noise.

Ragnarsson proposed a method to realize Wiener restoration filters optically by holographic technique like setup shown in the figure. The derivation of the function of the setup is described as follows.

Assume there is a transparency as the recording plane and an impulse emitted from a point source &quot;S&quot;. The wave of impulse is collimated by lens &quot;L&quot;1, forming a distribution equal to the impulse response formula_185. Then the distribution formula_185 is then split into two parts:

# The upper portion is first focused (i.e., Fourier transformed) by a lens &quot;L&quot;2 to a spot in the front focal plan of lens &quot;L&quot;3, forming a virtual point source generating a spherical wave. The wave is then collimated by lens &quot;L&quot;3 and produces a tilted plane wave with the form formula_187 at the recording plane.
# The lower portion is directly collimated by lens &quot;L3&quot;, yielding an amplitude distribution formula_188.

Therefore, the total intensity distribution is
formula_189

Assume formula_190 has an amplitude distribution formula_34 and a phase distribution formula_192 such that
formula_193

then we can rewrite intensity as follows:
formula_194

Note that for the point at the origin of the film plane (formula_195), the recorded wave from the lower portion should be much stronger than that from the upper portion because the wave passing through the lower path is focused, which leads to the relationship formula_196.

In Ragnarsson&#x27; s work, this method is based on the following postulates:

# Assume there is a transparency, with its amplitude transmittance formula_197 proportional to formula_176, that has recorded the known impulse response of the blurred system.
# The maximum phase formula_16 shift introduced by the filter is much smaller than formula_200 radians so that formula_201.
# The phase shift of the transparency after bleaching is linearly proportional to the silver density formula_132 present before bleaching.
# The density is linearly proportional to the logarithm of exposure formula_203
# The average exposure formula_204 is much stronger than varying exposure formula_205

By these postulates, we have the following relationship:
formula_206

Finally, we get a amplitude transmittance with the form of a Wiener filter:
formula_207

==Afterword: Plane wave spectrum within the broader context of functional decomposition==

Electrical fields can be represented mathematically in many different ways. In the Huygens–Fresnel or Stratton-Chu viewpoints, the electric field is represented as a superposition of point sources, each one of which gives rise to a Green&#x27;s function field. The total field is then the weighted sum of all of the individual Green&#x27;s function fields. That seems to be the most natural way of viewing the electric field for most people - no doubt because most of us have, at one time or another, drawn out the circles with protractor and paper, much the same way Thomas Young did in his classic paper on the double-slit experiment. However, it is by no means the only way to represent the electric field, which may also be represented as a spectrum of sinusoidally varying plane waves. In addition, Frits Zernike proposed still another functional decomposition based on his Zernike polynomials, defined on the unit disc. The third-order (and lower) Zernike polynomials correspond to the normal lens aberrations. And still another functional decomposition could be made in terms of Sinc functions and Airy functions, as in the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula and the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. All of these functional decompositions have utility in different circumstances. The optical scientist having access to these various representational forms has available a richer insight to the nature of these marvelous fields and their properties. These different ways of looking at the field are not conflicting or contradictory, rather, by exploring their connections, one can often gain deeper insight into the nature of wave fields.

=== Functional decomposition and eigenfunctions ===

The twin subjects of eigenfunction expansions and functional decomposition, both briefly alluded to here, are not completely independent. The eigenfunction expansions to certain linear operators defined over a given domain, will often yield a countably infinite set of orthogonal functions which will span that domain. Depending on the operator and the dimensionality (and shape, and boundary conditions) of its domain, many different types of functional decompositions are, in principle, possible.

<text>Virtual PC is a discontinued x86 emulator software for Microsoft Windows hosts and PowerPC-based Mac hosts. It was created by Connectix in 1997 and acquired by Microsoft in 2003, after which the program was renamed Microsoft Virtual PC. In July 2006, Microsoft released the Windows version free of charge. The Mac version was discontinued following the transition to Intel processors that same year.

In 2009, Microsoft released Windows Virtual PC, which is only compatible with Windows 7 hosts, and is the technical foundation for the latter&#x27;s Windows XP Mode. Windows Virtual PC does not officially support MS-DOS or operating systems older than Windows XP Professional SP3 as guests. Virtual PC was discontinued in 2011 in favour of Hyper-V.

== History and versions ==
Connectix Virtual PC, Microsoft Virtual PC 2004, Microsoft Virtual PC 2007, and Windows Virtual PC are successive versions of the same software. Versions of Virtual PC by Microsoft runs on several versions of Windows, beginning with Windows 2000 in Virtual PC 2004 and later Windows XP in Virtual PC 2007 onwards. These older versions were still available and support operating systems older than Windows XP. Windows Virtual PC only runs on Windows 7 and only supports versions of Windows beginning with Windows XP. Starting in Windows 8, Microsoft replaced Virtual PC with Hyper-V.

=== Virtual PC by Connectix ===
Virtual PC was originally developed as a Macintosh application for System 7.5 and released by Connectix in June 1997. The first version of Virtual PC designed for Windows-based systems, version 4.0, was released in June 2001. Virtual PC 4 was the first version with expandable drive images.

Connectix sold versions of Virtual PC bundled with a variety of guest operating systems, including Windows, OS/2, and Red Hat Linux. As virtualization&#x27;s importance to enterprise users became clear, Microsoft took interest in the sector and acquired Virtual PC and Virtual Server (unreleased at the time) from Connectix in February 2003.

Under agreement with Connectix, Innotek GmbH (makers of VirtualBox, now part of Oracle) ported version 5.0 to run on an OS/2 host. This version also included guest extensions (VM additions) for OS/2 guests, which could run on Windows, OS/2 or Mac OS X hosts using Virtual PC versions 5, 6 or 7. A new version of the guest extensions was later included with Microsoft&#x27;s Virtual PC 2004.

=== Microsoft Virtual PC ===


On July 12, 2006, Microsoft released Virtual PC 2004 SP1 for Windows free of charge, however the Mac version remained a paid software. The equivalent version for Mac, version 7, was the final version of Virtual PC for Mac. It ran on Mac OS X 10.2.8 or later for PowerPC and was a proprietary commercial software product.

Virtual PC 2007 was released only for the Windows platform, with public beta testing beginning October 11, 2006, and production release on February 19, 2007. It added support for hardware virtualization, &quot;undo disks&quot;, transfer statistic monitor for disk and network, and viewing virtual machines on multiple monitors and support for Windows Vista as both host and guest. The Windows Aero interface is disabled on Windows Vista guests due to limitations of the emulated video hardware; however, Aero effects can be rendered by connecting to the guest via Remote Desktop Services from an Aero-enabled Windows Vista host, provided that the guest is running Windows Vista Business or a higher edition. It initially did not support home editions of Windows as host OSes such as Windows XP Home Edition, Windows Vista Home Basic and Home Premium, however a hotfix for Virtual PC 2007 SP1 issued on February 20, 2009 (see below) rectified this. Windows XP Starter, Windows XP Media Center Edition and Windows Vista Starter is not supported on Virtual PC 2007, however the former and the latter are still supported as a guest OS. Support for Windows 2000 Professional as a host OS was dropped in Virtual PC 2007 and will not install at all on Windows 2000 hosts, however it is still supported as a guest OS.

&quot;Undo disks&quot; make it possible to revert virtual machines&#x27; state to an earlier point by storing changes into a separate codice_1 file since the last save to the main codice_2 file, which can be used for experimenting. The VHD file acts as a snapshot. The undo disk file (codice_1) incrementally stores changes made by the virtual machine compared to the main Virtual hard disk drive (VHD) image, which can be applied or discarded by the user. If deactivated, changes are directly written to the VHD file.

On May 15, 2008, Microsoft released Virtual PC 2007 Service Pack 1, which added support for both Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista SP1 and Windows 7 as guest and host OSes, as well as Windows Server 2008 Standard as a guest OS. A hotfix rollup for Virtual PC 2007 SP1, released February 20, 2009, solved networking issues and enhanced the maximum screen resolution to 2048×1920 (32-bit), enabling 16:9 resolutions such as 1920×1080. It also added official support for Windows XP Home Edition, Windows Vista Home Basic and Home Premium as both guest and host OSes. A security update was released on July 14, 2009 to address an elevation of privilege vulnerability in guest operating systems.

Microsoft Virtual PC (2004 and 2007) does not work at all on Windows 10 64-bit, and even on 32-bit platforms lack internet connectivity due to the lack of the VPC driver. This also impacts Windows Mobile emulators.

=== Windows Virtual PC ===
Windows Virtual PC entered public beta testing on April 30, 2009, and was released alongside Windows 7 on July 22, 2009. Windows Virtual PC is available free of charge for certain editions of Windows 7, either pre-installed by OEMs or via download from the Microsoft website. Unlike its predecessors, it supports only Windows 7 host operating systems. It originally required hardware virtualization support but on March 19, 2010, Microsoft released an update to Microsoft Virtual PC which allows it to run on PCs without hardware support.

==== New features ====
New features include:
* USB support and redirection – connect peripherals such as flash drives and digital cameras, and print from the guest to host OS printers. However, USB isochronous transfer mode is not supported Other methods involve simply just treating an active drive letter from a USB flash drive as a virtual hard drive.
* Seamless application publishing and launching – run Windows XP Mode applications directly from the Windows 7 desktop
* Support for multithreading – run multiple virtual machines concurrently, each in its own thread for improved stability and performance
* Smart card redirection – use smart cards connected to the host
* Integration with Windows Explorer – manage all VMs from a single Explorer folder (%USERPROFILE%\Virtual Machines)

==== Removed features ====
* The Virtual Machine console is replaced by an integrated &quot;Virtual Machines&quot; shell folder. Several options from the console have been removed such as &quot;Restore at start&quot;, CPU time performance settings, muting sound in inactive virtual machines, full-screen resolution related options, configuring the host key, mouse capture options and settings for requiring administrator permissions.
* Official guest support for operating systems earlier than Windows XP Professional
* Drag-and-drop file sharing between the guest and the host
* Direct sharing of folders between host and guest operating system (Only volumes may be shared between operating systems)
* Ability to commit changes in undo disks upon turning off virtual machines (Doing so is now only possible through virtual machine &quot;Settings&quot; dialog box)
* Ability to use physical and virtual Parallel ports
* User interface controls for using virtual floppy disks (Virtual floppy disk functionality, however, is still supported and may be accessed using a script)
* Virtual PC additions for guest operating systems no longer supported have been removed. However, installing Virtual Machine Additions from an older Microsoft virtualization product works for some guest OSes.
* Properties of the virtual machine, like guest OS, processor, processor features, video mode, video RAM, code cache, IDE controller reads and writes, Ethernet reads and writes, video frame rate and command line options can no longer be viewed.

==== System requirements ====
System requirements for Windows Virtual PC:
* Computer running Windows 7 (all editions except Starter)
* 15 GB of hard disk space per virtual Windows environment
* Optional: if the processor supports hardware-assisted virtualization technology such as AMD-V or Intel-VT, it will be used. Before March 19, 2010, such a processor was mandatory.

== Windows XP Mode ==

Windows XP Mode (XPM) is a virtual machine package for Windows Virtual PC containing a pre-installed, licensed copy of Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 3 as its guest OS. Previously, both the CPU and motherboard of the host had to support hardware virtualization, but an update in early 2010 eliminated this requirement. Pre-installed integration components allow applications running within the virtualized environment to appear as if running directly on the host, sharing the native desktop and start menu of Windows 7 as well as participating in file type associations. Windows XP Mode applications run in a Terminal Services session in the virtualized Windows XP, and are accessed via Remote Desktop Protocol by a client running on the Windows 7 host.

Applications running in Windows XP Mode do not have compatibility issues, as they are actually running inside a Windows XP virtual machine and redirected using RDP to the Windows 7 host. Windows XP Mode may be used to run 16-bit applications; it includes NTVDM, however it is impossible to run 16-bit applications that require hardware acceleration, as Windows Virtual PC does not have hardware acceleration for such applications.

Windows XP Mode is available free of charge to users of Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate. Users of other editions of Windows 7 are not eligible to download and use it. This restriction does not apply to Windows Virtual PC itself.

Windows XP Mode can also be run with VMware Player and VMware Workstation. However, like with Windows Virtual PC itself, VMware products only import Windows XP Mode on Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate versions in order to adhere with Microsoft licensing requirements.

== Emulated environment ==
Virtual PC emulates the following environments:
* Intel Pentium II (32-bit) processor (but virtualizes the host processor on Windows versions) with an Intel 440BX chipset (with PIIX4E southbridge).
* Standard SVGA VESA graphics card (S3 Trio32 PCI with 4 MB video RAM, adjustable in later versions up to 16 MB by manually editing a virtual machine&#x27;s settings file).
* System BIOS from American Megatrends (AMI).
* Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 ISA PnP. (When Windows Vista is installed as both the host (main) and guest (virtual) operating systems, settings are synchronized with the host and audio configuration is not required.)
* DEC 21041 (DEC 21140 in newer versions) Ethernet network card.
* Programs using undocumented features of hardware, exotic timings, or unsupported opcodes may not work.

Implementation:
* The Macintosh version of Virtual PC uses dynamic recompilation to translate the x86 code used by PCs into equivalent PowerPC code for Macs.
* The Windows version of Virtual PC also uses dynamic recompilation, but only to translate x86 kernel mode and real mode code into x86 user mode code; original user mode and virtual 8086 mode code run natively.
* Guest call traps are used, especially for guest extensions, to accelerate emulation or offer additional features, such as integration with the host environment.
* Virtual PC and Virtual Server encapsulate virtual hard disks in the Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) file format, for which Microsoft has made all documentation available under the Open Specification Promise.

Virtual PC 4 requires Mac OS 8.5 or later on a G3 or G4 processor, but running Windows Me, Windows 2000 or Red Hat Linux requires Mac OS 9.0 or later. Virtual PC 5 requires Mac OS 9.1 or newer or Mac OS X 10.1 or later. For USB support, Mac OS X is recommended. To run Virtual PC 5 in Mac OS X, a 400 MHz or faster processor is required.

Earlier versions of Virtual PC supported the following features: (now removed in Microsoft Virtual PC 2004, 2007, and Windows Virtual PC):
* Older versions of Virtual PC (v5.0 or earlier) may have the hard disk formatted after creating the Virtual Hard Disk file. Newer versions must partition and format the Virtual Hard Disk file manually.
* A &quot;Virtual Switch&quot; available in Virtual PC version 4.1 or earlier allows adding multiple network adapters.
* Older operating systems are supported with Virtual Machine additions.
* Older versions of Virtual PC for Macintosh can run on Mac OS 9.2.2 or earlier. Support for System 7.5 was dropped in version 3.

== Virtual machine integration components ==
Windows Virtual PC may enable guest operating systems running inside virtual machines to interact with their host operating system beyond what is feasible between two physical computers, such as sharing physical hardware components or exchanging data. To do so however, &quot;integration components&quot; must be installed on the guest operating systems. When no integration component is installed, the only mean of communicating between two machines (either virtual or physical) is through a virtual network interface. Even the mouse cursor can only be controlled by one operating system (either real or virtual) at any given time. However, once the Integration Components are installed on the guest operating systems, the following features are automatically activated:
* Mouse cursor sharing: Mouse cursor can be moved freely between the machines.
* Host-initiated shutdown: Virtual machine can be shut down, restarted or put into standby or hibernation via a set of API functions.
* Time synchronization: The virtual machine&#x27;s clock will be automatically synchronized with the host operating system&#x27;s clock.
* Process responsiveness monitoring: Host operating system will be able to detect whether the software on the guest operating system is responsive or hung.
* Dynamic screen resolution: The screen resolution of the guest operating system can be changed by simply resizing the window in which it is running. However, the VM can be configured to allow only standard resolutions.

In addition to features described above, guest operating systems may also take advantage of the following integration features but only when the administrator activates them:
* Audio sharing: Audio played on the guest operating system may be brought to the host operating system and played on it.
* Clipboard sharing: Contents such as text, picture or everything that is cut or copied to Windows Clipboard maybe pasted in other machines.
* Printer sharing: Guest operating systems may print on the host operating system&#x27;s printer. This feature should not be confused with File and Printer Sharing over an emulated network connection.
* Smart card sharing: Smart cards connected to host operating system may be accessed on guest operating systems.
* File sharing: Windows Virtual PC can also share disk partitions and disk drives of the host operating system with guest operating systems. This includes USB mass storage devices that are connected later.

In Windows Virtual PC, enabling integration features automatically makes the virtual machine user account accessible using Remote Desktop Connection.

== Supported host and guest operating systems ==
Virtual PC allows multiple guest operating systems to run virtualized on a single physical host. Although a number of popular host and guest operating systems lack official Microsoft support, there are sometimes few, if any, technical obstacles impeding installation. Instead, a configuration may be unsupported due to Microsoft&#x27;s own licensing restrictions, or a decision to focus testing and support resources elsewhere, especially when production use of a legacy product fades.

A program manager on Microsoft&#x27;s core virtualization team explains what official support entails:
As a product positioned for desktop use, Virtual PC provides official support for a different set of operating systems than its server-oriented counterpart, Microsoft Virtual Server and the more advanced Hyper-V. While the latter products support a range of server operating systems, Virtual PC 2007 supports only one variety as host and another as guest; its successor, Windows Virtual PC, supports none. And, whereas Virtual Server and Hyper-V have officially supported select Linux guests since 2006 and 2008, respectively, , no Microsoft release of Virtual PC has officially supported Linux. Nonetheless, a number of Linux distributions do run successfully in Virtual PC 2007, and can be used with the Virtual Machine Additions from Virtual Server (see below). Lastly, while 64-bit host support was introduced with Virtual PC 2007, release has been able to virtualize a 64-bit guest; Microsoft has thus far reserved this functionality for Hyper-V, which runs only on 64-bit (x64) editions of Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, Windows 8/8.1 Pro and Enterprise, and Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education.

In the following table and notes, &quot;support&quot; refers to official Microsoft support, as described above.


Notes – details of Microsoft support
Notes – not supported installations

=== Linux guests ===
Installing a Linux-based guest environment in Virtual PC is possible. RedHat and SuSe Linux guests are supported. Linux additions are supported in Microsoft Virtual Server, and these additions should also work in Virtual PC.

Some Linux distributions must be installed in text mode, as they do not support Microsoft Virtual PC&#x27;s emulated graphics chip. Ubuntu 8.10 &quot;Intrepid Ibex&quot; must be installed in SafeMode, but does not require other changes.

Some websites specialize in listing operating systems that run successfully as Virtual PC guests, to help users avoid issues when installing Linux distributions or other operating systems lacking official Microsoft support.

=== Intel-based Mac support ===
Microsoft announced on August 7, 2006, that Virtual PC for Mac would not be ported to the Intel Mac platform. Microsoft stated, &quot;Alternative solutions offered by Apple and other vendors, combined with a fully packaged retail copy of Windows, will satisfy this need.&quot; Similar products available or announced at the time were Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion.

<doc id="312017" wikidata="Q1141740" url="?curid=312017" title="Eiji Toyoda">
<text>was a Japanese industrialist. He was largely responsible for bringing Toyota Motor Corporation to profitability and worldwide prominence during his tenure as president and later, as chairman. He was succeeded as the president of Toyota by Shoichiro Toyoda.

==Career==
Toyoda studied mechanical engineering at Tokyo Imperial University from 1933 to 1936. During this time his cousin Kiichiro established an automobile plant at the Toyoda Automatic Loom Works in the city of Nagoya in central Japan. Toyoda joined his cousin in the plant at the conclusion of his degree and throughout their lives they shared a deep friendship. In 1938, Kiichiro asked Eiji to oversee construction of a newer factory about 32 km east of Nagoya on the site of a red pine forest in the town of Koromo, later renamed Toyota City. Known as the Honsha (&quot;headquarters&quot;) plant, to this day it is considered the &quot;mother factory&quot; for Toyota Motor production facilities worldwide.

Toyoda visited Ford River Rouge Complex at Dearborn, Michigan, during the early 1950s. He was awed by the scale of the facility but dismissive of what he saw as its inefficiencies. Toyota Motor had been in the business of manufacturing cars for 13 years at this stage, and had produced just over 2,500 automobiles. The Ford plant in contrast manufactured 8,000 vehicles a day. Due to this experience, Toyoda decided to adopt American automobile mass production methods but with a qualitative twist.

Toyoda collaborated with Taiichi Ohno, a veteran loom machinist, to develop core concepts of what later became known as the &#x27;Toyota Production System&#x27;, such as the Kanban system of labeling parts used on assembly lines, which was an early precursor to bar codes. They also fine-tuned the concept of Kaizen, a process of incremental but constant improvements designed to cut production and labor costs while boosting overall quality.

As a managing director of Toyota Motor, Toyoda failed in his first attempt to crack the U.S. market with the underpowered Toyota Crown sedan in the 1950s, but he succeeded with the Toyota Corolla compact in 1968, a year after taking over as president of the company. During the car&#x27;s development phase, Toyoda, as executive vice-president, had to overcome the objections of then-president Fukio Nakagawa to install a newly developed 1.0-liter engine, air conditioning and automatic transmissions in the Corolla.

Appointed the fifth president of Toyota Motor, Toyoda went on to become the company&#x27;s longest serving chief executive thus far. In 1981, he stepped down as president and assumed the title of chairman. He was succeeded as president by Shoichiro Toyoda. In 1983, as chairman, Eiji decided to compete in the luxury car market, which culminated in the 1989 introduction of Lexus. Toyoda stepped down as chairman of Toyota in 1994 at the age of 81.

==Later years and death==
In his later years, Toyoda was hospitalised for hip problems, and needed to use a wheelchair for a time, yet remained affable and enjoyed tackling sudoku puzzles. He spent most of his last years undergoing treatment at the Toyota Memorial Hospital in Toyota City, Japan, close to company headquarters.

Five days after his 100th birthday, Toyoda died of heart failure in the Toyota Memorial Hospital on 17 September 2013. Paying tribute to Toyoda, David Cole, former chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, said &quot;He was a real visionary and inspirational leader who understood what it would take to make Toyota a successful company.&quot; Leslie Kendall, curator of the Petersen Automotive Museum, described Toyoda as the Japanese equivalent of Henry Ford.

==Honours==

==Family tree==
Born into a family of textile manufacturers, Eiji Toyoda is the son of Heikichi Toyoda, the brother of Toyoda Loom Works founder Sakichi Toyoda. The descendants of Sakichi Toyoda have long dominated the upper management of Toyota Motors, which was incorporated in 1937. Eiji Toyoda died in September 2013. With his wife, Kazuko Toyoda (died 2002), he had three sons (Kanshiro, Tetsuro and Shuhei) and many grandchildren.

<text>VMware LLC is an American cloud computing and virtualization technology company headquartered in Palo Alto, California. VMware was the first commercially successful company to virtualize the x86 architecture.

VMware&#x27;s desktop software runs on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS. VMware ESXi, its enterprise software hypervisor, is an operating system that runs on server hardware.

On November 22, 2023, Broadcom Inc. acquired VMware in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at US$69 billion, with the End-User Computing (EUC) division of VMware then sold to KKR and rebranded to Omnissa.

==History==
===Early history===
In 1998, VMware was founded by Diane Greene, Mendel Rosenblum, Scott Devine, Ellen Wang, and Edouard Bugnion. Greene and Rosenblum were graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley. Edouard Bugnion remained the chief architect and CTO of VMware until 2005 and went on to found Nuova Systems (now part of Cisco). VMware operated in stealth mode for the first year, with roughly 20 employees by the end of 1998. The company was launched officially early in the second year, in February 1999, at the DEMO conference organized by Chris Shipley. The first product, VMware Workstation, was delivered in May 1999, and the company entered the server market in 2001 with VMware GSX Server (hosted) and VMware ESX Server (host-less).

In 2003, VMware launched VMware Virtual Center, vMotion, and Virtual Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) technology. 64-bit support was introduced in 2004.

===Acquisition by EMC===
On January 9, 2004, under the terms of the definitive agreement announced on December 15, 2003, EMC (now Dell EMC) acquired the company with US$625 million in cash. On August 14, 2007, EMC sold 15% of VMware to the public via an initial public offering. Shares were priced at per share and closed the day at .

On July 8, 2008, after disappointing financial performance, the board of directors fired VMware co-founder, president and CEO Diane Greene, who was replaced by Paul Maritz, a 14-year Microsoft veteran who was heading EMC&#x27;s cloud computing business unit. Greene had been CEO since the company&#x27;s founding, ten years earlier. On September 10, 2008, Mendel Rosenblum, the company&#x27;s co-founder, chief scientist, and the husband of Diane Greene, resigned.

On September 16, 2008, VMware announced a collaboration with Cisco Systems. One result was the Cisco Nexus 1000V, a distributed virtual software switch, an integrated option in the VMware infrastructure.

In April 2011, EMC transferred control of the Mozy backup service to VMware.

On April 12, 2011, VMware released an open-source platform-as-a-service system called Cloud Foundry, as well as a hosted version of the service. This supported application deployment for Java, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, and Scala, as well as database support for MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ.

In August 2012, Pat Gelsinger was appointed as the new CEO of VMware, coming over from EMC. Paul Maritz went over to EMC as Head of Strategy before moving on to lead the Pivotal spin-off.

In March 2013, VMware announced the corporate spin-off of Pivotal Software, with General Electric investing in the company. Most of VMware&#x27;s application- and developer-oriented products, including Spring, tc Server, Cloud Foundry, RabbitMQ, GemFire, and SQLFire were transferred to this organization.

In May 2013, VMware launched its own IaaS service, vCloud Hybrid Service, at its new Palo Alto headquarters (vCloud Hybrid Service was rebranded vCloud Air and later sold to cloud provider OVH), announcing an early access program in a Las Vegas data center. The service is designed to function as an extension of its customer&#x27;s existing vSphere installations, with full compatibility with existing virtual machines virtualized with VMware software and tightly integrated networking. The service is based on vCloud Director 5.1/vSphere 5.1.

In September 2013, at VMworld San Francisco, VMware announced the general availability of vCloud Hybrid Service and expansion to Sterling, Virginia, Santa Clara, California, Dallas, Texas, and a service beta in the UK. It announced the acquisition of Desktone in October 2013.

=== Acquisition by Dell ===
In January 2016, in anticipation of Dell&#x27;s acquisition of EMC, VMware announced a restructuring to reduce about 800 positions, and some executives resigned. The entire development team behind VMware Workstation and Fusion was disbanded and all US developers were immediately fired. On April 24, 2016, maintenance release 12.1.1 was released. On September 8, 2016, VMware announced the release of Workstation 12.5 and Fusion 8.5 as a free upgrade supporting Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016.

In April 2016, VMware president and COO Carl Eschenbach left VMware to join Sequoia Capital, and Martin Casado, VMware&#x27;s general manager for its Networking and Security business, left to join Andreessen Horowitz. Analysts commented that the cultures at Dell and EMC, and at EMC and VMware, are different, and said that they had heard that impending corporate cultural collisions and potentially radical product overlap pruning, would cause many EMC and VMware personnel to leave; VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger, following rumors, categorically denied that he would leave.

In August 2016 VMware introduced the VMware Cloud Provider website.

Mozy was transferred to Dell in 2016 after the merger of Dell and EMC.

In April 2017, according to Glassdoor, VMware was ranked 3rd on the list of highest paying companies in the United States.

In Q2 2017, VMware sold vCloud Air to French cloud service provider OVH.

On January 13, 2021, VMware announced that CEO Pat Gelsinger would be leaving to step in at Intel. Intel is where Gelsinger spent 30 years of his career and was Intel&#x27;s first chief technology officer. CFO Zane Rowe became interim CEO while the board searched for a replacement.

=== Spinoff from Dell ===
On April 15, 2021, it was reported that Dell would spin off its remaining stake in VMware to shareholders and that the two companies would continue to operate without major changes for at least five years. The spinoff was completed on November 1, 2021.

On May 12, 2021, VMware announced that Raghu Raghuram would take over as CEO.

In May 2022, VMware announced that the company had partnered with Formula One motor racing team, McLaren Racing.

===Log4Shell vulnerability===
Beginning in January 2022, hackers infiltrated servers using the Log4Shell vulnerability at organizations who failed to implement available patches released by VMware according to &quot;PCMag&quot;. ZDNET reported in March 2022 that hackers utilized Log4Shell on some customers&#x27; VMware servers to install backdoors and for cryptocurrency mining. In May 2022, &quot;Bleeping Computer&quot; reported that the Lazarus Group cybercrime group, which is possibly linked to North Korea, was actively using Log4Shell &quot;to inject backdoors that fetch information-stealing payloads on VMware Horizon servers&quot;, including VMware Horizon.

===Acquisition by Broadcom===
On May 26, 2022, Broadcom announced its intention to acquire VMware for approximately $61 billion in cash and stock in addition to assuming $8 billion of VMware&#x27;s net debt, and that Broadcom Software Group would rebrand and operate as VMware.

In November 2022, the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority regulator announced it would investigate whether the acquisition would &quot;result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services&quot;.

The transaction closed on November 22, 2023, after a prolonged delay in getting approval from the Chinese regulator on an additional condition that VMware&#x27;s server software should maintain compatibility with third-party hardware and not require the use of Broadcom&#x27;s hardware products. On completion, Broadcom reorganized the company into four divisions: VMware Cloud Foundation, Tanzu, Software-Defined Edge, and Application Networking and Security, and subsequently laid off over 2,800 employees. Broadcom also relocated its headquarters from North San Jose to VMware&#x27;s headquarters campus in Palo Alto.

On December 13, 2023, VMware ended availability for perpetually licensed products such as vSphere and Cloud Foundation, moving exclusively to subscription-based offerings. The company stated that this had been planned as an eventuality prior to the Broadcom acquisition.

In February 2024 private equity firm KKR and Broadcom agreed for KKR to acquire Broadcom&#x27;s End-User Computing (EUC) Division, formerly a division of VMware, for about $4 billion. This includes the VDI product Horizon and the device management suite Workspace ONE, formerly AirWatch.

On May 14, 2024, it was announced that VMware Workstation Pro and VMware Fusion Pro would be made free for personal use, with commercial use still requiring payment. In November 2024, VMware announced that commercial use would be free too.

===Acquisitions===

===Litigation===
In March 2015, the Software Freedom Conservancy announced it was funding litigation by Christoph Hellwig in Hamburg, Germany against VMware for alleged violation of his copyrights in its ESXi product.
Hellwig&#x27;s core claim is that ESXi is a derivative work of the GPLv2-licensed Linux kernel 2.4, and therefore VMware is not in compliance
with GPLv2 because it does not publish the source code to ESXi. VMware publicly stated that ESXi is not a derivative of the Linux kernel, denying Hellwig&#x27;s
core claim. VMware said it offered a way to use Linux device drivers with ESXi, and that code does use some Linux GPLv2-licensed code and so it had published the source, meeting GPLv2 requirements.

The lawsuit was dismissed by the court in July 2016 and Hellwig announced he would file an appeal. The appeal was decided February 2019 and again dismissed by German court, on the basis of not meeting &quot;procedural requirements for the burden of proof of the plaintiff.&quot;

In May 2023, VMware was ordered to pay $84.5 million for patent infringement on two patents belonging to Densify, a Canadian software company.

==Current products==
VMware&#x27;s most notable products are its hypervisors. VMware became well known for its first type 2 hypervisor known as VMware Workstation. This product has since evolved into two additional hypervisor product lines: VMware&#x27;s type 1 hypervisors running directly on hardware (ESX/ESXi) and their discontinued hosted type 2 hypervisors (GSX).

VMware software provides a completely virtualized set of hardware to the guest operating system. VMware software virtualizes the hardware for a video adapter, a network adapter, and hard disk adapters. The host provides pass-through drivers for guest USB, serial, and parallel devices. In this way, VMware virtual machines become highly portable between computers, because every host looks nearly identical to the guest. In practice, a system administrator can pause operations on a virtual machine guest, move or copy that guest to another physical computer, and there resume execution exactly at the point of suspension. Alternatively, for enterprise servers, a feature called vMotion allows the migration of operational guest virtual machines between similar but separate hardware hosts sharing the same storage (or, with vMotion Storage, separate storage can be used, too). Each of these transitions is completely transparent to any users on the virtual machine at the time it is being migrated.

VMware&#x27;s products predate the virtualization extensions to the x86 instruction set, and do not require virtualization-enabled processors. On newer processors, the hypervisor is now designed to take advantage of the extensions. However, unlike many other hypervisors, VMware still supports older processors. In such cases, it uses the CPU to run code directly whenever possible (as, for example, when running user-mode and virtual 8086 mode code on x86). When direct execution cannot operate, such as with kernel-level and real-mode code, VMware products use binary translation (BT) to re-write the code dynamically. The translated code gets stored in spare memory, typically at the end of the address space, which segmentation mechanisms can protect and make invisible. For these reasons, VMware operates dramatically faster than emulators, running at more than 80% of the speed that the virtual guest operating system would run directly on the same hardware. In one study VMware claims a slowdown over native ranging from 0–6 percent for the VMware ESX Server.

===Desktop software===
* VMware Workstation, introduced in 1999, was the first product launched by VMware. This software suite allows users to run multiple instances of x86 or x86-64-compatible operating systems on a single physical personal computer. Version 17.0 was released on November 17, 2022. Originally a commercial app, WMware Workstation has become freeware in December 2024.
* VMware Fusion (discontinued on 30 April 2024), provides similar functionality for users of the Intel Mac platform, along with full compatibility with virtual machines created by other VMware products.
* VMware Workstation Player (discontinued) was freeware for non-commercial use, without requiring a license, and available for commercial use with permission. It is similar to VMware Workstation, with some features not available, including support for UEFI Secure Boot, snapshots, encrypted virtual machines, and some advanced features.

===Server software===
* VMware ESXi, an enterprise software product, can deliver greater performance than the freeware VMware Server, due to lower system computational overhead. VMware ESXi, as a &quot;bare-metal&quot; product, runs directly on the server hardware, allowing virtual servers to also use hardware more or less directly. In addition, VMware ESXi integrates into VMware vCenter, which offers extra services.

===Cloud management software===
* VMware Suite – a cloud management platform purpose-built for a hybrid cloud. VMware vRealize Hyperic was acquired from SpringSource and subsequently discontinued in 2020.
* VMware Go is a web-based service to guide users of any expertise level through the installation and configuration of VMware vSphere Hypervisor.
* VMware Cloud Foundation – Cloud Foundation provides an easy way to deploy and operate a private cloud on an integrated SDDC system.
* VMware Horizon View is a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) product.
* vSphere+ and vSAN+ – activates add-on hybrid cloud services for business-critical applications running on-premises, including IT disaster recovery and ransomware protection

====Application management====
* VMware Workspace Portal was a self-service app store for workspace management.

* Provisioning
** PlateSpin (does Provisioning)

===Storage and availability===
VMware&#x27;s storage and availability products are composed of two primary offerings:

* VMware vSAN (previously called VMware Virtual SAN) is software-defined storage that is embedded in VMware&#x27;s ESXi hypervisor. The vSphere and vSAN software runs on industry-standard x86 servers to form a hyper-converged infrastructure (or HCI). However, network operators need to have servers from HCL (Hardware Compatibility List) to put one into production. The first release, version 5.5, was released in March 2014. The 6th generation, version 6.6, was released in April 2017. New features available in VMware vSAN 6.6 include native data at rest encryption, local protection for stretched clusters, analytics, and optimized solid-state drive performance. The VMWare 6.7 version was released in April 2018.
* VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) automates the failover and failback of virtual machines to and from a secondary site using policy-based management.

===Networking and security products===
* VMware NSX is VMware&#x27;s network virtualization product marketed using the term software-defined data center (SDDC). The technology included some acquired from the 2012 purchase of Nicira. Software Defined Networking (SDN) allows the same policies that govern Identity and Access Management (IAM) to dictate levels of access to applications and data through a totally converged infrastructure not possible with legacy network and system access methods.

===Other products===
* Workspace ONE allows mobile users to access apps and data.
* The VIX (Virtual Infrastructure eXtension) API allows automated or scripted management of a computer virtualized using either VMware&#x27;s vSphere, Workstation, Player, or Fusion products. VIX provides bindings for the programming languages C, Perl, Visual Basic, VBScript and C#.
* Herald is a communications protocol from VMware for more reliable Bluetooth communication and range finding for mobile devices. Herald code is available under an open-source license and was implemented in the Australian Government&#x27;s COVIDSafe app for contact tracing on 19 December 2020.

<text>Packet Switch Stream (PSS) was a public data network in the United Kingdom, provided by British Telecommunications (BT). It operated from the late 1970s through to the mid-2000s.

==Research, development and implementation==

=== EPSS ===
Roger Scantlebury was seconded from the National Physical Laboratory to the British Post Office Telecommunications division (BPO-T) in 1969. He had worked with Donald Davies in the late 1960s pioneering the implementation of packet switching and the associated communication protocols on the local-area NPL network. By 1973, BPO-T engineers had developed a packet-switching communication protocol from basic principles for an Experimental Packet Switched Service (EPSS) based on a virtual call capability. However, the protocols were complex and limited; Donald Davies described them as &quot;esoteric&quot;.

Ferranti supplied the hardware and software. The handling of link control messages (acknowledgements and flow control) was different from that of most other networks. The EPSS began operating in 1976, the first public data network in the UK. EPSS was interconnected with SATNET and the NPL network.

=== IPSS ===
The International Packet Switch Stream (IPSS) was an international network service, based on the X.25 standard, launched by the international division of BT. This venture was driven by the high demand for affordable access to US-based database and other network services. A service was provided by IPSS to this market, which started operation in 1978. IPSS was later linked to PSS and other packet switched networks around the world using gateways based on the X.75 standard.

IPSS was interconnected with SATNET. JANET Connections were available via IPSS.

=== PSS ===
A period of pre-operational testing with customers, mainly UK universities and computer manufacturers, began in 1980. Packet Switch Stream launched as a commercial service on 20 August 1981 based on X.25/X.75. The experimental predecessor network (EPSS) formally closed down on 31 July 1981 after all the existing connections had been moved to PSS.

The network was initially based upon a dedicated modular packet switch using DCC&#x27;s TP 4000 communication processor hardware. The operating system and the packet switching software were developed by Telenet (later on GTE Telenet). BT bought Telenet&#x27;s system via Plessey Controls of Poole, Dorset who also sold Telex and Traffic light systems. PSS was launched before Telenet&#x27;s own upgrade of its network and, at the time, most other networks still used general purpose mini-computers as packet switches.

For a brief time the EEC operated a packet switched network, Euronet, and a related project Diane to encourage more database and network services to develop in Europe. These connections moved over to PSS and other European networks as commercial X.25 services launched.

Later on the InterStream gateway between the Telex network and PSS was introduced based on a low speed PAD interface.

In addition, BT used Telematics packet switches for the Vascom network to support the Prestel service.

The network management systems were based in London and Manchester. Packet switches were installed at major trunk exchanges in most major conurbations in the UK. Network management was run on a system of 24 Prime 63xx and 48xx computers running a modified versions of Revisions 20 and 22 of the Primos operating system.

The DNICs used by IPSS and PSS were 2341 and 2342 respectively.

The last PSS node in the UK was finally switched off Wednesday, June 28, 2006.

== Description ==
Companies and individual users could connect into the PSS network using the full X.25 interface, via a dedicated four-wire telephone circuit using a PSS analog modem and later on, when problems of 10-100 ms transmission failures with the PCM Voice based transmission equipment used by the early Kilostream service were resolved, via a Kilostream digital access circuit (actually a baseband modem). In this early 1980s era installation lead times for suitable 4-wire analog lines could be more than 6 months in the UK.

Companies and individual users could also connect into the PSS network using a basic non-error correcting RS232/V.24 asynchronous character based interface via an X.3/X.28/X.29 PAD (Packet Assembler/Disassembler) service oriented to the then prevalent dumb terminal market place. The PAD service could be connected to via a dedicated four-wire telephone circuit using a PSS analog modem and later on via a Kilostream digital access circuit. However most customers, for cost reasons, chose to dial up via an analog modem over the then UK analog telephony network to their nearest public PAD, via published phone numbers, using an ID/password provided as a subscription service.

The current day analogy of ISPs offering broadband always on and dial up services to the internet applies here. Some customers connected to the PSS network via the X.25 service and bought their own PADs. PSS was one of the first telecommunications networks in the UK to be fully liberalised in that customers could connect their own equipment to the network. This was before privatisation and the creation of British Telecommunications plc (BT) in 1984.

===Connectivity to databases and mainframe systems===
PSS could be used to connect to a variety of online databases and mainframe systems. Of particular note was the use of PSS for the first networked Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS). This was a network system used to transfer all payments over £10,000 GBP (in early 1980s monetary value) between the major UK banks and other major financial institutions based in the UK. It replaced a paper based system that operated in the City of London using electrical vehicles similar to milk floats. Logica (now LogicaCMG) designed the CHAPS system and incorporated an encryption system able to cope with HDLC bit stuffing on X.25 links.

===Speeds===
There was a choice of different speeds of PSS lines; the faster the line the more expensive it cost to rent it. The highest and lowest speed lines were provided by the &quot;Megastream&quot; and &quot;Kilostream&quot; services, 2M (Mega) bit/s and 256K (kilo) bit/s respectively. On analog links 2400 bit/s, 4800 bit/s, 9600 bit/s and 48 kbit/s were offered. Individual users could link into PSS, on a pay as you go basis, by using a 110, 300, 1200/75, 1,200 or 2,400 bit/s PSTN modem to connect a Data Terminal Equipment terminal into a local PSS exchange. Note: in those days 2,400 bit/s modems were quite rare; 1,200 bit/s was the usual speed in the 1980s, although 110 and 300 bit/s modems were not uncommon.

== Investment challenges ==

=== Early years ===
PSS suffered from inconsistent investment during its early years. Sometimes not enough and sometimes too much but mostly for the wrong reasons. BT&#x27;s attitude to packet switching was ambivalent at best. France&#x27;s Transpac had a separate commercial company with dedicated management and saw X.25 packet switching as a core offering. BT&#x27;s then senior management regarded packet switching as a passing phase until the telecommunications nirvana of ISDN&#x27;s 64 kbit/s for everyone arrived.

=== Tymnet acquisition and exchange for other assets ===
BT bought the Tymnet network from McDonnell Douglas. BT subsequently exchanged major US elements of the Tymnet business with MCI for other assets when the proposed merger of their two businesses was thwarted by MCI&#x27;s purchase by WorldCom.

In the words of BT&#x27;s own history:
British Telecom purchased the Tymnet network systems business and its associated applications activities from the McDonnell Douglas Corporation on 19 November (1989) for $355 million. Its activities included TYMNET, the public network business, plus its associates private and hybrid (mixed public and private) network activities, the OnTyme electronic mail service, the Card Service processing business, and EDI*Net, the US market leader in electronic data interchange.

BT Tymnet anticipated developing an end to end managed network service for multi-national customers, and developing dedicated or hybrid networks that embraced major trading areas. Customers would be able to enjoy one-stop-shopping for global data networks, and a portfolio of products designed for a global market place.

These services were subsequently offered by BT Global Network Services, and subsequently by Concert as part of Concert Global Network Services after the Concert joint venture company was launched on 15 June 1994.
=== Later years ===
Even in later years, BT&#x27;s senior management stated that the Internet was &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;.

Investments in value added network services (VANS) and BT&#x27;s own access level packet switching hardware delayed operating profit. This in turn dented PSS&#x27;s low credibility with BT&#x27;s management still further. Despite healthy demand for basic X.25 services and the obvious trend for more demanding bandwidth intensive applications that required investment in more powerful switches a decision to develop BT&#x27;s own hardware and network applications was made instead.

In the midst of this IBM (the then market leader in computing) and BT attempted to launch a joint venture, called Jove, for managed SNA services in the UK. And for a time significant extra expenditure was allowed for BT&#x27;s data services, PSS being the major part, as one concern of regulators was this joint venture might damage work on Open Systems Interconnection. This only made cost control worse and achieving operating profit delayed further. Eventually the UK government decided the SNA joint venture was anti-competitive and vetoed it. But not before PSS management was allowed to commit to large investments that caused serious problems later.

One of the few successful value added applications was the transaction phone used to check credit cards by retailer to validate transactions and prevent fraud. It was believed that putting a packet switch in every local telephone exchange would allow this and other low bandwidth applications to drive revenue. The lesson of Tymnet&#x27;s similar transaction phone that just used a dial up link to a standard PAD based service was not followed. Each low end packet switch installed added costs for floor space, power, etc. without any significant value added revenue benefit resulting. Nor were they adequate for X.25 host traffic.

Ideas such as providing a menu based interface, called Epad, more user-friendly than X.28 was proven obsolete by the advent of Windows-based clients on PCs.

As the added value services, named PSS Plus collectively, added significant costs and headcount while contributed virtually no revenue a change in PSS&#x27;s management eventually resulted. While a decision was eventually made to put some of the basic network services people in senior positions and try to launch what had been developed this proved to be a major mistake. An exodus of people who were developing the value added network services helped reduce some costs. However significant on-going expenditure had been committed already to manufacture packet switch hardware and by using the very expensive Tandem computers in existing VANS. Operating profit was still not achieved and a further change in management with McKinsey consulting being called in.

McKinsey&#x27;s recommendation that increasing revenue while cutting costs was required to turn around the business was duly followed by the new management and an operating profit achieved in about 1988. This rested on running PSS efficiently and cutting the VANS as much as possible. PSS was then merged with other failing business like Prestel as it became part of a larger Managed Network Services division that was used to fix or close BT&#x27;s problem businesses.

==Legacy==

=== Communication protocols ===
Researchers on EPSS in the UK and elsewhere identified the need for defining higher-level protocols. The UK National Computing Centre publication &#x27;Why Distributed Computing&#x27;, which was based on extensive research into future potential configurations for computer systems. This resulted in the UK presenting the case for an international standards committee to cover this area at the ISO meeting in Sydney in March 1977. This work led to the OSI reference model in 1984 and the subsequent Internet-OSI Standards War.

=== Commercial ===
While PSS eventually went the way of all X.25 networks and was overwhelmed by the internet and more significantly the internet&#x27;s superior application suite and cost model, BT did not capitalise as much as other packet switch operators by subsequent mistakes concerning the internet, Tymnet, BT&#x27;s North American operations and the Concert Global Services with ATT.

BT&#x27;s failure to become the major ISP in its own home market unlike every other former PTT and the success of Dixon&#x27;s Freeserve, Demon and Energis based virtual ISPs in the same sector has only been recovered from recently. Only after BT changed its most senior management who were fixated on circuit switching/ISDN based on System X/Y telephone exchanges and embracing broadband/internet lock stock and barrel has this changed. An emergency rights issue also helped resolve the debt from acquiring second or third ranked old telcos style companies around the world.

Now BT appears to be inheriting a dominating position in the Global Network Services market, based on packet switching, as CSC and Reuters sell up their networks to BT. As the commodity price of IP services based in their core 21st century MPLS network to carry voice and data finally gives them the real cost efficiencies that packet switching always promised.

<text>Cowrie or cowry () is the common name for a group of small to large sea snails in the family Cypraeidae.

The term &quot;porcelain&quot; derives from the old Italian term for the cowrie shell () due to their similar appearance.

Cowrie shells have held cultural, economic, and ornamental significance in various cultures. The cowrie was the shell most widely used worldwide as shell money. It is most abundant in the Indian Ocean, and was collected in the Maldive Islands, in Sri Lanka, along the Indian Malabar coast, in Borneo and on other East Indian islands, in Maluku in the Pacific, and in various parts of the African coast from Ras Hafun to Mozambique. Cowrie shell money was important in the trade networks of Africa, South Asia, and East Asia.

In the United States and Mexico, cowrie species inhabit the waters off Central California to Baja California (the chestnut cowrie is the only cowrie species native to the eastern Pacific Ocean off the coast of the United States; further south, off the coast of Mexico, Central America and Peru, Little Deer Cowrie habitat can be found; and further into the Pacific from Central America, the Pacific habitat range of Money Cowrie can be reached) as well as the waters south of the Southeastern United States.

Some species in the family Ovulidae are also often referred to as cowries. In the British Isles the local &quot;Trivia&quot; species (family Triviidae, species &quot;Trivia monacha&quot; and &quot;Trivia arctica&quot;) are sometimes called cowries. The Ovulidae and the Triviidae are other families within Cypraeoidea, the superfamily of cowries and their close relatives.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;cowrie&quot; comes from Hindi (), which is itself derived from Sanskrit (&quot;&quot;).

== Shell description ==

The shells of cowries are usually smooth and shiny and more or less egg-shaped. The round side of the shell is called the Dorsal Face, whereas the flat under side is called the Ventral Face, which shows a long, narrow, slit-like opening (aperture), which is often toothed at the edges. The narrower end of the egg-shaped cowrie shell is the anterior end, and the broader end of the shell is called the posterior. The spire of the shell is not visible in the adult shell of most species, but is visible in juveniles, which have a different shape from the adults.

Nearly all cowries have a porcelain-like shine, with some exceptions such as Hawaii&#x27;s granulated cowrie, &quot;Nucleolaria granulata&quot;. Many have colorful patterns. Lengths range from for some species up to for the Atlantic deer cowrie, &quot;Macrocypraea cervus&quot;.

==Human use==
===Monetary use===

Cowrie shells, especially &quot;Monetaria moneta&quot;, were used for centuries as currency by native Africans. In his book &quot;Marriage and Morals&quot;, Bertrand Russell attributed the use of cowrie shells as currency in ancient Egypt to the similarity between shape of the shell and that of female genitalia. Additionally, the money cowrie was almost impossible to counterfeit until the late 19th Century. After the 1500s, however, the shell&#x27;s use as currency became even more common. Western nations, chiefly through the slave trade, introduced huge numbers of Maldivian cowries in Africa. The Ghanaian cedi was named after cowrie shells. Starting over three thousand years ago, cowrie shells, or copies of the shells, were used as Chinese currency. They were also used as means of exchange in India.

The Classical Chinese character for &quot;money&quot; () originated as a stylized drawing of a Maldivian cowrie shell. Words and characters concerning money, property or wealth usually have this as a radical. Before the Spring and Autumn period the cowrie was used as a type of trade token awarding access to a feudal lord&#x27;s resources to a worthy vassal.

===Ritual use===
The Ojibwe aboriginal people in North America use cowrie shells which are called sacred miigis shells or whiteshells in Midewiwin ceremonies, and the Whiteshell Provincial Park in Manitoba, Canada is named after this type of shell. There is some debate about how the Ojibway traded for or found these shells, so far inland and so far north, very distant from the natural habitat. Oral stories and birch bark scrolls seem to indicate that the shells were found in the ground, or washed up on the shores of lakes or rivers. Finding the cowrie shells so far inland could indicate the previous use of them by an earlier tribe or group in the area, who may have obtained them through an extensive trade network in the ancient past.

In Eastern India, particularly in West Bengal, it is given as a token price for the ferry ride of the departed soul to cross the river &quot;Vaitarani&quot;. Cowries are used during cremation. Cowries are also used in the worship of Goddess Laxmi.

In Brazil, as a result of the Atlantic slave trade from Africa, cowrie shells (called &quot;búzios&quot;) are also used to consult the Orixás divinities and hear their replies.

Cowrie shells were among the devices used for divination by the Kaniyar Panicker astrologers of Kerala, India.

In certain parts of Africa, cowries were prized charms, and they were said to be associated with fecundity, sexual pleasure and good luck. It is also used in the treatment of certain diseases such as rashes and ringworm when it is burnt into ashes.

In Pre-dynastic Egypt and Neolithic Southern Levant, cowrie shells were placed in the graves of young girls. The modified Levantine cowries were discovered ritually arranged around the skull in female burials. During the Bronze Age, cowries became more common as funerary goods, also associated with burials of women and children. The cowroid was an Egyptian seal-amulet imitating the cowrie shell. Their imitations in stone or faience appear in the early 2nd millennium B.C.

===Jewelry===

Cowrie shells are also worn as jewelry or otherwise used as ornaments or charms. In Mende culture, cowrie shells are viewed as symbols of womanhood, fertility, birth and wealth. Its underside is supposed, by one modern ethnographic author, to represent a vulva or an eye.

On the Fiji Islands, a shell of the golden cowrie or bulikula, &quot;Cypraea aurantium&quot;, was drilled at the ends and worn on a string around the neck by chieftains as a badge of rank. The women of Tuvalu use cowrie and other shells in traditional handicrafts.

===Games and gambling===
Cowrie shells are sometimes used in a way similar to dice, e.g., in board games like Pachisi, Ashta Chamma or in divination (cf. Ifá and the annual customs of Dahomey of Benin). A number of shells (6 or 7 in Pachisi) are thrown, with those landing aperture upwards indicating the actual number rolled.

In Nepal cowries are used for a gambling game, where 16 pieces of cowries are tossed by four different bettors (and sub-bettors under them). This game is usually played at homes and in public during the Hindu festival of Tihar or Deepawali. In the same festival these shells are also worshiped as a symbol of Goddess Lakshmi and wealth.

===Other===
Large cowrie shells such as that of a &quot;Cypraea tigris&quot; have been used in Europe in the recent past as a darning egg over which sock heels were stretched. The cowrie&#x27;s smooth surface allows the needle to be positioned under the cloth more easily. 

In the 1940s and 1950s, small cowry shells were used as a teaching aid in infant schools e.g counting, adding, subtracting.

<doc id="312030" wikidata="Q16317" url="?curid=312030" title="Occipital bone">
<text>The occipital bone () is a cranial dermal bone and the main bone of the occiput (back and lower part of the skull). It is trapezoidal in shape and curved on itself like a shallow dish. The occipital bone overlies the occipital lobes of the cerebrum. At the base of the skull in the occipital bone, there is a large oval opening called the foramen magnum, which allows the passage of the spinal cord.

Like the other cranial bones, it is classed as a flat bone. Due to its many attachments and features, the occipital bone is described in terms of separate parts. From its front to the back is the basilar part, also called the basioccipital, at the sides of the foramen magnum are the lateral parts, also called the exoccipitals, and the back is named as the squamous part. The basilar part is a thick, somewhat quadrilateral piece in front of the foramen magnum and directed towards the pharynx. The squamous part is the curved, expanded plate behind the foramen magnum and is the largest part of the occipital bone.

Due to its embryonic derivation from paraxial mesoderm (as opposed to neural crest, from which many other craniofacial bones are derived), it has been posited that &quot;the occipital bone as a whole could be considered as a giant vertebra enlarged to support the brain.&quot;

==Structure==
The occipital bone, like the other seven cranial bones, has outer and inner layers (also called &quot;plates&quot; or &quot;tables&quot;) of cortical bone tissue between which is the cancellous bone tissue known in the cranial bones as diploë. The bone is especially thick at the ridges, protuberances, condyles, and anterior part of the basilar part; in the inferior cerebellar fossae it is thin, semitransparent, and without diploë.

===Outer surface===

Near the middle of the outer surface of the squamous part of the occipital (the largest part) there is a prominence – the external occipital protuberance. The highest point of this is called the inion.

From the inion, along the midline of the squamous part until the foramen magnum, runs a ridge – the external occipital crest (also called the medial nuchal line) and this gives attachment to the nuchal ligament.

Running across the outside of the occipital bone are three curved lines and one line (the medial line) that runs down to the foramen magnum. These are known as the nuchal lines which give attachment to various ligaments and muscles. They are named as the &quot;highest&quot;, &quot;superior&quot; and &quot;inferior&quot; nuchal lines. The inferior nuchal line runs across the midpoint of the &quot;median&quot; nuchal line. The area above the highest nuchal line is termed the occipital plane and the area below this line is termed the nuchal plane.


===Inner surface===

The inner surface of the occipital bone forms the base of the posterior cranial fossa. The foramen magnum is a large hole situated in the middle, with the clivus, a smooth part of the occipital bone travelling upwards in front of it. The median internal occipital crest travels behind it to the internal occipital protuberance, and serves as a point of attachment to the falx cerebri.

To the sides of the foramen sitting at the junction between the lateral and base of the occipital bone are the hypoglossal canals. Further out, at each junction between the occipital and petrous portion of the temporal bone lies a jugular foramen.

The inner surface of the occipital bone is marked by dividing lines as shallow ridges, that form four fossae or depressions. The lines are called the cruciform (cross-shaped) eminence.

At the midpoint where the lines intersect a raised part is formed called the internal occipital protuberance. From each side of this eminence runs a groove for the transverse sinuses.

There are two midline skull landmarks at the foramen magnum. The basion is the most anterior point of the opening and the opisthion is the point on the opposite posterior part. The basion lines up with the dens.

=== Foramen magnum ===

The foramen magnum () is a large oval foramen longest front to back; it is wider behind than in front where it is encroached upon by the occipital condyles. The clivus, a smooth bony section, travels upwards on the front surface of the foramen, and the median internal occipital crest travels behind it.

Through the foramen passes the medulla oblongata and its membranes, the accessory nerves, the vertebral arteries, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, the tectorial membrane and the alar ligaments.

=== Angles ===
The superior angle of the occipital bone articulates with the occipital angles of the parietal bones and, in the fetal skull, corresponds in position with the posterior fontanelle.

The lateral angles are situated at the extremities of the groove for the transverse sinuses: each is received into the interval between the mastoid angle of the parietal bone, and the mastoid portion of the temporal bone.

The inferior angle is fused with the body of the sphenoid bone.

=== Borders ===
The superior borders extend from the superior to the lateral angles: they are deeply serrated for articulation with the occipital borders of the parietals, and form by this union the lambdoidal suture.

The inferior borders extend from the lateral angles to the inferior angle; the upper half of each articulates with the mastoid portion of the corresponding temporal, the lower half with the petrous part of the same bone.

These two portions of the inferior border are separated from one another by the jugular process, the notch on the anterior surface of which forms the posterior part of the jugular foramen.

===Sutures===
The lambdoid suture joins the occipital bone to the parietal bones.

The occipitomastoid suture joins the occipital bone and mastoid portion of the temporal bone.
The sphenobasilar suture joins the basilar part of the occipital bone and the back of the sphenoid bone body.

The petrous-basilar suture joins the side edge of the basilar part of the occipital bone to the petrous-part of the temporal bone.

==Development==

The occipital plane [Fig. 3] of the squamous part of the occipital bone is developed in membrane, and may remain separate throughout life when it constitutes the interparietal bone; the rest of the bone is developed in cartilage.

The number of nuclei for the occipital plane is usually given as four, two appearing near the middle line about the second month, and two some little distance from the middle line about the third month of fetal life.

The nuchal plane of the squamous part is ossified from two centers, which appear about the seventh week of fetal life and soon unite to form a single piece.

Union of the upper and lower portions of the squamous part takes place in the third month of fetal life.

An occasional centre (Kerckring) appears in the posterior margin of the foramen magnum during the fifth month; this forms a separate ossicle (sometimes double) which unites with the rest of the squamous part before birth.

Each of the lateral parts begins to ossify from a single center during the eighth week of fetal life. The basilar portion is ossified from two centers, one in front of the other; these appear about the sixth week of fetal life and rapidly coalesce.

The occipital plane is said to be ossified from two centers and the basilar portion from one.

About the fourth year the squamous part and the two lateral parts unite, and by about the sixth year the bone consists of a single piece. Between the 18th and 25th years the occipital and sphenoid bone become united, forming a single bone.

==Clinical significance==
Trauma to the occiput can cause a fracture of the base of the skull, called a basilar skull fracture. The &quot;basion-dens line&quot; as seen on a radiograph is the distance between the basion and the top of the dens, used in the diagnosis of dissociation injuries.

Genetic disorders can cause a prominent occiput as found in Edwards syndrome, and Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome.

The identification of the location of the fetal occiput is important in delivery.

==Etymology==
Occipital stems from Latin occiput &quot;back of the skull&quot;, from ob &quot;against, behind&quot; + caput &quot;head&quot;. Distinguished from sinciput (anterior part of the skull).

==Other animals==
In many animals these parts stay separate throughout life; for example, in the dog as four parts: squamous part (supraoccipital); lateral parts–left and right parts (exoccipital); basilar part (basioccipital).

The occipital bone is part of the endocranium, the most basal portion of the skull. In Chondrichthyes and Agnatha, the occipital does not form as a separate element, but remains part of the chondrocranium throughout life. In most higher vertebrates, the foramen magnum is surrounded by a ring of four bones.

The basioccipital lies in front of the opening, the two exoccipital condyles lie to either side, and the larger supraoccipital lies to the posterior, and forms at least part of the rear of the cranium. In many bony fish and amphibians, the supraoccipital is never ossified, and remains as cartilage throughout life. In primitive forms the basioccipital and exoccipitals somewhat resemble the centrum and neural arches of a vertebra, and form in a similar manner in the embryo. Together, these latter bones usually form a single concave circular condyle for the articulation of the first vertebra.

In mammals, however, the condyle has divided in two, a pattern otherwise seen only in a few amphibians.

Most mammals also have a single fused occipital bone, formed from the four separate elements around the foramen magnum, along with the paired postparietal bones that form the rear of the cranial roof in other vertebrates.

<text>Kṣitigarbha (, , Wylie: &quot;sa yi snying po&quot;) is a bodhisattva primarily revered in East Asian Buddhism and usually depicted as a Buddhist monk. His name may be translated as &quot;Earth Treasury&quot;, &quot;Earth Store&quot;, &quot;Earth Matrix&quot;, or &quot;Earth Womb&quot;. Kṣitigarbha is known for his vow to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the six worlds between the death of Gautama Buddha and the rise of Maitreya, as well as his vow not to achieve Buddhahood until all hells are emptied. He is therefore often regarded as the bodhisattva of hell-beings, as well as the guardian of children and patron deity of deceased children and aborted fetuses in Japanese culture.

Usually depicted as a monk with a halo around his shaved head, he carries a staff to force open the gates of hell and a wish-fulfilling jewel to light up the darkness.

== Overview ==

Kṣitigarbha is one of the four principal bodhisattvas along with Samantabhadra, Manjusri, and Avalokiteśvara (Guanyin) in East Asian Mahayana Buddhism.

At the pre-Tang dynasty grottos in Dunhuang and Longmen, he is depicted in a classical bodhisattva form. After the Tang, he became increasingly depicted as a monk carrying Buddhist prayer beads and a staff.

His full name in Chinese is &quot;Dayuan Dizang Pusa&quot; (), or &quot;Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva of the Great Vow,&quot; pronounced &quot;Daigan Jizō Bosatsu&quot; in Japanese, &quot;Jijang Bosal&quot; in Korean, &quot;Đại Nguyện Địa Tạng Vương Bồ Tát&quot; in Vietnamese. This name is a reference to his pledge, as recorded in the sutras, to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the six worlds in the era between the parinirvana of the Buddha and the rise of Maitreya. Because of this important role, shrines to Kṣitigarbha often occupy a central role in temples, especially within the memorial halls or mausoleums.

== Historical role ==
People were afraid of the period that is known as &quot;mappō&quot;, the decline and disappearance of Dharma, which was propagated by Pure Land Buddhism as a period in which it is impossible to understand the original Buddhist teachings anymore and attain enlightenment through traditional means. This foundation supported the role among people of Kṣitigarbha as he helped those who were in danger of falling into hell realm in hearing their confessions and to ensure their salvation.

One of the widespread practices of Kṣitigarbha-worship in Japan was the citation and copying of the Lotus Sutra as it promised benefits in the present and future. Kṣitigarbha satisfied those immediate needs and the mundane wishes of worshippers to the extent of delivering them to the Pure Land of Amida in the times of declining Dharma.

== Sources ==

=== As a Brahmin maiden ===
The story of Kṣitigarbha was first described in the &quot;Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Pūrvapraṇidhāna Sūtra&quot;, a popular Mahayana sutras. This sutra is said to have been spoken by the Buddha towards the end of his life to the beings of the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven as a mark of gratitude and remembrance for his beloved mother, Maya. The &quot;Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Pūrvapraṇidhāna Sūtra&quot; begins, &quot;Thus have I heard. Once the Buddha was abiding in Trayastrimsas Heaven in order to expound the Dharma to his mother.&quot;

The &quot;Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Pūrvapraṇidhāna Sūtra&quot; was first translated from Sanskrit into Chinese between 695 and 700 CE, during the Tang dynasty, by the Tripiṭaka master Śikṣānanda, a Buddhist monk from Khotan who also provided a new translation of the &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;. However, some scholars have suspected that instead of being translated, this text may have originated in China, since no Sanskrit manuscripts of this text have been found. Part of the reason for suspicion is that the text advocates filial piety, which was stereotypically associated with Chinese culture. It stated that Kṣitigarbha practised filial piety as a mortal, which eventually led to making great vows to save all sentient beings. Since then, other scholars such as Gregory Schopen have pointed out that Indian Buddhism also had traditions of filial piety. Currently there is no definitive evidence indicating either an Indian or Chinese origin for the text.

In the &quot;Kṣitigarbha Sūtra&quot;, the Buddha states that in the distant past eons, Kṣitigarbha was a maiden of the Brahmin caste by the name of &quot;Sacred Girl&quot;. This maiden was deeply troubled upon the death of her mother - who had often been slanderous towards the Three Jewels. To save her mother from the great tortures of hell, the girl sold whatever she had and used the money to buy offerings that she offered daily to the Buddha of her time, known as the Buddha of the Flower of Meditation and Enlightenment. She prayed fervently that her mother be spared the pains of hell and appealed to the Buddha for help.

While she was pleading for help at the temple, she heard the Buddha telling her to go home, sit down, and recite his name if she wanted to know where her mother was. She did as she was told and her consciousness was transported to a Hell realm, where she met a guardian who informed her that through her fervent prayers and pious offerings, her mother had accumulated much merit and had already ascended to heaven. &quot;Sacred Girl&quot; was greatly relieved and would have been extremely happy, but the sight of the suffering she had seen in Hell touched her heart. She vowed to do her best to relieve beings of their suffering in her future lives for kalpas.

=== As a Buddhist monk ===
There is a legend about how Kṣitigarbha manifested himself in China and chose his bodhimaṇḍa to be Mount Jiuhua, one of the Four Sacred Mountains of China.

During the reign of Emperor Ming of Han, Buddhism started to flourish, reaching its peak in the Tang and eventually spreading to Korea. At the time, monks and scholars arrived from those countries to seek the dharma in China. One of these pilgrims was a former prince from Silla named Kim Gyo-gak, who became a monk under the Chinese name Dizang &quot;Kṣitigarbha,&quot; pronounced &quot;Jijang&quot; in Korean. He went to Mount Jiuhua in present-day Anhui. After ascending, he decided to build a hut in a deep mountain area so that he could cultivate the dharma.

According to records, Jijang was bitten by a venomous snake but he did not move, thus letting the snake go. A woman happened to pass by and gave the monk medicines to cure him of the venom, as well as a spring on her son&#x27;s behalf. For a few years, Jijang continued to meditate in his hut, until one day, a scholar named Chu-Ke led a group of friends and family to visit the mountain. Noticing the monk meditating in the hut, they went and took a look at his condition. They had noticed that his bowl did not contain any food, and that his hair had grown back.

Taking pity on the monk, Chu-Ke decided to build a temple as an offering to him. The whole group descended the mountain immediately to discuss plans to build the temple. Mount Jiuhua was also property of a wealthy person called Elder Wen-Ke, who obliged to build a temple on his mountain. Therefore, Wen-Ke and the group ascended the mountain once more and asked Jijang how much land he needed.

Jijang replied that he needed a piece of land that could be covered fully by his kasaya. Initially believing that a piece of sash could not provide enough land to build a temple, they were surprised when Jijang threw the kasaya in the air, and the robe expanded in size, covering the entire mountain. Elder Wen-Ke had then decided to renounce the entire mountain to Jijang, and became his protector. Sometime later, Wen-Ke&#x27;s son also left secular life to become a monk.

Jijang lived in Mount Jiuhua for 75 years before passing away at the age of 99. Three years after his nirvana, his tomb was opened, only to reveal that the body had not decayed. Because Jijang led his wayplace with much difficulty, most people had the intuition to believe that he was indeed an incarnation of Kṣitigarbha.

Jijang&#x27;s well-preserved, dehydrated body may still be viewed today at the monastery he built on Mount Jiuhua.

== Iconography ==
=== Traditional iconography ===
In Buddhist iconography, Kṣitigarbha is typically depicted with a shaven head, dressed in a monk&#x27;s simple robes (unlike most other bodhisattvas, who are dressed like Indian royalty).

In his left hand, Kṣitigarbha holds a tear-shaped jewel or cintamani () in his right hand, he holds a Khakkhara (), which is used to alert insects and small animals of his approach, so that he will not accidentally harm them. This staff is traditionally carried by Buddhist monks. Like other bodhisattvas, Kṣitigarbha usually is seen standing on a lotus base, symbolizing his release from rebirth. Kṣitigarbha&#x27;s face and head are also idealised, featuring the third eye, elongated ears and the other standard attributes of a buddha.

In the Chinese tradition, Kṣitigarbha is sometimes depicted wearing a crown like the one worn by Vairocana. His image is similar to that of the fictional character Tang Sanzang from the classical novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, so observers sometimes mistake Kṣitigarbha for the latter. In China, Kṣitigarbha is also sometimes accompanied by a dog. This is in reference to a legend that he found his mother reborn in the animal realm as a dog named Diting, which the Bodhisattva adopted to serve as his steed and guard.

In Japan, Kṣitigarbha&#x27;s statues are often adorned with bibs, kerchiefs or kasa hat on his head, and sometimes dressed with a haori. Tōsen-ji in Katsushika, Tokyo, contains the &quot;Bound Kṣitigarbha&quot; of Ōoka Tadasuke fame, dating from the Edo period. When petitions are requested before Kṣitigarbha, the petitioner ties a rope about the statue. When the wish is granted, the petitioner unties the rope. At the new year, the ropes of the ungranted wishes are cut by the temple priest.

=== Kṣitigarbha as Lord of the Six Ways ===

Another category of iconographic depiction is Kṣitigarbha as the Lord of the Six Ways, an allegorical representation of the Six Paths of Rebirth of the Desire realm (rebirth into hell, or as pretas, animals, asuras, men, and devas). The Six Paths are often depicted as six rays or beams radiating from the bodhisattva and accompanied by figurative representations of the Six Paths. Many of these depictions in China can be found in Shaanxi province, perhaps a result of Sanjiejiao teachings in the area.

A Japanese variation of this depiction is the Six Kṣitigarbhas, six full sculptural manifestations of the bodhisattva. An example of this can be found in Konjikidō, the ‘Hall of Gold,’ in the Chūson-ji temple.

==In Buddhist traditions==

=== Chinese traditions ===

Mount Jiuhua in Anhui is regarded as Kṣitigarbha&#x27;s bodhimaṇḍa. It is one of the Four Sacred Buddhism Mountains in China, and at one time housed more than 300 temples. Today, 95 of these are open to the public. The mountain is a popular destination for pilgrims offering dedications to Kṣitigarbha. In certain Chinese Buddhist legends, the arhat Maudgalyayana, known in Chinese as &quot;Mùlián&quot; (目連), acts as an assistant to Ksitigarbha in his vow to save the denizens of hell. As a result, Mùlián is usually also venerated in temples that enshrine Ksitigarbha. In folk beliefs, the mount of Ksitigarbha, Diting, is a divine beast that can distinguish good from evil, virtuous and foolish. In iconographic form, it is often enshrined at the side of Ksitigarbha, or portrayed with Ksitigarbha riding on its back as a mount.

In some areas, the admixture of traditional religions has led to Kṣitigarbha being also regarded as a deity in Taoism and Chinese folk religion. Kṣitigarbha Temples () are Taoist temples that usually enshrine Kṣitigarbha as the main deity, along with other gods typically related to the Chinese netherworld Diyu, such as Yanluo Wang and Heibai Wuchang. Believers usually visit these temples to pray for the blessings of the ancestors and the souls of the dead. The 30th day of the seventh month of the Chinese calendar is celebrated as his birthday.

=== Japanese traditions ===
In Japan, Kṣitigarbha, known as &quot;Jizō&quot;, or respectfully as &quot;Ojizō-sama&quot;, is one of the most loved of all Japanese divinities. His statues are a common sight, especially by roadsides and in graveyards.

According to legend, the first Jizō-statue was introduced in Japan in the reign of emperor Shōmu in the Nara period. However, while records exist that indicate a Jizō-statue in the Tōdai-ji, the existence of these statues in former times is probable but no evidence has yet been discovered.

In the Heian-period the influences of Jizō worship become clearer as the Konjaku Monogatari dedicates many tales to him and an own collection of his tales, &quot;Jizō Bosatsu Reigenki,&quot; was written. The latter contains twenty-five stories which focus on the miracles performed by Jizō. The devotees described in these stories recite the Lotus Sutra, a trait not often found in Chinese worship, that seem to characterise Jizō worship.

==== Ryōki ====
In the Ryōki (ca. 822 CE), the earliest found collection of setsuwa, a story with Fujiwara Hirotari is included. He died and caught sight of his wife suffering in the Land After Death, with the aid of Jizō he returned to life and lifted the suffering of his wife through copying the Lotus Sutra as suggested by Jizō. This story characterises traits of Jizō such as his benevolence towards those caught in the grasps of naraka (hell), the lowest realm of the six paths, and the practice of copying sutras to help them.

==== Children&#x27;s limbo legend ====
In the common tradition associated with the or the banks of the Sanzu River, Kṣitigarbha is portrayed as the protector of the souls of children, who are condemned to stack piles of stones vainly, for these towers are repeatedly toppled. In a later version such as the one recorded by Lafcadio Hearn, the oni demons wreck the stone piles, and torment the children, and the children seek haven with Kṣitigarbha who hides them inside his garment and comforts them. In an earlier version, found written in the , c. 1600 or earlier when the dead children pile stones at the Sai no Kawara (&quot;Children’s Riverbed Hell&quot;), winds and flames are the agents knocking down the stone tower, and the flame reduce the children into cremated bones, to be revived back to whole by the Jizō Bodhisattva (or by demons).

This concept of Sai no Kawara, or children&#x27;s limbo, first appeared in the &quot;Otogizōshi&quot; of the Muromachi Period, and in fact, the &quot;Tale of the Fuji Cave&quot; related above is one such work from the Otogizōshi. As such, the notion was developed quite late, in the post-medieval era, although it has been associated with the priest Kūya (10th century). The Kṣitigarbha and the Sai no Kawara legend was connected with the Kūya and his &quot;wasan&quot;, or chantings probably some time in the 17th century, creating the &quot;Jizō wasan&quot;. Also, as to the identification of certain geographic features as Sai no Kawara on Osorezan mountain in northern Japan, the establishment of the Kṣitigarbha cult there is of late-Tokugawa Period vintage, early to mid 18th century, despite temple pamphlets (&quot;engi&quot;, or account of the founding of temples) purporting origins dating back to the 9th century, with the priest Ennin alleged to have established the place of worship for the Kṣitigarbha at Mt. Osore (in olden times styled &quot;Mount Usori&quot;).

==== Lost pregnancies ====
Kṣitigarbha has been worshipped as the guardian of the souls of &quot;mizuko&quot;, the souls of stillborn, miscarried, or aborted fetuses in the ritual of .

==== Offerings ====

Kṣitigarbha statues are sometimes accompanied by a little pile of stones and pebbles, put there by people in the hope that it would shorten the time children have to suffer in the underworld. (The act is derived from the tradition of building stupas as an act of merit-making.)
Traditionally, he is seen as the guardian of children, and in particular, children who died before their parents. The statues can sometimes be seen wearing tiny children&#x27;s clothing or bibs, or with toys, put there by grieving parents to help their lost ones and hoping that Kṣitigarbha would specially protect them. Sometimes the offerings are put there by parents to thank Kṣitigarbha for saving their children from a serious illness. His features are commonly made more baby-like to resemble the children he protects.

==== Roadside god ====
As Kṣitigarbha is seen as the saviour of beings who have to suffer in the underworld, his statues are common in cemeteries. He is also believed to be one of the protective deities of travellers, the &quot;dōsojin&quot;, and roadside statues of Kṣitigarbha are a common sight in Japan. Firefighters are also believed to be under his protection.


=== Southeast Asian traditions ===
In Theravada Buddhism, the story of a bhikkhu named Phra Malai with similar qualities to Kṣitigarbha is well known throughout Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand and Laos. Legend has it that he was an arhat from Sri Lanka who achieved great supernatural powers through his own merit and meditation. He is also honoured as a successor to Mahāmoggallāna, the Buddha&#x27;s disciple foremost for his supernatural attainments. In the story, this pious and compassionate monk descends to Hell to give teachings and comfort the suffering hell-beings there. He also learns how the hell-beings are punished according to their sins in the different hells.

== Mantra ==

In mainstream Chinese Buddhism and Japanese Shingon Buddhism, the mantra of Kṣitigarbha comes from the &quot;Treasury of Mantras&quot; section of the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot;. The effect of this mantra is producing the &quot;Samadhi Realm of Adamantine Indestructible Conduct.&quot; This mantra is the following:

<text>The Birmingham Six were six men from Northern Ireland who were each sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975 following their false convictions for the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings. Their convictions were declared unsafe and unsatisfactory and quashed by the Court of Appeal on 14 March 1991. The six men were later awarded financial compensation ranging from £840,000 to £1.2 million.

==Birmingham pub bombings==
The Birmingham pub bombings took place on 21 November 1974 and were attributed to the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). Improvised explosive devices were placed in two central Birmingham pubs: the Mulberry Bush at the foot of the Rotunda, and the Tavern in the Town – a basement pub in New Street. The resulting explosions, at 20:25 and 20:27, collectively were the deadliest attacks in the UK since World War II (until surpassed by the Denmark Place fire in 1980); 21 people were killed (ten at the Mulberry Bush and eleven at the Tavern in the Town) and 182 people were injured.

===Arrests and questioning===
Six men were arrested: Hugh Callaghan (1930–2023), Patrick Joseph Hill (1944–2024), Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny (1933–2006), William Power and John Walker. Five were Belfast-born, while John Walker was born in Derry. All six had lived in Birmingham since the 1960s. All the men except for Callaghan had left the city early on the evening of 21 November from New Street Station, shortly before the explosions. They were travelling to Belfast to attend the funeral of James McDade, an IRA member whom they all knew. McDade had accidentally killed himself on 14 November when his bomb detonated prematurely while he was planting it at a telephone exchange in Coventry. 

When they reached Heysham, Lancashire, they and others were subject to a Special Branch stop and search. The men did not tell the police of the true purpose of their visit to Belfast, a fact that was later held against them. While the search was in progress the police were informed of the Birmingham bombings. The men agreed to be taken to Morecambe, Lancashire, police station for forensic tests. On the morning of 22 November, after the forensic tests and questioning by the Morecambe police, the men were transferred to the custody of West Midlands Serious Crime Squad police unit. Callaghan was taken into custody on the evening of 22 November.

While the men were in the custody of the West Midlands Police they were allegedly deprived of food and sleep and were sometimes interrogated for as much as 12 hours without a break. Threats were made against them and they suffered abuse: punches, dogs being let loose within a foot of them, and a mock execution. William Power said that officers from Birmingham police Criminal Investigation Department assaulted him. Richard McIlkenny&#x27;s daughter said, &quot;When they (the family) saw him the next day, he had been so badly beaten he was unrecognisable&quot;.

Power confessed while in Morecambe while Callaghan, Walker and McIlkenny confessed at Queens Road in Aston, Birmingham.

===Trial===
On 12 May 1975, the six men were charged with murder. Three other men, James Kelly, Mick Murray and Michael Sheehan, were charged with conspiracy.

The trial began on 9 June 1975 at the Crown Court sitting at Lancaster Castle, before Mr Justice Bridge and a jury. After legal arguments the statements made in November were deemed admissible as evidence. The unreliability of these statements was later established. Thomas Watt provided circumstantial evidence about John Walker&#x27;s association with Provisional IRA members.

Forensic scientist Frank Skuse used positive Griess test results to claim that Hill and Power had handled explosives. Callaghan, Hunter, McIlkenny and Walker all had tested negative. GCMS tests at a later date were negative for Power and contradicted the initial results for Hill. Skuse&#x27;s claim that he was 99% certain that Power and Hill had explosives traces on their hands was opposed by defence expert Hugh Kenneth Black of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the former HM Chief Inspector of Explosives, Home Office. Skuse&#x27;s evidence was clearly preferred by Bridge. The jury found the six men guilty of murder. On 15 August 1975, they were each sentenced to 21 life sentences.

===Criminal charges against prison officers and civil actions against police===
On 28 November 1975, the men appeared in court for the second time after they had been remanded into custody at HM Prison Winson Green. All showed bruising and other signs of ill-treatment. Fourteen prison officers were charged with assault in June 1975, but were all acquitted at a trial presided over by Mr. Justice Swanwick. The Six brought a civil claim for damages against the West Midlands Police in 1977, which was struck out on 17 January 1980 by the Court of Appeal (Civil Division), constituted by the Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning, Goff LJ and Sir George Baker, under the principle of estoppel.

===Appeals===
In March 1976 their first application for leave to appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, presided over by Lord Widgery CJ. Journalist Chris Mullin investigated the case for Granada TV&#x27;s &quot;World in Action&quot; series. In 1985, the first of several &quot;World in Action&quot; programmes casting doubt on the men&#x27;s convictions was broadcast. In 1986, Mullin&#x27;s book, &quot;Error of Judgment: The Truth About the Birmingham Pub Bombings&quot;, set out a detailed case supporting the men&#x27;s claims that they were innocent. It included his claim to have met the four men who were actually responsible for the bombings.

The Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, referred the case back to the Court of Appeal. In January 1988, after a six-week hearing (at that time the longest criminal appeal hearing ever held), the convictions were ruled to be safe and satisfactory. The Court of Appeal, presided over by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Lane, dismissed the appeals. Over the next three years, newspaper articles, television documentaries and books brought forward new evidence to question the safety of the convictions.

Their second full appeal, in 1991, was allowed. Hunter was represented by Lord Gifford QC, the others by Michael Mansfield QC. The Crown decided not to resist the appeals on the basis of new evidence of police fabrication and suppression of evidence, the successful attacks on both the confessions, and the 1975 forensic evidence. The Court of Appeal, constituted by Lord Justices Lloyd, Mustill and Farquharson, stated that &quot;in the light of the fresh scientific evidence, which at least throws grave doubt on Skuse&#x27;s evidence, if it does not destroy it altogether, these convictions are both unsafe and unsatisfactory.&quot; On 14 March 1991 the six walked free.

In 2001, a decade after their release, the six men were awarded compensation ranging from £840,000 to £1.2 million.

===Later lives and deaths===
Richard McIlkenny died of cancer on 21 May 2006, aged 73. He had returned to Ireland shortly after he was freed from prison and died in hospital with his family at his bedside. He was buried on 24 May in Celbridge, County Kildare. The other members of the Birmingham Six were present at his wake and funeral.

Hugh Callaghan died on 27 May 2023, aged 93.

Patrick Hill died in his home in Ayrshire, on 30 December 2024, aged 80.

As of 2011, of the three surviving members of the Birmingham Six, Gerard Hunter resided in Portugal, John Walker in Donegal and William Power in London.

===Consequences===
The success of the appeals and other miscarriages of justice caused the Home Secretary to set up a Royal Commission on Criminal Justice in 1991. The commission reported in 1993 and led to the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 which established the Criminal Cases Review Commission in 1997. Superintendent George Reade and two other police officers were charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice but were never prosecuted. During the inquest into the bombings in 2016, Hill stated that he knew the identities of three of the bombers who were still &quot;free men&quot; in Ireland.

==Granada Television productions==
On 28 March 1990, ITV broadcast the Granada Television docudrama, &quot;Who Bombed Birmingham?&quot;, which re-enacted the bombings and subsequent key events in Chris Mullin&#x27;s campaign. Written by Rob Ritchie and directed by Mike Beckham, it starred John Hurt as Mullin, Martin Shaw as &quot;World in Action&quot; producer Ian McBride, Ciarán Hinds as Richard McIlkenny, one of the Six, and Patrick Malahide as Michael Mansfield (QC). It was repackaged for export as &quot;The Investigation – Inside a Terrorist Bombing&quot;, and first shown on American television on 22 April 1990. Granada&#x27;s BAFTA-nominated follow-up documentary after the release of the six men, &quot;World in Action Special: The Birmingham Six – Their Own Story&quot;, was telecast on 18 March 1991. It was released on DVD in 2007 in Network&#x27;s first volume of &quot;World in Action&quot; productions.

In 1994, Frank Skuse brought libel proceedings against Granada, contending that &quot;World in Action&quot; had falsely portrayed him as negligent. His counsel asserted in the High Court that scientific tests performed in 1992, after the Crown&#x27;s substantive concession of the accused men&#x27;s third appeal, showed that traces of nitroglycerine were detected on swabs taken after the bombings from the hands of Hunter and Hill, and on rail tickets handled by McIlkenny and Power. Granada maintained there were never any traces of explosives on the six men. Skuse abandoned the action later that year.

==Freedom of speech==
In December 1987, the Court of Appeal granted an injunction which prevented Channel 4 from re-enacting portions of a hearing in the litigation, as it was &quot;likely to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice&quot; if shown during the appeal, in violation of the Contempt of Court Act 1981. In their book &quot;The Three Pillars of Liberty&quot; (1996) Keir Starmer, Francesca Klug, and Stuart Weir said the decision had had a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on other news and current affairs programmes.

In January 1988 after their first appeal failed, &quot;The Sun&quot; published an article with the headline &quot;Loony MP Backs Bomb Gang&quot; (a reference to Mullin, who had won a seat in 1987) and an editorial said, &quot;If &quot;The Sun&quot; had its way, we would have been tempted to string &#x27;em up years ago&quot;.

In 1993 and 1994, the Birmingham Six received an undisclosed amount from both &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot; in an action for libel for the newspapers&#x27; reporting of police statements. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 1997 that the Six had brought libel actions against publications for reporting slurs against them, and that a libel law that usually favours plaintiffs was sending a chill through the British press. They sued the Conservative MP David Evans in March 1997 for saying that they were guilty of killing hundreds of people before they were caught. Evans apologised 16 months later. He paid both damages and costs and promised never to repeat the allegation.

===Attempt to force journalist to reveal sources===
During his investigation, which proved crucial in establishing the innocence of the Six, Mullin located one of the actual bombers and persuaded him to provide information which helped the men falsely convicted. Mullin promised that he would never reveal his source. At the time the police were not interested, as they believed that they had already arrested the culprits.

However, in 2018 the West Midlands police reopened the investigation, almost 50 years after the event. In 2019 a witness at the inquest testified that the real bombers were Mick Murray, James Francis Gavin, Seamus McLoughlin and Michael Hayes. Mullin confirmed that Murray, Gavin and Hayes were three of the four bombers he had revealed in his book, but he refused to identify the fourth bomber who he called the &quot;young Planter&quot; who was still alive. Mullin cooperated with the investigation as far as he felt was possible, for example providing notes of interviews with Murray and a redacted copy of notes of other interviews. But Mullin refused to name other people interviewed. The West Midlands police applied for an order under the Terrorism Act 2000 to compel Mullin to reveal his sources; he refused, later saying that source protection is a cornerstone of the free press in a democracy. 

In March 2022 Judge Lucraft ruled that it was not in the public interest to oblige Mullin to identify the living perpetrator. Mullin&#x27;s legal team later said, hailing the ruling, that the right of a journalist to protect their sources was fundamental to a free press in a democracy.

<text>The Saab 9000 is an automobile produced by the Swedish company Saab from 1984 to 1998. Representing the company&#x27;s foray into the executive car scene, it was developed as a result of the successes of the turbocharged 99 and 900 models. The 9000 remained in production until May 1998 and was replaced by the 9-5 in late 1997, although some final cars were produced into 1998. The Saab 9000 was only available with petrol engines, in two different 5-door hatchback designs or as a 4-door notchback.

==Introduction==
Saab designed the 9000 as part of its joint development Type Four platform in conjunction with the Italian automaker Fiat Automobiles. Fiat developed and sold its own derivative versions from the platform as the more basic Fiat Croma, the luxury-themed Lancia Thema, and the sports-oriented Alfa Romeo 164. Unlike the 164, which shares only the chassis, the Croma and Thema are outwardly similar to the 9000. As such, much of the bodywork appeared interchangeable between the 9000, Croma and Thema; for example, the doors. However, because Saab fitted heavier side impact protection and made other changes to the design, none of the components could be interchanged between the cars. Fiat had designed the Croma with no consideration of American crash test requirements, which forced Saab to strengthen the body by fitting various reinforcements. Thus, the front of the Saab is radically different from the Italian siblings due to the much improved crash protection. Only seven parts are actually interchangeable. Additionally, where the other Type Four cars used independent MacPherson struts all round, the 9000 used them only on the front suspension, with its rear suspension instead using a beam axle. The 9000 was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro and Saab&#x27;s in-house designer Björn Envall.

Despite being shorter overall than the 900 which was still produced in parallel, the 9000 has a longer wheelbase and greater interior space with of interior space, in the boot and with rear seats folded). Qualifying as an EPA-rated large car, a distinction shared only with the contemporary Rolls-Royce in America. This was achieved by installing the engine transversely to the direction of travel in the 9000 (instead of longitudinally as in the 900). Unlike the 900, the 9000 kept the ignition switch in the more conventional steering column position rather than between the front seats. The inspiration for the seats was taken by Björn Envall from The Muppet Show&#x27;s &quot;Pigs in Space&quot;, a sketch by the late puppeteer Jim Henson.

In total, 503,087 Saab 9000s were manufactured.
These are divided into:
216,385 Saab 9000 CC (MY 1985–1991),
174,525 Saab 9000 CS (MY 1992–1998),
112,177 Saab 9000 CD (MY 1988–1997).

== History ==
The 9000 was launched to the motoring press at a conference at Kolmården Game Park on 24 May 1984 and 1985 in the European market. This original model called &quot;Saab 9000 Turbo 16&quot; was a five-door hatchback, only available with a manual gearbox and the 2.0-litre turbocharged 4-cylinder engine with 16 valves, already known from the 900. Maximum power was quoted to be without a catalytic converter. The 9000 has Drag coefficient of Cd 0.34, very competitive for the time. Earlier on in the development, the PRV engine had also been considered as well as the Ford Vulcan engine from the upcoming Ford Taurus.

The Saab 9000 was awarded Best Prestige Car 1985 by the French magazine L&#x27;Action Automobile. Cars built in the first year had problems with weak structural rigidity and developed a reputation for cracks and fatigue if fitted with tow hooks or sunroofs. Earlier production 9000s were not able to pass the American crash test standards but the car was continuously reinforced during its production run.

At the end of 1985, for the 1986 model year, the 9000 was rolled out in Saab&#x27;s most important foreign market: the US. It was fitted with the 2.0-litre turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, now with exhaust gas purification via catalytic converter and was rated at . Saab also introduced a fuel injected naturally aspirated engine for the 9000 during the same year, available in all of Saab&#x27;s markets. This engine is rated at with catalytic converters and without catalytic converters. The naturally aspirated engine is based on the turbocharged engine and features four valves per cylinder, electronic ignition, and a knock sensor.

In the autumn of 1986, Saab organised a record attempt with the 9000, which received much attention in the US and internationally, at the Alabama International Motor Speedway at Talladega, now the Talladega Superspeedway. &quot;Saab Turbo--In The Long Run&quot; took place over 20 days and 20 nights. &quot;The main purpose of the Long Run project is to test the endurance of our cars as part of our ongoing testing program,&quot; explained Olle Granlund, head of Saab&#x27;s engine and transmission department and the person in charge of this project. All three 9000 Turbo 16s passed the mark in 21 days, the lead car breaking 21 international and two world speed records in the process. In memory of this event, Saab sold special models of its cars named &quot;Talladega&quot; in the prospective years, not only for the 9000 but also for other model series. Furthermore, the event was repeated 10 years later in 1996 with models of the &quot;NG 900&quot;.

For the 1987 model year a 4-speed automatic transmission made by ZF became available. For the 1988 model year, Saab introduced a 4-door saloon variant of the 9000 known as the CD. The front of the Sedan was different (more modern) and more streamlined than the hatchback model. This involved smoothing the edges of the headlamps and grille and sloping the front outwards. Saab adapted the design of the saloon to the current facelift of the 900, which had already received a similar new front-end design for the 1987 model year. This re-design marked a departure from the more upright front styling of the 1984 model, which was also similar to the old design of the 900 from 1978 to 1986.

From 1988, all 9000 variants were equipped with a Saab Information Display (SID) which showed fuel consumption, distance to an empty fuel tank, alternator output voltage, outside temperature, and lowest battery voltage during vehicle start. If the outside temperature fell to , the temperature display is automatically selected to warn of possible black ice road conditions. A separate pictogram monitored door and hatch opening and exterior light bulb condition. 1988 also marked the introduction of pyrotechnic seat belt tensioners for the front seats.

Saab Direct Ignition was also introduced in 1988 with the 9000 CD and its B202 turbocharged engine. The CC&#x27;s engine also got similar updates for the 1989 model year and the direct injection system later expanded to all models (except models equipped with the V6 engine, which came from General Motors). The output of both engines increased slightly through optimisation, from DIN for the catalyzed turbo model, from DIN for the catalyzed, naturally aspirated engine, and from DIN in the uncatalyzed model.

For the 1990 model year, Saab introduced the newly developed and enlarged &quot;B234&quot; 2.3-litre engine, rated at for the naturally aspirated variation. This version develops in US-market cars. For the 1991 model year, the new engine also became available also with a turbocharger, rated at . Unlike the other engines, each of which was also used in the 900, the B234 engine was only used in the 9000 (and later in other model series).

For the 1991 (Europe) and 1992 (US) model years, Saab also adopted the sloping front design of the CD for the CC hatchback. With this, the flat front design of the 90, 99, 900 and the early 9000 was finally over. But this design existed only for a single year on the CC in most markets (the CD notchback retained its old design until the 1994 model year). Also new during 1991 was the ozone-friendly air-conditioning system using R134a - the first in the world. Saab also offered conversion kits for existing, air conditioned 9000 models.

The next bigger facelift for the 9000 5-door hatchback was followed by the introduction of a partial redesign for the 1992 model year in Europe (for 1993 model year in the US), known as the CS. At the release of the CS, the original hatchback variant from 1985–1991/1992 model years was retrospectively designated CC to differentiate it from the newer model. The &quot;old&quot; CC continued to be sold alongside the facelifted model in some markets as an entry-level model and particularly in the US, where the new CS was not available until 1993.

A new turbocharger management system, Trionic 5 and later Trionic 7, was equipped from the 1993 model year onwards (the Trionic system used resistor spark plugs to detect for engine knock in place of the knock sensors incorporated into the engine block in the previous APC system). The model range was also revised to provide some uniformity to the model designations on all markets. They became CS/CSE and CD/CDE:

*the CS / CD were equipped with basic equipment
*the CSE / CDE came with most available equipment from factory

In principle, both trim levels could be combined with the engines available in the respective model year. This means that even a &quot;simple&quot; CS could be ordered with the 200 hp turbocharged engine, for example.

For the 1995 model year, a 3.0-litre &quot;B308&quot; V6 engine from General Motors rated at was introduced as standard for the CDE trim and optional for the CSE trim.

===End of production===
The four-door CD/E models were discontinued in all markets in summer 1997 (already discontinued in the US in summer 1995). The production of the performance-oriented Aero model also ended in summer 1997. Only 1,400 units of the 9000 were produced for the final model year pf 1998 (starting in August 1997), and of these, only 400 were exported to the United States, the main foreign market for Saab. In 1997, Saab introduced the successor of the 9000 called the 9-5.

== Models ==
=== 9000 CC (hatchback) ===
Originally known simply as the 9000, the original hatchback variant was later given the CC identifier, standing for &quot;Combi Coupe&quot;, to differentiate it from the CD (&quot;Corps Diplomatique&quot;) saloon and later CS hatchback. Saab also used this different identifier for models of the 900. While originally equipped with an upright front design, this was replaced by the facelift adopting the sloped design language in the 1990 model year that had earlier debuted on the 9000 CD saloon in 1988.

As with the 900 CC, the 9000 CC had some special models in some countries, such as the 9000 Turbo 16 SP in France (SP stands for &quot;Sport and Performance&quot;). In Germany and Switzerland there were also a special edition named &quot;Saab 9000 Turbo 16 S&quot;, with an airflow kit and the B202 turbocharged engine with a catalytic converter tuned up to 195 hp (for 1990). But the most popular special series is the so-called &quot;Talladega&quot; (US and most parts of Europe) or &quot;Carlsson&quot; (UK), both models available as CC and CD saloon versions. The &quot;Carlsson&quot; takes its name from legendary Swedish rally ace Erik Carlsson, who secured numerous wins for Saab in the sixties. In markets outside of the UK, it was known as the Talladega in honour of the 19 endurance records set by three standard turbocharged 9000s at Talladega Speedway in the US in 1986. Since 1988, the CC was available both with and without catalytic converter. Saab had scared the power to 175 PS (160 PS original) in the catalytic converter engine and 192 PS (175 PS original) in non-catalyzed variants. The boost pressure was around 1.0 bar. Furthermore, a new &quot;black box&quot; (APC) had been installed in the Talladega models which allows higher power. 9000 Carlsson models were produced with a paint-matched airflow body kit, spoiler, and a specially tuned turbocharged engine producing 195 PS (185 PS with catalytic converter) with the B202 turbo in 1990 up to in 1991-92 with the B234 turbo and was only available with a manual transmission. The &quot;Carlsson&quot; was produced from 1990 to 1992 (changing from CC to CS design) with engine output up to 225 PS and can be described as the precursor of the Aero, which was introduced in 1993 with the CS design. A number of the Carlsson editions fitted with the &quot;B202&quot; turbocharged engine were sold into the Australian market. In total 216,385 9000 CC were produced from 1985-1991 (43% of the total production numbers).

=== 9000 CD (saloon) ===
The 9000 CD was introduced in Nice, France in January 1988. The CD was the four-door saloon body style featuring a slightly more aerodynamic front design which the CC did not receive until 1991. The redesigned rear gave the CD about 20% more torsional rigidity. Just as in the launch of the CC variant, the 9000 CD was initially available only with the B202 turbo engine, but Saab combined it right from the start with its new &quot;DI ignition system&quot; At the Birmingham Motor Show in September 1988, Saab premiered the non-turbocharged model of the CD with the naturally aspirated 2.0-litre inline-four. In 1990 Saab introduced the 2.3-litre &quot;B234&quot; normally aspirated engine for the CC and CD. Since then, the CD was available with the same basic engines as the CC, except the 225 PS &quot;Aero&quot; engine which was reserved for the liftbacks.

From the beginning, Saab had placed the CD above the hatchback model in terms of equipment and price. This was in keeping with the spirit of the times, which saw an expensive notchback model more as a car for business people (with or without a chauffeur) who did not need the cargo space of the CC. This is why Saab never offered the CD with a folding rear seat, which would have been at the expense of stability and peace and quiet in the interior. With the introduction of the 9000 2.3 Turbo CD &quot;Griffin&quot; for 1992 as the top model of the 9000 series, Saab finally placed itself in the luxury class. The Griffin was only available as notchback and only with the 2.3 Turbo engine and only 400 units were produced.

In 1994, for the 1995 model year, Saab redesigned the CD for the first time since its introduction, the model now receiving the same front end design as on the CS and a revised taillight arrangement. In some European markets, Saab revived the &quot;Griffin&quot; model from 1995 onwards. It was only available with the V6 engine, automatic transmission and with numerous luxury appointments, such as an optional second air conditioning unit in the boot for the rear occupants and with all available electric options, special eucalyptus green paint, walnut trim and rear window blinds.

Saab withdrew the notchback from the US market in the summer of 1995, but kept offering this bodystyle in other markets until summer 1997. Total production of the 9000 CD amounted to 112,177 units (22.3% of total production).

=== 9000 CS (hatchback) ===
Saab presented the 9000 CS (Combi Sedan), an updated version of the former CC hatchback body variant, in Europe in autumn 1991 for the 1992 model year (in the US the CS was introduced in 1993). The CS featured a lowered front fascia with new headlights, new grille, some minor changes at the doors and a substantially redesigned rear-end. Although the interior design remained basically the same, there were some minor cosmetic changes. The deeper C-pillars and stronger construction at the rear increased torsional rigidity, which the original CC design had been criticized for lacking. The new body was also designed to meet upcoming (1994) Federal side impact standards.

The redesigned front and rear looked sleeker, but did not actually lower the wind resistance. However, lift was reduced, making the car more stable at high-speeds. The 9000 CS was fitted with a variety of Saab H engines.

After the old B202 engine was phased out after 1993, there were in summary 9 different engine versions for the CS available in the upcoming years. After the 1995 model year, the naturally aspirated four-cylinder engines were discontinued in the United States.

A limited-edition Anniversary model was introduced in 1997 to mark Saab&#x27;s 50th anniversary, featuring leather seats embossed with the classic, aircraft-inspired Saab logo and a colour-keyed body kit. The engine type was freely selectable from the available turbocharged engines from the 1997 model year except the engine used in the Aero model. The &quot;Anniversary&quot; could be ordered until the end of the 9000&#x27;s production in 1998. During 1998, the &quot;Anniversary&quot; could be also ordered with the engine of the Aero model.

The Saab 9000 CS Aero was introduced in 1993. Unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in October 1992, the new 9000 Aero was the fastest Saab automobile to date. It was powered by a version of Saab&#x27;s 2.3-litre &quot;B234&quot; engine, with more power courtesy of a larger Mitsubishi &quot;TD04&quot; turbocharger. Models equipped with the automatic transmission-equipped were limited to and kept the regular turbocharged models&#x27; Garrett T25 turbocharger. The Aero was equipped with paint-matched body kit and spoiler, eight-way Recaro-designed heated sports seats, a sport suspension, and 16-inch three-spoke Super Aero wheels. The Aero&#x27;s in-gear acceleration was strongly emphasised, and period advertising boasted, &quot;The 5-speed Saab 9000 Aero will streak from 50 to 75 mph faster than a Ferrari Testarossa or a Porsche Carrera 4.&quot; The Aero was discontinued in 1997 and its engine became available for all 9000 models for 1998. Total production numbers of the 9000 CS amounted to 174,525 units (34.7% of overall production).

== One-offs ==

=== Convertible (prototype) ===
A convertible version was constructed by Finnish company Valmet, the prototype version is currently on display at the Uusikaupunki car museum near the Valmet factory. Other experiments included fitting of the Yamaha developed Ford SHO V6 engine most famously fitted to the Ford Taurus SHO. This was vetoed by Saab-Scania, Saab&#x27;s owner at the time, as was the fitting of a VM Motori diesel engine which had been executed with the aim of increasing Saab&#x27;s sales in central and southern Europe.

=== Prometheus (prototype) ===
In 1993, Saab experimented with steer-by-wire technology as part of the pan-European programme &quot;Prometheus&quot; (Programme for European Traffic with Highest Efficiency and Unprecedented Safety). Their contribution to the programme consisted of a modified 9000 with the steering wheel replaced with a center-mounted joystick. This setup removed the risk of body and facial injury in the event of an accident. It also provided easier and cheaper airbag installation, as well as improved instrument panel visibility. This prototype was tested by Jeremy Clarkson in an episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot;; the segment was revisited in Series 18, Episode 5 of the &quot;Top Gear&quot; TV series, where Clarkson and James May paid tribute to the fallen automotive marque.

=== MPV (prototype) ===
At a visit to the American Sunroof Company, who helped design the Saab 900 convertible, the engineers spotted the building of a minivan based on the Chrysler&#x27;s K-car (later launched as Chrysler Voyager). Gunnar Larsson thought it was a neat idea and when he came home he asked the head of bodyworks Dick Ohlsson if they could do something like that based on the Saab 9000. &quot;No problem&quot;, was the reply and a small team started working on it in secret. They used the 9000 platform but lengthened and with higher roof and room for seven persons (even if the rear seat was mostly suitable for children). The full-scale model was finished in May 1985, two months after the idea was first mooted.

=== Saab 9000 Limousine ===
British coachbuilder Coleman &amp; Milne extended several Saab 9000s into stretch limousine versions.

=== Saab 9000 Ecosport ===
The 9000 Ecosport was developed to be introduced at the 1992 Geneva Motor Show. It featured a engine and four-wheel drive. Saab had a finished car to show, posters and brochures were printed, but in the last moment General Motors stopped Saab from unveiling the car as they wanted Opel to be the first to present four-wheel drive. Saab had to quickly rebuild it as a front-wheel drive only car. The show car had some innovations like UV headlights and a more eco-friendly engine.

== Engines ==
The Saab 9000 was available with a variety of naturally-aspirated and turbocharged engines. The range consisted mostly of the Saab 2.0 and 2.3 litre engines, but there was also the 3.0-litre V6 made by General Motors. One 9000 was fitted with a prototype Saab V8 engine.

After the facelift in 1992 and as of 1993 (in most markets), the newly introduced two equipment series CS/CD and CSE/CDE could be combined with all available engines in the respective model years. This means that even a base CS could be ordered with the most powerful turbo engine. The face lifted CS models and the CD were available in MY 1992 in most countries with the same four engines which had also powered the former CC:
- the old B202 with and without the turbocharger, both known from the classic Saab 900
- the B234 with and without the turbocharger
This changed for 1993: on most international markets a 2.0 litre light pressure turbo (LPT) equipped engine called B204 with two balance shafts (like in the B234), became available on both CS and CD models. In these markets, this LPT engine gradually replaced the 2.3 litre naturally aspirated unit. Because Saab did not introduce the 2.0 litre LPT in the U.S., the LPT concept did not enter the U.S. market until 1994 with the 2.3 LPT, based on a re-designed B234 engine. Since then, the Saab 9000 has only been available in the U.S. with the three 2.3 litre turbo engines:
2.3 litre LPT: 170 hp
2.3 litre FPT: 200 hp
2.3 litre Aero: 225 hp
The 9000 with this LPT engine had the best fuel economy of any large car in the U.S. in 1995. 
The background of the new B204 and re-designed B234 engine was that Saab needed a suitable engine for the upcoming 900 NG. Since Saab was always under high-cost pressure, the new B204 were designed to fit both the new Saab 900/2 and the Saab 9000. So the new B234 without turbochargers and the B204 without turbochargers and as LPT and FPT were all used in both the 9000 and 900 NG.
There were two generations of the B234 engine in the 9000, one made from 1990-1993 (called &quot;long block&quot;) and the other from 1994 to 1998 (called &quot;short block&quot;). The later motors had a revised oil sump system, cylinder-head, timing cover, and different bell housing pattern.

Therefore, over the years three different engine types developed by Saab itself which were available for the 9000: B202/B204/B234 (with the old B202 phased out on all markets from 1994). The B204 and B234 both came with and without the turbochargers which additionally split in so called LPT (low pressure turbo) and FPT (full pressure turbo). Till 1995, the LPT had the designation &quot;Ecopower&quot; on the cylinder head in some markets. From 1996 Saab used this designation &quot;EcoPower&quot; for all turbocharged engines and in general for the Saab turbo concept. Both systems used the same Garrett &quot;T25&quot; turbocharger with a base boost pressure of , but the FPT is equipped with a boost control valve that is manipulated by the ECU. This allows the boost pressure to be increased as the ECU sees fit. Maximum stock boost on a full pressure turbo varies from depending on the year and transmission.

For 1995 a 210 hp three-litre V6, originating from General Motors and also found on the Opel (and Vauxhall) Omega, was introduced.
For MY 1996 the name “Ecopower” was now applied to all turbocharged engines regardless of FPT or LPT variants. The 2.3 litre fuel-injected engine (without turbocharger) was phased out.

<doc id="312047" wikidata="Q474169" url="?curid=312047" title="Amorphis">
<text>Amorphis is a Finnish progressive metal band founded by Jan Rechberger, Tomi Koivusaari, and Esa Holopainen in 1990. Initially, the band was a death metal act, but on later albums they evolved into playing other genres, including progressive metal, folk metal, and melodic death metal. They frequently use the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the epic poem of Finland, as a source for their lyrics.

==History==

===&quot;Disment of Soul&quot; and &quot;The Karelian Isthmus&quot;===
Jan Rechberger played in a thrash metal band called Violent Solution, which Tomi Koivusaari had left in 1990 to form the death metal band Abhorrence, with Koivusaari being replaced by Esa Holopainen. Violent Solution slowly dissolved with Jan Rechberger and Esa Holopainen deciding to continue working with each other to form their own death metal band, Amorphis. With Rechberger having ties with Koivusaari, in early 1990, Koivusaari became the vocalist and the band also got Oppu Laine to become their bassist. During that time, Koivusaari also performed rhythm guitar, leading to the band dumping all original compositions and starting over again. Koivusaari&#x27;s other band, Abhorrence, split up and he found himself with more time to put into Amorphis.

A demo tape, &quot;Disment of Soul&quot;, was recorded in 1991 by Timo Tolkki at TTT studios. It was meant to be &quot;Dismemberment of soul&quot; but they forgot the word &quot;member&quot; and so it was Disment.
After the band recorded their first studio demo tape, Relapse Records offered Abhorrence a recording contract. Since Abhorrence was no longer active, they sent their own demo in the return mail and were signed to a worldwide recording deal. Soon after getting signed, they released their debut, &quot;The Karelian Isthmus&quot;, under the new name Amorphis and later released the &quot;Privilege of Evil&quot; EP. The EP featured Abhorrence&#x27;s original vocalist, Jukka Kolehmainen, on vocals on the Abhorrence cover song, &quot;Vulgar Necrolatry&quot;.

===&quot;Tales from the Thousand Lakes&quot;===
In 1994, Amorphis released their second album, &quot;Tales from the Thousand Lakes&quot;, a concept album based on the Finnish national epic, the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. This 1994 release, while still rooted in death metal, was their first step toward a new direction as melodic clean vocals were added, provided by Ville Tuomi. &quot;Tales from the Thousand Lakes&quot; won the band a fan base thanks to its innovative sound and fusion of death metal with traditional folk, psychedelia, and progressive elements. This album went on to influence the signature Amorphis sound.

===&quot;Elegy&quot;===
During the subsequent tours, Martenson (keyboards) left the band, to be replaced by Kim Rantala. Rechberger was replaced by Pekka Kasari (ex-Stone), and a sixth member was recruited, singer Pasi Koskinen. The third album, &quot;Elegy&quot;, was released in 1996. Lyrics were again adapted from Finnish folklore, in this case, the &quot;Kanteletar&quot;, a collection of ancient folk poetry. Pasi and Tomi shared the vocals on an equal basis, with Pasi providing only clean parts. After a year and a half of touring following the release of &quot;Elegy&quot;, the band members took a hiatus.

===&quot;Tuonela&quot; and &quot;Story: 10th Anniversary&quot;===
Their next offering, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Tuonela&quot;, was a mellow guitar album, although toward the end of the studio sessions, Santeri Kallio of Kyyria was brought in to add some keyboard tracks to the songs. New instruments were introduced (Tomi playing sitar in the song &quot;Greed&quot;, Sakari Kukko on saxophone and flute providing a foreign accent) and the death growls were reduced, as all vocals were performed by Pasi.

The band experienced another line-up change. Following the breakup of Kyyria, Santeri joined Amorphis as a full-time member. Bassist Oppu was replaced by another ex-Kyyria member, Niclas Etelävuori, to tour with Amorphis on their third United States tour.

The tenth-anniversary compilation &quot;Story&quot; was released.

===&quot;Am Universum&quot;===
&quot;Am Universum&quot; was released in 2001, and included more emphasis on keyboards and saxophone work, the latter contributed by Sakari Kukko. It was an experimental album and Amorphis&#x27; most psychedelic to date.

===&quot;Far from the Sun&quot; and &quot;Chapters&quot;===
In 2002, the band contributed to the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Menolippu Mombasaan&quot;. The commissioned piece was a cover version of a 1976 Finnish pop hit &quot;Kuusamo&quot;, and is as of 2024 the band&#x27;s only song in their native language. The same year they started to record the band&#x27;s last album with Relapse Records, &quot;Far from the Sun&quot;. In 2003, Relapse released the retrospective &quot;Chapters&quot;, which included a DVD featuring the band&#x27;s videos from &quot;Black Winter Day&quot; to &quot;Alone&quot;. &quot;Far from the Sun&quot; was produced by the band itself, which had been rejoined by original drummer Jan Rechberger after Pekka Kasari had quit to concentrate on family duties. Pasi left the band in 2004 after nine years.

===&quot;Eclipse&quot;===
While searching for a new vocalist Amorphis received over a hundred demo tapes from prospective vocalists but none of them became the new frontman of the band. Eventually Tomi Joutsen got an audition through word of mouth and he became their next singer in 2005. Joutsen, best known for his work with metal band Sinisthra, urged Amorphis to return to the use of contrasting vocal styles for their next album. His first album with the band, &quot;Eclipse&quot;, was released in 2006. It was a critical and commercial success, hailed as a return to form by some critics, and achieving gold certification in Finland for the first time in their history.

Just after Joutsen joined, Amorphis performed under name Amorjens (&quot;aHello&quot; in Finnish) to perform at least one gig in Finland.

===&quot;Silent Waters&quot;===
Amorphis followed &quot;Eclipse&quot; with gigs and festival appearances throughout Europe, all the while writing new material for the follow-up. They released their next album, &quot;Silent Waters&quot;, on 3 September 2007, achieving gold certification in Finland for the second time. The album marked the first time in the history of the band that an album was recorded with the same personnel as the previous one. In support of &quot;Silent Waters&quot;, Amorphis launched their third headlining tour in North America alongside supporting acts Samael and Virgin Black.

===&quot;Skyforger&quot; and &quot;Magic &amp; Mayhem – Tales from the Early Years&quot;===

In November 2008, Amorphis entered Sonic Pump Studios to begin recording their 9th album. The result of those studio sessions, &quot;Skyforger&quot;, was released in Finland on 27 May 2009, throughout Europe two days later, and in the United States on 16 June. Initial presses of the album had mastering errors, which prompted Nuclear Blast to issue replacement CDs. The album was certified gold in Finland on 7 July 2011, making it the third Amorphis album in a row to do so.

On 20 November 2009, while touring in support of &quot;Skyforger&quot;, Amorphis filmed a show at Club Teatria in Oulu, Finland for their first-ever live DVD. The show was released alongside another show from Summer Breeze Open Air 2009 and a documentary, titled &quot;Tales from the 20 Years&quot;, as a part of the CD/DVD set &quot;Forging the Land of Thousand Lakes&quot; on 25 June 2010.

On 15 September 2010, Amorphis released &quot;Magic &amp; Mayhem – Tales from the Early Years&quot;, a re-working of a dozen tracks from their first three albums with slightly different arrangements, better audio quality and featuring the band&#x27;s current lineup, plus a cover of &quot;Light my Fire&quot; as a bonus track. During the tour that followed, the band briefly reunited with Pasi Koskinen and other past members (such as keyboard player Kim Rantala) on stage, to perform some of the older songs.

===&quot;The Beginning of Times&quot;===

On 30 September 2010, Nuclear Blast announced that Amorphis had started work on a new album. On 24 January 2011, the band revealed that recording was almost finished, except for vocals which would be completed at the home of producer Marko Hietala. The album &quot;The Beginning of Times&quot; was released on 27 May 2011 in Europe and 7 June 2011 in the United States, and features cover art by longtime collaborator Travis Smith.

===&quot;Circle&quot;===
On 21 August 2012, Amorphis announced on their website that a new album was in the works. On 17 January 2013, the band announced the title and release date for their next record. &quot;Circle&quot; was released on 19 April in Europe and 30 April in North America. Tomi Joutsen said about the new album, &quot;Circle represents integrity. Back in the days, when there was something special to talk about, wise men used to sit in circle. Not everyone was invited to join them. But in this story, the protagonist was invited among the wise men&#x27;s circle.&quot;

On 16 September 2013, &quot;Circle&quot; won Metal Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Album of the Year&quot; award. Esa Holopainen said about the award, &quot;For us, Album of the Year award is a great recognition for the work done so far. Especially when we got it from our 11th studio album.&quot;

On 4 August 2014, Amorphis announced on their website and through social media that they would be playing a number of special &quot;Tales from the Thousand Lakes&quot; 20th anniversary shows where their 1994 album would be performed in its entirety. The shows included festivals such as Wacken Open Air, Maryland Deathfest, and 70000 Tons of Metal, with many other tour dates and festivals included.

===&quot;Under the Red Cloud&quot;===
The band began demoing new songs at the start of 2015, and on 4 March, it was announced that Amorphis would begin to record a new album in April, at Fascination Street Studio, Örebro, Sweden with Jens Bogren, and with an album release date sometime in September 2015.

The lyrics would be written once again by Pekka Kainulainen, who says, &quot;Like &#x27;Kalevala&#x27;, they are descriptions of natural phenomena, seasons and the human mind. Reoccurring situations where hope and uncertainty alternate. Attempting to gain advice from higher powers. The poems do not form a complete story per se, but they are drawn together by a certain theme. We live under a red cloud and once again, time weighs us.&quot;

The release of the new album was to be followed by a world tour, starting with shows in the band&#x27;s home country of Finland, then other parts of Europe with Nightwish and Arch Enemy in November 2015.

On 15 June 2015, the band announced the upcoming twelfth album titled &quot;Under the Red Cloud&quot;, with the artwork and track list revealed and with a release date of 4 September 2015.

===&quot;Queen of Time&quot;===

On 22 February 2018, Amorphis announced they had finished recording their thirteenth studio album &quot;Queen of Time&quot;, which was released on 18 May 2018 via Nuclear Blast Records. The album recording process featured the band&#x27;s former bass player Olli-Pekka &#x27;Oppu&#x27; Laine replacing Amorphis&#x27; longtime bassist Niclas Etelävuori, who left in April 2017 after their North American tour due to disagreements with the band&#x27;s management, making this the first time since &quot;Tales from the Thousand Lakes&quot; that all the original band members had played on an album together. On 23 March 2018, the band released the first single, &quot;The Bee&quot;, off the record.

=== &quot;Halo&quot; ===
On 24 February 2022, Amorphis released its 14th studio album, &quot;Halo&quot;, marking the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary since the release of its 1992 debut record, &quot;The Karelian Isthmus&quot;. The band struggled with various complications related to the Covid-19 pandemic while recording the album. This album is also more guitar-driven and &quot;heavier&quot; than &quot;Queen of Time&quot;. The album has been received well by both fans and critics, landing on top of the charts in Finland and in top-10 charts in many other countries. As of March 2022, two songs from the album have been released with full music videos (&quot;The Moon&quot; and &quot;On the Dark Waters&quot;). The album continues to draw heavily on Finnish folklore, with references to Tuonela, the underworld realm of Finnish and Estonian mythology.

<doc id="312054" wikidata="Q237632" url="?curid=312054" title="Palatine bone">
<text>In anatomy, the palatine bones (; derived from the Latin &quot;palatum&quot;) are two irregular bones of the facial skeleton in many animal species, located above the uvula in the throat. Together with the maxilla, they comprise the hard palate.

== Structure==
The palatine bones are situated at the back of the nasal cavity between the maxilla and the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone.

They contribute to the walls of three cavities: the floor and lateral walls of the nasal cavity, the roof of the mouth, and the floor of the orbits. They help to form the pterygopalatine and pterygoid fossae, and the inferior orbital fissures.

Each palatine bone somewhat resembles the letter L, and consists of a horizontal plate, a perpendicular plate, and three projecting processes—the pyramidal process, which is directed backward and lateral from the junction of the two parts, and the orbital and sphenoidal processes, which surmount the vertical part, and are separated by a deep notch, the sphenopalatine notch. The two plates form the posterior part of the hard palate and the floor of the nasal cavity; anteriorly, they join with the maxillae. The two horizontal plates articulate with each other at the posterior part of the median palatine suture and more anteriorly with the maxillae at the transverse palatine suture.

The human palatine articulates with six bones: the sphenoid, ethmoid, maxilla, inferior nasal concha, vomer and opposite palatine.

There are two important foramina in the palatine bones that transmit nerves and blood vessels to this region: the greater and lesser palatine. The larger greater palatine foramen is located in the posterolateral region of each of the palatine bones, usually at the apex of the maxillary third molar. The greater palatine foramen transmits the greater palatine nerve and blood vessels. A smaller opening nearby, the lesser palatine foramen, transmits the lesser palatine nerve and blood vessels to the soft palate and tonsils. Both foramina are openings of the pterygopalatine canal that carries the descending palatine nerves and blood vessels from the pterygopalatine fossa to the palate.

==Function==
The sphenopalatine foramen is the opening between the sphenoid bone and orbital processes of the palatine bone; it opens into the nasal cavity and gives passage to branches from the pterygopalatine ganglion and the sphenopalatine artery from the maxillary artery.

==Other animals==
In bony fish, the palatine bone consists of the perpendicular plate only, lying on the inner edge of the maxilla. The lower surface of the bone may bear several teeth, forming a second row behind those of the maxilla; in many cases, these are actually larger than the maxillary teeth. Although a similar pattern was present in primitive tetrapods, the palatine bone is reduced in most living amphibians, forming, in frogs and salamanders, only a narrow bar between the vomer and maxilla.

Early fossil reptiles retained the arrangement seen in more primitive vertebrates, but in mammals, the lower surface of the palatine became folded over during evolution, forming the horizontal plate, and meeting in the midline of the mouth. This forms the rear of the hard palate, separating the oral and nasal cavities, and making it easier to breathe while eating. A parallel development has occurred to varying degrees in many living reptiles, reaching its greatest extent in crocodilians. In birds, the palatine bones remain separate, long the sides of the rear part of the upper jaw, and typically have a mobile articulation with the cranium.

There are numerous variations amongst mammals, amphibians and other species. For example, the palatine bone in many amphibians such as the rough-skinned newt manifests as a distinct V-shaped structure. In the case of cat species, the horizontal and a vertical elements join at a 45-degree angle.

<doc id="312055" wikidata="Q1526531" url="?curid=312055" title="Gippsland">
<text>Gippsland () is a rural region in the southeastern part of Victoria, Australia, mostly comprising the coastal plains south of the Victorian Alps (the southernmost section of the Great Dividing Range). It covers an elongated area of east of the Shire of Cardinia (Melbourne&#x27;s outermost southeastern suburbs) between Dandenong Ranges and Mornington Peninsula, and is bounded to the north by the mountain ranges and plateaus/highlands of the High Country (which separate it from Hume region in Victoria&#x27;s northeast), to the southwest by the Western Port Bay, to the south and east by the Bass Strait and the Tasman Sea, and to the east and northeast by the Black–Allan Line (the easternmost section of the Victoria/New South Wales state border). 

Gippsland is divided by the Strzelecki Ranges and tributaries of the Gippsland Lakes into West Gippsland, South Gippsland, Latrobe Valley, Central Gippsland and East Gippsland. At the 2016 Australian census, Gippsland had a population of , with the principal centres , Warragul, Drouin, Bairnsdale, , Sale, , Wonthaggi, , and Phillip Island. Gippsland is known for mining, power generation and farming as well as its tourist destinations — Phillip Island, Wilsons Promontory, the Gippsland Lakes, Walhalla, the Baw Baw Plateau, and the Strzelecki Ranges. It also includes around a hundred islands, mostly between the mainland and Tasmania.

==History==
The traditional owners are Indigenous Australians of the Gunai nation and in part of West Gippsland the Bunurong nation. Before permanent European colonisation, the area was visited by sealers and wattle bark gatherers who did not settle. Samuel Anderson (1803–1863), a Scottish immigrant from Kirkcudbright, agriculturist and explorer, arrived in Hobart, Tasmania, in 1830, and in 1835 established a squatter agricultural settlement on the Bass River in Gippsland, the third permanent colonial settlement in Victoria (then called the Port Phillip District). His business partner Robert Massie joined him in 1837. Both had worked for the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company at Circular Head, Tasmania. Samuel&#x27;s brothers Hugh (1808–1898) and Thomas (1814–1903) arrived at Bass shortly after, where they established a successful farming venture.

Further European colonisation followed two separate expeditions to the area.
During his expedition to the South (December 1839 – May 1840) in March 1840, Polish explorer Paweł Edmund Strzelecki led an expedition across Gunai country, and gave his own names to many of their natural landmarks and places. Following these expeditions, the name &quot;Gippsland&quot; stuck, a name chosen by Strzelecki in honour of the New South Wales Governor, George Gipps, his sponsor.

Angus McMillan led the second European expedition between 1840, naming Gunai country &quot;Caledonia Australis&quot;. The naming of this geographical region, however, remained the name given by P. E. Strzelecki – Gippsland.

The township of Bass was surveyed and colonised in the early 1860s.

The intensive colonisation of south Gippsland began late in the 1870s. A story of that process is told in, &quot;The land of the Lyre Bird&quot; (1920).

Before the cancellation of the 2026 Commonwealth Games, Gippsland was set to serve as one of its hosts in regional Victoria.

==Geography==
Gippsland is traditionally subdivided into four or five main subregions or districts:
*West Gippsland (roughly equivalent to the Baw Baw Shire)
*South Gippsland (Bass Coast and South Gippsland Shires)
*the Latrobe Valley (Latrobe City and areas of Baw Baw to the north)
*East Gippsland (Shires of Wellington and East Gippsland).
*Sometimes a fifth region, Central Gippsland (corresponding approximately to the Shire of Wellington), is added to refer to the drier zone between the Gippsland Lakes and Yarram.

Gippsland Plains Grassy Woodland is an endangered vegetation community within the region.

==Climate==
The climate of Gippsland is temperate and generally humid, except in the central region around Sale, where annual rainfall averages around . In the Strzelecki Ranges annual rainfall can be as high as , while on the high mountains of East Gippsland it probably reaches similar levels – much of it falling as snow. In lower levels east of the Snowy River, mean annual rainfall is typically about and less variable than in the coastal districts of New South Wales. Mean maximum temperatures in lower areas range from in January to in July. In the highlands of the Baw Baw Plateau and the remote Errinundra Plateau, temperatures range from a maximum of to a minimum of . However, in winter, mean minima in these areas can be as low as , leading to heavy snowfalls that often isolate the Errinundra Plateau between June and October.

==Flora and fauna==

Gippsland is home to many species of flora and fauna. Animals that live there include the swamp wallaby, koala, echidna and wombat. 

Native plants and trees include grass trees (&quot;Xanthorrhoea australis&quot;), which provide a valuable food source of nectar, pollen, larvae and seeds for birds, insects and mammals.

==Natural resources==

The soils in Gippsland are generally very infertile, being profoundly deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium. Apart from frequently flooded areas, they are classed as Spodosols, Psamments and Ultisols. Consequently, heavy fertilisation is required for agriculture or pastoral development. Despite this, parts of Gippsland have become highly productive dairying and vegetable-growing regions: the region supplies Melbourne with most of its needs in these commodities. A few alluvial soils (chiefly near the Snowy) have much better native fertility, and these have always been intensively cultivated. In the extreme northeast is a small section of the Monaro Tableland used for grazing beef cattle.

Gippsland possesses very few deposits of metallic minerals (gold rushes in the nineteenth century around Foster, Buchan petered out quickly). However, the deep underground gold mines operated at Walhalla for a fifty-year period between 1863 and 1913. Gippsland has no deposits of major industrial nonmetallic minerals, but it does feature the world&#x27;s largest brown coal deposits and, around Sale and offshore in the Bass Strait, some of the largest deposits of oil and natural gas in Australia.

Like the rest of Australia, the seas around Gippsland are of very low productivity as there is no upwelling due to the warm currents in the Tasman Sea. Nonetheless, towns such as Marlo and Mallacoota depended for a long time on the fishing of abalone, whose shells could fetch very high prices because of their use for pearls and pearl inlays.

== Administration ==

=== Political representation ===
For Australian federal elections for the House of Representatives, the electoral divisions of Flinders, Monash, and Gippsland lay entirely or partly in the Gippsland region. Flinders and McMillan are currently held by the Liberal Party, while Gippsland is held by the Nationals.

For elections for the Victorian Legislative Assembly, the electoral districts of Bass, Narracan, Morwell, Gippsland South and Gippsland East lay entirely or partly in the Gippsland region. Bass is held by Labor, Narracan is held by the Liberals, while Gippsland East, Gippsland South and Morwell are held by the Nationals.

==== Local government areas ====
Gippsland contains six local government areas:

=== Environmental protection ===
The Gippsland region contains the Alfred National Park, Baw Baw National Park, Coopracambra National Park, Croajingolong National Park, Errinundra National Park, Gippsland Lakes Coastal Park, Lind National Park, Mitchell River National Park, Morwell National Park, Snowy River National Park, Tarra-Bulga National Park, The Lakes National Park, and Wilsons Promontory National Park.

There are also large areas of State forest that contribute towards conservation objectives.

<text>Xhafer [[bey]] Ypi ( January 12, 1880, Starje – December 17, 1940) was an Albanian politician.

A member of the Ypi family of Albania, he was educated at a university in Istanbul. In 1920–1921 he was Minister of Internal Affairs and Minister of Justice. He also held the position of Minister of Public Instruction.

As the leader of the Popular Party, in late December 1921 he formed a government where Fan S. Noli was the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Ahmed Zogu was the Minister of Internal Affairs. Until December 4, 1922, Ypi was Prime Minister; in 1922, after Noli&#x27;s resignation, he was also acting Minister of Foreign Affairs.

From December 2, 1922, to January 31, 1925, Ypi was a member of the High Council (the collegial Head of State, formally for William of Wied). In June 1924 he left Albania because of Noli&#x27;s revolt, but he kept holding the post formally.

During Zogu&#x27;s reign, Ypi was Chief Inspector of the Royal Court.
After King Zog had fled after Italian occupation, from April 9 to April 12 Ypi was Chairman and Plenipotentiary for Justice of the Provisional Administration Committee, and as such acting head of state. From April 12, he was the Minister of Justice in Shefqet Verlaci&#x27;s government. He was killed near his hometown by an aerial bomb during the Greco-Italian War. His great-granddaughter is the Albanian philosopher and writer Lea Ypi.

Phillip Island forms a natural breakwater for the shallow waters of the Western Port. It is long and wide, with an area of about . It has of coastline and is part of the Bass Coast Shire.

A concrete bridge (originally a wooden bridge) connects the mainland town San Remo with the island town Newhaven. In the 2021 census, the island&#x27;s permanent population was 13,799, compared to 7,071 in 2001. During the summer, the population swells to 40,000. 60% of the island is farmland devoted to grazing of sheep and cattle.

Phillip Island is formally recognised by UNESCO as part of the Mornington Peninsula and Western Port Biosphere Reserve. The designation as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve highlights areas of exceptional natural significance where communities collaborate to promote sustainable living practices and sits within a global network of 759 Biosphere Reserves spanning 136 countries.

==History==
The earliest inhabitants of the area were the Yalloc Bulluk clan of the Bunurong people, of the Kulin nation. In the Bunwurrung language the island is known as &quot;corriong&quot; or &quot;millowl&quot;. Their coastal territory with its sheltered bays meant that the Yalloc Bulluk, along with other Bunurong clans, were among the first Aboriginal people in Victoria to have contact with European mariners.

Following reports of the 1798 exploration by George Bass and Matthew Flinders, the area was frequented by sealers from Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, whose interaction with the Bunurong people was not without conflict. In 1801, navigator James Grant visited the adjoining Churchill Island (which he named) and planted a crop of corn and wheat. In 1826, the scientific voyage of Dumont d&#x27;Urville, in command of the corvette &quot;Astrolabe&quot;, led to British concerns of an attempt by the French to establish a colony in Western Port. This saw the dispatch from Sydney of , under the command of Captain Wetherall, and the brigs &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Amity&quot;, by Governor Darling. 


While the French colonisation did not eventuate, Wetherall reported on finding a sealer&#x27;s camp and also two acres of wheat and corn. A fort was constructed near Rhyll, and named Dumaresq after the Governor&#x27;s private secretary. The &quot;abundance&quot; of wood, quality soil and the discovery of coal at Cape Woolamai, were mentioned in newspaper accounts. Wetherall also erected a flag staff on &quot;the flat-top&#x27;d rock off Point Grant&quot; (commonly known today as The Nobbies) on the Island&#x27;s Western extremity as a marker for the harbour entrance.

Of his encounters with the Bunurong people, Wetherall told Darling:
&quot;The Natives appear numerous, but we have not been able to obtain an interview, as they desert their camp, and run into the woods on our approach, watching our movements until we depart. As I am aware it is Your Excellency&#x27;s wish to conciliate them as much as possible, I have not allowed them to be pursued, or molested in any way.&quot;

The only reservation Wetherall had was on the island&#x27;s supply of water; he dug a &quot;tide-well&quot; near the fort but assessed the source as &quot;not in sufficient quantities for the supply of shipping&quot; and this problem would lead to the eventual move to Settlement Point on the mainland coast.

During the third voyage of , in 1839, water was &quot;found by digging in the centre of a clump of bushes on the outer part of the point at the N.E. extremity of the island, which at high water became an island, [and] occasionally made the water brackish&quot; although it was noted &quot;better might have been found a short distance in shore, as there were abundance of shrubs and other indications of water in the neighbourhood&quot;. The water question was again addressed, by Captain Moore, who accompanied Surveyor Robert Hoddle in 1840, that &quot;water can be obtained on Phillip Island, near the best anchorage, off Sandy Point.&quot;

In 1835 Samuel Anderson established the third permanent settlement in what would be Victoria at the mainland site of Bass across the bay from Phillip Island. In 1841, brothers John David and William McHaffie, were granted Phillip Island as a squatting run and took possession in 1842. The McHaffies, and later settlers, assisted the Victorian Acclimatisation society (forerunner of the committee which established the Melbourne Zoo) by introducing animals such as pheasants, deer and wallabies to Phillip Island. 

Plans for the first bridge to the island, from San Remo to Newhaven commenced in 1938, at a cost of £50,000, with the official opening by Premier Albert Dunstan taking place in November 1940. A full public holiday was declared on the island to celebrate.

In 2018, Phillip Island commemorated its 150th anniversary. To mark the moment, various events ran throughout the year including a community street parade, which took place on Saturday 3rd November.

==Environment==
===Wildlife===
Phillip Island Nature Parks manages nature conservation and ecotourism on the island.

The southern and western coasts of the island lie within the Phillip Island Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because of its importance in supporting significant populations of little penguins, short-tailed shearwaters and Pacific gulls. the island&#x27;s population of little penguins is estimated at around 40,000, with the birds living on the Summerland Estate on the Summerland Peninsula (which was bought by the Victorian Government in the 1980s for use as a wildlife reserve). After many penguins died in a 2019 heatwave, native plants such as bower spinach were planted around penguin boxes to insulate them. Grass fires, largely due to poor practices since settlement, and projected to occur more frequently as a result of climate change, threaten the penguins&#x27; habitat, and it has been observed that they do not move away from fire. A project is under way to replace more flammable introduced plants with less flammable endemic species, creating natural firebreaks. The island&#x27;s penguins have also been threatened by an invasive fox population. After the foxes were mostly eradicated in 2017, the absence of predators led to a rise in the invasive rabbit population, which in turn exacerbated erosion and threatened native orchid species. Conservationists have used phosphine gas to fumigate the island&#x27;s extensive rabbit warrens, which can destabilise houses.

In addition, there is a wildlife park where wallabies and kangaroos roam freely amongst the visitors and can be fed by hand. Seal Rocks, at the western end of the island, hosts the largest colony of fur seals in Australia (up to 16,000 around 2008). 

In recent years, other than local population of critically endangered endemic Burrunan dolphins or migratory killer whales, southern right whales and humpback whales are starting to show recoveries in the area long after commercial and illegal hunts by the Soviet Union with the help of Japan in 1970s, and the numbers using the area as nursery were growing rapidly by October 2014, allowing a rise in hopes to establish commercial whale watching activities in the vicinity of the island.

The Eastern barred bandicoot, a marsupial similar in size to a rabbit, is native to mainland Victoria. The mainland population faces significant challenges and remains the focus of ongoing conservation efforts. In recent years, successful reintroductions have taken place on Phillip Island and in the Westernport Bay region.

===Climate===
Phillip Island possesses an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), with tepid, relatively dry summers and mild, wetter winters. Tempered by prevailing south-westerly winds from the Bass Strait, the island has a milder climate than Melbourne. Average maxima vary from in February to in July, while average minima fluctuate between in February and in July. Mean precipitation is moderately low (averaging per annum), but rainfall is frequent, as Phillip Island receives 151.4 precipitation days annually (with a maximum frequency of rain in winter). The island is not very sunny, experiencing 31.8 clear days and 98.7 cloudy days per year. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 29 January 2009 to on 28 July 1994.

Phillip Island&#x27;s Grand Prix motorcycle race is traditionally held in October, often seeing unreliable and fickle weather conditions, such as very cold surface temperatures and extreme wind.

On 10 August 2005, snow was observed on the island. This was a very unusual event.

==Tourism==
Phillip Island is a significant tourist destination visited by 3.5 million people annually. The island is home to approximately 40,000 penguins making it the largest penguin colony in the world.  The Penguin Parade at Phillip Island Nature Park, in which little penguins come ashore in groups, attracts visitors from around Australia and all over the world. They come to see one of the few areas where this species of penguin can be seen, but visitors are reminded photography is not permitted for the birds&#x27; safety.

Phillip Island is also renowned for its consistently reliable and diverse surf conditions, making it one of the premier surfing destinations in the country. In 2013, Victoria’s first National Surfing Reserve was established on the island, encompassing four key locations along the coast: Woolamai, Smiths Beach, Summerlands, and Cat Bay. The National Surfing Reserve is guided by the philosophy of “care, share, and preserve.” Phillip Island has a strong history of hosting major surfing events, including the Rip Curl Pro and the Roxy Pro Women’s Surfing Festival. Currently, it is the venue for the World Surfing League – Phillip Island Pro event.

As whales embark on their annual migration north along the Victorian coastline, these magnificent creatures can be seen navigating the coastal waters around Phillip Island. Each year from May to September, the island becomes a seasonal haven for humpback whales, southern right whales, and occasionally, killer whales. Other events include the Churchill Island Working Horse and Pioneer Festival. 

Established by volunteer veterans, the National Vietnam Veterans Museum features a distinctive collection of artefacts, vehicles and memorabilia from the Vietnam War era, dedicated to supporting veterans and preserving the stories of service and sacrifice. 

In September 2023 authorities issued a safety reminder after a 22-year-old woman fell 50 metres down a cliff edge from the Pinnacles Lookout at Cape Woolamai while taking photos for social media.

===Motorsport===

Phillip Island is steeped in the history of Australian motor racing. A temporary circuit utilizing the island&#x27;s interior public roads was used for the inaugural Australian Grand Prix in 1928 and continued to be used for the race up until 1935. Racing on public road circuits continued through to 1940. In 1952 the Phillip Island Auto Racing Club was formed and commenced construction on the permanent Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit which opened in 1956. In 1960, the inaugural Armstrong 500 was held, although, with the bridge to the mainland unable to support heavy hotmix bitumen equipment, the track broke up during the third running of the race in 1962. The damage rendered the circuit unusable for racing and for 1963 the Armstrong 500 was relocated to the Mount Panorama Circuit and over time evolved into what is known today as the Bathurst 1000.

The circuit was refurbished and was reopened in October 1967. It was closed in 1978, but was redeveloped and re-opened in 1988 and the following year hosted the first international version of the Australian motorcycle Grand Prix. It continues to host the race today and is also a venue for rounds of the Superbike World Championship, the MotoGP Championship, the V8 Supercars Championship and the Australian Drivers&#x27; Championship.

<text>In the human skull, the frontal bone or sincipital bone is a unpaired bone which consists of two portions. These are the vertically oriented squamous part, and the horizontally oriented orbital part, making up the bony part of the forehead, part of the bony orbital cavity holding the eye, and part of the bony part of the nose respectively. The name comes from the Latin word &quot;frons&quot; (meaning &quot;forehead&quot;).

== Structure ==
The frontal bone is made up of two main parts. These are the squamous part, and the orbital part. The squamous part marks the vertical, flat, and also the biggest part, and the main region of the forehead. The orbital part is the horizontal and second biggest region of the frontal bone. It enters into the formation of the roofs of the orbital and nasal cavities. Sometimes a third part is included as the nasal part of the frontal bone, and sometimes this is included with the squamous part. The nasal part is between the brow ridges, and ends in a serrated nasal notch that articulates with the nasal bones inferiorly, and with the lacrimal and maxilla bones laterally.

== Borders ==
The border of the squamous part is thick, strongly serrated, bevelled at the expense of the inner table above, where it rests upon the parietal bones, and at the expense of the outer table on either side, where it receives the lateral pressure of those bones; this border is continued below into a triangular, rough surface, which articulates with the great wing of the sphenoid. The posterior borders of the orbital plates are thin and serrated, and articulate with the small wings of the sphenoid.
== Development ==
The frontal bone is presumed to be derived from neural crest cells.

The frontal bone is ossified in membrane from two primary centers, one for each half, which appear toward the end of the second month of fetal life, one above each supraorbital margin. From each of these centers, ossification extends upward to form the corresponding half of the squama, and backwards to form the orbital plate. The spine is ossified from a pair of secondary centers, on either side of the middle line; similar centers appear in the nasal part and zygomatic processes.

At birth the bone consists of two pieces, separated by the frontal suture, which is usually obliterated by Intramembranous ossification, except at its lower part, by the eighth year, but occasionally persists throughout life. It is generally maintained that the development of the frontal sinuses begins at the end of the first or beginning of the second year, but may begin at birth. The sinuses are of considerable size by the seventh or eighth year, but do not attain their full proportions until after puberty.

== Other animals ==
In most vertebrates, the frontal bone is paired, rather than presenting the single, fused structure found in humans (see frontal suture). It typically lies on the upper part of the head, between the eyes, but in many non-mammalian animals it does not form part of the orbital cavity. Instead, in reptiles, bony fish and amphibians it is often separated from the orbits by one or two additional bones not found in mammals. These bones, the prefrontals and postfrontals, together form the upper margin of the eye sockets, and lie to either side of the frontal bones.

=== Dinosaurs ===
The frontal bone is one of the principal paired mid-line bones in dinosaur skulls. This bone is part of the skull roof, which is a set of bones that cover the brain, eyes and nostrils. The frontal makes contact with several other bones in the skull. The anterior part of the bone articulates with the nasal bone and the prefrontal bone. The posterior part of the bone articulates with the postorbital bone and the parietal bone. This bone defines all of part of the upper margin of the orbit.

<text>The national flag of the Republic of Korea, also known as the Taegeukgi (), has three parts: a white rectangular background, a red and blue &quot;taegeuk&quot; in its center, accompanied by four black trigrams, one in each corner. The predecessors to the current &quot;Taegeukgi&quot; were used as the national flag of Korea by the Joseon dynasty, the Korean Empire, as well as the Korean government-in-exile during Japanese rule. South Korea adopted &quot;Taegeukgi&quot; for its national flag in 1948.

==History==
In 1876, the absence of a national flag became an issue for Korea, at the time reigned over by the Joseon dynasty. Before 1876, Korea did not have a national flag, but the king had his own royal standard. The lack of a national flag became a quandary during negotiations for the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876, at which the delegate of Japan displayed the Japanese national flag, whereas the Joseon dynasty had no corresponding national symbol to exhibit. At that time, some proposed to create a national flag, but the Joseon government looked upon the matter as unimportant and unnecessary. By 1880, the proliferation of foreign negotiations led to the need for a national flag. The most popular proposal was described in the &quot;Korea Strategy&quot; papers, written by the Chinese delegate Huang Zunxian. It proffered to incorporate the flag of the Qing dynasty of China into that of the Joseon dynasty of Korea. In response to the Chinese proposal, the Joseon government dispatched delegate Lee Young-Sook to consider the scheme with Chinese statesman and diplomat Li Hongzhang. Li agreed with some elements of Huang&#x27;s suggestion while accepting that Korea would make some alterations. The Qing government assented to Li&#x27;s conclusions, but the degree of enthusiasm with which the Joseon government explored this proposal is unknown.

The issue remained unpursued for a period but reemerged with the negotiation of the United States–Korea Treaty of 1882, also known as the Shufeldt Treaty. The U.S. emissary Robert Wilson Shufeldt suggested that Korea adopt a national flag to represent its sovereignty. The king of Joseon, Kojong, ordered government officials and Kim Hong-jip to begin working on a new flag. Kim Hong-jip in turn asked delegate to create the first design, which Lee Eung-jun presented to the Chinese official Ma Jianzhong. Ma Jianzhong argued against Huang Zunxian&#x27;s proposal that Korea adopt the flag of the Qing dynasty, and proposed a modified dragon flag. Kojong rejected this idea. Ma suggested Lee Eung-jun&#x27;s &quot;Taegeuk&quot; and Eight Trigrams flag. It is sometimes claimed that Kim and Ma proposed changes to it on 27 May 1882 (Lunar date April 11): Kim proposed changing the red to blue and white; Ma proposed a white field, a red and black &quot;taegeuk&quot;, trigrams in black, and a red border. However, since the Taguk flag was already in use during the signing of the Joseon–United States Treaty of 1882 on 22 May 1882, The Taeguk flag design was already established and in use prior to Ma&#x27;s proposal. On 14 May 1882, Park Yeong-hyo presented a scale model for &quot;taegukgi&quot; to the Joseon government, it was created in cooperate with Kim Ok-gyun and others with advice from British consul William George Aston and British captain James, later Gojong approved the design. Park Yeong-hyo became the first person to use the &quot;taegukgi&quot; in 1882. The 2 October 1882 issue of the Japanese newspaper &quot;&quot; credited Gojong as the designer of the &quot;taegukgi&quot; (i.e., a flag with a red and blue &quot;taegeuk&quot; and four trigrams). On 27 January 1883, the Joseon government officially promulgated the &quot;taegukgi&quot; to be used as the official national flag.

In 1919, a flag similar to the current South Korean flag was used by the Korean government-in-exile based in China. The term &quot;taegukgi&quot; began to use in 1942. The &quot;taeguk&quot; and &quot;taegukgi&quot; grew as a powerful symbols of independence in the 1,500 demonstrations during colonial rule.

Following the restoration of Korean independence in 1945, &quot;taegukgi&quot; designs was again widely used, it remained in use as the southern portion of Korea became a republic under the influence of the United States and even in the People&#x27;s Republic of Korea for a time. The United States Army Military Government in Korea started to use &quot;taegukgi&quot; alongside the flag of the United States on 14 January 1946. On 12 July 1948, the Constituent National Assembly of the Republic of Korea adopted &quot;taegukgi&quot; as national flag. Following the establishment of the South Korean state in August 1948, the first Republic of Korea created the National Flag Correction Committee in January 1949 to establish the modern standardization for &quot;taegukgi&quot;. On 15 October 1949, the Ministry of Education and Culture announced &quot;National Flag Production Law&quot;.

The northern portion of Korea also used the &quot;taegukgi&quot; even in the partition of Korea in 1945. It was used until the new design was adopted in September 1948.

On 21 February 1984, exact dimensional specifications and etiquettes for the flag were codified. In October 1997, a precise color scheme for the flag was fixed via presidential decree for the first time.

==Symbolism==
The flag&#x27;s field is white, a traditional color in Korean culture that was common in the daily attire of 19th-century Koreans and still appears in contemporary versions of traditional Korean garments such as the hanbok. The color represents peace and purity.

The circle in the flag&#x27;s center symbolizes harmony in the world. Derived from the Chinese &quot;I Ching&quot; and Taiji (philosophy), known in the west as the Yin and Yang, the blue half represents negative energy (Yin), and the red half represents the positive energy (Yang).

Together, the trigrams represent movement and harmony as fundamental principles. Each trigram represents one of the four classical elements, as described below:
===Cultural role in contemporary South Korean society===
The name of the South Korean flag is used in the title of a 2004 film about the Korean War, &quot;Taegukgi&quot;.

A Taegukgi with the word appeared in a 2011 film &quot;My Way&quot;.

A Taegukgi with the word appeared in a stage musical &quot;Hero&quot;.

Observers such as &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;″s Colin Marshall and Korea scholar Brian Reynolds Myers have noted that the South Korean flag in the context of the country&#x27;s society is often used as an ethnic flag, representing a grander nationalistic idea of a racialized (Korean) people rather than merely symbolizing the (South Korean) state itself as national flags do in other countries. Myers argues that: &quot;When the average [South Korean] man sees the [South Korean] flag, he feels fraternity with [ethnic] Koreans around the world.&quot; Myers also stated in a 2011 thesis that: &quot;Judging from the yin-yang flag&#x27;s universal popularity in South Korea, even among those who deny the legitimacy of the Republic of Korea, it evidently evokes the [Korean] race first and the [South Korean] state second.&quot;

====Desecration====
The South Korean flag is considered by a large part of the country&#x27;s citizens to represent the &quot;Korean race&quot; rather than solely the South Korean state; consequently flag desecration by the country&#x27;s citizens is rare when compared to other countries, where citizens may desecrate their own national flags as political statements. Thus those South Korean citizens opposed to the state&#x27;s actions or even its existence will still treat their national flag with reverence and respect: &quot;There is therefore none of the parodying or deliberate desecration of the state flag that one encounters in the countercultures of other countries.&quot;

Regardless of frequency, the South Korean &quot;Criminal Act&quot; punishes desecration of the South Korean national flag in various ways:

*Article 105 imposes up to 5 years in prison, disfranchisement of up to 10 years, or a fine up to 7 million South Korean won for damaging, removing, or staining a South Korean flag or emblem with intent to insult the South Korean state. Article 5 makes this crime punishable, even if done by aliens outside South Korea.
*Article 106 imposes up to 1 year in prison, disfranchisement of up to 5 years, or a fine up to 2 million South Korean won for defaming a South Korean flag or emblem with intent to insult the South Korean state. Article 5 makes this crime punishable, even if done by aliens outside South Korea.

South Korea also criminalizes not just desecration of the South Korean flag, but the flags of other countries as well:

*Article 109 imposes up to 2 years in prison or a fine up to 3 million South Korean won for damaging, removing, or staining a foreign flag or emblem with intent to insult a foreign country. Article 110 forbids prosecution without foreign governmental complaint.

==Specifications==
===Dimensions===
The width and height are in the ratio of 3:2. There are five sections on the flag, the &quot;taegeuk&quot; and the four groups of bars (trigrams). The diameter of the &quot;taegeuk&quot; is half of the height of the flag. The top of the &quot;taegeuk&quot; is red and the bottom of the &quot;taegeuk&quot; is blue. The width of each trigram is the radius of the &quot;taegeuk&quot;. The distance between &quot;taegeuk&quot; and four trigrams is half of the radius of the &quot;taegeuk&quot;. The design of the &quot;taegeuk&quot;, as well as the trigrams residing in each of the four corners, are geometrically defined.

===Colors===

The colors of the &quot;taegukgi&quot; are specified in the &quot;Ordinance Act of the Law concerning the National Flag of the Republic of Korea&quot; (). The color scheme was unspecified until 1997, when the South Korean government decided to standardize specifications for the flag. On 25 October 1997, a Presidential ordinance on the standard specification of the South Korean flag was promulgated, and that specification was acceded by the &quot;National Flag Law&quot; in July 2007.

Colors are defined in legislation by the Munsell and CIE color systems as follows:

<text>Warragul is a town in Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne. Warragul lies between the Strzelecki Ranges to the south and the Mount Baw Baw Plateau of the Great Dividing Range to the north. As of the , the town had a population of 19,856 people. Warragul forms part of a larger urban area that includes nearby Drouin that had an estimated total population of 42,827 as of the .

Warragul is the main population and service centre of the West Gippsland region and the Shire of Baw Baw. The surrounding area is noted for dairy farming and other niche agriculture and has long been producing gourmet foods.

==Naming==

Warragul (or warrigal, worrigle, warragal) is a New South Wales Indigenous word from the Darug language meaning &quot;dingo&quot;. The town name is accepted to mean &quot;wild dog&quot; and various businesses in the town use the words &#x27;Wild Dog&#x27; in their name.

However, the word was recorded as being used by settlers of Gippsland in the 1840s and 1850s to mean &quot;wild Aboriginal&quot; or a Gunai/Kurnai person. The traditional land of the Gunai/Kurnai people includes the town of Warragul, then intersects with Boonwurrung territory to the west of the town. 

In 1851, British botanist Daniel Bunce recorded warragul as a Boonwurrung language word meaning &quot;wild&quot;, &quot;ferocious&quot; and &quot;enemy&quot;. P D Gardner suggests Bunce was correct in translation, but incorrect in origin, since the word comes from Darug. Hugh Copeland wrote in his 1934 history of Warragul that the place name was an Indigenous word meaning &quot;wild&quot;.

The word is also used for the naming of Warrigal Creek in South Gippsland to refer to the inhabitants of the area.

==History==
The town of Warragul began as a construction camp on McLeod&#x27;s Track, now Brandy Creek Road, at the point where the surveyed railway line linked to the coach road. John Lardner surveyed the townships along the line in 1877 and noted that the early arrivals in the area were squatters, who had erected their shops and dwellings on Crown land. The squatters&#x27; blocks were not offered for the first sale of town land on 2 March 1878, but were available to purchase on the second sale later that month.

In November 1873, The Victorian Parliament passed an Act approving the construction of a railway linking Oakleigh to Sale. The construction of the Gippsland railway line began simultaneously from both directions. The Warragul railway station opened on 1 March 1878 and the first train ran through in the same month. In May 1890 Warragul railway station became a junction station when a branch line was opened to Rokeby (later extended to Neerim South and Noojee).

The first Warragul post office opened on 16 March 1877 at the general store operated by James Biram, who became the first postmaster. A contract to build an official post office was made on 4 April 1887 and a foundation stone was laid on 4 June 1887. The building was completed and occupied the following year. Warragul&#x27;s modern post office was opened on 3 April 1967, after the old post office closed on 18 September 1965 and was demolished in 1966.

Existing roads were renamed Princes Highway after the visit to Australia in 1920 of the then Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII). The highway was officially opened on 10 August 1920 at a ceremony in Warragul.

Warragul&#x27;s Petersville Milk Products Factory in Queen Street supplied the famous Peters Ice Cream brand&#x27;s factory in Mulgrave with all the dairy raw material (fresh cream and concentrated skim milk) for 35 years. The plant also manufactured skim milk powder under the famous Dutch Jug brand and butter under the Iceberg brand. It exported butter, butter oil and milk powders to Southeast Asia and the Middle East.

Warragul was voted Premier Town in Victoria, 1970–1973.

The Warragul Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 January 1990.

==Geography==
Warragul is located on hills that extend north from the Strzelecki Ranges near Ellinbank, joining to the Baw Baws in the Neerim District. This range is historically referred to as the Warragul Hills. The range effectively separates the flatlands of the Koo-Wee-Rup swamp (starting near Longwarry) in the west and the Moe Swamp on the eastern side (starting near Darnum).

Warragul contains the Linear Park Arts Discovery Trail, a trail covering several adjacent parks in the town. It features painted bollards, mosaics and murals. The trail joins up with the Drouin to Warragul Two Towns Trail.

== Climate ==
Warragul has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), with warm summers and cool, rainy winters. Average maxima vary from in February to in July, while average minima fluctuate between in February and in July. Precipitation is moderately abundant: (averaging per annum), and is frequent (spread between 153.9 precipitation days). Consequently, the town is not sunny, experiencing 171.4 cloudy days and only 52.6 clear days annually. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 25 February 1968 to on 4 July 1963.

==Events==
Warragul is the major township closest to Lardner, the home of the Gippsland Field Days. Three major events are held at Lardner Park each year—the Farm World agricultural show, Trucks in Action, and Harvest of Gippsland. The Farm World agricultural show is a major drawcard for the Warragul area. Every year in late March, Warragul plays host to these Field Days at Lardner Park. The Field Days are Australia&#x27;s premier mixed farming Field Days and they include one of Australia&#x27;s most diverse ranges of beef cattle, dairying and horticulture exhibits. 

Warragul is also home to the annual Warragul Show, which is held on the first Friday of March each year. It is traditionally a farming and livestock show, but includes rides, stalls, games, fireworks and showbags. It is held at the Warragul showgrounds.

==Education==
For a town of its size, Warragul has a large education industry with four primary schools, three secondary schools and two tertiary institutions.

<text>OpenDX stands for Open Data Explorer and is IBM&#x27;s scientific data visualization software. It can handle complex domains (such as a mechanical gear or a human brain) along with measured or computed data. The data may be scalar (such as the concentration of a chemical agent in the brain), vector or tensor fields (like the displacement or strain tensor fields when the gear is in action) at different points of the object. The points at which data is measured don&#x27;t have to be equally spaced and not need to be homogeneously spaced. The project started in 1991 as &quot;Visualization Data Explorer&quot;.
&quot;OpenDX&quot; can produce 3D images with the quantities plotted as color or gray-scale coded, or as vectors, streamlines and ribbons. It allows the object to be sliced to obtain a view of the internal structure, and then represent the data on this slice plane as a height-coded graph. It can rotate the object to provide a view of the data from any angle and allows animations of this motion to be made.

== Graphical user interface ==

&quot;OpenDX&quot; is based on the Motif widget toolkit on top of the X Window System. Its graphical user interface has a wide variety of interactors, both direct and indirect. Direct interactors allow the user to directly manipulate images (e.g. rotate or zoom). Indirect interactors (dials, switches, buttons, sliders) enable the user to control various aspects of her visualization. Interactors are &quot;smarter&quot; because they are data-driven. Interactors are auto-ranging and self-limiting. They examine the data and, depending on its type, will determine the minimum and maximum of the data, or create a list for an option menu based on the data. The user can even set the label of the interactor based on some aspect of the data (e.g., metadata).

The data-driven concept is not simply for sliders, dials and option menus. It also applies to vector interactors. These reconfigure themselves based on the dimensionality of the data. They also auto-range themselves based on the maximum and minimum of each vector component.

== Design ==

Data Explorer is a system of tools and user interfaces for visualizing data. In general terms the visualization of data can be considered a 3-stage process:

* Describing and importing data
* Processing the data through a visualization program
* Presenting the resulting image.

The principal components of OpenDX are

; Data model: This is the set of definitions, rules, and conventions used to describe Data Explorer entities (including data fields, geometrical objects, and images).

; Data Prompter: A user interface for describing data to be imported into Data Explorer.

; Data Browser: A user interface for viewing a data file, determining the layout and organization of the data it contains, and transferring this information to the Data Prompter.

; Scripting Language: A high-level language for creating visualization programs. It can also be used directly in a command mode to perform various tasks. Visual programs—i.e., the visualization programs displayed in the Visual Program Editor window as &quot;networks&quot; of module icons—are also written in the scripting language. A visual program constructed in this window by the user is translated into the same language when it is saved to disk.

; Visual Program Editor (VPE): A graphical user interface for creating and modifying visual programs (networks). Programs created with this editor are translated into the scripting language by Data Explorer and are stored in that form.

; Modules: The &quot;building blocks&quot; (visualization &quot;tools&quot;) that constitute a visual program network. They can be directly accessed and manipulated in the &quot;Visual Program Editor&quot;.

; Module Builder: A user interface for creating customized modules to be used in visual programs.

; Image Window: An interactive window for viewing and modifying the presentation of the image produced by a visual program.

; Control Panels: A user interface for changing the parameter values used by a visual program.

== Screen shots ==

=== Visualization of a scalar field ===

In this example we show the visualization of the flow of a particulated material (dust) inside a building. In this case the quantity visualized is a scalar, namely the concentration of the particles. The concentration of particles at each point in space is represented using colors. The reader can deduce the concentration by comparing the colors with the &quot;colorbar&quot; at the right upper corner of the image. To improve the visualization the drawing is shadowed as if it had an elevation in the direction normal to the plane proportional to the concentration. In OpenDX this is called the &quot;rubber-sheet&quot; effect.

=== Visualization of vector fields ===

Vector fields are harder to visualize than scalar ones. Consider in this case
the flow in a cubic cavity (the 3D version of the well studied
square cavity benchmark. The use of streamlines helps in realizing the direction of the flow. The &quot;rockets&quot; (the big red arrows on the top of the cavity) represent the imposed flow.

<doc id="312075" wikidata="Q841737" url="?curid=312075" title="Family Research Council">
<text>The Family Research Council (FRC) is an American evangelical 501(c)(3) non-profit activist group and think-tank with an affiliated lobbying organization. FRC promotes what it considers to be family values. It opposes and lobbies against access to pornography, embryonic stem-cell research, abortion, divorce, and LGBT rights—such as anti-discrimination laws, same-sex marriage, same-sex civil unions, and LGBT adoption. The FRC has been criticized by media sources and professional organizations such as the American Sociological Association for using &quot;anti-gay pseudoscience&quot; to falsely conflate homosexuality and pedophilia, and to falsely claim that the children of same-sex parents suffer from more mental health problems.

FRC was formed in the United States in 1981 by James Dobson and incorporated in 1983. In the late 1980s, FRC officially became a division of Dobson&#x27;s main organization, Focus on the Family; however, after an administrative separation, FRC became an independent entity in 1992. Tony Perkins is its current president. FRC is affiliated with a lobbying PAC known as FRC Action, of which Josh Duggar was the executive director from 2013 until 2015.

The FRC is active outside of the United States; in 2010, FRC paid $25,000 to congressional lobbyists for what they described as &quot;Res.1064 Ugandan Resolution Pro-homosexual promotion&quot; in a lobbying disclosure report. Uganda would go on to pass the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill, a bill which would have imposed either the death penalty or life imprisonment for sexual relations between persons of the same sex. On 1 August 2014, however, the Constitutional Court of Uganda ruled the act invalid on procedural grounds.

In 2010, the Southern Poverty Law Center classified FRC as an anti-LGBT hate group due to what it says are the group&#x27;s &quot;false claims about the LGBT community based on discredited research and junk science&quot; in an effort to block LGBT civil rights. In 2012, the FRC&#x27;s headquarters were attacked by a gunman, resulting in an injury to a security guard, in connection with this designation.

==History==
The Council was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 1983. James Dobson, Armand Nicholi Jr., and George Rekers were some of its founding board members. In 1988, following financial difficulties, FRC was incorporated into Focus on the Family, and Gary Bauer joined the organization as president. FRC remained under the Focus on the Family umbrella until 1992, when it separated out of concern for Focus&#x27; tax-exempt status. Tony Perkins joined FRC as its president in 2003.

On June 18, 2013, Josh Duggar was named executive director of FRC Action, the non-profit and tax-exempt legislative action arm of Family Research Council. Duggar resigned his position on May 21, 2015, after his history of sexual misconduct as a minor became public.

===2012 shooting===
On August 15, 2012, Floyd Lee Corkins II, a resident of nearby Herndon, Virginia, entered the lobby of the FRC&#x27;s Washington, D.C. headquarters with a 9mm pistol and two magazines with 50 rounds of ammunition. Corkins shot an unarmed security guard, 46-year-old Leonardo Johnson, in the left arm. Although injured, Johnson assisted others who wrestled Corkins to the ground until police arrived and placed him under arrest. &quot;Politico&quot; reported that &quot;Corkins was carrying 15 Chick-fil-A sandwiches that he intended to smear on employees’ faces in a political statement, he told the FBI.&quot;

The FBI and the Metropolitan Police Department investigated jointly &quot;to determine motive/intent and whether a hate crime/terrorism nexus exists.&quot; During his FBI interview, Corkins was asked how he chose his target. His response was &quot;Southern Poverty Law lists anti-gay groups. I found them online.&quot; Corkins had told Johnson &quot;words to the effect of &#x27;I don&#x27;t like your politics. Corkins had served as a volunteer at an LGBT community center.

In January 2013, Corkins pleaded guilty to two charges in the District of Columbia, possession of a handgun during a violent crime and assault with intent to kill, and interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition, a federal charge. He was found mentally ill and, in September 2013, was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

On the day of the shooting, the SPLC, along with a joint statement of 25 LGBT groups, condemned Corkins&#x27; action. The National Organization for Marriage, an active campaigner against same-sex marriage, issued a statement saying &quot;Today&#x27;s attack is the clearest sign we&#x27;ve seen that labeling pro-marriage groups as &#x27;hateful&#x27; must end&quot;.

FRC president Tony Perkins issued a public statement calling the shooting &quot;an act of domestic terrorism&quot; and criticizing the Southern Poverty Law Center for being &quot;reckless in labeling organizations as hate groups because they disagree with them on public policy.&quot; SPLC spokesman Mark Potok called Perkins&#x27; accusation &quot;outrageous&quot;, and in a statement said: &quot;The FRC and its allies on the religious right are saying, in effect, that offering legitimate and fact-based criticism in a democratic society is tantamount to suggesting that the objects of criticism should be the targets of criminal violence.&quot; Potok posted that &quot;The SPLC has listed the FRC as a hate group since 2010 because it has knowingly spread false and denigrating propaganda about LGBT people — not, as some claim, because it opposes same-sex marriage.&quot;

==Politics, policies and positions==

Tony Perkins has blamed the constitutional separation of church and state for encouraging the rise of ISIS and similar Islamic extremist groups.

The FRC has opposed efforts to make the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine mandatory for school attendance. HPV is a virus that can be transmitted by sexual contact, that can cause cervical cancer. FRC defends its position on the basis of the rights of parents and because of its support for abstinence prior to marriage.

It supports a federal conscience clause, allowing medical workers to refuse to provide certain treatments to their patients, such as abortion or birth control. It also advocates for abstinence-only sex education, intelligent design, prayer in public schools and the regulation of pornography and other &quot;obscene, indecent, or profane programming&quot; on broadcast and cable television. It unsuccessfully opposed the introduction of an .xxx domain name and lobbied for an increase in indecency fines from the Federal Communications Commission. The group holds that hotel pornography may be prosecutable under federal and state obscenity laws. It opposed the expansion of civil rights laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity as illegal bases for discrimination.

Family Research Council supports the requirement of a one-year waiting period before a married couple with children can legally get a divorce so that they can receive marital counseling, unless the marriage involves domestic violence. FRC also supports permanently eliminating the marriage penalty and estate taxes.

The Council opposes legalized abortion, stem-cell research which involves the destruction of human embryos and funding thereof. (It advocates for research solely using adult stem cells.) It opposes legal recognition of same-sex domestic partnerships in the form of marriage or civil unions. It has opposed all forms of gambling. The Council has questioned whether humans are mainly or completely responsible for climate change, and has opposed other evangelicals who accepted the scientific consensus on it.

===Statements on homosexuality===
The FRC maintains that &quot;homosexual conduct is harmful to the persons who engage in it and to society at large, and can never be affirmed&quot;, and asserts that it is &quot;by definition unnatural, and as such is associated with negative physical and psychological health effects.&quot; The Council also asserts that &quot;there is no convincing evidence that a homosexual identity is ever something genetic or inborn&quot;. These positions are in opposition to the consensus of mainstream psychological and medical experts that homosexuality is a normal, healthy variation of human behavior, and that sexual orientation is generally not chosen.

Certain FRC statements and positions have been criticized as based upon pseudo/junk science; according to &quot;Wired&quot;, the group has misrepresented data and mis-designed sociological studies in order to negatively depict LGBT people.

FRC also states that &quot;[s]ympathy must be extended to those who struggle with unwanted same-sex attractions, and every effort should be made to assist such persons to overcome those attractions, as many already have&quot;. Evidence on the effectiveness of sexual orientation change efforts is limited; according to a 2009 publication from the American Psychological Association, &quot;[there] are no studies of adequate scientific rigor to conclude whether or not recent [sexual orientation change efforts] do or do not work to change a person&#x27;s sexual orientation.&quot;

In 2012, Rob Schwartzwalder, then a senior vice president at FRC, wrote: &quot;To love people who identify as gays or lesbians means to extend grace to them: to welcome them as friends, to care for them when ill, and to respect them as persons whose creation was ordained by the God of the universe and for whom the Son of God died. Such love will oppose attempts to legalize homosexual marriage, as to do so would vindicate a corruption of that which God intended. ...To love homosexuals means that believing churches cannot accept those practicing or advocating homosexuality as members, ministers, or leaders any more than persons living in any other kind of sexual sin.&quot;

Jointly with Focus on the Family, the Council submitted an &quot;amicus&quot; brief in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court case in which anti-sodomy laws were ruled unconstitutional on privacy grounds. The summary of the &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief declares that &quot;[states] may discourage the &#x27;evils&#x27; ... of sexual acts outside of marriage by means up to and including criminal prohibition&quot; and that it is constitutionally permissible for Texas to &quot;choose to protect marital intimacy by prohibiting same-sex &#x27;deviate&#x27; acts&quot;.

Similar positions have been advocated by representatives of the organization since &quot;Lawrence&quot; was decided in 2003. In February 2010, Family Research Council&#x27;s senior researcher for policy studies, Peter Sprigg, stated on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Hardball&quot; that same-sex behavior should be outlawed and that &quot;criminal sanctions against homosexual behavior&quot; should be enforced. Three months later, in May 2010, Sprigg publicly suggested that repealing the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell policy would encourage molestation of heterosexual service members.

In November 2010, Perkins was asked about Sprigg&#x27;s comments regarding the criminalization of same-sex behavior: he responded that criminalizing homosexuality is not a goal of Family Research Council. Perkins repeated FRC&#x27;s association of homosexuals with pedophilia, stating: &quot;If you look at the American College of Pediatricians, they say the research is overwhelming that homosexuality poses a danger to children.&quot; Perkins&#x27; statements have been contradicted by mainstream social science research, and the likelihood of child molestation by homosexuals and bisexuals has been found to be no higher than child molestation by heterosexuals; as &quot;Newsweek&quot; put it, &quot;[f]or decades, the [FRC] has smeared homosexuals in its publications, insinuating that gay people are more likely to sexually abuse children&quot; and an analysis by John Aravosis concluded that FRC &quot;cherry-picks and distorts evidence as part of a deliberate campaign to smear the LGBT community.&quot; Some scientists whose work is cited by the socially conservative group the American College of Pediatricians – which was created following the American Academy of Pediatrics&#x27; endorsement of adoption by same-sex couples and to which FRC points for evidence supporting its positions – have said the organization has distorted or misrepresented their work and the organization has been criticized by &quot;Psychology Today&quot; for making &quot;false statements ... that have the potential to harm LGBT youth&quot;. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) designated the FRC as a hate group in its Winter 2010 &quot;Intelligence Report&quot;. &quot;Mother Jones&quot; reported that &quot;The Southern Poverty Law Center&#x27;s classification of FRC as a hate group stems from FRC&#x27;s more than decade-long insistence that gay people are more likely to molest children. ...Research from non-ideological outfits is actually firm in concluding the opposite.&quot;

In 2017, at the council-sponsored Values Voter Summit, a tote bag was distributed to all attendees that included a copy of a flyer entitled &quot;The Health Hazards of Homosexuality&quot; written by MassResistance, which the SPLC has also designated as a hate group.

An &quot;amicus&quot; brief submitted in relation to &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; (which struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act) argued that DOMA did not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, and their &quot;amicus&quot; brief in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; argued against same-sex marriage. An article written by Travis Weber, the director of the Council&#x27;s Center for Religious Liberty, was highly critical of both Supreme Court decisions.

===Same-sex marriage cases===
The FRC, on January 28, 2013, issued an &quot;amicus&quot; brief in support of the Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act cases before the Supreme Court, arguing for the court to uphold DOMA banning federal recognition of same-sex unions and Proposition 8 banning gay marriage in California. On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; that the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutionally deprived gay and lesbian couples of liberty, and in &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; that Proposition 8&#x27;s proponents had no standing to defend the law, leaving in place a lower-court ruling overturning the ban.

=== Project 2025 ===
FRC is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a collection of conservative and right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power should the Republican nominee win the 2024 presidential election.

==Publishing and lobbying activities==

Family Research Council is a member of ProtectMarriage.com, a coalition formed to sponsor California Proposition 8 to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples only, which passed in 2008 (but was later struck down as unconstitutional by a federal court in California).

The Council publishes &quot;The Washington Stand&quot;, a periodical of news and commentary from the council&#x27;s perspective.

===Justice Sunday===

Justice Sunday was the name for three religious conferences organized by FRC and Focus on the Family in 2005 and 2006. According to FRC, the purpose of the events was to &quot;request an end to filibusters of judicial nominees that were based, at least in part, on the nominees&#x27; religious views or imputed inability to decide cases on the basis of the law regardless of their beliefs.&quot;

===Pray Vote Stand Summit===

Every fall, FRC Action (the political action group affiliated with FRC) holds an annual summit composed for conservative Christian activists and evangelical voters in Washington, D.C. The summit has been a place for social conservatives across the nation to hear Republican presidential hopefuls&#x27; platforms. Since 2007 a straw poll has been taken as a means of providing an early prediction of which candidate will win the endorsement of Christian conservatives.

===Ugandan Resolution===
In 2010, FRC paid $25,000 to congressional lobbyists for what they described as &quot;Res.1064 Ugandan Resolution Pro-homosexual promotion&quot; in a lobbying disclosure report. The US House of Representatives resolution condemned the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill, a bill which, among other things, would have imposed either the death penalty or life imprisonment for sexual relations between persons of the same sex.

Following exposure of the lobbying contribution in June 2010, FRC issued a statement denying that they were trying to kill the bill, but rather that they wanted to change the language of the bill &quot;to remove sweeping and inaccurate assertions that homosexual conduct is internationally recognized as a fundamental human right.&quot; They further stated, &quot;FRC does not support the Uganda bill, and does not support the death penalty for homosexuality – nor any other penalty which would have the effect of inhibiting compassionate pastoral, psychological, and medical care and treatment for those who experience same-sex attractions or who engage in homosexual conduct&quot;. The Ugandan Resolution was revived by Uganda&#x27;s President Museveni in 2012. On 1 August 2014, however, the Constitutional Court of Uganda ruled the act invalid on procedural grounds.

The FRC used one of Museveni&#x27;s speeches in an e-mail to its supporters praising Uganda&#x27;s commitment to Christian faith and &quot;national repentance&quot; around the time that he reintroduced the Anti-Homosexuality Bill. The speech did not refer to homosexuality specifically, but did mention &quot;sexual immorality&quot; among the sins for which Ugandans must repent.

==Controversies and criticism==
===2010 listing as a hate group by SPLC===
The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) designated FRC as a hate group in the winter 2010 issue of its magazine, &quot;Intelligence Report&quot;. Aside from statements made earlier in the year by Sprigg and Perkins (see Statements on homosexuality), the SPLC described FRC as a &quot;font of anti-gay propaganda throughout its history&quot;.

As evidence, the SPLC cited a 1999 publication by FRC, &quot;Homosexual Activists Work to Normalize Sex With Boys&quot;, which stated: &quot;one of the primary goals of the homosexual rights movement is to abolish all age of consent laws and to eventually recognize pedophiles as the &#x27;prophets&#x27; of a new sexual order.&quot; The report said FRC senior research fellows Tim Dailey and Peter Sprigg (2001) had &quot;pushed false accusations linking gay men to pedophilia&quot;.

FRC President Tony Perkins called the &quot;hate&quot; designation a political attack on FRC by a &quot;liberal organization&quot;. On December 15, 2010, FRC ran an open letter as an advertisement in two Washington, D.C., newspapers disputing the SPLC&#x27;s action; in a press release, FRC called the allegation &quot;intolerance pure and simple&quot; and said it was dedicated to upholding &quot;Judeo-Christian moral views, including marriage as the union of a man and a woman&quot;. In response, SPLC spokesman Mark Potok emphasized the factual evidence upon which the SPLC had taken the step of making the designation.

A shooting incident in the lobby of FRC headquarters in 2012 (see above) prompted further comments on the SPLC&#x27;s &#x27;hate group&#x27; listing. Dana Milbank, columnist for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, referred to the incident as &quot;a madman&#x27;s act&quot; for which the SPLC should not be blamed, but called its classification of FRC as a hate group &quot;reckless&quot; and said that &quot;it&#x27;s absurd to put the group, as the law center does, in the same category as Aryan Nations, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Stormfront and the Westboro Baptist Church.&quot; David Sessions, writing for &quot;the Daily Beast&quot;, noted that FRC&#x27;s hostile, false depiction of LGBT people invited strong pushback; &quot;the FRC cannot wage an all-out rhetorical war against the &#x27;gay agenda&#x27; and then accuse its critics of being too harsh.&quot;

Tufts University political science professor Jeffrey Berry described himself as &quot;not comfortable&quot; with the designation: &quot;There&#x27;s probably some things that have been said by one or two individuals that qualify as hate speech. But overall, it&#x27;s not seen as a hate group.&quot; Journalist Adam Serwer of &quot;Mother Jones&quot; argued that the description, while subjective, was justified by the &quot;FRC&#x27;s record of purveying stereotypes, prejudice, and junk science as a justification for public policy that would deny gays and lesbians equal rights and criminalize their conduct.&quot;

===Tax status===
In 2020, the FRC asked the IRS to consider it as an “association of churches,” and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approved that status change. As part of this request, the FRC had to claim that it conducts weddings, baptisms and funerals. The FRC continues to be a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, but as a church, it is shielded from public inspection as it no longer must submit an annual Form 990 to the IRS.

===George Alan Rekers===
George Rekers was a founding board member in 1983. In May 2010, Rekers employed a male prostitute as a travel companion for a two-week vacation in Europe. Rekers denied any inappropriate conduct and suggestions that he was gay. The male escort told CNN he had given Rekers &quot;sexual massages&quot; while traveling together in Europe. Rekers subsequently resigned from the board of the National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH).

===Josh Duggar===
On June 18, 2013, it was announced that Josh Duggar of the television show &quot;19 Kids and Counting&quot; would serve as the executive director of FRC Action, the non-profit and tax-exempt legislative action arm of Family Research Council. FRC President Tony Perkins said at the time that the hiring was aimed to tap into the popularity of Duggar&#x27;s television show, and that &quot;The big part of Josh&#x27;s focus is going to be building our grass-roots across the country.&quot; Published reports listed Duggar as a lobbyist for the group.

Duggar resigned on May 21, 2015, when a scandal involving his past molestation of five underage girls – including some of his sisters – became public knowledge. In reference to Duggar&#x27;s resignation, Perkins said &quot;Josh believes that the situation will make it difficult for him to be effective in his current work.&quot;

<text>A spike strip (also referred to as a spike belt, road spikes, traffic spikes, tire shredders, stingers, stop sticks, by the trademark Stinger or formally known as a Tire Deflation Device or TDD) is a device or incident weapon used to impede or stop the movement of wheeled vehicles by puncturing their tires. 

Generally, the strip is composed of a collection of metal , teeth or spikes pointing upward. The spikes are designed to puncture and flatten tires when a vehicle is driven over them; they may be portable, as a police weapon, or strongly secured to the ground, as those found at security checkpoint entrances in certain facilities. (These particular models, however, retract and do not cause damage when a vehicle drives over them from the proper direction.) They also may be detachable, with new spikes fitted to the strip after use. The spikes may be hollow or solid; hollow ones are designed to detach and become embedded in the tires, allowing air to escape at a steady rate to reduce the risk of the driver losing control and crashing. They are historically a development of the caltrop, with anti-cavalry and anti-personnel versions being used as early as 331 BC by Darius III against Alexander the Great at the Battle of Gaugamela in Persia.

In the United States, five officers were killed deploying spike strips in 2011, having been struck by fleeing vehicles. Dallas, Texas police are among those banned from using them, in response to the hazards.

Remotely deployable spike strips have been invented to reduce the danger to police officers deploying them.

Private possession of spike strips was banned in New South Wales, Australia in 2003 after a strip cheaply constructed from a steel pipe studded with nails was used against a police vehicle. John Watkins, a member of New South Wales Legislative Assembly, stated they would be added to the New South Wales prohibited weapons list.

Following the rise in terrorist vehicle attacks whereby a vehicle is driven at speed into pedestrians, a net with steel spikes that can be deployed by two people in less than a minute, reported able to stop a vehicle of up to 17 tonnes, was developed for preventive use at public events in the UK, with the name &quot;Talon&quot;. It has steel spikes to puncture tires, and becomes entangled around the front wheels, halting the vehicle. It is designed to reduce risk to crowds by making the vehicle skid in a straight line without veering unpredictably. It was first deployed to protect a parade on 11 September 2017.

<doc id="312080" wikidata="Q16298" url="?curid=312080" title="Parietal bone">
<text>The parietal bones ( ) are two bones in the skull which, when joined at a fibrous joint known as a cranial suture, form the sides and roof of the neurocranium. In humans, each bone is roughly quadrilateral in form, and has two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. It is named from the Latin &quot;paries&quot; (&quot;-ietis&quot;), wall.

== Surfaces ==

===External===
The external surface [Fig. 1] is convex, smooth, and marked near the center by an eminence, the parietal eminence (&quot;tuber parietale&quot;), which indicates the point where ossification commenced.

Crossing the middle of the bone in an arched direction are two curved lines, the superior and inferior temporal lines; the former gives attachment to the temporal fascia, and the latter indicates the upper limit of the muscular origin of the temporal muscle.

Above these lines the bone is covered by a tough layer of fibrous tissue – the epicranial aponeurosis; below them it forms part of the temporal fossa, and affords attachment to the temporal muscle.

At the back part and close to the upper or sagittal border is the parietal foramen which transmits a vein to the superior sagittal sinus, and sometimes a small branch of the occipital artery; it is not constantly present, and its size varies considerably.

===Internal===
The internal surface [Fig. 2] is concave; it presents depressions corresponding to the cerebral convolutions, and numerous furrows (grooves) for the ramifications of the middle meningeal artery; the latter run upward and backward from the sphenoidal angle, and from the central and posterior part of the squamous border.

Along the upper margin is a shallow groove, which, together with that on the opposite parietal, forms a channel, the sagittal sulcus, for the superior sagittal sinus; the edges of the sulcus afford attachment to the falx cerebri.

Near the groove are several depressions, best marked in the skulls of old persons, for the arachnoid granulations (Pacchionian bodies).

In the groove is the internal opening of the parietal foramen when that aperture exists.
== Borders ==
* The sagittal border, the longest and thickest, is dentated (has toothlike projections) and articulates with its fellow of the opposite side, forming the sagittal suture.
* The frontal border is deeply serrated, and bevelled at the expense of the outer surface above and of the inner below; it articulates with the frontal bone, forming half of the coronal suture. The point where the coronal suture intersects with the sagittal suture forms a T-shape and is called the bregma.
* The squamous border is divided into three parts: of these:
** the &quot;anterior&quot; is thin and pointed, bevelled at the expense of the outer surface, and overlapped by the tip of the great wing of the sphenoid; 
** the &quot;middle portion&quot; is arched, bevelled at the expense of the outer surface, and overlapped by the squama of the temporal; 
** the &quot;posterior part&quot; is thick and serrated for articulation with the mastoid portion of the temporal.
* The occipital border, deeply denticulated (finely toothed), articulates with the occipital bone, forming half of the lambdoid suture. That point where the sagittal suture intersects the lambdoid suture is called the lambda, because of its resemblance to the Greek letter.
== Angles ==
* The frontal angle is practically a right angle, and corresponds with the point of meeting of the sagittal and coronal sutures; this point is named the bregma; in the fetal skull and for about a year and a half after birth this region is membranous, and is called the anterior fontanelle.
* The sphenoidal angle, thin and acute, is received into the interval between the frontal bone and the great wing of the sphenoid. Its inner surface is marked by a deep groove, sometimes a canal, for the anterior divisions of the middle meningeal artery.
* The occipital angle is rounded and corresponds with the point of meeting of the sagittal and lambdoidal sutures—a point which is termed the lambda; in the fetus this part of the skull is membranous, and is called the posterior fontanelle.
* The mastoid angle is truncated; it articulates with the occipital bone and with the mastoid portion of the temporal, and presents on its inner surface a broad, shallow groove which lodges part of the transverse sinus. The point of meeting of this angle with the occipital and the mastoid part of the temporal is named the asterion.

== Ossification ==
The parietal bone is ossified in membrane from a single center, which appears at the parietal eminence about the eighth week of fetal development.

Ossification gradually extends in a radial manner from the center toward the margins of the bone; the angles are consequently the parts last formed, and it is here that the fontanelles exist.

Occasionally the parietal bone is divided into two parts, upper and lower, by an antero-posterior suture.

==In other animals==

In non-human vertebrates, the parietal bones typically form the rear or central part of the skull roof, lying behind the frontal bones. In many non-mammalian tetrapods, they are bordered to the rear by a pair of postparietal bones that may be solely in the roof of the skull, or slope downwards to contribute to the back of the skull, depending on the species. In the living tuatara and some lizards, as well as in many fossil tetrapods, a small opening, the &quot;parietal foramen&quot; (also called the &quot;pineal foramen&quot;), is present between the two parietal bones at the midline of the skull. This opening is the location of the parietal eye (also called the pineal or third eye), which is much smaller than the two main eyes.

===In dinosaurs===
The parietal bone is usually present in the posterior end of the skull and is near the midline. This bone is part of the skull roof, which is a set of bones that cover the brain, eyes and nostrils. The parietal bones make contact with several other bones in the skull. The anterior part of the bone articulates with the frontal bone and the postorbital bone. The posterior part of the bone articulates with the squamosal bone, and less commonly the supraoccipital bone. The bone-supported neck frills of ceratopsians were formed by extensions of the parietal bone. These frills, which overhang the neck and extend past the rest of the skull is a diagnostic trait of ceratopsians. The recognizable skull domes present in pachycephalosaurs were formed by the fusion of the frontal and parietal bones and the addition of thick deposits of bone to that unit.

<doc id="312084" wikidata="Q174256" url="?curid=312084" title="Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark">
<text>Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark (11 September 1656 – 26 July 1693) was Queen of Sweden as the wife of King Charles XI. She is often admired for her generosity and charity.

The name &quot;Ulrike&quot; is a Danish version of the name; in Swedish she is called &quot;Ulrika Eleonora den äldre&quot; (English: &quot;Ulrica Eleanor the Elder&quot;), to distinguish her from her daughter, the future queen regnant.

==Life==

===Early life and marriage===
Ulrika Eleonora was the daughter of King Frederick III of Denmark-Norway and his spouse, Queen Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg. She was given a strict upbringing under the supervision of her mother: she was taught several different languages, and was reportedly a good student in drawing and painting.

In 1675 she was betrothed to King Charles XI of Sweden. The purpose of the match, though from the Swedish viewpoint, was to prevent Denmark from forming an alliance with the enemies of Sweden. Her brother, the King of Denmark-Norway, was not enthusiastic about the match, but he left the decision to her mother, who was very eager to complete it because it would give Ulrika the status of queen. The engagement was announced 13 July 1675.

During the Scanian War between Denmark-Norway and Sweden in 1675–1679 she was encouraged to break the engagement. Her brother broke it for her in 1676, but she herself continued to regard herself engaged. She was considered as a possible bride by the Prince of Orange in 1676 and then by Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, but she refused a different match. During the war, she gained a reputation for loyalty to her future home country by exhibiting kindness to Swedish prisoners: she pawned her jewelry and her engagement ring to buy food, ose, and medicine for the Swedish prisoners of war. She also refused to participate in the celebrations arranged in honor of Danish victories over Sweden.

During the peace negotiations between Sweden and Denmark-Norway in 1679, the marriage between her and Charles XI was again on the agenda, and was ratified on 26 September 1679. The marriage contract was signed 6 February 1680, and when the Swedish representative Johan Göransson Gyllenstierna returned to Sweden, he escorted her to Sweden on his return home. During one of the celebrations in honor of her marriage, her name and the name of her groom were written with fireworks. One of the spectators pointed out that the person whose name died out first was the one who was going to die first. When her name went out first, she stated that she hoped it would truly be so, for she could not bear to outlive her spouse.

Ulrika Eleonora was popular in Denmark due to her charity. When she left for Sweden, her brother Christian V made his farewell at Frederiksborg, during which he gave her back the jewels she had pawned in favor of the Swedish prisoners of war, including her engagement ring. When she made her farewell to him, she said that she did not think she would ever see him again, but: &quot;as I am now regarded a pawn of peace between Denmark and Sweden, I ask God for the grace to fulfill such a glorious commitment; so that my behavior may contribute to eradicate all hostility between these two people and instead forever unite them in friendship.&quot;

In Helsingør, where she said her farewell to her mother and sisters, she thanked the Danes for their farewell greetings with the words: 
:&quot;Thank you! By my heart I thank you! May I ever be remembered in Denmark with the same tenderness, and may God give me the grace to live such, that I by the last separation [death] can be followed by the same love from my subjects!&quot;

===Life as queen===
Ulrika Eleonora arrived in Helsingborg in Sweden on 4 May 1680, where she was welcomed by canon salutation, the Queen Dowager, the Swedish court and the local aristocracy. Two days later she met and married Charles at Skottorp Manor on 6 May 1680. The wedding was hasty and a relatively simple affair in the presence of a small circle of courtiers. The reasoning for this was that the King, who was at that time in a tense relationship with France, wished to avoid the presence of the French ambassador Feuqiéres, and could do so only if the time and place of the ceremony could be kept secret long enough for it to be impossible for the ambassador to attend. The ceremony was to officially take place in Halmstad, and Ulrika Eleonora was only to spend the night at Skottorp on her way there, but when she arrived she was hastily married instead. On 25 November 1680 she was crowned Queen at Storkyrkan in Stockholm.

Initially, Charles XI was disappointed in her appearance and asked Johan Gyllenstierna if he could not have been chosen a more beautiful consort, upon which he was given the reply: &quot;Your Majesty will see, that within her there is an angel&quot;. Ulrika Eleonora was described as religious, patient, mild and charitable, moderately beautiful and with a simple dignity. She was received with enthusiasm among the public, because she was seen as a hope and a symbol of lasting peace. Her popularity was increased by her personal merits. 

She made a favorable impression of courage before her arrival to Stockholm, when spent some time in the royal residences outside of the city awaiting her official enter in the capital and the coronation. Traveling on Mälaren between Köping and Kungsör, the boat Carolus hit a rock and almost sunk. On this occasion, she calmed the panic by saying: &quot;Be still, do not cry out so! If we shall die, it will be the will of God, and God&#x27;s will be done!&quot; 

Ulrika Eleonora also quickly made herself popular by immediately dispatching almost her entire Danish entourage back to Denmark, stating that she no longer needed anything from Denmark and that her spouse and his ministers would provide for her. Charles XI had provided her with her own court and a large allowance from her dower estates. The Danish ambassador Jens Juel, who had been sent to secure her personal interests, protested against her insistence to refuse anything which could be to her advantage. She did accept being given her own court, though she commented that she would have been happy to merely share the household of the King, but she herself took the initiative of giving up the right to control her own economy, and giving up the administration of her dower to the officials of the monarch. When Juel protested that she went much too far in her eagerness to show herself submissive, and that she was giving away her own right to independence, she answered: &quot;As I wish for nothing else than what is right and proper, the King and his officials would never be able to refuse what I ask of them without damaging their own name. Furthermore I hope that this indulgence of mine would ease the further negotiations with Denmark&quot;, and to this Juel could not protest.

At the royal court, Ulrika Eleonora was placed in the shadow of her mother-in-law. While distrust between Denmark-Norway and Sweden caused by the Scanian War lingered, Hedvig Eleonora and the government of Sweden were not receptive to the son&#x27;s idea to marry a Danish princess. Though his marriage was described as happy, Charles XI continued to place his mother before his wife. The mother-in-law of Ulrika Eleonora never quite surrendered the position of queen to her daughter-in-law. Upon the arrival of Ulrika Eleonora in Helsingborg, her mother-in-law offered her the most prominent place in the carriage on their departure from the harbor, but Ulrika Eleonora had instead insisted upon taking the most humble place. After this, her mother-in-law continued to monopolize the foremost place in rank at all occasions, such as placing herself by the side of King Charles XI at the table and receptions, and walking by his side in procession, leaving the second best place to Ulrika Eleonora. The King himself, being accustomed always to treat his mother with obedience and respect, adjusted himself to this. The King always referred to Ulrika Eleonora as &quot;My Wife&quot; and to his mother as &quot;The Queen&quot;; he paid his respect to his mother first and to his wife secondly. Mindful of this, the foreign ambassadors always visited Hedvig Eleonora first, and then Ulrika Eleonora when paying their respects to the royal family. This was nurtured by the circles at court who favored the alliance between Sweden and Holstein-Gottorp against Denmark-Norway, and pointed to the fact that in Denmark, the mother of Ulrika Eleonora, also placed herself before that of her daughter-in-law, and also that Hedvig Eleonora was not only Queen Dowager but also formerly regent.
This created some tension between her and her mother-in-law, but there was never an open conflict. However, in July 1686, Ulrika Eleonora left Stockholm when Charles XI was visiting the country, and took upon residence at the Uppsala Castle in Uppsala with the royal children and her own court, stating that she would be there not only for the summer. The reason was in fact to have been her displeasure over the relationship between her husband and mother-in-law. Meanwhile, her husband traveled around the country with his mother. In August, they visited her and unsuccessfully tried to convince her to return to Stockholm. After a visit by her mother-in-law alone in September, she finally returned. Later that year, she contacted the bishop Samuel Wiraenius and asked him to act as a mediator, and to make the King state officially what mistakes she could have made. Nothing more is known about this conflict, however, Ulrika Eleonora did accept that the rank of her mother-in-law was placed before her, but stated that she disliked that this meant that also her courtiers were ranked beneath those of her mother-in-law. Her private family life with her spouse and children were described as happy: her consort was never unfaithful to her. Upon his own deathbed in 1697, he told his mother that he had not been happy since his wife died. During her lifetime, Ulrika Eleonora never developed good terms with her mother-in-law, whom she once referred to as &quot;The Devil of my marriage&quot;.

Her frail health and her many pregnancies often prevented her from participating in representation. In 1688, she had plans to visit her family in Denmark, but her weak health forced her to abandon the idea. At the summer residence Karlberg Palace, she enjoyed a happy family life away from the court and developed an interest in painting. She was interested in theater and dance and acted as patron of the amateur theatre at court. In the winter of 1683–84, a group of female courtiers performed the Swedish premier of &quot;Iphigénie&quot; by Racine at court upon her request. In the play, Johanna Eleonora De la Gardie acted in the part of &quot;Iphigenie&quot;, Amalia Königsmarck as &quot;Achilles&quot;, Aurora Königsmarck as &quot;Clitemnestre&quot;, Augusta Wrangel as &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, and Ebba Maria De la Gardie as &quot;Eriphile&quot;. This is regarded as a significant event as the first play performed by an all female cast in Sweden, and as the introduction of French Classicism in Sweden. Apparently, Ulrika Eleonora herself had originally wished to participate, but her pregnancy at the time had made it impossible. Her personal circle of intimate friends are counted as her personal confessor Johan Carlberg, her Mistress of the Robes countess Maria Elisabeth Stenbock, her Danish lady-in-waiting Sophia Amalia Marschalk and Anna Maria Clodt. She also enjoined the visits of her brother-in-law and sister the duke and duchess of Holstein-Gottorp.

Ulrika Eleonora had no political influence over Charles XI, who preferred to discuss the affairs of state with his mother rather than with his spouse. She once tried to exercise some political influence over Charles XI. During the Great Reduction to the crown of counties, baronies and large lordships from the nobility (most of them richly given away by Queen Christina), she tried to speak on the behalf of the people whose property was confiscated by the crown. But the king simply told her that the reason he had married her was not because he wanted her political advice. Instead, she helped people whose property had been confiscated by secretly compensating them economically from her own budget. A common method she used was to buy the jewels and other objects sold by the impoverished nobles, and then give it back to them or their relatives. Charles XI&#x27;s confidence in her grew over time: in 1690, he named her future Regent, should his son succeed him being still a minor.

Ulrika Eleonora is most known for her great activity within charity. She founded a large number of charitable institutions, which were administered by Sophia Amalia Marschalk. Ulrika Eleonora is known to occasionally have pawned her own possessions to finance her charitable projects. Her best known projects were the &quot;Tapetskolan vid Karlberg&quot;, a tapestry school at Karlberg Palace founded in 1688, where orphan girls were educated in tapestry manufacturing by three unmarried Finnish noblewomen under the leadership of Anna Maria Schmilau; the &quot;Drottninghuset&quot; (&#x27;Queen&#x27;s House&#x27;), a home for poor widows in Stockholm founded in 1686, and a poor house at Kungsholmen. She financed cereal and help to be distributed to areas suffering from failed crops and starvation, such as Finland in 1687, Estonia in 1688, Dalarna in 1691, and Ingria. She also paid the medical bills for a large number of people in Stockholm. 
In 1682, she assigned Johan von Hoorn and Urban Hjärne to organize the midwifery and scientific obstetrics profession in Sweden, but she died before the work could be completed: however, Johan von Hoorn did publish the first book on the subject of obstetrics in 1697 assisted by her own midwife, Catarina Wentin, who also practiced among the poor of the capital with her blessing. She supported a large number of people by regular allowances from her personal budget, such as invalid soldiers and their spouses and converts to Protestantism from Judaism, Islam and Catholicism, especially female converts. Among them were also French Huguenots. In 1693, 17,000 people were supported by her.

===Death===
In 1690, weakened by childbirths, Ulrika Eleonora was affected by a non-diagnosed illness, which was deemed to be mortal and often confined her to weeks in bed from this point on. The doctors recommended her to travel to the hot baths in Germany. Funds were set aside for this purpose, but she stated that she was as much in God&#x27;s hand in Sweden as in Germany, and used the money for her charity instead. The King cared for Ulrika Eleonora personally at Karlsberg Palace as far as his duties permitted. 

She died at Karlberg Palace 26 July 1693, after having spent the winter of 1692–93 in bed. Upon her death bed, she asked her children not to be haughty but to consider their high position as a way of helping others; to avoid flattery and pride; never to listen to gossip and, should they hear it, call upon the slandered party, listen to their explanation and regard it to be the truth. She asked her spouse to show mercy to the victims of the reduction: upon her deathbed, she recounted the names of many of the individual victims of the reduction for him, and asked for him to show mercy, each time ending the sentence with the words: &quot;You will promise me thus?&quot; She also asked for a simple funeral, and to give the funds set aside for it to the poor. At her deathbed, Charles XI reportedly said: &quot;Here I leave half of my heart&quot;.

At her death, Countess De la Gardie remarked: &quot;I do not believe any royal to have been so mourned as Her Majesty. Here there are unanimous crying and wimping, and everyone dresses in mourning, so that in the entire city, there are no more black cloth to be bought&quot;. Ulrika Eleonora has in history been given a saintly reputation, exemplified by the words of Frans Ferdinand Carlson: &quot;Seldom has a more lovable creature been placed upon a throne. She thought of everyone but herself&quot;. After her death the King took ill with a fever and it took almost two weeks before he was amongst the people again.

There is a well known old legend associated with her death. The legend states that while the queen lay dying at Karlberg Palace, her favorite and principal lady-in-waiting, Countess Maria Elisabeth Stenbock, lay sick in Stockholm. On the night the queen had died, Countess Stenbock visited Karlberg and was admitted alone to the room containing the remains of the queen. The officer in charge, Captain Stormcrantz, looked into the key hole and saw the countess and the queen speaking at the window of the room. He was so shocked by the sight that he started coughing blood. The countess, as well as the carriage she had arrived with, was gone the next moment. When the matter was investigated, it was made clear that the countess had been in bed, gravely ill that day and not left town. The King gave the order that the affair was not to be mentioned further. Whatever the explanation, it is true that countess Stenbock died of her illness a couple of weeks after the queen, and that captain Stormcrantz also did so shortly after the event he claimed took place.

Charles XI did not respect her wish of a simple funeral. However, he paid the equal amount of its costs to the poor. He announced for two years of mourning for the royal court, and when the period was finished in 1695, he refused to marry despite pressure to do so.

Her body was kept on &quot;Lit de parade&quot; in Karlsberg Palace for several months by the King until she was buried in the fall of 1693 in Riddarholm Church.

<doc id="312085" wikidata="Q13534337" url="?curid=312085" title="Common good">
<text>In philosophy, economics, and political science, the common good (also commonwealth, common weal, general welfare, or public benefit) is either what is shared and beneficial for all or most members of a given community, or alternatively, what is achieved by citizenship, collective action, and active participation in the realm of politics and public service. The concept of the common good differs significantly among philosophical doctrines. Early conceptions of the common good were set out by Ancient Greek philosophers, including Aristotle and Plato. One understanding of the common good rooted in Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy remains in common usage today, referring to what one contemporary scholar calls the &quot;good proper to, and attainable only by, the community, yet individually shared by its members.&quot;

The concept of common good developed through the work of political theorists, moral philosophers, and public economists, including Thomas Aquinas, Niccolò Machiavelli, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, James Madison, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, John Maynard Keynes, John Rawls, and many other thinkers. In contemporary economic theory, &quot;a&quot; common good is any good which is rivalrous yet non-excludable, while &quot;the&quot; common good, by contrast, arises in the subfield of welfare economics and refers to the outcome of a social welfare function. Such a social welfare function, in turn, would be rooted in a moral theory of the good (such as utilitarianism). Social choice theory aims to understand processes by which the common good may or may not be realized in societies through the study of collective decision rules. Public choice theory applies microeconomic methodology to the study of political science in order to explain how private interests affect political activities and outcomes.

==Definition==
The term &quot;common good&quot; has been used in many disparate ways and escapes a single definition. Most philosophical conceptions of the common good fall into one of two families: substantive and procedural. According to substantive conceptions, the common good is that which is shared by and beneficial to all or most members of a given community: particular substantive conceptions will specify precisely what factors or values are beneficial and shared. According to procedural formulations, by contrast, the common good consists of the outcome that is achieved through collective participation in the formation of a shared will. It is when one another respects others&#x27; dignity and rights.

==In the history of moral and political thought==
=== Historical overview ===
Under one name or another, the common good has been a recurring theme throughout the history of political philosophy. As one contemporary scholar observes, Aristotle used the idea of &quot;the common interest&quot; (, in Greek) as the basis for his distinction between &quot;right&quot; constitutions, which are in the common interest, and &quot;wrong&quot; constitutions, which are in the interest of rulers; Saint Thomas Aquinas held &quot;the common good&quot; (&quot;,&quot; in Latin) to be the goal of law and government; John Locke declared that &quot;the peace, safety, and public good of the people&quot; are the goals of political society, and further argued that &quot;the well being of the people shall be the supreme law&quot;; David Hume contended that &quot;social conventions&quot; are adopted and given moral support in virtue of the fact that they serve the &quot;public&quot; or &quot;common&quot; interest; James Madison wrote of the &quot;public&quot;, &quot;common&quot;, or &quot;general&quot; good as closely tied with justice and declared that justice is the end of government and civil society; and Jean-Jacques Rousseau understood &quot;the common good&quot; (, in French) to be the object of a society&#x27;s general will and the highest end pursued by government.

Though these thinkers differed significantly in their views of what the common good consists in, as well as over what the state should do to promote it, they nonetheless agreed that the common good is the end of government, that it is a good of all the citizens, and that no government should become the &quot;perverted servant of special interests&quot;, whether these special interests be understood as Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;interest of the rulers&quot;, Locke&#x27;s &quot;private good&quot;, Hume&#x27;s and Madison&#x27;s &quot;interested factions&quot;, or Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;particular wills&quot;.

===Ancient Greeks===
For the Ancient Greeks, the Common Good was the flourishing of the hierarchical network of people, known as the polis (one&#x27;s city, or state). The phrase &quot;common good&quot; then, does not appear in texts of Plato, but instead the phrase &quot;the good of a city&quot;. In &quot;The Republic&quot;, Plato&#x27;s character Socrates contends repeatedly that a particular common goal exists in politics and society, and that that goal is the same as the goal for a flourishing human being, namely, to be a philosopher king, ruled by the highest good, Reason, rather than one of Plato&#x27;s four lesser goods: honor-seeking, money-making, pleasure-seeking, or empassioned addiction. For Plato, the best political order is one in which the entire society submits to the dictates of the leaders&#x27; faculty of Reason, even communistically holding possessions, wives, and children in common, creating a &quot;cohesion and unity&quot; that &quot;result[s] from the common feelings of pleasure and pain which you get when all members of a society are glad or sorry for the same successes and failures.&quot;

Plato&#x27;s student Aristotle, considered by many to be the father of the idea of a common good, uses the concept of &quot;the common interest&quot; ( in Greek) as the basis for his distinction between his three &quot;right&quot; constitutions, which are in the common interest, and &quot;wrong&quot; constitutions, which are in the interest of rulers. To Aristotle, Plato is wrong about the desire to simply impose top-down unity; for Aristotle, a common good is synthesized upwardly/teleologically from the lesser goods of individuals, and their various kinds of larger-and-larger partnerships: marital couple, or parent-over-child, or master-over-slave; household; then village; then state. In this teleological view, the good stems from objective facts about human life and purpose, which may vary, depending upon peoples&#x27; occupations, virtue-levels, etc. However, noting that only citizens have the salvation (common good) of the city at heart, Aristotle argues that, regardless of form of government, those who have more of a rational understanding of the needs of the state&#x27;s salvation, are entitled to a greater share in administering and determining justice, within the light of its common good, than those who have less, or no such understanding or concern for it, such as selfish despots and political factions, as well as uneducated artisans and freedmen, women and children, slaves, etc. More than this, Aristotle argues that rational discourse itself is what the state&#x27;s Common Good relies upon, identifying those who lack it as &quot;slaves by nature&quot;, while those who excel in it are nearly divine, possessing in themselves the whole purpose for which states exist, namely, the perfectly complete good/blessed life. In his Nicomachean Ethics then, Aristotle ties up the Common Good of the state, with that of friendship, implying by this, that friendly, rational discourse is the primary activity by which citizens and rulers bring about the Common Good, both amongst themselves, and so far as it involves their inferiors. According to one common contemporary usage, rooted in Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy, common good then refers to &quot;a good proper to, and attainable, only by the community, yet individually shared in, by its members.&quot;

===Renaissance Florence===
During the 15th and 16th centuries, the common good was one of several important themes of political thought in Renaissance Florence. The thought goes back to Thomas Aquinas theory of common good being widespread in whole premodern Europe. In a later work, Niccolò Machiavelli speaks of the () or (), which refers to the general well-being of a community as a whole; however, he mentions this term only 19 times throughout his works. In key passages of the &quot;Discourses on Livy&quot;, he indicates that &quot;the common good (&quot;&quot;) . . . is drawn from a free way of life ()&quot; but is not identical with it. Elsewhere in the &quot;Discourses,&quot; freedom, safety and dignity are explicitly stated to be elements of the common good and some form of property and family life are also implied. Furthermore, the common good brought by freedom includes wealth, economic prosperity, security, enjoyment and good life. However, though Machiavelli speaks of an instrumental relationship between freedom and common good, the general well-being is not precisely identical with political freedom: elsewhere in the &quot;Discourses,&quot; Machiavelli argues that an impressive level of common good can be achieved by sufficiently autocratic rulers. Nevertheless, Machiavelli&#x27;s common good can be viewed as acting for the good of the majority, even if that means to oppress others through the endeavor. Machiavelli&#x27;s common good is viewed by some scholars as not as &quot;common&quot;, as he frequently states that the end of republics is to crush their neighbors.

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau===
In Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;The Social Contract&quot;, composed in the mid-18th century, Rousseau argues that society can function only to the extent that individuals have interests in common, and that the end goal of any state is the realization of the common good. He further posits that the common good can be identified and implemented only by heeding the general will of a political community, specifically as expressed by that community&#x27;s sovereign. Rousseau maintains that the general will always tends toward the common good, though he concedes that democratic deliberations of individuals will not always express the general will. Furthermore, Rousseau distinguished between the general will and the will of all, stressing that while the latter is simply the sum total of each individual&#x27;s desires, the former is the &quot;one will which is directed towards their common preservation and general well-being.&quot; Political authority, to Rousseau, should be understood as legitimate only if it exists according to the general will and toward the common good. The pursuit of the common good, then, enables the state to act as a moral community.

===John Rawls&#x27;s Theory of Justice===
John Rawls defines the common good as &quot;certain general conditions that are ... equally to everyone&#x27;s advantage&quot;. In his &quot;Theory of Justice&quot;, Rawls argues for a principled reconciliation of liberty and equality, applied to the basic structure of a well-ordered society, which will specify exactly such general conditions. Starting with an artificial device he calls the original position, Rawls defends two particular principles of justice by arguing that these are the positions reasonable persons would choose were they to choose principles from behind a veil of ignorance. Such a &quot;veil&quot; is one that essentially blinds people to all facts about themselves so they cannot tailor principles to their own advantage. According to Rawls, ignorance of these details about oneself will lead to principles that are fair to all. If an individual does not know how he will end up in his own conceived society, he is likely not going to privilege any one class of people, but rather develop a scheme of justice that treats all fairly. In particular, Rawls claims that those in the original position would all adopt a &quot;maximin&quot; strategy which would maximize the prospects of the least well-off individual or group. In this sense, Rawls&#x27;s understanding of the common good is intimately tied with the well-being of the least advantaged. 
Rawls claims that the parties in the original position would adopt two governing principles, which would then regulate the assignment of rights and duties and regulate the distribution of social and economic advantages across society. The First Principle of Justice states that &quot;First: each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others&quot;. The Second Principle of Justice provides that social and economic inequalities are to be arranged such that &quot;(a) they are to be of the greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society, consistent with the just savings principle&quot; (&quot;the difference principle&quot;); and &quot;(b) offices and positions must be open to everyone under conditions of &#x27;fair equality of opportunity.

=== In non-Western moral and political thought ===
The idea of a common good plays a role in Confucian political philosophy, which on most interpretations stresses the importance of the subordination of individual interests to group or collective interests, or at the very least, the mutual dependence between the flourishing of the individual and the flourishing of the group. In Islamic political thought, many modern thinkers have identified conceptions of the common good while endeavoring to ascertain the fundamental or universal principles underlying divine shari‘a law. These fundamentals or universal principles have been largely identified with the &quot;objectives&quot; of the shari‘a (), including concepts of the common good or public interest (, in modern terminology). A notion of the common good arises in contemporary Islamic discussions of the distinction between the fixed and the flexible (), especially as it relates to modern Islamic conceptions of tolerance, equality, and citizenship: according to some, for instance, universal principles carry greater weight than specific injunctions of the Qur&#x27;an, and in case of conflict, can even supersede or suspend explicit textual injunctions () if this serves the common good.

==In political economic theory==
In economics, the terms &quot;public good&quot; and &quot;common good&quot; have technical definitions. A public good is a good that is non-rivalrous and non-excludable. A common good is simply non-excludable. A simple typology illustrates the differences between various kinds of goods:


The field of welfare economics studies social well-being. The approach begins with the specification of a social welfare function. The choice of a social welfare function is rooted in an ethical theory. A utilitarian social welfare function weights the well-being of each individual equally, while a Rawlsian social welfare function only considers the welfare of the least well-off individual.

Neoclassical economic theory provides two conflicting lenses for thinking about the genesis of the common good, two distinct sets of microfoundations. On one view, the common good arises due to social gains from cooperation. Such a view might appeal to the Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma to illustrate how cooperation can result in superior welfare outcomes. Moreover, a cooperative equilibrium is stable in an iterated Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma that is played for an indefinite period of time. Under these conditions, an individual does best by pursuing the course of action that is also optimal for society.

On the other hand, economic theory typically points to social gains from competition as a rationale for the use of markets. Thus, Smith described the &quot;invisible hand,&quot; whereby the mechanism of the market converts individuals&#x27; self-interested activity into gains for society. This insight is formalized in the First Theorem of Welfare Economics. However, economic theory also points to market failures, including the underprovision of public goods by markets and the failure of self-interested individuals to internalize externalities. Because of these factors, purely self-interested behaviour often detracts from the common good.

There is an important conceptual difference between the sense of &quot;a&quot; public good, or public &quot;goods&quot; in economics, and the more generalized idea of &quot;the public good&quot; (in the sense of common good, public benefit, or public interest), &quot;a shorthand signal for shared benefit at a societal level&quot;.
In a non-economic sense, the term is often used to describe something that is useful for the public generally, such as education, although this is not a &quot;public good&quot; in the economic sense. However, services like education exhibit &quot;jointness of supply&quot;, i.e. the situation in which the cost of supplying a good to many users is the same, or nearly the same, as supplying it to one user. Public goods also exhibit jointness of supply, albeit with no diminishment of the benefits with increased consumption.

===Social choice theory===
Social choice theory studies collective decision rules. Arrow&#x27;s Impossibility Theorem, an important result in social choice theory, states that no aggregative mechanism of collective choice (restricted to ordinal inputs) can consistently transform individual preferences into a collective preference-ordering, across the universal domain of possible preference profiles, while also satisfying a set of minimal normative criteria of rationality and fairness. The Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem further demonstrates that non-dictatorial voting systems are inevitably subject to strategic manipulation of outcomes.

William H. Riker articulates the standard public choice interpretation of social choice theory, arguing that Arrow&#x27;s Impossibility Theorem &quot;forces us to doubt that the content of &#x27;social welfare&#x27; or the &#x27;public interest&#x27; can ever be discovered by amalgamating individual value judgments. It even leads us to suspect that no such thing as the &#x27;public interest&#x27; exists, aside from the subjective (and hence dubious) claims of self-proclaimed saviors.&quot; Thus, Riker defends a &quot;liberal&quot; conception of democracy, which centers on the role of constitutional checks on government. Public choice theorists have tended to share this approach. Buchanan and Tullock pursued this program in developing the field of &quot;constitutional political economy&quot; in their book &quot;The Calculus of Consent&quot;.

More recent work in social choice theory, however, has demonstrated that Arrow&#x27;s impossibility result can be obviated at little or no normative cost. Amartya Sen, for instance, argues that a range of social choice mechanisms emerge unscathed given certain reasonable restrictions on the domain of admissible preference profiles. In particular, requiring that preferences are single-peaked on a single dimension ensures a Condorcet winner. Moreover, many of Riker&#x27;s empirical claims have been refuted.

===Public choice theory===
Public choice theory (sometimes called &quot;positive political theory&quot;) applies microeconomic methodology to the study of political science in order to explain how private interests inform political activities. Whereas welfare economics, in line with classical political economy, typically assumes a public-interest perspective on policymaking, public choice analysis adopts a private-interest perspective in order to identify how the objectives of policymakers affect policy outcomes. Public choice analysis thus diagnoses deviations from the common good resulting from activities such as rent-seeking. In &quot;The Logic of Collective Action&quot;, Mancur Olson argues that public goods will tend to be underprovided due to individuals&#x27; incentives to free-ride. Anthony Downs provided an application of this logic to the theory of voting, identifying the paradox of voting whereby rational individuals prefer to abstain from voting, because the marginal cost exceeds the private marginal benefit. Downs argues further that voters generally prefer to remain uninformed due to &quot;rational ignorance&quot;.

Public choice scholarship can have more constructive applications. For instance, Elinor Ostrom&#x27;s study of schemes for the regulation of common property resources resulted in the discovery of mechanisms for overcoming the tragedy of the commons.

In many countries of the Commonwealth, charitable organizations must demonstrate that they provide a public benefit.

==In democratic theory==
In deliberative democracy, the common good is taken to be a regulative ideal. In other words, participants in democratic deliberation aim at the realization of the common good. This feature distinguishes deliberative democracy from aggregative conceptions of democracy, which focus solely on the aggregation of preferences. In contrast to aggregative conceptions, deliberative democracy emphasizes the processes by which agents justify political claims on the basis of judgments about the common good. Epistemic democracy, a leading contemporary approach to deliberative democracy, advances a cognitivist account of the common good.

== In Catholic social teaching ==
One of the earliest references in Christian literature to the concept of the common good is found in the &quot;Epistle of Barnabas&quot;: &quot;Do not live entirely isolated, having retreated into yourselves, as if you were already [fully] justified, but gather instead to seek together the common good.&quot;

The concept is strongly present in Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; &quot;City of God&quot;. Book XIX of this, the main locus of Augustine&#x27;s normative political thought, is focused on the question, &#x27;Is the good life social?&#x27; In other words, &#x27;Is human wellbeing found in the good of the whole society, the common good?&#x27; Chapters 5–17 of Book XIX address this question. Augustine&#x27;s emphatic answer is yes (see start of chap. 5).

Augustine&#x27;s understanding was taken up and, under the influence of Aristotle, developed by Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas&#x27;s conception of the common good became standard in Roman Catholic moral theology.

Against that background, the common good became a central concept in the modern tradition of Catholic social teaching, beginning with the foundational document, &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;, a papal encyclical by Pope Leo XIII, issued in 1891. This addressed the crisis of the conditions of industrial workers in Europe and argued for a position different from both laissez-faire capitalism and socialism. In this letter, Pope Leo guarantees the right to private property while insisting on the role of collective bargaining to establish a living wage.

Contemporary Catholic social teaching on the common good is summarised in the 2004 &quot;Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church&quot;, chapter 4, part II. Quoting the Second Vatican Council document, &quot;Gaudium et spes&quot; (1965), this says, &quot;According to its primary and broadly accepted sense, &quot;the common good&quot; indicates &#x27;the sum total of social conditions which allow people, either as groups or as individuals, to reach their fulfilment more fully and more easily (#164, quoting &quot;Gaudium et spes&quot;, #26; italics original).

The &quot;Compendium&quot; later gives statements that communicate what can be seen as a partly different, more classical, sense of the concept – as not only &quot;social conditions&quot; that enable persons to reach fulfilment, but as the &quot;end&quot; &quot;goal&quot; of human life. &quot;&quot;[T]he common good [is] the good of all people and of the whole person... The human person cannot find fulfilment in himself, that is, apart from the fact that he exists &quot;with&quot; others and &quot;for&quot; others&quot;&quot; (#165; italics original). &quot;The goal of life in society is in fact the historically attainable common good&quot; (#168).

The Roman Catholic International Theological Commission drew attention to these two partly different understandings of the common good in its 2009 publication, &quot;In Search of a Universal Ethic: A New Look at the Natural Law&quot;. It referred to them as &quot;two levels&quot; of the common good.

Other relevant documents are &quot;Veritatis Splendor&quot;, a papal encyclical by Pope John Paul II, issued in 1993 to combat the relaxation of moral norms and the political corruption (see paragraph 98) that affects millions of persons, and Pope Francis&#x27; 2015 encyclical, &quot;Laudato si&#x27;&quot;. In &quot;Veritatis Splendor&quot;, Pope John Paul describes the characteristics and virtues that political leadership should require, which are truthfulness, honesty, fairness, temperance and solidarity (as described in paragraph 98 to 100), given that truth extends from honesty, good faith, and sincerity in general, to agreement with fact or reality in particular. In &quot;Laudato si&quot;&#x27;, Pope Francis links the &quot;common good&quot; to the &quot;integral ecology&quot; which is a core element of his appeal for greater care for &quot;our common home&quot;.

==In contemporary politics==
=== United States ===
In contemporary American politics, language of the common good (or public wealth) is sometimes adopted by political actors on the progressive left to describe their values. Jonathan Dolhenty argues that one should distinguish in American politics between the common good, which may &quot;be shared wholly by each individual in the family without its becoming a private good for any individual family member&quot;, and the collective good, which, &quot;though possessed by all as a group, is not really participated in by the members of a group. It is actually divided up into several private goods when apportioned to the different individual members.&quot; First described by Michael Tomasky in &quot;The American Prospect&quot; magazine and John Halpin at the Center for American Progress, the American political understanding of the common good has grown in recent times. The liberal magazine &quot;The Nation&quot; and the Rockridge Institute, among others, have identified the common good as a salient political message for progressive candidates. In addition, non-partisan advocacy groups like Common Good are championing political reform efforts to support the common good.
Given the central concern for sustainable development in an increasingly interdependent world, education and knowledge should thus be considered global common goods. This means that the creation of knowledge, its control, acquisition, validation, and use, are common to all people as a collective social endeavour.

== Common goods for health ==
Common goods for health (CGH) can be defined as population-related interventions or activities that require cumulative finances from either donors or government on the basis of two conditions. The first condition is contribution in economic progress and health. The second condition includes emphasis on public or common goods and large social externalities with clear economic foundation for health interventions based on market failures. The common goods for health must produce enormous health benefits to communities and not financed through market forces. Examples of common goods for health are risk surveillance, disease control policies and strategies, vector control and public health emergency operation response services.

=== History ===
In the mid-20th century, the elites displayed a motivation for the common goods that was intended for health, and decisions were based on the elite rather than the public, since there was no public interest in the issue. 

After the 1950s, the government increasingly began to see the concept of addressing mutual issues for the benefit of the citizens, but it has yet to be completely adopted and will be much more compatible with appropriate expenditure.

<doc id="312097" wikidata="Q365148" url="?curid=312097" title="Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)">
<text>Marcus Aemilius Scaurus ( – ) was a Roman statesman who served as consul in 115 BC. He was also a long-standing &quot;princeps senatus&quot;, occupying the post from 115 until his death in late 89 or early 88 BC, and as such was widely considered one of the most prestigious and influential politicians of the late Republic.

After his consulship, Scaurus wrote &quot;De vita sua&quot;, which was probably the first autobiography in Roman history.

== Family background ==
Scaurus was born probably in 161 BC into the famous &quot;gens&quot; Aemilia, one of the most successful patrician &quot;gentes&quot; of the Republic. However, despite their patrician status, the Aemilii Scauri did not have the prominence of the other branches of the gens. No ancestor of Scaurus is known to have held a magistracy, albeit he might have descended from the Aemilii Barbulae, who counted several consuls between 317 and 230. Scaurus&#x27; father, also named Marcus, was even said to be a charcoal merchant. Scaurus wrote in his autobiography that he only inherited from his father estates worth 35,000 sesterces and six slaves, and that he was not sure whether he should go in banking or politics. Cicero commented that Scaurus was so poor &quot;he had to work his way up like a &quot;novus homo&quot;&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Little is known of Scaurus&#x27; early career. Scaurus served as a common soldier in Spain, where the Republic waged several long and uncertain wars. Ronald Syme suggested he could have been one of the many ambitious young men who enlisted in the army that Scipio Aemilianus successfully commanded against Numantia, such as Gaius Marius, Publius Rutilius Rufus, and Gaius Memmius—all later opponents of Scaurus. Perhaps his distinguished service in Spain convinced Scaurus to engage in politics.

Scaurus is found again serving in Sardinia in the staff of Lucius Aurelius Orestes, consul and proconsul in Sardinia between 126 and 124. It is probably at this time that he became an enemy of Gaius Gracchus, who was Orestes&#x27; quaestor throughout the campaign. Scaurus may have been among those in Orestes&#x27; staff who were offended by Gracchus&#x27; successes in obtaining supplies from the Sardinian natives, as well as grain from the Numidian king Micipsa. In 124, Scaurus possibly denounced Gracchus before the censors for having left his post early in order to run for the tribunician elections for 123.

In 123 BC, he was co-opted into the college of augurs. He next served as curule aedile in charge of the public games in 122 BC, and afterwards was elected praetor either in 120 or 119 BC (though Bates prefers 119 BC, as does Broughton in &quot;Magistrates of the Roman Republic&quot;). In 119, Scaurus opposed Gaius Marius&#x27;s proposed voting reform law, which would have made it more difficult for patrons to influence voting in the &quot;comitia&quot;. He also opposed in that year Jugurtha&#x27;s claim to the Numidian throne.

=== Consulship ===
Scaurus stood for election to the consulship in 116 BC but was defeated by Quintus Fabius Maximus Eburnus; he was successful the next year, buoyed with aristocratic support as a political conservative, becoming consul for 115 BC with Marcus Caecilius Metellus. One of his opponents, Publius Rutilius Rufus, prosecuted Scaurus for &quot;ambitus&quot; (electoral corruption); Scaurus responded by countersuing Rufus for the same charge. Both were acquitted. He passed a sumptuary law attempting to eliminate certain aristocratic dishes and spending on banquets; he also passed a law on voting for freedmen, of which little is known. He also conducted a successful campaign against tribes in Gaul and Liguria; for this he was voted a triumph. &quot;The most outstanding event of Scaurus&#x27; consulship was his public humiliation of the praetor P Decius Subulo&quot; in which Scaurus ripped Decius&#x27; vestments, smashed his curule chair, and forbade cases from being brought to before him, apparently because Decius refused to stand up in the presence of the consul. This was likely a political move: Decius had previously prosecuted Scaurus&#x27; ally Opimius.

In the same year, Scaurus was nominated, either by Lucius Caecilius Metellus Diadematus or Lucius Caecilius Metellus Delmaticus, and confirmed as &quot;princeps senatus&quot; by the senate, an office which he held until his death. This was the foremost honour during this period, and usually went to the most senior patrician. For the relatively young Scaurus to receive it was therefore considered a coup. Around this time, Scaurus married Metella, Metellus Delmaticus&#x27; daughter.

After his consulship, Scaurus may have been on the jury as one of the pontifices during the 114 BC trial of the Vestal Virgins. He also was accused by one Marcus Brutus of extortion, but was acquitted and &quot;came through with his &quot;auctoritas&quot; intact&quot;.

=== Jugurthine War ===

Before the Jugurthine War (112–106 BC), he was sent as envoy to Numidia with a demand for Jugurtha to cease hostilities against the Numidian king Adherbal. The evidence supports that Scaurus was &quot;not well disposed towards Jugurtha or his intrigues&quot;. When Jugurtha refused the demands, war was declared and the consul Lucius Calpurnius Bestia was sent to Africa.

Scaurus served as one of Bestia&#x27;s &quot;legati&quot; during the first year of the war (112 BC). According to the historian Sallust – whose account is very hostile towards Scaurus – both Bestia and Scaurus accepted bribes from Jugurtha to end the war early. Bates argues that Bestia and Scaurus more likely granted Jugurtha a truce in exchange for reparations and a diplomatic settlement, a choice reflecting Roman military weakness after the defeat in the Battle of Noreia in 113 BC.

When the settlement became known in Rome, the tribune Gaius Mamilius Limetanus embarked on &quot;a general assault upon the nobility&quot; in 109 BC. Mamilius passed a law creating a special court, the Mamilian commission, to look into charges of bribery. According to Sallust, Scaurus not only avoided prosecution but even managed to get himself elected as one of the three judges (&quot;quaesitores&quot;) for the trial. Some scholars believe that Sallust confused Scaurus with the similarly named Marcus Aurelius Scaurus. However, Bates argues &quot;we need not question Scaurus&#x27; appointment&quot; and that our Scaurus may have instead been elected due to his previously voiced opposition to Jugurtha.
=== Censorship and &#x27;father of the senate&#x27; ===

In 109 BC, Scaurus was elected censor with Marcus Livius Drusus the Elder as his colleague. However, when Drusus suddenly died during their year of office, Scaurus was forced against his will to abdicate his censorship, only relenting from the position when tribunes ordered him to be dragged off to prison.

In 104 BC, Scaurus became responsible for Rome&#x27;s grain supply, the &quot;cura annonae&quot;; his appointment was at the expense of Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, at the time a &quot;quaestor&quot;. Cicero judges that the loss of the &quot;cura annonae&quot; was the spark that drove Saturninus towards the &quot;populares&quot;, but it may also have been an attack, possibly to steal credit, &quot;on an already proclaimed &quot;popularis&quot; rather than a first step in inducing [Saturninus&#x27;] political conversion&quot;. Scaurus&#x27; political views – especially on the four major issues of the day: (1) land reform, (2) court reform, (3) citizenship for the Italians, and (4) questions of &quot;maiestas&quot; – are not well-known; most scholars place him among the conservatives with little further comment. It is possible that Scaurus supported land reform, or at least the Gracchan proposals to enforce limits on use of the &quot;ager publicus&quot; (public land), but opposed &quot;popularis&quot; methods rather than policy themes. His views on &quot;maiestas&quot; are more clear, supporting proposals like the Mamilian commission to prosecute treasonous behaviour, but also opposing indiscriminate prosecutions. Bates speculates that Scaurus contributed to the harshness of the Mamilian commission&#x27;s sentences, but admits there is no direct evidence thereof.

In 104 BC, after Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus – one of the tribunes of the plebs – was not co-opted into the college of augurs, he sued Scaurus. However, &quot;[Ahenobarbus&#x27;] sense of honour made him unwilling to use the evidence that one of Scaurus&#x27; own slaves offered to provide&quot; and the trial resulted in acquittal. In response, Domitius passed a bill which gave the power to appoint priests to the tribal assembly.

The next year, 103, started showing in public the corruption and short-sightedness of the senatorial elite, started with the re-election of Gaius Marius to his third consulships, in a period with &quot;the poorest showing yet of senatorial military prowess&quot;. Scaurus led the opposition against the &quot;popularis&quot; tribune Gaius Norbanus&#x27;s targeting of Quintus Servilius Caepio (consul 106 BC) after the Caepio&#x27;s refusal as proconsul to cooperate with then-consul Gnaeus Mallius Maximus, leading to the catastrophic defeat at Battle of Arausio in 105 BC. After passing a law with the effect of expelling Caepio from the senate, Norbanus successfully prosecuted Caepio before the popular assembly for the theft of the Gold of Tolosa, which had mysteriously disappeared as it was being shipped to Rome. Given that Caepio&#x27;s defence was a flimsy assertion of bad luck, the outcome of the trial was not greatly in doubt. Alongside the tribune Titus Didius and Lucius Aurelius Cotta, Scaurus attempted veto the proceedings, but was driven back through violence: Scaurus was even struck in the head by a stone. Scaurus&#x27; reasons for opposing Caepio&#x27;s prosecution likely did not have to do with the principle of prosecuting aristocrats – Scaurus was involved in the Mamilian commission which had previously done that – but rather with the use of the popular assemblies to disrupt the &quot;auctoritas&quot; of the senate. Norbanus was eventually tried around 95 BC for this act of violence.

Scaurus was involved in an unsuccessful prosecution of Gaius Memmius and Gaius Flavius Fimbria. He also encouraged ambassadors from Mithradates to sue Saturninus on the capital charge of violating their diplomatic inviolability. Both prosecutions were unsuccessful. In 102, Scaurus was reappointed &quot;princeps senatus&quot;, perhaps as a gesture in support of his hard line against Saturninus, or possibly as a matter of course (there are no records of a &quot;princeps senatus&quot; not being reappointed during his lifetime).

In 100 BC, during the height of the violence brought about by Saturninus and Gaius Servilius Glaucia, Scaurus moved the so-called &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot; that would lead to both the deaths of Saturninus and Glaucia. While &quot;it is possible... to over-emphasise this fact... it probably devolved upon the &quot;princeps senatus&quot; to initiate action in matters of such import&quot;, Scaurus also did seem to have &quot;nurtured an especially vigorous personal antipathy towards Saturninus&quot;.

=== 90s BC ===
Scaurus may have participated in a mission to the east (&quot;legatio Asiatica&quot;), which took place some time between 96 and 98 BC. It is, however, not clear whether he engaged in travel or just supported the mission. The mission likely included Gaius Marius – travelling on the pretext of fulfilling a vow to &quot;magna mater&quot; – but more likely to investigate Mithridates VI&#x27;s campaigns in Cappadocia without arousing suspicion. Following the mission, the senate dispatched Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex and Publius Rutilius Rufus to Asia in a successful administration of the province. A few years later in 92 BC, Lucius Cornelius Sulla also was dispatched east as propraetor in Cilicia, where he contested Mithridates&#x27; advances into Cappadocia.

Scaurus supported the prosecution of Norbanus for his use of violence in the trial of Caepio, testifying as a major witness for the prosecution. He also supported the &quot;lex Licinia Mucia&quot;, a law to investigate Italians usurping the privileges of Roman citizens, likely in a move to buttress the senate&#x27;s position in the state.

In 92 BC, Scaurus was probably involved in the defence of Publius Rutilius Rufus, whose honest governance during his time as a legate in Asia province had aroused the enmity of the &quot;equites&quot;. He was convicted even though his innocence was widely known. Following the Rufus trial, Scaurus was himself prosecuted by Quintus Servilius Caepio the Younger for &quot;repetundis&quot; (extortion), specifically, for receiving money which had been extorted by someone else. Scaurus was somehow successful in bringing the younger Caepio to trial first in a countersuit; both men were acquitted.

This affair drove Scaurus to support the legal reforms of Marcus Livius Drusus – elected tribune of the plebs in 91 BC – to enlarge the senate by adding around 300 &quot;equites&quot; and transfer the court jury pools back from the &quot;equites&quot; into the senate. Scaurus was one of Drusus&#x27; main advisors. Alongside Lucius Licinius Crassus, Scaurus was Drusus&#x27; main conservative champion and helped pass his extensive legislative programme. However, after the sudden death of Crassus in September 91 BC, Drusus rapidly lost his support in the senate, and the consul Lucius Marcius Philippus succeeded in abrogating Drusus&#x27; laws on religious technicalities.

It is possible that Scaurus supported Drusus&#x27; proposals to enfranchise the Italians and was sympathetic to the &quot;socii&quot;. Historians disagree as to Scaurus&#x27; positions on the &quot;socii&quot;: argues that he supported Drusus&#x27; Italian bill, while argues that Scaurus supported Drusus&#x27; programme with the exception of Italian citizenship and that he would not have so easily swapped from his earlier opposition to Italian citizenship in the past. After Drusus&#x27; assassination and the outbreak of the Social war, Scaurus was prosecuted in 90 BC by tribune Quintus Varius Severus. Varius summoned Scaurus to a trial before the people. Scaurus, who at this point was aged, gout-ridden, and infirm, retorted to the &quot;accusator&quot;:

The charges were promptly dismissed in the clamour of the people. Varius probably brought the charges against Scaurus as part of &quot;an attack on the most distinguished member of the Metellan faction... a conviction would have been a crippling blow to the Metellan bloc&quot;.

The younger Caepio also charged Scaurus before the court. It is unknown whether the charges were dropped, dismissed, or simply lapsed. Caepio was killed in action early in 90 BC and Scaurus was dead by 88 BC, when his wife Caecilia Metella married Sulla. A precise date of death is unknown, but because Scaurus was reappointed &quot;princeps senatus&quot; in 89 BC and his priesthood was succeeded in 88 BC, it can be narrowed to relative precision to between mid-November 89 BC and February 88 BC.

== Legacy ==

Scaurus&#x27; prestige outlived his death, and he was remembered by subsequent generations of Romans as a figure of great importance. Cicero in particular was a keen admirer, and once commented that &quot;almost the whole world was ruled by his nod&quot; (&quot;cuius nutu prope terrarum orbis regebatur&quot;). Ancient historian Valerius Maximus included Scaurus in his list of severe fathers, noting specifically Scaurus&#x27; reaction to his son&#x27;s flight from battle against the Cimbri, where his disapproval of his son&#x27;s actions led the son to commit suicide.

However, judgements on Scaurus were not always positive. Most notably, the historian Sallust portrays Scaurus in the &quot;Bellum Jugurthinum&quot; as an unscrupulous and greedy politician. Sallust claims that Scaurus accepted bribes from the Numidian king Jugurtha, and calls him &quot;a noble full of energy, a partisan, greedy for power, fame, and riches, but clever in concealing his faults&quot; (&quot;homo nobilis impiger factiosus, avidus potentiae honoris divitiarum, ceterum vitia sua callide occultans&quot;).

Scaurus was the last person who claimed the office of &quot;princeps senatus&quot; as the primary source of his prestige. After his death, the turmoil of the civil wars of Cinna and Sulla would submerge the prestige and authority beneath the power of the army.

== Personal life ==
With his first wife, whose name is unknown, Scaurus had one son; the only details preserved about the son are that he held the rank of legate and killed himself after being defeated in battle. Scaurus&#x27; second wife was Caecilia Metella, daughter of Lucius Caecilius Metellus Delmaticus, who was later the fourth wife of Lucius Cornelius Sulla. From this marriage, Scaurus had two children:
* Aemilia, the second wife of Pompey, and
* Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, a praetor in 56 BC.

<text>Kathryn (&quot;Kathy&quot;) Ann Watt (born 11 September 1964) is an Australian racing cyclist who won two medals at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain (gold in the road race, and silver in the pursuit).
She has won 24 national championships in road racing, track racing, and mountain bike, four Commonwealth Games gold medals, and came third in the world time trial championship. She was made a life member of Blackburn Cycling Club in 1990. She was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder.

The daughter of marathoner Geoff Watt, Kathy Watt turned first to running, winning the national junior 3 km championship. She began to train on a bike after achilles tendon problems. For a while, she competed in duathlon (running and cycling), but found she was a better cyclist than runner.

In 1996, Watt was in a legal dispute with the Australian Cycling Federation over who would race the pursuit in the Olympic Games. Watt had been told that she would be but was replaced a few days before the event by Lucy Tyler-Sharman. Watt appealed to the International Court of Arbitration for Sport, claiming a breach of contract. The court ordered Watt to be reinstated in the race.

In 2000, Watt again became involved in a controversy over a selection, but this time she was not successful in her appeal to the CAS.

She retired after 2000 but came back three years later but was not successful in an attempt to qualify for the 2004 Olympics. After another retirement, Watt worked as a coach and personal trainer. However, she made another comeback to qualify for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, where she won a silver medal in the time trial. In January 2006, she won the time trial section of the Australian open road championship in Buninyong, Ballarat.

Watt holds a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Melbourne, with a major in physiology and pathology. She studied nutrition, anatomy, and physiotherapy. She attended Tintern Church of England Girls&#x27; Grammar, now Tintern Grammar.

In 2015, she was an inaugural Cycling Australia Hall of Fame inductee.

<text>West Ealing railway station is on the Great Western Main Line in Ealing, situated in west London. It is down the line from London Paddington and is situated between to the east and to the west. Its three-letter station code is WEA.

Most trains serving the station are operated by the Elizabeth line running between Abbey Wood and . Services on the Greenford branch line to are operated by Great Western Railway.

==History==

The station was opened on 1 March 1871 as Castle Hill on the Great Western Railway, which was constructed from London Paddington through Ealing to Maidenhead in 1836–1838. The station was renamed Castle Hill Ealing Dean in 1875. From 1 March 1883, the station was served by District Railway services running between and Windsor. This service was discontinued as uneconomic after 30 September 1885. On 1 July 1899, the station was renamed West Ealing.
Originally the station consisted of four platforms in a staggered layout: platform 1 (along with a siding) and the island comprising platforms 2 and 3 to the west of the Drayton Green Road bridge, and platform 4 on the east side. The station was located next to the London Co-operative Society&#x27;s main creamery, and so was equipped with a dedicated milk train platform in the mid-1900s.

Platform 1 and its siding were demolished in the late 1960s; platform 4 was demolished and moved west of the bridge by early 1990, partially covering the site of the then long-closed milk depot; platform 2 was partially demolished and fenced off by early 1991 as trains on the main line no longer served the station. The remains of the milk train platform can still be seen today, next to platform 5.

From around 1985 to 1990, access to the original platform 4 was opposite the station building, across Drayton Green Road bridge. The previous station building (which is now closed) was completed in early 1987, following demolition of the previous century-old building a year earlier.

Since October 2008, Oyster &quot;pay as you go&quot; can be used for journeys originating or ending at West Ealing.

In December 2018, Chiltern Railways commenced operating a once per day parliamentary service on weekdays from South Ruislip and to High Wycombe via the Greenford line. It replaced a service to London Paddington via the Acton–Northolt line. It became once a week on Wednesdays only after the COVID-19 pandemic. It ran for the last time on 7 December 2022, when it was replaced by a bus service.

=== Crossrail ===
West Ealing was first proposed to be part of the Crossrail project in the 1990s. In 2003, initial public consultation proposed that no Crossrail services would stop at the station. Following criticism, it was proposed that services would call at the station 7 days a week, with station improvements including a new ticket hall and step-free access. However, the Greenford branch line would terminate at the station at a new platform, to allow for a greater number of services to run into Paddington. In May 2011, Network Rail announced that it would deliver improvements and alterations to prepare the station for Crossrail services.

In 2015, the station design was approved by Ealing Council, allowing construction to commence. The work would include a new station building designed by Bennetts Associates with access from Manor Road, a new platform for the Greenford branch, platform extensions and step-free access to all platforms. Outside the station, public realm improvements funded by Transport for London and Ealing Borough Council would include a raised speed table with granite paving, widened pavements, street trees and cycle parking.

In September 2016, Great Western Railway began operating services from Paddington with Class 387 trains, which led to most Greenford services that had previously run to Paddington to terminate at West Ealing, using the newly built platform 5. In June 2017, it was announced that completion of the station was delayed until 2019. In December 2017, MTR Crossrail took over management of the station from Great Western Railway, with TfL Rail services running from May 2018, transferring to the Elizabeth line in May 2022. In 2019, contracts for the new station building was awarded, allowing construction of the new station building.

Following delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the new station building opened on 25 March 2021, providing step free access to all platforms. The existing station building on Drayton Green Road was permanently closed.

On 5 August 1989, an express passenger train travelling from Oxford to Paddington collided with a piece of rail left on the track, probably by vandals, and the locomotive, Class 50 50025 &quot;Invincible&quot;, was derailed along the points near to platform 2 (these points were removed by November of that year). There were no serious injuries.

==Services==
Services at West Ealing are operated by the Elizabeth line and Great Western Railway.

As of the May 2023 timetable, the typical Monday to Friday off-peak service is:
*4 tph (trains per hour) westbound to Heathrow Terminal 4 (Elizabeth line)
*2 tph westbound to Heathrow Terminal 5 (Elizabeth line) 
*4 tph eastbound to Abbey Wood (Elizabeth line)
*2 tph eastbound to Shenfield (Elizabeth line)
*2 tph to Greenford (Great Western Railway)

A Sunday service was introduced at the station in May 2019. Prior to this, the station was closed on Sundays. The services to Greenford do not run on Sundays.

The station was also served by a very limited Chiltern Railways service of one train per week to on Wednesdays only. It last ran on 7 December 2022, being replaced by a bus service.

==Connections==
London Buses routes E7 and E11 serve the station.

<text>Bazilio Olara-Okello (1929 – 9 January 1990) was a Ugandan military officer and one of the commanders of the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) that together with the Tanzanian army organized the coup d&#x27;état that overthrew Idi Amin in 1979. In 1985, he was briefly the chairman of the ruling Military Council and &quot;de facto&quot; head of state of Uganda, and later, lieutenant-general and chief of the armed forces.

During the civil war in Uganda between the UNLA (which was now the national army) and Yoweri Museveni&#x27;s National Resistance Army, president Milton Obote alienated much of the Acholi-dominated officer corps, including Olara-Okello and General Tito Okello, by appointing his fellow ethnic Lango, Brigadier Smith Opon Acak, as army Chief of Staff. On 27 July 1985, an army brigade of the UNLA commanded by Olara-Okello, and composed mostly of Acholi troops, staged a coup d&#x27;état against Milton Obote&#x27;s government and seized power. The National Assembly was dissolved and a Military Council was established. Between 27 and 29 July 1985, Olara-Okello was Chairman of the Military Council, and &quot;de facto&quot; head of state.

On 29 July, General Tito Okello replaced Olara-Okello as Chairman of the Military Council, and Olara-Okello was promoted from the rank of Brigadier to that of Lieutenant General, and named chief of the armed forces. He commanded the army until Yoweri Museveni&#x27;s National Resistance Army seized power on 26 January 1986. Olara-Okello fled to exile in Sudan, where he lived until he died in Omdurman Hospital in Khartoum on 9 January 1990.

<doc id="312103" wikidata="Q731794" url="?curid=312103" title="Hypocaust">
<text>A hypocaust () is a system of central heating in a building that produces and circulates hot air below the floor of a room, and may also warm the walls with a series of pipes through which the hot air passes. This air can warm the upper floors as well. The word derives from Ancient Greek &quot;hupó&quot; and &quot;kaustós&quot; (compare &quot;&quot;). The earliest reference to such a system suggests that the Temple of Ephesus in 350 BC was heated in this manner, although Vitruvius attributes its invention to Sergius Orata in c. 80 BC. Its invention improved the hygiene and living conditions of citizens, and was a forerunner of modern central heating.

==Roman operation==
 
Hypocausts were used for heating hot baths and other public buildings in ancient Rome. They were also used in private homes. It was considered proper and necessary by the wealthier merchant class for their villas, throughout the Roman Empire. The ruins of Roman hypocausts have been found throughout Europe (for example in Italy, England, Spain, France, Switzerland, and Germany) and in Africa as well.

The ceiling of the hypocaust was raised above the ground by pillars, called pilae stacks, supporting a layer of tiles, followed by a layer of concrete, then the floor tiles of the rooms above. Hot air and smoke from the furnace would circulate through this enclosed area and then up through clay or tile flues in the walls of the rooms above to outlets in the roof, thereby heating the floors and walls of the rooms above. These tile flues were referred to as &quot;caliducts&quot;.

Rooms intended to be the warmest were located nearest to the furnace below, the heat output of which was regulated by adjusting the amount of wood fed to the fire. It was expensive and labour-intensive to run a hypocaust, as it required constant attention to the fire and a lot of fuel, so it was a feature usually encountered only in large villas and public baths.

Vitruvius describes their construction and operation in his work &quot;De architectura&quot; in about 15 BC, including details about how fuel could be conserved by building the hot room (caldarium) for men next to that for women, with both adjacent to the tepidarium, so as to run the public baths efficiently. He also describes a device for adjusting the heat by a bronze ventilator in the domed ceiling.

Remains of many Roman hypocausts have survived throughout Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.

==Non-Roman analogues==
In 1984–1985, in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, excavations in the ancient settlement of Dzalisi uncovered a large castle complex, featuring a well-preserved hypocaust built between 200 and 400 BC.

Korean houses have traditionally used &quot;ondol&quot; to provide floor heating on similar principles as the hypocaust, drawing smoke from a wood fire typically used for cooking. Ondol heating was common in Korean homes until the 1960s, by which time dedicated ondol installations were typically used to warm the main room of the house, burning a variety of fuels such as coal and biomass.

On a smaller scale, in Northern China the kang bed-stove has a long history.

==After the Romans==
With the decline of the Roman Empire, the hypocaust fell into disuse in the western provinces, but not in the Eastern Roman empire. It is thought that in Britain, from until , central heating did not exist, and hot baths were rare. However, an evolution of the hypocaust was used in some monasteries in calefactories, or warming rooms, which were heated via underground fires, as in the Roman hypocaust, but retained heat via granite stones. In Eastern Europe, the development of radiant ceramic or stone stoves were also used. In the Iberian Peninsula, the Roman system was adopted for the heating of Hispano-Islamic baths &quot;(hammams)&quot; of Al Andalus. A derivation of hypocaust, the &quot;gloria&quot;, was in use in Castile until the arrival of modern heating. After the fuel (mainly wood) was reduced to ashes, the air intake was closed to keep hot air inside and to slow combustion. In colonial British North America, the house of Maryland governor Charles Calvert (now part of the Historic Inns of Annapolis) was constructed in the 1720s with a hypocaust to heat a greenhouse for growing tropical plants.

<text>Lossless Transform Audio Compression (LTAC) is a compression algorithm developed by Tilman Liebchen, Marcus Purat and Peter Noll at Institute for Telecommunications, Technische Universität Berlin (TU Berlin), to compress PCM audio in a lossless manner, &quot;unlike&quot; conventional lossy audio compression algorithms (like MP3).

LTAC will not be developed any further since it has been superseded by its successor lossless predictive audio compression (LPAC), which is based on linear prediction. This makes it much faster than LTAC and even leads to better compression results. LPAC has become official standard as MPEG-4 Audio Lossless Coding.

<text>Spasim is a 32-player 3D networked space flight simulation game and first-person space shooter developed by Jim Bowery for the PLATO computer network and released in March 1974. The game features four teams of eight players, each controlling a planetary system, where each player controls a spaceship in 3D space in first-person view. Two versions of the game were released: in the first, gameplay is limited to flight and space combat, and in the second systems of resource management and strategy were added as players cooperate or compete to reach a distant planet with extensive resources while managing their own systems to prevent destructive revolts. Although &quot;Maze&quot; is believed to be the earliest 3D game and first-person shooter as it had shooting and multiplayer by fall 1973, &quot;Spasim&quot; has previously been considered along with it to be one of the &quot;joint ancestors&quot; of the first-person shooter genre, due to earlier uncertainty over &quot;Maze&quot;″s development timeline.

The game was developed in 1974 at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign; Bowery was assisted in the second version by fellow student Frank Canzolino. Bowery encountered the PLATO system of thousands of graphics terminals remotely connected to a set of mainframe computers that January while assisting a computer art class. He was inspired to create the original game by the multiplayer PLATO action game &quot;Empire&quot;, and the second version by the concept of positive sum games. &quot;Spasim&quot; was one of the first 3D first-person video games; at one point, Bowery offered a reward to any person who could offer proof that &quot;Spasim&quot; was not the first. He also claims that &quot;Spasim&quot; was the direct initial inspiration for several other PLATO games, including &quot;Airace&quot; (1974) and &quot;Panther&quot; (1975).

==Gameplay==

&quot;Spasim&quot; is a multiplayer space flight simulation game, in which up to 32 players fly spaceships around 4 planetary systems. Players are grouped into teams of up to 8 players, with 1 team per system; players add their names to the rosters of the four teams, named Aggstroms, Diffractions, Fouriers, and Lasers, each with a different type of spaceship from &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Players control their ships in first person in a 3D environment, with other ships appearing as wireframe models. There is no hidden-line removal implemented on the models, meaning that the models appear see-through and the player can see the wireframe of the &quot;back&quot; of an object as well. The positions of the planets and other players relative to the player update once a second. Players can fire &quot;phasers and torpedoes&quot; to destroy other players&#x27; ships. &quot;Spasim&quot; was intended to include an educational component; players enter instructions to move their spaceships using polar coordinates, e.g. altitude and azimuth, along with acceleration, while their position in space is given in Cartesian coordinates. Players can switch their perspective between their ship, their starting space station, and torpedoes they have launched, in addition to changing the angle and magnification zoom of their camera. All controls are entered via single-key text inputs.

The gameplay of the original version of &quot;Spasim&quot; is focused on space flight and combat. An updated version of the game was released a few months after the initial release that added strategy and resource management; each team&#x27;s planet has resources, population levels, and standard of living. Players spend their planet&#x27;s supply of &quot;anti-entropy&quot; on powering their spaceship or managing their planet. Teams compete or cooperate in order to gain enough resources to reach a far distant planet. Mismanaging a team&#x27;s resources or over-reliance on combat causes dissatisfaction on the players&#x27; planets, and can lead to a &quot;planetary proletariat revolt&quot; which greatly reduces the planet&#x27;s population and resources.

==Development==

The game was developed by Jim Bowery in early 1974 for the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign&#x27;s PLATO computer network, which by the 1970s supported several thousand graphical terminals distributed worldwide, running processes on nearly a dozen different networked mainframe computers. Bowery started working on the game, titled &quot;spasim&quot; as a contraction of &quot;space simulation&quot;, as a student in January 1974 while assisting professor Leif Brush with the first computer art class at the university. Brush showed Bowery and the class a PLATO graphics terminal in the Lindquist Center on campus, and Bowery, intrigued, signed up for an individual studies course to assist professor Bobby Brown, who ran the lab with this terminal. Bowery learned to program on the computer, helped by other users such as John Daleske, the developer of &quot;Empire&quot; (1973), and Charles Miller, who later made &quot;Moria&quot; (1975). Bowery was inspired by the multiplayer and graphical nature of &quot;Empire&quot;, a space action game, to create something in the same vein. Taking code for displaying a 3D vector graphics perspective previously written by Don Lee and Ron Resch, he designed 3D versions of the ships from &quot;Empire&quot;, and began adding more features to the game, including weapons inspired by &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

The first version of &quot;Spasim&quot;, subtitled &quot;An Investigation of Holographic Space&quot;, was launched in March 1974. A few months later, Bowery set out to rewrite the game, with the assistance of metallurgy student Frank Canzolino. At first, the pair optimized the 3D graphics of the game, but Bowery, inspired by the concept of positive sum games, or cooperative games, decided to delete the entire game code from the mainframe and start over, building in strategy and resource management elements into the base game instead of adding them on top. Bowery designed the new version to penalize over-reliance on combat and incentivize cooperation as part of a philosophical stance on what he believed actual space expansion would require. The second version of &quot;Spasim&quot; was developed over the course of three days, and the pair released it in July 1974. Bowery released occasional updates to the game until he graduated; afterwards it was maintained by Steve Lionel, who added a tutorial on navigating in polar coordinates.

==Legacy==
Bowery claims that &quot;Spasim&quot; had &quot;quite a following&quot; on the PLATO network and that there was &quot;a late night cult&quot; that was devoted to the game, though the emphasis in the second version of strategy over combat cut the playerbase in half. &quot;Spasim&quot; is one of the first 3D first-person games ever made; at one point Bowery had a standing offer of $500 to any person who could find proof of an earlier such game, or $200 for an earlier game that mathematically modeled population versus resource availability and included space resources. The first is believed to be &quot;Maze&quot;, a maze game which ran on two connected computers at NASA in 1973 and was expanded to support up to eight players at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that same year. &quot;Spasim&quot; has been considered, along with &quot;Maze&quot;, to be one of the &quot;joint ancestors&quot; of the first-person shooter genre, due to earlier uncertainty over &quot;Maze&quot;″ development timeline.

According to Bowery, the initial release of &quot;Spasim&quot; inspired Silas Warner, one of the developers of &quot;Empire&quot;, to use Bowery&#x27;s code in turn to develop the flight simulator game &quot;Airace&quot; for the PLATO system in 1975, which then lead to first &quot;Airfight&quot;, another flight simulator, and then the tank driving game &quot;Panther&quot; later that year. &quot;Spasim&quot; has also been cited as a &quot;spiritual ancestor&quot; of &quot;Elite&quot; (1984) and the line of space trading games that came from it. In December 2022, Bowery uploaded the source code for &quot;Spasim&quot; to GitHub, which he had found in an archive.

<text>The Stanford Behavior Design Lab (formerly known as the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab and Stanford Captology Lab) is a research organization advancing behavior change methods and models based at Stanford University. Founded in 1998 and directed by B. J. Fogg, the Behavior Design Lab is a team of Stanford students, recent graduates, and quantitative researchers who study factors that impact human behavior, and conduct IRB research. The team is the global authority in a new and systematic way to design for behavior change, an approach called “Behavior Design.&quot; The Lab manager is Tanna Drapkin.

The Behavior Design Lab performs research and trains Fortune 500 companies on the use of Computing Technology and Behavior Design to facilitate positive behavior change in product design, and new product development (Instagram, Goodyear Tire).

The Lab is best known as the mobile health and start-up Lab at Stanford University, having been the inception of concepts for big name companies such as Instagram, Facebook Apps, and Clubhouse among others. The Lab&#x27;s alumni network is extensive, deeply rooted, and has actively driven, participated, advised, and/or invested in multiple successful Silicon Valley unicorns and Fortune 500 companies.

== History ==
The Lab was originally founded as the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab in 1998 by B. J. Fogg to research computers as Persuasive Technology as part of H-STAR (Human Sciences and Technologies Advanced Research Institute) at Stanford University, which focuses on advancing the human sciences, often in the context of their application to the design and use of information technologies, their influences on people, and with a particular emphasis on education and learning. As a research lab within H-STAR, the Lab performed cutting-edge research into how computing products — from websites to mobile phone software — can be designed to change what people believe and what they do. At the intersection of human-computer interaction and behavior change, the Lab aimed to unlock actionable insights and accelerate the creation of tools to help facilitate positive behavior change across categories below:

* Human-Centered Tech: Ensuring pervasive safety and health of people over the lifespan with human-centered technology innovations.
* Security: Solving security and trust problems of computing, communications and information systems at home, work and in governmental affairs.
* Accelerating Innovation: Accelerating innovation to create and diffusion products and services that better meet today&#x27;s human needs.
* Digital Divides: Closing digital divides across class, race, gender, age and nations to provide equal opportunities to learn and work productively for personal and societal well-being.
* Technology Complexity: Reducing the complexity of information technology to enable its widespread adoption and appropriate use.

In 2002, the Lab created the Stanford Web Credibility Project and led a large study that resulted in the publication &quot;How Do People Evaluate a Web Site&#x27;s Credibility?&quot;

In 2005, the Lab received a grant from the National Science Foundation to support experimental work investigating how mobile phones can motivate and persuade people, an area the lab calls &quot;mobile persuasion.”

Between 2005 and 2009, the Lab became increasingly aware of how traditional approaches to behavior change have not been effective and how most programs that had been created to influence behavior had failed miserably. Recognizing this reality a decade ago, the Stanford Behavior Design stepped away from the tradition and began creating a new way to design for behavior change.

In 2009, the Lab focused on technology to promote peace, which later led to a new group at Stanford called the Peace Innovation Lab.

Between 1998 and 2018, the Lab gradually moved away from Persuasive Technology to focus on Behavior Change methods and models. The Lab advises and encourages anyone looking to design persuasive technologies to review their early and significant contributions on ethics and focus their research and efforts on positive change and helping people succeed and feel successful at doing what they already want to do.

In 2018, the sole focus became Behavior Design, thus resulting in the renaming of the Lab as it is used today. The Lab directed its focus to conduct research advancing Behavior Design methods, models, and maxims that help people do what they already want to do and help people feel successful.

Between 2018 and 2021, over ten different projects have been completed. Current projects are Climate Action, Upregulating Positive Emotions, Rosetta Project, and the P.E.P. - The Positive Experience Project.

In 2021, the Lab relocated to Stanford&#x27;s School of Medicine under the umbrella of Vaden Health Services in the Division of Health and Human Performance (HHP) and within the Stanford Flourishing Project. The affiliation opened new doors to additional computing technology research and real-world impact.

<doc id="312114" wikidata="Q460683" url="?curid=312114" title="Princess Albertina piercing">
<text>Princess Albertina is a female genital piercing, where a ring enters the urethra and exits through the top of the vagina. Anne Greenblatt described the Princess Albertina to Ralph H. in 1995 as a &quot;relatively new and experimental piercing.&quot; Its name comes from the fact that it is analogous to the male Prince Albert piercing.

This is a relatively rare piercing, as placement is difficult and the potential for urinary tract infections (UTI) may be increased by this piercing. This piercing requires the bearer to have a large enough urethra for it to be viable. This piercing can be extremely sexually stimulating, as its presence stimulates the nerves of the urethra during intercourse or masturbation. It is an advanced piercing and many piercers may not be willing or able to perform it, largely due to the aforementioned concern about UTIs. While many male genital piercings are transurethral, the longer length of the male urethra reduces the risk of urinary tract infection due to transurethral piercings. The presence of this piercing can alter or divert the flow of urine from the body and may require extra attention during and after urination.

<doc id="312116" wikidata="Q408384" url="?curid=312116" title="Quinoline">
<text>Quinoline is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound with the chemical formula C9H7N. It is a colorless hygroscopic liquid with a strong odor. Aged samples, especially if exposed to light, become yellow and later brown. Quinoline is only slightly soluble in cold water but dissolves readily in hot water and most organic solvents. Quinoline itself has few applications, but many of its derivatives are useful in diverse applications. A prominent example is quinine, an alkaloid found in plants. Over 200 biologically active quinoline and quinazoline alkaloids are identified. 4-Hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) are involved in antibiotic resistance.

== Occurrence and isolation ==
Quinoline was first extracted from coal tar in 1834 by German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge; he called quinoline &quot;leukol&quot; (&quot;white oil&quot; in Greek). Coal tar remains the principal source of commercial quinoline. In 1842, French chemist Charles Gerhardt obtained a compound by dry distilling quinine, strychnine, or cinchonine with potassium hydroxide; he called the compound &quot;Chinoilin&quot; or &quot;Chinolein&quot;. Runge&#x27;s and Gephardt&#x27;s compounds seemed to be distinct isomers because they reacted differently. However, the German chemist August Hoffmann eventually recognized that the differences in behaviors was due to the presence of contaminants and that the two compounds were actually identical. The only report of quinoline as a natural product is from the Peruvian stick insect
&quot;Oreophoetes peruana&quot;. They have a pair of thoracic glands from which they discharge a malodorous fluid containing quinoline when disturbed.

Like other nitrogen heterocyclic compounds, such as pyridine derivatives, quinoline is often reported as an environmental contaminant associated with facilities processing oil shale or coal, and has also been found at legacy wood treatment sites. Owing to its relatively high solubility in water quinoline has significant potential for mobility in the environment, which may promote water contamination. Quinoline is readily degradable by certain microorganisms, such as &quot;Rhodococcus&quot; species Strain Q1, which was isolated from soil and paper mill sludge.

Quinolines are present in small amounts in crude oil within the virgin diesel fraction. It can be removed by the process called hydrodenitrification.

== Synthesis ==
Quinolines are often synthesized from simple anilines using a number of named reactions.
Going clockwise from top these are: 
* Combes quinoline synthesis using anilines and β-diketones.
* Conrad-Limpach synthesis using anilines and β-ketoesters.
* Doebner reaction using anilines with an aldehyde and pyruvic acid to form quinoline-4-carboxylic acids
* Doebner-Miller reaction using anilines and α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.
* Gould-Jacobs reaction starting from an aniline and ethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate
* Skraup synthesis using ferrous sulfate, glycerol, aniline, nitrobenzene, and sulfuric acid.

A number of other processes exist, which require specifically substituted anilines or related compounds:
* Camps quinoline synthesis using an o-acylaminoacetophenone and hydroxide
* Friedländer synthesis using 2-aminobenzaldehyde and acetaldehyde
* Knorr quinoline synthesis, using a β-ketoanilide and sulfuric acid
* Niementowski quinoline synthesis, using anthranilic acid and ketones
* Pfitzinger reaction using an isatin with base and a carbonyl compound to yield substituted quinoline-4-carboxylic acids
* Povarov reaction using an aniline, a benzaldehyde and an activated alkene

Quinolines are reduced to tetrahydroquinolines enantioselectively using several catalyst systems.
== Applications ==
Quinolines are used in the manufacture of dyes and the preparation of hydroxyquinoline sulfate and niacin. It is also used as a solvent for resins and terpenes.

Quinoline is mainly used as in the production of other specialty chemicals. Approximately 4 tonnes were produced annually according to a report published in 2005. Its principal use is as a precursor to 8-hydroxyquinoline, which is a versatile chelating agent and precursor to pesticides. Its 2- and 4-methyl derivatives are precursors to cyanine dyes. Oxidation of quinoline affords quinolinic acid (pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid), a precursor to the herbicide sold under the name &quot;Assert&quot;.

The reduction of quinoline with sodium borohydride in the presence of acetic acid is known to produce Kairoline A. (C.f. Kairine)

Several anti-malarial drugs contain quinoline substituents. These include quinine, chloroquine, amodiaquine, and primaquine.

Quinoline is used as a solvent and reagent in organic synthesis.

Quinolinium compounds (e.g. salts) can also be used as corrosion inhibitors and intensifiers.

<doc id="312120" wikidata="Q4868454" url="?curid=312120" title="BatMUD">
<text>BatMUD is a medieval fantasy MUD, established in 1990. &quot;BatMUD&quot; is Finland-based and operated and owned by a non-profit organization, Balanced Alternative Techniques ry (&quot;B.A.T. ry&quot;), officially registered 1994 in Helsinki, Finland.

By 2006, over 100,000 players had frequented the game, making it one of the largest text-based multiplayer games on the Internet. In the beginning of 2008, it had over 30,000 subscriptions. At the end of 2011, number of subscriptions was similarly over 30,000 giving BatMUD a flat growth (number of new players equal those who no longer frequent the game). It has been called a &quot;very popular and complex game&quot;.

==History, Legal and Development==

&quot;BatMUD&quot; was one of the first LPMuds and has been online with only a few, if any minor breaks since 14 April 1990.
The game was initially set-up by a wizard who named himself Jaf, followed by many volunteer coders, all becoming wizards in the process.
The MUD&#x27;s name comes from the name of the server the game was first hosted on, batman.cs.hut.fi. Since then, BatMUD has relocated several times, at one point residing in Oulu, Finland.
Between November 2007 and August 2021, the main &quot;BatMUD&quot; servers were co-located in the two data centers of Nebula in Helsinki, Finland. BatMUD moved to a new data center, Ficolo&#x27;s The Air in Vantaa, Finland, in August 2021 and is running on dedicated servers with redundant connectivity.

Despite its phenomenal age as an Internet community, the MUD is constantly evolving which makes it both challenging and entertaining to new and old players alike.
Due to the rich set of features, &quot;BatMUD&quot; may be a bit overwhelming for a newcomer.

===Notable (external) events, timeline===
In September 1994, the organization Balanced Alternative Techniques ry was officially registered in the &quot;Joint corporate information system of the National Board of Patents and Registration and the Tax Administration&quot; of Finland.
The game was also previewed in the gaming magazine &quot;Pelit&quot; and was highly praised for its rich set of features, scoring over 90/100 points.

In 2004, B.A.T. ry applied for the &quot;BatMUD&quot; trademark and &quot;BatMUD&quot; was registered as a trademark by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on April 5, 2005.
Also, a 91-page Pro graduation thesis emerges from the University of Lapland, themed &quot;Artificial Intelligence in text-based computer games&#x27; dramaturgy.
Study subjects: Nethack and BatMUD&quot;, Audiovisual Mediaculture written by Jussi Huhtala (in Finnish).

In February 2007, a 100-page Pro graduation master&#x27;s thesis with the topic &quot;Virtual gift - Trading gifts in BatMUD virtual community&quot; in cultural anthropology for the University of Jyväskylä was published, written by a non-player in Finnish.

&quot;BatMUD&quot; has a wide variety of races. Player killing is lightly moderated.

==Virtual community and Playerbase==
It is arguable that &quot;BatMUD&quot; formed one of the earliest virtual communities of gamers on the Internet.
What marks the community significant, is the active operation and participation of the individuals within the virtual community. Several conventions and events are being held across the world, with one of the most notable probably being the Indiana, U.S. based Campcon, being held for the 11th consecutive year in June, 2009 — a real life gathering of active participants of the &quot;BatMUD&quot; community. Similar events are held in Europe and Scandinavia every year.

&quot;BatMUD&quot; provides a range of interplayer communication methods, allowing the players to talk and chat. Though the majority (about 2/3) of the players reside in Finland, the game itself is wholly in English, enabling it to host a large player base from several countries, including many European countries, the United States, Canada and Australia. Together with roleplay not being strictly enforced, the common language of English allows debates to flourish.

With about one hundred players simultaneously online, it is also one of the largest traditional MUDs. However, with the rise of massively multiplayer online games its popularity has fallen off in recent years with fewer new players joining. Aggressive efforts have been made to make the MUD more newbie friendly but most players continue to be well established players who have invested months or years into the game. As with many other popular online games, addiction is not unknown.

&quot;BatMUD&quot; employs a virtual economy, with players selling rare items and favours to each other in the game&#x27;s internal currency. Sale of characters or equipment for real life money is forbidden. If it has occurred, it has not been a major problem.

==Influence==
&quot;BatMUD&quot; was the first MUD played by Matt &quot;Sarapis&quot; Mihaly, founder of Iron Realms Entertainment. Mihaly became a wizard on &quot;BatMUD&quot;, but was banned for making a room that trapped and disabled other wizards.

<doc id="312122" wikidata="Q1535788" url="?curid=312122" title="The Rank Organisation">
<text>The Rank Organisation (founded as the J. Arthur Rank Organisation) is a British entertainment conglomerate founded in 1937 by industrialist J. Arthur Rank. It quickly became the largest and most vertically integrated film company in the United Kingdom, owning production, distribution, and exhibition facilities as well as manufacturing projection equipment and chairs. It diversified into the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers (as one of the owners of Rank Xerox). The company name lasted until February 1996, when the name and some of the remaining assets were absorbed into the newly structured Rank Group plc. The company itself became a wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox and was renamed XRO Limited in 1997.

The company&#x27;s logo, the Gongman, first used in 1935 by the group&#x27;s distribution company General Film Distributors and seen in the opening titles of the films, became a celebrated and enduring film emblem.

==Origin==
The company founder J. Arthur Rank, born in Kingston upon Hull, UK, was already a wealthy industrialist through his father&#x27;s flour milling business, Joseph Rank Ltd, before making his start in filmmaking by financing short religious subjects in line with his Methodist beliefs. Rank was a Methodist Sunday school teacher and wished to introduce these beliefs to a wider audience.

The Rank Organisation was established, as a means for Rank to consolidate his filmmaking interests, in 1937.

==Filmmaking in the 1940s==
A loose collective of filmmakers was established by Rank under the banner of Independent Producers Ltd. including The Archers, consisting of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, Cineguild Productions, consisting of David Lean, Ronald Neame, John Bryan, and Anthony Havelock-Allan, the filmmaking duo of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, and the directors Ken Annakin and Muriel Box.

The Company of Youth, the Rank Organisation&#x27;s associated acting school often referred to as &quot;The Charm School&quot;, was founded in 1945. It launched several careers including those of Donald Sinden, Dirk Bogarde, Diana Dors and Christopher Lee.

Although she was not a member of the school, Petula Clark was under contract to Rank for a period of time and starred in a number of films released by the studio, including &quot;London Town&quot; (1946), one of the costliest flops in British film history. Also under contract to Rank was the Canadian actor Philip Gilbert.

==Growth==
The company grew quickly, largely through acquisition. Significant developments included:
* 1938 – Odeon Cinemas was purchased.
* 1939 – Denham Film Studios were merged with the facilities at Pinewood, and the Amalgamated Studios in Borehamwood were acquired, but not used for making films.
* 1939 – UK sites of Paramount Cinemas purchased.
* 1941 – Purchase of the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation, which also owned Gainsborough Pictures, 251 cinemas and the Lime Grove Studios.
* In the mid-1940s, Two Cities Films became part of the Rank Organisation producing key films such as &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; (1947), &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1948), &quot;Vice Versa&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Rocking Horse Winner&quot; (1949).
* 1946 – Bought for £1 million+ a 50 per cent share in a chain of 133 cinemas from New Zealander Robert James Kerridge, the biggest exhibition chain in Australasia; it was renamed Kerridge Odeon.
* Late 1940s – A majority shareholding in Allied Cinemas and Irish Cinemas Ltd was gained, becoming the largest exhibition circuit in Ireland (a position maintained until the early 1980s).

By the late 1940s, J. Arthur Rank (or the Rank Organisation as it was now called), owned:
* Five major film studio complexes, Pinewood Film Studios, Denham Film Studios, Ealing Studios, Lime Grove Studios and Islington Studios (the studios at Lime Grove were sold to the BBC in 1949, as were Ealing Studios in 1955). 
* 650 UK cinemas (the Gaumont, Odeon and Paramount chains) plus various international holdings, including subsidiaries in Canada and The Netherlands as well as interests in the Kerridge New Zealand chain and Greater Union Theatres in Australia.
* General Film Distributors (later Rank Film Distributors), including the UK distribution rights to Universal Pictures.
* Eagle-Lion Films.
* Rank Screen Advertising.
* Rank Film Laboratories, Denham (later rebranded DeLuxe London after Rank&#x27;s acquisition of DeLuxe Laboratories from 20th Century Fox in 1990).
* Manufacturing companies G.B.-Kalee, Taylor Hobson and Bush Radio.
*Winter Garden Theatre, London.

==Crisis and diversification==
Despite funding films which were both popular and critically acclaimed, Rank was in crisis by 1949, having built up a debt of £16 million, and reported an annual loss of £3.5 million. Managing director John Davis cut staff, reduced budgets and concentrated film production at Pinewood. Other studio facilities (in Islington) were closed, sold (Lime Grove Studios) or leased (Denham). The Rank Organisation closed Independent Producers Ltd. The policies of Davis alienated many in the industry; in particular they led film director David Lean, responsible for some of Rank&#x27;s most critically and financially successful films, to look elsewhere for backing. J. Arthur Rank stepped down as managing director of the Rank Organisation in 1952, but remained as chairman until 1962.

In October 1955 the company reported its film production was &quot;satisfactory&quot;.

==Diversification==

In 1945, the company bought the Bush Radio manufacturing facility and began to diversify its interests. In the early 1960s Rank took over Murphy Radio to form the Rank Bush Murphy Group (which was eventually sold to Great Universal Stores in 1978). In 1956, Rank began a partnership with the Haloid Corporation to form Rank Xerox, to manufacture and promote its range of plain paper photocopying equipment. In later years, the waning film company assets were hastily converted and pressed into &#x27;Rank Xerox&#x27; service. This venture was a gamble but ultimately the company&#x27;s saving grace, until, once more in financial difficulties, it signed off increasing percentages of its holdings to the parent company, finally becoming fully integrated into Xerox in the late 1990s. Rank was also a significant shareholder in the consortium which became Southern Television, the first ITV television contract holder for the south of England.

===Rank Records===

In the late 1950s, The Rank Organisation set up Rank Records Ltd. The record label division was named Top Rank Records and Jaro Records (a US subsidiary).

In 1960, Top Rank Records was taken over by EMI, and in 1962 they replaced it with Stateside Records. Top Rank artists included Gary U.S. Bonds, the Shirelles, B. Bumble and the Stingers, Wilbert Harrison, Skip &amp; Flip, Andy Stewart, Craig Douglas and John Leyton. A US branch operated from 1959 to 1961; its artists included Jack Scott, Dorothy Collins, and The Fireballs.

===Rank Audio Visual===
Rank Audio Visual was created in 1960, bringing together Rank&#x27;s acquisitions in multimedia, including Bell &amp; Howell (acquired with Gaumont British in 1941), Andrew Smith Harkness Ltd (1952) and Wharfedale Ltd (1958). Subsequent acquisitions included Strand Electric Holdings (1968) and H.J. Leak &amp; Co. (1969). In the mid and late 1970s, Rank Audio Visual made a 3-in-1 stereo music centre, as well as TV sets in conjunction with NEC of Japan. The production of the &quot;classic&quot; Rank TV ran in the mid to late 70s, and a &quot;modern&quot; Rank TV appeared in the early 1980s. The NEC badge did not appear in the PAL/220/240 volt countries until the mid-1980s.

===Motoring===
Top Rank was one of the early operators of motorway service areas in the UK, opening its first services at Farthing Corner on the M2 in Kent in 1963. Top Rank operated a portfolio of 10 service areas until the takeover of Mecca Leisure Group by the Rank Group in 1991, when they were spun off to ex-Mecca CEO Michael Guthrie under the name Pavilion (later acquired by Granada and now forming part of Moto Hospitality). There were other small specialised groups, including Rank Taylor Hobson who made inspection equipment, Rank Cintel who made telecine (television film scanners) machines, and Gaumont Kalee who made audio analysis equipment.

==Declining involvement in the film industry==
During this period, Rank started focussing on primarily solidly commercial ventures, largely aimed at the family market. These include the popular Norman Wisdom comedies, the Doctor films series and, later, Rank took on the Carry On film series from Anglo-Amalgamated. Films of note produced during this era include &quot;Carve Her Name with Pride&quot;, &quot;Sapphire&quot;, &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; and &quot;Victim&quot;, as well as a clutch of prestige topics such as the Coronation of Elizabeth II and filmed performances by the Royal Ballet.

In February 1956, Davis announced Rank would make 20 films at over £3 million. He said &quot;great care will be taken to ensure that, while retaining essentially British characteristics the films will have the widest international appeal. This is part of an intensified drive to secure ever widening showing in overseas markets which already return more than half the revenue earned by Pinewood films.&quot; That year, Rank announced it would set up distribution in the United States. In October ,Davis listed the Rank actors he thought could become international stars: Dirk Bogarde, Peter Finch, Kay Kendall, Jeannie Carson, Virginia McKenna, Belinda Lee, Michael Craig, Tony Wright, Maureen Swanson and Kenneth More.

In October 1957, at the 21st birthday for Pinewood Studios, Davis said Rank would make 18 films that year and 20 the next, with the latter costing £5 million.

However, cinema attendances fell. In September 1958 the company had lost £1,264,000 on films causing the group&#x27;s profit to drop from £5 million to £1.8 million. John Davis wound up several long term contracts Rank had with talent. &quot;The trouble with some of them is they won&#x27;t work,&quot; he said. &quot;They lose their sense of proportion.&quot; To recoup some of their losses, Rank sold Ealing Studios and its library to Associated British Picture Corporation.

In the late 1950s, Sydney Box became head of production; he retired from the industry in 1959.

In January 1960, John Davis announced that Rank would concentrate on bigger budgeted, internationally focused productions.

In 1961, they announced a production slate of a dozen films worth £7 million.

In October 1962, Lord Rank resigned as chairman of the company and was replaced by managing director Davis. That year, the company made a group profit of over £6 million and stated 41% of its film production income came from overseas.

In October 1964, Davis reported profits of £4.6 million.

From 1959 to 1969, the company made over 500 weekly short cinema films in a series entitled &quot;Look At Life&quot;, each film depicting an area of British life. From 1971 to 1976, Rank only invested around £1.5 million a year in film production. According to executive Tony Williams, &quot;the two main streams that they were down to was Carry On pictures and horror films made by Kevin Francis&quot;. However, in 1976, Rank enjoyed much success with &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; (which they co-produced with Paramount Pictures, who held its American rights). This encouraged them to re-enter film production.

==Temporary revival and last years==
In 1977, Rank appointed Tony Williams head of production and over two years Rank made eight films worth £10 million, including &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Wing&quot;, &quot;The Shout&quot;, &quot;The Thirty Nine Steps&quot;, &quot;Riddle of the Sands&quot; and &quot;Silver Dream Racer&quot;. (Another account said the company committed £4 million a year over three years.) Many of these stories were set in the past. &quot;You have to go back in time to tell a story that doesn&#x27;t have to face seventies problems&quot;, said Williams in 1978. &quot;What people are nostalgic for isn&#x27;t necessarily any particular period, but the happier values that are missing today.&quot; Few of these new Rank films performed well at the box office, losing £1.6 million overall. The Rank cinemas refused to play some of the movies.

At the Cannes Film Festival in 1980, Ed Chilton of Rank announced a £12 million slate of projects. However, by June, they withdrew from production once again. &quot;The decision was made to plunge on in and then it was pulled back&quot;, said Williams. The Rank films that had been announced for production – including an adaptation of &quot;HMS Ulysses&quot;, &quot;The Rocking Horse Winner&quot; and a film version of &quot;To the Manor Born&quot; – were cancelled. &quot;It now takes too long to recoup money on films,&quot; said a spokesman for Rank.

The following year, Rank reported a record pre-tax profit of £102 million. According to Tony Williams:
After a time Rank Film Distributors was in trouble because they hadn&#x27;t got any new product. So Rank Film Distributors was then given chunks of money to go and buy into pictures because they made a blunder. And they carried on, on that basis, not directly making them and they had no direct control over what they made at all, no influence. They just bought into pictures. They did an output deal with Orion and that carried on until they sold the shooting match. Then the decision was made to get out of (the) film (industry), so RFD was closed down, Rank Film Advertising was sold off, eventually, the laboratories went. Cinemas was the last one to go.

In 1982, the company partnered with Andre Blay Corporation to license its British title library to home video. In 1986, Rank Film Distributors and archrival Cannon Screen Entertainment signed a deal with the BBC to gain access to Rank&#x27;s nineteen feature offerings. In 1987, the Rank Film Distributors group received a $100 million fund for film financing, and the Rank Film and Television division had invested in $32 million that they would take the budget against non-U.S. rights.

In 1995, the Rank Group acquired all the outstanding shares of the Rank Organisation. In spring 1997, the Rank Group sold Rank Film Distributors, including its library of 749 films, to Carlton Communications for £65 million and immediately became known as Carlton/RFD Ltd. Pinewood Studios and Odeon Cinemas were both sold off in February 2000 for £62 million and £280 million respectively. The company finally severed its remaining connections with the film industry in 2005, when it sold its DVD distribution business and Deluxe technical support unit.

<text>Butlin&#x27;s is a chain of large seaside resorts in the United Kingdom, incorporated as Butlins Skyline Limited. Butlin&#x27;s was founded by Billy Butlin to provide affordable holidays for ordinary British families.

Between 1936 and 1966, ten camps were built, including one in Ireland and one in the Bahamas. In the 1970s and 1980s, Butlin&#x27;s also operated numerous large hotels, including one in Spain, a number of smaller holiday parks in England and France, and a revolving restaurant in the Post Office Tower in London.

Tough competition from overseas package holiday operators, rising operational costs, and rapidly changing demand, forced many of the Butlin&#x27;s operations to close in the 1980s and 1990s. Three of the original camps remain open under the Butlins brand in Bognor Regis, Minehead, and Skegness. They are now owned and run by Butlins Skyline Ltd, which is now wholly owned by the Harris Family Trust.

==History==

Billy Butlin&#x27;s inspiration for his holiday camp empire came from an unhappy holiday on Barry Island in his youth, when he had been locked out of his bed and breakfast accommodation all day by his landlady, which was normal practice at the time. 
The first of the Butlin&#x27;s holiday camps was opened by Butlin in 1936 in Skegness, following his success in developing amusement parks. A second camp quickly followed in Clacton in 1938, and construction of Filey Holiday Camp began in 1939. With the outbreak of the Second World War, building at Filey was postponed, and the camps at Skegness and Clacton were given over for military use. Wartime use of Butlin&#x27;s camps continued, with resorts at Ayr, Filey, and Pwllheli being completed and opened as military camps. The Ayr camp was later renamed &quot;Wonderwest World&quot;, and is now owned and run by Haven, part of Bourne Leisure, who previously owned both brands.

In 1945, with the war over, Filey was re-opened as a holiday camp. The camps at Skegness and Clacton opened in 1946, Ayr and Pwllheli in 1947 and Mosney on the east coast of Ireland in 1948. Butlin&#x27;s became popular in post-war Britain, with family entertainment and activities available for the equivalent of a week&#x27;s pay.

In 1948, Butlin acquired two hotels in the Bahamas, and in the 1950s Butlin&#x27;s began acquiring hotels in England and Wales: Saltdean, near Brighton (1953), Blackpool (1955) and five in Cliftonville (1955–1956). Further post-war camps were opened in the 1960s at Bognor Regis (1960), Minehead (1962) and Barry Island (1966). A site was acquired and permission given for a further camp at Holme Dunes, Norfolk. However, these plans were abandoned after the devastating floods of 31 January 1953; the site was later purchased by the Norfolk Naturalists Trust in 1965.
In the late 1940s, Butlin&#x27;s launched an ambitious project to build a 1000-guest resort at West End, Grand Bahama Island in the Bahamas from scratch, including the construction of an airport, West End Airport. Almost all materials and equipment had to be brought in by air or boat onto an island that at the time was almost completely undeveloped. Butlin&#x27;s operated the partially-completed facility for one season (1950) only before running out of money. A small part of the resort was put back into operation in 1955 before US interests redeveloped it in 1960.

The camps at Ayr and Skegness also had separate self-contained hotels within their grounds. In later years, they were joined by further hotels in Scarborough (1978), Llandudno (1981), London (1993), a sixth hotel at Cliftonville and one in Spain (1983). In the 1960s and 1970s, the company also operated the &quot;Top of the Tower&quot; revolving restaurant at the then-named Post Office Tower in London. 
In 1968, Butlin&#x27;s son Bobby took over the management of Butlin&#x27;s, and in 1972 the business was sold to the Rank Organisation for £43 million. The number of camps peaked at ten between 1966 and 1980, but the business experienced the problems being faced by the British seaside holiday industry as a whole, with the introduction of cheap package holidays to Mediterranean resorts from the 1960s onwards. It also had an image problem of being seen as providing regimented holidays, which caused it to all but abandon the Butlin&#x27;s name at its remaining resorts between 1987 and 1990.

The camp at Mosney closed in 1982, Clacton and Filey closed in 1983, and the camp at Barry was sold in 1986 (eventually closing in 1996). The lease on the &quot;Top of the Tower&quot; restaurant expired in 1980. In 1998, the camps at Ayr and Pwllheli were handed over to Butlin&#x27;s sister company; Haven. All the Butlin&#x27;s hotels dating from the 1950s to 1990s were sold in 1998, but most are still open today under different ownership. The art deco style Ocean Hotel at Saltdean has been redeveloped into apartments, and the hotels at Cliftonville have both been demolished.

In 1998, the &quot;Holiday Worlds&quot; branding was dropped for the remaining resorts in favour of returning the emphasis to the core Butlin&#x27;s name. Subsequently, in September 2000, the resorts and brand were sold to Bourne Leisure. A new Butlin&#x27;s logo was eventually introduced in 1999, which has subsequently undergone several modifications and was used until 2011 when Butlin&#x27;s introduced a design similar to their original logo. The new logo was originally only intended to be used temporarily to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Butlin&#x27;s, but its use continued into 2012 and 2013 and is now the official logo.

In 2005, the new £10 million Shoreline hotel was unveiled at the Bognor Regis resort to expand on the existing variety of apartments on the site. The hotel, styled with an Art Deco theme, aimed to offer luxury accommodation in conjunction with the entertainment and facilities at the resort. Each of the 160 rooms features floor-to-ceiling windows, twin or king-size beds, leatherette chairs, televisions, DVD players and en-suite facilities. Some have sea views. A second site, Ocean Hotel, opened at Bognor in 2009, styled in a high contemporary standard.

In September 2022, it was announced that Blackstone Group that had bought Butlins in 2021 and the Bourne Leisure Group, sold Butlins back to one of the original founding families of Bourne Leisure. In a £300 million deal The Harris Family Trust bought back Butlins, the deal however does not include Butlins property assets as these were sold earlier in the year to the UK’s largest pension fund, the Universities Superannuation Scheme for £300 million. 

==Locations==

In addition to these main locations known at various times as &quot;Holiday Camps&quot;, &quot;Holiday Centres&quot;, &quot;Holiday Villages&quot;, &quot;Holiday Worlds&quot; and more recently as &quot;Resorts&quot;, Butlins also operated numerous smaller holiday parks in England and France for several years during the late 1970s. These were known as &quot;Freshfields holidays&quot; and were more basic parks with far fewer facilities and little or no entertainment. They were aimed at those wanting a quieter, more relaxed holiday.

==Facilities==

===Accommodation===
Butlins resorts offer various accommodation options to cater for different tastes and budgets. These range from &quot;Standard&quot; rooms and apartments to &quot;Silver&quot;, &quot;Gold&quot;, and &quot;Deluxe&quot; rooms and apartments for higher levels of luxury. There are also &quot;BlueSkies&quot; apartments available at Minehead, and 3 luxury hotels at Butlin&#x27;s Bognor.

Butlins was originally known for its &quot;chalet&quot; accommodation, which for decades was the only form of accommodation and consisted of many long blocks. These were arranged so that each line of chalets faced another line, with a grassed area in the middle. Originally there were no toilets in individual chalets (campers had to use communal toilet blocks located in the middle of every few chalet lines) and the furnishings were very basic. Many of these chalet lines are still in use today, but have been enlarged and significantly upgraded to modern standards. All chalets now have en-suite bathroom facilities.

One of the first chalets is still standing at the Skegness resort and is now heritage listed and a historical display only.

===Skyline Pavilion===
The &quot;Skyline Pavilion&quot; is the central entertainment complex at each resort, which is enclosed under a white tensile fabric canopy. These were created during the 1998-99 closed season by linking together several pre-existing buildings so that space within those buildings could be used to provide all-weather facilities within the Skyline Pavilions.

Each Skyline Pavilion contains a stage (used mainly for daytime children&#x27;s shows), a cafe and associated seating, a bar (known as Bar Rosso, The Jellyfish Lounge, Soho Coffee or Costa Coffee), restaurants such as Burger King, Papa Johns, Turner&#x27;s, an amusement arcade, an information counter (termed &quot;infunmation point&quot;), and various shops selling novelties, souvenirs, and groceries. Many of the other venues and attractions in the resort can be accessed directly from within the Skyline Pavilion also.

===Splash Waterworld===
Each resort features a large indoor waterpark known as Splash Waterworld. These contain several waterslides, spas, a wave pool, and a lazy river. There is also a shallow pool area for young children, and sometimes an area for &quot;serious&quot; swimming. Minehead also has an outdoor toddler pool that is open in the summer months. Guests and day visitors can use these facilities at no additional cost. In 2013, the Skegness resort opened a £16 million redevelopment of the Splash Waterworld that features 2 new octane flumes (Jet Stream and Vortex, which has a space-bowl), a new dinghy ride (The Riptide), a rope-walk challenge (Captain&#x27;s Challenge), a lazy river, a poolside cafe and DJ. It also has a new outdoor fountain area that replaced the outdoor pool, the fountains go along with music (every hour) and lights. Butlins opened a new Splash Waterworld at the Bognor Regis resort in spring 2019 carrying a vintage seaside funfair theme.

==Entertainment==
There are various large entertainment venues within the resorts including Centre Stage, Studio 36, Reds and Skyline Stage. Additionally, there are is Bar Rosso, Hotshots 10-pin bowling centre with bar and snooker tables, Green Baize snooker hall (originally at all camps but now at Skegness only), and several additional bars, pubs, and cafes which vary from one Butlins resort to another. Nearly all entertainment is included in the cost of the holiday or day visitor entry. 

===Notable headliners at Centre Stage (Bognor Regis)===
*&quot;Spider-Man The Musical&quot; (30 April 1999 – 25 June 1999)

*&quot;Casper The Musical&quot; (28 June 1999 – 4 September 1999)
*&quot;Spider-Man The Musical&quot; (6 September 1999 – 26 November 1999)

==Sports and recreation==
Butlins resorts offer a variety of sports sessions and coaching, for example, archery, fencing, tennis (Skegness only), table tennis, and football. Most of these sessions are included in the cost of holiday or day visitor entry price.

For general recreation, facilities include multi-sports courts, adventure golf, adventure playgrounds, water zorbing, high ropes courses, funfair, inflatable castles/pillows, and go-karts. Minehead resort also offers bumper boats, donkey rides, use of the adjacent golf course, and &quot;Exmoor Adventures&quot; country leisure pursuits. An additional charge usually applies for most of these activities, although the funfair is free.

Skegness and Bognor resorts each have a spa complex for massage, swimming, facials and other popular spa treatments.

===Children&#x27;s activities===
There are a number of attractions and facilities at each resort provided especially for younger children. These include playgrounds, a supervised arts &amp; crafts room, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Yard&quot; (miniature funfair), a &quot;Junior driving school&quot; with small go-karts for children, and a nursery which can care for children and keep them entertained whilst parents enjoy other activities in the resort.

==Bognor Regis==

Butlins Bognor opened in 1960. The camp later became known as Southcoast World until 1998 and is now known as Butlins Bognor Regis Resort. In 1999 it was renovated again with the construction of a Skyline Pavilion. In 2005, a new £10m hotel called &quot;The Shoreline&quot; was unveiled at the Bognor Regis resort. A second hotel &quot;The Ocean&quot; opened on the site in Summer 2009 and general landscaping and upgrading also took place. In July 2012 a third hotel &quot;The Wave&quot; hotel was opened to guests.
==Minehead==

Butlins Minehead was opened to the public on 26 May 1962. It underwent substantial renovation in the 1980s, being renamed &quot;Somerwest World&quot;. In 1998 it was renovated again with the construction of a Skyline Pavilion. Since 1999 the Minehead resort has undergone further aesthetic upgrades. However, most of the original buildings remain, including almost all the original chalets. As such Minehead is now the last remaining Butlins camp that is still largely as Sir Billy designed it. Minehead is the largest resort out of the three remaining open parks.
==Mosney==
Mosney was the first Butlins camp outside the UK. The camp opened in 1948, occupying some 200 acres (0.81 km2) of a former country estate. In 1982, Butlins sold the camp, which was renamed &quot;Mosney Holiday Centre&quot;. The camp continued without substantive changes, however, the last season for Mosney was 2000. Dwindling visitor numbers and problems finding staff for the short 12-week season eventually led to the camp&#x27;s closure. In December 2000 a five-year deal was signed with the government to turn Mosney into a refugee centre. Mosney is now home to 700 refugees from over 20 countries. Like Minehead, most of the original buildings remain, including all the original chalets. Mosney is the only camp that has changed little since it was opened.
==Skegness==
Butlins Skegness was the first of Billy Butlin&#x27;s holiday camps. The camp opened in 1936 but was taken over for military use in 1939, and known as HMS Royal Arthur. The camp reopened to holidaymakers in 1946. In 1987 the site underwent renovation with the construction of a modern fun pool and modernised accommodation, at this time the site was renamed &quot;Funcoast World&quot;. In 1998 it was renovated again with the construction of a Skyline Pavilion and since that time has undergone further improvements and maintenance in 2011 the resort underwent more development with the introduction of a new guest catering restaurant called The Deck, a new Italian styled restaurant called Ludo&#x27;s (named after the dinosaur that appeared in the 2010/11 TV adverts), in 2013 the new Splash Waterworld opened adding a new pool area to the resort and plans have recently been submitted to modernise the resort once again with further investment into new restaurants and stores.
==Barry Island==

Butlins Barry Island was the last of Billy Butlin&#x27;s holiday camps. The camp opened in 1966 and closed 20 years later. It was sold to Majestic Holidays in 1987 and renamed to Majestic Barry Island.
==Ayr==


Butlins Ayr was built by Billy Butlin as a naval training camp in 1940. The camp opened to the public in 1946.

In 1948 Butlin also opened a hotel on the site and a railway station serving the camp. In 1987 a refurbishment saw the camp re-branded &quot;Wonderwest World&quot; and the creation of a new indoor fun-pool along with modernised accommodation.

The site was re-branded to sister company Haven Holidays in 1999 and renamed &quot;Craig Tara&quot;. Since then, the focus has moved to replacing the original chalets with static caravans.
==Pwllheli==

Butlins Pwllheli was built by Billy Butlin as a naval training camp in 1940. After the war, the camp opened to the public in 1947. In 1987 a refurbishment saw the camp renamed &quot;Starcoast World&quot; and the creation of a new indoor fun-pool along with modernised accommodation. In 1999 the site was re-branded to sister company Haven Holidays and renamed &quot;Hafan Y Môr.&quot;.
==Butlins Park==

In an early use of the name, in 1932 Billy Butlin opened an amusement park called Butlins Park at Littlehampton on the site of the old east bank fort and windmill. It is currently known as Harbour Park.

==Music weekends==
Butlins music weekends are over 18s only and are offered regularly across all of the three resorts. Each weekend has a different musical theme, including soul music, alternative, folk, disco, and rock and blues. They also have decade themed weekends from the 1960s to the 2000s. 
Butlins Music Weekends have played host to big-name acts such as Beverley Knight, Brand New Heavies, Toyah, Buzzcocks, Rick Astley, David Gest &amp; Friends and many more. Madness have also held three weekends in Minehead on their House of Fun tour, taking over the whole resort for the weekend.

===All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties===

All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties was a music festival which takes place at Minehead. Named after the song &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; by the Velvet Underground, it was an alternative to larger mainstream festivals and was presented in a more intimate environment than a giant stadium or huge country field. &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; was a sponsorship-free festival where the organisers and artists stay in the same accommodation as the fans.

===Bloc Weekend===

Bloc Weekend is an annual music festival, devoted to electronic music of several genres, and incorporates both DJ sets and live shows. The first two Bloc events took place at Pontin&#x27;s holiday camp in Norfolk. The 2009 event, which took place during 13–15 March, was moved to the larger Minehead resort. The 5,000 capacity event still sold out before the festival began. In 2010 and 2011, Bloc returned to Minehead for another sold-out show.

==Butlins and Dodgem Cars==
Dodgem Cars, a brand of bumper cars, were manufactured in the US by Dodgem Cars Ltd. Billy Butlin saw them and obtained the UK franchise. As a result, a Skegness funfair owned by Billy Butlin saw the first Dodgems cars in the UK in 1923.

==Butlins Beaver Club on the radio==
In 1956 Butlins Beaver Club – &quot;with Uncle Eric Winstrone&quot; was heard in the United Kingdom and much of continental Europe on Sunday nights at 6:00 pm over the 208 m wavelength of Radio Luxembourg.

==Reds TV==
The origins of the in-house TV system began in 1995 when Butlins decided to make use of the then &#x27;empty&#x27; fifth channel (Channel 5 was still two years away from its launch). A teletext system was installed, together with a backing of incidental music, overseen by Redcoat/Stage Manager Tony Filer – and piped through to the guests&#x27; chalets to provide first an alternative, then an accompaniment to the printed programme of events. Filer (now a successful radio producer) installed a video camera in the new &#x27;studio&#x27; to enable visiting celebrity interviews and &#x27;Know your Redcoats&#x27; discussions to be shown. The Butlins &#x27;Channel 5&#x27; name was changed to &#x27;BTV&#x27; a year before the new fifth terrestrial TV channel emerged – and later became known as &#x27;Reds TV&#x27;.

==Publicity==

===Butlins badges===

From 1936 until 1967, on arrival at Butlins each camper was issued with an enamel badge unique to that camp or hotel, to wear for the duration of their holiday. The badge granted the camper readmission to the site should they take a trip out during their stay. Each camp had at least one badge each year, with most of the larger camps having several colour variations throughout the season for improved security. Occasionally, two different designs would be used in one season.

The badges were made of die-stamped metal (usually brass), highly polished or chrome plated with the brightly coloured design made of vitreous enamel using a process similar to Champlevé but the troughs being stamped in rather than carved.

Each badge was handmade by jewellery manufacturers in London, Dublin or in Birmingham&#x27;s &#x27;Jewellery Quarter&#x27;. It was the practice for some campers to keep badges from previous holidays and wear them all on a ribbon. Some have become collectors&#x27; items. Additional badges included &#x27;Second Week&#x27; badges, Staff badges, &#x27;Concessionaire&#x27; badges (for visiting tradesmen – these badges are distinguished by the absence of enamel), Committee badges, Christmas badges, Beaver Club badges, Reunion badges and many others.

Badges were not issued during Second World War years of 1940 to 1945 as the camps were taken over by the government and used as accommodation for war service personnel.

Notable badges include &#x27;Skegness 1936&#x27; (the first badge issued) and &#x27;Filey 1945&#x27;, which features the &#x27;V for Victory&#x27; in its design and is an exception to the gap of the war years as the camp was the first to reopen after the war just in time for the end of the season in August 1945.

The Barry Island 1965 is particularly rare, as the badges were manufactured but never issued, due to the camp not opening that year as planned.

In 2004, Butlins has again begun selling similar style badges in their on-resort souvenir shops. Some of these are of a more modern design, whilst some are close or exact replicas of badges from Butlins earlier days. The current badges, however, serve no purpose in identifying guests and are available purely as nostalgic souvenirs. Many regular guests like to swap badges with Butlins staff, who often have special badges to swap which are not otherwise available to guests. The badge collection ribbons are also sold in Butlins shops and may be used to pin multiple badges to.

Members of the Premier Club (Butlins loyalty club for regular guests) receive a free badge each time they visit, with a new design given each year.

===Slogans===
Throughout most of its history, Butlins has regularly advertised using various media. Examples of slogans include:
* Early slogans from the 1930s to 1950s included &quot;Our True Intent Is All For Your Delight&quot;, &quot;A weeks holiday for a weeks pay&quot;, &quot;Holidays are Jollidays&quot; and &quot;Holidays with pay. Holidays with play!&quot;
* 1960s &quot;You&#x27;ll have a really wonderful time at Butlins by the sea&quot;
* 1970s &quot;Butlinland is Freedomland&quot; and &quot;A holiday that&#x27;s out of this world&quot; (well known campaign that featured two blue-skinned alien characters called Toot and Ploot in various Butlin&#x27;s locations).
* Early 1980s &quot;A little bit of this, and quite a lot of that&quot;
* Mid 1980s &quot;Butlin it once and you&#x27;ll do it again!&quot;
* 1990s &quot;Let yourself go, and you won&#x27;t want to leave&quot; and &quot;No.1 for family fun&quot;
* Approx 1999–2002 &quot;Come to life. Come to Butlins&quot;
* Approx 2002–2004 &quot;A million holidays. One Butlins&quot;
* 2005–2007 &quot;Kids love it&quot;
* 2007–2009 &quot;Altogether More Fun&quot;
* 2010 &quot;Isn&#x27;t it time you came round to Butlins?&quot;
* 2011 &quot;Happy Days&quot; then &quot;Happiness is...&quot;
* 2012 to 2014 &quot;Our True Intent Is All For Your Delight&quot; (a return to the very first, William Shakespeare-inspired slogan used by Sir Billy Butlin)
*2014 to 2020 &quot;Butlins by the sea&quot; same as the 1960s slogan with &#x27;Our True Intent Is All For Your Delight&#x27; still very much in use around resort and for staff training
*2020 &quot;Ready to Butlins&quot;

==Butlins in popular culture==
Butlins has appeared in popular culture too many times to list here. However, below are a few notable examples.

The 1947 film &quot;Holiday Camp&quot; was filmed mainly on location at Butlins Filey, although the establishing shot was of Butlins Skegness.

On the show &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; (series 3, episode 1, first broadcast on 27 September 1973) there was a sketch parodying the BBC war drama &quot;Colditz&quot;. The two main characters finally escape over the wall of the infamous POW camp, only to wake up in a worse one – a dreary place called &quot;Butlitz&quot;, a spoof of Butlins, where the German guards are dressed like Redcoats.

During the 1980s the BBC produced a sitcom called &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; set in &quot;Maplin&#x27;s&quot;, a farcical holiday camp loosely styled on Butlins. Its writers (Jimmy Perry and David Croft) had themselves been Redcoats at Butlins. A later documentary series called &quot;Redcoats&quot; followed Redcoats through their seasons at Butlins.

In the film version of The Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; (1975) there is a &#x27;Bernie&#x27;s Holiday Camp&#x27; where Tommy&#x27;s mother meets her new husband.

In the television show &quot;Lost&quot; the character of Charlie Pace learns to swim with his father at a Butlins camp.

The 1987 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV serial &quot;Delta and the Bannermen&quot; was filmed mainly at the Butlins camp on Barry Island, Wales. The camp is referred to as the &#x27;Shangri-La&#x27; holiday camp, run by &#x27;Burton&#x27;.

The song Stay Free by The Clash uses the term &quot;Butlins&quot; as slang for prison, as the singer (Mick Jones) sings to his recently imprisoned friend, &quot;I did my very best to write / How was Butlins? Were the screws too tight?&quot; (&quot;screws&quot; being slang for prison guards).

Many books have been written about Butlins and its history, and about the life of Sir Billy Butlin. Some of these are:
* 
* 

There have also been a number of children&#x27;s fiction books which include Butlins as a location or an integral part of the story. For example:

<text>Lossless predictive audio compression (LPAC) is an improved lossless audio compression algorithm developed by Tilman Liebchen, Marcus Purat and Peter Noll at the Institute for Telecommunications, Technische Universität Berlin (TU Berlin), to compress PCM audio in a lossless manner, in contrast to lossy compression algorithms.

It is no longer developed because an advanced version of it has become an official standard under the name of MPEG-4 Audio Lossless Coding.

<text>Beanie Babies are a line of stuffed toys created by American businessman Ty Warner, who founded Ty Inc. in 1986. The toys are stuffed with plastic pellets (&quot;beans&quot;) rather than conventional soft stuffing. They come in many different forms, mostly animals.

Created in 1993, Beanie Babies emerged as a major fad and collectible during the second half of the 1990s. They have been cited as being the world&#x27;s first Internet sensation. They were collected not only as toys, but also as a financial investment due to their high resale value.

==History==
Warner introduced Beanie Babies in 1993 at the North American International Toy Fair/World Toy Fair in New York City, New York. Manufacturing began in 1994, and the toys were first sold in stores in Chicago, Illinois for around 5 U.S. Dollars. There were nine original Beanie Babies: Legs the Frog, Squealer the Pig, Spot the Dog, Flash the Dolphin, Splash the Whale, Chocolate the Moose, Patti the Platypus, Brownie the Bear (later renamed Cubbie), and Pinchers the Lobster (with some tags misprinted &quot;Punchers&quot;). Ty, Inc. has allowed only small, toy or gift stores to sell Beanie Babies. 

Sales were slow at first. By 1995 many retailers refused to buy the bundles the toys were offered in; other retailers refused to buy Beanie Babies. Around the same time, Ty, Inc. began restricting production and distribution: stores could buy only 36 of each character per month. Warner also decided to &quot;retire&quot; characters after a certain period of time, meaning their production would eventually cease. The resulting scarcity led to a significant increase in sales, and it started the trend of collecting and reselling Beanie Babies. Their popularity soon grew into a national craze in the US. 

In 1996, Ty, Inc. released Teenie Beanies, a line of miniature Beanie Babies. They were sold alongside McDonald&#x27;s Happy Meals to celebrate the Happy Meal&#x27;s 17th anniversary. They also partnered with other companies.

Ty, Inc. announced that they would stop producing Beanie Babies in December 1999, but high demand soon led them to reconsider. Production restarted in 2000 with a Beanie Baby named &quot;The Beginning.&quot;

In early 2008, Ty released a new version of Beanie Babies called Beanie Babies 2.0. The purchase of a Beanie Baby 2.0 provided its owner with a code to access an online Beanie Babies interactive website. However, the website has since been shut down.

==Design==
Beanie Babies are deliberately under-stuffed. This led to a criticism that the toys looked &quot;cheap&quot;; however, this set them apart from most stuffed animals on the market which could not be posed easily. Ty Warner has said that this understuffing method made the toys look &quot;real&quot;.

Another important design element is the tag. Since the beginning, Beanie Babies have included two tags for identification: a heart-shaped &quot;swing tag&quot; at the top, and a fabric &quot;tush tag&quot; at the bottom. Both tags have been redesigned completely over time. Between 1994 and 1996, the swing tags had &quot;To&quot; and &quot;From&quot; blanks in them for use as gifts. Starting in early 1996, the tags include four-line poems related to the Beanie Baby, and a date of birth for the toy. The poem and birthday concept was created by Lina Trivedi, who is credited as authoring the poems on the first 136 Beanie Babies that were introduced to the marketplace.

It was not uncommon for Beanie Babies to be accidentally shipped out with incorrect or misspelled tags, which sometimes increased the toy&#x27;s value. On occasion, the poems, birth dates and even the names have been changed on certain Beanie Babies.

== Marketing ==
Early on, Ty had trouble finding retailers to order Beanie Babies. To get small retailers to stock the product, Ty introduced Beanie Babies at the 1993 Toy Fair in New York City. This event helped garner attention for the set of plush toys. In 1994, small local stores in Chicago, Illinois, began selling Beanie Babies for around 5 US dollars.

Early in 1995, Ty created the first iteration of the Ty website, the first business-to-consumer website designed to sell to consumers directly. To go along with the launch of the Ty website in 1995, all Beanie Baby hangtags were printed with the Ty website URL and a new piece of text was added with the company&#x27;s name and the following message &quot;Visit our website&quot;. As a result, many consumers visited Ty&#x27;s website for more information on Beanie Babies. This endeavor would mark the beginning of the Beanie Babies boom.

Later in 1995, Ty was forced to end production on the popular toy Lovie the Lamb, owing to an issue with suppliers in China. CEO Ty Warner came up with the solution to tell retailers that Lovie was merely discontinued, and even suggested that many other Beanie Babies would be discontinued as well. This news would spread via word of mouth, as motivated sellers began to stock up on Ty plush toys while they still could, thus creating a new demand for Beanie Babies. As a result of this artificial demand, consumers began buying Beanie Babies in bulk from the Ty website to relist them on auction sites for highly inflated prices.

==Collectibility==
Beanie Babies began to emerge as popular collectibles in late 1995, and became a hot toy. The company&#x27;s strategy of deliberate scarcity, producing each new design in limited quantity, restricting individual store shipments to limited numbers of each design and regularly retiring designs created a huge secondary market for the toys and increased their popularity and value as a collectible.

Ty Inc. would systematically retire various designs, and many people assumed that all &quot;retired&quot; designs would rise in value the way that early retirees had. The craze lasted through 1999 and slowly declined after the Ty company announced that they would no longer be making Beanie Babies and made a bear called &quot;The End&quot;. Some time after the original announcement that the company would stop production, Ty asked the public to vote on whether the product should continue; fans and collectors voted &quot;overwhelmingly&quot; to keep the toys on the market.

At its height of popularity people would flip Beanies for as much as ten-fold on eBay. At their height, Beanies made up 10% of eBay&#x27;s sales. Some collectors insured their purchases for thousands of dollars.

Following are key factors that contributed to the collectible nature of Beanie Babies:
* Unique creative elements – each product contained a unique birthday and poem that was printed on the tag of every Beanie Baby.
* Supply/demand – Scarce availability fell short of the product demand.
* Availability – Beanie Babies were initially only sold in individually-owned small gift and specialty shops.
* New releases and retirements – Several times a year, Ty Inc. would retire certain Beanie Baby characters and the production of said characters would cease to make room for new designs.

Warner was keenly aware that the Beanie Babies bubble could burst and eventually started requiring retailers who sold Beanies to also stock other product lines by his company if they wished to continue selling Beanies. None of these lines did as well as Beanie Babies, although they kept the company alive after the fad ended, and eventually some became successful in their own right.

==Internet==
Ty, Inc. was the first business to produce a business to consumer website designed to engage their market. This was a major contributing factor to the early, rapidly growing popularity of Beanie Babies. By the time the first iteration of the Ty website was published in late 1995 (by Lina Trivedi), only 1.4% of Americans were using the Internet. In tandem with the launch of the Ty Website in 1995, all Beanie Baby hangtags had the Ty Website URL and a call to action printed underneath the poems and birthdays that commanded audiences to visit the company website with text that read: &quot;Visit our web page!!!&quot; As a result, hordes of consumers were visiting the Ty website to gain information about Beanie Babies, which was unprecedented for the time. Ty Inc. was the first business to leverage their website to connect and engage with consumers of their products. This effort evolved into the world&#x27;s first Internet sensation.

==Counterfeit Beanie Babies==
Counterfeit Beanie Babies began to surface in 1997. Early on, cheap knock-offs and fakes of common Beanies were widely available at discount prices.

Authorities cracked down on counterfeit Beanie Babies in the late 1990s. People were prosecuted for their involvement in the commerce of counterfeit Beanies. In 1998, UK authorities seized more than 6,000 counterfeit Princesses and Britannias. In 1999, a Minnesota man was imprisoned, fined, and put on probation for involvement in smuggling counterfeit Beanies.

==Media==
During the wake of Beanie Babies&#x27; success, Beanie Baby-centric publications were issued. One of the largest was &quot;Mary Beth&#x27;s Bean Bag World&quot;, a monthly magazine dedicated to Beanie Babies and competing plush toys. It ran from 1997 to 2001.

In August 2021, Beanie Babies had a feature on season 1, episode 4 of Vice Media&#x27;s &quot;Dark Side of the 90&#x27;s&quot;, titled &quot;Beanie Babies Go Bust&quot;.

A documentary film about Beanie Babies, titled &quot;Beanie Mania&quot;, was released on HBO Max in December 2021.

In July 2023, Apple TV+ released a comedy-drama film titled &quot;The Beanie Bubble&quot;, based on Zac Bissonnette&#x27;s 2015 book &quot;The Great Beanie Baby Bubble: Mass Delusion and the Dark Side of Cute&quot;.

==Licensed Beanies==
In the late 2000s, Beanie Babies modeled after characters from popular children&#x27;s franchises by Nickelodeon, DreamWorks and Paramount began appearing. These included characters from cartoons on the Nickelodeon television channel such as &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot;, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; and &quot;The Backyardigans&quot;, as well as characters from DreamWorks Animation movies such as &quot;Shrek the Third&quot;, and 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs&quot;. Beanie Babies have also been produced for characters from &quot;Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga&#x27;Hoole&quot; and the &quot;Guardians of Ga&#x27;Hoole&quot; book series, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, Hello Kitty, and &quot;Peanuts&quot;. Recently Beanie Babies modeled after Disney characters have been created, including Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Olaf from &quot;Frozen&quot;. In addition, Ty Inc. has produced Beanie Baby toys based on characters from the Disney Junior TV series &quot;Doc McStuffins&quot;, Pixar films like &quot;Cars&quot; and &quot;Finding Dory&quot;, and Marvel Comics superheroes. Ty Inc. has also partnered with Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, and Hasbro to make Beanie Babies of characters from franchises such as &quot;Despicable Me&quot;, &quot;Sing&quot;, and &quot;My Little Pony&quot;. Ty Inc. has also expanded their Nickelodeon Beanie Babies lineup with characters from &quot;PAW Patrol&quot;, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and &quot;Peppa Pig&quot;.

== Charity donations ==
In January 2020, The Beanie Baby &quot;Katy the Koala&quot; was released. Ty announced that 100% of the profits from the sale of Katy would go to the Australian-based animal rescue organisation WIRES (Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service Inc.). In April 2020, H. Ty Warner pledged that 100% of profits from the sale of a limited edition Beanie Baby bear named &quot;Hope&quot; were to be donated to the United Way Worldwide COVID-19 Fund. On March 2, 2022, Warner declared all profits from the sales of Beanie Babies during the month of March would be donated to Save the Children, an organization providing emergency assistance to those in Ukraine.

Warner has donated over $300 million to various charities since the start of the company. Most recently, 100% of profits from a newly released &quot;Max&quot; the dog Beanie Baby were donated to NEXT for Autism.

<text>The Jæren Line () was a long railway line between Stavanger and Egersund in Jæren, Norway. The name is no longer in official use and the section is regarded as the westernmost part of the Sørlandet Line. Owned by Bane NOR, the line has double track from Stavanger Station to Sandnes Station, and single track from Sandnes to Egersund Station. The line is electrified at and equipped with centralized traffic control and GSM-R. The line is served by the Jæren Commuter Rail and intercity trains along the Sørlandet Line, both operated by Go-Ahead Norge. CargoNet runs container freight trains on the line, which terminate at Ganddal Freight Terminal.

The line opened as a narrow gauge stand-alone line on 27 February 1878. The railway was extended from Egersund to Flekkefjord as the Flekkefjord Line in 1904. The Jæren Line&#x27;s only branch, the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård, opened in 1924. In 1944, the Sørlandet Line was extended to Sira on the Flekkefjord Line, and the Jæren Line was integrated in the main railway network. Because of this, the line was converted to standard gauge.

==Route==
The Jæren Line constitutes the section of the Sørlandet Line between Stavanger and Egersund. At the time of the line&#x27;s opening, it was long, but has since the 1950s been long. The railway is double track on the section from Stavanger Station to Sandnes Station, and single track from there to Egersund Station. The line is electrified at and equipped with centralized traffic control, automatic train stop, and GSM-R. The railway line is owned and maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration, a government agency.

The zero marker for the line is located at Stavanger Station, which is from Oslo Central Station and located above mean sea level (AMSL). Previously there was a branch just south of the station which ran through a long tunnel before reaching the port. Southwards from Stavanger, the route largely runs along the waterfront, hugging Gandsfjorden. The first station after Stavanger is Paradis Station ( from Stavanger Station). The line runs past the closed Hillevåg Station and a closed spur to an industrial area at Mariero before reaching Mariero Station (). The line continues past the closed Lyngnes Station, a closed spur to Sørbø Trelast and the closed Vaulen Station. After passing the closed Hinna Station and the closed Jåttå Station, which was exclusively used to serve matches and concerts at Viking Stadion, the line immediately afterwards reaches Jåttåvågen Station (), which also serves the stadium and the newly redeveloped area of Jåtten.

The line continues past Gausel Station (), which in addition to serving a redeveloped area serves as a major transfer hub for buses towards Forus and Sola. Next the line passes the closed Forus Station before running through the long Lurahammer Tunnel and passing the closed Luravika Station and Lura Station.
Through the town center of Sandnes, the line runs as an elevated railway, which previously also included a branch to the port in Sandnes. Sandnes Sentrum Station () is the main station serving the town. The line continues past Sandnes Station (), which is the end of the double track.

After passing the closed Brualand Station and the open Ganddal Station (), the closed Ålgård Line branches off. Ganddal Freight Terminal is the only freight terminal in Jæren. It has an annual capacity for 80,000 containers and can handle long trains. The next station on the mainline are the closed Skjæveland Station and Orstad Station, followed by the operating Øksnevadporten Station (). South of there lays to spurs, to Øksnevad, Kvarnaland and Block Watne. The line continues past the closed Engjelsvåg Station before reaching Klepp Station (). The line continues past the closed Leland Station and the closed Tumarki Station before having a closed spur to Varheia. After passing the closed Vardheia Station, the line reaches Bryne Station ().

Next the line passes a spur to Hetland and then passes four closed stations, Kjelsholen, Hognestad, Gjerdo and Tårland. After reaching Nærbø Station (), the line continues past the closed Kvia Station and the closed Dysjaland Station before reaching Varhaug Station (). Located at AMSL, it is the highest-elevated station on the line. After passing the closed Odland Station, the line runs past the closed Stavnheim Station and reaches Vigrestad Station (). The line continues past the closed Hogstad Station and the closed Stokkaland Station before reaching Brusand Station (). Afterwards it crosses Vauleelva and then runs through the long Varden Tunnel before passing the closed Varden Station and reaching Ogna Station ().

At Ogna there is a distinct change to the landscape, as it changes from a flat to a hilly. Particularly between Bryne and Ogna, the line have a large curve radius, but between Ogna and Egersund this changes to much tighter curvature. After Ogna the line crosses Ognaelv and runs through the long Sirevåg Tunnel before reaching Sirevåg Station (). The line then runs through two tunnels before passing the closed Vatnamot Station and reaching Hellvik Station (). The line continues through six tunnels, the longest being , before passing the closed Maurholen Station. It then passes through four more tunnels and two bridges before reaching Egersund Station (). At Egersund, the line continues as the Sørlandet Line. Originally the Jæren Line ran to the old station in Egersund, which was kept until 1952 as a branch from Egersund Station. This included bridges over Eieelva and Lundeelva.

==History==
===Construction===
During the 19th century, transport along the Jæren coast was dominated by ship. Some simple roads had been built, but these were insufficient for quick and efficient transport. In the mid-19th century, the roads were improved, and ideas were launched to start a traction engine service along the coast. At an 1866 meeting at the sheriff&#x27;s office in, Forest Manager Andreas Tanberg Gløersen launched the first idea of building a railway to connect Stavanger and Egersund. Gløersen had been to the Netherlands where he had taken and observed train operations. Later the same year, a meeting was held with representatives from the municipalities of Hå, Klepp and Time.

The meeting concluded that a railway should be built, and the responsibility for the preparatory work was given to County Governor Vilhelm Ludvig Herman von Munthe af Morgenstierne. He started by conducting traffic counting throughout the district. This resulted in an estimate for a revenue of NOK 215,000 and a cost of NOK 153,000 per year. Originally the proposal was to connect the various villages in Jæren together. But during planning, national authorities stated that the line would be part of a trans-national railway that would connect Rogaland to Eastern Norway. This resulted in the railway being planned with a straighter profile and running via fewer communities.
The proposal was sent to the Ministry of the Interior, who recommended the line and presented it to Parliament on 6 May 1874. Parliament passed legislation to build the line on 3 June 1874. During the celebrations in Stavanger that evening, a gunner lost his hand following the explosion of a cannon. Particularly in Sandnes the choice of route resulted in much debate. Parliament had in its proposal for the line stipulated that the railway should have good port access in Sandnes. The &quot;Blue Line&quot; proposal ran along the waterfront, but would require two different stations in Sandnes. The &quot;Red Line&quot; proposal ran midway through the town center, splitting it in two. However, it gave only a single station, and was eventually chosen, after the municipal council initially had supported the Blue Line.

Construction started in October 1874 on the section between Forus and Gausel. Tracks were shipped to Norestraen, which was the southernmost docks which were sufficiently deep to allow the ships. When the railway was passed, the country was experiencing good times, but through the 1870s, the country fell into harder times. This caused a reduction in spending on the line, which was particularly in investments in stations. A standardized, small station building was chosen and in Egersund an existing house was bought. The line opened on 27 February 1878, and was at the time of opening long. When the line opened, it had no tunnels and only twelve stations. Already the following year, additional stations were opened in Sirevåg, Brusand, and Hognestad. Hillevåg opened in 1880 and Mariero opened in the 1880s.

===Branches and gauge conversion===

On 5 February 1875, the parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways published a report recommending that there be built four trans-national railways to connect western and central Norway to eastern Norway. The Sørlandet Line was part of this plan, and was scheduled to be built between 1876 and 1888. The line was proposed to be built via the Vestfold Line to Skien and onwards along the south coast before connecting with the Jæren Line at Egersund. However, Norway was hit by the Depression of 1882–85, which reduced railway construction to a minimum. In addition, controversy arose over which route should be chosen through Agder: along the populated coast or through the sparsely populated interior. This issue kept the line at bay, and not until 1908 was a decision made in favor of the interior route.

In 1894, the Railway Committee recommended parliament to prioritize three new lines, the Bergen Line, the Rauma Line and the Gjøvik Line. However, this met protests from representatives from Agder, and it became clear that there would not be a majority to build the Bergen Line unless part of the Sørlandet Line was built. Jørgen Løvland proposed a compromise in which the Flekkefjord Line be built from Egersund to Flekkefjord, as the first part of the Sørlandet Line, as well as the Treungen Line. The Flekkefjord Line opened on 31 October 1904. The same year, stations were opened at Forus and Gausel.

The Ålgård Line was originally launched as an alternative route for the Sørlandet Line. In 1910, a committee was appointed to conduct preliminary planning. Although NSB&#x27;s board supported the line, construction was placed on hold. In 1919, local politicians proposed that the line be built administratively as part of the Jæren Line, but this was rejected by the government. Instead, the ministry wanted to again consider the Ålgård Line as part of the Sørlandet Line, and proposed that the Ålgård Line be built with standard gauge—which would be used for the Sørlandet Line—instead of the narrow gauge used by the Jæren Line. However, there would be no need for standard gauge until the Sørlandet Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be built with narrow gauge track, but all other installations would be prepared for standard gauge. The first train to operate on the line went from Stavanger on 20 December 1924, and the Ålgård Line became the last state-owned railway in Norway to be opened with narrow gauge. Not until 1930 was a branch built from the railway station in Sandnes to the port.

The Sørlandet Line was being built in standard gauge, and when the line was to connect to the Flekkefjord Line at Moi Station, the Jæren Line would have to be rebuilt to standard gauge to avoid a break-of-gauge. Preliminary work to ease the conversion was done during the 1920s. The conversion itself took only two days, during which the line was closed. On 29 April 1944, a test train was run from Sira to Stavanger. The upgrade was officially opened on 1 May, after which the Jæren Line was connected to Oslo, and considered part of the Sørlandet Line. When the Jæren Line was built, the station in Egersund was located in the city center. With the opening of the Sørlandet Line, a new station was built north of the city center. The old station remained in use, despite being located on a dead-end track, as it was served by trains terminating in Egersund. However, this section of line was not converted to standard gauge until 1948. Passenger traffic was terminated from 25 September 1952, although the spur remained in use as a port line until 1986.

With the change of gauge, NSB took the opportunity to change the route several places. After these changes, including the move of the station in Egersund, the Jæren Line was reduced to a length of . The changes included building twelve new tunnels on the section between Brusand and Egersund, of which nine were between Hellvik and Egersund. Another tunnel was built at Lurahammer in Sandnes. The tunnels opened between 1947 and 1950.

Sandnes became the third-largest intermediate stop on the Sørlandet Line, after Drammen Station and Kristiansand Station. To better the facilities for serving Sandnes, the track through the city center was rebuilt to an elevated railway. Given the unofficial name The High Line (), the new Sandnes Station was located further south of the center of Sandnes, at Skeiene. The new station and the elevated section opened on 1 October 1955. Also a number of other stations were rebuilt, in part because they had become too small and in part because they needed to be moved because of line realignments during the gauge conversion. New station buildings were opened at Vigrestad in 1954, at Nærbø in 1955, at Sirevåg in 1956, at Bryne in 1958 and at Klepp and Varhaug in 1959. The 1950s also saw the establishment of a new depot at Kvaleberget. New stations were established at Varden and Vardheia in 1956, Lyngnes in 1957 and Luravika in 1959. Tumarki Station was closed in 1957.

In 1955, passenger traffic on the Ålgård Line was terminated, although sporadic freight traffic remained until 1988. On 3 June 1956, the Jæren Line received electric traction. With electrification, NSB introduced three weekly services with the Class 66 multiple units, which were capable of , but the service did not generate sufficient patronage and was terminated in 1958. The remaining long-haul trains were hauled using El 11 locomotives. They were from the 1960s supplemented with El 13 locomotives. The electrification also saw the introduction of electric multiple units for local trains. Originally this consisted of Class 65 and five Class 67. In 1960, the Class 67 units were swapped with Class 68 units.

After the Ofoten Line, the Jæren Line was the first line in Norway to receive centralized traffic control, which was taken into use on 20 March 1964. The section from Sandnes to Egersund followed suit on 7 July. In 1966, 18 stations were closed, consisting of Maurholen, Vatnanot, Stokkaland, Hogstad, Stavnheim, Odland, Dysjaland, Kvia, Tårland, Gjerdo, Vardheia, Laland, Engjelsvåg, Orstad, Skjæveland, Lura, Luravika and Vaulen. During the 1970s, El 14 locomotives were gradually introduced on both freight and passenger trains.

Automatic train stop was introduced on 30 December 1986. During the late 1980s, El 17 locomotives were introduced, but they proved unreliable and were taken out of service after 1998, with the introduction of El 18. In 1991, four Class 69 units were introduced on trains between Egersund and Stavanger, and in 1994, two renovated Class 69 units were moved from Eastern Norway and put into service between Kristiansand and Stavanger. The Scanet train radio system was installed between 1993 and 1996.

===Commuter rail and double track===

The commuter rail system was introduced from 1 January 1992, after an agreement between NSB, Rogaland County Municipality and the six municipalities along the line. NSB introduced new Class 69 multiple units, while the county municipality introduced a fare coordination with the corresponding bus services. The increase in service involved 15 departures per direction per day, and the travel time from Stavanger to Egersund was reduced from 80 to 55 minutes. In addition, NSB introduced a half-hour headway between Stavanger and Sandnes. The stations were upgraded, including new sheds. A new station, Sandnes Sentrum, was opened in the city center of Sandnes. At the same time, the stations with the least patronage, Hognestad and Lyngnes, were closed. NSB stated that the goal was to increase the daily ridership from 2,900 to 5,000 passengers by 1994.

The commuter service was a success, with NSB experiencing a 112 percent increase in ridership the first year. In 1993, NSB won Statens Byggeskikkpris, among other things for the new sheds on the Jæren Line. By 1995, ridership was up 150 percent from before the commuter rail started. In 1997, NSB announced that they would order 36 new electric multiple units, which would among other things replace the aging trains on the Jæren Line. The new Class 72 trains were put into service on 8 August 2002, several years after schedule. In April 2004, the rail administration opened Jåttå Station, which was located close to Viking Stadion, the new home ground of the Norwegian Premier League side Viking FK. The train transported generated a market share of one sixth of the spectators. On 2 January 2007, the Scanet train radio system was replaced with GSM-R.

To further increase capacity and regularity, the Norwegian National Rail Administration decided to rebuild the section from Stavanger to Sandnes to double track. The upgrade involved closing Hillevåg Station, and building three new stations: Paradis, Jåttåvågen and Gausel. Construction was estimated to cost 2.2 billion Norwegian krone. The primary goal of the project was to increase capacity and build stations in areas with transit-oriented development. Travel time between Stavanger and Sandnes was only reduced with four minutes. Construction was done by adding another tack adjacent to the existing one, rather than building a new right-of-way. The upgrades included the construction of of low noise barriers and of conventional high noise barriers. The upgrades were made in such a way that a future tram-train can run on the route. All intermediate stations were built in such a way that they later could be adapted to also serve the light rail service. The route is built to allow the light rail service to enter and leave the Jæren Line at Lura, Gausel, Hinna and Stavager.
Construction of the long section was split into four contracts: Stavanger–Hinna, Jåttåvågen, Jåttåvågen–Lurahammaren and Lurahammaren–Sandnes. The section past Jåttåvågen was the first to commence, in October 2006. The original plans called for this section to be built last, but Stavanger Municipality wanted to prioritize transit-oriented development in conjunction with new major building projects, and therefore the municipality advanced NOK 90 million for the station. In addition to Jåttåvågen Station, a number of bridges were built. The area is a growth area for Stavanger, with the station being located next to Viking Stadion, Jåttå Upper Secondary School and several large workplaces. Jåttåvågen Station opened on 6 January 2008.

Construction of the section from Jåttåvågen to Lurahammaren started in March 2007, while the section from Lurahammaren to Sandnes started in September 2007. The latter is the narrowest part of the line and required the construction of several new bridges. Lurahammaren Tunnel was widened to allow double track, a new bridge was built over the intersection og Langgaten–Strandgaten, a new bridge was built over County Road 44 at Lura, the technical facilities at Sandnes Station were upgraded, and the tracks to the port in Sandnes were removed. Construction on the section between Stavanger and Hinna started in April 2008. As there was already a double track between Kvaleberg and Stavanger Station, only the southern part of the route received new track. However, the existing part was subject to technical upgrades and a new station was built at Paradis to serve the southern part the downtown area. From April to November 2009, the section from Ganddal to Stavanger was closed while the last part of the upgrade was completed. The new line was opened on 16 November 2009 and from 14 December, the 15-minute headway was introduced between Stavanger and Sandnes.

Construction of a new freight terminal at Ganddal started in 2005. The terminal cost NOK 500 million and replaced the terminal at Stavanger Station. Construction 0was completed in 2007 and the terminal opened on 21 January 2008 Both the terminal and the double track were to use the newly developed signaling system Merkur, but the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate would not give permission for the system to be installed. Because of this, the signaling system at the terminal is operated manually and therefore cannot be used with full capacity.

==Service==

The Jæren Commuter Rail is a local services operated by Go-Ahead Norge between Stavanger and Egersund. The service between Stavanger and Sandnes operate with a fixed schedule every 15 minutes. Of the trains to Sandnes, half continue onwards to Nærbø, giving a 30-minute headway. One train per hour operate all the way to Egersund. On weekends and late evenings, there is a reduced service. Travel time from Stavanger to Sandnes is 19 minutes, from Stavanger to Nærbø is 37 minutes, and from Stavanger to Egersund is 1-hour and 7 minutes. The operating deficits are covered through subsidies by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. Go-Ahead uses four-car NSB Class 72 electric multiple units on the service. As of 2011, the service has a weekly ridership of 74,000.

Go-Ahead also operates up to eight daily intercity services to Kristiansand. Up to five of these services continue onwards to Oslo. Travel time from Stavanger to Kristiansand is 3 hours, while travel time all the way to Oslo is seven and a half hours. One of the services to Oslo is a night train. Intercity trains along the Jæren Line only call at Egersund, Bryne, Sandnes Sentrum and Stavanger, with travel time from Stavanger to Egersund being slightly less than an hour. CargoNet operates up to five container freight trains from Oslo per day and one from Drammen per day to Ganddal Freight Terminal.

==Future==
Plans have been made which call for either doubling or tripling the frequency on all the services on the existing commuter rail network. However, increased frequency south of Sandnes will require double track. Should the frequency be doubled, double track would have to be built to where the current service to Nærbø terminates. Plans call for these trains to possibly be extended to either Varhaug or Vigrestad. Should the frequency be tripled, double track would be needed all the way to Egersund. Parts of the Jæren Line is straight enough to permit speeds between . However, several shorter parts need to be rebuilt to allow this, particularly between Egersund and Ogna, and from Bryne to Ganddal. In particular, the section from Ogna to Egersund would probably have to follow an all-new route, should it be rebuilt to double track. The effect of higher maximum speeds is greatest for intercity trains, as the commuter trains have so frequent stops they spend little time at maximum speed.

Egersund Station has been proposed moved back to its old location for the commuter rail, giving Egersund two stations: one for commuter trains and one for regional trains. The right-of-way still exists for this route, making construction easy. A new Sørlandet Line has also been proposed, which would run south instead of north from Egersund. This would mean that a city center location for Egersund Station would be better for intercity trains as well.
Reopening the Ålgård Line as part of the commuter rail service has also been proposed. The first of the line remains in use, allowing freight trains access to a cement factory. The line has officially been closed, but has not been abandoned. The National Rail Administration retains ownership and can in the future renovate the line for operation. The annual traffic potential for the Ålgård Line is 600,000 passengers. Plans call for stations at Vagle, Figgjo, Kongeparken and Ålgård. It is possible to continue the trains that currently terminate at Sandnes to Ålgård without new infrastructure investments to the Sørlandet Line. However, the Ålgård Line would need a full upgrade, including new tracks, electric system and signaling. Ålgård is also a good location for a park and ride for European Road E39.

A branch to Sola has been considered to allow the trains to operate to Sola and Stavanger Airport, Sola. The line would branch from the Sørlandet Line south of Gausel, and be built so trains from the branch could run both northwards and southwards. Proposed stations include the airport, Solakrossen, Forus West, Statoil&#x27;s head office and possibly the shopping center Kvadrat. This would give a travel time of 17 minutes from the airport to the city center, and 10 minutes from the airport to Sandnes. This route has, however, also been proposed as part of the light rail system. It is estimated to generate 2.5 million passengers annually.

Rogaland County Municipality is planning a light rail for Greater Stavanger. The initial plans call for a Y-shaped service which could be operational by 2018, with possibilities for further expansion. As of 2010, the plans call for a line from Stavanger to Sandnes, and a branch to the airport. The travel time from Sandnes to Stavanger would be 29 minutes, and is therefore a supplement to the commuter rail. The light rail would have interchange with the Jæren Line at Stavanger, Paradis, Jåttåvågen, Gausel and Sandnes Sentrum. Several new branches of the light rail have been proposed for later construction.

On 15 December 2019 operation of the line will pass from Vy to Go-Ahead Norge.

<text>The Gongman (also known as the &quot;man-with-the-gong&quot;) is a company trademark for the J. Arthur Rank Organisation. It was used as the introduction to all Rank films, many of which were shot at their Pinewood Studios, and included those Rank distributed. The Gongman logo first appeared on films distributed by General Film Distributors, which was established in 1935 by the British producer C. M. Woolf and J. Arthur Rank; it was C.M. Woolf&#x27;s secretary who thought of the man-with-a-gong trademark. When the Rank Organisation was established in 1937, with General Film Distributors as one of its cornerstones, the logo was adopted for the whole organisation. 

The Gongman film logo sequence depicts a man striking a huge gong with a deep resonant sound. The gongs used in the sequence were props made of plaster or papier-mâché. The sound came from James Blades striking a real gong—specifically a Chinese instrument called a tam tam that was much smaller than the prop. During the sequence, the text &quot;General Film Distributors&quot;, &quot; J. Arthur Rank Film Distributors&quot;, &quot;J. Arthur Rank presents&quot; or &quot;&#x27;The Rank Organisation&quot; appeared over the gong.

The first &quot;Gongman&quot; was Carl Dane, a circus strong man who was paid a one-time fee by General Film Distributors. Athletes who played the Gongman in the film sequence over the years included boxer Bombardier Billy Wells, the second &quot;Gongman&quot;, who was actually the first contracted by J.A. Rank – a subtle but important difference. In later years this position was filled by wrestler Ken Richmond. Also, George Francis Moss Snr played the Gongman.
In 2012, to celebrate the Gongman&#x27;s 75th anniversary, The Rank Group, the gambling company that in 1996 acquired the remaining business interests of the Rank Organisation as well as the rights to its logo and name, announced a nationwide competition to find a new Gongman for the 21st century, Chris Rowley from Stoke-on-Trent won the competition and is the new official Rank Gongman.

==Parodies/Pastiches==
The Gongman&#x27;s recognisability meant it was often parodied.
* In &quot;Carry On up the Khyber&quot;, Kenneth Williams&#x27; character refers to an over-enthusiastic gongman&#x27;s attitude as &quot;rank stupidity&quot;. This was effectively an in-joke as the &quot;Carry On&quot; films were produced and distributed by the Rank Organisation.
* The opening to the &quot;ATV Thursday Picture Show&quot; used an animated version. According to Sub-TV, which has a video of the opening, &quot;the gong-smasher here is a non-muscley man in an old-fashioned swimming costume and a cloth cap!&quot; The man hits an ATV logo, not a gong, and the logo smashes into pieces.
* The &quot;Mad&quot; magazine article &quot;Pizza Pie&quot; (issue #40, July 1958), written and illustrated by longtime contributor Dave Berg, humorously suggests that pizzas may one day be used in the future by the Gongman in lieu of his traditional gong.
* In the &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; spoof &quot;El E.T.E. y el OTO&quot;, there is a logo at the beginning and end of the film for the company &quot;Manuel Esteba P.C.&quot; that shows a muscular man in red briefs hitting a gong that immediately breaks. At the end, he is shown trying to fix the gong, but he fails and cries in frustration.
* The production company ident for American television series &quot;Foul-Ups, Bleeps &amp; Blunders&quot; had two men that were about ready to strike a gong (a la the &quot;Gongman&quot;), with the man on the right (holding the gong mallet) striking the man on the left in the groin region and leaving him in agony (this was followed by the sound of the gong falling on the floor). 
* In the closing seconds of the video to Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, percussionist Roger Taylor mimics the Rank gong man by striking a large tam tam whilst stripped to the waist.
* The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band song &quot;The Intro and the Outro&quot; includes a reference to J. Arthur Rank playing the gong in the band&#x27;s fictional line-up.
* On &quot;The Muppets Go to the Movies&quot;, the Muppets parody the Gongman with &quot;J. Arthur Link&quot;, showing Muppet pig Link Hogthrob in the nude, swinging at the gong, missing, spinning around losing his balance, and hitting the gong with his head. 
* In Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Discworld novel &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; the gong exists in a temple that is a portal to the Dungeon Dimensions. Standing in for the gongman is a suitably proportioned troll made of living rock.
* The now-defunct Swedish film distributor Triangelfilm had a similar vignette with an animated man hitting a triangle.
* During the &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; episode in which the castaways produce a film explaining their situation, Gilligan performs their own version of the Rank logo sequence; when he strikes the gong, he shakes uncontrollably at the vibrations it creates.
* The Hungarian animated movie &quot;Macskafogó&quot; opens with a round cat&#x27;s face which a mouse strikes like a gong.
* The title sequence of the &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot; TV show&#x27;s original run ended with Donald Duck striking a gong, with varying results.
* The opening sequence of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; has the Paramount Pictures logo fade into a similar image of a mountain imprinted on a gong, which is then struck by a gongman. Later on the title character and his love interest use the gong as a shield and means of escape from an attacking gangster.
* In the &quot;Pasadena Jones&quot; segment of the &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; episode &quot;Cinemaniacs&quot;, the opening after the prelude shows Hamton J. Pig swinging at the gong and ringing it.
* &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; opens with Goofy striking a gong with a heavy drumstick. Afterward, the gong falls on his foot, causing him to yell in pain, and it falls over to reveal the title of the movie on the backside.
* In series 3 of the British comedy game show &quot;Taskmaster&quot;, comedian Al Murray recreates the logo sequence as part of a task requiring contestants to &quot;do something that looks brilliant when sped up or slowed down&quot;. When doing so, he strikes the gong with such force that a wig he is wearing falls off, to his surprise.

* Jack Webb&#x27;s production company Mark VII Limited used an ident sequence of a strong man&#x27;s hands stamping the &quot;VII&quot; into a steel plate with one or two ringing blows; Webb freely admitted that the Gongman sequence was the direct inspiration.
