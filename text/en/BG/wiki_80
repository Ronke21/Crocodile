<text>Bolero is a genre of song which originated in eastern Cuba in the late 19th century as part of the trova tradition. Unrelated to the older Spanish dance of the same name, bolero is characterized by sophisticated lyrics dealing with love. It has been called the &quot;quintessential Latin American romantic song of the twentieth century&quot;.

Unlike the simpler, thematically diverse &quot;canción&quot;, bolero did not stem directly from the European lyrical tradition, which included Italian opera and canzone, popular in urban centers like Havana at the time. Instead, it was born as a form of romantic folk poetry cultivated by a new breed of troubadour from Santiago de Cuba, the &quot;trovadores&quot;. Pepe Sánchez is considered the father of this movement and the author of the first bolero, &quot;Tristezas&quot;, written in 1883. Originally, boleros were sung by individual &quot;trovadores&quot; while playing guitar. Over time, it became common for trovadores to play in groups as &quot;dúos&quot;, &quot;tríos&quot;, &quot;cuartetos&quot;, etc. Thanks to the Trío Matamoros and, later, Trío Los Panchos, bolero achieved widespread popularity in Latin America, the United States and Spain. At the same time, Havana had become a fertile ground where bolero composers met to create compositions and improvise new tunes; it was the so-called &quot;filin&quot; movement, which derived its name from the English word &quot;feeling&quot;. Many of the genre&#x27;s most enduring pieces were written then and popularized in radio and cabaret performances by singers such as Olga Guillot and Elena Burke, backed by orchestras and big bands.

Boleros are generally in 4/4 time and, musically, compositions and arrangements might take a variety of forms. This flexibility has enabled boleros to feature in the repertoire of Cuban son and rumba ensembles, as well as Spanish copla and flamenco singers, since the early 20th century. Occasionally, boleros have been merged with other forms to yield new subgenres, such as the bolero-son, popular in the 1930s and 1940s, and the bolero-cha, popular in the 1950s. In the United States, the rhumba ballroom dance emerged as an adaptation of the bolero-son in the 1930s. Boleros can also be found in the African rumba repertoire of many artists from Kinshasa to Dakar, due to the many bolero records that were distributed to radios there as part of the G.V. Series.

The popularity of the genre has also been felt as far as Vietnam, where it became a fashionable song style in South Vietnam before the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and remains popular with Vietnamese.

== History ==
===Origins===


In Cuba, the bolero was perhaps the first great Cuban musical and vocal synthesis to win universal recognition. In time, this dance music spread to other countries, leaving behind what Ed Morales has called the &quot;most popular lyric tradition in Latin America.&quot;

The Cuban bolero tradition originated in Santiago de Cuba in the last quarter of the 19th century; it does not owe its origin to the Spanish music and song of the same name. In the 19th century there grew up in Santiago de Cuba a group of itinerant musicians who moved around earning their living by singing and playing the guitar.

Pepe Sanchez is known as the father of the &quot;trova&quot; style and the creator of the Cuban bolero. Untrained, but with remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost, but two dozen or so survive because friends and students wrote them down. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed.

===Spread in Latin America===


The bolero first spread from the east of Cuba to the Dominican Republic in the year 1895, thanks to &quot;trovador&quot; Sindo Garay, who had previously brought the criolla &quot;La Dorila&quot; to Cuba, giving rise to a lasting interchange of lyrical styles between both islands. In the early 20th century the bolero reached Puerto Rico and Mexico, where it was popularized by the first radio stations around 1915. In Mexico, the genre became an essential component of the thriving trova yucateca movement in Yucatán alongside other Cuban forms such as the clave. It leading exponent was Guty Cárdenas.

By the 1930s, when Trío Matamoros made famous their mix of bolero and son cubano known as bolero-son, the genre was a staple of the musical repertoire of most Latin American countries. In Spain, Cuban bolero was incorporated into the copla repertoire with added elements from Andalusian music, giving rise to the so-called bolero moruno, made famous by composers such as Carmelo Larrea and Quintero, León y Quiroga.

Some of the bolero&#x27;s leading composers have come from nearby countries, as in the case of the prolific Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hernández and the Mexican composers: Agustín Lara and María Grever. Some Cuban composers of the bolero are primarily considered trovadores. Several lyric tenors also contributed to the popularization of the bolero throughout North and South America during the 1930s and the 1940s through live concerts and performances on international radio networks. Included in this group were the Mexican operatic tenors: Juan Arvizu and Nestor Mesta Chayres. Their collaborations in New York City with such musicians as Alfredo Antonini, Terig Tucci, Elsa Miranda and John Serry Sr. on the CBS radio show &quot;Viva América&quot; also introduced the bolero to millions of listeners throughout the United States. Also noteworthy during the 1940s and 1950s were the performances of Trio Los Panchos, which featured the artistry of musicians from Mexico and Puerto Rico including: Chucho Navarro, Alfredo Gil and Hernando Avilés. Boleros saw a resurgence in popularity during the 1990s when Mexican singer Luis Miguel was credited for reviving interest in the bolero genre following the release &quot;Romance&quot;.

== Bolero fusions ==

José Loyola comments that the frequent fusions of the bolero with other Cuban rhythms is one of the reasons it has been so fertile for such a long period of time:
:&quot;La adaptación y fusión del bolero con otros géneros de la música popular bailable ha contribuido al desarrollo del mismo, y a su vigencia y contemporaneidad.&quot;

:(The adaptation and fusion of the bolero with other types of popular dance music has contributed to their development, and to its endurance and timelessness.)

This adaptability was largely achieved by dispensing with limitations in format or instrumentation, and by an increase in syncopation (so producing a more afrocuban sound). Examples would be:
*Bolero in the &quot;danzón&quot;: the advent of lyrics in the danzón to produce the &quot;danzonete&quot;.
*The &quot;bolero-son&quot;: long-time favourite dance music in Cuba, captured abroad under the misnomer &#x27;rumba&#x27;.
*The &quot;bolero-mambo&quot; in which slow and beautiful lyrics were added to the sophisticated big-band arrangements of the mambo.
*The &quot;bolero-cha&quot;, 1950s derivative with a chachachá rhythm.
*The bachata, a Dominican derivative developed in the 1960s.

The lyrics of the bolero can be found throughout popular music, especially Latin dance music.

== Vietnam ==
Bolero music has also spread to Vietnam. In the 1930s, the nation grew fond of modern music, which combined Western elements with traditional music. Vietnamese bolero is generally slower tempo compared to Hispanic bolero, and is similar in style to Japanese enka and Korean trot. Such music was romantic, expressing concepts of feelings, love, and life in a poetic language; this predisposition was hated by Viet Minh, who strived towards shaping the working class at the time.

This genre became colloquially known as &quot;yellow music&quot;, in opposition to the (&quot;red music&quot;) endorsed by the Communist government of Hanoi during the era of the Vietnam War. As a result of North Vietnam winning the war, the music was banned in 1975. Those caught listening to &quot;yellow music&quot; would be punished, and their music confiscated. After the Fall of Saigon, many Vietnamese migrated to the United States, taking their music with them. The ban was lightened in 1986, when love songs could be written again, but by then the music industry was killed.

The government of Vietnam also prohibited the sale of overseas Vietnamese music, including variety shows like &quot;Asia&quot; and &quot;Paris by Night&quot;. In recent years however, bolero had grown popular again, as more overseas singers performed in Vietnam. Additionally, singing competition television series like &quot;Boléro Idol&quot; have grown popular, with singers performing songs, including songs formerly banned.

== Ballroom dance ==
=== International ballroom ===
A version of the Cuban bolero is danced throughout the Latin dance world (supervised by the World Dance Council) under the misnomer &quot;rumba&quot;, often spelled &quot;rhumba&quot;. This came about in the early 1930s when a simple overall term was needed to market Cuban music to audiences unfamiliar with the various Cuban musical terms. The famous &quot;Peanut Vendor&quot;, actually a son-pregón, was so labelled, and the label stuck for other types of Cuban music.

In Cuba, the bolero is usually written in time, elsewhere often . The tempo for dance is about 120 beats per minute. The music has a gentle Cuban rhythm related to a slow &quot;son&quot;, which is the reason it may be best described as a bolero-son. Like some other Cuban dances, there are three steps to four beats, with the first step of a figure on the second beat, not the first. The &quot;slow&quot; (over the two beats four and one) is executed with a hip movement over the standing foot, with no foot-flick.

=== American Rhythm ===
The dance known as bolero is one of the competition dances in American Rhythm ballroom dance category. The first step is typically taken on the first beat, held during the second beat with two more steps falling on beats three and four (cued as &quot;slow-quick-quick&quot;). In competitive dance the music is in time and will range between 96 and 104 bpm. This dance is quite different from the other American Rhythm dances in that it not only requires cuban motion but rises and falls such as found in waltz and contra body movement. Popular music for this dance style need not be Latin in origin. Lists of music used in competitions for American Rhythm Bolero are available.

<text>Rendezvous is a data synchronization mechanism in Plan 9 from Bell Labs. It is a system call that allows two processes to exchange a single datum while synchronizing.

The rendezvous call takes a &quot;tag&quot; and a &quot;value&quot; as its arguments. The tag is typically an address in memory shared by both processes. Calling rendezvous causes a process to sleep until a second rendezvous call with a matching tag occurs. Then, the values are exchanged and both processes are awakened.

More complex synchronization mechanisms can be created from this primitive operation. See also mutual exclusion.

<text>The 1872 Owens Valley earthquake – also known as the Lone Pine earthquake – struck on March 26 at in the Owens Valley (California, along the east side of the Sierra Nevada), with the epicenter near the town of Lone Pine. Its magnitude has been estimated at 7.4 to 7.9, with a maximum Mercalli Intensity of X (&quot;Extreme&quot;). It was one of the most powerful earthquakes to hit California in recorded history and was similar in strength to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Twenty-seven people were killed and fifty-six were injured.

==Tectonic setting==
The earthquake resulted from sudden vertical movement of and right-lateral movement of on the Lone Pine Fault and part of the Owens Valley Fault. These faults are part of a twin system of normal faults that run along the base of two parallel mountain ranges; the Sierra Nevada on the west and the Inyo Mountains on the east of the Owens Valley, and formed fault scarps from north of Big Pine, north of Lone Pine, to Haiwee Reservoir () south of Lone Pine.

==Earthquake==
The earthquake occurred on a Tuesday morning and leveled almost all the buildings in Lone Pine and nearby settlements. Of the estimated 250–300 inhabitants of Lone Pine, 27 are known to have perished and 52 of the 59 houses were destroyed. One report states that the main buildings were thrown down in almost every town in Inyo County. About south of Lone Pine, at Indian Wells, adobe houses sustained cracks. Property loss has been estimated at $250,000 (). As in many earthquakes, adobe, stone and masonry structures fared worse than wooden ones, prompting the closing of nearby Camp Independence, an adobe structure destroyed in the quake.

The quake was felt strongly as far away as Sacramento, where citizens were startled out of bed and into the streets. Extensive rockslides in what is now Yosemite National Park woke naturalist John Muir, then living in Yosemite Valley, who reportedly ran out of his cabin shouting, &quot;A noble earthquake!&quot; and promptly made a moonlit survey of the fresh talus piles. This earthquake stopped clocks and awakened people in San Diego to the south, Red Bluff, to the north, and Elko, Nevada, to the east. The shock was felt over most of California and much of Nevada. Thousands of aftershocks occurred, some severe. 

==Aftermath==
Researchers later estimated that similar earthquakes occur on the Lone Pine fault every 3,000–4,000 years. However, the Lone Pine fault is only one of many faults on two parallel systems.

This earthquake also formed a small graben that later was filled by water, forming Diaz Lake.

The common grave of the earthquake&#x27;s victims is now registered as California Historical Landmark #507.

==California Historical Landmark==
Grave of 1872 Earthquake Victims is a California Historical Landmark number 507, assigned on July 31, 1953.

The California Historical Landmark reads:
:NO. 507 GRAVE OF 1872 EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS- On March 26, 1872, a major earthquake shook Owens Valley, nearly destroying the town of Lone Pine. About fourteen of its victims (the exact number is not known) were interred in a common grave, enclosed by this fence.

<text>Henry Beam Piper (March 23, 1904 – ) was an American science fiction writer. He wrote many short stories and several novels. He is best known for his extensive Terro-Human Future History series of stories and a shorter series of &quot;Paratime&quot; alternate history tales.

He wrote under the name H. Beam Piper. Another source gives his name as &quot;Horace Beam Piper&quot; and a different date of death. His gravestone says &quot;Henry Beam Piper&quot;. Piper himself may have been the source of part of the confusion; he told people the H stood for Horace, encouraging the assumption that he used the initial because he disliked his name. On a copy of &quot;Little Fuzzy&quot; given to Charles O. Piper, Beam&#x27;s cousin and executor, he wrote &quot;To Charles from Henry.&quot;

== Biography ==
Piper was largely self-educated; he obtained his knowledge of science and history &quot;without subjecting myself to the ridiculous misery of four years in the uncomfortable confines of a raccoon coat.&quot; He went to work at age 18 as a laborer at the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Altoona yards in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He also worked as a night watchman for the railroad.

Piper published his first short story, &quot;Time and Time Again&quot;, in 1947 in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;; it was adapted for the radio program &quot;Dimension X&quot; and first broadcast in 1951, and was re-produced for &quot;X Minus One&quot; in 1956. He was primarily a short story author until 1961, when he made a productive, if short-lived, foray into novels. He collected guns and wrote one mystery, &quot;Murder in the Gunroom&quot;.

In 1964, his career apparently on the skids, and prevented by reticence and his libertarian principles from asking anyone to assist him with his financial difficulties, Piper committed suicide. The exact date of his death is unknown; the last entry in his diary was dated November 5 (&quot;Rain 0930&quot;), and according to his Pennsylvania death certificate, his body was found on November 8. According to Jerry Pournelle&#x27;s introduction to &quot;Little Fuzzy&quot;, Piper shut off all the utilities to his apartment, put painter&#x27;s drop-cloths over the walls and floor, and took his own life with a handgun from his collection. In his suicide note, he gave an explanation that &quot;I don&#x27;t like to leave messes when I go away, but if I could have cleaned up any of this mess, I wouldn&#x27;t be going away. H. Beam Piper.&quot;

Some biographers attribute his act to financial problems, others to family problems; Pournelle wrote that Piper felt burdened by financial hardships in the wake of a divorce, and the mistaken perception that his career was foundering (his agent had died without notifying him of multiple sales). Editor George H. Scithers, who knew Piper socially, has stated that Piper wanted to spite the ex-wife he despised: by killing himself, Piper voided his life insurance policy, and prevented her from collecting.

An unpublished story, &quot;Only the Arquebus&quot;, was missing after his suicide; it is probable that he destroyed it along with many of his personal papers.

His output was eventually purchased by Ace Science Fiction and reprinted in a set of paperbacks in the early 1980s. Many of these have since gone out of print, though his two best-known arcs were again reprinted by Ace in 1998 and 2001. Late in his career, Piper corresponded with Pournelle, who was the Ace editor who helped reprint some of his novels.

Many of his earlier copyrights have been allowed to lapse, permitting Project Gutenberg to distribute his work online.

== Themes and hallmarks ==
Piper&#x27;s stories fall into two groups: stark space opera, such as &quot;Space Viking&quot;, or stories of cultural conflict or misunderstanding, such as &quot;Little Fuzzy&quot; or the &quot;Paratime&quot; stories.

A running theme in his work is that history repeats itself; past events will have direct and clear analogues in the future. The novel &quot;Uller Uprising&quot; is the clearest example of this, being based on the Sepoy Mutiny. A similar example is the very title of &quot;Space Viking&quot;, although the novel is not a direct reinterpretation of a specific historical precedent. A later theme in the book involves the takeover of a planet in a manner reminiscent of the rise of Adolf Hitler.

Piper&#x27;s characterization was rooted in the notion of the self-reliant man, able to take care of himself and both willing and able to tackle any situation that might arise. This is exemplified in a bit of dialogue in his short story &quot;Oomphel in the Sky&quot; (1960):

He actually knows what has to be done and how to do it, and he&#x27;s going right ahead and doing it, without holding a dozen conferences and round-table discussions and giving everybody a fair and equal chance to foul things up for him.

As a result, his stories tend towards the heroic, and the conflict is usually driven externally.

Piper was interested in general semantics. It is explicitly mentioned in &quot;Murder in the Gunroom&quot;, and its principles, such as awareness of the limitations of knowledge, are apparent in his later work.

== Major storylines ==
=== Terro-Human Future History ===
The Terro-Human Future History is Piper&#x27;s detailed account of the next 6,000 years of human history. 1942, the year the first fission reactor was constructed, is defined as the year 1 A.E. (Atomic Era). In 1973, a nuclear war devastates the planet, eventually laying the groundwork for the emergence of a Terran Federation, once humanity goes into space and develops antigravity technology.

The story &quot;The Edge of the Knife&quot; (collected in &quot;Empire&quot;) occurs slightly before the war, and involves a man who sees flashes of the future. It links many key elements of Piper&#x27;s series.

Most of the stories take place during the next millennium, during the age of the two Federations. Most notable among these novels are the three Fuzzy novels (starting with &quot;Little Fuzzy&quot;), which concern the recognition of a peculiar alien species as sapient, and the efforts of the two species to learn to live together on the Fuzzies&#x27; home world of Zarathustra.

The Federation collapses in the System States War and following Interstellar Wars (a bit of which can be seen in &quot;The Cosmic Computer&quot;), leading to a lengthy interregnum, during which there is no central human power. &quot;Space Viking&quot; is set in this chaotic period.

The interregnum ends with the founding of the first Empire. At least five empires rule humanity during the next four thousand years, but only a handful of short stories (collected in &quot;Empire&quot;) depict this period. Piper generally portrays these empires as benign, ruled by enlightened despots.

Piper&#x27;s future history resembles in some ways Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation Trilogy&quot;, and was probably influenced by it, especially since both authors wrote for John W. Campbell.

=== Paratime ===
A much shorter series of alternate history stories is Piper&#x27;s Paratime sequence, collected in &quot;Paratime&quot;, followed by the novel &quot;Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen&quot;. These stories concern the Paratime Police, a law enforcement outfit from a parallel world which has learned how to move between timelines. They jealously guard the secret, even as they mine other worlds for their resources. Notably, it appears that humans are in fact Martian refugees who escaped a calamity on their home planet and migrated to Earth.

Unlike many alternate histories which focus on recent historical events, these stories tend to focus on points of divergence far back in the past. For instance, &quot;Lord Kalvan&quot; involves a police officer who is accidentally transported to a world where the ancestors of modern Europeans failed to move into Europe. Instead, the nomadic tribes migrated across Asia and into North America. The people living on the eastern coast of North America in this novel settled the area from the west, and still live in a medieval society.

Many readers point towards the short story &quot;Genesis&quot; (anthologized in &quot;The Worlds of H. Beam Piper&quot;) to suggest that the Terro-Human Future History universe is in fact an alternate world in the Paratime universe, where the Martians&#x27; escape from Mars resulted in their forgetting their heritage and having to start over. However, in several letters to friends and in an article published in a fan magazine, Piper himself listed the true Paratime stories, and he never identified &quot;Genesis&quot; as one. On the other hand, &quot;He Walked Around The Horses&quot; is referenced in &quot;Police Operation&quot; so that is a sidebar story to the series.

Similarly, Piper&#x27;s story &quot;Omnilingual&quot; (1957), which concerns a near-future scientific expedition to Mars under the aegis of an international Earth government, may also be a Paratime story. The scientists and scholars involved in this effort are found &quot;in medias res&quot; excavating the ruins of the advanced human civilization which had been gradually destroyed on the fourth planet some 50,000 years before. In &quot;Omnilingual&quot; there is no mention of the northern hemisphere&#x27;s thermonuclear devastation as a result of the NATO/Communist &quot;cold war&quot; kindled into an orgy of extermination by the impact of an antimatter meteorite, which was detailed by Piper in his story &quot;The Answer&quot; (1959). Throughout the Terro-Human Future History, that conflict and the destruction wrought across the nations of the First and Second Worlds is pervasive as an explanation of the precise manner in which the home planet&#x27;s culture (by way of South America, Australia, and South Africa in particular) comes to influence the planets of Piper&#x27;s Federation and Empire.

=== Other novels ===
* &quot;Murder in the Gunroom&quot; (1953, not science fiction but rather a murder mystery) 
* &quot;Crisis In 2140&quot; (1957, with John J. McGuire, half of Ace Double D-227). This was first serialized in Astounding Science Fiction as &quot;Null-ABC&quot;, copyright 1953.
* &quot;Lone Star Planet&quot; (1958, originally &quot;A Planet for Texans&quot;) with John J. McGuire . The work is a clear and obvious tribute to H.L. Mencken&#x27;s essay &quot;The Malevolent Jobholder&quot; (from &quot;The American Mercury&quot;, June 1924), in which Mencken proposed ...that it shall be no longer &quot;malum in se&quot; for a citizen to pummel, cowhide, kick, gouge, cut, wound, bruise, maim, burn, club, bastinado, flay, or even lynch a [government] jobholder, and that it shall be &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; only to the extent that the punishment exceeds the jobholder&#x27;s deserts. The amount of this excess, if any, may be determined very conveniently by a petit jury, as other questions of guilt are now determined.

:In 1999, the novel won the Prometheus Award, Hall of Fame Award for Best Classic Libertarian SF Novel. This tongue-in-cheek tale features a planet of Texans whose dinosaur-sized cattle have to be herded with tanks, and whose system of government derives its character from Mencken&#x27;s essay. The protagonist is an insubordinate junior diplomat who is appointed as ambassador to this cantankerously independent planet in the hope that he will be assassinated (as the previous ambassador had been), thereby justifying the forcible invasion and conquest of the Texans. The crux of the story is the trial of the previous ambassador&#x27;s assassins—actually paid killers hired by an alien empire also planning invasion—under a legal system that considers the killing of a practicing politician to be justifiable homicide.

<text>Server (or resource) hogging is where a user, program or system places excessive load on a server. &quot;Hogging&quot; aims to significantly degrade performance experienced for clients so that the server &amp; resources itself are so heavily loaded that it fails to perform routine functions. 

==History==

In the early years of time-sharing computer systems in the 1960s it was common for a single institutional mainframe to control many interactive terminals. In such an environment server lag is acutely perceived. Furthermore, in many operating environments, scarce server resources such as CPU-seconds were often metered and charged against the account of the user running the program. An unintentional server hog could prove extremely costly in financial terms. These programs were often called run-away programs or endless loops.

==Resource contention==

Server performance has many dimensions. Any subsystem that becomes excessively loaded can compromise the performance of other clients contending for that subsystem. Common forms of hardware contention include CPU cycles, interrupt latency, I/O bandwidth, available system memory, or aggregate system memory bandwidth. At the software level, contention can arise for buffers, queues, spools, or page tables.

==Known hogs==

It is an accepted practice that servers are appropriately sized by system administrators for the workload (or mixture of workloads) expected, and server performance is closely monitored to establish performance baselines. The server load might include well known server hogs, such as system backup. These tasks are generally scheduled for time periods of light demand, such as in the very early hours on a Sunday morning, with an accepted administrative policy to discourage or prohibit other demands on the server during those time periods.

==Unexpected hogs==

More often, the term server hog is used to designate an unusual load condition where the server performance falls short of the culturally accepted baseline. A common scenario in the early years of computing was an overload condition known as thrashing where the aggregate server performance becomes severely degraded, such as when two departments of a large company attempt to run a heavy report concurrently on the same mainframe. In such a situation, the designation of the server hog becomes a political matter of pointing fingers, as the termination of either long-running report would restore the server to normal performance.

==Internet era==

In the internet era, the nature of server loads greatly changed, as the clients became increasingly dispersed geographically, and often increasingly anonymous, as for example, any member of the public with internet access can request a web server in any part of the world to deliver a web page. In this context, a server hog most commonly designates a malicious server hog—a program written expressly for the purpose of overloading a remote server with excessive requests or excessively difficult requests (such as complex search). Use of a deliberate server hog is known as a denial-of-service attack, a behaviour exhibited by many viruses, worms and trojan horses. It is also possible for a petulant or vindictive computer user to manually overload a remote server by unleashing a crap flood.

==Bots==

A special case is that of a run-away bot, a program that was designed to be helpful by automating a drudgerous task, but due to poor programming or poorly understood circumstances, goes out of control and hammers a server unceasingly at a high rate. A common case is a web spider which accesses too many pages on a web server too quickly at the expense of the server&#x27;s intended audience.

<doc id="319442" wikidata="Q139103" url="?curid=319442" title="San Francisco Chronicle">
<text>The San Francisco Chronicle is a newspaper serving primarily the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California. It was founded in 1865 as &quot;The Daily Dramatic Chronicle&quot; by teenage brothers Charles de Young and Michael H. de Young. The paper is owned by the Hearst Corporation, which bought it from the de Young family in 2000. It is the only major daily paper covering the city and county of San Francisco.

The paper benefited from the growth of San Francisco and had the largest newspaper circulation on the West Coast of the United States by 1880. Like other newspapers, it experienced a rapid fall in circulation in the early 21st century and was ranked 18th nationally by circulation in the first quarter of 2021.

In 1994, the newspaper launched the &quot;SFGate&quot; website, with a soft launch in March and an official launch on November 3, 1994, including both content from the newspaper and other sources. &quot;The Gate&quot;, as it was known at launch, was the first large market newspaper website in the world, co-founded by Allen Weiner and John Coate. It went on to staff up with its own columnists and reporters, and even won a Pulitzer Prize for Mark Fiore&#x27;s political cartoons.

In 2013, the newspaper launched its own namesake website, SFChronicle.com, and began the separation of &quot;SFGate&quot; and the &quot;Chronicle&quot; brands, which today are two separately run entities.

==History==

The &quot;Chronicle&quot; was founded by brothers Charles and M. H. de Young in 1865 as &quot;The Daily Dramatic Chronicle&quot;, funded by a borrowed $20 gold piece. Their brother Gustavus was named with Charles on the masthead. Within 10 years, it had the largest circulation of any newspaper west of the Mississippi River. The paper&#x27;s first office was in a building at the corner of Bush and Kearney Streets. The brothers then commissioned a building from Burnham and Root at 690 Market Street at the corner of Third and Kearney Streets to be their new headquarters, in what became known as Newspaper Row. The new building, San Francisco&#x27;s first skyscraper, was completed in 1889. It was damaged in the 1906 earthquake, but it was rebuilt under the direction of William Polk, Burnham&#x27;s associate in San Francisco. That building, known as the &quot;Old &quot;Chronicle&quot; Building&quot; or the &quot;DeYoung Building&quot;, still stands and was restored in 2007. It is a historic landmark and is the location of the Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences.

In 1924, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; commissioned a new headquarters at 901 Mission Street on the corner of 5th Street in what is now the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood of San Francisco. It was designed by Charles Peter Weeks and William Peyton Day in the Gothic Revival architecture style, but most of the Gothic Revival detailing was removed in 1968 when the building was re-clad with stucco. This building remains the &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s headquarters in 2017, although other concerns are located there as well.

Between World War II and 1971, new editor Scott Newhall took a bold and somewhat provocative approach to news presentation. Newhall&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; included investigative reporting by such journalists as Pierre Salinger, who later played a prominent role in national politics, and Paul Avery, the staffer who pursued the trail of the self-named &quot;Zodiac Killer&quot;, who sent a cryptogram in three sections in letters to the &quot;Chronicle&quot; and two other papers during his murder spree in the late 1960s. It also featured such colorful columnists as Pauline Phillips, who wrote under the name &quot;Dear Abby&quot;, &quot;Count Marco&quot; (Marc Spinelli), Stanton Delaplane, Terence O&#x27;Flaherty, Lucius Beebe, Art Hoppe, Charles McCabe, and Herb Caen.

The newspaper grew in circulation to become the city&#x27;s largest, overtaking the rival &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;. The demise of other San Francisco dailies through the late 1950s and early 1960s left the &quot;Examiner&quot; and the &quot;Chronicle&quot; to battle for circulation and readership superiority.

===Joint operating agreement===

The competition between the &quot;Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Examiner&quot; took a financial toll on both papers until the summer of 1965, when a merger of sorts created a Joint Operating Agreement under which the &quot;Chronicle&quot; became the city&#x27;s sole morning daily while the &quot;Examiner&quot; changed to afternoon publication (which ultimately led to a declining readership).

The newspapers were officially owned by the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, which managed sales and distribution for both newspapers and was charged with ensuring that one newspaper&#x27;s circulation did not grow at the expense of the other. Revenue was split equally, which led to a situation widely understood to benefit the &quot;Examiner&quot;, since the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, which had a circulation four times larger than its rival, subsidized the afternoon newspaper.

The two newspapers produced a joint Sunday edition, with the &quot;Examiner&quot; publishing the news sections and the Sunday magazine, and the &quot;Chronicle&quot; responsible for the tabloid-sized entertainment section and the book review. From 1965 on the two papers shared a single classified-advertising operation. This arrangement stayed in place until the Hearst Corporation took full control of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; in 2000.

===Push into the suburbs===
Beginning in the early 1990s, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; began to face competition beyond the borders of San Francisco. The newspaper had long enjoyed a wide reach as the de facto &quot;newspaper of record&quot; in Northern California, with distribution along the Central Coast, the Central Valley, and even as far as Honolulu, Hawaii. There was little competition in the Bay Area suburbs and other areas that the newspaper served, but as Knight-Ridder consolidated the &quot;Mercury News&quot; in 1975; purchased the &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot; (now &quot;East Bay Times&quot;) in 1995; and as the Denver-based Media News Group made a rapid purchase of the remaining newspapers on the East Bay by 1985, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; realized it had to step up its suburban coverage.

The &quot;Chronicle&quot; launched five zoned sections to appear in the Friday edition of the paper. The sections covered San Francisco and four different suburban areas. They each featured a unique columnist, enterprise pieces, and local news specific to the community. The newspaper added 40 full-time staff positions to work in the suburban bureaus. Despite the push to focus on suburban coverage, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; was hamstrung by the Sunday edition, which, being produced by the San Francisco-centric &quot;un-&quot;Chronicle&quot;&quot; &quot;Examiner&quot;, had none of the focus on the suburban communities that the &quot;Chronicle&quot; was striving to cultivate.

===Sale to Hearst===
The de Young family controlled the paper, via the Chronicle Publishing Company, until July 27, 2000, when it was sold to Hearst Communications, Inc., which owned the &quot;Examiner&quot;. Following the sale, the Hearst Corporation transferred the &quot;Examiner&quot; to the Fang family, publisher of the &quot;San Francisco Independent&quot; and &quot;AsianWeek&quot;, along with a $66-million subsidy. Under the new owners, the &quot;Examiner&quot; became a free tabloid, leaving the &quot;Chronicle&quot; as the only daily broadsheet newspaper in San Francisco.

In 1949, the de Young family founded KRON-TV (Channel 4), the Bay Area&#x27;s third television station. Until the mid-1960s, the station (along with KRON-FM), operated from the basement of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; Building, on Mission Street. KRON moved to studios at 1001 Van Ness Avenue (on the former site of St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, which burned down in 1962). KRON was sold to Young Broadcasting in 2000 and, after years of being San Francisco&#x27;s NBC affiliate, became an independent station on January 1, 2002, when NBC—tired of Chronicle&#x27;s repeated refusal to sell KRON to the network and, later, Young&#x27;s asking price for the station being too high—purchased KNTV in San Jose from Granite Broadcasting Corporation for $230 million.

Since the Hearst Corporation took ownership in 2000 the &quot;Chronicle&quot; has made periodic changes to its organization and design, but on February 1, 2009, as the newspaper began its 145th year of publication, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; Sunday edition introduced a redesigned paper featuring a modified logo, new section, and page organization, new features, bolder, colored section-front banners and new headline and text typography. The frequent bold-faced, all-capital-letter headlines typical of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s front page were eliminated. Editor Ward Bushee&#x27;s note heralded the issue as the start of a &quot;new era&quot; for the &quot;Chronicle&quot;.

On July 6, 2009, the paper unveiled some alterations to the new design that included yet newer section fronts and wider use of color photographs and graphics. In a special section publisher, Frank J. Vega described new, state-of-the-art printing operations enabling the production of what he termed &quot;A Bolder, Brighter &quot;Chronicle&quot;.&quot; The newer look was accompanied by a reduction in the size of the broadsheet. Such moves are similar to those made by other prominent American newspapers such as the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, which in 2008 unveiled radically new designs even as changing reader demographics and general economic conditions necessitated physical reductions of the newspapers.

On November 9, 2009, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; became the first newspaper in the nation to print on high-quality glossy paper. The high-gloss paper is used for some section fronts and inside pages.

==Staff==
The current publisher of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; is Bill Nagel. Audrey Cooper was named editor-in-chief in January 2015 and was the first woman to hold the position. In June 2020 she left to be the editor-in-chief of WNYC, New York City. In August 2020, Hearst named Emilio Garcia-Ruiz the publication&#x27;s editor-in-chief. Ann Killion has written for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Carl Nolte is a journalist and columnist.

==Web==
The newspaper&#x27;s websites are at SFGate.com (free) and SFChronicle.com (premium). Originally &quot;The Gate&quot;, SFGATE was one of the earliest major market newspaper websites to be launched, on November 3, 1994, at the time of The Newspaper Guild strike; the union published its own news website, &quot;San Francisco Free Press&quot;, whose staff joined SFGATE when the strike ended. SFChronicle.com launched in 2013 and since 2019 has been run separately from SFGATE, whose staff are independent of the print newspaper. across all platforms the Chronicle has 34 million unique visitors each month, with SFGATE receiving 135.9 million pageviews and 25.1 million unique visitors per month and SFChronicle.com 31.3 million pageviews and 31.3 million unique visitors per month globally.

==Praise, criticism, and features==

The paper has received the Pulitzer Prize on a number of occasions. Despite an illustrious and long history, the paper&#x27;s news reportage is not as extensive as in the past. The current day &quot;Chronicle&quot; has followed the trend of other American newspapers, devoting increasing attention to local and regional news and cultural and entertainment criticism to the detriment of the paper&#x27;s traditionally strong national and international reporting, though the paper does maintain a Washington, D.C., bureau. This increased focus on local news is a response to the competition from other Bay Area newspapers including the resurrected &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot;, the &quot;East Bay Times&quot; (formerly &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot;) and the &quot;Mercury News&quot;.

Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada received the 2004 George Polk Award for Sports Reporting. Fainaru-Wada and Williams were recognized for their work on uncovering the BALCO scandal, which linked San Francisco Giants star Barry Bonds to performance-enhancing drugs. While the two above-named reporters broke the news, they are by no means the only sports writers of note at the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. The &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s sports section is edited by Christina Kahrl and called &quot;Sporting Green&quot; as it is printed on green-tinted pages. The section&#x27;s best-known writers are its columnists: Bruce Jenkins, Ann Killion, Scott Ostler, and Mike Silver. Its baseball coverage is anchored by Henry Schulman, John Shea, and Susan Slusser, the first female president of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA).

The &quot;Chronicle&#x27;s&quot; Sunday arts and entertainment insert section is called &quot;Datebook&quot;, and has for decades been printed on pink-tinted paper in a tabloid format. Movie reviews (for many years written by nationally known critic Mick LaSalle) feature a unique rating system: instead of stars or a &quot;thumbs up&quot; system, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; has for decades used a small cartoon icon, sitting in a movie theater seat, known as the &quot;Little Man&quot;, explained in 2008 by the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert: &quot;...the only rating system that makes any sense is the Little Man of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, who is seen (1) jumping out of his seat and applauding wildly; (2) sitting up happily and applauding; (3) sitting attentively; (4) asleep in his seat; or (5) gone from his seat.&quot;

Another area of note is the architecture column by John King; the &quot;Chronicle&quot; is still one of the few American papers to present a regular column on architectural issues. The paper also has regular weekly sections devoted to Food &amp; Home and Style.

==Challenges==
Circulation has fallen sharply since the dot-com boom peaked from around 1997 to 2001. The &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s daily readership dropped by 16.6% between 2004 and 2005 to 400,906; The &quot;Chronicle&quot; fired one-quarter of its newsroom staff in a cost-cutting move in May 2007. Newspaper executives pointed to growth of SFGate, the online website with 5.2 million unique visitors per month – fifth among U.S. newspaper websites in 2007.

In February 2009, Hearst chief executive Frank A. Bennack Jr., and Hearst President Steven R. Swartz, announced that the &quot;Chronicle&quot; had lost money every year since 2001 and more than $50 million in 2008. Without major concessions from employees and other cuts, Hearst would put the papers up for sale and, if no buyer was found, shut the paper. San Francisco would have become the first major American city without a daily newspaper. The cuts were made.

Despite – or perhaps because of – the threats, the loss of readers and advertisers accelerated. On October 26, 2009, the Audit Bureau of Circulations reported that the &quot;Chronicle&quot; had suffered a 25.8% drop in circulation for the six-month period ending in September 2009, to 251,782 subscribers, the largest percentage drop in circulation of any major newspaper in the United States. &quot;Chronicle&quot; publisher Frank Vega said the drop was expected as the paper moved to earn more from higher subscription fees from fewer readers. In May 2013, Vega retired and was replaced as publisher by former &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; publisher Jeffrey M. Johnson. SFGate, the main digital portal for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, registered 19 million unique visitors in January 2015, making it the seventh-ranked newspaper website in the United States.

<doc id="319443" wikidata="Q249724" url="?curid=319443" title="William Lawson (explorer)">
<text>William Lawson, (2 June 1774 – 16 June 1850) was a British soldier, explorer, land owner, grazier and politician who migrated to Sydney, New South Wales in 1800. Along with Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth, he pioneered the first successful crossing of the Blue Mountains by British colonists.

==Early life==
Lawson was born in Finchley, Middlesex, England to John Lawson and his second wife Hannah Summers. His father owned a successful chandler business and was a descendant of the Scottish Lawson family of Cairnmuir House in the Pentland Hills of Edinburgh, Scotland.

Lawson was educated in London and trained as a surveyor. He decided to join the British Army and purchased a commission in the New South Wales Corps as an ensign for £300 in 1799. He received orders to transfer to Sydney, arriving there in November 1800.

==Officer in the &#x27;Rum Corps&#x27;==
===Norfolk Island===
Shortly after his arrival in Sydney he was posted to work at the penal colony at Norfolk Island under Major Joseph Foveaux. At this time, a planned insurgency of Irish convicts and soldiers on the island was discovered with Foveaux hanging two alleged ring-leaders without trial and punishing others with 500 lashes. Lawson became trusted by Foveaux and was appointed to adjudicate in the island&#x27;s military court. This court was accused of corrupt practices and in one high profile case which Lawson helped preside over, an appointee to a government position who Foveaux did not like was found guilty of incest.

In addition to his military duties on Norfolk Island, Lawson also acquired land and raised sheep. He also obtained a convict mistress named Sarah Leadbeater, who had been sentenced to 7 years transportation for stealing clothes. He developed a long term relationship with Sarah, eventually marrying her in 1812 and having eleven children with her.

===Involvement in the Rum Rebellion===
In 1806, Lawson returned to Sydney and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the New South Wales Corps. Here he became a close associate with the leading officers including Captain John Macarthur and Lieutenant-Colonel George Johnston. These officers controlled a very profitable monopoly in the colony that centred on the trading on rum, and the New South Wales Corps was called the &#x27;Rum Corps&#x27; as a result of this corrupt racketeering. Lawson became an integral part of this clique.

In January 1808, when Governor Bligh had John Macarthur arrested on charges of sedition against the colonial government, Lawson was one of six officers appointed to help oversee his trial. Colluding with Macarthur, Lawson and the other officers refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the presiding judge, took possession of the court documents and removed Macarthur from the custody of the court. When Bligh ordered Lawson and the other officers to halt their interference in the trial, they refused, resulting in Bligh charging them with treason. Macarthur, Johnston, Lawson and the other officers and soldiers of the &#x27;Rum Corps&#x27; then proceeded to collaborate in a full armed mutiny against Governor Bligh known as the Rum Rebellion. This military coup resulted in the detainment and removal of Bligh from power, and the installation of a military junta headed by Macarthur and Johnston.

For his assistance in the rebellion, Lawson was given the role of Johnston&#x27;s aide-de-camp and received a 500 acre land grant at Prospect.

===Commandant of the Newcastle convict colony===
In 1809, Lawson was appointed by the rebel administration as Commandant of the Newcastle (Coal River) penal settlement at the mouth of the Hunter River. He had previously held the position of acting commandant there during a brief period 1807.

At Newcastle, Lawson was in charge of several high profile political prisoners who had been arrested and transported to the penal settlement for being supporters of Bligh. These included Henry Browne Hayes, a wealthy emancipist who owned the Vaucluse estate east of Sydney, and George Crossley, who was Bligh&#x27;s principal legal advisor. Lawson ensured that these prisoners, which he called &quot;Bligh&#x27;s mob&quot;, were worked as hard as the ordinary convicts digging coal and collecting shell.

When Hayes was transferred to house-arrest at Vaucluse for health reasons, Lawson had him violently re-arrested and ordered the ransacking of his house for not meeting the conditions of his parole. Hayes was sent back to Newcastle and Lawson published a notice threatening 200 lashes to anyone who assisted Hayes.

===Removal from office and sent to England===
With the arrival of Governor Lachlan Macquarie in late 1809, the rebel administration of Macarthur and Johnston was dissolved. Macquarie ordered Lawson to release the political prisoners at Newcastle that supported Bligh, and on 10 January 1810 Lawson was replaced as Commandant by Lieutenant John Purcell.

Upon his release, George Crossley took civil legal action against Lawson and several other &#x27;Rum Corps&#x27; officers for false imprisonment. At a trial in April 1810, Lawson was found guilty of wrongfully imprisoning Crossley and was ordered to contribute to costs and a payment of £500 (reduced to £300 on appeal) to Crossley.

Macquarie then had Lawson sent to England to act as a witness in the court-martial against Johnston for his leading role in the mutiny and treason against Governor Bligh. Lawson remained in England until 1812.

==Expedition crossing the Blue Mountains==
Lawson returned to Sydney in 1812 as a lieutenant in the NSW Veteran&#x27;s Company and was placed in charge of the detachment stationed at Liverpool. He started work on building a mansion at his land grant in Prospect which was eventually completed in 1821 and which he named Veteran Hall after his commanding role in the Veteran&#x27;s Company. Lawson also took interest in becoming a wool-producer and became active in exploring for land to acquire for sheep farming.

Lawson commenced the exploration of the Blue Mountains alongside Blaxland and William Charles Wentworth on 11 May 1813. He kept a journal of the expedition titled, &#x27;W Lawsons Narrative. Across Blue Mountains [sic]&#x27;. In his first entry he writes: 
 Mr. Blaxland Wentworth and myself with four men and four Horses- Laden with Provisions etc- took our Departure on Tuesday the 11th May 1813. Crossed the Nepean River at Mr. Chapman&#x27;s Farm Emu Island at four o&#x27;clock and proceeded SW. Two miles. Encamped at 5 o&#x27;clock at the foot of the first Ridge of Hills-. 
On 31 May 1813, the party reached the most westerly point of their expedition, recorded as Mount Blaxland, and looked out onto what was to become known as the Bathurst Plains. On this day, Lawson writes:

...this Country will I have no doubt be a great acquisition to this Colony and no difficulty in making a good Road to it, and take it in a Political point of View if in case of our Invasion it will be a safe Retreat for the Inhabitance with their Familys and that for this part of the Country is so formed by Nature that a few men would be able to defend the passes against a large body.

==First British pastoralist west of the Blue Mountains==
In February 1814, Governor Macquarie offered land grants of 1,000 acres to each of the three explorers for their work. The grants were to be allocated in the Bathurst Plains region that they had journeyed to. In 1815, Lawson accepted the offer and took 100 head of cattle across the Blue Mountains and established his property on the south side of the Fish River, near to its junction with the Macquarie River. By doing so, Lawson became the first British pastoralist west of the mountains. He named the property &quot;Macquarie&quot;.

==Commandant of the Bathurst region==
By 1819 Lawson was the most prominent stock-owner and land-holder in the newly colonised region westward of the mountains. Only a handful of other colonists had been allowed to take up land in this area around the government outpost of Bathurst. In that same year, Charles Throsby guided by local Aboriginal men had formed an easier trail to Bathurst from Sydney that approached from the south. Governor Macquarie recognised that more settlers would now travel to the region to take up land and a more formal administration would be required at Bathurst. He consequently made Lawson, who was still a lieutenant in the army, commandant for the Bathurst region in September 1819.

With the British increasingly taking land in the area, violence with the local resident Wiradjuri people became apparent. In 1819, four Aboriginal people were shot dead in the vicinity of Lawson&#x27;s property, while one of Lawson&#x27;s horses was speared. As commandant, Lawson was in command of all the troops stationed west of the Blue Mountains, but it appears these soldiers were not utilised at this stage of the conflict.

==Pioneer colonist of the Mudgee region==
Whilst Commandant of Bathurst, Lawson undertook four expeditions in 1821 and 1822 to find good pasture land to the north of this outpost. Following information from James Blackman and being guided by a local Aboriginal man named Ering (Aaron), Lawson became one of the first white men to travel along the Cudgegong and Talbragar Rivers. He met with around 40 Aboriginal people gathered at Mudgee, writing that the area was some of the finest grazing land in the world. He also named the nearby Goulburn River.

Lawson later took up 5,000 acres of land to the northwest of Mudgee and formed another large property on the Talbragar River.

==Bathurst War==
As the British expanded their taking of land, conflict with the local Aboriginal population continued. Near Mudgee in 1822, George Cox led a fight resulting in around six Aborigines being shot. One of Lawson&#x27;s own stockmen was also killed at Dirty Swamp in the same year, but Lawson chose not to mobilise the military. However in 1823, after an Aboriginal raiding group led by a man named &#x27;Jingler&#x27; got hold of muskets and ammunition and successfully stalled British expansion, Lawson decided to order the formation of a patrol composed of armed settlers and four soldiers of the 40th Regiment. He also placed soldiers at the properties of the most regarded colonists.

Lawson still took a conciliatory stance with the Aboriginal population and appears to have had good relations with at least one local clan. However, with the escalation of violence, the authorities decided in late 1823 to replace Lawson as Commandant of Bathurst with a veteran of the Peninsula War in Major James Morisset.

In mid 1824, conflict with the Wiradjuri soared, around a hundred Aboriginal people including women and children had been murdered, while twenty-two whites had been killed. Lawson&#x27;s properties in the region had been attacked, hundreds of his sheep destroyed and another four of his employees were dead. His son, William Lawson Jnr, admitted the situation had become a war and wished that the Wiradjuri could be exterminated. This war has become known as the Bathurst War.

In July 1824, Lawson with 12 other major colonists around Bathurst signed a petition requesting a large military force to be sent out to subjugate the &quot;natives&quot;. In August, Governor Thomas Brisbane obliged the settlers by announcing martial law in the Bathurst region and ordered Commandant Morisset to implement measures to control the situation. In September, Morisset organised a large military punitive expedition containing soldiers of the 40th Regiment and armed settlers, to sweep the area around Bathurst and Mudgee. Lawson provided the horses for the group and commanded one of the four divisions within the expedition. Officially there was no death toll recorded from this military campaign, but witness reports from the time and oral evidence indicate that multiple massacres of Aboriginal people were carried out. The Bathurst War ended later in 1824 with martial law being revoked and Wiradjuri leader Windradyne suing for peace.

==Member of the elite squattocracy==
After the Bathurst War, Lawson retired from the British Army and became focused on acquiring land. Throughout the 1820s and 1830s he obtained further large parcels of land especially along the Coolaburragundy River and at Kurrajong. By the 1840s, he had become one of the largest landholders in the colony, a powerful squatter with 150,000 acres, 84,000 sheep and 15,000 cattle to his name. He became an importer of thoroughbred horses and an important identity in the horse-racing and fox hunting industries.

He completed his mansion, Veteran Hall, at Prospect, but was still very active in the running of his properties out west. Conflict between Lawson&#x27;s employees and Aboriginal people during the process of taking this land was at times reported, with serious violence occurring during the seizure of land along the Barwon River.

His sons, William Junior and Nelson, also became extensive landholders. The Lawson family cemented their association within the elite squattocracy with the marrying of William Junior to Caroline Icely, sister of the wealthy squatter Thomas Icely.

The wealth Lawson obtained from the pastoral industry was built upon the utilisation of cheap convict labour. Convicts were assigned to Lawson as virtual slave labour, those that absconded were sometimes punished with 100 lashes before being returned to his properties. With the end of transportation of convicts to New South Wales in the 1840s, Lawson strongly advocated for the importation of cheap foreign coolie labour. In 1841 he obtained labourers from Chile but was prohibited from bringing &quot;hill coolies&quot; from India. Lawson also chaired meetings in support of the resumption of convict transportation and also employed imported Chinese coolies, who absconded due to poor rations and underpayment.

==Political career==
Lawson had become one of the highest profile colonists and in 1843 he chose to enter politics, and was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council for the County of Cumberland as a representative of the Aristocratic party. He remained a member of parliament until 1848, rarely contributing to discussion but often voting in the interests of protecting the privileged status of the squattocracy.

He died at his estate, Veteran Hall in Prospect on 16 June 1850 and was buried at St Bartholomew&#x27;s cemetery.

==Legacy==
The town of Lawson in the Blue Mountains is named after him.

Following Lawson&#x27;s death, Veteran Hall was eventually acquired by the Metropolitan Water Board and most of the granted property is now submerged by the waters of Prospect reservoir. The house was demolished in 1926.

His son Nelson Lawson succeeded him in his seat in the New South Wales Legislative Council. His daughter Susanna Caroline Lawson married John Rendell Street, founder of the Street dynasty.

In 1963 Lawson was honoured, together with Blaxland and Wentworth, on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post depicting the Blue Mountains crossing.

<doc id="319445" wikidata="Q2304706" url="?curid=319445" title="Spheroidal weathering">
<text>Spheroidal weathering is a form of chemical weathering that affects jointed bedrock and results in the formation of concentric or spherical layers of highly decayed rock within weathered bedrock that is known as &quot;saprolite.&quot; When saprolite is exposed by physical erosion, these concentric layers peel (spall) off as concentric shells much like the layers of a peeled onion. Within saprolite, spheroidal weathering often creates rounded boulders, known as &quot;corestones&quot; or &quot;woolsack&quot;, of relatively unweathered rock. Spheroidal weathering is also called onion skin weathering, concentric weathering, spherical weathering, or woolsack weathering.

== Weathering process ==
Spheroidal weathering is the result of chemical weathering of systematically jointed, massive rocks, including granite, dolerite, basalt and sedimentary rocks such as silicified sandstone. It occurs as the result of the chemical alteration of such rocks along intersecting joints. The chemical alteration of the rock results in the formation of abundant secondary minerals such as kaolinite, sericite, serpentine, montmorillonite, and chlorite and a corresponding increase in the volume of the altered rock. When the joints within bedrock form a 3-dimensional network, they subdivide it into separate blocks, often in the form of rough cubes or rectangular prisms that are bounded by these joints. Because water can penetrate the bedrock along these joints, the near-surface bedrock will be altered by weathering progressively inward along the faces of these blocks. The alteration by weathering of the bedrock will be greatest along the corners of each block, followed by the edges, and finally the faces of the cube. The differences in weathering rates between the corners, edges, and faces of a bedrock block will result in the formation of spheroidal layers of altered rock that surround an unaltered rounded boulder-size core of relatively unaltered rock known as a &quot;corestone&quot; or &quot;woolsack&quot;. Spheroidal weathering has often been incorrectly attributed solely to various types of physical weathering.

Frequently, erosion has removed the layers of altered rock and other saprolite surrounding corestones that were produced by spheroidal weathering. This leaves many corestones as freestanding boulders on the ground&#x27;s surface. Often the spheroidal weathering, which created these corestones and the enclosing saprolite occurred in the prehistoric past during periods of humid, even tropical climates. Frequently, the removal of the saprolite by erosion and exposure of corestones as freestanding residual boulders, tors, or other landforms occurs many thousands of years later and during vastly different climatic conditions.

Depending on local environmental conditions, spheroidal weathering of bedrock blocks defined by tectonically induced joints and fractures may result in the formation of prominent and well-defined Liesegang rings within these blocks. These blocks typically consist of bedrock blocks (&quot;Liesegang blocks&quot;), which are bounded on their periphery by joints and fractures, and, in sedimentary rocks, bedding planes above and below. Each Liesegang block consists of a relatively unaltered core surrounded by concentric, alternating shells of iron-poor (intermediate shells) and iron-rich (&#x27;iron&#x27; shells) composition which make up the Liesegang rings. These iron-poor and iron-rich shells follow the configuration of the outer shape of the block and are sub-parallel to its sides. The iron-rich and iron-poor shells vary in degree of cementation and, as a result, can produce &quot;box work&quot; weathering structures during subsequent erosion. The degree of development of Liesegang rings as the result of weathering depends upon the spacing of the joint systems, groundwater flow, local topography, bedrock composition, and bed thickness.

<doc id="319446" wikidata="Q1664630" url="?curid=319446" title="Hooperman">
<text>Hooperman is an American comedy-drama television series that aired on ABC from September 23, 1987, to July 19, 1989. The show centered on the professional and personal life of San Francisco police Inspector Harry Hooperman, played by John Ritter. The series was created by Steven Bochco and Terry Louise Fisher, who were the team responsible for creating &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. Though not the first comedy drama, &quot;Hooperman&quot; was considered the vanguard of a new television genre when it premiered, and critics coined the term &quot;dramedy&quot; to describe it.

==Synopsis==
Ritter plays San Francisco police Inspector Harry Hooperman. In the first episode, Hooperman inherits the rundown apartment building he lives in when his elderly landlady is killed in a robbery. He also inherits her temperamental pet Jack Russell terrier named Bijoux. Due to the demands of his job as a police officer, he hires Susan Smith (played by Debrah Farentino) to be the building manager, and the pair become romantically involved throughout the first season.

Also starring on the show was Alix Elias as the cheerful and bubbly police dispatcher, Betty Bushkin; Barbara Bosson was Hooperman&#x27;s divorced superior, Capt. Celeste &quot;C.Z.&quot; Stern; Felton Perry as Harry&#x27;s partner, Inspector Clarence McNeil; Clarence Felder as redneck inspector Boris &quot;Bobo&quot; Pritzger; Joseph Gian as Rick Silardi, a gay cop, and Sydney Walsh as officer Maureen &quot;Mo&quot; DeMott, his patrol partner who was intent on &quot;saving&quot; him from being gay by making unwanted passes. Dan Lauria played Celeste&#x27;s former husband, Lou Stern.

The theme music was composed by Mike Post.

Guest stars in the series&#x27; 42-episode run included: Don Cheadle, Kim Delaney, Dennis Dugan, Norman Fell (who worked with Ritter on &quot;The Stone Killer&quot; and &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;), Miguel Ferrer, Jack Gilford, Mark Hamill, Joanna Kerns (who did a guest spot on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;), Richard Kind, Dan Lauria, Jane Leeves, Lorna Luft, David Paymer, Barbara Rush, and Shannon Tweed.

Except for a brief syndicated run on the FX Network in the mid 1990s, and the pilot rebroadcast on TV Land in 2003 following Ritter&#x27;s death, the series has not been repeated.

<text>The Sud Aviation SE 210 Caravelle is a French jet airliner produced by Sud Aviation.

It was developed by SNCASE in the early 1950s, and made its maiden flight on May 27, 1955. It included some de Havilland designs and components developed for the de Havilland Comet, the first jet airliner. SNCASE merged into the larger Sud Aviation conglomerate before the aircraft entered revenue service on April 26, 1959, with Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS); 282 were built until production ended in 1972. It was ordered by airlines on every continent and operated until its retirement in 2005.
The short-range, five-abreast airliner is powered by two aft-mounted Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines, allowing a clean low wing.
The configuration was later retained in many narrow-body aircraft and regional jets.

The initial I, III and VI variants could seat 90 to 99 passengers over .
The later, slightly longer 10/11 variants could seat 99 to 118 passengers over and were powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D low-bypass turbofans.
The stretched Caravelle 12 could seat 131 over .

==Development==
===Origins===
On 12 October 1951, the &quot;Comité du matériel civil&quot; (civil aircraft committee) published a specification for a medium-range aircraft, which was later sent to the aviation industry by the &quot;Direction technique et industrielle&quot;. This called for an aircraft capable of carrying 55 to 65 passengers and of cargo on routes up to with a cruising speed of about . The type and number of engines were not specified. Since 1946, various design studies for aircraft in this category had already been underway at several of the leading French aircraft manufacturing organisations, and had resulted in some ambitious concepts being mooted. None of these firms possessed the financial power to independently embark on the substantial development work involved, let alone to establish a manufacturing line for the construction of such aircraft.

The response to the specification from the French industry was strong, it has been claimed that every major manufacturer submitted at least one proposal; a total of 20 different designs were ultimately received. The majority of these proposals were powered by all-turbojet engine arrangements, although Breguet had entered a number of designs that were powered by both turbojet and turboprop engines; among these was one for a Snecma Atar-powered tri-jet to be developed in association with the SNCA du Nord and a turboprop type; all of the different designs were designated as &quot;Br. 978&quot;. Hurel-Dubois had entered several turboprop designs based on a narrow fuselage and shoulder-mounted wing, similar to many regional propliners. Proposals from SNCASO included the S.O.60 with two Rolls-Royce Avon RA.7 engines, outfitted with two smaller Turbomeca Marborés as auxiliaries. SNCASE had also returned a number of designs from the X-200 to X-210, all of these being purely jet-powered.

On 28 March 1952, after studying the various entries, the &quot;Comité du Matériel Civil&quot; announced that it had produced a short list of three entrants: the four-engined Avon/Marbore SNCASO S.0.60, the twin-Avon Hurel-Dubois project, and the three-engined Avon SNCASE X-210. At this point, British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce had already begun to offer a new version of the Avon that was to be capable of developing 9,000 lbf (40 kN) of thrust, which would render the auxiliary engines of the S.O.60 and the third engine featured on the X-210 unnecessary. The Committee issued a request for SNCASE to re-submit its X-210 proposal as a twin-Avon design. In doing so, SNCASE decided to not remove the remaining engines from their rear-mounted position; most designs had placed the engines underneath the wing, where they could be mounted on the spar for lower overall weight, but it was felt that these weight savings were not worth the effort. This turned out to be a benefit to the design, as the cabin noise was greatly reduced as a result. In July 1952, the revised X-210 design with twin Avons was re-submitted to the Secretariat General for Civil and Commercial Aviation (SGACC).

===Selection===

Two months later, SNCASE received official notification that its design had been accepted. On 6 July 1953, the SGACC placed a formal order for the construction of a pair of prototypes along with a pair of static airframes for fatigue testing. SNCASE&#x27;s design licensed several fuselage features from British aircraft company de Havilland, the two companies already having had dealings in respect to several earlier designs. The nose area and cockpit layout were taken directly from the de Havilland Comet jet airliner, while the rest of the airliner was locally designed. A distinctive design feature was the cabin windows in the shape of a curved triangle, which were smaller than conventional windows but gave the same field of view downwards.

On 21 April 1955, the first prototype of the Caravelle (F-WHHH), launched by Madame de Gaulle, was rolled out. On 27 May 1955, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight, powered by a pair of British Rolls-Royce RA-26 Avon Mk.522, capable of providing of unitary thrust. For the maiden flight, which had a total duration of 41 minutes, the crew consisted of Pierre Nadot (Captain), André Moynot (First Officer), Jean Avril (mechanic), André Préneron (radio operator) and Roger Beteille.

Almost one year later, on 6 May 1956, the second prototype made its first flight. The first prototype had been fitted with a cargo door located on the lower left side of the fuselage, but this door was removed in the second prototype in favour of an all-seating arrangement. By October 1956, both prototypes had accumulated in excess of 1,000 flight hours. By the end of 1956, the two aircraft had visited various locations across Europe and North Africa; and trials were already underway for French carrier Air France. During 1957, the second prototype accumulated roughly 2,500 flight hours across various flights conducted throughout North America and South America.

In 1956, the type received its first order from Air France; it was followed by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) in 1957. More orders followed, which had been partially driven by a campaign of direct presentations held at airshows and dedicated flight demonstrations using the two prototypes to potential customers. Also during 1956, SNCASE (Sud-Est – Southeast) had merged with SNCASO (Sud-Ouest – Southwest) and several other French aircraft manufacturers to become Sud Aviation; however, the original SE designation assigned to the airliner was retained. In May 1959, the Caravelle received its airworthiness certification, enabling the type to enter passenger service. On 26 April 1959, the Caravelle performed its first flight with paying passengers on board for Scandinavian operator SAS; shortly thereafter, the type commenced operations with Air France as well.

===Further development===

Within four years of entering airliner service, a total of 172 Caravelles had been sold to a range of operators. Aviation writer M.G. Douglas attributed the type&#x27;s favourable early sales record to the effective marketing campaign of performing demonstrations to prospective customers using the two prototypes, as well to the Caravelle having effectively no jet-powered rivals, being the only short-haul jetliner for several years following its introduction. Several models of the Caravelle were developed and produced over the lifetime of the production run, often in response to the increasing power of the available engines, which allowed higher takeoff weights to be adopted.

By 1963, there were a total of six different versions of the Caravelle in production, designated &quot;III&quot;, &quot;VI-N&quot;, &quot;VI-R&quot;, &quot;10A&quot;, &quot;10B&quot;, and &quot;X-BIR&quot;. Of these, the Caravelle III was considered to be the basic version of the airliner, while the other variants featured an increasing number of improvements. The Caravelle VI-N was equipped with more powerful Avon 531 engines and an additional heat exchanger for the air conditioning, while the Caravelle VI-R, which had come about as a result of demands by U.S. carrier United Airlines, was furnished with thrust reverser-equipped Avon 352s, a revised windscreen design, soundproofing, a new luggage compartment door, and wing spoilers.

The Caravelle 10A and 10B, which differed only in the engines used and were commonly referred to as the &quot;Super Caravelle&quot;, featured the improvements of the VI-R in addition to a high degree of further design changes. The more high-profile modifications included a stretch of the fuselage by ; a highly altered wing; an aerodynamic fairing behind the fin of the tailplane; expanded cargo capacity via raised floor support struts; and higher cabin windows. Other changes included the adoption of variable-displacement pumps for the hydraulic system and the use of AC-based generators in place of earlier DC counterparts along with an auxiliary power unit (APU). The redesigned wing was equipped with double-slotted Fowler flaps, additional and repositioned stall vanes, aerodynamic improvements to the wing root and adjustments to the leading edge that improved the performance of the wing during the crucial takeoff and landing phases of flight.
Despite its commercial success, however, the Caravelle was soon displaced from being the focus of Sud Aviation&#x27;s development efforts as the majority of the company&#x27;s design engineers were progressively reallocated onto an entirely new project that was intended to produce a successor to the Caravelle. The project was relatively ambitious, having the aim of producing a viable supersonic transport that possessed the same general size and range as the Caravelle. It was decided that the envisioned supersonic airliner should be naturally named after the firm&#x27;s recent success, thus the Super-Caravelle name was applied to the design. Ultimately, the work on the Super-Caravelle would be merged with similar work that had been undertaken by Britain&#x27;s Bristol Aeroplane Company, and would result in the development of Concorde.

In total, 282 Caravelles of all types were manufactured (2 prototypes or pre-production aircraft and 280 production aircraft); reportedly, Sud Aviation&#x27;s projected break-even point for the type had been forecast to be around the 200-unit mark.

==Design==
The Caravelle belongs to the first generation of passenger aircraft to use newly developed jet propulsion technology, and it was the first jet airliner developed specifically for the short/medium-range sector of the market. Early in the Caravelle&#x27;s career, its chief competitors were propeller-driven aircraft, such as the British-built Vickers Viscount and the U.S.-built Convair CV-440. Reportedly, the Caravelle proved to be a highly reliable airliner during its early years of service. The low accident rate for the type led to lower than average insurance premiums for Caravelle operators.

The Caravelle was typically powered by a pair of British-built Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines, installed in a rear-mounted position close to the tail unit. Various models of the Avon engine were adopted for different versions of the airliner, often with increased thrust and additional features such as thrust reversers. Alternative powerplants were adopted or proposed for some Caravelle models, such as the U.S.-built Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-1 and General Electric CJ-805-23C engines.

The Caravelle was designed to maximise passenger comfort and operator convenience. The rear entry door had built-in stairs that, while adding structural complexity, meant that mobile airport stairs were unnecessary. On later variants, soundproofing in the form of readily removable mattress-like rolls that fixed in place via existing brackets was added to the design. In some configurations, the Caravelle&#x27;s cabin was furnished with a number of rearward-facing passenger seats, which was an uncommon arrangement amongst civil aircraft. From September 1963 onwards, an autolanding capability (via two separate systems, of which one was self-contained while the other was integrated with the airliner&#x27;s autopilot), was made available for the Caravelle by Sud Aviation.
The final assembly line for the Caravelle was at Sud Aviation&#x27;s factory at Blagnac Airport near Toulouse. Much of the aircraft was manufactured at other sites across France and in other countries, however. The production of large portions of the Caravelle had been subcontracted to other manufacturers; these included the Italian aircraft manufacturer Fiat Aviazione, which produced the aircraft&#x27;s tailplane, fin, ailerons, and engine nacelles; and French aviation firm Breguet Aviation, which performed the outfitting of the rear fuselage; while much of the ancillary equipment of the Caravelle originated from either British or U.S. manufacturers. Sud Aviation constructed and outfitted the nose section, along with manufacturing the tailcone, rudder, Fowler flaps, both the leading edges and trailing edges of the wing, and the majority of the fuselage.

==Variants==


;Caravelle I
: Similar to the original prototypes; first flew on 14 May 1958. This variant was powered by two Rolls-Royce RA-29 Avon Mk.522 with of unitary thrust and a capacity of 80 passengers. French certification was obtained on 2 April 1959, and U.S. certification was obtained six days later. The first revenue flight took place that year with Air France on the Paris-Rome-Athens–Istanbul route. Air France Caravelle registration F-BHRB &quot;Lorraine&quot; was introduced in the Paris-London route on 27 July 1959.
: Sales: 20 were sold; to Air France (10), SAS (6), Air Algérie (2) and VARIG (2). One of the VARIG aircraft was leased by Sud to Air Vietnam and Middle East Airlines before delivery to Royal Air Maroc. In Australia, Trans Australia Airlines had planned to re-equip with the Caravelle but as Ansett felt this was too advanced at that stage for its own needs, under Australia&#x27;s Two Airlines Policy both airlines were required to purchase the Ansett preference (the less-advanced turbo-prop Lockheed L-188 Electra).

;Caravelle IA
: This variant had the same external configuration as variant I but with more powerful engines, the Rolls-Royce Avon RA-29/1 Mk.526 giving improved capabilities. The first flight took place on 11 February 1960. Caravelle I and IA aircraft were later converted to the III variant.
: Sales: 12 built. Deliveries were to Air France, SAS, Air Algérie, Finnair, and Royal Air Maroc.
;Caravelle III
: Later improvements to the Avon led to the Caravelle III. It first flew on 30 December 1959, entering service with Alitalia in April 1960. The Caravelle III was powered by Rolls-Royce Avon RA-29/3 Mk.527 and RA-29/3 Mk.527B engines, both with of unitary thrust.
: Sales: The Series III was the best-selling Caravelle with 78 built. All but one of the 32 Series Is built were upgraded to Series III standard. Air Inter used 16 of this type for its domestic routes. Major deliveries were to Air France, as well as aircraft for Swissair, Alitalia, SAS, and Royal Air Maroc.

;Caravelle VI-N
: N standing for &quot;normal&quot;. A version with more powerful Avon RA-29/6 Mk 531 and RA 29/6 Mk 531B engines producing of unitary thrust. The capabilities were improved and the weights increased; the actual payload was reduced. The Caravelle VI-N first flew on 10 September 1960, beginning service with Belgian airline Sabena in January 1961. Five of the 78 Series IIIs were upgraded to Series VI-N.
:Sales: 53 built. Deliveries to Saeta, Corse Air, Europe A.S., Minerve, Indian Airlines and Yugoslav Airlines.

;Caravelle VI-R
: First Caravelle with thrust reversers. The cockpit windows were made larger with redesigned layout and more powerful brakes were introduced. It first flew on 6 February 1961, obtaining U.S. certification on 5 June that same year. It began service with United Airlines on 14 July. The VI-R was powered by Avon Ra-29 Mk. 533R and Mk 535R (R, for Reverse) engines with a unitary thrust of .
:Sales: 56 built, 20 for United Airlines. Other series VI customers included Indian Airlines (9), Panair do Brasil (4), Cruzeiro do Sul, Iberia Líneas Aéreas De España (4), LAN Chile (3), Aerolíneas Argentinas (3) and TAP Portugal (3). This model was also used by Filipinas Orient Airways , Aerocesar, Airborne Express and SA Nacionales.

;Caravelle VII : This was a Series III (c/n 042) that was purchased by General Electric, ferried to the United States as &quot;Santa Marian 9&quot; and equipped with General Electric CJ805 aft-fan engines, becoming, in effect, the engine test-bed for the Caravelle 10A. Flight tests with the new engines began on 29 December 1960 and a second aircraft was planned to be converted, but this aircraft became the sole Caravelle 10A.

;Caravelle 10A
: Based on the Series VII, but intended for the U.S. market, the 10A was longer than the Series VI, with the windows located higher on the fuselage. The sole prototype was powered by two General Electric CJ-805-23C aft-fan engines and flew for the first time on 31 August 1962. A modified wing with improved flaps was fitted to meet U.S. certification requirements, as was an auxiliary power unit (APU) in the rear fuselage. Trans World Airlines (TWA) cancelled its order for 20 aircraft due to financial problems, however, and by the time TWA was in a position to purchase new aircraft, the Douglas DC-9 was preferred. After testing the prototype was scrapped.
;Caravelle 10B (Super Caravelle)
: Based on the Series 10A, this variant offered many modifications in respect to other series. It introduced a leading edge extension (a fillet added to the front of an aircraft wings in order to provide usable airflow at high angles of attack). The wing had split flaps instead of the earlier models&#x27; double-slotted Fowler flaps and the fuselage was extended , with an increase in passenger capacity to 105. The engines used were the new Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D turbofan engines with of unitary thrust. The 10B first flew on August 31, 1964 and was produced as a run of 22 aircraft.
: Launch customer and primary operator of the 10B was Finnair with 8 examples. Aviaco ordered 5 but this was cancelled, with those aircraft going to Sterling Airways, LTU, and Iberia Airlines. Alia and Union des Transports Aériens (UTA) also acquired aircraft. The last operational Caravelle was a Type 3 10B that flew with Waltair until 2005.

;Caravelle 10R
: A combination of the 10B&#x27;s engines on the Series VI-R fuselage, creating a smaller but higher powered aircraft. Maximum weight at take-off was increased to ( more than the Series I and more than the Series VI-R). It first flew on 8 January 1965 and received U.S. certification on 23 May of that same year.
: A total of 20 were built, starting service with Alia on July 31, 1965. It also flew with Aero Lloyd, CTA, Hispania and SAT, among others.

;Caravelle 11R
: The 11R had a fuselage length of ( more than other variants) and incorporated a cargo door in the port side. This enabled it to carry a mixed load of passengers and cargo. First flight of the series 11R was on 21 April 1967.
: Only six were built, delivered to Air Afrique, Air Congo, and Transeuropa of Spain.
;Caravelle 12 (Super Caravelle)
: This was the last version of the Caravelle to appear, first flying on 12 March 1971. The Series 12 was a 10B with a noticeably longer fuselage, stretched by , and a newer uprated version of the JT8D engines with of unitary thrust. This allowed for up to 140 passengers over a reduced range. The Caravelle 12 was aimed primarily at the charter market, produced to 12 examples starting in 1972. By this point Concorde was in production; this design was originally known in France as Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle. The Caravelle 12 was often also referred to by this name.
: The launch customer for the Series 12 was Sterling Airways with seven delivered, while the remaining five went to Air Inter. Series 12s flew in Europe until October 1996, and in Africa until more recently.
: The unit cost was US$5.5M. (1972)

==Operators==

The Caravelle served with airlines on every continent except Australia. In 1957, Trans-Australia Airlines (TAA) sought to order two Caravelles, to service its longest routes, Perth-Sydney and Perth-Melbourne, from 1960. However, the Australian government blocked the order, saying that any further diversity in full-size airliners used on domestic routes would have an adverse impact on aircraft servicing within Australia.

==Incidents and accidents==
For 45 years of commercial operation, 67 Caravelles have been withdrawn from service as a result of destruction or for irreparable damage. None of these accidents and incidents are attributed to a design defect, only a few technical failures, human errors, or sabotage. The total loss of life in accidents in the Caravelle is more than 1,300. The accident rate per million flights is estimated at more than 5.5, compared with less than 1 for the most recent airliners.

*19 January 1960 – Scandinavian Airlines System Flight 871, a Caravelle I, crashed at Esenboga Airport, Turkey due to excessive descent for reasons unknown. Seven crew members and 35 passengers lost their lives.
*19 May 1960 — A Caravelle of Air Algérie, F-OBNI, collided with a Stampe single-engine biplane on approach to Paris-Orly and managed to land. The small aircraft was destroyed and its pilot was killed, as well as one passenger of the Caravelle, 18 other persons on board were injured.

*19 June 1980 - An Airborne Express Caravelle VI-R registered as N905MW crashed at Atlanta Hartsfield Airport on approach to runway 26. The probable cause was listed as a poorly planned approach, vortex turbulence, and failure to follow approved procedures, directives, etc.
*21 December 1980 – A Transportes Aereos del César (Aerocésar) Caravelle VIR (registration HK-1810) crashed near Riohacha, Colombia due to an explosion and in-flight fire, killing all 70 on board. The cause of the explosion was unknown. (1980 Riohacha Transportes Aéreos del Cesar Caravelle crash)
*29 April 1983, SAN Ecuador Flight 832, a Caravelle VI-R (reg. HC-BAJ, sn. 125) crashed near the southern end of the runway of the Simón Bolívar International Airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador after attempting to execute an emergency landing. The plane had suffered an engine failure shortly after taking off from Guayaquil on a flight to Quito, and the crew was returning to the airport. However, the second engine failed while overflying the city and the plane stalled just as it approached the airport. Cap. Germán Cruz crash-landed the plane in a muddy puddle, produced by recent El Niño, rains near the end of the runway, with the fuselage breaking in three parts but without causing a fire. The accident killed 8 of the 100 people on board and injured several others, but the fact that the puddle acted as a form of cushion to the plane helped avoid more fatalities. The pilot had previously reported engine issues and had tested the plane the previous day, after which it was subjected to maintenance and was later reported as fit to fly shortly before the ill-fated flight.
*2 July 1983 - An Altair Caravelle III registered as F-BHRS experienced an uncontained engine failure while accelerating for takeoff at Milan Malpensa Airport, Italy. Takeoff was quickly aborted and all 89 occupants survived but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. The derelict aircraft remained at Milan Malpensa Airport for years afterward.
*18 January 1986 – An Aerovias Caravelle temporarily leased from Ecuador&#x27;s SAETA crashed in the jungle after missing its first approach, killing all 93 occupants. The flight had originated in Guatemala City and was to land at Mundo Maya International Airport in the northern department of Petén.

<text>The Olduvai Gorge or Oldupai Gorge in Tanzania is one of the most important paleoanthropological localities in the world; the many sites exposed by the gorge have proven invaluable in furthering understanding of early human evolution. A steep-sided ravine in the Great Rift Valley that stretches across East Africa, it is about 48 km long, and is located in the eastern Serengeti Plains within the Ngorongoro Conservation Area in the Olbalbal ward located in Ngorongoro District of Arusha Region, about from Laetoli, another important archaeological locality of early human occupation. The British/Kenyan paleoanthropologist-archeologist team of Mary and Louis Leakey established excavation and research programs at Olduvai Gorge that achieved great advances in human knowledge. The site is registered as one of the National Historic Sites of Tanzania.

The gorge takes its name from the Maasai word &quot;oldupai&quot; which means &quot;the place of the wild sisal&quot; as the East African wild sisal (&quot;Sansevieria ehrenbergii&quot;) grows abundantly throughout the gorge area. Twenty-five kilometers downstream of Lake Ndutu and Lake Masek, the gorge is the result of up to 90 meters erosion cutting into the sediments of a Pleistocene lake bed. A side gorge, originating from Lemagrut Mountain, joins the main gorge 8 km from the mouth. This side gorge follows the shoreline of a prehistoric lake, rich in fossils and early hominin sites. Periodic flows of volcanic ash from Olmoti and Kerimasi helped to ensure preservation of the fossils in the gorge.

The locality is significant in showing the increasing developmental and social complexities in the earliest Hominina, largely revealed in the production and use of stone tools. Prior to tools, evidence of scavenging and hunting can be noted—highlighted by the presence of gnaw marks that predate cut marks—and of the ratio of meat versus plant material in the early hominin diet. The collecting of tools and animal remains in a centralised area is evidence of developing social interaction and communal activity. All these factors indicate an increase in cognitive capacities at the beginning of the period of hominids transitioning to homininina—that is, to human clade.

&quot;Homo habilis&quot;, probably the first early human species, occupied Olduvai Gorge approximately 1.9 million years ago (mya); then came a contemporary australopithecine, &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot;, 1.8 mya, followed by &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, 1.2 mya. &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, which is estimated to have emerged roughly 300,000 years ago, is thought to have occupied sites in the gorge 17,000 years ago.

== History ==
=== Discovery and research ===
While travelling in German East Africa in 1911 to investigate sleeping sickness, German physician and archaeologist Wilhelm Kattwinkel visited Olduvai Gorge, where he observed many fossil bones of an extinct three-toed horse. Inspired by Kattwinkel&#x27;s discovery, German geologist Hans Reck led a team to Olduvai in 1913. There, he found hominin remains which were later radiocarbon dated to 17,000 BP. Four more expeditions were planned, but World War I prevented their start. After the war, as Tanganyika came under British control, Louis Leakey visited Reck in Berlin and viewed the Olduvai fossils. Louis Leakey became convinced that Olduvai Gorge held stone tools, thinking the deposits were of similar age to the Kariandusi prehistoric site in Kenya. Reck and the paleontologist Donald McInnes accompanied Louis Leakey in his 1931 expedition, where Louis found a number of hand axes close to camp soon after their arrival. Mary Leakey first visited the area in 1935, joining Louis and Percy Edward Kent. Subsequent visits were made by the Leakeys in 1941, 1953, 1955 and 1957.

Louis and Mary Leakey are responsible for most of the excavations and discoveries of the hominin fossils in Olduvai Gorge. In July 1959, at the FLK site (the initials of the person who discovered it Frida Leakey, and K for &quot;korongo&quot;, the Swahili language word for gully), Mary Leakey found the skull of &quot;Zinjanthropus&quot; or &quot;Australopithecus boisei&quot;. In addition to an abundance of faunal remains the Leakeys found stone tools Mary classified as Oldowan. In May 1960, at the FLK North-North site, the Leakeys&#x27; son Jonathan found the mandible that proved to be the type specimen for &quot;Homo habilis&quot;.

==Archaeology and geology==
=== Hans Reck and Richard Hay ===
While Hans Reck was the first geologist to attempt to understand the geology of the gorge, current understanding of the geology of the stratigraphic sequence of Olduvai Gorge was made possible in large part by the efforts of geologist Richard Hay. Hay spent twelve years studying the geology at Olduvai, much of it working along with Mary Leakey, finally formulating a detailed picture of the geologic history of the area. Hay&#x27;s seminal work &quot;The Geology of the Olduvai Gorge&quot; was published in 1976.

Reck identified five main layers of deposition in the gorge, which were labelled Beds I through V, with Bed I being the oldest and lowest in the sequence. Hay and other geologists working at the gorge since Reck&#x27;s time have utilized Reck&#x27;s original Bed outline, adding clarity, detail, and corrections to achieve a more thorough understanding of gorge history. Reck&#x27;s original Bed IV interval was later distinguished as consisting of Bed IV and the Masek Beds, while Bed V has been reclassified as the Ndutu Bed and the Naisiuiu Bed.

=== Gorge Stratigraphy ===
The stratigraphic sequence in the gorge is up to 90 m thick, with a welded tuff, the Naabi ignimbrite, forming the base. This is overlain by a series of lava flows from Olmoti and from another source to the south. The oldest fossils are found on this surface, dated at 1.89 mya, while stone tools have been dated at 1.7 mya through the first use of K-Ar dating by Garniss Curtis. In addition, fission track dating and paleomagnetism were used to date the deposits, while amino acid dating and Carbon-14 dating were used to date the bones. Hominid fossils and stone tools are found continuously throughout the entire exposed sequence in the gorge. Faulting between 100 and 30 kya, formed the Olbalbal Depression northwest of Ngorongoro.

==== Bed I ====
The 20–46 m thick Lower Pleistocene Bed I sediments overlying the Naabi ignimbrite consist of layers of Olmoti tuff and lake sediment claystone. Four well-preserved living sites of note are located within Bed I, the FLK and FLK North-North sites mentioned above, plus DK and FLK North. The DK site (Donald McInnes&#x27; first initial plus k for &quot;korongo&quot;) has what Leakey considers to be a stone circle, and also many tools and fossil bones ranging in age from 1.75 mya to 1.9 mya.

==== Bed II ====
Bed II consists of 21–35 m of clay and sandstone Olduvai Lake and stream deposits. Manuports are abundant at the MNK (Mark Nicol Korongo) site in addition to a chert nodule quarry containing over 14,000 pieces, including gneiss and lava anvils and hammerstones. Hand axes were found at the EF-HR (Evelyn Fuchs-Hans Reck) and TK (Thiongo Korongo) sites. The BK (Bell&#x27;s Korongo) site contained an &quot;Australopithecus boisei&quot; deciduous molar and canine.

==== Bed III ====
The distinctly red Bed III consists of 6–10 m of clays, sandstones and conglomerates signifying variable lake depths. Few fossils are present and only isolated stone tools, indicating a sparse early man presence.

==== Bed IV ====
Bed IV is a distinctly different unit from Bed II in the eastern portion of the gorge. There, it is 5–8 m thick and composed of clays, and stream deposited sandstones and conglomerates. Four distinct tool-bearing levels are evident, including 500 handaxes and cleavers at the HK (Hopwood&#x27;s Korongo) site, while phonolite handaxes and an elephant bone handaxe were found at the HEB (Heberer&#x27;s Gully) site. The WK (Wayland&#x27;s Korongo) site contained a &quot;Homo erectus&quot; pelvis and femur.

==== Masek beds ====
The Masek Beds are composed of two episodes of aeolian ash from Kerimasi. A number of quartzite handaxes were found in this layer at the FLK site. Dunes formed after the deposition of Oldonyo Lengai tuffs make up the upper portion of the Ndutu Beds, but yield few fossils. Oldonyo Lengai tuffs also make up the Naisiusiu Beds.

==== Associated fossil species ====
The few &quot;Australopithecus boisei&quot; remains, which include the skull, a thigh bone fragment, and several teeth, were found distributed throughout Beds I and II, which dates them in the range 1.1 to 2 mya. The more common remains of &quot;Homo habilis&quot; were found in Bed I and the lower portion of Bed II, which makes them contemporaries of &quot;Australopithecus boisei&quot;. &quot;Homo erectus&quot; remains were found in the upper portions of Bed II, making them contemporaries of &quot;Australopithecus boisei&quot;, but not of &quot;Homo habilis&quot;.

==The stone tools and their makers==

Louis Leakey first described the Oldowan stone tool industry in 1951. The Leakeys determined that choppers were the most common stone tool found at the gorge, amounting to over half of the total number, and identified 11 Oldowan sites in the gorge, 9 in Bed I, and 2 in Bed II. They also identified the Developed Oldowan as the subsequent diverse tool-kit found in Beds II, III, and IV, with small tools made mostly from chert rather than quartzite. These tools are mostly spheroids and sub-spheroids, followed by choppers.

Besides the chert quarry in Bed II, the Leakeys were able to identify the other source locations of the principal rocks used to make the stone tools. The most common material was quartzite, which originated from the Naibor Soit Inselberg just north of the gorges. The phonolite originated from the Engelosen volcano 5 km to the north. The gneiss came from the Kelogi inselborg 9 km to the southwest.

The first species found by the Leakeys, &quot;Zinjanthropus boisei&quot; or &quot;Australopithecus boisei&quot; (renamed and still debated as &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot;), featured a sagittal crest and large molars. These attributes suggested the species engaged in heavy chewing, indicating a diet of tough plant material, including tubers, nuts, and seeds—and possibly large quantities of grasses and sedges.

Conversely, the Leakeys&#x27; 1960s finds presented different characteristics. The skull lacked a sagittal crest and the braincase was much more rounded, suggesting it was not australopithecine. The larger braincase suggested a larger brain capacity than that of &quot;Australopithecus boisei&quot;. These important differences indicated a different species, which eventually was named &quot;Homo habilis&quot;. Its larger brain capacity and decreased teeth size pointed to &quot;Homo&quot; as the probable toolmaker.

The oldest tools at Olduvai, found at the lowest layer and classified as Oldowan, consist of pebbles chipped on one edge. Above this layer, and later in time, are the true hand-axe industries, the Chellean and the Acheulean. Higher still (and later still) are located Levallois artifacts, and finally the Stillbay implements. Oldowan tools in general are called &quot;pebble tools&quot; because the blanks chosen by the stone knapper already resembled, in pebble form, the final product. Mary Leakey classified the Oldowan tools according to usage; she developed Oldowan A, B, and C categories, linking them to Modes 1, 2, and 3 assemblages classified according to mode of manufacture. Her work remains a foundation for assessing local, regional, and continental changes in stone tool-making during the early Pleistocene, and aids in assessing which hominins were responsible for the several changes in stone tool technology over time.

It is not known for sure which hominin species was first to create Oldowan tools. The emergence of tool culture has also been associated with the pre-&quot;Homo&quot; species &quot;Australopithecus garhi&quot;, and its flourishing is associated with the early species &quot;Homo habilis&quot; and &quot;Homo ergaster&quot;. Beginning 1.7 million years ago, early &quot;Homo erectus&quot; apparently inherited Oldowan technology and refined it into the Acheulean industry.

Oldowan tools occur in Beds I–IV at Olduvai Gorge. Bed I, dated 1.85 to 1.7 mya, contains Oldowan tools and fossils of &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot; and &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, as does Bed II, 1.7 to 1.2 mya. &quot;H. habilis&quot; gave way to &quot;Homo erectus&quot; at about 1.6 mya, but &quot;P. boisei&quot; persisted. Oldowan tools continue to Bed IV at 800,000 to 600,000 before present (BP). A significant change took place between Beds I and II at about 1.5 mya. Flake size increased, bifacial edges (as opposed to single-face edges) occurred more frequently and their length increased, and signs of battering on other artifacts increased. Some likely implications of these factors, among others, are that after this pivotal time hominins used tools more frequently, became better at making tools, and transported tools more often.

==Hunters or scavengers?==

Though substantial evidence of hunting and scavenging has been discovered at Olduvai Gorge, it is believed by archaeologists that hominins inhabiting the area between 1.9 and 1.7 million years ago spent the majority of their time gathering wild plant foods, such as berries, tubers and roots. The earliest hominins most likely did not rely on meat for the bulk of their nutrition. Speculation about the amount of meat in their diets is inferred from comparative studies with a close relative of early hominins: the modern chimpanzee. The chimpanzee&#x27;s diet in the wild consists of only about five percent as meat. And the diets of modern hunter-gatherers do not include a large amount of meat. That is, most of the calories in both groups&#x27; diets came from plant sources. Thus, it can be assumed that early hominins had similar diet proportions, (see the middle-range theory or bridging arguments—bridging arguments are used by archaeologists to explain past behaviors, and they include an underlying assumption of uniformitarianism.)

Much of the information about early hominins comes from tools and debris piles of lithic flakes from such sites as FLK-Zinjanthropus in Olduvai Gorge. Early hominins selected specific types of rocks that would break in a predictable manner when &quot;worked&quot;, and carried these rocks from deposits several kilometres away. Archaeologists such as Fiona Marshall fitted rock fragments back together like a puzzle. She states in her article &quot;Life in Olduvai Gorge&quot; that early hominins, &quot;knew the right angle to hit the cobble, or core, in order to successfully produce sharp-edged flakes ...&quot;. She noted that selected flakes then were used to cut meat from animal carcasses, and shaped cobbles (called choppers) were used to extract marrow and to chop tough plant material.

Bone fragments of birds, fish, amphibians, and large mammals were found at the FLK-Zinj site, many of which were scarred with marks. These likely were made by hominins breaking open the bones for marrow, using tools to strip the meat, or by carnivores having gnawed the bones. Since several kinds of marks are present together, some archaeologists including Lewis Binford think that hominins scavenged the meat or marrow left over from carnivore kills. Others like Henry Bunn believe the hominins hunted and killed these animals, and carnivores later chewed the bones. This issue is still debated today, but archaeologist Pat Shipman provided evidence that scavenging was probably the more common practice; she published that the majority of carnivore teeth marks came before the cut marks. Another finding by Shipman at FLK-Zinj is that many of the wildebeest bones found there are over-represented by adult and male bones; and this may indicate that hominins were systematically hunting these animals as well as scavenging them. The question of whether hunting or scavenging was more important at Olduvai Gorge is still a controversial one.

Direct evidence of hominins scavenging remains from a big cat in the form of antelope bones that were gnawed on by a felid and then processed by hominins has been found at David&#x27;s Site from Olduvai Bed 1.

==Olduvai Gorge monument and museum==

In July 2019, the Olduvai Gorge Monument was erected at the turnoff to Olduvai Gorge from the road which connects Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Serengeti National Park (a route traveled by safari-goers). Eng. Joshua Mwankunda conceived the idea of erecting a monument to commemorate this significant site while also serving as a signpost and attracting visitors to the Olduvai Gorge and museum; paleoanthropologists Nicholas Toth, Kathy Schick, and Jackson Njau planned and provided life-size fossil casts at the request of the Tanzanian government, which were used by the celebrated Tanzanian artist Festo Kijo to create the two large concrete skulls. The monument consists of two large-scale models of fossil skulls which sit atop a large pedestal with an informative plaque mounted on the side of the pedestal. The fossil skulls depicted are &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot; and &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, two contemporary species which were first discovered at Olduvai Gorge. The large-scale models created by Kijo are each 6 feet tall and weigh 5,000 pounds. The monument project was funded by the Stone Age Institute and the John Templeton Foundation, in partnership with the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA).

The Olduvai Gorge Museum, located 5 km beyond the monument, is situated on the rim of the gorge at the junction of the main gorge and the side gorge. As one of the largest onsite museums in Africa, the museum provides educational exhibits related to the gorge and its long history.

==IUGS geological heritage site==
In respect of the presence of &#x27;palaeoanthropological sites indicating early hominin development and activities&#x27;, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included the &#x27;Palaeoanthropological Sites of Human Evolution of Laetoli – Olduvai Gorge&#x27; in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &#x27;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&#x27;

<doc id="319453" wikidata="Q1568763" url="?curid=319453" title="Zero-configuration networking">
<text>Zero-configuration networking (zeroconf) is a set of technologies that automatically creates a usable computer network based on the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) when computers or network peripherals are interconnected. It does not require manual operator intervention or special configuration servers. Without zeroconf, a network administrator must set up network services, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS), or configure each computer&#x27;s network settings manually.

Zeroconf is built on three core technologies: automatic assignment of numeric network addresses for networked devices, automatic distribution and resolution of computer hostnames, and automatic location of network services, such as printing devices.

==Background==
Computer networks use numeric network addresses to identify communications endpoints in a network of participating devices. This is similar to the telephone network which assigns a string of digits to identify each telephone. In modern networking protocols, information to be transmitted is divided into a series of network packets. Every packet contains the source and destination addresses for the transmission. Network routers examine these addresses to determine the best network path in forwarding the data packet at each step toward its destination.

Similarly to telephones being labeled with their telephone number, it was a common practice in early networks to attach an address label to networked devices. The dynamic nature of modern networks, especially residential networks in which devices are powered up only when needed, desire dynamic address assignment mechanisms that do not require user involvement for initialization and management. These systems automatically give themselves common names chosen either by the equipment manufacturer, such as a brand and model number or chosen by users for identifying their equipment. The names and addresses are then automatically entered into a directory service.

Early computer networking was built upon technologies of the telecommunications networks and thus protocols tended to fall into two groups: those intended to connect local devices into a local area network (LAN), and those intended primarily for long-distance communications. The latter wide area network (WAN) systems tended to have centralized setup, where a network administrator would manually assign addresses and names. LAN systems tended to provide more automation of these tasks so that new equipment could be added to a LAN with a minimum of operator and administrator intervention.

An early example of a zero-configuration LAN system is AppleTalk, a protocol introduced by Apple Inc. for the early Macintosh computers in the 1980s. Macs, as well as other devices supporting the protocol, could be added to the network by simply plugging them in; all further configuration was automated. Network addresses were automatically selected by each device using a protocol known as AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol (AARP), while each machine built its own local directory service using a protocol known as Name Binding Protocol (NBP). NBP included not only a name but the type of device and any additional user-provided information such as its physical location or availability. Users could look up any device on the network with the application Chooser, which filtered names based on the device type.

On Internet Protocol (IP) networks, the Domain Name System database for a network was initially maintained manually by a network administrator. Efforts to automate maintenance of this database, led to the introduction of a number of new protocols providing automated services, such as the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

==Address selection==
Hosts on a network must be assigned IP addresses that uniquely identify them to other devices on the same network. On some networks, there is a central authority that assigns these addresses as new devices are added. Mechanisms were introduced to handle this task automatically, and both IPv4 and IPv6 now include systems for address autoconfiguration, which allows a device to determine a safe address to use through simple mechanisms. For link-local addressing, IPv4 uses the special block , while IPv6 hosts use the prefix . More commonly addresses are assigned by a DHCP server, often built into common networking hardware like computer hosts or routers.

Most IPv4 hosts use link-local addressing only as a last resort when a DHCP server is unavailable. An IPv4 host otherwise uses its DHCP-assigned address for all communications, global or link-local. One reason is that IPv4 hosts are not required to support multiple addresses per interface, although many do. Another is that not every IPv4 host implements distributed name resolution (e.g., multicast DNS), so discovering the autoconfigured link-local address of another host on the network can be difficult. Discovering the DHCP-assigned address of another host requires either distributed name resolution or a unicast DNS server with this information; Some networks feature DNS servers that are automatically updated with DHCP-assigned host and address information.

IPv6 hosts are required to support multiple addresses per interface; moreover, every IPv6 host is required to configure a link-local address even when global addresses are available. IPv6 hosts may additionally self-configure additional addresses on receipt of router advertisement messages, thus eliminating the need for a DHCP server.

Both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts may randomly generate the host-specific part of an autoconfigured address. IPv6 hosts generally combine a prefix of up to 64 bits with a 64-bit EUI-64 derived from the factory-assigned 48-bit IEEE MAC address. The MAC address has the advantage of being globally unique, a basic property of the EUI-64. The IPv6 protocol stack also includes duplicate address detection to avoid conflicts with other hosts. In IPv4, the method is called &quot;link-local address autoconfiguration&quot;. However, Microsoft refers to this as &quot;Automatic Private IP Addressing&quot; (APIPA) or Internet Protocol Automatic Configuration (IPAC). The feature is supported in Windows since at least Windows 98.

==Name service discovery==
Internet protocols use IP addresses for communications, but these are not easy for humans to use; IPv6 in particular uses very long strings of digits that are not easily entered manually. To address this issue, the internet has long used DNS, which allows human-readable names to be associated with IP addresses, and includes code for looking up these names from a hierarchical database system. Users type in domain names, such as &quot;example.org&quot;, which the computer&#x27;s DNS software looks up in the DNS databases to retrieve an IP address, and then hands off that address to the protocol stack for further communications.

Looking up an address using DNS requires the IP address of the DNS server to be known. This has normally been accomplished by typing in the address of a known server into a field in one of the devices on the network. In early systems, this was normally required on every device, but this has been pushed up one layer in the hierarchy to the DHCP servers or broadband devices like cable modems that receive this information from their internet service provider. This has reduced the user-side administration requirements and provides a key element of zero-configuration access.

DNS was intended to provide uniform names to groups of devices within the same administration realm, such as &quot;example.org&quot;, provided by a name service. Assigning an address to a local device, e.g., &quot;thirdfloorprinter.example.org&quot;, normally requires administrator access to the DNS server and is often accomplished manually. Additionally, traditional DNS servers are not expected to automatically correct for changes in configuration. For instance, if a printer is moved from one floor to another it might be assigned a new IP address by the local DHCP server.

To address the need for automatic configuration, Microsoft implemented NetBIOS Name Service, part of which is the Computer Browser Service already in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 as early as 1992. NetBIOS Name Service is zero-configuration on networks with a single subnet and may be used in conjunction with a WINS server or a Microsoft DNS server that supports secure automatic registration of addresses. This system has small, but not zero, management overhead even on very large enterprise networks. The protocols NetBIOS can use are part of the Server Message Block (SMB) suite of open protocols which are also available on Linux and iOS, although Windows typically supports a wider range of so-called dialects which can be negotiated between Windows clients that support it. For example, Computer Browser Services running on server operating systems or later versions of Windows are elected as so-called &quot;master browser&quot; over those that are not running a server operating system or running older versions of Windows.

In 2000, Bill Manning and Bill Woodcock described the &quot;Multicast Domain Name Service&quot; which spawned the implementations by Apple and Microsoft. Both implementations are very similar. Apple&#x27;s Multicast DNS (mDNS) is published as a standards track proposal , while Microsoft&#x27;s Link-local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is published as informational . LLMNR is included in every Windows version from Windows Vista onwards and acts as a side-by-side alternative for Microsoft&#x27;s NetBIOS Name Service over IPv4 and as a replacement over IPv6, since NetBIOS is not available over IPv6. Apple&#x27;s implementation is available as the Bonjour service since 2002 in Mac OS X v10.2. The Bonjour implementation (mDNSResponder) is available under the Apache 2 Open Source License and is included in Android Jelly Bean and later under the same license.

Use of either NetBIOS or LLMNR services on Windows is essentially automatic, since using standard DNS client APIs will result in the use of either NetBIOS or LLMNR depending on what name is being resolved (whether the name is a local name or not), the network configuration in effect (e.g. DNS suffixes in effect) and (in corporate networks) the policies in effect (whether LLMNR or NetBIOS are disabled), although developers may opt into bypassing these services for individual address lookups.

The mDNS and LLMNR protocols have minor differences in their approach to name resolution. mDNS allows a network device to choose a domain name in the local DNS namespace and announce it using a special multicast IP address. This introduces special semantics for the top-level domain &quot;local&quot;, which is considered a problem by some members of the IETF. The current LLMNR draft allows a network device to choose any domain name, which is considered a security risk by some members of the IETF. mDNS is compatible with DNS-SD as described in the next section, while LLMNR is not.

==Service discovery==
Name services such as mDNS, LLMNR and others do not provide information about the type of device or its status. A user looking for a nearby printer, for instance, might be hindered if the printer was given the name &quot;Bob&quot;. Service discovery provides additional information about devices. Service discovery is sometimes combined with a name service, as in Apple&#x27;s Name Binding Protocol and Microsoft&#x27;s NetBIOS.

===NetBIOS Service Discovery===
NetBIOS on Windows supports individual hosts on the network to advertise services, such as file shares and printers. It also supports, for example, a network printer to advertise itself as a host sharing a printer device and any related services it supports. Depending on how a device is attached (to the network directly, or to the host which shares it) and which protocols are supported. However, Windows clients connecting to it may prefer to use SSDP or WSD using NetBIOS. NetBIOS is one of the providers on Windows implementing the more general discovery process dubbed &quot;function discovery&quot; which includes built-in providers for PnP, Registry, NetBIOS, SSDP and WSD of which the former two are local-only and the latter three support discovery of networked devices. None of these need any configuration for use on the local subnet. NetBIOS has traditionally been supported only in expensive printers for corporate use though some entry-level printers with Wi-Fi or Ethernet support it natively, allowing the printer to be used without configuration even on very old operating systems.

===WS-Discovery===
Web Services Dynamic Discovery (WS-Discovery) is a technical specification that defines a multicast discovery protocol to locate services on a local network. It operates over TCP and UDP port 3702 and uses IP multicast address . As the name suggests, the actual communication between nodes is done using web services standards, notably SOAP-over-UDP. Windows supports it in the form of Web Services for Devices and Devices Profile for Web Services. Many devices, such as HP and Brother printers, support it.

===DNS-based service discovery===
 (DNS Service Discovery) allows clients to discover a named list of service instances and to resolve those services to hostnames using standard DNS queries. The specification is compatible with existing unicast DNS server and client software, but works equally well with mDNS in a zero-configuration environment. Each service instance is described using a DNS SRV and DNS TXT record. A client discovers the list of available instances for a given service type by querying the DNS PTR record of that service type&#x27;s name; the server returns zero or more names of the form &lt;Service&gt;.&lt;Domain&gt;, each corresponding to a SRV/TXT record pair. The SRV record resolves to the domain name providing the instance, while the TXT can contain service-specific configuration parameters. A client can then resolve the A/AAAA record for the domain name and connect to the service.

Service types are given on a first-come-first-serve basis. A service type registry was originally maintained by DNS-SD.org, but has since been merged into IANA&#x27;s registry for DNS SRV records.

====History====
In 1997 Stuart Cheshire proposed adapting Apple&#x27;s mature Name Binding Protocol to IP networks to address the lack of service discovery capability. Cheshire subsequently joined Apple and authored IETF draft proposals for mDNS and DNS-based Service Discovery, supporting the transition from AppleTalk to IP networking. In 2002, Apple announced an implementation of both protocols under the name Rendezvous (later renamed Bonjour). It was first included in Mac OS X 10.2, replacing the Service Location Protocol (SLP) used in 10.1. In 2013, the proposals were ratified as and .

====DNS-SD with multicast====
mDNS uses packets similar to unicast DNS to resolve hostnames except they are sent over a multicast link. Each host listens on the mDNS port, 5353, transmitted to a well-known multicast address and resolves requests for the DNS record of its &quot;.local&quot; hostname (e.g. the A, AAAA, CNAME) to its IP address. When an mDNS client needs to resolve a local hostname to an IP address, it sends a DNS request for that name to the well-known multicast address; the computer with the corresponding A/AAAA record replies with its IP address. The mDNS multicast address is for IPv4 and for IPv6 link-local addressing.

DNS Service Discovery aka DNS-SD requests can also be sent using mDNS to yield zero-configuration DNS-SD. This uses DNS PTR, SRV, TXT records to advertise instances of service types, domain names for those instances, and optional configuration parameters for connecting to those instances. But SRV records can now resolve to &quot;.local&quot; domain names, which mDNS can resolve to local IP addresses.

====Support====
DNS-SD is used by Apple products, most network printers, many Linux distributions including Debian and Ubuntu, and a number of third-party products for various operating systems. For example, many OS X network applications written by Apple, including Safari, iChat, and Messages, can use DNS-SD to locate nearby servers and peer-to-peer clients. Windows 10 includes support for DNS-SD for applications written using JavaScript. Individual applications may include their own support in older versions of the operating system, such that most instant messaging and VoIP clients on Windows support DNS-SD. Some Unix, BSD, and Linux distributions also include DNS-SD. For example, Ubuntu ships Avahi, an mDNS/DNS-SD implementation, in its base distribution.

===UPnP===
UPnP has some protocol components with the purpose of service discovery.

====SSDP====
Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) is a UPnP protocol, used in Windows XP and later. SSDP uses HTTP notification announcements that give a service-type URI and a Unique Service Name (USN). Service types are regulated by the Universal Plug and Play Steering Committee. SSDP is supported by many printer, NAS and appliance manufacturers such as Brother. It is supported by certain brands of network equipment, and in many SOHO firewall appliances, where host computers behind it may pierce holes for applications. It is also used in home theater PC systems to facilitate media exchange between host computers and the media center.

====DLNA====
Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) is another suite of standards that uses UPnP for the discovery of networked devices. DLNA has a long list of prominent manufacturers producing devices such as TVs, NAS devices and so forth that support it. DLNA is supported by all major operating systems. DLNA service discovery is layered on top of SSDP.

====Efforts toward an IETF standard protocol====
SLP is supported by Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s network printers, Novell, and Sun Microsystems. SLP is described in and and implementations are available for both Solaris and Linux.

===AllJoyn===
AllJoyn is an open-source software stack for a myriad of devices, ranging from IoT devices to full-size computers, for discovery and control of devices on networks (Wifi, Ethernet) and other links (Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc.). It uses mDNS and HTTP over UDP and other protocols. The project has however not been active since 2016, and is not recommended to use for new projects.

==Standardization==
, the SLP standard for figuring out where to get services, was published in June 1999 by the SVRLOC IETF working group.

, a standard for choosing addresses for networked items, was published in March 2005 by the IETF Zeroconf working group. The group included individuals from Apple, Sun, and Microsoft.

LLMNR was submitted for official adoption in the IETF DNSEXT working group, however, failed to gain consensus and thus was published as informational in January 2007.

Following the failure of LLMNR to become an Internet standard and given that mDNS/DNS-SD is used much more widely than LLMNR, Apple was asked by the IETF to submit the mDNS/DNS-SD specs for publication as Informational RFC as well.

In February 2013 mDNS and DNS-SD were published as Standards Track Proposals and .

==Security issues==
Because mDNS operates under a different trust model than unicast DNS—trusting the entire network rather than a designated DNS server, it is vulnerable to spoofing attacks by any system within the same broadcast domain. Like SNMP and many other network management protocols, it can also be used by attackers to quickly gain detailed knowledge of the network and its machines. Because of this, applications should still authenticate and encrypt traffic to remote hosts (e.g. via RSA, SSH, etc.) after discovering and resolving them through DNS-SD/mDNS. LLMNR suffers from similar vulnerabilities.

==Major implementations==

===Apple Bonjour===
Bonjour from Apple, uses mDNS and DNS Service Discovery. Apple changed its preferred zeroconf technology from SLP to mDNS and DNS-SD between Mac OS X 10.1 and 10.2, though SLP continues to be supported by Mac OS X.

Apple&#x27;s mDNSResponder has interfaces for C and Java and is available on BSD, Apple Mac OS X, Linux, other POSIX based operating systems and MS Windows. The Windows downloads are available from Apple&#x27;s website.

===Avahi===
Avahi is a Zeroconf implementation for Linux and BSDs. It implements IPv4LL, mDNS and DNS-SD. It is part of most Linux distributions, and is installed by default on some. If run in conjunction with nss-mdns, it also offers host name resolution.

Avahi also implements binary compatibility libraries that emulate Bonjour and the historical mDNS implementation Howl, so software made to use those implementations can also utilize Avahi through the emulation interfaces.

===MS Windows CE 5.0===
Microsoft Windows CE 5.0 includes Microsoft&#x27;s own implementation of LLMNR.

===Systemd===
Systemd implements both mDNS and LLMNR in codice_1.

===Link-local IPv4 addresses===
Where no DHCP server is available to assign a host an IP address, the host can select its own link-local address. Using a link-local address, hosts can communicate over this link but only locally; Access to other networks and the Internet is not possible. There are some link-local IPv4 address implementations available:
* Apple Mac OS and MS Windows have supported link-local addresses since Windows 98 and Mac OS 8.5 (both released in 1998). Apple released its open-source implementation in the Darwin bootp package.
* Avahi contains an implementation of IPv4LL in the avahi-autoipd tool.
* Zero-Conf IP (zcip)
* BusyBox can embed a simple IPv4LL implementation.
* Stablebox, a fork from Busybox, offers a slightly modified IPv4LL implementation named llad.
* Zeroconf is a package based on Simple IPv4LL, a shorter implementation by Arthur van Hoff.

The above implementations are all stand-alone daemons or plugins for DHCP clients that only deal with link-local IP addresses. Another approach is to include support in new or existing DHCP clients:
* Elvis Pfützenreuter has written a patch for the uDHCP client/server.
* dhcpcd is an open source DHCP client for Linux and BSD that includes IPv4LL support. It is included as standard in NetBSD.

Neither of these implementations addresses kernel issues like broadcasting ARP replies or closing existing network connections.

<text>A tontine () is an investment linked to a living person which provides an income for as long as that person is alive. Such schemes originated as plans for governments to raise capital in the 17th century and became relatively widespread in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Tontines enable subscribers to share the risk of living a long life by combining features of a group annuity with a kind of mortality lottery. Each subscriber pays a sum into a trust and thereafter receives a periodical payout. As members die, their payout entitlements devolve to the other participants, and so the value of each continuing payout increases. On the death of the final member, the trust scheme is usually wound up.

Tontines are still common in France. They can be issued by European insurers under the Directive 2002/83/EC of the European Parliament. The Pan-European Pension Regulation passed by the European Commission in 2019 also contains provisions that specifically permit next-generation pension products that abide by the &quot;tontine principle&quot; to be offered in the 27 EU member states.

Questionable practices by U.S. life insurers in 1906 led to the Armstrong Investigation in the United States restricting some forms of tontines. Nevertheless, in March 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that tontines were getting fresh consideration as a way for people to get steady retirement income.

==History==
The investment plan is named after Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is popularly credited with inventing it in France in 1653. He more probably merely modified existing Italian investment schemes; while another precursor was a proposal put to the Senate of Lisbon by Nicolas Bourey in 1641. Tonti put his proposal to the French royal government, but after consideration it was rejected by the Parlement de Paris.

The first true tontine was therefore organised in the city of Kampen in the Netherlands in October 1670, and was soon followed by three other cities. The French finally established a state tontine in 1689 (though it was not described by that name because Tonti had died in disgrace, about five years earlier). The English government organised a tontine in 1693. Nine further government tontines were organised in France down to 1759; four more in Britain down to 1789; and others in the Netherlands and some of the German states. Those in Britain were not fully subscribed, and in general the British schemes tended to be less popular and successful than their continental counterparts.

By the end of the 18th century, the tontine had fallen out of favour as a revenue-raising instrument with governments, but smaller-scale and less formal tontines continued to be arranged between individuals or to raise funds for specific projects throughout the 19th century, and, in modified form, to the present day.

==Concept==
Each investor pays a sum into the tontine. Each investor then receives annual interest on the capital invested. As each investor dies, their share is reallocated among the surviving investors. This process continues until the death of the final investor, when the trust scheme is wound up. Each subscriber receives only interest; the capital is never paid back.

Strictly speaking, the transaction involves four different roles:

# the government or corporate body that organizes the scheme, receives the contributions and manages the capital
# the subscribers who provide the capital
# the shareholders who receive the annual interest
# the nominees on whose lives the contracts are contingent

In most 18th- and 19th-century schemes, parties 2 to 4 were the same individuals; but in a significant minority of schemes each initial subscriber–shareholder was permitted to invest in the name of another party (generally one of his or her own children), who would inherit that share on the subscriber&#x27;s death.

Because younger nominees clearly had a longer life expectancy, the 17th- and 18th-century tontines were normally divided into several &quot;classes&quot; by age (typically in bands of 5, 7 or 10 years): each class effectively formed a separate tontine, with the shares of deceased members devolving to fellow-nominees within the same class.

Works of fiction (see In popular culture below) often feature a variant model of the tontine in which the capital devolves upon the last surviving nominee, thereby dissolving the trust and potentially making the survivor very wealthy. It is unclear whether this model ever existed in the real world.

==Patent==
 Financial inventions were patentable under French law from January 1791 until September 1792. In June 1792 a patent was issued to inventor F. P. Dousset for a new type of tontine in combination with a lottery.

In 2024, Tontine Trust founder Dean McClelland was granted a patent in Canada for a System And Method For A Global Peer To Peer Retirement Savings System for the operation of digital tontines.

==Uses and abuses==
Louis XIV first made use of tontines in 1689 to fund military operations when he could not otherwise raise the money. The initial subscribers each put in 300 livres and, unlike many later schemes, this one was run honestly; the last survivor, a widow named Charlotte Barbier, who died in 1726 at the age of 96, received 73,000 livres in her last payment. The English government first issued tontines in 1693 to fund a war against France, part of the Nine Years&#x27; War.

Tontines soon caused financial problems for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended to underestimate the longevity of the population. At first, tontine holders included men and women of all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to game the system, and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, but significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s tontines had been replaced by other investment vehicles, such as &quot;penny policies&quot;, a predecessor of the 20th-century pension scheme.

A property development tontine, The Victoria Park Company, was at the heart of the notable case of &quot;Foss v Harbottle&quot; in mid-19th-century England.

==Projects funded by tontines==

Tontines were often used to raise funds for private or public works projects. These sometimes contained the word &quot;tontine&quot; in their name.

Some notable tontine-funded projects included:
* The Assembly Rooms, Bath, were built between 1769 and 1771, funded by a tontine.
* Richmond Bridge, across the River Thames west of London, was financed through a tontine authorised by the Richmond Bridge Act 1773 (13 Geo. 3. c. 83). Once the bridge was completed in 1777, it was the toll charged to cross the bridge that was shared between the investors, each receiving a larger share as the others died. The last survivor received the entire toll income until his death when the toll booth on the south bank was demolished, and the bridge became free to cross. Although the bridge was widened on the upstream side in 1938 using the original facing stones, the bridge remains the oldest bridge crossing the Thames.
* The Tontine Hotel in Ironbridge, Shropshire, stands prominently at one end of the Iron Bridge from which the town takes its name: it was built in 1780–84 by the proprietors of the bridge to accommodate tourists who came to view this wonder of the industrial age.
* The Tontine Hotel and Assembly Rooms, Glasgow, were funded through two tontines of 1781 and 1796.
* The Tontine Coffee House on Wall Street in New York City, built in 1792, was the first home of the New York Stock Exchange.
* The first Freemasons&#x27; Hall, London. Subscribers were able to nominate someone other than themselves as the person on whose life the share was staked. On the subscriber&#x27;s death they could leave their share to that person, or to anyone else. The scheme raised £5,000, but cost £21,750 in interest over its 87-year life.
* The Tontine Hotel, Greenock, Inverclyde, Scotland, was built in 1803.
* The Cleveland Tontine hotel, near Ingleby Arncliffe, North Yorkshire, originally a coaching inn on the Yarm to Thirsk turnpike road, was financed using a tontine in 1804.
* The Theatre Royal, Bath, was erected in 1805, funded through a tontine, with the Prince Regent and his brother Prince Frederick among the subscribers.

==Tontine pensions in the US: 1868–1906==
Tontines became associated with life insurance in the United States in 1868 when Henry Baldwin Hyde of the Equitable Life Assurance Society introduced them as a means of selling more life insurance and meeting the demands of competition. Over the next four decades, the Equitable and its imitators sold approximately 9 million policies – two-thirds of the nation&#x27;s outstanding insurance contracts. During the Panic of 1873 many life insurance companies went out of business as deteriorating financial conditions created solvency problems: those that survived had all offered tontines. However, the contracts included an obligation to maintain monthly payments, and as a result spawned large numbers of policy owners whose life savings were wiped out by a single missed payment. The profits produced by the tontines&#x27; deferred payout structures proved tempting for the issuers – especially the profligate James Hyde. As the funds in the investment account accumulated, they found their way into directors&#x27; and agents&#x27; pockets, and also into the hands of judges and legislators, who reciprocated with prejudicial judgments and laws.

Finally, in 1905, the Armstrong Investigation was set up to enquire into the selling of tontines. It resulted in the banning of the continued sale of any tontines which contained toxic clauses for consumers. In essence, these toxic versions of tontine pensions were effectively (though not literally) outlawed in response to corrupt insurance company management.

When Equitable Life Assurance was establishing its business in Australia in the 1880s, an actuary of the Australian Mutual Provident Society criticised tontine insurance, calling it &quot;an immoral contract&quot; which &quot;put a premium on murder&quot;. In New Zealand at the time, another of the chief critics of tontines had been the government, which also issued its own insurance.

==Modern regulation==
In France and Belgium, tontines clauses are inserted into contracts such as ownership deeds for property as a means to potentially reduce inheritance tax.

The First Life Directive of the European Union includes tontines as a permitted class of business for insurers. However, this does not mean that tontines should be considered insurance contracts. According to the Supreme Court of the United States the nature of &quot;insurance&quot; involves some investment risk-taking on the part of the company. Tontines replace idiosyncratic longevity risk with systemic longevity risk and therefore have aspects of insurance however unless the issuer of a tontine provides a fixed return, the issuer assumes no true risk in the insurance sense.

The new Pan-European Pension legislation which came into effect in March 2022 specifically paves the way for other types of financial service providers to create new pension products that abide by the &quot;tontine principle&quot; which tontine PEPP (pan-European Personal Pension Product) products can be offered throughout Europe once approved in a single member state.

In most places in the United States using tontines to raise capital or obtain lifetime income is consistently upheld as being legal; however, legislation in two states has fostered the false perception that selling tontines in the broader U.S. is not legal.

Several new pension architectures have been designed or deployed which partially or fully utilise the tontine risk-sharing structure including:
* Collective Defined Contribution (CDC) pensions which will soon be offered in the UK,
* Pan-European Pensions which can be offered in 27 EU member countries plus Switzerland, Canada, Norway Iceland &amp; Liechtenstein,
* Pooled Annuity Funds
* Group Self-Annuitization Schemes.

==Variant uses of the term==
In French-speaking cultures, particularly in developing countries, the meaning of the term &quot;tontine&quot; has broadened to encompass a wider range of semi-formal group savings and microcredit schemes. The crucial difference between these and tontines in the traditional sense is that benefits do not depend on the deaths of other members.

As a type of rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA), tontines are well established as a savings instrument in central Africa, and in this case function as savings clubs in which each member makes regular payments and is lent the in turn. They are wound up after each cycle of loans. In West Africa, &quot;tontines&quot; – often consisting of mainly women – are an example of economic, social and cultural solidarity.

Informal group savings and loan associations are also traditional in many east Asian societies, and under the name of tontines are found in Cambodia, and among emigrant Cambodian communities.

In Singapore, the Chit Funds Act of 1971 defines the application of legislation to the operation of chit funds, which were also known colloquially as tontines (although more properly a variant type of ROSCA).

In Malaysia, chit funds are primarily known as &quot;kootu funds&quot;, which again are ROSCAs and which are defined under the &quot;Kootu Funds (Prohibition) Act 1971&quot; as
&quot;...a scheme or arrangement variously known as a kootu, cheetu, chit fund, hwei, tontine or otherwise whereby the participants subscribe periodically or otherwise to a common fund and such common fund is put up for sale or payment to the participants by auction, tender, bid, ballot or otherwise...&quot;.

In the UK during the mid-20th century, the term &quot;tontine&quot; was applied to communal Christmas saving schemes, with participants making regular payments of an agreed sum through the year, which would be withdrawn shortly before Christmas to fund gifts and festivities.

==In popular culture==

Tontines (or schemes described as tontines) have been featured as plot devices in many stories, movies and television programs, including:
* &quot;La Tontine&quot; (1708), a comic play by Alain-René Lesage. A physician, hoping to raise the funds to give his daughter a dowry, buys a tontine on the life of an elderly peasant, whom he then strives to keep alive.
* &quot;The Great Tontine&quot; (1881), a novel by Hawley Smart
* &quot;The Wrong Box&quot; (1889), a comic novel by Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne. The plot revolves around a tontine originally taken out for some wealthy English children, and the resulting shenanigans as younger family members of the two final elderly survivors vie to secure the final payout. The book was adapted as a film, &quot;The Wrong Box&quot;, produced and directed by Bryan Forbes, in 1966.
* &quot;The Secret Tontine&quot; (1912), an atmospheric faux-gothic novel by Robert Murray Gilchrist, set in the Derbyshire Peak District during a snowy winter in the late 19th century. The plot involves the potential beneficiaries of a covert tontine, and their scheme to murder their ignorant rivals.
* Lillian de la Torre&#x27;s short story &quot;The Tontine Curse&quot; (1948) features mysterious deaths related to a tontine in 1779, being investigated by Samuel Johnson.
* &quot;The Tontine&quot; (1955), a novel by Thomas B. Costain, illustrated by Herbert Ryman, is set in nineteenth-century England and tells a story centered around the fictional &quot;Waterloo Tontine&quot;, established to benefit veterans of the Napoleonic wars. Among other plot twists, shareholders hire an actor to impersonate a dead nominee, and conspire to murder another member.
* In &quot;4.50 from Paddington&quot; (1957), a Miss Marple murder mystery by Agatha Christie, the plot revolves around the will of a wealthy industrialist, which establishes a settlement under which his estate is divided in trust among his grandchildren, the final survivor to inherit the whole. The settlement is described, inaccurately, as a tontine. K. Tombs uses the term in the same (inaccurate) way in a more recent murder mystery, &quot;The Malvern Murders&quot;.
* &quot;Something Fishy&quot; (1957), a novel by P. G. Wodehouse, features a so-called tontine under which the investors&#x27; sons stand to gain from marrying late.
* In the U.S. television series &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, Episode 16 of Season Two (1966–67) – &quot;The Night of the Tottering Tontine&quot; – finds James West and Artemus Gordon protecting a man who is a member of a tontine whose members are being murdered one by another.
* &quot;Old Soldiers&quot;, an eighth-season episode of the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, focuses on a tontine set up among Colonel Potter and several of his Army buddies from World War I. While taking shelter in a château during an artillery barrage, they had found a cache of brandy and drank all but one bottle, which they set aside for the last survivor. After the only other surviving member dies, Potter receives the bottle in the mail and shares it with his staff, drinking first to his departed friends and then to the new ones he has made at the 4077th.
* In the &quot;Barney Miller&quot; episode &quot;The Tontine&quot; (1982), one of the last two surviving family members who invested in the tontine attempts to kill himself so that the other can have the money before growing too old to enjoy it.
* In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in &#x27;The Curse of the Flying Hellfish&#x27; (1996), Grampa Simpson and Mr. Burns are the final survivors of a tontine to determine ownership of art looted during World War II. Grampa eventually kicks Burns out of the tontine for trying to kill him, but before he and Bart can do anything with the art, agents of the US State Department arrive to return the paintings to a descendant of the original owner.
* &quot;The Mystery of Men&quot; (1999), a TV film starring Warren Clarke, Neil Pearson and Nick Berry, deals with four friends in a tontine scheme suddenly realising they will benefit from each other&#x27;s deaths.
* In S. L. Viehl&#x27;s science fiction multi-volume novel &quot;Stardoc&quot; (2000), the title character is accused of spreading a plague to several colony worlds, on one of which the colonists had established a tontine. The sole survivor, a little girl, consequently becomes so wealthy that in the second book of the series – &quot;Beyond Varallan&quot; (2000) – she buys the bank behind the colonies to free the Stardoc from the debt she now owes.
* The 2001 comedy film &quot;Tomcats&quot; features a variation on a tontine where the last investor to get married gets the full amount of the invested funds.
* The &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Being of Sound Mind&quot; (2001) features a tontine as a motive for murder.
* In the &quot;Archer&quot; episode &quot;The Double Deuce&quot; (2011), Archer&#x27;s valet Woodhouse is revealed as one of three final survivors of a group of World War I Royal Flying Corps squadron mates who each put £50 into an interest-bearing account, now worth nearly a million dollars. The office workers at ISIS HQ, realizing that a new tontine could capitalize on the high mortality rate of field agents, begin persuading people to join.
* The &quot;Brokenwood Mysteries&quot; episode &quot;Tontine&quot; (2018) centers on a tontine.

<text>Harry Christopher&quot;Chip&quot;Caray III (born February 27, 1965) is an American television broadcaster for Bally Sports Midwest coverage of St. Louis Cardinals baseball. He joined the Cardinals&#x27; broadcast team after leaving the Atlanta Braves, where he had served as the television play-by-play voice from 2005 to 2022. Chip is also known from his time as a broadcaster for the &quot;Fox Saturday Game of the Week&quot; and as the television play-by-play broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs from to . He is the son of broadcaster Skip Caray, the grandson of broadcaster Harry Caray, and the father of broadcaster Chris Caray.

==Biography==

===Education and early career===

Caray attended Parkway West High School in Chesterfield, Missouri. He graduated from the University of Georgia in 1987 with a degree in journalism. Well before his first big job with Fox, he worked with local television stations in Panama City, Florida, and Greensboro, North Carolina. He was the play-by-play broadcaster for the Orlando Magic of the NBA from 1989 to 1998.

Caray worked on baseball games for the Seattle Mariners of the American League from to . While broadcasting with the Mariners, Caray received a two-game tryout with the St. Louis Cardinals. After the 1994 season, he was expected to sign with St. Louis, but chose instead to remain with Seattle. Caray was also a broadcaster for the first edition of &quot;Major League Baseball on Fox&quot; in .

===Chicago Cubs===

In December 1997, Chip Caray was hired to work alongside his grandfather as broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs. Harry Caray died in February 1998, and Chip stayed with the team and took his grandfather&#x27;s place as &quot;the voice of the Cubs.&quot; He would go on to serve as their announcer for seven seasons, with Steve Stone providing the color commentary for most of those years. In 2004, both Caray and Stone left the Cubs booth after the season.

===TBS===
On the final day of the 2004 season, Caray announced that he had signed a long-term contract with both TBS and Clear Channel to work alongside his father, Skip, broadcasting games for the Atlanta Braves, staying closer to his family, who lived in Orlando, Florida. Chip Caray also became a broadcaster for TBS&#x27;s college football coverage of the Big 12 and Pac-10.

In 2007, there was a major shake-up of the Braves broadcasters: Don Sutton departed to be the full-time broadcaster with the Washington Nationals; Skip Caray and Pete Van Wieren went to the Braves Radio Network full-time; and Joe Simpson signed with Fox Broadcasting Company to be a color analyst on FSN South and Sports South and also signed to call a limited schedule of games on TBS with Chip Caray. It was announced that Caray would be a broadcaster for TBS, and would be the main play-by-play broadcaster for TBS during its coverage of the Major League Baseball playoffs. TBS would cover all Division Series games and the National League Championship Series. Hall of Fame player Tony Gwynn called the playoff games with Caray.

Caray was criticized for making factual mistakes during postseason broadcasts on TBS. In response to such criticisms, Caray said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t the job that I had when I came here in the first place. It would be like being a pinch-hitter or being a relief pitcher that works once every 10 days. I&#x27;m better when I work more.&quot;
On November 30, 2009, TBS announced that Caray and the network decided to part ways.

===Fox Sports South===

On December 21, 2009, Fox Sports South and SportSouth announced that Caray would be the play-by-play announcer for all 105 Braves games on the networks. The deal also includes selected college basketball games on the regional sports networks.

===Bally Sports Midwest===

On January 23, 2023, it was announced that Caray would become the play-by-play announcer for the St. Louis Cardinals, taking over for longtime broadcaster Dan McLaughlin. His grandfather had begun his career as the voice of the Cardinals.

==Family==

Chip Caray&#x27;s grandfather, Harry, was famous for calling games of the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago White Sox, and Chicago Cubs. His father, Skip, was the longtime broadcaster for the Atlanta Braves until he died in 2008. Chip Caray occasionally imitates his father with sarcastic comments made in a high, nasal voice. Caray also has a half-brother, Josh Caray, who is the play-by-play announcer for the Rocket City Trash Pandas (the Class AA affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels).

Caray is married to Susan. They have three sons, Chris, Stefan, and Tristan, and a daughter, Summerlyn. Caray&#x27;s twin sons, Chris and Stefan, attended the University of Georgia and began their professional sportscasting career with the Amarillo Sod Poodles, the Texas League affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks. In 2023, they were placed in the Arizona Fall League broadcast pool. Chip met son Chris when the Cardinals played the Athletics in Oakland on April 15, 2024. Chris was broadcasting Athletics&#x27; games for NBC Sports California in his second big-league series, while Chip called the Cardinals games. Chris is in a play-by-play rotation with Jenny Cavnar — who has the bulk of the games and is the first woman to be in a team&#x27;s primary role.

<text>Harry Christopher &quot;Skip&quot; Caray Jr. (August 12, 1939 – August 3, 2008) was an American sportscaster, best known for his long career as a radio and television play-by-play announcer for the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball. He was the son of baseball announcer Harry Caray, and the father of St. Louis Cardinals play-by-play announcer and former fellow Braves broadcaster Chip Caray; another son, Josh Caray, is the play-by-play announcer for the minor league Rocket City Trash Pandas.

==Early life and education==
Skip Caray grew up in baseball as the son of Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Caray, who would routinely refer to his son at 8:30 p.m. during every broadcast by saying, &quot;Good night, Skippy&quot;, a phrase for which the younger Caray was teased throughout his adolescence.

He studied television and radio at the University of Missouri where he received a degree in journalism, and was a member of Phi Gamma Delta. He began his career in St. Louis calling Saint Louis University and St. Louis Hawks basketball games. In 1968, Caray moved with the Hawks to Atlanta, where he also called Atlanta Flames hockey games and did morning sportscasts on WSB-AM.

==Career==
===Atlanta Braves===

In 1976, Caray was added to the broadcast team for the Braves, a position he held until his death. In September 2007, he was not asked to announce League Division Series games on TBS, and was kept exclusive to the Braves as the team&#x27;s broadcasts moved to local Atlanta station WPCH-TV (Peachtree TV, a direct descendant of the original WTBS). Caray felt slighted by the move.

Perhaps Caray&#x27;s most memorable call was his description of Francisco Cabrera&#x27;s game-winning hit in Game 7 of the 1992 National League Championship Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The game itself was ultimately decided on Braves first-baseman Sid Bream beating out Pirates left-fielder Barry Bonds&#x27; throw to home plate.

Three years later, the Braves defeated the Cleveland Indians in Game 6 of the 1995 World Series to earn the city of Atlanta its first major professional sports championship. Caray called Marquis Grissom catching the final out in center field. 

According to &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,&quot; Caray&#x27;s calls of the 1992 pennant win and 1995 World Series win were &quot;the two most iconic calls&quot; in Braves history.

Caray was inducted into the Atlanta Braves Hall of Fame in 2004 alongside long-time Braves broadcaster Pete Van Wieren. He has been recognized with six Georgia Sportscaster-of-the Year awards from the National Sportswriters and Sportscasters Association, as well as a Georgia-area Emmy award.

On December 18, 2006, the Braves organization announced that Caray (and partner Van Wieren) had signed three-year contracts to continue doing Braves game broadcasts on their radio network. However, Caray only announced ten games on TBS in the 2007 season before being relegated to Peachtree TV.

On the final broadcast of &quot;Braves TBS Baseball&quot; (September 30, 2007), Caray thanked fans saying, &quot;To all you people who have watched the Braves for these 30 years ... thank you. We appreciate you more than you will ever know. ... Thank you folks and God bless you. And we&#x27;re going to miss you every bit as much as you miss us.&quot;

===NBC Sports===
In 2000, NBC hired Caray to do play-by-play with Joe Morgan on the AL Division Series between the New York Yankees and Oakland Athletics. Caray was filling in for Bob Costas, who sat out the Division Series after anchoring NBC&#x27;s prime time coverage of the Summer Olympic Games from Sydney, Australia.

===Other appearances===
On December 11, 1982, Caray along with Abe Lemons called the much hyped college basketball contest between Virginia and Georgetown (led by Ralph Sampson and Patrick Ewing respectively) for TBS. Caray also called play-by-play for the first two seasons (1990–91) of the TNT network&#x27;s Sunday night NFL coverage as well as TBS&#x27; coverage of the NBA and college football, and anchored TBS&#x27; coverage of the 1990 Goodwill Games. He made his motion picture debut in the 1985 movie &quot;The Slugger&#x27;s Wife&quot;, starring Michael O&#x27;Keefe, Randy Quaid and Rebecca De Mornay. Caray frequently mocked his participation in the film on-air and referred to it as one of the worst movies ever made, often saying that the actors in the movie probably watched it as the in-flight movie on their way back to Los Angeles. Caray was also the lead play-by-play man for The Baseball Network&#x27;s (a joint venture of ABC and NBC Sports respectively) regional coverage of Braves games during that ill-fated experiment&#x27;s two seasons (1994 and 1995) usually alongside the opposing team&#x27;s secondary play-by-play man or color commentator.

==Broadcasting style==
Caray&#x27;s broadcasts were characterized by his witty and sarcastic sense of humor, a personality trait that endeared him to most fans, but alienated him from some. For example, during a particularly long losing streak in the 1980s, Caray declared at the start of a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, &quot;And, like lambs to the slaughter, the Braves take the field&quot;. Other frequent targets of Caray&#x27;s jokes included the Montreal Expos&#x27; mascot Youppi, New York Mets fans, professional wrestling, The Wave, TBS baseball broadcast producer Glenn Diamond, and the post game B-movie frequently shown on TBS during the 1980s. In one instance, in order to get back at &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; columnist Ron Hudspeth for a critical column, Caray paid to have an airplane tow a banner above Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium during a Braves game which read, &quot;For a good time, call Rona Hudspeth&quot;, and included Ron&#x27;s actual phone number.

Among other memorable lines, Caray said of Braves pitcher Charlie Kerfeld, who was 6&#x27;4&quot; and 245 lbs., &quot;Boy, he is big enough to go to work.&quot; And during a losing streak, after talking about a promotion in which Braves fans could come on the field and meet the players, Caray commented, &quot;The way things are going, we may make the fans go through a metal detector on the way to the field.&quot;

Caray was also known for his tendency to identify the hometowns of fans who catch foul balls during Braves games in jest. Fans who reside in the metro Atlanta area were identified by a random suburb, though there was no legitimacy behind these references. Similarly, when daytime home games went long, Caray would routinely give a &quot;traffic report&quot; at exactly 5 o&#x27;clock on radio broadcasts. It consisted of his rattling off a random list of major Atlanta arteries, and describing each one as hopelessly backed up. When the Braves suffered a severely bad outing, and the score was strongly lopsided in favor of the other team, in late innings he would often tell fans &quot;It&#x27;s OK to walk the dog now, folks, if you promise to support our sponsors.&quot;

In addition to his play-by-play duties, Caray also hosted a pre-game call in show on WSB until 2004.

==Criticism==
In June 2000, Caray, along with fellow Braves broadcasters Joe Simpson, Pete Van Wieren and Don Sutton, were banned from Atlanta Braves team charter flights for several games after criticizing Braves catcher Javy López for being penalized for setting up outside the catchers box during a game against the Milwaukee Brewers.

In an attempt to combat criticism of Caray&#x27;s on-air &quot;home team&quot; bias and to market its baseball coverage to non-Braves fans, during the 2003 season, TBS removed him and Pete Van Wieren from announcing Braves games on television. The move was strongly criticized by Braves fans, the local Atlanta media, and Braves manager Bobby Cox. Over 90% of Braves fans who voted in an online poll conducted by the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; preferred Caray and Van Wieren to the more neutral broadcasts. The move backfired, and ratings for the TBS broadcasts declined sharply. After the All-Star Break, Caray and Van Wieren were returned to the booth. They were taken off permanently in 2007 with TBS hiring new broadcasters for their playoff coverage later in the year.
==Death==
On August 3, 2008, the Atlanta Braves announced that Caray had died at the age of 68. His wife, Paula, reported to the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; that on Sunday afternoon when she thought her husband was napping, she looked out the window and saw a bird feeder not hanging where it should be and thought it had been blown down by the wind. When she stood up, she noticed her husband lying on the ground next to the bird feeder. He had been suffering from failing health for nearly a year prior, but returned to work for the 2008 season, calling a game on radio as recently as three days before his death. Tributes to Caray were given on all of the Atlanta television stations that evening and on WGST-AM the next morning.

Shortly after Caray&#x27;s death, the Atlanta Braves began wearing a memorial patch on their uniforms that read &quot;SKIP&quot;, which appeared on the sleeve opposite the &quot;BEACH&quot; patch honoring Jim Beauchamp that they had been wearing since the beginning of the 2008 season.

<text>From January 14 to June 8, 2004, voters of the Democratic Party chose its nominee for president in the 2004 United States presidential election.

Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts was selected as the nominee through a series of primary elections and caucuses culminating in the 2004 Democratic National Convention held from July 26 to July 29, 2004, in Boston, Massachusetts. Kerry went on to lose the general election on November 2, 2004, to incumbent Republican President George W. Bush.

==Primary race overview==
Ten candidates vied for the nomination, including retired four-star general Wesley Clark, former Vermont Governor Howard Dean, and Senators John Edwards and John Kerry. For most of 2003, Howard Dean had been the apparent front-runner for the nomination, performing strongly in most polls and leading the pack in fund-raising. However, Kerry won the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, which gave him enough momentum to carry the majority of the rest of the states.

===Election issues===
According to exit polls taking during the Iowa Caucuses, the top 4 issues were ranked as follows:

# Economy/Jobs (29% of Respondents)
# Health Care/Medicine (28% of Respondents)
# The war in Iraq (14% of Respondents)
# Education (14% of Respondents)

====Economy====
Despite being characterized by many as an election on Iraq, the economy and jobs were repeatedly cited as voters&#x27; top or one of top three concerns during the course of the primary season. In Iowa, of those who cited the economy as their most important issue, 34% supported Kerry, while 33% supported Edwards, with Dean trailing at 16% and Gephardt at 12%.

Eventual nominee John Kerry, much like other Democrats adopted policy stances of tax-cuts for the middle class, increased spending for Social Security, and assisting small businesses. On the aspect of job creation, Kerry strongly supported the creation and safety of infrastructure-related jobs, like those in the railroad industry. During the course of the primary Kerry continued to advocate positions such as fiscal responsibility and end state fiscal crises by giving states increased fiscal aid.

Runner up John Edwards ran a position of support for the middle class as well as budget caps and enforcement. Strongly opposing Social Security privatization, and interested in middle class tax cuts, Edwards&#x27;s main economic theme was support for the middle class touting his own struggle, growing up the son of a poor mill worker in South Carolina. Another major component of Edwards&#x27;s message was to be able to reinstate fiscal responsibility.

Howard Dean, despite taking many of the same positions of his rivals including Edwards and Kerry, had a starkly different approach on the issue of Social Security and tax cuts. On taxes, Dean favored repealing the Bush Tax cuts not only for the wealthiest of Americans as Senator Edwards and Senator Kerry proposed, but for all, including middle and lower classes.

==== Iraq War ====
After the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration argued that the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had now become urgent. Over the course of several months, Bush presented several premises for war, but the turning point was the allegation that Saddam&#x27;s regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have possessed, potential weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in violation of U.N. sanctions. This
situation escalated to the point that the United States assembled a group of about forty nations, including the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, and Poland, which Bush called the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot;, to invade Iraq without UN authorization.

The coalition invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003. Most contenders for the nomination were supportive of the effort. Only Dean and Kucinich firmly questioned the aims and tactics of the administration, setting themselves apart in the eyes of war protesters. John Kerry, who had voted in favor of coalition invasion, said Bush had “failed miserably” in building that coalition and that &quot;We need a regime change not just in Iraq. We need a regime change here in the United States.&quot; Republicans criticized Kerry for speaking out against a wartime president.

The invasion was swift, with the collapse of the Iraq government and the military of Iraq in about three weeks. The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly secured with limited damage in that time. On May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of major combat in the Iraq war. Clearly visible in the background was a banner stating &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;. Bush&#x27;s landing was criticized by opponents as being overly theatrical and expensive. The banner, made by White House personnel (according to a CNN story:) and placed there by the U.S. Navy, was criticized as premature. Nonetheless, Bush&#x27;s approval rating in the month of May rode at 66%, according to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll.

On May 3, 2003, Democrats met at the University of South Carolina in the first formal debate between the nine challengers for the nomination. The candidates disagreed on the war against Iraq, health insurance, President Bush&#x27;s tax cuts, but united in criticizing Bush&#x27;s handling of the economy.

=== Dean emerges as front-runner ===

On May 31, 2002, Vermont governor Howard Dean formed a presidential exploratory committee. Though this was almost two years before the Iowa Caucus, Dean hoped the early start would give him some much needed name recognition. As a governor of a small state, Dean was not well known outside of New England.

In December of that year, John F. Kerry, U.S. senator from Massachusetts, announced on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot; his plans to form an exploratory committee for a possible 2004 presidential run, anticipating a formal announcement &quot;down the road some months&quot;. Kerry&#x27;s experience as a decorated Vietnam veteran generated some excitement among Democrats tired of being on the defensive about their candidates&#x27; suitability in the role of &quot;commander in chief&quot;.

Two weeks later, former vice president and 2000 Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore announced on the CBS program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that he would not seek election to the presidency in 2004. Gore had recently wrapped up a nationwide book tour and had been widely expected to run.

Other potential candidates were likely waiting to see what Gore&#x27;s plans were, and thus the floodgates opened in January 2003. Senator Joseph Lieberman, Gore&#x27;s 2000 vice presidential running mate, had previously promised not to run should Gore seek their party&#x27;s nomination and was willing to be Gore&#x27;s running mate again. Freed from that obligation, Lieberman announced his intention to run. Additionally, many other candidates announced their intention to form committees (a formality usually indicating an official run): U.S. Sen. John R. Edwards of North Carolina, U.S. Rep. Richard A. &quot;Dick&quot; Gephardt of Missouri, and Reverend Al Sharpton of New York. In February, more candidates announced their intentions: former Senator from Illinois Carol Moseley Braun, U.S. Representative from Ohio Dennis Kucinich, and Senator Bob Graham of Florida.

There were other potential candidates for whom some speculation was buzzing about a potential run. These candidates felt it necessary to officially state that they would not seek the party nomination. These included United States Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, and former U.S. Senator Gary Hart from Colorado.

In April, Democratic fund-raising totals for the first quarter of 2003 were reported. John Edwards raised $7.4 million, John Kerry raised $7.0 million, Dick Gephardt raised $3.5 million, Joe Lieberman raised $3.0 million, Howard Dean raised $2.6 million, Bob Graham raised $1.1 million, and Dennis Kucinich and Carol Moseley Braun raised less than $1 million each.

In June 2003, Howard Dean aired the first television advertising of the 2004 campaign, spending more than $300,000. During that time, he formally announced his run for president, filing to form a presidential election campaign with the FEC. Later that month, liberal advocacy website MoveOn held the first ever online Democratic &quot;primary&quot;, which lasted just over 48 hours. It was an unofficial and nonbinding affair, but with important symbolic and financial value. Of 317,647 votes, Howard Dean received 44%, Dennis Kucinich 24%, and John Kerry 16%. Had any candidate received 50% of the vote, the candidate would have received MoveOn&#x27;s endorsement and financial support. Instead, MoveOn supported all the candidates.

In July, the Democratic fund-raising numbers for the second quarter of 2003 were reported and announced. Howard Dean surprised many raising $7.5 million, John Kerry raised $6 million, while John Edwards and Joseph Lieberman raised roughly $5 million each. Dean&#x27;s strength as a fund-raiser was attributed mainly to his innovative embrace of the Internet for campaigning. The majority of his donations came from individual Dean supporters, who came to be known as &quot;Deanites&quot;, or, more commonly, &quot;Deaniacs&quot;. His campaign&#x27;s innovative use of the Internet helped to build a strongly supportive grassroots constituency, much of which remained intensely loyal to him long after the end of his candidacy.

By autumn of 2003, Dean had become the apparent front-runner for the Democratic nomination, performing strongly in most polls. Generally regarded as a pragmatic centrist during his time as governor, Dean emerged during his presidential campaign as something of a populist, denouncing the policies of the Bush administration (especially the 2003 invasion of Iraq) as well as fellow Democrats, who, in his view, failed to strongly oppose them.

During his presidential campaign, critics on the right labeled Dean&#x27;s political views as those of an extreme liberal; however, in liberal Vermont, Dean, long known as a staunch advocate of fiscal restraint, was regarded as a moderate. Many critics on the left, who supported fellow Democrat Dennis Kucinich or independent Ralph Nader, charged that, at heart, Dean was a &quot;Rockefeller Republican&quot;—socially liberal, while fiscally conservative.

=== Wesley Clark enters ===
Over the summer of 2003, several organized groups began a nationwide campaign to &quot;draft&quot; retired four-star general Wesley Clark for the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for the 2004 presidential election. CNN on August 13 showed a commercial by one of these groups and interviewed Clark. He disavowed any connection with the &quot;draft Clark&quot; groups, but said he had been considering his position and that within a few weeks he would likely make public his decision on whether to
run. He also fueled speculation with a television interview in which he first declared himself a Democrat.

On September 17, 2003, in Little Rock, Arkansas, Clark announced his intention to run in the presidential primary election for the Democratic Party nomination, becoming the tenth and last Democrat to do so (coming many months after the others): &quot;My name is Wes Clark. I am from Little Rock, Arkansas, and I am here to announce that I intend to seek the presidency of the United States of America.&quot; He said, &quot;We&#x27;re going to run a campaign that will move this country forward, not back.&quot;

His campaign focused on themes of leadership and patriotism; early campaign ads relied heavily on biography. His late start left him with relatively few detailed policy proposals. This weakness was apparent in his first few debates, although he soon presented a range of position papers, including a major tax-relief plan. Nevertheless, many Democrats flocked to his campaign. They were drawn by his military background, and saw such foreign policy credentials as a valuable asset in challenging George W. Bush post-September 11. Advisors and supporters portrayed him as more electable than Howard Dean, who was still the front-runner for the party&#x27;s nomination. Despite the burst of enthusiasm for Clark in late 2003, Dean maintained a strong lead in the polls for the latter half of the year. Clark won the Democratic Presidential Primary in Oklahoma, the only state carried by Clark in the primary election.

Criticism of Clark began almost the moment he entered the race. Originally heralded as an antiwar general, he stumbled in the first few days of his candidacy. He was perceived as changing his answer on how he would have voted on the Iraq war resolution. His supporters argued that his perceived indecision was due to lack of experience with the media and their insistence on short &quot;sound bite&quot; answers.

=== Iowa and New Hampshire ===
Throughout the early campaigning season, the Iowa caucuses appeared to be a two-way contest between former Vermont Governor Howard Dean and Missouri Representative Richard Gephardt. Dean, the national front runner, had been able to pour money into Iowa and New Hampshire. In total, Dean spent nearly $40 million in the two states. Gephardt, coming from neighboring Missouri, won the state&#x27;s caucus in 1988 when he first ran for the party nomination.

However, days before the Iowa caucuses were held, negative campaigning by Dean and Gephardt took a late toll on the two campaigns in Iowa as well as nationally. This, along with the resurgence of John Kerry and the emergence of John Edwards as major contenders in Iowa, put the Gephardt and Dean campaigns on edge.

A poll released by the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; days before the caucus was held showed Dean and Gephardt had lost all of their lead in Iowa. In the poll, Kerry led with 26% of those surveyed, Edwards came in second with 23%, Dean came in third with 20%, and Gephardt came in fourth with 18%.

On caucus night, as results were being tallied, it became evident that Kerry and Edwards were in a battle for first and Dean and Gephardt were in a battle for third.
After all votes were tallied, John Kerry received 38% of the delegates, John Edwards received 32%, Howard Dean received 18%, and Richard Gephardt received 11%.

After his poor showing, Gephardt dropped out of the race. Kerry and Edwards claimed newfound momentum, while Dean attempted to downplay the results, which resulted into his infamous Dean scream.

In the New Hampshire primary, Kerry was able to defeat Howard Dean once again, beating him 38%-26%. The final debate before the primary was held at Saint Anselm College; Kerry&#x27;s performance was superior to the others, helping him win the primary a few days later. Kerry carried nearly all constituencies during the primary according to exit polling data. Clark came in third with 12%, Edwards fourth with 12%, and Lieberman fifth with 9%.

After Kerry&#x27;s wins, he received attention for using the phrase &quot;Bring it on!&quot; during his speeches before and after the contests in response to potential attacks on his candidacy.

=== Mini Tuesday, Super Tuesday and later primaries ===

Edwards&#x27;s late stage momentum, as well as his departure from the negative campaigning which characterized other leading candidates, carried him into a surprising second-place finish in Iowa with the support of 32% of caucus delegates, behind only John Kerry&#x27;s 38% and ahead of former front-runner Howard Dean at 18%. He finished with 12% in the New Hampshire primary one week later, essentially tied for third-place position with retired general Wesley Clark. The following week, dubbed Mini Tuesday, Edwards won in South Carolina and nearly beat Clark in Oklahoma. However, Kerry won five primaries in various regions of the country to reinforce his status as frontrunner.
After Dean&#x27;s withdrawal from the contest, Edwards became the only major challenger to Kerry for the nomination. However, Kerry continued to dominate, taking in wins in Michigan, Washington, Maine, Tennessee, Washington, D.C., Nevada, Wisconsin, Utah, Hawaii and Idaho. Remarking on an unexpectedly strong finish in Wisconsin on February 17, Edwards humorously cautioned Kerry: &quot;Objects in your mirror may be closer than they appear.&quot; At this point, only Kerry, Edwards, Sharpton and Kucinich remained in the running. Dean, while not officially running, did not release his delegates, and still put in a strong showing considering that he was no longer mounting an official campaign.

Edwards maintained a positive campaign and largely avoided attacking Kerry until a February 29, 2004, debate in New York City, where he attempted to put Kerry on the defensive by characterizing the front-runner as a &quot;Washington insider&quot; and by mocking Kerry&#x27;s plan to form a committee to examine trade agreements.

In Super Tuesday, March 2, Kerry won decisive victories in the California, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio and Rhode Island primaries and the Minnesota caucuses. Dean, despite having withdrawn from the race two weeks earlier, won his home state of Vermont. Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry in Georgia but, failing to win a single state, chose to withdraw, making Kerry the presumptive nominee. President Bush called Senator Kerry to congratulate him that evening.

On March 11, after meetings with Democratic superdelegates in Washington, D.C., and former primary election opponents, Kerry accumulated the 2,162 delegates required to clinch the nomination. The DNC&#x27;s website acknowledged him as the party&#x27;s nominee at that time, four and a half months prior to the Convention.

=== Nomination ===

On July 6, John Kerry selected John Edwards as his running mate shortly before the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, Massachusetts, held later that month. Senators Kerry and Edwards were formally nominated by the Democratic Party at the convention. The Kerry/Edwards ticket was on the ballot in all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia. In New York, the ticket was also on the ballot as candidates of the Working Families Party.

New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson served as chairman of the convention while former presidential advisor to Bill Clinton Lottie Shackelford served as vice chairman. Defining moments of the 2004 Democratic National Convention included the featured keynote speech of Barack Obama, a Honolulu native and candidate for the United States Senate from Illinois, Bill Clinton&#x27;s opening night speech and the confirmation of the nomination of John Kerry as the candidate for president and of John Edwards as the candidate for vice president. Kerry made his Vietnam War experience a prominent theme. In accepting the nomination, he began his speech with &quot;I&#x27;m John Kerry and I&#x27;m reporting for duty.&quot;

Kerry and Edwards faced incumbents George W. Bush and Dick Cheney of the Republican Party in the 2004 presidential election. Following his official nomination at the convention, Kerry received only a small bounce in the polls and remained &quot;neck and neck&quot; with Bush. This was the first time in recent political history that a candidate failed to receive a substantial boost in post-convention poll numbers. Some political pundits attributed this small boost to the unusually small number of undecided voters as compared with previous presidential elections.

The general election was won by Bush, who defeated Kerry. The election was fought primarily on the issue of the conduct of the War on Terror. Bush defended the actions of his administration, while Kerry contended that the war had been fought incompetently, and that the Iraq War was a distraction from the War on Terror, not a part of it.

===Statewide===
Notes:
:¹ Total delegate count includes superdelegates, delegates not assigned directly from primary or caucus results. State delegate counts include only those delegates assigned as a result of the state primary or caucus.
:² January 14 was a non-binding primary (no delegates apportioned). Ten of the District of Columbia&#x27;s pledged delegates were awarded at ward-level caucuses on February 14; the other six were awarded based on the February 14 results in a convention on March 6.
:³ Only local delegates were selected at the Iowa and Idaho caucuses. National delegates were selected later.
:4 These figures are based on correctly rounded percentages based on complete counts directly from the state parties and from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. These figures differ slightly from those reported in most major media outlets (including some linked at the bottom of the page), where percentages have been slightly mis-stated for some candidates in some elections (either by applying inconsistent rounding or by inconsistently excluding minor candidates or candidates who had dropped out).
:5 Expatriate Democrats, represented the Democrats Abroad organization, held their 2004 caucus on April 7 in Edinburgh, Scotland.

=== Counties carried ===








===Nationwide===
There were 4,353 total delegates to the 2004 Democratic National Convention, of which 802 were superdelegates: party leaders, even including some of the candidates, who were not bound by any state&#x27;s primary or caucus votes and could change their support at any time. A candidate needed 2,162 delegates to become the nominee. Except for the Northern Mariana Islands and Midway Atoll, all states, territories, and other inhabited areas of the United States offered delegates to the 2004 Democratic National Convention. John Kerry won 4,255 votes at the convention, including those won by all of his former rivals except Dennis Kucinich, who received 37 votes. There were 26 abstentions.

<text>The Battle of Arkansas Post, also known as the Battle of Fort Hindman, was fought from January 9 to 11, 1863, along the Arkansas River at Arkansas Post, Arkansas, as part of the Vicksburg campaign of the American Civil War. Confederate forces constructed Fort Hindman near Arkansas Post in late 1862. Also in late 1862, Major General John A. McClernand of the Union Army was authorized to recruit troops in the midwest in preparation for an expedition down the Mississippi River against Vicksburg, Mississippi. Union Major General Ulysses S. Grant began an overland campaign against Vicksburg along the Mississippi Central Railroad in November. Grant and Union General-in-chief Henry Halleck did not trust McClernand, and through machinations placed the start of the riverine movement against Vicksburg under the command of Major General William T. Sherman before McClernand could arrive. Sherman&#x27;s movement was defeated in the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou in late December, and Confederate cavalry raids forced Grant to abandon his overland campaign.

McClernand arrived at Memphis, Tennessee, in late December and found that Sherman had left without him. McClernand moved downriver, joined Sherman&#x27;s force, and took command in early January 1863, calling it the Army of the Mississippi. Both Sherman and McClernand had independently come to the conclusion that Arkansas Post should be attacked. David Dixon Porter&#x27;s Union Navy fleet and McClernand&#x27;s troops moved upriver towards the Arkansas River, but entered the White River first as a diversion. After moving through a cutoff into the Arkansas River, the expedition began unloading troops downriver from the fort late on January 9. The next day, some of Porter&#x27;s warships bombarded the fort, while McClernand&#x27;s troops maneuvered into position. At 1:00 pm on January 11, Porter&#x27;s warships began another bombardment of the fort, and McClernand&#x27;s troops attacked the Confederate positions, which consisted of the fort and a line of rifle pits that extended west to a bayou.

McClernand&#x27;s attack was repulsed, but white flags of surrender began to appear over parts of the Confederate line in uncertain circumstances. Confusion ensued, and Union troops moved up close to and swamped parts of the Confederate line. The Confederate commander, Brigadier General Thomas J. Churchill, agreed to surrender. When Grant learned of the operation against Arkansas Post, he disapproved and ordered McClernand back to the Mississippi River, although Grant was later convinced of the wisdom of the operation. Grant relieved McClernand of command of the operations against Vicksburg on January 30 and took command of the campaign personally. In April and May, Grant&#x27;s army crossed the Mississippi River downriver from Vicksburg and won a series of battles. The Confederate forces withdrew into the Vicksburg defenses in mid-May. The Siege of Vicksburg ended with a Confederate surrender on July 4, 1863; this was a key event in the outcome of the war.

==Background==
===Initial Union plans and operations===
Early in the American Civil War, the Union military leadership developed the Anaconda Plan, which was a strategy to defeat the Confederate States of America by controlling its coastline and major rivers. A significant component of this strategy was controlling the Mississippi River. Much of the Mississippi Valley fell under Union control in early 1862 after the capture of New Orleans, Louisiana, and several land victories. The strategically important city of Vicksburg, Mississippi, was still in Confederate hands, and it served as a strong defensive position that commanded the river and prevented the Union from separating the two halves of the Confederacy. Union Navy elements were sent upriver from New Orleans in May to try to take the city, a move that was unsuccessful. In late June, a joint army–navy expedition returned to make another campaign against Vicksburg. Union Navy leadership decided that the city could not be taken without more infantry, who were not forthcoming. An attempt to construct Williams&#x27;s Canal across a meander of the river in June and July, bypassing Vicksburg, failed.

On November 26, Union Major General Ulysses S. Grant began an overland movement through the state of Mississippi down the Mississippi Central Railroad with 40,000 men in an campaign to capture Vicksburg. In September, Major General John A. McClernand had discussed with President Abraham Lincoln about a campaign down the Mississippi River to take control of the river, as McClernand (a former politician turned military officer) believed that Confederate control of the river was dampening support for the war in the Old Northwest. Despite some hesitancy from high ranking Union military and political figures about McClernand&#x27;s suitability for an independent command, an arrangement was reached where McClernand was permitted to recruit soldiers in the midwest and then take this force downriver to operate against Vicksburg, Mississippi. McClernand received secret orders regarding the expedition on October 21. These orders gave McClernand a theoretically independent command operating in the military department commanded by Grant, and McClernand believed his command to be independent. Instead, the ambiguous wording of the order actually gave General-in-chief Henry Halleck the ability to redirect the troops McClernand raised for other purposes, and the orders also included the language that McClernand&#x27;s operation could proceed &quot;when a sufficient force not required by the operations of General Grant&#x27;s command shall be raised&quot;. In effect, both Halleck and Grant had the power to override McClernand&#x27;s campaign.

Halleck, who distrusted McClernand, used this language in the official orders to undercut McClernand. Halleck transferred McClernand&#x27;s newly recruited troops to Memphis, Tennessee, or Helena, Arkansas, as they entered service. On December 5, Halleck suggested to Grant a naval operation down the Mississippi River against Vicksburg, using a portion of Grant&#x27;s force. At that time, Grant was also growing concerned about the length of his supply line in Mississippi, as well as the condition of the roads that further movement by his column would be using. Halleck had informed him that the downriver movement had the support of the president, and Grant assumed that McClernand, who Grant had a low opinion of, would command the movement. Grant decided to take control of McClernand&#x27;s accumulated troops, and placed them under the command of Major General William T. Sherman, who was to lead them on a riverine expedition down the Mississippi River to Vicksburg. Sherman had command of over 30,000 men, drawn from Memphis and Helena, and from one division Sherman took from Grant&#x27;s main column. After Sherman reached Memphis on December 12, Halleck informed Grant that his army was to be split into four corps, and that McClernand was to command the movement downriver. Grant, in turn, knowing that Sherman was expected to begin the expedition in a matter of days, sent McClernand a letter (intentionally eschewing faster telegraph service) authorizing him to take command of the force moving downriver. This message was not received because of Confederate cavalry raids in western Tennessee.

Acting Rear Admiral David D. Porter was in command of the Union Navy portion of the riverine movement towards Vicksburg. Sherman&#x27;s men left Memphis on December 20. McClernand was still in Illinois and the movement he had intended to command left without him. McClernand received communication from Halleck on December 21 confirming that he was intended to command the downriver expedition, but he believed that he was required to remain in Illinois according to his orders. Telegraphic communications with United States Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, who was not aware of Halleck&#x27;s machinations against McClernand, cleared up the confusion. After getting married on December 26, McClernand continued downriver and reached Memphis on December 28, where he learned that Sherman had left without him. Communications with Grant resulted in McClernand receiving orders the next day to command the downriver expedition.

The same day that Sherman left, Confederate cavalry raids destroyed Grant&#x27;s supply lines, and he was forced to retreat. Sherman&#x27;s operation, which contained over 30,000 men, reached the Vicksburg area on Christmas Eve, and sailed up the Yazoo River. After landing on December 26 and 27, the Union soldiers made a frontal attack against Confederate defenses at Chickasaw Bayou on December 29, but were repulsed with heavy losses in the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou. Defeated, Sherman&#x27;s men re-boarded their ships on January 1, 1863, and withdrew from the battlefield.

===Confederate preparations===

Control of the Arkansas River Valley was vital for the Confederate defense of Arkansas and the Indian Territory. As late as September 1862, Confederate defenses on the Arkansas and White rivers were minimal. On September 28, Colonel John W. Dunnington, a former officer in the Confederate States Navy, was appointed commander of river defenses within the state. Dunnington selected a location for a fortification on the Arkansas River near the settlement of Arkansas Post. The fort was located north of the village, at a point commanding the river on a hairpin curve.

Known by both the names Fort Hindman and the Post of Arkansas, the fortification was square-shaped, with sides long, surrounded by a ditch that was wide and deep. Behind it was the parapet, behind which was a firing step. The fort had four bastions, each of which had emplacements for three cannons; another cannon was on the north side curtain wall of the fortification. The southern side of the northeastern bastion included a by casemate, one side of which was the parapet wall. Its walls and roof were composed of three layers of timber; the roof was additionally protected by iron sheets nearly thick. To cover the river approaches to the fort, a Columbiad cannon was position in the northeastern bastion&#x27;s casemate, and another in the southeastern bastion. An Columbiad was mounted in another casement in the fort&#x27;s southern curtain wall, which overlooked the river. Eight other cannonsfour 10-pounder Parrott rifles and two 6-pounder smoothbore cannonswere distributed among the bastions. Three buildings, two magazines, and a well were located in the fort. The columbiads were originally from the ram CSS &quot;Pontchartrain&quot;. From the northwest bastion, a line of rifle pits ran west to Post Bayou. The position was strengthened by obstructions placed in the river. Construction on another line of rifle pits downriver from the fort was begun, with another tier of rifle pits between the outer line and the fort. Many of the men assigned to defend the fort were concerned that it was poorly sited. In November, Union troops from Helena attempted to raid the fort site, but the attempt was foiled by flooding along the riverbanks. On December 10, Brigadier General Thomas J. Churchill was appointed to command the post.

==Prelude==
When Sherman reached the Mississippi from the Yazoo, he met McClernand, who was upset about being sidestepped in command of the river expedition. After a discussion between the two officers, McClernand took command of the force, naming it the Army of the Mississippi, with Sherman becoming a subordinate commander in the army. Sherman did not approve of McClernand&#x27;s appointment to command and in a letter to his wife stated that Lincoln &quot;will get his fill before he is done&quot;. In late December, Confederate troops had captured the Union supply steamer &quot;Blue Wing&quot; downriver from Napoleon, Arkansas, and sent it back to Arkansas Post. Sherman heard of the raid, and believed that more raids from the position at Arkansas Post were likely. Viewing Arkansas Post as a threat and believing that a victory would restore his men&#x27;s broken morale, Sherman began planning a movement against the Confederate position. He believed the fort could be easily captured from its land-facing side.

On December 30, while traveling downriver from Memphis to join the expedition against Vicksburg, McClernand met with Brigadier General Willis Gorman at Helena. McClernand and Gorman discussed the military situation at Helena, which had been stripped of troops for Sherman&#x27;s operation, and the Confederate presence at Arkansas Post. Sherman and McClernand had separately come to the conclusion that the Confederate position at Arkansas Post should be reduced. Separately, McClernand had also decided on a movement on Arkansas Post. On the night of January 3/4, the two officers went to speak with Porter about using his naval vessels in the movement. Porter disliked McClernand and his treatment of Sherman, but agreed to the movement for Sherman. Writing about Sherman&#x27;s support for the plan, Richard L. Kiper wrote that his motives were &quot;somewhat suspect&quot; and likely based on desiring a victory to restore the damage his reputation had taken from Chickasaw Bayou. McClernand informed Union Major General Samuel R. Curtis of the plan, as the operation would occur within Curtis&#x27;s area of command.

During this time, McClernand believed he was an army commander, while he really only held a corps command under Grant. On January 4, McClernand organized his command into two corps. Sherman commanded the Second Corps, while the First Corps was under Brigadier General George W. Morgan, whom Sherman blamed for the defeat at Chickasaw Bayou. Morgan&#x27;s corps had been officially designated as the XIII Corps and Sherman&#x27;s as the XV Corps by orders of December 18, but they were not organized as such at the time of McClernand&#x27;s reorganization. Both corps had two divisions: the XIII Corps had those of Brigadier Generals Andrew J. Smith and Peter J. Osterhaus, while the XV Corps&#x27;s two were commanded by Brigadier Generals Frederick Steele and David Stuart. Meanwhile, Churchill had about 5,000 Confederates at Arkansas Post. These men were largely dismounted cavalrymen from Arkansas and Texas, although only about 3,000 were healthy enough to fight due to outbreaks of disease. Most were armed with short-range carbines and shotguns as opposed to longer-range rifles. Churchill&#x27;s command was divided into three brigades, commanded by Colonels Dunnington, Robert Garland, and James Deshler.

==Battle==
===January 9 and 10===
McClernand&#x27;s force consisted of about 30,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry as well as 40 cannons, for a total strength of 31,753. The army began moving upriver on January 5. In order to keep the element of surprise, the Union fleet entered the White River instead of the Arkansas, before using a connecting cutoff between the two rivers to move back into the Arkansas. The infantrymen were moved on transport vessels, with warships in support. Three of the supporting warships were ironclads: USS &quot;Baron DeKalb&quot;, USS &quot;Louisville&quot;, and USS &quot;Cincinnati&quot;. On the afternoon of January 9, Churchill was informed of the approaching Union fleet. Sending out his small cavalry force as scouts, he ordered his men to defend the outer set of rifle pits, which were still incomplete. As it was believed that the Union troops already heavily occupied the area of the lower rifle pits, the orders were changed to hold the inner line of rifle pits, closer to the fort. A force of Texans from Garland&#x27;s brigade was sent forward as skirmishers, and the six cannons of Hart&#x27;s Arkansas Battery were positioned on the right flank of the line of rifle pits, near the river.

Beginning at 4:00 pm or 5:00 pm on January 9, Sherman&#x27;s men were offloaded from their transports about from Arkansas Post, at the Notrebe plantation. As not all of the transports arrived before nightfall, part of Sherman&#x27;s troops could not be landed until the next morning; Sherman&#x27;s men finished the landing process by 11:00 am on January 10. That evening, Porter learned of the obstructions placed in the river from an individual in a boat in the river who was picked up by the Union troops. Morgan&#x27;s transports halted at a landing on the opposite side of the river, downriver from Notrebe&#x27;s, to offload Colonel Daniel Lindsey&#x27;s brigade. On the morning on January 10, Lindsey&#x27;s troops landed ashore, along with some 10-pounder Parrott rifles from the Chicago Mercantile Battery. These troops used a road to move across the base of the peninsula formed by the curve in the river, and took up a position upstream from the fort to prevent the Confederates from reinforcing the fort via the river.

McClernand and his staff went ashore early on January 10 to conduct a reconnaissance of the river road. At 8:00 that morning, the gunboat USS &quot;Black Hawk&quot; and the tinclad USS &quot;Rattler&quot; moved upstream and bombarded the Confederate rifle pits. Churchill ordered Hart&#x27;s battery to hold its fire, thinking the three heavy guns at the fort could handle the Union vessels, but issues with bad gunpowder prevented the guns in the fort from firing far enough to hit &quot;Black Hawk&quot; and &quot;Rattler&quot;. McClernand ordered Sherman to move to the northwest and try to get around the Confederate fort and into its rear, but he later decided that the river road was also a feasible approach route. Sherman and Steele&#x27;s division began the movement around the fort, guided by escaped slaves, while Stuart&#x27;s division advanced directly along the river road. At around 1:00 pm, the rest of Morgan&#x27;s corps landed on the same side of the river as Sherman&#x27;s men, at a place known as Muldin&#x27;s below Notrebe&#x27;s. Steele&#x27;s flanking column was blocked by swampy ground and a bayou, and the division was withdrawn to rejoin Stuart. The flanking column returned to Notrebe&#x27;s around the same time that Morgan&#x27;s corps reached it.

Around 2 p.m., Churchill learned of Sherman&#x27;s flanking maneuver and decided to withdraw his forces from the rifle pits. The Confederate rear guard was formed from the previously-deployed skirmishers and a portion of the 10th Texas Infantry Regiment. Colonel Giles Smith&#x27;s brigade of Stuart&#x27;s division pushed forward after the Confederates, led by two Missouri regiments as skirmishers. The two Union regiments pushed forward until they came under fire from the fort. After a reconnaissance, Stuart shifted his line to the right, so that it ran from the river to the Little Rock road. Two regiments from Colonel T. Kilby Smith&#x27;s brigade were sent to support Stuart&#x27;s skirmishers; the skirmishers approached the fort and came under heavy fire which resulted in seventeen casualties. The 57th Ohio Infantry Regiment was sent to the right to scout the area around Post Bayou.

Morgan&#x27;s men advanced with A. J. Smith&#x27;s division in the front and Osterhaus&#x27;s to the rear. While Stuart&#x27;s men shifted right, A. J. Smith&#x27;s filled in the space to the left by the river. McClernand had told Porter that his men would be ready to attack at 2 pm. At 5:30 pm., McClernand told Porter that his men were finally ready, and the Union vessels advanced towards the fort to bombard it. The three ironclads moved in to close range and were each assigned one of the heavy Confederate guns. The timberclad &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Black Hawk&quot; provided supporting fire. The shooting from the naval vessels killed most of the horses within the Confederate position, but there were few human casualties. The bombardment ceased at around 7:30 pm. Porter tried to slip &quot;Rattler&quot; upriver to bombard the fort from behind, but the tinclad came under heavy fire. &quot;Rattler&quot; also fouled on the obstructions in the river, and withdrew back to the main fleet, having been damaged. The Confederate batteries had been silenced, but it was too dark to accomplish anything further and McClernand did not attack. &quot;Baron DeKalb&quot; suffered seventeen casualties, with another eleven on &quot;Louisville&quot;.

Churchill was informed by Lieutenant General Theophilus Holmes that he was expected to &quot;hold out till help arrived or all dead&quot;. Holmes vacillated and originally denied reinforcements, but then stated that he would send some. On January 9, Churchill had sent a message to the commander of the Confederate garrison at St. Charles requesting reinforcements. This request resulted in a company of Texans reaching the Confederate position on the night of January 10. Further reinforcements were on their way in the form of nearly 200 men from the 24th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. Churchill made his troops dispositions to receive the expected Union attack. The fort itself was defended by a portion of the 19th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, a battalion of Arkansas infantry, and a detachment of sailors from &quot;Pontchartrain&quot;, all under the command of Dunnington. The rifle pits from the fort to Post Bayou were defended by the rest of the 19th Arkansas Infantry on the right, then Garland&#x27;s brigade, and Deshler&#x27;s on the left. A gap remained between Deshler&#x27;s line and Post Bayou. The Confederates spent the night strengthening their defenses, and Deshler ordered the razing of huts in front of his line that had previously been used as housing by Confederate troops. Churchill spoke to his men, and told them &quot;gentlemen, the fight will commence in a very short time, and we must win it or die in the ditches&quot;. Earlier in the day, McClernand had sent a detachment of Illinois cavalry to scout the Post Bayou area. In response to the information from the scouting party, McClernand order Steele&#x27;s division moved from its camp in the Union rear to form on the right of Stuart&#x27;s line.

===January 11===

On the morning of January 11, Steele ordered Brigadier General Charles E. Hovey to advance his brigade. This threatened the gap between Deshler&#x27;s flank and the bayou, so Deshler drew detachments from all of his regiments and arrayed the combined detachments as a unit of skirmishers in the gap. In response to the movement, Churchill ordered about 120 soldiers to guard the line of the bayou from Deshler&#x27;s left down to the Arkansas River. He also pulled troops from the right of the rifle pits line to support Deshler, and sent four guns from Hart&#x27;s battery to Deshler as well. Further positional adjustments were made by Sherman&#x27;s corps that morning. One of Steele&#x27;s brigades, commanded by Brigadier General John M. Thayer. Brigadier General Francis P. Blair Jr.&#x27;s brigade had taken heavy casualties at Chickasaw Bayou and was held in reserve. Stuart advanced Giles Smith&#x27;s brigade to the left of Thayer&#x27;s brigade, with T. Kilby Smith&#x27;s brigade to the rear.

When these dispositions had been made, Sherman informed McClernand that his troops were ready for the assault. However, there were delays in getting Morgan&#x27;s lines established and for the navy to finish its preparations. A. J. Smith deployed Brigadier General Stephen G. Burbridge&#x27;s brigade in two lines to the left of Stuart&#x27;s division, while Colonel William J. Landrams&#x27;s brigade was deployed in three lines to the left and rear of Burbridge. The decision to deploy only one brigade on the front line was necessitated by a lack of space. Between Landram&#x27;s brigade and the river was the brigade of Colonel Lionel A. Sheldon, from Osterhaus&#x27;s division. This was the only one of Osterhaus&#x27;s brigades in line, as one brigade had been left to guard the transports and Lindsey was on the other side of the river. Porter&#x27;s warships were to open fire on the Confederates as the signal for the attack, which would be followed by a bombardment by Sherman&#x27;s artillery. Once Sherman&#x27;s guns ceased firing, the assault was to begin. At 1 pm, Porter&#x27;s ships moved towards the fort to again bombard it. Porter had ordered the sides of his ships to be coated in &quot;tallow or slush&quot; to help deflect cannon shots.
The three Union ironclads, supported by &quot;Lexington&quot;, &quot;Rattler&quot;, and the tinclad USS &quot;Glide&quot;, fired from the river, while the Union cannons on land joined in as well. From across the river, the two guns of the Chicago Mercantile Battery opened fire, along with two 20-pounder Parrott rifles from the 1st Wisconsin Battery that had been sent to join Lindsey the day before. &quot;Cincinnati&quot; fired 100 shots, &quot;Louisville&quot; 212, and &quot;Baron DeKalb&quot; 158, with the latter ironclad being the most effective. The fire silenced all of the Confederate guns in the fort except for the one facing the land side. Porter then sent &quot;Rattler&quot;, &quot;Glide&quot;, and the ram USS &quot;Monarch&quot; upriver past the fort to cut off the Confederates&#x27; path of retreat. &quot;Monarch&quot; was stopped by low water, but the two tinclads were able to continue further and destroy a ferry. The Union land artillery had orders to fire for thirty minutes after the naval bombardment opened, which was to be followed by an infantry attack three minutes after a thirty-minute firing interval. When the infantry attack began, the men were ordered to yell loudly, so that the naval vessels would hear the noise and know to shift their fire to prevent friendly fire. Morgan could observe the progress of the gunboats, while Sherman had to judge by sound. With the Confederates not firing in response to his cannonade, Sherman cut his cannon fire off early and sent his infantry in for the assault. The historian Timothy B. Smith estimates that Sherman&#x27;s guns only fired for about fifteen minutes.

When Hovey&#x27;s brigade attacked, it came under fire from Confederates on the other side of Post Bayou. To counter this threat, the 17th Missouri Infantry Regiment was aligned along Post Bayou. Fire from Deshler&#x27;s Confederates and two 10-pounder Parrott rifles from Hart&#x27;s battery halted the Union attack until the 76th Ohio Infantry Regiment moved up and drove the Confederate cannon crews off. Hovey suffered an arm wound but remained on the field. To the left, Thayer&#x27;s brigade was repulsed by the 10th Texas Infantry. Hovey in turn had two regiments attack, but they were also repulsed. Deshler sent a portion of the 19th Arkansas to support the Texans, but a gap still remained between the Texans and the Arkansans. The transfer of the 19th Arkansas required Garland to stretch his line to fill the space formerly occupied by the Arkansans. Two further attacks by the two regiments Hovey had deployed were repulsed. In Stuart&#x27;s sector, Giles Smith&#x27;s brigade came under heavy enfilade fire from Hart&#x27;s battery, and men had to crawl forward to a wooded position to fire into the battery and silence it. T. Kilby Smith&#x27;s brigade aligned on Giles Smith&#x27;s left and two artillery batteries were brought forward. The two brigades were then held in preparation for a general storming of the Confederate works. To counter the attacks against his line, Deshler requested reinforcements, and was granted parts of three Texas cavalry units from Garland&#x27;s brigade, as Garland&#x27;s line had not been seriously tested yet.

Across the Little Rock road, Morgan&#x27;s corps began its advance, as the Union assault began brigade-by-brigade from right to left. Burbridge&#x27;s brigade moved first. Confederate soldiers fired upon the brigade from a group of huts, but were driven off. The brigade&#x27;s attack came to a halt from the Confederate line. Landram&#x27;s brigade was brought up in support, and the two brigades fought Garland&#x27;s men for an hour and a half. After this, at 3 pm, Osterhaus sent Sheldon&#x27;s brigade into the fray, and the Confederate defenders were driven from the parapet of the fort. The 120th Ohio Infantry Regiment attempted to storm the fort, but became pinned down in a ravine by Confederate fire, where it remained for an hour.
The Confederates had repulsed all of the Union assaults to this point, and nightfall was approaching. The 24th Arkansas Infantry had arrived, but the Confederates had received no other reinforcements. At around 4:30 pm, white flags of surrender began to fly from the fort. The Union troops were preparing for a final assault at this time. Garland noticed white flags flying among his troops, and heard rumors that Churchill had ordered the surrender, but Garland did not believe them. Morgan noted that at various times, white flags were raised and then suppressed along the Confederate lines. The historian Timothy B. Smith suggests that it is possible that fire from Porter&#x27;s ships and Lindsey&#x27;s artillery striking the rear of the Confederate lines prompted the raising of the surrender flags. The end result of this all was significant battlefield confusion. Some of Morgan&#x27;s troops advanced towards the Confederate lines, seeing the flags of surrender, but were fired on by Confederate troops who had not surrendered. Churchill denied ordering a capitulation.

As the white flags continued to fly, Union troops moved forward and mingled in the rifle pits with Garland&#x27;s troops. Seeing the white flags, Sherman ordered Steele to stop fighting and moved to the Confederate position, where he ordered Garland to have his brigade stack arms. In turn, A. J. Smith had Burbridge advance to the fort to personally plant a flag. Confederate soldiers insisted to Burbridge that the fort had not surrendered, but Burbridge pointed out the white flags to them. Burbridge met with Churchill and Dunnington, who agreed that surrender was the only practical course of action for the Confederates. Churchill personally surrendered to McClernand. The former naval officer Dunnington would only surrender to Porter. Deshler did not believe a surrender had occurred, and interpreted the white flags as faded company flags. His men kept fighting until Union troops presented a flag of truce. During the truce, Deshler discussed with Steele and informed him that he intended to keep fighting. Steele informed Sherman of this development, who sent Churchill to talk with Deshler. Eventually, Deshler agreed to surrender after Sherman pointed out that his line had been swamped with Union soldiers.

==Aftermath==
When the surrender was completed, 4,791 Confederates had been captured. Confederate casualty records are incomplete, but a listing of casualties provided by the historian Ed Bearss indicates sixty killed, seventy-three wounded, and eighty missing. The historian Richard L. Kiper has non-prisoner Confederate losses at sixty killed and between seventy-five and eighty wounded. The historian Michael B. Ballard places Confederate battle losses as sixty killed and eighty wounded. McClernand reported capturing 17 cannons, 3,000 stands of infantry weapons, and additional equipment. The men lost at Arkansas Post amounted to about a third or fourth of the Confederate soldiers then in Arkansas. Additionally, seven Confederate cannons were destroyed during the battle. A few hundred men had managed to escape back to Holmes. Union losses were 1,092 men. McClernand&#x27;s force had suffered 1,061 casualties, and Porter 31; the breakdown of McClernand&#x27;s casualties were 134 killed, 898 wounded, and 29 missing. The majority of these casualties were suffered by the brigades of Burbridge and Hovey. Burbridge alone took 349 casualties. Some of the materials lost with &quot;Blue Wing&quot; were recaptured.

Of the reinforcements sent by Holmes to relieve Arkansas Post, one brigade learned of the fall of the fort when it reached Brownsville, while Major General John G. Walker&#x27;s Texas Division reached as close as of the fort on January 12, when it learned of the surrender. On January 12, McClernand ordered the remains of the Confederate fort to be destroyed. When Grant learned of McClernand&#x27;s expedition to Arkansas Post, he became angry and wrote to Halleck on January 11, describing the movement as a &quot;wild-goose chase&quot;. Grant viewed the Arkansas Post operation as diverting troops away from more important operations to an objective of lesser strategic significance. That same day, Grant ordered McClernand back to the Vicksburg area. On January 12, Halleck gave Grant permission to relieve McClernand and take personal command of the operations against Vicksburg. Also on January 12, McClernand&#x27;s Army of the Mississippi ceased to exist, and Sherman&#x27;s corps became the XV Corps of the Army of the Tennessee; Morgan&#x27;s corps became that army&#x27;s XIII Corps two days later.

On January 14, in a meeting with Sherman and Porter, McClernand proposed moving up the Arkansas River and striking against the Confederate force at Brownsville. However, McClernand developed doubts about the feasibility of this plan, as the water level in the Arkansas River was falling. That same day, McClernand received Grant&#x27;s order to return to the Mississippi River. McClernand&#x27;s two corps reached Napoleon on January 16, traveling through bad winter weather. Grant also traveled to Napoleon, where he met with Porter and Sherman on January 18. Grant sent McClernand and his troops further down the Mississippi River, while he returned to Memphis. Porter and Sherman were able to convince Grant of the military value of the Arkansas Post expedition. Grant later noted that the Confederate force at Arkansas Post could have proved problematic if left untended. On January 26, Grant moved downriver to the Vicksburg area, where he joined McClernand&#x27;s camp. A spat between Grant and McClernand arose on January 30, after Grant issued orders changing the position of one of McClernand&#x27;s units. McClernand responded with an insubordinate letter. That day, Grant used his authorization from Halleck to relieve McClernand from command of the operations against Vicksburg, and Grant took command of the campaign. McClernand reverted to commander of XIII Corps the next day.

After a series of canal- and bayou-related operations failed, Grant was faced with a choice between three options: a direct amphibious assault against Vicksburg from across the Mississippi River, a withdrawal to Memphis in preparation for another overland campaign, and to move further down the Mississippi River and cross the river below Vicksburg. Grant chose the latter option. Grant wanted to cross his army at Grand Gulf, Mississippi, but on April 29, Porter&#x27;s warships were unable to silence Confederate batteries there in the Battle of Grand Gulf. Grant instead crossed his army further downriver at Bruinsburg, Mississippi, on April 30 and May 1. Grant&#x27;s troops won the Battle of Port Gibson on May 1, the Battle of Raymond on May 12, and the Battle of Jackson on May 14. Confederate Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton&#x27;s army was badly mauled by Grant&#x27;s at the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16, and Grant won another victory at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge the next day. The Confederates withdrew into the defenses of Vicksburg, and repulsed Union assaults on May 19 and 22. After the failure of these assaults, Grant&#x27;s army began siege operations against the city. Running low on supplies, Pemberton surrendered his army on July 4. The fall of the city marked one of the key events of the war.

Part of the Arkansas Post battlefield is located within the Arkansas Post National Memorial, although have been submerged due to river course changes and the construction of the Arkansas Post Canal. The remains of the fort were washed away by the river as early as 1880.

<text>Devils Postpile National Monument is a U.S. national monument located near Mammoth Mountain in Eastern California. The monument protects Devils Postpile, an unusual rock formation of columnar basalt, &quot;all closely and perfectly fitted together like a vast mosaic.&quot; The monument encompasses and includes two main attractions: the Devils Postpile formation and Rainbow Falls, a waterfall on the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River. In addition, the John Muir Trail and Pacific Crest Trail merge into one trail as they pass through the monument. Excluding a small developed area containing the monument headquarters, visitor center and a campground, the National Monument lies within the borders of the Ansel Adams Wilderness.

==History==

The monument was established in 1911 as &quot;Devil Postpile National Monument,&quot; (no possessive) but is widely referred to as Devils Postpile National Monument, and has been officially styled as plural without the apostrophe since the 1930s.

An alternate historic name was Devil&#x27;s Woodpile. According to &quot;Historic Spots in California&quot; (1966), &quot;In every scenic freak the sheep-herder recognizes the work of his Satanic majesty. This formation is therefore known to local fame as the Devil&#x27;s Woodpile.&quot;

The monument was once part of Yosemite National Park, but discovery of gold in 1905 near Mammoth Lakes prompted a boundary change that left the Postpile on adjacent public land. Later, a proposal to build a hydroelectric dam called for blasting the Postpile into the river. Influential Californians, including John Muir, persuaded the federal government to stop the demolition and, in 1911, President William Howard Taft protected the area as a National Monument.

==Flora and fauna==
The elevation of the national monument is between , and the flora and fauna are typical of the western Sierra Nevada at these elevations. The monument area contains animals and plants such as black bears, pine martens, mule deer, coyotes, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, alder, and willows, Dark-eyed juncos and white-crowned sparrows are common in the summer.

Native wildflowers include:

*Crimson columbine (&quot;Aquilegia formosa&quot;)
*Giant red Indian paintbrush (&quot;Castilleja miniata&quot;)
*Pine forest larkspur (&quot;Delphinium gracilentum&quot;)
*Sierra shooting star (&quot;Dodecatheon jeffreyi&quot;)
*Wandering fleabane (&quot;Erigeron peregrinus&quot;)
*Shortleaf hulsea (&quot;Hulsea brevifolia&quot;)
*Sierra tiger lily (&quot;Lilium parvum&quot;)
*Large-leaved lupine (&quot;Lupinus polyphyllus&quot;)
*Common yellow monkeyflower (&quot;Mimulus guttatus&quot;)
*Parish&#x27;s yampah (&quot;Perideridia parishii&quot;)
*Sticky cinquefoil (&quot;Potentilla glandulosa&quot;)
*Ranger&#x27;s buttons (&quot;Angelica capitellata&quot;)
*California corn lily (&quot;Veratrum californicum&quot;)
==Access==

The most common method for accessing Devils Postpile is via the mandatory shuttle bus operated by Eastern Sierra Transit Authority in the summer months at the price of $15 for an adult, followed by a 1/4 mile walk. The shuttle route begins at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area&#x27;s Adventure Center and makes several stops throughout the valley and begins operating when the Reds Meadow Road opens in the summer, and continues through Labor Day weekend.

Devils Postpile is also accessible on foot from Mammoth Lakes by hiking over Mammoth Pass and into the Reds Meadow Valley. During the winter months, there are no services available, but adventurers can visit the site via cross-country ski or snowshoe.

Due to the Reds Meadow Road reconstruction project for the 2024 season, entry is limited to Friday starting at 9 AM, all day Saturday, and Sunday until 11 PM, this schedule until September 15, 2024. From then until the winter closure, it’s only open on Saturdays and Sundays from 9 AM to 7 PM, and there’s no shuttle. It’s closed on other days for reconstruction of the road to improve access and safety.

==Devils Postpile==
The name &quot;Devils Postpile&quot; refers to a dark cliff of columnar basalt. Radiometric dating indicates the formation was created by a lava flow at some time less than 100,000 years ago. The source of the lava is thought to have been somewhere near Upper Soda Springs campground at the north end of Pumice Flat on the floor of the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River, from where it flowed to the site of the Postpile. Estimates of the formation&#x27;s thickness range from to . The lava that now makes up the Postpile was near the bottom of this mass.

Because of its great thickness, much of the mass of pooled lava cooled slowly and evenly, which is why the columns are so long and so symmetrical. Columnar jointing occurs when certain types of lava contract while cooling.

A glacier later removed much of this mass of rock and left a polished surface on top of the columns with very noticeable glacial striations and glacial polish.

The Postpile&#x27;s columns average in diameter (&quot;The columns vary in size from ten to 30 inches in diameter.&quot;), the largest being , and many are up to long.

Together they look like tall posts stacked in a pile, hence the feature&#x27;s name. If the lava had cooled perfectly evenly, all of the columns would be expected to be hexagonal, but some of the columns have different polygonal cross-sections due to variations in cooling. A survey of 400 of the Postpile&#x27;s columns found that 44.5% were 6-sided, 37.5% 5-sided, 9.5% 4-sided, 8.0% 7-sided, and 0.5% 3-sided. Compared with other examples of columnar jointing, the Postpile has more hexagonal columns. Another feature that places the Postpile in a special category is the lack of horizontal jointing.

===Similar structures===

Although the basaltic columns are impressive, they are not unique. Basalt columns are a common volcanic feature, and they occur on many scales (faster cooling produces smaller columns). Other notable sites include Svartifoss in Vatnajökull National Park in Iceland, Giant&#x27;s Causeway in Northern Ireland, Fingal&#x27;s Cave in Scotland, Titan&#x27;s Piazza of the Mount Holyoke Range in Massachusetts, the Garni Gorge in Armenia, the Cyclopean Isles near Sicily, Sheepeater Cliff at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Basaltic Prisms of Santa María Regla in Huasca de Ocampo, Mexico, the Organ Pipes formation on Mount Cargill in New Zealand, Gilbert Hill in Mumbai, Organ Pipes National Park in Australia and the Column Cape (Russian: &quot;Mis Stolbchaty&quot;) on Kunashir Island, the southernmost of the Kuril Islands, Cerro Colorado and Mar Brava (Ancud) in Chile. Columnar basalt can also be seen in a high desert dry river falls area just north of Lajitas, Texas. The much more massive Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming is superficially similar but consists of a phonolite porphyry, formed by the intrusion of igneous rock.

<text>Mark Lee Romanek (; born September 18, 1959) is an American director. He is known for his music videos, which have earned him three Grammy Awards for Best Short Form Music Video (more than any other director) and 20 MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Direction for Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;99 Problems&quot; and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. He has also been recognized for his photography, taking pictures of numerous celebrities over the years, and had 30 of his photographs exhibited by French luxury retailer Colette in 2017.

Romanek&#x27;s film work includes co-writing and directing the comedy-drama &quot;Static&quot; (1985), writing and directing the psychological thriller &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; (2002), and directing the dystopian romantic drama &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; (2010). He has also directed and/or executive produced episodes of the series &quot;The Whispers&quot; (2015), &quot;Vinyl&quot; (2016), and &quot;Tales from the Loop&quot; (2020).

==Early life==
Mark Lee Romanek was born in Chicago on September 18, 1959, the son of Jewish parents Shirlee and Marvin Romanek. He was inspired to become a filmmaker by seeing Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) as a child. He experimented with Super 8 mm and 16 mm film as a teenager. He attended New Trier High School, where he studied under Kevin Dole, who was already creating music videos on his own in the mid-1970s, and Peter Kingsbury, who had studied with experimentalist filmmakers such as George Landow and Stan Brakhage at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Both teachers exposed students to works by significant figures of the American avant-garde cinema such as Maya Deren, Kenneth Anger, and Paul Sharits.

Romanek subsequently attended Ithaca College in Ithaca, New York, and graduated from its Roy H. Park School of Communications with a degree in cinema and photography. He served as second assistant director on Brian De Palma&#x27;s film &quot;Home Movies&quot; (1979), an autobiographical work conceived as an exercise for De Palma&#x27;s students at Sarah Lawrence College, where he was once a student himself. Romanek met actor Keith Gordon, who played De Palma&#x27;s alter ego, on the set of the film; Gordon later remembered Romanek&#x27;s entrance into film production:

==Career==
===Music videos===
After a few years writing screenplays, Romanek decided to focus on music videos and signed on with Satellite Films, a division of Propaganda Films. His subsequent work has come to be regarded as among the best of the medium. He has worked with many top-selling recording artists from different genres of popular music, and his videos have been given credit for making stars out of some. One of his notable videos was for the Nine Inch Nails song &quot;Closer&quot;. Its critical acclaim was only matched by its controversy, with many accusing the video as being disturbing and demonic (a big reason why the video was so popular among fans). Romanek would again work with Nine Inch Nails for the song &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot;.

Romanek directed the music videos for David Bowie&#x27;s 1993 singles &quot;Jump They Say&quot; and &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot;.

Romanek was given his first Grammy Award for Best Short Form Video in 1996 for &quot;Scream&quot;, a collaboration between the pop superstar siblings Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson. The video, which cost $7 million to make, is cited as one of the most expensive ever made. Romanek won his second Grammy two years later, again with Janet Jackson, for her video &quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot;. In 2002, Romanek shot a video for Audioslave&#x27;s &quot;Cochise&quot; in which the band performed in the midst of a prolonged pyrotechnic display of the intensity usually seen only during fireworks finales. The explosions were so loud during the night shoot in the San Fernando Valley that local police and fire departments received hundreds of calls from residents who feared that a terrorist attack was under way.

Romanek&#x27;s 2002 music video for Johnny Cash&#x27;s cover of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Hurt&quot; has been hailed by many critics and fans alike as the most personal and moving music video ever made. The song expresses self-loathing and the futility of worldly accomplishments; this content took on a new poignancy when sung by Cash near the end of his life, quietly performing in his memorabilia-filled home, with shots of the flood-ravaged &quot;House of Cash&quot; museum and archival shots of a younger, cockier Cash edited in. The video was nominated for seven VMAs, winning one for cinematography, and also won Romanek his third Grammy.

Other Romanek videos that have received accolades and awards include the VMA winners &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; (En Vogue), &quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way&quot; (Lenny Kravitz), &quot;Rain&quot; (Madonna), &quot;Devil&#x27;s Haircut&quot; (Beck), &quot;99 Problems&quot; (Jay-Z), and &quot;Criminal&quot; (Fiona Apple). Many others have also received nominations. In 1997, Romanek received the VMA Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award for his contribution to the medium. Two of his music videos, &quot;Closer&quot; by Nine Inch Nails and &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; by Madonna, have been made part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

In a 2013 interview with &quot;IndieWire&quot;, Romanek responded to the question of whether he would direct another music video:

Despite this, Romanek returned to music video directing with Jay-Z&#x27;s performance art piece &quot;Picasso Baby&quot;, which aired on HBO on August 2, 2013. The video was shot inside the Pace Gallery in New York and featured a group of personalities from the world of art, including Marina Abramović, whose 2010 performance art work &quot;The Artist is Present&quot; inspired the video. This marked Romanek&#x27;s first music video in eight years, his last being Coldplay&#x27;s video for &quot;Speed of Sound&quot; in 2005.

Romanek then directed &quot;Filthy&quot; by Justin Timberlake and &quot;Rescue Me&quot; by Thirty Seconds to Mars, which both premiered in 2018.

In 2022, Romanek directed a 180-degree virtual reality concert for Foo Fighters, featuring a song by the group never before played.

===Film and TV===

Romanek&#x27;s first film, &quot;Static&quot; (1985), followed a man claiming to have invented a television set capable of showing a live picture of Heaven. The film achieved something of a cult following on the British film scene and led to his first music video job, but he later disowned it and called it an &quot;embarrassing bit of juvenilia&quot;.

In 2002, Romanek wrote and directed his second feature film, &quot;One Hour Photo&quot;, starring Robin Williams as a department store photo processor who becomes obsessed with a local family through the photographs they bring to him to be developed. The film proved to be only a moderate hit, but still established Romanek as a respected director. Rumors spread that the studio, Fox Searchlight, had forced changes on Romanek that seriously altered the film from how he had intended it. He has dismissed this story, however, stating that there never was a director&#x27;s cut and that the studio did not exercise any editorial control.

Romanek had hoped to follow the film with an adaptation of Philip Gourevitch&#x27;s &quot;A Cold Case&quot; which was to star Tom Hanks as chief investigator Andy Rosenzweig. The film went into development hell due to scheduling conflicts and issues with rights. In 2013, Romanek said he still hoped to make the film someday: &quot;The character in the film is a bit older and I think someday, in the next eight years or something, maybe it&#x27;ll be the right time to do [it].&quot;

In 2008, after Romanek left as the director of &quot;The Wolfman&quot; due to creative differences, he accepted the offer to work on &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;. Romanek was glad to get the opportunity to shoot the film, saying &quot;From the moment I finished the novel, it became my dream to film it. [Kazuo] Ishiguro&#x27;s conception is so daring, so eerie and beautiful. Alex Garland&#x27;s adaptation is sensitive and precise. The cast is perfect, the crew superb.&quot; The film was released in 2010 to mostly positive reviews and was the 28th highest-grossing film at the box office for that week.

Throughout the 2010s, Romanek circled numerous projects that never materialized under his direction, including a remake of &quot;The Boston Strangler&quot;, the &quot;Shining&quot; prequel &quot;The Overlook Hotel&quot;, the David Mamet-penned conspiracy thriller &quot;Blackbird&quot;, and a film about the Norco shootout, amongst others. &quot;I wish I had made ten films by now,&quot; Romanek said in 2020, &quot;It&#x27;s not for lack of trying... I have a lot of movies that I worked on that didn&#x27;t come together.&quot; Romanek has however directed several episodes for television, including the HBO series &quot;Vinyl&quot; and the Amazon Prime series &quot;Tales from the Loop&quot;, which he also executive produced.

In 2021, it was reported that Romanek would direct the horror film &quot;Mother Land&quot; which would have been his first feature film in over a decade. In December of the following year, Romanek revealed that he was no longer attached to it and that he had been replaced as director by Alexandre Aja.

In 2024, Romanek revealed that he was &quot;continu[ing] to develop several feature projects.&quot;

===Photography===
Throughout his career in music and film, Romanek has been recognized for his photography skills, taking pictures of numerous celebrities he has befriended over the years such as Kanye West, Paul McCartney, Lenny Kravitz, Iggy Pop, Mick Jagger, Robin Williams, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola, Francis Ford Coppola, and Jay-Z. Romanek has said that while the photographs are all of famous people, he still considers them personal.

In 2017, 30 of Romanek&#x27;s photographs were unearthed for an exhibition at the French luxury retailer Colette for the series entitled &quot;SNAPSHOTS&quot;.

==Personal life==
Romanek resides in Los Angeles. He married singer Brigette McWilliams in 2005, and they had two daughters together before divorcing in 2022.

<text>Magas () is the capital town of Ingushetia, Russia. It was founded in 1995 and replaced Nazran as the capital of the republic in 2002. Due to this distinction, Magas is the smallest capital of a federal subject in Russia. In 2019, it had a population of 8,771 inhabitants, up from 5,841 in 2010 and 272 in 2002.

==History==
The Republic of Ingushetia came into existence in 1992, having been split from the Chechen–Ingush ASSR. Nazran, the largest of three towns of the new republic, was made a temporary capital.

In 1995, President Ruslan Aushev founded Magas just a few kilometers south of Nazran, naming it after the medieval city of Maghas. The new town was supposed to serve purely for administrative needs. Magas/Maghas is 28 miles from the frontline for parts of 1942–1943.

It replaced Nazran as capital of the Republic in 2002.

The name is given in Persian as &quot;Magas&quot; or &quot;Makas&quot;. The name &quot;Magas&quot; is a homonym of the Persian word &quot;magas&quot;, meaning &quot;fly&quot;, and the medieval writers al-Mas&#x27;udi and Juvayni made plays on words about the city&#x27;s name. The Chinese transcription &quot;Muzashan&quot; uses the characters for wood (&quot;mu&quot;, 木) and mountain (&quot;shan&quot;, 山), which John Latham-Sprinkle interprets as a possible reference to the city&#x27;s location in rough terrain.

==Geography==
===Location===

Magas is located in the western area of Ingushetia, at the borders with Prigorodny Raion of North Ossetia-Alania. It is surrounded by Nazranovsky Raion, and the nearest settlements are Ekazhevo, the city of Nazran, and Ali-Yurt. The town is also 30 km from the North Ossetian-Alanian capital city, Vladikavkaz.

===Administrative and municipal status===

Magas is the capital of the republic. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the town of republic significance of Magas—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of republic significance of Magas is incorporated as Magas Urban Okrug.

===Climate===
Magas has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm summers and cold winters.
==Demographics==
Magas&#x27; population, with a hundred inhabitants at the beginning, increased in early 2010s.

==Gallery==
==Transport==
Magas Airport serves the town and the nearby city of Nazran, which is home to the nearest train station.

<doc id="319483" wikidata="Q1616130" url="?curid=319483" title="Hetch Hetchy">
<text>Hetch Hetchy is a valley, reservoir, and water system in California in the United States. The glacial Hetch Hetchy Valley lies in the northwestern part of Yosemite National Park and is drained by the Tuolumne River. For thousands of years before the arrival of settlers from the United States in the 1850s, the valley was inhabited by Native Americans who practiced subsistence hunting-gathering. 

During the late 19th century, the valley was renowned for its natural beauty – often compared to that of Yosemite Valley – but also targeted for the development of water supply for irrigation and municipal interests. The controversy over damming Hetch Hetchy became mired in the political issues of the day. The law authorizing the dam passed Congress on December 7, 1913. In 1923, the O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam was completed on the Tuolumne River, flooding the entire valley under the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. The dam and reservoir are the centerpiece of the Hetch Hetchy Project, which in 1934 began to deliver water west to San Francisco and its client municipalities in the greater San Francisco Bay Area.

==Geography==
Before damming, the high granite formations produced a valley with an average depth of and a maximum depth of over ; the length of the valley was with a width ranging from . The valley floor consisted of roughly of meadows fringed by pine forest, through which meandered the Tuolumne River and numerous tributary streams. Kolana Rock, at , is a massive rock spire on the south side of the Hetch Hetchy Valley. Hetch Hetchy Dome, at , lies directly north of it. The locations of these two formations roughly correspond with those of Cathedral Rocks and El Capitan seen from Tunnel View in Yosemite Valley. A broad, low rocky outcrop situated between Kolana Rock and Hetch Hetchy Dome divided the former meadow in two distinct sections.

The valley is fed by the Tuolumne River, Falls Creek, Tiltill Creek, Rancheria Creek, and numerous smaller streams which collectively drain a watershed of . In its natural state, the valley floor was marshy and often flooded in the spring when snow melt in the high Sierra cascaded down the Tuolumne River and backed up behind the narrow gorge which is now spanned by O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam. The entire valley is now flooded under an average of water behind the dam, although it occasionally reemerges in droughts, as it did in 1955, 1977, and 1991.

Upstream from the valley lies the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne, while the smaller Poopenaut Valley is directly downstream from O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam. The Hetch Hetchy Road drops into the valley at the dam, but all points east of there are roadless, and accessible only to hikers and equestrians. The O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam is near Yosemite&#x27;s western boundary, but the long, narrow, fingerlike reservoir stretches eastward for about .
Wapama Falls, at , and Tueeulala Falls, at – both among the tallest waterfalls in North America – are both located in Hetch Hetchy Valley. Rancheria Falls is located farther southeast, on Rancheria Creek. Formerly, a &quot;small but noisy&quot; waterfall and natural pool existed on the Tuolumne River marked the upper entrance to Hetch Hetchy Valley, informally known as Tuolumne Fall (not to be confused with a similarly named waterfall several miles upriver near Tuolumne Meadows). The waterfall on the Tuolumne is now submerged under Hetch Hetchy Reservoir.

===Geology===
The Hetch Hetchy Valley began as a V-shaped river canyon cut out by the ancestral Tuolumne River. About one million years ago, the extensive Sherwin glaciation widened, deepened and straightened river valleys along the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, including Hetch Hetchy, Yosemite Valley, and Kings Canyon farther to the south. During the last glacial period, the Tioga Glacier formed from extensive icefields in the upper Tuolumne River watershed; between 110,000 and 10,000 years ago Hetch Hetchy Valley was sculpted into its present shape by repeated advance and retreat of the ice, which also removed extensive talus deposits that may have accumulated in the valley since the Sherwin period. At maximum extent, Tioga Glacier may have been long and up to thick, filling Hetch Hetchy Valley to the brim and spilling over the sides, carving out the present rugged plateau country to the north and southwest. When the glacier retreated for the final time, sediment-laden meltwater deposited thick layers of silt, forming the flat alluvial floodplain of the valley floor.

Compared with Yosemite Valley, the walls of Hetch Hetchy are smoother and rounder because it was glaciated to a greater extent. This is because the Tuolumne catchment basin above Hetch Hetchy is almost three times as large as the catchment area of the Merced River above Yosemite, allowing a greater volume of ice to form.

==Flora and fauna==
Hetch Hetchy is home to a diverse array of plants and animals. Gray pine, incense-cedar, and California black oak grow in abundance. Many examples of red-barked manzanita can be seen along the Hetch Hetchy Road. Spring and early summer bring wildflowers including lupine, wallflower, monkey flower, and buttercup. Seventeen species of bats inhabit the Hetch Hetchy area, including the largest North American bat, the western mastiff.

Before damming, the valley floor contained abundant stands of black oaks, live oak, Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, and silver fir bordering the meadows, with alder, willow, poplar and dogwood in the riparian zone along the Tuolumne River. The valley&#x27;s abundant plants provided nourishment for mule deer, black bears and bighorn sheep. Due to large cataracts on the Tuolumne River upstream, Hetch Hetchy Valley may have been in the uppermost range for native rainbow trout in the river.

Due to its abundant wetlands and stream pools, Hetch Hetchy was notorious among early travelers for becoming infested with mosquitoes in the summertime. Said San Francisco resident William Denman in 1918, &quot;The first time I went into the Hetch Hetchy the mosquitoes were intolerable. They would light upon a man&#x27;s blue shirt and turn it brown, and were voracious as mosquitoes would be.&quot;
==History==

===Indigenous peoples===
People have lived in Hetch Hetchy Valley for over 6,000 years. Native American cultures were prominent before the 1850s when the first settlers from the United States arrived in the Sierra Nevada. During summer, people of the Miwok and Paiute came to Hetch Hetchy from the Central Valley in the west and the Great Basin in the east. The valley provided an escape from the summer heat of the lowlands. They hunted, and gathered seeds and edible plants to furnish themselves winter food, trade items, and materials for art and ceremonial objects. Today, descendants of these people still use milkweed, deergrass, bracken fern, willow, and other plants for a variety of uses including baskets, medicines, and string.

Meadow plants unavailable in the lowlands were particularly valuable resources to these tribes. For thousands of years, Native Americans subjected the valley to controlled bushfires, which prevented forest from taking over the valley meadows. Periodic clearing of the valley provided ample space for the growth of the grasses and shrubs they relied on, as well as additional room for large game animals such as deer to browse. In the 19th century, the first white visitors to the valley did not realize that Hetch Hetchy&#x27;s extensive meadows were the product of millennia of management by Native Americans; instead they believed &quot;the valley was purely a product of ancient geological forces (or divine intervention) ... this was fundamental to its allure as a destination and subject.&quot;

The valley&#x27;s name may be derived from a Miwok word earlier anglicized as &quot;hatchhatchie&quot;, which means &quot;edible grasses&quot; or &quot;magpie&quot;. It is likely that the edible grass was blue dicks. Chief Tenaya of the Yosemite Valley&#x27;s Ahwaneechee tribe claimed that &quot;Hetch Hetchy&quot; was Miwok for &quot;Valley of the Two Trees&quot;, referring to a pair of yellow pines that once stood at the head of Hetch Hetchy. Miwok names are still used for features, including Tueeulala Fall, Wapama Fall, and Kolana Rock.

While its cousin Yosemite Valley to the south had permanent Miwok settlements, Hetch Hetchy was only seasonally inhabited. This was likely because of Hetch Hetchy&#x27;s narrow outlet, which in years of heavy snowmelt created a bottleneck in the Tuolumne River and the subsequent flooding of the valley floor.

===Exploration and early development===


In the early 1850s, a mountain man by the name of Nathan Screech became the first non-Native American to enter the valley. Local legend attributes the modern name &quot;Hetch Hetchy&quot; to Screech&#x27;s initial arrival in the valley, during which he observed the Native Americans &quot;cooking a variety of grass covered with edible seeds&quot;, which they called &quot;hatch hatchy&quot; or &quot;hatchhatchie&quot;. Screech reported that the valley was bitterly disputed between the &quot;Pah Utah Indians&quot; (Paiute) and &quot;Big Creek Indians&quot; (Miwok), and witnessed several fights in which the Paiute appeared to be the dominant tribe. About 1853, his brother, Joseph Screech (credited in some accounts for the original discovery of the valley) blazed the first trail from Big Oak Flat, a mining camp near present-day Lake Don Pedro, for northeast to Hetch Hetchy Valley.

During this time, the upper Tuolumne River, including Hetch Hetchy Valley, was visited by prospectors attracted by the California Gold Rush. Miners did not stay in the area for long, however, as richer deposits occurred further south along the Merced River and in the Big Oak Flat area. After the valley&#x27;s native inhabitants were driven out by the newcomers, it was used by ranchers, many of whom were former miners, to graze livestock. Animals were principally driven along Joseph Screech&#x27;s trail from Big Oak Flat to Hetch Hetchy. Its meadows provided abundant feed for &quot;thousands of head of sheep and cattle that entered lean and lank in the spring, but left rolling fat and hardly able to negotiate the precipitous and difficult defiles out of the mountains in the fall.&quot;

In 1867, Charles F. Hoffman of the California Geological Survey conducted the first survey of the valley. Hoffman observed a meadow &quot;well timbered and affording good grazing&quot;, and noted the valley had a milder climate than Yosemite Valley, hence the abundance of ponderosa pine and gray pine. The valley was slowly becoming known for its natural beauty, but it was never a popular tourist destination because of extremely poor access and the location of the famous Yosemite Valley just to the south. Those who did visit it were enchanted by its scenery, but encountered difficulties with the primitive conditions and, in summertime, swarms of mosquitoes. Albert Bierstadt, Charles Dorman Robinson and William Keith were known for their landscapes that drew tourists to the Hetch Hetchy Valley. Bierstadt described the valley as &quot;smaller than the more famous valley ... but it presents many of the same features in his scenery and is quite as beautiful.&quot;

When Yosemite Valley became part of a state park in 1864, Hetch Hetchy received no such designation. As the grazing of livestock damaged native plants in the Hetch Hetchy Valley, mountaineer and naturalist John Muir pressed for the protection of both valleys under a single national park. Muir, who himself had briefly worked as a shepherd in Hetch Hetchy, was known for calling sheep &quot;hoofed locusts&quot; because of their environmental impact. Muir&#x27;s friend Robert Underwood Johnson of the politically influential &quot;Century Magazine&quot; and several other prominent figures were inspired by Muir&#x27;s work and helped to get Yosemite National Park established by October 1, 1890. However, ranchers who had previously owned land in the new park continued their use of Hetch Hetchy Valley – a &quot;sheep-grazing free-for-all [that] threatened to denude the High Sierra meadows&quot; – before disputes over state and private properties in respect to national park boundaries were finally settled in the early 1900s.

Interest in using the valley as a water source or reservoir dates back as far as the 1850s, when the Tuolumne Valley Water Company proposed developing water storage there for irrigation. By the 1880s, San Francisco was looking to Hetch Hetchy water as a fix for its outdated and unreliable water system. The city would repeatedly try to acquire water rights to Hetch Hetchy, including in 1901, 1903 and 1905, but was continually rebuffed because of conflicts with irrigation districts that had senior water rights on the Tuolumne River, and because of the valley&#x27;s national park status.

===Damming===
In 1906, after a major earthquake and subsequent fire that devastated San Francisco, the inadequacy of the city&#x27;s water system was made tragically clear.
San Francisco applied to the United States Department of the Interior to gain water rights to Hetch Hetchy, and in 1908 President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior, James R. Garfield, granted San Francisco the rights to development of the Tuolumne River. This provoked a seven-year environmental struggle with the environmental group Sierra Club, led by John Muir. Muir observed:

Dam Hetch Hetchy! As well dam for water-tanks the people&#x27;s cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man.

Proponents of the dam replied that out of multiple sites considered by San Francisco, Hetch Hetchy had the &quot;perfect architecture for a reservoir&quot;, with pristine water, lack of development or private property, a steep-sided and flat-floored profile that would maximize the amount of water stored, and a narrow outlet ideal for placement of a dam. They claimed the valley was not unique and would be even more beautiful with a lake. Muir predicted that this lake would create an unsightly &quot;bathtub ring&quot; around its perimeter, caused by the water&#x27;s destruction of lichen growth on the canyon walls, which would inevitably be visible at low lake levels.

Since the valley was within Yosemite National Park, an act of Congress was needed to authorize the project. The U.S. Congress passed and President Woodrow Wilson signed the Raker Act in 1913, which permitted the flooding of the valley under the conditions that power and water derived from the river could only be used for public interests. Ultimately, San Francisco sold hydropower from the dam to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E), which led to decades of legal wrangling and controversy over terms in the Raker Act.

The controversy over Hetch Hetchy was in the context of other political scandals and controversies, especially prevalent in the Taft administration. The Great Alaskan Land Fraud and the Pinchot-Ballinger Controversy caused both Richard A. Ballinger and Gifford Pinchot to resign and be fired respectively. The openings in the Taft administration led to the eventual success of the Raker Act.

Work on the Hetch Hetchy Project began in 1914. The Hetch Hetchy Railroad was constructed to link the Sierra Railway with Hetch Hetchy Valley, allowing for direct rail shipment of construction materials from San Francisco to the dam site. Construction of O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam began in 1919 and was finished in 1923, with the reservoir first filling in May of that year. The dam was then high; its present height of was achieved only later, in 1938. On October 28, 1934 – twenty years after the beginning of construction on the Hetch Hetchy project – a crowd of 20,000 San Franciscans gathered to celebrate the arrival of the first Hetch Hetchy water in the city.

The Early Intake (Lower Cherry) Powerhouse began commercial operation five years before the O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam was completed. The first Moccasin Powerhouse in Moccasin, California began commercial operation in 1925 followed by the Holm Powerhouse in 1960 (the same month the Early Intake Powerhouse was taken out of service). In 1967 the Robert C. Kirkwood Powerhouse started commercial operation followed by a New Moccasin Powerhouse in 1969 when the Old Moccasin Powerhouse was taken out of service. Finally, in 1988, a third generator was added to the Kirkwood Powerhouse.

==Hetch Hetchy Project==

Hetch Hetchy Valley serves as the primary water source for the City and County of San Francisco and several surrounding municipalities in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. The dam and reservoir, combined with a series of aqueducts, tunnels, and hydroelectric plants as well as eight other storage dams, comprise a system known as the Hetch Hetchy Project, which provides 80% of the water supply for 2.6 million people. The project is operated by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. The city must pay a lease of $30,000 per year for the use of Hetch Hetchy, which sits on federal land. The aqueduct delivers an average of of water each year, or per day, to residents of San Francisco and San Mateo, Santa Clara and Alameda Counties.

As completed, O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam is long, spanning the valley at its narrow outlet. The dam contains of concrete. The Hetch Hetchy Reservoir created by the dam has a capacity of , with a maximum area of and a maximum depth of . From Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, the water flows through the Canyon and Mountain Tunnels to Kirkwood and Moccasin Powerhouses, which have capacities of 124 and 110 megawatts, respectively. An additional hydroelectric system comprising Cherry Lake, Lake Eleanor and the Holm Powerhouse is also part of the Hetch Hetchy Project, adding another 169 megawatts of generating capacity. The entire system produces about 1.7 billion kilowatt hours per year, enough to meet 20% of San Francisco&#x27;s electricity needs.

After passing through the powerhouses, Hetch Hetchy water flows into the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct which travels across the Central Valley. Just before reaching the Bay Area, it passes through the Irvington tunnel near the city of Fremont, and the aqueduct splits into four pipelines at . These are called Bay Division Pipelines (BDPL) 1, 2, 3, and 4, with nominal pipeline diameters of 60, 66, 78, and 96 inches (1.5, 1.7, 2.0 and 2.4 m, respectively). All four pipelines cross the Hayward fault. Pipelines 1 and 2 cross the San Francisco Bay to the south of the Dumbarton Bridge, while pipelines 3 and 4 run to the south of the bay. In the Bay Area, Hetch Hetchy water is stored in local facilities including Calaveras Reservoir, Crystal Springs Reservoir, and San Antonio Reservoir. Pipelines 3 and 4 end at the Pulgas Water Temple, a small park that contains classical architectural elements which celebrate the water delivery.

Water from Hetch Hetchy is some of the cleanest municipal water in the United States; San Francisco is one of six U.S. cities not required by law to filter its tap water, although the water is disinfected by ozonation and, since 2011, exposure to UV. The water quality is high because of the unique geology of the upper Tuolumne River drainage basin, which consists mostly of bare granite; as a result, the rivers feeding Hetch Hetchy Reservoir have extremely low loads of sediments and nutrients. The watershed is also strictly protected, so swimming and boating are prohibited at the reservoir (although fishing is permitted at the reservoir and in the rivers which feed it), a measure which is considered unusual for US lakes outside the region. In 2018, the Department of the Interior of the Trump administration began to consider a proposal to allow limited boating on the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir for the first time, supported by the advocacy group Restore Hetch Hetchy which argued that &quot;San Francisco received [Hetch Hetchy&#x27;s] benefits long ago, but the American people have not.&quot;

==Proposed restoration==
===Arguments for===
The battle over Hetch Hetchy Valley continues today between those who wish to retain the dam and reservoir, and those who wish to drain the reservoir and return Hetch Hetchy Valley to its former state. Those in favor of dam removal have pointed out that many actions by San Francisco since 1913 have been in violation of the Raker Act, which explicitly stated that power and water from Hetch Hetchy could not be sold to private interests. Hydroelectric power generated from the Hetch Hetchy project is largely sold to Bay Area customers through a private power company, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E). San Francisco was able to accomplish this in 1925 by claiming it had run out of funds to extend the Hetch Hetchy transmission line all the way to the city. The terminus of the incomplete line was &quot;conveniently located next to a PG&amp;E substation&quot;, which connected to PG&amp;E&#x27;s private line which in turn bridged the gap to San Francisco. The city justified this as a temporary measure, but no attempt to follow through with completing the municipal grid was ever made. Peter Byrne of &quot;SF Weekly&quot; has stated that &quot;the plain language of the Raker Act itself and experts who are familiar with the act (and have no stake in city politics) all agree: The city of San Francisco is not in violation of the Raker Act.&quot; Harold L. Ickes, Secretary of the Interior in the late 1930s, said there was a violation of the Raker Act, but he and the city reached an agreement in 1945. In 2015, Restore Hetch Hetchy filed a complaint arguing that the construction of the dam had violated a provision in the constitution of California about water use, but the lawsuit was rejected by an appeals court and later the California State Supreme Court.
Preservation groups including the Sierra Club and Restore Hetch Hetchy state that draining Hetch Hetchy would open the valley back up to recreation, a right that should be provided to the American people because the reservoir is within the legal boundaries of a national park. They acknowledge that a concerted effort would have to be made to control the introduction of wildlife and tourism back into the valley in order to prevent destabilization of the ecosystem, and that it might be decades or even centuries before the valley could be returned to natural conditions.

In 1987, the idea of razing the O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam gained an adherent in Don Hodel, Secretary of the Department of the Interior under President Ronald Reagan. Hodel called for a study of the effect of tearing down the dam. The National Park Service concluded that two years after draining the valley, grasses would cover most of its floor and within 10 years, clumps of cone-bearing trees and some oaks would take root. Within 50 years, vegetative cover would be complete except for exposed rocky areas. In this unmanaged scenario, where nature is left to take hold in the valley, eventually a forest would grow, rather than the meadow being restored. However, the same NPS study also finds that with intensive management, an outcome in which &quot;the entire valley would appear much as it did before construction of the reservoir&quot; is feasible.

The dam would not have to be completely removed; rather, it would only be necessary to cut a hole through the base in order to drain the water and restore natural flows of the Tuolumne River. Most of the dam would remain in place, both to avoid the enormous costs of demolition and removal, and to serve as a monument for the workers who built it. The water storage provided at Hetch Hetchy could be transferred into Lake Don Pedro lower on the Tuolumne River by raising the New Don Pedro Dam . Water could be diverted into the Kirkwood and Moccasin Powerhouses using lower-impact diversion dams, providing power generation on a seasonal basis, and the increased height, and thus hydraulic head, at Don Pedro would also increase power generation there. Furthermore, the removal of O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam would not require costly sediment control measures, as would be typical on most dam removal projects, because of the high quality of the Tuolumne River water – in the first 90 years since its construction, only around of sediment had been deposited in Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, much less than most other dams. A 2019 study commissioned by Restore Hetch Hetchy argued that draining the reservoir and equipping the valley with a tourism infrastructure comparable to that of Yosemite Valley (which receives around 100 times as many visitors annually as Hetch Hetchy&#x27;s 44,000) could result in a &quot;recreational value&quot; of up to $178 million per year, or possibly an overall economic value of up to $100 billion.

===Arguments against===
Those in opposition of dam removal state that demolishing O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam would take away a valuable source of clean, renewable hydroelectric power in the Kirkwood and Moccasin powerhouses; even if measures such as seasonal water diversion into the powerhouses were employed, it would only make up for a fraction of the original power production. The remaining deficit would likely have to be replaced by polluting fossil fuel generation. The removal of the dam would be extremely costly, at least $3–10 billion, and the transport of the demolished material away from the dam site along the narrow, winding Hetch Hetchy Road would be a logistical nightmare with possible environmental impacts. Most importantly, San Francisco would lose its source of high-quality mountain water, and would have to depend on lower-quality water from other reservoirs – which would require costly filtration and re-engineering of the aqueduct system – to meet its needs.

The economic wisdom of removing the dam has been frequently questioned. Some observers, such as Carl Pope (director of the Sierra Club), stated that Hodel had political motives in proposing the study. The imputed motive was to divide the environmental movement: to see residents of the strongly Democratic city of San Francisco coming out against an environmental issue. Dianne Feinstein, the mayor of San Francisco at the time, said in a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; story in 1987: &quot;All this is for an expanded campground? ... It&#x27;s dumb, dumb, dumb.&quot; Hodel, now retired, remains a strong proponent of restoring Hetch Hetchy Valley and Senator Feinstein remained strongly against restoration. The George W. Bush administration proposed allocating $7 million to studying the removal of the dam in the 2007 National Park Service budget. Dianne Feinstein opposed this allocation, saying, &quot;I will do all I can to make sure it isn&#x27;t included in the final bill. We&#x27;re not going to remove this dam, and the funding is unnecessary.&quot;

Opponents of dam removal have pointed out that the flooding of the Hetch Hetchy Valley has also deterred the crowds that overrun other areas of Yosemite National Park. As of 2013, Hetch Hetchy remains one of the least visited developed area of the park. Karin Klein has described Yosemite Valley as &quot;so crammed ... that it looks more like a ripstop ghetto than the site of a nature experience.&quot; She does support breaching the dam once it has reached the end of its lifespan, and not replacing it.
In November 2012, San Francisco voters soundly rejected Proposition F, which would have required the city to conduct an $8 million study on how the flooded valley could be drained and restored to its former state. The proposed study would also have been required to identify potential replacements for the water storage capacity and hydroelectric power production.

<doc id="319484" wikidata="Q468887" url="?curid=319484" title="Law of tangents">
<text>In trigonometry, the law of tangents or tangent rule is a statement about the relationship between the tangents of two angles of a triangle and the lengths of the opposing sides.

In Figure 1, , , and are the lengths of the three sides of the triangle, and , , and are the angles &quot;opposite&quot; those three respective sides. The law of tangents states that

:formula_1

The law of tangents, although not as commonly known as the law of sines or the law of cosines, is equivalent to the law of sines, and can be used in any case where two sides and the included angle, or two angles and a side, are known.

==Proof==
To prove the law of tangents one can start with the law of sines:

: formula_2

where is the diameter of the circumcircle, so that and .

It follows that

: formula_3

Using the trigonometric identity, the factor formula for sines specifically

: formula_4

we get

:formula_5

As an alternative to using the identity for the sum or difference of two sines, one may cite the trigonometric identity

: formula_6

(see tangent half-angle formula).

==Application==

The law of tangents can be used to compute the angles of a triangle in which two sides and and the enclosed angle are given. 

From

:formula_7
compute the angle difference ; use that to calculate and then .

Once an angle opposite a known side is computed, the remaining side can be computed using the law of sines.

In the time before electronic calculators were available, this method
was preferable to an application of the law of cosines , as this latter law necessitated an additional lookup in a logarithm table, in order to compute the square root. In modern times the law of tangents may have better numerical properties than the law of cosines: If is small, and and are almost equal, then an application of the law of cosines leads to a subtraction of almost equal values, incurring catastrophic cancellation.

== Spherical version ==

On a sphere of unit radius, the sides of the triangle are arcs of great circles. Accordingly, their lengths can be expressed in radians or any other units of angular measure. Let , , be the angles at the three vertices of the triangle and let , , be the respective lengths of the opposite sides. The spherical law of tangents says

: formula_8

==History==
The law of tangents was discovered by Arab mathematician Abu al-Wafa in the 10th century.

Ibn Muʿādh al-Jayyānī also described the law of tangents for planar triangles in the 11th century.

The law of tangents for spherical triangles was described in the 13th century by Persian mathematician Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274), who also presented the law of sines for plane triangles in his five-volume work &quot;Treatise on the Quadrilateral&quot;.

==Cyclic quadrilateral==
A generalization of the law of tangents holds for a cyclic quadrilateral formula_9 Denote the lengths of sides formula_10 formula_11 formula_12 and formula_13 and angle measures formula_14 formula_15 .Then:

: formula_16

This formula reduces to the law of tangents for a triangle when formula_17.

<doc id="319491" wikidata="Q1048872" url="?curid=319491" title="Centrifugal compressor">
<text>Centrifugal compressors, sometimes called impeller compressors or radial compressors, are a sub-class of dynamic axisymmetric work-absorbing turbomachinery.

They achieve pressure rise by adding energy to the continuous flow of fluid through the rotor/impeller. The equation in the next section shows this specific energy input. A substantial portion of this energy is kinetic which is converted to increased potential energy/static pressure by slowing the flow through a diffuser. The static pressure rise in the impeller may roughly equal the rise in the diffuser.

== Components of a simple centrifugal compressor ==
A simple centrifugal compressor stage has four components (listed in order of throughflow): inlet, impeller/rotor, diffuser, and collector. Figure 1.1 shows each of the components of the flow path, with the flow (working gas) entering the centrifugal impeller axially from left to right. This turboshaft (or turboprop) impeller is rotating counter-clockwise when looking downstream into the compressor. The flow will pass through the compressors from left to right.

=== Inlet ===

The simplest inlet to a centrifugal compressor is typically a simple pipe. Depending upon its use/application inlets can be very complex. They may include other components such as an inlet throttle valve, a shrouded port, an annular duct (see Figure 1.1), a bifurcated duct, stationary guide vanes/airfoils used to straight or swirl flow (see Figure 1.1), movable guide vanes (used to vary pre-swirl adjustably). Compressor inlets often include instrumentation to measure pressure and temperature in order to control compressor performance.

Bernoulli&#x27;s fluid dynamic principle plays an important role in understanding vaneless stationary components like an inlet. In engineering situations assuming adiabatic flow, this equation can be written in the form:

Equation-1.1
:formula_1

where:
* is the inlet of the compressor, station 0
* is the inlet of the impeller, station 1
* is the pressure
* is the density and formula_2 indicates that it is a function of pressure
*formula_3 is the flow speed
* is the ratio of the specific heats of the fluid

=== Centrifugal impeller ===
The identifying component of a centrifugal compressor stage is the centrifugal impeller rotor. Impellers are designed in many configurations including &quot;open&quot; (visible blades), &quot;covered or shrouded&quot;, &quot;with splitters&quot; (every other inducer removed), and &quot;w/o splitters&quot; (all full blades). Figures 0.1, 1.2.1, and 1.3 show three different open full inducer rotors with alternating full blades/vanes and shorter length splitter blades/vanes. Generally, the accepted mathematical nomenclature refers to the leading edge of the impeller with subscript 1. Correspondingly, the trailing edge of the impeller is referred to as subscript 2.

As working-gas/flow passes through the impeller from stations 1 to 2, the kinetic and potential energy increase. This is identical to an axial compressor with the exception that the gases can reach higher energy levels through the impeller&#x27;s increasing radius. In many modern high-efficiency centrifugal compressors the gas exiting the impeller is traveling near the speed of sound.

Most modern high-efficiency impellers use &quot;backsweep&quot; in the blade shape.

A derivation of the general Euler equations (fluid dynamics) is Euler&#x27;s pump and turbine equation, which plays an important role in understanding impeller performance. This equation can be written in the form:

Equation-1.2 (see Figures 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 illustrating impeller velocity triangles)

:formula_4
where:
* subscript 1 is the impeller leading edge (inlet), station 1
* subscript 2 is the impeller trailing edge (discharge), station 2
* is the energy added to the fluid
* is the acceleration due to gravity
* is the impeller&#x27;s circumferential velocity, units velocity
* is the velocity of flow relative to the impeller, units velocity
* is the absolute velocity of flow relative to stationary, units velocity
=== Diffuser ===
The next component, downstream of the impeller within a simple centrifugal compressor may the diffuser. The diffuser converts the flow&#x27;s kinetic energy (high velocity) into increased potential energy (static pressure) by gradually slowing (diffusing) the gas velocity. Diffusers can be vaneless, vaned, or an alternating combination. High-efficiency vaned diffusers are also designed over a wide range of solidities from less than 1 to over 4. Hybrid versions of vaned diffusers include wedge (see Figure 1.3), channel, and pipe diffusers. Some turbochargers have no diffuser. Generally accepted nomenclature might refer to the diffuser&#x27;s lead edge as station 3 and the trailing edge as station 4.

Bernoulli&#x27;s fluid dynamic principle plays an important role in understanding diffuser performance. In engineering situations assuming adiabatic flow, this equation can be written in the form:

Equation-1.3
:formula_5

where:
* is the inlet of the diffuser, station 2
* is the discharge of the diffuser, station 4
*(see inlet above.)

=== Collector ===

The collector of a centrifugal compressor can take many shapes and forms. When the diffuser discharges into a large empty circumferentially (constant area) chamber, the collector may be termed a &quot;Plenum&quot;. When the diffuser discharges into a device that looks somewhat like a snail shell, bull&#x27;s horn, or a French horn, the collector is likely to be termed a &quot;volute&quot; or &quot;scroll&quot;.

When the diffuser discharges into an annular bend the collector may be referred to as a &quot;combustor inlet&quot; (as used in jet engines or gas turbines) or a &quot;return-channel&quot; (as used in an online multi-stage compressor). As the name implies, a collector&#x27;s purpose is to gather the flow from the diffuser discharge annulus and deliver this flow downstream into whatever component the application requires. The collector or discharge pipe may also contain valves and instrumentation to control the compressor. In some applications, collectors will diffuse flow (converting kinetic energy to static pressure) far less efficiently than a diffuser.

Bernoulli&#x27;s fluid dynamic principle plays an important role in understanding diffuser performance. In engineering situations assuming adiabatic flow, this equation can be written in the form:

Equation-1.4
:formula_6

where:
* is the inlet of the diffuser, station 4
* is the discharge of the diffuser, station 5
*(see inlet above.)

== Historical contributions, the pioneers ==
Over the past 100 years, applied scientists including Stodola (1903, 1927–1945), Pfleiderer (1952), Hawthorne (1964), Shepherd (1956), Lakshminarayana (1996), and Japikse (many texts including citations), have educated young engineers in the fundamentals of turbomachinery. These understandings apply to all dynamic, continuous-flow, axisymmetric pumps, fans, blowers, and compressors in axial, mixed-flow and radial/centrifugal configurations.

This relationship is the reason advances in turbines and axial compressors often find their way into other turbomachinery including centrifugal compressors. Figures 2.1 and 2.2 illustrate the domain of turbomachinery with labels showing centrifugal compressors. Improvements in centrifugal compressors have not been achieved through large discoveries. Rather, improvements have been achieved through understanding and applying incremental pieces of knowledge discovered by many individuals.

=== Aerodynamic-thermodynamic domain ===

Figure 2.1 (shown right) represents the aero-thermo domain of turbomachinery. The horizontal axis represents the energy equation derivable from The first law of thermodynamics. The vertical axis, which can be characterized by Mach Number, represents the range of fluid compressibility (or elasticity). The Z-axis, which can be characterized by Reynolds number, represents the range of fluid viscosities (or stickiness). Mathematicians and physicists who established the foundations of this aero-thermo domain include: Isaac Newton, Daniel Bernoulli, Leonhard Euler, Claude-Louis Navier, George Stokes, Ernst Mach, Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky, Martin Kutta, Ludwig Prandtl, Theodore von Kármán, Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius, and Henri Coandă.

=== Physical-mechanical domain ===

Figure 2.2 (shown right) represents the physical or mechanical domain of turbomachinery. Again, the horizontal axis represents the energy equation with turbines generating power to the left and compressors absorbing power to the right. Within the physical domain the vertical axis differentiates between high speeds and low speeds depending upon the turbomachinery application. The Z-axis differentiates between axial-flow geometry and radial-flow geometry within the physical domain of turbomachinery. It is implied that mixed-flow turbomachinery lie between axial and radial. Key contributors of technical achievements that pushed the practical application of turbomachinery forward include: Denis Papin, Kernelien Le Demour, Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, John Smeaton, Dr. A. C. E. Rateau, John Barber, Alexander Sablukov, Sir Charles Algernon Parsons, Ægidius Elling, Sanford Alexander Moss, Willis Carrier, Adolf Busemann, Hermann Schlichting, Frank Whittle and Hans von Ohain.

=== Partial timeline of historical contributions===
== Turbomachinery similarities ==
Centrifugal compressors are similar in many ways to other turbomachinery and are compared and contrasted as follows:

=== Similarities to axial compressor ===

Centrifugal compressors are similar to axial compressors in that they are rotating airfoil-based compressors. Both are shown in the adjacent photograph of an engine with 5 stages of axial compressors and one stage of a centrifugal compressor. The first part of the centrifugal impeller looks very similar to an axial compressor. This first part of the centrifugal impeller is also termed an &quot;inducer&quot;. Centrifugal compressors differ from axials as they use a significant change in radius from inlet to exit of the impeller to produce a much greater pressure rise in a single stage (e.g. 8 in the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW200 series of helicopter engines) than does an axial stage. The 1940s-era German Heinkel HeS 011 experimental engine was the first aviation turbojet to have a compressor stage with radial flow-turning part-way between none for an axial and 90 degrees for a centrifugal. It is known as a mixed/diagonal-flow compressor. A diagonal stage is used in the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW600 series of small turbofans.

=== Centrifugal fan ===
Centrifugal compressors are also similar to centrifugal fans of the style shown in the neighboring figure as they both increase the energy of the flow through the increasing radius. In contrast to centrifugal fans, compressors operate at higher speeds to generate greater pressure rises. In many cases, the engineering methods used to design a centrifugal fan are the same as those to design a centrifugal compressor, so they can look very similar.

For purposes of generalization and definition, it can be said that centrifugal compressors often have density increases greater than 5 percent. Also, they often experience relative fluid velocities above Mach number 0.3 when the working fluid is air or nitrogen. In contrast, fans or blowers are often considered to have density increases of less than five percent and peak relative fluid velocities below Mach 0.3.

=== Squirrel-cage fan ===

Squirrel-cage fans are primarily used for ventilation. The flow field within this type of fan has internal recirculations. In comparison, a centrifugal fan is uniform circumferentially.

=== Centrifugal pump ===

Centrifugal compressors are also similar to centrifugal pumps of the style shown in the adjacent figures. The key difference between such compressors and pumps is that the compressor working fluid is a gas (compressible) and the pump working fluid is liquid (incompressible). Again, the engineering methods used to design a centrifugal pump are the same as those to design a centrifugal compressor. Yet, there is one important difference: the need to deal with cavitation in pumps.

=== Radial turbine ===

Centrifugal compressors also look very similar to their turbomachinery counterpart the radial turbine as shown in the figure. While a compressor transfers energy into a flow to raise its pressure, a turbine operates in reverse, by extracting energy from a flow, thus reducing its pressure. In other words, power is input to compressors and output from turbines.

== Turbomachinery using centrifugal compressors ==

=== Standards ===
As turbomachinery became more common, standards have been created to guide manufacturers to assure end-users that their products meet minimum safety and performance requirements. Associations formed to codify these standards rely on manufacturers, end-users, and related technical specialists. A partial list of these associations and their standards are listed below:

*American Society of Mechanical Engineers:BPVC, PTC.
*American Petroleum Institute: API STD 617 8TH ED (E1), API STD 672 5TH ED (2019).
*American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Airconditioning Engineers: Handbook Fundamentals.
*Society of Automotive Engineers
*Compressed Air and Gas Institute
*International Organization for StandardizationISO 10439, ISO 10442, ISO 18740, ISO 6368, ISO 5389

=== Applications ===

Below, is a partial list of centrifugal compressor applications each with a brief description of some of the general characteristics possessed by those compressors. To start this list two of the most well-known centrifugal compressor applications are listed; gas turbines and turbochargers.


* In gas turbines and auxiliary power units. Ref. Figures 4.1–4.2 In their simple form, modern gas turbines operate on the Brayton cycle. (ref Figure 5.1) Either or both axial and centrifugal compressors are used to provide compression. The types of gas turbines that most often include centrifugal compressors include small aircraft engines (i.e. turboshafts, turboprops, and turbofans), auxiliary power units, and micro-turbines. The industry standards applied to all centrifugal compressors used in aircraft applications are set by the relevant civilian and military certification authorities to achieve the safety and durability required in service. Centrifugal impellers used in gas turbines are commonly made from titanium alloy forgings. Their flow-path blades are commonly flank milled or point milled on 5-axis milling machines. When running clearances have to be as small as possible without the impeller rubbing its shroud the impeller is first drawn with its high-temperature, high-speed deflected shape and then drawn in its equivalent cold static shape for manufacturing. This is necessary because the impeller deflections at the most severe running condition can be 100 times larger than the required hot running clearance between the impeller and its shroud.
* In automotive engine and diesel engine turbochargers and superchargers. Ref. Figure 1.1 Centrifugal compressors used in conjunction with reciprocating internal combustion engines are known as turbochargers if driven by the engine&#x27;s exhaust gas and turbo-superchargers if mechanically driven by the engine. Standards set by the industry for turbochargers may have been established by SAE. Ideal gas properties often work well for the design, test and analysis of turbocharger centrifugal compressor performance.
* In pipeline compressors of natural gas to move the gas from the production site to the consumer. Centrifugal compressors for such uses may be one- or multi-stage and driven by large gas turbines. Standards set by the industry (ANSI/API, ASME) result in thick casings to achieve a required level of safety. The impellers are often if not always of the covered style which makes them look much like pump impellers. This type of compressor is also often termed an &quot;API-style&quot;. The power needed to drive these compressors is most often in the thousands of horsepower (HP). The use of real gas properties is needed to properly design, test, and analyze the performance of natural gas pipeline centrifugal compressors.
* In oil refineries, natural-gas processing, petrochemical and chemical plants. Centrifugal compressors for such uses are often one-shaft multi-stage and driven by large steam or gas turbines. Their casings are termed &quot;horizontally split&quot; if the rotor is lowered into the bottom half during assembly or &quot;barrel&quot; if it has no lengthwise split-line with the rotor being slid in. Standards set by the industry (ANSI/API, ASME) for these compressors result in thick casings to achieve a required level of safety. The impellers are often of the covered style which makes them look much like pump impellers. This type of compressor is also often termed &quot;API-style&quot;. The power needed to drive these compressors is usually in the thousands of HP. Use of real gas properties is needed to properly design, test and analyze their performance.
* Air-conditioning and refrigeration and HVAC: Centrifugal compressors quite often supply the compression in water chillers cycles. Because of the wide variety of vapor compression cycles (thermodynamic cycle, thermodynamics) and the wide variety of working fluids (refrigerants), centrifugal compressors are used in a variety of sizes and configurations. Use of real gas properties is needed to properly design, test and analyze the performance of these machines. Standards set by the industry for these compressors include ASHRAE, ASME &amp; API.
* In industry and manufacturing to supply compressed air for all types of pneumatic tools. Centrifugal compressors for such uses are often multistage and driven by electric motors. Inter-cooling is often needed between stages to control air temperature. Road-repair crews and automobile repair garages find screw compressors better adapt to their needs. Standards set by the industry for these compressors include ASME and government regulations that emphasize safety. Ideal gas relationships are often used to properly design, test, and analyze the performance of these machines. Carrier&#x27;s equation is often used to deal with humidity.
* In air separation plants to manufacture purified end product gases. Centrifugal compressors for such uses are often multistage using inter-cooling to control air temperature. Standards set by the industry for these compressors include ASME and government regulations that emphasize safety. Ideal gas relationships are often used to properly design, test, and analyze the performance of these machines when the working gas is air or nitrogen. Other gases require real gas properties.
* In oil field re-injection of high-pressure natural gas to improve oil recovery. Centrifugal compressors for such uses are often one-shaft multi-stage and driven by gas turbines. With discharge pressures approaching 700 bar, casings are of the barrel style. Standards set by the industry (API, ASME) for these compressors result in large thick casings to maximize safety. The impellers are often if not always of the covered style which makes them look much like pump impellers. This type of compressor is also often termed &quot;API-style&quot;. The use of real gas properties is needed to properly design, test, and analyze their performance.

== Theory of operation ==
In the case where flow passes through a straight pipe to enter a centrifugal compressor, the flow is axial, uniform, and has no vorticity, i.e. swirling motion. As the flow passes through the centrifugal impeller, the impeller forces the flow to spin faster as it gets further from the rotational axis. According to a form of Euler&#x27;s fluid dynamics equation, known as the &quot;pump and turbine equation&quot;, the energy input to the fluid is proportional to the flow&#x27;s local spinning velocity multiplied by the local impeller tangential velocity.

In many cases, the flow leaving the centrifugal impeller is traveling near the speed of sound. It then flows through a stationary compressor causing it to decelerate. The stationary compressor is ducting with increasing flow-area where energy transformation takes place. If the flow has to be turned in a rearward direction to enter the next part of the machine, e.g. another impeller or a combustor, flow losses can be reduced by directing the flow with stationary turning vanes or individual turning pipes (pipe diffusers). As described in Bernoulli&#x27;s principle, the reduction in velocity causes the pressure to rise.

== Performance ==


While illustrating a gas turbine&#x27;s Brayton cycle, Figure 5.1 includes example plots of pressure-specific volume and temperature-entropy. These types of plots are fundamental to understanding centrifugal compressor performance at one operating point. The two plots show that the pressure rises between the compressor inlet (station 1) and compressor exit (station 2). At the same time, the specific volume decreases while the density increases. The temperature-entropy plot shows that the temperature increases with increasing entropy (loss). Assuming dry air, and the ideal gas equation of state and an isentropic process, there is enough information to define the pressure ratio and efficiency for this one point. The compressor map is required to understand the compressor performance over its complete operating range.

Figure 5.2, a centrifugal compressor performance map (either test or estimated), shows the flow, pressure ratio for each of 4 speed-lines (total of 23 data points). Also included are constant efficiency contours. Centrifugal compressor performance presented in this form provides enough information to match the hardware represented by the map to a simple set of end-user requirements.

Compared to estimating performance which is very cost effective (thus useful in design), testing, while costly, is still the most precise method. Further, testing centrifugal compressor performance is very complex. Professional societies such as ASME (i.e. PTC–10, Fluid Meters Handbook, PTC-19.x), ASHRAE (ASHRAE Handbook) and API (ANSI/API 617–2002, 672–2007) have established standards for detailed experimental methods and analysis of test results. Despite this complexity, a few basic concepts in performance can be presented by examining an example test performance map.

=== Performance maps ===

Pressure ratio and flow are the main parameters needed to match the Figure 5.2 performance map to a simple compressor application. In this case, it can be assumed that the inlet temperature is sea-level standard. This assumption is not acceptable in practice as inlet temperature variations cause significant variations in compressor performance. Figure 5.2 shows:
* Corrected mass flow: 0.04 – 0.34 kg/s
* Total pressure ratio, inlet to discharge (PR = P/P): 1.0 – 2.6

As is standard practice, Figure 5.2 has a horizontal axis labeled with a flow parameter. While flow measurements use a variety of units, all fit one of 2 categories:

====Mass flow per unit time====
Mass flow units, such as kg/s, are the easiest to use in practice as there is little room for confusion. Questions remaining would involve inlet or outlet (which might involve leakage from the compressor or moisture condensation). For atmospheric air, the mass flow may be wet or dry (including or excluding humidity). Often, the mass flow specification will be presented on an equivalent Mach number basis, formula_7. It is standard in these cases that the equivalent temperature, equivalent pressure, and gas is specified explicitly or implied at a standard condition.

====Volume flow per unit time====
In contrast, all volume flow specifications require the additional specification of density. Bernoulli&#x27;s fluid dynamic principle is of great value in understanding this problem. Confusion arises through either inaccuracies or misuse of pressure, temperature, and gas constants.

Also as is standard practice, Figure 5.2 has a vertical axis labeled with a pressure parameter. There is a variety of pressure measurement units. They all fit one of two categories:
* &quot;A △pressure, ie increase from inlet to exit&quot; (measured with a manometer)
* &quot;A discharge pressure&quot;
The pressure rise may alternatively be specified as a ratio that has no units:
* &quot;A pressure ratio&quot; (exit/inlet)

Other features common to performance maps are:

====Constant speed-lines====
The two most common methods for producing a map for a centrifugal compressor are at constant shaft speed or with a constant throttle setting. If the speed is held constant, test points are taken along a constant speed line by changing throttle positions. In contrast, if a throttle valve is held constant, test points are established by changing speed and repeated with different throttle positions (common gas turbine practice). The map shown in Figure 5.2 illustrates the most common method; lines of constant speed. In this case, we see data points connected via straight lines at speeds of 50%, 71%, 87%, and 100% RPM. The first three speed-lines have 6 points each while the highest speed line has five.

====Constant efficiency islands====
The next feature to be discussed is the oval-shaped curves representing islands of constant efficiency. In this figure we see 11 contours ranging from 56% efficiency (decimal 0.56) to 76% efficiency (decimal 0.76). General standard practice is to interpret these efficiencies as isentropic rather than polytropic. The inclusion of efficiency islands effectively generates a 3-dimensional topology to this 2-dimensional map. With inlet density specified, it provides a further ability to calculate aerodynamic power. Lines of constant power could just as easily be substituted.

====Design or guarantee point(s)====
Regarding gas turbine operation and performance, there may be a series of guaranteed points established for the gas turbine&#x27;s centrifugal compressor. These requirements are of secondary importance to the overall gas turbine performance as a whole. For this reason, it is only necessary to summarize that in the ideal case, the lowest specific fuel consumption would occur when the centrifugal compressor&#x27;s peak efficiency curve coincides with the gas turbine&#x27;s required operation line.

In contrast to gas turbines, most other applications (including industrial) need to meet a less stringent set of performance requirements. Historically, centrifugal compressors applied to industrial applications were needed to achieve performance at a specific flow and pressure. Modern industrial compressors are often needed to achieve specific performance goals across a range of flows and pressures; thus taking a significant step toward the sophistication seen in gas turbine applications.

If the compressor represented in Figure 5.2 is used in a simple application, any point (pressure and flow) within the 76% efficiency would provide very acceptable performance. An &quot;End User&quot; would be very happy with the performance requirements of 2.0 pressure ratio at 0.21 kg/s.

=== Surge ===

Surge - is a low flow phenomenon where the impeller cannot add enough energy to overcome the system resistance or backpressure. At low flow rate operation, the pressure ratio over the impeller is high, as is back system backpressure. Under critical conditions, the flow will reverse back over the tips of the rotor blades towards the impeller eye (inlet). This stalling flow reversal may go unnoticed as the fraction of mass flow or energy is too low. When large enough, rapid flow reversal occurs (i.e., surge). The reversed flow exiting the impeller inlet exhibits a strong rotational component, which affects lower radius flow angles (closer to the impeller hub) at the leading edge of the blades. The deterioration of the flow angles causes the impeller to be inefficient. A full flow reversal can occur. (Therefore, surge is sometimes referred to as axisymmetric stall.) When reversed flow reduces to a low enough level, the impeller recovers and regains stability for a short moment at which point the stage may surge again. These cyclic events cause large vibrations, increase temperature and change rapidly the axial thrust. These occurrences can damage the rotor seals, rotor bearings, the compressor driver, and cycle operation. Most turbomachines are designed to easily withstand occasional surging. However, if the machine is forced to surge repeatedly for a long period of time, or if it is poorly designed, repeated surges can result in a catastrophic failure. Of particular interest, is that while turbomachines may be very durable, their physical system can be far less robust.

====Surge line====

The surge-line shown in Figure 5.2 is the curve that passes through the lowest flow points of each of the four speed-lines. As a test map, these points would be the lowest flow points possible to record a stable reading within the test facility/rig. In many industrial applications, it may be necessary to increase the stall line due to the system backpressure. For example, at 100% RPM stalling flow might increase from approximately 0.170 kg/s to 0.215 kg/s because of the positive slope of the pressure ratio curve.

As stated earlier, the reason for this is that the high-speed line in Figure 5.2 exhibits a stalling characteristic or positive slope within that range of flows. When placed in a different system those lower flows might not be achievable because of interaction with that system. System resistance or adverse pressure is proven mathematically to be the critical contributor to compressor surge.

=== Maximum flow line versus choke ===

Choke occurs under one of 2 conditions. Typically for high speed equipment, as flow increases the velocity of the flow can approach sonic speed somewhere within the compressor stage. This location may occur at the impeller inlet &quot;throat&quot; or at the vaned diffuser inlet &quot;throat&quot;. In contrast, for lower speed equipment, as flows increase, losses increase such that the pressure ratio eventually drops to 1:1. In this case, the occurrence of choke is unlikely.

The speed-lines of gas turbine centrifugal compressors typically exhibit choke. This is a situation where the pressure ratio of a speed line drops rapidly (vertically) with little or no change in flow. In most cases the reason for this is that close to Mach 1 velocities have been reached somewhere within the impeller and/or diffuser generating a rapid increase in losses. Higher pressure ratio turbocharger centrifugal compressors exhibit this same phenomenon. Real choke phenomena is a function of compressibility as measured by the local Mach number within an area restriction within the centrifugal pressure stage.

The maximum flow line, shown in Figure 5.2, is the curve that passes through the highest flow points of each speed line. Upon inspection it may be noticed that each of these points has been taken near 56% efficiency. Selecting a low efficiency (&lt;60%) is the most common practice used to terminate compressor performance maps at high flows. Another factor that is used to establish the maximum flow line is a pressure ratio near or equal to 1. The 50% speed line may be considered an example of this.

The shape of Figure 5.2&#x27;s speed-lines provides a good example of why it is inappropriate to use the term choke in association with a maximum flow of all centrifugal compressor speed-lines. In summary; most industrial and commercial centrifugal compressors are selected or designed to operate at or near their highest efficiencies and to avoid operation at low efficiencies. For this reason there is seldom a reason to illustrate centrifugal compressor performance below 60% efficiency.

Many industrial and commercial multistage compressor performance maps exhibits this same vertical characteristic for a different reason related to what is known as stage stacking.

=== Other operating limits ===

;Minimum operating speed: The minimum speed for acceptable operation, below this value the compressor may be controlled to stop or go into an &quot;idle&quot; condition.
;Maximum allowable speed: The maximum operating speed for the compressor. Beyond this value stresses may rise above prescribed limits and rotor vibrations may increase rapidly. At speeds above this level the equipment will likely become very dangerous and be controlled to lower speeds.

==Dimensional analysis==
To weigh the advantages between centrifugal compressors it is important to compare 8 parameters classic to turbomachinery. Specifically, pressure rise (p), flow (Q), angular speed (N), power (P), density (ρ), diameter (D), viscosity (μ) and elasticity (e). This creates a practical problem when trying to experimentally determine the effect of any one parameter. This is because it is nearly impossible to change one of these parameters independently.

The method of procedure known as the Buckingham π theorem can help solve this problem by generating 5 dimensionless forms of these parameters. These Pi parameters provide the foundation for &quot;similitude&quot; and the &quot;affinity-laws&quot; in turbomachinery. They provide for the creation of additional relationships (being dimensionless) found valuable in the characterization of performance.

For the example below Head will be substituted for pressure and sonic velocity will be substituted for elasticity.

=== Buckingham Π theorem ===

The three independent dimensions used in this procedure for turbomachinery are:
*formula_8 mass (force is an alternative)
*formula_9 length
*formula_10 time

According to the theorem each of the eight main parameters are equated to its independent dimensions as follows:

=== Classic turbomachinery similitude ===

Completing the task of following the formal procedure results in generating this classic set of five dimensionless parameters for turbomachinery. Full-similitude is achieved when each one of the 5 Pi-parameters is equivalent when comparing two different cases. This of course would mean the two turbomachines being compared are similar, both geometrically and in terms of performance.

Turbomachinery analysts gain tremendous insight into performance by comparisons of the 5 parameters shown in the above table. Particularly, performance parameters such as efficiencies and loss-coefficients, which are also dimensionless. In general application, the Flow-coefficient and Head-coefficient are considered of primary importance. Generally, for centrifugal compressors, the Speed-coefficient is of secondary importance while the Reynolds-coefficient is of tertiary importance. In contrast, as expected for pumps, the Reynolds-coefficient becomes of secondary importance and the Speed-coefficient of tertiary importance. It may be found interesting that the Speed-coefficient may be chosen to define the y-axis of Figure 1.1, while at the same time the Reynolds coefficient may be chosen to define the z-axis.

=== Other dimensionless combinations ===

Demonstrated in the table below is another value of dimensional analysis. Any number of new dimensionless parameters can be calculated through exponents and multiplication. For example, a variation of the first parameter shown below is popularly used in aircraft engine system analysis. The third parameter is a simplified dimensional variation of the first and second. This third definition is applicable with strict limitations. The fourth parameter, specific speed, is very well known and useful in that it removes diameter. The fifth parameter, specific diameter, is a less often discussed dimensionless parameter found useful by Balje.

It may be found interesting that the specific speed coefficient may be used in place of speed to define the y-axis of Figure 1.2, while at the same time, the specific diameter coefficient may be in place of diameter to define the z-axis.

=== Affinity laws ===

The following &quot;affinity laws&quot; are derived from the five Π-parameters shown above. They provide a simple basis for scaling turbomachinery from one application to the next.

== Aero-thermodynamic fundamentals ==

The following equations outline a fully three-dimensional mathematical problem that is very difficult to solve even with simplifying assumptions. Until recently, limitations in computational power, forced these equations to be simplified to an inviscid two-dimensional problem with pseudo losses. Before the advent of computers, these equations were almost always simplified to a one-dimensional problem.

Solving this one-dimensional problem is still valuable today and is often termed &quot;mean-line analysis&quot;. Even with all of this simplification it still requires large textbooks to outline and large computer programs to solve practically.

=== Conservation of mass ===
Also termed &quot;continuity&quot;, this fundamental equation written in general form is as follows:
:formula_11

=== Conservation of momentum ===
Also termed the &quot;Navier–Stokes equations&quot;, this fundamental is derivable from Newton&#x27;s second law when applied to fluid motion. Written in compressible form for a Newtonian fluid, this equation may be written as follows:
:formula_12

=== Conservation of energy ===
The first law of thermodynamics is the statement of the conservation of energy. Under specific conditions, the operation of a Centrifugal compressor is considered a reversible process. For a reversible process, the total amount of heat added to a system can be expressed as formula_13 where formula_10 is temperature and formula_15 is entropy. Therefore, for a reversible process:
:formula_16

Since U, S and V are thermodynamic functions of state, the above relation holds also for non-reversible changes. The above equation is known as the fundamental thermodynamic relation.

=== Equation of state ===
The classical ideal gas law may be written:
:formula_17

The ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows
:formula_18

where formula_19 is the density, formula_20 is the adiabatic index (ratio of specific heats), formula_21 is the internal energy per unit mass (the &quot;specific internal energy&quot;), formula_22 is the specific heat at constant volume, and formula_23 is the specific heat at constant pressure.

With regard to the equation of state, it is important to remember that while air and nitrogen properties (near standard atmospheric conditions) are easily and accurately estimated by this simple relationship, there are many centrifugal compressor applications where the ideal relationship is inadequate. For example, centrifugal compressors used for large air conditioning systems (water chillers) use a refrigerant as a working gas that cannot be modeled as an ideal gas. Another example are centrifugal compressors design and built for the petroleum industry. Most of the hydrocarbon gases such as methane and ethylene are best modeled as a real gas equation of state rather than ideal gases. The Wikipedia entry for equations of state is very thorough.

== Pros and cons ==

;Pros
* Centrifugal compressors offer the advantages of simplicity of manufacturing and relatively low cost. This is due to requiring fewer stages to achieve the same pressure rise.
* Centrifugal compressors are used throughout industry because they have fewer rubbing parts, are relatively energy efficient, and give higher and non-oscillating constant airflow than a similarly sized reciprocating compressor or any other positive displacement pump.
* Centrifugal compressors are mostly used as turbochargers and in small gas turbine engines like in an APU (auxiliary power unit) and as main engine for smaller aircraft like helicopters. A significant reason for this is that with current technology, the equivalent airflow axial compressor will be less efficient due primarily to a combination of rotor and variable stator tip-clearance losses.

;Cons
*Their main drawback is that they cannot achieve the high compression ratio of reciprocating compressors without multiple stages. There are few one-stage centrifugal compressors capable of pressure ratios over 10:1, due to stress considerations which severely limit the compressor&#x27;s safety, durability and life expectancy.
*Centrifugal compressors are impractical, compared to axial compressors, for use in large gas turbines and turbojet engines propelling large aircraft, due to the resulting weight and stress, and to the frontal area presented by the large diameter of the radial diffuser.

== Structural mechanics, manufacture and design compromise ==

Ideally, centrifugal compressor impellers have thin air-foil blades that are strong, each mounted on a light rotor. This material would be easy to machine or cast and inexpensive. Additionally, it would generate no operating noise, and have a long life while operating in any environment.

From the very start of the aero-thermodynamic design process, the aerodynamic considerations and optimizations [29,30] are critical to have a successful design. during the design, the centrifugal impeller&#x27;s material and manufacturing method must be accounted for within the design, whether it be plastic for a vacuum cleaner blower, aluminum alloy for a turbocharger, steel alloy for an air compressor or titanium alloy for a gas turbine. It is a combination of the centrifugal compressor impeller shape, its operating environment, its material and its manufacturing method that determines the impeller&#x27;s structural integrity.

<doc id="319492" wikidata="Q11682576" url="?curid=319492" title="Umbrella man (JFK assassination)">
<text>The &quot;umbrella man&quot;, later identified as Louie Steven Witt, is a figure who appears in several films and photographs of the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy. He was one of the closest bystanders when the President was first struck by a bullet, near the Stemmons Freeway sign within Dealey Plaza. The figure&#x27;s behavior raised suspicion among investigators due to his maneuvering of an umbrella, as Kennedy was passing him, despite clear skies.

Louie Steven Witt came forward to the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978, identifying himself as the &quot;umbrella man&quot; in the footage. Witt said that he brought the umbrella that day to heckle Kennedy, as an indirect reference to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.&#x27;s support of Neville Chamberlain.

==Speculation==
A person popularly dubbed the &quot;umbrella man&quot; has been the object of much speculation, as he was the only person seen carrying, and opening, an umbrella on that sunny day. He was also one of the closest bystanders to President John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was first struck by a bullet. As Kennedy&#x27;s limousine approached, the man opened up and lifted the umbrella high above his head, then spun or panned the umbrella from east to west (clockwise) as the president passed by him. 

In the aftermath of the assassination, the &quot;umbrella man&quot; sat down on the sidewalk next to another man (&quot;Dark Complected Man&quot;) before getting up and walking towards the Texas School Book Depository. The fact that both of the men sat there so calmly after the shooting has raised suspicion.

Early speculation came from assassination researchers Josiah Thompson and Richard Sprague, who noticed the open umbrella in a series of photographs. Thompson and Sprague suggested that the &quot;umbrella man&quot; may have been acting as a signaler of some kind, opening his umbrella to signal &quot;go ahead&quot;, and then raising it to communicate &quot;fire a second round&quot; to other gunmen. The &quot;umbrella man&quot; is depicted as performing such a role in Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;JFK&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man.&quot;

Another theory proposed by conspiracy theorist Robert B. Cutler and endorsed by Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty is that the umbrella may have been used to fire a dart with a paralyzing agent at Kennedy to immobilize his muscles and make him a &quot;sitting duck&quot; for an assassination.

Journalist Penn Jones Jr was approached by someone who mentioned the name of Louie Steven Witt. When he was tracked down, he barely wanted to interact with journalists but offered to testify before the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). His statement of only holding up the umbrella did not reflect what he actually did at that moment, as he was moving the umbrella during the moment of shooting.

An idea speculated by the HSCA is that the umbrella may have been held as a symbol of protest regarding the U.S. government&#x27;s failure to provide an &quot;umbrella&quot; of air support during the Bay of Pigs invasion.

==Identification==
After an appeal to the public by the HSCA, Louie Steven Witt came forward in 1978 and claimed to be the &quot;umbrella man&quot;. He claimed to still have the umbrella and did not know he had been the subject of controversy. He said that he brought the umbrella simply to heckle Kennedy, whose father, Joseph, had been a supporter of the Nazi-appeasing British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. By waving a black umbrella, Chamberlain&#x27;s trademark fashion accessory, Witt said that he was protesting the Kennedy family appeasing Adolf Hitler before World War II. An umbrella had been used in cartoons in the 1930s to symbolize such appeasement, and Chamberlain often carried an umbrella. 

Kennedy, who wrote a thesis on appeasement while at Harvard, &quot;Why England Slept&quot;, might have recognized the symbolism of the umbrella. Black umbrellas had been used in connection with protests against the President before. At the time of the construction of the Berlin Wall, a group of schoolchildren from Bonn sent the White House an umbrella labeled &quot;Chamberlain&quot;.

Testifying before the HSCA, Witt said &quot;I think if &quot;The&quot; &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; had a category for people who were at the wrong place at the wrong time, doing the wrong thing, I would be No. 1 in that position, without even a close runner-up.&quot;

Witt died on November 17, 2014.

<text>The British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation, or BCRIC (pronounced &quot;brick&quot;), was a holding company formed under the government of William R. Bennett. The company took over ownership of various sawmills and mines that had been bought and bailed out by the government. The name was eventually changed to Westar Group Ltd.
The most famous aspect of the company were the five free bearer shares, dated August 7, 1979, which were distributed to all British Columbians, to promote investment in the province, and earn back a profit to the buyer. British Columbians and investors were encouraged to buy more. The company expanded and bought numerous mining and logging installations.

Because of significant investment in a North Sea oil play by a subsidiary, Westar Petroleum, and bad timing in a mining investment by another subsidiary, Westar Mining, the company ran into financial trouble. Investors saw their thousands of dollars dwindle to pennies.

In 1995, the shares were consolidated at a ratio of 125 to 1. At the time, five bearer shares were worth 0.8% of a post-consolidation share. In June 1997, the consolidated shares were subject to a compulsory buy-out at $70 each ($0.56 per bearer share) as part of a privatization transaction by the Jim Pattison Group. However, the buyout had a 10-year limit, which expired on June 30, 2007, and so outstanding share certificates no longer have any value.

<doc id="319501" wikidata="Q6579199" url="?curid=319501" title="Third party (U.S. politics)">
<text>Third party, or minor party, is a term used in the United States&#x27; two-party system for political parties other than the Republican and Democratic parties. The winner take all system for presidential elections and the single-seat plurality voting system for Congressional elections have over time helped establish the two-party system. Third parties are most often encountered in presidential nominations and while third-party candidates rarely win elections, they can have an effect on them through vote splitting and other impacts.

With few exceptions, the U.S. system has two major parties which have won, on average, 98% of all state and federal seats. According to Duverger&#x27;s law two main political parties emerge in political systems with plurality voting in single-member districts. In this case, votes for minor parties can potentially be regarded splitting votes away from the most similar major party. Third party vote splitting exceeded a president&#x27;s margin of victory in three elections: 1844, 2000, and 2016. 

There have only been a few rare elections where a minor party was competitive with the major parties, occasionally replacing one of the major parties in the 19th century. No third-party candidate has won the presidency since the Republican Party became the second major party in 1856. Since then a third-party candidate won states in five elections: 1892, 1912, 1924, 1948, and 1968. 1992 was the last time a third-party candidate won over 5% of the vote and placed second in any state.

==Notable exceptions==

Greens, Libertarians, and others have elected state legislators and local officials. The Socialist Party elected hundreds of local officials in 169 cities in 33 states by 1912, including Milwaukee, Wisconsin; New Haven, Connecticut; Reading, Pennsylvania; and Schenectady, New York. There have been governors elected as independents, and from such parties as Progressive, Reform, Farmer-Labor, Populist, and Prohibition. After losing a Republican primary in 2010, Bill Walker of Alaska won a single term in 2013 as an independent by joining forces with the Democratic nominee. In 1998, wrestler Jesse Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota on the Reform Party ticket.

Sometimes a national officeholder that is not a member of any party is elected. Previously, Senator Lisa Murkowski won re-election in 2010 as a write-in candidate after losing the Republican primary to a Tea party candidate, and Senator Joe Lieberman ran and won reelection to the Senate as an &quot;Independent Democrat&quot; in 2006 after losing the Democratic primary. As of 2025, there are only two U.S. senators, Angus King and Bernie Sanders, who identify as Independent and both caucus with the Democrats.

The last time a third-party candidate carried any states in a presidential race was George Wallace in 1968, while the last third-party candidate to finish runner-up or greater was former president Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s 2nd-place finish on the Bull Moose Party ticket in 1912. The only three U.S. presidents without a major party affiliation upon election were George Washington, John Tyler, and Andrew Johnson, and only Washington served his entire tenure as an independent. Neither of the other two were ever elected president in their own right, both being vice presidents who ascended to office upon the death of the president, and both became independents because they were unpopular with their parties. John Tyler was elected on the Whig ticket in 1840 with William Henry Harrison, but was expelled by his own party. Johnson was the running mate for Abraham Lincoln, who was reelected on the National Union ticket in 1864; it was a temporary name for the Republican Party.

== More favorable electoral systems for third parties ==

=== Electoral fusion ===
=== Ranked-choice voting ===
=== Approval voting ===
=== Proportional representation ===
==Barriers to third party success==
===Winner-take-all vs. proportional representation===
In winner-take-all (or plurality voting), the candidate with the largest number of votes wins, even if the margin of victory is extremely narrow or the proportion of votes received is not a majority. Unlike in proportional representation, runners-up do not gain representation in a first-past-the-post system. In the United States, systems of proportional representation are uncommon, especially above the local level and are entirely absent at the national level (even though states like Maine have introduced systems like ranked-choice voting, which ensures that the voice of third party voters is heard in case none of the candidates receives a majority of preferences). In Presidential elections, the majority requirement of the Electoral College, and the Constitutional provision for the House of Representatives to decide the election if no candidate receives a majority, serves as a further disincentive to third party candidacies.

In the United States, if an interest group is at odds with its traditional party, it has the option of running sympathetic candidates in primaries. Candidates failing in the primary may form or join a third party. Because of the difficulties third parties face in gaining any representation, third parties tend to exist to promote a specific issue or personality. Often, the intent is to force national public attention on such an issue. Then, one or both of the major parties may rise to commit for or against the matter at hand, or at least weigh in. H. Ross Perot eventually founded a third party, the Reform Party, to support his 1996 campaign. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt made a spirited run for the presidency on the Progressive Party ticket, but he never made any efforts to help Progressive congressional candidates in 1914, and in the 1916 election, he supported the Republicans.

Micah Sifry argues that despite years of discontentment with the two major parties in the United States, third parties should try to arise organically at the local level in places where ranked-choice voting and other more democratic systems can build momentum, rather than starting with the presidency, a proposition incredibly unlikely to succeed.

=== Spoiler effect ===

Strategic voting often leads to a third-party that underperforms its poll numbers with voters wanting to make sure their vote helps determine the winner. In response, some third-party candidates express ambivalence about which major party they prefer and their possible role as spoiler or deny the possibility. The US presidential elections most consistently cited as having been spoiled by third-party candidates are 1844, 2000, and 2016. This phenomenon becomes more controversial when a third-party candidate receives help from supporters of another candidate hoping they play a spoiler role.

=== Ballot access laws ===
Nationally, ballot access laws require candidates to pay registration fees and provide signatures if a party has not garnered a certain percentage of votes in previous elections. In recent presidential elections, Ross Perot appeared on all 50 state ballots as an independent in 1992 and the candidate of the Reform Party in 1996. Perot, a billionaire, was able to provide significant funds for his campaigns. Patrick Buchanan appeared on all 50 state ballots in the 2000 election, largely on the basis of Perot&#x27;s performance as the Reform Party&#x27;s candidate four years prior. The Libertarian Party has appeared on the ballot in at least 46 states in every election since 1980, except for 1984 when David Bergland gained access in only 36 states. In 1980, 1992, 1996, 2016, and 2020 the party made the ballot in all 50 states and D.C. The Green Party gained access to 44 state ballots in 2000 but only 27 in 2004. The Constitution Party appeared on 42 state ballots in 2004. Ralph Nader, running as an independent in 2004, appeared on 34 state ballots. In 2008, Nader appeared on 45 state ballots and the D.C. ballot.

===Debate rules===

Presidential debates between the nominees of the two major parties first occurred in 1960, then after three cycles without debates, resumed in 1976. Third party or independent candidates have been in debates in only two cycles. Ronald Reagan and John Anderson debated in 1980, but incumbent President Carter refused to appear with Anderson, and Anderson was excluded from the subsequent debate between Reagan and Carter. Independent Ross Perot was included in all three of the debates with Republican George H. W. Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992, largely at the behest of the Bush campaign. His participation helped Perot climb from 7% before the debates to 19% on Election Day.

Perot did not participate in the 1996 debates. In 2000, revised debate access rules made it even harder for third-party candidates to gain access by stipulating that, besides being on enough state ballots to win an Electoral College majority, debate participants must clear 15% in pre-debate opinion polls. This rule has been in effect since 2000. The 15% criterion, had it been in place, would have prevented Anderson and Perot from participating in the debates in which they appeared. Debates in other state and federal elections often exclude independent and third-party candidates, and the Supreme Court has upheld this practice in several cases. The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) is a private company.

The Free &amp; Equal Elections Foundation hosts various debates and forums with third-party candidates during presidential elections.

===Major parties adopt third-party platforms===
They can draw attention to issues that may be ignored by the majority parties. If such an issue finds acceptance with the voters, one or more of the major parties may adopt the issue into its own party platform. A third-party candidate will sometimes strike a chord with a section of voters in a particular election, bringing an issue to national prominence and amount a significant proportion of the popular vote. Major parties often respond to this by adopting this issue in a subsequent election. After 1968, under President Nixon the Republican Party adopted a &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; to win the support of conservative Democrats opposed to the Civil Rights Movement and resulting legislation and to combat local third parties. This can be seen as a response to the popularity of segregationist candidate George Wallace who gained 13.5% of the popular vote in the 1968 election for the American Independent Party. In 1996, both the Democrats and the Republicans agreed to deficit reduction on the back of Ross Perot&#x27;s popularity in the 1992 election. This severely undermined Perot&#x27;s campaign in the 1996 election.

However, changing positions can be costly for a major party. For example, in the US 2000 Presidential election Magee predicts that Gore shifted his positions to the left to account for Nader, which lost him some valuable centrist voters to Bush. In cases with an extreme minor candidate, not changing positions can help to reframe the more competitive candidate as moderate, helping to attract the most valuable swing voters from their top competitor while losing some voters on the extreme to the less competitive minor candidate.

<doc id="319504" wikidata="Q2164465" url="?curid=319504" title="Speculative execution">
<text>Speculative execution is an optimization technique where a computer system performs some task that may not be needed. Work is done before it is known whether it is actually needed, so as to prevent a delay that would have to be incurred by doing the work after it is known that it is needed. If it turns out the work was not needed after all, most changes made by the work are reverted and the results are ignored.

The objective is to provide more concurrency if extra resources are available. This approach is employed in a variety of areas, including branch prediction in pipelined processors, value prediction for exploiting value locality, prefetching memory and files, and optimistic concurrency control in database systems.

Speculative multithreading is a special case of speculative execution.

==Overview==
Modern pipelined microprocessors use speculative execution to reduce the cost of conditional branch instructions using schemes that predict the execution path of a program based on the history of branch executions. In order to improve performance and utilization of computer resources, instructions can be scheduled at a time when it has not yet been determined that the instructions will need to be executed, ahead of a branch.

==Variants==
&quot;Speculative computation&quot; was a related earlier concept.

===Eager execution===
Eager execution is a form of speculative execution where both sides of the conditional branch are executed; however, the results are committed only if the predicate is true. With unlimited resources, eager execution (also known as &quot;oracle execution&quot;) would in theory provide the same performance as perfect branch prediction. With limited resources, eager execution should be employed carefully, since the number of resources needed grows exponentially with each level of branch executed eagerly.

===Predictive execution===

Predictive execution is a form of speculative execution where some outcome is predicted and execution proceeds along the predicted path until the actual result is known. If the prediction is true, the predicted execution is allowed to commit; however, if there is a misprediction, execution has to be unrolled and re-executed. Common forms of this include branch predictors and memory dependence prediction. A generalized form is sometimes referred to as value prediction.

===Runahead===
==Related concepts==

===Lazy execution===
Lazy execution is the opposite of eager execution, and does not involve speculation. The incorporation of speculative execution into implementations of the Haskell programming language, a lazy language, is a current research topic. Eager Haskell, a variant of the language, is designed around the idea of speculative execution. A 2003 PhD thesis made GHC support a kind of speculative execution with an abortion mechanism to back out in case of a bad choice called &quot;optimistic execution&quot;. It was deemed too complicated.

==Security vulnerabilities==

Starting in 2017, a series of security vulnerabilities were found in the implementations of speculative execution on common processor architectures which effectively enabled an elevation of privileges.

These include:
* Foreshadow
* Meltdown
* Microarchitectural Data Sampling
* Spectre
* SPOILER
* Pacman

== See also ==
* Anticiparallelism
* Out-of-order execution
* Slipstream (computer science)
* Speculative multithreading
* Hardware security bug
* Transient execution CPU vulnerability

<text>The Quebec sovereignty movement (, ) is a political movement whose objective is to achieve the independence of Quebec from Canada. Sovereignists suggest that the people of Quebec make use of their right to self-determination a principle that includes the possibility of choosing between integration with a third state, political association with another state or independence so that Québécois, collectively and by democratic means, give themselves a sovereign state with its own independent constitution.

Quebec sovereigntists believe that such a sovereign state, the Quebec nation, would be better equipped to promote its own economic, social, ecological, and cultural development. Quebec&#x27;s sovereignist movement is based on Quebec nationalism.

==Overview==

The goal of Quebec&#x27;s sovereignist movement is to make Quebec an independent state. In practice, the terms &quot;independentist, sovereignist,&quot; and &quot;separatist&quot; are used to describe people adhering to this movement, although the latter term is perceived as pejorative by those concerned as it de-emphasizes that the sovereignty project aims to achieve political independence without severing economic connections with Canada. Most of the prime ministers of Canada&#x27;s speeches use the term &quot;sovereignist&quot; in French to moderate remarks made on the Quebec electorate. In English, the term &quot;separatist&quot; is often used to accentuate negative dimensions of the movement.

The idea of Quebec sovereignty is based on a nationalist vision and interpretation of historical facts and sociological realities in Quebec, which attest to the existence of a Québécois people and a Quebec nation. On November 27, 2006, the House of Commons of Canada adopted, by 266 votes to 16, a motion recognizing that “Québécois form a nation within a united Canada”. On November 30, the National Assembly of Quebec unanimously adopted a motion recognizing &quot;the positive character&quot; of the motion adopted by Ottawa and proclaiming that said motion did not diminish &quot;the inalienable rights, the constitutional powers and the privileges of the “National Assembly and of the Quebec nation”.

Sovereignists believe that the natural final outcome of the Québécois people&#x27;s collective adventure and development is the achievement of political independence, which is only possible if Quebec becomes a sovereign state and if its inhabitants not only govern themselves through independent democratic political institutions, but are also free to establish external relations and makes international treaties without the federal government of Canada being involved.

Through parliamentarism, Québécois currently possess a certain democratic control over the Quebec state. However, within the Canadian federation, Quebec does not have all the constitutional powers that would allow it to act as a true national government. Furthermore, the policies pursued by Quebec and those pursued by the federal government often come into conflict. Various attempts to reform the Canadian federal system have failed (most notably the defunct Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords), due to conflicting interests between the sovereignist and federalist elites of Quebec, as well as with English Canada (see Constitutional Debate in Canada).

Although Quebec&#x27;s independence movement is a political movement, cultural and social concerns that are much older than the sovereignist movement, as well as Quebecers&#x27; national identity, are also at the base for the desire to emancipate Quebec&#x27;s population. One of the main cultural arguments sovereigntists cite is that if Quebec were independent, Québécois would have a national citizenship, which would solve the problem of Québécois cultural identity in the North American context (ex. who is a Québécois and who is not, what is uniquely Québécois, etc.). Another example is that by establishing an independent Quebec, sovereigntists believe that the culture of Québécois and their collective memory will be adequately protected, in particular against cultural appropriation by other nations, such as the incident with Canada&#x27;s national anthem, originally a French Canadian patriotic song appropriated by the anglophone majority of Canada.

==History==
=== Before the 1960s ===

&quot;Sovereignty&quot; and &quot;sovereignism&quot; are terms derived from the modern independence movement, which started during the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. However, the roots of Quebecers&#x27; desire for political autonomy are much older than that.

Francophone nationalism in North America dates back to 1534, the year Jacques Cartier landed in the Gespe&#x27;gewa&#x27;gi district of Miꞌkmaꞌki claiming Canada for France, and more particularly to 1608, the year of the founding of Québec by Samuel de Champlain, the first permanent settlement for French colonists and their descendants in New France (who were called Canadiens, Canayens or Habitants). Following the British conquest of New France, the &quot; movement&quot;, which lasted from 1760 to the late 18th century and sought to restore the traditional rights of French Canadians that had been abolished by the British with the Royal Proclamation of 1763, began. During this period, French Canadians began to express an indigenous form of nationalism which emphasized their longstanding residence in North America. To most French Canadians, the only Canadians were the descendants of the French settlers of New France, while the British colonists were viewed as an extension of Britain. The period was briefly interrupted by the Quebec Act of 1774, which granted certain rights to but did not truly satisfy them, and was notably exacerbated by the Treaty of Paris (1783), which ceded parts of the Quebec to the United States, and the Constitutional Act of 1791, which established the Westminster system.

&quot;The Patriote movement&quot; was the period lasting from the beginning of the 19th century to the defeat of the Patriotes at the Battle of Saint-Eustache in 1837, the final battle in the Patriotes War. It began with the founding of the Parti Canadien by the . It stands out for its notorious resistance to the influence of the Château Clique, a group of wealthy families in Lower Canada in the early 19th century who were the Lower Canadian equivalent of the Family Compact in Upper Canada.

 is the period beginning after the defeat of the Patriotes in the rebellions of 1837–1838 and lasting until the Quiet Revolution. It concerns the survival strategies employment by the French-Canadian nation and the ultramontane of the Catholic Church following the enactment of the Act of Union of 1840 which established a system whose goal was to force the cultural and linguistic assimilation of French Canadians into English-Canadian culture. In addition to , a phlegmatic character was adopted in response to the mass immigration of English-speaking immigrants. Some French Canadians left Quebec during this period in search of job security and protection of their culture. This phenomenon, known as the , is the origin of the Quebec diaspora in New England and Northeastern Ontario among other places. It led to the creation of permanent resistance movements in those new locations. Groups of nationalists outside Quebec have since then promoted Quebec&#x27;s cultural identity, along with that of the Acadians in the Maritime provinces and in Louisiana, represented by the since 1881. Louis-Alexandre Taschereau coming to power in 1920 created an upheaval in French-Canadian society for most of the interwar period. The confrontations and divergence of political opinions led to the rise of a new form of nationalism, called clerico-nationalism, promoted by Maurice Duplessis and the Union Nationale party during the Grande Noirceur of 1944 to 1959.

During the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s to 1970s, the modern &quot;Québécois sovereignist movement&quot; took off, with René Lévesque as one of its most recognizable figures. Various strategies were implemented since its rise, and it constitutes a continuity in French-speaking nationalism in North America. Now the patriotism is Quebec-focused, and the identifier has been changed from French-Canadian nationalism or identity to Québécois nationalism or identity.

===The Quiet Revolution (1960s-1970s)===
The Quiet Revolution in Quebec brought widespread change in the 1960s. Among other changes, support for Quebec independence began to form and grow in some circles. The first organization dedicated to the independence of Quebec was the Alliance Laurentienne, founded by Raymond Barbeau on January 25, 1957.

On September 10, 1960, the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale (RIN) was founded, with Pierre Bourgault quickly becoming its leader. On August 9 of the same year, the Action socialiste pour l&#x27;indépendance du Québec (ASIQ) was formed by Raoul Roy. The &quot;independence + socialism&quot; project of the ASIQ was a source of political ideas for the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ).

On October 31, 1962, the Comité de libération nationale and, in November of the same year, the Réseau de résistance were set up. These two groups were formed by RIN members to organize non-violent but illegal actions, such as vandalism and civil disobedience. The most extremist individuals of these groups left to form the FLQ, which, unlike all the other groups, had made the decision to resort to violence in order to reach its goal of independence for Quebec. Shortly after the November 14, 1962, Quebec general election, RIN member Marcel Chaput founded the short-lived Parti républicain du Québec.

In February 1963, the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) was founded by three Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale members who had met each other as part of the Réseau de résistance. They were Georges Schoeters, Raymond Villeneuve, and Gabriel Hudon.

In 1964, the RIN became a provincial political party. In 1965, the more conservative Ralliement national (RN) also became a party.

During this period, the Estates General of French Canada are organized. The stated objective of these Estates General was to consult the French-Canadian people on their constitutional future.

The historical context of the time was a period when many former European colonies were becoming independent. Some advocates of Quebec independence saw Quebec&#x27;s situation in a similar light; numerous activists were influenced by the writings of Frantz Fanon, Albert Memmi, and Karl Marx. 

In June 1967, French president Charles de Gaulle, who had recently granted independence to Algeria, shouted &quot;&quot; during a speech from the balcony of Montreal&#x27;s city hall during a state visit to Canada. In doing so, he deeply offended the federal government, and English Canadians felt he had demonstrated contempt for the sacrifice of Canadian soldiers who died on the battlefields of France in two world wars. The visit was cut short and de Gaulle left the country.

Finally, in October 1967, former Liberal cabinet minister René Lévesque left that party when it refused to discuss sovereignty at a party convention. Lévesque formed the Mouvement souveraineté-association and set about uniting pro-sovereignty forces.

He achieved that goal in October 1968 when the MSA held its only national congress in Quebec City. The RN and MSA agreed to merge to form the Parti Québécois (PQ), and later that month Pierre Bourgault, leader of the RIN, dissolved his party and invited its members to join the PQ.

Meanwhile, in 1969 the FLQ stepped up its campaign of violence, which would culminate in what would become known as the October Crisis. The group claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Montreal Stock Exchange, and in 1970 the FLQ kidnapped British Trade Commissioner James Cross and Quebec Labour Minister Pierre Laporte; Laporte was later found murdered.

Jacques Parizeau joined the Parti Québécois on September 19, 1969, and Jérôme Proulx of the Union Nationale joined on November 11 of the same year.

In the 1970 provincial election, the PQ won its first seven seats in the National Assembly. René Lévesque was defeated in Mont-Royal by the Liberal André Marchand.

===The referendum of 1980===
In the 1976 election, the PQ won 71 seats — a majority in the National Assembly. With voting turnouts high, 41.4 percent of the electorate voted for the PQ. Prior to the election, the PQ renounced its intention to implement sovereignty-association if it won power.

On August 26, 1977, the PQ passed two main laws: first, the law on the financing of political parties, which prohibits contributions by corporations and unions and set a limit on individual donations, and second, the Charter of the French Language.

On May 17 PQ Member of the National Assembly Robert Burns resigned, telling the press he was convinced that the PQ was going to lose its referendum and fail to be re-elected afterwards.

At its seventh national convention from June 1 to 3, 1979, the adopted their strategy for the coming referendum. The PQ then began an aggressive effort to promote sovereignty-association by providing details of how the economic relations with the rest of Canada would include free trade between Canada and Quebec, common tariffs against imports, and a common currency. In addition, joint political institutions would be established to administer these economic arrangements.

Sovereignty-association was proposed to the population of Quebec in the 1980 Quebec referendum. The proposal was rejected by 60 percent of the Quebec electorate.

In September, the PQ created a national committee of Anglophones and a liaison committee with ethnic minorities.

The PQ was returned to power in the 1981 election with a stronger majority than in 1976, obtaining 49.2 percent of the vote and winning 80 seats. However, they did not hold a referendum in their second term, and put sovereignty on hold, concentrating on their stated goal of &quot;good government&quot;.

René Lévesque retired in 1985 (and died in 1987). In the 1985 election under his successor Pierre-Marc Johnson, the PQ was defeated by the Liberal Party.

====Sovereignty-association====
The history of the relations between French-Canadians and English-Canadians in Canada has been marked by periods of tension. After colonizing Canada from 1608 onward, France lost the colony to Great Britain at the conclusion of the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1763, in which France ceded control of New France (except for the two small islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon) to Great Britain, which returned the French West Indian islands they had captured in the 1763 Treaty of Paris.

Under British rule, French Canadians were supplanted by waves of British immigrants, notably outside of Quebec (where they became a minority) but within the province as well, as much of the province&#x27;s economy was dominated by English-Canadians. The cause of Québécois nationalism, which waxed and waned over two centuries, gained prominence from the 1960s onward. The use of the word &quot;sovereignty&quot; and many of the ideas of this movement originated in the 1967 Mouvement Souveraineté-Association of René Lévesque. This movement ultimately gave birth to the Parti Québécois in 1968.

Sovereignty-association () is the combination of two concepts:

# The achievement of sovereignty for the Quebec state.
# The creation of a political and economic association between this new independent state and Canada.

It was first presented in Lévesque&#x27;s political manifesto, &quot;Option Québec&quot;.

The Parti Québécois defines sovereignty as the power for a state to levy all its taxes, vote on all its laws, and sign all its treaties (as mentioned in the 1980 referendum question).

The type of association between an independent Quebec and the rest of Canada was described as a monetary and customs union as well as joint political institutions to administer the relations between the two countries. The main inspiration for this project was the then-emerging European Community. In &quot;Option Québec&quot; Lévesque expressly identified the EC as his model for forming a new relationship between sovereign Quebec and the rest of Canada, one that would loosen the political ties while preserving the economic links. The analogy, however, is counterproductive, suggesting Lévesque did not understand the nature and purpose of the European Community nor the relationship between economics and politics that continue to underpin it. Advocates of European integration had, from the outset, seen political union as a desirable and natural consequence of economic integration.

The hyphen between the words &quot;sovereignty&quot; and &quot;association&quot; was often stressed by Lévesque and other PQ members, to make it clear that both were inseparable. The reason stated was that if Canada decided to boycott Quebec exports after voting for independence, the new country would have to go through difficult economic times, as the barriers to trade between Canada and the United States were then very high. Quebec would have been a nation of 7 million people stuck between two impenetrable protectionist countries. In the event of having to compete against Quebec, rather than support it, Canada could easily maintain its well-established links with the United States to prosper in foreign trade.

Sovereignty-association as originally proposed would have meant that Quebec would become a politically independent state, but would maintain a formal association with Canada — especially regarding economic affairs. It was part of the 1976 platform which swept the Parti Québécois into power in that year&#x27;s provincial elections – and included a promise to hold a referendum on sovereignty-association. René Lévesque developed the idea of sovereignty-association to reduce the fear that an independent Quebec would face tough economic times. In fact, this proposal did result in an increase in support for a sovereign Quebec: polls at the time showed that people were more likely to support independence if Quebec maintained an economic partnership with Canada. This line of politics led the outspoken Yvon Deschamps to proclaim that what Quebecers want is an independent Quebec inside a strong Canada, thereby comparing the movement to a spoiled child that has everything it could desire and still wants more.

In 1979 the PQ began an aggressive effort to promote sovereignty-association by providing details of how the economic relations with the rest of Canada would include free trade between Canada and Quebec, common tariffs against imports, and a common currency. In addition, joint political institutions would be established to administer these economic arrangements. But the cause was hurt by the refusal of many politicians (most notably the premiers of several of the other provinces) to support the idea of negotiations with an independent Quebec, contributing to the Yes side losing by a vote of 60 percent to 40 percent.

This loss laid the groundwork for the 1995 referendum, which stated that Quebec should offer a new economic and political partnership to Canada before declaring independence. An English translation of part of the Sovereignty Bill reads, &quot;We, the people of Quebec, declare it our own will to be in full possession of all the powers of a state; to levy all our taxes, to vote on all our laws, to sign all our treaties and to exercise the highest power of all, conceiving, and controlling, by ourselves, our fundamental law.&quot;

This time, the lost in a very close vote: 50.6 percent to 49.4 percent, or only 53,498 votes out of more than 4,700,000 votes cast. However, after the vote many within the camp were very upset that the vote broke down heavily along language lines. Approximately 90 percent of English speakers and allophones (mostly immigrants and first-generation Quebecers whose native language is neither French or English) Quebecers voted against the referendum, while almost 60 percent of Francophones voted Yes. Quebec premier Jacques Parizeau, whose government supported sovereignty, attributed the defeat of the resolution to &quot;money and ethnic votes.&quot; His opinion caused an outcry among English-speaking Quebecers, and he resigned following the referendum.

An inquiry by the director-general of elections concluded in 2007 that at least $500,000 was spent by the federalist camp in violation of Quebec&#x27;s election laws. This law imposes a limit on campaign spending by both option camps. Parizeau&#x27;s statement was also an admission of failure by the Yes camp in getting the newly arrived Quebecers to adhere to their political option.

Accusations of an orchestrated effort of &quot;election engineering&quot; in several polling stations in areas with large numbers of non-francophone voters, which resulted in unusually large proportions of rejected ballots, were raised following the 1995 referendum. Afterward, testimony by PQ-appointed polling clerks indicated that they were ordered by PQ-appointed overseers to reject ballots in these polling stations for frivolous reasons that were not covered in the election laws.

While opponents of sovereignty were pleased with the defeat of the referendum, most recognized that there were still deep divides within Quebec and problems with the relationship between Quebec and the rest of the country.

===The referendum of 1995===
The PQ returned to power in the 1994 election under Jacques Parizeau, this time with 44.75% of the popular vote. In the intervening years, the failures of the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord had revived support for sovereignty, which had been written off as a dead issue for much of the 1980s.

Another consequence of the failure of the Meech Lake Accord was the formation of the Bloc Québécois (BQ), a federal political party, under the leadership of the charismatic former Progressive Conservative federal cabinet minister Lucien Bouchard. Several PC and Liberal members of the federal parliament left their parties to form the BQ. For the first time, the PQ supported pro-sovereigntist forces running in federal elections; during his lifetime Lévesque had always opposed such a move.

The Union Populaire had nominated candidates in the 1979 and 1980 federal elections, and the Parti nationaliste du Québec had nominated candidates in the 1984 election, but neither of these parties enjoyed the official support of the PQ; nor did they enjoy significant public support among Quebecers.

In the 1993 federal election, which featured the collapse of Progressive Conservative Party support, the BQ won enough seats in Parliament to become Her Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition in the House of Commons.

At the Royal Commission on the Future of Quebec (also known as the Outaouais Commission) in 1995, the Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada made a presentation in which the party leader, Hardial Bains, recommended to the committee that Quebec declare itself as an independent republic.

Parizeau promptly advised the Lieutenant Governor to call a new referendum. The 1995 referendum question differed from the 1980 question in that the negotiation of an association with Canada was now optional. The open-ended wording of the question resulted in significant confusion, particularly amongst the &#x27;Yes&#x27; side, as to what exactly they were voting for. This was a primary motivator for the creation of the &quot;Clarity Act&quot; (see below).

The &quot;No&quot; campaign won, but only by a very small margin — 50.6% to 49.4%. As in the previous referendum, the English-speaking (anglophone) minority in Quebec overwhelmingly (about 90%) rejected sovereignty, support for sovereignty was also weak among allophones (native speakers of neither English nor French) in immigrant communities and first-generation descendants. The lowest support for the Yes side came from Mohawk, Cree, and Inuit voters in Quebec, some first Nations chiefs asserted their right to self-determination with the Cree being particularly vocal in their right to stay territories within Canada. More than 96% of the Inuit and Cree voted No in the referendum. However, The Innu, Attikamek, Algonquin and Abenaki nations did partially support Quebec sovereignty. In 1985, 59 percent of Quebec&#x27;s Inuit population, 56 percent of the Attikamek population, and 49 percent of the Montagnais population voted in favour of the Sovereignist Parti Québécois party. That year, three out of every four native reservations gave a majority to the Parti Québécois party.

By contrast almost 60 percent of francophones of all origins voted &quot;Yes&quot;. (82 percent of Quebecers are Francophone.) Later inquiries into irregularities determined that abuses had occurred on both sides: some argue that some &quot;No&quot; ballots had been rejected without valid reasons, and the October 27 &quot;No&quot; rally had evaded spending limitations because of out-of-province participation. An inquiry by &quot;Le Directeur général des élections&quot; concluded in 2007 that the &quot;No&quot; camp had exceeded the campaign spending limits by $500,000.

===The 1998 Quebec general election===
Expecting Bouchard to announce another referendum if his party won the 1998 Quebec general election, the leaders of all other provinces and territories gathered for the Calgary Declaration in September 1997 to discuss how to oppose the sovereignty movement. Saskatchewan&#x27;s Roy Romanow warned &quot;It&#x27;s two or three minutes to midnight&quot;. Bouchard did not accept his invitation; organizers did not invite Chrétien. Experts debated whether Quebec was a &quot;distinct society&quot; or &quot;unique culture&quot;.

The Parti Québécois won re-election despite losing the popular vote to Jean Charest and the Quebec Liberals. In the number of seats won by both sides, the election was almost a clone of the previous 1994 election. However, public support for sovereignty remained too low for the PQ to consider holding a second referendum during their second term. Meanwhile, the federal government passed the &quot;Clarity Act&quot; to govern the wording of any future referendum questions and the conditions under which a vote for sovereignty would be recognized as legitimate. Federal Liberal politicians stated that the ambiguous wording of the 1995 referendum question was the primary impetus in the bill&#x27;s drafting.

While opponents of sovereignty were pleased with their referendum victories, most recognized that there are still deep divides within Quebec and problems with the relationship between Quebec and the rest of Canada.

===The Clarity Act===
In 1999, the Parliament of Canada, at the urging of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, passed the &quot;Clarity Act&quot;, a law that, amongst other things, set out the conditions under which the Crown-in-Council would recognize a vote by any province to leave Canada. It required a majority of eligible voters for a vote to trigger secession talks, not merely a plurality of votes. In addition, the act requires a clear question of secession to initiate secession talks. Controversially, the act gave the House of Commons the power to decide whether a proposed referendum question was considered clear, and allowed it to decide whether a clear majority has expressed itself in any referendum. It is widely considered by as an illegitimate piece of legislation, who asserted that Quebec alone had the right to determine its terms of secession. Chrétien considered the legislation among his most significant accomplishments.

===From 2000 to the present===
&quot;Sovereignty-Association&quot; is nowadays more often referred to simply as &quot;sovereignty&quot;. However, in the 1995 Quebec referendum, in which the sovereignty option was narrowly rejected, the notion of some form of economic association with the rest of Canada was still envisaged (continuing use of the Canadian dollar and military, for example) and was referred to as &quot;Sovereignty-Partnership&quot; (). It remains a part of the PQ program and is tied to national independence in the minds of most Quebecers. This part of the PQ program has always been controversial, especially since Canadian federal politicians usually refuse the concept.

In 2003, the PQ launched the (&quot;Season of ideas&quot;) which is a public consultation aiming to gather the opinions of Quebecers on its sovereignty project. The new program and the revised sovereignty project was adopted at the 2005 Congress.

In the 2003 election, the PQ lost power to the Liberal Party. However, in early 2004, the Liberal government of Paul Martin had proved to be unpopular, and that, combined with the federal Liberal Party sponsorship scandal, contributed to a resurgence of the BQ. In the 2004 federal elections, the Bloc Québécois won 54 of Quebec&#x27;s 75 seats in the House of Commons, compared to 33 previously. However, in the 2006 federal elections the BQ lost three seats and in the 2008 federal elections lost two additional seats, bringing their total down to 49, but was still the most popular federal party in Quebec up until the 2011 Canadian federal election, when the BQ was devastated by the federalist NDP, with the Bloc at a total of four seats and the loss of official party status in the Commons (compared to the NDP&#x27;s 59 seats, Conservatives&#x27; five seats, and the Liberals&#x27; seven seats in Quebec).

Polling data by Angus Reid in June 2009 showed the support for Quebec separation was weaker at the time and separatism unlikely to occur in the near future. Polling data showed that 32% of Quebecers believe that Quebec had enough sovereignty and should remain part of Canada, 28% thought they should separate, and 30% say they believe that Quebec does need greater sovereignty but should remain part of Canada. However the poll did reveal that a majority (79%) of Quebecers still desired to achieve more autonomy. The number one area of autonomy that those polled had hoped for was with regard to culture at 34%, the next highest areas of autonomy cherished were the economy at 32%, taxation at 26%, and immigration and the environment at 15% each.

The 2009 Angus Reid poll also revealed some effects of the Clarity Act in which they asked two questions, one a straightforward question for a separate nation, and the other a more muddled version on separation similar to the one posed in the 1995 referendum. The data on the questions revealed as follows to the first hard line question of &quot;Do you believe that Quebec should become a country separate from Canada?&quot; 34% replied yes, 54% said no, and 13% were unsure. To the less clear question of &quot;Do you agree that Quebec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership within a scope of the bill respecting the future of Quebec?&quot; support for separation increased to 40% yes, the no vote still led with 41%, and the unsure increased to 19%. The most startling revelation of the poll was in the fact that only 20% or 1 in 5 polled believed that Quebec would ever separate from Canada.

2011 was considered a watershed year for the movement. In the aftermath of the 2011 federal election, Léger Marketing and pro- newspaper &quot;Le Devoir&quot; conducted a poll on the question. When asked whether they would vote Yes or No in the event of a referendum, 41% of the respondents said they would vote Yes. In 2011, the movement splintered, with several new parties being formed by disaffected politicians, with some politicians dissatisfied with slow progress towards independence, and others hoping to put the sovereignty question on the backburner. Leadership by PQ leader Pauline Marois was divisive.

During the 2015 federal election, the Bloc Québécois managed to win 10 seats, in the 2019 election the BQ increased its number of seats from 10 in 2015, to 32 seats in 2019, both overtaking the NDP to become the third largest party in Canada and regaining official party status.

In the 2021 Canadian federal election, the BQ won 32 seats, unchanged from the prior election.

In 2021, François Legault&#x27;s Coalition Avenir Québec government in Quebec proposed to amend the Charter of the French Language and the provincial constitution to more strongly entrench French as the sole official language. In response to this, the Bloc Québécois initiated a motion in the House of Commons endorsing the constitutionality of Legault&#x27;s initiatives. The Commons passed the motion 281–2.

==Arguments==
===Reasons for sovereignty===
Justifications for Quebec&#x27;s sovereignty are historically nationalistic in character, claiming the unique culture and French-speaking majority (78% of the provincial population) are threatened with assimilation by either the rest of Canada or, as in Metropolitan France, by Anglophone culture more generally, and that the best way to preserve language, identity and culture is via the creation of an independent political entity. Other distinguishing factors, such as religious differences (given the Catholic majority in Quebec), are also used to justify either separation or nationalist social policies advocated by the Parti Québécois.

The historical argument for Quebec independence stems from the region&#x27;s history, as it was conquered by the British in 1760 and ceded to Great Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris; French Canadians in Canada were subsumed by waves of British immigrants. This argument makes the claim that Quebecers have the right of self-determination.

Eight of the other Canadian provinces are overwhelmingly (greater than 95%) English-speaking, while New Brunswick is officially bilingual and about one-third Francophone. Another rationale is based on resentment of anti-Quebec sentiment. With regard to the creation of the movement, language issues were but a sub-stratum of larger cultural, social and political differences. Many scholars point to historical events as framing the cause for ongoing support for sovereignty in Quebec, while more contemporary politicians may point to the aftermath of more recent developments like the &quot;Canada Act&quot; of 1982, the Meech Lake Accord or the Charlottetown Accord.

===Arguments against sovereignty===
It has been argued by prominent Quebecers ( and ex-, including former Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard) that sovereignty politics has distracted Quebecers from the real economic problems of Quebec, and that sovereignty by itself cannot solve those problems. In 2005 they published their position statement, &quot;Pour un Québec lucide&quot;, (&quot;For a lucid Quebec&quot;) which details the problems facing Quebec.

Some arguments against sovereignty claim that the movement is illegitimate because of its Eurocentrism which alienates many among Canada&#x27;s First Nations, as well as the Inuit, and Métis peoples and their sympathizers. This sentiment is summed up by a quotation from a Mohawk from Akwsasne: &quot;How can Quebec, with no economic base and no land base, ask to become sovereign? How can Quebec be a nation when they have no constitution? We have had a constitution since before the American revolution.&quot; Here the argument expresses the claim that the Mohawk nation has a greater case for self-determination due to already having a more legitimate claim to distinct nationhood that is based on traditional lands and a constitution predating confederation as well as the creation of Quebec and a Québécois identity.

Similarly, the Cree have also asserted for many years that they are a separate people with the right to self-determination recognized under international law. They argue that no annexation of them or their territory to an independent Quebec should take place without their consent, and that if Quebec has the right to leave Canada then the Cree people have the right to choose to keep their territory in Canada. Cree arguments generally do not claim the right to secede from Canada; rather, the Cree see themselves as a people bound to Canada by treaty (see the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement), and as citizens of Canada. The Cree have stated that a unilateral declaration of independence by Quebec would be a violation of fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and consent. If secession were to proceed, the Cree argue that they would seek protection through the Canadian courts as well as asserting Cree jurisdiction over its people and lands.

Professor Peter Russell has said of Aboriginal peoples in Canada: &quot;(they) are not nations that can be yanked out of Canada against their will by a provincial majority... With few exceptions (they) wish to enjoy their right to self-government within Canada, not within a sovereign Quebec.&quot; International human rights expert Erica-Irene Daes says the change &quot;will leave the most marginalized and excluded of all the world&#x27;s peoples without a legal, peaceful weapon to press for genuine democracy...&quot; This concern is connected to the claim that if Quebec were to be considered its own autonomous nation-state then it need not honour the treaties and agreements that were signed between First Nations and the British and French Crowns and are now maintained by the Canadian federal government. Concern for this may stem from perception of neo-colonial or eurocentric attitudes in the leadership of former Quebec premiers, such as Robert Bourassa, the self-proclaimed &quot;Conqueror of the North&quot;.

==Opinions in Quebec==

=== Francophones ===
The sovereignty movement draws its largest support from the francophones of Quebec, and from all sides of the political spectrum. Francophones from Quebec City and more rural regions are thought to support the idea more, while people in Gatineau may do so less, perhaps due to their proximity to or jobs in Ottawa.
=== Anglophones ===
Sovereignty has historically had little support among Anglo-Quebecers. Some anglophone Quebecers see the movement as a rejection of non-Francophones, or as an attempt to suppress their English language and deny the historical Anglophone contribution to Quebec. Some opponents may also view the project as ethnically exclusive. 

=== Immigrants and Allophones ===
Support for sovereignty varies greatly among different immigrant or allophone communities, and it has also changed throughout the decades. In the 1995 referendum, Haitian, Arab and Latin American immigrant communities voted &quot;Yes&quot;, though for the rest the &quot;No&quot; won out. 

=== Aboriginals ===
Various Indigenous peoples in Quebec, such as Cree and Inuit, have historically opposed the independence of Quebec, mostly due to worries about territorial rights.
==Economic effect==
One study found that Quebec&#x27;s separatist governments did not have a large negative impact on Quebec&#x27;s economy as sometimes seen with other independence movements in other countries possibly due to a lack of violence.

==External positions==

=== Rest of Canada ===
The other nine provinces of Canada have generally been opposed to Quebec sovereignty.

===France===
Quebec&#x27;s independence movement has benefited from support and encouragement from France. 

One of the best-known is General Charles de Gaulle, author of the declaration &quot;Vive le Québec libre!&quot;. This declaration is consistent with the thinking of General de Gaulle, who was attached to the idea of the independence of nations and sensitive to the historical impact of France&#x27;s loss of Canada.

In September 1965, General de Gaulle told Alain Peyrefitte: “The future of French Canada is independence. There will be a French Republic of Canada”. According to Alain Peyrefitte, “without prejudging the form that Quebec sovereignty was to take, de Gaulle, with that historic sense which earned France its salvation, went to Montreal in July 1967 to urge French Canadians to preserve their French identity, which, under Louis XV, the indifference of the French elites had made such light work of.

Similarly, when the French ambassador in Ottawa suggested associating France with Canada&#x27;s centenary, De Gaulle replied with an apostille dated December 6, 1966: “There is no question of my sending a message to Canada to celebrate its ‘centenary’. We can have good relations with the whole of what is now Canada. We must have excellent relations with French Canada. But we should not congratulate Canadians or ourselves on the creation of a “state” based on our defeat in the past, and on the integration of part of the French people into a British entity. Incidentally, this whole has become quite precarious...”.

The French Foreign Office&#x27;s current motto epitomizes the official position of the French State concerning Quebec&#x27;s national question: &quot;non-ingérence et non-indifférence&quot; (&quot;no interference and no indifference&quot;). In other words, while Quebec stays within Canada, France will officially support the Canadian Confederation the way it is.

Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has stated on the record that he opposes the separation of Quebec from Canada. This changed back to the view of the French Foreign Office under Sarkozy&#x27;s successor, François Hollande.

===United States===
The United States has officially always maintained a neutral attitude towards Quebec independence. However, since the relationship between Canada and the United States is privileged at various levels, the status quo is desired. In the event of a victory for the independence option in the 1995 referendum, Washington would have stated that “since Canadians have yet to work out their future constitutional arrangements, it is premature to consider the question of recognizing Quebec ”. Thus, it is thought that, in the event of independence, the United States would be passive and wait for Canada itself to recognize the Quebec state.

The sovereigntists of the 1960s and 1970s, led by René Lévesque, believed they could easily win American sympathy for their cause, because they equated Quebec&#x27;s independence with the United States&#x27; American Revolution against Great Britain in 1776. For 20th-century Americans, however, the idea of Quebec&#x27;s separation was more akin to the most painful episode in their history, the American Civil War. What&#x27;s more, the founding myth of the American melting pot made them resistant to any idea of intrastate nationalism. 

John F. Kennedy is said to be the only American politician open to this prospect. In the 1950s, Armand Morissette, the parish priest of Lowell, Massachusetts, informed him of the existence of an independence movement in Quebec. In order to gain access to the Senate, Kennedy wanted to win the votes of the large French-Canadian community in Massachusetts, so he had contact with Curé Morissette, who was also a convinced independentist. Kennedy drew parallels not with American independence, but with Irish independence, which was still quite recent (1922), as he himself was of Irish descent. The Kennedy family were Francophiles, and that the future president militated for the self-determination of peoples in general. During his short term as President (1960–1963), however, Kennedy never publicly addressed this issue.

==In fiction==

* Richard Rohmer&#x27;s novel &quot;Separation&quot; (1976) was turned into a TV-movie for CTV Television in 1977. In the movie, the Parti Québécois has formed the government of Quebec but Premier Gaston Bélisle has repeatedly put off its promise to hold a referendum. International politics forces Bélisle&#x27;s hand.
* In the mid-1980s, a sequel to Separation, &quot;Quebec-Canada 1995&quot;, depicts a meeting between the president of Quebec and the prime minister of Canada to discuss a crisis involving Quebec military occupations of parts of Ontario and New Brunswick. Canada&#x27;s armed forces are stretched thin with peacekeepers in such varied places as the Falkland Islands (with &quot;Lady Goosegreen&quot; being Margaret Thatcher).
* In the film &quot;Die Hard&quot;, Hans Gruber, the terrorist leader, demands, as a ruse, the release of imprisoned members of the fictional group Liberté du Québec. (Presumably meant to be a fictional version of the FLQ.)
* In the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer to the Max&quot;, Homer Simpson is invited to an exclusive garden party by Trent Steel, a successful businessman whom he meets as a result of changing his name to Max Power. President Bill Clinton, a guest at the garden party, is called away to deal with Quebec &#x27;getting the bomb&#x27;.
* In &quot;The Critic&quot; episode &quot;L.A. Jay&quot;, in a dream sequence, Jay Sherman, at his Oscar acceptance speech says he supports independence for Quebec, cutting to a room of Québécois saying &quot;Viva Jay Sherman! Viva Quebec!&quot; and unfurling a banner depicting Sherman as a beaver.

* William Weintraub&#x27;s satirical 1979 novel &quot;The Underdogs&quot; provoked controversy by imagining a future Quebec in which English-speakers were an oppressed minority, complete with a violent resistance movement. One planned stage version was cancelled before its premiere.
* Margaret Atwood&#x27;s 1979 novel &quot;Life Before Man&quot; is set in Toronto in the late 1970s and several characters watch and sometimes comment upon the elections and sovereignist movement in Quebec. The sovereignist movement and its struggles are metaphorically linked to the difficulties the characters in the novel have with separating their own personal relationships.
* Clive Cussler&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;Night Probe!&quot; is set against a fictional attempt at secession in the late 1980s. Rights to newly discovered oil resources in Ungava Bay, discovered as Quebec moves to secede, clash with the ramifications of a rediscovered secret treaty negotiated between the U.K. and U.S. governments during World War I.
* In the 1999 novel &quot;Babylon Babies&quot; by the French-born Canadian cyberpunk writer Maurice Dantec, loosely adapted as the film Babylon A.D., Quebec is independent and referred to as the &quot;Free Province of Quebec&quot;.
* In Peter Watts&#x27; science fiction series, starting with the 1999 &quot;Starfish&quot;, Quebec has attained sovereignty and is an energetic/economic superpower within North America.
* In the alternate history 1995 novel &quot;The Two Georges&quot;, co-authored by Richard Dreyfuss and Harry Turtledove, the American Revolution never occurs, resulting in the creation of the North American Union, a dominion of the British Empire. En route to the Six Nations, Thomas Bushell and Samuel Stanley of the Royal American Mounted Police discuss the nearby province of Quebec. Stanley muses that, being culturally French, the Québécois people would want to split off from the N.A.U. to become part of the Franco-Spanish Holy Alliance. However, the Francophobia of the Sons of Liberty prevents them from effectively joining forces with Québécois separatists.
* In the 2006 young adults&#x27; alternate history novel &quot;The Disunited States of America&quot;, by Harry Turtledove, the United States collapsed in the 1800s due to the retention of the Articles of Confederation, with states becoming sovereign nations by the 2090s. Quebec is an independent country in the 2090s, although it is not mentioned whether it remained an independent entity or seceded from a Canadian union.
* David Foster Wallace&#x27;s 1996 novel &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; includes both real and fictional Québécois separatist movements as integral to the plot. In the story, the United States has merged with Canada and Mexico to form the Organization of North American Nations (ONAN). Wheelchair-using Quebec separatists use a video so entertaining it leads to death to accomplish their goals of both Quebec independence and the end of the ONAN.
* In the &quot;Southern Victory Series&quot; of alternate history novels by Harry Turtledove, Quebec becomes a separate nation during the First Great War (an alternative World War I). Since the United States organized this separation to weaken Anglophone Canada (and the UK by extension) and to aid in the post-war occupation of Canada, the Republic of Quebec operated as a client state of the United States, rather than being truly independent.
* In DC Comics, the villain (and sometimes hero) Plastique is initially a Québécois freedom fighter, who resorts to acts of terrorism.
* In &quot;Marvel Comics&quot;, the superhero Northstar was part of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) in his youth.
* In &quot;Axis Powers Hetalia&quot;, Canada&#x27;s nightmare features an independent Quebec.
* In the roleplaying game &quot;Trinity&quot; there are references made to a separatist Quebec nation who in return for independence helped the then formed &#x27;Confederated States of America&#x27; take control of Canada.
* In the roleplaying game &quot;Shadowrun&quot;, Quebec exists as a sovereign nation alongside the United Canadian American States and the Confederated American States.
*Canadian Civil War is a board game from 1977. The game simulates a hypothetical political struggle between factions, some of them seeking to redefine the terms of the Canadian confederation, others seeking to maintain the status quo.

<text>A transient-voltage-suppression (TVS) diode, also transil, transorb or thyrector, is an electronic component used to protect electronics from voltage spikes induced on connected wires.

==Description==
The device operates by shunting excess current when the induced voltage exceeds the avalanche breakdown potential. It is a clamping device, suppressing all overvoltages above its breakdown voltage. It automatically resets when the overvoltage goes away, but absorbs much more of the transient energy internally than a similarly rated crowbar device.

A transient-voltage-suppression diode may be either unidirectional or bidirectional. A unidirectional device operates as a rectifier in the forward direction like any other avalanche diode, but is made and tested to handle very large peak currents.

A bidirectional transient-voltage-suppression diode can be represented by two mutually opposing avalanche diodes in series with one another and connected in parallel with the circuit to be protected. While this representation is schematically accurate, physically the devices are now manufactured as a single component.

A transient-voltage-suppression diode can respond to over-voltages faster than other common over-voltage protection components such as varistors or gas discharge tubes. The actual clamping occurs in roughly one picosecond, but in a practical circuit the inductance of the wires leading to the device imposes a higher limit. This makes transient-voltage-suppression diodes useful for protection against very fast and often damaging voltage transients. These fast over-voltage transients are present on all distribution networks and can be caused by either internal or external events, such as lightning or motor arcing.

Transient voltage suppressors will fail if they are subjected to voltages or conditions beyond those that the particular product was designed to accommodate. There are three key modes in which the TVS will fail: short, open, and degraded device.

TVS diodes are sometimes referred to as transorbs, from the Vishay trademark &quot;TransZorb&quot;.
==Characterization==
A TVS diode is characterized by:
* Leakage current: the amount of current conducted when voltage applied is below the maximum reverse standoff voltage.
* Maximum reverse standoff voltage: the voltage below which no significant conduction occurs.
* Breakdown voltage: the voltage at which some specified and significant conduction occurs.
* Clamping voltage: the voltage at which the device will conduct its fully rated current (hundreds to thousands of amperes).
* Parasitic capacitance: The nonconducting diode behaves like a capacitor, which can distort and corrupt high-speed signals. Lower capacitance is generally preferred.
* Parasitic inductance: Because the actual over voltage switching is so fast, the package inductance is the limiting factor for response speed.
* Amount of energy it can absorb: Because the transients are so brief, all of the energy is initially stored internally as heat; a heat sink only affects the time to cool down afterwards. Thus, a high-energy TVS must be physically large. If this capacity is too small, the over voltage will possibly destroy the device and leave the circuit unprotected.

<text>Adrian Samuel Young (born August 26, 1969) is an American musician, best known as the drummer of the rock bands No Doubt and Dreamcar. He also serves as a producer in his free time.

==Biography==
When not performing, in the studio or touring, Young likes to spend his time out on the golf course, as he is an avid golf player. He is a scratch golfer who is a much desired participant in celebrity golf tournaments such as the Michael Jordan Invitational, Alice Cooper Foundation Tournament and others. Young has participated in VH1&#x27;s &quot;Fairway to Heaven&quot; numerous times.

==Reunion with No Doubt==
No Doubt announced on their official website that they would tour in the summer of 2009 with Paramore, the Sounds, Janelle Monáe, Bedouin Soundclash, Katy Perry, and Panic! at the Disco. while finishing their upcoming album, which was set for release in 2010. Tickets for the tour went on sale March 7, 2009. As a special promotion for the tour, the band was giving away their entire music catalog free as a digital download with purchase of top-tier seating.

In 2009, No Doubt made an appearance on the television series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, playing a fictional band called &quot;Snowed Out&quot; in the episode &quot;Valley Girls&quot;. They performed their cover version of the Adam and the Ants song &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;.

==Personal life==
In October 1999, Young proposed to his girlfriend Nina Kent on stage during a No Doubt concert. They were married in January 2000. The couple had a son, Mason, in 2002 and a daughter, Magnolia, in 2011. He and his wife delivered their stillborn daughter, Ruby, in 2010. Young&#x27;s two children have a cousin-like relationship with the other children of No Doubt band members, as the children often spend time together during concerts.

<doc id="319515" wikidata="Q3629214" url="?curid=319515" title="Silicon controlled rectifier">
<text>A silicon controlled rectifier or semiconductor controlled rectifier is a four-layer solid-state current-controlling device. The name &quot;silicon controlled rectifier&quot; is General Electric&#x27;s trade name for a type of thyristor. The principle of four-layer p–n–p–n switching was developed by Moll, Tanenbaum, Goldey, and Holonyak of Bell Laboratories in 1956. The practical demonstration of silicon controlled switching and detailed theoretical behavior of a device in agreement with the experimental results was presented by Dr Ian M. Mackintosh of Bell Laboratories in January 1958. The SCR was developed by a team of power engineers led by Gordon Hall


and commercialized by Frank W. &quot;Bill&quot; Gutzwiller in 1957.

Some sources define silicon-controlled rectifiers and thyristors as synonymous while other sources define silicon-controlled rectifiers as a proper subset of the set of thyristors; the latter being devices with at least four layers of alternating n- and p-type material. According to Bill Gutzwiller, the terms &quot;SCR&quot; and &quot;controlled rectifier&quot; were earlier, and &quot;thyristor&quot; was applied later, as usage of the device spread internationally.

SCRs are unidirectional devices (i.e. can conduct current only in one direction) as opposed to TRIACs, which are bidirectional (i.e. charge carriers can flow through them in either direction). SCRs can be triggered normally only by a positive current going into the gate as opposed to TRIACs, which can be triggered normally by either a positive or a negative current applied to its gate electrode.

== Modes of operation ==

There are three modes of operation for an SCR depending upon the biasing given to it:
# Forward blocking mode (off state)
# Forward conduction mode (on state)
# Reverse blocking mode (off state)

===Forward blocking mode===
In this mode of operation, the anode (+, p-doped side) is given a positive voltage while the cathode (−, n-doped side) is given a negative voltage, keeping the gate at zero (0) potential i.e. disconnected. In this case junction J1 and J3 are forward-biased, while J2 is reverse-biased, allowing only a small leakage current from the anode to the cathode. When the applied voltage reaches the breakover value for J2, then J2 undergoes avalanche breakdown. At this breakover voltage J2 starts conducting, but below breakover voltage J2 offers very high resistance to the current and the SCR is said to be in the off state.

===Forward conduction mode===
An SCR can be brought from blocking mode to conduction mode in two ways: Either by increasing the voltage between anode and cathode beyond the breakover voltage, or by applying a positive pulse at the gate. Once the SCR starts conducting, no more gate voltage is required to maintain it in the ON state. The minimum current necessary to maintain the SCR in the ON state on removal of the gate voltage is called the latching current.

There are two ways to turn it off:
# Reduce the current through it below a minimum value called the holding current, or
# With the gate turned off, short-circuit the anode and cathode momentarily with a push-button switch or transistor across the junction.

=== Reverse blocking mode ===
When a negative voltage is applied to the anode and a positive voltage to the cathode, the SCR is in reverse blocking mode, making J1 and J3 reverse biased and J2 forward biased. The device behaves as two diodes connected in series. A small leakage current flows. This is the reverse blocking mode. If the reverse voltage is increased, then at critical breakdown level, called the reverse breakdown voltage (VBR), an avalanche occurs at J1 and J3 and the reverse current increases rapidly.
SCRs are available with reverse blocking capability, which adds to the forward voltage drop because of the need to have a long, low-doped P1 region. Usually, the reverse blocking voltage rating and forward blocking voltage rating are the same. The typical application for a reverse blocking SCR is in current-source inverters.

An SCR incapable of blocking reverse voltage is known as an asymmetrical SCR, abbreviated ASCR. It typically has a reverse breakdown rating in the tens of volts. ASCRs are used where either a reverse conducting diode is applied in parallel (for example, in voltage-source inverters) or where reverse voltage would never occur (for example, in switching power supplies or DC traction choppers).

Asymmetrical SCRs can be fabricated with a reverse conducting diode in the same package. These are known as RCTs, for reverse conducting thyristors.

== Thyristor turn-on methods ==

# forward-voltage triggering
# gate triggering
# &quot;dv&quot;/&quot;dt&quot; triggering
#thermal triggering
# light triggering

Forward-voltage triggering occurs when the anode–cathode forward voltage is increased with the gate circuit opened. This is known as avalanche breakdown, during which junction J2 will break down. At sufficient voltages, the thyristor changes to its on state with low voltage drop and large forward current. In this case, J1 and J3 are already forward-biased.

In order for gate triggering to occur, the thyristor should be in the forward blocking state where the applied voltage is less than the breakdown voltage, otherwise forward-voltage triggering may occur. A single small positive voltage pulse can then be applied between the gate and the cathode. This supplies a single gate current pulse that turns the thyristor onto its on state. In practice, this is the most common method used to trigger a thyristor.

Temperature triggering occurs when the width of depletion region decreases as the temperature is increased. When the SCR is near VPO a very small increase in temperature causes junction J2 to be removed which triggers the device.

== Simple SCR circuit ==

A simple SCR circuit can be illustrated using an AC voltage source connected to a SCR with a resistive load. Without an applied current pulse to the gate of the SCR, the SCR is left in its forward blocking state. This makes the start of conduction of the SCR controllable. The delay angle α, which is the instant the gate current pulse is applied with respect to the instant of natural conduction (ωt = 0), controls the start of conduction. Once the SCR conducts, the SCR does not turn off until the current through the SCR, is, becomes negative. is stays zero until another gate current pulse is applied and SCR once again begins conducting.

== Applications ==
SCRs are mainly used in devices where the control of high power, possibly coupled with high voltage, is demanded. Their operation makes them suitable for use in medium- to high-voltage AC power control applications, such as lamp dimming, power regulators and motor control.

SCRs and similar devices are used for rectification of high-power AC in high-voltage direct current power transmission. They are also used in the control of welding machines, mainly gas tungsten arc welding and similar processes. It is used as an electronic switch in various devices. Early solid-state pinball machines made use of these to control lights, solenoids, and other functions electronically, instead of mechanically, hence the name solid-state.

Other applications include power switching circuits, controlled rectifiers, speed control of DC shunt motors, SCR crowbars, computer logic circuits, timing circuits, and inverters.

==Comparison with SCS==
A silicon-controlled switch (SCS) behaves nearly the same way as an SCR; but there are a few differences. Unlike an SCR, an SCS switches off when a positive voltage/input current is applied to another anode gate lead. Unlike an SCR, an SCS can be triggered into conduction when a negative voltage/output current is applied to that same lead.

SCSs are useful in practically all circuits that need a switch that turns on/off through two distinct control pulses. This includes power-switching circuits, logic circuits, lamp drivers, and counters.

==Compared to TRIACs==
A TRIAC resembles an SCR in that both act as electrically controlled switches. Unlike an SCR, a TRIAC can pass current in either direction. Thus, TRIACs are particularly useful for AC applications. TRIACs have three leads: a gate lead and two conducting leads, referred to as MT1 and MT2. If no current/voltage is applied to the gate lead, the TRIAC switches off. On the other hand, if the trigger voltage is applied to the gate lead, the TRIAC switches on.

TRIACs are suitable for light-dimming circuits, phase-control circuits, AC power-switching circuits, AC motor control circuits, etc.

<text>Verghese Kurien (26 November 1921 – 9 September 2012) was an Indian dairy engineer and social entrepreneur. He led initiatives that contributed to the extensive increase in milk production in India termed as the White Revolution.

Kurien graduated in physics from the University of Madras in 1940 and received his masters in mechanical engineering from the Michigan State University in 1947. In 1949, Kurien was sent by the Government of India to run its experimental creamery at Anand, where he set up the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers&#x27; Union in 1950 which later became Amul. Amul organised the dairy farmers in the villages as a part of cooperatives and linked them to the milk consumers directly.

In 1965, Kurien was appointed as the head of the newly formed National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), which helped to set up similar cooperatives across India and made dairy farming one of the largest self-sustaining industries and employment generators in rural areas. The dairy cooperatives were successful in increasing the milk production as the dairy farmers controlled the procurement, processing, and marketing of milk and milk products as the owners of the cooperative. This led to a multi-fold increase in milk output over the next few decades and helped India become the world&#x27;s largest milk producer in 1998. The co-operative model was later applied to other agricultural industries such as the production of edible oils and replicated in other countries.

For his contributions in increasing the dairy output, Kurien is known as the &quot;Father of the White Revolution&quot; in India. He was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1964 and the World Food Prize in 1989. In 1999, he received the Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second highest civilian honour. He was conferred the Order of Agricultural Merit by the French Government in 1997.

== Early life and education ==
Kurien was born on 26 November 1921 in Calicut, Madras Presidency, British India (now Kozhikode, Kerala, India) in a Malayali Syrian Christian family. His father was a government civil surgeon and Kurien did his schooling at Diamond Jubilee Higher Secondary School at Gobichettipalayam, where his father worked at the government hospital there. He graduated in physics from Loyola College in 1940 and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering from the College of Engineering, Guindy affiliated to the University of Madras in 1943.

Kurien wanted to join the Indian army as an engineer but instead he worked with Tata Steel Technical Institute in Jamshedpur. Kurien applied for a scholarship provided by the Government of India to study metallurgical engineering but instead received a scholarship to study dairy engineering. He was sent to train at the Imperial Institute of Animal Husbandry in Bangalore before being sent to the United States on a government scholarship. He graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering from the Michigan State University in 1948. Kurien had stated that though he was sent on a government scholarship to study dairy engineering, he studied metallurgical and nuclear engineering, disciplines which were likely to be of far greater use to the soon-to-be independent India and to himself.
== Career ==
=== Early years ===
In 1949, Kurien was sent by the government of India to its experimental creamery at Anand in Bombay province (currently in Gujarat). He spent the evenings helping Tribhuvandas Patel with fixing the dairy equipment used for processing the milk procured from the local farmers. Earlier in 1946, Patel had set up a cooperative at Kaira. It was formed as a response to the exploitation of small dairy farmers by traders and agents, who set arbitrary milk prices on behalf of Polson, which had an effective monopoly in milk collection from Kaira. Kurien wanted to quit the government job and leave Anand but was persuaded by Patel to stay with him and help with his dairy cooperative.

=== Developing Amul ===
Kurien developed the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers&#x27; Union Limited (KDCMPUL) further which later became Amul. Milk collection was decentralised and was directly procured from the farmers at villages as a part of the cooperatives. Kurien and Tribhuvandas Patel were supported by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Morarji Desai to help organise the dairy farmers. Kurien worked on the belief that economic self-interest of all sections of the village-society would make them align together to grow their cooperative and remove caste or class conflicts. The cooperative dairying venture was expanded to the nearby districts and was involved in the training of dairy students. By 1952, the daily milk procurement reached 20,000 litres from a mere 200 litres per day in 1948.

In 1956, Kurien visited Nestle in Switzerland at their invitation but with special instructions from then commerce and industries minister. Nestle was importing milk powder, sugar and other materials required to produce condensed milk in India. Kurien asked Nestle to reduce the imports to India, to try manufacturing condensed milk with buffalo milk procured locally and to engage more Indians in the production process. He was met with a refusal stating that the natives would not be able to handle the technology involved in the condensed milk production. On returning, he increased the production of condensed milk at Amul, the import of which was banned by Government of India two years later. H. M. Dalaya, who studied dairy engineering with Kurien at the US, was persuaded by Kurien to work with him at Anand. He helped develop an indigenous process of making skimmed milk powder and condensed milk from buffalo milk, which had a higher proportion of milk solids and increased its economic value. In India, buffalo milk was plentiful while cow milk was in short supply. With the production of condensed milk and baby food from Buffalo milk, Amul competed successfully against Nestle and Glaxo.

Then Commerce minister T T Krishnamachari also cut imports of butter in steps with Kurien promising and delivering an incremental increase of his production to substitute imported butter, especially from New Zealand. During the Sino-Indian War in 1962, production had to be diverted to the Indian armed forces which led Polson to gain market share. Kurien lobbied with the government to freeze Polson&#x27;s production lines, as part of the war effort. Later research by G. H. Wilster led to cheese production from buffalo milk at Amul.

=== Nationwide expansion ===
When then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri visited Anand to inaugurate Amul&#x27;s cattle feed factory in October 1964, he interacted with the dairy farmers about their cooperative. In 1965, Shastri tasked Kurien to replicate the dairy&#x27;s Anand scheme nationwide, for which the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) was founded. It was established as a society based at Anand and was led by Kurien.

Kurien negotiated with FAO and UNICEF of the United Nations, and the World Bank for aid to develop the cooperatives as a part of &quot;Operation Flood&quot;. In the first phase between 1970 and 1979, he focused on choosing the 18 best milk sheds across the country, setting up dairy cooperatives and linking them with nearby major cities, to capture the market there. The Anand model was replicated across Gujarat and Kurien brought all of them under the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) to sell their products under a single Amul brand on the 25th anniversary of establishment. In the second phase between 1979 and 1985, the plan was extended to cover more than 290 towns. In 1979, he established the Institute of Rural Management at Anand for training the managers involved in the milk cooperatives. By 1985, there were about 4.25 million milk producers attached to 43,000 village cooperatives and milk powder production scaled up more than six times.

=== Consolidation and self-sufficiency ===
In the last phase of the Operation Flood between 1985 and 1996, Kurien focused on making the cooperatives independent and self-sustaining. It involved scaling up infrastructure to increase procurement and production, establishment dairy processing facilities, focus on marketing and training management professionals. In the 1990s, he lobbied and fought hard to keep multinational companies from entering the dairy business even as the country opened up due to liberalisation in 1991. India became the world&#x27;s largest milk producer by 1998, surpassing the United States and contributed to about 17 percent of global output in 2010–11. 

In 1998, he persuaded then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to appoint Amrita Patel as his successor at NDDB, whom he had groomed under him to protect NDDB&#x27;s independence from the government. Later, he had differences with her on the policies of Amul. While she was focused on production and yield targets with certain functions such as marketing handed over to private, Kurien felt that the arrangement would weaken the cooperative institutions of the country. He resigned from the position of chairman of GCMMF in 2006 after limited support from the governing board.

=== Other work ===
Kurien replicated the cooperative model in other agricultural industries like the production of fruits and vegetables, oil seeds and edible oil. In 1979, he started the Oilseeds Growers’ Cooperative Project (OGCP) under &quot;Operation Golden Flow&quot;. In the 1980s, more than 500,000 farmers were part of the cooperatives and &quot;Dhara&quot;, a brand of edible oil launched by NDDB in 1988, became the country&#x27;s top selling brand. In the 1990s, the project began to lose steam as the government allowed the import of edible oil from other countries.

In 1979, then Premier of Soviet Union Alexei Kosygin visited Anand and invited Kurien to the Soviet Union. In 1982, Kurien visited Pakistan as a part of a World Bank mission following the request of the Government of Pakistan for aid in setting up dairy cooperatives. Kurien registered interest from other countries like Sri Lanka and Philippines, who wanted him to replicate the cooperative model in their countries. China planned a similar programme based on the same. He also served as the chairman of Tribhuvandas Foundation, a NGO which worked on women and child health in Kheda district.

== Death ==
Kurien died from an illness at the age of 90 on 9 September 2012 at Nadiad near Anand. He had a wife Molly and a daughter, Nirmala. Kurien was brought up as a Christian before becoming an atheist.

== Awards and honours ==
For his contributions in increasing the dairy output, Kurian is known as the &quot;Father of the White Revolution&quot; in India. 
Kurien&#x27;s birthday, 26 November is celebrated as the &quot;National Milk Day&quot; in India.

Kurien was bestowed with an honorary degree by the Michigan State University in 1965. During the World Dairy Expo in 1993, he was recognized as the International Person of the Year. Kurien was also awarded the Godfrey Phillips Bravery Award for social bravery. 

Kurien either headed or was on the boards of several public institutions and received honorary doctorate degrees from universities worldwide. The cooperative model pioneered by Kurien is studied in academia with lectures on the same.

== Books and publications ==
* 

== In popular culture ==
Filmmaker Shyam Benegal wanted to make &quot;Manthan&quot;, a film story based on Amul but had no financial backing. The movie was later made from financial contribution from member-farmers of co-operatives, who contributed two rupees each and was released in 1976. A veterinarian, a milk technician, and a fodder specialist toured the country along with the screening of the film to persuade farmers to form cooperatives of their own with United Nations using the movie to encourage similar cooperatives in Latin America and Africa.

Kurien&#x27;s supported the &quot;Amul girl&quot; advertisement campaign which is one of the longest running campaigns in India and &quot;Surabhi&quot;, a television series on Indian culture.

In 2013, Amar Chitra Katha published the comic &quot;Verghese Kurien: The man with the billion litre idea&quot;.

<text>The cattle egret (formerly genus Bubulcus) is a cosmopolitan clade of heron (family Ardeidae) in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot; found in the tropics, subtropics, and warm-temperate zones. According to the IOC bird list, it contains two species, the western cattle egret and the eastern cattle egret, although some authorities regard them as a single species. Despite the similarities in plumage to the egrets of the genus &quot;Egretta&quot;, it actually belongs to the genus &quot;Ardea&quot;. Originally native to parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe, it has undergone a rapid expansion in its distribution and successfully colonised much of the rest of the world in the last century.

They are white birds adorned with buff plumes in the breeding season. They nest in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The nest is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species. Their feeding habitats include seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands, and rice paddies. They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations are migratory and others show postbreeding dispersal.

The adult cattle egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks may be lost to starvation, calcium deficiency, or disturbance from other large birds. Cattle egrets maintain a special relationship with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming is believed to be a major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both organisms, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.

==Taxonomy==
Before the description of the &quot;Bubulcus&quot; by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1855, the western cattle egret had already been described in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus in his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Ardea ibis&quot;, and the eastern cattle egret had been described in 1783 by Pieter Boddaert as &quot;Cancroma coromanda&quot;. Their generic name &quot;Bubulcus&quot; is Latin for herdsman, referring, like the English name, to their association with cattle. &quot;Ibis&quot; is a Latin and Greek word which originally referred to another white wading bird, the sacred ibis, but was applied to the western cattle egret in error. The epithet &quot;coromanda&quot; refers to the Coromandel Coast of India.

The eastern and western cattle egrets were split by McAllan and Bruce, but were regarded as conspecific by almost all other recent authors until the publication of the influential &quot;Birds of South Asia&quot;. The eastern cattle egret breeds in South Asia, Eastern Asia, and Australasia, and the western species occupies the rest of the cattle egret&#x27;s range, including Western Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. According to the IOC birdlist, they are both monotypic species. While some authorities recognise a third Seychelles subspecies, the Seychelles cattle egret (&quot;A. i. seychellarum&quot;), which was first described by Finn Salomonsen in 1934.

Despite superficial similarities in appearance, the cattle egret is more closely related to the other members of the genus &quot;Ardea&quot;, which comprises the great or typical herons and the great egret (&quot;A. alba&quot;), than to the majority of species termed egrets in the genus &quot;Egretta&quot;. Rare cases of hybridization with little blue herons (&quot;Egretta caerulea&quot;), little egrets (&quot;E. garzetta&quot;), and snowy egrets (&quot;E. thula&quot;) have been recorded.

An older English name for the cattle egret is buff-backed heron.

==Description==

The cattle egret is a stocky heron with an wingspan; it is long and weighs . It has a relatively short, thick neck, a sturdy bill, and a hunched posture. The nonbreeding adult has mainly white plumage, a yellow bill, and greyish-yellow legs. During the breeding season, adults of the western cattle egret develop orange-buff plumes on the back, breast, and crown, and the bill, legs, and irises become bright red for a brief period prior to pairing. The sexes are similar, but the male is marginally larger and has slightly longer breeding plumes than the female; juvenile birds lack coloured plumes and have a black bill.

The eastern differs from the western in breeding plumage, when the buff colour on its head extends to the cheeks and throat, and the plumes are more golden in colour. This species&#x27; bill and tarsi are longer on average than in &quot;A. ibis&quot;. &quot;A. i. seychellarum&quot;, which may or may not be a valid subspecies, is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms. It has white cheeks and throat, like &quot;A. ibis&quot;, but the nuptial plumes are golden, as with &quot;A. coromanda&quot;. Individuals with abnormally grey, melanistic plumages have been recorded.

The positioning of the egret&#x27;s eyes allows for binocular vision during feeding, and physiological studies suggest that they may be capable of crepuscular or nocturnal activity. Adapted to foraging on land, they have lost the ability possessed by their wetland relatives to accurately correct for light refraction by water.

==Distribution and habitat==
The western cattle egret has undergone one of the most rapid and wide-reaching natural expansions of any bird species. It was originally native to parts of southern Spain and Portugal, tropical and subtropical Africa, and humid tropical and subtropical Asia. At the end of the 19th century, it began expanding its range into southern Africa, first breeding in the Cape Province in 1908. Cattle egrets were first sighted in the Americas on the boundary of Guiana and Suriname in 1877, having apparently flown across the Atlantic Ocean. In the 1930s, the species is thought to have become established in that area. It is now widely distributed across Brazil and was first discovered in the northern region of the country in 1964, feeding along with buffalos.

The species first arrived in North America in 1941 (these early sightings were originally dismissed as escapees), bred in Florida in 1953, and spread rapidly, breeding for the first time in Canada in 1962. It is now commonly seen as far west as California. It was first recorded breeding in Cuba in 1957, in Costa Rica in 1958, and in Mexico in 1963, although it was probably established before then. In Europe, the species had historically declined in Spain and Portugal, but in the latter part of the 20th century, it expanded back through the Iberian Peninsula, and then began to colonise other parts of Europe, southern France in 1958, northern France in 1981, and Italy in 1985. Breeding in the United Kingdom was recorded for the first time in 2008, only a year after an influx seen in the previous year. In 2008, cattle egrets were also reported as having moved into Ireland for the first time. This trend has continued and cattle egrets have become more numerous in southern Britain with influxes in some numbers during the nonbreeding seasons of 2007/08 and 2016/17. They bred in Britain again in 2017, following an influx in the previous winter, and may become established there.

In Australia, the colonisation began in the 1940s, with the eastern cattle egret establishing itself in the north and east of the continent. It began to regularly visit New Zealand in the 1960s. Since 1948, the cattle egret has been permanently resident in Israel. Prior to 1948, it was only a winter visitor.

The massive and rapid expansion of the cattle egret&#x27;s range is due to its relationship with humans and their domesticated animals. Originally adapted to a commensal relationship with large grazing and browsing animals, it was easily able to switch to domesticated cattle and horses. As the keeping of livestock spread throughout the world, the cattle egret was able to occupy otherwise empty niches. Many populations of cattle egrets are highly migratory and dispersive, and this has helped the genus&#x27; range expansion. The cattle egret has been seen as a vagrant in various sub-Antarctic islands, including South Georgia, Marion Island, the South Sandwich Islands, and the South Orkney Islands. A small flock of eight birds was also seen in Fiji in 2008.

In addition to the natural expansion of its range, cattle egrets have been deliberately introduced into a few areas. The western cattle egret was introduced to Hawaii in 1959, and to the Chagos Archipelago in 1955. Successful releases were also made in the Seychelles and Rodrigues, but attempts to introduce them to Mauritius failed. Numerous birds were also released by Whipsnade Zoo in England, but they were never established.

Although the cattle egret sometimes feeds in shallow water, unlike most herons, it is typically found in fields and dry grassy habitats, reflecting its greater dietary reliance on terrestrial insects rather than aquatic prey.

==Migration and movements==

Some populations of cattle egrets are migratory, others are dispersive, and distinguishing between the two can be difficult. In many areas, populations can be both sedentary and migratory. In the Northern Hemisphere, migration is from cooler climes to warmer areas, but cattle egrets nesting in Australia migrate to cooler Tasmania and New Zealand in the winter and return in the spring. Migration in western Africa is in response to rainfall, and in South America, migrating birds travel south of their breeding range in the nonbreeding season. Populations in southern India appear to show local migrations in response to the monsoons. They move north from Kerala after September. During winter, many birds have been seen flying at night with flocks of Indian pond herons (&quot;Ardeola grayii&quot;) on the south-eastern coast of India and a winter influx has also been noted in Sri Lanka.

Young birds are known to disperse up to from their breeding area. Flocks may fly vast distances and have been seen over seas and oceans including in the middle of the Atlantic.

== Ecology and behavior ==
===Voice===

The cattle egret gives a quiet, throaty &quot;rick-rack&quot; call at the breeding colony, but is otherwise largely silent.

===Breeding===
The cattle egret nests in colonies, which are often found around bodies of water. The colonies are usually found in woodlands near lakes or rivers, in swamps, or on small inland or coastal islands, and are sometimes shared with other wetland birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises, and cormorants. The breeding season varies within South Asia. Nesting in northern India begins with the onset of monsoons in May. The breeding season in Australia is November to early January, with one brood laid per season. The North American breeding season lasts from April to October. In the Seychelles, the breeding season of &quot;B. i. seychellarum&quot; is April to October.

The male displays in a tree in the colony, using a range of ritualised behaviours, such as shaking a twig and sky-pointing (raising his bill vertically upwards), and the pair forms over 3–4 days. A new mate is chosen in each season and when renesting following nest failure. The nest is a small, untidy platform of sticks in a tree or shrub constructed by both parents. Sticks are collected by the male and arranged by the female, and stick-stealing is rife. The clutch size can be one to five eggs, although three or four is most common. The pale bluish-white eggs are oval-shaped and measure . Incubation lasts around 23 days, with both sexes sharing incubation duties. The chicks are partly covered with down at hatching, but are not capable of fending for themselves; they become capable of regulating their temperature at 9–12 days and are fully feathered in 13–21 days. They begin to leave the nest and climb around at 2 weeks, fledge at 30 days and become independent at around the 45th day.

The cattle egret engages in low levels of brood parasitism, and a few instances have been reported of cattle egret eggs being laid in the nests of snowy egrets and little blue herons, although these eggs seldom hatch. Also, evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism has been found, with females laying eggs in the nests of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% extra-pair copulations has been noted.

The dominant factor in nesting mortality is starvation. Sibling rivalry can be intense, and in South Africa, third and fourth chicks inevitably starve. In the dryer habitats with fewer amphibians, the diet may lack sufficient vertebrate content and may cause bone abnormalities in growing chicks due to calcium deficiency. In Barbados, nests were sometimes raided by vervet monkeys, and a study in Florida reported the fish crow and black rat as other possible nest raiders. The same study attributed some nestling mortality to brown pelicans nesting in the vicinity, which accidentally, but frequently, dislodged nests or caused nestlings to fall. In Australia, Torresian crows, wedge-tailed eagles, and white-bellied sea eagles take eggs or young, and tick infestation and viral infections may also be causes of mortality.

===Feeding===
The cattle egret feeds on a wide range of prey, particularly insects, especially grasshoppers, crickets, flies (adults and maggots), beetles, and moths, as well as spiders, frogs, fish, crayfish, small snakes, lizards and earthworms. In a rare instance, they have been observed foraging along the branches of a banyan tree for ripe figs. The cattle egret is usually found with cattle and other large grazing and browsing animals, and catches small creatures disturbed by the mammals. Studies have shown that cattle egret foraging success is much higher when foraging near a large animal than when feeding singly. When foraging with cattle, it has been shown to be 3.6 times more successful in capturing prey than when foraging alone. Its performance is similar when it follows farm machinery, but it is forced to move more. In urban situations, cattle egrets have also been observed foraging in peculiar situations such as railway lines.

A cattle egret will weakly defend the area around a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets, it will give up and continue foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15 steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and thus obtain more food.

The cattle egret sometimes shows versatility in its diet. On islands with seabird colonies, it will prey on the eggs and chicks of terns and other seabirds. During migration, it has also been reported to eat exhausted migrating landbirds. Birds of the Seychelles race also indulge in some kleptoparasitism, chasing the chicks of sooty terns and forcing them to disgorge food.

===Threats===
Pairs of crested caracaras have been observed chasing cattle egrets in flight, forcing them to the ground, and killing them.

==Status==

The IUCN Red List treats them as a single species. They have a large range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of . Their global population is estimated to be 3.8–6.7 million individuals. For these reasons, the genus is evaluated as least concern. The expansion and establishment of the genus over large ranges has led it to be classed as an invasive species, although little, if any, impact has been noted yet.

==Relationship with humans==
As a conspicuous genus, the cattle egret has attracted many common names. These mostly relate to its habit of following cattle and other large animals, and it is known variously as cow crane, cow bird or cow heron, or even elephant bird or rhinoceros egret. Its Arabic name, &quot;abu qerdan&quot;, means &quot;father of ticks&quot;, a name derived from the huge number of parasites such as avian ticks found in its breeding colonies. The Maasai people consider the presence of large numbers of cattle egrets as an indicator of impending drought and use it to decide on moving their cattle herds.

Cattle egrets are an occurring traditional motif in fishing boats among fishermen of the Malay Peninsula east coast who believed them as a symbol of good luck and fortune.

The cattle egret is a popular bird with cattle ranchers for its perceived role as a biocontrol of cattle parasites such as ticks and flies. A study in Australia found that cattle egrets reduced the number of flies that bothered cattle by pecking them directly off the skin. It was the benefit to stock that prompted ranchers and the Hawaiian Board of Agriculture and Forestry to release the western cattle egret in Hawaii.

Not all interactions between humans and cattle egrets are beneficial. The cattle egret can be a safety hazard to aircraft due to its habit of feeding in large groups in the grassy verges of airports, and it has been implicated in the spread of animal infections such as heartwater, infectious bursal disease, and possibly Newcastle disease.

<doc id="319525" wikidata="Q318287" url="?curid=319525" title="Cameron Crowe">
<text>Cameron Bruce Crowe (born July 13, 1957) is an American filmmaker and journalist. He has received numerous accolades including an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, and Grammy Award as well as a nomination for a Tony Award. Crowe started his career as a contributing editor and writer at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 1973 where he covered numerous rock bands on tour.

Crowe&#x27;s debut screenwriting effort, &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982), grew out of a book he wrote while posing for one year undercover as a student at Clairemont High School in San Diego. Later, he wrote and directed the romance films &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989), &quot;Singles&quot; (1992), and &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996). Crowe directed his seminal work, the autobiographical film &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000), which is loosely based on his early career as a teen writer for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. For his screenplay, he won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

His later films have received varying degrees of success. He directed the psychological thriller &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (2001), the romantic comedy &quot;Elizabethtown&quot; (2005), the family-friendly &quot;We Bought a Zoo&quot; (2011), and the romantic comedy &quot;Aloha&quot; (2015). He has directed the music documentaries &quot;Pearl Jam Twenty&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Union&quot; (2011), produced &quot;David Crosby: Remember My Name&quot; (2019), and created the Showtime series &quot;Roadies&quot; (2016).

Crowe has written two books, &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1981) and &quot;Conversations with Wilder&quot; (1999). He also adapted &quot;Almost Famous&quot; into a stage musical on Broadway in 2022, for which he received a Tony Award for Best Original Score nomination.

==Early life==
Cameron Crowe was born in Palm Springs, California. His father, James A. Crowe, originally from Kentucky, was a real estate agent. His mother, Alice Marie (née George), &quot;was a teacher, activist, and all-around live wire who did skits around the house and would wear a clown suit to school on special occasions.&quot; She worked as a psychology professor and in family therapy and often participated in peace demonstrations and causes relating to the rights of farm workers. Crowe&#x27;s grandfather was Greek. Crowe was the youngest of three children with two sisters; one died when he was young. The family moved around often but spent a lot of time in the desert town of Indio, California. Crowe commented that Indio was where &quot;people owned tortoises, not dogs&quot;. His family finally settled in San Diego.

Crowe skipped kindergarten and two grades in elementary school, and by the time he attended Catholic high school, he was quite a bit younger than the other students. To add to his alienation, he was often ill because he had nephritis.

Crowe began writing for the school newspaper and by the age of 13 was contributing music reviews for an underground publication, &quot;The San Diego Door&quot;. He began corresponding with music journalist Lester Bangs, who had left the &quot;Door&quot; to become editor at the national rock magazine &quot;Creem&quot;, and soon he was also submitting articles to &quot;Creem&quot; as well as &quot;Circus&quot;. Crowe graduated from the University of San Diego High School in 1972 at the age of 15. On a trip to Los Angeles, he met Ben Fong-Torres, the editor of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who hired him to write for the magazine. He also joined the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff as a contributing editor and became an associate editor. During this time, Crowe interviewed Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Neil Young, Eric Clapton, Eagles, Poco, Steely Dan, members of Led Zeppelin, Stephen Bishop and more. Crowe was &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s youngest-ever contributor.

==Career==
===1973–1976: Journalist with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;===
Crowe&#x27;s first cover story was about the Allman Brothers Band. He went on the road with them for three weeks at the age of 16, during which time he interviewed the band and the road crew.

Because Crowe was a fan of the 1970s hard rock bands that the older writers disliked, he landed a lot of major interviews. He wrote predominantly about Yes; and also about Led Zeppelin; the Allman Brothers; Jackson Browne; Neil Young; Eagles; Rod Stewart; Eric Clapton; Peter Frampton; Linda Ronstadt; Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young; Fleetwood Mac, and others. Former colleague Sarah Lazin described the youthful Crowe: &quot;He was a pleasure to work with - a total professional. He was easygoing and eager to learn. Obviously, the bands loved him.&quot; Then-senior editor Ben Fong-Torres also said of Crowe, &quot;He was the guy we sent out after some difficult customers. He covered the bands that hated &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.&quot;

=== 1977–1981: Film debut and breakthrough ===

==== &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; ====
When &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; moved its offices from California to New York in 1977, Crowe decided to stay behind. He also felt the excitement of his career was beginning to wane. He appeared in the 1978 film &quot;American Hot Wax&quot;, but returned to his writing. Though he would continue to freelance for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on and off over the years, he turned his attention to a book.

At the age of 22, he came up with the idea to pose undercover as a high-school student and write about his experiences. Simon &amp; Schuster gave him a contract, and he moved back in with his parents and enrolled as Dave Cameron at Clairemont High School in San Diego. Reliving the senior year he never had, he made friends and began to fit in. Though he initially planned to include himself in the book, he realized that it would jeopardize his ability to capture the essence of the high-school experience.

His book, &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High: A True Story&quot;, came out in 1981. Crowe focused on six main characters: a tough guy, a nerd, a surfer dude, a sexual sophisticate, and a middle-class brother and sister. He chronicled their activities in typical teenage settings—at school, at the beach, and at the mall, where many of them held afterschool jobs—and concentrated on details of their lives that probed into the heart of adolescence. This included scenes about homecoming and graduation, as well as social cliques and sexual encounters.

Before the book was released, &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; was optioned for a film. Released in 1982, the movie version lacked a specific plot and featured no major name stars. The studio did not devote any marketing effort toward it. It became a sleeper hit via word of mouth. The reviews of &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; were positive, and the film ended up launching the careers of some previously unknown actors, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Eric Stoltz, Judge Reinhold, Phoebe Cates, Anthony Edwards, Nicolas Cage, Forest Whitaker, and Sean Penn.

=== 1984–1992: Teen films ===
==== &quot;The Wild Life&quot; ====
Following that success, Crowe wrote the screenplay for 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Life&quot;, the pseudo-sequel to &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;. Whereas its predecessor followed teenagers&#x27; lives in high school, &quot;The Wild Life&quot; traced the lives of several teenagers after high school living in an apartment complex.

==== &quot;Say Anything...&quot; ====
Filmmaker James L. Brooks noticed Crowe&#x27;s original voice and wanted to work with him. Brooks executive produced Crowe&#x27;s first directing effort, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Say Anything...&quot;, about a young man pining away for the affections of the seemingly perfect girl. &quot;Say Anything...&quot; was positively received by critics.

==== &quot;Singles&quot; ====
Crowe&#x27;s next project, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Singles&quot;, described the romantic tangles among a group of six friends in their twenties in Seattle. The film starred Bridget Fonda and Matt Dillon, where Fonda played a coffee-bar waitress fawning over an aspiring musician, played by Dillon. Kyra Sedgwick and Campbell Scott co-starred as a couple wavering on whether to commit to each other. Music forms an integral backbone for the script, and the soundtrack became a best seller three months before the release of the film. Much of this was due to repeated delays while studio executives debated how to market it.

&quot;Singles&quot; successfully rode on the heels of Seattle&#x27;s grunge music boom. During production, bands like Nirvana were not yet national stars, but by the time the soundtrack was released, their song &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; had to be cut from the film because it was too costly to buy the rights. Crowe had signed members of Pearl Jam, shortly before their burgeoning, nationwide success, to portray Dillon&#x27;s fictional band &#x27;Citizen Dick&#x27;. He also appeared in this project, as a rock journalist at a club. Tim Appelo wrote in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;With ... an ambling, naturalistic style, Crowe captures the eccentric appeal of a town where espresso carts sprout on every corner and kids in ratty flannel shirts can cut records that make them millionaires.&quot;

=== 1996–2000: Established career ===

==== &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; ====
Branching into a new direction, Crowe wrote and directed &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;. The film is about a highly paid pro sports agent, inspired by sports agent Leigh Steinberg. Maguire is fired after having a moral revelation, writing and distributing a mission statement calling for sincere service to the athletes and less money for the agency. He strikes out to form his own agency. Tom Cruise played the title role of Jerry and Cuba Gooding, Jr. played Rod Tidwell, an aging wide receiver. His catchphrase, &quot;Show me the money!&quot;, became ubiquitous for a time. Renée Zellweger appeared as an accountant who sets aside her job security to follow Maguire&#x27;s charismatic moral aspiration in both work and love. Gooding won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role. The film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Editing, and Best Actor (for Cruise). Cruise won his second Golden Globe for his role as Jerry.

==== &quot;Almost Famous&quot; ====
In 2000, Crowe used his music journalism experience roots to write and direct &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, about the experiences of a teenage music journalist who goes on the road with an emerging band in the early 1970s. The film starred newcomer Patrick Fugit as William Miller, the baby-faced writer who finds himself immersed in the world of sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll, and Kate Hudson co-starred as Penny Lane, a prominent groupie, or, as the film refers to her, a &quot;Band-Aid&quot;. Digging into his most personal memories, Crowe used a composite of the bands he had known to come up with Stillwater, the emerging act that welcomes the young journalist into its sphere, then becomes wary of his intentions. Seventies rocker Peter Frampton served as a technical consultant on the film.

William Miller&#x27;s mother figured prominently in the film as well (often admonishing, &quot;Don&#x27;t take drugs!&quot;). The character was based on Crowe&#x27;s own mother, who even showed up at the film sets to keep an eye on him while he worked. Though he asked her not to bother Frances McDormand, who played her character, the two ended up getting along well. He also showed his sister, portrayed by Zooey Deschanel, rebelling and leaving home, and in real life, his mother and sister Cindy did not talk for a decade and were still estranged to a degree when he finished the film. The family reconciled when the project was complete.

In addition, Crowe took a copy of the film to London for a special screening with Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. After the screening, Led Zeppelin granted Crowe the right to use one of their songs on the soundtrack—the first time they had ever consented to this since allowing Crowe to use &quot;Kashmir&quot; in &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;—and also gave him rights to four of their other songs in the movie itself, although they did not grant him the rights to &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; for an intended scene (on the special &quot;Bootleg&quot; edition DVD, the scene is included as an extra without the song where the viewer is instructed by a watermark to begin playing it). Crowe and his then-wife, musician Nancy Wilson of Heart, co-wrote three of the five Stillwater songs in the film, and Frampton wrote the other two, with Mike McCready from Pearl Jam playing lead guitar on all of the Stillwater songs. Reviews were almost universally positive, and it was nominated for and won a host of film awards, including an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Crowe. Crowe and co-producer Danny Bramson also won the Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media Grammy Award for the soundtrack. Despite these accolades, box office returns for the film were disappointing.

=== 2001–2015: Career fluctuations ===

====&quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;====
Crowe followed &quot;Almost Famous&quot; with the psychological thriller &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; in 2001. The film, starring Tom Cruise, Penélope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, received mixed reviews, yet managed to gross $100.6 million at the US box office, making it his second highest grossing directorial effort behind &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996). &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; is a remake of Alejandro Amenabar&#x27;s 1997 Spanish film &quot;Abre Los Ojos&quot; (&quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;). Sofia is played by Penélope Cruz in both Amenabar&#x27;s original movie and Crowe&#x27;s remake.

====&quot;Elizabethtown&quot;====
 In 2005, Crowe directed the romantic tragicomedy &quot;Elizabethtown&quot;, starring Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst, which opened to mixed reviews, scoring 45 on Metacritic, the same as his previous effort, &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;.

====&quot;We Bought a Zoo&quot;====
With production on &quot;Aloha&quot; delayed, Crowe set his next feature, the family comedy-drama &quot;We Bought a Zoo&quot;, based on Benjamin Mee&#x27;s memoir of the same name. He collaborated with &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; writer Aline Brosh McKenna on the screenplay. The book&#x27;s story follows Mee, who buys and moves into a dilapidated zoo (now Dartmoor Zoological Park) in the English countryside. Looking for a fresh start along with his seven-year-old daughter and his troubled fourteen-year-old son, he hopes to refurbish the zoo and run it and to give his children what he calls an &quot;adventure&quot;. Crowe changed the location to the United States. The film received a wide release on December 23, 2011, by 20th Century Fox, and starred Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson. It received mixed reviews. The film music was composed by Jonsi.

====&quot;Aloha&quot;====

It was announced in early June 2008 that Crowe would return to write and direct his seventh feature film, initially titled &quot;Deep Tiki&quot; and &quot;Volcano Romance&quot;, set to star Ben Stiller and Reese Witherspoon, and to be released by Columbia Pictures. Filming was expected to begin in January 2009, but this was postponed.

The project resurfaced in 2013. Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, Rachel McAdams, Alec Baldwin, Bill Murray, John Krasinski and Danny McBride joined the cast of the film; filming began in Hawaii in September 2013. The film&#x27;s final title was &quot;Aloha&quot; and it was released on May 29, 2015, by Sony Pictures to negative critical reviews.

=== 2011–present: Career expansion ===

==== Music documentaries ====
In November 2009, he began filming a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the album &quot;The Union&quot;, a collaboration between musicians Elton John and Leon Russell produced by award-winning producer T-Bone Burnett. The documentary features musicians Neil Young, Brian Wilson, Booker T. Jones, steel guitarist Robert Randolph, Don Was and a 10-piece gospel choir who all appear on the album with John and Russell. Musician Stevie Nicks and John&#x27;s longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin also appear. On March 2, 2011, the documentary was announced to open the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival.

In an interview with Pearl Jam on March 9, 2009, bassist Jeff Ament said that their manager Kelly &quot;has had the idea to do a 20-year anniversary retrospective movie so he&#x27;s been on board with [film director] Cameron Crowe for the last few years.&quot; The band&#x27;s guitarist Mike McCready also stated in March, &quot;We are just in the very early stages of that, . . . starting to go through all the footage we have, and Cameron&#x27;s writing the treatment.&quot; Preliminary footage was shot in June 2010. A trailer for the movie, which featured Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder choosing between three permanent markers in a shop before turning to the camera and saying &quot;Three&#x27;s good... Twenty is better&quot;, was shown before select movies at the 2011 BFI London Film Festival. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and also had an accompanying book and soundtrack.

==== Television debut ====

On June 26, 2016, Crowe&#x27;s comedy-drama series &quot;Roadies&quot; premiered on the Showtime television channel. The show, starring Luke Wilson, Carla Gugino and Imogen Poots, tells the story of a colorful road crew who work behind the scenes for a fictional rock band, The Staton-House Band. The pilot episode was written and directed by Crowe, as well as the series finale.

==== Broadway debut ====
In 2019, he started writing the stage musical &quot;Almost Famous&quot; with music by Tom Kitt based on his 2000 film of the same name. The show debuted in San Diego at The Old Globe in 2019 and had plans for a Broadway run but was stalled due to the COVID-19 shutdown. The production ran at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre on Broadway from October 2022 to January 2023 with 77 performances. The musical received mixed reviews from critics. Crowe himself received a Best Original Score nomination at the 76th Tony Awards.

==Unrealized projects==
After &quot;Singles&quot; was released, Warner Bros. Television tried to turn the film into a television series, but Crowe turned it down.

In 1997, it was reported that Crowe was in talks to direct a biopic about Phil Spector, with Tom Cruise in talks to portray him. The film was to have been distributed by Universal Pictures. Crowe stated in 2005 that the film was unlikely to be made due to Spector&#x27;s murder of Lana Clarkson and conviction. It has also been said that the film was never made due to the failure of finding a third act to the story.

Crowe also attempted to make a biopic about Marvin Gaye titled &quot;My Name is Marvin&quot;. That project fell apart in 2010 due to casting and budget issues.

In 2023, it was announced that Crowe and singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell had been secretly working on a film of her life story to be directed by Crowe.

==Personal life==
Crowe married Nancy Wilson of the rock band Heart in July 1986. Their twin sons were born in January 2000. Crowe and Wilson separated in June 2008 and Wilson filed for divorce on September 23, 2010, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. The divorce was finalized on December 8, 2010.

In November 2024, Crowe&#x27;s girlfriend, Anais Smith, gave birth to a girl.

<text>The Eritrean Railway is the only railway system in Eritrea. It was constructed between 1887 and 1932 during the Italian Eritrea colony and connects the port of Massawa with Asmara. Originally it also connected to Bishia. The line was partly damaged by warfare in subsequent decades, but was rebuilt in the 1990s. Vintage equipment is still used on the line.

==Main railway line==
===Characteristics===

The railway was built during Italian Eritrea in order to connect Massawa and Asmara, the main cities of Eritrea. 

In the 1930s Italian leader Benito Mussolini wanted to reach Kassala in Sudan, but his war to conquer Ethiopia and create the Italian Empire stopped the enlargement to Agordat and Bishia.

After damage suffered by the railway during World War II, the section between Massawa and Asmara was dismantled partially and was only rebuilt in the 1990s by the Eritrean authorities.

The railway is narrow-gauge and is being rebuilt after the devastation wreaked upon it by the war of independence. Its newest equipment is over fifty years old, with most of it predating World War II.

It is one of the few railway systems still in existence (excluding tourist railways) using equipment like the 1930s Italian-built &#x27;Littorina&#x27; railcars and 1930s-vintage Mallet steam locomotives.
====Route====
The railway was fully opened in 1932. It ran from the port of Massawa westwards to Asmara, then extending northwards to Keren, Agordat and Bishia.

It was partially built from Bishia to Tesseney (and projected to reach Kassala, annexed to Eritrea in 1940 by the Italians) at the beginning of World War II, but this section was not finished when the Allies captured Eritrea in 1941.

Until 1978 even the route Asmara-Keren remained partially active. As of 2009, the section between Massawa and Asmara is open.

====950 mm gauge====
Eritrea was an Italian colony, and accordingly its railway was built by Italian engineers to Italian standards, using equipment bought from Italy. The gauge chosen was the Italian standard narrow-gauge measurement of , similar to many common narrow-gauge railways under construction in Italy at the same time.

With the short building time and the simultaneous flow of some common equipment and materials to the national railway yards, e.g. metallic plate ties (sleepers), it was necessary to acquire these from France to some extent.

A previous Italian law from 1879 officially established the track gauges, which specified the use of and gauge track measured from the centre of the rails, or and , respectively, on the inside faces.

===Construction===
Construction began from the Red Sea port city of Massawa in 1887, heading towards the capital city of Asmara. The &quot;Decauville&quot; railway was the first built, from Massaua to Saati, just 27 km. Progress was slow, thanks to the long climb up the mountains to the high plateau of inland Eritrea, and the substantial civil engineering works required; the line reached Asmara in 1911. It was extended to Keren in 1922, Agat in 1925, Agordat in 1928, and finally Bishia in 1932, for a total length of . Bishia (Biscia in Italian) proved to be the end, even though the builders had ambitions of reaching the Sudan Railways line. Mussolini&#x27;s invasion of Ethiopia led to resources being diverted elsewhere, including the upgrading of the line from Massawa to Asmara to handle more traffic.

Building the line from Massawa to Asmara was a significant undertaking. Even with the tighter turns and narrower right-of-way allowed by a narrow-gauge railway, the line required 65 bridges (including a fourteen-arch viaduct crossing the Obel River) and 39 tunnels, the longest being . Even so, there were still grades of more than 3%. The highest point on the railway is just east of Asmara at above sea level.

The construction of the railway was considered a fine achievement of the first half of the twentieth century.

===In operation===
In 1935, it carried supplies for the Italian war effort in Ethiopia and the line saw 30 trains daily, while by 1965 the line was carrying nearly half a million passengers a year as well as 200,000 tons of freight. Things went downhill from there. Improvements to the road from Massawa to Asmara, and to the trucks and buses that used it, began to take traffic away from the railway.

Until 1941, the railway was controlled by the Italians, but the fortunes of war allowed the British to take control. After 1942, the railway (damaged during the East Africa Campaign and by Italian guerrillas) was abandoned from Agordat to Biscia.

In 1953, Eritrea was joined to Ethiopia in Federation as the British pulled out, giving Ethiopia a coastline, but starting off 40 years of unrest and eventually war. The first Director General of the railway was Yacob Zanios, a former railway executive from Dire Dawa, who was appointed by HIM Emperor Haile Sellassie to assume management of the railway from the British and organize, rebuild the infrastructure, and integrate the railway into the national transportation grid. Under the four-year leadership of Yacob Zanios, the railway became operational and a very successful enterprise.

The 1950s and 1960s were successful years for the railway, but in the 1970s the railway fell more and more out of use as the mismanagement of the railway and political unrest intensified, and in 1975 the railway was destroyed by the ruling Derg regime in Ethiopia. Much of the infrastructure was destroyed during the following years of war, and both sides used materials salvaged from the railway for fortification and other purposes.

===Rebuilding===

Eritrea won its independence from Ethiopia in 1993, and in 1994 the Eritrean president declared that rebuilding the railway was a priority for the new nation. During the war years a spirit of self-reliance had been built up, and the Eritreans refused foreign loans and expensive rework. Instead, the Eritreans decided, they would rebuild what they had left with their own efforts. Rebuilding the line started, some work going into rebuilding the workshops and station in Asmara while others set to reconstructing the Massawa end. Renovation of the main line began from Massawa westbound, recovering rails and steel ties.

At the same time, restoration began on the remaining locomotives and rolling stock remaining after the conflict. Eleven steam locomotives survived, and at least six have been rebuilt to working order. In addition, several 1930s vintage Fiat &#x27;Littorina&#x27; railcars survive and have been made operational, as well as two of the 1957 Krupp-built B&#x27;B&#x27;-dh diesel-hydraulics (the line&#x27;s newest locomotives) and one of three surviving Drewry shunters, brought to the railway by the British during the war years. Finally, several road trucks have been converted to run on rail wheels. Much freight stock and a number of passenger cars also survive.

The line has been restored from Massawa to Asmara, but no scheduled services traverse the whole length of the line. Charter trains for tourists now do, and regular train services exist in certain areas. While the surviving equipment is sufficient for such a limited service, the purchase or building of more is necessary to provide a serious form of transportation over the length of the line. In 2007, The Eritrean Railroad Authority requested funding to continue the Italian-era plan to extend the route to Tesseney and provide an opportunity for Sudan to efficiently use the Port of Massawa. Mining companies in Eritrea have also inquired about use of the railway and its improvement.

The surviving freight cars include a number of larger boxcars suitable for a limited freight service.

===Equipment===

====Steam locomotives====
Three classes of steam locomotive still exist; one design of 0-4-0 shunter and two designs of 0-4-4-0 Mallet for line service.

=====202 Series=====

These small 0-4-0 tank engines were and are the standard shunter locomotives of the system, built between 1927 and 1937 by the firm of Breda in Milan. They have short side tanks, a rear coal bunker, and a unified, oval dome containing the steam dome inside a larger sand dome. This arrangement, popular worldwide in nations that favored the sand dome, helped both to insulate the steam dome and to keep the sand dry with the warmth. Large, prominent builder&#x27;s plates adorn the domes. They utilise Walschaerts valve gear with piston valves and superheating, and are painted in the traditional European style of red below the running board, including frames and wheels, and black above, including boiler, cab, tanks etc. The purpose of the red paint is to make cracks and breakages in the locomotive&#x27;s important running gear more obvious.

Six of these engines survive, of which two were in running order and four in storage awaiting restoration.

=====440 Series=====
One of these early Mallet locomotives, which is a true Mallet and thus a compound, still exists in storage at the Asmara workshops. It was a 1915 product of Ansaldo in Genova.

=====442 Series=====
These later, and much larger, compound Mallet locomotives were built by Ansaldo in Genova in 1938 to largely replace the earlier types, both the 440 Series and the unsuccessful 441 Series. The latter were simple locomotives (i.e., non-compound) and found liable to run out of steam on the heavy grades of the line. Four of them are still in existence of which three are in running order.
These are the prime main-line steam locomotives of the railway, and are in high demand for tourist services. Two of them, double headed, are required to scale the steepest grades with a train of any length. Like the other locomotives they are tank engines with large side tanks and a rear coal bunker, under cover of the cab roof in this design.

====Diesel locomotives====
In 1937 TIBB designed a Bo&#x27;Bo&#x27;-de (diesel-electric) locomotive of 550 hp weighing 44 tonnes, which, however, never operated in Eritrea due to WW II activities. 
The railway possesses five diesel locomotives today. They are in the process of being returned to working order.
Further, a project of sending 11 Italian yard-switchers (Badoni, Ranzi, Greco/Deutz, Zephyr RoadRailer switch locos) to Asmara changing couplers and buffing gear, and re-gauging them to 950 mm was to have been finished by 2018. To be recognized by their yellow livery. 

=====Krupp B&#x27;B&#x27;-dh roadswitchers=====
The railway purchased four Krupp-built 630 hp, 48-tonne, B&#x27;B&#x27;-dh road switcher locomotives ## 25D - 28D, of typical German offset-cab design in 1957, the newest motive power owned by the system and the only locomotives purchased after World War II. With two of them (## 26D, 28D) having been destroyed by war activities, the remaining two units (## 25D, 27D) are still (intermittently) in working order. In view of the peculiar Krupp-Lysholm-Smith hydrodynamic transmission, spares supplies are proving a problem. When the line&#x27;s rehabilitation and rebuilding is complete, it is intended to use them for hauling freight. The roadswitchers are painted in a creamy white with brown frames and trucks.

=====Drewry shunters=====
Three Drewry Car Co. built diesel shunters are owned by the railway, and were brought to Eritrea by the British after their takeover in 1941. They were previously in service in the Sudan and were of a slightly wider gauge () there; they were regauged to the railway&#x27;s gauge by turning them from an outside framed to an inside framed layout. Two are 0-6-0s and one is an 0-4-0; one of each is working while the third is under repair. They are painted in the same scheme as the Krupp units but lacking their bonnet sides and the engines are exposed.

====Railcars====
Three Fiat-built &#x27;Littorina&#x27; railcars survived the civil war and two are in working order. They are Art Deco in style, with large Fiat radiators on the front. The bodies are painted in creamy white with grey underneath and roofs with red &#x27;bumpers&#x27; on the ends and a red stripe separating the body color from the grey below. They are intended for tourist service; new vehicles will be built or bought for regular passenger service.

In addition, one 4-wheel railcar built by Brown Boveri of Switzerland exists out of service in the Asmara shops. It was apparently being used as a mobile generator car before the civil war. It was originally built for Italian Somaliland Railway.

For maintenance an improvised maintenance car is used, a four-wheeler built from a motor-cycle.

====Rail trucks====
A number of Russian-built Orion light trucks have been converted to run on rail wheels. At present, they are being used in the railway&#x27;s reconstruction.

====Passenger cars====
A number of passenger cars, all mounted on two four-wheel trucks, survive. They are fitted with wooden seats and have a platform at each end, one of which is for the brakeman – there are no continuous train brakes on the railway, and braking is either done with the locomotive&#x27;s brakes or by manually applying the brakes on each car. They are now painted in an attractive livery of white with pale blue in a stripe above the windows and at the bottom of the bodywork.

====Freight cars====
Abandoned goods wagons sit on sidings near Asmara, and are being restored. Priority is being given to the 8-wheel (2 x 4-wheel truck) boxcars and flatcars, but a large number of 4-wheel (two wheelsets) cars still exist.

====Couplings and brakes====
Locos and wagons are equipped with a single centre buffer with a hook and screw chain underneath. There are no continuous brakes; instead a brakeman travels on each coach to apply braking when required. However, a picture of a tank car shows hoses for some kind of continuous brake.

====Loading gauge====

The structure gauge of the Eritrean Railway is small. Therefore, two test runs, one in 2006 another one in spring 2010 took place when ISO containers were carried on traditional flat wagons through all the tunnels along the line. In December 2010 two ISO Containers of Maersk Line with equipment donated by the Danish State Railway for the rail workshops in Asmara travelled all the line with no problems. It is not clear if the containers were high or high.

==Complementary railway lines==
The Eritrean Railway was complemented by the Asmara-Massawa Cableway, and by a small transport railway between Mersa Fatma and Colulli, nearly south of Massawa.

===Asmara-Massawa Cableway===
The Asmara-Massawa Cableway was built by Italy in the 1930s, and connected the port of Massawa with the city of Asmara. The cableway was the longest of its kind in the world at the time of its inauguration. It had 13 stations with diesel engines, with 1620 little transport wagons. The British later dismantled it during their eleven-year occupation, after defeating Italy in World War II.

===Mersa Fatma–Colulli Railway===
A long gauge potash transport railway located between Massawa and Assab. A gauge line was built in 1905 by the Italians inside the port of Mersa Fatma and from it into the hinterland until Colluli near the current Ethiopian border in the Danakil depression with the terminus roughly below sea level. Potash production is said to have reached about after this railway was constructed. Production was stopped some years after World War I owing to large-scale supplies mainly from Germany. Unsuccessful attempts to reopen large scale production were made in the period 1920–1941 by the Italian government. Between the years 1925–1929 an Italian company mined of sylvite, averaging 70% KCl, which was transported by rail to Mersa Fatma. The company was the main source of potash in Eritrea and it had to cease most operations because of the Great Depression of 1929.

<text>The 7400 series is a popular logic family of transistor–transistor logic (TTL) integrated circuits (ICs).

In 1964, Texas Instruments introduced the SN5400 series of logic chips, in a ceramic semiconductor package. A low-cost plastic package SN7400 series was introduced in 1966 which quickly gained over 50% of the logic chip market, and eventually becoming &quot;de facto&quot; standardized electronic components. Since the introduction of the original bipolar-transistor TTL parts, pin-compatible parts were introduced with such features as low power CMOS technology and lower supply voltages. Surface mount packages exist for several popular logic family functions.

== Overview ==
The 7400 series contains hundreds of devices that provide everything from basic logic gates, flip-flops, and counters, to special purpose bus transceivers and arithmetic logic units (ALU). Specific functions are described in a list of 7400 series integrated circuits. Some TTL logic parts were made with an extended military-specification temperature range. These parts are prefixed with 54 instead of 74 in the part number. The less-common 64 and 84 prefixes on Texas Instruments parts indicated an industrial temperature range. Since the 1970s, new product families have been released to replace the original 7400 series. More recent TTL-compatible logic families were manufactured using CMOS or BiCMOS technology rather than TTL.

Today, surface-mounted CMOS versions of the 7400 series are used in various applications in electronics and for glue logic in computers and industrial electronics. The original through-hole devices in dual in-line packages (DIP/DIL) were the mainstay of the industry for many decades. They are useful for rapid breadboard-prototyping and for education and remain available from most manufacturers. The fastest types and very low voltage versions are typically surface-mount only, however.

The first part number in the series, the 7400, is a 14-pin IC containing four two-input NAND gates. Each gate uses two input pins and one output pin, with the remaining two pins being power (+5 V) and ground. This part was made in various through-hole and surface-mount packages, including flat pack and plastic/ceramic dual in-line. Additional characters in a part number identify the package and other variations.

Unlike the older resistor-transistor logic integrated circuits, bipolar TTL gates were unsuitable to be used as analog devices, providing low gain, poor stability, and low input impedance. Special-purpose TTL devices were used to provide interface functions such as Schmitt triggers or monostable multivibrator timing circuits. Inverting gates could be cascaded as a ring oscillator, useful for purposes where high stability was not required.

=== History ===
Although the 7400 series was the first &quot;de facto&quot; industry standard TTL logic family (i.e. second-sourced by several semiconductor companies), there were earlier TTL logic families such as:
* Sylvania Universal High-level Logic in 1963
* Motorola MC4000 MTTL
* National Semiconductor DM8000
* Fairchild 9300 series
* Signetics 8200 and 8T00

The 7400 quad 2-input NAND gate was the first product in the series, introduced by Texas Instruments in a military grade metal flat package (5400W) in October 1964. The pin assignment of this early series differed from the &quot;de facto&quot; standard set by the later series in DIP packages (in particular, ground was connected to pin 11 and the power supply to pin 4, compared to pins 7 and 14 for DIP packages). The extremely popular commercial grade plastic DIP (7400N) followed in the third quarter of 1966.

The 5400 and 7400 series were used in many popular minicomputers in the 1970s and early 1980s. Some models of the DEC PDP-series &#x27;minis&#x27; used the 74181 ALU as the main computing element in the CPU. Other examples were the Data General Nova series and Hewlett-Packard 21MX, 1000, and 3000 series.

In 1965, typical quantity-one pricing for the SN5400 (military grade, in ceramic welded flat-pack) was around 22 USD. As of 2007, individual commercial-grade chips in molded epoxy (plastic) packages can be purchased for approximately US$0.25 each, depending on the particular chip.

== Families ==

7400 series parts were constructed using bipolar junction transistors (BJT), forming what is referred to as transistor–transistor logic or TTL. Newer series, more or less compatible in function and logic level with the original parts, use CMOS technology or a combination of the two (BiCMOS). Originally the bipolar circuits provided higher speed but consumed more power than the competing 4000 series of CMOS devices. Bipolar devices are also limited to a fixed power-supply voltage, typically 5 V, while CMOS parts often support a range of supply voltages.

Milspec-rated devices for use in extended temperature conditions are available as the 5400 series. Texas Instruments also manufactured radiation-hardened devices with the prefix &quot;RSN&quot;, and the company offered beam-lead bare dies for integration into hybrid circuits with a &quot;BL&quot; prefix designation.

Regular-speed TTL parts were also available for a time in the 6400 series these had an extended industrial temperature range of −40 °C to +85 °C. While companies such as Mullard listed 6400-series compatible parts in 1970 data sheets, by 1973 there was no mention of the 6400 family in the Texas Instruments &quot;TTL Data Book&quot;. Texas Instruments brought back the 6400 series in 1989 for the SN64BCT540. The SN64BCTxxx series is still in production as of 2023. Some companies have also offered industrial extended temperature range variants using the regular 7400-series part numbers with a prefix or suffix to indicate the temperature grade.

As integrated circuits in the 7400 series were made in different technologies, usually compatibility was retained with the original TTL logic levels and power-supply voltages. An integrated circuit made in CMOS is not a TTL chip, since it uses field-effect transistors (FETs) and not bipolar junction transistors (BJT), but similar part numbers are retained to identify similar logic functions and electrical (power and I/O voltage) compatibility in the different subfamilies.

Over 40 different logic subfamilies use this standardized part number scheme. The headings in the following table are: &quot;V&quot;cc power-supply voltage; &quot;t&quot;pd maximum gate delay; &quot;I&quot;OL maximum output current at low level; &quot;I&quot;OH maximum output current at high level; &quot;t&quot;pd, &quot;I&quot;OL, and &quot;I&quot;OH apply to most gates in a given family. Driver or buffer gates have higher output currents.

Many parts in the CMOS HC, AC, AHC, and VHC families are also offered in &quot;T&quot; versions (HCT, ACT, AHCT and VHCT) which have input thresholds that are compatible with both TTL and 3.3 V CMOS signals. The non-T parts have conventional CMOS input thresholds, which are more restrictive than TTL thresholds. Typically, CMOS input thresholds require high-level signals to be at least 70% of Vcc and low-level signals to be at most 30% of Vcc. (TTL has the input high level above 2.0 V and the input low level below 0.8 V, so a TTL high-level signal could be in the forbidden middle range for 5 V CMOS.)

The 74H family is the same basic design as the 7400 family with resistor values reduced. This reduced the typical propagation delay from 9 ns to 6 ns but increased the power consumption. The 74H family provided a number of unique devices for CPU designs in the 1970s. Many designers of military and aerospace equipment used this family over a long period and as they need exact replacements, this family is still produced by Lansdale Semiconductor.

The 74S family, using Schottky circuitry, uses more power than the 74, but is faster. The 74LS family of ICs is a lower-power version of the 74S family, with slightly higher speed but lower power dissipation than the original 74 family; it became the most popular variant once it was widely available. Many 74LS ICs can be found in microcomputers and digital consumer electronics manufactured in the 1980s and early 1990s.

The 74F family was introduced by Fairchild Semiconductor and adopted by other manufacturers; it is faster than the 74, 74LS and 74S families.

Through the late 1980s and 1990s newer versions of this family were introduced to support the lower operating voltages used in newer CPU devices.

== Part numbering ==

Part number schemes varied by manufacturer. The part numbers for 7400-series logic devices often use the following designators:
* Often first, a two or three letter prefix, denoting the manufacturer and flow class of the device. These codes are no longer closely associated with a single manufacturer, for example, Fairchild Semiconductor manufactures parts with MM and DM prefixes, and no prefixes. Examples:
** SN: Texas Instruments using a commercial processing
** SNV: Texas Instruments using military processing
** M: ST Microelectronics
** DM: National Semiconductor
** UT: Cobham PLC
** SG: Sylvania
* Two digits for temperature range. Examples:
** 54: military temperature range
** 64: short-lived historical series with intermediate &quot;industrial&quot; temperature range
** 74: commercial temperature range device
* Zero to four letters denoting the logic subfamily. Examples:
** zero letters: basic bipolar TTL
** LS: low power Schottky
** HCT: High-speed CMOS compatible with TTL
* Two or more arbitrarily assigned digits that identify the function of the device. There are hundreds of different devices in each family.
* Additional suffix letters and numbers may be appended to denote the package type, quality grade, or other information, but this varies widely by manufacturer.

For example, &quot;SN5400N&quot; signifies that the part is a 7400-series IC probably manufactured by Texas Instruments (&quot;SN&quot; originally meaning &quot;Semiconductor Network&quot;) using commercial processing, is of the military temperature rating (&quot;54&quot;), and is of the TTL family (absence of a family designator), its function being the &quot;quad 2-input NAND gate&quot; (&quot;00&quot;) implemented in a plastic through-hole DIP package (&quot;N&quot;).

Many logic families maintain a consistent use of the device numbers as an aid to designers. Often a part from a different 74x00 subfamily could be substituted (&quot;drop-in replacement&quot;) in a circuit, with the same function and pin-out yet more appropriate characteristics for an application (perhaps speed or power consumption), which was a large part of the appeal of the 74C00 series over the competing CD4000B series, for example. But there are a few exceptions where incompatibilities (mainly in pin-out) across the subfamilies occurred, such as:
* some flat-pack devices (e.g. 7400W) and surface-mount devices,
* some of the faster CMOS series (for example 74AC),
* a few low-power TTL devices (e.g. 74L86, 74L9 and 74L95) have a different pin-out than the regular (or even 74LS) series part.
* five versions of the 74x54 (4-wide AND-OR-INVERT gates IC), namely 7454(N), 7454W, 74H54, 74L54W and 74L54N/74LS54, are different from each other in pin-out and/or function,

== Second sources from Europe and Eastern Bloc ==
 
Some manufacturers, such as Mullard and Siemens, had pin-compatible TTL parts, but with a completely different numbering scheme; however, data sheets identified the &quot;7400-compatible&quot; number as an aid to recognition.

At the time the 7400 series was being made, some European manufacturers (that traditionally followed the Pro Electron naming convention), such as Philips/Mullard, produced a series of TTL integrated circuits with part names beginning with FJ. Some examples of FJ series are:
* FJH101 (=7430) single 8-input NAND gate,
* FJH131 (=7400) quadruple 2-input NAND gate,
* FJH181 (=7454N or J) 2+2+2+2 input AND-OR-NOT gate.

The Soviet Union started manufacturing TTL ICs with 7400-series pinout in the late 1960s and early 1970s, such as the K155ЛA3, which was pin-compatible with the 7400 part available in the United States, except for using a metric spacing of 2.5 mm between pins instead of the pin-to-pin spacing used in the west.
Another peculiarity of the Soviet-made 7400 series was the packaging material used in the 1970s–1980s. Instead of the ubiquitous black resin, they had a brownish-green body colour with subtle swirl marks created during the moulding process. It was jokingly referred to in the Eastern Bloc electronics industry as the &quot;elephant-dung packaging&quot;, due to its appearance.

The Soviet integrated circuit designation is different from the Western series:
* the technology modifications were considered different series and were identified by different numbered prefixes – К155 series is equivalent to plain 74, К555 series is 74LS, К1533 is 74ALS, etc.;
* the function of the unit is described with a two-letter code followed by a number:
** the first letter represents the functional group – logical, triggers, counters, multiplexers, etc.;
** the second letter shows the functional subgroup, making the distinction between logical NAND and NOR, D- and JK-triggers, decimal and binary counters, etc.;
** the number distinguishes variants with different number of inputs or different number of elements within a die – ЛА1/ЛА2/ЛА3 (LA1/LA2/LA3) are 2 four-input / 1 eight-input / 4 two-input NAND elements respectively (equivalent to 7420/7430/7400).
Before July 1974 the two letters from the functional description were inserted after the first digit of the series. Examples: К1ЛБ551 and К155ЛА1 (7420), К1ТМ552 and К155ТМ2 (7474) are the same ICs made at different times.

Clones of the 7400 series were also made in other Eastern Bloc countries:
* Bulgaria (Mikroelektronika Botevgrad) used a designation somewhat similar to that of the Soviet Union, e.g. &quot;1ЛБ00ШМ&quot; (1LB00ShM) for a 74LS00. Some of the two-letter functional groups were borrowed from the Soviet designation, while others differed. Unlike the Soviet scheme, the two or three digit number after the functional group matched the western counterpart. The series followed at the end (i.e. &quot;ШМ&quot; for LS). Only the LS series is known to have been manufactured in Bulgaria.
* Czechoslovakia (TESLA) used the 7400 numbering scheme with manufacturer prefix MH. Example: MH7400. Tesla also produced industrial grade (8400, −25 ° to 85 °C) and military grade (5400, −55 ° to 125 °C) ones.
* Poland (Unitra CEMI) used the 7400 numbering scheme with manufacturer prefixes UCA for the 5400 and 6400 series, as well as UCY for the 7400 series. Examples: UCA6400, UCY7400. Note that ICs with the prefix MCY74 correspond to the 4000 series (e.g. MCY74002 corresponds to 4002 and not to 7402).
* Hungary (Tungsram, later Mikroelektronikai Vállalat / MEV) also used the 7400 numbering scheme, but with manufacturer suffix – 7400 is marked as 7400APC.
* Romania (I.P.R.S.) used a trimmed 7400 numbering with the manufacturer prefix CDB (example: CDB4123E corresponds to 74123) for the 74 and 74H series, where the suffix &quot;H&quot; indicated the 74H series. For the later 74LS series, the standard numbering was used.
* East Germany (HFO) also used trimmed 7400 numbering without manufacturer prefix or suffix. The prefix D (or E) designates digital IC, and not the manufacturer. Example: D174 is 7474. 74LS clones were designated by the prefix DL; e.g. DL000 = 74LS00. In later years East German made clones were also available with standard 74* numbers, usually for export.

A number of different technologies were available from the Soviet Union,

Czechoslovakia,

Poland, and East Germany. The 8400 series in the table below indicates an industrial temperature range from −25 °C to +85 °C (as opposed to −40 °C to +85 °C for the 6400 series).

Around 1990 the production of standard logic ceased in all Eastern European countries except the Soviet Union and later Russia and Belarus. As of 2016, the series 133, К155, 1533, КР1533, 1554, 1594, and 5584 were in production at &quot;Integral&quot; in Belarus,
as well as the series 130 and 530 at &quot;NZPP-KBR&quot;,
134 and 5574 at &quot;VZPP&quot;,
533 at &quot;Svetlana&quot;,
1564, К1564, КР1564 at &quot;NZPP&quot;,
1564, К1564 at &quot;Voshod&quot;,
1564 at &quot;Exiton&quot;,
and 133, 530, 533, 1533 at &quot;Mikron&quot; in Russia.
The Russian company Angstrem manufactures 54HC circuits as the 5514БЦ1 series, 54AC as the 5514БЦ2 series, and 54LVC as the 5524БЦ2 series.

<text>The M14 rifle, officially the United States Rifle, Caliber 7.62 mm, M14, is an American battle rifle chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge. It became the standard-issue rifle for the U.S. military in 1957, replacing the M1 Garand rifle in service with the U.S. Army by 1958 and the U.S. Marine Corps by 1965; deliveries of service rifles to the U.S. Army began in 1959. The M14 was used by the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps for Basic and Advanced Individual Training from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s.

The M14 was the last American battle rifle issued in quantity to U.S. military personnel. In 1967, it was officially replaced by the M16 assault rifle, a lighter weapon with a smaller 5.56×45mm intermediate cartridge. The M14 rifle remains in limited service across all branches of the U.S. military, with variants used as sniper and designated marksman rifles, accurized competition weapons, and ceremonial weapons by honor guards, color guards, drill teams, and ceremonial guards. Civilian semiautomatic variants are used for hunting, target shooting, and shooting competitions.

The M14 served as the basis for the M21 and M25 sniper rifles, which were eventually replaced by the M24 Sniper Weapon System. A new variant of the M14, the Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle, has been in service since 2002.

==History==

===Early development===
The M14&#x27;s development stemmed from an extensive line of experimental weapons based on the M1 Garand rifle. Although the M1 was among the most advanced infantry rifle designs of the late 1930s, it was not without faults, as various modifications to the basic M1 were considered during the last months of World War II. Changes included the addition of fully automatic fire and the replacement of the eight-round &quot;en bloc&quot; clip with a detachable box magazine holding 20 rounds. Winchester, Remington, and Springfield Armory&#x27;s John Garand offered alternate conversions. Garand&#x27;s design, the T20, was the most popular, and T20 prototypes served as the basis for several Springfield test rifles from 1945 through the early 1950s.
In 1945, Earle Harvey of Springfield Armory designed an entirely different rifle, the T25, for the new T65 .30 light rifle cartridge (7.62×49mm). This was at the direction of Col. Rene Studler, then serving in the Pentagon. Harvey and Studler were then transferred to Springfield Armory in late 1945, to continuously develop the T25. The T25 was designed to use the T65 service cartridge, a Frankford Arsenal design based upon the .30-06 cartridge used in the M1, but shortened to the same length as the .300 Savage. Although shorter than the .30-06, meaning less powder capacity, the T65 cartridge retained the ballistics and energy of the .30-06, which can be attributed to the use of a recently developed ball powder designed by Olin Industries. After experimenting with several bullet designs, the T65 was finalized for adoption as the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge. Olin Industries later introduced the cartridge to the commercial market as the .308 Winchester. After a series of revisions by Earle Harvey and the other members of the .30 light rifle design group following the 1950 Fort Benning tests, the T25 was renamed the T47.

The T44 prototype rifle was a conventional design developed at Springfield Armory as an alternative to the T47. With minimal funding available, the earliest T44 prototypes used T20E2 receivers fitted with magazine filler blocks and rebarreled for the 7.62×51mm cartridge. Additionally, the long operating rod/piston of the M1 was replaced by the T47&#x27;s gas cut-off system. Though not principally designed by any single engineer, Lloyd Corbett is credited for several refinements to the T44 design. Refinements included the addition of a bolt roller intended to reduce friction and a straight operating rod.

===Infantry Board service rifle trials===
The T44 was tested in a competitive service rifle competition conducted by the Infantry Board at Fort Benning, Georgia against the Springfield T47 (a modified T25) and the T48, a variant of Fabrique Nationale&#x27;s FN FAL (from &quot;Fusil Automatique Leger&quot;, French for &quot;light automatic rifle&quot;). The T47 did not have a bolt roller and performed worse than both the T44 and the T48 in dust and cold-weather tests. Thus, it was dropped from consideration in 1953. During 1952–53, testing proved the T48 and the T44 to be roughly comparable in performance, with the T48 holding an advantage in ease of field stripping and dust resistance, and a longer product development lead time. A &quot;Newsweek&quot; article in July 1953 speculated that the T48/FAL could have been selected over the T44. During the winter of 1953–54, both rifles competed in the winter rifle trials at U.S. Army facilities in the Arctic. Springfield Armory engineers, anxious to ensure the selection of the T44, had been specially preparing and modifying the test T44 rifles for weeks with the aid of the armory&#x27;s cold chamber, including a redesign of the T44 gas regulator and custom modifications to magazines and other parts to reduce friction and seizing in extreme cold. The T48 rifles received no such special preparation and in the continued cold-weather testing began to experience sluggish gas system functioning, aggravated by the T48&#x27;s close-fitting surfaces between bolt and carrier, and carrier and receiver. FN engineers opened the gas ports in an attempt to improve functioning, but this caused early/violent extraction and broken parts as a result of the increased pressures. As a result, the T44 was ranked superior in cold-weather operation to the T48. The Arctic Test Board report made it clear that the T48 needed improvement and that the U.S. would not adopt the T48 until it had successfully completed another round of Arctic tests the following winter.

In June 1954, funding became available to manufacture newly fabricated T44 receivers specially designed for the shorter T65 cartridge. This single change to the T44 design saved a pound over the M1 Garand. Tests at Fort Benning with the T44 and T48 continued through the summer and fall of 1956. By this time, the T48/FAL rifles had been so improved that malfunction rates were almost as low as the T44.

The T44 was selected over the T48/FAL due to lower weight, simplicity with fewer parts, the T44&#x27;s self-compensating gas system, and because the T44 could supposedly be manufactured on existing machinery built for the M1 rifle (which was later found to be false). In 1957, the U.S. formally adopted the T44 as the U.S. infantry service rifle designated M14.

===Production contracts===
Initial production contracts for the M14 were awarded to the Springfield Armory, Winchester, and Harrington &amp; Richardson. Thompson-Ramo-Wooldridge Inc. (TRW) was later awarded a production contract for the rifle, as well. In all, 1,376,031 M14 service rifles were produced from 1959 to 1964.

====National Match M14====
Springfield Armory produced 6,641 new M14 NM rifles in 1962 and 1963, while TRW produced 4,874 new M14 NM rifles in 1964. Springfield Armory later upgraded 2,094 M14 rifles in 1965 and 2,395 M14 rifles in 1966 to National Match specifications, while 2,462 M14 rifles were rebuilt to National Match standards in 1967 at the Rock Island Arsenal. In total, 11,130 National Match rifles were delivered by Springfield Armory, Rock Island Arsenal, and TRW during 1962–1967.

Production M14 rifles made by Springfield Armory and Winchester used forged receivers and bolts milled from AISI 8620 steel, a low-carbon steel with added molybdenum-chromium. Harrington &amp; Richardson M14 production used AISI 8620 steel, as well, except for 10 receivers milled from AISI 1330 low-carbon steel and a single receiver made from a high-nickel alloy steel.

===Deployment===
After the M14&#x27;s adoption, Springfield Armory began tooling a new production line in 1958, delivering the first service rifles to the U.S. Army in July 1959. Long production delays, though, resulted in the 101st Airborne Division being the only unit in the army fully equipped with the M14 by the end of 1960. The Fleet Marine Force finally completed the change from M1s to M14s in late 1961. Springfield Armory records reflect that M14 manufacture ended as TRW, fulfilling its second contract, delivered its final production increment in the fiscal year 1965 (1 July 1964 – 30 June 1965). The Springfield archive also indicates the 1.38 million rifles were acquired for just over $143 million, for a unit cost of about $104.

The M14 was developed to replace four different weapons: the M1 Garand, the M3 submachine gun, the M1 carbine, and the M1918 Browning automatic rifle (BAR). The intention was to simplify the logistical requirements of the troops by limiting the types of ammunition and parts needed to be supplied, but replacing all these weapons proved to be an impossible task; the M14 was deemed &quot;completely inferior&quot; to even the World War II M1 Garand in a September 1962 report by the comptroller for the U.S. Department of Defense. The cartridge was too powerful for the submachine gun role and not powerful enough to serve as a light machine gun replacement for the M1918 BAR.
The rifle was unwieldy in the thick brush of Vietnam due to its length and weight, and the traditional wood stocks made of walnut and birch tended to swell and expand in the heavy moisture of the jungle, adversely affecting accuracy. Fiberglass stocks were produced to resolve this problem, but the rifle was discontinued before the fiberglass stocks could be distributed for field use. With 2,560 ft·lbf (3,463 J) of muzzle energy, the power of the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge was valued for its range and cover penetration; despite this, the power of the cartridge also caused the weapon to be virtually uncontrollable in fully automatic fire. As a result, most M14s were permanently set to semiautomatic fire only, to avoid wasting ammunition in combat. Although marred by numerous shortcomings, the rifle served during its brief tour of duty with some modest success.

===Replacement===
Within the Army research and development community, disputes arose between factions that supported the adoption of the M14 and the 7.62×51mm round from their inception and the other factions that opposed them. The M14 remained the primary infantry rifle in Vietnam until it was replaced by the M16 in 1967, though combat engineer units kept them for several years longer. Further procurement of the M14 was abruptly halted in early 1968 due to a U.S. Department of Defense report which stated that the AR-15, which would soon be designated the M16, was superior to the M14. A series of tests by the U.S. Department of the Army following the report resulted in the decision to cancel the M14, although the DOD did not cancel the previous FY 1963 orders to be delivered. The M16 was ordered as a replacement for the M14 by the direction of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in 1964, over the objection of the U.S. Army officers who had backed the M14. Though production of the M14 was officially discontinued, some discontented troops managed to persist with them while deriding the early-model M16 as a frail and underpowered &quot;Mattel toy&quot; that was prone to jamming. A Congressional investigation later discovered these characteristics to be the result of intentional attempts by Army bureaucracy to sabotage the M16&#x27;s field performance in Vietnam. In late 1967, the U.S. Army designated the M16 as the &quot;Standard A&quot; rifle, and the M14 became a &quot;Limited Standard&quot; weapon. The M14 rifle remained the standard rifle for U.S. Army Basic Training and troops stationed in Europe until 1970.

The U.S. Army converted several thousand M14s into M21 sniper rifles, which remained standard issue for this purpose until the adoption of the M24 SWS in 1988.

In 1969, tooling for the M14 was sold to Taiwan, and many rifles were exported later to Baltic countries and Israel.

===Post-1970 U.S. military service===
Although the M14 was phased out as the standard-issue rifle by 1970, M14 variants are still used by various branches of the U.S. military, as well as other armed forces, especially as a sniper rifle and as a designated marksman rifle (DMR), due to its accuracy and effectiveness at long range. In 1989, the Marine Corps began a program to upgrade their M14s into DMRs. The final product created by the Precision Weapons Section in Marine Corps Base Quantico was called the Marine Corps DMR and was intended for use by security teams (Special Reaction Team and Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team companies), and Marine scout snipers in the cases where a semiautomatic rifle would be more appropriate than the standard bolt-action M40A1/A3 rifle. The USMC Rifle Team currently uses the M14 in shooting competitions.
Some original-production M14s, not to be confused with M21 rifles, were in use by the Army until the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, when they began to be employed as DMRs and sniper rifles. A 2009 study conducted by the Army claimed that half of the engagements in Afghanistan occurred from beyond . American 5.56×45mm NATO service rifles were ineffective at these ranges, which prompted the reissue of thousands of M14s. Common modifications included scopes, fiberglass stocks, and other accessories.
The 1st Battalion of the 3rd United States Infantry Regiment (&quot;The Old Guard&quot;) in the Military District of Washington is the sole remaining regular U.S. Army combat field unit where the M14 is still issued as the standard rifle, along with a chromed bayonet and an extra wooden stock with a white sling for military funerals, parades, and other ceremonies. The United States Air Force Honor Guard uses a version of the M14. The U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard and Base Honor Guards also use the M14 for three-volley salutes in military funerals. It is also the drill and parade rifle of the United States Military Academy, United States Naval Academy, United States Air Force Academy, The Citadel, Norwich University, Virginia Military Institute, and the University of North Georgia. U.S. Navy ships carry several M14s in their armories. They are issued to sailors going on watch out on deck in port, and to backup alert forces. The M14 is also used to shoot a large rubber projectile to another ship when underway to start the lines over for alongside refueling and replenishment.
Various sniper variants have been used by the United States Navy SEALs. Often mistaken for the M21 in the overt literature, only one of them has received a standard name in the U.S. military designations system: the M25 Sniper Weapon System, developed by the Special Forces. SEALs also use the Mk 14 Mod 0 Enhanced Battle Rifle for battle and in a designated marksman role. &quot;Delta Force&quot; units are known to have used M14 sniper variants. Eric L. Haney indicated in his memoir &quot;Inside Delta Force&quot; that every soldier going through the Operator Training Course trained on the M14. According to &quot;Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War&quot;, an account of the Battle of Mogadishu, Sergeant First Class Randy Shughart used an M14 for sniping from helicopters to provide support fire to ground troops.

The U.S. Army Special Forces (&quot;Green Berets&quot;) have made some use of the M25 &quot;spotter rifle&quot;. The M25 was developed in the late 1980s within the 10th Special Forces Group, which was charged to support Special Forces sniper weapons and the Special Operations Target Interdiction Course (SOTIC). The M25 was first planned as a replacement for the old M21, but after the Army adoption of the M24 SWS as its standard sniper rifle, the M25 was intended to be used by spotters of the sniper teams, while the snipers use the bolt-action M24.

The M14 has remained in service longer than any other U.S. infantry rifle, surpassing the M1903 Springfield rifle, and holds the distinction of serving one of the shortest periods as the standard infantry service rifle of the U.S. Army, only second to the US Springfield Krag–Jørgensen rifles and carbines.

===International service===
The Philippines issues M14 rifles, M1/M2 carbines, M1 rifles, and M16 rifles, to their civilian defense forces and various cadet corps service academies. The Hellenic Navy uses the M14.

In 1967, the Springfield tooling and assembly line for M14 production was sold to the Republic of China, also known as Taiwan. In 1968, the State Arsenal of the Republic of China began producing the Type 57 rifle, and from 1969 to the present, produced over 1 million Type 57 rifles. The Type 57 is currently in service with airport guards and the reserves.

==Rifle design==

===Receiver markings===
Stamped into receiver heel:
* U.S. Rifle
* 7.62-MM M14
* Springfield Armory (or commercial contractor name)
* Serial number

===Stock===
The M14 rifle was first furnished with a walnut stock, then with birch, and finally with a synthetic fiberglass stock due to the moisture in the humid jungle environments of rural Vietnam causing wood to swell. The stock was fitted with a hinged shoulder rest for improved user comfort when firing from a prone position. Original-equipment walnut and birch stocks carry the Department of Defense acceptance stamp or cartouche, consisting of an arc of three stars above a spread-winged eagle. After successful test firing, a proof stamp was also applied to these stocks consisting of a letter &quot;P&quot; within a circle.

Rifles manufactured through late 1960 were provided with walnut handguards. Synthetic, slot-ventilated handguards were produced, but proved to be too fragile for military use. These were replaced by a solid synthetic handguard that is still in use, usually colored in dark brown, black, or a camouflage pattern.

===Rifling===
Standard M14 rifling has a right-hand 1:12-inch twist with 4 grooves.

===Accessories===
Although M14 rifle production ended in 1964, the limited standard status of the weapon resulted in the continued manufacture of accessories and spare parts into the late 1960s and beyond.
* M6 bayonet with M8A1 sheath
* M2 Bandoleer (has six pockets, each containing two 5-round Mauser-type clips for a total of 60 rounds, and a pouch for a magazine filler. The sling was adjustable and was held in place with a matte-black steel safety pin). Standard operating procedure was for the operator to use up the ammunition in the bandoleers before using the loaded magazines in the ammo pouches. The seam stitching of each pocket could be ripped out to allow the bandoleer to carry six loaded 20-round magazines.
* Sling: The service rifle used a one-piece cotton or nylon webbing sling, and the competition and sniping variants use the standard M1907 two-piece leather sling.
* Cleaning kit, contained in the stock&#x27;s butt-trap, included a combination tool, ratchet chamber brush, plastic lubricant case, brass bore brush, four cleaning rod sections, cleaning rod case, and a cleaning rod patch-holding tip.
* M5 winter trigger and winter safety
* M12 blank firing attachment and M3 breech shield
* Cartridge charger clip (holds five cartridges)
* Magazine filler (or &quot;spoon&quot;) for charging detached magazines externally: The M14 has a groove over the action that allows the operator to place a loaded clip and top off the attached magazine internally through the open action.
* M1956 Universal Small Arms Ammunition Pouch, First Pattern could hold two 20-round M14 magazines horizontally.
* M1956 Universal Small Arms Ammunition Pouch, Second Pattern could hold three 20-round M14 magazines vertically.
* M1961 ammunition magazine pouch could carry one 20-round M14 magazine. The bottom of the pouch contained eyelets for attaching a first aid pouch or three-cell (six pockets) grenade carrier that could be tied down around the thigh.
* M2 bipod
* M76 rifle grenade launcher
* M15 grenade launcher sight
* Mk 87 Mod 0/1 line throwing kit

===Types of sights===
* Rear peep, front blade, metric
* Rear National Match peep with hood, front National Match blade, metric
* Front sights located on the muzzle

===Military===

====M15====
The M15 Squad Automatic Weapon was a modified M14 developed as a replacement for the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle for use as a squad automatic weapon. As with the M14, the M15 was chambered for 7.62×51mm NATO, a lighter cartridge than the BAR&#x27;s chambering of .30-06. It featured a heavier barrel and stock, two pistol grips (one fixed, one folding), a hinged butt plate, a selector switch for fully automatic fire, a bipod, and used the standard BAR sling.

Firing tests showed that the M14, when equipped with the selector switch, hinged butt plate and bipod, performed as well as the M15. As a result, the M15 was dropped and the modified M14 became the squad automatic weapon. Accuracy and control problems with this variant led to the addition of a pistol grip, a folding rubber-covered metal foregrip and a muzzle stabilizer. Despite these modifications, it remained a poor suppressive fire weapon owing to its 20-round magazines and a tendency to rapidly overheat.

====M14E1====
The M14E1 was tested with a variety of folding stocks to provide better maneuverability for armored infantry, paratroopers and others. No variant was standardized.

====M14E2/M14A1====
Selective fire version of the standard M14 used as a squad automatic weapon. Successor to the full-automatic M14 with a bipod and the never-issued M15. The developmental model was known as the M14E2. The model concept was developed by the United States Army Infantry School. The variant was known as the M14 (USAIB), after the initialism for &quot;United States Army Infantry Board&quot;. The variant was issued in 1963 and redesignated as M14A1 in 1966.

It had a full pistol-gripped in-line stock to control recoil, a plastic upper forend to save weight, a muzzle compensator, the BAR sling, an M2 bipod, a folding metal vertical foregrip mounted under the forend of the stock, and a rubber recoil shoulder pad under the hinged butt plate. Although an improvement over the M14 when in full-auto, it was still difficult to control, overheated rapidly, and the 20-round magazine limited its ability to deliver suppressive fire.

====M14M (Modified)/M14NM (National Match)====
The M14M is a semi-automatic only version of the standard M14 that was developed for use in civilian rifle marksmanship activities such as the Civilian Marksmanship Program. M14M rifles were converted from existing M14 rifles by welding the select-fire mechanism to prevent full-automatic firing. The M14NM (National Match) is an M14M rifle built to National Match accuracy standards.

The M14M and M14NM rifles are described in a now-obsolete Army regulation, AR 920–25, &quot;Rifles, M14M and M14NM, For Civilian Marksmanship Use&quot;, 8 February 1965. Paragraph 2 stated that the Director of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division, Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury (predecessor to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives) had ruled that M14M and M14NM rifles so modified would not be subject to the 1934 National Firearms Act (NFA) and, as such, could be sold or issued to civilians. Three years later, with the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968, the NFA was amended to prohibit the sale of previously modified automatic weapons such as the M14M and M14NM to civilians.

====M14 SMUD====
&quot;Stand-off Munition Disruption&quot;, used by Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel to destroy unexploded ordnance. Essentially an M14 National Match rifle with a scope.

====Mk 14 EBR====

The Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle is a more tactical version of the M14, with a shorter 18-inch barrel, a retractable stock and multiple rails for more accessories.

====M14 Tactical====
Modified M14 using the same stock as the Mk 14 but with a 22-inch barrel and a Smith Enterprise muzzle brake, used by the United States Coast Guard.

====M14 Designated Marksman Rifle====

Designated marksman rifle (DMR) version of the M14, used by the United States Marine Corps; replaced by the M39 Enhanced Marksman Rifle.

====M39 Enhanced Marksman Rifle====

Modified M14 DMR fitted with the same stock as Mk 14, used by the United States Marine Corps; being replaced by the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System.

====M89SR Model 89 Sniper Rifle====

The M89SR is an M14 in bullpup configuration first introduced by Sardius in the 1980s. Later produced by Technical Equipment International (TEI) for the Israel Defense Forces.

====AWC G2A Sniper Rifle====
The AWC G2A is a modified M14 with bullpup stock designed by Lynn McWilliams and Gale McMillian in the late 1990s. Produced and delivered for testing at the Fort Bragg sniper school. They consist of the G2, G2A and G2FA models.

====M21 and M25 sniper rifles====
The M21 and M25 are accurized sniper models of the M14, assembled with more care and precision than is standard.

====GA SOCOM-16 M14 Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR) ====
Refurbished and upgraded M14 rifle by Government Arsenal GA SOCOM-16 model, very similar to the Springfield Armory M1A SOCOM 16 rifle. Uses a 16&quot; barrel specified for Special Operations Command units&#x27; requirement, as compared to standard M14 which uses the original 22&quot; barrel, and EBR which uses an 18&quot; barrel.

===Commercial production===

====Federal Ordnance====
From 1984 to 1991, Federal Ordnance of South El Monte, California, sold a semi-automatic version of the M14 rifle. Initially named the &quot;M14&quot; or &quot;M14A&quot;, the rifle used an aftermarket semi-automatic receiver fitted with surplus USGI M14 parts. All receivers were machined from castings of AISI 8620 alloy steel. Except for the first 50 receivers, the castings were supplied by Electro Crisol Metal, S.A., of Santander, Spain, then imported to the US for heat treatment, finish machining, and exterior phosphate treatment. M14 and M14A receivers were heat-treated using the carburizing process by a firm in Santa Ana, California, followed by finish machining on a CNC machine at Federal Ordnance in South El Monte.

Federal Ordnance M14 and M14A receivers were heat-treated and carburized according to USGI M14 requirements. Each completed production rifle was proof fired, then tested for functioning by firing three rounds. USGI parts and bolts were used extensively in Federal Ordnance rifles through at least serial number 88XX. In 1989, Federal Ordnance renamed the rifle the &quot;M14SA&quot; and &quot;M14CSA&quot;. Rifles in the 93XX serial range and higher have modified receivers designed to accept Chinese-made bolts, barrels, and other parts owing to a shortage of original USGI components. About 51,000 complete Federal Ordnance M14 rifles and 60,000 or more receivers were manufactured before production was halted in late 1991.

====Norinco====
Norinco manufactures versions of the M14 rifle known as the M14S (Sporter) and the M305. Chinese copies of the select-fire and semi-automatic versions of the M14 were also made by Norinco, supposedly from M14s captured in the Vietnam War from American/allied troops.

The two versions of the M305 are M305A/B, one with the same barrel as the regular M14 and one with a short barrel. The M305A is an M14 chambered to fire 7.62x39 ammo. and the M305B is an M14 with an 18.5-inch barrel and chambered to fire in 7.62 NATO caliber.

These rifles were banned from U.S. importation in 1994 due to a ban under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. They were commonly sold and were popular in Canada for hunting and target shooting until they were reclassified as prohibited firearms on May 1, 2020.

Production of these M14s were contracted out to Yunnan Xiyi Industry Company Limited or State Arsenal 356 from the rifles to the 7.62 mm NATO magazines.

====Poly Technologies (&quot;Polytech&quot;)====
Poly Technologies also produced an unlicensed version of the M14 rifle known as the M14/S. They were made in semi-auto mode only. As with the Norinco rifles, manufacture was subcontracted to State Arsenal 356.

All Polytech rifles were banned in the 1989 firearm importation ban by the President George H.W. Bush administration.

====Smith Enterprise, Inc.====

Smith Enterprise Inc. was founded as Western Ordnance in 1979 by Richard Smith in Mesa, Arizona, and the company made numerous types of rifles, but specialized in the M1 Garand and M14. In 1993, Western Ordnance reformed as Smith Enterprise and has built and rebuilt numerous M14 rifles for the US military and the militaries of Colombia, Canada, and other nations.

The U.S. Department of Defense contracted with Smith Enterprise to build and modify M14 rifles for use by soldiers, marines, and sailors in Iraq and Afghanistan. Smith Enterprise played a major part in the M14 rifle modernization projects for various US military units, which resulted in the development of the U.S. Navy Mark 14 enhanced battle rifle (EBR). The company&#x27;s history included originally making forged receivers for M14 rifles and briefly switching to investment casting. Smith stopped making receivers for a few years, but re-entered the market with receivers machined from bar stock in 2002.

In 2003, Smith Enterprise Inc. created its version of the M14 EBR known as the Mk14 Mod 0, type SEI. The rifle used a medium heavy-weight 18-inch barrel and was used as a basis to create the US Navy&#x27;s Mark 14 Mod 0, with Springfield Armory, Inc. being asked to supply the necessary machinery in cooperation with the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division. SEI builds an improved M14 gas cylinder as a component of their specialized rifles and for the military to upgrade older rifles. The gas cylinder is assigned the NATO stock number: NSN 1005-00-790-8766.

====Springfield Armory, Inc.====
Springfield Armory, Inc. of Geneseo, Illinois, produces a semi-automatic only version of the M14 known as the M1A. The company produces several variations of the basic rifle with different stocks, barrel weights, barrel lengths, and other optional features. The Springfield M1A and its model variants have been widely distributed in the U.S. civilian market and have seen use by various law-enforcement agencies in the U.S.

Springfield Armory, Inc. also produces the SOCOM series and the Scout Squad Rifle, based on the short-barreled version of the M14. The SOCOM 16 comes with provisions to mount a red dot sight and the SOCOM II adds railed handguards to the package.

<text>Messier 14 (also known as M14 or NGC 6402) is a globular cluster of stars in the constellation Ophiuchus. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764.

At a distance of about 30,000 light-years, M14 contains several hundred thousand stars. At an apparent magnitude of +7.6 it can be easily observed with binoculars. Medium-sized telescopes will show some hint of the individual stars of which the brightest is of magnitude +14.

The total luminosity of M14 is in the order of 400,000 times that of the Sun corresponding to an absolute magnitude of -9.12. The shape of the cluster is decidedly elongated. M14 is about 100 light-years across.

A total of 70 variable stars are known in M14, many of the W Virginis variety common in globular clusters. In 1938, a nova appeared, although this was not discovered until photographic plates from that time were studied in 1964. It is estimated that the nova reached a maximum brightness of magnitude +9.2, over five times brighter than the brightest &#x27;normal&#x27; star in the cluster.

Slightly over 3° southwest of M14 lies the faint globular cluster NGC 6366.

<text>The M107 is a 155 mm high explosive projectile used by many countries. It is a bursting round with fragmentation and blast effects. It used to be the standard 155 mm high explosive projectile for howitzers of the US Army and US Marine Corps, but is being superseded in the US military by the M795.

==Development==
The M107 is a development of the M102 155 mm shell that was developed in the 1930s from the French Schneider 155 mm projectile for the Model 1917 Howitzer. 

==Description==

The body consists of a hollow steel shell containing high explosive (either TNT or Composition B) painted olive drab with yellow markings. A fuze adapter is screwed into the body and brazed in place. An eyebolt lifting plug is screwed into the fuze well to assist in transportation. The plug is removed and replaced with a fuze for firing. The complete projectile weighs , is long and contains 15.8% explosive by weight. It is a separate-loading projectile—propellant bags or modular artillery charge system (MACS) charges are loaded separately.

The M107 can be fired more than and on detonation it produces approximately 1,950 fragments. 

The M107 was approved for use in 1958 and issued to the army from 1959. Its intended replacement is the M795, manufacture of which began in 1999.

The M198 howitzer can fire an M107 up to using M4A2 &quot;White Bag&quot; propellant. Modified M107 rounds with base bleed and new aerodynamics can extend this range to around .

Despite relatively lackluster performance (Jane&#x27;s describes it as having &quot;an indifferent charge to weight ratio&quot;, &quot;unsophisticated aerodynamic shape&quot;, &quot;erratic fragmentation&quot;) compared to more modern high explosive rounds, it continues to be used by many countries, in particular in training exercises because of its low cost, high availability and smaller danger area than more modern designs. Its limited effectiveness also make it a useful option in peace support operations.

The M107 is manufactured by several nations, sometimes with variations in the fill and or filling method, or other details, and is given a national designation. For example, those produced to UK requirements are designated L21, not M107; German examples were designated DM21.

By the 1970s, the M107 was an out-of-date design, and some European armies started replacing their war stocks with modern designs such as L15. However, the M107 was retained for training purposes, because it was cheap and, being less lethal, had a smaller peacetime safety area, an important consideration given the small European training areas.

<doc id="319558" wikidata="Q697196" url="?curid=319558" title="Ocean liner">
<text>An ocean liner is a type of passenger ship primarily used for transportation across seas or oceans. Ocean liners may also carry cargo or mail, and may sometimes be used for other purposes (such as for pleasure cruises or as hospital ships). The &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot; is the only ocean liner still in service to this day, serving with Cunard Line.

The category does not include ferries or other vessels engaged in short-sea trading, nor dedicated cruise ships where the voyage itself, and not transportation, is the primary purpose of the trip. Nor does it include tramp steamers, even those equipped to handle limited numbers of passengers. Some shipping companies refer to themselves as &quot;lines&quot; and their passenger ships, which often operate over set routes according to established schedules, as &quot;liners&quot;.

Though ocean liners share certain similarities with cruise ships, they must be able to travel between continents from point A to point B on a fixed schedule, so must be faster and built to withstand the rough seas and adverse conditions encountered on long voyages across the open ocean. To protect against large waves they usually have a higher hull and promenade deck with higher positioning of lifeboats (the height above water called the freeboard), as well as a longer bow than a cruise ship. Additionally, for additional strength they are often designed with thicker hull plating than is found on cruise ships, as well as a deeper draft for greater stability, and have large capacities for fuel, food, and other consumables on long voyages. On an ocean liner, the captain&#x27;s tower (bridge) is usually positioned on the upper deck for increased visibility.

The first ocean liners were built in the mid-19th century. Technological innovations such as the steam engine, diesel engine and steel hull allowed larger and faster liners to be built, giving rise to a competition between world powers of the time, especially between the United Kingdom, the German Empire, and to a lesser extent France. Once the dominant form of travel between continents, ocean liners were rendered largely obsolete by the emergence of long-distance aircraft after World War II. Advances in automobile and railway technology also played a role. After was retired in 2008, the only ship still in service as an ocean liner is , introduced in 2004, as well as the largest ever built.

==Overview==
Ocean liners were the primary mode of intercontinental travel for over a century, from the mid-19th century until they began to be supplanted by airliners in the 1950s. In addition to passengers, liners carried mail and cargo. Ships contracted to carry British Royal Mail used the designation RMS. Liners were also the preferred way to move gold and other high-value cargoes.
The busiest route for liners was on the North Atlantic with ships travelling between Europe and North America. It was on this route that the fastest, largest and most advanced liners travelled, though most ocean liners historically were mid-sized vessels which served as the common carriers of passengers and freight between nations and among other countries and their colonies and dependencies before the dawn of the jet age. Such routes included Europe to African and Asian colonies, Europe to South America, and migrant traffic from Europe to North America in the 19th and first two decades of the 20th centuries, and to Canada and Australia after the Second World War.

Shipping lines are companies engaged in shipping passengers and cargo, often on established routes and schedules. Regular scheduled voyages on a set route are called &quot;line voyages&quot; and vessels (passenger or cargo) trading on these routes to a timetable are called liners. The alternative to liner trade is &quot;tramping&quot; whereby vessels are notified on an ad hoc basis as to the availability of a cargo to be transported. (In older usage, &quot;liner&quot; also referred to ships of the line, that is, line-of-battle ships, but that usage is now rare.) The term &quot;ocean liner&quot; has come to be used interchangeably with &quot;passenger liner&quot;, although it can refer to a cargo liner or cargo-passenger liner.

The advent of the Jet Age and the decline in transoceanic ship service brought about a gradual transition from passenger ships to modern cruise ships as a means of transportation. In order for ocean liners to remain profitable, cruise lines modified some of them to operate on cruise routes, such as the . Certain characteristics of older ocean liners made them unsuitable for cruising, such as high fuel consumption, deep draught preventing them from entering shallow ports, and cabins (often windowless) designed to maximize passenger numbers rather than comfort. The Italian Line&#x27;s and , the last ocean liners to be built primarily for crossing the North Atlantic, could not be converted economically and had short careers.
==History==
===19th century===
At the beginning of the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution and the inter-continental trade made the development of secure links between continents imperative. Being at the top among the colonial powers, the United Kingdom needed stable maritime routes to connect different parts of its empire: the Far East, India, Australia, etc. The birth of the concept of international water and the lack of any claim to it simplified navigation during this period. In 1818, the Black Ball Line, with a fleet of sailing ships, offered the first regular passenger service with emphasis on passenger comfort, from England to the United States.

In 1807, Robert Fulton succeeded in applying steam engines to ships. He built the first ship that was powered by this technology, the &quot;Clermont&quot;, which succeeded in travelling between New York City and Albany, New York in thirty hours before entering into regular service between the two cities. Soon after, other ships were built using this innovation. In 1816, the became the first steamship to cross the English Channel. Another important advance came in 1819, when became the first steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean. She left the U.S. city of the same name and arrived in Liverpool, England in 27 days. Most of the distance was covered by sailing; the steam power was not used for more than 72 hours during the travel. Public enthusiasm for the new technology was not high, as none of the thirty-two people who had booked a seat boarded the ship for that historic voyage. Although &quot;Savannah&quot; had proven that a steamship was capable of crossing the ocean, the public was not yet prepared to trust such means of travel on an open sea, and, in 1820, the steam engine was removed from the ship.

Work on this technology continued and a new step was taken in 1833. &quot;Royal William&quot; managed to cross the Atlantic by using steam power on most of the voyage; sail was used only when the boilers were cleaned. However, there were still many skeptics, and in 1836, scientific writer Dionysius Lardner declared that: As the project of making the voyage directly from New York to Liverpool, it was perfectly chimerical, and they might as well talk of making the voyage from New York to the moon.
The last step toward long-distance travel using steam power was taken in 1837 when left Liverpool on 4 April and arrived in New York eighteen days later on 22 April after a turbulent crossing. Too little coal was prepared for the crossing, and the crew had to burn cabin furniture in order to complete the voyage. The journey took place at a speed of 8.03 knots. The voyage was made possible by the use of a condenser, which fed the boilers with fresh water and avoiding having to periodically shut down the boilers in order to remove the salt. This new record was short-lived. The next day, , designed by railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, arrived in New York. She left Liverpool on 8 April and overtook &quot;Sirius&quot;″s record with an average speed of 8.66 knots. A race for speed was born, and, with it, the tradition of the Blue Riband.

With &quot;Great Western&quot;, Isambard Kingdom Brunel laid the foundations for new shipbuilding techniques. He realised that the carrying capacity of a ship increases as the cube of its dimensions, whilst the water resistance only increases as the square of its dimensions. This means that large ships are more fuel-efficient, something very important for long voyages across the Atlantic. Constructing large ships was therefore more profitable. Moreover, migration to the Americas increased enormously. These movements of population were a financial windfall for the shipping companies, of which some of the largest were founded during this period. Examples are the P&amp;O of the United Kingdom in 1822 and the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique of France in 1855.

The steam engine also allowed ships to provide regular service without the use of sail. This aspect particularly appealed to the postal companies, which leased the services of ships to serve clients separated by the ocean. In 1839, Samuel Cunard founded the Cunard Line and became the first to dedicate the activity of his shipping company to the transport of mails, thus ensuring regular services on a given schedule. The company&#x27;s ships operated the routes between the United Kingdom and the United States. Over time, the paddle wheel, impractical on the high seas, was abandoned in favour of the propeller. In 1840, Cunard Line&#x27;s began its first regular passenger and cargo service by a steamship, sailing from Liverpool to Boston, Massachusetts.
As the size of ships increased, the wooden hull became unreliable. The start of the use of iron hulls in 1845, and then of steel hulls, solved this problem. The first ship to be both iron-hulled and equipped with a screw propeller was , a creation of Brunel. Her career was disastrous and short. She was run aground and stranded at Dundrum Bay in 1846. In 1884, she was retired to the Falkland Islands where she was used as a warehouse, quarantine ship, and coal hulk until she was scuttled in 1937. The American company Collins Line took a different approach. It equipped its ships with cold rooms, heating systems, and various other innovations but the operation was expensive. The sinking of two of its ships was a major blow to the company which was dissolved in 1858.

In 1858, Brunel built his third and last giant, . The ship was, for 43 years, the largest passenger ship ever built. She had the capacity to carry 4,000 passengers. Her career was marked by a series of failures and incidents, one of which was an explosion on board during her maiden voyage.

Many ships owned by German companies such as Hamburg America Line and Norddeutscher Lloyd were sailing from major German ports, such as Hamburg and Bremen, to the United States during this time. The year 1858 was marked by a major accident: the sinking of . The ship, built in Greenock and sailing between Hamburg and New York twice a month, suffered an accidental fire off the coast of Newfoundland and sank with the loss of all but 89 of the 542 passengers.

In the British market, Cunard Line and White Star Line competed strongly against each other in the late 1860s. The struggle was symbolised by the attainment of the Blue Riband, which the two companies achieved several times around the end of the century. The luxury and technology of ships were also evolving. Auxiliary sails became obsolete and disappeared completely at the end of the century. Possible military use of passenger ships was envisaged and, in 1889, became the first auxiliary cruiser in history. In the time of war, ships could easily be equipped with cannons and used in cases of conflict. &quot;Teutonic&quot; succeeded in impressing Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, who wanted to see his country endowed with a modern fleet.

In 1870, the White Star Line&#x27;s set a new standard for ocean travel by having its first-class cabins amidships, with the added amenity of large portholes, electricity and running water. The size of ocean liners increased from 1880 onward to meet the needs of migration to the United States and Australia.

 and her sister ship were the last two Cunard liners of the period to be fitted with auxiliary sails. Both ships were built by John Elder &amp; Co. of Glasgow, Scotland, in 1884. They were record breakers by the standards of the time, and were the largest liners then in service, serving the Liverpool to New York route.

 was a 6,814-ton steamship owned by the Orient Steamship Co., and was fitted with refrigeration equipment. She served the Suez Canal route from England to Australia during the 1890s, up until the years leading to World War I when she was converted to an armed merchant cruiser.

In 1897, Norddeutscher Lloyd launched . She was followed three years later by three sister ships. The ship was both luxurious and fast, managing to win the Blue Riband from the British. She was also the first of the fourteen ocean liners with four funnels that have emerged in maritime history. The ship needed only two funnels, but more funnels gave passengers a feeling of safety. In 1900, the Hamburg America Line competed with its own four-funnel liner, . She quickly obtained the Blue Riband for her company. This race for speed, however, was a detriment to passengers&#x27; comfort and generated strong vibration, which made her owner lose any interest in her after she lost the Blue Riband to another ship of Norddeutscher Lloyd. She was only used for ten years for transatlantic crossing before being converted into a cruise ship. Until 1907, the Blue Riband remained in the hands of the Germans.

===Early 20th century===

In 1902, J. P. Morgan embraced the idea of a maritime empire comprising a large number of companies. He founded the International Mercantile Marine Co., a trust which originally comprised only American shipping companies. The trust then absorbed Leyland Line and White Star Line. The British government then decided to intervene in order to regain its ascendancy.

Although German liners dominated in terms of speed, British liners dominated in terms of size. and the Big Four of the White Star Line were the first liners to surpass &quot;Great Eastern&quot; as the largest passenger ships. Ultimately their owner was American (as mentioned above, White Star Line had been absorbed into J. P. Morgan&#x27;s trust). Faced with this major competition, the British government contributed financially to Cunard Line&#x27;s construction of two liners of unmatched size and speed, under the condition that they be available for conversion into armed cruisers when needed by the navy. The result of this partnership was the completion in 1907 of two sister ships: and , both of which won the Blue Riband during their respective maiden voyages. The latter retained it for twenty years. Their great speed was achieved by the use of turbines instead of conventional expansion machines.
In response to the competition from Cunard Line, White Star Line ordered the liners at the end of 1907. The first of these three liners, , completed in 1911, had a fine career, although punctuated by incidents. This was not the case for her sister, the , which sank on her maiden voyage on 15 April 1912, resulting in several major changes to maritime safety practices. As for the third sister, , she never served her intended purpose as a passenger ship, as she was drafted in the First World War as a hospital ship, and sank to a naval mine in 1916.

At the same time, France tried to mark its presence with the completion in 1912 of owned by the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique. Germany soon responded to the competition from the British. From 1912 to 1914, Hamburg America Line completed a trio of liners significantly larger than the White Star Line&#x27;s &quot;Olympic&quot;-class ships. The first to be completed, in 1913, was . She was followed by SS &quot;Vaterland&quot; in 1914. The construction of the third liner, , was paused by the outbreak of World War I.

World War I was a difficult time for the liners. Some of them, like the &quot;Mauretania&quot;, , and &quot;Britannic&quot; were transformed into hospital ships during the conflict. Others became troop transports, while some, such as the &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot;, participated in the war as warships. Troop transportation was very popular due to the liners&#x27; large size. Liners converted into troop ships were painted in dazzle camouflage to reduce the risk of being torpedoed by enemy submarines.

The war caused the loss of many liners. &quot;Britannic&quot;, while serving as a hospital ship, sank in the Aegean Sea in 1916 after she struck a mine. Numerous incidents of torpedoing took place and large numbers of ships sank. &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot; was defeated and scuttled after a fierce battle with off the coast of west Africa, while her sister ship served as a commerce raider. The torpedoing and sinking of &quot;Lusitania&quot; on 7 May 1915 caused the loss of 128 American lives at a time when the United States was still neutral. Although other factors came into play, the loss of American lives in the sinking strongly pushed the United States to favour the Allied Powers and facilitated the country&#x27;s entry into the war.

The losses of the liners owned by the Allied Powers were compensated by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. This led to the awarding of many German liners to the victorious Allies. The Hamburg America Line&#x27;s trio (, &quot;Vaterland&quot;, and &quot;Bismarck&quot;) were divided between the Cunard Line, White Star Line, and the United States Lines, while the three surviving ships of the Kaiser class were requisitioned by the US Navy in the context of the conflict and then retained. The &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, whose construction was delayed by the outbreak of war, eventually became the . Of the German superliners, only &quot;Deutschland&quot;, because of her poor state, avoided this fate.

===After World War I===

After a period of reconstruction, the shipping companies recovered quickly from the damage caused by World War I. The ships whose construction was started before the war, such as of the French Line, were completed and put into service. Prominent British liners, such as the &quot;Olympic&quot; and the &quot;Mauretania&quot;, were also put back into service and had a successful career in the early 1920s. More modern liners were also built, such as (completed in 1927). The United States Lines, having received the &quot;Vaterland&quot;, renamed her &quot;Leviathan&quot; and made her the flagship of the company&#x27;s fleet. Because all U.S. registered ships counted as an extension of U.S. territory, the National Prohibition Act made American liners alcohol-free, causing alcohol-seeking passengers to choose ships of other countries for travel and substantially reduce profits for the United States Lines.

In 1929, Germany returned to the scene with the two ships of Norddeutscher Lloyd, and . &quot;Bremen&quot; won the Blue Riband from Britain&#x27;s &quot;Mauretania&quot; after the latter had held it for twenty years. Soon, Italy also entered the scene. The Italian Line completed and in 1932, breaking the records of both luxury and speed (&quot;Rex&quot; won the westbound Blue Riband in 1933). France reentered the scene with of the French Compagnie Générale Transatlantique (CGT). The ship was the largest ship afloat at the time of her completion in 1935. She was also the fastest, winning the Blue Riband in 1935.

A crisis arose when the United States drastically reduced its immigrant quotas, causing shipping companies to lose a large part of their income and to have to adapt to this circumstance. The Great Depression also played an important role, causing a drastic decrease in the number of people crossing the Atlantic and at the same time reducing the number of profitable transatlantic voyages. In response, shipping companies redirected many of their liners to a more profitable cruise service. In 1934, in the United Kingdom, Cunard Line and White Star Line were in very bad shape financially. Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain proposed to merge the two companies in order to solve their financial problems. The merger took place in 1934 and launched the construction of the while progressively sending their older ships to the scrapyard. The &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was the fastest ship of her time and the largest for a short amount of time, she captured the Blue Riband twice, both off &quot;Normandie&quot;. The construction of a second ship, the , was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II.

World War II was a conflict rich in events involving liners. From the start of the conflict, German liners were requisitioned and many were turned into barracks ships. It was in the course of this activity that the &quot;Bremen&quot; caught fire while under conversion for Operation Sea Lion and was scrapped in 1941. During the conflict, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and &quot;Queen Mary&quot; provided distinguished service as troopships.

Many liners were sunk with great loss of life; the three worst disasters were the loss of the Cunarder in 1940 off Saint-Nazaire to German bombing while attempting to evacuate troops of the British Expeditionary Force from France, with the loss of more than 3,000 lives; the sinking of , after the ship was torpedoed by a Soviet submarine, with more than 9,000 lives lost, making it the deadliest maritime disaster in history; and the sinking of with more than 7,000 lives lost, both in the Baltic Sea, in 1945.

SS &quot;Rex&quot; was bombarded and sunk in 1944, and &quot;Normandie&quot; caught fire, capsized, and sank in New York in 1942 while being converted into a troopship. Many of the superliners of the 1920s and 1930s were victims of U-boats, mines or enemy aircraft. was attacked by German planes, then torpedoed by a U-boat when tugs tried to tow her to safety. Out of all the innovative and glamorous inter-war superliners, only the Cunard &quot;Queens&quot; and &quot;Europa&quot; would survive the war.

===Decline of long-distance line voyages===
After the war, some ships were again transferred from the defeated nations to the winning nations as war reparations. This was the case of the &quot;Europa&quot;, which was ceded to France and renamed &quot;Liberté&quot;. The United States government was very impressed with the service of the Cunard&#x27;s &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; as troopships during the war. To ensure a reliable and fast troop transport in case of a war against the Soviet Union, the U.S. government sponsored the construction of and entered it into service for the United States Lines in 1952. She won the Blue Riband on her maiden voyage in that year and held it until Richard Branson won it in 1986 with &quot;Virgin Atlantic Challenger II&quot;. One year later, in 1953, Italy completed the , which later sank in 1956 after a collision with .

Before World War II, aircraft had not posed a significant economic threat to ocean liners. Most pre-war aircraft were noisy, vulnerable to bad weather, and/or incapable of the range needed for transoceanic flights; all were expensive and had a small passenger capacity. The war accelerated development of large, long-ranged aircraft. Four-engined bombers, such as the Avro Lancaster and Boeing B-29 Superfortress, with their range and massive carrying capacity, were natural prototypes for post-war next-generation airliners. Jet engine technology also accelerated due to wartime development of jet aircraft. In 1953, the De Havilland Comet became the first commercial jet airliner; the Sud Aviation Caravelle, Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 followed, and much long-distance travel was done by air. The Italian Line&#x27;s and , launched in 1962 and 1963, were two of the last ocean liners to be built primarily for liner service across the North Atlantic. Cunard&#x27;s transatlantic liner, , although designed as an ocean liner, was also used as a cruise ship. By the early 1960s, 95% of passenger traffic across the Atlantic was by aircraft. Thus the reign of the ocean liners came to an end. By the early 1970s, many passenger ships continued their service in cruising.

In 1982, during the Falklands War, three active or former liners were requisitioned for war service by the British Government. The liners &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; and , were requisitioned from Cunard and P&amp;O to serve as troopships, carrying British Army personnel to Ascension Island and the Falkland Islands to recover the Falklands from the invading Argentine forces. The P&amp;O educational cruise ship and former British India Steam Navigation Company liner was requisitioned as a hospital ship, and served after the war as a troopship until the RAF Mount Pleasant station was built at Stanley, which could handle trooping flights.

===21st century===

By the first decade of the 21st century, only a few former ocean liners were still in existence. Some, like , were sailing as cruise ships while others, like , were preserved as museums, or laid up at pier side like SS &quot;United States&quot;. After the retirement of &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; in 2008, the only ocean liner in service was &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;, built in 2003–04 and used for both point-to-point line voyages and for cruises.

A proposed and planned ocean liner, the Titanic II, is a modern replica of the original RMS Titanic, which sank in 1912. The ship is owned by Blue Star Line and is bought by Australian businessman Clive Palmer. The ship is set to be launched by 2027.

==Survivors==
Four ocean liners built before the World War II survive today as they have been partially or fully preserved as museums and hotels. The Japanese ocean liner (1929), has been preserved in Naka-ku, Yokohama, Japan, as a museum ship, since 1961. (1934) was preserved in 1967 after her retirement, and became a museum/hotel in Long Beach, California. In the 1970s, (1843) was also preserved, and now resides in Bristol, England as another museum. The latest ship to undergo preservation is (1914). While originally being a cargo ship, it served as the Italian ocean liner Franca C. for Costa Lines from 1952 to 1959, and in 2010 it became a dry berthed luxury hotel on Bintan Island, Indonesia.

Post-war ocean liners still existent include (1948), (1952), &quot;MV Brazil Maru&quot; (1954), (1958), (1961), (1962), &quot;MV Yaohua&quot; (1966), &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; (1967), and Queen Mary 2 (2003). Out of these nine ocean liners, only one is still active and three of them have since been preserved. The &quot;Rotterdam&quot; has been moored in Rotterdam as a museum and hotel since 2008, while the &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; has been a floating luxury hotel and museum at Mina Rashid, Dubai since 2018. The &quot;Ancerville&quot; was refurbished as a hotel for use at the Sea World development in Shenzhen, China in 1984. The first of these, &quot;Astoria&quot; (originally the ocean liner MS &quot;Stockholm,&quot; which collided with &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; in 1956) has been rebuilt and refitted as a cruise ship over the years and was in active service for Cruise &amp; Maritime Voyages until operations ceased in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In August, 2021 she was purchased by Brock Pierce to be transformed into a hotel along with . These plans were ultimately abandoned and the ship was again made available for sale, never having left port in Rotterdam. Astoria was reported to have been sold for scrap in January 2023, but this has been denied by the ship&#x27;s owner. &quot;United States&quot; has been docked in Philadelphia since 1996, but following a legal dispute between the organization that owns &quot;United States&quot; and the pier owners, she was purchased by Okaloosa County, Florida to be turned into the world&#x27;s largest artificial reef. There are plans for a land-based museum and several pieces of &quot;United States&quot; are planned to be preserved. &quot;Brazil Maru&quot; was beached in Zhanjiang, China as a tourist attraction called &quot;Hai Shang Cheng Shi&quot; in 1998, though has been closed as of 2022. &quot;Funchal&quot; was purchased by Brock Pierce in 2021, with the intent of turning her into a hotel. Her future is uncertain as it was reported in July 2021 that no progress has been made since then.


==Characteristics==
===Size and speed===

Since their beginning in the 19th century, ocean liners needed to meet growing demands. The first liners were small and overcrowded, leading to unsanitary conditions on board. Eliminating these phenomena required larger ships, to reduce the crowding of passengers, and faster ships, to reduce the duration of transatlantic crossings. The iron and steel hulls and steam power allowed for these to be achieved. Thus, &quot;SS Great Western&quot; (1,340 GRT) and &quot;SS Great Eastern&quot; (18,915 GRT) were constructed in 1838 and 1858 respectively. The record set by &quot;SS Great Eastern&quot; was not beaten until 43 years later in 1901 when (20,904 GT) was completed. The tonnage then grew profoundly: the first liners to have a tonnage that exceeded 20,000 were the Big Four of the White Star Line. The liners, first completed in 1911, were the first to have a tonnage that exceeded 45,000 and the liners first completed in 1913 became the 1st liners with tonnage exceeding 50,000. , completed in 1935, had a tonnage of 79,280. In 1940, raised the record of size to a tonnage of 83,673. She was the largest passenger ship ever constructed until 1997. In 2003, became the largest, at 149,215 GT.

In the early 1840s, the average speed of liners was less than 10 knots (a crossing of the Atlantic thus took about 12 days or more). In the 1870s, the average speed of liners increased to around 15 knots the duration of a transatlantic crossing shortened to around 7 days, owing to the technological progress made in the propulsion of ships. The rudimentary steam boilers gave rise to more elaborate machineries and the paddlewheel gradually disappeared, replaced first by one screw then by two screws. At the beginning of the 20th century, Cunard Line&#x27;s and reached a speed of 27 knots. Their records seemed unbeatable, and most shipping companies abandoned the race for speed in favor of size, luxury, and safety. The advent of ships with diesel engines, and of those whose engines were oil-burning, such as the &quot;Bremen&quot;, in the early 1930s, renewed the race for the Blue Riband. The won it in 1935 before being snatched by in 1938. It was not until 1952 that set a record that remains today: 34.5 knots (3 days and 12 hours of crossing the Atlantic). In addition, since 1935, the Blue Riband is accompanied by the Hales Trophy, which is awarded to the winner.

===Passenger cabins and amenities===
The first ocean liners were designed to carry mostly migrants. On-board sanitary conditions were often deplorable and epidemics were frequent. In 1848, maritime laws imposing hygiene rules were adopted and they improved on-board living conditions. Gradually, two distinct classes were developed: the cabin class and the steerage class. The passengers travelling on the former were wealthy passengers and they enjoyed certain comfort in that class. The passengers travelling on the latter were members of the middle class or the working class. In that class, they were packed in large dormitories. Until the beginning of the 20th century, they did not always have bedsheets and meals. An intermediate class for tourists and members of the middle class gradually appeared. The cabins were then divided into three classes. 
The facilities offered to passengers developed over time. In the 1870s, the installation of bathtubs and oil lamps caused a sensation on board . In the following years, the number of amenities became numerous, for example: smoking rooms, lounges, and promenade deck. In 1907, even offered Turkish baths and a swimming pool. In the 1920s, was the first liner to offer a movie theatre.

==Builders==
===British and German===

The British and the German shipyards were the most famed in shipbuilding during the era of ocean liners. In Ireland, Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard of Belfast were particularly innovative and succeeded in winning the trust of many shipping companies, such as White Star Line. These gigantic shipyards employed a large portion of the population of cities and built hulls, machines, furnitures and lifeboats. Among the other well-known British shipyards were Swan, Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson, the builder of , and John Brown &amp; Company, builders of , , , , and &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;.

Germany had many shipyards on the coast of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, including Blohm &amp; Voss and AG Vulcan Stettin. Many of these shipyards were destroyed during World War II; some managed to recover and continue building ships.

===Other nations===
In France, major shipyards included Chantiers de Penhoët in Saint-Nazaire, known for building . This shipyard merged with Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire shipyard to form the Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique shipyard, which has built ships including . France also had major shipyards on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.

Italy and the Netherlands also had shipyards capable of building large ships (for example, Fincantieri).

==Shipping companies==
===British===

There were many British shipping companies; two were particularly distinguished: Cunard Line and White Star Line. Both were founded during the 1840s and engaged in strong competition against one another, possessing the largest and fastest liners in the world in the early 20th century. It was not until 1934 that financial difficulty caused the two to merge, forming Cunard White Star Ltd. The P&amp;O also occupied a large part of the business.

The Royal Mail Steam Packet Company operated as a state-owned enterprise with its close relationship with the government. Over the course of its history, it took over many shipping companies, becoming one of the largest companies in the world before legal problems led to its liquidation in 1931. The Union Castle Line operated in Africa and the Indian Ocean with a fleet of considerable size.

===German, French and Dutch===

Two rival companies, Hamburg America Line (often referred to as &quot;HAPAG&quot;) and Norddeutscher Lloyd, competed in Germany. The First and Second World Wars dealt much damage to the two companies, both forced to cede their ships to the winning side in both wars. The two merged to form Hapag-Lloyd in 1970.

The ocean liner industry in France also consisted of two rival companies: the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique (commonly known as &quot;Transat&quot; or &quot;French Line&quot;) and Messageries Maritimes. The CGT operated on the North Atlantic route with well-known liners such as and , while the MM operated in French colonies in Asia and Africa. Decolonization in the second half of the 20th century led to a sharp decline in profit for the MM, and it merged with the CGT in 1975 to form the Compagnie Générale Maritime.

The Netherlands had three main companies. The Holland America Line operated mostly on the north Atlantic route and with well-known ships like the and . Unlike the French and German industry, the Holland America Line had no domestic rival in this trade and only had to compete with foreign lines. The other two Dutch lines were the &quot;Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland&quot; (SMN), otherwise known as the Netherland Line and the &quot;Koninklijke Rotterdamsche Lloyd&quot; (KRL); both offered regular service between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies, the Dutch colony in South East Asia now known as Indonesia, and had a long-lasting friendly rivalry.

===Other nations===

The United States Lines competed with European companies for the North Atlantic trade. In Italy, the Italian Line was founded in 1932 as a result of a merger of three companies. It was known for operating liners such as and . The Japanese established Nippon Yusen, also known as NYK Lines, which ran trans-Pacific liners such as the &quot;Hikawa Maru&quot; and the &quot;Asama Maru&quot;.

==Routes==
===North Atlantic===
The most important of all routes taken by ocean liners was the North Atlantic route. It accounted for a large part of the clientele, who traveled between ports of Liverpool, Southampton, Hamburg, Le Havre, Cherbourg, Cobh, and New York City. The profitability of this route came from migration to the United States. The need for speed influenced the construction of liners for this route, and the Blue Riband was awarded to the liner with the highest speed. The route was not without danger, as storm and icebergs are common in the North Atlantic. Many shipwrecks occurred on this route, among them that of , the details of which have been recounted in numerous books, films and documentaries. This route was the preferred route for major shipping companies and was the scene of fierce competition between them.

===South Atlantic===

The South Atlantic was the route frequented by liners bound for South America, Africa, and sometimes Oceania. The White Star Line had some of its ships, such as the , on the Liverpool-Cape Town-Sydney route. There was not the same level of competition in the South Atlantic as there was in the North Atlantic. There were fewer shipwrecks. The Hamburg Süd operated on this route; among its ships was the famed .

===Mediterranean===
The Mediterranean Sea was frequented by many ocean liners. Many companies benefited from migration from Italy and the Balkans to the United States. Cunard&#x27;s served on the Gibraltar-Genoa-Trieste route. Similarly, Italian liners crossed the Mediterranean Sea before entering the North Atlantic Ocean. The opening of the Suez Canal made the Mediterranean a possible route to Asia.

===Indian Ocean and the East Asia===
Colonization made Asia particularly attractive to shipping companies. Many government officials must travel there from time to time. As early as the 1840s, the P&amp;O organized trips to Calcutta via the Suez Isthmus, as the canal had not yet been built. The time it took to travel on this route to India, Southeast Asia, and Japan was long, with many stopovers. The Messageries Maritimes operated on this route, notably in the 1930s, with its motor ships. Similarly, the &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, put into service in 1949, was one of the flagships of its fleet. Decolonization caused the loss in the profitability of these ships.

===Pacific===
Ocean liners on the Pacific route brought large numbers of migrants from East Asia to the Americas, especially the United States, which continued despite successive laws restricting Asian immigration to the United States; the journey typically took three weeks, with many impoverished migrants travelling in steerage class conditions. Some of the finest ships on the route, such as of Canadian Pacific Steamships which operated out of Vancouver, and &quot;Hikawa Maru&quot; of Nippon Yusen, became known as &#x27;Queen of the Pacific&#x27;.

==Other==
===National symbol===
The construction of some ocean liners was a result of nationalism. The revival of power of the German navy stemmed from the clear affirmation of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany to see his country become a sea power. Thus, the of 1900 had the honor to bear the name of its mother country, an honor which she lost after ten years of a disappointing career. and of 1907 were built with the help of the British government with the desire that the United Kingdom would regain its prestige as a sea power. of 1952 was the result of a desire by the United States government to possess a large and fast ship that is convertible into a troop transport. and of 1932 were constructed at the demands of Benito Mussolini. Finally, the construction of 1961 was a result of Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s desire to build on French national pride and was financed by the French government.

Some liners did gain great popularity. &quot;Mauretania&quot; and had many admirers during their careers, and their retirement and scrapping caused some sadness. The same was true of &quot;Île de France&quot;, whose scrapping aroused strong emotion from her admirers. Similarly, was very popular with the British people.

===Maritime disasters and incidents===

Some ocean liners are known today because of their sinking with great loss of lives. In 1873 struck an underwater rock and sank off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, killing at least 535 people. In 1912 the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, which took approximately 1,500 lives, highlighted the overconfidence of the shipping companies in their ships, such as the failure to put enough lifeboats on board. Safety measures at sea were reexamined following the incident. Two years later, in 1914, sank in the Saint Lawrence River after colliding with the . 1,012 people died.

Among the other sinkings are the sinking by torpedo of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; in 1915, which resulted in the loss of 1,198 lives and provoked an international outcry, the sinking by naval mine of in 1916, and that of , which caught fire and sank in the Gulf of Aden in 1932, killing 54 people. In 1956 the sinking of , with the loss of 46 lives, after a collision with made the headline.

In 1985, was hijacked off the coast of Egypt by members of the Palestinian Liberation Front, resulting in the death of one of the hostages being held by the hijackers. In 1994, she caught fire and sank off the coast of Somalia.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
Ocean liners have a strong impact on popular culture, whether during their era or afterwards. In 1867, Jules Verne recounted his experience aboard in his novel &quot;A Floating City&quot;. In 1898, writer Morgan Robertson wrote the short novel &quot;Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan&quot;, which features a British ocean liner &quot;Titan&quot; that hits an iceberg and sinks in the North Atlantic with great loss of lives. The similarities between the plot of the novel and the sinking of the 14 years later led to the assertion of conspiracy theories regarding &quot;Titanic&quot;.

===Films===
Ocean liners were often a setting of a love story in films, such as the 1939&#x27;s &quot;Love Affair&quot; Liners were also used as a setting of disaster films. The 1960 film &quot;The Last Voyage&quot; was filmed on board the &quot;Île de France&quot;, which was used as a floating prop and was scuttled for the occasion. The 1972 film &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; has become a classic of the genre and has spawned many remakes.

The sinking of &quot;Titanic&quot; also attracted attention of filmmakers. Nearly fifteen films were made to depict it, with James Cameron&#x27;s 1997 film being the most well-known and commercially successful.
