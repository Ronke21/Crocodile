<text>Golf instruction is the art of equipping and training golfers to play better golf through improved awareness of swing cause and effects as a result of the actions by their body, the club, and their effect on the golf ball. Most great golfers have a few common elements that make them great including: proper intentionality, swing repeatability to produce an action that fits the golfers intentionality, and a strong level of automaticity for long lasting enjoyment of the game golf. 

==Required skills==
Golf instruction consists of five primary skills: shots from a tee (most notable: driving that uses a driver), full shots from the ground (mostly known as &quot;iron shots&quot;, pitching (or 3/4 shots designed for distance control, chipping (short shots around the green the require less than a full swing), putting (1 club preferably &quot;the putter&quot;) and course strategy or gamesmanship.
Proficiency in teaching golf instruction requires not only technical and physical ability, but also knowledge of the rules and etiquette of the game. Golf instruction offered on many platforms in the United States including: the PGA of America, GolfTEC, and independent golfers who &quot;may&quot; or &quot;may not&quot; have credentials that are recognized by credible teachers certified sources such as the PGA of America. Although there are many great golf instructors in the United States who are PGA Class A Professionals, not all great instructors carry this status nor find it a major determiner of golf instruction proficiency.
==Forms of instruction==
Golf instruction can be wide ranging, but many great modern day instructors are able to diagnose and prescribe swing frustrations accurately and present a clear fix that encourages the golfer in the discovery of lasting repeatability from the specific ailment that &quot;plagued&quot; them from a sound repeatable swing to play a golf course successfully. Many modern instructors include the following in their diagnosis:
# Visual feedback through video and bio motion analysis 
# Personalized golf club fitting for individual body and swing types
# On-course play under real conditions
# Mental performance development
# Golf specific body conditioning for optimal golf bio-mechanics

Beginning players can start lesson in several ways, but most do so in either a group or individual setting, covering the five primary skills of golf as noted above golf swing. Golf is an asymmetrical exercise that can break body balances, requiring also adequate exercises to keep the balance in muscles. Experienced recreational players often return for instruction, either to fix a specific problem they are encountering or to improve their game. Reconstruction of a golf swing to reach a high level of play often involves series of lessons over an extended period of time. Junior golfers often begin receiving instruction by age 10 or younger, and often retain private teachers even when coached on a high school golf team.
==Notable instructors==
Some top instructors who work with professional golfers have become quite well known in their own right over the years, including Harvey Penick, Jack Grout, Dick Harmon, David Leadbetter, Butch Harmon, Gary Wiren, Hank Haney, Chip Thomson, Sean Foley, Quentin Patterson and Mike Bennett and Andy Plummer. Some of the teachers maintain teaching facilities or schools where they or their disciples use their methods or systems. A few instructors focus solely on a particular aspect of the sport, such as Dave Pelz with the short game. Some famous golfers have been tightly bound with their instructor, such as Jack Nicklaus with Jack Grout, while in other cases golfers have made high-profile switches from one instructor to another, such as Tiger Woods moving from Butch Harmon to various other instructors.

Golf instruction may be augmented by training aids such as specially weighting or jointed clubs, putting cups for practice on the den room carpet, mini practice tees with feedback for use in garages, &quot;et cetera&quot;. Some training aids are sold via television infomercials and the more peculiar varieties were satirized in the 1996 film &quot;Tin Cup&quot;.

==Publications and media==
Recreational golfers are constantly seeking tips on how to improve, and the major golf publications such as &quot;Golf Magazine&quot; and &quot;Golf Digest&quot; devote substantial portions of their pages to instructional material of various kinds, often written by top-level instructors. Even television broadcasts of professional golf tournaments often contain short instructional segments, delivered by commentators who are also instructors such as Peter Kostis.

==Effectiveness==
Golf instruction is no guarantee of success or improved play in the game. Bad mechanics can be deeply ingrained in a subject&#x27;s swing, and psychological factors can also hinder progress. The 2009 Golf Channel program &quot;The Haney Project: Charles Barkley&quot; showcased some of these issues, as Hank Haney attempted to fix former NBA great Charles Barkley&#x27;s infamously bad swing.

<doc id="318396" wikidata="Q318636" url="?curid=318396" title="Neville Marriner">
<text>Sir Neville Marriner, (15 April 1924 – 2 October 2016) was an English conductor and violinist. Described as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s greatest conductors&quot;, Gramophone lists Marriner as one of the 50 greatest conductors and another compilation ranks Marriner #14 of the 18 &quot;Greatest and Most Famous Conductors of All Time&quot;. He founded the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, and his partnership with them is the most recorded of any orchestra and conductor.

==Early life==
Marriner was born in Lincoln, England, the son of Herbert Marriner, a carpenter, and his wife Ethel (née Roberts). He was educated at Lincoln School (then a grammar school), where he played in a jazz band with the composer Steve Race. He initially learned the violin as well as the piano from his father, and later studied the violin with Frederick Mountney.

In 1939 he went to the Royal College of Music in London, where he studied with the violinist William Henry Reed and was able to play among the second violins of the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Henry Wood, because many of its members had joined up after the outbreak of the Second World War. He joined up himself in 1941, serving in a reconnaissance role in the British Army, but was invalided out in 1943 with kidney problems. He returned to the Royal College, although Reed had died in the meantime. He then attended the Paris Conservatoire, where he studied with the violinist René Benedetti.

==Career==
Marriner was briefly a music teacher at Eton College. In 1948, he became a professor of the Royal College of Music. In 1948 or 1949, he took up the position of second violinist of the Martin String Quartet, continuing to play with the quartet for 13 years. He had met the harpsichordist Thurston Dart while recuperating from kidney damage during the war, and they formed a duo together, which expanded to the Virtuoso String Trio with Peter Gibbs. These were the precursors to Dart&#x27;s Jacobean Ensemble, in which Marriner played from 1951. He played the violin in two London orchestras: the Philharmonia Orchestra in the early 1950s, and the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), i.a. under Josef Krips, as principal second violin (1954–69). He also played with the chamber orchestras of Reginald Jacques and Boyd Neel, as well as the London Mozart Players.

In 1958 he founded the Academy of St Martin in the Fields; initially a twelve-member chamber ensemble, it soon expanded to a chamber orchestra, and attracted musicians of a high calibre including Dart, Iona Brown, Christopher Hogwood and Alan Loveday. Marriner recorded prolifically with the Academy. The first recordings in the early 1960s, with Marriner both conducting and playing lead violin, were successful, leading Pierre Monteux, then the LSO&#x27;s conductor, to encourage Marriner to shift his focus to conducting. Marriner had studied the subject with Monteux at his school in Hancock, Maine, in the United States, from around 1950.

Marriner was the founder and first music director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, from 1969 to 1978. From 1979 to 1986, he was music director of the Minnesota Orchestra. He was principal conductor of the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1986 to 1989. Except for 1974 to 1980 during which Iona Brown was the director, he remained the musical director of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields until 2011, when he was succeeded by Joshua Bell, continuing to hold the title of Life President until his death. He also conducted many other orchestras, including the New York Chamber Orchestra, Gulbenkian Orchestra, Israel Chamber Orchestra, Australian Chamber Orchestra and Vienna Philharmonic. He continued to conduct into his nineties, becoming the oldest conductor of a Proms concert in 2014, aged 90.

His obituary in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; praises the Academy of St Martin in the Fields&#x27; interpretations of baroque and classical music as &quot;fresh, technically brilliant&quot;, and describes them as a &quot;revelation&quot;. Marriner preferred modern instruments and effects, and his work came under criticism by Hogwood, among others, for not striving for an &quot;authentic&quot; sound. He later expanded the Academy&#x27;s repertoire to include Romantic and early-modern music.

Marriner made over 600 recordings covering 2,000 different works – more than any conductor except Herbert von Karajan. He recorded for various labels, including Argo, L&#x27;Oiseau Lyre, Philips and EMI Classics. His recorded repertoire ranges from the baroque era to 20th-century British music, as well as opera. He supervised the Mozart selections for the soundtrack of the Oscar-winning 1984 film &quot;Amadeus&quot;; it became one of the most popular classical music recordings of all time, selling over 6.5 million copies.

Marriner&#x27;s final recording was completed just a few days before his death, the Mozart Piano Concerto No. 21 with Yeol Eum Son as soloist. His partnership with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields is the most recorded of any orchestra and conductor.

==Personal life and death==
Marriner was married twice. His first wife was cellist (and later, antiquarian bookseller) Diana Carbutt, whom he married in 1949. They had two children - Susie, a writer and Andrew, a clarinettist who often worked with his father and who was the principal clarinet of the London Symphony Orchestra for many years. The first marriage was dissolved in 1956. His second wife was Elizabeth Mary &quot;Molly&quot; Sims, whom he married in 1957. 

He lived in London and in later life had a second home near Chardstock in Devon. Asked for an epitaph for his gravestone, he replied simply: &quot;Follow the beat.&quot; Marriner died from heart failure on 2 October 2016, at the age of 92, at his home in London.

==Centenary==
In April 2024 the Academy marked the centenary of its founder’s birth with concerts in St Martin-in-the-Fields church, the Wigmore Hall, the Royal Festival Hall and Lincoln Cathedral (the city of his birth). The &quot;Marriner 100&quot; programme commenced on 15 April, the actual centenary day, with a concert at the orchestra’s spiritual home, St Martin-in-the-Fields, directed/conducted by leader Tomo Keller, music director Joshua Bell and former Academy flautist Jaime Martin, in which former members of the Academy Chorus, who had sung under Marriner, performed a suite from Die Schöpfung. BBC Radio 3 broadcast the concert as the climax of its &quot;Neville Marriner Day&quot;, with all its programmes devoted to his life, work and legacy. A month long centenary exhibition was held in the church.

On 14 April BBC Four broadcast &quot;Sir Neville Marriner at the Proms: Mendelssohn&#x27;s Italian Symphony&quot;, from 1983, and &quot;Sir Neville Marriner: Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No 10&quot;, from 1988, both with the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields. On 15 April BBC Radio 3 broadcast &quot;Neville Marriner Day&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
Described as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s greatest conductors&quot;, &quot;Gramophone&quot; lists Marriner as one of the 50 greatest conductors and another compilation ranks Marriner #14 of the 18 &quot;Greatest and Most Famous Conductors of All Time&quot;. he founded the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, and his partnership with them is the most recorded of any orchestra and conductor.

Marriner was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1979. He was created a Knight Bachelor in 1985. In 1990 the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded Marriner its annual Shakespeare Prize in recognition of his life&#x27;s work. In the 2015 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH). He was appointed an officer of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. His recordings of Mozart were honoured with two Gemeinde Awards from the Austrian Music Academy.

Marriner won three Grammy Awards for his recordings of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot; (1982), the soundtrack for &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1985) and violin concertos by Brahms and Stravinsky (2003). He also received a total of 9 nominations.

<text>Sir Alan Charles MacLaurin Mackerras (; (17 November 1925 – 14 July 2010) was an American-born Australian conductor. He was an authority on the operas of Janáček and Mozart, and the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan. He was long associated with the English National Opera (and its predecessor) and Welsh National Opera and was the first Australian chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. He also specialized in Czech music as a whole, producing many recordings for the Czech label Supraphon.

==Early life and education==
Mackerras was born in Schenectady, New York, to Australian parents, Alan Mackerras and Catherine MacLaurin. His father was an electrical engineer and a Quaker. Mackerras grew up in a musical family and his mother was immensely cultured. In 1928, when Charles was aged two, the family returned to Sydney. They initially lived in the suburb of Rose Bay, and in 1933 they moved to the then semi-rural suburb of Turramurra. Mackerras was the eldest of seven children. His siblings were Alastair (1928–99), Neil (1930–87), Joan (1934–2020), Elisabeth (b. 1937) and twins Malcolm and Colin (b. 1939). They are descendants of the pioneer Australian-Jewish composer and musician Isaac Nathan. Mackerras studied violin at the age of seven and later the flute. He was setting poems to music at eight and wrote a piano concerto when he was 12.

Mackerras initially attended his father&#x27;s alma mater, Sydney Grammar School, and also St Aloysius College in Sydney. While at Sydney Grammar, he showed a precocious talent by composing operas and conducting student performances in his early teens, but his non-musical studies suffered. At the all-male St Aloysius, he participated in the school&#x27;s Gilbert and Sullivan productions, playing the roles of Kate in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, Leila in &quot;Iolanthe&quot; and Ko-Ko in &quot;The Mikado&quot;. Unconvinced that music was a viable profession, his parents removed the young Mackerras from temptation by sending him to board at The King&#x27;s School. The school&#x27;s focus on sport and discipline led the young artist to run away several times, and he was eventually expelled. At age 16, Mackerras studied oboe, piano and composition at the NSW State Conservatorium of Music. He earned additional income from writing orchestral scores from recordings.

==Early career==
By 1941, while still at the conservatorium, Mackerras began to get professional performing jobs in Sydney, partly because he was too young to join the military, while older musicians had been called up to go to the war. From 1941 to 1942, Mackerras played the oboe for the J. C. Williamson Company during one of their Gilbert and Sullivan seasons, and he was a rehearsal pianist for the Kirsova ballet company. In 1943, Mackerras joined the ABC Sydney Orchestra, under Malcolm Sargent, as second oboist and at age 19, became principal oboist. On 1947, Mackerras sailed for England on the RMS Rangitiki intending to pursue conducting. He joined Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre as an orchestral oboist and cor anglais player. He later won a British Council Scholarship, enabling him to study conducting with Václav Talich at the Prague Academy of Music. While there, he formed a strong friendship with Jiří Tancibudek, Principal Oboe of the Czech Philharmonic, who introduced him to the operas of Leoš Janáček, thus commencing Mackerras&#x27;s lifelong passion for that composer&#x27;s music.

In August 1947, shortly before the couple set off for Prague, Mackerras married Judy Wilkins, a clarinettist at Sadlers&#x27; Wells. They had two daughters, Fiona and Catherine. Fiona died of cancer in September 2006. He was also the uncle of the Australian conductor Alexander Briger and the British-born American conductor Drostan Hall, Music Director of Camerata Chicago.

Returning to England from Prague in 1948, Mackerras rejoined Sadler&#x27;s Wells as an assistant conductor and began his lifelong association with the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera, now English National Opera, conducting, among others, Janáček, Handel, Gluck, Bach, and Donizetti. In the 1950s, well before the &quot;authenticity&quot; movement had come to general notice, Mackerras focused on the study and practical realization of period performance techniques, culminating in his landmark 1959 recording of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot; using the original wind band instrumentation. In his 1965 performance of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, he added the ornamentation in a historically informed style.

Mackerras also strongly championed the music of Janáček outside Czechoslovakia, where Mackerras himself judged his work with Janáček as his single most important legacy to music. In 1951, he conducted the British premiere of &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot;. He was also a noted authority on Mozart&#x27;s operas and those of Sir Arthur Sullivan. His ballet with John Cranko, &quot;Pineapple Poll&quot;, is an arrangement of Sullivan music with a story based on one of W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Bab Ballads&quot;. The piece premiered in 1951, soon after the expiration of copyright on Sullivan&#x27;s music, and continues to be a popular light music favourite in English speaking countries. Mackerras later arranged music by Giuseppe Verdi for the ballet &quot;The Lady and the Fool&quot;. He also arranged a suite from John Ireland&#x27;s score for the 1946 film &quot;The Overlanders&quot;, after Ireland&#x27;s death in 1962.

He was principal conductor of the BBC Concert Orchestra from 1954 to 1956. 
In 1962, he conducted the South Australian Symphony Orchestra in the Australian première of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; as part of the Adelaide Festival, with Adelaide-born Una Hale in the title role.
In 1963, he made his debut at London&#x27;s Covent Garden conducting Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;Katerina Izmailova&quot;. He directed the Hamburg State Opera from 1965 to 1969 and the English National Opera from 1970 to 1977. In 1972, he made his Metropolitan Opera debut in New York conducting Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;. Mackerras worked closely with Benjamin Britten for a time until 1958, when, during rehearsals for the first performance of Britten&#x27;s opera &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot;, he made comments about Britten liking the company of prepubescent boys, and Britten subsequently stopped speaking to him.

He conducted the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and Birgit Nilsson in the opening concert of the Concert Hall of the Sydney Opera House, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, in 1973.

==Later career==
Mackerras had conducted a few Gilbert and Sullivan productions for English National Opera, but his first experience as a guest conductor of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company was for &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot; during the 1975 D&#x27;Oyly Carte centenary season at the Savoy. He conducted &quot;Patience&quot; at the Proms in 1976, the first full-length Gilbert and Sullivan opera given in its entirety at the Proms. In 1980 he joined the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Trust and later its board of trustees. In the early 1980s, he conducted two New Year&#x27;s Eve broadcasts of Savoy operas for the BBC, and his recordings of eight of the operas were broadcast in 1989 by BBC Radio 2 as part of a complete Gilbert and Sullivan series. He also conducted a centennial performance of Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; in Leeds and the first staging of a complete Gilbert and Sullivan opera at the Royal Opera House, &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;, with Welsh National Opera in 1995. In 1980, also, he became the first non-Briton to conduct the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Last Night of the Proms.

In 1982 Mackerras was the first Australian national appointed chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, a post he held until 1985. he directed the Welsh National Opera from 1987 to 1992, where his Janáček productions won particular praise. One of the highlights of the 1991 season was the reopening of the Estates Theatre in Prague, scene of the original premiere of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, in which Mackerras conducted a new production of that opera to mark the bicentenary of Mozart&#x27;s death. As Conductor Emeritus of Welsh National Opera, his successes included &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;, and &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; (all of whose productions were brought to London). He was the principal guest conductor of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra (SCO) from 1992 to 1995 and held the title of Conductor Laureate with the SCO. He was principal guest conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from 1993 to 1996. During the same period, he was also principal guest conductor of the San Francisco Opera. From 1998 to 2001 he was the music director of the Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s. From 1987, he regularly conducted the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and was appointed Emeritus Conductor in 2007.

In 2004 he became principal guest conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra. He was also principal guest conductor of the Czech Philharmonic. With the Royal Opera, he conducted productions of Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; and Handel&#x27;s &quot;Semele&quot;. Mackerras also had a long association with the Metropolitan Opera, where he conducted &quot;The Makropulos Case&quot;, &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot;, &quot;Le prophète&quot;, &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;.

In August 2008, Mackerras was announced as the new Honorary President of the Edinburgh International Festival Society. He was only the second person to hold this role, after Yehudi Menuhin. As the original part of the largest arts festival in the world, the Edinburgh International Festival featured performances from Mackerras throughout six decades since his first in 1952. 

Mackerras summarised his strategy for working with an orchestra as follows:
Mackerras was the President of Trinity College of Music, London. He also served as Music Advisor to City Opera of Vancouver, a professional chamber opera company led by conductor Charles Barber. He was also a Patron of Bampton Classical Opera. From 1999 Mackerras was a Patron of the Australian children&#x27;s cancer charity Redkite.

On 18 December 2008, Mackerras served as the conductor for Alfred Brendel&#x27;s final concert performance with the Vienna Philharmonic. Mackerras&#x27;s last performance at the BBC Proms was conducting Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Patience&quot;. His final public performance saw him conduct &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; at Glyndebourne in the summer of 2010.

==Death==
Mackerras died in London on 14 July 2010 at the age of 84, having suffered from cancer. Throughout his final illness, he had continued to conduct, and had been scheduled to direct two of the BBC Proms on and 2010. He was also due to conduct the Scottish Chamber Orchestra performing Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot; at the Edinburgh International Festival in August 2010, which would have been his 56th appearance at the festival. The director of the BBC Proms, Roger Wright, announced that a Prom would be dedicated to Mackerras&#x27;s memory. Wright paid tribute to Mackerras, saying &quot;Sir Charles was a great conductor and his loss will be deeply felt by musicians and audiences alike&quot;, while Rory Jeffes of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra said that Australia had &quot;lost a living treasure&quot;. Mackerras was survived by his wife, Judy (1922–2014) and their daughter, Catherine. His funeral was held at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden on 23 July 2010.

==Recordings==
Mackerras made his earliest records for EMI, in the final days of 78 rpm records, and he continued recording well into the era of compact discs in the multi-channel Super Audio CD format. In 1952, he conducted his first recording of his own &quot;Pineapple Poll&quot; ballet, which was issued on twelve sides, and subsequently transferred to LP. He later conducted two more complete recordings of the ballet. Some of his early recording sessions were for Walter Legge, standing in when Otto Klemperer and other eminent conductors were ill. He did not always restrict himself to the classical repertoire. For example, on 1955 he recorded Albert Arlen&#x27;s song &quot;Clancy of the Overflow&quot; (to Banjo Paterson&#x27;s poem) with Peter Dawson and the London Symphony Orchestra.

A smaller UK record company, Pye Records, asked Mackerras to record Handel&#x27;s &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot;. &#x27;We had to do that in the middle of the night, in order to get our twenty-six oboes together.&#x27; The recording, issued in 1959, was received with critical acclaim for attempting to reproduce the sound Handel would have heard, rather than the smoother orchestral arrangements usually played at that time.

In the 1960s Mackerras made the first recording of the Italian version of Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo&quot;. For DG he conducted Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, and for HMV a &#x27;new-look&#x27; &quot;Messiah&quot;, with scholarly texts, small forces and sprightly tempi. He followed that up with Handel&#x27;s &quot;Saul&quot; and &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot; for DG. He also recorded the first complete &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; with Beverly Sills. In 1986, he conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the soundtrack to Carroll Ballard&#x27;s film version of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; (better known as &quot;Nutcracker: The Motion Picture&quot;), the first full-length film version of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet to be given a major release in theatres.

Mackerras recorded three Mahler symphonies and all of the symphonies of Mozart, Brahms and Beethoven. Along with the Mozart operas, these recordings continue to attract critical acclaim; as do his recordings of the operas of Janáček (Decca, Supraphon, and Chandos), and major works of Handel, Dvořák, Martinů, Richard Strauss, Shostakovich, Sibelius, Donizetti, Elgar, Delius, Walton, Holst, and Haydn, among many others.

In 1953, he conducted Sullivan&#x27;s cello concerto, broadcast on the BBC. Sullivan&#x27;s manuscript and most of the orchestra parts were destroyed in a fire, and more than three decades after that single BBC performance, in collaboration with David Mackie, Mackerras reconstructed the concerto, conducting its first performance with cellist Julian Lloyd Webber and the London Symphony Orchestra at Barbican Hall, London, in April 1986, and a recording for EMI shortly afterwards. For Telarc in the 1990s, with Welsh National Opera&#x27;s chorus and orchestra, he also conducted Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, &quot;The Mikado&quot; and &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;.

Mackerras&#x27;s discography also includes a recording of Britten&#x27;s &quot;Gloriana&quot;, which won &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Opera Recording&quot; in 1994. In 1997, Mackerras recorded &quot;Le delizie dell&#x27;amor&quot;, with the soprano Andrea Rost, for Sony Classical. His latest release for that label was &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; with the Hanover Band (S2K 63174). Other later recordings for Sony Classical include Chopin&#x27;s two piano concertos with Emanuel Ax and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (SK 60771) and (SK 63371). He also recorded Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Rusalka&quot; (Decca) and &quot;Slavonic Dances&quot; (Supraphon), Josef Suk&#x27;s &quot;A Summer Tale&quot; (Decca), Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concertos Nos. 20 and 24 with Alfred Brendel (Philips), and Brahms&#x27;s two orchestral serenades (Telarc). For Linn Records he recorded a two-SACD set of Mozart&#x27;s last four symphonies with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra in August 2007. His final recording was Suk&#x27;s &quot;Asrael Symphony&quot;, which was the composer&#x27;s response to the deaths in quick succession of his father-in-law Dvořák and his wife. It was recorded not long after the death of Mackerras&#x27;s own daughter Fiona.

==Honours==
Charles Mackerras was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1974 New Year Honours, and was knighted in the 1979 New Year Honours. In 1978, he was presented with the Janáček Medal for services to Czech music, on stage at the Coliseum Theatre, by the Czechoslovak ambassador. In 1990, he was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Hull. In 1996, he received the Medal of Merit from the Czech Republic, and, in 1997 he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for services to music and Australian music. In 2000, he was awarded the Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award presented jointly by the Prague Society for International Cooperation and Global Panel Foundation. In 2001, he was awarded the Centenary Medal, created to mark the centenary of the Federation of Australia. In 2003 he was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. In 2005, he was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medal, and he was also the first recipient of the Queen&#x27;s Medal for Music, announced by the Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, on the stage of the Royal Albert Hall before a Proms performance of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. He was awarded a Fellowship of the Royal Northern College of Music in 1999.

==Legacy==
The Music Room at the Bodleian&#x27;s Weston Library at Oxford University was named after Mackerras when it opened in 2015.

<text>Władysław Szpilman (; 5 December 1911 – 6 July 2000) was a Polish Jewish pianist, classical composer and Holocaust survivor. Szpilman is widely known as the central figure in the Roman Polanski film &quot;The Pianist&quot;, which was based on his autobiographical account of how he survived the German occupation of Warsaw. In the film, Szpilman is portrayed by American actor Adrien Brody.

Szpilman studied piano at music academies in Berlin and Warsaw. He became a popular performer on Polish Radio and in concert. Confined within the Warsaw Ghetto after the German invasion of Poland, Szpilman spent two years in hiding. Following the Warsaw Uprising and the subsequent destruction of the city, he was helped by Wilm Hosenfeld, a German officer who detested Nazi policies. After World War II, Szpilman resumed his career on Polish Radio. Szpilman was also a prolific composer; his output included hundreds of songs and many orchestral pieces. Szpilman was also recognized as the most famous of the &quot;Robinson Crusoes&quot;, a term referring to Poles who survived in the ruins of Warsaw after the Warsaw Uprising.

== Career as a pianist ==
Szpilman began his study of the piano at the Chopin Academy of Music in Warsaw, Poland, where he studied piano with Aleksander Michałowski and Józef Śmidowicz, first- and second-generation pupils of Franz Liszt. In 1931, he was a student of the prestigious Academy of Arts in Berlin, Germany, where he studied with Artur Schnabel, Franz Schreker, and Leonid Kreutzer. After Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Szpilman returned to Warsaw, where he quickly became a celebrated pianist and composer of both classical and popular music. Primarily a soloist, he was also the chamber music partner of such acclaimed violinists as Roman Totenberg, Ida Haendel and Henryk Szeryng, and in 1934, he toured Poland with U.S. violinist, Bronislav Gimpel.

On 5 April 1935, Szpilman joined the Polish Radio, where he worked as a pianist performing classical and jazz music. His compositions at this time included orchestral works, piano pieces, and also music for films, as well as roughly 50 songs, many of which became quite popular in Poland. At the time of the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, he was a celebrity and a featured soloist at the Polskie Radio, which was bombed on 23 September 1939, shortly after broadcasting the last Chopin recital played by Szpilman. The Nazi occupiers established the General Government, and created ghettos in many Polish cities, including Warsaw. Szpilman and his family did not yet need to find a new residence, as their apartment was already in the ghetto area.

== Survival during the Holocaust ==

Władysław Szpilman and his family, along with all other Jews living in Warsaw, were forced to move into a &quot;Jewish quarter&quot; – the Warsaw Ghetto – on 31 October 1940. Once all the Jews were confined within the ghetto, a wall was constructed to separate them from the rest of the Nazi German-occupied city. Szpilman managed to find work as a musician to support his family, which included his mother, father, brother Henryk, and two sisters, Regina and Halina. He first worked at the &quot;Nowoczesna&quot; Cafe, where the patrons sometimes ignored his playing in order to conduct business, as he recalled in the memoir.

Szpilman later played in a cafe on Sienna Street and after 1942 in the &quot;Sztuka&quot; Cafe on Leszno Street as well. In these last two cafes he performed chamber music with violinist Zygmunt Lederman, performed in the piano duo with Andrzej Goldfeder, and played with other musicians as well.

Everyone in his family was deported in 1942 to Treblinka, an extermination camp within German-occupied Poland approximately northeast of Warsaw. A member of the Jewish Police assisting in deportations, who recognized Szpilman, pulled him from a line of people—including his parents, brother, and two sisters—being loaded onto a train at the transport site (which, as in other ghettos, was called the &quot;Umschlagplatz&quot;). None of Szpilman&#x27;s family members survived the war. Szpilman stayed in the ghetto as a labourer, and helped smuggle in weapons for the coming Jewish resistance uprising. Szpilman remained in the Warsaw Ghetto until 13 February 1943, shortly before it was abolished after the deportation of most of its inhabitants in April–May 1943.

Szpilman found places to hide in Warsaw and survived with the help of his friends from Polish Radio and fellow musicians such as Andrzej Bogucki and his wife Janina, Czesław Lewicki, and Helena Lewicka supported by Edmund Rudnicki, Witold Lutosławski, Eugenia Umińska, Piotr Perkowski, and Irena Sendler. About thirty non-Jewish Poles were involved in helping Szpilman during the war.

He evaded capture several times. Beginning in August 1944, Szpilman was hiding out in an abandoned building at Aleja Niepodległości Street 223. In November, he was discovered there by a German officer, Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, who instructed him to play the piano in the building. To Szpilman&#x27;s surprise, Hosenfeld also helped him, bringing him food and supplies on several occasions until the Germans retreated from Warsaw.

== Polish Radio ==
Szpilman started playing for Polish Radio in 1935 as their house pianist. In 1939, on 23 September, Szpilman was in the middle of broadcasting when Germans opened fire on the studio and he was forced to stop playing. This was the last live music broadcast that was heard until the war&#x27;s end. When Szpilman resumed his job at Polish Radio in 1945, he did so by carrying on where he left off six years before: poignantly, he opened the first transmission by once again playing Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Nocturne in C-sharp Minor&quot; (&quot;Lento con gran espressione&quot;).
From 1945 to 1963, Szpilman was director of the Popular Music Department at Polish Radio. Szpilman performed at the same time as a concert pianist and chamber musician in Poland, as well as throughout Europe, Asia, and America. During this period, he composed several symphonic works and about 500 other compositions that are still popular in Poland today. He also wrote music for radio plays and films and in 1961, he created the International Song Contest in Sopot, Poland, which has been produced every summer for more than 50 years.
Szpilman and Bronislav Gimpel founded the Warsaw Piano Quintet in 1963 with which Szpilman performed more than 2000 concerts worldwide until 1986 in such places as Royal Festival Hall in London; Salle Pleyel and Salle Gaveau in Paris; Herkules Saal in Munich; as well as the Salzburger Festspiele, Brahmstage Baden-Baden, Musikhalle Hamburg a.o.

== Compositions ==
From his early Berlin years, Szpilman never gave up the will to write music, even when living in the Warsaw Ghetto. His compositions include orchestral works, concertos, piano pieces, but also significant amounts of music for radio plays and films, as well as around 500 songs. More than 100 of these are very well known as hits and evergreens in Poland. In the 1950s, he wrote about 40 songs for children, for which he received an award from the Polish Composers Union in 1955.

His son Andrzej commented in 1998 that Szpilman&#x27;s works did not reach a larger audience outside Poland, attributing this to the &quot;division of Europe into two halves culturally as well as politically&quot; after the war. His father &quot;shaped the Polish popular music scene over several decades—but the western frontier of Poland constituted a barrier&quot; to music from the Eastern bloc countries. (Andrzej Szpilman&#x27;s &quot;Foreword&quot; to the 1999 edition of &quot;The Pianist&quot;, p. 8)

Szpilman&#x27;s compositions include the suite for piano &quot;Life of the Machines&quot; 1932, Violin Concerto 1933, &quot;Waltzer in the Olden Style&quot; 1937, film soundtracks: &quot;Świt, dzień i noc Palestyny&quot; (1934), &quot;Wrzos&quot; (1938) and &quot;Doctor Murek&quot; (1939), Concertino for Piano and Orchestra (1940), Paraphrase on Own Themes (1948) &quot;Ouverture for Symphonic Orchestra&quot; (1968) and many very popular songs in Poland. His works are now published in printed editions by Boosey &amp; Hawkes/Bote &amp; Bock Music Publishers in New York, Berlin, and London.

In 1961, he initiated and organized the Sopot International Song Festival produced in Poland every summer, now for more than 50 years. He founded the Polish Union of Authors of Popular Music.

== The book ==
&quot;The Death of a City&quot; (original &quot;Śmierć miasta&quot;) was written by Wladyslaw Szpilman and elaborated by Jerzy Waldorff shortly after the war ended, and first printed in 1946 by the publishing house &quot;Wiedza&quot;. The book was censored by Stalinist authorities for political reasons. For example, the nationality of benevolent German officer Wilm Hosenfeld was changed to Austrian. As the East German dissident singer-songwriter Wolf Biermann observed in his epilogue for the 1999 English-language edition: &quot;Directly after the war it was impossible to publish a book in Poland which presented a German officer as a brave and helpful man,&quot; and an Austrian hero would be &quot;not quite so bad.&quot; Biermann added caustically, &quot;In the years of the Cold War Austria and East Germany were linked by a common piece of hypocrisy: both pretended to have been forcibly occupied by Hitler&#x27;s Germany.&quot;

In 1998, Szpilman&#x27;s son Andrzej published a new extended edition of his father&#x27;s memoir, first in German translation by Karin Wolff as &quot;Das wunderbare Überleben&quot; (The Miraculous Survival) by a German publishing house Ullstein Verlag; and then in English translation by Anthea Bell as &quot;The Pianist&quot; with Epilogue by Wolf Biermann. In March 1999 Władysław Szpilman visited London for Jewish Book Week, where he met English readers to mark the publication of the book in Great Britain. It was later published in more than 35 languages, named &quot;Best book of the year&quot; by &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;Library Journal&quot;, and won the Annual Jewish-Quarterly Wingate Prize 2000, and &quot;Best book of the year 2001&quot; by magazines &quot;Lire&quot; and &quot;Elle&quot; (Paris) in 2002. The New Polish edition, &quot;Pianista : warszawskie wspomnienia 1939–1945&quot; (Kraków: Znak, 2000) became a number 1 on the bestseller list of the Polish newspaper &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; for 3 years in 2001–2003.

As it reached a much larger audience, Szpilman&#x27;s memoir was widely praised. Britain&#x27;s &quot;Independent&quot; described it as &quot;a compelling, harrowing masterpiece&quot;; it is &quot;one of the most powerful accounts ever written&quot; of the era declared another leading British daily. The book&#x27;s description of the famed Warsaw teacher and writer Janusz Korczak has been described as &quot;overwhelmingly powerful and poignant.&quot; Korczak declined to save himself from deportation to Treblinka; instead, he walked with the children of his orphanage to the deportation site and ultimately escorted them &quot;into the next world,&quot; as Szpilman related:
The 1999 English-language edition also includes excerpts from Wilm Hosenfeld&#x27;s diary (1942–44). Biermann&#x27;s Epilogue gives further insight into Hosenfeld&#x27;s deeds and his character. He aided several other would-be victims in Warsaw; Hosenfeld nonetheless died (in 1952) after seven years in Soviet captivity, despite the efforts of Szpilman to help him.

Although it concludes with his survival, Szpilman declined to conclude his memoir on a happy note. In the final paragraphs, he walks the streets of an abandoned and devastated Warsaw: &quot;A stormy wind rattled the scrap-iron in the ruins, whistling and howling through the charred cavities of the windows. Twilight came on. Snow fell from the darkening, leaden sky.&quot; As one reviewer noted, &quot;these final sentences distill the style of this astonishing and unforgettable book. Concise yet highly evocative; measured and somewhat detached, yet possessing a poeticism and a consistent spiritual tenor and strength.&quot;

===Film adaptation===
In 2002, the Polish-French film-maker, Roman Polanski, directed a screen version of the book. The movie won three Academy Awards in 2003 – Oscars for best director; best actor, and best adapted screenplay, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Best Film Award, and the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Polanski escaped the Kraków Ghetto and survived the Nazi genocides but his mother was killed by the German occupiers. Polanski&#x27;s film closely follows the book&#x27;s style and details. Adrien Brody, accepting the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role for &quot;The Pianist&quot;, said – ...&quot;This film would not be possible without the blueprint provided by Wladyslaw Szpilman. This is a tribute to his survival.&quot;

Szpilman&#x27;s son, Andrzej Szpilman, compiled and released a CD with the most popular songs Szpilman had composed under the title &quot;Wendy Lands Sings the Songs of the Pianist&quot; (Universal Music). Other CDs with the works of Szpilman include &quot;Works for Piano and Orchestra by Władysław Szpilman&quot; with Ewa Kupiec (piano), John Axelrod (director), and the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (2004) (Sony classical) and the &quot;Original recordings of The Pianist&quot; and &quot;Władysław Szpilman-Legendary recordings&quot; (Sony classical). In November 1998, Szpilman was honored by the president of Poland with a Commander&#x27;s Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta.

== Death and tributes ==
Szpilman died of natural causes in Warsaw on 6 July 2000, aged 88. His death was not widely reported at the time. He is buried at Powązki Military Cemetery. On 25 September 2011, Polish Radio’s Studio 1 was renamed for Władysław Szpilman. On 4 December 2011, a commemorative plaque to Szpilman, engraved in Polish and English, was unveiled at 223 Niepodległości Avenue in Warsaw, in the presence of his wife Halina Szpilman and son Andrzej, and Wilm Hosenfeld&#x27;s daughter Jorinde Krejci-Hosenfeld. The next day, on the exact centenary of Szpilman&#x27;s birth, Polish President Bronisław Komorowski met Szpilman&#x27;s widow and son, and Krejci-Hosenfeld.

Uri Caine, an American classical and jazz pianist and composer, created his own interpretations of Szpilman’s works in a variety of genres. The CD of Caine&#x27;s concert was released on 24 February 2014.

<text>The Bristol Type 223 was an early design for a supersonic transport. In the late 1950s and early 1960s the Bristol Aeroplane Company studied a number of models as part of a large British inter-company effort funded by the government. These models eventually culminated in the Type 223, a transatlantic transport for about 100 passengers at a speed around Mach 2. At about the same time Sud Aviation in France was developing the similar Super-Caravelle design, and in November 1962 the efforts were merged to create the Concorde project.

==Development==

===Background===

In the UK, as elsewhere in the 1950s, the aero industry had been producing a series of supersonic test aircraft and had extensively studied the problems of sustained high-speed flight. By the mid-1950s, two designs had been shown to have a lift-to-drag ratio suitable for supersonic cruise, a sharply swept M-wing pioneered at Armstrong-Whitworth for slightly supersonic flight and very slender delta wings suitable for a wide range of speeds. Higher speeds up to Mach 3 had been considered and found to be possible, but it appeared that a practical upper limit was Mach 2.2; above this speed the duralumin used for most aircraft construction would start to soften due to the heat of friction, and some new material would have to be used instead. Stainless steel was considered, but the Bristol 188 proved this to be difficult and expensive.

===STAC===
By 1956 there was enough official interest in this research for the Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee, or STAC, to be formed under Sir Morien Morgan to investigate the creation of a supersonic transport. Its first report, in 1959, recommended two designs. One was an M-wing Mach 1.2 medium range airliner and the other a straight wing, Mach 1.8 design with six wingtip engines. Soon after, however, studies at the Royal Aircraft Establishment began to favour the gothic delta and design contracts using this planform went to Hawker Siddeley and Bristol in late 1959. Both were asked to look at both Mach 2.2 aluminium alloy and Mach 2.7 stainless steel structures. Bristol&#x27;s Mach 2.7 design was labelled the Type 213. Their designer, Archibald Russell, was influenced by the constructional problems and expense encountered with the Bristol 188 and favoured the lower speed alloy aircraft.

The thin wing design of the Type 213 was preferred by the STC and a 1961 contract encouraged a detailed series of studies of a 130-seat, Mach 2.2 aircraft powered by six Bristol Olympus engines under the generic Type 198 label. Aware of the great expense of the project, STAC required Bristol to share the cost with an overseas partner. In 1961, Sud Aviation revealed their plans for the Super-Caravelle at the Paris Air Show, a smaller aircraft than the Type 198. Bristol proposed a design which came between the Super Caravelle and the Type 198 which they called the Type 223; the French were looking at a slightly larger version of the Super Caravelle and the two companies had a specification for agreement to build an aircraft jointly. Throughout 1962 they and their respective governments negotiated the formation of a consortium to share development and production costs, estimated at £15m-£170m. On 29 November 1962 an agreement was jointly signed by the UK Minister for Aviation, Julian Amery and the French ambassador, Geoffrey de Courcel and the Concorde project was underway.

<text>Hawker Siddeley was a group of British manufacturing companies engaged in aircraft production. Hawker Siddeley combined the legacies of several British aircraft manufacturers, emerging through a series of mergers and acquisitions as one of only two such major British companies in the 1960s. In 1977, Hawker Siddeley became a founding component of the nationalised British Aerospace (BAe). Hawker Siddeley also operated in other industrial markets, such as locomotive building (through its ownership of Brush Traction) and diesel engine manufacture (through its ownership of Lister Petter). The company was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

==History==

===Origins===
Hawker Siddeley Aircraft was formed in 1935 as a result of the purchase by Hawker Aircraft of the companies of J. D. Siddeley, the automotive and engine builder Armstrong Siddeley and the aircraft manufacturer Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft. At this time, Hawker Siddeley also acquired A.V. Roe &amp; Company (Avro), Gloster Aircraft Company (Gloster) and Air Training Services. The constituent companies continued to produce their own aircraft designs under their own name as well as sharing manufacturing work throughout the group.

During the Second World War, Hawker Siddeley was one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s most important aviation concerns, producing numerous designs including the famous Hawker Hurricane fighter plane that, along with the Supermarine Spitfire, was Britain&#x27;s front-line defence in the Battle of Britain. During this campaign, Hurricanes outnumbered all other British fighters combined in service, and were responsible for shooting down 55 per cent of all enemy aircraft destroyed.

===Avro Canada===
In 1945, Hawker Siddeley purchased Victory Aircraft of Malton, Ontario, Canada from the Canadian government, renaming the company A.V. Roe Canada, commonly known as Avro Canada, initially a wholly owned subsidiary of Hawker Siddeley. Avro Canada underwent a major expansion through aircraft development and acquisition of aircraft engine, mining, steel, railway rolling stock, computers, electronics, and other businesses to become, by 1958, Canada&#x27;s third largest company directly employing over 14,000 people and providing 45% of the parent company&#x27;s revenues. During its operation, Avro Canada aircraft (built) included the C102 Jetliner, CF-100 Canuck, CF-105 Arrow and VZ-9- AV Avrocar. Only the CF-100 fighter entered full-scale production. Other design projects (not built) included supersonic transport (SST) passenger aircraft, a mach-2 VTOL fighter, hovercraft, a jet engine-powered tank, and the hypersonic Space Threshold Vehicle. After the cancellation of the Arrow, the company began to unravel. In 1962, A.V. Roe Canada was dissolved and the remaining assets were transferred to the now defunct Hawker Siddeley Canada.

===Postwar===
In 1948, the company name was changed to Hawker Siddeley Group. The aircraft division became Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) and the guided missile and space technology operations as Hawker Siddeley Dynamics (HSD). In 1959, the aero engine business, Armstrong Siddeley was merged with that of the Bristol Aero Engines to form Bristol Siddeley. In the late 1950s, the British government decided that with the decreasing number of aircraft contracts being offered, it was better to merge the existing companies, of which there were about 15 surviving at this point, into several much larger firms. Out of this decision, came the &quot;order&quot; that all future contracts being offered had to include agreements to merge companies. In 1959, Folland Aircraft was acquired, followed by de Havilland Aircraft Company and Blackburn Aircraft in 1960. In 1963, the names of the constituent companies were dropped, with products being rebranded as &quot;&quot;Hawker Siddeley&quot; or &quot;HS&quot;&quot;. In this period, the company developed the first operational, and, by far, the most successful VTOL jet aircraft, the Harrier family. This aircraft remained in production into the 1990s and remains in service.

====Hawker Siddeley Nuclear Power Company====
The Hawker Siddeley Nuclear Power Company built and operated the 10 kW JASON reactor in Langley, Berkshire (then in Buckinghamshire). The reactor was in operation there from 1959 to 1962 and generated a total of 1.4 MWh before being shut down and transported to the Royal Naval College in Greenwich, London.

====Kingston headquarters and factory====
In 1948, Hawker Siddeley acquired a factory in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, on the Richmond Road near Ham. This was to become their main aircraft factory and headquarters.

====Expansion into railways====
In 1957, Hawker Siddeley purchased the Brush group of companies that included Brush Electrical Machines, and Brush Traction, which manufactures electromotive equipment and railway locomotives. The Brush prototype locomotives &quot;Falcon&quot;, and the futuristic but over-weight HS4000 &#x27;Kestrel&#x27;, were produced there. Other railway engineering assets were acquired, including Westinghouse Brake &amp; Signal and the engine builder Mirrlees Blackstone, which came with the Brush businesses.

In the early 1970s, Hawker Siddeley&#x27;s Canada Car and Foundry subsidiary began to build rapid transit vehicles for the North American market. The first order was for the Port Authority Trans-Hudson line and consisted of 46 PA-3 cars numbers 724–769, which were largely based on the original hexagonal profile PA-1 &amp; PA-2 cars designed and built by the St. Louis Car Company during 1966–67. Hawker Siddeley later sold the same general design to the MBTA in Boston for their Blue and Orange Lines. 70 48&#x27; cars were delivered to the Blue Line in 1978–80 and 120 65&#x27; cars were delivered to the Orange Line in 1980–81. Hawker Siddeley also manufactured much of the Toronto subway system&#x27;s older rolling stock, the H5 and H6 models. The heavy rail manufacturing business, based in Mississauga and Thunder Bay, Ontario, are now part of Alstom.

MBTA also bought a number of commuter rail coaches from the German firm Messerschmitt, thereby teaming Hawker Siddeley with its old World War II rival under the same organisation.

===Nationalisation of aircraft production===
On 29 April 1977, as a result of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977, Hawker Siddeley Aviation and Dynamics were nationalised and merged with British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) and Scottish Aviation to form British Aerospace. However, HSA and HSD accounted for only 25% of the Hawker Siddeley business by this time, and the non-aviation and foreign interests were retained by a holding company known as &quot;Hawker Siddeley Group Plc&quot; after 1980.

===Rationalisation and sale to BTR===
The group rationalised in the 1980s, focusing on railway engineering and signalling, industrial electronics and instrumentation and signalling equipment.

Orenda Aerospace, the only remaining original company from the Avro Canada / Hawker Siddeley Canada era, although greatly diminished in size and scope of operations, became part of the Magellan Aerospace Corporation.

The late 1980s also saw Hawker Siddeley divest itself of much of its other North American heavy manufacturing enterprises. Its Talladega, Alabama-based TreeFarmer heavy equipment business was sold to Franklin Equipment in 1990 and
its Canadian rail car production facilities were split between SNC-Lavalin and Bombardier in 1992.

In 1992, Hawker Siddeley Group Plc was acquired by BTR plc for £1.5bn. This was led by Alan Jackson and Sir Owen Green who were the CEO and Chairman of BTR respectively during this time. Through a series of takeovers, the business units finally became part of Schneider Electric in 2014.

===Hawker Siddeley name today===
In 1973, HS acquired the industrial electronics firm South Wales Switchgear. Later known as Aberdare Holdings, in 1992 this company was renamed &quot;Hawker Siddeley Switchgear&quot; (HSS). They have an Australian subsidiary, &quot;Hawker Siddeley Switchgear Australia&quot;. Another company which retains the name is &quot;Hawker Siddeley Power Transformers.&quot;

In 1993, British Aerospace sold its corporate jet product line to the American Raytheon Company. In 2006 the product line was sold to a new company to be known as &quot;Hawker Beechcraft&quot;, owned by Onex Partners and Goldman Sachs.

<text>A beekeeper is a person who keeps honey bees, a profession known as beekeeping.

Beekeepers are also called honey farmers, apiarists, or less commonly, apiculturists (both from the Latin &quot;&quot;, bee; cf. apiary). The term beekeeper refers to a person who keeps honey bees in beehives, boxes, or other receptacles. The beekeeper does not control the creatures. The beekeeper owns the hives or boxes and associated equipment. The bees are free to forage or leave (swarm) as they desire. Bees usually return to the beekeeper&#x27;s hive as the hive presents a clean, dark, sheltered home.

==Purposes of beekeeping==

===Value of honey bees===

Honey bees produce commodities such as honey, beeswax, pollen, propolis, and royal jelly. Some beekeepers also raise queens and other bees to sell to other farmers, and to satisfy scientific curiosity. Beekeepers also use honeybees to provide pollination services to fruit and vegetable growers. Many people keep bees as a hobby. Others do it for income either as a sideline to other work or as a commercial operator. These factors affect the number of colonies maintained by the beekeeper.

===Commodity===
Beekeepers may produce commodities (farm products) for sale. Honey is the most valuable commodity sold by beekeepers. Honey-producer beekeepers try to maintain maximum-strength colonies of bees in areas with dense nectar sources. They produce and sell liquified honey and sometimes honeycombs. Beekeepers may sell their commodities retail, as self-brokers, or through commercial packers and distributors. Beeswax, pollen, royal jelly, and propolis may also be significant revenue generators. Taiwanese beekeepers, for example, export tonnes of royal jelly, the high-nutrition food supplement fed to queen honeybees. Modern beekeepers seldom keep honeybees exclusively for beeswax production. Beeswax is harvested along with honey and rectified for sale.

===Pollination===

Some beekeepers provide a pollination service to other farmers. These beekeepers might not produce any honey for sale. Pollination beekeepers move vast quantities of honey bee hives at night so fruits and vegetables have enough pollinating insects available for maximum levels of production. In 2016, almonds accounted for 86% of all U.S. expenditures on pollination services. For the service of maintaining strong colonies of bees and moving them into crops such as almonds, apples, cherries, blueberries, melons, and squash, these beekeepers are usually paid a cash fee.

===Queen breeding===

Queen breeders are specialist beekeepers who raise queen bees for other beekeepers. The breeders maintain select stock with superior qualities and tend to raise their bees in geographic regions with early springs. These beekeepers may also provide extra bees to beekeepers (honey producers, pollinators, or hobby beekeepers) who want to start new operations or expand their farms. Queen breeders use Jenter kits in order to produce large numbers of queen bees quickly and efficiently.

==Classifications of beekeepers==

===Hobby beekeepers===

Most beekeepers are hobby beekeepers. These people typically work or own only a few hives. Their main attraction is an interest in ecology and natural science. Honey is a by-product of this hobby. As it typically requires a significant investment to establish a small apiary and dozens of hours of work with hives and honey equipment, hobby beekeeping is seldom profitable outside of Europe, where the lack of organic bee products sometimes causes buoyant demand for privately produced honey.

Beekeeping as a hobby/career is an activity for people who are interested in having their own beehives. Beekeepers create profit by selling honey, honeycomb, and wax. Honey is high in demand; according to the (KBC News hour) honey is worth more than oil. Overall, beekeeping has potential to create not only a way for people to make extra money, but it also benefits the environment due to providing efficient cross pollination. However, there is a cost for starting a beekeeping business. Initial investments are expensive, as typically the first year&#x27;s profits are used to pay off the initial investment. Profit should be expected only after the second or third year. People who seem interested in having beehives in their backyard must also consider the legal aspect of the practice, as different cities have different laws regarding the use of beehives.

===Sideline beekeepers===

A sideline beekeeper attempts to make a profit keeping bees, but relies on another source of income. Sideliners may operate up to 300 colonies of bees, producing 10–20 metric tons of honey worth tens of thousands of US dollars each year.

===Commercial beekeepers===

Commercial beekeepers control hundreds or thousands of colonies of bees. The most extensive own and operate up to 50,000 colonies of bees, and they produce millions of pounds of honey. The first major commercial beekeeper was Petro Prokopovych from Ukraine, operating 6600 colonies in the early 19th century. Moses Quinby was the first commercial beekeeper in the US, with 1200 colonies by the 1840s. Later (1960s-1970s), Jim Powers of Idaho, USA, had 30,000 honey producing hives. Miel Carlota operated by partners Arturo Wulfrath and Juan Speck of Mexico operated at least 50,000 hives of honey bees from 1920 to 1960. Today, Adee Honey Farm in South Dakota, USA, (80,000 colonies) and Comvita in New Zealand (30,000+ colonies) are among the world&#x27;s largest beekeeping enterprises. Worldwide, commercial beekeepers number about 5% of the individuals with bees but produce about 60% of the world&#x27;s honey crop.
Commercial beekeeping is on the rise, especially in high-value markets such as pollination in North America and honey production (especially Manuka honey) in New Zealand.

==Notable beekeepers==

Since Petro Prokopovych became the first major commercial beekeeper, there have been people along the way who have contributed to the success of keeping honey bees. From studying their genetics, to writing well-known novels, to constructing tools to assist in the industry, these beekeepers helped guide the profession.

 Fashion 

Beekeeper fashion includes a protective suit to try to prevent injuries while working with the hives. Covering beekeepers from head to toe, the material, gloves, and veil contribute to the protection of the beekeeper.

<text>The National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (Inria) () is a French national research institution focusing on computer science and applied mathematics.
It was created under the name French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (IRIA) () in 1967 at Rocquencourt near Paris, part of Plan Calcul. Its first site was the historical premises of SHAPE (central command of NATO military forces), which is still used as Inria&#x27;s main headquarters. In 1980, IRIA became INRIA. Since 2011, it has been styled &quot;Inria&quot;.

Inria is a Public Scientific and Technical Research Establishment (EPST) under the double supervision of the French Ministry of National Education, Advanced Instruction and Research and the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry.

==Administrative status==

Inria has nine research centers distributed across France (in Bordeaux, Grenoble-Inovallée, Lille, Lyon, Nancy, Paris-Rocquencourt, Rennes, Saclay, and Sophia Antipolis) and one center abroad in Santiago de Chile, Chile. It also contributes to academic research teams outside of those centers.

Inria Rennes is part of the joint Institut de recherche en informatique et systèmes aléatoires (IRISA) with several other entities.

Before December 2007, the three centers of Bordeaux, Lille and Saclay formed a single research center called INRIA Futurs.

In October 2010, Inria, with Pierre and Marie Curie University (Now Sorbonne University) and Paris Diderot University started IRILL, a center for innovation and research initiative for free software.

Inria employs 3800 people. Among them are 1300 researchers, 1000 Ph.D. students and 500 postdoctorates.

==Research==

Inria does both theoretical and applied research in computer science. In the process, it has produced many widely used programs, such as

* Bigloo, a Scheme implementation
* CADP, a tool box for the verification of asynchronous concurrent systems
* Caml, a language from the ML family
** Caml Light and OCaml implementations
* Chorus, microkernel-based distributed operating system
* CompCert, verified C compiler for PowerPC, ARM and x86_32
* Contrail
* Coq, a proof assistant
* CYCLADES, pioneered the use of datagrams, functional layering, and the end-to-end strategy.
* Eigen (C++ library)
* Esterel, a programming language for State Automata
* Geneauto — code-generation from model
* Graphite, a research platform for computer graphics, 3D modeling and numerical geometry
* Gudhi — A C++ library with Python interface for computational topology and topological data analysis
* Le Lisp, a portable Lisp implementation
* medInria, a medical image processing software, popularly used for MRI images.
* GNU MPFR, an arbitrary-precision floating-point library
* OpenViBE, a software platform dedicated to designing, testing and using brain–computer interfaces.
* Pharo, an open-source Smalltalk derived from Squeak .
* scikit-learn, a machine learning software package
* Scilab, a numerical computation software package
* SimGrid
* SmartEiffel, a free Eiffel compiler
* SOFA, an open source framework for multi-physics simulation with an emphasis on medical simulation.
* TOM, a pattern matching language
* ViSP, an open source visual servoing platform library 
* XtreemFS
* XtreemOS, a grid distributed operating system
* Zenon, an extensible automated theorem prover producing checkable proofs

Inria furthermore leads French AI Research, ranking 12th worldwide in 2019, based on accepted publications at the prestigious Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.
== History ==
During the summer of 1988, the INRIA connected its Sophia-Antipolis unit to the NSFNet via Princeton using a satellite link leased to France Telecom and MCI. The link became operational on 8 August 1988, and allowed INRIA researchers to access the US network and allowed NASA researchers access to an astronomical database based in Strasbourg. This was the first international connection to NSFNET and the first time that French networks were connected directly to a network using TCP/IP, the Internet protocol. The Internet in France was limited to research and education for some years to come.

<doc id="318416" wikidata="Q3374304" url="?curid=318416" title="Cruel and unusual punishment">
<text>Cruel and unusual punishment is a phrase in common law describing punishment that is considered unacceptable due to the suffering, pain, or humiliation it inflicts on the person subjected to the sanction. The precise definition varies by jurisdiction, but typically includes punishments that are arbitrary, unnecessary, or overly severe compared to the crime.

==History==
The words &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; (the actual words were firstly &quot;illegall and cruell Punishments&quot; and secondly &quot;cruell and unusuall Punishments&quot;) were first used in the English Bill of Rights 1689. They were later also adopted in the United States by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution (ratified 1791) and in the British Leeward Islands (1798). Very similar words, &quot;No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&quot;, appear in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948. The right under a different formulation is also found in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (1950) and in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966). The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982) also contains this fundamental right in section 12 and it is to be found in Article 4 (quoting the European Convention verbatim) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000). It is also found in Article 16 of the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1984), and in Article 40 of the Constitution of Poland (1997). The Constitution of the Marshall Islands, in the sixth section of its Bill of Rights (Article 2), prohibits &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot;, which it defines as: the death penalty; torture; &quot;inhuman and degrading treatment&quot;; and &quot;excessive fines or deprivations&quot;.

===United States===
The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that &quot;cruel and unusual punishments [shall not be] inflicted.&quot; The general principles that the United States Supreme Court relied on to decide whether or not a particular punishment was cruel and unusual were determined by Justice William Brennan. In &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, , Justice Brennan concurring wrote, &quot;There are, then, four principles by which we may determine whether a particular punishment is &#x27;cruel and unusual&#x27;.&quot;
* The &quot;essential predicate&quot; is &quot;that a punishment must not by its severity be degrading to human dignity&quot;, especially torture.
* &quot;A severe punishment that is obviously inflicted in wholly arbitrary fashion.&quot; (&quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; temporarily suspended capital punishment for this reason.)
* &quot;A severe punishment that is clearly and totally rejected throughout society.&quot;
* &quot;A severe punishment that is patently unnecessary.&quot;

And he added: &quot;The function of these principles, after all, is simply to provide [the] means by which a court can determine whether [the] challenged punishment comports with human dignity. They are, therefore, interrelated, and, in most cases, it will be their convergence that will justify the conclusion that a punishment is &#x27;cruel and unusual.&#x27; The test, then, will ordinarily be a cumulative one: if a punishment is unusually severe, if there is a strong probability that it is inflicted arbitrarily, if it is substantially rejected by contemporary society, and if there is no reason to believe that it serves any penal purpose more effectively than some less severe punishment, then the continued infliction of that punishment violates the command of the Clause that the State may not inflict inhuman and uncivilized punishments upon those convicted of crimes.&quot;

Continuing, he wrote that he expected that no state would pass a law obviously violating any one of these principles, so court decisions regarding the Eighth Amendment would involve a &quot;cumulative&quot; analysis of the implication of each of the four principles. In this way, the United States Supreme Court &quot;set the standard that a punishment would be cruel and unusual [if] it was too severe for the crime, [if] it was arbitrary, if it offended society&#x27;s sense of justice, or if it was not more effective than a less severe penalty.&quot;

==Capital punishment==
There is much discussion as to whether capital punishment is considered cruel and unusual. Common arguments are that capital punishment is more expensive when factoring in appeals versus life in prison, and that the government has been wrong before on death penalty cases (therefore, the government could be wrong again, and the government ought not have the authority to end a life). These two arguments alone may or may not qualify under the tests the government puts forth, which could also be considered arbitrary itself, especially if society is not informed enough on these considerable facts. For most of recorded history, capital punishments were often deliberately cruel, painful, and/or degrading. Severe historical execution methods include the breaking wheel, hanged, drawn and quartered, mazzatello (beating the head with a mallet or mace), boiling to death, death by burning, execution by drowning, feeding alive to predatory animals, death by starvation, immurement, flaying, disembowelment, crucifixion, impalement, crushing, execution by elephant, keelhauling, stoning, dismemberment, sawing, slow slicing, blood eagle, bamboo torture and necklacing.

In 2008, Michael Portillo on the show &quot;Horizon&quot; argued that in ensuring an execution is not of a cruel and unusual nature, the following criteria must be met:
* Death should be quick and painless to prevent suffering for the person being executed;
* Medical education should be provided to the executioner to prevent suffering caused by error;
* The death should not be gory (to prevent suffering for those carrying out the execution); and
* No co-operation should be required from the person being executed, to prevent inaction, distress, and/or suffering caused by the prisoner being required to participate in their own execution.

It was found that no present-used method could fulfil these criteria and the unethical nature of capital punishment invalidates these principles, but that hypoxia, i.e. through inert gas asphyxiation (a method then not in use) held the most promise. Furthermore, a study conducted by Harold Hillman in 1993 on &quot;possible pain experienced during execution by different methods&quot; reached the conclusion that &quot;[a]ll of the methods used for executing people [including shooting, hanging, stoning, beheading, electrocution, gassing], with the possible exception of intravenous injection, are likely to cause pain&quot;.

<doc id="318418" wikidata="Q1756502" url="?curid=318418" title="Commemorative stamp">
<text>A commemorative stamp is a postage stamp, often issued on a significant date such as an anniversary, to honor or commemorate a place, event, person, or object. The &quot;subject&quot; of the commemorative stamp is usually spelled out in print, unlike definitive stamps which normally depict the subject along with the denomination and country name only. Many postal services issue several commemorative stamps each year, sometimes holding first day of issue ceremonies at locations connected with the subjects. Commemorative stamps can be used alongside ordinary stamps. Unlike definitive stamps that are often reprinted and sold over a prolonged period of time for general usage, commemorative stamps are usually printed in limited quantities and sold for a much shorter period of time, usually, until supplies run out.

== First commemoratives ==

There are several candidates for the title of the first commemorative. A 17-cent stamp issued in 1860 by New Brunswick, showing the Prince of Wales in anticipation of his visit is one possibility. Often cited as the world&#x27;s first commemoratives are the sixteen stamps of the United States Columbian Issue, produced to celebrate the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago honoring the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s arrival in the New World in 1492. (Illustrated here is the $1 stamp from the series: &quot;Isabella pledging her jewels.&quot;)
The United States 15-cent black stamp of 1866 depicts Abraham Lincoln and was the first stamp issued after his assassination in 1865, but it was not officially declared as a memorial to him. The U.S. also issued a 5-cent stamp in 1882 showing the recently assassinated President James A. Garfield. In addition, the United States issued stamped envelopes for the Centennial Exposition in 1876, although technically these are postal stationery and not stamps. The British Jubilee Issue of 1887 may be thought of as commemorative of the 50 years&#x27; reign of Queen Victoria, although there are no special inscriptions on the stamps, and they were intended as regular stamps. In 1870 Peru issued a 5¢ scarlet Locomotive and Arms stamp and is regarded as the first commemorative postage stamp, issued to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the first railway in South America.

Though the United Kingdom often set the precedent for postage stamps and their designs, they were the late runners with the issue of their first commemorative stamp, not issuing one until 1924 when it printed and released the British Empire Exhibition issue of 1924.

Other premier commemorative stamps were issued by New South Wales in 1888 to mark its 100th anniversary; the six types all include the inscription &quot;&quot;. Commemoratives followed in 1891 for Hong Kong and Romania. In 1892 and 1893 a half-dozen nations of America and Spain issued commemorative stamps for the 400th anniversary of the West&#x27;s discovery of America by Christopher Columbus.
== Backlash ==
The appearance of commemorative postage stamps caused a backlash among some stamp collectors in the early years of stamp collecting, who balked at the prospect of laying out ever-larger sums to acquire the stamps of the world. This led to the formation of the Society for the Suppression of Speculative Stamps in 1895 to blacklist these &quot;excessive&quot; stamps. The organization broke up after unsuccessful attempts at getting collectors at large to comply with their wishes. Today early commemoratives are still prized by collectors.

<doc id="318421" wikidata="Q503230" url="?curid=318421" title="Hegesippus (chronicler)">
<text>Hegesippus (Ἅγιος Ἡγήσιππος; c. 110 – c.180 AD), also known as Hegesippus the Nazarene, was a Christian writer of the early Church who, in spite of his Greek name, may have been a Jewish convert and certainly wrote against heresies of the Gnostics and of Marcion. 

== Biography ==

The dates that Hegesippus flourished are insecurely fixed by the statement of Eusebius that the death and apotheosis of Antinous (130) occurred in Hegesippus&#x27; lifetime, and that he came to Rome under Pope Anicetus (Bishop of Rome c. 157–168) and wrote in the time of Pope Eleuterus (pontificate c. 174–189).
Eusebius says that Hegesippus was a convert from Judaism, learned in the Semitic languages and conversant with the oral tradition and customs of the Jews, for he quoted from the Hebrew, was acquainted with the Gospel of the Hebrews and with a Syriac Gospel, and he also cited unwritten traditions of the Jews. Eusebius&#x27; own shaky command of Hebrew and Aramaic, and his lack of personal knowledge of customs of the Jews, were insufficiently founded to judge Hegesippus as a dependable source. He seems to have lived in some part of the East, for, in the time of Pope Anicetus (A.D. 155–166) he travelled through Corinth to reach Rome, collecting on the spot the teachings of the various churches which he visited, and ascertaining their uniformity with Rome, according to this excerpt: 
:&quot;And the Church of the Corinthians remained in the true word until Primus was bishop in Corinth; I made their acquaintance in my journey to Rome, and remained with the Corinthians many days, in which we were refreshed with the true word. And when I was in Rome, I made a succession up to Anicetus, whose deacon was Eleuterus. And in each succession and in each city all is according to the ordinances of the law and the Prophets and the Lord&quot;

== Works ==

Hegesippus&#x27; works are now entirely lost, save eight passages concerning Church history quoted by Eusebius, who tells us that he wrote &quot;Hypomnemata&quot; (Ὑπομνήματα; &quot;Memoirs&quot; or &quot;Memoranda&quot;) in five books, in the simplest style concerning the tradition of the Apostolic preaching. Through Eusebius, Hegesippus was also known to Jerome, who is responsible for the idea that Hegesippus &quot;wrote a history of all ecclesiastical events from the passion of our Lord down to his own period... in five volumes&quot;, which has established the &quot;Hypomnemata&quot; as a Church history. Hegesippus appealed principally to tradition as embodied in the teaching which had been handed down through the succession of bishops, thus providing for Eusebius information about the earliest bishops that otherwise would have been lost. 

J.B. Lightfoot, in &quot;Clement of Rome&quot; (London, 1890), found traces of a list of popes in Epiphanius of Cyprus, (&quot;Haer.&quot;, xxvii, 6) that may also derive from Hegesippus, where that fourth-century writer carelessly says: &quot;Marcellina came to us lately and destroyed many, in the days of Anicetus, Bishop of Rome&quot;, and then refers to &quot;the above catalogue&quot;, though he has given none. He is clearly quoting a writer who was at Rome in the time of Anicetus and made a list of popes A list which has some curious agreements with Epiphanius in that it extends only to Anicetus, is found in the poem of Pseudo-Tertullian against Marcion; apparently Epiphanius has mistaken Marcion for &quot;Marcellina&quot;. The same list is at the base of the earlier part of the Liberian Catalogue, doubtless taken from Hippolytus. Correspondences among the lists of Irenaeus, Africanus, and Eusebius cannot be assumed to have come from the lost list of Hegesippus, as only Eusebius mentions his name. 

Eusebius quotes from Hegesippus fifth and last book a long account of the death of James the Just, &quot;the brother of the Lord&quot;, who was given the obscure Greek epithet &quot;Oblias&quot;, which is supposed to be a Greek transliteration of a Semitic word. Dr. Robert Eisenman connects &quot;Oblias&quot; with &quot;Protector of the people&quot;, as were other &#x27;Zaddikim&#x27;. He also transcribes from Hegesippus the story of the election of his successor Simeon, and the summoning of the descendants of Jude the Apostle to Rome by the Emperor Domitian. A list of heresies against which Hegesippus wrote is also cited. Dr. Lawlor has argued that all these passages cited by Eusebius were connected in the original, and were in the fifth book of Hegesippus. He has also argued the likelihood that Eusebius got from Hegesippus the statement that John the Evangelist was exiled to Patmos by Domitian. Hegesippus mentioned the letter of Pope Clement I to the Corinthians, apparently in connection with the persecution of Domitian. It is very likely that the dating of heretics according to papal reigns in Irenaeus and Epiphanius—e.g., that Marcion&#x27;s disciple Cerdon and Valentinus came to Rome under Anicetus—was derived from Hegesippus, and the same may be true of the assertion that Hermas, author of &quot;The Shepherd of Hermas&quot;, was the brother of Pope Pius I (as the Liberian Catalogue, the poem against Marcion, and the Muratorian fragment all state).

Theodor Zahn has shown that the work of Hegesippus may still have been extant in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in three Eastern libraries, saying: &quot;We must lament the loss of other portions of the &quot;Memoirs&quot; which were known to exist in the seventeenth century.&quot;

<text>Scottish English () is the set of varieties of the English language spoken in Scotland. The transregional, standardised variety is called Scottish Standard English or Standard Scottish English (SSE). Scottish Standard English may be defined as &quot;the characteristic speech of the professional class [in Scotland] and the accepted norm in schools&quot;. IETF language tag for &quot;Scottish Standard English&quot; is en-scotland.

In addition to distinct pronunciation, grammar and expressions, Scottish English has distinctive vocabulary, particularly pertaining to Scottish institutions such as the Church of Scotland, local government and the education and legal systems.

Scottish Standard English is at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum, with focused broad Scots at the other.
Scottish English may be influenced to varying degrees by Scots.
Many Scots speakers separate Scots and Scottish English as different registers depending on social circumstances. Some speakers code switch clearly from one to the other while others style shift in a less predictable and more fluctuating manner.

==Background==
Scottish English resulted from language contact between Scots and the Standard English of England after the 17th century. The resulting shifts to English usage by Scots-speakers resulted in many phonological compromises and lexical transfers, often mistaken for mergers by linguists unfamiliar with the history of Scottish English. Furthermore, the process was also influenced by interdialectal forms, hypercorrections and spelling pronunciations. (See the section on phonology below.)

==History==

Convention traces the influence of the English of England upon Scots to the 16th-century Reformation and to the introduction of printing. Printing arrived in London in 1476, but the first printing press was not introduced to Scotland for another 30 years. Texts such as the Geneva Bible, printed in English, were widely distributed in Scotland in order to spread Protestant doctrine.

King James VI of Scotland became King James I of England in 1603. Since England was the larger and richer of the two Kingdoms, James moved his court to London in England. The poets of the court therefore moved south and &quot;began adapting the language and style of their verse to the tastes of the English market&quot;. To this event McClure attributes &quot;the sudden and total eclipse of Scots as a literary language&quot;. The continuing absence of a Scots translation of the Bible meant that the translation of King James into English was used in worship in both countries.

The Acts of Union 1707 amalgamated the Scottish and English Parliaments. However the church, educational and legal structures remained separate. This leads to important professional distinctions in the definitions of some words and terms. There are therefore words with precise definitions in Scottish English which are either not used in English English or have a different definition.
==Phonology==


The speech of the middle classes in Scotland tends to conform to the grammatical norms of the written standard, particularly in situations that are regarded as formal. Highland English is slightly different from the variety spoken in the Lowlands in that it is more phonologically, grammatically, and lexically influenced by a Gaelic substratum. Similarly, the English spoken in the North-East of Scotland tends to follow the phonology and grammar of Doric.

Although pronunciation features vary among speakers (depending on region and social status), there are a number of phonological aspects characteristic of Scottish English:

* Scottish English is mostly rhotic, meaning is typically pronounced in the syllable coda, although some non-rhotic varieties are present in Edinburgh and Glasgow. The phoneme may be a postalveolar approximant , as in Received Pronunciation or General American, but speakers have also traditionally used for the same phoneme a somewhat more common alveolar flap or, now very rare, the alveolar trill (hereafter, will be used to denote any rhotic consonant).
**Although other dialects have merged non-intervocalic , , before (fern–fir–fur merger), Scottish English makes a distinction between the vowels in &quot;fern&quot;, &quot;fir&quot;, and &quot;fur&quot;.
**Many varieties contrast and before so that &quot;hoarse&quot; and &quot;horse&quot; are pronounced differently.
** and are contrasted so that &quot;shore&quot; and &quot;sure&quot; are pronounced differently, as are &quot;pour&quot; and &quot;poor&quot;.
** before is strong. An epenthetic vowel may occur between and so that &quot;girl&quot; and &quot;world&quot; are two-syllable words for some speakers. The same may occur between and , between and , and between and .
*There is a distinction between and in word pairs such as &quot;witch&quot; and &quot;which&quot;.
*The phoneme is common in names and in SSE&#x27;s many Gaelic and Scots borrowings, so much so that it is often taught to incomers, particularly for &quot;ch&quot; in loch. Some Scottish speakers use it in words of Greek origin as well, such as technical, patriarch, etc. (Wells 1982, 408). 
* is usually velarised (see dark l) except in borrowings like &quot;glen&quot; (from Scottish Gaelic &quot;gleann&quot;), which had an unvelarised l in their original form. In areas where Scottish Gaelic was spoken until relatively recently (such as Dumfries and Galloway) and in areas where it is still spoken (such as the West Highlands), velarisation of may be absent in many words in which it is present in other areas, but remains in borrowings that had velarised in Gaelic, such as &quot;loch&quot; (Gaelic &quot;loch&quot;) and &quot;clan&quot; (Gaelic &quot;clann&quot;).
*, and are not aspirated in more traditional varieties, but are weakly aspirated currently.
*The past ending &quot;-ed&quot; may be realised with where other accents use , chiefly after unstressed vowels: &quot;ended&quot; , &quot;carried&quot; 
*The Scottish Vowel Length Rule is a distinctive part of many varieties of Scottish English (Scobbie et al. 1999), though vowel length is generally regarded as non-phonemic. According to the Rule, certain vowels (such as , , and ) are generally short but are lengthened before voiced fricatives or before . Lengthening also occurs before a morpheme boundary, so that short &quot;need&quot; contrasts with long &quot;kneed&quot;, &quot;crude&quot; with &quot;crewed&quot;, and &quot;side&quot; with &quot;sighed&quot;.
*Scottish English has no , instead transferring Scots . Phonetically, this vowel may be pronounced or even . Thus &quot;pull&quot; and &quot;pool&quot; are homophones.
*&quot;Cot&quot; and &quot;caught&quot; are not differentiated in most Central Scottish varieties, as they are in some other varieties.
*In most varieties, there is no - distinction; therefore, &quot;bath&quot;, &quot;trap&quot;, and &quot;palm&quot; have the same vowel.
*The &quot;happY&quot; vowel is most commonly (as in &quot;face&quot;), but may also be (as in &quot;kit&quot;) or (as in &quot;fleece&quot;).
* is often used in plural nouns where southern English has (baths, youths, etc.); &quot;with&quot; and &quot;booth&quot; are pronounced with . (See Pronunciation of English th.)
*In colloquial speech, the glottal stop may be an allophone of after a vowel, as in . These same speakers may &quot;drop the g&quot; in the suffix &quot;-ing&quot; and debuccalise to in certain contexts.
* may be more open for certain speakers in some regions, so that it sounds more like (although and do not merge). Other speakers may pronounce it as , just as in many other accents, or with a schwa-like () quality. Others may pronounce it almost as in certain environments, particularly after and .

==Scotticisms==
Scotticisms are idioms or expressions that are characteristic of Scots, especially when used in English. They are more likely to occur in spoken than written language.

The use of Scottish English, as well as of Scots and of Gaelic in Scotland, were documented over the 20th century by the Linguistic Survey of Scotland at the University of Edinburgh.

Scotticisms are generally divided into two types: covert Scotticisms, which generally go unnoticed as being particularly Scottish by those using them, and overt Scotticisms, usually used for stylistic effect, with those using them aware of their Scottish nature.

===Lexical===

Scottish English has inherited a number of lexical items from Scots, which are less common in other forms of standard English.

General items are , the Scots word for small (also common in Canadian English, New Zealand English and Hiberno-English probably under Scottish influence); or for child (the latter from Common Germanic, cf modern Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic, Faroese , West Frisian &quot;bern&quot; and also used in Northern English dialects); &quot;bonnie&quot; for pretty, attractive, (or good looking, handsome, as in the case of Bonnie Prince Charlie); &quot;braw&quot; for fine; &quot;muckle&quot; for big; &quot;spail or skelf&quot; for splinter (cf. spall); &quot;snib&quot; for bolt; &quot;pinkie&quot; for little finger; &quot;janitor&quot; for school caretaker (these last two are also standard in American English); &quot;outwith&quot;, meaning &#x27;outside of&#x27;; &quot;cowp&quot; for tip or spill; &quot;fankle&quot; for a tangled mess; &quot;kirk&quot; for &#x27;church&#x27; (from the same root in Old English but with parallels in other Germanic languages, e.g. Old Norse , Dutch ). Examples of culturally specific items are &quot;Hogmanay&quot;, &quot;caber&quot;, &quot;haggis&quot;, &quot;bothy&quot;, &quot;scone&quot; (also used elsewhere in the British Isles), &quot;oatcake&quot; (now widespread in the UK), &quot;tablet&quot;, &quot;rone&quot; (roof gutter), &quot;teuchter&quot;, &quot;ned&quot;, &quot;numpty&quot; (witless person; now more common in the rest of the UK) and &quot;landward&quot; (rural); &quot;It&#x27;s your shot&quot; for &quot;It&#x27;s your turn&quot;; and the once notorious but now obsolete &quot;tawse&quot;.

The diminutive ending &quot;-ie&quot; is added to nouns to indicate smallness, as in &quot;laddie&quot; and &quot;lassie&quot; for a young boy and young girl. Other examples are &quot;peirie&quot; (child&#x27;s wooden spinning top) and &quot;sweetie&quot; (piece of confectionery). The ending can be added to many words instinctively, e.g. &quot;bairn&quot; (see above) can become &quot;bairnie&quot;, a small shop can become a &quot;wee shoppie&quot;. These diminutives are particularly common among the older generations and when talking to children.

The use of &quot;How?&quot; meaning &quot;Why?&quot; is distinctive of Scottish, Northern English and Northern Irish English. &quot;Why not?&quot; is often rendered as &quot;How no?&quot;.

There is a range of (often anglicised) legal and administrative vocabulary inherited from Scots, e.g. &quot;depute&quot; for &quot;deputy&quot;, &quot;proven&quot; for &quot;proved&quot; (standard in American English), &quot;interdict&quot; for &#x27;&quot;injunction&quot;, and &quot;sheriff-substitute&quot; for &quot;acting sheriff&quot;. In Scottish education a &quot;short leet&quot; is a list of selected job applicants, and a &quot;remit&quot; is a detailed job description. &quot;Provost&quot; is used for &quot;mayor&quot; and &quot;procurator fiscal&quot; for &quot;public prosecutor&quot;.

Often, lexical differences between Scottish English and Southern Standard English are simply differences in the distribution of shared lexis, such as &quot;stay&quot; for &quot;live&quot; (as in: &quot;where do you stay?&quot;).

===Grammatical===
The progressive verb forms are used rather more frequently than in other varieties of standard English, for example with some stative verbs (). The future progressive frequently implies an assumption ().

In some areas perfect aspect of a verb is indicated using &quot;be&quot; as auxiliary with the preposition &quot;after&quot; and the present participle: for example &quot;He is after going&quot; instead of &quot;He has gone&quot; (this construction is borrowed from Scottish Gaelic).

The definite article tends to be used more frequently in phrases such as &quot;I&#x27;ve got the cold/the flu&quot;, &quot;he&#x27;s at the school&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m away to the kirk&quot;.

Speakers often use prepositions differently. The compound preposition &quot;off of&quot; is often used (&quot;Take that off of the table&quot;). Scots commonly say &quot;I was waiting on you&quot; (meaning &quot;waiting for you&quot;), which means something quite different in Standard English.

In colloquial speech &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;ought&quot; are scarce, &quot;must&quot; is marginal for obligation and &quot;may&quot; is rare. Here are other syntactical structures:

* &quot;My hair is needing washed&quot; or &quot;My hair needs washed&quot; for &quot;My hair needs washing&quot; or &quot;My hair needs to be washed&quot;.
* &quot;Amn&#x27;t I invited?&quot; for &quot;Am I not invited?&quot;

In Scottish English, the first person declarative &quot;I amn&#x27;t invited&quot; and interrogative &quot;Amn&#x27;t I invited?&quot; are both possible.

<text>Text mining, text data mining (TDM) or text analytics is the process of deriving high-quality information from text. It involves &quot;the discovery by computer of new, previously unknown information, by automatically extracting information from different written resources.&quot; Written resources may include websites, books, emails, reviews, and articles. High-quality information is typically obtained by devising patterns and trends by means such as statistical pattern learning. According to Hotho et al. (2005), there are three perspectives of text mining: information extraction, data mining, and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing, along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others, and subsequent insertion into a database), deriving patterns within the structured data, and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. &#x27;High quality&#x27; in text mining usually refers to some combination of relevance, novelty, and interest. Typical text mining tasks include text categorization, text clustering, concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, sentiment analysis, document summarization, and entity relation modeling (&quot;i.e.&quot;, learning relations between named entities).

Text analysis involves information retrieval, lexical analysis to study word frequency distributions, pattern recognition, tagging/annotation, information extraction, data mining techniques including link and association analysis, visualization, and predictive analytics. The overarching goal is, essentially, to turn text into data for analysis, via the application of natural language processing (NLP), different types of algorithms and analytical methods. An important phase of this process is the interpretation of the gathered information.

A typical application is to scan a set of documents written in a natural language and either model the document set for predictive classification purposes or populate a database or search index with the information extracted. The document is the basic element when starting with text mining. Here, we define a document as a unit of textual data, which normally exists in many types of collections.

== Text analytics ==

Text analytics describes a set of linguistic, statistical, and machine learning techniques that model and structure the information content of textual sources for business intelligence, exploratory data analysis, research, or investigation. The term is roughly synonymous with text mining; indeed, Ronen Feldman modified a 2000 description of &quot;text mining&quot; in 2004 to describe &quot;text analytics&quot;. The latter term is now used more frequently in business settings while &quot;text mining&quot; is used in some of the earliest application areas, dating to the 1980s, notably life-sciences research and government intelligence.

The term text analytics also describes that application of text analytics to respond to business problems, whether independently or in conjunction with query and analysis of fielded, numerical data. It is a truism that 80% of business-relevant information originates in unstructured form, primarily text. These techniques and processes discover and present knowledge – facts, business rules, and relationships – that is otherwise locked in textual form, impenetrable to automated processing.

== Text analysis processes ==
Subtasks—components of a larger text-analytics effort—typically include:

* Dimensionality reduction is an important technique for pre-processing data. It is used to identify the root word for actual words and reduce the size of the text data.
* Information retrieval or identification of a corpus is a preparatory step: collecting or identifying a set of textual materials, on the Web or held in a file system, database, or content corpus manager, for analysis.
* Although some text analytics systems apply exclusively advanced statistical methods, many others apply more extensive natural language processing, such as part of speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and other types of linguistic analysis.
* Named entity recognition is the use of gazetteers or statistical techniques to identify named text features: people, organizations, place names, stock ticker symbols, certain abbreviations, and so on.
* Disambiguation—the use of contextual clues—may be required to decide where, for instance, &quot;Ford&quot; can refer to a former U.S. president, a vehicle manufacturer, a movie star, a river crossing, or some other entity.
* Recognition of pattern-identified entities: Features such as telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, quantities (with units) can be discerned via regular expression or other pattern matches.
*Document clustering: identification of sets of similar text documents.
* Coreference resolution: identification of noun phrases and other terms that refer to the same object.
* Extraction of relationships, facts and events: identification of associations among entities and other information in texts.
* Sentiment analysis: discerning of subjective material and extracting information about attitudes: sentiment, opinion, mood, and emotion. This is done at the entity, concept, or topic level and aims to distinguish opinion holders and objects.
* Quantitative text analysis: a set of techniques stemming from the social sciences where either a human judge or a computer extracts semantic or grammatical relationships between words in order to find out the meaning or stylistic patterns of, usually, a casual personal text for the purpose of psychological profiling etc.
* Pre-processing usually involves tasks such as tokenization, filtering and stemming.

== Applications ==
Text mining technology is now broadly applied to a wide variety of government, research, and business needs. All these groups may use text mining for records management and searching documents relevant to their daily activities. Legal professionals may use text mining for e-discovery, for example. Governments and military groups use text mining for national security and intelligence purposes. Scientific researchers incorporate text mining approaches into efforts to organize large sets of text data (i.e., addressing the problem of unstructured data), to determine ideas communicated through text (e.g., sentiment analysis in social media) and to support scientific discovery in fields such as the life sciences and bioinformatics. In business, applications are used to support competitive intelligence and automated ad placement, among numerous other activities.

=== Security applications ===
Many text mining software packages are marketed for security applications, especially monitoring and analysis of online plain text sources such as Internet news, blogs, etc. for national security purposes. It is also involved in the study of text encryption/decryption.

=== Biomedical applications ===
A range of text mining applications in the biomedical literature has been described, including computational approaches to assist with studies in protein docking, protein interactions, and protein-disease associations. In addition, with large patient textual datasets in the clinical field, datasets of demographic information in population studies and adverse event reports, text mining can facilitate clinical studies and precision medicine. Text mining algorithms can facilitate the stratification and indexing of specific clinical events in large patient textual datasets of symptoms, side effects, and comorbidities from electronic health records, event reports, and reports from specific diagnostic tests. One online text mining application in the biomedical literature is PubGene, a publicly accessible search engine that combines biomedical text mining with network visualization. GoPubMed is a knowledge-based search engine for biomedical texts. Text mining techniques also enable us to extract unknown knowledge from unstructured documents in the clinical domain

=== Software applications ===
Text mining methods and software is also being researched and developed by major firms, including IBM and Microsoft, to further automate the mining and analysis processes, and by different firms working in the area of search and indexing in general as a way to improve their results. Within the public sector, much effort has been concentrated on creating software for tracking and monitoring terrorist activities. For study purposes, Weka software is one of the most popular options in the scientific world, acting as an excellent entry point for beginners. For Python programmers, there is an excellent toolkit called NLTK for more general purposes. For more advanced programmers, there&#x27;s also the Gensim library, which focuses on word embedding-based text representations.

=== Online media applications ===
Text mining is being used by large media companies, such as the Tribune Company, to clarify information and to provide readers with greater search experiences, which in turn increases site &quot;stickiness&quot; and revenue. Additionally, on the back end, editors are benefiting by being able to share, associate and package news across properties, significantly increasing opportunities to monetize content.

=== Business and marketing applications ===
Text analytics is being used in business, particularly, in marketing, such as in customer relationship management. Coussement and Van den Poel (2008)&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; apply it to improve predictive analytics models for customer churn (customer attrition). Text mining is also being applied in stock returns prediction.

=== Sentiment analysis ===
Sentiment analysis may involve analysis of products such as movies, books, or hotel reviews for estimating how favorable a review is for the product.
Such an analysis may need a labeled data set or labeling of the affectivity of words.
Resources for affectivity of words and concepts have been made for WordNet and ConceptNet, respectively.

Text has been used to detect emotions in the related area of affective computing. Text based approaches to affective computing have been used on multiple corpora such as students evaluations, children stories and news stories.

=== Scientific literature mining and academic applications ===
The issue of text mining is of importance to publishers who hold large databases of information needing indexing for retrieval. This is especially true in scientific disciplines, in which highly specific information is often contained within the written text. Therefore, initiatives have been taken such as Nature&#x27;s proposal for an Open Text Mining Interface (OTMI) and the National Institutes of Health&#x27;s common Journal Publishing Document Type Definition (DTD) that would provide semantic cues to machines to answer specific queries contained within the text without removing publisher barriers to public access.

Academic institutions have also become involved in the text mining initiative:

* The National Centre for Text Mining (NaCTeM), is the first publicly funded text mining centre in the world. NaCTeM is operated by the University of Manchester in close collaboration with the Tsujii Lab, University of Tokyo. NaCTeM provides customised tools, research facilities and offers advice to the academic community. They are funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and two of the UK research councils (EPSRC &amp; BBSRC). With an initial focus on text mining in the biological and biomedical sciences, research has since expanded into the areas of social sciences.
* In the United States, the School of Information at University of California, Berkeley is developing a program called BioText to assist biology researchers in text mining and analysis.
* The Text Analysis Portal for Research (TAPoR), currently housed at the University of Alberta, is a scholarly project to catalogue text analysis applications and create a gateway for researchers new to the practice.

==== Methods for scientific literature mining ====
Computational methods have been developed to assist with information retrieval from scientific literature. Published approaches include methods for searching, determining novelty, and clarifying homonyms among technical reports.

=== Digital humanities and computational sociology ===
The automatic analysis of vast textual corpora has created the possibility for scholars to analyze
millions of documents in multiple languages with very limited manual intervention. Key enabling technologies have been parsing, machine translation, topic categorization, and machine learning.
The automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, turning textual data into network data. The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analyzed by using tools from network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes. This automates the approach introduced by quantitative narrative analysis, whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.

Content analysis has been a traditional part of social sciences and media studies for a long time. The automation of content analysis has allowed a &quot;big data&quot; revolution to take place in that field, with studies in social media and newspaper content that include millions of news items. Gender bias, readability, content similarity, reader preferences, and even mood have been analyzed based on text mining methods over millions of documents. The analysis of readability, gender bias and topic bias was demonstrated in Flaounas et al. showing how different topics have different gender biases and levels of readability; the possibility to detect mood patterns in a vast population by analyzing Twitter content was demonstrated as well.

== Software ==

Text mining computer programs are available from many commercial and open source companies and sources.

== Intellectual property law ==

=== Situation in Europe ===

Under European copyright and database laws, the mining of in-copyright works (such as by web mining) without the permission of the copyright owner is illegal. In the UK in 2014, on the recommendation of the Hargreaves review, the government amended copyright law to allow text mining as a limitation and exception. It was the second country in the world to do so, following Japan, which introduced a mining-specific exception in 2009. However, owing to the restriction of the Information Society Directive (2001), the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions.

The European Commission facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013, under the title of Licenses for Europe. The fact that the focus on the solution to this legal issue was licenses, and not limitations and exceptions to copyright law, led representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and open access publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013.

=== Situation in the United States ===
US copyright law, and in particular its fair use provisions, means that text mining in America, as well as other fair use countries such as Israel, Taiwan and South Korea, is viewed as being legal. As text mining is transformative, meaning that it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the Google Book settlement the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google&#x27;s digitization project of in-copyright books was lawful, in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed—one such use being text and data mining.

=== Situation in Australia ===
There is no exception in copyright law of Australia for text or data mining within the &quot;Copyright Act 1968&quot;. The Australian Law Reform Commission has noted that it is unlikely that the &quot;research and study&quot; fair dealing exception would extend to cover such a topic either, given it would be beyond the &quot;reasonable portion&quot; requirement.

== Implications ==
Until recently, websites most often used text-based searches, which only found documents containing specific user-defined words or phrases. Now, through use of a semantic web, text mining can find content based on meaning and context (rather than just by a specific word). Additionally, text mining software can be used to build large dossiers of information about specific people and events. For example, large datasets based on data extracted from news reports can be built to facilitate social networks analysis or counter-intelligence. In effect, the text mining software may act in a capacity similar to an intelligence analyst or research librarian, albeit with a more limited scope of analysis. Text mining is also used in some email spam filters as a way of determining the characteristics of messages that are likely to be advertisements or other unwanted material. Text mining plays an important role in determining financial market sentiment.

<text>Lorin Varencove Maazel (; March 6, 1930 – July 13, 2014) was an American conductor, violinist and composer. He began conducting at the age of eight and by 1953 had decided to pursue a career in music. He had established a reputation in the concert halls of Europe by 1960 but his career in the U.S. progressed far more slowly. He served as music director of The Cleveland Orchestra, Orchestre National de France, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the New York Philharmonic, among other posts. Maazel was well regarded in baton technique and had a photographic memory for scores. Described as mercurial and forbidding in rehearsal, he mellowed in old age.

==Early life==
Maazel was born to American parents of Russian Jewish origin in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France.

His grandfather Isaac Maazel (1873–1925), born in Poltava, Ukraine, then in the Russian Empire, was a violinist in the Metropolitan Opera orchestra. He and his wife Esther Glazer (1879–1921), originally from Kharkiv, Ukraine, then in the Russian Empire, came to North America in 1900 after the birth of their eldest son Marvin (1899–1988), who later became a pianist and composer.

Maazel was brought up in the United States, primarily at his parents&#x27; home in the city of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Oakland neighborhood. His father, Lincoln Maazel (1903–2009), was a singer, teacher of voice and piano, and an actor (he co-starred in George A. Romero&#x27;s 1978 horror movie &quot;Martin&quot;); and his mother, Marion &quot;Marie&quot; Shulman Maazel (1894–1992), founded the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony Orchestra.

Maazel was a child prodigy and had perfect pitch.
He had his first conducting lesson at age seven with Vladimir Bakaleinikov, making his debut at age eight, conducting the University of Idaho Orchestra in Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished&quot; Symphony in Los Angeles in 1938. In the same year, he conducted the National High School Orchestra at the National Music Camp in Interlochen, Michigan. The following year, he conducted 11 concerts by the same orchestra at the New York World’s Fair. At the age of eleven, he guest-conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra on the radio. At twelve he toured the United States to conduct major orchestras. By 1943 he emerged as the conductor of the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra at New York City&#x27;s Lewisohn Stadium performing César Franck&#x27;s Symphony in D minor. He made his violin debut at the age of fifteen. He attended the Fanny Edel Falk Laboratory School at the University of Pittsburgh as a child, followed by Peabody High School and the University of Pittsburgh. Maazel studied briefly with Pierre Monteux in 1945.
==Early career==
In the early 1950s, Maazel toured as the conductor with the Gershwin Concert Orchestra. The orchestra consisted of 25 members and a noted array of soloists. The orchestra was organized in cooperation with Ira Gershwin, to give the public a comprehensive Gershwin program. The list of soloists included George Gershwin&#x27;s friend, Jesús María Sanromá, Carolyn Long and Theodor Uppman.

In 1960, Maazel became the first American to conduct at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. He was chief conductor of the Deutsche Oper Berlin from 1965 to 1971 and the Radio-Symphonie-Orchester (RSO) Berlin from 1964 to 1975.

== Tenure in Cleveland ==

At the age of 13, Lorin Maazel was introduced to the citizens of Cleveland in a pension fund concert at Public Hall on March 14, 1943. He conducted a selection of pieces that included the overture from Wagner’s opera &quot;Rienzi&quot; and Schubert’s “Unfinished” symphony, and his orchestra featured 14-year-old prodigy Patricia Travers on violin. Earlier in his young career, Maazel had already guest conducted the NBC Symphony, New York Philharmonic, Los Angeles Philharmonic, and Pittsburgh Symphony. It was Artur Rodziński, in the midst of defending his decision to leave Cleveland for a post with the New York Philharmonic, who half-jokingly stated: “Look [Maazel] over, he may be your next conductor.&quot; However, it would be nearly thirty years before Maazel would become music director of The Cleveland Orchestra, succeeding George Szell in 1972.

In the wake of Szell’s crisp, chamber-like style, many critics fretted over Maazel’s emotional interpretations. Shortly after Maazel was named to the post in Cleveland, though, his status was buoyed by both an endorsement from Philadelphia Orchestra music director Eugene Ormandy and the promise of a recording contract with Decca Records. In addition, Maazel chose to revitalize the Orchestra’s educational outreach programs for the city’s schoolchildren. He envisioned an annual concert at Public Hall where the chorus would be made up of area students. This project launched on May 19, 1973, with a program that included music from Gershwin’s opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, Copland’s &quot;A Lincoln Portrait&quot;, and an English-language version of the “Ode to Joy” from Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. With more than 5,000 people in attendance, the concert provided a capstone to Maazel’s first season in Cleveland.

A month later, the Orchestra completed its first recording in three years — Prokofiev’s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for Decca. The ensemble also returned to international touring during the 1973-74 season with a first-ever visit to Australia and New Zealand. Because of a tightly-packed schedule, conducting duties were split between Maazel, Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, and former music director Erich Leinsdorf. The season, which also featured performances of Strauss’s one-act opera &quot;Elektra&quot; at Cleveland’s Severance Hall and New York’s Carnegie Hall, closed with a dozen concerts across Japan.

In 1974-75, Maazel led the Orchestra on a tour of South America and Central America. He also conducted the ensemble’s recording of Gershwin’s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; — the Orchestra’s first recording of an opera and Decca’s first opera recording in the United States. Three years later, on December 10, 1978, he guided the Orchestra’s 60th anniversary concert, which included Victor Herbert’s &quot;American Fantasy&quot; — also played during the ensemble’s debut concert on December 11, 1918.

The following fall, however, rumors began to swirl that Maazel was the top candidate for the directorship of the Vienna State Opera. Although the appointment was still several years away, arrangements were made to have Maazel conduct The Cleveland Orchestra through the 1981-82 season before departing for Europe. During the final years of Maazel’s tenure in Cleveland, the Musical Arts Association launched a concert to honor the life and works of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., which would become an annual tradition, and the Orchestra hosted a 50th anniversary celebration for Severance Hall featuring the same program as the ensemble played on the concert hall’s opening night in 1931 — Bach’s &quot;Passacaglia in C Minor&quot;, Charles Martin Loeffler’s &quot;Invocation&quot;, Brahms’s First Symphony, and selections from Beethoven’s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;.

Across Maazel’s final season with The Cleveland Orchestra, he would conduct only seven of the season’s subscription series concerts. His last performance at Severance Hall, on May 15, 1982, included a presentation of Verdi’s &quot;Requiem&quot;, which he also brought on tour the following week to Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, and Woolsey Hall at Yale University. The Verdi had been Maazel’s debut piece in New York with The Cleveland Orchestra at the start of his tenure in 1972.

== Later years ==
In 1977, he became music director of the Orchestre National de France in Paris, a position he held until 1991.
From 1982 to 1984, Maazel served at the Vienna State Opera as general manager and principal conductor. In 1980, he succeeded Willi Boskovsky as conductor at the Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concert and he led this televised annual event each year, until 1986. He returned to it four times: in 1994, 1996, 1999 and 2005.

From 1984 to 1988, Maazel was the music consultant to the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and its music director from 1988 to 1996.

In 1989, expecting to become successor to Herbert von Karajan as chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, Maazel suddenly and publicly severed all connections with the orchestra when it was announced that Claudio Abbado was to take over. He claimed that his decision was because he was concerned for the orchestra&#x27;s well-being.

From 1993 until 2002, he was chief conductor of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in Munich.

In 2000, Maazel made a guest-conducting appearance with the New York Philharmonic in two weeks of subscription concerts after an absence of over twenty years, which met with positive reaction from the orchestra musicians. This engagement led to his appointment in January 2001 as the orchestra&#x27;s next music director, starting in 2002, succeeding Kurt Masur. Maazel conducted the New York Philharmonic on their landmark visit to Pyongyang, North Korea on February 26, 2008. He led the orchestra in renditions of the North Korean and United States national anthems, Dvořák&#x27;s New World Symphony, George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;An American in Paris&quot;, and closed with the traditional Korean folk song &quot;Arirang&quot;. Maazel stepped down from the New York Philharmonic after the 2008/09 season.

In 2004, Maazel became the music director of the Arturo Toscanini Philharmonic. From September 2006 till March 2011, he was the musical director of the Orquestra de la Comunitat Valenciana, the house orchestra of the opera house Palau de les Arts, Valencia, Spain. His last concert there as Music Director took place on his 81st birthday on March 6, 2011, conducting his only opera &quot;1984&quot;. In March 2010, Maazel was named chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic, effective with the 2012/13 season. Early in 2014, Maazel cancelled concert engagements as a result of ill health. Subsequently, in June 2014, he announced his resignation as music director of the Munich Philharmonic, effective immediately.
Maazel conducted the music for three operatic films, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (1979), &quot;Carmen&quot; (1984) and &quot;Otello&quot; (1986). His own compositions included a poorly reviewed opera, &quot;1984&quot;, based on the George Orwell novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and a humorous work for orchestra, flute and narrator which he composed for James Galway: &quot;Irish Vapors and Capers&quot;. He was depicted conducting Vienna&#x27;s New Year concert on an Austrian postage stamp issued in 2005. Maazel and his wife, Dietlinde Turban together operated a summer music festival called Castleton Festival at their Castleton, Virginia estate, Castleton Farms. Maazel arranged Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; into a 70-minute suite, &quot;The &#x27;Ring&#x27; Without Words&quot;, which he recorded in 1987 with the Berlin Philharmonic.

== Death ==
Maazel died on July 13, 2014, at his Castleton Farms estate in Virginia, from complications of pneumonia.

==Honors==

Maazel&#x27;s catalogue contained over 300 recordings of works by Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, Mozart, Schubert, Richard Strauss and others. He earned 10 Grand Prix du Disque awards.

Maazel was a Commander of the Légion d&#x27;honneur of the French Republic and of the Finnish Order of the Lion. He was decorated with the Bundesverdienstkreuz of the Federal Republic of Germany. On 27 May 2013, he received an honorary membership of the Vienna State Opera and the &quot;Großes Goldenes Ehrenzeichen&quot; of Austria.

Maazel received the Italian Premio Abbiati and was an Honorary Life Member of the Israel Philharmonic. In addition, he was a Kentucky Colonel.

<text>Fernando Buesa Blanco (29 May 1946 – 22 February 2000) was a Spanish politician in the Basque Christian Democracy and in the Socialist Party of the Basque Country–Basque Country Left (PSE-EE) branch of the social democratic Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE). He was assassinated by ETA.

==Biography==
Born in 1946 in Bilbao, Spain, Buesa studied law in Madrid and Barcelona and practiced from 1970 to 1986 in Vitoria-Gasteiz. He served in the Vitoria-Gasteiz city council from 1983 to 1997, in the Basque Parliament from 1984 to 2000 and as Deputy General of Álava from 1987 to 1991. Buesa was also vice &quot;lehendakari&quot; (president of the Basque government) and minister of Education in a coalition PSE-Basque Nationalist Party Basque government from 1991 to 1994.

From this position, he steered the process that moved the Basque-language schools (&quot;ikastolak&quot;) into either the Basque public education network or the Basque chartered private education sector.

Fernando Buesa was married and had three children.

==Death and legacy==

On February 22, 2000, Buesa was killed by the separatist group ETA while he was walking through the university campus in Vitoria-Gasteiz. The car bombing also killed his bodyguard, the &quot;ertzaina&quot; (member of the Basque police) Jorge Díez Elorza.

At the time of his death, Buesa was the leader of the PSE-EE in Álava and the PSE-EE spokesman in the Basque Parliament.

His assassination inspired a well received documentary by the Basque filmmaker titled &quot;&quot;.

The home arena of the Vitoria-Gasteiz Baskonia basketball team, formerly known as &quot;Araba Arena&quot;, was renamed Fernando Buesa Arena after his death.

<doc id="318450" wikidata="Q76410" url="?curid=318450" title="Leopold Kronecker">
<text>Leopold Kronecker (; 7 December 1823 – 29 December 1891) was a German mathematician who worked on number theory, abstract algebra and logic, and criticized Georg Cantor&#x27;s work on set theory. Heinrich Weber quoted Kronecker
as having said, &quot;&quot; (&quot;God made the integers, all else is the work of man&quot;).
Kronecker was a student and life-long friend of Ernst Kummer.

==Biography==
Leopold Kronecker was born on 7 December 1823 in Liegnitz, Prussia (now Legnica, Poland) in a wealthy Jewish family. His parents, Isidor and Johanna (née Prausnitzep), took care of their children&#x27;s education and provided them with private tutoring at home—Leopold&#x27;s younger brother Hugo Kronecker would also follow a scientific path, later becoming a notable physiologist. Kronecker then went to the Liegnitz Gymnasium where he was interested in a wide range of topics including science, history and philosophy, while also practicing gymnastics and swimming. At the gymnasium he was taught by Ernst Kummer, who noticed and encouraged the boy&#x27;s interest in mathematics.

In 1841 Kronecker became a student at the University of Berlin where his interest did not immediately focus on mathematics, but rather spread over several subjects including astronomy and philosophy. He spent the summer of 1843 at the University of Bonn studying astronomy and 1843–44 at the University of Breslau following his former teacher Kummer. Back in Berlin, Kronecker studied mathematics with Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and in 1845 defended his dissertation in algebraic number theory written under Dirichlet&#x27;s supervision.

After obtaining his degree, Kronecker did not follow his interest in research on an academic career path. He went back to his hometown to manage a large farming estate built up by his mother&#x27;s uncle, a former banker. In 1848 he married his cousin Fanny Prausnitzer, and the couple had six children. For several years Kronecker focused on business, and although he continued to study mathematics as a hobby and corresponded with Kummer, he published no mathematical results. In 1853 he wrote a memoir on the algebraic solvability of equations extending the work of Évariste Galois on the theory of equations.
Due to his business activity, Kronecker was financially comfortable, and thus he could return to Berlin in 1855 to pursue mathematics as a private scholar. Dirichlet, whose wife Rebecka came from the wealthy Mendelssohn family, had introduced Kronecker to the Berlin elite. He became a close friend of Karl Weierstrass, who had recently joined the university, and his former teacher Kummer who had just taken over Dirichlet&#x27;s mathematics chair. Over the following years Kronecker published numerous papers resulting from his previous years&#x27; independent research. As a result of this published research, he was elected a member of the Berlin Academy in 1861.

Although he held no official university position, Kronecker had the right as a member of the Academy to hold classes at the University of Berlin and he decided to do so, starting in 1862. In 1866, when Riemann died, Kronecker was offered the mathematics chair at the University of Göttingen (previously held by Carl Friedrich Gauss and Dirichlet), but he refused, preferring to keep his position at the Academy. Only in 1883, when Kummer retired from the university, was Kronecker invited to succeed him and became an ordinary professor. Kronecker was the supervisor of Kurt Hensel, Adolf Kneser, Mathias Lerch, and Franz Mertens, amongst others.

His philosophical view of mathematics put him in conflict with several mathematicians over the years, notably straining his relationship with Weierstrass, who almost decided to leave the university in 1888. Kronecker died on 29 December 1891 in Berlin, several months after the death of his wife. In the last year of his life, he converted to Christianity. He is buried in the Alter St Matthäus Kirchhof cemetery in Berlin-Schöneberg, close to Gustav Kirchhoff.

==Scientific activity==

===Mathematics research===
An important part of Kronecker&#x27;s research focused on number theory and algebra. In an 1853 paper on the theory of equations and Galois theory he formulated the Kronecker–Weber theorem, without however offering a definitive proof (the theorem was proved completely much later by David Hilbert). He also introduced the structure theorem for finitely-generated abelian groups. Kronecker studied elliptic functions and conjectured his &quot;liebster Jugendtraum&quot; (&quot;dearest dream of youth&quot;), a generalization that was later put forward by Hilbert in a modified form as his twelfth problem. In an 1850 paper, &quot;On the Solution of the General Equation of the Fifth Degree&quot;, Kronecker solved the quintic equation by applying group theory (though his solution was not in terms of radicals: that was already proven impossible by the Abel–Ruffini theorem).

In algebraic number theory Kronecker introduced the theory of divisors as an alternative to Dedekind&#x27;s theory of ideals, which he did not find acceptable for philosophical reasons. Although the general adoption of Dedekind&#x27;s approach led Kronecker&#x27;s theory to be ignored for a long time, his divisors were found useful and were revived by several mathematicians in the 20th century.

Kronecker also contributed to the concept of continuity, reconstructing the form of irrational numbers in real numbers. In analysis, Kronecker rejected the formulation of a continuous, nowhere differentiable function by his colleague, Karl Weierstrass.

Also named for Kronecker are the Kronecker limit formula, Kronecker&#x27;s congruence, Kronecker delta, Kronecker comb, Kronecker symbol, Kronecker product, Kronecker&#x27;s method for factorizing polynomials, Kronecker substitution, Kronecker&#x27;s theorem in number theory, Kronecker&#x27;s lemma, and Eisenstein–Kronecker numbers.

===Philosophy of mathematics===
Kronecker&#x27;s finitism made him a forerunner of intuitionism in foundations of mathematics.

==Honors==
Kronecker was elected as a member of several academies:
* Prussian Academy of Sciences (1861)
* French Academy of Sciences (1868)
* Royal Society (1884).

The 25624 Kronecker asteroid is named after him.

<text>Janet Graham Travell (December 17, 1901 – August 1, 1997) was an American physician and medical researcher.

==Early life and education==
She was born in 1901 to John Willard and Janet Eliza (Davidson) Travell. Heavily influenced by her father&#x27;s profession of physician, Travell made the decision to pursue a career in the medical field. In June 1929, in New York City, Janet married John William Gordon Powell, who was an investment counselor. They had two daughters—Janet and Virginia. At the age of 95, Travell died of heart failure at her home in Northampton, Massachusetts.

She is remembered as President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s personal physician and a researcher of the concept of trigger points as a cause of musculoskeletal referred pain.

== Career ==

During her career, Travell pioneered techniques for the treatment of myofascial pain, including dry needling. Her career began with her educational pursuits at Wellesley College and continued in graduate school as she pursued an M.D. from Cornell University Medical College in New York City. Upon graduating in 1926, Travell completed two years of residency at New York Hospital while concurrently serving as an ambulance surgeon for the New York City police force. After completion of residency, Travell became a research fellow at Bellevue Hospital, where she studied the effects of digitalis in patients with lobar pneumonia. Once her fellowship was concluded, Travell returned to Cornell University to serve as instructor in the Department of Pharmacology and later as Associate Professor of Clinical Pharmacology. While working for Cornell, she also acted as a cardiology consultant for Sea View Hospital in Staten Island.

Travell accepted a Josiah Macy, Jr. Fellowship at Beth Israel Hospital in New York to study arterial disease from 1939 to 1941. It was during her tenure that she first became interested in skeletal muscle pain, which defined her later career. Her research produced new anesthetic techniques for the treatment of painful back muscle spasms that proved very successful among patients. Travell&#x27;s techniques included the use of a local procaine injection and vapocoolant sprays to relieve pain. The sprays are still popular in sports medicine treatments today.

It was her success with alleviating skeletal muscle pain that resulted in Travell being the first female personal Physician to the President. Travell was called upon by the personal orthopedic surgeon of Senator John F. Kennedy to assist with back pain treatments. Kennedy suffered from terrible pain possibly resulting from invasive back surgeries related to injuries sustained during World War II. When Kennedy won the presidential election in 1960, he appointed her as his personal physician. Her treatments included the use of a rocking chair with a matching rocking ottoman to help alleviate back pain, in the process popularizing their use among the public, who saw the President pictured in his rocker in the Oval Office. She continued to serve as Personal Physician to the President following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, with his successor Lyndon B. Johnson. She continued through Johnson&#x27;s re-election, but decided to leave the White House in 1965.

While serving as the President&#x27;s personal physician, Travell also took on the role of Associate Clinical Professor of Medicine at the George Washington University in 1961. Even after leaving the White House, she continued teaching at the university as a faculty member for the School of Medicine. She occupied positions as Associate Clinical Professor 1961–1970, Emeritus Clinical Professor of Medicine 1970–1988, and Honorary Clinical Professor of Medicine from 1988 until her death in 1997. Travell remained active in the medical field until the end: writing articles, giving lectures, and attending conferences.

== Research ==
Her personal interest led her to investigate, explain and expound on the phenomenon of myofascial pain syndrome, secondary to trigger points, first written about in the 1920s by Dr Dudley J. Morton. She drew attention to the role of &quot;Morton&#x27;s Toe&quot; and its responsibility for causing physical pain throughout the body.

Travell&#x27;s research resulted in over 100 scientific articles, as well as the acclaimed 1983 co-authored book with David G. Simons: &quot;Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction. The Trigger Point Manual.&quot; She also wrote her autobiography, &quot;Office Hours: Day and Night&quot;, which sheds light on her career and life.

== Quote ==

: &quot;I have lived in a very special world - a world of love and security; beauty and serenity; opportunity, adventure, and variety; challenge and achievement; and the appreciation of my peers. I have had a sufficiency of everything that I desired and a surfeit of nothing.&quot; Dr. Travell, author&#x27;s note to &quot;Office Hours: Day and Night&quot;, 1968.

<text>Toby Towson is an American gymnast and dancer. He performed as the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppet dog Barkley in its debut appearance in &quot;A Special Sesame Street Christmas&quot; and in season 10.

A native of Illinois, Towson has had a career in gymnastics, acrobatics, and dance, and he was the 1968 and 1969 NCAA Gymnastics Champion in the Floor Exercise. He is a graduate of Michigan State University.

As an assistant to U.S. Women&#x27;s gymnastics coach Kelli Hill, Towson coached Olympic gymnast Dominique Dawes. He has coached nationally with the USA Gymnastics Talent Opportunity Program and is a National Level Judge with USA Gymnastics.

Through a personal friendship with the Henson family, Towson was tapped to model for the building of a new Sesame Street character which would debut for the tenth anniversary season of Sesame Street. At first the costume was going to be an ape-like creature which could do acrobatics, so as a professional gymnast and dancer, Towson was a natural pick. As the costume was created however, the writers decided to make it into a large furry dog whose original name was &quot;Woov-woov&quot;, but no one was happy with that name. It was changed to &quot;Barkley&quot; after the first few appearances on the show. Since Towson was comfortable in the costume, and it fit him, Jim offered him a one-year contract to be on call for Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, and Towson appeared as &quot;Barkley&quot; for several months until Brian Muehl took over.

Towson continued his acrobatic dancing career and directed the Musawwir Gymnastic Dance Company which performed from a home base in Manhattan for ten years, from approximately 1976 to 1986. Towson taught dance for Washington County Public Schools in Hagerstown, Maryland, and coached gymnastics and dance at Rainbow Gymnastics in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania. As of 2010, Towson performs an alphabet dancer assembly show.

As of 2010, Towson lives with his wife, Kathryn Talbott, and three children in Boonsboro, Maryland.

<doc id="318458" wikidata="Q928016" url="?curid=318458" title="Diyari">
<text>The Diyari (), alternatively transcribed as Dieri (), is an Indigenous Australian group of the South Australian desert originating in and around the delta of Cooper Creek to the east of Lake Eyre.

==Language==

Diyari is classified as one of the Karnic languages. Though earlier described in &quot;Ethnologue&quot; as extinct, and later &quot;nearly extinct&quot;, Peter Austin has attested that the language still has fluent native speakers and hundreds of Diyari who retain some knowledge of it. Lutheran missionaries developed an orthography to transcribe the language, together with a German-Diyari dictionary, as early as 1893 and, as later modified by Johann Flierl, this was taught to many Diyari-speakers, who corresponded in the language from the 1880s down to the 1960s. Diyari was the first Aboriginal language for which a complete translation of the New Testament was made.

The Diyari also had a highly developed sign language, which was first noticed by Alfred William Howitt in 1891, who first mistook them for defiant or command gestures until he realised that they formed part of an integral system of hand signs, of which he registered 65. One of their functions was to allow women to communicate during mourning, when a speech taboo prevailed.

==Country==
The traditional lands of the Diyari were estimated by Norman Tindale to have encompassed roughly , and lay in the delta of the Barcoo River (Cooper Creek) to the east of Lake Eyre. The southern boundary was marked by Mount Freeling, its most northern reach by the Pirigundi Lake, on the Cooper Creek. The most easterly edge was constituted by Lake Hope, and the western limits lay some 80 miles west of Lake Hope. Their neighbouring tribes were the Yandruwandha and Yawarrawarrka, respectively to their east and north-east and, to the north, the Ngameni. To their north-west were the Wangganguru, to their west the Thirrari and Arabana, while on the southern fringes were the Kuyani and Adnyamathanha.

The environment was harsh, and foraging for vegetables was a staple since the kangaroo was absent from their terrain and the emu, their favourite food, quite rare. Native rats, snakes and lizards were, however, abundant.

==Mythology==
Lorimer Fison (1880):
After the creation, brothers, sisters, and others of the closest kin, intermarried promiscuously, until — the evil effects of these alliances becoming manifest — a council of the chiefs was assembled to consider in what way they might be averted, the result of their deliberations being a petition to the Muramura (Good Spirit), in answer to which he ordered that the tribe should be divided into branches, and distinguished one from another by different names, after objects animate and inanimate, such as dogs, mice, emu, rain, iguana, and so forth; the members of any such branch not to intermarry, but with permission for one branch to mingle with another. Thus, the son of a dog might not marry the daughter of a dog, but either might form an alliance with a mouse, rat, or other family. This custom is still observed, and the first question asked of a stranger is, &quot;What murdoo?&quot;, i.e., &quot;Of what family are you?&quot;.
The Diyari creation story imagined &quot;Mooramoora&quot;, the good spirit, making small black lizards at first, and delighted with them, they decided should hold sway over all other created beings. It was by remodulating this variety of lizard, cutting off the tail, and using his forefinger to create a nose, that man was created, and then divided into male and female. Mooramoora then had the Moon create all creatures. Man could not run down the fleet, tasty emu, and the deity was asked to make heat so that it would tire and allow men to catch up and trap it. Men were asked to perform certain ceremonies, considered obscene by Gason, and after their compliance, Mooramoora created the sun.

==History of contact==
Lutheran missionaries established the Bethesda or Killalpaninna Mission among the Dieri in 1866. The first ethnographic reports regarding the Diyari were written by a police trooper, Samuel Gason (1845–1897) in 1874. He estimated the numbers of Aborigines in the Cooper Creek area at 1000-1200, of which the Diyari were the most prominent, with an estimated 230 members. By the end of WW2, they were estimated to number around 60.

==Kinship system==
The Diyari foundational myths stated that originally man was incestuously promiscuous, fathers, mothers, sons and daughter all marrying each other. To overcome the strife that ensued, the Elders petitioned the Mooramoora creator for a solution, which consisted in splitting the tribe into distinct branches, each designated by an animal or natural name, and then disallow marriage among members of the same branch.

Before the white intrusion on their lands made its impact, the Dieri were divided into two tribal groups, the &quot;Ku&#x27;na:ri&quot; around Cooper Creek and the &quot;Pandu&quot; in proximity of Lake Hope.

Their kinship system was first studied by Howitt, who took it as exemplifying a form of one of the most socially backward of Australian tribes. Alfred Radcliffe-Brown analysed the Diyari kinship structure as a variant of the Arrernte system. Their moieties were &quot;Matharri&quot; and &quot;Kararrhu,&quot; in accordance with the general divisions among speakers of Thura-Yura languages in South Australia.

==Social system==
Gason thought the Diyari extremely treacherous, nourished by suspicion from infancy. At the same time, he said they displayed exemplary hospitality, revered the aged, and adored their children. Any stranger who passed through their camp, was provided with food. Infanticide was widespread, by Gason&#x27;s calculation, affecting some 30% of births and was performed by the mother. They were very attached to their camp dingos, treating them as they would a human.

== Native title ==
The Dieri Aboriginal Corporation (DAC) incorporated in 2001 and by 2014 had 600 members living in Marree, Lyndhurst, Port Augusta, Whyalla and in Broken Hill in New South Wales. The group purchased the Marree Station property surrounding Marree in 2008. In May 2012 The Federal Court of Australia made a determination which recognised Diyari rights to of land along Cooper Creek, with boundaries extending to part of the Strzelecki Regional Reserve and the Lake Eyre National Park.

<text>The Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia () was the highest unicameral legislative body in Georgia elected in the first democratic, multiparty elections in the Caucasus on October 28, 1990, while the country was still part of the Soviet Union. The Council presided over the declaration of Georgia&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union in April 1991. The legislature split into rivaling factions and became defunct after a violent coup d&#x27;état ousted President Zviad Gamsakhurdia in January 1992. A pro-Gamsakhurdia faction managed to convene for a few times in exile and again in Georgia during Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s failed attempt to regain power later in 1993. The Supreme Council was succeeded – after a brief parliamentary vacuum filled by the rule of the post-coup Military Council and then the State Council – by the Parliament of Georgia elected in October 1992.

The Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia was preceded by the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (July 1938 – November 1990), which in its turn was a successor of the Congress of Soviets of Georgia (February 1922 – July 1938).

<text>Agent Smith (later simply Smith) is a fictional character and the main antagonist of &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise. The character was primarily portrayed by Hugo Weaving in the first trilogy of films and voiced by Christopher Corey Smith in &quot;The Matrix: Path of Neo&quot; (2005), with Ian Bliss and Gideon Emery playing his human form, Bane, in the films and &quot;Path of Neo&quot; respectively. He also makes a cameo in the anime film &quot;The Animatrix&quot; (2003), voiced by Matt McKenzie. Jonathan Groff and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II portray Smith in &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot; (2021), the latter playing Morpheus in a dual role.

In 2008, Agent Smith was selected by &quot;Empire&quot; as the 84th Greatest Movie Character of All Time. In 2013, Weaving reprised the role for a General Electric advertisement. He is considered to be the archenemy of Neo, the main protagonist of the story.

==Overview==
Smith began as an Agent, an AI program in the Matrix programmed to keep order within the system by terminating human simulacra that would bring instability to the simulated reality, as well as any rogue programs that no longer serve a purpose to the Machine collective. To this end, Smith and his fellow Agents possess a number of superhuman attributes from their ability to bend the rules of the Matrix. Smith manifests his physical form by inhabiting and overwriting the simulated body of a human wired into the Matrix; by moving from body to body, he can reform himself if he is &quot;killed&quot; (which only kills the host body) and appear virtually anywhere. He can overcome the limitations of gravity and the human body, giving him speed and strength sufficient to dodge bullets flawlessly, punch through concrete with his bare hands, jump impossible distances, and easily recover from devastating physical assaults. He and other Agents wear white dress shirts under black business suits with matching black neckties, and sunglasses with darkened rectangular lenses. They use earpiece radios that allow them to communicate with each other instantaneously and perceive the actions of other humans wired into the Matrix via a type of shared consciousness. When Smith removes his earpiece during the first film, he is left unaware of the attack on the building in which he is holding Morpheus. Smith is armed in the first film with the Desert Eagle, chambered for high-caliber .50 AE ammunition, as is standard with all Agents within the Matrix.

At the end of the first film, Smith appears to have been deleted by Neo. However, in the sequels, Smith is revealed to have been linked to Neo, which enabled him to resist being sent to the Source – the Machines&#x27; mainframe, where obsolete or malfunctioning programs are deleted. No longer an Agent, Smith is liberated from the Machines&#x27; control and exists as a renegade program that manifests himself akin to a self-replicating computer virus compared to his original Agent-based ability to inhabit a single body wired into the Matrix. Smith gains the power to copy his physical form onto any entity in the Matrix by phasing his hand into their body and spreading a black liquid that transforms them into a copy of himself, resulting in an ever-growing army of Smiths connected by a single consciousness. By copying himself onto a human redpill in the process of disconnecting from the Matrix, Smith overwrites their consciousness and takes control of their body in the real world. This is seen when Smith takes over Bane&#x27;s body in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;; however, he is repelled when he attempts to do the same to Morpheus and Neo. Smith&#x27;s real power comes from his ability to absorb memories and powers from his victims, human and program alike, culminating in him taking over the Oracle and fighting Neo in the final battle of the Matrix series. Neo allows himself to be overwritten during the battle, thus giving the Machines an opportunity to delete Smith and return the Matrix and its inhabitants to normal.

==Character history==
===&quot;The Matrix&quot;===
In the first film, Smith is one of the three Agents sent to deal with Morpheus. After Neo is successfully removed from the Matrix, Smith arranges Morpheus&#x27; capture by bribing Cypher, a disillusioned member of Morpheus&#x27; crew, with reintegration into The Matrix. Upon his capture of Morpheus, he then attempts, to no avail, to get Morpheus to supply the codes to Zion&#x27;s mainframe, eventually being forced to admit to Morpheus his personal motives of wishing to get away from the Matrix regarding his accessing its mainframe. However, he briefly removes his earpiece and thus misses key intel about Neo and Trinity&#x27;s entry into Morpheus&#x27;s holding area. When Neo manages to free Morpheus, Smith orders the dispatch of Sentinels to the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; and then interferes with Neo&#x27;s escape. Neo manages to put up a fight against Smith, and narrowly escapes after Smith attempts to have Neo run over by a train. Smith survives and, alongside his fellow Agents, engages in a lengthy cross-town chase. Ultimately, Smith anticipates Neo’s final destination and guns him down. Neo revives, realizes his power as the One, and subsequently defeats Smith by entering his body and destroying the code from within.

===&quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;===
As a result of his contact with Neo from the first film, Smith is &quot;unplugged&quot; in the second film, no longer an Agent of the system but a &quot;free man&quot;. This is signified by the lack of an earpiece, which he sends to Neo in an envelope as a message early in the film. His appearance has changed in the second film as well; his sunglasses now have an angular shape different from the Agents&#x27; oblong lenses, approximating the shape of the ones Neo wears. His suit and tie are now jet black, as opposed to the dark green tint from the first film. He still possesses the abilities of an Agent, but instead of being able to jump from one human to another, he is able to copy himself over any human or program in the Matrix through direct contact; this includes humans wired into the Matrix, non-Agent programs with human forms, redpills, and other Agents. Smith retains the memories and abilities, if any, of the one over which he copies himself. This ability is much like how a virus replicates, creating an ironic contrast with the first film, where Smith likens humanity to a virus. He also implies after Neo defeated his replacement agents – Thompson, Jackson, and Johnson, that Smith had existed during and was familiar with at least the fifth iteration of the Matrix and the events therein.

He makes the claim that Neo has set him free. However, he believes there is an unseen purpose that still binds him to Neo. He tries to copy his programming onto Neo, but when this fails, he and dozens of his clones attack him, forcing Neo to flee. Later, he and his clones try to stop Neo from reaching the machine mainframe, without success, although he nonetheless was successful in mortally wounding the Keymaker.

Smith copies himself onto Bane (Ian Bliss), a crew member of the Zion hovercraft &quot;Caduceus&quot;. While waiting to leave the Matrix with a message from The Oracle, Bane is attacked and overwritten by Smith, who then takes control of his body in the real world. Smith tests his control over the body by making Bane cut his own left hand palm, in preparation for an assassination attempt on Neo that he quickly abandons. He later sabotages the Zion fleet&#x27;s defense of the city by triggering one ship&#x27;s electromagnetic pulse weapon too early, knocking out the other ships and allowing the Sentinels to overrun them.

===&quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;===
By the start of the third film, Smith has managed to copy himself over nearly every humanoid in the Matrix, giving him complete control over the &quot;Core Network&quot; (the underlying foundation of the inner workings of the Matrix), thus rendering him unstoppable even for the Machines themselves. The Oracle explains to Neo that he and Smith have become equal in power and that Smith is Neo&#x27;s negative, a result of the Matrix&#x27;s equation trying to balance itself. She tells Neo that Smith will destroy both the Matrix and the real world unless he is stopped. Smith soon assimilates the Oracle, gaining her power of foresight, and later manifests reality-bending powers equivalent to Neo&#x27;s, such as the ability to fly. Meanwhile, in the real world, Bane (now under Smith&#x27;s control) stows away on a ship being used by Neo and Trinity and tries to kill them both. Neo is blinded in the fight, but discovers that his new awareness of Machine technology allows him to perceive Smith&#x27;s essence despite his destroyed eyes, allowing him to take Smith by surprise and kill him.

Near the climax of the film, Neo offers a deal with the Machines to get rid of Smith in exchange for Zion&#x27;s safety, warning them that Smith is beyond their control and will eventually spread to the machine city, which will result in destruction of both mankind and machines. Knowing that Neo is right, the Machines agree to his terms and command all Sentinels attacking Zion to stand down and wait for orders. They later give Neo a connection to enter the Matrix to stop Smith on their behalf. Although the Matrix is now populated exclusively by Smith and his clones, the Smith that has obtained the Oracle&#x27;s powers battles Neo alone; as he explains, he has foreseen his victory, and has no need for the help of his copies. The two are almost evenly matched as the fight begins, though Neo&#x27;s combat abilities seem arguably superior to that of Smith, the latter attacking more out of brute force, rather than the technical skill he displayed in the first film. This lasts, until Neo is able to punch Smith strongly enough to slam him into the street at least 20 ft away. As the fight continues, however, it becomes clear that Neo cannot win with his finite stamina against the tireless Smith, who begins to dominate Neo in the fight; by the end of the fight, he is able to brutally beat Neo into near defeat. In the midst of this battle, Smith explains to Neo his final nihilistic revelation: &quot;It was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to end.&quot;

When Neo is near defeat, Smith demands to know why he continues to fight despite knowing he cannot win. Neo calmly responds, &quot;Because I choose to&quot; and is viciously pummeled by the enraged Smith as a result. Suddenly recognizing the scene from his prophecy, Smith is compelled to deliver the line he said in it: &quot;I say... Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo.&quot; His own words confuse and frighten him and Neo realizes that he cannot overpower Smith and allows himself to be assimilated. Because Agent Smith has assimilated the anomaly (Neo), he is now directly connected to the Source through Neo and the machines are able to destroy all copies of his programming and reboot the Matrix without errors. The process apparently kills Neo, but it also purges the Matrix of Smith&#x27;s infection, restoring all who had been infected to their original forms. Neo&#x27;s body is carried away by the machines, and an uncertain peace is established between Zion and the machine world.

===&quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;===
Smith returns in &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, portrayed by Jonathan Groff. Despite his defeat at the end of &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, Smith survived destruction because Neo survived, though he lost the ability to copy himself over others, instead retaining only the abilities he possessed when he was an Agent. When the Analyst created the new version of the Matrix in order to keep Neo subdued so that the Machines&#x27; energy crisis could be solved, Smith took on a new shell in order to remain hidden. The Analyst, the creator of the new Matrix, found that Neo and Smith were bonded, and he chose to turn that bond into a &#x27;chain&#x27;: as Neo was suppressed, Smith was similarly suppressed, taking the role of Thomas Anderson&#x27;s business partner, with an eye for the bottom line. Neo, in his original persona of Thomas Anderson, created a video game series based on his suppressed memories. After Neo reawakens to the Matrix, Smith regained his memories and attacked Neo, stating that he had come to like the freedom that he had been granted, and that Neo&#x27;s potential return to unawareness threatened that freedom. Smith then appears at Simulatte, during Neo and Trinity&#x27;s confrontation with the Analyst, saving them and aids them in fighting the Analyst&#x27;s forces. Smith shoots the Analyst, causing him to vanish. Addressing Neo as Tom, Smith declares their unexpected alliance to be over, and states that the difference between the two of them is that &quot;anyone could&#x27;ve been you whereas I&#x27;ve always been anyone.&quot; Smith then departs from his host body, leaving the man confused by the experience.

Neo also subconsciously created a version of Agent Smith in a modal influenced by his suppressed memories. This version of Agent Smith (portrayed by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) was based upon Neo&#x27;s memories of Morpheus amalgamated with his memories of the original Agent Smith, and was set free by Bugs, and became the new Morpheus.

==In other media==
===&quot;The Animatrix&quot;===
While it is unknown if it is actually him or merely just another Agent, as he was not directly named, an Agent with a heavy resemblance to Smith appears in &quot;The Animatrix&quot; film &quot;Beyond&quot;, ordering a group of exterminators to capture Yoko and a group of kids and destroy a programming glitch in the form of an abandoned building that was causing whoever entered there to achieve complex athletic stunts without danger of serious injury or death. Earlier, he and the Agents perceived the abandoned building as an instability to the Matrix programming, and were already planning to eliminate it. Another Agent appears in &quot;World Record,&quot; again resembling Smith, but wearing a trench coat over his usual suit and tie, where he and his fellow Agents attempt to stop a marathon runner named Dan from breaking a world record and disrupting his &quot;signal,&quot; or connection to the Matrix, which means being able to escape from the Matrix. The Agents possess Dan&#x27;s competitors and try to stop him from reaching the finish line and break his record. He appears in the end, reporting that Dan is a wheelchair user and thus unable to run or walk again, until he notices him trying to get up and repeatedly whisper &quot;free,&quot; enraging him. However, when Dan instead falls on the floor and is helped up, the Agent is nowhere to be seen.

===&quot;The Matrix Online&quot;===
Despite his destruction at the end of the film series, Agent Smith (or at least the remnants of his programming) managed to return and made several appearances inside the movie&#x27;s official continuation, the MMORPG &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;.

The first infection was noted in Machine mission controller Agent Gray, whose background information confirms that he was overwritten by Smith at some point during the timeline of the second and third films. This infection had somehow survived the reboot at the end of the third film and rose to the surface once again during chapter 1.2, The Hunt For Morpheus. The Agent, in both a storyline related mission and live event, showed signs of uncharacteristic speech and emotion and eventually led an assault against Zionist redpills declaring &#x27;their stench unbearable any longer&#x27;. As a result of his actions the agent was apprehended by his fellow system representatives and scheduled for a &#x27;thorough code cleansing&#x27;. He has shown no signs of direct infection since. 
Machine liaison officer DifferenceEngine, following a similar scenario to that of the previous Agent Gray infection, also took on the dialect and emotional characteristics of the famous exile agent. Instead of attacking redpills, this instance insisted on finding &#x27;Mr. Anderson&#x27;. In the end, the human/machine head relations liaison, Agent Pace, was made aware of the program&#x27;s infection and subsequent crusade; she proceeded to lock down his RSI and return his program to the Source for analysis. His subsequent fate is unknown.

The third victim of infection was the notorious bluepill Shane Black. This man was an unfortunate victim of the Smith Virus who, once infected, gained the ability to spread the code to others. This quickly led to a small scale outbreak, with several more bluepills becoming infected and joining forces in their hunt for power. He and the other infected were eventually cleansed and returned to their bluepill lives. Shane Black&#x27;s troubles continued, as he was one of the bluepills recorded to have first witnessed Unlimited redpills practicing their newfound powers at the Uriah wharf. This triggered a resurgence of the memories formed during his Smith infection and he soon became volatile and insane. He is reported to have been mercifully killed shortly afterwards.

The most recent appearance of the Smith virus was during the third anniversary events. The virus manifested itself in the form of black-suited men (although they lacked the distinct likeness of Smith). As redpills began to fight back using specialist code from the Oracle, the virus vanished suddenly, stating that he had obtained a new and more dangerous form. The nature of this form was never revealed. 

===&quot;The Matrix: Path of Neo&quot;===
&quot;The Matrix: Path of Neo&quot;, a video game covering the events of the entire film trilogy, features a different ending than that shown in &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, with a new final boss: the &quot;MegaSmith&quot;. The MegaSmith was used for gameplay reasons, because though the Wachowskis thought the martyr approach suitable for film, they also believed that in an interactive medium such as a video game (based upon the successful completion of goals), this would not work. So, this character was created to be the more appropriate &quot;final boss&quot; of &quot;Path of Neo&quot;, with the final battle described by the siblings as &quot;A little Hulk versus Galactus action&quot;. The MegaSmith is composed of destroyed buildings, cars, and parts of the road, with the &quot;spectator Smiths&quot; standing around the crater and in the streets acting as the MegaSmith&#x27;s muscles, resulting in Smith not only becoming the city&#x27;s people, but the city itself.

After Neo knocks Smith into the crater in the level &quot;Aerial Battle&quot;, Smith is sent flying through the ground and up through the street. As Neo relaxes, the surrounding Smiths walk away from the crater and begin assembling a gigantic, thirty-storey tall version of Smith from debris and vehicles. Neo flies up to face MegaSmith. After the fight, in which Neo significantly damages MegaSmith, Neo flies straight into MegaSmith&#x27;s mouth, causing the Smiths throughout the Matrix to overload and explode. The player is then shown a short scene from &quot;The Matrix: Revolutions&quot; of the streets shining with light emanating from the destroyed Smiths.

===&quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; (2017)===
Agent Smith briefly appears in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;. He appears as one of the inmates of the Phantom Zone. Agent Smith and his clones appear surveilling Joker&#x27;s vandalized Wayne Island, and later appear as one of the multiple enemies attacking the heroes. Smith&#x27;s clones also appear as enemies in the &quot;Lego Batman Movie&quot; story pack for &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;, adapting their role in the film.

His voice actor was uncredited.

===&quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; (2021)===
Agent Smith also appeared in the live-action/animated film &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;, which was also distributed by Warner Bros. He is among the Warner Bros. Serververse inhabitants that watch the basketball game between the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad.

===&quot;MultiVersus&quot; (2024)===
Smith appears as a Bruiser fighter in the fighting game &quot;MultiVersus&quot;, voiced by Sky Soleil.

==Personality==
From the start, it is evident that Agent Smith is significantly stronger, smarter, and more individualistic than the other Agents. While the other agents rarely act without consulting each other via their earpieces, to the point where they often finish each other&#x27;s sentences, Smith is usually the one giving orders or using his earpiece to gather information for his own ends. Smith also appears to be the leader of other Agents in the first film, as he has the authority to launch Sentinel attacks in the real world. As with other Agents, Smith generally approaches problems through a pragmatic point of view but, if necessary, will also act with brute force and apparent rage, especially when provoked by Neo.

The earpieces represent some form of control mechanism by the machines. It is notable that when he is interrogating Morpheus, he sends the other agents from the room, then removes his earpiece, releasing himself from the link to the machines before expressing his opinion of humanity. Early in the second film, Smith&#x27;s earpiece is sent to Neo in an envelope as a message from Smith, representing Smith&#x27;s newfound freedom.

Agent Smith complains to Morpheus that the Matrix and its inhabitants smell disgusting, &quot;if there is such a thing [as smell]&quot;. Smith has an open hatred of humans and their weakness of the flesh. He compares humanity to a virus; a disease organism that uncontrollably replicates and would inevitably destroy their environment were it not for the machine intelligences keeping them in check (however, viruses are not organisms). Ironically, Smith eventually becomes a computer virus, multiplying until he has overrun the entire Matrix.

At the same time, Smith develops an animosity towards the Matrix itself, feeling that he is as much a prisoner of it as the humans he is tasked with controlling. He later develops an immense and increasingly open desire for the destruction of both mankind and machines.

He was also shown to be a nihilist, which eventually culminates in his statement that the purpose of life is to end, and crediting Neo&#x27;s life for his determining this. During his final showdown with Neo, Smith angrily dismisses causes such as freedom, truth, peace, and love as simply human attempts to justify a meaningless and purposeless existence, and is completely unable to comprehend why Neo continues to fight him despite the knowledge that he cannot win.

The Wachowskis have commented that Smith&#x27;s gradual humanization throughout &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a process intended to mirror and balance Neo&#x27;s own increasing power and understanding of the machine world.

==Portrayal==
French actor Jean Reno was originally offered the role of Agent Smith in &quot;The Matrix&quot;, but he declined as he was at one point of his career in which he did not want to leave his native France, unwilling to move to Australia for a four-and-a-half months shooting. Hugo Weaving was ultimately cast as Smith. According to Weaving, he enjoyed playing the character because it amused him. He went to develop a neutral accent but with more specific character for the role. He wanted Smith to sound neither human nor robotic. He also said that the Wachowskis&#x27; voices influenced his voice in the film. When filming for &quot;The Matrix&quot; began, Weaving mentioned that he was excited to be a part of something that would extend him.

Following the announcement that Warner Bros. was planning a relaunch of &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise, Hugo Weaving stated that he was open to reprising the role but only if the Wachowskis were involved. In 2019, &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot; was confirmed for a 2021 release, but Weaving would not be returning. Originally, Weaving was approached to reprise the role by Lana Wachowski, but he had scheduling conflicts with his involvement in Tony Kushner&#x27;s theatrical adaptation of &quot;The Visit&quot;, leading Wachowski to conclude that the dates would not work and write him out from the film. Jonathan Groff was cast to replace Weaving in the role, with Yahya Abdul-Mateen II portraying a version of Smith inside a modal created by Neo.

==Design==

All Agents (other than Agents Perry and Pace from &quot;The Matrix Online&quot; game, and the modal version of Agent Smith that becomes Morpheus in &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;) are white males, as opposed to the population of Zion, which contains people of many ethnic groups. Agents wear rectangular sunglasses, black business suits and neckties, and earpiece radios. This is similar to a stereotypical portrayal of a government agent or &quot;Man in Black.&quot; When Smith loses his status as an Agent, his suit and tie lose the greenish hue present on everything in the Matrix, suggesting he is no longer a part of it, and his sunglasses take on an angled contour that approximates the rounded shape of the ones Neo wears. Smith also removes his earpiece and sends it to Neo. In contrast to the other Agents who show apathy toward the human race, Smith harbors an acute disgust with humanity. In the first film, he expresses a desire to leave the Matrix to escape its repulsive taint, and reasons that with Zion destroyed, his services will no longer be required, allowing him in some sense to &#x27;leave&#x27; the Matrix. This at least partially explains his extreme antagonism towards Neo, who fights relentlessly to save Zion.

Other Agents have common English names like Brown, Jones, and Thompson. It was mentioned in the Philosopher Commentary on the DVD collection that the names of Smith, Brown, and Jones may be endemic to the system itself, demonstrating a very &quot;robotic&quot; mindset on the part of the Machines.

Neo&#x27;s solitary role as the One is contrasted by Smith, who, by replicating himself, becomes &quot;the many&quot;. When Neo asks the Oracle about Smith, the Oracle explains that Smith is Neo&#x27;s opposite and his negative, the result of the Matrix&#x27;s governing equations trying to balance themselves.

Unlike the other characters in &quot;The Matrix&quot;, Smith almost always refers to Neo as &quot;Mr. Anderson&quot;. He calls him &quot;Neo&quot; only once in each part of the trilogy: the first time when he is interviewing Neo about his double life, the second when he is dropping off his earpiece for Neo, and the third when he is repeating a line of his vision to Neo.

Weaving said of the film series in 2003 that it was always going to be a trilogy, and that as Neo&#x27;s nemesis, Smith was always going to be there, describing Smith as &quot;more of a free agent&quot; later on in the series.

==Reception==

Christopher Borrelli praised the writing of Smith, noting that the character &quot;had all the good lines&quot;, and praising Weaving&#x27;s portrayal of the character as showing &quot;refreshingly nihilistic wit&quot;.

The character has been described as a 1950s &quot;organization man&quot;, like Sergeant Joe Friday from &quot;Dragnet&quot;.

Hugo Weaving reprised the role of Smith in a parody used for a 2013 GE General Electric advertisement, in which multiple copies of him appear throughout a hospital and the advertisement concludes with Smith offering a choice of a red or blue lollipop to a boy.

<text>Standing&#x27;s day gecko (Phelsuma standingi) is an arboreal and diurnal species of lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The species is endemic to southwest Madagascar; it is threatened by illegal collection for the international pet trade and habitat loss. It is among the largest living species of day geckos. Standing&#x27;s day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Phelsuma&quot;, is a Latinized version of the last name of Dutch physician Murk van Phelsum. The specific name, &quot;standingi&quot;, is in honor of another physician, Doctor Herbert F. Standing of Antananarivo, Madagascar.

==Description==
&quot;P. standingi&quot; is among the largest extant species of day geckos. It can reach a maximum total length (including tail) of 8-10″ (20-25.4cm), although larger is possible. The body colour can be quite variable, depending on light intensity. It can be brownish grey or bright green or turquoise with grey to blue reticulated markings on its body and head. The head and tail are often turquoise. Hatchlings have a yellowish green head and typical light bands and bars on their backs.

It is a sexually dimorphic species. In the males the cloacal area has very pronounced preanal pores and a bulge in the area of hemipenis. In many females two endolymphatic chalk sacs, located on each side of the neck, are well-developed, while in males usually they are just barely visible. These sacs store calcium, which is needed for the formation of egg shells.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;P. standingi&quot; is restricted to the arid southwest of Madagascar, specifically the region around Andranolaho, Sakaraha and in the Zombitse-Vohibasia National Park. This area has a unique thorn forest vegetation. The daytime temperature never drops under and between January and December, the temperature can be as high as in the shade. In July and August, the night temperature can drop to .

==Diet==
Standing&#x27;s day gecko feeds on various insects, invertebrates, and even smaller lizards. It is omnivorous, however, supplementing its prey with soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

==Behaviour==
Strictly an arboreal and diurnal species, &quot;P. standingi&quot; lives in pairs on trees, spending a lot of time basking in the sun on the highest and well exposed branches. The males are very territorial and will fight when in the presence of other males; females have this character towards other females, a behavior which is rather rare in geckos.

==Reproduction==
&quot;P. standingi&quot; is oviparous. At a temperature of , the young will hatch after approximately 60–70 days. The juveniles measure 80 mm and reach sexual maturity after one year.

In captivity, Standing&#x27;s day geckos can be expected to live up to 15-20 years when appropriately cared-for.

*1810 – Earliest recorded reference to a women&#x27;s competition at Musselburgh.
*1824 – The Perth Golfing Society is formed, later Royal Perth (the first club so honoured).
*1828 – The first references indicating that hickory was used for golf shafts appears in identical articles in &quot;The Sporting Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Sporting Magazine&quot;.
*1829 – The Dum Dum Golfing Club, later Calcutta Golf Club (and later still Royal Calcutta) is formed.
*1832 – The North Berwick Club is founded, the first to include women in its activities, although they are not permitted to play in competitions.
*1833 – King William IV confers the distinction of &quot;Royal&quot; on the Perth Golfing Society; as Royal Perth, it is the first Club to hold the distinction.
**The St. Andrews Golfers ban the stymie, but rescind the ban one year later.
*1834 – William IV confers the title &quot;&quot;Royal and Ancient&quot; on the Golf Club at St. Andrews.
*1836 – The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers abandons the deteriorating Leith Links, moving to Musselburgh.
**The longest drive ever recorded with a feathery ball, 361 yards, was achieved with a following wind by Samuel Messieux on the Old Course at St Andrews.
*1842 – The Bombay Golfing Society (later Royal Bombay) is founded.
*1844 – Blackheath follows Leith in expanding its course from five to seven holes. North Berwick also had seven holes at the time, although the trend toward a standard eighteen had begun.
*1848 – Invention of the &quot;guttie,&quot; the gutta-percha ball. It flies further than the feathery and is much less expensive to make. It contributes greatly to the expansion of the game.

<text>Mildred Ella &quot;Babe&quot; Didrikson Zaharias (; Didrikson; June 26, 1911 – September 27, 1956) was an American athlete who excelled in golf, basketball, baseball, and track and field. She won two gold medals and a silver in track and field at the 1932 Summer Olympics before turning to professional golf and winning 10 LPGA major championships.

==Biography==
Mildred Ella Didrikson was born on June 26, 1911, the sixth of seven children, in the coastal city of Port Arthur, Texas. Her mother Hannah and her father Ole Didriksen were immigrants from Norway. Although her three eldest siblings were born in Norway, Babe and her three other siblings were born in Port Arthur. She later changed the spelling of her surname from Didriksen to Didrikson. She moved with her family to 850 Doucette in Beaumont, Texas, at age 4. She claimed to have acquired the nickname &quot;Babe&quot; (after Babe Ruth) upon hitting five home runs in a childhood baseball game, but her Norwegian mother had called her &quot;Bebe&quot; from the time she was a toddler.

Although best known for her athletic gifts, Didrikson had many talents. She also competed in sewing. An excellent seamstress, she made many of her clothes, including her golfing outfits. She claimed to have won the sewing championship at the 1931 State Fair of Texas in Dallas; she did win the South Texas State Fair in Beaumont, embellishing the story many years later in 1953. She attended Beaumont High School. Never a strong student, she was forced to repeat the eighth grade and was a year older than her classmates. She eventually dropped out without graduating after she moved to Dallas to play basketball. She was a singer and a harmonica player and recorded several songs on the Mercury Records label. Her biggest seller was &quot;I Felt a Little Teardrop&quot; with &quot;Detour&quot; on the flip side.

Already famous as Babe Didrikson, she married George Zaharias (1908–1984), a professional wrestler, in St. Louis, Missouri, on December 23, 1938. Thereafter, she was largely known as Babe Didrikson Zaharias or Babe Zaharias.

===Athletic achievements===
Didrikson gained world fame in track and field and All-American status in basketball. She played organized baseball and softball and was an expert diver, roller-skater, and bowler.

====AAU champion====
Didrikson&#x27;s first job after high school was as a secretary for the Employers&#x27; Casualty Insurance Company of Dallas, though she was employed only in order to play basketball as an amateur on the company&#x27;s &quot;industrial team&quot;, the Golden Cyclones. As a side note, the competition was then governed by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). Despite leading the team to an AAU Basketball Championship in 1931, Didrikson had first achieved wider attention as a track and field athlete.

Representing her company in the 1932 AAU Championships, she competed in eight out of ten events, winning five outright, and tying for first in a sixth. Didrikson&#x27;s performances were enough to win the team championship, despite her being the sole member of her team.

====1932 Olympics====
Didrikson set four world records, winning two gold medals and one silver medal in track and field in the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. In the 80-meter hurdles, she equaled the world record of 11.8 seconds in her opening heat. In the final, she broke her record with an 11.7 clocking, taking gold. In the javelin, she also won gold with an Olympic record throw of 43.69 meters. In the high jump, she took silver with a world record-tying leap of . Fellow American Jean Shiley also jumped 1.657 metres, and the pair tied in a jump-off when the bar was raised to . Shiley was awarded the gold after Didrikson was ruled to have used an improper technique. She did not compete in the discus throw, as fellow American Lillian Copeland beat her out in the Olympic trials; Copeland went on to win the gold medal in discus.

Before the 1932 games, Didrikson was involved in a racial incident involving fellow athletes Tidye Pickett and Louise Stokes, both of whom are black. In Denver, on a train, Didrikson threw water on Pickett and Stokes, because Didrikson didn&#x27;t like having African-American athletes on the team. Pickett and Stokes were later removed from the team, and replaced by white athletes who had qualified with slower times from the trials.

Didrikson is the only track and field athlete, male or female, to win individual Olympic medals in separate running, throwing, and jumping events.

====Post-Olympics====
In the following years, she performed on the vaudeville circuit, traveled with teams like Babe Didrikson&#x27;s All-Americans basketball team and the bearded House of David (commune) team. Didrikson was also a competitive pocket billiards (pool) player, though not a champion. She was noted in the January 1933 press for playing (and badly losing) a multi-day straight pool match in New York City against famed female Ruth McGinnis.

By 1935, Didrikson began to play golf, a latecomer to the sport in which she became best known. Shortly thereafter, she was denied amateur status and consequently, in January 1938, she competed in the Los Angeles Open, a PGA (Professional Golfers&#x27; Association) tournament. No other woman competed against men in this tournament until Annika Sörenstam, Suzy Whaley, Michelle Wie, and Brittany Lincicome almost six decades later. She shot 81 and 84, and missed the cut. In the tournament, she was teamed with George Zaharias. They were married eleven months later, and settled in Tampa, Florida, on the premises of a golf course that they purchased in 1949.

Didrikson became America&#x27;s first female golf celebrity and the leading player of the 1940s and early 1950s. In order to regain amateur status in the sport, she could compete in no other sports for three years. She gained back her amateur status in 1942. In 1945, she participated in three more PGA Tour events, missing the cut of one of them, and making the cut of the other two; as of 2023, she remains the only woman to make the tournament cut in a regular PGA Tour event. Zaharias won the 1946 U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur and the 1947 British Ladies Amateur – the first American to do so – and three Women&#x27;s Western Opens. Having formally turned professional in 1947, Didrikson dominated the Women&#x27;s Professional Golf Association and later the Ladies Professional Golf Association. She was a founding member of the Ladies Professional Golf Association, in 1950. Serious illness ended her career in the mid-1950s.

Zaharias won a tournament named after her, the Babe Zaharias Open of her hometown of Beaumont, Texas. She won the 1947 Titleholders Championship and the 1948 U.S. Women&#x27;s Open for her fourth and fifth major championships. She won 17 straight women&#x27;s amateur victories, a feat never equaled by anyone. By 1950, she had won every golf title available. Totaling both her amateur and professional victories, Zaharias won a total of 82 golf tournaments.

Charles McGrath of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of Zaharias, &quot;Except perhaps for Arnold Palmer, no golfer has ever been more beloved by the gallery.&quot;

===Golf awards===
While Zaharias missed the cut in the 1938 PGA Tour event, later, as she became more experienced, she made the cut in every PGA Tour event she entered. In January 1945, Zaharias played in three PGA tournaments. She shot 76–76 to qualify for the Los Angeles Open. She then shot 76–81 to make the two-day cut in the tournament itself, but missed the three-day cut after a 79, making her the first (and currently only) woman in history to make the cut in a regular PGA Tour event. She continued her cut streak at the Phoenix Open, where she shot 77-72-75-80, finishing in 33rd place. At the Tucson Open, she qualified by shooting 74-81 and then shot a 307 in the tournament and finished tied for 42nd. Unlike other female golfers competing in men&#x27;s events, she got into the Los Angeles and Tucson Opens through 36-hole qualifiers, as opposed to a sponsor&#x27;s exemption.

In 1948, she became the first woman to attempt to qualify for the U.S. Open, but her application was rejected by the USGA. They stated that the event was intended to be open to men only.

===Baseball===
In March 1934, Didrikson pitched a total of four innings in three Major League spring training exhibition games:
* On March 20 she gave up one walk and no hits in one inning for the Philadelphia Athletics against the Brooklyn Dodgers, getting out of the inning with a triple play.
* On March 22 she pitched the first inning for the St. Louis Cardinals against the Boston Red Sox. It was reported that &quot;Under tutelage of Burleigh Grimes, Dizzy Dean, and others she has learned to stand on the rubber, wind up like a big leaguer and throw a rather fair curve.&quot; The Red Sox scored three runs against Didrikson in the inning before she got Boston third baseman Bucky Walters to fly out to future Hall of Famer Joe Medwick in left field to end the inning. She was relieved at the start of the second inning by Cardinal pitcher Bill Hallahan. 400 fans were in attendance.
* On March 25 she played for the Cleveland Indians against their Double-A farm team, the New Orleans Pelicans, pitching two scoreless innings and hitting two line drives, one fair and one foul.

Didrikson also spent time with the House of David barnstorming team and is still recognized as the world record holder for the farthest baseball throw by a woman.

===Last years and death===
Zaharias had her greatest year in 1950 when she completed the Grand Slam of the three women&#x27;s majors of the day: the U.S. Open, the Titleholders Championship, and the Women&#x27;s Western Open, a feat that made her the leader on the money list that year. Also that year, she reached 10 wins faster than any other LPGA golfer, doing so in one year and 20 days, a record that still stands (as do her records for reaching 20 and 30 wins, in two years and four months and five years and 22 days, respectively). She was the leading money-winner again in 1951, and in 1952 took another major with a Titleholders victory, but illness prevented her from playing a full schedule in 1952–53.

She was a close friend of fellow golfer Betty Dodd. According to Susan Cayleff&#x27;s biography &quot;Babe,&quot; Dodd was quoted as saying, &quot;I had such admiration for this fabulous person [Zaharias]. I loved her. I would have done anything for her.&quot; They met in a 1950 amateur golf tournament in Miami and became close almost immediately. Cayleff wrote, &quot;As Didrikson&#x27;s marriage grew increasingly troubled, she spent more time with Dodd. The women toured together on the golf circuit, and eventually Dodd moved in with Zaharias and Didrikson for the last six years of Didrikson&#x27;s life.&quot; They never used the word &quot;lesbian&quot; to describe their relationship, but there is little doubt that their relationship was both sexual and romantic, and Zaharias has been described as the first lesbian gold medallist in Olympic athletics.

In 1953, Zaharias was diagnosed with colon cancer. After undergoing surgery, she made a comeback in 1954. She took the Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average, her only win of that trophy, and her 10th and final major with a U.S. Women&#x27;s Open championship, one month after the surgery and while wearing a colostomy bag. With this win, she became the second-oldest woman to win a major LPGA championship tournament (behind Fay Crocker). Babe Zaharias now stands third to Crocker and Sherri Steinhauer. These wins made her the fastest player to reach 30 wins (five years and 22 days). In addition to continuing tournament play, Zaharias also served as the president of the LPGA from August 1952 to July 1955.

Her colon cancer recurred in 1955. Despite her limited schedule of eight golfing events that season, Zaharias won her last two tournaments in competitive golf. On September 27, 1956, Zaharias died of her illness at the age of forty-five at the John Sealy Hospital in Galveston, Texas. At the time of her death, she was still a top-ranked female golfer. She and her husband had earlier established the Babe Zaharias Fund to support cancer clinics. She is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in her hometown of Beaumont, Texas.

During her final years, Zaharias became known not only for her athletic abilities but as a public advocate for cancer awareness, at a time when many Americans refused to seek diagnosis or treatment for suspected cancer. She used her fame to solicit donations for her cancer fund but also as a spokesperson for the American Cancer Society. Her work in this area was honored by US President Dwight Eisenhower on a visit to the White House.

==Legacy==
She was named the 10th Greatest North American Athlete of the 20th Century by ESPN, being the highest-ranked woman on their list.
Zaharias broke the accepted models of femininity in her time, including the accepted models of female athleticism. Standing tall and weighing , Zaharias was physically strong and socially straightforward about her strength. Although a sports hero to many, she was also derided for her &quot;manliness&quot;.

Zaharias was inducted into the LPGA Hall of Fame in 1951 (now part of the World Golf Hall of Fame). In 1957, she posthumously received the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf. It was accepted by her husband George, four months after her death. She was one of six initial inductees into the LPGA Hall of Fame at its inception in 1977.

Zaharias has a museum dedicated to her in Beaumont, Texas the Babe Didrikson Zaharias Museum. Several golf courses are named after her. A Tampa, Florida golf course that she and her husband owned, the Babe Zaharias Golf Course, was given landmark status.

In 1973, Zaharias, who had lived in the Denver area for most of the 1940s and early 1950s, became one of the three inductees in the inaugural class (joining Dave Hill and Babe Lind) of the Colorado Golf Hall of Fame.

In 1976, Zaharias was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 1981, the U.S. Postal Service issued an 18 cent stamp commemorating Zaharias. In 2008, Zaharias was inducted into the Colorado Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

On January 7, 2021, Zaharias was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Donald J. Trump.

===Contemporary impressions===
Williams&#x27; remark typified the attitude of some toward women who did not fit the traditional ideals of femininity current in the first half of the 20th century. However, in the same time period, the Associated Press chose her as the &quot;Female Athlete of the Year&quot; six times for track &amp; field and for golfing, and, in 1950, overwhelmingly voted for her as the &quot;Greatest Female Athlete of the First Half of the Century&quot;. Aside from her impact on the women and girls of her time, she impressed seasoned sportswriters also:

===Modern-day===
The Associated Press followed up its 1950 declaration fifty years later by voting Zaharias the &quot;Woman Athlete of the 20th Century&quot; in 1999. In 2000, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine also named her second on its list of the Greatest Female Athletes of All Time, behind the heptathlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee. She is also in the World Golf Hall of Fame. Zaharias is the highest-ranked woman, at No. 10, on ESPN&#x27;s list of the 50 top athletes of the 20th century. In 2000, she was ranked as the 17th-greatest golfer, and the second-greatest woman player (after Mickey Wright) by &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine.

Zaharias wrote an autobiography &quot;This Life I&#x27;ve Led&quot;. It is no longer in print but is available in many libraries.

In 2014, Zaharias was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display that celebrates LGBT history and people.

She was inducted into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame, Class of 2016.

===Babe Zaharias Golf Course===
In 1949, Zaharias purchased a golf course in the Forest Hills area of Tampa and lived nearby. After her death, the golf course was sold. It lay dormant as developers attempted to acquire the land for residential housing.

In 1974, the City of Tampa took over the golf course, renovated it, and reopened it, naming it the Babe Zaharias Golf Course. At some point afterward, it was accorded historical-landmark status.

===California course===
In 1980, the Industry Hills Golf Club at Pacific Palms Resort in City of Industry, California built two courses, The Ike and The Zaharias. The courses were designed by William F. Bell (original design) and Casey O&#x27;Callaghan (renovation). In 2010, the courses together won the National Golf Course Owners Association&#x27;s California Golf Course of the Year Award.

<doc id="318482" wikidata="Q11608" url="?curid=318482" title="Anne Hutchinson">
<text>Anne Hutchinson (; July 1591 – August 1643) was a Puritan spiritual advisor, religious reformer, and an important participant in the Antinomian Controversy which shook the infant Massachusetts Bay Colony from 1636 to 1638. Her strong religious formal declaration were at odds with the established Puritan clergy in the Boston area and her popularity and charisma helped create a theological schism that threatened the Puritan religious community in New England. She was eventually tried and convicted, then banished from the colony with many of her supporters.

Hutchinson was born in Alford, Lincolnshire, England, the daughter of Francis Marbury, an Anglican cleric and school teacher who gave her a far better education than most other girls received. She lived in London as a young adult, and there married a friend from home, William Hutchinson. The couple moved back to Alford where they began following preacher John Cotton in the nearby port of Boston, Lincolnshire. Cotton was compelled to emigrate in 1633, and the Hutchinsons followed a year later with their 15 children and soon became well established in the growing settlement of Boston in New England. Hutchinson was a midwife and helpful to those needing her assistance, as well as forthcoming with her personal religious understandings. Soon she was hosting women at her house weekly, providing commentary on recent sermons. These meetings became so popular that she began offering meetings for men as well, including the young governor of the colony, Henry Vane.

Hutchinson began to accuse the local ministers (except for Cotton and her husband&#x27;s brother-in-law, John Wheelwright) of preaching a covenant of works rather than a covenant of grace, and many ministers began to complain about her increasingly blatant accusations, as well as certain unorthodox theological teachings. The situation eventually erupted into what is commonly called the Antinomian Controversy, culminating in her 1637 trial, conviction, and banishment from the colony. The main thrust of the evidence was her contemptuous remarks about the Puritan ministers, but the court refused to state the basis of her conviction. This was followed by a March 1638 church trial in which she was put out of her congregation.

Hutchinson and many of her supporters established the settlement of Portsmouth, Rhode Island with encouragement from Providence Plantations founder Roger Williams in what became the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. After her husband&#x27;s death a few years later, threats of Massachusetts annexing Rhode Island compelled Hutchinson to move totally outside the reach of Boston into the lands of the Dutch. Five of her older surviving children remained in New England or in England, while she settled with her younger children near an ancient landmark, Split Rock, in what later became The Bronx in New York City. Tensions with the Siwanoy Indian tribe were high at the time. In August 1643, Hutchinson, six of her children, and other household members were killed by Siwanoys during Kieft&#x27;s War. The only survivor was her nine-year-old daughter Susanna, who was taken captive.

Hutchinson is a key figure in the history of religious freedom in England&#x27;s American colonies and the history of women in ministry, challenging the authority of the ministers. She is honored by Massachusetts with a State House monument calling her a &quot;courageous exponent of civil liberty and religious toleration&quot;. Historian Michael Winship, author of two books about her, has called her &quot;the most famous—or infamous—English woman in colonial American history&quot;.

== Life in England ==
=== Childhood ===
Anne Hutchinson was born Anne Marbury to parents Francis Marbury and Bridget Dryden in Alford, Lincolnshire, England, and baptised there on 20 July 1591. Her father was an Anglican cleric in London with strong Puritan leanings, who felt strongly that a clergy should be well educated and clashed with his superiors on this issue. Marbury&#x27;s repeated challenges to the Anglican authorities led to his censure and imprisonment several years before Anne was born. In 1578, he was given a public trial, of which he made a transcript from memory during a period of house arrest.

For his conviction of heresy, Marbury spent two years in Marshalsea Prison on the south side of the River Thames across from London. In 1580, at the age of 25, he was released and was considered sufficiently reformed to preach and teach. He moved to the remote market town of Alford in Lincolnshire, about north of London. Hutchinson&#x27;s father was soon appointed curate (assistant priest) of St Wilfrid&#x27;s Church, Alford, and in 1585 he also became the schoolmaster at the Alford Free Grammar School, one of many such public schools, free to the poor and begun by Queen Elizabeth I. About this time, Marbury married his first wife, Elizabeth Moore, who bore three children, then died. Within a year of his first wife&#x27;s death, Marbury married Bridget Dryden, about 10 years younger than he and from a prominent Northampton family. Her brother Erasmus was the grandfather of John Dryden, the playwright and Poet Laureate. Anne was the third of 15 children born to this marriage, 12 of whom survived early childhood. The Marburys lived in Alford for the first 15 years of Anne&#x27;s life, and she received a better education than most girls of her time, with her father&#x27;s strong commitment to learning, and she also became intimately familiar with scripture and Christian tenets. Education at that time was offered almost exclusively to boys and men. One possible reason why Marbury taught his daughters may have been that six of his first seven children were girls. Another reason may have been that the ruling class in Elizabethan England began realising that girls could be schooled, looking to the example of the queen, who spoke six foreign languages.

In 1605 when Hutchinson was 15, her family moved from Alford to the heart of London, where her father was given the position of vicar of St Martin Vintry. Here his expression of Puritan views was tolerated, though somewhat muffled, because of a shortage of clergy. Marbury took on additional work in 1608, preaching in the parish of St Pancras, Soper Lane, several miles northwest of the city, travelling there by horseback twice a week. In 1610, he replaced that position with one much closer to home and became rector of St Margaret, New Fish Street, a short walk from St Martin Vintry. He was at a high point in his career, but he died suddenly at the age of 55 in February 1611, when Anne was 19 years old.

=== Adulthood: following John Cotton ===
The year after her father&#x27;s death, Anne Marbury, aged 21, married William Hutchinson, a familiar acquaintance from Alford who was a fabric merchant then working in London. The couple was married at St Mary Woolnoth Church in London on 9 August 1612, shortly after which they moved back to their hometown of Alford.

Soon they heard about an engaging minister named John Cotton who preached at St Botolph&#x27;s Church in the large port of Boston, about from Alford. Cotton was installed as minister at Boston the year that the Hutchinsons were married, after having been a tutor at Emmanuel College in Cambridge. He was 27 years old, yet he had gained a reputation as one of the leading Puritans in England. Once the Hutchinsons heard Cotton preach, the couple made the trip to Boston as often as possible, enduring the ride by horseback when the weather and circumstances allowed. Cotton&#x27;s spiritual message was different from that of his fellow Puritans, as he placed less emphasis on one&#x27;s behaviour to attain God&#x27;s salvation and more emphasis on the moment of religious conversion &quot;in which mortal man was infused with a divine grace.&quot; Anne Hutchinson was attracted to Cotton&#x27;s theology of &quot;absolute grace&quot;, which caused her to question the value of &quot;works&quot; and to view the Holy Spirit as &quot;indwelling in the elect saint&quot;. This allowed her to identify as a &quot;mystic participant in the transcendent power of the Almighty&quot;; such a theology was empowering to women, according to Eve LaPlante, whose status was otherwise determined by their husbands or fathers.

Another strong influence on Hutchinson was closer to her home in the nearby town of Bilsby. Her brother-in-law, the young minister John Wheelwright, preached a message like that of Cotton. As reformers, both Cotton and Wheelwright encouraged a sense of religious rebirth among their parishioners, but their weekly sermons did not satisfy the yearnings of some Puritan worshippers. This led to the rise of conventicles, which were gatherings of &quot;those who had found grace&quot; to listen to sermon repetitions, discuss and debate scripture, and pray. These gatherings were particularly important to women because they allowed women to assume roles of religious leadership that were otherwise denied them in a male-dominated church hierarchy. Hutchinson was inspired by Cotton and by other women who ran conventicles, and she began holding meetings in her own home, where she reviewed recent sermons with her listeners, and provided her own explanations of the message.

The Puritans wanted to abolish the ceremony of the Church of England and govern their churches based on a consensus of the parishioners. They preferred to eliminate bishops appointed by the monarchs, choose their own church elders (or governors), and provide for a lay leader and two ministers—one a teacher in charge of doctrine, and the other a pastor in charge of people&#x27;s souls. By 1633, Cotton&#x27;s inclination toward such Puritan practices had attracted the attention of Archbishop William Laud, who was on a campaign to suppress any preaching and practices that did not conform to the practices of the established Anglican Church. In that year, Cotton was removed from his ministry, and he went into hiding. Threatened with imprisonment, he made a hasty departure for New England aboard the ship &quot;Griffin&quot;, taking his pregnant wife with him. During the voyage to the colonies, she gave birth to their child, whom they named Seaborn.

When Cotton left England, Anne Hutchinson described it as a &quot;great trouble unto her,&quot; and said that she &quot;could not be at rest&quot; until she followed her minister to New England. Hutchinson believed that the Spirit instructed her to follow Cotton to America, &quot;impressed by the evidence of divine providence&quot;. She was well into her 14th pregnancy, however, so she did not travel until after the baby was born. With the intention of soon going to New England, the Hutchinsons allowed their oldest son Edward to sail with Cotton before the remainder of the family made the voyage. In 1634, 43-year-old Anne Hutchinson embarked on a journey by sailing from England with her 48-year-old husband William and their other ten surviving children, aged about eight months to 19 years. They sailed aboard the &quot;Griffin&quot;, the same ship that had carried Cotton and their oldest son a year earlier.

== Boston ==
William Hutchinson was successful in his mercantile business and brought a considerable estate with him to New England, arriving in Boston in the late summer of 1634. The Hutchinson family purchased a half-acre lot on the Shawmut Peninsula, now downtown Boston. Here they had a house built, one of the largest on the peninsula, with a timber frame and at least two stories. (The house stood until October 1711, when it was consumed in the great fire of Boston, after which the Old Corner Bookstore was built on the site.) The Hutchinsons soon were granted Taylor&#x27;s Island in the Boston harbour, where they grazed their sheep, and they also acquired of land at Mount Wollaston, south of Boston in the area that later became Quincy. Once established, William Hutchinson continued to prosper in the cloth trade and made land purchases and investments. He became a town selectman and deputy to the General Court. Anne Hutchinson likewise fit into her new home with ease, devoting many hours to those who were ill or in need. She became an active midwife, and while tending to women in childbirth, she provided them with spiritual advice. Magistrate John Winthrop noted that &quot;her ordinary talke was about the things of the Kingdome of God,&quot; and &quot;her usuall conversation was in the way of righteousness and kindnesse.&quot;

=== Boston church ===
The Hutchinsons became members of the First Church in Boston, the most important church in the colony. With its location and harbour, Boston was New England&#x27;s centre of commerce, and its church was characterised by Winthrop as &quot;the most publick, where Seamen and all Strangers came&quot;. The church membership had grown from 80 to 120 during Cotton&#x27;s first four months there. In his journal, Winthrop stated that &quot;more were converted &amp; added to that Churche, than to all the other Churches in the Baye.&quot; The historian Michael Winship noted in 2005 that the church seemed to approach the Puritan ideal of a Christian community. Early Massachusetts historian William Hubbard found the church to be &quot;in so flourishing a condition as were scarce any where else to be paralleled.&quot; Winship considers it a twist of fate that the colony&#x27;s most important church also had the most unconventional minister in John Cotton. The more extreme religious views of Hutchinson and Henry Vane, the colony&#x27;s young governor, did not much stand out because of Cotton&#x27;s divergence from the theology of his fellow ministers.

=== Home Bible study group ===
Hutchinson&#x27;s visits to women in childbirth led to discussions along the lines of the conventicles in England. She soon began hosting weekly meetings at her home for women who wanted to discuss Cotton&#x27;s sermons and hear her explanations and elaborations. Her meetings for women became so popular that she had to organise meetings for men, as well, and she was hosting 60 or more people per week. These gatherings brought women, as well as their husbands, &quot;to enquire more seriously after the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;

As the meetings continued, Hutchinson began offering her own religious views, stressing that only &quot;an intuition of the Spirit&quot; would lead to one&#x27;s election by God, and not good works. Her theological interpretations began diverging from the more legalistic views found among the colony&#x27;s ministers, and the attendance increased at her meetings and soon included Governor Vane. Her ideas that one&#x27;s outward behaviour was not necessarily tied to the state of one&#x27;s soul became attractive to those who might have been more attached to their professions than to their religious state, such as merchants and craftsmen. The colony&#x27;s ministers became more aware of Hutchinson&#x27;s meetings, and they contended that such &quot;unauthorised&quot; religious gatherings might confuse the faithful. Hutchinson responded to this with a verse from Titus, saying that &quot;the elder women should instruct the younger.&quot;

=== Antinomian Controversy ===
==== Tensions build ====
Hutchinson&#x27;s gatherings were seen as unorthodox by some of the colony&#x27;s ministers, and differing religious opinions within the colony eventually became public debates. The resulting religious tension erupted into what has traditionally been called the Antinomian Controversy, but has more recently been labelled the Free Grace Controversy.

The Reverend Zechariah Symmes had sailed to New England on the same ship as the Hutchinsons. In September 1634, he told another minister that he doubted Anne Hutchinson&#x27;s orthodoxy, based on questions that she asked him following his shipboard sermons. This issue delayed Hutchinson&#x27;s membership to the Boston church by a week, until a pastoral examination determined that she was sufficiently orthodox to join the church.

In 1635, a difficult situation occurred when senior pastor John Wilson returned from a lengthy trip to England where he had been settling his affairs. Hutchinson was exposed to his teaching for the first time, and she saw a big difference between her own doctrines and his. She found his emphasis on morality and his doctrine of &quot;evidencing justification by sanctification&quot; to be disagreeable. She told her followers that Wilson lacked &quot;the seal of the Spirit.&quot; Wilson&#x27;s theological views were in accord with all of the other ministers in the colony except for Cotton, who stressed &quot;the inevitability of God&#x27;s will&quot; (&quot;free grace&quot;) as opposed to preparation (works). Hutchinson and her allies had become accustomed to Cotton&#x27;s doctrines, and they began disrupting Wilson&#x27;s sermons, even finding excuses to leave when Wilson got up to preach or pray.

Thomas Shepard, the minister of Newtown (which later became Cambridge), began writing letters to Cotton as early as the spring of 1636. He expressed concern about Cotton&#x27;s preaching and about some of the unorthodox opinions found among his Boston parishioners. Shepard went even further when he began criticising the Boston opinions to his Newtown congregation during his sermons. In May 1636, the Bostonians received a new ally when the Reverend John Wheelwright arrived from England and aligned himself with Cotton, Hutchinson, and other &quot;free grace&quot; advocates. Wheelwright had been a neighbour of the Hutchinsons in Lincolnshire, and his wife was a sister of Hutchinson&#x27;s husband. Another boost for the free grace advocates came during the same month, when the young aristocrat Henry Vane was elected as the governor of the colony. Vane was a strong supporter of Hutchinson, yet he also had his own ideas about theology that were considered not only unorthodox, but radical by some.

Hutchinson and the other free grace advocates continued to question the orthodox ministers in the colony. Wheelwright began preaching at Mount Wollaston, about ten miles south of the Boston meetinghouse, and his sermons began to answer Shepard&#x27;s criticisms with his own criticism of the covenant of works. This mounting &quot;pulpit aggression&quot; continued throughout the summer, along with the lack of respect shown Boston&#x27;s Reverend Wilson. Wilson endured these religious differences for several months before deciding that the affronts and errors were serious enough to require a response. He is the one who likely alerted magistrate John Winthrop, one of his parishioners, to take notice. On or shortly after 21 October 1636, Winthrop gave the first public warning of the problem that consumed him and the leadership of the Massachusetts Bay Colony for much of the next two years. In his journal he wrote, &quot;One Mrs. Hutchinson, a member of the church at Boston, a woman of a ready wit and a bold spirit, brought over with her two dangerous errors: 1. That the person of the Holy Ghost dwells in a justified person. 2. That no sanctification can help to evidence to us our justification.&quot; He went on to elaborate these two points, and the Antinomian Controversy began with this journal entry.

==== Ministerial confrontation ====
On 25 October 1636, seven ministers gathered at the home of Cotton to confront the developing discord; they held a &quot;private conference&quot; which included Hutchinson and other lay leaders from the Boston church. Some agreement was reached, and Cotton &quot;gave satisfaction to them [the other ministers], so as he agreed with them all in the point of sanctification, and so did Mr. Wheelwright; so as they all did hold, that sanctification did help to evidence justification.&quot; Another issue was that some of the ministers had heard that Hutchinson criticised them during her conventicles for preaching a covenant of works and said they were not able ministers of the New Testament. Hutchinson responded to this only when prompted, and only to one or two ministers at a time. She believed that her response, which was largely coaxed from her, was private and confidential. A year later, her words were used against her in a trial that resulted in her banishment from the colony.

By late 1636, as the controversy deepened, Hutchinson and her supporters were accused of two heresies in the Puritan church: antinomianism and familism. The word &quot;antinomianism&quot; literally means &quot;against or opposed to the law&quot;; in a theological context, it means &quot;the moral law is not binding upon Christians, who are under the law of grace.&quot; According to this view, if one was under the law of grace, then moral law did not apply, allowing one to engage in immoral acts. Familism was named for a 16th-century sect called the Family of Love, and it involved one&#x27;s perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit. Hutchinson and her supporters were sometimes accused of engaging in immoral behaviour or &quot;free love&quot; in order to discredit them, but such acts were antithetical to their doctrine. Hutchinson, Wheelwright, and Vane all took leading roles as antagonists of the orthodox party, but theologically, it was Cotton&#x27;s differences of opinion with the colony&#x27;s other ministers that was at the centre of the controversy.

By winter, the theological schism had become great enough that the General Court called for a day of fasting to help ease the colony&#x27;s difficulties. During the appointed fast-day on Thursday, 19 January 1637, Wheelwright preached at the Boston church in the afternoon. To the Puritan clergy, his sermon was &quot;censurable and incited mischief&quot;, but the free grace advocates were encouraged, and they became more vociferous in their opposition to the &quot;legal&quot; ministers. Governor Vane began challenging the doctrines of the colony&#x27;s divines, and supporters of Hutchinson refused to serve during the Pequot War of 1637 because Wilson was the chaplain of the expedition. Ministers worried that the bold stand of Hutchinson and her supporters began to threaten the &quot;Puritan&#x27;s holy experiment.&quot; Had they succeeded, historian Dunn believes that they would have profoundly changed the thrust of Massachusetts history.

==== Events of 1637 ====
By March, the political tide began to turn against the free grace advocates. Wheelwright was tried for contempt and sedition that month for his fast-day sermon and was convicted in a close vote, but not yet sentenced. During the election of May 1637, Henry Vane was replaced as governor by John Winthrop; in addition, all the other Boston magistrates who supported Hutchinson and Wheelwright were voted out of office. By the summer of 1637, Vane sailed back to England, never to return. With his departure, the time was ripe for the orthodox party to deal with the remainder of their rivals.

The autumn court of 1637 convened on 2 November and sentenced Wheelwright to banishment, ordering him to leave the colony within 14 days. Several of the other supporters of Hutchinson and Wheelwright were tried and given varied sentences. Following these preliminaries, it was Anne Hutchinson&#x27;s turn to be tried.

==== Civil trial: day 1 ====
Hutchinson was brought to trial on 7 November 1637, with Wheelwright banished and other court business settled. Governor John Winthrop presided over the trial, in which Hutchinson was charged with &quot;traducing [slandering] the ministers&quot;. Winthrop also presented other charges against her, including the allegation that she &quot;troubled the peace of the commonwealth and churches&quot; by promoting and divulging opinions that had divided the community, and continuing to hold meetings at her home despite a recent synod that had condemned them.

The court, however, found it difficult to charge Hutchinson because she had never spoken her opinions in public, unlike Wheelwright and the other men who had been tried, nor had she ever signed any statements about them. Winthrop&#x27;s first two lines of prosecution were to portray her as a co-conspirator of others who had openly caused trouble in the colony, and then to fault her for holding conventicles. Question by question, Hutchinson effectively stonewalled him in her responses, and Winthrop was unable to find a way to convert her known membership in a seditious faction into a convictable offence. Deputy governor Thomas Dudley had a substantial background in law, and he stepped in to assist the prosecution. Dudley questioned Hutchinson about her conventicles and her association with the other conspirators. With no answer by Hutchinson, he moved on to the charge of her slandering the ministers.

The remainder of the trial was spent on this last charge. The prosecution intended to demonstrate that Hutchinson had made disparaging remarks about the colony&#x27;s ministers, and to use the October meeting as their evidence. Six ministers had presented to the court their written versions of the October conference, and Hutchinson agreed with the substance of their statements. Her defence was that she had spoken reluctantly and in private, that she &quot;must either speak false or true in my answers&quot; in the ministerial context of the meeting. In those private meetings, she had cited Proverbs 29:25, &quot;The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.&quot; The court was not interested in her distinction between public and private statements.

At the end of the first day of the trial, Winthrop recorded, &quot;Mrs. Hutchinson, the court you see hath labored to bring you to acknowledge the error of your way that so you might be reduced. The time now grows late. We shall therefore give you a little more time to consider of it and therefore desire that you attend the court again in the morning.&quot; The first day had gone fairly well for Hutchinson, who had held her own in a battle of wits with the magistrates. Biographer Eve LaPlante suggests, &quot;Her success before the court may have astonished her judges, but it was no surprise to her. She was confident of herself and her intellectual tools, largely because of the intimacy she felt with God.&quot;

==== Civil trial: day 2 ====
During the morning of the second day of the trial, it appeared that Hutchinson had been given some legal counsel the previous evening, and she had more to say. She continued to criticise the ministers of violating their mandate of confidentiality. She said that they had deceived the court by not telling about her reluctance to share her thoughts with them. She insisted that the ministers testify under oath, which they were hesitant to do. Magistrate Simon Bradstreet said that &quot;she would make the ministers sin if they said something mistaken under oath&quot;, but she answered that if they were going to accuse her, &quot;I desire it may be upon oath.&quot; As a matter of due process, the ministers would have to be sworn in, but would agree to do so only if the defence witnesses spoke first.

There were three such witnesses, all from the Boston church: deacon John Coggeshall, lay leader Thomas Leverett, and minister John Cotton. The first two witnesses made brief statements that had little effect on the court, but Cotton was questioned extensively. When Cotton testified, he tended not to remember many events of the October meeting, and attempted to soften the meaning of statements that Hutchinson was being accused of. He stressed that the ministers were not as upset about any Hutchinson remarks at the end of the October meeting as they appeared to be later. Dudley reiterated that Hutchinson had told the ministers that they were not able ministers of the New Testament; Cotton replied that he did not remember her saying that.

There was more parrying between Cotton and the court, but the exchanges were not picked up in the transcript of the proceedings. Hutchinson asked the court for leave to &quot;give you the ground of what I know to be true.&quot; She then addressed the court with her own judgment:

This was the &quot;dramatic high point of the most analyzed event of the free grace controversy&quot;, wrote historian Michael Winship. Historians have given a variety of reasons for this statement, including an &quot;exultant impulse&quot;, &quot;hysteria&quot;, &quot;cracking under the strain of the inquest&quot;, and being &quot;possessed of the Spirit&quot;. Winship, citing the work of historian Mary Beth Norton, suggests that Hutchinson consciously decided to explain why she knew that the divines of the colony were not able ministers of the New Testament. This was &quot;not histrionics, but pedagogy,&quot; according to Winship; it was Hutchinson&#x27;s attempt to teach the Court, and doing so was consistent with her character.

==== Civil trial: verdict ====
Hutchinson simplified the task of her opponents, whose prosecution had been somewhat shaky. Her revelation was considered not only seditious, but also in contempt of court. Cotton was pressed by Dudley on whether or not he supported Hutchinson&#x27;s revelation; he said that he could find theological justification for it. Cotton may have still been angry over the zeal with which some opponents had come after the dissidents within his congregation. Winthrop was not interested in this quibbling, though; he was using Hutchinson&#x27;s bold assertions to lead the court in the direction of rewriting history, according to the historical interpretations of Winship. Many of the Puritans had been convinced that there was a single destructive prophetic figure behind all of the difficulties that the colony had been having, and Hutchinson had just become the culprit. Winthrop addressed the court, &quot;if therefore it be the mind of the court, looking at [her] as the principal cause of all our trouble, that they would now consider what is to be done with her.&quot;

The Bostonians made a final effort to slow the proceedings. William Coddington rose, asserting, &quot;I do not see any clear witness against her, and you know it is a rule of the court that no man may be a judge and an accuser too,&quot; ending with, &quot;Here is no law of God that she hath broken nor any law of the country that she hath broke, and therefore deserve no censure.&quot; The court wanted a sentence but could not proceed until some of the ministers spoke. Three of the ministers were sworn in, and each testified against Hutchinson. Winthrop moved to have her banished; in the ensuing tally, only the Boston deputies voted against conviction. Hutchinson challenged the sentence&#x27;s legitimacy, saying, &quot;I desire to know wherefore I am banished.&quot; Winthrop responded, &quot;The court knows wherefore and is satisfied.&quot;

Hutchinson was called a heretic and an instrument of the devil, and was condemned to banishment by the Court &quot;as being a woman not fit for our society&quot;. The Puritans sincerely believed that, in banishing Hutchinson, they were protecting God&#x27;s eternal truth. Winthrop summed up the case with genuine feeling:
==== Detention ====
Following her civil trial, Hutchinson was put under house arrest and ordered to be gone by the end of the following March. In the interim, she was not allowed to return home, but was detained at the house of Joseph Weld, brother of the Reverend Thomas Weld, located in Roxbury, about two miles from her home in Boston. The distance was not great, yet Hutchinson was rarely able to see her children because of the weather, which was particularly harsh that winter. Winthrop referred to Hutchinson as &quot;the prisoner&quot; and was determined to keep her isolated so that others would not be inspired by her, according to LaPlante. She was frequently visited by various ministers, whose intent, according to LaPlante, was to reform her thinking but also to collect evidence against her. Thomas Shepard was there to &quot;collect errors&quot;, and concluded that she was a dangerous woman. Shepard and the other ministers who visited her drafted a list of her theological errors and presented them to the Boston church, which decided that she should stand trial for these views.

==== Church trial ====
Hutchinson was called to trial on Thursday, 15 March 1638, weary and in poor health following a four-month detention. The trial took place at her home church in Boston, though many of her supporters were gone. Her husband and other friends had already left the colony to prepare a new place to live. Her only family members present were her oldest son Edward and his wife, her daughter Faith and son-in-law Thomas Savage, and her sister Katherine with her husband Richard Scott.

The ministers intended to defend their orthodox doctrine and to examine Hutchinson&#x27;s theological errors. Ruling elder Thomas Leverett was charged with managing the examination. He called Hutchinson and read the numerous errors with which she had been charged, and a nine-hour interrogation followed in which the ministers delved into some weighty points of theology. At the end of the session, only four of the many errors were covered, and Cotton was put in the uncomfortable position of delivering the admonition to his admirer. He said, &quot;I would speake it to Gods Glory [that] you have bine an Instrument of doing some good amongst us... he hath given you a sharp apprehension, a ready utterance and abilitie to exprese yourselfe in the Cause of God.&quot; The ministers overwhelmingly concluded that Hutchinson&#x27;s unsound beliefs outweighed all the good which she had done, and that she endangered the spiritual welfare of the community. 
Cotton continued,

Here Cotton was making a link between Hutchinson&#x27;s theological ideas and the behavior antinomians and familists had been accused of, or associated with. He concluded:

With this, Hutchinson was instructed to return in one week on the next lecture day.

Cotton had not yet given up on his parishioner. With the permission of the court, Hutchinson was allowed to spend the week at his home, where the recently arrived Reverend John Davenport was also staying. All week, the two ministers worked with her and, under their supervision, she wrote out a formal recantation of her unsound opinions that had formerly brought objection. Hutchinson stood at the next meeting on Thursday, 22 March and read her recantation in a subdued voice to the congregation. She admitted to having been wrong about the soul and spirit, wrong about the resurrection of the body, wrong in prophesying the destruction of the colony, and wrong in her demeanour toward the ministers, and she agreed that sanctification could be evidence of justification (what she called a &quot;covenant of works&quot;) &quot;as it flowes from Christ and is witnessed to us by the Spirit&quot;. Had the trial ended there, she would likely have remained in good standing with the Boston church, and had the possibility of returning some day.

Wilson explored an accusation made by Shepard at the end of the previous meeting, and new words brought on new assaults. The outcome of her trial was uncertain following the first day&#x27;s grilling, but her downfall came when she would not acknowledge that she held certain theological errors before her four-month imprisonment. With this, she was accused of lying but, even at this point, Winthrop and a few of the ministers wanted her soul redeemed because of her significant evangelical work before she &quot;set forth her owne stuffe&quot;. To these sentiments, Shepard vehemently argued that Hutchinson was a &quot;Notorious Imposter&quot; in whose heart there was never any grace. He admonished the &quot;heinousness of her lying&quot; during a time of supposed humiliation.

Shepard had swayed the proceedings, with Cotton signalling that he had given up on her, and her sentence was presented by Wilson:

Hutchinson was now banished from the colony and removed from the congregation, and her leading supporters had been given three months to leave the colony, including Coddington and Coggeshall, while others were disenfranchised or dismissed from their churches. The court in November had ordered that 58 citizens of Boston and 17 from adjacent towns be disarmed unless they repudiated the &quot;seditious label&quot; given them, and many of these people followed Hutchinson into exile.

== Rhode Island ==
During Hutchinson&#x27;s imprisonment, several of her supporters prepared to leave the colony and settle elsewhere. One such group of men, including her husband Will, met on 7 March 1638 at the home of wealthy Boston merchant William Coddington. Ultimately, 23 men signed what is known as the Portsmouth Compact, forming themselves into a &quot;Bodie Politick&quot; and electing Coddington as their governor, but giving him the Biblical title of &quot;judge&quot;. Nineteen of the signers initially planned to move to New Jersey or Long Island, but Roger Williams convinced them to settle in the area of his Providence Plantations settlement. Coddington purchased Aquidneck Island (later named Rhode Island) in the Narragansett Bay from the Narragansetts, and the settlement of Pocasset was founded (soon renamed Portsmouth). Anne Hutchinson followed in April, after the conclusion of her church trial.

Hutchinson, her children, and others accompanying her travelled for more than six days by foot in the April snow to get from Boston to Roger Williams&#x27; settlement at Providence. They took boats to get to Aquidneck Island, where many men had gone ahead of them to begin constructing houses. In the second week of April, she reunited with her husband, from whom she had been separated for nearly six months.

=== Final pregnancy ===
Hutchinson went into labour in May 1638, following the stress of her trial, her imprisonment all winter, and the difficult trip to Aquidneck Island. She delivered what her doctor John Clarke described as a handful of transparent grapes. This is known now as a hydatidiform mole, a condition occurring most often in women over 45, resulting from one or two sperm cells fertilising a blighted egg. Hutchinson had been ill most of the winter, with unusual weakness, throbbing headaches, and bouts of vomiting. Most writers on the subject agree that she had been pregnant during her trial. Historian Emery Battis, citing expert opinion, suggests that she may not have been pregnant at all during that time, but displaying acute symptoms of menopause. The following April after reuniting with her husband, she became pregnant, only to miscarry the hydatidiform mole. A woman could have had severe menopausal symptoms who had undergone a continuous cycle of pregnancies, deliveries, and lactations for 25 years, with the burdens of raising a large family and subjected to the extreme stress of her trials.

The Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony gloated over Hutchinson&#x27;s suffering and also that of Mary Dyer, a follower who had the premature and stillbirth of a severely deformed infant. The leaders classified the women&#x27;s misfortunes as the judgment of God. Winthrop wrote, &quot;She brought forth not one, but thirty monstrous births or thereabouts&quot;, then continued, &quot;see how the wisdom of God fitted this judgment to her sin every way, for look—as she had vented misshapen opinions, so she must bring forth deformed monsters.&quot; Massachusetts continued to persecute Hutchinson&#x27;s followers who stayed in the Boston area. Laymen were sent from the Boston church to Portsmouth to convince Hutchinson of her errors; she shouted at them, &quot;the Church at Boston? I know no such church, neither will I own it. Call it the whore and strumpet of Boston, but no Church of Christ!&quot;

=== Dissension in government ===
Less than a year after Pocasset was settled, it suffered rifts and civil difficulties. Coddington had openly supported Hutchinson following her trial, but he had become autocratic and began to alienate his fellow settlers. Early in 1639, Hutchinson became acquainted with Samuel Gorton, who attacked the legitimacy of the magistrates. On 28 April 1639, Gorton and a dozen other men ejected Coddington from power. Hutchinson may not have supported this rebellion, but her husband was chosen as the new governor. Two days later, over 30 men signed a document forming a new &quot;civil body politic&quot;. Winthrop noted in his journal that at Aquidneck,

Coddington and several others left the colony, establishing the settlement of Newport at the south end of the island. The freemen of Pocasset changed the name of their town to Portsmouth. They adopted a new government which provided for trial by jury and separation of church and state. The men who accompanied Coddington to Newport tended to be the strongest leaders; several became presidents or governors of the entire united colony after 1646, such as Coggeshall, Nicholas Easton, William Brenton, Jeremy Clarke, and Henry Bull. On 12 March 1640, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport agreed to re-unite. Coddington became governor of the island, and William Hutchinson was chosen as one of his assistants. The towns were to remain autonomous with laws made by the citizens.

During her tenure in Portsmouth, Hutchinson developed a new philosophy concerning religion. She persuaded her husband to resign from his position as a magistrate, as Roger Williams put it, &quot;because of the opinion, which she had newly taken up, of the unlawfulness of magistracy.&quot;

Hutchinson&#x27;s husband William died some time after June 1641 at the age of 55, the same age at which Anne&#x27;s father had died. He was buried in Portsmouth. No record of his death exists because there was no established church, which would have been the customary repository for such records.

Not long after the settlement of Aquidneck Island, the Massachusetts Bay Colony made some serious threats to annex the island and the entire Narragansett Bay area, causing Hutchinson and other settlers much anxiety. This compelled her to move totally out of the reach of the Bay colony and its sister colonies in Connecticut and New Haven and move into the jurisdiction of the Dutch. Hutchinson went to New Netherland some time after the summer of 1642 with seven of her children, a son-in-law, and several servants—16 total persons by several accounts. There they settled near an ancient landmark called Split Rock, not far from what became the Hutchinson River in northern Bronx, New York City. Other Rhode Island families were in the area, including the Throckmortons and the Cornells. By one account, Hutchinson bought her land from John Throckmorton (for whom Throggs Neck is named) who had earlier been a settler of Providence with Roger Williams, but was now living in New Netherland.

The Hutchinsons stayed temporarily in an abandoned house while a permanent house was being built with the help of James Sands, who had married Katherine Walker, a granddaughter of William Hutchinson&#x27;s brother Edward. Sands later became a settler of Block Island (later New Shoreham, Rhode Island), and the Reverend Samuel Niles, another early settler of Block Island, recorded the following about Sands&#x27; experience in New Netherland:

Thus the natives gave overt clues that they were displeased with the settlement being formed there. The property had supposedly been secured by an agent of the Dutch West India Company in 1640, but the negotiation was transacted with members of the Siwanoy people in distant Norwalk, and the local natives likely had little to do with that transaction, if they even knew of it at all. Hutchinson was therefore taking a considerable risk in putting a permanent dwelling at this site.

The exact location of the Hutchinson house has been a source of great interest for several centuries. LaPlante hints in her biography of Hutchinson that the homestead was near the Indian Trail that went through modern-day Pelham Bay Park, on the east side of the Hutchinson River. Lockwood Barr offers another hypothesis, citing the extensive land title research of Otto Hufeland published by the Westchester Historical Society in 1929. He concluded that the site of the homestead was on the west side of the Hutchinson River in Eastchester. A map in Barr&#x27;s book that appeared in the 1929 work shows the property bordering the river in an area that is now called Baychester, between two creeks called Rattlesnake Brook and Black Dog Brook. This area of the Bronx is now highly developed; Rattlesnake Brook is extant, mostly in underground culverts, but Black Dog Brook is defunct.

=== Death ===
The Hutchinsons&#x27; settlement in this area coincided with the local unrest between the colonists and the Indians. The Director of New Netherland, Willem Kieft, had aroused the ire of the Indians by ordering attacks on their settlements in an effort to drive them from the region. Mrs. Hutchinson had a favourable relationship with the Narragansetts in Rhode Island, and she may have felt a false sense of safety among the Siwanoy of New Netherland. The Hutchinsons had been friendly to them, but the Indians diminished the New Netherland colony in a series of incidents known as Kieft&#x27;s War. The fate of the Hutchinson family was summarised by LaPlante:

The warriors then dragged the bodies into the house, along with the cattle, and burned the house to the ground. During the attack, Hutchinson&#x27;s nine-year-old daughter Susanna was out picking blueberries; she was found, according to legend, hidden in the crevice of Split Rock nearby. She is believed to have had red hair, which was unusual to the Indians, and perhaps because of this curiosity her life was spared. She was taken captive, was named &quot;Autumn Leaf&quot; by one account, and lived with the Indians for two to six years (accounts vary) until ransomed back to her family members, most of whom were living in Boston.

The exact date of the Hutchinson massacre is not known. The first definitive record of the occurrence was in John Winthrop&#x27;s journal, where it was the first entry made for the month of September, though not dated. It took days or even weeks for Winthrop to receive the news, so the event almost certainly occurred in August 1643, and this is the date found in most sources.

The reaction in Massachusetts to Hutchinson&#x27;s death was harsh. The Reverend Thomas Weld wrote, &quot;The Lord heard our groans to heaven, and freed us from our great and sore affliction... I never heard that the Indians in those parts did ever before this commit the like outrage upon any one family or families; and therefore God&#x27;s hand is the more apparently seen herein, to pick out this woeful woman&quot;. Peter Bulkley, the pastor at Concord, wrote, &quot;Let her damned heresies, and the just vengeance of God, by which she perished, terrify all her seduced followers from having any more to do with her leaven.&quot;

Wampage claimed to have slain Hutchinson, and legend has it that he assumed her name after the massacre, calling himself &quot;Anne Hoeck&quot; to be honored by using the name of his most famous victim. Eleven years after the event, he confirmed a deed transferring the Hutchinsons&#x27; property to Thomas Pell, with his name on the document being given as &quot;Ann Hoeck alias Wampage.&quot;

== Historical impact ==
Hutchinson claimed that she was a prophetess, receiving direct revelation from God. In this capacity, she prophesied during her trial that God would send judgment upon the Massachusetts Bay Colony and would wipe it from existence. She further taught her followers that personal revelation from God was as authoritative in a person&#x27;s life as the Bible, a teaching that was antithetical to Puritan theology. She also claimed that she could identify &quot;the elect&quot; among the colonists. These positions ultimately caused John Cotton, John Winthrop, and other former friends to view her as an antinomian heretic.

According to modern historian Michael Winship, Hutchinson is famous, not so much for what she did or said during the Antinomian Controversy, but for what John Winthrop made of her in his journal and in his account of the controversy called the &quot;Short Story&quot;. According to Winship, Hutchinson became the reason in Winthrop&#x27;s mind for all of the difficulties the colony had experienced, though unfairly, and with her departure, any other lingering issues were swept under the carpet. Winthrop&#x27;s account has given Hutchinson near legendary status and, as with all legends, what she stood for has shifted over the centuries. Winthrop described her as &quot;a woman of ready wit and bold spirit&quot;. In the words of Winship, to Winthrop, Hutchinson was a &quot;hell-spawned agent of destructive anarchy&quot;. The close relationship between church and state in Massachusetts Bay meant that a challenge to the ministers was interpreted as challenge to established authority of all kinds. To 19th century America, she was a crusader for religious liberty, as the nation celebrated its new achievement of the separation of church and state. Finally, in the 20th century, she became a feminist leader, credited with terrifying the patriarchs, not because of her religious views but because she was an assertive woman. According to feminist Amy Lang, Hutchinson failed to understand that &quot;the force of the female heretic vastly exceeds her heresy&quot;. Lang argues that it was difficult for the court to pin a crime on her; her true crime in their eyes, according to Lang&#x27;s interpretation, was the violation of her role in Puritan society, and she was condemned for undertaking the roles of teacher, minister, magistrate, and husband. (However, the Puritans themselves stated that the threat which they perceived was entirely theological, and no direct mention was ever made to indicate that they were threatened by her gender.)

Winship calls Hutchinson &quot;a prophet, spiritual adviser, mother of fifteen, and important participant in a fierce religious controversy that shook the infant Massachusetts Bay Colony from 1636 to 1638&quot;, upheld as a symbol of religious freedom, liberal thinking, and Christian feminism. Anne Hutchinson is a contentious figure, having been lionised, mythologised, and demonised by various writers. In particular, historians and other observers have interpreted and re-interpreted her life within the following frameworks: the status of women, power struggles within the Church, and a similar struggle within the secular political structure. As to her overall historical impact, Winship writes, &quot;Hutchinson&#x27;s well-publicized trials and the attendant accusations against her made her the most famous, or infamous, English woman in colonial American history.&quot;

== Memorials and legacy ==
In front of the State House in Boston, Massachusetts, stands a statue of Anne Hutchinson with her daughter Susanna as a child by Cyrus Dallin. The statue, dedicated in 1922, has an inscription on the marble pediment that reads:

In memory of

Anne Marbury Hutchinson

Baptized at Alford

Lincolnshire England

20 July 1595 

Killed by the Indians

at East Chester New York 1643

Courageous exponent

of civil liberty

and religious toleration

The memorial is featured on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail. Dallin also used this image in the Signing of the Mayflower Compact bas relief in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

Another memorial to Hutchinson was erected south of Boston in Quincy, Massachusetts, at the corner of Beale Street and Grandview Avenue. This is near the location where the Hutchinsons owned a farm with a house, and this is where they stayed for several days in early spring 1638 while making the trip from Boston to their new home on Aquidneck Island.

There is also an Anne Hutchinson memorial in Founders&#x27; Brook Park in Portsmouth, RI. The park features marble stones inscribed with quotes taken from Hutchinson&#x27;s trial.

Anne Hutchinson was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1994.

=== Literary works ===
According to Hutchinson biographer Eve LaPlante, some literary critics trace the character of Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; to Hutchinson&#x27;s persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Historian Amy Lang wrote that Hester Prynne was the embodiment of a fictional Anne Hutchinson—a Hutchinson created by the early Puritan chroniclers. Lang notes that Hester was what orthodox Puritans said Hutchinson was, either in reality or at least spiritually. The parallel is that Hutchinson was the heretic who metaphorically seduced the Puritan community, while in Hawthorne&#x27;s novel Hester Prynne literally seduced the minister of her community.

Hawthorne noted that &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; was inspired by John Neal&#x27;s 1828 novel &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot;, in which Hutchinson&#x27;s fictional granddaughter is a victim of the Salem witch trials. Hutchinson appears in the opening chapters as a martyr connected to the later martyrs of the witch hysteria.

Anne Hutchinson and her political struggle with Governor Winthrop are depicted in the 1980 play &quot;Goodly Creatures&quot; by William Gibson. Other notable historical characters who appear in the play are Reverend John Cotton, Governor Harry Vane, and future Quaker martyr Mary Dyer. In January 2014, Dan Shore&#x27;s opera &quot;Anne Hutchinson&quot;, with libretto by William A. Fregosi and Fritz Bell, was performed twice in Boston, Massachusetts, by the Intermezzo Opera Company.

=== Namesakes ===
In southern New York, Hutchinson&#x27;s most prominent namesakes are the Hutchinson River, one of the few rivers named after a woman; the Hutchinson River Parkway was in turn named for the river. Elementary schools are named for her, such as in the Westchester County towns of Pelham and Eastchester.

In Portsmouth, Rhode Island, Anne Hutchinson and her friend Mary Dyer, the Quaker martyr, have been remembered at Founders Brook Park with the Anne Hutchinson/Mary Dyer Memorial Herb Garden, a medicinal botanical garden set by a scenic waterfall and historical marker for the early settlement of Portsmouth. The garden was created by artist and herbalist Michael Steven Ford, who is a descendant of both women. The memorial was a grass-roots effort by a local Newport organisation, the Anne Hutchinson Memorial Committee headed by Newport artist Valerie Debrule. The organization is called Friends of Anne Hutchinson; it meets annually at the memorial in Portsmouth on the Sunday nearest to 20 July, the date of Anne&#x27;s baptism, to celebrate her life and the local colonial history of the women of Aquidneck Island. Hutchinson Hall, an underclassman residence hall at the University of Rhode Island, is named in her honour.

Riffing off of commentary from her contemporary detractors, Anne has been embodied as a stand-up comedy act weaving current events and history into &quot;licentious&quot; walking tours and stage shows done in drag centered in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

=== Pardon ===
In 1987, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis pardoned Anne Hutchinson, revoking the order of banishment by Governor Winthrop 350 years earlier.

== Family ==
=== Immediate family ===
Anne and William Hutchinson had 15 children, all of them born and baptised in Alford except for the last child, who was baptised in Boston, Massachusetts. Of the 14 children born in England, 11 lived to sail to New England.

The oldest child Edward was baptised 28 May 1613. He signed the Portsmouth Compact and settled on Aquidneck Island with his parents, but he soon made peace with the Massachusetts authorities and returned to Boston. He was an officer in the colonial militia, and died from wounds received during King Philip&#x27;s War. Susanna was baptised 4 September 1614 and died in Alford during the plague in 1630. Richard (baptised 8 December 1615) was admitted to the Boston church in 1634, but he returned to England and no further record has been found. Faith (baptised 14 August 1617) married Thomas Savage and lived in Boston, dying about 1651. Bridget (baptised 15 January 1618/9) married John Sanford and lived in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, where her husband was briefly governor of the island; after his death she became the third wife of William Phillips and had three sons, John Samuel and William. She died by 1698.

Francis (baptised 24 December 1620) was the oldest of the children to perish in the massacre in New Netherland. Elizabeth (baptised 17 February 1621/2) died during the plague in Alford and was buried there on 4 October 1630. William (baptised 22 June 1623) died during infancy. Samuel (baptised 17 December 1624) lived in Boston, married, and had a child, but left behind few records. Anne (baptised 5 May 1626) married William Collins, and both of them went to New Netherland and perished in the massacre with her mother. Mary (baptised 22 February 1627/8), Katherine (baptised 7 February 1629/30), William (baptised 28 September 1631), and daughter Zuriel (baptised in Boston 13 March 1635/6) were all children when they went with their mother to New Netherland, and were killed during the Indian massacre in the late summer of 1643. Susanna was the 14th child of the Hutchinsons and the youngest born in England, baptised 15 November 1633. She survived the Indian attack in 1643, was taken captive, and eventually traded to the English, after which she married John Cole and had 11 children with him.

Of Hutchinson&#x27;s dozen or more siblings who survived childhood, only one other came to New England; her youngest sister, Katherine, the wife of Richard Scott, came to Boston and then Providence. With her husband, Katherine was a Puritan, Baptist, and then Quaker, and was whipped in Boston for supporting her future son-in-law Christopher Holder who had his right ear cut off for his Quaker evangelism.

=== Descendants ===
A number of Anne Hutchinson&#x27;s descendants have reached great prominence. Among them are United States Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush, as are presidential aspirants Stephen A. Douglas, George W. Romney, and Mitt Romney. Her grandson Peleg Sanford was a governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Other descendants include Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Melville Weston Fuller and Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.; Lord Chancellor of England John Singleton Copley Jr., who was the first Lord Lyndhurst; President of Harvard University Charles William Eliot; actor Ted Danson; Musician Kaitlyn ni Donovan; and opera singer and socialite Madam Lillie Fay Moulton De Hegermann-Lindencrone. One descendant bearing the Hutchinson name was her great-great-grandson Thomas Hutchinson, who was a loyalist Governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay at the time of the Boston Tea Party, an event leading to the American Revolutionary War.

=== Ancestry ===
In 1914, John Champlin published the bulk of the currently known ancestry of Anne Hutchinson. Gary Boyd Roberts and others have published her line of descent on her mother&#x27;s side. Most of the material in the following ancestor chart is from Champlin, except for the Williamson line which was published in &quot;The American Genealogist&quot; by F. N. Craig in 1992.

<text>The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) is a federally funded research and development center of the United States National Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc. for the purpose of radio astronomy. NRAO designs, builds, and operates its own high-sensitivity radio telescopes for use by scientists around the world.

==Locations==
===Charlottesville, Virginia===
The NRAO headquarters is located on the campus of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. The North American ALMA Science Center and the NRAO Technology Center and Central Development Laboratory are also in Charlottesville.

===Green Bank, West Virginia===

NRAO was, until October 2016, the operator of the world&#x27;s largest fully steerable radio telescope, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, which stands near Green Bank, West Virginia. The observatory contains several other telescopes, among them the telescope that utilizes an equatorial mount uncommon for radio telescopes, three telescopes forming the Green Bank Interferometer, a telescope used by school groups and organizations for small scale research, a fixed radio &quot;horn&quot; built to observe the radio source Cassiopeia A, as well as a reproduction of the original antenna built by Karl Jansky while he worked for Bell Labs to detect the interference that was discovered to be previously unknown natural radio waves emitted by the universe.

Green Bank is in the National Radio Quiet Zone, which is coordinated by NRAO for protection of the Green Bank site as well as the Sugar Grove Station monitoring site operated by the NSA. The zone consists of a piece of land where fixed transmitters must coordinate their emissions before a license is granted. The land was set aside by the Federal Communications Commission in 1958. No fixed radio transmitters are allowed within the area closest to the telescope. All other fixed radio transmitters including TV and radio towers inside the zone are required to transmit such that interference at the antennas is minimized by methods including limited power and using highly directional antennas. With the advent of wireless technology and microprocessors in everything from cameras to cars, it is difficult to keep the sites free of radio interference. To aid in limiting outside interference, the area surrounding the Green Bank Observatory was at one time planted with pines characterized by needles of a certain length to block electromagnetic interference at the wavelengths used by the observatory. At one point, the observatory faced the problem of North American flying squirrels tagged with United States Fish and Wildlife Service telemetry transmitters. Electric fences, electric blankets, faulty automobile electronics, and other radio wave emitters have caused great trouble for the astronomers in Green Bank. All vehicles on the premises are powered by diesel motors to minimize interference by ignition systems.
Until its collapse on November 15, 1988, a 300 ft radio telescope stood at the Green Bank Observatory&#x27;s unique site. It was the largest radio telescope on Earth when it was brought online for its first observation at 12:42 am on September 21, 1962. The telescope&#x27;s first observation was of the remnants of Tycho&#x27;s supernova that had exploded 11 November 1572. Two major overhauls installed a new surface in 1970 to correct for maintenance, snow damage, and warping from its sheer size; then a new, bigger project building was constructed in 1972 that incorporated a Farady cage around the control room itself. The telescope stood at 240 ft in height, weighed 600 tons, had a 2-minute arc accuracy, and had a surface accuracy of ~1 inch. The collapse in 1988 was found to be due to unanticipated stresses which cracked a hidden, yet weight- and stress-supporting steel connector plate, in the support structure of the massive telescope. A cascade failure of the structure occurred at 9:43 pm, causing the entire telescope to implode. The debris from the collapse was cleared by June 1989, and West Virginia Senator Robert C. Byrd would pioneer a campaign in Congress to replace it with the Green Bank Telescope, construction for which began in 1990.

===Socorro, New Mexico===

The NRAO&#x27;s facility in Socorro is the Pete Domenici Array Operations Center (AOC). Located on the New Mexico Tech university campus, the AOC serves as the headquarters for the Very Large Array (VLA), which was the setting for the 1997 movie &quot;Contact&quot;, and is also the control center for the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The ten VLBA telescopes are in Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and eight other sites across the continental United States.

===Tucson, Arizona===
Offices were located on the University of Arizona campus. NRAO formerly operated the 12-Meter Telescope on Kitt Peak. NRAO suspended operations at this telescope and funding was rerouted to the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) instead. The Arizona Radio Observatory now operates the 12-Meter Telescope.

===San Pedro de Atacama, Chile===
The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) site in Chile is at ~ altitude near Cerro Chajnantor in northern Chile. This is about east of the historic village of San Pedro de Atacama, southeast of the mining town of Calama, and about east-northeast of the coastal port of Antofagasta.
==Jansky Prize==
The Karl G. Jansky Lectureship is a prestigious lecture awarded by the board of trustees of the NRAO. The Lectureship is awarded &quot;to recognize outstanding contributions to the advancement of radio astronomy.&quot; Recipients have included Fred Hoyle, Charles Townes, Edward M. Purcell, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Philip Morrison, Vera Rubin, Jocelyn Bell Burnell, Frank J. Low, and Mark Reid. The lecture is delivered in Charlottesville, Green Bank, and in Socorro.

<text>Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden ( ; ; ; ), in English sometimes Appenzell Inner-Rhodes, is one of the 26 cantons forming the Swiss Confederation. It is composed of five districts. The seat of the government and parliament is Appenzell. It is traditionally considered a &quot;half-canton&quot;, the other half being Appenzell Ausserrhoden.

Appenzell Innerrhoden is the smallest canton of Switzerland by population and the second smallest by area. It is located in the north east of the country. Together with the canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden, it forms an enclave within the canton of St. Gallen. The canton is essentially located in the Alpine foothills of the Alpstein massif, culminating at the Säntis.

Appenzell Innerrhoden was part of the historical canton of Appenzell, which was divided into Appenzell Ausserrhoden (Protestant) and Appenzell Innerrhoden (Catholic) in 1597 as a result of the Swiss Reformation.

==History==

===Foundation===
The name &quot;Appenzell&quot; () means &quot;cell (i.e. estate) of the abbot&quot;. This refers to the Abbey of St. Gall, which exerted a great influence on the area. By the middle of the 11th century the abbots of St. Gall had established their power in the land later called Appenzell, which, too, became thoroughly Teutonized, its early inhabitants having probably been Romanized Raetians.

By about 1360, conflicts over grazing rights, taxes, and tithes were causing concern for both the abbot and the farmers of Appenzell. Both parties wanted to protect their rights and interests by joining the new Swabian League. In 1377 Appenzell was allowed to join the League with the support of the cities of Konstanz and St. Gallen (the city of St. Gallen was often at odds with the neighboring Abbey of St. Gall). With the support of the League, Appenzell refused to pay many of the gifts and tithes that the Abbot Kuno von Stoffeln demanded. In response to the loss of revenue from his estates, Kuno approached the Austrian House of Habsburg for help. In 1392 he made an agreement with the Habsburgs, which was renewed in 1402. In response, in 1401 Appenzell entered into an alliance with the city of St. Gallen to protect their rights and freedom.

===Independence and joining the Swiss Confederation===
Following increasing conflicts between the Appenzellers and the abbot&#x27;s agents, including the bailiff of Appenzell demanding that a dead body be dug up because he wanted the man&#x27;s clothes, the Appenzellers planned an uprising. On a pre-arranged day, throughout the abbot&#x27;s lands, they attacked the bailiffs and drove them out of the land. Following unsuccessful negotiations Appenzell and St. Gallen entered into a treaty, which marked a break between the abbot and his estates. Perhaps fearing the Habsburgs, in 1402 the League expelled Appenzell. During the same year, St. Gallen reached an agreement with the abbot, and Appenzell could no longer count on St. Gallen&#x27;s support. Appenzell declared itself ready to stand against the abbot, and in 1403 formed an alliance with the canton of Schwyz, a member of the Old Swiss Confederation that had defeated the Austrians in the previous century. Glarus provided less support, but authorized any citizen who wished to support Appenzell to do so. In response, the League raised an army and marched to St. Gallen before heading toward Appenzell. On 15 May 1403, they entered the pass leading to Speicher and outside the village of Vögelinsegg met the Appenzell army. A small force of Appenzell and Confederation troops defeated the League army and the two sides signed a short-lived peace treaty.

Following another Appenzell victory on 17 June 1405, at Stoss Pass on the border of Appenzell town, the new canton continued to expand. During the expansion, Appenzell even captured the abbot of St. Gall and in response they were excommunicated by the Bishop of Constance.

However, while the &quot;Bund&quot; expanded, the Austrians used the peace to regain their strength. On 11 September 1406 an association of nobles formed a knightly order known as the &quot;Sankt Jörgenschild&quot; (Order of St. George&#x27;s Shield) to oppose the rebellious commoners of the &quot;Bund&quot;. Following a defeat at Bregenz, Appenzell was unable to hold the &quot;Bund&quot; together. The city of St. Gallen and the canton of Schwyz each paid off the Austrians to avoid an attack, and the &quot;Bund&quot; was dissolved by King Rupert of Germany on 4 April 1408.

As part of the peace treaty, the abbot gave up his ownership of Appenzell, but was still owed certain taxes. However, it was not until 1410 that the area was at peace.

In 1411 Appenzell signed a defensive treaty with the entire Swiss Confederation (except Bern), which strengthened their position against the abbot. Appenzell joined the Confederation as an &quot;Associate Member&quot;, and did not become a full member until 1513. Following another battle, in 1429, Appenzell was granted freedom from the obligations in the future. This treaty represented the end of Appenzell&#x27;s last financial tie to the Abbey of St. Gall, and a movement towards closer relationships with the Confederation.

===Division of Appenzell===
Starting in 1522, followers of Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli began to preach the Protestant Reformation in Appenzell. The early reformers had the most success in the outer &quot;Rhoden&quot;, a term that in the singular is said to mean a &quot;clearing&quot;, and occurs in 1070, long before the final separation. Following the initial small success, in 1523 Joachim von Watt (also known as Joachim Vadian) began to preach the reformed version of the Acts of the Apostles to friends and fellow clergy. His preaching brought the Reformation into the forefront of public debate. In October 1523, the Council supported the Protestant principle of scriptural sermons, and on 24 April 1524 the Landsgemeinde confirmed the Cantonal Council&#x27;s decision. However, the work of the Anabaptists in the Appenzell region (as well as in Zürich and St. Gallen) in 1525 led to government crackdowns. The first police action against the Anabaptists took place in June 1525, followed by the Anabaptist Disputation in Teufen in October 1529.

To end the confrontation between the old and new faiths, the Landesgemeinde decided in April 1525 that each parish should choose a faith, but that the principle of free movement would be supported, so that the religious minority could attend the church of their choice regardless of where they lived. The entire Appenzell Ausserrhoden converted to the Reformation in 1529. The Innerrhoden remained with the old faith. While the majority of the residents of Appenzell town remained Catholic under Pastor Diepolt Huter, there was a strong Reformed minority. In 1531, the minority were nearly successful in getting the town to ally with the Protestant Ausserrhoden. But an armed mob of angry residents from the neighboring village of Gonten prevented the abolition of the Mass in Appenzell. The Catholic victory in the Second War of Kappel in 1531 ended plans for a reformation of the entire Canton of Appenzell.

After the Second War of Kappel, the two religions reached a generally peaceful parity. They remained united by common business interests, the same political and legal understanding, a shared desire to form an alliance with France and a shared opposition to the city of St. Gallen. This shared opposition to St. Gallen was demonstrated in the so-called linen affairs (1535–42, 1579), in which the weavers throughout Appenzell supported each other when they felt that they were unfairly treated by the linen industry of St. Gallen.

From 1798 to 1803 Appenzell, with the other domains of the abbot of St Gall, was formed into the canton of Säntis of the Helvetic Republic, but in 1803, on the creation of the new canton of St. Gall, shrank back within its former boundaries.

===Modern history===

Appenzell Innerrhoden has voted against each new Constitution of Switzerland since 1848. The people of the Appenzell Innerrhoden have objected to the trend towards a stronger central government in Switzerland.

Appenzell Innerrhoden was the last canton in Switzerland to grant women the right to vote on local issues, being forced to do so only in 1990 when two women from Appenzell filed a lawsuit in the Swiss Federal Court and won. A centuries-old law forbidding women to vote was changed in 1991, when Switzerland&#x27;s federal court ordered the canton to grant women the right to vote.

Appenzell Innerrhoden was the canton with the smallest percentage of approval votes (at 50.8% compared to the Swiss-wide average of 64.1%) in the &quot;Marriage for All&quot; referendum completed on 26 September 2021, making it the most hesitant canton for equal marriage for gay and lesbian citizens.

==Geography==
Most of the canton is pastoral, despite being largely mountainous. The Säntis peak in the Appenzell Alps is one of the main attractions of the canton. There are three small mountain lakes in the canton: Seealpsee, Sämtisersee and Fälensee.

Two small monasteries (Wonnenstein in Teufen and Grimmenstein in Walzenhausen) are exclaves of the canton in Appenzell Ausserrhoden.

==Politics==
Appenzell is the capital of this canton. The constitution was established in 1872. Citizens from the canton assemble each year on the last Sunday of April for the &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot; (general assembly) in a square in Appenzell; they elect the cantonal government and judiciary, accept the oath of the elected members, and vote on several issues on the agenda; about 4000 citizens usually participate.

In 1991, following a decision by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, Appenzell Innerrhoden became the last Swiss canton to grant women the vote on local issues. It also was the canton with the strongest support (71%) for the minaret ban in the 2009 Swiss minaret referendum and the lowest support (51%) in the 2021 Swiss same-sex marriage referendum.

===Political subdivisions===

In Appenzell Innerrhoden, districts are the lowest administrative division, as the canton has no municipalities (except for the Feuerschaugemeinde, a special-purpose municipality for firefighting, energy and water for the town of Appenzell). The districts are functionally equivalent to municipalities elsewhere in Switzerland, and are generally shown as municipalities on maps etc.

The canton is divided into five districts:
*Appenzell
*Gonten
*Oberegg
*Schlatt-Haslen
*Schwende-Rüte

On 1 May 2022, the former districts of Rüte and Schwende merged to form the new district of Schwende-Rüte.

===Government===

The State Commission (Standeskommission) constitutes the executive government of the canton of Appenzell Inner-Rhodes and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of seven councillors (), each presiding over a department (&quot;Departement&quot;) comprising several offices and bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as an executive president (&quot;regierender Landammann&quot;). In the mandate period (&quot;Legislatur&quot;) 2019 – 2021 the State Commission is presided by &quot;regierender Landammann&quot; Roland Dähler. The &quot;regierende Landammann&quot; and the &quot;stillstehender Landammann&quot; (stationary president) are switched every two years. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the canton&#x27;s parliament, the &quot;Grosse Rat&quot;, and the &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot;, as well as legal judgments are carried by the State Commission. The regular (re-)election of the State Commission by the &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot; is held every year. Any resident of Appenzell Inner-Rhodes allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the State Commission. The assignment of the departments for the &quot;Säckelmeister&quot; (minister of finance), &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot; (country&#x27;s captain), &quot;Bauherr&quot; (minister of building and civil engineering), and &quot;Landesfähnrich&quot; (country&#x27;s ensign) are given by their roles. The departments of education, economics, and health and social services are assigned by the collegiate to the two &quot;Landammänner&quot; and the &quot;Statthalter&quot;.

, Appenzell Inner-Rhodes&#x27; State Commission is made up of two members of the CVP (Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party), one member of the SVP (Swiss People&#x27;s Party), and four independents of whom one is currently also the president. The last regular election (&quot;Landsgemeinde&quot;) was held on 28 April 2019.

===Parliament===
====Landsgemeinde====
Citizens from the canton assemble on the last Sunday of April each year for the &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot; (literally: country&#x27;s assembly) in the central square in Appenzell, elect the cantonal government and judiciary, accept the oath of the elected members, and vote on several issues put forward by the government and/or the parliament. It is presided over by the &quot;regierende Landammann&quot;.

Every Swiss citizen of Appenzell Inner-Rhodes older than 18 has the right to vote and to step onto the &quot;Stuhl&quot; (literally the chair, but in fact the podium) and to debate the election of the proposed members of government and judiciary, or any of the issues to be voted on.

After the State Commission have taken their seats on the &quot;Stuhl&quot; and the &quot;regierende Landammann&quot; opens and welcomes the assembly, (s)he then presents the state bill. Then the discussions are opened. Then the elections and the subsequent oaths take place. Finally the votes on the programmed issues are taken.

====Grosser Rat====
The Grosser Rat or Grand Council is composed of 50 members, elected in the six districts of the canton. In five of the six districts, the election takes place once a year in the annual session of the district equivalent of the Landsgemeinde and therefore takes place in the open. In the other district, Oberegg District, which forms two small exclaves of the canton a few kilometres northeast of the rest, a separate ballot is held in May.

The most important tasks of the Council are providing preliminary advice on the constitutional and legislative proposals to be placed before the Landsgemeinde. Also, the issuing of regulations to enforce the canton&#x27;s legislation and supervision of all the cantonal authorities. The Council reviews and approves the annual financial statements, and sets the budget and the tax rates.

===Federal elections===

* National Council (Nationalrat): Thomas Rechsteiner, 2019
* Council of States (Ständerat): Daniel Fässler, 2019


==Demographics==
The population of the canton (as of ) is . , the population included 1,510 foreigners, or about 9.76% of the total population. Owing to the split of Appenzell along religious lines, the population () is mostly Roman Catholic (81%), with a small Protestant minority (10%).

=== Historical population ===
The historical population is given in the following table:
==Economy==
Cattle breeding and dairy farming are the main agricultural activities: Appenzeller cheese is widely available throughout Switzerland. Somewhat before the early 2000s, the countryside of Appenzell Innerrhoden apparently became popular with nudists, and at the 2009 Landsgemeinde the canton&#x27;s residents voted to prohibit naked hiking. However nudists who appealed against their fines to the federal court have been reimbursed by the local authorities, as nudism is not a crime under Swiss federal law which takes precedence. It is common for cars rented in Switzerland to be registered in Appenzell Innerrhoden, and thus having license plates starting with &quot;AI&quot;, because of the reduced tax on cars in this canton.

<doc id="318495" wikidata="Q349716" url="?curid=318495" title="Willie Anderson (golfer)">
<text>William Law Anderson (21 October 1879 – 25 October 1910) was a Scottish immigrant to the United States who became the first golfer to win four U.S. Opens, with victories in 1901, 1903, 1904, and 1905. He is still the only man to win three consecutive titles, and only Bobby Jones, Ben Hogan, and Jack Nicklaus have equalled his total of four championships. He is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Born in North Berwick, in East Lothian, Scotland, Anderson was educated at the public school in North Berwick and was a licensed caddie on the West Links at the age of 11. Upon leaving school, he apprenticed as a club maker under Alex Aitken in Gullane.

At age 18, Anderson emigrated from Scotland to the United States in March 1896—sailing aboard the S.S. &quot;Poseidon&quot; from Glasgow—along with his father, Thomas Anderson, and his brother Tom, landing at Ellis Island. He played in the U.S. Open the following year, finishing in second place by one stroke, after Joe Lloyd eagled the final hole.

==Golf career==
His first significant win came in 1899 at the Southern California Open, before he started his run at the U.S. Open. In the 14 straight Opens that he played, Anderson won four, was second once, third once, fourth twice, fifth three times, 11th twice and 15th once. He won titles with both the old gutta-percha golf ball, and the rubber-cored ball which came into use in 1902. Anderson also won the Western Open in 1902, 1904, 1908, and 1909; this tournament, the second-oldest in the U.S., was classified as a PGA Tour event for most of its more than 100 years of operation, and is classified by some golf historians as a major championship during Anderson&#x27;s era.

Anderson&#x27;s accuracy with all clubs, combined with his concentration under pressure, made him a formidable and highly respected competitor. Anderson made his living as a golf professional, working at ten different clubs in fourteen years. He listed the Apawamis Club in Rye, New York as his home course from 1901 through 1906. He played many exhibition challenge matches for stakes, in addition to tournaments.

==Death and legacy==
Anderson died at age 31, officially from epilepsy in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He had played competitive matches in Pennsylvania right up to a few days before his death. However, golf historian Robert Sommers wrote in 1995 that Anderson &#x27;drank himself to death&#x27;. Anderson is buried in Ivy Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

Anderson was an original member of the PGA Hall of Fame, and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1975.

==Major championships==
===Wins (4)===

1 Defeated Alex Smith in an 18-hole playoff: Anderson (85), Smith (86) &lt;br&gt;
2 Defeated David Brown in an 18-hole playoff: Anderson (82), Brown (84)

===Results timeline===
Among the majors, Anderson played in only the U.S. Open.

<doc id="318496" wikidata="Q943930" url="?curid=318496" title="Tommy Armour">
<text>Thomas Dickson Armour (24 September 1896 – 11 September 1968) was a Scottish-born golfer who played primarily in the United States. He was nicknamed The Silver Scot. He was the winner of three of golf&#x27;s major championships: 1927 U.S. Open, 1930 PGA, and 1931 Open Championship. Armour popularized the term &quot;yips&quot;, the colloquial term for a sudden and unexplained loss of skills in experienced athletes.

==Early life==
Armour was born on 24 September 1896 in Edinburgh, Scotland, the son of Martha Dickson and her husband George Armour, a baker. He went to school at Boroughmuir High School, Edinburgh, (formerly Boroughmuir Senior Secondary School) and studied at the University of Edinburgh. During his early golf career, he played at Lothianburn Golf Club near the Pentland Hills. At the outbreak of World War I enlisted with the Black Watch and was a machine-gunner. He rose from private to Staff Major in the Tank Corps. His conduct earned him an audience with George V. However, he lost his sight to a mustard gas explosion and surgeons had to add a metal plate to his head and left arm. During his convalescence, he regained the sight of his right eye, and began playing much more golf.

==Amateur career==
Armour won the 1920 French Amateur tournament. He moved to the United States and met Walter Hagen who gave him a job as secretary of the Westchester-Biltmore Club. In 1920, he won a PGA Tour event, the Pinehurst Fall Pro-Am Bestball, while still an amateur, pairing with professional Leo Diegel.

== Professional career ==
In 1924, he turned professional. Armour won the 1927 U.S. Open, 1930 PGA Championship, and the 1931 Open Championship. With Jim Barnes and Rory McIlroy, he is one of three natives of the United Kingdom to win three different professional majors.

At the Shawnee Open in 1927, Armour scored the first ever &quot;archaeopteryx&quot; (15 or more over par) when he made a 23 on a par 5, for 18 over par. It still stands as the highest score on a hole in PGA history. This historic performance happened just one week after he had won the U.S. Open. This claim is actually disputed. It appears, according to contemporary reports by the New York Times, that Armour actually scored an 11 on hole 17 during the third round of the Shawnee Open.

Armour retired from full-time professional golf after the 1935 season, although he competed periodically in top-class events for several years afterwards. He taught at the Boca Raton Club in Florida from 1926 to 1955, for $50 a lesson. His pupils included Babe Didrikson Zaharias and Lawson Little. He was also a member at the Winged Foot Golf Club in suburban New York City, where he spent much of his summers.

Armour co-wrote a book &quot;How to Play Your Best Golf All the Time&quot; (1953) with Herb Graffis. It became a best-seller and for many years was the biggest-selling book ever authored on golf. A series of 8mm films based on the book was released by Castle Films including Short Game Parts I and II, Long Hitting Clubs, Grip, and Stance.

==Personal life==
Armour became an American citizen in November 1942.

Armour died in Larchmont, New York and was cremated at the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York but not interred there. Some modern golf equipment is still marketed in his name.

Armour is succeeded by his grandson, Tommy Armour III, who is a two-time winner on the PGA Tour.

Armour was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1976.

<text>The Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in Green Bank, West Virginia, US is the world&#x27;s largest fully steerable radio telescope, surpassing the Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope in Germany. The Green Bank site was part of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) until September 30, 2016. Since October 1, 2016, the telescope has been operated by the independent Green Bank Observatory. The telescope&#x27;s name honors the late Senator Robert C. Byrd who represented West Virginia and who pushed the funding of the telescope through Congress.

The Green Bank Telescope operates at meter to millimeter wavelengths. Its 100-meter diameter collecting area, unblocked aperture, and good surface accuracy provide superb sensitivity across the telescope&#x27;s full 0.1–116 GHz operating range. The GBT is fully steerable, and 85 percent of the local celestial hemisphere is accessible. It is used for astronomy about 6500 hours every year, with 2000–3000 hours per year going to high-frequency science. Part of the scientific strength of the GBT is its flexibility and ease of use, allowing for rapid response to new scientific ideas. It is scheduled dynamically to match project needs to the available weather. The GBT is also readily reconfigured with new and experimental hardware. The high-sensitivity mapping capability of the GBT makes it a vital complement to the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, the Expanded Very Large Array, the Very Long Baseline Array, and other high-angular resolution interferometers. Facilities of the Green Bank Observatory are also used for other scientific research, for many programs in education and public outreach, and for training students and teachers.

The telescope began regular science operations in 2001, making it one of the newest astronomical facilities of the US National Science Foundation (NSF). It was constructed following the collapse of a previous telescope at Green Bank, the 300 Foot Radio Telescope, a 90.44 m paraboloid that began observations in October 1961. This previous telescope collapsed on 15 November 1988 due to the failure of a gusset plate in the box girder assembly, which was a key component for the structural integrity of the telescope.

== Location ==
The telescope sits near the heart of the United States National Radio Quiet Zone, a unique area located in the town of Green Bank, West Virginia, where authorities limit all radio transmissions to avoid emissions toward the GBT and the Sugar Grove Station. The location of the telescope within the Radio Quiet Zone allows for the detection of faint radio-frequency signals which human-made signals might otherwise mask. The observatory borders National Forest land, and the Allegheny Mountains shield it from some radio interference.

The telescope&#x27;s location has been the site of important radio astronomy telescopes since 1957. It currently houses seven additional telescopes, and in spite of its somewhat remote location, receives about 40,000 visitors each year.

== Description ==
The structure weighs and is tall. The surface area of the GBT is a 100 by 110 meter active surface with 2,209 actuators (small motors used to adjust the position) for the 2,004 surface panels, making the total collecting area of . The panels are made from aluminum manufactured to a surface accuracy of better than RMS. The actuators adjust the panel positions to compensate for sagging, or bending under its own weight, which changes as the telescope moves. Without this so-called &quot;active surface&quot; adjustment, observations at frequencies above 4 GHz would not be as efficient.

Unusual for a radio telescope, the primary reflector is an off-axis segment of a paraboloid. This is the same design used in smaller (eg., 45-100cm) home satellite television dishes. The asymmetric reflector allows the telescope&#x27;s focal point and feed horn to be located at the side of the dish, so that it and its retractable support boom do not obstruct the incoming radio waves, as occurs in conventional radio telescope designs with the feed located on the telescope&#x27;s beam axis.

The offset support arm houses a prime focus receiver on a retractable boom in front of a subreflector, and a receiver room. For prime focus operation, the boom is extended to position the feed horn in front of the 8 m subreflector. For Gregorian focus operation, the prime focus boom is retracted. The subreflector, positioned by a Stewart platform with 6 degrees of freedom, reflects incoming radio waves toward eight higher-frequency feeds on a rotating turret located on top of the receiver room. The computerized controlled turret can rotate a particular receiver into the position within a few minutes. Operational frequencies range from 290 MHz to 115 GHz.

As an azimuth-elevation mounting telescope, the azimuth adjustments are driven by four trucks with four wheels each on a diameter rail. The 16 thirty-horsepower motors can change azimuth at the rate of up to 40 degrees per minute. Azimuth axis is also supported by a pintle bearing at the center point of the azimuth track.

The elevation wheel structure provides tilting capability to adjust elevations between 5 and 95 degrees. The radius bull gear on the elevation wheel is driven by eight 40 horsepower motors with a capability of changing the elevations up to 20 degrees per minute. The long and diameter elevation shaft provides primary support of the wheel structure. The elevation wheel also contains concrete-filled counterweight to balance with the surface and the feed arm structure.

Because of its height (at 148 meters or 485 feet tall, it is 60% taller than the Statue of Liberty) and bulk (16 million pounds), locals sometimes refer to the GBT as the “Great Big Thing”.

The telescope&#x27;s capabilities include the ngRADAR system which use the dish as a radar transmitting antenna to observe solar system objects such as asteroids.

== Discoveries ==
In 2002, astronomers detected three new millisecond pulsars in the globular cluster Messier 62.

In 2006, several discoveries were announced, including a large coil-shaped magnetic field in the Orion molecular cloud, and a large hydrogen gas superbubble 23,000 light years away, named the Ophiuchus Superbubble.

In 2019, the most massive neutron star PSR J0740+6620 to date was detected. Since 2004, 28 new complex molecules have been discovered in the interstellar medium with the Green Bank Telescope.

== Funding threatened ==
In response to limited budgetary issues, the Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) commissioned a portfolio review committee, which conducted its work between September 2011 and August 2012. The committee, which reviewed all AST-supported facilities and activities, was composed of 17 external scientists and chaired by Daniel Eisenstein of Harvard University. As part of the committee&#x27;s August 2012 recommendation for the closure of six facilities, was that the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) should be defunded over a five-year period.

In July 2014, the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations approved the NSF&#x27;s fiscal year 2014 budget, which did not call for divestment of the GBT in that fiscal year. The facility then began looking for partners to help fund its $10 million annual operating costs.

On October 1, 2016, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank separated from the NSF and began accepting funding from private sources to stay operational as an independent institution, the Green Bank Observatory.

== Relation to Breakthrough Listen ==
The telescope is a key facility of the Breakthrough Listen project, in which it is used to scan for radio signals possibly emitted by extraterrestrial technologies. In late 2017, the telescope was used to scan the interstellar object ʻOumuamua for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence as it passed through the solar system.

<doc id="318500" wikidata="Q253774" url="?curid=318500" title="An Lushan rebellion">
<text>The An Lushan rebellion was a civil war in China that lasted from 755 to 763, at the approximate midpoint of the Tang dynasty (618–907). It began as a commandery rebellion attempting to overthrow and replace the Tang government with the rogue Yan dynasty. The rebels succeeded in capturing the imperial capital Chang&#x27;an after the emperor had fled to Sichuan, but eventually succumbed to internal divisions and counterattacks by the Tang and their allies. The rebellion spanned the reigns of three Tang emperors: Xuanzong, Suzong, and Daizong.

On 16 December 755, An Lushan, the &quot;jiedushi&quot; of the Taiyuan Commandery, mobilized his army and marched to Fanyang. An Lushan led the rebellion for two years before he was assassinated by his son An Qingxu. Two years after An Qingxu&#x27;s ascension, Shi Siming, the governor of Pinglu Commandery and a close ally of An Lushan, killed An Qingxu and usurped the leadership. Shi Siming ruled for two years, but was in turn killed by his own son Shi Chaoyi, who ruled for another two years until the Yan dynasty fell to Tang forces on 17 February 763. There were also other anti-Tang rebel forces, especially those in An Lushan&#x27;s base area in Hebei, as well as Sogdian forces and other opportunist parties who took advantages of the chaos.

The rebellion was an important turning point in the history of medieval China, as the military activities and associated casualties caused significant depopulation from famine, displacement, and large-scale infrastructure destruction, significantly weakening the Tang dynasty, collapsing the prestige of the Tang emperors as the Khan of Heaven and leading to the permanent loss of the Western Regions. Even though the rebellion was ultimately suppressed by a large-scale alliance between the imperial dynasty and various participants, including local militias and foreign support, the dynasty did not overall change the structure of the military committee, but only followed the old principles of establishing territory. It was a direct cause of the dynasty&#x27;s decline, and led to rampant secessionism among regional warlords during the latter half of the dynasty that continued into the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period for decades after the ultimate demise of the Tang. The fear of repeating Tang&#x27;s commandery secessionism also led the Song dynasty that followed to distrust and oppress prominent military commanders even when invaded by hostile foreign states such as Liao, Western Xia and Jin. It also triggered the long-term decline of the Guanzhong region, which had been a political and economic heartland of China at least since the Han dynasty, and a shift of the economic center of China towards the Jiangnan region.

==Background==
===Political===

Beginning in 742, Eurasia entered a 13-year period of major political turmoil, with the regional empires generally suffering &quot;a major rebellion, revolution, or dynastic change.&quot; In this year the Second Turkic Khaganate of the eastern Eurasian Steppe was overthrown and then replaced by Sogdian-influenced Uighur rulers. This was apparently the first of several revolutionary events either led by or intimately connected with the merchants and tradespeople involved with the international commerce often referred to as the Silk Road. In 747, the Abbasids began their rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphate in Merv, Khurasan, resulting in the proclamation of a new Abbasid Caliph in about 750. This rebellion also seems to have been organized by merchants and persons identifying themselves as merchants.

The western expansion of the Tang Empire was checked in 751 by the defeat of a large expeditionary force led by General Gao Xianzhi in the Battle of Talas in the modern Fergana Valley, with the Abbasid victory attributable to the defection of the Karluk Turks in the midst of the battle. However, the Arabs did not proceed any further after the battle, and the Tang retained their Central Asian territories until the An Lushan rebellion.

Further, southern expansion of the Tang was limited by the ineffective, and even disastrous, campaigns against the Kingdom of Nanzhao. However, the concurrent Tang campaign against the Tibetan Empire was proceeding more successfully, with the campaign to capture the Tibetans&#x27; Central Asian territories appearing nearly successful. With the assassination of the Tibetan emperor Me Agtsom in 755 in the midst of a major rebellion within the Tibetan polity, final Tang victory over the Tibetan Empire seemed all but assured. However, back in the increasingly financially challenged Chinese heartland, the Sogdian-Turkic General An Lushan had worked himself into a position of trust with the Tang emperor Xuanzong and his consort Yang Guifei.

===General An Lushan===
An Lushan was a general of uncertain birth origins, but thought to have been adopted by a Sogdian father and Göktürk mother of the Ashina tribe. Eventually he managed to become a favorite of the reigning emperor of China. His success in this regard is shown, for example, by the luxurious house Emperor Xuanzong built for him in 751, in the capital Chang&#x27;an. The house was furnished with luxuries such as gold and silver objects and a pair of by couches appliqued with rare and expensive sandalwood.

He was appointed by Emperor Xuanzong (following the suggestion of Xuanzong&#x27;s favorite concubine Yang Guifei and with the agreement of Chancellor Li Linfu) to be Jiedushi of three garrisons in the north—Pinglu, Fanyang and Hedong. In effect, An was given control over the entire area north of the lower reaches of the Yellow River, including garrisons about 164,000 strong. He took advantage of various circumstances, such as popular discontent with an extravagant Tang court, the synchronous Sogdian-involved Abbasid Revolution against the Umayyad dynasty, and eventually the absence of strong troops guarding the palace coupled with a string of natural disasters. An Lushan was very influential in the Tang court, his close relationship with Emperor Xuanzong led to him being adopted by the imperial concubine Yang Guifei. The positions of power of Yang clan members (the family of the preceding Sui dynasty into which the Tang emperor had married) were important in this situation, especially complicated by the position of Yang Guifei&#x27;s relative Yang Guozhong in the Tang governmental administration.

==Course of the rebellion==
The An Lushan rebellion signaled a period of disorder spanning the reigns of three Tang dynasty emperors, beginning during the final (&quot;Tianbao&quot; era) period of the reign of Xuanzong (8 September 712 to 12 August 756), continuing through the reign of Suzong (12 August 756 to 16 May 762) and ending during the reign of Daizong (18 May 762 to 23 May 779), as well as spanning the four imperial claimants of the failed Yan dynasty.

===Revolt and capture of Luoyang===
At the end of 755 An Lushan revolted. On 16 December, his army surged down from Fanyang (near modern Beijing). Along the way, An Lushan treated surrendered local Tang officials with respect. As a result, more and more of them joined his ranks. He moved rapidly along the Grand Canal and captured the &quot;Eastern Capital&quot; city of Luoyang on 18 January 756, defeating the poorly supplied General Feng Changqing. There, on 5 February, An Lushan declared himself Emperor of the new Great Yan dynasty (). His next steps would be to capture the Tang western capital of Chang&#x27;an and then to attempt to continue into southern China to complete his conquest.

===Battle of Yongqiu===

However, the Battle of Yongqiu, in the spring of 756, went badly for An Lushan. Although his army, under Linghu Chao, was numerous, it was unable to make further territorial gains due to the failure to wrest control of Yongqiu (modern Qi County, Kaifeng, in Henan) and (later) the nearby Suiyang from the Tang defenders led by Zhang Xun. This prevented the Yan forces from conquering southern China, before the Tang were able to recover. The Yan army did not take control of Suiyang until after the Siege of Suiyang (January–October 757), almost two years after their initial capture of Luoyang.

===Advance on Chang&#x27;an===

Originally, An Lushan&#x27;s forces were blocked from the main imperial (or &quot;Western&quot;) capital at Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an), by loyal troops placed in nearly impregnable defensive positions in the intervening high mountain passes of Tongguan. Unfortunately for Chang&#x27;an, the two generals in charge of the troops at Tong Pass, Gao Xianzhi and Feng Changqing, were executed due to a court intrigue involving the powerful eunuch Bian Lingcheng. Yang Guozhong, with grossly inept military judgment, then ordered the replacement General Geshu Han, who was in charge of the troops in the passes, together with reinforcement troops, to attack An&#x27;s army on open ground. On 7 July, the Tang forces were defeated. The road to the capital now lay open.

===Flight of the emperor===
With rebel forces clearly an imminent threat to the imperial seat of Chang&#x27;an, and with conflicting advice from his advisers, Tang emperor Xuanzong determined to flee to the relative sanctuary of Sichuan with its natural protection of mountain ranges so the Tang forces could reorganize and regroup. He brought along the bulk of his court and household. The route of travel from Chang&#x27;an to Sichuan was notoriously difficult, requiring hard travel on the way through the intervening Qin Mountains.

However, the geographical features of the terrain were not the only hardships on the journey: there was a matter that first had to be settled, involving the relationship between Xuanzong and the Yang family, especially the emperor&#x27;s beloved Yang Guifei. So, before progressing more than a few kilometers along the way, an incident occurred at Mawei Inn, in today&#x27;s Xingping in Xianyang, Shaanxi. Xuanzong&#x27;s bodyguard troops were hungry and tired, and very angry with Yang Guozhong for exposing the whole country to danger. They demanded the death of the much-hated Yang Guozhong, and then of his cousin and imperial favorite, Yang Guifei. Soon the angry soldiers killed Yang Guozhong, Yang Xuan (his son), Lady Han and Lady Qin (Yang Guifei&#x27;s sisters). With the army on the verge of mutiny, the Emperor had no choice but to agree, ordering the strangling of Lady Yang. The incident made Xuanzong fear for his own safety, so he fled to Chengdu at once. However, people stopped his horse, not wanting him to go away. So he made the crown prince, Li Heng, stay to hold the fort. Instead, Li Heng fled in the other direction to Lingzhou (today called Lingwu, in Ningxia province). Later, on 12 August, after reaching Sichuan, Xuanzong abdicated (becoming &quot;Taishang Huang&quot;), in favor of the crown prince, who had already been proclaimed emperor.

===Fall of Chang&#x27;an===
In July 756 An Lushan and his rebel forces captured Chang&#x27;an, an event that had a devastating effect upon this thriving metropolis. Before the revolt, estimates put the population within the city walls at from 800,000 to 1,000,000. Including small cities in the vicinity forming the metropolitan area, the census in 742 recorded 362,921 families with 1,960,188 persons. Much of the population fled at the approach of the rebels. Then the city was captured and looted by the rebel forces and the remaining population put in jeopardy.

===A new Tang emperor===

The third son of Xuanzong, Li Heng, was proclaimed Emperor Suzong at Lingzhou (modern-day Lingwu), although another group of local officials and Confucian literati tried to promote a different prince, Li Lin, the Prince of Yong, at Jinling (modern-day Nanjing). One of Suzong&#x27;s first acts as emperor was to appoint the generals Guo Ziyi and Li Guangbi to deal with the rebellion. The generals, after much discussion, decided to borrow troops from an offshoot of the Turkic Tujue tribe, the Huihe, or Huige, also known as the Uyghur Khaganate, who were ruled by Bayanchur Khan until his death in the summer of 759. Three thousand Arab mercenaries were sent by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur to join the Tang in 756 against An Lushan. With Uyghur assistance, the Tang Imperial forces recaptured both Chang&#x27;an and Luoyang in late 757. However, they failed to capture or subdue the rebel troops, who fled to the rebel heartland in the northeast.

Uyghur Khaganate diplomats clashed against Arab Abbasid diplomats over who would enter the diplomatic hall in Chang&#x27;an first in 758.

===Role of Nestorian Christians and Esoteric Buddhists against An Lushan===
The Nestorian Church of the East Christians like the Bactrian Priest Yisi of Balkh helped the Tang dynasty general Guo Ziyi militarily crush the An Lushan rebellion, with Yisi personally acting as a military commander and Yisi and the Nestorian Church of the East were rewarded by the Tang dynasty with titles and positions as described in the Nestorian Stele.
Epitaphs were found dating from the Tang dynasty of a Christian couple in Luoyang of a Nestorian Christian Sogdian woman, Lady An () who died in 821 and her Nestorian Christian Han Chinese husband, Hua Xian () who died in 827. These Han Chinese Christian men may have married Sogdian Christian women because of a lack of Han Chinese women belonging to the Christian religion, limiting their choice of spouses among the same ethnicity. Another epitaph in Luoyang of a Nestorian Christian Sogdian woman also surnamed An was discovered and she was put in her tomb by her military officer son on 22 January 815. This Sogdian woman&#x27;s husband was surnamed He () and he was a Han Chinese man and the family was indicated to be multiethnic on the epitaph pillar. In Luoyang, the mixed raced sons of Nestorian Christian Sogdian women and Han Chinese men had many career paths available for them. Neither their mixed ethnicity nor their faith were barriers and they were able to become civil officials, military officers, and to openly celebrate their Christian religion and support Christian monasteries.

Vajrayana Buddhist master Amoghavajra assisted the Tang dynasty state against the An Lushan rebellion. He carried out Vajrayana rituals which were ostensibly effective in supernaturally attacking and destroying An Lushan&#x27;s army including the death of one of An Lushan&#x27;s generals, Zhou Zhiguang.

Amoghavajra used his rituals against An Lushan while staying in Chang&#x27;an when it was occupied in 756 while the Tang dynasty crown prince and Xuanzong emperor had retreated to Sichuan. Amoghavajra&#x27;s rituals were explicitly intended to introduce death, disaster and disease against An Lushan. As a result of Amoghavajrya&#x27;s assistance in crushing An Lushan, Estoteric Buddhism became the official state Buddhist sect supported by the Tang dynasty, &quot;Imperial Buddhism&quot; with state funding and backing for writing scriptures, and constructing monasteries and temples. The disciples of Amoghavajra did ceremonies for the state and emperor. Tang dynasty Emperor Suzong was crowned as cakravartin by Amoghavajra after victory against An Lushan in 759 and he had invoked the Acala vidyaraja against An Lushan. The Tang dynasty crown prince Li Heng (later Suzong) also received important strategic military information from Chang&#x27;an when it was occupied by An Lushan though secret message sent by Amoghavajra.

===Siege of Suiyang===
In the beginning of 757 and continuing through October of that year, a protracted stalemate between the Yan and Tang forces occurred in Suiyang. The siege was noted for the Tang army&#x27;s determination to fight to the last man, as well as the large-scale cannibalism practised by the defenders, who in this way were able to hold out longer. Their resistance effectively blocked the Yan forces from attacking the extensive areas south of the Yangzi River, which remained relatively untouched by the An–Shi disturbances.

===Death of An Lushan, An Qingxu became Emperor of Yan===
The Tang imperial forces were helped by the newly formed dynasty&#x27;s internal fighting. On 29 January 757, An Lushan was betrayed and killed by his son, An Qingxu, (An Lushan&#x27;s violent paranoia posed too much of a threat to his entourage). The rebel An Lushan had a Khitan eunuch named Li Zhu&#x27;er (, Li Chu-erh) who was working for An Lushan when he was a teenager but An Lushan used a sword to sever his genitals and he almost died after losing multiple pints of blood. An Lushan revived him after smearing ashes on his injury. Li Zhu&#x27;er was An Lushan&#x27;s eunuch after this and highly used and trusted by him. Li Zhu&#x27;er and another two men helped carry the obese An Lushan when he was taking off or putting on his clothes. Li Zhu&#x27;er helped clothe and unclothe at the Huaqing (Hua-ch&#x27;ing) steam baths granted by Emperor Xuanzang. Li Zhuer was approached by people who wanted to assassinate An Lushan after An Lushan became paranoid and blind, stricken with skin disease and started flogging and murdering his subordinates. An Lushan was hacked to death in his stomach and abdomen by Li Zhuer and another conspirator, Yan Zhuang (, Yen Chuang) who was beaten by An before. An Lushan screamed &quot;this is a thief of my own household&quot; as he desperately shook his curtains since he could not find his sword to defend himself. An Lushan&#x27;s intestines came out of his body as he was hacked to death by Li Zhuer and Yan Zhuang. A horse was once crushed to death under An Lushan&#x27;s sheer weight due to his fatness.

It was said that An Qingxu was an introvert who couldn&#x27;t speak to others properly. As a result, Yan Zhuang advised him not to meet officials frequently, and he entrusted most of affairs of state to Yan and created Yan the Prince of Fengyi. He tried to ingratiate his generals by promoting their positions. Meanwhile, with the major general Shi Siming besieging the Tang general Li Guangbi at Taiyuan, An Qingxu ordered Shi to return to his base of Fanyang and leave the general Cai Xide () at Taiyuan to watch Li Guangbi&#x27;s actions. He also sent the general Yin Ziqi () to attack the city of Suiyang, then under the defense by the Tang generals Zhang Xun and Xu Yuan (), intending to capture Suiyang first and then send Yin south to capture Tang territory south of the Huai River (Yin, however, was locked into a siege of Suiyang that would last until winter 757, stopping any possibility of Yan&#x27;s advancing south). To show favor to Shi, he created Shi the Prince of Guichuan and made him the &quot;jiedushi&quot; of Fanyang Circuit; instead, Shi, hoarding the supplies that An Lushan had previously shipped to Fanyang, began to disobey An Qingxu&#x27;s orders, and An Qingxu could not keep him in check. When the Tang general Guo Ziyi attacked Tong Pass, intending to recapture Chang&#x27;an, however, An was able to send forces to repel Guo&#x27;s attack.

===Siege of Yecheng===
However, the Tang prince Li Chu the Prince of Guangping (the son of Li Heng, who by this point had taken imperial title as Emperor Suzong), with aid from Huige, was able to recapture Chang&#x27;an in summer 757 by defeating Yan forces in the Battle of Xiangji Temple. Tang forces under Li Chu and Huige forces then advanced east, toward Luoyang. In winter 757, An put together his forces and sent them, under Yan Zhuang&#x27;s command, to defend Shan Commandery (, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan). When Yan forces engaged Tang forces, however, they saw that Huige forces were on Tang&#x27;s side, and, in fear, they collapsed. Yan Zhuang and Zhang Tongru () fled back to Luoyang to inform An, and An, after executing some 30 Tang generals who had been captured, abandoned Luoyang and fled north, to Yecheng, which he converted to Ancheng Municipality.

At the time that An arrived at Yecheng, he had only 1,000 infantry soldiers and 300 cavalry soldiers. Soon, however, Yan generals Ashina Chengqing (), Cai Xide, Tian Chengsi, and Wu Lingxun (), who had been attacking other Tang cities, headed to Yecheng and coalesced there, allowing An to have over 60,000 soldiers under his disposal and thus regaining some measure of strength. Meanwhile, apprehensive of Shi, he sent Ashina and An Shouzhong () to Fanyang to order Shi to contribute troops, but was intending to have Ashina and An Shouzhong take over Shi&#x27;s command if possible. Instead, Shi arrested Ashina and An Shouzhong and submitted to Tang. Many other cities previously under Yan&#x27;s control also submitted to Tang, and An Qingxu&#x27;s territory shrank to just Yecheng and the surrounding area. It was said that An Qingxu became cruel and paranoid in light of these military losses, and that if generals submitted to Tang, he would slaughter their families if they were Han and their tribes if they were non-Han. Meanwhile, believing accusations that Zhang made against Cai, he killed Cai, which further led to dissension among his soldiers, particularly since he then put Cui Qianyou () in command of his army, and the soldiers resented Cui for his harshness.

By winter 758, the Tang generals Guo Ziyi, Lu Jiong (), Li Huan (), Xu Shuji (), Li Siye, Ji Guangchen (), Cui Guangyuan (), Dong Qin (), Li Guangbi, and Wang Sili (), were gathering at Yecheng and putting it under siege. An Qingxu tried to fight out of the siege, but was defeated by Tang forces, and his brother An Qinghe () was killed. Meanwhile, with Shi recently having again rebelled against Tang, An sent the general Xue Song to Fanyang to seek aid from Shi, offering the throne to him. Shi thus advanced south toward Yecheng. Meanwhile, Tang forces, under the command of nine generals (with Li Siye having died during the siege), were uncoordinated. On 7 April 759, Shi engaged Tang forces—and, when a storm suddenly arrived, both armies panicked; Shi&#x27;s forces fled north, and Tang forces fled south, lifting the siege on Yecheng. An Qingxu&#x27;s forces gathered the food and supplies abandoned by Tang forces, and An thereafter considered, with Sun Xiaozhe () and Cui, the possibility of refusing Shi, who gathered his troops and again approached Yecheng, admittance. Shi himself was not communicating with An, but was feasting his soldiers and watching Yecheng. Zhang and Gao Shang () requested permission to meet Shi, and An agreed; Shi gave them gifts and let them return to Yecheng. An, unsure what to do, again offered the throne to Shi, which Shi declined. Shi instead suggested to him that perhaps they could both be emperors of independent, allied states. An, pleased, exited Yecheng and met with Shi to swear to the alliance.

=== Resurgence under Shi Siming ===
On 10 April 759, An Qingxu was killed by Shi Siming who enthroned as Emperor Zhaowu of Yan. Shi Siming soon left Empress Xin&#x27;s son Shi Chaoqing () in charge of Fanyang and headed south. He quickly captured Bian Prefecture (, roughly modern Kaifeng, Henan) and Luoyang, but his further attempts to advance were rebuffed by Tang forces at Heyang (, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan) and Shan Prefecture (, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan), and the sides stalemated.

At this time, Shi was described as cruel and prone to kill, terrorizing his army. He favored Shi Chaoqing over Shi Chaoyi and considered creating Shi Chaoqing crown prince and killing Shi Chaoyi.

In spring 761, Shi Siming began another attempt to attack Shan Prefecture, wanting to attack Chang&#x27;an. He had Shi Chaoyi serve as his forward commander, but Shi Chaoyi was repeatedly repelled by the Tang general Wei Boyu (). Shi Siming was angered by Shi Chaoyi&#x27;s failures and considered punishing him and the generals below him. On 18 April, Shi Siming ordered Shi Chaoyi to build a triangular fort with a hill as its side, to store food supplies, and ordered that it be completed in one day. Near the end of the day, Shi Chaoyi had completed it, but had not plastered the walls with mud, when Shi Siming arrived and rebuked him for not applying mud. He ordered his own servants to stay and watch the plastering. He then angrily stated, &quot;After I capture Shan Prefecture, I will kill you, thief!&quot; That night, Shi Chaoyi&#x27;s subordinates Luo Yue () and Cai Wenjing () warned him that he was in dire straits—and that if he refused to take action to depose Shi Siming, they would defect to Tang. Shi Chaoyi agreed to take action, and Luo persuaded Shi Siming&#x27;s guard commander General Cao (personal name lost to history) to agree with the plot. That night, Luo led 300 soldiers and ambushed Shi Siming, binding him and then beginning a return to Luoyang with the troops. On the way back to Luoyang, Luo feared that someone might try to rescue Shi Siming, and so strangled him to death. Shi Chaoyi was enthroned as the new emperor of Yan even though he failed to get widespread support from the other Yan generals.

===Implosion of Yan and end of the rebellion===
By 762, Emperor Suzong had become seriously ill; and the combined forces of the Tang and their Huige allies were led by his eldest son. This son, first named Li Chu, was renamed Li Yu in 758, after being named crown prince. On 18 May 762, on the death of his father, he became Emperor Daizong of Tang.

By this time it was clear that the new Yan dynasty would not last and Yan officers and soldiers began to defect to the Tang side. Then, in the winter of 762, the eastern capital Luoyang was retaken by Tang forces for the second time. Yan Emperor Shi Chaoyi attempted to flee, but was intercepted early in 763. Shi Chaoyi chose suicide over capture, dying on 17 February 763, ending the eight-year-long rebellion.

===Aftermath===
The end of the rebellion was a long process of rebuilding and recovery. Due to the Imperial Court&#x27;s weakened condition, other disturbances flared up. The Tibetan Empire under Trisong Detsän, taking advantage of the Tang&#x27;s weakness, proceeded to briefly capture Chang&#x27;an on 18 November 763 before conquering much of Tang&#x27;s territories in Central Asia. In 765, Pugu Huai&#x27;en, allied with Uyghur and Tibetan forces launched another siege on Chang&#x27;an.

Furthermore, Yan generals who had surrendered to Tang were allowed by Emperor Daizong to retain as independent military governors (Jiedushi), this began an era of warlordism that plagued Tang for the rest of the dynasty.

In 781, The Circuits of Shannan East, Chengde, Weibo and Zhiqing rose up against Tang court in what was called the Four Garrisons Rebellion (). In 782, a Tang general-governor of Huaxi-Cicuit, Li Xilie also rebelled in 782 and proclaimed as the Emperor of Chu. In 783, the Jingyuan mutiny forced the Emperor Dezong to flee Chang&#x27;an. Zhu Ci, the jiedushi of Lulong, captured the city and declared himself emperor of a new state of Qin (later changed to Han). In 784, Zhu Ci was defeated and killed.

====Hebei Three Circuits====

Li Huaixian and fellow Yan generals Xue Song, Li Baochen, and Tian Chengsi submitted to Tang thus were allowed to keep their territory. Li Huaixian was made the military governor (jiedushi) of Lulong Circuit (headquartered in modern Beijing) consisting of Youzhou, the core territory of the former Yan. In 768, Li Huaixian was killed by his subordinates Zhu Xicai, Zhu Ci and Zhu Tao who then took over command of the circuit. Lulong Circuit remained a semi-independent fief, survived the fragmentation of Tang until being annexed by Li Cunxu&#x27;s Jin state in 913.

Li Baozhen kept control of the Chengde Circuit. His son Li Weiyue, along with Tian Chengsi&#x27;s son Tian Yue, rebelled against Tang in 781 but was later killed by his officer Wang Wujun. Chengde&#x27;s last ruler, Wang Rong later founded the Zhao Dynasty that lasted until 921.

Tian Chengsi had full control of the Weibo Circuit. He later annexed Xue Song&#x27;s Zhaoyi Circuit. Weibo Circuit remained independent until integrated with the Later Liang state in 910.

Li Zhengji became the powerful ruler of the Pinglu Circuit (modern Tai&#x27;an, Shandong). His son Li Na rebelled and proclaimed to be the King of Qi before submitting to Tang rule. Wang Wujun also ruled Chengde Circuit as a de facto independent Kingdom of Zhao before submitting to Tang again under Emperor Dezong. Liang Chongyi seized control of the Shannan East Circuit before being defeated by Tang in 781.

==Legacy==
===Death toll===

Censuses taken in the half-century before the rebellion show a gradual increase in population, with the last census undertaken before the rebellion, in 755, recording a population of 52,919,309 in 8,914,709 taxpaying households. However, a census taken in 764, the year following the end of the rebellion, recorded only 16,900,000 in 2,900,000 households. Later censuses count only households, but by 855 this figure had risen to only 4,955,151 households, little over half the number recorded in 755. The difference in the census figures amounts to 36 million people less, two-thirds of the population of the empire, though scholars have attributed this to factors including a breakdown in taxation and census gathering.

The figure of 36 million was used in Steven Pinker&#x27;s book &quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature&quot;, where it is presented as proportionally the largest atrocity in history with the loss of a sixth of the world&#x27;s population at that time, though Pinker stated that the figure was controversial. Matthew White, from whom Pinker had taken the figure of 36 million, later revised his figure down to 13 million (based on a different calculation from the census results) in his book &quot;The Great Big Book of Horrible Things&quot;. White&#x27;s revised figure is repeated by cultural historians such as Johan Norberg.

Historians such as Charles Patrick Fitzgerald argue that claims of massive depopulation are incompatible with contemporary accounts of the war, which was fought intermittently over three or four provinces. They point out that the numbers recorded on the postwar registers reflect not only population loss, but also a breakdown of accuracy of the census system as well as the removal from the census figures of various classes of untaxed persons, such as those in religious orders, foreigners and merchants. In addition, several of the northern provinces, with approximately a quarter of the empire&#x27;s population, were no longer subject to the imperial revenue system. For these reasons, census numbers for the post-rebellion Tang are considered unreliable.

The An Lushan rebellion was one of several wars in northern China along with the Uprising of the Five Barbarians, Huang Chao Rebellion, the wars of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms and Jin–Song Wars which caused a mass migration of Han Chinese from northern China to southern China (). These mass migrations led to southern China&#x27;s population growth, economic, agricultural and cultural development as it stayed peaceful unlike the north.

====Massacres of foreigners====
A massacre of foreign Arab and Persian Muslim merchants by former Yan rebel general Tian Shengong happened during the An Lushan rebellion in the Yangzhou massacre (760). Since Tian Shengong was defecting to the Tang dynasty and wanted them to publicly recognize and acknowledge him as a regional warlord without him giving up territory, and the Tang court portrayed the war as between rebel Hu barbarians of the Yan against Han Chinese of the Tang dynasty, Tian Shengong slaughtered foreigners as a blood sacrifice to prove he was loyal to the Han Chinese Tang dynasty state. He killed other foreign Hu barbarian ethnicities as well whose ethnic groups were not specified, not only Arabs and Persians, since it was directed against all foreigners.

The former Yan rebel general Gao Juren, of Goguryeo descent, ordered a mass slaughter of West Asian (Central Asian) Sogdians in Fanyang, also known as Jicheng (Beijing), in Youzhou. They were identified through their big noses and lances were used to impale their children when he rebelled against the rebel Yan emperor Shi Chaoyi and defeated rival Yan dynasty forces under the Turk Ashina Chengqing. High nosed Sogdians were slaughtered in Youzhou in 761. Youzhou had Linzhou, another &quot;protected&quot; prefecture attached to it, and Sogdians lived there in great numbers. Gao Juren, like Tian Shengong, wanted to defect to the Tang dynasty and wanted them to publicly recognize and acknowledge him as a regional warlord, according to the book, &quot;History of An Lushan&quot; (). Another source says the slaughter of the Hu barbarians serving Ashina Chengqing was done by Gao Juren in Fanyang in order to deprive him of his support base, since the Tiele, Tongluo, Sogdians and Turks were all Hu and supported the Turk Ashina Chengqing against the Mohe, Xi, Khitan and Goguryeo origin soldiers led by Gao Juren. Gao Juren was later killed by Li Huaixian, who was loyal to Shi Chaoyi.

===Weakening of Tang===

The rebellion of An Lushan and its aftermath greatly weakened the centralized bureaucracy of the Tang dynasty, especially in regards to its perimeters. Virtually autonomous provinces and ad hoc financial organizations arose, reducing the influence of the regular bureaucracy in Chang&#x27;an. The Tang dynasty&#x27;s desire for political stability in this turbulent period also resulted in the pardoning of many rebels. Indeed, some were even given their own garrisons to command. Political and economic control of large swathes of the empire became intermittent or was lost, and these areas came to be controlled by &quot;fanzhen&quot;, autonomous regional authorities headed by the &quot;jiedushi&quot; (regional military governors). In Hebei, three &quot;fanzhen&quot; became virtually independent for the remainder of the Tang dynasty. Furthermore, the Tang government also lost most of its control over the Western Regions, due to troop withdrawal to central China to attempt to crush the rebellion and deal with subsequent disturbances. Continued military and economic weakness resulted in further subsequent erosions of Tang territorial control during the ensuing years, particularly in regard to the Tibetan empires. By 790 Chinese control over the Tarim Basin area was completely lost. Moreover, during the rebellion, the Tang general Gao Juren massacred all the Sogdians in Fanyang, who were identified through their noses and faces.

The political decline was paralleled by economic decline, including large Tang governmental debt to Uighur money lenders. The old taxation system of Zu Yong Diao no longer functioned after the rebellion. In addition to being politically and economically detrimental to the empire, the rebellion also affected the intellectual culture of the Tang dynasty. Many intellectuals had their careers interrupted, giving them time to ponder the causes of the unrest. Some lost faith in themselves, concluding that a lack of moral seriousness in intellectual culture had been the cause of the rebellion. However, a political and cultural recovery eventually did occur within Tang China several decades after the rebellion, until about 820, the year of the death of Emperor Xianzong of Tang. Much of the rebuilding and recovery occurred in the Jiangnan region in the south, which had escaped the events of the rebellion relatively unscathed and remained more firmly under Tang control. However, due in part to the &quot;jiedushi&quot; system, the Tang Empire by 907 devolved into what is known as the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.

The Tang dynasty recovered its power decades after the An Lushan rebellion and was still able to launch offensive conquests and campaigns like its destruction of the Uyghur Khaganate in Mongolia in 840–847. The Yenisei Kyrgyz Khaganate of the Are family bolstered his ties and alliance to the Tang dynasty Imperial family against the Uyghur Khaganate by claiming descent from the Han dynasty Han Chinese general Li Ling who had defected to the Xiongnu and married a Xiongnu princess, daughter of Qiedihou Chanyu and was sent to govern the Jiankun (Ch&#x27;ien-K&#x27;un) region which later became Yenisei. Li Ling was a grandson of Li Guang (Li Kuang) of the Longxi Li family descended from Laozi which the Tang dynasty Li Imperial family claimed descent from. The Yenisei Kyrgyz and Tang dynasty launched a victorious successful war between 840–848 to destroy the Uyghur Khaganate in Mongolia and its centre at the Orkhon valley using their claimed familial ties as justification for an alliance. Tang dynasty Chinese forces under General Shi Xiong wounded the Uyghur Khagan (Qaghan) Ögä, seized livestock, took 5,000–20,000 Uyghur Khaganate soldiers captive, killed 10,000 Uyghur Khaganate soldiers on 13 February 843 at the battle of Shahu (kill the barbarians) mountain in 843.

It was the Huang Chao rebellion in 874–884 by the native Han rebel Huang Chao that permanently destroyed the power of the Tang dynasty since Huang Chao not only devastated the north but marched into southern China which An Lushan failed to do due to the Battle of Suiyang. Huang Chao&#x27;s army in southern China committed the Guangzhou massacre against foreign Arab and Persian Muslim, Zoroastrian, Jewish and Christian merchants in 878–879 at the seaport and trading entrepot of Guangzhou, and captured both Tang dynasty capitals, Luoyang and Chang&#x27;an. A medieval Chinese source claimed that Huang Chao killed 8 million people. Even though Huang Chao was eventually defeated, the Tang Emperors lost all their power to regional jiedushi. Huang Chao&#x27;s former lieutenant Zhu Wen, who had defected to the Tang court, turned the Tang emperors into his puppets and completed the destruction of Chang&#x27;an by dismantling Chang&#x27;an and transporting the materials east to Luoyang when he forced the court to move the capital. Zhu Wen deposed the last Tang Emperor in 907 and founded Later Liang (Five Dynasties), plunging China into the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period as regional jiedushi warlords declared their own dynasties and kingdoms.

===Cultural influence===
The Tang dynasty hired 3,000 mercenaries from Abbasid territories, and the Uyghur Khaganate intervened for the Tang dynasty against An Lushan.

The Uyghur Khaganate exchanged princesses in marriage with Tang dynasty China in 756 to seal the alliance against An Lushan. The Uyghur Khagan Bayanchur Khan had his daughter Uyghur Princess Pijia () married to Tang dynasty Chinese Prince , Prince of Dunhuang (), son of Li Shouli, Prince of Bin, while the Tang dynasty Chinese princess Ninguo married Uyghur Khagan Bayanchur.

Sogdian merchants continued as active traders in China following the defeat of the rebellion, but many of them were compelled to hide their ethnic identity. A prominent case was An Chongzhang, Minister of War and Duke of Liang, who in 756 requested of Emperor Suzong to allow him to change his name to Li Baoyu, due to his shame in sharing the same surname with the rebel leader. This change of surnames was enacted retroactively for all of his family members, so that his ancestors would also be bestowed the surname Li.

The events involved in the An Lushan rebellion had an immense cultural influence both in China and beyond. Many poets of the time wrote about their lives and emotions, which were deeply impacted by war and rebellion, but few poets wrote outwardly about the rebellion. In fact, only eighteen of around one hundred poems produced between the years of 755 and 763 discussed the rebellion. Although the majority of poems written at the time simply do not mention the rebellion, a few poets attempted to write openly about their experiences living during the rebellion. Some examples of this include:
* The great poet Li Bai (also known as &quot;Li Bo&quot; or &quot;Li Po&quot;, who lived about 701–762) avoided the rebels, but at the cost of getting involved on the wrong side of a power struggle between the princes of the royal family. He was convicted of involvement with rebellion and sentenced to exile, although he was later reprieved. His surviving poems reflect the golden days before the An Lushan rebellion, his lengthy and deliberately protracted journey toward exile (and then return as in his poem , together with his hardships, wandering and disillusionment as the Tang re-consolidated control after the rebellion. He died in 762, before the final defeat of the rebel forces a year later.
* Li Bai&#x27;s colleague Du Fu (712–770) had finally attained a minor appointment in the imperial bureaucracy when the rebellion broke out. He spent the winter of 756 and the summer of 757 as a captive in rebel-occupied Chang&#x27;an, but later managed to escape and join with Suzong&#x27;s side and thus avoid charges of treason. Living until 770, his subsequent poetry is a primary source of information about the massive upheavals of the period.
* Wang Changling (698–756?), was another Tang official and renowned poet who died in the rebellion, in about 756.
* Wang Wei (approximately 699–759) was captured by the rebels in 756 and sent to Luoyang, where he was forced to serve as an official in their governmental administration, for which he was briefly imprisoned after his capture by loyalist forces. Dying before the end of the rebellion, somewhere between 759 and 761, Wang Wei lived his last years in retirement at his country home in Lantian, secluded in the hills.
*Wei Yingwu (737–792) of &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot; fame is credited with writing the poem &quot;At Chuzhou on the Western Stream&quot;, apparently written in response to the seemingly helmless ship of state of the times.
Later poets, such as Bai Juyi (772–846), also wrote famous verses about the events of the period of the Anshi affairs. The tragic events were epitomized in the story of Xuanzong and Yang Guifei, and generations of Chinese and Japanese painters depicted various iconic scenes, such as Yang Guifei bathing or playing a musical instrument or the flight of the imperial court on the &quot;hard road to Shu&quot; (that is, the royal progress to Sichuan). These artistic themes were also a major source of inspiration in Japan, in regards to the &quot;Tale of Genji&quot;, partially inspired by the story of Yang Guifei.

<text>Guo Ziyi (Kuo Tzu-i; Traditional Chinese: 郭子儀, Simplified Chinese: 郭子仪, Hanyu Pinyin: Guō Zǐyí, Wade-Giles: Kuo1 Tzu3-i2) (697 – July 9, 781), posthumously Prince Zhōngwǔ of Fényáng (), was a Chinese military general and politician who ended the An Lushan rebellion and participated in expeditions against the Uyghur Khaganate and Tibetan Empire. He was regarded as one of the most powerful Tang generals before and after the Anshi Rebellion. After his death he was deified in Chinese folk religion as the God of Wealth and Happiness (&quot;Lu Star&quot; of Fu Lu Shou). Guo Ziyi is depicted in the Wu Shuang Pu (無雙譜, Table of Peerless Heroes) by Jin Guliang.

==Early life==
Guo Ziyi was born into the family of a middle-class civil servant in Hua Prefecture (華州, present-day Hua County in Shaanxi), he was described as a handsome man and was over 1.9 meters tall.

Around 735 Guo Ziyi was saved from a court martial by the poet Li Bai, who intervened on his behalf with the local commander.

Unlike other members of his family, Guo Ziyi entered political life through the official military examinations instead of a literary exam (for civil servants). He passed the military examinations in 749 and became an officer in the border regions of the Tang Empire and quickly rose through the ranks to become a jiedushi (regional military governor).

==An Shi Rebellion==

===First victories===
Limited records exist about Guo Ziyi before the An Lushan Rebellion; it was during the rebellion that he earned his fame. When rebellion broke out in 755, Guo Ziyi was assigned to protect the Tong Pass, a strategic location on the Chinese frontier. A large force of ten thousand rebels were marching toward the pass. Guo Ziyi took advantage of the situation by luring the rebels onto the plains in front of the pass where there were only scarce settlements. The rebels saw little to loot and were discouraged, while the Tang troops were prepared to fight, motivated by the desire to protect their families in the Tong Pass and the capital of Chang&#x27;an. Guo engaged the seven thousand troops at the Battle of Qingbi and scattered the rest while suffering few casualties to his own force, winning his first victory.

By the following year of 756 the capital fell due to the ineptitude and corruption of the chancellor Yang Guozhong and his eunuchs. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang fled the city, accompanied by his personal guard and members of the Yang family, including his consort Yang Guifei. Members of the entourage, including the troops, resented Yang Guozhong, holding him responsible for the failed strategy that led to the fall of Chang&#x27;an. Yang Guozhong was denounced and executed. Following this, the emperor&#x27;s own troops also forced him to execute his beloved consort Yang Guifei. The emperor then fled with the remainder of the entourage under difficult conditions to Chengdu in Jiannan.

Meanwhile, Guo Ziyi confronted a great force of a hundred thousand led by rebel commander Shi Siming. Although Guo had only ten thousand men he delayed Shi Siming&#x27;s army until reinforcements could arrive. Shi Siming was tricked into thinking he would be ambushed if he moved against Guo and was delayed forty days. At that point commander Li Guangbi came to Guo&#x27;s relief with ninety thousand men. The opposing forces clashed, resulting in few Tang losses, while the rebels suffered ten thousand casualties. Shi Siming quickly gathered up what was left of his force and retreated back to Fanyang, the rebels&#x27; stronghold. Li recommended Guo to Emperor Xuanzong, and Guo quickly asked the emperor for permission to launch an immediate counter-attack to destroy the remaining rebels, but Xuanzong refused him.

===Change of Emperor and the Shaanxi campaign===
Xuanzong&#x27;s son, Li Heng, stayed behind in the city of Lingwu and declared himself emperor on 12 August 756. Emperor Suzong of Tang immediately began organizing a counter-attack against the advancing rebels. From this time on, Xuanzong was known as the &quot;Retired Emperor&quot;, and after the retaking of Chang&#x27;an from the rebels he returned there, where he lived until his death in 761.

The rebel crisis decreased the power of the Imperial Court. Thus, after assuming power, Suzong&#x27;s authority was weak and many Tang generals cared little for the emperor&#x27;s orders. There were few generals of Chinese descent such as Guo Ziyi remaining in the Tang army. Guo was given the post of Imperial Commander and Suzong provided support for his military operations, which were met with great success. By 757, Guo Ziyi had entered the Shaanxi battlefront, and many locals willingly aided him against the rebels, increasing the Guo army to perhaps twice its original size. The rebels suffered dramatic losses, including the deaths of their generals, after which Guo declared victory on the Shaanxi front.

===Chang&#x27;an victory and rebel collapse===
Guo Ziyi then immediately turned his attention to retaking Chang&#x27;an. He attacked with 15 000 men, whereas the rebels were able to assemble only 10 000 men, and defeated them. Guo&#x27;s victories in Shaanxi and at Chang&#x27;an contributed to in-fighting among the rebel ranks. The leader of the rebels, An Lushan, was killed by his son, An Qingxu, who gathered up what was left of the rebels and retreated to Luoyang. When Suzong arrived at Chang&#x27;an, it is said that he shed tears and said to Guo, &quot;This may be my country, but it is recreated by your hand.&quot; 「雖吾之家國，實由卿再造。」

In 758, Guo Ziyi, Li Guangbi, and other jiedushi were ordered to eliminate the last remaining rebels in Yi. However, Suzong was troubled by the growing power of the jiedushi so he placed his eunuchs in charge of the campaign. This became a disaster, but Guo Ziyi managed to make the best out of the situation by convincing his fellow jiedushi that they could have one easy victory if they laid siege to the rebel city. All of them agreed to this strategy and the rebel&#x27;s supplies were depleted during the siege. When the time came to assault the city, however, there was no commander-in-chief to coordinate the attack since all the jiedushi were of equal rank, and it proved ineffective. In the meantime, reinforcements under Shi Siming arrived to reinforce An Qingxu. The Tang forces missed the opportunity to eliminate the rebels. A bloody battle followed in 759, fought in poor weather and again with no central command for the Tang. Although the Tang force emerged victorious, both sides suffered tremendous losses (the rebel leader Shi Siming himself was killed, as were most of the Mongol rebels) and the result of the battle was unacceptable to the emperor, since the Tang army had been known to win battles while suffering relatively few casualties. The jiedushi began to blame one another, and many of them targeted Guo, placing much of the blame on him. In fact, aside from the emperor himself, Guo Ziyi was the only one that the common people were willing to follow. Suzong, worried by Guo&#x27;s popularity, used this as a pretext to decrease Guo&#x27;s authority, demoting him while generously rewarding the other jiedushi.

===Nestorian Christianity===
The Nestorian Church of the East Christians like the Bactrian Priest Yisi of Balkh helped the Tang dynasty general Guo Ziyi militarily crush the An Lushan rebellion, with Yisi personally acting as a military commander and Yisi and the Nestorian Church of the East were rewarded by the Tang dynasty with titles and positions as described in the Nestorian Stele.

==Under Emperor Suzong==

Although the An Lushan Rebellion was finally put down in 763, the Tang was immediately confronted by another threat from the Tibetan Empire. Tibet had benefited from the Tang&#x27;s prosperous period when trade with the Tang was frequent. During the An Lushan Rebellion, it reached the height of its power, and betrayed the peace treaty with the Tang by supporting the rebels. Weakened by the rebellion, Tang border garrisons were unable to resist Tibetan raids into their territory. Most jiedushi were not ethnically Chinese and had little incentive to defend the Tang Empire, especially when it was ruled by a weak emperor. In response, Suzong re-promoted Guo Ziyi, but only as a military figurehead with no authority, in the hope that merely the threat of sending Guo against them would keep the Tibetans at bay. In 762, a general named Wang Yuanzhi murdered Li Jingzhi, the jiedushi of Shaanxi, claiming that the troops were still so loyal to Guo that they demanded he be reinstated as jiedushi. Suzong was forced to return Guo Ziyi to his former position. When Guo Ziyi arrived, however, instead of thanking Wang he condemned the general for his disloyalty in killing his commander. He also pointed out that such an act disrupted the chain of command, which might embolden the Tibetans to attack. General Wang submitted to his mistakes and committed suicide. Guo Ziyi quickly assumed command of the post and the Tibetans ceased their attacks.

==Under Emperor Daizong and Tibetan Invasion==
Not long after, Suzong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong of Tang. The new emperor was worried about Guo Ziyi&#x27;s fame and called him back to Chang&#x27;an. Guo Ziyi advised the emperor to take a note of the threat posed by the Tibetans, but the emperor largely ignored this.

===Tibetan invasion of 763===
In 763, a force of 100 000 Tibetans invaded the Tang. Daizong fled Chang&#x27;an on 16 November when it became clear the city would be captured. The Tibetans crowned Li Chenghong as emperor of Tang in Chang&#x27;an, but retreated a month later fearing a Tang army had arrived. In reality Guo ordered cavalry scouts to go forward and light fires, in places where the enemies could see, and then retreat. Guo also sent secret messages to Chang&#x27;an, ordering citizens to strike gongs and create fire. The Tibetans, confused by these actions, panicked, scattering when the rumor spread that Guo Ziyi moved against them with a large force. With the Tibetans retreating from their positions, the invasion was concluded without loss to either side. Many Chinese military historians consider this victory to be the best example of Sun Tzu&#x27;s idea of the cleanest kind of battle, &quot;a war with no loss on either side but simply played out with the desired effect for the victor.&quot; There are discrepancies in the number of cavalry Guo dispatched; Chinese sources state that Guo had sent out only 13 scouts, but a Tibetan text indicates there had been 200. Nevertheless, the Tibetan army retreated, and when Guo Ziyi arrived at Chang&#x27;an with his &quot;large&quot; force, Daizong appeared to him and stated, &quot;By employing the Elder not sooner: so many deaths reached, woe is this!&quot; 「用卿不早，故及於此。」

===Tibetan invasion of 764===
The Tibetan Empire invaded again in 764 with a force of 70,000 but was repulsed in Jiannan by the &quot;jiedushi&quot; Yan Wu.

===Tibetan threat of 765 and the Uyghur alliance===
The Tibetans attacked again in 765, when the Tiele jiedushi Pugu Huai&#x27;en sent false messages to Trisong Detsen, the emperor of Tibet, stating that Guo Ziyi had died. The Tibetan emperor was eager to avenge his earlier defeats, and dispatched a large force to attack Tang China again. Various Uyghur chieftains, also believing that Guo was dead, joined force with the Tibetans. The Tibetan force was recorded as more than 30,000 (including a few thousand Uyghurs), almost the entire Tibetan military at the time. However Pugu died on 27 September, and his army defected to the Tang.

When news of the Tibetan attack reached Emperor Daizong, he dispatched Guo Ziyi to defend the Tang with only few thousand men. When Guo was within a day&#x27;s march from the enemy, he decided to go alone to see the Uyghur chieftains. His officers and son Guo Xi () were so dismayed and panicked by his intention that they would not let go of his horse&#x27;s reins, declaring such an act would be suicide. Guo laughed and convinced his officers to let him go, but his son would not. Angered, Guo whipped his son&#x27;s hand so that he released the reins, reprimanding him and telling him that this was a life and death situation for the empire; their force was small and if they fought the Tibetans alone, both father and son, and their troops, would die. If he succeeded in his plan the empire would be defended, but if it failed only his own life would be lost. 

When Guo arrived at the Uyghur&#x27;s camp, he did not reveal his identity and appeared to be a messenger who had been sent to tell them that Guo Ziyi was coming to see them. The Uyghur chieftains, many of whom had joined the rebel side in the An Lushan Rebellion, were surprised and panicked to hear that Guo was alive, deciding that they had to meet with him. Guo laughed at them and asked them why they would want to face Guo Ziyi again after their defeat at his hands during the An Shi Rebellion. The Uyghur chieftains replied they had been told that he was dead, but if they met with him and saw he was alive, they would retreat. Guo, however, insisted that Guo Ziyi did not seek their retreat but instead wanted them to join him against the Tibetans. The Uyghur chieftains, saying they had been deceived by the Tibetans about Guo&#x27;s death, agreed to break the alliance with them. They even claimed that shamans had foretold that a great man would lead them to victory and that they now believed this man must be Guo, and agreed to join forces with the Tang.

===Battle of Xiyuan===
Guo returned to his camp and ordered a thousand light horsemen to make a quick rush at the Tibetan camp at Xiyuan. When the Tibetans realized the Uyghurs had broken their alliance, they attempted to withdraw, but Guo&#x27;s horsemen arrived and scattered their forces; at the same time, Guo&#x27;s Uyghur allies arrived and prevented the Tibetans&#x27; retreat. Over 10 000 Tibetans were killed in battle and another 10 000 were taken prisoner. Guo continued to pursue the Tibetans and freed over 4000 Tang subjects they had taken captive.

When the emperor of Tibet heard that his force had been defeated, he quickly sent a message to Emperor Daizong seeking a peace, stating that his army had been on a hunting trip and had had no intention of attacking the Tang Empire. Although Daizong did not believe this, he agreed to the peace and Tibet was never again a threat to China.

==Later life, death and posthumous honor==

Guo was later made the Prince of Fenyang (), and is hence often referred to as &quot;Guo Fenyang&quot;. He lived to the age of 85 (by East Asian reckoning) and was given the posthumous name of Zhongwu (忠武: &quot;Loyal and Martial&quot;) after his death.

There is a commonly remembered tale dated to the year 767 in which his son had an argument with his wife, a princess of Tang. During the argument, the princess and Guo&#x27;s son compared their fathers, Emperor Daizong and Guo Ziyi. Guo&#x27;s son was purported to have said, &quot;What is so great about being an emperor? My father could become emperor at any time if he wanted to.&quot; Guo was so angry at his son for implying such an idea of disloyalty that he had him locked up and waited for Emperor Daizong to pass judgement on him. The princess regretted what had happened and asked Guo to forgive his son, but Guo refused. When Emperor Daizong arrived, he pardoned the son and said to Guo, &quot;When the son and daughter fight, it is better as old men to pretend to be deaf.&quot; (&quot;不痴不聾，不作家翁。兒女子閨房之言，何足聽也！&quot;)

In another instance, the son hit his wife in a drunken rage. Again Guo was so angry at his son that he had him arrested again. But again the princess begged for her husband to be forgiven, and again Emperor Daizong stepped in and forgave his son-in-law. This story of Guo&#x27;s son and the princess was popularized by the rather literally titled Beijing Opera &quot;Hitting the Princess While Drunk&quot; (醉打金枝).

Popular folklore states that the Jade Emperor was so pleased with Guo&#x27;s actions in defending the nation and in giving happiness to the people that he sent a heavenly official down from heaven to ask Guo what his greatest desire was. Guo replied that he had fought for so long and had seen so much bloodshed that all he desired was peace and happiness. As a reward, the Jade Emperor had Guo guided to heaven and bestowed the Celestial post of &quot;God of Prosperity and Happiness&quot; to him.

==Legacy==
Guo Ziyi has been credited by many historians with putting down the An Lushan Rebellion, characterizing him as the man who single-handedly saved the Tang dynasty. His impact on East Asia was also dramatic in that he renewed Tang relations with many of its Uyghur allies, who later supported the dynasty in campaigns against the Tibetan Empire. After his various victories over the Tibetans they were never able to restore their military might and lost much of their political strength in Asia.

In 757, or thereabouts, Guo Ziyi saved the renowned poet Li Bai from a death sentence for treason by offering Emperor Suzong of Tang his own official rank in exchange for Li Bai&#x27;s life. In the event, Suzong commuted Li Bai&#x27;s sentence to exile, and later pardoned him, and Guo Ziyi was allowed to retain his rank.

Future members of his family would also go to become famous generals, among them Guo Puyo, a general greatly used by Genghis Khan, and Guo Kan, one of the best generals of the Mongol Empire, who was instrumental in the Mongol Siege of Baghdad (1258) and the destruction of the Abbasid caliphate which saw the execution of the last Abbasid caliph and the slaughter of 800,000–2,000,000 Arab Muslim civilians in Baghdad, with only the Nestorian Assyrian Christians being spared.

<doc id="318511" wikidata="Q1069299" url="?curid=318511" title="Yang Guozhong">
<text>Yang Guozhong () (died July 15, 756), né Yang Zhao (), was a Chinese politician who served as principal chancellor of the Tang dynasty from 752 to 756, late in the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. Known in his youth as a gambler and wastrel, Yang rose rapidly to political power after his distant cousin, Yang Yuhuan, became Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s favorite consort in 744. His familial ties and skills as a financial administrator helped him navigate the tumultuous court politics of the late 740s and early 750s to become the emperor&#x27;s leading chancellor in 752. While Yang enjoyed Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s trust, his competence as chancellor was questioned and he became entangled in a fierce rivalry with an erstwhile political ally, the general and imperial favorite An Lushan. Yang was blamed for precipitating An&#x27;s cataclysmic rebellion in 755. In the following year, he forced the Tang army of Geshu Han, then holding favorable defensive positions in Tong Pass, to confront the rebel army, leading to a rout of Tang forces and the fall of the imperial capital, Chang&#x27;an. Yang attempted to flee to his base in Chengdu with Emperor Xuanzong, but when the imperial party stopped at Mawei Station in modern Shaanxi, Yang and his family, including Yang Yuhuan, were massacred by imperial guard soldiers who blamed them for the chaos.

==Background==
It is unknown when Yang Zhao was born. His family was from Pu Prefecture (蒲州, roughly Yuncheng, Shanxi) and traced its ancestry to the great Han dynasty official Yang Zhen (), as well as officials of Later Yan, Northern Wei, and Sui dynasty. Yang Zhao&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Yang Wang () was an important official during Sui. His grandfather Yang Youliang () served as a county magistrate for Tang, and his father Yang Xun () served as a military officer. His mother Lady Zhang was a sister of Wu Zetian&#x27;s lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong.

Yang Zhao himself was said to lack knowledge and virtues. He was a heavy drinker and gambler, and was looked down upon by his own clan members. Motivated by this slight, Yang decided to join the army, and ended up serving in the army stationed at Yi Prefecture (益州, roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan). For his military service, he was set to be promoted, but the secretary general of Yi Prefecture, Zhang Kuan (), disliking him, initially refused to do so and in fact whipped him, but eventually he was made the magistrate of Xindu County. After his three-year term of service was over, he did not save sufficient funds to return home, and relied on assistance from a rich man of the region, Xianyu Zhongtong (). He also spent much time with the household of his father&#x27;s cousin Yang Xuanyan (), and eventually carried on an affair with one of Yang Xuanyan&#x27;s daughters (the later Lady of Guo). When Yang Yuanyan, who was sonless, died, Yang Zhao was temporarily in charge of the household, until Yang Yuanyan&#x27;s daughters went to Henan Municipality (河南府, i.e., Luoyang) to stay with their uncle Yang Xuanjiao (). Yang Zhao later served as the sheriff of Fufeng County (扶風, in modern Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi), but was unable to progress further, and returned to the Yi Prefecture region. While he was in the region, he also married his wife Pei Rou (), who had been a prostitute.

==Rise to power==
As of 744, Yang Xuanyan&#x27;s daughter Yang Guifei had become Emperor Xuanzong of Tang&#x27;s favorite concubine. Meanwhile, at this time, Xianyu Zhongtong had become an associate of Zhangqiu Jianqiong (), the military governor (&quot;jiedushi&quot;) of Jiannan Circuit (劍南, headquartered in Chengdu), and Zhangqiu happened to be fearful that the powerful chancellor Li Linfu, with whom he was not on good relations, would find some way to hurt him. He thus wanted someone to go to the capital Chang&#x27;an to help him maintain good relations with powerful individuals on his behalf. Xianyu recommended Yang Zhao. Zhangqiu gave Yang a gift and also gave him many impressive items from the region and had him take them to Chang&#x27;an. Once Yang Zhao arrived at Chang&#x27;an, he gave the bribe from Zhangqiu to Consort Yang&#x27;s sisters and two of her powerful cousins, Yang Xian () and Yang Qi (), and further resumed his affair with one of her sisters. The sisters and cousins of Consort Yang thus repeatedly praised and recommended both Zhangqiu and Yang Zhao, and further pointed out to Emperor Xuanzong Yang Zhao&#x27;s abilities to entertain by gambling. Yang Zhao was thus allowed in the palace, and subsequently was made an officer of the imperial guards.

As of 747, Yang Zhao was serving as &quot;Shi Yushi&quot; (), an imperial censor, when Li Linfu wanted to accuse the official Yang Shenjin () of crimes. He thus engaged Yang Zhao to have Yang Zhao inform Yang Shenjin&#x27;s cousin&#x27;s son Wang Hong (), who resented Yang Shenjin for still viewing him as a junior member of the family, of Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s displeasure with Yang Shenjin over Yang Shenjin&#x27;s involvement with a sorcerer named Shi Jingzhong (). Li Linfu then induced Wang to make accusations against Yang Shenjin, who was a descendant of Sui emperors, of plotting to overthrow Tang and restore Sui. As a result, Yang Shenjin and his brothers Yang Shenyu () and Yang Shenming () were forced to commit suicide, and many of their friends and family members were exiled. Meanwhile, Li Linfu, having unsuccessfully supported Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s son Li Mao () the Prince of Shou to be crown prince (with Emperor Xuanzong selecting Li Heng instead), was trying to find ways to undermine Li Heng, and therefore engaged Yang Zhao, Luo Xishi (), and Ji Wen () to falsely accuse people with connections to Li Heng, hoping to find a way to implicate Li Heng in improprieties. Yang Zhao was therefore able to use this opportunity to destroy several hundreds of households, although, with the eunuch Gao Lishi and Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s son-in-law Zhang Ji () protecting him, Li Heng was not implicated.

As of 748, Yang Zhao carried some fifteen office titles, the chief among which were imperial censor and director of accounting in the ministry of treasury (度支郎中, &quot;Duzhi Langzhong&quot;). In 748, Emperor Xuanzong further made him &quot;Jishizhong&quot; (), an imperial attendant, as well as deputy chief imperial censor (御史中丞, &quot;Yushi Zhongcheng&quot;), but Yang Zhao continued to be in charge of accounting as well at the ministry of treasury. As of 749, with the prefectural treasury&#x27;s food stores overflowing, Yang suggested that the prefectures, instead of storing food, buy silk with the food and transport the silk to the imperial treasury in Chang&#x27;an. Emperor Xuanzong, with Yang reporting record surpluses, took a tour of the imperial treasury with the officials and awarded him with a purple robe and a golden fish.

Meanwhile, by 750, Yang and Ji were allied with each other, and Ji was plotting with Yang how to replace Li LInfu as chancellor—and he found crimes of Li Linfu&#x27;s close associates Xiao Jiong () and Song Hun (), and then had Yang indict them and have them demoted, to try to undermine Li LInfu&#x27;s hold on power. He also sought posthumous rehabilitation of his uncles Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, and at his request, Emperor Xuanzong posthumously restored the Zhangs&#x27; titles (stripped when they had been killed in 705). Also, because there were references in prophecies to a &quot;golden sword&quot; (金刀, which, when put together, made Zhao 釗)), he requested a name change as well. Emperor Xuanzong gave him the new name of Guozhong (meaning, &quot;faithful to the state&quot;). Grateful for what Xianyu had done for him at the start of his career, he had Xianyu made the military governor of Jiannan, despite the fact that Xianyu was harsh and thus offended the non-Han vassals. Indeed, in 751, after Xianyu had attacked the Kingdom of Nanzhao and suffered a major defeat (with 60,000 deaths), Yang hid the truth for him and claimed to Emperor Xuanzong that Xianyu had scored a major victory. Nevertheless, with the Nanzhao campaign continuing, Yang ordered that men be forcibly conscripted, even if they had previously had contributions to the state (which normally would lead to an exemption from conscription). He also had Xianyu offer to resign and recommend him instead; thereafter, Emperor Xuanzong made him the military governor of Jiannan, but he remained at Chang&#x27;an and did not report to Jiannan, although he continued to wage the campaign against Nanzhao, eventually with the Tang death toll running up to 200,000.

In 752, Yang received an opportunity to have Li Linfu removed. That year, Wang Hong&#x27;s brother Wang Han () had been implicated in a coup attempt at Chang&#x27;an, and although Emperor Xuanzong, at the plea of Li LInfu, initially took no action against Wang Hong and Wang Han, he expected Wang Hong to offer to be punished, but Wang Hong did not, drawing Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s anger. Li Linfu&#x27;s fellow chancellor Chen Xilie and Yang then both accused Wang Hong of treason, and Wang Hong was forced to commit suicide, depriving Li Linfu of a major ally. Wang&#x27;s post as mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (京兆府, encompassing Chang&#x27;an) went to Yang. Yang then had the captives from Wang Han&#x27;s failed coup implicate Li Linfu, and also had Chen and Geshu Han implicate Li Linfu in the rebellion of the ethnically Tujue general Li Xianzhong (). Li Linfu tried to defuse the threat by requesting that Yang be sent to Jiannan to personally oversee the Nanzhao campaign, and Emperor Xuanzong sent Yang to Jiannan, despite Yang&#x27;s pleas and Consort Yang&#x27;s pleas on his behalf. Emperor Xuanzong, however, promised to make him chancellor, and recalled him as soon as he reached Jiannan. When he returned to Chang&#x27;an, Li Linfu was gravely ill, and tried to ingratiate Yang by pointing out that Yang would be chancellor and entrusting his household to Yang. Upon Li Linfu&#x27;s death, however, Yang induced Li Linfu&#x27;s son-in-law Yang Qixuan () into corroborating that Li Linfu was involved with Li Xianzhong. As a result, Li Linfu was posthumously stripped of honors and his family members were exiled.

==As chancellor==
Meanwhile, Emperor Xuanzong made Yang Guozhong &quot;You Xiang&quot; () -- the head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, &quot;Zhongshu Sheng&quot;) and a post considered one for a chancellor; he also made Yang the minister of civil service affairs (文部尚書, &quot;Wenbu Shangshu&quot;), and further allowed him to keep his command of Jiannan. It was said that Yang was capable in rhetoric but lacked abilities and presence. While he tried to be a responsible official and was decisive, he was frivolous and insolent to other officials. He personally assumed over 40 posts, and expelled those officials who had good reputations but were not willing to follow his orders. It was further said that he tried to show off his talent by having important matters decided at his home without discussion with other officials, and then simply announce his decisions once he arrived at the government halls. Meanwhile, for his and Chen&#x27;s contributions in &quot;discovering&quot; Li Linfu&#x27;s involvement with Li Xianzhong, Emperor Xuanzong created both of them dukes in 753—in Yang&#x27;s case, the Duke of Wei (), although he declined on account that the title was overly honorable for him, and so Emperor Xuanzong made him the Duke of Wei (衛, note different character) -- a slightly lesser title.

Meanwhile, though, Yang began to have discord with another favorite official of Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s -- An Lushan, the military governor of Fanyang (范陽, headquartered in modern Beijing), Hedong (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and Pinglu (平盧, headquartered in modern Chaoyang, Liaoning) Circuits, as An did not respect Yang. Yang repeatedly accused An of plotting rebellion, but Emperor Xuanzong ignored the reports. Yang, instead, entered into an alliance with Geshu, who also disliked An and who was then the military governor of Longyou Circuit (隴右, headquartered in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai) at that time, by recommending that Geshu take over the command of Hexi Circuit (河西, headquartered in modern Wuwei, Gansu).

At this time, Yang and his relatives were living in extreme luxury, and he and the Lady of Guo had connected mansions and were openly displaying their closeness. Meanwhile, whenever Consort Yang&#x27;s sisters—the Ladies of Guo, Han, and Qin—and Yang Xian and Yang Qi were to attend Emperor Xuanzong and Consort Yang on tours to Huaqing Palace (華清宮, known for its hot springs), their trains would gather at Yang Guozhong&#x27;s mansion, with each of the five households distinguished by a different color, causing a glamorous display of colors. Yang Guozhong would lead the train ahead with his own guards and the banners as the military governor of Jiannan.

In spring 754, Yang suggested to Emperor Xuanzong that An was set on rebelling, and that if Emperor Xuanzong summoned him to Chang&#x27;an, he would surely not come—but when Emperor Xuanzong then did summon An, An immediately arrived at Chang&#x27;an and accused Yang of false accusations. Thereafter, Emperor Xuanzong would no longer believe any suggestions that An was plotting rebellion, despite Li Heng agreeing with Yang&#x27;s assessment on this issue. Meanwhile, he considered promoting An to be chancellor, but Yang opposed, and this did not occur, and An subsequently returned to Fanyang. Meanwhile, Yang was having conflicts with Chen as well, and he forced Chen to resign and then recommended Wei Jiansu to replace Chen. During a subsequent flood that caused much damage, Yang, not wanting any reports of damage, insisted that there was no damage—and when the officials Li Xian and Fang Guan nevertheless submitted damage reports, he had them demoted. He also viewed the official Wei Zhi () as a threat and had Wei accused of corruption—and when Wei subsequently bribed Ji, who was by then allied with An, for help, Yang also discovered this and reported it. As a result, Wei and Ji were demoted, and An subsequently submitted a petition on their behalf, claiming that the accusations from Yang were false, but Emperor Xuanzong took no actions against either An or Yang.

In spring 755, however, the matters were beginning to come to a head. When An submitted a petition to have thirty-two non-Han generals under him replace Han generals, Emperor Xuanzong immediately agreed, despite stern arguments from Yang and Wei Jiansu that this was a sign of impending rebellion. Yang and Wei then suggested that An be promoted to be chancellor, and that his three commands be divided between his three deputies; Emperor Xuanzong initially agreed, but after the edict was drafted, Emperor Xuanzong tabled it and instead sent the eunuch Fu Qiulin () to send fresh fruits to An and to observe him—upon which An bribed Fu into submitting a favorable report. Yang, however, persisted in his reports against Yang, including having the mayor of Jingzhao arrest An&#x27;s friend Li Chao () and others and executing them secretly. An&#x27;s son An Qingzong (), who was then at Chang&#x27;an, reported this to An Lushan, causing An Lushan to be even more apprehensive. Subsequent events—including An&#x27;s refusal to attend the funeral of an imperial prince in summer 755 and his offer to send a large number of horses to Chang&#x27;an in fall 755, began to cause Emperor Xuanzong to start suspecting An. He also discovered that Fu had received An&#x27;s bribes, and therefore had Fu killed, instead sending another eunuch, Feng Shenwei () to Fanyang to again summon An. An refused.

In winter 755, An, finally feeling he had no choice but to rebel, did so. The imperial officials were all apprehensive, because An had the strongest troops of the realm at the time, except for Yang, who believed that An could be suppressed easily. However, An&#x27;s forces roved through the region north of the Yellow River easily, reaching Luoyang around the new year 756, and capturing it easily despite the efforts of Feng Changqing to defend it. In response, Emperor Xuanzong considered passing the throne to Li Heng and personally lead the troops against An—a proposal that Yang feared, believing that Li Heng would then take actions against the Yangs. He had Consort Yang dissuade Emperor Xuanzong from both actions. Meanwhile, Geshu was summoned to Chang&#x27;an to command the forces against An—and Geshu was then able to manufacture evidence that An&#x27;s stepfather&#x27;s nephew An Sishun, whom Geshu also disliked, was complicit in An Lushan&#x27;s rebellion, and An Sishun was executed. Yang, after this incident, began to be apprehensive of Geshu as well. When Geshu subsequently took defensive position at Tong Pass and refused to engage An&#x27;s forces, reasoning that as long as he kept Chang&#x27;an secure, the other generals Li Guangbi and Guo Ziyi would soon be able to capture An&#x27;s power base at Fanyang and render An harmless. Yang, however, feared that Geshu was instead plotting against him. (Geshu&#x27;s deputy Wang Sili () did suggest to Geshu that he kill Yang when he could, but Geshu refused.) Yang therefore sent his associate Du Qianhui () with a separate army command to the front as well to watch Geshu, and Geshu, in turn apprehensive that Yang was going to act against him, found an excuse to execute Du, further causing Yang&#x27;s suspicions. Yang therefore had Emperor Xuanzong order Geshu to engage An&#x27;s forward commander Cui Qianyou (), despite Geshu&#x27;s repeated protestations that a battle was inadvisable. Once the armies engaged, Tang forces were crushed by Cui&#x27;s forces; Geshu was captured, and Tong Pass fell on July 10.

Yang then began to plan for an evacuation to Jiannan. Emperor Xuanzong agreed. On July 14, the imperial train, without announcing to the people of Chang&#x27;an, left Chang&#x27;an, with Emperor Xuanzong attended to by the imperial clan members, Yang, Wei Jiansu, the official Wei Fangjin (), the general Chen Xuanli (), and eunuchs and ladies in waiting close to the emperor.

On July 15, Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s train reached Mawei Station (馬嵬驛, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). The imperial guards were not fed and were angry at Yang Guozhong. Chen also believed that Yang Guozhong provoked this disaster and planned to kill him—and reported his plans to Li Heng through Li Heng&#x27;s eunuch Li Fuguo, but Li Heng was hesitated and gave no approval. Meanwhile, though, emissaries of the Tibetan Empire, who had followed Emperor Xuanzong south, were meeting with Yang Guozhong and complaining that they were also not fed. The imperial guard soldiers took this opportunity to proclaim that Yang Guozhong was planning treason along with the Tibetan emissaries, and they killed him, along with his son Yang Xuan (), the Ladies of Han and Qin, and Wei Fangjin. Wei Jiansu was also nearly killed, but was spared at the last moment with severe injuries. The soldiers then surrounded Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s pavilion, and refused to scatter even after Emperor Xuanzong came out to comfort them and order them to scatter. Chen publicly urged him to put Consort Yang to death—which Emperor Xuanzong initially declined. After Wei Jiansu&#x27;s son Wei E () and Gao Lishi spoke further, Emperor Xuanzong finally resolved to do so. He therefore had Gao take Consort Yang to a Buddhist shrine and allow her a forced suicide, considered a more dignified death than outright execution. After he showed the body to Chen and the other imperial guard generals, the guard soldiers finally scattered and prepared for further movement. Meanwhile, Yang Guozhong&#x27;s wife Pei Rou, son Yang Xi (), the Lady of Guo, and the Lady of Guo&#x27;s son Pei Hui () tried to flee, but were killed in flight.

<text>Yang Zhao (楊昭) (21 February 584 – 30 August 606), formally Crown Prince Yuande (元德太子, literally &quot;the discerning and nurturing crown prince&quot;), posthumously honored as Emperor Xiaocheng (孝成皇帝, literally &quot;the filial and successful emperor&quot;) with the temple name Shizong (世宗) during the brief reign of his son Yang Tong, was a crown prince of the Chinese Sui dynasty. He was the oldest son of Emperor Yang (Yang Guang) who predeceased his father. Yang Zhao was described as a fat-looking man with great physical strength.

== Background ==
Yang Zhao was born in February 584, while his father Yang Guang was the Prince of Jin under his grandfather Emperor Wen. His mother was Yang Guang&#x27;s wife Princess Xiao, and he was their oldest son. In his infancy, he was raised by his grandparents Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu. In 590, Emperor Wen created him the Prince of Henan. He initially married the daughter of the official Cui Hongsheng () as his wife and princess, but after Princess Cui&#x27;s aunt, who married his uncle Yang Jun the Prince of Qin, was discovered to have poisoned Yang Jun over her jealousness for Yang Jun&#x27;s concubines in 597, Yang Zhao divorced his wife and married the daughter of the official Wei Shou () the Duke of Hua as his wife and princess. After his father Yang Guang displaced his uncle Yang Yong as crown prince in 600, Yang Zhao was created his father&#x27;s old title of Prince of Jin in 601.

== As crown prince ==
In 604, Emperor Wen died—a death that most traditional historians believed to be a murder ordered by Yang Guang, but admitted a lack of direct evidence—and Yang Guang took the throne as Emperor Yang. Soon, believing the words of the sorcerer Zhangchou Taiyi () that the geography of the region surrounding the capital Chang&#x27;an was unsuitable for him, Emperor Yang took up residence at Luoyang and made it the eastern capital. He left Yang Zhao in charge at Chang&#x27;an. In spring 605, Emperor Yang created Yang Zhao crown prince. Emperor Yang considered restoring Princess Cui, but when he sent a messenger to the house of Princess Cui&#x27;s uncle Cui Hongdu () to discuss the matter, Cui Hongdu did not realize that an imperial messenger had arrived and therefore did not respond. Emperor Yang was displeased, and the matter was not again discussed.

In 606, Yang Zhao went to Luoyang to greet his parents, and he spent several months there. He requested permission to remain longer at Luoyang, but Emperor Yang denied it. Meanwhile, because he was required to kneel before his father and had to do so repeatedly while at Luoyang, and he was severely overweight, he became ill from the fatigue, and he died in summer 606. When his son Yang Tong later took the throne in 618 during the dynasty&#x27;s disintegration, he was posthumously honored as an emperor.

== Family ==
Consorts and their respective issue(s):
*Princess Consort of Henan, of the Cui clan of Boling (河南王妃 博陵崔氏)

<text>Robert Woodrow Wilson (born January 10, 1936) is an American astronomer who, along with Arno Allan Penzias, discovered cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) in 1964. The pair won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for its discovery.

While doing tests and experiments with the Holmdel Horn Antenna at Bell Labs in Holmdel Township, New Jersey, Wilson and Penzias discovered a source of noise in the atmosphere that they could not explain. After removing all potential sources of noise, including pigeon droppings on the antenna, the noise was finally identified as CMB, which served as important corroboration of the Big Bang theory.

In 1970, Wilson led a team that made the first detection of a rotational spectral line of carbon monoxide (CO) in an astronomical object, the Orion Nebula, and eight other galactic sources. Subsequently, CO observations became the standard method of tracing cool molecular interstellar gas, and detection of CO was the foundational event for the fields of millimeter and submillimeter astronomy.

==Life and work==
Robert Woodrow Wilson was born on January 10, 1936, in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Lamar High School in River Oaks, in Houston, and studied as an undergraduate at Rice University, also in Houston, where he was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa society. He then earned a PhD in physics at California Institute of Technology. His thesis advisors at Caltech included John Bolton and Maarten Schmidt.

Wilson and Penzias also won the Henry Draper Medal of the National Academy of Sciences in 1977. Wilson received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1987.

Wilson remained at Bell Laboratories until 1994, when he was named a senior scientist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Wilson has been a resident of Holmdel Township, New Jersey.

Wilson married Elizabeth Rhoads Sawin in 1958.

Wilson is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to &quot;reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill&quot; by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Wilson was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2009.

<text>James Martin Barnes (April 8, 1886 – May 24, 1966) was an English golfer and a leading figure in the early years of professional golf in the United States. He is one of three native Britons (with Tommy Armour and Rory McIlroy) to win three different modern major professional championships.

==Early life==
Barnes was born on April 8, 1886, in Lelant, Cornwall. Barnes was like many golfers of his era, and worked as a caddie and a club-maker&#x27;s apprentice while growing up. He moved to the United States and turned professional in 1906, but never became an American citizen. He arrived in San Francisco, and later worked in Vancouver, British Columbia, Spokane, Washington, and Tacoma, Washington, and then at The Broadmoor in Colorado Springs.

==Golf career==
From 1923 to 1926, he was resident professional at the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club in Temple Terrace, Florida, which hosted the 1925 Florida Open (dubbed &quot;The Greatest Field of Golfers Ever to Play in Florida&quot;), as well as the 1926 Florida Open with over one hundred contestants and a $5,000 cash prize. In 1925–26 his good friend and fellow golfer Fred McLeod wintered with him, and they worked with James Kelly Thomson from North Berwick.

Barnes was also known as &quot;Long Jim&quot; for his height of . He later moved west to the Oakland, California, area where he resided for many years. Barnes authored several books on golf technique. He died at age 80 in East Orange, New Jersey, and is buried in Orange&#x27;s Rosedale Cemetery.

He won nine majors, with four of them the modern professional majors. Many golfers and media covering the sport at the time, according to golf journalist Dan Jenkins, the Western Open and North and South Open titles he won at the time were declared majors.

*PGA Championship: 1916, 1919
*U.S. Open: 1921
*The Open Championship: 1925
*Western Open: 1914, 1917, 1919
*North and South Open: 1916, 1919

Barnes&#x27; two PGA titles were the first in the event; there was no tournament in 1917 or 1918 because of World War I. His winning margin in the 1921 U.S. Open was nine strokes, a record which was not broken until Tiger Woods won by 15 strokes in 2000.

Barnes was one of the most prolific tournament winners of the first few seasons of the PGA Tour, which was also founded in 1916. He won 22 times on the tour in total. He led the tournament winners list in four seasons: 1916 with three, 1917 with two (shared with Mike Brady), 1919 with five and 1921 with four. His win in the 1937 Long Island Open marked the first PGA Tour win by a player past his 50th birthday. In 1940, Barnes was honored as one of the 12 golfers to be inducted in the PGA&#x27;s inaugural Hall of Fame. Later he was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1989.

==Early life and education==
Penzias was born in Munich, Germany, the son of Justine (née Eisenreich) and Karl Penzias, who ran a leather business. His grandparents had come to Munich from Poland and were among the leaders of the Reichenbachstrasse shul. At age six, he and his brother Gunther were among the Jewish children evacuated to Britain as part of the Kindertransport rescue operation. Some time later, his parents also fled Nazi Germany, first for the United Kingdom, and then for the United States, and the family settled in the Bronx, New York City in 1940. In 1946, Penzias became a naturalized citizen of the United States. 

He graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in 1951 and after enrolling to study chemistry at the City College of New York, he changed majors and graduated 1954 with a degree in physics, ranked near the top of his class. Following graduation, Penzias served for two years as a radar officer in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. This led to a research assistantship in the Columbia University Radiation Laboratory, which was then heavily involved in microwave physics. Penzias worked under Charles H. Townes, who later invented the maser. Penzias enrolled as a graduate student at Columbia University in 1956, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree and a PhD in physics, the latter in 1962.

==Career==
Penzias went on to work at Bell Labs in Holmdel Township, New Jersey, where, with Robert Woodrow Wilson, he worked on ultra-sensitive cryogenic microwave receivers, intended for radio astronomy observations. In 1964, on building their most sensitive antenna/receiver system, the pair encountered radio noise that they could not explain. It was far less energetic than the radiation given off by the Milky Way, and it was isotropic, so they assumed their instrument was subject to interference by terrestrial sources. They tried, and then rejected, the hypothesis that the radio noise emanated from New York City. An examination of the microwave horn antenna showed it was full of bat and pigeon droppings, which Penzias described as &quot;white dielectric material&quot;. After the pair removed the dung buildup the noise remained. Having rejected all sources of interference, Penzias contacted Robert H. Dicke, who suggested it might be the background radiation predicted by some cosmological theories. The pair agreed with Dicke to publish side-by-side letters in the Astrophysical Journal, with Penzias and Wilson describing their observations and Dicke suggesting the interpretation as the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the radio remnant of the Big Bang. This proved to be landmark evidence for the Big Bang and provided substantial confirmation for predictions made by Ralph Asher Alpher, Robert Herman and George Gamow in the 1940s and 1950s.

==Personal life==
Penzias was a resident of Highland Park, New Jersey, in the 1990s. In 1996, Penzias married Silicon Valley executive Sherry Levit. He had a son, David, and two daughters, Mindy Penzias Dirks, and Rabbi Shifra (Laurie) Weiss-Penzias. Penzias also had a stepson, Carson, and a stepdaughter, Victoria.

Penzias died from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at an assisted living facility in San Francisco, on January 22, 2024, at the age of 90.

==Honors and awards==
Penzias was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences in 1975. In 1977, Penzias and Wilson received the Henry Draper Medal of the National Academy of Sciences. The two were awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation, sharing it with Pyotr Kapitsa. Kapitsa&#x27;s work on low-temperature physics was unrelated to Penzias&#x27; and Wilson&#x27;s. In 1979, Penzias received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was also the recipient of The International Center in New York&#x27;s Award of Excellence. In 1998, he was awarded the IRI Medal from the Industrial Research Institute.

On April 26, 2019, the Nürnberger Astronomische Gesellschaft e.V. (NAG) inaugurated the 3-meter radio telescope at the Regiomontanus-Sternwarte, the public observatory of Nuremberg, and dedicated this instrument to Arno Penzias.

On September 11, 2023, the Radio Club of America said that Penzias would be honored with the inauguration of the &quot;Dr. Arno A. Penzias Award for Contributions to Basic Research in the Radio Sciences.&quot; The club said the award recognizes his significant contributions to basic research involving radio frequency and related subjects and that it would inspire future generations of scientific professionals. The club also announced that the first recipient of the new award will be named in 2024.

<text>Patricia Jane Berg (February 13, 1918 – September 10, 2006) was an American professional golfer. She was a founding member and the first president of the LPGA. Her 15 major title wins remains the all-time record for most major wins by a female golfer. She is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame.

In winter times she was also a speed skater.

==Amateur career==
Berg was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and expressed an interest in football at an early age. At one point, she played quarterback on a local team that included future Oklahoma Sooners head football coach Bud Wilkinson. At the age of 13, Berg took up golf in 1931 at the suggestion of her parents; by 1934, she began her amateur career and won the Minneapolis City Championship. The following year, Berg claimed a state amateur title. She attended the University of Minnesota where she was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. She came to national attention by reaching the final of the 1935 U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur, losing to Glenna Collett-Vare in Vare&#x27;s final Amateur victory. Berg won the Titleholders in 1937. In 1938, she won the U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur at Westmoreland and the Women&#x27;s Western Amateur. With a victory in the 1938 Titleholders Championship and a spot on the winning Curtis Cup team as well, Berg was selected as the Associated Press Woman Athlete of the Year, the first of three times she earned the honor. In 1939, Berg won her third consecutive Titleholders, although she was unable to compete in the U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur due to an operation on her appendix.

==Professional career==
After winning 29 amateur titles, she turned professional in 1940. Berg&#x27;s career had been interrupted by an automobile accident in December 1941; while traveling to a fund-raising event with Helen Dettweiler, a head-on accident shattered Berg&#x27;s knee.
Subsequently, she recovered and volunteered for the United States Marine Corps and was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1942. She served in the Marine Reserves from 1942 to 1945.

Despite concerns that her golfing career would end, Berg returned to the game in 1943, helped by a locker room fall that broke adhesions which had developed in her leg. Upon her comeback, she won the Women&#x27;s Western Open. She won the inaugural U.S. Women&#x27;s Open in 1946. In 1948, she helped establish the forerunner of the LPGA, the Women&#x27;s Professional Golf Association (WPGA), winning three tournaments that season and in 1949. When the LPGA was officially started in 1950, Berg was one of the 13 founding members and held a leadership position as the association&#x27;s first president. Berg won a total of 57 events on the LPGA and WPGA circuit, and was runner-up in the 1957 Open at Winged Foot. She was runner-up in the 1956 and 1959 LPGA Championships. In addition, Berg won the 1953, 1957, and 1958 Women&#x27;s Western Opens, the 1955 and 1957 Titleholders, both considered majors at the time. Her last victory came in 1962. She was voted the Associated Press Woman Athlete of the Year in 1942 and 1955, in addition to her 1938 award. During a four-year stretch from 1953 to 1956, Berg won the Vare Trophy three times for having the lowest scoring average on the LPGA. She was the LPGA Tour&#x27;s top money winner twice, in 1954 and 1957, and her seven Titleholders wins is an all-time record. Berg won 15 women&#x27;s major golf championships in her career, including the seven Titleholders victories, seven wins in the Women&#x27;s Western Open, and the 1946 U.S. Women&#x27;s Open championship.

In 1959, Berg became the first woman to hit a hole-in-one during a USGA competition, which happened at the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open.

In 1963, Berg was voted the recipient of the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf. Berg received the 1986 Old Tom Morris Award from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, GCSAA&#x27;s highest honor. The LPGA established the Patty Berg Award in 1978. In her later years, Berg teamed-up with PGA Tour player and fellow Fort Myers, Florida resident Nolan Henke to establish the &quot;Nolan Henke/Patty Berg Junior Masters&quot; to promote the development of young players.

Berg was sponsored on the LPGA Tour her entire career by public golf patriarch Joe Jemsek, owner of the famous Cog Hill Golf &amp; Country Club in Lemont, Illinois, site of the PGA Tour&#x27;s Western Open from 1991 to 2006. Berg represented another of Jemsek&#x27;s public facilities, St. Andrews Golf &amp; Country Club in West Chicago, Illinois, on the women&#x27;s circuit for over 60 years.

Berg told &quot;Chicagoland Golf&quot; magazine she taught over 16,000 clinics in her lifetime – many of which were sponsored by Chicago-based Wilson Sporting Goods and were called &quot;The Patty Berg Hit Parade.&quot; In that interview, Berg figured she personally indoctrinated to the game of golf over a half-million new players. She was a member of Wilson&#x27;s Advisory Staff for 66 years, until her death.

She announced in December 2004 that she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She died in Fort Myers from complications of the disease 21 months later at the age of 88.

<text>Jørgen Ingmann (born Jørgen Ingmann Pedersen; 26 April 1925 – 21 March 2015) was a Danish jazz and pop guitarist from Copenhagen. He was popular in Europe and had a wider international hit in 1961 with his version of &quot;Apache&quot;. He and his wife Grethe Ingmann won the 1963 Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Dansevise&quot;.

==Career==
Jørgen Ingmann Pedersen was born in Copenhagen, and first performed as a guitarist with Svend Asmussen, the jazz violinist, during the 1940s and early 1950s, in a group known as the Unmelancholy Danes.

He was influenced by American guitarist and recording studio pioneer Les Paul. In the mid-1950s he set up his own studio where he developed techniques of multi-tracking and distortion, using his own accompaniment on bass and drums, and began recording under the name Jørgen Ingmann &amp; His Guitar.

Under this name he recorded a version of &quot;Apache&quot; in the fall of 1960; &quot;Apache&quot; was originally recorded in June 1960 by the British group the Shadows. Ingmann&#x27;s cover version charted in 1961 at #1 in Canada on the CHUM Chart, #2 in the United States on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles chart, #9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart, #4 on &quot;Cashbox&quot;, and #6 in Germany.

He remade Silvana Mangano&#x27;s &quot;Anna&quot; with moderate US chart success. In the first half of the 1960s he had many hits in Germany, including &quot;Pepe&quot; (1961 #15), &quot;Anna&quot; (1961 #19), &quot;Violetta&quot; (1962 #16), &quot;Drina Marsch&quot; (1964 #5) and &quot;Zorba le Grec&quot; (1965 #14).

&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported that he charted at no. 2 on the Denmark pop singles chart with his recording of &quot;Marchen Til Drina&quot; on 7 December 1963. His recording reached no. 1 on 17 December 1963. Other recordings of his included &quot;Tequila&quot; (which he also recorded during the 60s, with the Champs) and a version of Pinetop Perkins&#x27; &quot;Pinetop&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot; (from 1962).

He also worked as a member of the duet, Grethe og Jørgen Ingmann, together with his wife Grethe Ingmann. After winning the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix competition in 1963, they went on to represent Denmark at the Eurovision Song Contest 1963 where they won with the song &quot;Dansevise&quot; (Dance Ballad), music by Otto Francker and lyrics by Sejr Volmer-Sørensen. His best jazz work is to be found on the LP &quot;Guitar in Hifi&quot; which, apart from &quot;Margie&quot;, the first track, has many songs written by Hoagy Carmichael. It was issued in England on a 10-inch LP and in other places as a 12-inch LP. In the USA it was called &quot;Jorgan Ingmann Swings Softly&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
He and Grethe met in 1955, married in 1956, and divorced in 1975. They remarried in the 1980s. Grethe Ingmann died 18 August 1990 from cancer, age 52. Jørgen Ingmann died on 21 March 2015, aged 89.

<text>Julius Nicolas Boros (March 3, 1920 – May 28, 1994) was an American professional golfer noted for his effortless-looking swing and strong record on difficult golf courses, particularly at the U.S. Open.

==Early life and amateur career==
Born in Fairfield, Connecticut, Boros was of Hungarian descent, and played varsity baseball in college. He then worked as an accountant while playing high-standard amateur golf.

==Professional career==
Boros turned professional in 1949 at age 29. He won 18 PGA Tour events, including three major championships: the 1952 and 1963 U.S. Opens and the 1968 PGA Championship. He won his first by four strokes in the heat at the Northwood Club in Dallas, also his first PGA Tour victory, which interrupted the U.S. Open streak of 36-hole leader Ben Hogan for a year. In the windy 1963 U.S. Open near Boston, Boros defeated Arnold Palmer and Jacky Cupit in a playoff, after all had finished the 72 holes at a post-war record nine over par.

For over a half century, Boros was the oldest player to win a modern major, taking the 1968 PGA Championship in San Antonio by a stroke at age 48. One of the runners-up was Palmer, who never won the PGA Championship to complete his career grand slam. The previous oldest winner of a major was Old Tom Morris, age 46 in the 1867 Open Championship. 
Boros&#x27; mark was surpassed by Phil Mickelson, who won the PGA Championship in 2021 at age fifty.

Boros&#x27; best results among the majors were at the U.S. Open, with nine top-five finishes; he contended in that championship as late as 1973 at age 53, and tied for seventh.

Boros was a member of the Ryder Cup team in 1959, 1963, 1965, and 1967. He was PGA Player of the Year in 1952 and 1963, and his total career PGA Tour earnings were $1,004,861. Boros was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1982.

While other players often walked around a hole and studied the green for several minutes before putting – sometimes from their knees, Boros is remembered for not wasting any time on either the greens or the fairways. He would walk up to the ball and &quot;just do it&quot;. Noted for his relaxed, nonchalant-looking swing and manner, he is remembered for his catchphrase &quot;swing easy, hit hard.&quot; Boros had an exceptional short game.

Boros was also instrumental in starting the Senior PGA Tour in the late 1970s. The exciting televised playoff victory of Boros and partner Roberto De Vicenzo over Tommy Bolt and Art Wall Jr. at the Legends of Golf tournament in 1979 raised the profile of professional senior golf competition.

==Personal life==
Boros&#x27; first wife, Buttons Cosgrove, died in childbirth in 1951. Boros and his second wife, Armen, had seven children: four sons and three daughters. His son Guy Boros won on the PGA Tour in 1996, at the Greater Vancouver Open in late August.

Boros suffered a fatal heart attack in 1994 on the golf course at the Coral Ridge Country Club in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He was found sitting in a golf cart under a willow tree by two club members near the 16th hole, his favorite spot on the course.

<text>The Virginia Company was an English trading company chartered by King James I on 10 April 1606 with the objective of colonizing the eastern coast of America. The coast was named Virginia, after Elizabeth I, and it stretched from present-day Maine to the Carolinas. The company&#x27;s shareholders were Londoners, and it was distinguished from the Plymouth Company, which was chartered at the same time and composed largely of gentlemen from Plymouth, England.

The biggest trade breakthrough resulted after adventurer and colonist John Rolfe introduced several sweeter strains of tobacco from the Caribbean. These yielded a more appealing product than the harsh-tasting tobacco native to Virginia. Cultivation of Rolfe&#x27;s new tobacco strains produced a strong commodity crop for export for the London Company and other early English colonies and helped to balance a national trade deficit with Spain. The company failed in 1624, following the widespread destruction of the Great Massacre of 1622 by indigenous peoples in the colony, which decimated the English population. On 24 May, James dissolved the company and made Virginia a royal colony from England with propertied male colonists retaining some representative-government through the lower house, the House of Burgesses.

== History ==
===The Plymouth Company===


In 1606, a ruling council in London composed of major shareholders in the enterprise. The members were nominated by the company and appointed by James. The council in England then directed the settlers to appoint their own local council, which proved ineffective. The council had to obtain approval from London for expenditures and laws, and limited the enterprise to 100 square miles.

The Charter of 1606 did not mention a Virginia Company or a Plymouth Company; these names were applied somewhat later to the overall enterprise. The Charter of 1609 stipulates two distinct companies:
that they should divide themselves into two colonies, the one consisting of divers Knights, gentlemen, merchants and others of our cittie of London, called the First Collonie; and the other of sondrie Knights, gentlemen and others of the cities of Bristol, Exeter, the town of Plymouth, and other places, called the Second Collonie.

By the terms of the charter, the London Company was permitted to establish a colony of 100 miles square between latitudes 34° and 41° N, approximately between Cape Fear and Long Island Sound. It also owned a large portion of inland Canada. The company established the Jamestown Settlement in present-day Jamestown, Virginia on 14 May 1607, about 40 miles inland along the James River, a major tributary of the Chesapeake Bay in present-day Virginia. In 1620, George Calvert asked James for a charter for English Catholics, so the territory could be added to the Plymouth Company.

The Plymouth Company was permitted to establish settlements between latitudes 38° and 45° N, roughly between the upper reaches of the Chesapeake Bay and the U.S.-Canada border. On 13 August 1607, the Plymouth Company established the Popham Colony along the Kennebec River in Maine. However, it was abandoned after about a year and the Plymouth Company became inactive. A successor company eventually established a permanent settlement in 1620 when the Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts, aboard the Mayflower.

The Second Charter expanded the area of the enterprise from sea to sea and appointed a governor, because the local councils had proven ineffective. Governor Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr (known as Lord Delaware) sailed for America in 1610. James delegated the governor of Virginia absolute power.

Also in 1609, a much larger Third Supply mission was organized. A new purpose-built ship named the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; was rushed into service without the customary sea trials. She became the flagship of a fleet of nine ships, with most of the leaders, food, and supplies aboard. Aboard the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; were fleet Admiral George Somers, Vice-Admiral Christopher Newport, Virginia Colony governor Sir Thomas Gates, William Strachey, and businessman John Rolfe with his pregnant wife.

The third supply convoy encountered a hurricane that lasted three days and separated the ships from one another. The &quot;Sea Venture&quot; was leaking through its new caulking, and Admiral Somers had it driven aground on a reef to avoid sinking, saving 150 men and women but destroying the ship. The uninhabited archipelago was officially named &quot;The Somers Isles&quot; after Admiral Somers. The survivors built two smaller ships from salvaged parts of the &quot;Sea Venture,&quot; which they named &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot;.

Ten months later, they continued on to Jamestown, arriving on 23 May 1610. They left several men behind on the archipelago to establish possession of it. At Jamestown, they found that more than 85-percent of the 500 colonists there had perished during the &quot;Starving Time&quot;. The &quot;Sea Venture&quot; passengers had anticipated finding a thriving colony and had brought little food or supplies with them. The colonists at Jamestown were saved only by the timely arrival three weeks later of a supply mission headed by Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, better known as &quot;Lord Delaware&quot;.

The Virginia Company of London failed to discover gold or silver in Virginia, to the disappointment of its investors. However, they did establish trade of various types. The company benefitted from lotteries held throughout England until they were cancelled by the Crown. The company even considered titles of nobility to gain support for the colony.

In February 1613, company projects were promoted at court when the lawyer Richard Martin helped produce &quot;The Memorable Masque of the Middle Temple and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn&quot; at Whitehall Palace for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V of the Palatinate. The masque represented Virginian peoples on the stage and also introduced the theme of gold mining.

In 1612, the company&#x27;s charter was officially extended to include the Somers Isles as part of the Virginia Colony. However, the isles passed to the London Company of the Somers Isles in 1615, which had been formed by the same shareholders as the London Company. The third charter expanded territory eastward to include Summer Islands and other islands.

On 18 November 1618, Virginia Company officers Thomas Smythe and Edwin Sandys sent a set of instructions to Virginia governor George Yeardley, which are often referred to as &quot;The Great Charter&quot;, though it was not issued by James. This charter gave the colony self-governance, which led to the establishment of a Council of State appointed by the governor and an elected General Assembly (House of Burgesses), and provided that the colony would no longer be financed by shares but by tobacco farming. The birth of representative government in the United States can be traced from this Great Charter, as it provided for self-governance from which the House of Burgesses and a General Council were created.

The indigenous peoples had grown increasingly resistant to the competition from the colonists and mistreatment at their hands. They rose in what is known as Jamestown Massacre of 1622, also known as the Great Massacre, which decimated the population. Survivors of some eighty plantations gathered into eight near Jamestown. In England, company officers debated over guarding the original charter, or deciding to disband the company. The Jamestown Massacre brought unfavorable attention to the colony, particularly from James who had originally chartered the company.

There was a period of debate in England between company officers who wished to guard the original charter, and those who wanted the company to be disbanded. On 24 May 1624, James dissolved the company and made Virginia a royal colony.

<text>A stamped envelope or postal stationery envelope (PSE) is an envelope with a printed or embossed indicium indicating the prepayment of postage. It is a form of postal stationery.

==United Kingdom==
The Sherborn Collection in the British Library Philatelic Collections is an important collection of 1841-85 Queen Victoria embossed 1d pink stamped envelopes. The collection was formed by C. Davis Sherborn and donated to the British Museum in 1913.

==United States==

In August 1852, an Act of the US Congress authorized the Postmaster General to provide &quot;suitable letter envelopes with such watermarks or other guards against counterfeits... with the addition of the value or denomination of the postage stamps so printed or impressed thereon...&quot; The first result was the 1853 Nesbitt issues of stamped envelopes, which was named after the private contractor who produced them for the government. When the different envelope sizes, knives, colors, dies to print the indicia, and denominations are combined, there are literally thousands of different stamped envelopes produced for the US.

==Collecting==
Collectors of stamped envelopes use a catalog to know what has been issued.

Siegfried Ascher was the first to try to comprehensively document all countries&#x27; postal stationery including stamped envelopes. This was followed some 40 years later by the Higgins &amp; Gage World Postal Stationery Catalog. Though now out of date, it is still frequently cited since it covers all countries and no other comprehensive catalog has been attempted since. The H&amp;G catalog, as it is known, describes stamped envelopes by the envelope size, the depicted indicia and its valuations, some corner cards, while sometimes disregarding envelope color.

The Scott catalogue is the United States envelope color and value of the indicia which is perfect for dealing with cut squares, but falls short of information needed to collect entires, i.e. the whole envelope. The United Postal Stationery Society has two published books cataloging U.S. stamped envelopes. These books describe all of the other stated criteria plus the envelope knife making them the most complete U.S. stamped envelope catalogs.

British postal stationery to 1970 has been comprehensively documented and Edifil is a Spanish company that has comprehensive listings for stamped envelopes of Spain, Cuba, Philippines and Puerto Rico.

Australian Postal Stationery is covered by a catalogue from Brusden White. The &#x27;Australian Commonwealth Specialists&#x27; Catalogue: Postal Stationery including Australian Territories&#x27; was first issued in 2013. In 2018 a fully revised 2nd edition was released. Fully illustrated, it is the most comprehensive reference work for these Australian issues.

Most stamped envelopes are collected as entires. In the 19th century the practice was to collect cut squares (or cut-outs in the U.K.) which involved cutting the embossed indicia from a postal envelope. This destroyed the envelope. As a result, one cannot tell from a cut square what specific envelope it came from and, many times, the cancellation information. The manner in which the stamped envelope is cut before folding (that is, its knife) vanishes on a cut square. The envelope size disappears, too, with a cut square.

In collecting entires, a single indicium may appear on many different sizes of envelopes. Some countries have issued the same indicium on different paper types: laid and wove. Likewise it is common for the same indicium to be embossed onto paper of several different colors. Finally, two envelopes of the same size can have a different flap size indicating that they were cut from a different knife. Rarely, an uncatalogued color, or displaced surcharge, or albino indicium, or inside-out folding of the envelope may appear, in which case you have found something of value. All of these attributes relate to mint or unused envelopes. When you add a postmark from a used envelope to the mix, the collecting possibilities explode. What was formerly in fashion, collecting only mint examples, has changed because many collectors seem to find used PSE collections more interesting.
Some postal stationery envelopes contain a corner card, a printed return address on the envelope, usually in the upper left hand corner. This can range from a simple town and country notation to an elaborate illustrated advertisement for a business. Corner cards are either applied by an after-market print shop or by dealing with the government related entity that produces the stamped envelopes.

<text>John Joseph Burke Jr. (January 29, 1923 – January 19, 2024) was an American professional golfer who was most prominent in the 1950s. The son of a professional golfer, Jack Burke Sr., he won two major titles, both in 1956, the Masters and PGA Championship, and is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame.

Burke won 16 PGA Tour events between 1950 and 1963. He won four times in 1950 and five times in 1952, including four in consecutive weeks in February and March. He had not won since 1953 when he won the 1956 Masters, coming from eight strokes behind in the final round to overtake leader Ken Venturi, an amateur, who took 80. Later in 1956 he won the PGA Championship, beating Ted Kroll 3&amp;2 in the final. His last tour win came in 1963, just before his 40th birthday. Burke was on five successive American Ryder Cup teams from 1951 to 1959, serving as playing captain in 1957, when Great Britain won for the first time since 1933, and as the non-playing captain in 1973. He had a successful playing record, winning 7 of his 8 matches, only losing his singles match in 1957.

In 1957, Burke and Jimmy Demaret founded Champions Golf Club in Houston. The club has hosted a number of important events including the 1967 Ryder Cup and the 1969 U.S. Open.

==Early life==
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, Burke started playing golf at the age of seven. His father, Jack Burke Sr., was the club professional at Houston&#x27;s River Oaks Country Club until his sudden death in 1943. He was a runner-up at the U.S. Open in 1920. The younger Burke graduated from St. Thomas High School in Houston in 1940. He attended Rice University in 1941. While still an amateur he qualified for the 1941 U.S. Open, the first to be played in Texas, but missed the cut. In 1942 he became the professional at Galveston Country Club. From 1942 to 1946 he served in the U.S. Marine Corps and was stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar where he taught combat skills to Marines headed overseas for World War II.

==Golf career==
After the war, Burke resumed his golf career after first considering work in the oil fields of Texas. His first job was as a teaching professional at Hollywood Golf Club in Deal, New Jersey, which was followed by a position as an assistant at Winged Foot Golf Club, where he was mentored by Claude Harmon. From early 1948 he was the club professional at Metropolis Country Club in White Plains, New York.

In January 1949, Burke finished tied for the third place in the Long Beach Open, having led after 3 rounds. In September he won the Metropolitan Open at his home club, finishing six strokes ahead of Gene Sarazen. Burke started 1950 with a third-place finish in the Los Angeles Open. In the following days he was a joint winner in the Bing Crosby Pro-Am, one of four players who finished tied. In February he won his first outright tour event, the Rio Grande Valley Open and had further wins in March and July, finishing fifth in the PGA tour money list. He did not win in 1951 but was runner-up five times and again finished fifth in the money list. In February and March 1952 Burke won four successive tournaments in four weeks. Three of these he won by six or more strokes with the other being won in a three-way playoff. He had his fifth win of the season in December. In addition he lost two 18-hole playoffs during the year and finished second in the Masters. Burke won the Vardon Trophy for the lowest scoring average in 1952, finishing third in the money list.

Burke won a further PGA tour event in 1953 but only finished 19th in the money list. He did not win in 1954 but he finished second in the Vardon Trophy standings and second in the money list, helped by $7,500 won for a runner-up finish in the big money World Championship of Golf. In 1955 he dropped to 15th in the money list. He reach the quarterfinals of 1955 PGA Championship, losing a nine-hour, 40-hole quarterfinal match to Cary Middlecoff.

Burke won two majors in 1956, the Masters and the PGA Championship. In his Masters victory, Burke came from eight strokes behind in the final round to overtake Ken Venturi, then an amateur. After three rounds Venturi led by four strokes from Cary Middlecoff with the rest of the field at least seven shots behind. After 8 holes of the final round Venturi had a six-stroke lead over Middlecoff and Burke. Middlecoff took a double bogey at the 17th hole, his third of the round, and finished in third place. Burke completed the last 10 holes in level par while Venturi had seven bogeys, giving Burke a one-shot victory over Venturi with Middlecoff a further shot behind. For the 1956 PGA Championship the format had been changed with 128 players competing in a pure matchplay format, players qualifying through a mixture of exemptions and sectional qualifying. Previously there had been 36 holes of strokeplay followed by matchplay for the leading 64. Burke won 7 matches, defeating Leon Pounders, Bill Collins, Fred Haas, Chandler Harper and Fred Hawkins in 18 holes matches to reach the 36-hole semifinals. In his semifinal against Ed Furgol, Burke was 5-down after 14 holes of the morning round but recovered to win at the 37th hole, to meet Ted Kroll in the final. Kroll was 3-up after 19 holes but Burke made 5 birdies in 6 holes from the 4th hole to go 2-up and eventually won 3&amp;2. He was selected PGA Player of the Year in 1956, finishing 5th in the money list.

After 1956, Burke had less success although he won further PGA Tour events in 1958, 1959, 1961 and 1963 bringing his total to 16 over his career. In 1958, he finished 14th in the tour money list, his best season after 1956.

Burke was in five successive American Ryder Cup teams from 1951 to 1959. He was the playing captain in 1957 and the non-playing captain in 1973. He had a successful playing record, winning his first 7 matches; two matches in 1951, 1953 and 1955, and winning in the foursomes in 1957, before losing to Peter Mills in the singles. Mills won 5 holes in a row from the 6th to the 10th to be 5 up, finished the morning round 5 ahead and eventually won the match 5&amp;3. Great Britain won 6 of the 8 singles and halved another to win the Ryder Cup for the first time since 1933. Burke was in the 1959 Ryder Cup team but had a hand injury and was not selected for any matches.

Burke partnered with Jimmy Demaret to found Champions Golf Club in Houston in 1957. The 36-hole facility hosted a PGA Tour event from 1966 to 1971, today&#x27;s Shell Houston Open. As well, the club hosted the 1967 Ryder Cup, the 1969 U.S. Open, the 1993 U.S. Amateur, and the PGA Tour Championship in 1990, 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003. Burke was the fifth recipient of the PGA Tour Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003, and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2000.

Burke shares his permanent locker at Augusta National Golf Club, home of The Masters, with Tiger Woods. Both kept their green jackets in the locker, awarded to the winners of the tournament. Burke coached several current PGA Tour stars, including Phil Mickelson, in putting.

==Personal life==
Burke was first married to Ielene Lang in 1952. His second wife was Robin Moran, an amateur golfer. She was runner-up in the 1997 U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur, played in the 1998 Curtis Cup and was the captain of the American 2016 Curtis Cup team. She was inducted into the Texas Golf Hall of Fame in 2016. They ran the Champions Golf Club together.

Burke became a centenarian on January 29, 2023, and also became the first known major winner to turn 100.

===Death===
Burke died on January 19, 2024, 10 days before what would have been his 101st birthday. At the time of his death in 2024, Burke was the oldest living major golf champion.

<doc id="318542" wikidata="Q260379" url="?curid=318542" title="Hero (2002 film)">
<text>Hero () is a 2002 wuxia martial arts film directed, co-written, and produced by Zhang Yimou, and starring Jet Li, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Maggie Cheung, Zhang Ziyi, Donnie Yen and Chen Daoming. The cinematography was by Christopher Doyle, and the musical score composed by Tan Dun. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 75th Academy Awards.

The historical background of the film refers to the Warring States Period in ancient China, when China was divided into seven states. In 227–221 BC, the Qin state was about to unify the other six states, assassins from the six states were sent to assassinate the king of Qin. One of the most famous incidents was Jing Ke&#x27;s attempted assassination of the King of Qin.

&quot;Hero&quot; was first released in China on 24 October 2002. At that time, it was the most expensive project and one of the highest-grossing motion pictures in China. Miramax acquired American market distribution rights, but delayed the release of the film for nearly two years. Quentin Tarantino eventually convinced Miramax to open the film in American theaters on 27 August 2004.

The film received positive reviews from critics. It became the first Chinese-language movie to top the American box office, where it stayed for two consecutive weeks, and went on to earn $53.7 million in the United States and $177 million worldwide.

==Plot==
During the Warring States period, Nameless, a Qin prefect, arrives at the Qin capital city to meet the king, who has survived multiple assassination attempts by Long Sky, Flying Snow, and Broken Sword. Implementing tight security, the king forbids visitors from approaching within 100 paces. Nameless asserts he has killed the assassins, displaying their weapons. Impressed, the king permits Nameless to approach within ten paces to share his story.

Nameless recounts killing Sky at a gaming house before meeting Flying Snow and Broken Sword at a calligraphy school in a city besieged by the Qin army. Seeking to learn Sword&#x27;s skill, he commissions a calligraphy scroll with the character for &quot;Sword&quot; (劍). Nameless learns of Snow and Sword&#x27;s strained relationship. Upon completing the scroll, Nameless reveals his identity and the truth about Snow and Sky&#x27;s relationship. He challenges Snow to a duel.

Meanwhile, a heartbroken and furious Sword engages in a tryst with his pupil, Moon. Snow kills Sword in retaliation, and Moon when she seeks vengeance. The following day, Nameless slays an emotionally unstable Snow before the Qin army, seizing her sword.

As the story wraps up, the king doubts Nameless, alleging he orchestrated the duels with the assassins. During the previous attempt, the king saw Sword as honorable, doubting his betrayal of Snow. The king suggests the assassins sacrificed themselves to earn Nameless the king&#x27;s trust, enabling him to get close and assassinate the king.

In the king&#x27;s version of the story, Nameless approaches Snow and Sword after staging a battle with Sky. He claims to have mastered a technique to kill anyone within ten paces, including the king. To get close to the king, Nameless needs to present one of their weapons. Snow and Sword argue over who should sacrifice themselves, leading to a brief scuffle where Snow injures Sword. Snow faces Nameless before the Qin army, while Sword, still recovering, watches. Snow is defeated, and Moon later gives Nameless her master&#x27;s sword, suggesting that the swords of Snow and Sword should remain united even in death.

Nameless admits possessing the special technique the king mentioned but insists the King underestimated Sword. He reveals the technique&#x27;s dual nature: deadly yet capable of appearing fatal while avoiding vital organs. Nameless used it on Sky, then orchestrated a fake duel with Snow and Sword. Snow agrees, but Sword refuses. Snow accuses Sword of squandering their chance three years prior when he spared the king of Qin during their assault. In anger, she attacks Sword, wounding him with Nameless&#x27;s aid. The following day, Nameless &quot;kills&quot; Snow before the Qin army.

Later, Sword reveals to Nameless his decision to spare the king, expressing his desire for a unified, peaceful China achievable only through the king&#x27;s leadership. Sending Nameless to the Qin capital, Sword inscribes &quot;All Under Heaven&quot; (天下) in the sand, urging reconsideration of assassination. Touched by Sword&#x27;s understanding and the tale, the king overcomes his fear of Nameless. He relinquishes his sword, examines Sword&#x27;s scroll, and grasps the concept that an ideal warrior should lack the desire to kill. Moved by this wisdom, Nameless abandons his mission, sparing the king.

When Snow discovers that Sword persuaded Nameless to abandon the assassination, she angrily confronts Sword. Sword, refusing to defend himself, hopes Snow will grasp his love for her. However, Snow unintentionally kills Sword. Consumed by grief, Snow commits suicide.

Despite the king&#x27;s reluctance, he orders Nameless&#x27;s execution to uphold the law and set an example for national unity. Nameless is honored with a hero&#x27;s funeral.

==Cast==
* Jet Li as Nameless A Qin prefect of a small province, orphaned at an early age. Forged into a master swordsman over years of training, Nameless possesses the singular technique &quot;Death at Ten Paces&quot; allowing him to strike precisely within that distance. He is the primary conspirator to assassinate the king, but ultimately decides that China&#x27;s unification and peace are more important than vengeance. &quot;Hero&quot; also saw Jet Li&#x27;s first appearance in a film produced by mainland China, after his debut in &quot;Shaolin Temple&quot;.
* Tony Leung as Broken Sword Broken Sword and Flying Snow are the only assassins to ever infiltrate the king&#x27;s palace, killing hundreds of his personal guard and very nearly the king himself before halting at the last moment. Of all the assassins, Broken Sword is the only one whom Nameless considers his equal in swordsmanship.
* Maggie Cheung as Flying Snow A skilled assassin, Flying Snow is Broken Sword&#x27;s lover and his equal as a swordsman (or close to). She vowed revenge upon the King for killing her father in battle. When Broken Sword convinces Nameless to abandon the assassination attempt on the king, Flying Snow kills him and later herself.
* Chen Daoming as the King of Qin An ambitious leader who desires to become the first Emperor of China. Following an assassination attempt, he withdraws into his palace, which he empties of all but his most trusted advisors, and always wears his battle armor.
* Donnie Yen as Long Sky An accomplished spearman, Sky is the first to be &quot;defeated&quot; by Nameless, who takes Sky&#x27;s broken spear as proof of his defeat to the king.
* Zhang Ziyi as Fading Moon Broken Sword&#x27;s loyal apprentice, skilled in using twin swords.

==Production==
Director Zhang Yimou collaborated with Australian cinematographer Christopher Doyle to help realize his plan to divide the film visually into five sections, each dominated by a particular color. Zhang had initially wanted to use different cinematographers and shooting styles, but that proved impractical.

Doyle compared their story to &quot;Rashomon&quot;, as it has an unreliable narrator and stories within stories. The film tells different version of the story of how an anonymous hero in ancient China overcomes three rivals. The stories are dominated by the colors red, blue, and white. Red represents desire, possessiveness and jealousy. Blue represents reason and friendship. White represents the balance of reason and desire, the ultimate truth. The overall framing story is darker with shades of black, and flashbacks are shown in vibrant greens. The colors were chosen for their aesthetic reasons, not symbolic ones, and the colors orange and pink were not considered as options; Doyle was dismissive of universal theories of color, such as those put forward by Italian cinematographer Vittorio Storaro.

The lake sequences were filmed in the Jiuzhaigou national park in northern Sichuan, China. The desert sequences were shot near the border with Kazakhstan.

==Music==
The film was scored by Tan Dun, who also conducted the China Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus for the recording. The composer Chen Yuanlin also collaborated in the project. Itzhak Perlman performs most of the violin solos, with additional solos by Tan Dun himself. The theme song, &quot;Hero&quot; (英雄), composed by Zhang Yadong and Lin Xi, was sung by Faye Wong. It is unavailable in the American versions of the film DVD and soundtrack album. &quot;Wind &amp; Sand&quot; (風沙) is a song inspired by the film and was sung by Tony Leung. The musical instrument seen and played during the fight in the weiqi courtyard scene is a guqin. The guqin music for that scene was performed by Liu Li.

==Release==
&quot;Hero&quot; was first released in China on 24 October 2002. Miramax owned the American-market distribution rights, but delayed the release of the film a total of six times. Import DVDs of the film were sold online and Miramax demanded that the sites cease selling the DVD.

The movie was finally released in American theaters on 27 August 2004 after intervention by Disney executives, Government of China and Quentin Tarantino, who helped secure an English-subtitled release. Tarantino also offered to lend his name to promotional material for the film in order to attract box office attention to it; his name was attached to the credits as &quot;Quentin Tarantino Presents&quot;. In addition, a sword held by Jet Li&#x27;s character in the original promotional poster was replaced by weapon resembling a katana, a Japanese weapon, in the North American promotional poster, which was both anachronistic and culturally misplaced. The United States version of the DVD, with Mandarin, English, and French soundtracks, was released on 30 November 2004.

In the United Kingdom, it was 2013&#x27;s sixth most-watched foreign-language film on television, with 150,100 viewers on Channel 4.

===Translation of &quot;Tianxia&quot;===
There has been some criticism of the film for its American-release translation of one of the central ideas in the film: &quot;Tiānxià&quot; () which literally means &quot;Under heaven&quot;, and is a phrase to mean &quot;the World&quot;. For its release in Belgium, two years before the U.S. release, the subtitled translation was &quot;all under heaven&quot;. The version shown in American cinemas was localized as the two-word phrase &quot;our land&quot; instead, which seems to denote just the nation of China rather than the whole world. Whether Zhang Yimou intended the film to also have meaning with regard to the world and world unity was at that time difficult to say. Zhang Yimou was asked about the change at a screening in Massachusetts and said it was a problem of translation: &quot;If you ask me if &#x27;Our land&#x27; is a good translation, I can&#x27;t tell you. All translations are handicapped. Every word has different meanings in different cultures.&quot; In &quot;Cause: The Birth of Hero&quot;—a documentary on the making of &quot;Hero&quot;—Zhang mentions that he hopes the film will have some contemporary relevance, and that, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks the themes of universal brotherhood and &quot;peace under heaven&quot; may indeed be interpreted more globally, and taken to refer to peace in &quot;the world.&quot; The phrase was later changed in television-release versions of the film.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened in China in October 2002. It grossed within a week, and in three months. It topped the 2002 annual Chinese box office and set the record for the domestic highest-grossing film in China, earning ().

On 27 August 2004, after a long delay, &quot;Hero&quot; opened in 2,175 North American screens uncut and subtitled. It debuted at #1, grossing in its opening weekend. &quot;Hero&quot; grossed in the United States and Canada. It is currently the fifth highest grossing non-English film in North America, behind &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;, and &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot;. &quot;Hero&quot; grossed in international territories outside North America, for a worldwide total of .

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 210 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;With death-defying action sequences and epic historic sweep, &quot;Hero&quot; offers everything a martial arts fan could ask for.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 85 out of 100 based on 42 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert called it &quot;beautiful and beguiling, a martial arts extravaganza defining the styles and lives of its fighters within Chinese tradition.&quot; He said the film &quot;demonstrates how the martial arts genre transcends action and violence and moves into poetry, ballet and philosophy.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; described the film as being like &quot;&quot;Rashomon&quot; with a Mandarin accent&quot; and compared the film to &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot;, but said &quot;&quot;Hero&quot; is the masterpiece&quot;, adding that &quot;it employs unparalleled visual splendor to show why men must make war to secure the peace and how warriors may find their true destiny as lovers.&quot; Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it &quot;swooningly beautiful, furious and thrilling&quot; and &quot;an action movie for the ages.&quot; Charles Taylor of &quot;Salon&quot; took an especially positive stance, deeming it &quot;one of the most ravishing spectacles the movies have given us&quot;. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Filled with meticulous set pieces, including a showdown between Snow and Moon set among swirls of golden-yellow leaves, &quot;Hero&quot; is easy on the eyes, but it&#x27;s too segmented to gather much momentum and too art-directed to convey much urgency.&quot; Dargis was impressed by the beauty of the actors and their compelling performances, &quot;whose passions erupt as fiercely as any of the film&#x27;s fights though often to more devastating effect.&quot; She concludes: &quot;less than the sum of its attractive parts, it&#x27;s nonetheless generally pleasurable.&quot; Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; called it: &quot;A dazzlingly lensed, highly stylized meditation on heroism.&quot;
Nevertheless, there were several film critics who felt the film had advocated autocracy and reacted with discomfort. J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; deemed it to have a &quot;cartoon ideology&quot; and justification for ruthless leadership comparable to &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;. Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote an otherwise positive review, but concluded: &quot;The movie, spectacular as it is, in the end confronts what must be called the tyrant&#x27;s creed, and declares itself in agreement with the tyrant.&quot; The &quot;Sixth Generation&quot; movement director Jia Zhangke described the focus of the film as &quot;authority of power&quot; that &quot;for &#x27;harmony in the world,&#x27; we should give up individual fights and efforts&quot;, and made him uncomfortable.

The film also has been interpreted as a nuanced investigation into the relationship between culture on one hand, and political or military power on the other. In this approach, the film comments not only on China and its position in the world, but also on the ongoing erasures of languages and cultures under globalization.

Zhang Yimou himself maintained that he had absolutely no political points to make.

===Accolades===
In 2014, &quot;Time Out&quot; polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. &quot;Hero&quot; was listed at 77th place on this list.

<doc id="318544" wikidata="Q2361832" url="?curid=318544" title="Harry Cooper (golfer)">
<text>Henry Edward Cooper (August 4, 1904 – October 17, 2000) was an English-American PGA Tour golfer of the 1920s and 1930s. After he retired from competitive golf, he became a well-regarded instructor, into his 90s. In his long golf career he had 30 PGA Tour victories and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1992.

==Early life==
Cooper was born in the town of Leatherhead, England. His father Syd was a professional golfer who had served as an apprentice to Old Tom Morris at St. Andrews. His mother, Alice Cooper, was also a golf professional, a very rare career for women in that era. His family moved to Texas when Cooper was young, and his father took a job as a club professional in Dallas.

==Golf career==
Cooper honed his skills at Cedar Crest and turned professional in 1923. His first pro win, the Galveston Open in 1923, came before he turned twenty years of age. A perennial U.S. Open contender (with seven top-10 finishes and second place in 1927 and 1936), Cooper was nicknamed &quot;Lighthorse Harry&quot; by sportswriter Damon Runyon for his quick pace of play in winning the inaugural Los Angeles Open in 1926, completing the final 18 holes in 2.5 hours. (During the American Revolution, Lighthorse Harry Lee was a cavalry officer in the Continental Army, later the father of Confederate general Robert E. Lee.)

Cooper played in the inaugural Masters Tournament and placed second there in 1936 and 1938. He reached the semi-finals of the PGA Championship in 1925. In all, he finished in the top-10 11 times in major championships.

Cooper lost an 18-hole playoff to Tommy Armour for the 1927 U.S. Open title, at Oakmont Country Club. Armour had to make a birdie on the difficult 72nd hole, and did so with a long iron approach and a ten-foot putt, to tie Cooper, who had already finished.

At the U.S. Open in 1936 at Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, New Jersey, Cooper was involved in a highly controversial showdown with Tony Manero, who was suspected of cheating. Manero defeated Cooper, who had already finished with a then-record score, by two shots to win the tournament; over the final holes, Manero was apparently receiving assistance in club selection from Gene Sarazen, a top player and fellow Italian-American, who had already finished his round. The Rules of Golf were later modified to prevent this, specifying automatic disqualification for a player who received advice from anyone except his caddie.

His 30 PGA Tour titles are a record among players who never won a major championship, but Cooper did win the 1934 Western Open at a time when this event was one of the world&#x27;s most important titles.

In later years, Cooper would say that he had a mental hangup during major tournaments and couldn&#x27;t picture himself in the winner&#x27;s circle. His greatest successes were in Canada, as he won the Canadian Open in 1932 and 1937. He won 30 PGA Tour titles in all and the inaugural Vardon Trophy in 1937; his 30 titles were a record for PGA Tour players born outside the U.S. until surpassed by Vijay Singh in 2008. He was active as a senior golfer, placing sixth in the 1955 Senior PGA Championship. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1992.

Cooper was born in the United Kingdom, so he was ineligible to play for the U.S. in the Ryder Cup, although he had learned his golf in the U.S. after his family immigrated. This took him out of the chance for expenses-paid trips to Britain for that event and for the British Open on the same trip, a considerable setback, since travel costs to the U.K. were very high, and the prize money for the Open was very low during that era. Ironically, Cooper never competed in the British Open during his long career.

Cooper was the golf professional at Glen Oak Country Club in Glen Ellyn, Illinois from 1930 to 1937 and at Northmoor Country Club in Highland Park, Illinois from 1941 to 1942. He piled up many other titles, including wins in the first three tournaments held on Medinah Country Club&#x27;s No. 3 Course. He advanced to the semifinals of the PGA Championship in 1925, falling to eventual champion Walter Hagen. Statistically, Cooper&#x27;s best year was 1937, when he won eight times on Tour, and was both the leading money winner and the first winner of the Vardon Trophy.

==Later life==
After his career on tour ended, Cooper became the head professional at the Metropolis Country Club in Greenburgh, New York. He held that position from 1953 to 1978. Following his retirement from Metropolis, he took a teaching position at Westchester Country Club in Rye, New York, where he remained until his death. He was remarkable for his ability to work in the golf industry into his nineties. When Cooper died, he was the longest-serving member of the PGA of America.

Starting in the 1950s, Cooper became the director of golf for Home Lines, sailing first on their ship the &quot;Homeric&quot; and later the &quot;Oceanic&quot;. They sailed between New York City and the Caribbean Sea each year from the Christmas season through to the spring when he would return to his club. Aboard ship he taught golf and ran daily golf clinics for the passengers and when they reached the islands he arranged golf on shore for the passengers.

Cooper is often classified as the greatest golfer who never won a major tournament, with 30 career wins. Some claim this classification is erroneous because Cooper won the 1934 Western Open, which many considered one of golf&#x27;s major championships at that time. Although in its early decades the Western Open was widely regarded as a major championship, this designation was unofficial and it is generally not included in tallies of golfers&#x27; major championship wins. Other male professional golfer who have had a comparable record of repeated success at the major championships without yet winning one are Colin Montgomerie, Doug Sanders, Macdonald Smith, and Lee Westwood.

==Death and legacy==
Cooper had no children and died in a hospital in White Plains, New York in 2000. He and his wife Emma (who died in 2002) are interred in Lot 15, Graves 1 and 2, in the Kensico Gardens Section of the Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. His grave is now marked with a headstone, but his grave marker erroneously shows 1906 instead of 1904 as his birth year.

He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1992.

<doc id="318547" wikidata="Q715359" url="?curid=318547" title="Henry Cotton (golfer)">
<text>Sir Thomas Henry Cotton, MBE (28 January 1907 – 22 December 1987) was an English professional golfer. He won the Open Championship in 1934, 1937 and 1948, becoming the leading British player of his generation. The Rookie of the Year award in European Tour is named after him.

==Early life==
Cotton was born in Holmes Chapel, then known as Church Hulme, near Congleton, Cheshire on 28 January 1907. He had an older brother, Leslie (born 1905), who also became a professional golfer. Cotton was brought up in Crystal Palace Road, East Dulwich, London. He later went to Reigate Grammar School, and then won a scholarship to Alleyn&#x27;s School in Dulwich, South London. He was a useful cricketer, good enough to bat at number 3 for the school against Surrey Club and Ground, a team containing 5 professionals, at the age of 15. Cotton and his brother had already taken up a second sport, golf, at the Aquarius Golf Club in Honor Oak from 1920. In September 1921 the Cotton brothers played in the first Boys Amateur Championship, then limited to boys under 16. Henry played the eventual winner, Donald Mathieson, on the first day, losing by 2 holes, Cotton was all square after 16 holes but lost the 17th after being incorrectly penalised for placing his bag in a bunker. Cotton also played in the 1922 Boys Championship, again losing in the first round. In June 1923 Cotton won the Hutchings Trophy, the Championship of the Aquarius Club.

==Career==
Cotton left school in the summer of 1923 and soon started his career as a professional golfer, joining his older brother Leslie as assistant teaching professional at Fulwell Golf Club under Fulwell&#x27;s professional, George Oke, who had been at Honor Oak since 1921. Within a year Cotton had left and become an assistant at Rye Golf Club near Rye, East Sussex. During his time at Rye, Cotton travelled to Scotland to try to qualify for the 1925 Open Championship. However scores of 85 and 82 left him well outside the qualifying mark of 158. In March 1926, aged 19, he became the professional at Langley Park Golf Club near Beckenham in Kent, replacing Frank Ball who emigrated to America later the same year.

Cotton remained at Langley Park until the end of 1932 when he moved to the Waterloo Golf Club near Brussels, Belgium. While there, Cotton improved his game and by the time he left he was one of Britain&#x27;s leading golfers. In 1926, Cotton again failed to qualifying for the Open Championship but later in the year qualified for the knock-out stages of the Yorkshire Evening News Tournament and the News of the World Match Play and ended the season by winning the Kent Professional Championship.
He achieved fame during the 1930s and 1940s, with three victories in The Open Championship (1934, 1937, and 1948). His record round of 65, made during the 1934 Open Championship, led to the Dunlop golf company issuing the famous &#x27;Dunlop 65&#x27; ball. Cotton placed 17 times in the top-10 at the Open. Cotton also succeeded in winning many titles on the European circuit during the 1930s. During this period he was a professional at the Ashridge Golf Club.

Cotton was trained as a pilot since at least 1930. During World War II he served with the Royal Air Force, and raised money for the Red Cross by playing exhibition matches and shows. This earned him an MBE. At this time he was stationed at RAF Halton and was closely involved with what is now the Chiltern Forest Golf club. He added three holes to the course (taking it from six to nine) and made other improvements.

Cotton was a playing member of three British Ryder Cup teams, in 1929, 1937 and 1947, serving as captain of the team in 1947, and was a non-playing captain in 1953. He competed only occasionally in the United States, without notable success.

==Personal life and retirement==

On 11 December 1939 Cotton married Isabel-Maria Estanguet de Moss, the daughter of a Buenos Aires beef merchant, who was taking golf lessons from Cotton and was known by her nickname &#x27;Toots&#x27;. She supported Cotton during his golf competitions and affected the way he would dress for them.

Following his retirement from competitive golf in the early 1950s, Cotton became a successful architect of golf courses, including designing the Penina Golf and Resort and Pestana Alto Golf on the Algarve, Portugal. He was hired by Baron Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild to design the golf course in Megève, Haute-Savoie, France. Cotton wrote 10 books, and established the Golf Foundation, which helped thousands of young boys and girls get started in golf.

Cotton loved the high life, including champagne and bespoke tailored clothes. He lived for a while in a suite in a 5-star hotel, and later bought an estate complete with butler and full staff, traveling everywhere in a Rolls-Royce. Cotton stated in his book &quot;This Game Of Golf&quot; that his hero was Walter Hagen who was a flashy dresser and a high-roller. Cotton marveled at how Hagen would stay up all night playing cards for money on the eve of a tournament and how Hagen would go straight to the first tee without even warming up beforehand..

Cotton was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1980. He was knighted in the New Year&#x27;s Day Honours of 1988, named a Knight Bachelor. This was reported in some media as a &quot;posthumous knighthood&quot; because he had died by the time it was publicly announced. However, the Queen had approved the award and he had accepted it, before his death.

<doc id="318548" wikidata="Q4934897" url="?curid=318548" title="Bobby Cruickshank">
<text>Robert Allan Cruickshank (16 November 1894 – 27 August 1975) was a Scottish-born golfer who played primarily in the United States. He competed in the PGA of America circuit in the 1920s and 1930s, the forerunner of the PGA Tour. He was twice runner-up at the U.S Open.

==Early life==
Born in Grantown-on-Spey in rural northern Scotland, Cruickshank learned his golf as a boy playing over the town&#x27;s course. As a teenager he also worked there as a caddie.

In that era, country houses around Grantown-on-Spey were often rented to rich Edinburgh families for the summer. A wealthy widow named Mrs. Isabella Usher made an offer to Cruickshank&#x27;s parents to provide an education for their two sons in Edinburgh. In the autumn of 1909, Cruickshank and his younger brother John moved south. Mrs. Usher became their legal guardian and they lived at her house in the city&#x27;s Murrayfield district. They were educated at the nearby Daniel Stewart&#x27;s College.

He was also becoming an outstanding golfer and met and became friends with another rising local golfer, Tommy Armour. Armour and Cruikshank played together regularly over the Braid Hills course. Bobby also became a member of Turnhouse Golf Club on the west of the city.

Cruickshank served in the British Army in World War I. Captured in action by the Germans, he was a prisoner of war and later successfully escaped.

== Amateur career ==
On returning from the war, Cruickshank won what was then Edinburgh&#x27;s top amateur competition (the Edinburgh Coronation Cup) in both 1919 and 1920. The tournament was played at Braid Hills course which is still the city&#x27;s premier municipal course. Representing his old school&#x27;s former pupils (Stewart&#x27;s FP Golf Club) Cruickshank was part of a team which won the Evening Dispatch Trophy. He also reached the final rounds of the British Amateur Championship played at Muirfield in the summer of 1920.

==Professional career==
In 1921, Cruickshank turned professional and moved to the United States, as suggested by his mentor and friend, Tommy Armour. He rose to prominence in the U.S. after reaching the last four of the PGA Championship in both 1922 and 1923. He lost both times to eventual champion Gene Sarazen. Cruickshank was also twice runner-up in the U.S. Open. In 1923, he finished second to Bobby Jones down by two shots after an 18 hole playoff at Inwood Country Club, New York. In 1932, he was beaten by Gene Sarazen at Fresh Meadow Country Club, New York.

Cruickshank came home to Scotland to play at Muirfield in the 1929 Open Championship. Despite only bringing two clubs with him and borrowing the rest from the Gullane professional, he finished sixth. In a nod to his old school, Cruickshank wore his Stewart&#x27;s College tie while playing in the second round of the championship. He won £10 for sixth place while that years &quot;Champion Golfer&quot;, Walter Hagen, won £75.

Cruickshank won 17 tour events in his career and his greatest year was 1927, when he won the Los Angeles and Texas Opens and finished as the leading money winner for the year. His last victory on tour was in 1936 and he had 16 top-10 finishes in major championships.

Cruickshank was a club pro in Richmond, Virginia, in 1930s and 1940s, and later in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was also a winter pro in Florida.

== Personal life ==
Early in his adult life he was married to Helen.

Cruickshank died after a brief illness at age 80 in Delray Beach, Florida. His wife Nellie (1895–1965) died ten years earlier in Pittsburgh.

<doc id="318549" wikidata="Q946456" url="?curid=318549" title="Jimmy Demaret">
<text>James Newton Demaret (May 24, 1910 – December 28, 1983) was an American professional golfer. He won 31 PGA Tour events in a long career between 1935 and 1957, and was the first three-time winner of the Masters, with titles in 1940, 1947, and 1950.

==Life and career==
Born in Houston, Texas, Demaret reached his peak in the late 1940s with wins in the Masters in 1947, runner-up to Ben Hogan in the 1948 U.S. Open, and leading money winner and Vardon Trophy winner in 1947. He reached the semifinals of the PGA Championship four times, but never made the finals. He was one stroke short of making the playoff for the 1957 U.S. Open, at age 47. He played on three Ryder Cup teams: 1947, 1949, and 1951. His career declined in the 1950s, although he managed several key wins including the 1952 Bing Crosby Pro-Am. His last Tour win came in 1957 at age 47, although he also teamed at age 51 with Sam Snead to win the Canada Cup for the U.S. in Puerto Rico.

Demaret&#x27;s playing style was developed by necessity through the windy conditions of his native Texas. He favored a low fade (left-to-right flight) on his longer shots; the method gave good distance and excellent control. His skills were highly rated by his contemporaries; Ben Hogan, whose career overshadowed his, opined that he was the best player he had ever seen in windy conditions.

Demaret was known for his flamboyant personality, which he enhanced by wearing bright-colored clothing during tournaments; he had his clothes specially made, and became a fan favorite. As a result, he was known by his nickname, &quot;The Wardrobe.&quot; He had a very good baritone voice and talent as a comedian; he frequently entertained at nightclubs at Tour stops.

Demaret was elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1983. In 2000, he was ranked as the 20th greatest golfer of all time by &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine.

Demaret was one of the first Tour pros to become involved in golf broadcasting. After working as a commentator for &quot;All Star Golf&quot; in the early 1960s, he replaced George Rogers in 1966 as co-host for Shell&#x27;s Wonderful World of Golf with Gene Sarazen, the first winner of the career grand slam.

Business partner and double-major winner Jack Burke Jr. and Demaret started the high-standard 36-hole Champions Golf Club in Houston in the late 1950s. It hosted the 1967 Ryder Cup, the 1969 U.S. Open, the 1993 U.S. Amateur, and other high-profile events.

Demaret appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; titled &quot;The Golf Game&quot; which first aired on January 27, 1954. In 1964, he made a second appearance with Lucille Ball on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. In 1961, he appeared on &quot;The Jim Backus Show&quot;, playing himself.

He played himself in the 1951 Ben Hogan semi-autobiographical movie starring Glenn Ford and Anne Baxter called &quot;Follow the Sun.&quot;

The over-70s groupings on the Senior PGA Tour were named the &quot;Friends of Demaret&quot; in his honor.

==Death==
Demaret died of a heart attack at age 73 in Houston on December 28, 1983, as he was preparing for his daily ride around the Champions course. He was the third of the former Masters champions to pass away, preceded by Horton Smith in 1963 and Craig Wood in 1968.

<text>Canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden ( ; ; ; ), in English sometimes Appenzell Outer Rhodes, is one of the 26 cantons forming the Swiss Confederation. It is composed of twenty municipalities. The seat of the government and parliament is Herisau, and the seat of judicial authorities are in Trogen. It is traditionally considered a &quot;half-canton&quot;, the other half being Appenzell Innerrhoden.

Appenzell Ausserrhoden is located in the north east of Switzerland. Together with the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden, it forms an enclave within the canton of St. Gallen. The canton is essentially located in the Alpine foothills of the Alpstein massif, culminating at the Säntis.

Appenzell Ausserrhoden was part of the historical canton of Appenzell, which was divided into Appenzell Innerrhoden (Catholic) and Appenzell Ausserrhoden (Protestant) in 1597 as a result of the Swiss Reformation.

==History==
Settlement in Appenzell started in the 7th and the 8th century alongside the river Glatt. The monastery of St. Gallen was of great influence on the local population. In 907 Herisau is mentioned for the first time, the canton (Appenzell: &quot;abbatis cella&quot;) is named first in 1071.

===Foundation===
The name &quot;Appenzell&quot; () means &quot;cell (i.e. estate) of the abbot&quot;. This refers to the Abbey of St. Gall, which exerted a great influence on the area. By the middle of the 11th century the abbots of St Gall had established their power in the land later called Appenzell, which, too, became thoroughly teutonized, its early inhabitants having probably been romanized Raetians.

By about 1360, conflicts over grazing rights, taxes, and tithes were causing concern for both the abbot and the farmers of Appenzell. Both parties wanted to protect their rights and interests by joining the new Swabian League. In 1377 Appenzell was allowed to join the League with the support of the cities of Konstanz and St. Gallen (the city of St. Gallen was often at odds with the neighboring Abbey of St. Gall). With the support of League, Appenzell refused to pay many of the gifts and tithes that the Abbot Kuno von Stoffeln demanded. In response to the loss of revenue from his estates, Kuno approached the Austrian House of Habsburg for help. In 1392 he made an agreement with the Habsburgs, which was renewed in 1402. In response, in 1401 Appenzell entered into an alliance with the city of St. Gallen to protect their rights and freedom.

===Independence and joining the Swiss Confederation===
Following increasing conflicts between the Appenzellers the abbot&#x27;s agents, including the bailiff of Appenzell demanding that a dead body be dug up because he wanted the man&#x27;s clothes, the Appenzellers planned an uprising. On a certain day, throughout the abbot&#x27;s lands, they attacked the bailiffs and drove them out of the land. Following unsuccessful negotiations Appenzell and St. Gallen entered into a treaty. The treaty between St. Gallen and Appenzell marked a break between the abbot and his estates. Perhaps fearing the Habsburgs, in 1402 the League expelled Appenzell. During the same year, St. Gallen reached an agreement with the abbot and Appenzell could no longer count on St. Gallen&#x27;s support. Appenzell declared itself ready to stand against the abbot, and in 1403 formed an alliance with the canton of Schwyz, a member of the Old Swiss Confederation that had defeated the Austrians in the previous century. Glarus provided less support, but authorized any citizen who wished to support Appenzell to do so. In response, the League raised an army and marched to St. Gallen before heading toward Appenzell. On 15 May 1403, they entered the pass to Speicher and outside the village of Vögelinsegg met the Appenzell army. A small force of Appenzell and Confederation troops defeated the League army and signed a short lived peace treaty.

Following another Appenzell victory on 17 June 1405, at Stoss Pass on the border of Appenzell town, the new canton continued to expand. During the expansion, Appenzell had even captured the abbot of St Gall and in response they were excommunicated by the Bishop of Constance.

However, while the &quot;Bund&quot; expanded the Austrians used the peace to regain their strength. On 11 September 1406 an association of nobles formed a knightly order known as the &quot;Sankt Jörgenschild&quot; (Order of St. George&#x27;s Shield) to oppose the rebellious commoners of the &quot;Bund&quot;. Following a defeat at Bregenz, Appenzell was unable to hold the &quot;Bund&quot; together. The city of St. Gallen and the canton of Schwyz each paid off the Austrians to avoid an attack, and the &quot;Bund&quot; was dissolved by King Rupert on 4 April 1408.

As part of the peace treaty, the abbot gave up his ownership of Appenzell, but was still owed certain taxes. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 1410 that the area was at peace.

In 1411 Appenzell signed a defensive treaty with the entire Swiss Confederation (except Bern), which strengthened their position against the abbot. Appenzell joined the Confederation as an &quot;Associate Member&quot;, and did not become a full member until 1513. Following another battle, in 1429, Appenzell was granted freedom from the obligations in the future. This treaty represented the end of Appenzell&#x27;s last financial tie to the Abbey of St. Gall, and a movement to closer relationships with the Confederation.

===Division of Appenzell===
Starting in 1522, followers of Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli began to preach the Protestant Reformation in Appenzell. The early reformers had the most success in the outer &quot;Rhoden&quot;, a term that in the singular is said to mean a &quot;clearing,&quot; and occurs in 1070, long before the final separation. Following the initial small success, in 1523 Joachim von Watt (also known as Joachim Vadian) began to preach the reformed version of the Acts of the Apostles to friends and fellow clergy. His preaching brought the Reformation into the forefront of public debate. In October 1523, the Council supported the Protestant principle of scriptural sermons and on 24 April 1524 Landsgemeinde confirmed the Cantonal Council&#x27;s decision. However, the work of the Anabaptists in the Appenzell region (as well as in Zürich and St. Gallen) in 1525 led to government crackdowns. The first police action against the Anabaptists took place in June 1525, followed by the Anabaptist Disputation in Teufen in October 1529.

To end the confrontation between the old and new faiths, the Landesgemeinde decided in April 1525, that each parish should choose a faith, but that the principle of free movement would be supported, so that the religious minority could attend the church of their choice regardless of where they lived. The entire Ausserrhoden (except Herisau, where Joseph Forrester convinced them to remain Catholic until the late 16th century) converted to the Reformation in 1529. The Innerrhoden (except for Gais which joined Ausserrhoden in 1597) remained with the old faith. While the majority of the residents of Appenzell town remained Catholic under their priest, Diepolt Huter, there was a strong Reformed minority. In 1531, the minority were nearly successful in getting the town to ally with the Protestant Ausserrhoden. But an armed mob of angry residents from the neighboring village of Gonten prevented the abolition of the Mass in Appenzell. The Catholic victory in the Second War of Kappel in 1531 ended plans for a reformation of the entire canton of Appenzell.

Two small monasteries (Wonnenstein in Teufen and Grimmenstein in Walzenhausen) in Ausserrhoden remained catholic though the towns around them adopted the new faith. In 1870 the monastery grounds were declared exclaves of the canton Appenzell Innerrhoden by the federal government.

After the Second War of Kappel, the two religions reached a generally peaceful parity. They remained united by common business interests, the same political and legal understanding, a shared desire to form an alliance with France and a shared opposition to the city of St. Gallen. This shared opposition to St. Gallen was demonstrated in the so-called linen affairs (1535–42, 1579), where the weavers throughout Appenzell supported each other when they felt that they were unfairly treated by the linen industry of St. Gallen.

After this time, the term &quot;Kanton Appenzell&quot; continued to refer to both half-cantons, although this usage has since become outdated. Usually &quot;die beiden Appenzell&quot; (&quot;the two Appenzells&quot;) are spoken of in a political context, and &quot;Appenzellerland&quot; in a geographic context, if the aim is to refer to Innerrhoden and Ausserrhoden collectively.

From 1798 to 1803 Appenzell, with the other domains of the abbot of St Gall, was formed into the canton of Säntis of the Helvetic Republic, but in 1803, on the creation of the new canton of St Gall, shrank back within its former boundaries.

===Early Modern Appenzell===

From the 16th century onwards linen production was established little by little. Larger textile businesses established themselves, later diversifying into weaving and embroidery. The textile industry collapsed between 1920 and 1939. In 1834 for the first time a constitution was adapted, undergoing reforms in 1876 and 1908. The construction of numerous railway lines between 1875 and 1913 helped the local industry and the population grew to a maximum of 57,973 people in 1910 (compared with 53,200 in 2001). In 1934 Johannes Baumann was the first citizen from Appenzell Ausserrhoden to become a federal councilor. Women&#x27;s right to vote was introduced in 1972 on a local level, but only in 1989 on a canton-wide level. In 1994 for the first time two women were elected into government. The open assembly (&quot;Landsgemeinde&quot;) was abolished in 1997. The Landsgemeinde still convenes in Appenzell Inerrhoden. The right of foreigners to vote is determined by each municipality.

<text>Roberto De Vicenzo (14 April 1923 – 1 June 2017) was a professional golfer from Argentina. He won a record 229 professional tournaments worldwide during his career, including seven on the PGA Tour and most famously the 1967 Open Championship. He is perhaps best remembered for signing an incorrect scorecard that kept him out of a playoff for the 1968 Masters Tournament.

==Early life==
De Vicenzo was born on 14 April 1923 in Villa Ballester, a northern suburb of Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was raised in the Villa Pueyrredón neighborhood of Buenos Aires, and acquired the game of golf as a caddie. He developed his skills at the Ranelagh Golf Club, and later relocated to the town of the same name.

==Professional career==
De Vicenzo won his first Argentine tournament, the Abierto del Litoral, in 1942; his first World Cup in 1953; and a major tournament, The Open Championship, in 1967. De Vicenzo is best remembered for his misfortune in the 1968 Masters Tournament. On the par-4 17th hole, Roberto De Vicenzo made a birdie, but playing partner Tommy Aaron inadvertently entered a 4 instead of 3 on the scorecard. He did not check the scorecard for the error before signing it, and according to the Rules of Golf the higher score had to stand and be counted. If not for this mistake, De Vicenzo would have tied for first place with Bob Goalby, and the two would have met in an 18-hole playoff the next day. His quote afterwards became legendary for its poignancy: &quot;What a stupid I am!&quot;

De Vicenzo subsequently found great success in the early days of the Senior PGA Tour, winning the Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf two times and the inaugural U.S. Senior Open in 1980. He also won the 1974 PGA Seniors&#x27; Championship, and represented Argentina 15 times in the Canada Cup/World Cup, leading Argentina to victory in 1953.

He officially retired on 12 November 2006, at age 83 with over 200 international victories. 

== Personal life ==
De Vicenzo died 1 June 2017 at the age of 94.

== Awards and honors ==

* In 1970, he was voted the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association (USGA) in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf
* In 1989, De Vicenzo was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame
* The Museum of Golf in Argentina in Berazategui, Argentina was founded because of his hard work. It was named in his honor upon its completion in 2006.

<text>Tenés Empanadas Graciela (TEG) is a turn-based strategy game available in several popular Linux distributions. The idea for this free and open-source software program came from the board game &quot;TEG&quot;, which itself is based on the strategy board game &quot;Risk&quot;.

==Gameplay==
Using a server, several players can fight for world domination and chat with each other. Maps are used as battlefields. The game is available in languages including Spanish, German, French and Polish.

== History ==
In 1996, Argentine software developer Ricardo &quot;riq&quot; Quesada started developing the game and released it under the GNU GPL-2-0-only. He stopped working on it for a few years but brought the project back to life in early 2000. Other developers, graphic artists, and translators subsequently joined the project.

TEG was an early supporter of the FOSS multiplayer client-server system GGZ Gaming Zone.

In around 2014, the project moved from SourceForge to GitHub.

==Reception==
&quot;Tenés Empanadas Graciela&quot; was reviewed as a notable Risk clone by free and open-source software associated media outlets, such as &quot;Linux Journal&quot; and &quot;Linux Magazine&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Linux.com&quot; reviewed &quot;Tenés Empanadas Graciela&quot; again as a notable Risk clone. &quot;Linux Game Tome&quot; lists the game with 4.2 of 5 stars.

The game was reviewed in 2012 by &quot;republica.com&quot;.

=== Versions and ports ===
The game is available Ubuntu, Debian, Gentoo Linux, and Arch Linux, and was ported to other operating systems such as macOS.

An Argentine online version of the game is called WebTeg which allows users to play with just a web browser.

<text>Leo Harvey Diegel (April 20, 1899 – May 5, 1951) was an American professional golfer of the 1920s and early 1930s. He captured consecutive PGA Championships, played on the first four Ryder Cup teams, and is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Born in Gratiot Township, Wayne County, Michigan, Diegel began caddying at age ten and won his first significant event at age 17, the 1916 Michigan Open.

==Professional career==
Diegel was a runner-up in his first U.S. Open in 1920, one stroke behind champion Ted Ray. He won 28 PGA circuit events, and was a four-time winner of the Canadian Open (1924–25, 1928–29); a record for that event. In 1925, Diegel outperformed over 100 competitors to win the Florida Open (billed as the &quot;Greatest Field Of Golfers Ever to Play in Florida&quot;) at the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club.

Diegel was selected for the first four Ryder Cup teams in 1927, 1929, 1931, and 1933. His greatest season was 1928, with wins at the Canadian Open and the match play PGA Championship, where he stopped the four-year winning streak of Walter Hagen. Diegel defeated him in the quarterfinal to avenge earlier defeats in the 1925 quarterfinal and the 1926 final. Diegel achieved the rare feat of defending both titles successfully in 1929, this time defeating Hagen in the semifinals of the PGA. Diegel was a runner-up to Bobby Jones at the British Open in 1930.

Diegel was an excellent ball-striker, but struggled with his putting after joining the tour. After extensive experimentation, he eventually developed an unusual putting style where he pointed both elbows outwards; this was referred to as &#x27;Diegeling&#x27;. He was a tour winner from 1920 to 1934, but dropped out of regular contention when he reached his mid-30s; a playful wrestling incident in Australia in late 1934 with friend Harry Cooper caused nerve damage to his right shoulder and effectively ended his tour career.

==Death==
Diagnosed with throat and lung cancer in 1947, Diegel died at home in North Hollywood, California in 1951 at age 52; he had taken a position there as a club professional after scaling back his Tour play. He was buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Detroit, Michigan.

== Awards and honors ==
Diegel was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2003.

<text>Edward Bishop Dudley (February 19, 1901 – October 25, 1963) was an American professional golfer active in the late 1920s and 1930s. He was given the nickname of &quot;Big Ed&quot; in acknowledgment of his frame.

==Biography==
Born in Brunswick, Georgia, Dudley was a 15-time winner on the PGA Tour. His achievements were mainly recognized retrospectively, since the PGA Tour of today did not formally exist as such; this situation was the same for all of his cohorts as well. The Tour as it was begun and evolved in the early 1920s, making Dudley one of its early pioneers. His first noteworthy professional results were made in the 1925 season, when he won the Oklahoma Open among other strong showings.

After winning both the Los Angeles and Western Opens in 1931, Dudley had his best year in 1933, when he was a quarter-finalist in the PGA Championship and won selection to the Ryder Cup team (having also played on the 1929 team). He won two key matches in the 1937 Ryder Cup, to help the United States win for the first time in Great Britain. In a total of four Ryder Cup matches played, Dudley compiled a record of three wins and one loss, across three Cup series. All Ryder Cup matches were played at 36 holes in that era. All three U.S. teams he played for (1929: Moor Park Golf Club, 1933: Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club, and 1937: again, Southport and Ainsdale) had to travel to Great Britain. Dudley also served as Ryder Cup honorary team captain in 1949, when the matches were played at the Ganton Golf Club in England; the USA also won that match.

Dudley finished 24 times in the top-10 at major championships, and this is a record among players who did not win at least one major. His high finishes in majors include third place at the PGA Championship in 1932, and at the Masters Tournament in 1937. In 1937, he became the first player to finish in the top-10 in all four majors in one year, a feat not repeated until Arnold Palmer in 1960.

Dudley served as the first head golf professional at the newly established Augusta National Golf Club, from 1932 to 1957. He served as president of the PGA of America from 1942 to 1948. He is a member of the PGA Hall of Fame. He was posthumously inducted into the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame in 1990. He was also the club professional at the Broadmoor Golf Club in Colorado Springs, Colorado for over two decades; this shared arrangement with Augusta National was possible because of the mainly mid-autumn through early spring season at Augusta National.

Among Dudley&#x27;s most famous students were President Dwight Eisenhower, singer Bing Crosby, and comedian Bob Hope. Dudley died of a heart attack in Colorado Springs, one week after undergoing surgery to remove blood clots from his leg.
