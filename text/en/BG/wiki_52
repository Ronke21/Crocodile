<text>Martin Hayter Short (born March 26, 1950) is a Canadian-American comedian, actor, and writer. Short is known as an energetic comedian who gained prominence for his roles in sketch comedy. He has also acted in numerous films and television shows. He has received various awards including two Primetime Emmy Awards, two SAG Awards, and a Tony Award. Short was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2019.

He is known for his work on the television programs &quot;SCTV&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Short created the characters Jiminy Glick and Ed Grimley.

He has also had an active career on stage, starring in Broadway productions including Neil Simon&#x27;s musicals &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (1993) and &quot;Little Me&quot; (1998–1999).

In 2015, Short started touring nationally with fellow comedian Steve Martin. In 2018, they released their Netflix special &quot;An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life&quot; which received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations. Since 2021, he has co-starred in the Hulu comedy series &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot; alongside Martin and Selena Gomez. For his performance he has earned nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award, the Golden Globe Award, and a Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award, and won a SAG Award.

== Early life and education ==
Short was born on March 26, 1950, in Hamilton, Ontario, the youngest&lt;ref name=&quot;Conan/Jabber/Short&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; of five children of Olive Grace (née Hayter; 1913–1968), a Canadian-born (of English and Irish descent) concertmistress at the Hamilton Symphony Orchestra, and Charles Patrick Short (1909–1970), a corporate executive at the Canadian steel company Stelco who had emigrated from Crossmaglen, south County Armagh, Ireland as a stowaway during the Irish War of Independence. Short has spoken openly about his father&#x27;s struggles with alcoholism.

Short and his siblings—three older brothers, David, Michael, and Brian, and one older sister, Nora—were raised as Catholics. His eldest brother, David, was killed in a car accident in Montréal in 1962 when Short was 12. 
Encouraged by his mother in his early creative endeavours, Short attended Westdale Secondary School and then graduated from McMaster University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Work in 1971. In the meantime, his mother died of cancer in 1968; his father died two years later, of complications from a stroke.

His brother, Michael, would go on to become a comedy writer, also spending time at Second City Television (SCTV), and is 17 time nominee and three time winner of an Emmy Award for comedy sketch writing.

==Career==
=== 1972–1976: Early theatrical and Canadian television work ===
As Short was about to graduate from McMaster University, rather than immediately pursuing a career in social work, he moved to Toronto with intention of temporarily giving acting a shot. Right away, in March 1972, he landed his first piece of paid work as an actor: playing a plastic credit card inside a woman&#x27;s purse in a Chargex television commercial. He was then cast by Stephen Schwartz for the new 1972 production of the Broadway hit &quot;Godspell&quot; being prepared at Toronto&#x27;s Royal Alexandra Theatre. Among other members of that production&#x27;s cast were Victor Garber, Gilda Radner, Eugene Levy, Dave Thomas, Andrea Martin, Jayne Eastwood, and Gerry Salsberg; Paul Shaffer was the musical director. As stated by Short in his 2014 memoir as well as in the 2018 documentary &quot;Love, Gilda&quot;, he and Gilda Radner dated each other on and off during that time.

Short subsequently found work in several Canadian television shows and theatrical productions. These included being cast for the role of a tough, sexually predatory prison inmate in the 1972 staging of John Herbert&#x27;s drama &quot;Fortune and Men&#x27;s Eyes&quot; that had the upstart twenty-two-year-old actor commuting back to his hometown Hamilton, Ontario. With the success of &quot;Godspell&quot; at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in downtown Toronto, by late 1972, the production moved uptown to the Bayview Playhouse where it ran for 488 performances. Young Short&#x27;s increased stage profile led to a guest spot on &quot;Right On&quot;, a teen-focused live program airing weekly in the after-school timeslot on the government-funded CBC TV. He also played the role of Smokey the Hare on the TVOntario daytime kids&#x27; program &quot;Cucumber&quot;.

In June 1973, with &quot;Godspell&quot; winding down and Chicago&#x27;s Second City improv comedy theatre starting up a sister company in Toronto, many of Short&#x27;s &quot;Godspell&quot; peers (his girlfriend Radner, in addition to Levy, Eastwood, and Salsberg) as well as the rest of his social circle (Valri Bromfield and Dan Aykroyd) successfully joined the new troupe&#x27;s first cast. Short, on the other hand, resisted auditioning due to feeling a &quot;phobia of being funny on demand&quot; and considering himself a &quot;traditional song-and-dance performer&quot;.

In 1974, Short was hired as a writer on &quot;Everything Goes&quot;, a nightly variety show hosted by Norm Crosby, Mike Darow, and Catherine McKinnon. Produced by and aired on Global Television Network, broadcasting only to Southern Ontario as a newly launched regional grouping of television stations, the show lasted less than six months before being cancelled.

=== 1977–1985: &quot;SCTV&quot; and &quot;SNL&quot; stardom ===

Short was encouraged to pursue comedy by McMaster classmates Eugene Levy and Dave Thomas, in March 1977, joining the improvisation group The Second City, taking over for John Candy in &quot;The Wizard of Ossington&quot;, their ninth revue. 

In early 1978, Short secured his feature film debut via a supporting role in the Melvin Frank-directed British romantic comedy &quot;Lost and Found&quot; starring George Segal and Glenda Jackson. Filmed throughout late winter and early spring 1978 in Banff National Park and Toronto, the film saw limited North American release in June 1979 and was met with lukewarm reviews and poor box office returns.

In 1979, after working solely in Canada for the preceding seven years, Short landed a starring role in the American sitcom &quot;The Associates&quot; about a group of young novice lawyers working at a Wall Street law firm. 

In 1980, he joined the cast of &quot;I&#x27;m a Big Girl Now&quot;, a sitcom starring Diana Canova and Danny Thomas. Canova was offered the sitcom because of her success playing Corinne Tate Flotsky on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Soap&quot; and left &quot;Soap&quot; shortly before Short&#x27;s newlywed wife Nancy Dolman joined it.

 &quot;SCTV&quot; 

Short achieved wider public notice when the Second City group produced a show for television, &quot;Second City Television&quot; (&quot;SCTV&quot;), which ran for several years in Canada, then the United States. Short appeared on &quot;SCTV&quot; in 1982–83. At &quot;SCTV&quot;, Short developed several characters before moving on to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for the 1984–85 season:

* Aged songwriter Irving Cohen, commonly thought to be loosely based on American composers Irving Caesar and/or Irving Berlin and perhaps Canadian songwriter Leonard Cohen, but actually (according to Short in his autobiography) inspired by Sophie Tucker
* Defense attorney Nathan Thurm&lt;ref name=&quot;SC/p/ms&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Albino Vegas singer, Jackie Rogers Jr. and his father, Jackie Rogers Sr., the latter of which was mauled to death by a mountain lion during a comeback special that took place in the woods.
* Oddball man-child Ed Grimley, later featured on &quot;SNL&quot; and in his own short-lived animated television series entitled &quot;The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley&quot;. The show, which was produced by Hanna-Barbera and aired for a single season in fall 1988, is the only animated series adapted from an &quot;SCTV&quot; character and a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; character to date.

 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; 

Short joined &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) for the 1984–85 season. He helped revive the show with his many characters for season ten (the last one produced by Dick Ebersol). &quot;Short&#x27;s appearance on &quot;SNL&quot; helped to revive the show&#x27;s fanbase, which had flagged after the departure of Eddie Murphy, and in turn, would launch his successful career in films and television.&quot; His &quot;SNL&quot; characters included numerous holdovers from his &quot;SCTV&quot; days, most notably, his Ed Grimley character, depicted on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a geeky everyman who is obsessed with &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, plays the triangle, and often finds himself in bizarre situations rather than a miscast bad actor in several film and TV show parodies (&quot;The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley&quot; used the &quot;SNL&quot; characterization of him rather than the &quot;SCTV&quot; take on him). He also did impressions of such celebrities as Jerry Lewis and Katharine Hepburn.

Since then he has made multiple appearances on the show including on the SNL Christmas special in 2012, 2024 and &quot;Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special&quot; in 2015.

=== 1986–1999: Film roles and Broadway debut ===
In addition to his work on &quot;SCTV&quot; and &quot;SNL&quot;, Short has starred in several television specials and series of his own. In 1985, Short starred in the one-hour Showtime special &quot;Martin Short: Concert for the North Americas&quot;. This was Short&#x27;s first live concert, interspersed with studio sketches and a wraparound featuring Jackie Rogers Jr. Co-produced by the CBC, this aired as &quot;The Martin Short Comedy Special&quot; in Canada in March 1986. In 1989, Short headlined another one-hour comedy special, this time for HBO, &quot;I, Martin Short, Goes Hollywood&quot;, Short&#x27;s classic send-up of all things Hollywood. It featured many of his characters including Ed Grimley and Jackie Rogers Jr.

After doing sketch comedy for several years, Short starred in &quot;Three Amigos&quot; (1986), &quot;Innerspace&quot; (1987), &quot;The Big Picture&quot; (1989), &quot;Captain Ron&quot; (1992) and &quot;Clifford&quot; (1994). He starred in &quot;Three Fugitives&quot; (1989), directed by Francis Veber, with Nick Nolte and James Earl Jones; he was the memorable scene-stealing character &quot;Franck&quot; in the 1991 remake of &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; and its sequel; and in &quot;Pure Luck&quot; (1991), directed by Nadia Tass, with Danny Glover and Sheila Kelley.

Short resumed work in the theatre, playing a lead role in the 1993 musical version of the Neil Simon film &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot;, on Broadway, receiving a Tony Award nomination and an Outer Critics Circle Award. He had the lead role in the 1999 Broadway revival of the musical &quot;Little Me&quot;, for which he received a Tony Award and another Outer Critics Circle Award.

In 1996, he appeared in Tim Burton&#x27;s sci-fi comedy &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; as lascivious Press Secretary Jerry Ross. In 1997, he starred in &quot;A Simple Wish&quot; as male fairy godmother Murray. In 1997, he appeared as Wall Street broker Richard Kempster in &quot;Jungle 2 Jungle&quot;, with Tim Allen. In 1999, he appeared as Lionel Dillard in Lawrence Kasdan&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Mumford&quot;. Short has had three television shows called &quot;The Martin Short Show&quot;, including a sitcom, &quot;The Martin Short Show&quot;, 1994; a sketch comedy show, &quot;The Show Formerly Known as the Martin Short Show&quot;, 1995; and a syndicated talk show &quot;The Martin Short Show&quot;, which ran from 1999 to 2000.

=== 2000–2007: &quot;Primetime Glick&quot; ===
 Short starred as Jiminy Glick on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Primetime Glick&quot; (2001–2003). He interviewed performers and celebrities as the character Jiminy Glick. &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2002 referred to the character as &quot;the most unpredictable and hilariously uninhibited comic creation to hit TV since Bart Simpson was in diapers.&quot; In 2004, he wrote and starred in &quot;Jiminy Glick in Lalawood&quot; with Jan Hooks as his wife, Dixie Glick. In 2003, Short took to the stage once again in the critically acclaimed Los Angeles run of &quot;The Producers&quot;. Short played the role of the accountant, Leo Bloom, opposite Jason Alexander&#x27;s Max Bialystock. Although the role of Leo Bloom was originated on Broadway by Matthew Broderick, Mel Brooks first approached Short about doing the part opposite Nathan Lane. On the subject, Short has stated in numerous interviews that, while he was thrilled by the opportunity, the idea of having to move his family from their Los Angeles home to New York for a year was less than ideal and ultimately proved a deal-breaker.

In 2006, he starred in another film with Tim Allen, &quot;The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause&quot;. In addition to his own series, Short has guest starred on several shows including &quot;Arrested Development&quot; (episode titled &quot;Ready, Aim, Marry Me&quot;, 2005), &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; (1996), &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and &quot;Weeds&quot;. He joined the FX drama &quot;Damages&quot; as lawyer Leonard Winstone in 2010. Short also provided the voices of several animated film characters, such as Stubbs in &quot;We&#x27;re Back! A Dinosaur&#x27;s Story&quot; (1993), Hubie in &quot;The Pebble and the Penguin&quot; (1995), Huy in &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (1998), Ooblar in &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; (2001), B.E.N. in &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (2002), Preminger in &quot;Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper&quot; (2004), Thimbletack the Brownie in &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot; (2008), Mr. Frankenstein/Mr. Bergermesiter/Nassor in &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; (2012), Stefano the sea lion in &quot;Madagascar 3: Europe&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (2012), Kurokawa in the English dub of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;The Wind Rises&quot; (2013), and The Jester in &quot;Legends of Oz: Dorothy&#x27;s Return&quot; (2013).

Short was the host of the defunct Walt Disney World attractions &quot;O Canada!&quot;, a Circle-Vision 360° film in the Epcot theme park&#x27;s Canada pavilion, and &quot;The Making of Me&quot; at Epcot&#x27;s Wonders of Life pavilion, a 15-minute film about how pregnancy occurs. Short performed in his satirical one-man show, with a cast of six, &quot;Martin Short: Fame Becomes Me&quot;, at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre on Broadway. The show toured several cities in the spring of 2006, prior to opening on Broadway in August 2006; the show closed in January 2007. In it, he performed his classic characters Grimley, Cohen, and Glick. As Glick, Short brought a member of the audience (usually a celebrity) on stage and interviewed him or her. Jerry Seinfeld was the guest on opening night. The show also featured parodies of many celebrities including Celine Dion, Katharine Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Tommy Tune, Joan Rivers, Britney Spears, Ellen DeGeneres, Renée Zellweger, Jodie Foster, Rachael Ray, and Short&#x27;s wife, actress Nancy Dolman. The cast album was released on April 10, 2007, and is available from Ghostlight Records, an imprint of Sh-K-Boom Records.

=== 2010–2019: Stand-up tour with Steve Martin ===

Short voiced the Cat in the Hat in the animated TV series &quot;The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!&quot;, which aired from 2010 to 2013. He later voiced the character in a number of related TV specials in 2014 and 2016. He shot a new comedy special for television in Toronto in September 2011. The special, &quot;I, Martin Short, Goes Home&quot; follows his return to his native Hamilton, Ontario and has a cast that includes Eugene Levy, Andrea Martin, Joe Flaherty, and Fred Willard. The special aired on CBC Television on April 3, 2012, and garnered Short a nomination for Best Lead Actor in a Comedy Program or Series at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards. In 2011, Short joined the cast of &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; for its seventh season, playing Marshall&#x27;s manic boss and was a judge on the first season of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (2012).

He, along with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase appeared on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as part of the &quot;Five-Timers Club&quot;, on March 9, 2013, which included those actors who had hosted the show five or more times. However, Short appeared as a waiter, as he had only hosted three times.

Short has continued to tour in his one-man show, which features many of his best-loved characters and sketches. In addition to &quot;Fame Becomes Me&quot;, some titles that Short has used for his one-man show include &quot;Stroke Me Lady Fame&quot;, &quot;If I&#x27;d Saved, I Wouldn&#x27;t Be Here&quot;, and &quot;Sunday in the Park with George Michael&quot;. Short&#x27;s memoir, covering his 40-year career in show business, &quot;I Must Say: My Life as a Humble Comedy Legend&quot;, was released on November 4, 2014. 

From 2014 to 2015, he starred in the Fox sitcom &quot;Mulaney&quot;, as Lou Cannon, a game show host and boss of the title character John Mulaney. In 2015, he returned to Broadway replacing Nathan Lane in the Terrence McNally comedic play &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Play&quot;. On May 31, 2016, Short debuted a new variety show on NBC, &quot;Maya &amp; Marty&quot;, which also starred Maya Rudolph. 

Since 2015, Short has toured with fellow comedian Steve Martin. Together their tours have included &quot;A Very Stupid Conversation&quot; in 2015, &quot;An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life&quot; in 2017, and &quot;The Funniest Show in Town at the Moment&quot; in 2021. Their 2017 tour was filmed for Netflix as a special and was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards and a Directors Guild of America Award nomination.

=== 2019–present ===
In 2019, Short appeared on the Netflix talk show &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot; alongside Jerry Seinfeld in the episode &quot;Martin Short: A Dream World Of Residuals&quot;. From 2019 to 2021 he took on a sinister role portraying Dick Lundy, a disgraced filmmaker, in the Apple TV+ series &quot;The Morning Show&quot;. Damon Wise of &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; wrote, &quot;Short is a damn fine dramatic actor&quot; citing his &quot;brief but indelible guest role&quot;. Short said of the role, &quot;Well, it came to me by the producers reaching out and asking me to do it. I don’t know why they wanted me, necessarily, but I was immediately interested. I’m very fascinated by conversation and discussion&quot; around the MeToo movement. The performance earned Short a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. He also appeared as a Leprechaun in another Apple TV+ series &quot;Schmigadoon!&quot; from 2021 to 2023. Short voiced the roles of Grandpa Frump in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (2019) and Father Willoughby in the Netflix animated film &quot;The Willoughbys&quot; (2020) as the impolite father. He also reprised the role of Franck Eggelhoffer in the Nancy Meyers directed short film &quot;Father of the Bride Part 3(ish)&quot; (2020).

Starting in 2021 he has starred and served as an executive producer in the Hulu crime comedy series &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot; alongside Steve Martin and Selena Gomez. The show was nominated for a 2021 Peabody Award, and in July 2022, he received his 13th Emmy nomination for his role in it. He received nominations for the Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Mike Hale of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Short &quot;gives a master class&quot; in the series adding, &quot;It&#x27;s not a class in acting or comedy so much as it is a seminar in agelessness and professionalism, and in Short&#x27;s unmatched ability to turn self-absorption into a virtue.&quot; In 2023, he voiced the role of Kingfish in &quot;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&quot;. In 2024, he reprised his role as Jiminy Glick on &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; and guest hosted &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot;.

<doc id="315150" wikidata="Q1140446" url="?curid=315150" title="Cristofano Malvezzi">
<text>Cristofano Malvezzi (baptised June 28, 1547 – January 22, 1599) was an Italian organist and composer of the late Renaissance. He was one of the most famous composers in the city of Florence during a time of transition to the Baroque style.

Malevezzi was born in Lucca. From 1551 he lived in Florence, serving the Medicis from 1562. He held a number of organist posts in the city, and also taught pupils, among them Jacopo Peri, who is often regarded as the inventor of opera. From 1573 he held the double post of &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the cathedral as well as at S Giovanni Battista, which was the highest position for a musician in the city. Among his works are three books of madrigals, a book of ricercars, but only two sacred compositions—a curious omission for a composer so closely connected with the church.

Because of his activity in Florence, the numerous intermedi that he wrote for the Medici and other members of the aristocracy, his dedication of a book of ricercars to Count Giovanni de&#x27; Bardi, and the dedication of a book of madrigals to Emilio de&#x27; Cavalieri, it is likely that he was a member of the Florentine Camerata, the group of progressive musicians and poets who, in attempting to recreate the music of ancient Greece, created the first monody and ultimately the first opera. This is reinforced by the fact that he composed much of the music for the La Pellegrina intermedi of 1589, which was carefully designed by the Camerata. Whether or not he was part of the intimate group, his music was among the best known in Florence. One of the grandest compositions of the time, a colossal setting of &quot;O fortunato giorno&quot; which he composed for a sumptuous intermedio intended for an aristocratic marriage, is for thirty separate vocal parts divided into seven spatially separated choirs. Some of his madrigals are written in the monodic style, which implies further a possible connection with the Camerata.

Malvezzi&#x27;s brother Alberigo (around 1550–1615) was also an 
organist and composer.

<doc id="315151" wikidata="Q389691" url="?curid=315151" title="Spotted sandpiper">
<text>The spotted sandpiper (Actitis macularius) is a small shorebird. Together with its sister species the common sandpiper (&quot;A. hypoleucos&quot;), it makes up the genus &quot;Actitis&quot;. They replace each other geographically; stray birds may settle down with breeders of the other species and hybridize.

==Taxonomy==
The spotted sandpiper was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Tringa macularia&quot;. The type locality is Pennsylvania. The species is now placed together with common sandpiper in the genus &quot;Actitis&quot; and was introduced in 1811 by the German zoologist Johann Illiger. The genus name &quot;Actitis&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;aktites&quot; meaning &quot;coast-dweller&quot; from &quot;akte&quot; meaning &quot;coast&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;macularius&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;spotted&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
Adults have short yellowish legs and an orange bill with a dark tip. The body is brown on top and white underneath with black spots. These spots vary in degree over the course of spotted sandpipers&#x27; lives, becoming especially prevalent around the breeding season. The overall health of spotted sandpipers may be suggested by the &quot;spottiness&quot; of an individual. Generally, females with more &quot;spottiness&quot; were healthier than those who did not have as many spots. The condition of males based on the amount of spots they exhibit is yet to be determined. Additionally, spot size gets smaller and the spot shape becomes more irregularly shaped as age increases. Spotted sandpipers also feature a white supercilium.

Non-breeding birds, depicted below, do not have the spotted underparts, and are very similar to the common sandpiper of Eurasia; the main difference is the more washed-out wing pattern visible in flight and the normally light yellow legs and feet of the spotted sandpiper. The &quot;Actitis&quot; species have a distinctive stiff-winged flight low over the water. They also have a distinctive walk in which their tails bob up and down. Males and females exhibit similar physical measurements, but differ in weight; females tend to be about 20-25% heavier than males.

Measurements:

* Length: 7.1-7.9 in (18–20 cm)
* Weight: 1.2-1.8 oz (34-50 g)
* Wingspan: 14.6-15.8 in (37–40 cm)

==Distribution==
Spotted sandpipers are a philopatric species. Their breeding habitat is near fresh water across most of Canada and the United States. They migrate to the southern United States, the Caribbean, and South America, and are very rare vagrants to western Europe. These are not gregarious birds and are seldom seen in flocks. Spotted sandpipers are the most widespread species of their kind in North America due to their high breeding rates and their ability to adapt to various environmental pressures.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
Breeding grounds are chosen based on various environmental factors but tend to be in the proximity of bodies of water that offer some coverage from vegetation. Successful breeding sites may be used repeatedly until either the site becomes physically unsuitable (from overgrown vegetation or flooding) or predation becomes too severe. The females usually arrive at breeding grounds before the males do and establish their territories. Males arrive at breeding sites later but it is uncertain whether they will arrive at the same breeding sites that some females have chosen. The search for mates amongst female spotted sandpipers is much more competitive than finding potential mates for males.

During each summer breeding season, females may mate with and lay clutches for more than one male, leaving incubation to them. This is called polyandry. Male spotted sandpipers take care of the offspring, both before and after the offspring hatch. They will incubate their eggs for about 20–23 days. Male parents of first clutches may father chicks in later male&#x27;s clutches, probably due to sperm storage within female reproductive tracts, which is common in birds. Females that fail to find additional mates usually help incubate and rear chicks. &quot;Prior to incubation, blood plasma concentrations of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are substantially higher in males than in females&quot; and these levels plummet 25-fold in males as incubation proceeds. Additionally, mated females have testosterone concentrations that are 7 times higher than those of unmated females. Due to their polyandrous behavior, spotted sandpipers tend to produce more offspring compared to other species of sandpipers.

===Food and feeding===
These birds forage on the ground or in water, picking up food by sight. They may also catch insects in flight. They eat insects (such as flies, beetles, grasshoppers, mayflies, midges, crickets and caterpillars), crustaceans and other invertebrates (such as spiders, snails, other molluscs, and worms), as well as small fish and carrion. As they forage, they can be recognized by their constant nodding and teetering.

== Predators ==
The main predators of spotted sandpipers include raptors, mustelids, mice, and gulls. Most of these predators target the sandpipers&#x27; chicks and eggs.

== Conservation status==
Although there has been some decline in the population of spotted sandpipers, their conservation status is currently of least concern. However, the decrease in the population of spotted sandpipers is not projected to slow or stop in the future. The destruction of their natural habitats due to increasing wildfires causes problems for breeding and raising offspring. Additionally, the gradual increase in temperatures poses a problem for newborn sandpipers.

== Etymology ==
The word Actitis comes from the Greek word for &quot;coast-dweller&quot;, while the word macularius comes from the Latin word for &quot;spotted&quot;.

<text>Fairfax Avenue is a street in the north central area of the city of Los Angeles, California, United States. It runs from La Cienega Boulevard in Culver City at its southern end to Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood on its northern end. From La Cienega Boulevard (between Culver City and Mid-City) to Sunset Boulevard between West Hollywood and Hollywood, Fairfax Avenue separates the Westside from the central part of the city along with Venice Boulevard, La Cienega Boulevard, Hauser Boulevard, San Vicente Boulevard, South Cochran Avenue, Wilshire Boulevard, 6th Street, Cochran Avenue, 4th Street, La Brea Avenue, Fountain Avenue and Sunset Boulevard.

Fairfax Avenue forms the western boundary of Hancock Park as well as Park La Brea, a 160-acre (60 ha), 4,222-unit apartment complex with over 10,000 residents.

Since World War II, the Fairfax District has been a heavily Jewish neighborhood in Mid-City West. Fairfax High School, on the corner of Fairfax and Melrose Avenue, was known as the alma mater of many entertainment industry personalities. Canter&#x27;s Deli has been a late night hangout in Los Angeles since the 1940s. CBS&#x27;s Television City is located on the corner of Fairfax and Beverly Boulevard, where thousands camp out to wait for a chance to watch &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, and the former site of Gilmore Stadium, where the minor league baseball team, the Hollywood Stars, used to play prior to the Dodgers moving from Brooklyn. World-famous recording studio, Cherokee Studios, home to over 250 gold and platinum records, is just above Melrose Avenue.

The Grove is off 3rd Street and Fairfax. Due to the high density of attractions, Fairfax is one of the most congested streets in Los Angeles. Little Ethiopia is further south by Olympic Blvd and north by Pico Boulevard between the Carthay Square and Wilshire Vista neighborhoods in West Los Angeles. South of Olympic, Fairfax narrows to two lanes, Pico Boulevard between the Crestview, Picfair Village, Wilshire Vista and Carthay Square neighborhoods in West Los Angeles and Venice Boulevard between the Crestview and Picfair Village neighborhoods in West Los Angeles and the Lafayette Square neighborhood in Mid-City.

At the northeast corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax is the former May Company department store building, which was converted to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and will be the future home of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. The Petersen Automotive Museum is located on the southeast corner of Wilshire/Fairfax.

Metro Local line 217 serves Fairfax Avenue. An underground station for the Metro D Line at Wilshire Boulevard is currently under construction and is due to open in 2023.

<doc id="315165" wikidata="Q7692403" url="?curid=315165" title="Techniques of Knowledge">
<text>Knowledge is a term used by Shri Hans Ji Maharaj (Hans Rawat) to denote a formulation of four specific techniques that were imparted in a process of initiation. The term continues to be used by two of Shri Hans Ji Maharaj&#x27;s sons, Satpal Rawat and Prem Rawat.

==Origins==
These techniques have some similarities to techniques in Sant Mat derived movements and may be derived from Surat Shabd Yoga. Additionally, Kranenborg writes that the techniques of Knowledge originated from the Surat Shabda Yoga or Sant Mat, the Path of the Sound Current, and that some of the techniques are related to the &#x27;japa-&#x27; or mantra-yoga which are similar to some techniques of Transcendental meditation and the Hare Krishnas.

The website &quot;Maharaji.org&quot; (1999) included the traceable story of &quot;Masters&quot; that, according to Prem Rawat, referred to the techniques of Knowledge since 1780, including Totapuri, Anandpuri Ji, Dayal Ji, Swarupanand Ji, and his father Hans Ji Maharaj.

==Descriptions==

According to the Dutch religious scholar and Christian minister Reender Kranenborg and the American religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, these techniques are secret and were originally called &quot;Light&quot;, &quot;Sound&quot;, &quot;Name&quot; or &quot;Word&quot; and &quot;Nectar&quot; but Prem Rawat now refers to them as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th techniques. Prem Rawat asks practitioners to promise &quot;not to reveal these techniques to anyone&quot;, but says to &quot;let other people go through their own journey... [so] they, too, can have the techniques when they are ready.&quot;

Kranenborg and Melton provide differing details of them in their writings but agree on a general description of the practices, referring for some of those, to tantric practices or sabda-brahman meditation. Another description including the details of the four techniques of knowledge is provided by Dr. Daniel Kriegman who describes the process for receiving Knowledge utilized by the Divine Light Mission in the early 1970s. Michael Drury, describes these techniques as helping the practitioner to develop &quot;a deep and spiritual self-knowledge.&quot;

==Experience==

Jeffrey K. Hadden cites Prem Rawat in saying that &quot;Knowledge is a way to be able to take all your senses that have been going outside all your life, turn them around and put them inside to feel and to actually experience you... What you are looking for is inside of you.&quot;

Glen Whitaker, former national organizer of Elan Vital in the UK, said &quot;That which we seek is already within us. The process of reaching it is one of learning to experience what is already there. It is one the individual needs to perform for him — or herself, with the guidance and help of the teacher&quot;.

According to George D. Chryssides, this Knowledge was based on self-understanding, providing the practitioner with calmness, peace, and contentment, as the inner-self is identical with the divine, and that Prem Rawat emphasizes that Knowledge is universal, not Indian, in nature.

According to Stephen J. Hunt &quot;the major focus of Prem Rawat is on stillness, peace, and contentment within the individual, and his &#x27;Knowledge&#x27; consists of the techniques to obtain them. Knowledge, roughly translated, means the happiness of the true self-understanding. Each individual should seek to comprehend his or her true self. In turn, this brings a sense of well-being, joy, and harmony as one comes in contact with one&#x27;s &quot;own nature.&quot; The process of reaching the true self within can only be achieved by the individual, but with the guidance and help of a teacher. Hence, the movement seems to embrace aspects of world-rejection and world-affirmation. The tens of thousands of followers in the West do not see themselves as members of a religion, but the adherents of a system of teachings that extol the goal of enjoying life to the full.&quot;

The experience of Knowledge is described by practitioners as internal and highly individual. The techniques are to be practised privately, with no social structure or hierarchy related to their practice. According to students, there is no liturgy or social obligation involved, but Prem Rawat instructs them to practise the techniques daily for at least one hour to fully benefit from them. They also say that the techniques are universally applicable and their practice has no impact on or relationship to a student&#x27;s gender, race, sexual orientation, economic status or national origin. Elan Vital, the organization that succeeded the Divine Light Mission, also states that practice of Knowledge will not affect a person&#x27;s religion.

==Knowledge sessions==
In his early days in the West, Prem Rawat or his instructors (called Mahatmas in India) conducted these sessions face-to-face with small groups.

Wim Haan, a student of theology who belonged to a critical movement within the Roman Catholic Church, wrote that receiving Knowledge involved a formal initiation that the aspirant had to keep secret and that he believed that the reason for the secrecy was a direct connection between the techniques, the initiation and the need to live a life of devotion to Rawat. Haan, who did not receive the techniques of Knowledge, also wrote that the fact that other groups may also use the same techniques would probably not help to increase the interest in them. Haan wrote this article based on observations of the Dutch branch of the defunct DLM between 1980 and 1981.

<text>NorthPoint Communications Group, Inc. was a competitive local exchange carrier focused on data transmission via digital subscriber lines. The company had relationships with Microsoft, Tandy Corporation, Intel, Verio, Cable &amp; Wireless, Frontier Corporation, Concentric Network, ICG Communications, Enron, Network Plus, and Netopia. The company had investments from The Carlyle Group, Accel Partners, Benchmark, and Greylock Partners.

==History==
The company was founded in 1997 by Michael W. Malaga and 5 other former executives of Metropolitan Fiber Systems.

On May 5, 1999, during the dot-com bubble, the company became a public company via an initial public offering in which it sold 15 million shares at $24 per share. Malaga, then 34 years old, was worth $300 million on paper.

In September 2000, Verizon agreed to acquire a 55% interest in the company and merge the companies&#x27; DSL businesses.

In November 2000, as its customers failed to pay their bills, NorthPoint restated downwards its financial performance for the third quarter of 2000, lowering revenue from $30 million to $24 million. After the earnings restatement, Verizon terminated its acquisition agreement, claiming that a material adverse change had occurred. Northpoint sued Verizon to force it to complete the transaction. The lawsuit was settled out of court in July 2002, with Verizon agreeing to pay $175 million to Northpoint. NorthPoint stated that &quot;it would cut its workforce by 19%, or 248 jobs, to lower expenses after the collapse of its merger with Verizon.&quot;

===Bankruptcy===
In January 2001, NorthPoint filed for bankruptcy. Some internet service providers, which faced a disruption in service, blamed the banks for failing to work out a deal to save the company. In March 2001, AT&amp;T Corporation acquired the assets of NorthPoint for $135 million in a liquidation.

<text>University of Mary Washington (UMW) is a public liberal arts university in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Established in 1908 as the Fredericksburg Teachers College, the institution was named Mary Washington College in 1938 after Mary Ball Washington, mother of the first president of the United States, George Washington. The General Assembly of Virginia changed the college&#x27;s name to University of Mary Washington in 2004 to reflect the addition of graduate and professional programs to the central undergraduate curriculum, as well as the establishment of more than one campus. The university offers more than 60 graduate and undergraduate degree programs in three colleges: Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education.

==History==
On March 14, 1908, Virginia Governor Claude A. Swanson signed into law legislation for the establishment of the new State Normal and Industrial School for Women. It was called Fredericksburg Teachers College. The institution was renamed Mary Washington College in 1938 after Mary Ball Washington, mother of the first president of the United States of America, George Washington, and longtime resident of Fredericksburg.

In 1944 the college became associated with the University of Virginia as its women&#x27;s college. Until that time, the University of Virginia had not admitted women as undergraduates, except in its education and nursing programs, although its postgraduate programs were coeducational. Following UVA&#x27;s transition to coeducational status in 1970, the Virginia General Assembly reorganized Mary Washington College in 1972 as a separate, coeducational institution.

In 1988, the University&#x27;s Center for Historic Preservation established the Historic Preservation Book Prize, awarded annually by a jury of preservation academics and professionals to the book with the most potential for breaking new ground and positively impacting the discipline of historic preservation in the United States. Since that time, the Prize has gone to David Lowenthal, Roy Rosenzweig, Elizabeth Blackmar, Mike Wallace, Richard Longstreth, Francoise Astorg Bollack, Catherine Fleming Bruce (the first African-American awardee) and Thomas Hubka, among others.

The General Assembly of Virginia enacted legislation changing the college&#x27;s name to University of Mary Washington on March 19, 2004, to reflect the addition of master&#x27;s degree programs and the establishment of more than one campus.

The university&#x27;s first LEED-certified building, CGPS North Building, was built in 2007. The university houses stops along the route of the Fredericksburg Regional Transit System (FRED). The school signed an Energy Performance Contract with the energy service company NORESCO from 2005 to 2007, enabling the campus to install water saving devices which reduced campus water consumption by 50%. NORESCO also installed low energy light fixtures, occupant sensors, HVAC controls, and completed replacement of leaking condensate piping.

==Academics==
University of Mary Washington is a public liberal arts university accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

UMW has five pre-professional programs: pre-dental, pre-law, pre-med, pre-pharmacy, and pre-veterinary. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees include a Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in addition to two degree completion programs – a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) and a Bachelor of Liberal Studies (BLS). Master&#x27;s degrees include a Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Education (M.Ed.), Master of Education for Professional Development or Added Endorsement (M.Ed.), Master of Science in Elementary Education (M.S.) and a Master of Geospatial Analysis (MSGA). UMW also offers a Geographic Information Science certificate.

==Campus==
Much of UMW&#x27;s Fredericksburg campus is located on Marye&#x27;s Heights, a steep hill which, like Sunken Road (the campus&#x27; northeastern boundary), played an important role in the 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg. The campus is within walking distance to the historic downtown with shops, restaurants and the Rappahannock River. Other campuses are Stafford Campus, seven miles north of Fredericksburg, and Dahlgren Campus, near the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division.

==Administration==
By statute of the Code of Virginia, University of Mary Washington is governed by a Board of Visitors, one member of which is elected every two years to serve as Rector. The UMW Board of Visitors is composed of twelve members appointed by the Governor of Virginia and confirmed by the General Assembly. At least six members of the Board must be alumni of the university, and no more than three may be nonresidents of Virginia. Each member serves a term of four years and may be eligible for reappointment to one successive term.

Troy Paino arrived at UMW July 1, 2016 as its tenth and current president. Prior to coming to UMW, Paino served for six years as president of Truman State University in Kirksville, Missouri.

<doc id="315175" wikidata="Q35970" url="?curid=315175" title="Mesothelium">
<text>The mesothelium is a membrane composed of simple squamous epithelial cells of mesodermal origin, which forms the lining of several body cavities: the pleura (pleural cavity around the lungs), peritoneum (abdominopelvic cavity including the mesentery, omenta, falciform ligament and the perimetrium) and pericardium (around the heart).

Mesothelial tissue also surrounds the male testis (as the tunica vaginalis) and occasionally the spermatic cord (in a patent processus vaginalis). Mesothelium that covers the internal organs is called visceral mesothelium, while one that covers the surrounding body walls is called the parietal mesothelium. The mesothelium that secretes serous fluid as a main function is also known as a serosa.

==Origin==
Mesothelium derives from the embryonic mesoderm cell layer, that lines the coelom (body cavity) in the embryo. It develops into the layer of cells that covers and protects most of the internal organs of the body.

== Structure ==
The mesothelium forms a monolayer of flattened squamous-like epithelial cells resting on a thin basement membrane supported by dense irregular connective tissue. Cuboidal mesothelial cells may be found at areas of injury, the milky spots of the omentum, and the peritoneal side of the diaphragm overlaying the lymphatic lacunae. The luminal surface is covered with microvilli. The proteins and serosal fluid trapped by the microvilli provide a slippery surface for internal organs to slide past one another.

==Function==
The mesothelium is composed of an extensive monolayer of specialized cells (mesothelial cells) that line the body&#x27;s serous cavities and internal organs. The main purpose of these cells is to produce a lubricating fluid that is released between layers, providing a slippery, non-adhesive, and protective surface to facilitate intracoelomic movement.
The mesothelium is also implicated in the transport and movement of fluid and particulate matter across the serosal cavities, leukocyte migration in response to inflammatory mediators, synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix proteins to aid in serosal repair, and the release of factors to promote the disposition and clearance of fibrin (such as plasminogen). Mesothelial cells are capable of phagocytosis and are antigen-presenting cells. The secretion of glycosaminoglycans and lubricants may protect the body against infection and tumor dissemination.

==Role in disease==
* Mesothelioma: (cancer of the mesothelium) is a disease in which cells of the mesothelium become abnormal and divide without control or order. They can invade and damage nearby tissues and organs. Cancer cells can also metastasize (spread) from their original site to other parts of the body. Most cases of mesothelioma begin in the pleura or peritoneum. More than 90% of mesothelioma cases are linked to asbestos exposure.
*Mesothelial hyperplasia
*Intra-abdominal adhesions: Normally, the mesothelium secretes plasminogen, which removes fibrin deposits. During surgical procedures, the mesothelium may be damaged. Its fibrinolytic capacity becomes insufficient and fibrin accumulates, causing fibrous adhesions between opposing surfaces. These adhesions cause intestinal obstruction and female infertility if it occurs in the abdomen, and may impair cardiac and lung function in the thorax.
*Ultrafiltration failure: The peritoneal mesothelium is implicated in the long-term development of ultrafiltration failure in peritoneal dialysis patients. The presence of supra-physiological glucose concentrations, acidity, and glucose degradation products in peritoneal dialysis fluids contribute to the fibrosis of the peritoneal mesothelium, either by epithelial–mesenchymal transition or increased proliferation of existing fibroblasts. A fibrosed peritoneum results in the increased passage of solutes across the peritoneum and ultrafiltration failure.

<doc id="315176" wikidata="Q365670" url="?curid=315176" title="Roy Harper (singer)">
<text>Roy Harper (born 12 June 1941) is an English folk rock singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He has released 22 studio albums (and 10 live ones) across a career that stretches back to 1966. As a musician, Harper is known for his distinctive fingerstyle playing and lengthy, lyrical, complex compositions, reflecting his love of jazz and the poet John Keats.

Harper&#x27;s influence has been acknowledged by Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, Pete Townshend, Kate Bush, Pink Floyd, and Ian Anderson, of Jethro Tull, who said Harper was his &quot;primary influence as an acoustic guitarist and songwriter.&quot; Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described him as &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s most complex and eloquent lyricists and genuinely original songwriters... much admired by his peers&quot;. Across the Atlantic, his influence has been acknowledged by Seattle-based acoustic band Fleet Foxes, American musician and producer Jonathan Wilson, and Californian harpist Joanna Newsom, with whom he has also toured.

In 2005, Harper was awarded the MOJO Hero Award, and in 2013 a Lifetime Achievement Award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. His most recent album, &quot;Man and Myth&quot;, was released in 2013. In 2016, Harper celebrated his 75th birthday by performing concerts in Clonakilty, Birmingham, Manchester, London, and Edinburgh.

==Early life==
Harper was born in 1941 in Rusholme, a suburb of Manchester. His mother, Muriel, died three weeks after he was born. From the age of 6, he lived in St Annes-on-Sea, a place he described as being &quot;like a cemetery with bus stops&quot;. He was brought up by his father and stepmother, with whom he became disillusioned because of her religious beliefs (although they reconciled in 1980, just before her death). His anti-religious views would later become a familiar theme within his music.

Harper began writing poems when he was 12. At the age of 13, he began playing skiffle music with his younger brother David (&quot;Davey&quot; on the album &quot;Flat Baroque and Berserk&quot;), as well as becoming influenced by blues music. At 14 he formed his first group (&quot;De Boys&quot;) with his brothers David and Harry. Harper was educated at King Edward VII School, Lytham St Annes, then a grammar school, and left at the age of 15 (1956) to join the Royal Air Force to follow an ambition to be a pilot. After two years Harper rejected the rigid discipline and feigned madness to obtain a military discharge, as a result receiving an electroconvulsive therapy treatment at Princess Mary&#x27;s RAF Hospital, Wendover. After being discharged from there, he spent one day inside the former Lancaster Moor Mental Institute before escaping. These experiences would be recalled in &quot;Committed&quot;, a song on Harper&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Sophisticated Beggar&quot;. From around 1961 he busked around North Africa, Europe and London for a few years.

Musically, Harper&#x27;s earliest influences were American blues musician Lead Belly and folk singer Woody Guthrie and, in his teens, jazz musician Miles Davis. Of the blues musicians Lead Belly, Big Bill Broonzy, and Josh White, Harper said they made music which &quot;...seemed to be from a different planet ...We&#x27;d never heard anything like it. It changed our world overnight, a sledge hammer of a cultural change ...an equivalent would be to suddenly hear music from outer space&quot;. Harper was also exposed to classical music in his childhood and has pointed to the influence of Jean Sibelius&#x27;s &quot;Karelia Suite&quot;. Lyrical influences include the 19th century Romantics, especially Shelley, and Keats&#x27;s poem &quot;Endymion&quot;. Harper has also cited the Beat poets as being highly influential, particularly Jack Kerouac. Harper played his first paid performance at a poetry reading in Newcastle in 1960.

Returning to the UK in 1963 or 1964, Harper started to write more songs than poetry. He obtained a residency at London&#x27;s famous Soho folk music club Les Cousins in 1965, having been introduced to it by Peter Bellamy of The Young Tradition. Harper&#x27;s first advertised performance was on 5 October 1965. Within his first week Harper saw John Renbourn, Alexis Korner, Paul Simon, Alex Campbell, and Bert Jansch play, and he would play and associate with other artists later, including John Martyn, Joni Mitchell, and Nick Drake.

==Musical career==
===1966–69: The first record deals===
Harper&#x27;s first album, &quot;Sophisticated Beggar&quot;, was recorded in 1966 after he was spotted at Les Cousins and signed to Strike Records. The album consisted of Harper&#x27;s songs and poetry backed by acoustic guitar, recorded with a Revox tape machine by Pierre Tubbs and with contributions from English guitarist Paul Brett. Columbia Records recognised Harper&#x27;s potential and hired American producer Shel Talmy to produce Harper&#x27;s second album, &quot;Come Out Fighting Ghengis Smith&quot;, which was released in 1968. The 11-minute track &quot;Circle&quot;, &quot;a soundscape of Harper&#x27;s difficult youth&quot;, was notable for marking a widening of his musical style away from the more traditional side of contemporary folk music heard at the time. Harper had an interest in traditional folk but did not consider himself a bona fide member of the folk scene. He later explained: Harper&#x27;s record company had different expectations. &#x27;They wanted me to write commercial pop songs and when they heard the album I made for them, they didn&#x27;t have a clue. They wanted hits. And I gave them &quot;Circle&quot;&#x27;. Bert Jansch contributed sleeve notes for the album and Harper paid tribute to Jansch with the song &quot;Pretty Baby&quot;; the B-side non-album track of his first single (released in March 1966). During this period, Harper was managed by American music entrepreneur Jo Lustig, manager of Pentangle and former agent to Julie Felix.

In June 1968, Harper performed at the first free concert ever held at Hyde Park, acting as compere and sharing the bill with Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd and Tyrannosaurus Rex. At the time, he spoke of co-writing a rock opera with Pink Floyd. No opera resulted, but it was the beginning of a musical relationship. Harper began to attract a following of fans from the underground music scene and tour the UK, performing at numerous venues such as the Lyceum Ballroom, Klooks Kleek and Mothers; venues that would gradually gain recognition for the variety and quality of their musical acts. Mothers in Birmingham was one such venue, and one to which Harper would frequently return. Harper later told Brum Beat magazine:
A track from &quot;Come Out Fighting Ghengis Smith&quot;, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Got Any Money in the Summer&quot; also appeared on the first bargain-priced sampler album, &quot;The Rock Machine Turns You On&quot;. The album was released in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and a number of other European countries as part of an international marketing campaign by Columbia Records (known in Europe as CBS).

In 1969 Harper undertook a short 6-venue tour with Ron Geesin and Ralph McTell. The tour programme contained the introductory paragraph: 

That same year, Harper released his third album &quot;Folkjokeopus&quot; again produced by Shel Talmy, and released by Liberty Records. Side two included an extended 17-minute track, titled &quot;McGoohan&#x27;s Blues&quot;, which Harper referred to as the &quot;main statement&quot; within the album. Of his non-conformance to radio-friendly, standard, three-minute songs, Harper claimed it to be a revolt, and that he regarded the three-minute pop song as an anathema, a jingle to sell a band. (The title for &quot;McGoohan&#x27;s Blues&quot; was a reference to actor Patrick McGoohan, who had starred in the UK TV series &quot;The Prisoner&quot; two years earlier). The track &quot;Sergeant Sunshine&quot; would also appear on &quot;Son of Gutbucket&quot;, a 1969 sampler album released to promote artists on the Liberty Records label.

During this period Harper also visited the Dolphin Club in Oslo, Norway, where he became acquainted with folk singer Lillebjørn Nilsen. Nilsen learned one of Harper&#x27;s songs, &quot;On the First Day of April&quot;, which he translated to &quot;Ravneferd&quot; and recorded for his debut solo album &quot;Tilbake&quot; in 1971. Harper and Nilsen along with Finn Kalvik performed together on 23 January 1970 at a concert held in the University of Oslo. Harper&#x27;s visit coincided with the emergence of the Norwegian &#x27;folk music wave&#x27; (Visebølgen) and the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) recorded Harper on the occasion of the concert. Kalvik would later go on to record Norwegian versions of two Harper songs; &quot;I Hate the White Man&quot; (&quot;Den hvite mann&quot;) and &quot;Don&#x27;t You Grieve&quot; (&quot;Kjære ikke gråt&quot;).

===1970–80: The Harvest years===
With Harper&#x27;s reputation growing, Pink Floyd&#x27;s former manager Peter Jenner signed him to a long-term (and at times confrontational) deal with EMI&#x27;s &#x27;underground&#x27; subsidiary, Harvest Records. Over a ten-year period, Harper recorded eight albums at the Abbey Road Studios for the Harvest label and for much of this period was managed and produced by Jenner, initially acting for Blackhill Enterprises. According to Jenner, 
Harper&#x27;s first tour of the United States followed the release of his fourth studio album, &quot;Flat Baroque and Berserk&quot;. The album included the track &quot;Another Day&quot;, a song destined to be performed live by Harper for many years to come, and covered by several other artists including This Mortal Coil (featuring Elizabeth Fraser on vocals) and Kate Bush. The album also featured the Nice on the track &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;; its ethereal sound achieved by a wah-wah pedal attached to Harper&#x27;s acoustic guitar.

After the Bath Festival of 1970, Led Zeppelin paid tribute to Harper with their version of the traditional song &quot;Shake &#x27;Em on Down&quot;. Retitled &quot;Hats Off to (Roy) Harper&quot;, it appeared on the album &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;. According to Jimmy Page, the band admired the way Harper stood by his principles and did not sell out to commercial pressures. In mutual appreciation of their work, Harper would often attend live performances by Led Zeppelin over the subsequent decade and contributed sleeve photography to the album &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;.

Harper&#x27;s critically acclaimed 1971 album was a four-song epic, &quot;Stormcock&quot;. The album featured Jimmy Page on guitar (credited as &quot;S. Flavius Mercurius&quot; for contractual reasons) and David Bedford&#x27;s orchestral arrangements (Bedford would also collaborate on some of Harper&#x27;s future releases). Harper felt the album to be not particularly well promoted by his record label at the time and later stated: Nevertheless, &quot;Stormcock&quot; would remain a favourite album of Harper&#x27;s fans and influence musicians for decades to come. Thirty-five years later (in 2006) fellow Mancunian Johnny Marr of English alternative rock band the Smiths said: Joanna Newsom cited &quot;Stormcock&quot; as an influence upon her 2006 release &quot;Ys&quot; and in 2011, Robin Pecknold of Seattle, Washington-based folk band Fleet Foxes stated that he took inspiration from &quot;Stormcock&quot; when recording Fleet Foxes second album &quot;Helplessness Blues&quot;.

In 1972, Harper made his acting debut playing Mike Preston alongside Carol White in the John Mackenzie film &quot;Made&quot;. The film was chosen (along with &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;) to represent Britain at the Venice Film Festival. Harper also recorded the soundtrack for the film, released the following year as &quot;Lifemask&quot;, again with contributions from Jimmy Page. At the time, &quot;Lifemask&quot; was created as Harper&#x27;s final bow, as he had been diagnosed with the (then) little-known genetic condition HHT, which caused polycythemia, incapacitating him. The cover art shows Harper&#x27;s life mask, as opposed to the &#x27;death mask&#x27; it might have been.

After recovering (treatment involved frequent venesection), his next album (&quot;Valentine&quot;) was released on Valentine&#x27;s Day, 14 February 1974, and featured contributions from Jimmy Page. A concert to mark its release was held on the same day at London&#x27;s Rainbow Theatre, with Led Zeppelin&#x27;s Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, and John Bonham; David Bedford, Max Middleton, Ronnie Lane, and Keith Moon performing alongside Harper. His first live album &quot;Flashes from the Archives of Oblivion&quot;, featuring two tracks recorded at that concert, soon followed.

Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1975 release &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; saw Harper sing lead vocals on the song &quot;Have a Cigar&quot;. Roger Waters intended to record the part himself, but had strained his voice while recording &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; and David Gilmour declined to sing. Harper was recording his album &quot;HQ&quot; in Studio 2 of Abbey Road at the same time as Pink Floyd were working in Studio 3; learning of the band&#x27;s dilemma, Harper offered to sing the lead. The song is one of only three songs by Pink Floyd not sung by one of their permanent members (the others being &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Hey, Hey, Rise Up!&quot;). David Gilmour returned the favour by appearing on &quot;HQ&quot;, along with Harper&#x27;s occasional backing band, &#x27;Trigger&#x27; (Chris Spedding, Dave Cochran, Bill Bruford and John Paul Jones). The single &quot;When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease&quot;, taken from &quot;HQ&quot;, is one of Harper&#x27;s best known songs. Harper also co-wrote the song &quot;Short and Sweet&quot; with Gilmour for Gilmour&#x27;s first solo record, &quot;David Gilmour&quot; (released in 1978), and the song subsequently appeared on his own album &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; (released in 1980).

Controversy followed the release of 1977&#x27;s &quot;Bullinamingvase&quot;. The owners of Watford Gap service station objected to criticism of their food – &quot;Watford Gap, Watford Gap/A plate of grease and a load of crap...&quot; – in the lyrics of the song &quot;Watford Gap&quot;, as did an EMI board member who was also a non-executive director of Blue Boar (the owners of the service station). Harper was forced to drop it from future UK copies of the album, though it remained on the US LP and reappeared on a later CD reissues. The album also featured the song &quot;One of Those Days in England&quot;, with backing vocals by Paul McCartney and Linda; the single from the album went to number 42 in the UK charts. During this period, Harper&#x27;s band were renamed &#x27;Chips&#x27; and included Andy Roberts, Dave Lawson, Henry McCullough, John Halsey and Dave Cochran. In April 1978, Harper began writing lyrics for the next Led Zeppelin album with Jimmy Page, but the project was shelved when lead singer Robert Plant returned from a break after the death of his son, Karac Pendragon.

Following the success of &quot;Bullinamingvase&quot;, Harper was asked &quot;to write another record quickly&quot;. Demo recordings with Harper&#x27;s newly formed backing band &#x27;Black Sheep&#x27; (Andy Roberts, Dave Lawson, Henry McCullough, John Halsey and Dave Cochran, a.k.a. Dave C. Drill) were made, but Harper felt them to be rushed. The record company, who &quot;were in the first stages of a collapse in sales&quot;, were not interested in the recordings, nor were they prepared to provide studio time when requested, telling Harper to come back in six months. As a result, Harper withheld the publishing rights to that which had been recorded; an album provisionally entitled &quot;Commercial Breaks (doesn&#x27;t it?)&quot; and was (in his own words) &quot;outlawed&quot; by the record company.

From 1975 to 1980 Harper worked with English musician and &#x27;Black Sheep&#x27; member Andy Roberts sometimes performing as a duo. During this period, Harper spent considerable time in the United States and signed with the US division of Chrysalis Records, who released &quot;HQ&quot; under a different title – &quot;When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease&quot; – and with alternative artwork. Chrysalis considered the original Hipgnosis-designed album cover of Harper walking on water to be too offensive for an American release. Harper disagreed, but was given no choice by the label. Chrysalis also changed the title of Harper&#x27;s next album, &quot;Bullinamingvase&quot;, to &quot;One of Those Days in England&quot;. In 1978, US Chrysalis reissued Harper&#x27;s first five Harvest albums, only one of which (&quot;Flat, Baroque and Berserk&quot;) had been previously released in America.

On 28 December 1979, BBC TV aired the &quot;Kate Bush Christmas Special&quot;. As well as playing songs from her first two albums, Bush and her guest, Peter Gabriel, performed Harper&#x27;s &quot;Another Day&quot;. Their duet was discussed for release as a single, but never appeared.

Harper returned to the studio a few years after his dispute with EMI to record and prepare his next album &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;. At the time, Harper knew it would be his last release on the label and it was these demos that &quot;...were destined to gather dust on a shelf labelled &#x27;Commercial Breaks&#x27;...&quot;. (It was not until Harper&#x27;s 1988 release &quot;Loony on the Bus&quot; that some of these songs became officially available, and another six years until the album was finally released as &quot;Commercial Breaks&quot; (1994)).

In 1980 Harper released &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, which was indeed his final Harvest release. The album features David Gilmour both on guitar and as co-writer of half of its tracks. On one of those tracks, &quot;You&quot;, Harper duets with Kate Bush. Harper later reciprocated by singing backing vocals on &quot;Breathing&quot; on Bush&#x27;s album &quot;Never For Ever&quot;; Bush&#x27;s first no. 1 album, the first ever album by a British female solo artist to top the UK album chart, and the first album by any female solo artist to enter the chart at no. 1. Bush thanked Harper on the album&#x27;s cover for &quot;holding onto the poet in his music&quot;. During a BBC Radio interview by Paul Gambaccini, Bush praised Harper, stating: Of Bush, Harper later said, A decade later, Harper and Bush would again collaborate on his 1990 release &quot;Once&quot;.

===1981–89: Recession and repossession===
Harper&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Work of Heart&quot; was released on Public Records, a newly formed record label Harper created with Mark Thompson (son of English historian, socialist and peace campaigner E.P. Thompson). During this period Harper toured with a band consisting of Tony Franklin on Bass, Bob Wilson of the Steve Gibbons Band, George Jackson on drums and Dave Morris on keyboards. The album was chosen by Derek Jewell of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as &quot;Album of the Year&quot; in 1982, but it did not sell well and the short-lived label went under.

During this period Harper lost his home, a farm in the village of Marden, Herefordshire, to the bank. Of this period Harper stated: 

The original demo version of &quot;Work of Heart&quot; was later released (in 1984) on a limited edition (830 copies) vinyl release entitled &quot;Born in Captivity&quot;.

Throughout 1984, Harper toured the United Kingdom with Jimmy Page performing a predominantly acoustic set at folk festivals under various guises such as the MacGregors, and Themselves. In 1985, &quot;Whatever Happened to Jugula?&quot; was released. The album caused a resurgence of interest in Harper and his music. (Tony Franklin, bass player in Harper&#x27;s group at this time, later joined Page in the Firm). In April 1984, Harper and Gilmour performed &quot;Short and Sweet&quot; (a song they co-wrote) during Gilmour&#x27;s three-night run at the Hammersmith Odeon. This version later appeared on the &quot;David Gilmour Live 1984&quot; concert film. Harper also provided backing vocals on Gilmour&#x27;s newly released album, &quot;About Face&quot;.

On 20 June 1984 Harper performed at the last Stonehenge Free Festival, sharing the bill with Hawkwind and the Enid. The concert was videoed and released as Stonehenge 84.

As a result of his continual touring and the popularity of &quot;Whatever Happened to Jugula?&quot;, Harper re-signed to EMI and in 1986 released a live album, &quot;In Between Every Line&quot; (containing recordings from his performances at the Cambridge Folk Festival), and in 1988 the studio album, &quot;Descendants of Smith&quot;. The renewed relationship between Harper and EMI did not last and from 1985 more of his earlier albums were becoming available on the newly formed Awareness Records label.

1988 also saw the release of &quot;Loony on the Bus&quot;, a collection of tracks recorded a decade earlier and intended for release in 1977 as &quot;Commercial Breaks&quot; (with the sub-title, &#x27;doesn&#x27;t it?&#x27;). The original release having been held back because of disputes over funding and content between Harper and EMI. Sales of &quot;Loony on the Bus&quot; would fund Harper&#x27;s 1990 release; &quot;Once&quot;.

===1990–99: Science Friction===
In 1993 Harper established his own record label Science Friction and obtained the rights to all his previously released albums. As a result, from 1994 much of Harper&#x27;s back catalogue became available on CD once more.

Harper was very productive during the decade, releasing five studio albums: &quot;Once&quot; (1990), &quot;Death or Glory?&quot; (1992), &quot;Commercial Breaks&quot; (1994), &quot;The Dream Society&quot; (1998), a collection of poetry and spoken word tracks &quot;Poems, Speeches, Thoughts and Doodles&quot; (1997); two live albums: &quot;Unhinged&quot; (1993) and &quot;Live at Les Cousins&quot; (1996; recorded in 1969) and six individual CDs of live concerts and sessions recorded by the BBC (1997). Two official C90 cassette tapes of concerts at the Red Lion in Birmingham (1984 &amp; 1985) were made available from Harper&#x27;s agency (Acorn Entertainments).

In addition, Harper released a live video, &quot;Once&quot; (1990), an EP &quot;Burn the World&quot; (1990), a 4-track CD single &quot;Death or Glory?&quot; (1992), a limited edition live cassette &quot;Born in Captivity II&quot; (1992) (featuring cricketer Graeme Fowler and a cricket poem written by Harper: &quot;Three Hundred Words&quot;), a compilation album &quot;An Introduction to ...&quot; (1994), and a reissue of &quot;Descendants of Smith&quot; (his 1988 release) renamed &quot;Garden of Uranium&quot; (1994).

Once again Harper collaborated with David Gilmour and Kate Bush on his 1990 release, &quot;Once&quot;. The album also featured contributions from Nigel Mazlyn Jones, Mark Feltham and Tony Franklin. One of the album tracks, &quot;The Black Cloud of Islam&quot; a song written about Colonel Gaddafi, the Lockerbie bombing, and a despairing castigation of radical Islam, provoked criticism from some of Harper&#x27;s fans at the time. Whilst religion, Harper&#x27;s &quot;first and only enemy&quot; has always been a recurring theme in his music, he was &#x27;red-carded by a lot of his 1990 following... who left in substantial numbers&#x27;.

In 1992, his second marriage ended and Harper released &quot;Death or Glory?&quot; an album that (upon its original release) contained a number of songs and spoken word pieces referencing his loss and pain. &quot;She ran off with someone else&quot; said Harper, &quot;a violin player (Nigel Kennedy) I’d been working on an adaptation of Brahms&#x27;s Violin Concerto with. I was really traumatised by that. Anybody who&#x27;s been suddenly left like that will know it&#x27;s very, very traumatic. I managed to come out of it, but it took about five years. It was like a death, a loss, like being told your child&#x27;s been killed in a war. There&#x27;s no other way to describe it. When you go through that, it changes your life forever, there&#x27;s no point in not admitting it. I withdrew, retreated, became an exile&quot;.

Throughout the decade, Harper&#x27;s musical influence began to be recognised by a younger generation of musicians, some of whom covered his songs or invited him to make guest appearances on their albums. In 1995 Harper contributed spoken words on the Tea Party&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;The Edges of Twilight&quot;, and appeared on stage for their New Year concert in Montreal. In 1996 Roy recited &quot;Bad Speech&quot; from his album &quot;Whatever Happened to Jugula?&quot; on Anathema&#x27;s album &quot;Eternity&quot; (the album also contains a cover version of &quot;Hope&quot; from the same album). The track &quot;Time&quot; from The Tea Party&#x27;s 1996 multimedia CD, &quot;Alhambra&quot;, was sung and co-written by Harper.

Harper contributed his version of Jethro Tull&#x27;s song, &quot;Up the &#x27;Pool&quot; (from &quot;Living in the Past&quot;) for the 1996 tribute album, &quot;To Cry You a Song – A Collection of Tull Tales&quot;, a version Anderson liked so much he began to perform the &quot;forgotten piece&quot; again in concert and later described it as his favourite Jethro Tull cover song.

In 1998, Jethro Tull singer Ian Anderson contributed flute to the song, &quot;These Fifty Years&quot; on Harper&#x27;s &quot;The Dream Society&quot;, an album based on emotional, philosophical and actual events in Harper&#x27;s life. Views of procreation, his mother&#x27;s continued presence in him and something of his psychological impulses are punctuated by a couple of moments of satire, a love song and a lament, followed by the lengthy &quot;These Fifty years&quot;, of which he has said, &quot;In some ways its (anti-organised religion) theme is similar to &#x27;The Same Old Rock&#x27;, but in many others I think it&#x27;s stronger&quot;. Reportedly, Anderson said that the only reason he originally left Blackpool was because Harper did. Other artists who covered Harper&#x27;s songs (or songs on his albums) throughout the decade include Dean Carter, Ava Cherry &amp; The Astronettes, Green Crown, The Kitchen Cynics, the Levellers, Roydan Styles and Pete Townshend. Harper also undertook a short tour of the US, where some performances were supported by Daevid Allen, former Soft Machine and Gong band member.

===2000–10: Into the new millennium===
In 2000, Harper released an almost entirely acoustic album, &quot;The Green Man&quot;, accompanied by the Tea Party&#x27;s Jeff Martin on guitar, hurdy-gurdy and numerous other instruments. The following year (2001) Harper celebrated his 60th birthday with a concert performance at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall and was joined by numerous guest artists including; David Bedford, Nick Harper, Jeff Martin and John Renbourn. The concert was recorded and released shortly after as a double CD, &quot;Royal Festival Hall Live – 10 June 2001&quot;.

In 2003, Harper published &quot;The Passions of Great Fortune&quot;, a large format book containing all the lyrics to his albums (and singles) to date, it also contained a wealth of photographs and commentary on his songs.

Harper released his second CD single in April 2005; &quot;The Death of God&quot;. The 13-minute song, a critique of the war in Iraq, featured guest guitarist Matt Churchill (who also performed live with Harper during this period). A video of the track, intermixing animation with a live performance, is . 2003 also saw the release of &quot;Counter Culture&quot;, a double compilation album featuring songs from Harper&#x27;s 35-year songwriting period. &quot;Counter Culture&quot; received a five-star review from &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine. Harper also contributed a recital of &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; for &quot;The Wildlife Album&quot;, an 18-track compilation CD to benefit the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Ulster Wildlife Trust.

2005 saw Harper release his first DVD, &quot;Beyond the Door&quot;. Composed of live footage recorded in 2004 at Irish folk club &quot;De Barra&#x27;s&quot; in Clonakilty, Cork and &quot;The Death of God&quot; video. The package also includes an additional 10-track audio CD and received a 4-star review from &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;Uncut&quot;, and &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, who made it their &quot;DVD of the month&quot;.

In September 2007, Harper supported Californian harpist Joanna Newsom at her Royal Albert Hall performance. Newsom, impressed by Harper&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Stormcock&quot; found it served as an inspiration for her similarly expansive second album, &quot;Ys&quot;. During his Royal Albert Hall appearance with Newsom, Harper played &quot;Stormcock&quot; in its entirety. At the time, Harper made an announcement on his website that he was &quot;...taking a break from the live scene... retired from gigging...&quot; and just wanted &quot;...the time and space to write...&quot;

During this period, Harper dedicated his time to collecting and compiling his life&#x27;s work in various formats. One of the intended projects was to be the making of a documentary DVD to round off this process. However, as of 2016 this remains unreleased.

In 2008, plans were announced for a Roy Harper tribute album. The album, &quot;What You Need Is What You Have, The Songs of Roy Harper&quot; was being compiled by Laurel Canyon folk singer, musician and producer Jonathan Wilson, and was to feature Chris Robinson (the Black Crowes), Gary Louris (the Jayhawks), Johnathan Rice, Eric D. Johnson (Fruit Bats, the Shins), Benji Hughes, Will Oldham, Andy Cabic, Dawes, Jenny O., Josh Tillman and others. At present, the collection remains unfinished, having been delayed beyond its planned 2009 release date. Six of the tracks can be heard on the project&#x27;s Myspace page.

In 2010, Newsom once again invited Harper to guest for her on several of her European Tour Dates.

Plans for Harper to star as Rodriguez El Toro in the film &quot;Rebel City Rumble&quot; were also announced. As of 2016 the project is still categorised as &#x27;in development&#x27;.

===2011–present: &quot;Man and Myth&quot;===
On 2 April 2011, Roy Harper played a concert for a small audience at Metropolis Studios as part of the ITV Legends series.
The concert was recorded on video and released on DVD as &quot;Classic Rock Legends: Roy Harper – Live in Concert at Metropolis Studios&quot;. The package also contains an audio CD of the concert. Through the summer of 2011, Harper made a number of appearances on broadcast media. On 24 July 2011, Harper appeared as the lunchtime guest on the British cricketing radio programme, Test Match Special. During the show Harper was interviewed and also performed &quot;When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease&quot;. A televised interview followed on BBC Breakfast on 19 September 2011, and Harper was also interviewed by Robert Elms on his BBC London 94.9 show on 20 September 2011. During the show, Harper performed &quot;Another Day&quot; (a song from his 1970 album &quot;Flat Baroque and Berserk&quot;) live in the studio. A further interview took place on Mike Harding&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show on 21 September 2011. On 23 September Harper was interviewed on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;. A segment of Harper performing &quot;Commune&quot; (from his 1974 album &quot;Valentine&quot;) on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; in 1974 was shown. Harper performed &quot;Another Day&quot;, an abbreviated version of &quot;I Hate The White Man&quot; (from his 1970 album &quot;Flat Baroque and Berserk&quot;) and &quot;The Green Man&quot; (as part of a web exclusive performance).

The media appearances were to promote the release of a new compilation album, &quot;Songs of Love and Loss&quot;, a compilation of Harper&#x27;s love songs released as an introduction to the digital release of 19 of Harper&#x27;s albums for the first time. The digital catalogue was to be released in batches of four over the forthcoming months. The album (and most of Harper&#x27;s back catalogue) remain available to download on Harper&#x27;s website in FLAC and MP3 formats.

On 5 November 2011, Harper returned to London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall to celebrate his 70th birthday and perform once again with special guests Jonathan Wilson, Nick Harper, Joanna Newsom and Jimmy Page. The performance was described in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as &quot;...an evening of devastating musical brilliance...&quot; and by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as an &quot;...historic concert&quot;.

In 2012, the Press Photographers Association of Ireland awarded third place in the Portraits section of their annual competition to a photographic portrait of Harper by photographer Alan Place.

In December 2012 plans to release a new album, Harper&#x27;s first studio release of newly recorded material for 13 years, were confirmed. The album, &quot;Man and Myth&quot;, featured contributions from Pete Townshend and Jonathan Wilson, and was released 23 September 2013.

Harper performed live through August 2013, playing at Debarras Folk Club in Clonakilty, West Cork, Ireland (11 August), at the Green Man Festival in Glanusk, Wales (17 August) and at Beautiful Days in Escot Park, Devon (18 August).

During this period Harper was interviewed by Laura Rawlings on her BBC Radio Bristol show on 15 August 2013, and also by Rob Hughes of the Telegraph Online who declared &quot;Roy Harper has spent the past five decades crafting some of the most vivid, ravishingly beautiful music of our times...&quot;. Harper also performed at an in-store performance at Rough Trade East, London. A limited number of tickets were available to those who purchased the album in store that day, and the event was also streamed live to a limited number of fans who had pre-ordered the album.

On 25 September Sky Arts broadcast &quot;Roy Harper: Man &amp; Myth – The Documentary&quot;. An exclusive documentary film, shot mainly at Harper&#x27;s home in Ireland, it traced Harper&#x27;s career and examined his output. Included were interviews with fellow musicians Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and Johnny Marr.

In support of &quot;Man and Myth&#x27;s&quot; release, Harper undertook a short, three-date, UK tour, performing at the Royal Festival Hall, London (22 October), the Bridgewater Hall, Manchester (25 October) and the Colston Hall, Bristol (27 October). At each performance he was accompanied by Jonathan Wilson and supported by a string and brass ensemble.

In November 2013 Uncut placed &quot;Man &amp; Myth&quot; at 6 in their top 50 Albums of 2013. &quot;Mojo&quot; also placed &quot;Man and Myth&quot; at 39 in their list of the top 50 Albums of 2013.

In April 2016, to celebrate his 75th birthday, Harper announced four concerts in September with string and brass ensemble, in Birmingham, Manchester, London and Edinburgh. He kicked off the tour at De Barra&#x27;s pub in Clonakilty, Co. Cork, Ireland.

In March 2019 Harper toured the UK again, with concerts in Birmingham, Bexhill-on-Sea, London (The London Palladium), Liverpool, Gateshead, Leeds and Edinburgh. He kicked off the tour at De Barra&#x27;s pub in Clonakilty, Co. Cork, Ireland.

==Awards==

Another son, Ben Harper (by English actress Verna Harvey), lives in the US. Songwriter and record producer Felix Howard says Harper is his children&#x27;s &quot;biological grandfather&quot;.

Harper is an atheist.

Following police interviews in February 2013, Harper was charged in November 2013 with ten counts of alleged historical child sexual abuse over a period of several years with an under-age female. After a two-week trial in early 2015, he was found not guilty by a jury of two of the charges with no verdicts on the remaining five, then in November 2015, following a review by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, the remaining charges were dropped.

<text>Joey Scarbury (born June 7, 1955) is an American singer and songwriter known for his 1981 hit song, &quot;Theme from &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot; (Believe It or Not)&quot;.

==Childhood and early music career==
Scarbury was born in Ontario, California, United States. Growing up in Thousand Oaks, he was continually encouraged in his ambition to sing by his mother. At the age of 14, after being spotted by songwriter Jimmy Webb&#x27;s father, he was signed to a recording contract with Dunhill Records. Scarbury&#x27;s first single, &quot;She Never Smiles Anymore,&quot; flopped, and he was soon without a record label.

==1970s==
Citing Dan Seals of England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley as an influence, he stayed around the music business throughout the 1970s, first as a backup for artists including country artist Loretta Lynn, and occasionally recording his own material. Although he had a minor chart single with &quot;Mixed Up Guy&quot; in 1971 (#52 CAN), real chart success eluded him for the rest of the decade.
He also covered The Partridge Family song from their debut album Point Me In The Direction Of Albuquerque on the same label as them, Bell Records in 1971. Mike Post produced and arranged it.

==1980s and &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;==
In the late 1970s, he started working for record producer and composer Mike Post. Post was hired along with Stephen Geyer to write the theme tune for a new TV series titled &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;, about an average high school teacher who comes into possession of a superhero outfit from aliens.

After recording the full-length version of the song, titled &quot;Believe It or Not&quot;, it was edited down to a minute for broadcast as the theme song for the show. The show&#x27;s success (along with its catchy theme song) prompted Elektra Records to first release it as a single, shooting up to number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 5 in Canada in 1981. A similarly titled album, &quot;America&#x27;s Greatest Hero&quot;, was also hastily produced, and it also sold well. The song also reached #6 on the Canadian AC charts.
However, Scarbury could not follow the song&#x27;s success, and after charting at number 49 (#24 CAN AC) with a follow-up single &quot;When She Dances,&quot; he once again disappeared from the charts. He went on to work with Post again in the mid-1980s to record the song &quot;Back to Back&quot; for the television series &quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot;, and teamed up with Desiree Goyette to record &quot;Flashbeagle&quot; and &quot;Snoopy&quot; for the &quot;Peanuts&quot; special &quot;It&#x27;s Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown&quot;. He also performed the opening theme for the television series &quot;Jennifer Slept Here&quot;, but never released another single in the 1980s. Scarbury also sang the recording on &quot;Splashdance&quot; album and rerecorded it for Donald Duck&#x27;s 50th Birthday with new lyrics. He sang the demo for Disney’s &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot;.

==1990s and songwriting==
In 1990, Scarbury found success again as a songwriter. This time his co-written song, &quot;No Matter How High&quot;, was recorded by the Oak Ridge Boys and was a number-one country music hit. His co-writer was Even Stevens, who previously had found success with co-writing songs for country star Eddie Rabbitt, as well as the Kenny Rogers hit &quot;Love Will Turn You Around&quot; from the motion picture &quot;Six Pack&quot;. In 1993, he teamed up with Jennifer Warnes to record the theme from the short-lived sitcom &quot;Almost Home&quot;.

Scarbury was invited to New York City by radio station WPLJ-FM in April 2005 to perform at the China Club in Times Square for a TV themes concert. He was joined on stage by other singers of popular TV themes, including Gloria Loring, Greg Evigan, Gary Portnoy, David Pomeranz and David Naughton.

==Pop culture==
&quot;Believe It or Not&quot; was parodied on the season 8 episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, titled &quot;Susie&quot;, by Jason Alexander, playing his character George Costanza. George uses a version of the song as an outgoing answering message, with different lyrics (&quot;Believe it or not, George isn&#x27;t at home&quot;) and mistakes in the melodic line. Since Jason Alexander is a good singer in real life, he was told to sing as poorly as he could, after his first take of the song was judged too good to be funny.

==Discography==
Scarbury has released several singles starting in 1969 on Dunhill, followed by releases on Reena, Playboy, Bell, Columbia, RCA, Big Tree, Lionel, and Elektra labels.

<doc id="315183" wikidata="Q3304898" url="?curid=315183" title="Melanie Hamilton">
<text>Melanie Hamilton is a fictional character first appearing in the 1936 novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; by Margaret Mitchell. In the 1939 film she was portrayed by Olivia de Havilland. Melanie is Scarlett O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s sister-in-law and eventually her best friend. Mitchell likely based the character on her cousin Sister Mary Melanie Holliday.

==Biography==
Melanie was born in 1843 or 1844. She and her brother Charles are among the last members left of the wealthy Hamilton family. The family has always valued education and sought to provide its members with the finest available. As a result, they have gained a reputation for producing a fair number of intellectuals and several noted lawyers. For several generations they have intermarried with the like-minded Wilkes family. 

Melanie and Charles&#x27; parents die when their children are still young. Their father, Col. William R. Hamilton, was described as a hot-tempered, fiery soldier &quot;with a ramrod for a backbone&quot;. The two siblings are placed under the joint guardianship of Henry Hamilton and Sarah Jane &quot;Pittypat&quot; Hamilton, their father&#x27;s brother and sister. Neither Henry nor Pittypat are married and so they consider their nephew and niece as their children. Henry is a lawyer and resident of Atlanta and the family fortune has been placed under his management. Pittypat is described as having the maturity of a child herself. The one actually responsible for raising the two children is Uncle Peter, an African American slave. Peter is fiercely loyal to the Hamiltons and has served the orphans&#x27; father during his military service in the Mexican–American War.

Though the Hamiltons are nominally his masters, Peter views them more as his charges and acts as the protector of Pittypat, her niece and nephew throughout their lives. He is described as a brave and intelligent man who, in serving the interests of the Hamiltons, often advises his charges and on several occasions makes decisions for them. Thanks to their devoted uncles and aunt, the siblings grow to be well-educated and well-read young people, but due to their somewhat sheltered environment, they tend to be naive in worldly ways.

===1861===
In keeping with the family tradition, in April 1861, Melanie becomes engaged to her first cousin, Ashley Wilkes. Melanie is unaware that Scarlett O&#x27;Hara intended to marry Ashley. For Scarlett, the news is shocking. Nevertheless, she is present at the engagement celebration, along with her family and most other plantation owners of the county. According to her description, Melanie is a rather petite and delicate young woman with the height and weight of a child. Her most notable feature is a pair of large brown eyes. To Scarlett, she seems quite shy and sweet but not particularly beautiful. However, her way of movement is described as graceful beyond her years. To Scarlett, she seems more interested in discussing books than in flirting with men. While most young girls present at the celebration seek to impress the young men with their dress sense, Melanie is plainly clothed, discussing the works of William Makepeace Thackeray and Charles Dickens.

Scarlett is certain that Ashley will prefer her to Melanie. Confronting him privately, she confesses her love for him. Ashley admits he is attracted to her but he is determined to marry Melanie. His main stated reason is that he believes he has more in common with Melanie than with Scarlett. Scarlett feels disappointed and hurt. In her confusion she decides to hurt Ashley in return by accepting a marriage proposal by Melanie&#x27;s brother Charles. Scarlett also considers that she is taking revenge against Melanie by marrying her brother.

The wedding takes place two weeks later on April 30, 1861, but Melanie is actually pleased about the marriage as she views her new sister-in-law as a true sister. Melanie seems to take an instant liking to Scarlett and welcomes her to their family. On May 1, 1861, Melanie herself marries Ashley. Meanwhile, the American Civil War has broken out and Georgia is now part of the Confederate States of America. Charles has to leave two weeks after his marriage to enlist in the forces of Wade Hampton, known as &quot;Hampton&#x27;s Legion&quot;. A week later Ashley follows him. In his absence Melanie accepts the invitation of Aunt Pittypat to stay with her in Atlanta. The fortunes of both women are still under the management of Uncle Henry.

In Atlanta, Melanie receives two important pieces of news. Her brother has died less than two months after his enlistment, having contracted and recovered from the measles but then succumbing to pneumonia. His share of the family fortune is inherited by Scarlett, his widow. This sad news is followed by the news of Scarlett&#x27;s pregnancy. Melanie&#x27;s nephew is born by the end of the year and is named Wade Hampton Hamilton in honor of Charles&#x27;s leading general, as was the fashion in the South at the time.

Throughout the year both Melanie and her aunt send Scarlett several invitations to join them. Melanie expresses an interest in getting to know her &quot;sister&quot; better and later in seeing her nephew. On the other hand, Scarlett is going through a state of depression. Her mother is concerned about her and finally manages to convince her to accept the invitations. Following a short visit to maternal relatives in Savannah followed by Charleston, South Carolina, Scarlett and her son, accompanied by her maid, Prissy, arrive in Atlanta during the first months of 1862. She is welcomed by Uncle Peter, aging but still determined to take care of his new charges. He brings her to the house of her aunt and sister-in-law.

At first feeling awkward with the thought of living under the same roof with Ashley&#x27;s wife, Scarlett progressively regains her interest in life. Partly responsible for that is Melanie&#x27;s interest and affection towards her, though her occasional crushing hugs are hard for Scarlett to get used to. Melanie is serving as a volunteer nurse in the local hospital. Soon Scarlett joins her. Scarlett is somewhat impressed with Melanie&#x27;s ability to keep a straight face and a smile in the presence of the wounded and her willingness to help and comfort them. Even if some of the gravest wounds make her pale and even cause her to vomit privately, Melanie avoids letting others find out. Scarlett starts considering that her sister-in-law is braver than she appears. At the same time Melanie maintains correspondence with Ashley, and Scarlett is still interested in hearing of his activities.

Scarlett has come to Atlanta intending to stay for a short while and as a visitor, but soon she finds herself settled more permanently and one of Atlanta&#x27;s socialites. Melanie seems content with the new situation as Scarlett proves to be a better companion than their elderly aunt. At the time Atlanta is seemingly populated mostly by women, by men too old or too young to fight, and the wounded returning from the front. However, a number of men eligible to fight still remain in the city as part of the local militia. Melanie harshly criticizes their presence in the city, while more forces are needed at the front. Scarlett soon finds that, as passively as Melanie usually acts, she can become surprisingly passionate and even aggressive in support of her ideals.

===1862===
By the summer of 1862, Melanie and Scarlett have been re-acquainted to a man they met during Melanie&#x27;s engagement celebration: Captain Rhett Butler, at the time about 35 years old. Born to a respected family of Charleston, Rhett was disinherited by his father when he refused to marry according to the latter&#x27;s wishes. He has worked his way up and has made his own fortune in the California Gold Rush of 1849. He has gained wealth and success as a trader but he has a poor reputation. At the time he and his sailing ship have been smuggling supplies from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, France, and even the port of New York Harbor to the Confederacy.

Noted for his cynicism, Rhett observes that he has gained both in wealth and in appreciation by this practice. He seems to take an instant interest in befriending both young women and soon starts flirting with Scarlett. Though this provides a subject of gossip for the local society, Melanie seems to approve of both her friends and verbally defends their reputations.

===1863===
By early 1863 Rhett has established himself as a friend of both women and a frequent visitor to their house. To Melanie he seems a bitter man in need of a woman to comfort him. On the other hand, Scarlett shares much of his cynical view towards people and their ideas. Both women find some of his ideas disturbing but still thought-provoking. In discussion with patriots and idealists who think this is a just war, Rhett tends to point that all wars seem just to the soldiers fighting them, but that the leaders and orators guiding them to war tend to place themselves behind the lines and are more interested in monetary gain than ideals. Rhett also points out that those ideals are little more than a cover for the actual financial motivation behind wars. Rhett&#x27;s often stated beliefs have earned him a fair number of enemies, but Melanie and Scarlett are not among them as they also tend to question the motivations behind the war.

Generally less judgmental than most members of her social circle, Melanie is surprised when she is approached by Belle Watling, an affluent prostitute and owner of a local brothel. Belle has become well known in the local society and respected members of it frequent her brothel, but in public she usually finds herself isolated. Intending to contribute part of her weekly earnings as charity for the local hospital, Belle has found her offer being rejected. The idea is that money from such a source would be an insult to the heroic and wounded soldiers. Instead, Melanie accepts the offer. Melanie privately explains to Scarlett, who by this point has become her closest confidante, that in the process she risks her own reputation, but she reasons that the hospital needs any help it can get and that Belle&#x27;s intentions are noble in this case.

Meanwhile, Ashley has been serving in the Army of Northern Virginia and has been promoted to the rank of major. Having participated in a number of victorious battles, this army is steadily advancing towards the northern states under the orders of General Robert Edward Lee. On July 1, 1863, the army is engaged in battle against the Federals near the village of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Battle of Gettysburg lasted until July 3 and ends in the defeat and retreat of the Confederates. The news of the battle reach Atlanta early but both the outcome and the fates of many of the soldiers remain uncertain for some time after. Many wait to learn news of their relatives and friends. Melanie and Scarlett have a personal interest in the fate of Ashley, whom they both love. When the first lists of casualties reaches Atlanta, both are relieved not to find Ashley among them. But their relief is soon followed by grief as, not surprisingly, Melanie, Scarlett and every resident of Atlanta find many of their acquaintances to be included in the lists. As well, several additions to the lists follow. The battle has been the first major defeat of the Confederates and is considered to have turned the tide of the war.

On December 20, 1863, Ashley returns home. He has received a week-long leave, and it is the first time Melanie and Scarlett have seen him in about two years. The weary soldier is met with the joy and affection of both women and seems to return it. Before leaving to rejoin his unit, Ashley explains to Scarlett his worries about his wife&#x27;s current health and her fate in case he falls in battle. Ashley meets Scarlett with the specific request to look and care after Melanie in his absence. Scarlett is at first taken by surprise but she agrees. Scarlett accepts Melanie as her new charge and for the first time feels responsible for her sister-in-law and rival in love&#x27;s health and care. Melanie is left blissfully unaware of the feelings her husband and &quot;sister&quot; have for each other and the latter&#x27;s new responsibility towards herself.

===1864===
Melanie is three months pregnant of Ashley&#x27;s child in March 1864. Melanie has wanted a child for some time and already acted as a second mother to her nephew Wade. She is glad for the chance to have her own child. Melanie announces the news to Scarlett as soon as she is certain. She expects her friend to share her joy. Having lost her mother years ago, Melanie also seems to expect Scarlett to assume the role of the experienced woman advising her on her pregnancy. Instead Scarlett reacts in surprise, confusion and even anger to finding Melanie pregnant with Ashley&#x27;s child. Melanie is unable to grasp the reasons for this reaction but fears that she has somehow hurt her friend. Melanie is also met with the fears of the doctor examining her. According to his examination, Melanie&#x27;s hip bone seems to be too narrow to safely allow her to give birth. In any case Melanie receives a telegram from Ashley&#x27;s superior officer explaining that her husband has been reported as missing in action for the last three days. Melanie finds herself believed to be a widow.

Turning to each other for comfort, Melanie and Scarlett reconcile. They spend that night crying in each other&#x27;s arms. But the news of Ashley&#x27;s death prove to have been premature. Another report informs the two women that efforts to recover his body have failed and that he is considered likely to have been captured by enemy forces. Anxious over her husband&#x27;s uncertain fate, Melanie grows restless for some time. Even late at night Scarlett can hear Melanie pacing her bedroom back and forth, apparently suffering from insomnia. This practice gradually exhausts her health and at one point she even passes out in public, an unusual incident for her. Fortunately for Melanie, Rhett happens to be near and returns her home safely. Rhett is worried about her, and ascertaining the reasons behind her current state, he promises to use his connections in Washington, D.C., to find out whether Major Wilkes has been captured or not. In exchange, Rhett asks Melanie to promise him that she will try to get some rest.

A month later Rhett informs Melanie and Scarlett what has happened to Ashley: he has been wounded in conflict, captured, and is being held in a prisoner camp in Rock Island, Illinois. The women receive the news with mixed feelings. Their loved one is still alive but for how long is questionable. Rock Island&#x27;s reputation among the Confederates was no better than that of Andersonville among the Federals; only one quarter of the prisoners held there have ever returned home. The rest die from smallpox, pneumonia and typhus, among other diseases.

Melanie&#x27;s pregnancy continues even though her health is frail. She is put on bed rest for most of the third trimester of her pregnancy. General William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s troops begin to approach Atlanta. Because of this, Aunt Pittypat and Uncle Peter flee to relatives in Macon, Georgia, and Melanie is left in Scarlett&#x27;s care. A short while later, Melanie goes into labor. At this time, however, General Sherman is beginning to wage battle with the Home Guard. Scarlett sends her slave, Prissy, to find help, but is unable to find any for various reasons. Scarlett and Prissy are then left no choice but to deliver Melanie&#x27;s baby themselves. The delivery is very difficult due to Melanie&#x27;s health and small build. As Scarlett did, Melanie names her son Beauregard, or Beau for short, after Ashley&#x27;s leading general, Pierre Beauregard.

After her son is born, Melanie and Scarlett make a difficult, dangerous journey to Scarlett&#x27;s home Tara. There, Melanie, Beau, Scarlett, and Wade live with Scarlet&#x27;s father, two sisters, and few remaining house slaves. They face much hardship, living in near-constant starvation.

===1865 and later===
After a few months&#x27; time, the war finally comes to an end. Eventually, Ashley returns to Tara and Melanie is overjoyed.

Soon, Scarlett remarries her sister&#x27;s fiancé Frank Kennedy and moves to Atlanta. The Wilkeses move there also with their little boy after Melanie persuades Ashley to help Scarlett start a lumber business. After Frank&#x27;s accidental death (attributed to Scarlett&#x27;s controversial business practices), Scarlett marries Rhett Butler.

Melanie becomes a social pillar of Atlanta, known for her charity and kindness. She even takes in an old convict, Archie. He, along with India Wilkes, witness Scarlett&#x27;s embrace with Ashley one day at the mill. Melanie refuses to believe the rumors that there is anything wrong between her husband and &#x27;sister&#x27;, and saves Scarlett&#x27;s reputation by graciously asking her to co-hostess Ashley&#x27;s birthday party that night.

Melanie and Rhett continue to have a good relationship, even as his and Scarlett&#x27;s marriage falls apart. Rhett says Melanie is one of the few real ladies he&#x27;s ever known. After Scarlett falls down the stairs and miscarries, Melanie comforts Rhett, who in a drunken state, cries on her lap, lamenting that his wife never loved him. He almost reveals that Scarlett has long been in love with Ashley before he realizes who he&#x27;s talking to. He subsequently gives up his feelings for Scarlett and focuses his attentions on their daughter Bonnie, who later dies in a riding accident. It is Melanie that convinces the grief-stricken Rhett to allow them to bury Bonnie after her death.

In 1873, Melanie becomes pregnant again, although Dr. Meade had specifically warned her against it. First being overjoyed, she soon weakens considerably after a miscarriage and calls Scarlett to her. Melanie tells her how much she&#x27;s loved her, asks her to take care of Beau and of Ashley, and speaks her last words, which involve Rhett Butler and his intense love for Scarlett. Melanie&#x27;s death serves as a catalyst for the final phase of Scarlett&#x27;s character growth in the book. Scarlett mourns Melanie&#x27;s death, and unselfishly thanks God for not allowing the dead woman to know about Ashley&#x27;s emotional involvement with herself.

===Portrayal and relationship with Scarlett===

Melanie is the stereotypical southern belle, embodying the femininity and grace idealized by antebellum American Southern culture. During the post-war, society rewards her for her female virtues by making her an unassailable social pillar, and lauding her as a &quot;true lady&quot;. She is universally admired by all of the characters for her selfless goodness, though Scarlett occasionally derides her naivety.

The character of Melanie is a direct foil to that of Scarlett, and their deep &#x27;sisterhood&#x27; seems odd to outsiders, who often assume it is Melanie&#x27;s grace which allows her to be friends with the abrasive Scarlett long after the bounds of Scarlett&#x27;s first marriage to Melanie&#x27;s brother ended. But Melanie has always had deep admiration for Scarlett&#x27;s spirit and strength, and her courage in saving her and newborn Beau has made Melanie eternally and unshakably grateful to Scarlett.

Melanie is a well-pedigreed member of the Southern aristocracy from a well-known and established family. She is known for her selfless charity, unending kindness, and delicacy. Melanie&#x27;s physical weakness, likely caused by generations of inbreeding between like-pedigreed cousins, is her downfall, as she is frequently ill and sickly. Her husband, Ashley, is her twin, representing the ideal Southern gentleman, and mirroring her background and constitution.

In contrast, Scarlett is a &#x27;mutt&#x27; of French and Irish heritage, and only a second-generation member of the plantation owners. During the time period, the Irish were of nearly the same social standing as black Americans, and Scarlett&#x27;s Irish father gained Tara in a hand of poker. Physically, Scarlett is ferocious in survival, caustic in her relations, and has a sturdy physical constitution that enables her to endure most hardship, being rarely ill.

While Melanie is praised as being the embodiment of the ideal Southern woman, Melanie&#x27;s literal survival through the war and after is reliant on the &#x27;mutt&#x27; Scarlett and Scarlett&#x27;s breaking of societal rules. During the war, Scarlett is the one to provide the necessary strength to keep them going through starvation and violence, while delicate Melanie must rely on her. Scarlett&#x27;s willingness to behave outside of the boundaries placed on women, such as killing soldiers, eating scraps, and seducing her sister&#x27;s beau for money, ensure the continued survival of Melanie and Scarlett&#x27;s family.

Even after the war, Melanie&#x27;s survival and position as a Southern matron is reliant on Scarlett&#x27;s disregard for social niceties, as it is Scarlett&#x27;s profitable lumber mill and shops which provide Melanie&#x27;s husband, Ashley, with an income and position. Without the job Scarlett provides, Ashley, and therefore Melanie, would be unable to remain in the South and continue their culture. 
As a result of Scarlett protecting Melanie during trials, Melanie admires and protects Scarlett as she can in social settings.

Melanie being placed on a pillar by Southern society can be viewed as their worship of the time and standards of the past, with the rejection of Scarlett being the rejection of the Southern post-war reality&#x27;s need for practical survival. Melanie&#x27;s fading and eventual death reflect the permanent loss of the pre-war glory, and Scarlett&#x27;s final rejection of Melanie&#x27;s husband indicate that the South is ready to move on from the past.

<doc id="315185" wikidata="Q1247790" url="?curid=315185" title="Redwall">
<text>Redwall is a series of children&#x27;s fantasy novels by British writer Brian Jacques, published from 1986 to 2011. It is also the title of the first book of the series, published in 1986, as well as the name of the abbey featured in the book, and is the name of an animated television series based on three of the novels (&quot;Redwall&quot;, &quot;Mattimeo&quot;, and &quot;Martin the Warrior&quot;), which first aired in 1999. The books are primarily aimed at pre- to early adolescents. There have been 22 novels and two picture books published. The twenty-second, and final, novel, &quot;The Rogue Crew&quot;, was posthumously released on 3 May 2011, almost three months after Jacques&#x27; death on 5 February.

==Overview==
The series chronicles the adventures of the anthropomorphic animals inhabiting Redwall Abbey and the surrounding countryside of Mossflower Wood, including mice, moles, hares, badgers, and other woodland species. Frequently the peace-loving creatures of Mossflower are called upon to become warriors to defend themselves from marauding bands of &quot;vermin&quot; such as rats, weasels, and foxes.

The novels in the series are set in many periods in the fictional history of Redwall and Mossflower; the chronological order of the stories is not the same as the order in which they were written, some taking place before the construction of Redwall Abbey itself or in far-flung locations beyond Mossflower. Some of the books focus on characters who, in other volumes, are legendary historical figures, such as &quot;The Legend of Luke&quot;. Because of the widely spaced storylines, very few characters are mentioned in more than one or two novels. One notable exception is Martin the Warrior, one of the founders of Redwall Abbey, whose adventures are chronicled in several of the novels and who is frequently mentioned as an icon of heroism who inspires later Redwall denizens, occasionally appearing to them as a spiritual vision.

Despite the changing historical setting and absence of recurring characters, familiar character archetypes recur throughout the books, often characters in tribe-specific leadership roles, such the Badger Lords, the Skipper of Otters, or the shrew tribe leader &quot;Log-a-Log&quot;. Other recurring elements include &quot;Dibbuns&quot; (the Redwall name for infant woodlanders) and detailed descriptions of food.

Although the main setting is an abbey, and several characters are referred to as monks, friars, etc., the series makes little mention of religious beliefs or practices. Early novels establish a St. Ninian&#x27;s church near Redwall Abbey, but a later novel portrays that as a misnomer for a building that was never a church.

The &quot;Redwall&quot; novels are characterized as fantasy, but contain little in the way of magic or the supernatural, apart from the anthropomorphism of the animal characters. The sword of Martin the Warrior is believed by many characters to be magical, and vermin occasionally try to steal it for this reason; &quot;Mossflower&quot; reveals that it was forged from a fragment of a meteorite at the volcanic fortress Salamandastron by the Badger Lord known as Boar the Fighter. The role of &quot;monsters&quot; in the novels is played not by mythical creatures, but by real-world predators such as adders, sharks, and wolverines.

==Books==

At the time of Jacques&#x27; death, twenty-one novels had been released. &quot;The Sable Quean&quot; was released in February 2010. The twenty-second and (because of his death) final book, &quot;The Rogue Crew&quot;, was released on 3 May 2011.

The prequels to &quot;Redwall&quot; are not released in any chronological order. The sequels, including &quot;Mattimeo&quot;, were released in the order in which they occur. The books are listed below in their chronological order within the fictional world of Redwall, with publication dates noted.

The first three chronologically ordered books (&quot;Lord Brocktree&quot;, &quot;Martin the Warrior&quot;, and &quot;Mossflower&quot;) take place before the construction of Redwall Abbey, while the fourth, &quot;The Legend of Luke&quot;, takes place during its construction. Many of the books that take place before Redwall was constructed are told via a framing device.

Most books adjacent to each other in chronological order take place within a generation or so of each other, as evidenced by mentions of past characters in the later books. &quot;Redwall&quot; and &quot;Mattimeo&quot; as well as &quot;Mariel of Redwall&quot; and &quot;The Bellmaker&quot; feature the same cast, with a short span of time between them. From &quot;Triss&quot; onward, however, they take place so far apart in time that none share any characters with other books anymore.

==Characters==
In the Redwall universe, species almost invariably (with very few exceptions, including change of character mid-story) determines a creature&#x27;s nature, whether good or evil. Some common noble species in Redwall include mice, otters, moles, hares, squirrels, hedgehogs, shrews, birds, voles, and badgers, while common vermin include rats, foxes, weasels, ferrets, ravens, snakes, stoats, ermine, sables, wildcats, magpies, rooks, and crows. Snakes (who are mostly Adders) in Redwall, despite being evil, are more like a third party, for they feast on good and evil species alike. However, many other varieties of species also make appearances throughout the novels as well. Dormice also appear sometimes but are rarely major characters. On numerous occasions it mentions seals, whose language makes little sense to other creatures; also bank voles on numerous occasions, usually as a &quot;good&quot; character but once as an evil character. Twice, in &quot;Mattimeo&quot; and &quot;Loamhedge&quot;, there is a creature, apparently half weasel and half ferret, called a Wearet, while the book &quot;The Rogue Crew&quot; features a (purportedly) half-weasel and half-rat Wearat as its principal villain. Pine martens have been featured in three books, once as the main villain and twice in the service of a wildcat. Several reptiles are also mentioned, such as adders, other snakes, and lizards. Amphibians like toads and frogs have been featured also, and are depicted as lower creatures that live in more basic tribal systems and usually serve not as the primary villains but as secondary distractions to heroes. Pikes can be found throughout the books, inhabiting rivers, and also acting as a secondary distraction. Sharks have been known to attack ships; one instance can be found in &quot;Triss&quot;. There are also some creatures that have only been mentioned once or twice (e.g., wolf, beaver, turtle, whale, wolverine, sable, tortoise, golden hamster, bats, monitor lizards, polecats, and in the first book horses, pigs, dogs and cows). Crows and other &quot;Corvus&quot; birds also appear on numerous occasions, usually being vicious and territorial. Other birds such as owls, herons, red-tailed hawks, and eagles are mentioned, some having major parts in books, including in &quot;Mattimeo&quot; when a raven named General Ironbeak manages to invade and almost conquers Redwall Abbey with his army of rooks. In &quot;Martin the Warrior&quot;, a group of squirrels called the Gawtrybe are presented as villains, though squirrels are usually considered &quot;good&quot; and the Gawtrybe end up aiding the heroes during the final battle.

==Locations==
The books are centered around Redwall Abbey, a red sandstone abbey built after the events of &quot;Mossflower&quot;. It is home to many of the good animals of Mossflower Woods. Also important is the mountain fortress called Salamandastron, home to the Badger Lords and the famed hares of the Long Patrol, the mountain&#x27;s army. There are many other places, such as the fortress Riftgard, Loamhedge, and Green Isle. Also, a main waterway is the River Moss. Other stories, like &quot;The Bellmaker&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Luke&quot;, most of the story takes place onboard sailing ships and many dangers are only those involving the weather and damage resulting from such.

There are also the far northern lands; much of the wildlife in the books from those lands are those native to Scotland specifically, such as pine martens and golden eagles. As well as the northern lands, there are islands featured in the series; usually, each island is featured in one book only.

==Literary significance and reception==
Brian Jacques was praised for his &quot;Redwall&quot; series. He was called one of &quot;the best children&#x27;s authors in the world&quot;. The books of the &quot;Redwall&quot; series have drawn comparisons to J. R. R. Tolkien’s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, to Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, and Richard Adams&#x27;s &quot;Watership Down&quot;. Jacques combines &quot;action, poetry, songs, courage, and vivid descriptions&quot; to create a unique style that spans the series.

The &quot;Redwall&quot; series has received praise for its &quot;equal-opportunity adventuring, in which female creatures can be just as courageous (or as diabolical) as their male counterparts&quot;. Novels such as &quot;Mariel of Redwall&quot;, &quot;Pearls of Lutra&quot;, &quot;High Rhulain&quot; and &quot;Triss&quot; all feature strong female leading characters. Jacques has also received acclaim for his development of unique language intrinsic to certain species, giving the novels an &quot;endearing dialectal dialogue&quot;.

Some reviews have been critical of the &quot;Redwall&quot; novels for providing too simplistic a view of good and evil. The characteristics of the animals in the novels are fixed by their species, making them quite &quot;predictable&quot;, though there have been a few books, such as in &quot;Outcast of Redwall&quot; and &quot;Pearls of Lutra&quot;, in which vermin have acted selflessly, in one taking a spear through the chest and back meant for his former nursemaid (though she disregards his actions as impulse and comes to consider him born to be evil), and in the other saving the Abbot of Redwall from lizards. Another exception is in &quot;The Bellmaker&quot;, where a searat strove to start being good instead of evil, abandoning his life of pirating to live by himself. In some cases, different members of the same species possess different moral compasses. For example, the wildcats in the book &quot;Mossflower&quot; each exhibit different characteristics: although Lady Tsarmina is cruel and vicious, her father Lord Verdauga is seen as hard but fair, and her brother Gingivere is kind and eventually joins the side of the woodlanders. As a general rule though, characters tend to &quot;epitomize their class origins&quot;, rarely rising above them.

Many reviewers have also criticized the &quot;Redwall&quot; series for repetition and predictability, citing &quot;recycled&quot; plot lines and Jacques&#x27; tendency to follow a &quot;pattern to the dot&quot;. Other reviewers note that such predictable &quot;ingredients&quot; may be what &quot;makes the &quot;Redwall&quot; recipe so consistently popular&quot;. Although the series did not continue to break new ground, it does provide satisfying adventures with &quot;comforting, predictable conclusions for its fans&quot;.

==Illustrators==

The last interior artist was Sean Rubin. Prior to Rubin taking over in 2009, David Elliot illustrated six books in the Redwall series, including &quot;Eulalia!&quot;, published in 2007. Elliot also illustrated the anniversary edition of &quot;Mossflower&quot;, with full page illustrations. Other previous interior illustrators include Gary Chalk (&quot;Redwall&quot;, &quot;Mariel of Redwall&quot;, and &quot;Martin the Warrior&quot;), Allan Curless (&quot;The Bellmaker&quot; to &quot;The Long Patrol&quot;), Chris Baker (&quot;Marlfox&quot; to &quot;Lord Brocktree&quot;) and Peter Standley (&quot;The Taggerung&quot;). The cover artist of the US editions of the novels is Troy Howell. Pete Lyon and Douglas Hall provided cover art for different UK editions of the first four books. Later, Chris Baker became the UK cover artist up until the release of &quot;Triss&quot;, when David Wyatt took over.

==Adaptations==

===International editions===

Books in the Redwall series have been translated into Arabic, Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Latvian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, and Swedish.

===Television series and films===

The first season of the &quot;Redwall&quot; television series, released in 1999, was based upon the novel &quot;Redwall&quot;. It was later followed by two more seasons, based on the books &quot;Mattimeo&quot; and &quot;Martin the Warrior&quot;. Each season contained 13 episodes. Each episode was opened with Brian Jacques himself giving a synopsis of the story so far. These scenes were later cut from subsequent re-airings and DVD releases.

In February 2021, Netflix acquired full adaptation rights to the novel series. A feature film based on the novel &quot;Redwall&quot; and an animated &quot;event series&quot; based on the character Martin the Warrior are in the works for the streaming platform. Patrick McHale, creator of &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot;, was writing the film&#x27;s script. Due to changes at Netflix in December 2022, however, McHale is no longer working on the feature film.

===Audiobooks===

There have been full-length audiobooks published of most of the &quot;Redwall&quot; books, the exceptions being &quot;The Pearls of Lutra&quot;, &quot;Marlfox&quot;, &quot;Lord Brocktree&quot; (on cassette), &quot;The Legend of Luke&quot;, and &quot;The Rogue Crew&quot;. Instead of being read by a single actor, the novels are narrated by a large cast. Brian Jacques served as the narrator for almost all of the audiobooks (with &quot;Salamandastron&quot; being the sole exception), sometimes reading select parts, and his son Marc Jacques appeared as the characters Matthias, Martin and others. The audiobooks also feature fully-realized musical performances of the songs that each book contains, composed and performed by Billy Maher.

Some abridged audiobooks have also been released. They include &quot;Redwall&quot;, &quot;Mossflower&quot;, &quot;Pearls of Lutra&quot;, &quot;The Long Patrol&quot;, &quot;Marlfox&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Luke&quot; and &quot;Lord Brocktree&quot;. Each is three hours in length and read solely by Brian Jacques or another narrator.

===Opera===

In 1996, Evelyn Swenson composed an opera based on the first book in the Redwall series. It was produced by OperaDelaware in Wilmington, Delaware and later toured Europe.

===Games===
There are currently two officially-licensed video games based on the Redwall series. Both games were created by Soma Games under the banner of &quot;The Lost Legends of Redwall&quot;.

<text>Michael Peter Hayes (20 June 1938 – 30 May 2003), known as Mickie Most, was an English record producer behind acts such as the Animals, Herman&#x27;s Hermits, the Nashville Teens, Donovan, Lulu, Suzi Quatro, Hot Chocolate, Arrows, Racey and the Jeff Beck Group, often issued on his own RAK Records label.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Most was born as Michael Peter Hayes in Aldershot, Hampshire, England. The son of a regimental sergeant-major, he moved with his parents to Harrow, Middlesex in 1951. He was influenced by skiffle and early rock and roll in his youth. Leaving school at 15, he worked as a singing waiter at London&#x27;s The 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar where he made friends with future business partner Peter Grant, and formed a singing duo with Alex Wharton (aka Alex Murray) who billed themselves as the Most Brothers. They recorded the single &quot;Takes A Whole Lotta Loving to Keep My Baby Happy&quot; with Decca Records before disbanding. Wharton later went on to produce the Moody Blues single &quot;Go Now&quot;.

After changing his name to Mickie Most in 1959, he travelled to South Africa with his wife Christina, and formed a pop group, Mickie Most and His Playboys. The band had eleven consecutive No. 1 singles there, mostly with cover versions of Ray Peterson, Gene Vincent, Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran songs. Returning to London in 1962, Most appeared on package tours as well as recording &quot;Mister Porter&quot;, a No. 45 hit in the UK Singles Chart in July 1963 and had moderate success with &quot;The Feminine Look&quot; in 1963, this single featuring Jimmy Page on lead guitar and heralding early British heavy rock.

===Producer===
Becoming tired of touring clubs, Most decided to concentrate on other aspects of the music industry. His first job was selling records in stores and displaying them on racks (later inspiration for his record label, RAK) before finding a niche with production for Columbia Records. After spotting The Animals at Newcastle&#x27;s Club A-Go-Go, he offered to produce their first single, &quot;Baby Let Me Take You Home&quot;, which reached No. 21 in the UK Singles Chart. Their follow-up 1964 single, &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;, became an international hit.

Most had success with Herman&#x27;s Hermits after being approached by their manager Harvey Lisberg at Derek Everett&#x27;s suggestion. Their first Most production, &quot;I&#x27;m into Something Good&quot;, went to No. 1 in September 1964, beginning a run of single and album sales (ten million over 12 months), the group for a time challenging The Beatles in popularity in the United States. His down-to-earth handling of the band, his business acumen and knack for selecting hit singles, established Most as one of the most successful producers in Britain and kept him in demand throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

In July 1964, Most had another top 10 hit with the Nashville Teens&#x27; remake of the John D. Loudermilk song &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;. In September 1964, with Most at the control board, Brenda Lee recorded &quot;Is It True&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot;. &quot;Is It True&quot; was released in England and later in the US, and it became a hit and a gold record. &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; became another hit throughout Europe but was never released in the US. Most had equal success with other artists for whom he produced chart-topping albums and singles between 1964 and 1969, notably Donovan with &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot;, &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot;, &quot;Jennifer Juniper&quot;, and Lulu&#x27;s hits &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot;, &quot;The Boat That I Row&quot;, &quot;Boom Bang-a-Bang&quot; (which finished equal first in the 1969 Eurovision Song Contest), &quot;Me the Peaceful Heart&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m a Tiger&quot;. Most also produced the final studio single of the 1960s by The Seekers, &quot;Days of My Life&quot;, in 1968, and Nancy Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;The Highway Song&quot; in 1969. Additionally in the 1960s, Most signed and produced artists such as singer-guitarist Terry Reid, and all-girl rock band The She Trinity.

Most&#x27;s productions were backed by London-based session musicians including Big Jim Sullivan and Jimmy Page on guitar, John Paul Jones on bass guitar and arrangements, Nicky Hopkins on piano, and Bobby Graham on drums. He produced Jeff Beck&#x27;s hits &quot;Love is Blue&quot; and &quot;Hi Ho Silver Lining&quot; and the Jeff Beck Group albums &quot;Truth&quot; and &quot;Beck-Ola&quot;. By 1967, after commercial and critical failure of The Yardbirds album &quot;Little Games&quot;, he decided to steer clear of rock groups. The Yardbirds objected to his insistence that every song be cut to three minutes and that albums were an afterthought following the singles. His focused approach also led to a split with Donovan in late 1969. Most and Donovan reunited in 1973 for the album &quot;Cosmic Wheels&quot; on which Most was credited under his real name, Michael Peter Hayes.

===From 1968 to 1983===
Despite these setbacks, Most set up his own production office at 155 Oxford Street, sharing it with his business partner Peter Grant. It was through Most&#x27;s association that Grant was asked to manage The Yardbirds. In 1968, Most and Grant set up RAK Management, but Grant&#x27;s involvement with The New Yardbirds, which soon evolved into Led Zeppelin, meant Most had control in late 1969. RAK Records and RAK Music Publishing were launched in 1969. RAK Music Publishing has the copyright of popular songs such as &quot;You Sexy Thing&quot; composed by Hot Chocolate singer Errol Brown and a half interest in the song &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; written by Alan Merrill and Jake Hooker of the band Arrows.

With RAK Records, Most&#x27;s success continued with folk singer Julie Felix&#x27;s charting cover of Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot;. Felix was the first artist signed to the label. Most then produced Mary Hopkin&#x27;s 1970 hit &quot;Temma Harbour&quot; for Apple Records, followed by her Eurovision Song Contest entry, &quot;Knock, Knock Who&#x27;s There?&quot;. In 1970, Most approached Suzi Quatro for a recording contract after seeing her on stage at a Detroit dance hall with the band Cradle (which also had Quatro&#x27;s sisters Arlene, Patti, and Nancy as members), while on a production assignment in Chicago. Quatro was among a growing roster of artists signed to RAK Records which included Alexis Korner&#x27;s CCS, Arrows, Smokie (with Chris Norman) (originally spelt Smokey), Hot Chocolate, Angie Miller, Chris Spedding, and Heavy Metal Kids. Hiring the songwriting production team of Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, RAK scored several British number 1 singles with Suzi Quatro (&quot;Can the Can&quot; and &quot;Devil Gate Drive&quot;) and Mud (&quot;Tiger Feet&quot;, &quot;Lonely This Christmas&quot; and &quot;Oh Boy&quot;).

For RAK in the 1970s, Most also produced hits for New World, Duncan Browne, Cozy Powell, Tam White and Racey, as well as Chris Spedding&#x27;s self-titled 1976 album, which was Spedding&#x27;s fifth solo record. He also produced &quot;We Vibrate&quot;, the first 45 by punk band The Vibrators. In 1980, Most discovered Kim Wilde, who was doing backing vocals for her father Marty Wilde at a Luton recording session. After hearing her, Most signed Wilde who immediately scored a hit with the single &quot;Kids in America&quot; which reached number 2 in the UK, and number 25 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. In the 1980s, the band Johnny Hates Jazz, which featured Most&#x27;s son Calvin Hayes, was also signed to RAK Records.

In the 1970s, Most was a panellist on the ITV talent show &quot;New Faces&quot; and, along with fellow record producer Tony Hatch, became known for his harsh comments on the acts performing on the show. He was a producer of &quot;Revolver&quot;, a TV programme devoted to punk rock which was at odds with his &#x27;studio factory&#x27; approach to pop music.

===Later career===
RAK sold out to EMI in 1983 but was revived in 1988. Most was one of the first producers to own the rights to his own records and RAK Studios, which opened in 1976 in St John&#x27;s Wood, remains active.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1981 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at BBC Broadcasting House in London.

In 1995, Most&#x27;s fortune was estimated at £50 million and he appeared in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; annual Rich List among the Top 500 in England. His house, Montebello, in Totteridge Lane, London, was claimed to be the largest private home in the UK, worth an estimated £4 million. His production work diminished after he was diagnosed with cancer in 2000.

===Death===
On 30 May 2003, Most died at home aged 64 from possibly peritoneal mesothelioma, a complication of asbestosis. The investigative journalist Paul Foot thought it was probable that he contracted the cancer from ingesting fibres from vinyl tiles impregnated with asbestos, intended to improve soundproofing in recording studios. A blue plaque, to commemorate his life, donated by the Heritage Foundation/Musical Heritage, was unveiled at RAK Studios on 16 May 2004. The lunch and auction that followed raised £40,000 for research into mesothelioma.

<text>Babbitt (1922), by Sinclair Lewis, is a satirical novel about American culture and society that critiques the vacuity of middle class life and the social pressure toward conformity. The controversy provoked by &quot;Babbitt&quot; was influential in the decision to award the Nobel Prize in Literature to Lewis in 1930. The novel has been filmed twice, once as a silent in 1924 and remade as a talkie in 1934.

The word &quot;Babbitt&quot; has entered the English language as a &quot;person and especially a business or professional man who conforms unthinkingly to prevailing middle-class standards&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;The Smart Set&quot;″s review of the novel stated, &quot;There is no plot whatever... Babbitt simply grows two years older as the tale unfolds.&quot;

The first seven chapters follow George F. Babbitt&#x27;s life over the course of a single day. Over breakfast, Babbitt, a successful real estate broker, dotes on his ten-year-old daughter Tinka, tries to dissuade his 22-year-old daughter Verona from her newfound socialist leanings, and encourages his 17-year-old son Ted to try harder in school. At the office he dictates letters and discusses real estate advertising with his employees. Gradually, Babbitt realizes his dissatisfaction with &quot;The American Dream&quot;, and attempts to quell these feelings by going camping in Maine with his close friend and old college roommate Paul Riesling. Although the trip has its ups and downs, the two men consider it an overall success and leave feeling optimistic about the year ahead.

On the day Babbitt gets elected vice-president of the Booster&#x27;s club, he finds out that Paul shot his wife Zilla. Babbitt immediately drives to the jail where Paul is being held, trying to think of ways to help Paul out. Shortly after Paul&#x27;s arrest, Babbitt&#x27;s wife and daughter go to visit relatives, leaving Babbitt more or less on his own. Babbitt begins to ask himself what it was he really wanted in life. In time, Babbitt begins to rebel against all of the standards he formerly held: he jumps into liberal politics with famous socialist/&quot;single tax&quot; litigator Seneca Doane, conducts an extramarital affair, goes on various vacations, and cavorts around Zenith with bohemians and flappers. He slowly becomes aware that his forays into nonconformity are not only futile but also destructive of the life and the friends he once loved.

When Babbitt&#x27;s wife falls ill with acute appendicitis, Babbitt rushes home and relinquishes all rebellion. During her long recovery, they rekindle their intimacy and Babbitt reverts to dispassionate conformity. In the final scene, Babbitt discovers that his son Ted has secretly married Eunice, the daughter of his neighbor. He offers his approval of the marriage, stating that though he does not agree, he admires Ted for living his life on his own terms.

==Setting==
Zenith is a fictitious city in the equally fictitious Midwestern state of &quot;Winnemac&quot;, adjacent to Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan. (&quot;Babbitt&quot; does not mention Winnemac by name, but Lewis&#x27;s subsequent novel &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; elaborates on its location.) When &quot;Babbitt&quot; was published, newspapers in Cincinnati, Duluth, Kansas City, Milwaukee, and Minneapolis each claimed that their city was the model for Zenith. Cincinnati had perhaps the strongest claim, as Lewis had lived there while researching the book. Lewis&#x27;s own correspondence suggests, however, that Zenith is meant to be any Midwestern city with a population between about 200,000 and 300,000.

Lewis was highly critical of the similarities among most American cities, especially when compared to the diverse—and in his view, culturally richer—cities of Europe. Frowning on the interchangeable qualities of American cities, he wrote: &quot;it would not be possible to write a novel which would in every line be equally true to Munich and Florence.&quot;

While conducting research for &quot;Babbitt&quot;, Lewis kept detailed journals, in which he drafted long biographies for each of his characters. For his title character this biography even included a detailed genealogy, as well as a list of Babbitt&#x27;s college courses. Zenith&#x27;s major names and families are documented in these journals, and many of them emerge again in Lewis&#x27;s later writings. Zenith&#x27;s layout is also imagined in careful detail. Lewis drew a series of 18 maps of Zenith and outlying areas, including Babbitt&#x27;s house, with all its furnishings.

==Themes==
===Business and the middle class===

After the social instability and sharp economic depression that followed World War I, many Americans in the 1920s saw business and city growth as foundations for stability. The civic boosters and self-made men of the middle-class represented particularly American depictions of success, at a time when the promotion of the American identity was crucial in the face of rising fears of Communism. At the same time, growing Midwestern cities, usually associated with mass production and the emergence of a consumer society, were also seen as emblems of American progress. George F. Babbitt, the novel&#x27;s main character, was described by the 1930 Nobel Prize committee as &quot;the ideal of an American popular hero of the middle-class. The relativity of business morals as well as private rules of conduct is for him an accepted article of faith, and without hesitation he considers it God&#x27;s purpose that man should work, increase his income, and enjoy modern improvements.&quot;

To his publisher, Lewis wrote: “[George Babbitt] is all of us Americans at 46, prosperous, but worried, wanting — passionately — to seize something more than motor cars and a house &quot;before it&#x27;s too late&quot;.” About the novel, Lewis said: “This is the story of the ruler of America” wherein the “tired American Businessman” wielded socioeconomic power not through his exceptionality but rather through militant conformity. Lewis portrayed the American businessman as a man deeply dissatisfied with and privately aware of his shortcomings; he is “the most grievous victim of his own militant dullness” who secretly longed for freedom and romance. Readers who praised the psychological realism of the portrait admitted to regularly encountering Babbitts in real life but also could relate to some of the character&#x27;s anxieties about conformity and personal fulfillment. Published two years after Lewis&#x27;s previous novel (&quot;Main Street&quot;, 1920), the story of George F. Babbitt was much anticipated because each novel presented a portrait of American society wherein “the principal character is brought into conflict with the accepted order of things, sufficiently to illustrate its ruthlessness.”

===Social change===
Although many other popular novelists writing at the time of &quot;Babbitt&quot;&#x27;s publication depict the &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot; as an era of social change and disillusionment with material culture, modern scholars argue that Lewis was not himself a member of the &quot;lost generation&quot; of younger writers like Ernest Hemingway or F. Scott Fitzgerald. Instead, he was influenced by the Progressive Era; and changes in the American identity that accompanied the country&#x27;s rapid urbanization, technological growth, industrialization, and the closing of the frontier. Although the Progressive Era had built a protective barrier around the upstanding American businessman, one literary scholar wrote that &quot;Lewis was fortunate enough to come on the scene just as the emperor&#x27;s clothes were disappearing.&quot; Lewis has been compared to many authors, writing before and after the publication of &quot;Babbitt&quot;, who made similar criticisms of the middle class. Although it was published in 1899, long before &quot;Babbitt&quot;, Thorstein Veblen&#x27;s &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;, which critiqued consumer culture and social competition at the turn of the 20th century, is an oft-cited point of comparison. Written decades later, in 1950, David Riesman&#x27;s &quot;The Lonely Crowd&quot; has also been compared to Lewis&#x27;s writings.

==Critical reception==
The social critic and satirist H. L. Mencken, an ardent supporter of Sinclair Lewis, called himself “an old professor of Babbittry” and said that &quot;Babbitt&quot; was a stunning work of literary realism about American society. To Mencken, George F. Babbitt was an archetype of the American city dwellers who touted the virtues of Republicanism, Presbyterianism, and absolute conformity because &quot;it is not what he [Babbitt] feels and aspires that moves him primarily; it is what the folks about him will think of him. His politics is communal politics, mob politics, herd politics; his religion is a public rite wholly without subjective significance.&quot; Mencken said that Babbitt was the literary embodiment of everything wrong with American society. In the cultural climate of the early 20th century, like-minded critics and Mencken&#x27;s followers were known as &quot;Babbitt-baiters&quot;.

Despite Mencken&#x27;s praise of &quot;Babbitt&quot; as unflinching social satire, other critics found exaggeration in Lewis&#x27;s depiction of the American businessman. In the book review “From Maupassant to Mencken” (1922), Edmund Wilson compared Lewis&#x27;s style in &quot;Babbitt&quot; to the more “graceful” writing styles of satirists such as Charles Dickens and Mark Twain and said that, as a prose stylist, Lewis&#x27;s literary “gift is almost entirely for making people nasty” and the characters unbelievable. Concurring with Wilson that Lewis was no Twain, another critic dismissed &quot;Babbitt&quot; as “a monstrous, bawling, unconscionable satire” and said “Mr. Lewis is the most phenomenally skillful exaggerator in literature today.” Nonetheless, in its first year of publication, 140,997 copies of the novel were sold in the U.S. In the mid-1920s, Babbitt-baiting became an irritant to American businessmen, Rotarians, and the like, who began defending the Babbitts of the U.S. by way of radio and magazine journalism. They emphasized the virtues of community organizations and the positive contributions that industrial cities have made to American society.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Babbitt&quot; has been converted into films twice, a feat Turner Classic Movies describes as &quot;impressive for a novel that barely has a plot.&quot; The first adaptation was a silent film released in 1924 and starring Willard Louis as George F. Babbitt. According to Warner Bros. records it cost $123,000 and made $278,000 domestic and $28,000 foreign, being a total of $306,000.

The second was a 1934 talkie starring Guy Kibbee. That version, while remaining somewhat true to Lewis&#x27;s novel, takes liberties with the plot, exaggerating Babbitt&#x27;s affair and a sour real estate deal. Both films were Warner Bros. productions.

In November 2023, the La Jolla Playhouse premiered a play adaptation of &quot;Babbitt&quot; starring Matthew Broderick as part of their 2023-2024 Season. The Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, DC, opened the play in October 2024. 

==Cultural influence==
In American literature and popular culture, the character and behaviors of George F. Babbitt became established as negative archetypes of person and personality; a &quot;Babbitt&quot; is “a materialistic and complacent businessman conforming to the standards of his [social] set” and &quot;Babbittry&quot; is the “Philistine behaviour of a Babbitt”. Examples include C. E. M. Joad&#x27;s 1927 book &quot;The Babbitt Warren&quot;, a scathing critique of American society, and Vachel Lindsay&#x27;s 1922 poem
&quot;The Babbitt Jambouree.&quot; Elizabeth Stevenson referenced the character in the title of her popular history of the 1920s, &quot;Babbitts and Bohemians: From the Great War to the Great Depression&quot;.

Bilbo Baggins, the main character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was partly inspired by &quot;Babbitt&quot;, as was the title of the book itself. Bilbo and hobbits in general are known for being most comfortable at home, uninterested in adventure, and primarily concerned with the accumulation of food and possessions. Other fictional influences are found in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Eyeless in Gaza&quot; and Saul Bellow&#x27;s &quot;Humboldt&#x27;s Gift&quot;. In both novels, one character compares another character to George Babbitt, contrasting their aspirational qualities with their ultimate complacency. The novel is one of the inspirations of the novel &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; (the protagonist of which is also a complacent and unfulfilled businessman) and its sequels by John Updike.

<doc id="315193" wikidata="Q3458388" url="?curid=315193" title="Common Sense Revolution">
<text>The phrase Common Sense Revolution (CSR) has been used as a political slogan to describe conservative platforms with a main goal of reducing taxes while balancing the budget by reducing the size and role of government. It has been used in places such as Australia and Canada. This article deals with the &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot; as it was under Ontario Premier Mike Harris and the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario from 1995 to 2002.

==Origin==

From 1943 to 1985, the Progressive Conservative Party (PC) held uninterrupted power in Ontario, under Red Tory premiers such as Leslie Frost, John Robarts, and Bill Davis. In 1985, this era of Conservative Premiers (termed the Big Blue Machine by observers) came to an end when the minority government of Davis&#x27; successor, Frank Miller, was defeated in the legislature and in the subsequent provincial election when the Ontario Liberal Party formed a minority government and the Liberal leader, David Peterson, was sworn in as premier. The PC party was again defeated in the 1987 election that gave Peterson a majority government.

In 1990, a junior cabinet minister from Miller&#x27;s former government, Mike Harris, won the leadership of the party which was widely interpreted as a move to the political right, as Harris defeated the more centrist Dianne Cunningham. Harris immediately set about crafting a new image for himself and the party. In his first election in 1990, he branded himself &quot;the tax fighter&quot;. He strongly opposed an unpopular photo-radar program introduced by the Liberal government and attacked it as a revenue grab. Despite his party&#x27;s third place showing in the election (which was won by NDP leader Bob Rae), Harris had managed to improve the party standing in the legislature and bring some attention to his plan. After the 1990 election, Harris and his advisors (including prominent Ontario Tories Tony Clement, then President of the party, Leslie Noble, Alister Campbell and Tom Long) set to work creating a more comprehensive reform package to present to the province. The result was the CSR.

==Content==
The CSR reform package was markedly neoliberal in nature, closely mirroring the platforms of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the 1980s.

The central tenets of the CSR were tax reduction, balancing the budget, reducing the size and role of government, and an emphasis on individual economic responsibility (often summarized by opposition to government hand-outs). Among other things, Harris promised to reduce personal income tax rates by 30% and balance the provincial budget at the same time (which had reached a record $10 billion deficit under the NDP).

The CSR was specifically tailored as a reform document. It was presented as a radical change to the status quo of provincial government business. The opening words of the document were: &quot;The people of Ontario have a message for their politicians — government isn&#x27;t working anymore. The system is broken.&quot;

==1995 Ontario general election and its impact==

When Bob Rae called the 1995 general election in Ontario, most political commentators were sure that Liberal leader Lyn McLeod would end up taking the premier&#x27;s job. However, this prediction proved rather premature.

Sticking to the contents of the CSR, Harris fought a campaign focused on simple, easily communicated messages. Specifically, he consistently delivered the party&#x27;s promises to lower taxes and reduce the number of people on Ontario&#x27;s social assistance program. The turning point in the election is often considered to be Harris&#x27; performance in the televised leader&#x27;s debate. Rather than get caught up in the debate between McLeod and Rae, Harris used his camera time to speak directly to the camera to convey CSR points, virtually ignoring all questions asked of him by his opponents. Another major contributing factor was a focussed advertising campaign which stuck to 3 key policy elements - &quot;Work for Welfare, Scrap the Quota Law (Affirmative Action) and Tax Cuts for Jobs — Common Sense for a Change&quot;. Harris and the PCs won a majority government in the election, winning 82 of the province&#x27;s 130 seats.

Harris was committed to implementing the CSR platform almost in its entirety. Over several years, income taxes were cut as much as 30%. Spending cuts in &quot;low priority areas&quot; reduced government spending in all areas except for health care, where government spending rose each year the PCs were in office (from $17.6B in 1994/95 to $27.6B in 2003/04). Welfare reforms (including reductions in welfare payments to &#x27;able-bodied citizens&#x27; through the division of the former Welfare program into the Ontario Disability Support Program and the Workfare program, which required able-bodied citizens to work for support) contributed to a reduction of welfare consumption in Ontario. With economic growth in North America generally strong, Ontario over the next five years outperformed every Canadian province except Alberta. This growth allowed Harris to eliminate briefly the $11 billion annual deficit he had inherited from previous Premiers David Peterson and Bob Rae. Although the provincial budget was indeed balanced for the last several years of Harris&#x27;s own time in office, his successor and former deputy Ernie Eves left office with a $5 billion deficit.

==Bill 103==
Harris&#x27; interest in reforming the political structure of cities dated back to his time in opposition when he led the &quot;Mike Harris Task Force on Bringing Common Sense to Metro&quot; (Toronto), on January 5, 1995. This in many ways was designed to counter Premier Bob Rae&#x27;s government task force on the Greater Toronto Area, chaired by Anne Golden. When the final report (called the &quot;Golden Report&quot;) was released in 1996, it called for a GTA-tier of local government and for inter-municipal service agencies (based on a similar model to that of Metro Toronto government).

The net effect of the Golden Report was that it countered the Mike Harris pledge of &quot;less government&quot;. The creation of a larger organizing body for the region ran counter to his party&#x27;s advocacy of smaller government. Harris had felt that politicians, in particular lower level city councillors, were problematic to his party, and prevented free enterprise. The plan for reduced government might have emulated Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s approach that eliminated democratically elected upper-tier city and metropolitan region governments, replacing them with a collection of more politically amenable appointed special-purpose bodies dominated by patronage. &quot;See Greater London Council&quot;.

While many suburban municipalities grew rapidly during Harris&#x27; first term (1995–1999), some, such as Opposition member Bud Wildman, have argued that the net effect of many CSR policies was to transfer wealth from urban to suburban areas and to refocus services to commuters and suburbs. In a highly controversial move, the City of Toronto was merged with the five surrounding cities of Metropolitan Toronto to form a new single-tier &quot;megacity&quot; (a term coined by the local media). The Harris government saw the megacity as a cost-cutting measure. The fact that the merger took place in Toronto, a region with a lower proportion Conservative MPPs, further polarized the debate on the merit of the merger. Some municipalities, particularly Toronto, also complained that the government was &quot;downloading&quot; the costs of services that the province had formerly paid for onto local city and municipal governments.

Long before the merger, in October 1996, a focus group conducted by Angus Reid for the government warned Municipal Affairs Minister Al Leach that there would be &quot;considerable public resistance&quot; to the creation of a unified Toronto. Leach would go on to blame local mayors and community groups for the opposition, going on to be quoted in the same article as saying: &quot;In the end, it became a cause célèbre for all of the issues that the government was bringing forward on its agenda&quot;.

One of the loudest opponents to the new city was former Toronto mayor John Sewell who led the action group Citizens for Local Democracy.

In April 1997, the government introduced Bill 103 (&quot;City of Toronto Act&quot;). The Ontario New Democratic Party filibustered the legislation by proposing a series of amendments, each of which required the government to consult the residents of a specific street in the city before implementing the amalgamation. One street, Cafon Court in Etobicoke, had its amendment successfully passed when government members inadvertently let one of the NDP amendments pass, although the Tories later voted to strike the Cafon amendment.

The round-the-clock fight at Queen&#x27;s Park lasted 10 days before the legislation was finally passed on April 21. On January 1, 1998, the new single-tier City of Toronto came into existence, superseding the former two-tier structure of Metropolitan Toronto, and the constituent cities of Toronto, York, North York, Etobicoke, Scarborough and the Borough of East York.

Other controversial municipal amalgamations took place during Harris&#x27; second term, including in Ottawa, Hamilton, Greater Sudbury and Kawartha Lakes. Unlike the Toronto amalgamation, however, these all involved large rural areas in addition to the primary urban core. Controversy over the amalgamations remains a significant political issue in some of these cities.

==Successor==
Attempting to build on the success of the CSR content and messaging strategy for the 1999 election, Harris and the Ontario Tories branded their new policy document the &quot;Blueprint&quot; (Blue being the official colour of the party). The Blueprint followed the same theoretical framework as its predecessor, yet was tempered for a much different political environment. In 1995 the message had been &quot;reform&quot; and &quot;revolution&quot;, but after four years of conservative government, the message became a balance between stability and emphasizing that there was still &quot;much left to do&quot;. Though not as popular as the CSR, the Blueprint was part of a successful re-election campaign, allowing Harris to win another majority government.

Harris resigned as premier in 2002, and was succeeded by Ernie Eves. Through a variety of factors, including dissatisfaction with the effects of the government&#x27;s platform policies, deterioration of municipal services after downloading, the Walkerton Tragedy during the CSR, and Eves&#x27; handling of the Northeast Blackout, the Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 2003 provincial election by Dalton McGuinty and the Ontario Liberal Party.

==Legacy==
Municipal amalgamation led to a reduction in the number of municipalities in Ontario from 850 to 443 and the number of elected municipal officials by 23%, but resulted in an increase in the number of municipal employees by 39% from 1996 to 2011. Per thousand residents, there were 15.8 municipal employees in 1990 and 20.9 in 2010. Part of this resulted from an increase in services by the larger municipalities, or replacement of volunteer staff with full-time staff such as for firefighting services. Other contributing factors were the downloading of services from provincial jurisdiction to municipalities, such as social assistance, public housing and public health. The remaining increase resulted from wage increases associated with amalgamation and an increase in administrative employment, such as hiring more clerks and treasurers. Amalgamated municipalities increased employees at twice the rate of those that were not restructured.

<text>The World Snooker Championship is the longest-running and most prestigious tournament in professional snooker. It is also the richest, with total prize money of £2,395,000 in 2023, including £500,000 for the winner. First held in 1927, it is now one of the three tournaments (together with the UK Championship and the invitational Masters) that make up snooker&#x27;s Triple Crown Series. The reigning world champion is Kyren Wilson.

Joe Davis dominated the tournament over its first two decades, winning the first 15 world championships before he retired undefeated after his final victory in 1946. The distinctive World Championship trophy, topped by a Greek shepherdess figurine, was acquired by Davis in 1926 for £19 and continues in use to this day. No tournaments were held between 1941 and 1945 due to World War II, or between 1952 and 1963 due to a dispute between the Professional Billiards Players&#x27; Association (PBPA) and the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC). The PBPA held an unofficial alternative, the World Professional Match-play Championship, between 1952 and 1957. The official championship was revived on a challenge basis in 1964.

The World Snooker Championship reverted to a knockout tournament format in 1969, beginning what is now known as snooker&#x27;s modern era. It has taken place annually since then, with every championship since 1977 staged at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. Under a format that has remained largely unchanged since 1982, 32 players reach the Crucible each year; the top 16 players in the world rankings qualify automatically, while another 16 players win places through a qualification tournament. Only three qualifiers have ever won the tournament: Alex Higgins in 1972, Terry Griffiths in 1979, and Shaun Murphy in 2005.

Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan have each won seven times to jointly hold the record of most world titles in the modern era. Ray Reardon and Steve Davis have won six titles; John Higgins and Mark Selby four; John Spencer and Mark Williams three; and Alex Higgins two. Hendry is the youngest champion in the tournament&#x27;s history, winning his first title in 1990 aged 21 years and 106 days. O&#x27;Sullivan became the oldest champion in 2022 when he won his seventh title aged 46 years and 148 days. O&#x27;Sullivan also holds the record for the most Crucible appearances with 32, having taken part in the tournament every year between 1993 and 2024. Fourteen maximum breaks have been made in the history of the tournament, Cliff Thorburn compiled the first in 1983, and Mark Selby the most recent in 2023, which was the first maximum break in a World Championship final. A record 109 century breaks were made at the Crucible in 2022. As of 2024, 28 players have won the World Snooker Championship.

== History ==

===Professional Snooker Championship (1927–1934)===

The first championship was held in 1927, where it was known as the &quot;Professional Snooker Championship&quot;. It was the first professional snooker tournament although the English Amateur Championship has been contested since 1916. Ten professionals entered including most of the leading English billiards players. Matches were over 15 frames with the semi-finals over twenty-three frames and final over 31 . The first match played was between Melbourne Inman and Tom Newman at Thurston&#x27;s Hall, Leicester Square in London. The snooker was played as an added extra to the main event, a billiards match played over two weeks. The match started on Monday 29 November 1926 and one frame of snooker was played at the end of each session. The final between Joe Davis and Tom Dennis was played over four days in early May at Camkin&#x27;s Hall in Birmingham. Davis won the first seven frames, and took a winning 16–7 lead on the third day, eventually winning 20–11. The highest break of the tournament was sixty, made by Albert Cope in his semi-final match against Davis, in a dead frame after Davis had won the match.

The 1928 Championship was played on a challenge basis, with the other six entries playing-off for the right to challenge Davis in the final. Fred Lawrence progressed to the final, but lost 13–16. The challenge system was dropped in the 1929 event. Davis met Dennis in the final, played in Dennis&#x27;s home town of Nottingham. Davis made a new record break of 61, on the way to a 19–14 victory. The same pair met in the 1930 final, played for the first time at Thurston&#x27;s Hall in London, with Davis winning 25–12, with a day to spare and made a new record break of 79. With little prospect of success and little prospect of financial gain, there were only two entries for the 1931 championship. Davis and Tom Dennis met for the fourth time, the event being played in Nottingham. Dennis led 19–16 at one stage, but Davis won nine of the next eleven frames to take the Championship 25–21.

There were three entries for the 1932 tournament. Clark McConachy met Davis in the final, played at Thurston&#x27;s Hall. Davis took the title after a 30–19 win, and set a new record with a break of 99, missing out on his century after he snookered himself. There were five entries in 1933, with debutant Willie Smith meeting Davis in the final, but lost 18–25. There were just two entries in 1934, Davis being opposed by Tom Newman, six times World Billiards Champion. The match was held partly in Nottingham before finishing in Kettering, with Davis winning 25–22.

===Thurston&#x27;s Hall era (1935–1940)===

The 1935 Championship introduced some significant changes. It was the first to incorporate &quot;world&quot; in its name, being called the &quot;World&#x27;s Professional Snooker Championship&quot;. There was also a change in the organisation of the event with the matches being played consecutively at the same venue, Thurston&#x27;s Hall in London. In the period from 1935 to 1940, nearly all World Championship matches were played there and with good attendances the professionals could make some money from their share of the entrance charges. Because of the importance of gate receipts, all frames were played out, even if a player had already won the match.

There were five entries in 1935 Championship. Joe Davis beat Willie Smith 28–21 in the final. Davis recorded the first century break in the history of the championship, 110 in his semi-final match against Tom Newman. The break was made in a dead frame but was still regarded as a championship record. The success of the 1935 championship resulted in a record 13 entries in 1936. Joe Davis and Horace Lindrum met in the final, with Davis having won one of his prior matches 29–2 after taking a winning 16–0 lead; whilst Lindrum had won his semi-final by the same score, 29–2, In the final, Lindrum led 26–24 at the start of the final day and then won the first frame on the last day. However Davis won the last ten frames in a row to win 34–27.

Qualifying was introduced for the first time in 1937. As the event had nine entries, two players were chosen to play a qualification match. The two were Fred Davis, Joe&#x27;s younger brother and Bill Withers. Withers won the match 17–14, a defeat that Fred put down to ignoring his worsening eyesight. Lindrum played Joe Davis in the final, and led 17–13 at the half-way stage, but Davis recovered to win the match 32–29. Davis made a break of 103 in the final, the first championship century in live play.

Lindrum chose not to enter the 1938 event, which Davis also won, beating Sidney Smith in the final. The following year, Davis met Smith again in the final, and took a winning 37–25 lead on the final day. The 1940 Championship featured the Davis brothers meeting in the final. Joe led 15–10 but then Fred won eleven frames in succession to lead 21–15. On the final day Joe made a 101 break to take a winning 37–35 lead. The spectators cheered for nearly a minute when Joe made his century. In October 1940, during The Blitz, Thurston&#x27;s Hall was destroyed by a parachute mine which demolished the south-western corner of Leicester Square. No tournaments were played during the remainder of World War II.

===Post-war era (1946–1952)===
The championship resumed in 1946 where Joe Davis again met Lindrum in the final. The Royal Horticultural Hall in London was converted to a snooker venue, seating 1,250 for the championships. The match was extended from one week to two, allowing up to 30,000 spectators to be accommodated with prices ranging from 5s to £3. Davis maintained a small lead throughout and won, early on the final day, leading 73–62. Davis made six centuries in the final, setting new championship records of 133 and 136. The event proved a financial success for the players, with Davis receiving £1,800 and Lindrum £550.

In October 1946, Joe Davis announced that he would no longer play in the World Championship, having never lost a match in the championship from its inception in 1927. He did not, in any other sense, retire from snooker, continuing to play in other tournaments and exhibition matches for many years. The finalists for the 1947 championship, Fred Davis and Walter Donaldson, agreed to delay the final until the autumn so that it could be played at the rebuilt Thurston&#x27;s Hall. Donaldson got off to a good start, leading 44–28 after the first week and eventually took a winning 73–49 lead early on the 11th day. The pair met again in the 1948 final, Fred Davis and Walter Donaldson again reached the final, with Davis winning 73–49. They also contested the 1949 final, and although Donaldson led 39–33 after the first week, Davis pulled ahead on the second week and eventually took a winning 73–58 lead. After three finals at Leicester Square Hall the 1950 final moved to Blackpool Tower Circus. Fred Davis and Donaldson met in the final for the next two years, with Donaldson winning in 1950, 49–42, and Davis in 1951.

Following a dispute between the Professional Billiards Players&#x27; Association (PBPA) and the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC), members of the PBPA boycotted the 1952 championship. The BACC thought the championship should be primarily a matter of honour, and financial considerations should come second. As a consequence of the boycott there were only two entries, Lindrum and McConachy. McConachy had played in the recent News of the World Tournament but had performed badly, losing all eight of his matches. Although Lindrum did not play in the News of the World Tournament, he had been receiving more generous starts in recent handicap tournaments and had even withdrawn from the 1950 Sporting Record Masters&#x27; Snooker Tournament in 1950, complaining about his overly generous handicap. Lindrum won the championship, reaching a winning 73–37 position early on the tenth day.

===World Professional Match-play Championship (1952–1957)===

Having boycotted the official championship, the PBPA established their own championship called the PBPA Snooker Championship which attracted ten entries. Fred Davis and Donaldson were given byes to the semi-final stage, and met again in the final, held at the Blackpool Tower Circus, as Davis won 38–35. A second such championship was played the following year, referred to as the 1953 World Professional Match-play Championship, with the same finalists. Played at Leicester Square Hall, it was tied at 33–33 at the start of the final session but Davis won 37–34. The pair met in the 1954 final, held in Manchester, their eighth successive final. It was the most one-sided of the eight finals, Davis taking a winning 36–15 lead early on the fifth day.

Fred Davis met John Pulman in the 1955 final at Blackpool Tower Circus, with Davis winning 38–35. Davis defeated Pulman again in the 1956 final, but did not enter the 1957 championship. Pulman defeated Jackie Rea in the final to win his first world title.

===Challenge matches (1964–1968)===
With the approval of the BACC, the championship was revived on a challenge basis in 1964. The first contest was played in Burroughes Hall, London in April 1964 between Pulman and Davis, with Pulman retaining the championship after winning 19–16. Pulman won two further challenge matches played at Burroughes Hall, beating Rex Williams in October 1964, and Davis again in March 1965. In late 1965 Pulman and Rex Williams played a long series of short matches in South Africa. Pulman won twenty-five of the forty-seven matches to retain the title. Williams set a new championship record with a break of 142 in the twenty-fourth match. After this series of matches Pulman played the South African Fred Van Rensburg, winning 39 frames to 12. Davis and Pulman played again for the championship in April 1966. Pulman won four of the seven matches to retain the title. Australian Eddie Charlton challenged Pulman to a 73 frame match in Bolton, played in March 1968. Pulman led 19–17 at the half-way stage, and pulled ahead and won the match 37–28.

===Start of modern era knockout tournaments (1969–1976)===
For 1969, the championship reverted to being run as a knockout tournament. This is regarded as the beginning of the modern era for snooker. Eight professionals entered, four from the 1950s and four new professionals. The first match, played in late 1968, saw the end of John Pulman&#x27;s reign as champion, beaten by one of the new professionals, John Spencer. Spencer led 24–18 after the final afternoon session and clinched the match by winning the first frame in the evening with a ninety-seven break. Spencer and another of the new professionals, Gary Owen, met in the final at the Victoria Halls in London. Spencer won the seventy-three frame final 37–24. Spencer lost to Ray Reardon at the semi-final stage of the 1970 Championship. Reardon went on to win the final against John Pulman to win his first title.

The next world championship was held in Australia in late 1970. For the only time there was a group stage with nine players, with the top four moving on to a knock-out stage. Ray Reardon and John Spencer met in one semi-final with Spencer winning easily. The other semi-final was between two Australians, Warren Simpson and Eddie Charlton. Simpson caused a major upset by beating Charlton. In the final in Sydney, Spencer led throughout and won the six-day final 37–29. 1972 saw the emergence of Alex Higgins. Winning his two qualifying matches, he beat John Pulman, Rex Williams and then Spencer in the final to win the title at his first attempt. At , Higgins was the youngest world champion. Previously only Joe Davis had won the title while under the age of 30, being when he won in 1927.

The 1973 Championship marked a change in format, with the tournament played over two weeks at a single venue rather than over an extended period. Sixteen played in the first round, the eight winners playing eight seeded players in the second round. In the semi-finals, defending champion Alex Higgins lost 9–23 to Eddie Charlton while Ray Reardon beat John Spencer 23–22. In the five-day final Charlton led 7–0 after the opening session but Reardon led 17–13 after two days. The match continued to be close but Reardon pulled ahead on the final day to win 38–32, for his second title. The 1974 Championship followed a similar format but with somewhat shorter matches and event reduced to ten days. Sixty-year-old Fred Davis beat Alex Higgins in the quarter-finals before losing to Ray Reardon. Reardon met Graham Miles in the three-day final. Reardon led 17–11 after two days and won comfortably 22–12.

The 1975 Championship was held in Australia. Twenty-seven players competed including eight from Australia, sixteen from the United Kingdom, two from Canada and one from South Africa. Ray Reardon beat John Spencer and Alex Higgins to reach the final where he met Eddie Charlton. The final was held near Melbourne but matches were held in many locations, the semi-finals having been held in Canberra and Brisbane. In the final, Reardon won ten of the twelve frames on the second day to lead 16–8 but Charlton won the first nine frames on the third day to lead. Reardon then led 23–21 before Charlton won eight frames in a row to lead 29–23, needing just two of the last nine frames to win. However Reardon then won seven frames in a row to lead again and, although Charlton levelled the match at 30–30, Reardon won the deciding frame.

The 1976 World Snooker Championship was held at two venues; half the draw was held in Middlesbrough and half in Manchester, which also hosted the final. Alex Higgins won three close matches to reach the final, where he met Ray Reardon. Reardon led 24–15 at the start of the last day and, winning three of the first four frames, took the title 27–16, his fourth successive title. There were a number of problems during the tournament including the standard of the tables. This was the first year the championship was sponsored under the cigarette brand Embassy.

===Crucible era starts (1977–1980)===
In 1977, the championship moved to its new home at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, where it has remained ever since. The 1977 championship featured sixteen competitors: eight seeded players and eight qualifiers. John Spencer beat defending champion Ray Reardon 13–6 in the quarter-finals, and met Canadian Cliff Thorburn in the final. The two players were closely matched throughout, the score being tied at 9–9 after the first day and 18–18 after the second. Spencer led 22–20 after the first session on the final day, and pulled ahead to win 25–21 in the final session of the match. 

Defending champion John Spencer lost to Perrie Mans in the first round of the 1978 championship. The 1977 runner-up Cliff Thorburn was defeated 12–13 in his quarter-final match against Eddie Charlton, who won the last five frames. However, Charlton then lost to Ray Reardon in the semi-finals; he was ahead 12–9 after the first three sessions of the match, but Reardon won all seven frames of the fourth session to win 18–14. Mans met sixty-four-year-old Fred Davis in the other semi-final, defeating him 18–16. Reardon won the final 25–18 to claim his sixth world title. He became the oldest World Champion, aged . The first seven World Snooker Champions all won a championship when in their forties; the last of these was Reardon. It would be another forty years before a won the title again, as Mark Williams won the 2018 championship aged forty-three.

The 1979 championship was won by Terry Griffiths who had only turned professional seven months prior to the tournament, and needed to win two qualifying matches to reach the Crucible. Griffiths was trailing 16–17 against Eddie Charlton in the semi-final, before eventually winning the match 19–17 at 1.40 am. He then beat Dennis Taylor 24–16 in the final, winning the record first prize of £10,000. Canadian Bill Werbeniuk made a break of 142 in his quarter-final match against John Virgo, equalling the championship record set by Rex Williams in South Africa in 1965.

In the 1980 championship, the number of participants was extended to twenty-four players. Those seeded from nine to sixteen each met a qualifier in the first round, the winner meeting one of the top eight seeds in the second round. Several changes were made to accommodate the extra matches, including a reduction in the number of frames played in the final, to a maximum of thirty-five. Cliff Thorburn met Alex Higgins in the final. The match was level at 9–9 after the first day and again at 13–13 after the afternoon session on the second day. During the evening session, the score was tied once again at 16–16, before Thorburn made a 119 clearance in frame thirty-three and a break of fifty-one in frame thirty-four to win the championship.

===Steve Davis years (1981–1989)===

Despite being the number thirteen seed, Steve Davis was the favourite for the 1981 championship. He won a close match 10–8 against Jimmy White in the first round and defeated three past world champions to meet fourteenth seed Doug Mountjoy in the final. Davis won the first six frames but was only leading 10–8 at the end of the first day. He led 14–12 at the start of the final evening session and won the next four frames to win the match 18–12. At 23 years old, Davis was the second-youngest champion. Mountjoy set a new championship record with a highest break of 145 during his semi-final match against Ray Reardon.

The 1982 championship was extended to thirty-two players with sixteen seeded players and sixteen qualifiers. There was a surprise in the first round when Tony Knowles beat defending champion Steve Davis 10–1. In the semi-finals Jimmy White was ahead 15–14, and led 59–0 in the thirtieth frame, but missed an easy red with the rest. His opponent Alex Higgins then made a sixty-nine clearance and won the deciding frame and the match 16–15. Higgins met Ray Reardon in the final. The score was 15–15 before Higgins won three frames in a row to win the championship, finishing with a clearance of 135, denying Reardon the chance to win a seventh world title.

Cliff Thorburn made the first maximum break of the World Championship in 1983 during his second-round match against Terry Griffiths. The importance of this achievement at the time is demonstrated by the fact that play was stopped on the other table. This was the break that gave the World Championship one of its most iconic words of commentary, &quot;oh, good luck mate&quot; on the final black, courtesy of Jack Karnehm. Thorburn beat Griffiths in a final-frame decider, a match that finished at 03:51, the latest-ever finish for a match at the Crucible. Thorburn then also won his quarter-final and semi-final matches in the deciding frame; exhausted, and deflated by the news that his wife had suffered a miscarriage, he faced a one-sided final against Steve Davis who won 18–6. The 1984 final was between Steve Davis and Jimmy White (in his first final). Davis led 12–4 after the first day but White won seven of the eight frames on the final afternoon. Davis led 16–12 at the evening interval and, despite a comeback from White, Davis won 18–16.

In the 1985 final, also known as the black ball final, Dennis Taylor beat Steve Davis 18–17 on the final ball of the final frame, in one of the most closely contested matches of all time. It finished at 00:19 and, with an audience of 18.5 million, it remains the most-watched programme in the history of BBC2, and holds the record for a post-midnight audience for any channel in the United Kingdom. Davis met sixteenth seed Joe Johnson in the 1986 final. Johnson led 13–11 at the start of the evening session and won five of the first six frames to win 18–12. Johnson had trailed 9–12 in his quarter-final against Terry Griffiths but won the last four frames to win 13–12. Johnson and Davis met again in the 1987 final although, on this occasion, Davis was the winner by a score of 18–14.

Steve Davis and Terry Griffiths met in the 1988 final. The score was 8–8 after the first day but Davis pulled ahead on the final day and won 18–11. Davis made his seventh successive final in 1989, meeting John Parrott. Davis led 13–3 after the first day and won the first five frames on the second day to win the match 18–3. As of 2023, Davis&#x27; victory in 1989 is the biggest winning margin in a World Championship final and one of only three occasions where the final has been won on the Sunday afternoon, with a session to spare. Davis won £105,000 for his 1989 victory, a new record.

===Stephen Hendry dominates (1990–1999)===


In 1990, Steve Davis failed to reach the final for the first time since 1982, losing in the semi-finals 14–16 to Jimmy White. Davis’ seven consecutive crucible finals to this day has yet to be equalled. In the final Stephen Hendry beat White 18–12 becoming, at , the youngest ever world champion.

Hendry was the number one seed in the 1991 tournament, but lost in the quarter-finals to Steve James. The final was between John Parrott and Jimmy White, Parrott winning 18–11.

In 1992, Jimmy White became the second player to make a maximum break in the world championship, during his 10–4 first round win over Tony Drago. Defending champion John Parrott beat Eddie Charlton 10–0, the first of only two whitewashes in the Crucible era (the second being by Shaun Murphy over Luo Honghao in 2019). Stephen Hendry met Jimmy White in the final. White led 14–8 but Hendry won ten frames in a row to win 18–14. Eight seeded players were knocked out in round one in 1992, a record which was equalled in 2012 and 2024.

James Wattana, from Thailand made history in 1993 - becoming the first Asian player to reach the semi-finals, where he lost to Jimmy White. The final was one-sided, with Stephen Hendry beating White 18–5 with a session to spare, the last time (as of 2023) that the final has been won without needing a fourth session. Total prize money reached £1,000,000 for the first time.

Jimmy White reached his sixth final in 1994, meeting Stephen Hendry for the fourth time. Hendry led 5–1 but White won six frames in a row to lead 7–5. Thereafter the match was always close and eventually went to a final frame. In the deciding frame, White had the first opportunity to finally win the title that had eluded him but missed a black off the spot when among the balls, after which Hendry made a break of fifty-eight to clinch the title. Fergal O&#x27;Brien made a century in his first frame at the Crucible, the only player ever to do so.

In 1995, Hendry and White met in the semi-finals, where Hendry won again, making a maximum break during the match. In the other semi-final Nigel Bond beat unseeded Andy Hicks. The final was initially close until Hendry won nine frames in a row to take the score from 5–5 to 14–5. Hendry eventually won 18–9. Hendry made a record twelve century breaks during the tournament.

The 1996 tournament saw Peter Ebdon reach the final, beating Jimmy White, Steve Davis and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan on the way. He met Stephen Hendry in the final. Ebdon led 4–2 in the early stages but Hendry eventually won 18–12 to win his fifth successive title. There were forty-eight century breaks during the final stages, a new record.

Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan made the fastest maximum break in snooker history in 1997 - in the first round of the championship - taking just five minutes and eight seconds. The final was between Stephen Hendry and Irishman Ken Doherty. Doherty led 15–7 before Hendry won five frames in a row. Doherty then won the next three frames to win 18–12, ending Hendry&#x27;s winning run of twenty-nine consecutive matches.

In 1998, Stephen Hendry lost to Jimmy White in the first round of the championship. Doherty reached the final again meeting 22-year-old John Higgins. Higgins won 18–12, making five centuries in the final. In total there were fifty-nine centuries during the tournament of which Higgins made fourteen, both records.

Stephen Hendry won his seventh and final world title at the 1999 tournament, the most in the modern era until being equalled by Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in 2022. In the final he beat Mark Williams 18–11. In the semi-final between Hendry and O&#x27;Sullivan each player made four century breaks including a run of four centuries in four consecutive frames, two by each player. The eight centuries were a record for a world championship match.

===The class of &#x27;92 (2000–2013)===

The period from 2000 to 2013 was dominated by three players, who were all born in 1975 and turned professional in 1992, dubbed the &quot;class of &#x27;92&quot;: Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan won five times in this period, John Higgins three times and Mark Williams twice. Higgins had also won in 1998; Williams would win again in 2018 and O&#x27;Sullivan went on to win in 2020 and 2022.

In 2000 Stephen Hendry was beaten 10–7 in the first round by Crucible debutant Stuart Bingham. In his semi-final, Mark Williams trailed 11–15 to John Higgins but took six frames in a row to win 17–15. In the final, Williams met fellow Welshman Matthew Stevens. Stevens led 13–7 but Williams made another comeback to win 18–16, becoming the first left-handed champion. 2000 was the first time (and, as of 2023 the only occasion) where the final was contested by two Welsh players.

Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan won his first world championship in 2001, defeating John Higgins 18–14 in the final. O&#x27;Sullivan led 14–7 before Higgins won four frames in a row. O&#x27;Sullivan looked likely to win the title in the 31st frame as he led 17–13 and 69–6, however he missed a red in the middle pocket and Higgins won the frame with a break of 65. Higgins made a break of 45 in frame 32 but O&#x27;Sullivan then made an 80 break to take the title.

Stephen Hendry beat defending champion Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 17–13 in the semi-final of the 2002 Championship, Hendry reaching his ninth final. Peter Ebdon beat Matthew Stevens 17–16 in the other semi-final. Stevens led 16–14 but Ebdon won the last three frames, including a 138 total clearance in the penultimate frame. The final went to the deciding frame where Ebdon made a break of 59 and clinched the title. There were a record sixty-eight centuries in the tournament, including a record sixteen by Stephen Hendry who made five centuries in the semi-final and a further four in the final.

Mark Williams won his second World title in 2003 by defeating Ken Doherty 18–16 in the final. Prize money peaked in 2003 with the winner receiving a record £270,000 and the thirty-two Crucible players getting at least £15,000. Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan made the fifth maximum break in the World Championship during his first round match against Marco Fu becoming the first player to score two 147s in the event; however O&#x27;Sullivan was defeated 10–6, becoming the first player to make a maximum break and then go on to lose the match.

Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan won both his quarter final and semi final matches with a session to spare in 2004. This included a 17–4 victory over Hendry in the semi final, which was the biggest ever semi-final victory, replacing Hendry&#x27;s 16–4 win over Terry Griffiths in 1992. O&#x27;Sullivan went on to win his second world title by defeating Graeme Dott 18–8 in the final, despite Dott having led 5–0.

Shaun Murphy won the 2005 championship by defeating Matthew Stevens 18–16 in the final. Murphy was only the second qualifier to win the World Championship, after Terry Griffiths in 1979. Murphy won two qualifying matches and then five matches at the Crucible to take the title. Murphy was also the lowest ranked player ever to win the World Championship.

Graeme Dott beat Peter Ebdon 18–14 in the 2006 final. The match finished at 00:52 am, the latest finish of a World Snooker Championship final. This was the first Championship sponsored by a betting company after the banning of tobacco sponsorship. Dott won £200,000 for his victory with the thirty-two Crucible players getting at least £9,600, both significant reductions on the 2003 prize money. In the last round of the qualifying competition Robert Milkins had the first 147 break made during qualifying for the championship. Despite his maximum, Milkins lost to Mark Selby.

The 2007 Championship was won by John Higgins who beat qualifier Mark Selby 18–13 in the final. The match finished at 00:55 am, even later than the 2006 final and setting another record for the latest finish in the final. Shaun Murphy came back from 7–12 down to win his quarter-final match against Matthew Stevens, but lost in the deciding frame of his semi-final to Mark Selby.

The 2008 Championship was won by Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan who beat Ali Carter 18–8 in the final. Both O&#x27;Sullivan and Carter had made maximum breaks earlier in the tournament, the first time there had been two 147 breaks in the same World Championship. It was O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s third maximum in the Championship. Although the 147s were made on consecutive days, they were made in different rounds: O&#x27;Sullivan made his maximum during a 13–7 defeat of Mark Williams in round 2 - a defeat which put former two-time champion and world number 1 Williams out of the top 16 for the following season - Carter made his 147 during his win over Peter Ebdon in the quarter finals. As a result, the prize money for a 147 was shared between both players. O&#x27;Sullivan defeated Stephen Hendry 17–6 in the semi final with a session to spare. After tying the first session 4–4, O&#x27;Sullivan completed an 8–0 whitewash over Hendry in their second session, and won the first frame of session three, meaning that O&#x27;Sullivan had won twelve consecutive frames from 1–4 down to 13–4 in front. At one point O&#x27;Sullivan scored 448 points without reply. This was the first time Hendry had lost every frame in a full session at the Crucible.

John Higgins won his third world title in 2009, beating Shaun Murphy 18–9. Michaela Tabb refereed the match, becoming the first woman to do so in a World Championship final. There were a record eighty-three century breaks in the Championship, well ahead of the previous highest of sixty-eight. Stephen Hendry won his 1000th at the Crucible Theatre, the first player to do so. The championship included the second longest ever frame at the Crucible which lasted seventy-four minutes fifty-eight seconds between Stephen Maguire and Mark King.

The 2010 Championship was won by Neil Robertson who beat qualifier Graeme Dott 18–13 in the final, becoming the fourth non-U.K. winner of the title after Horace Lindrum, Cliff Thorburn and Ken Doherty.

John Higgins won his fourth world title in 2011, beating Judd Trump 18–15 in the final. 21-year-old qualifier Trump became the youngest finalist since Stephen Hendry in 1990. Trump had beaten David Gilbert in the qualifying competition and then defeated defending champion Neil Robertson in the first round.

Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan won his fourth world title in 2012, defeating Ali Carter 18–11 in the final. On the opening day Hendry made his third maximum break at the Crucible, equalling Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s record. He announced his retirement from professional snooker following his loss to Stephen Maguire in the quarter-finals. Aged , Luca Brecel became the youngest player to compete at the Crucible.

Defending champion Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan retained the title in 2013 despite having played only one competitive match all season. He defeated Barry Hawkins 18–12 in the final to win the title for the fifth time. He broke Hendry&#x27;s record of 127 career Crucible centuries, finishing the tournament with 131. He also became the first player to make six century breaks in a Crucible final.

Between 1998 and 2020, seventeen of the twenty-three finals featured at least one class of &#x27;92 player.

===Mark Selby and the veterans (2014–2022)===

Mark Selby won the world title in 2014 by beating defending champion Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 18–14 in the final having trailed 5–10. Selby won a record £300,000 for his victory; the prize exceeding the previous highest of £270,000 in 2003, although prize money for first-round losers remained at £12,000.

Selby lost 9–13 in the second round of the 2015 Championship to Crucible debutant Anthony McGill. Stuart Bingham won the title, defeating Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 13–9 in the quarter-finals, Judd Trump 17–16 in the semi-finals, and Shaun Murphy 18–15 in the final to win the first world title of his twenty-year professional career. At the age of 38, Bingham became the oldest player to win the title since Ray Reardon in 1978 (although this achievement would subsequently be surpassed by 43-year-old Mark Williams in 2018, 44-year-old O&#x27;Sullivan in 2020, and 46-year-old O&#x27;Sullivan in 2022). The tournament set a new record for the most century breaks made at the Crucible, with eighty-six.

Defending champion Stuart Bingham lost 9–10 against Ali Carter in the first round of the 2016 Championship. Mark Selby defeated Ding Junhui 18–14 in the final to claim his second world title. Ding was the first Asian player to reach a World Championship final. There were eighty-six century breaks made during the Championship, equalling the record set in 2015. A new record of ten centuries in a professional match was set in the semi-final between Ding Junhui and Alan McManus, with Ding also setting a new record of seven centuries by one player in a World Championship match. Mark Selby and Marco Fu set a new record for the longest frame of snooker ever played at the Crucible, seventy six minutes eleven seconds.

Prize money for the 2017 Championship was a record £1,750,000 with the winner receiving £375,000. Prize money for first-round losers was a record £16,000, exceeding the £15,000 players received in 2003. In a high-quality and tightly contested semi-final, defending champion Mark Selby beat Ding Junhui 17–15 in a repeat of the previous year&#x27;s final. Selby met John Higgins, in a repeat of the 2007 final. Higgins was the second oldest Crucible finalist at ; only Ray Reardon had been older. Selby trailed 4–10 during the second session but then won twelve of the next fourteen
frames to lead 16–12. Higgins won the next three frames but Selby took the title 18–15, becoming champion for the third time in four years, joining Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry, and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan as the only men to have successfully defended the title since its move to the Crucible.

In 2018, two &quot;class of &#x27;92&quot; players, Mark Williams and John Higgins, met in the final. Their rivalry dated back to the late 1990s, although only three of their meetings had been in the World Championships, all in semi finals, in 1999, 2000 (both won by Williams 17–15) and 2011 (won by Higgins 17–14). The match was closely contested, Williams coming out on top by 18–16 to win the World Championship for the first time since 2003, setting a new record for the longest gap between World Championship victories. He won £425,000.

Higgins reached the final again in 2019, only to be beaten 18–9 by Judd Trump, who won £500,000. Their final set records for the most century breaks in a professional match, with 11, beating the previous record of 10 set in the 2016 semifinal between Ding Junhui and Alan McManus. It also set a record for the most centuries in a Crucible final, bettering the previous record of eight, set in 2002 when Stephen Hendry played Peter Ebdon, and equalled in 2013 when O&#x27;Sullivan played Barry Hawkins. Trump set a new record for the most centuries by a player in a world final, achieving seven to better O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s six centuries in the 2013 final. This ties with the most centuries by a player in a crucible match, set by Ding in 2016 in the semi-finals. The tournament also recorded a record 100 century breaks.

The 2020 championship was postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, finishing on 16 August instead of the originally planned date of 4 May. Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan made a record 28th consecutive appearance at the Crucible and won the championship for the sixth time, beating Kyren Wilson 18–8 in the final, and collecting prize money of £500,000. It was O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s 37th ranking title, passing the record of 36 ranking titles won by Stephen Hendry. John Higgins made the first 147 break at the Crucible since 2012, earning him the £15,000 highest break prize plus an additional £40,000 bonus for achieving a maximum.

At the 2021 event, O&#x27;Sullivan was knocked out in the second round by Anthony McGill in a final-frame decider. Judd Trump and Neil Robertson both fell in the quarter-finals. Selby met Murphy in the final, and won 18–15.

At the 2022 event, O&#x27;Sullivan equalled Steve Davis&#x27;s record of 30 Crucible appearances. The Class of &#x27;92 — O&#x27;Sullivan, Higgins, and Williams — all reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1999. O&#x27;Sullivan defeated Trump 18–13 in the final to win his seventh world title, equalling Hendry&#x27;s modern-era record. Aged 46 years and 148 days, he became the oldest world champion in the tournament&#x27;s history, surpassing Reardon, who was aged 45 years and 203 days when he won his last title in 1978. O&#x27;Sullivan also surpassed Hendry&#x27;s record of 70 Crucible wins, setting a new record of 74. The second-round match between Selby and Yan Bingtao featured the longest frame ever played at the Crucible, at 85 minutes. Dott made a maximum break in the qualifying rounds, and Robertson made a maximum in his second-round match against Lisowski, becoming the eighth player to make a 147 at the Crucible. A new record of 109 century breaks was set at the Crucible stage, one more than the 108 made the previous year. Williams made 16 centuries during the event, equalling the record for the most centuries in a single championship set by Hendry in 2002.

===New generation breaks through (2023–)===

During the 2023 event, play in a first-round match between Robert Milkins and Joe Perry was suspended when a male protester wearing a Just Stop Oil T-shirt ran into the arena, climbed onto the table and covered it in an orange powder. A second person tried to attach themselves to the second table but was removed by referee Olivier Marteel and security. Luca Brecel became the first continental European to win the title, having never previously won a match at the Crucible; after close victories in the first two rounds (over Ricky Walden 10–9 and Mark Williams 13–11), he overturned a 10–6 deficit to beat O&#x27;Sullivan 13–10 in the quarter-finals, pulled off an even bigger comeback from 14–5 down to beat Si Jiahui 17–15 in the semi-final, and finally defeated Selby 18–15 in the final to win his first world title.

== Format ==
The televised stages of the World Championship have used the same format since 1982, with the exception of a change to the semi-final format that was introduced in 1997. The main competition is a single-elimination (knockout) tournament with 32 players, contested over 17 days ending on the first Monday in May, which is May Day bank holiday in the United Kingdom. Of the 32 players, 16 are seeded automatically into the main draw and the other 16 need to earn a place through a qualifying competition, which takes place immediately before the main competition but at a separate venue. The reigning world champion receives a direct entry and is the number one seed in the draw. The other 15 direct entries are based on the latest world rankings, these players being seeded according to their world ranking positions. As the defending champion is usually a player that is ranked in the top 16, it is normally the top 16 ranked players that receive a direct entry to the main competition (if the defending champion is outside the top 16, then the top 15 ranked players receive a direct entry in addition to the defending champion).

Before 1982, there were a number of different formats used for the championship. In 1980 and 1981, 24 players competed in the final stages at the Crucible; the top eight seeds had a bye in the first round while seeds 9 to 16 played in the first round against eight qualifiers. From 1977 to 1979, the first three years at the Crucible, there were only 16 players in the final stages, eight seeds playing eight qualifiers in the first round. For information on the players involved, see list of players to appear in the World Snooker Championship.

The length of the matches varies per round as follows: the first round is played as the best of 19 frames, spread over two sessions of play; the second round and the quarter-finals are the best of 25 frames, played over three sessions; the semi-finals are the best of 33 frames, played over four sessions on three consecutive days of play; and the final is a maximum of 35 frames, over four sessions on two consecutive days of play. For the first 12 days of the tournament, until the end of the quarter-final stage, two tables are set up in the arena to allow two matches to be played concurrently. For the last five days of the competition (the semi-finals and final), only one table is used.

From 1980 to 1996, the semi-finals were played as the best of 31 frames, and this was changed to the best of 33 frames from 1997 onwards. Since first becoming a 17-day event in 1982, the World Championship has nearly always ended on the first Monday in May, with five exceptions. In 1982, the tournament ended on Sunday 16 May, and it ended on the last Sunday of April in 1985, 1990 and 1995; in all of these cases, the event started on a Friday rather than a Saturday. The fifth and most recent instance of the tournament starting on a Friday was the 2020 edition: because of a delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the main competition was played over 17 days from Friday 31 July to Sunday 16 August.

Several changes to the qualifying system came into effect for the 2015 championship. All living world champions would be extended an opportunity to play in the qualifying rounds. The top 16 seeds would still qualify automatically for the first round at the Crucible, but all non-seeded players would have to start in the first of three qualifying rounds. Previously players seeded 17 to 32 only had to win one qualifying match to reach the final stages. The overall championship would increase from 128 to 144 players, with the additional places made available to former world champions and players from emerging countries.

In 2020, another significant change was made to the qualifying competition for the World Championship. Whereas in previous years, the qualifying rounds were played like a mini-tournament (with all seeded players playing an unseeded player in the first round), with the 16 &quot;winners&quot; being the qualifiers to go to the main draw using traditional knockout format, the new system involved seeding the players based on their world ranking. Players seeded 1–32 (representing 17–54 in the world rankings) would join the qualifying later than those who were seeded lower, or unseeded. The lowest-ranked and those who were invited as amateurs played in Round 1, with the winner moving on to play in Round 2 against a seeded player from 55 to 91 in the world rankings. In addition to the format change, the 2020 qualifying round became the first qualifying tournament to be broadcast on television in the history of snooker. Previously, only the Judgement Day round was broadcast on World Snookers&#x27; social media platforms.

Since the 2020 tournament was held during the height of the global COVID-19 pandemic, Rounds 1–3 were played as a single session best-of-11 frames match, with only the &quot;Judgement Day&quot; final round played with the usual best-of-19 system. This change to the length of matches persisted into the 2021 and 2022 championships for the same reasons. From 2023, the match length of the qualifying rounds reverted to the previous incarnation of best-of-19&#x27;s, but the seeded format remains in place.

== Winners ==
===World Championship finalists===
From its foundation in 1927, the world snooker championship was dominated by Joe Davis, who won each of the first 15 tournaments before retiring undefeated in 1946. In 1952, a dispute between the BACC and the PBPA led to the formation of the World Professional Match-play Championship, whose winners are generally acknowledged as world champions. No championship was held between 1957 and 1964, when it was revived on a challenge basis until 1968.

The &#x27;modern&#x27; era is considered to have started in 1969, when the championship reverted to a knock-out tournament format from a challenge format. Since then, the best record is seven wins, by Stephen Hendry (1990–1999) and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan (2001–2022). Ray Reardon won six times in the 1970s, while Steve Davis won six times in the 1980s.

===Champions by country===

==Sponsorship==
Except for two championships played in Australia, all championships from 1969 to 2005 were sponsored by tobacco companies. In 1969 and 1970 the championship was sponsored by John Player under the brand Player&#x27;s No.6. The Gallaher Group sponsored under the brand Park Drive from 1972 to 1974, while from 1976 to 2005 Imperial Tobacco sponsored under the brand Embassy. Legislation in 2003 placed restrictions on tobacco advertising, including sponsorship of sporting events. Embassy received special dispensation to continue snooker sponsorship until 2005.

From 2006 to 2022, all championships were sponsored by betting companies. In 2006, 888.com took over sponsorship of the event under a five-year deal, but it pulled out after just three years. Betfred.com was the sponsor from 2009 to 2012, followed by Betfair in 2013, Dafabet in 2014, and Betfred again from 2015 to 2022.

Online car retailer Cazoo signed a multi-year deal to sponsor the tournament from 2023.

==Television coverage==
Before the world championship moved to the Crucible in 1977, TV coverage was very limited. In the 1950s, the BBC occasionally showed snooker on black and white television, including 30-minute programmes of the 1953 and 1955 finals, with commentary by Sidney Smith. Despite the launch of &quot;Pot Black&quot; in colour in 1969, there was little coverage of the World Championship. There was some coverage of the 1973, 1974 and 1976 world championships in Manchester on two Saturday afternoon &quot;Grandstand&quot; programmes during those three years. Commentary was by Ted Lowe.

BBC TV coverage for the first Crucible championship in 1977 was increased but was limited to highlights of the semi-finals and some coverage of the final on &quot;Grandstand&quot; and a late night highlights programme. The commentator was Ted Lowe with the highlight programmes presented by Alan Weeks. The 1978 championship was the first to have daily BBC TV coverage with 14 nightly highlights programmes as well as Saturday afternoon coverage on &quot;Grandstand&quot;. Ted Lowe commentated while the programmes were presented by David Vine and Alan Weeks. In 1979, TV coverage was extended to include an early-evening &quot;Frame of the Day&quot; as well as live coverage of parts of the final. David Vine was the presenter while the commentary team was extended to include Jack Karnehm and Clive Everton. In 1980, TV coverage included daily live coverage for the first time. Coverage of the final was interrupted to bring live coverage of the Iranian Embassy Siege.

David Vine continued to be the main anchor for the BBC&#x27;s TV coverage until 2000, with David Icke as prominent deputy presenter from 1984 to 1990, then Dougie Donnelly and occasionally Eamonn Holmes through the 1990s. For some years, commentary was primarily by Ted Lowe, Clive Everton and Jack Karnehm although John Pulman, Vera Selby and others were used. In 1986 Jim Meadowcroft, John Spencer and John Virgo were used as summarisers. From 2002 to 2009, the BBC coverage was hosted by Hazel Irvine or Ray Stubbs. Irvine took over as main anchor in 2010 with highlights presented by Rishi Persad.

In February 2013, the BBC announced that Persad had been replaced by Jason Mohammad, who later stepped down from those duties after the conclusion of the 2020 tournament and was replaced by Seema Jaswal. Persad returned as deputy presenter, joined in 2023 by Catrin Heledd from BBC Wales. Commentators have included Willie Thorne, Dennis Taylor, John Virgo, John Parrott, Steve Davis, Ken Doherty, Stephen Hendry, Terry Griffiths and Neal Foulds.

 the BBC holds the broadcast rights to the tournament until 2027, which will be the 100th anniversary of the tournament and the 50th anniversary of its move to the Crucible Theatre.

Since 2003, Eurosport has provided coverage of the snooker season, with commentators including Philip Studd, David Hendon, Joe Johnson and Neal Foulds. For the World Championship, additional commentary from Phil Yates and Dominic Dale is provided. Alan McManus previously provided commentary for Eurosport before moving to the BBC, but now provides punditry services only to Eurosport&#x27;s coverage of the event. In the past, Eurosport provided televised coverage of both tables via Eurosport 1 and Eurosport 2 but has since cut back by only showing the &quot;main&quot; match of the session on Eurosport 1, with the other table available via the Discovery+ and Eurosport Player streaming services. Eurosport currently has the right to show the tournament until 2026.

<doc id="315197" wikidata="Q695886" url="?curid=315197" title="Arnold Beckman">
<text>Arnold Orville Beckman (April 10, 1900 – May 18, 2004) was an American chemist, inventor, investor, and philanthropist. While a professor at California Institute of Technology, he founded Beckman Instruments based on his 1934 invention of the pH meter, a device for measuring acidity (and alkalinity), later considered to have &quot;revolutionized the study of chemistry and biology&quot;. He also developed the DU spectrophotometer, &quot;probably the most important instrument ever developed towards the advancement of bioscience&quot;. Beckman funded the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, the first silicon transistor company in California, thus giving rise to Silicon Valley. In 1965, he retired as president of Beckman Instruments, instead becoming the chairman of its board of directors. On November 23, 1981, he agreed to sell the company, which was then merged with SmithKline to form SmithKline Beckman. After retirement, he and his wife Mabel (1900–1989) were numbered among the top philanthropists in the United States.

==Early life==

Beckman was born in Cullom, Illinois, a village of about 500 people in a farming community. He was the youngest son of George Beckman, a blacksmith, and his second wife Elizabeth Ellen Jewkes. He was curious about the world from an early age. When he was nine, Beckman found an 1868 chemistry textbook, Joel Dorman Steele&#x27;s &quot;Fourteen Weeks in Chemistry&quot;, and began trying out the experiments. His father encouraged his scientific interests by letting him convert a toolshed into a laboratory.

Beckman&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth, died of diabetes in 1912. Beckman&#x27;s father sold his blacksmith shop, and became a travelling salesman for blacksmithing tools and materials. A housekeeper, Hattie Lange, was engaged to look after the Beckman children. Arnold Beckman earned money as a &quot;practice pianist&quot; with a local band, and as an &quot;official cream tester&quot; running a centrifuge for a local store.

In 1914, the Beckman family moved to Normal, located just north of Bloomington, Illinois, so that the young Beckmans could attend University High School in Normal, a &quot;laboratory school&quot; associated with Illinois State University. In 1915 they moved to Bloomington itself, but continued to attend University High, where Arnold Beckman obtained permission to take university level classes from professor of chemistry Howard W. Adams. While still in high school, Arnold started his own business, &quot;Bloomington Research Laboratories&quot;, doing analytic chemistry for the local gas company. He also performed at night as a movie-house pianist, and played with local dance bands. He graduated valedictorian of his class, with an average of 89.41 over four years, the highest attained.

Beckman was allowed to leave school a few months early to contribute to the First World War effort in early 1918 by working as a chemist. At Keystone Steel and Iron he took samples of molten iron and tested them to see if the chemical composition of carbon, sulfur, manganese and phosphorus was suitable for pouring steel.

When Beckman turned 18 in August 1918, he enlisted in the United States Marines. After three months at marine boot camp on Parris Island, South Carolina, he was sent to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, for transit to the war in Europe. Because of a train delay, another unit embarked in place of Beckman&#x27;s unit. Then, counted into groups in the barracks, Beckman missed being sent to Russia by one space in line. Instead, Arnold spent Thanksgiving at the local YMCA, where he met 17-year-old Mabel Stone Meinzer, who was helping to serve the meal. Mabel would become his wife. A few days later, the armistice was signed, ending the war.

==University education==
Beckman attended the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign beginning in the fall of 1918. During his freshman year, he worked with Carl Shipp Marvel on the synthesis of organic mercury compounds, but both men became ill from exposure to toxic mercury. As a result, Beckman changed his major from organic chemistry to physical chemistry, where he worked with Worth Rodebush, T. A. White, and Gerhard Dietrichson. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering in 1922 and his master&#x27;s degree in physical chemistry in 1923. For his master&#x27;s degree he studied the thermodynamics of aqueous ammonia solutions, a subject introduced to him by T. A. White.

Soon after arriving at the University of Illinois, Beckman joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. He was initiated into Zeta chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma, the chemistry fraternity, in 1921 and the Gamma Alpha Graduate Scientific Fraternity in December 1922.

Beckman decided to go to California Institute of Technology (Caltech) for his doctorate. He stayed there for a year, before returning to New York to be near his fiancée, Mabel, who was working as a secretary for the Equitable Life Assurance Society. He found a job with Western Electric&#x27;s engineering department, the precursor to the Bell Telephone Laboratories. Working with Walter A. Shewhart, Beckman developed quality control programs for the manufacture of vacuum tubes and learned about circuit design. It was here that Beckman discovered his interest in electronics.

The couple married June 10, 1925and moved back to California in 1926, where Beckman resumed his studies at Caltech. He became interested in ultraviolet photolysis and worked with his doctoral advisor, Roscoe G. Dickinson, on an instrument to find the energy of ultraviolet light. It worked by shining the ultraviolet light onto a thermocouple, converting the incident heat into electricity, which drove a galvanometer. After receiving a Ph.D. in photochemistry in 1928 for this application of quantum theory to chemical reactions, Beckman was asked to stay on at Caltech as an instructor and then as a professor. Linus Pauling, another of Roscoe G. Dickinson&#x27;s graduate students, was also asked to stay on at Caltech.

==Relationship with Caltech==

During his time at Caltech, Beckman was active in teaching at both the introductory and advanced graduate levels. Beckman shared his expertise in glass-blowing by teaching classes in the machine shop. He also taught classes in the design and use of research instruments. Beckman dealt first-hand with the chemists&#x27; need for good instrumentation as manager of the chemistry department&#x27;s instrument shop. Beckman&#x27;s interest in electronics made him very popular within the chemistry department at Caltech, as he was very skilled in building measuring instruments.

Over the time that he was at Caltech, the focus of the department increasingly moved towards pure science and away from chemical engineering and applied chemistry. Arthur Amos Noyes, head of the chemistry division, encouraged both Beckman and chemical engineer William Lacey to be in contact with real-world engineers and chemists, and Robert Andrews Millikan, Caltech&#x27;s president, referred technical questions to Beckman from government and businesses. With their blessing, Beckman began accepting outside work as a scientific and technical consultant. He also acted as a scientific expert in legal trials.

In 1964, he accepted an offer to become chairman of the Caltech Board of Trustees, where he&#x27;d been a member since 1953.

==National Inking Appliance Company==
In 1934, Millikan referred I. H. Lyons from the National Postal Meter Company to Arnold Beckman. Lyons wanted a non-clogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines, instead of having clerks lick stamps. Beckman&#x27;s solution was to make ink with butyric acid, a malodorous substance. Because of this ingredient, no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it. Beckman decided to make it himself. He started the National Inking Appliance Company, obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker Fred Henson and hiring two Caltech students, Robert Barton and Henry Fracker. Beckman developed and took out a couple of patents for re-inking typewriter ribbons, but marketing them was not successful. This was Beckman&#x27;s first experience at running a company and marketing a product, and while this first product failed, Beckman repurposed the company for another product.

==pH Meter==


Sunkist Growers was having problems with its own manufacturing process. Lemons that were not saleable as produce were made into pectin or citric acid, with sulfur dioxide used as a preservative. Sunkist needed to know the acidity of the product at any given time, and the colorimetric methods then in use, such as readings from litmus paper, did not work well because sulfur dioxide interfered with them. Chemist Glen Joseph at Sunkist was attempting to measure the hydrogen-ion concentration in lemon juice electrochemically, but sulfur dioxide damaged hydrogen electrodes, and non-reactive glass electrodes produced weak signals and were fragile.

Joseph approached Beckman, who proposed that instead of trying to increase the sensitivity of his measurements, he amplify his results. Beckman, familiar with glassblowing, electricity, and chemistry, suggested a design for a vacuum-tube amplifier and ended up building a working apparatus for Joseph. The glass electrode used to measure pH was placed in a grid circuit in the vacuum tube, producing an amplified signal which could then be read by an electronic meter. The prototype was so useful that Joseph requested a second unit.

Beckman saw an opportunity, and rethinking the project, decided to create a complete chemical instrument which could be easily transported and used by nonspecialists. By October 1934, he had registered patent application US Patent No. 2,058,761 for his &quot;acidimeter&quot;, later renamed the pH meter. The Arthur H. Thomas Company, a nationally known scientific instrument dealer based in Philadelphia, was willing to try selling it. Although it was priced expensively at $195, roughly the starting monthly wage for a chemistry professor at that time, it was significantly cheaper than the estimated cost of building a comparable instrument from individual components, about $500. The original pH meter weighed in at nearly 7 kg, but was a substantial improvement over a benchful of delicate equipment. The earliest meter had a design glitch, in that the pH readings changed with the depth of immersion of the electrodes, but Beckman fixed the problem by sealing the glass bulb of the electrode.

On April 8, 1935, Beckman renamed his company National Technical Laboratories, formally acknowledging his new focus on the making of scientific instruments. The company rented larger quarters at 3330 Colorado Street, and began manufacturing pH meters. The pH meter is an important device for measuring the pH of a solution, and by 11 May 1939, sales were successful enough that Beckman left Caltech to become the full-time president of National Technical Laboratories. By 1940, Beckman was able to take out a loan to build his own 12,000 square foot factory in South Pasadena.

==Spectrophotometry==

===Ultraviolet===

In 1940, the equipment needed to measure light energy in the visible spectrum could cost a laboratory as much as $3,000, a huge amount at that time. There was also growing interest in examining ultraviolet spectra beyond that range. Just as Beckman had created a single easy-to-use instrument for measuring pH, he made it a goal to create an easy-to-use instrument for spectrophotometry. Beckman&#x27;s research team, led by Howard Cary, developed several models.

The new spectrophotometers used a prism to separate light into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum. They allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance, giving a standardized &quot;fingerprint&quot;, characteristic of a compound. With Beckman&#x27;s model D, later known as the DU spectrophotometer, National Technical Laboratories successfully provided the first easy-to-use single instrument containing both the optical and electronic components needed for ultraviolet-absorption spectrophotometry. The user could insert a sample, dial up the desired wavelength of light, and read the amount of absorption of that frequency from a simple meter. It produced accurate absorption spectra in both the ultraviolet and the visible regions of the spectrum with relative ease and repeatable accuracy. The National Bureau of Standards ran tests to certify that the DU&#x27;s results were accurate and repeatable and recommended its use.

Beckman&#x27;s DU spectrophotometer has been referred to as the &quot;model T&quot; of scientific instruments: &quot;This device forever simplified and streamlined chemical analysis, by allowing researchers to perform a 99.9% accurate quantitative measurement of a substance within minutes, as opposed to the weeks required previously for results of only 25% accuracy.&quot; Theodore L. Brown notes that it &quot;revolutionized the measurement of light signals from samples&quot;. Nobel laureate Bruce Merrifield is quoted as calling the DU spectrophotometer &quot;probably the most important instrument ever developed towards the advancement of bioscience.&quot;

Development of the spectrophotometer also had direct relevance to the war effort. For example, the role of vitamins in health was being studied, and scientists wanted to identify Vitamin A-rich foods to keep soldiers healthy. Previous methods involved feeding rats for several weeks, then performing a biopsy to estimate Vitamin A levels. The DU spectrophotometer yielded better results in a matter of minutes. The DU spectrophotometer was also an important tool for scientists studying and producing the new wonder drug penicillin. By the end of the war, American pharmaceutical companies were producing 650 billion units of penicillin each month. Much of the work done in this area during World War II was kept secret until after the war.

===Infrared===

Beckman and his company were involved in a number of secret projects. There was a critical shortage of rubber, which was used in jeep and airplane tires and in tanks. Natural sources from the Far East were unavailable because of the war, and scientists sought a reliable synthetic substitute. Beckman was approached by the Office of Rubber Reserve about developing an infrared spectrophotometer to aid in the study of chemicals such as toluene and butadiene. The Office of Rubber Reserve met secretly in Detroit with Robert Brattain of the Shell Development Company, Arnold O. Beckman, and R. Bowling Barnes of American Cyanamid. Beckman was asked to secretly produce a hundred infrared spectrophotometers to be used by authorized government scientists, based on a design for a single-beam spectrophotometer which had already been developed by Robert Brattain for Shell. The result was the Beckman IR-1 spectrophotometer.

By September 1942, the first of the instruments was being shipped. Approximately 75 IR-1s were made between 1942 and 1945 for use by the US synthetic-rubber effort. The researchers were not allowed to publish or discuss anything related to the new machines until after the war. Other researchers who were independently pursuing the development of infrared spectrometry, were able to publish and to develop instruments during this time without being affected by secrecy restrictions.

Beckman had continued to develop the infrared spectrophotometer after the release of the IR-1. Facing stiff competition, he decided in 1953 to go forward with a radical redesign of the instrument. The result was the IR-4, which could be operated using either a single or double beam of infrared light. This allowed a user to take both the reference measurement and the sample measurement at the same time.

==Other secret projects==

===Helipot===

At the same time that Beckman was approached about infrared spectrometry, he was contacted by Paul Rosenberg. Rosenberg worked at MIT&#x27;s Radiation Laboratory. The lab was part of a secret network of research institutions in both the United States and Britain that were working to develop radar, &quot;radio detecting and ranging&quot;. The project was interested in Beckman because of the high quality of the tuning knobs or &quot;potentiometers&quot; which were used on his pH meters. Beckman had trademarked the design of the pH meter knobs, under the name &quot;helipot&quot; for &quot;helical potentiometer&quot;. Rosenberg had found that the helipot was more precise, by a factor of ten, than other knobs. Nonetheless, for use in continuously moving airplanes, ships, or submarines, which might be under attack, a redesign would be needed to ensure that the knobs could withstand shocks and vibrations.

Beckman was not allowed to tell his staff the reason behind the redesign, and they were not particularly interested in the problem; he eventually came up with a solution himself. Instead of using a wire wrapped around a coil, with pressure from a small spring to create a single contact point, he redesigned the knob to have a continuous groove, in which the contact point was contained. The contact point could then move smoothly and continuously, and could not be jarred out of contact. Beckman&#x27;s model A Helipot was in tremendous demand by the military. Within the first year of its production, its sales became 40% of the company&#x27;s income. Beckman spun off a separate company, the Helipot Corporation, to take on the electronics component manufactory.

===Pauling oxygen meter===


Linus Pauling at Caltech was also doing secret work for the military. The National Defense Research Committee called a meeting on October 3, 1940, wanting an instrument that could reliably measure oxygen content in a mixture of gases, so that they could measure oxygen conditions in submarines and airplanes. Pauling designed the Pauling oxygen meter for them. Originally approached to supply housing boxes for the meter by Holmes Sturdivant, Pauling&#x27;s assistant, Beckman was soon asked to produce the entire instrument.

While the board of National Technical Laboratories was unwilling to support the secret project, whose details they could not be told, they agreed that Beckman was free to follow up on it independently. Beckman set up a second spinoff company, Arnold O. Beckman, Inc., for their manufacture. Creating the oxygen meter was a technical challenge, involving the creation of tiny, highly precise glass dumbbells. Beckman created a tiny glass-blowing machine which would generate a precisely measured puff of air to create the glass balls.

After the war, Beckman developed oxygen analyzers for another market. They were used to monitor conditions in incubators for premature babies. Doctors at Johns Hopkins University used them to determine recommendations for healthy oxygen levels for incubators.

===Manhattan Project===
Beckman instruments were also used by the Manhattan Project. Scientists in the project were attempting to develop instruments to measure radiation in gas-filled, electrically charged ionization chambers in nuclear reactors. It was difficult to get reliable readings because the signals were weak. Beckman realized that with a relatively minor adjustment – substituting an input-load resistor for the glass electrode – the pH meter could be adapted to do the job. As a result, Beckman Instruments developed a new product, the micro-ammeter.

In addition, Beckman developed a dosimeter for measuring exposure to radiation, to protect personnel of the Manhattan project. The dosimeter was a miniature ionization chamber, charged with 170 volts. It had a small calibrated scale on top, whose needle was a platinum-covered quartz fiber. The dosimeters were also manufactured by Beckman&#x27;s spinoff company, Arnold O. Beckman, Inc.

==Battling smog==
In postwar Southern California, including the area of Pasadena where the Beckmans lived, smog was becoming an increasing topic of conversation, as well as an unpleasant experience. First characterized as &quot;gas attacks&quot; in 1943, suspicion fell on a variety of possible causes including the smudge pots used by orange growers, the smoke produced by local industrial plants, and car exhausts. The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce was one of the organizations concerned about the possible causes and effects of smog, as it related both to industry (and jobs) and to quality of life in the area. Beckman was involved with the Chamber of Commerce.

In 1947, California governor Earl Warren signed a statewide air pollution control act, authorizing the creation of Air Pollution Control Districts (APCDs) in every county of the state. The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce asked Beckman to represent them in dealing with creation of a local APCD. The new APCD, when formed, asked Beckman to become the scientific consultant to the Air Pollution Control Officer. He held the position from 1948 to 1952.

The Air Pollution Control Officer in question was Louis McCabe, a geologist with a background in chemical engineering. McCabe initially suspected that smog was a result of sulfur dioxide pollution, and proposed that the county convert the suspected pollutant into fertilizer through a costly process. Beckman was not convinced that sulfur dioxide was the real culprit behind Los Angeles smog. He visited Gary, Indiana, where steps were being taken to address sulfur dioxide pollution, and was struck by the characteristic smell of sulfur in the air. Returning, Beckman convinced McCabe that they needed to search for a different cause.

Beckman got in touch with a Caltech professor who was working on smog, Arie Jan Haagen-Smit. They developed an apparatus to collect particulate matter from Los Angeles air, using a system of tubing intermittently cooled by liquid nitrogen. Haagen-Smit identified the substance they collected as a peroxy organic material. He agreed to spend a year studying the chemistry of smog. His results, presented in 1952, identified ozone and hydrocarbons from smokestacks, refineries and car exhausts as key ingredients in the formation of smog.

While Haagen-Smit worked out the genesis of smog, Beckman developed an instrument to measure it. On October 7, 1952, he was granted a patent for an &quot;oxygen recorder&quot; that used colorimetric methods to measure the levels of compounds present in the atmosphere. Beckman Instruments eventually developed a range of instruments for various uses in monitoring and treating automobile exhaust and air pollution. They even produced &quot;air quality monitoring vans&quot;, customized laboratories on wheels for use by government and industry.

Beckman himself was approached by California governor Goodwin Knight to head a Special Committee on Air Pollution, to propose ways to combat smog. At the end of 1953, the committee made its findings public. The &quot;Beckman Bible&quot; advised key steps to be taken immediately:
* stopping vapor leaks from refineries and filling stations
* establishing standards for automobile exhausts
* converting from diesel trucks and buses to propane
* asking polluting industries to restrict pollutants or move away from cities
* banning open burning of trash
* developing regional mass transportation

Beckman Instruments also acquired the Liston-Becker Instrument Company in June 1955. Founded by Max D. Liston, Liston-Becker had a successful record in the development of infrared gas analyzers. Liston developed instruments to measure smog and car exhaust emissions, essential to attempts to improve Los Angeles air quality in the 1950s.

Beckman helped to create the Air Pollution Foundation, a non-profit organization to support research on finding solutions to smog, and educating the public about scientific issues related to smog.

In 1954, he became a member of the board of directors of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, and chairman of its Air Pollution Committee. He advocated for stronger powers for the APCD, and encouraged industry, business, and citizens to support for their work. He helped the Chamber of Commerce to develop a unified approach to monitoring smog, broadcasting smog alerts, and addressing the smog problem. On January 25, 1956, he became president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. He identified the two key issues of his term as battling smog, and supporting the collaboration of local science, technology, industry, and education.

Beckman recognized that air quality would not improve overnight. His work with air quality continued for years, and brought him national attention. In 1967, Beckman was appointed to the Federal Air Quality Board for a four-year term, by President Richard Nixon.

==Electronics==
John J. Murdock held substantial stock in National Technical Laboratories. He and Arnold Beckman signed a stock option agreement by which Beckman could purchase Murdock&#x27;s NTL stock from his estate after his death. When Murdock died in 1948, Beckman was able to gain a controlling interest in the company. On April 27, 1950, National Technical Laboratories was renamed Beckman Instruments, Incorporated. In 1952, Beckman Instruments became a publicly traded company on the New York Curb Exchange, generating new capital for expansion, including overseas expansion.

===Cermets===
Helipot Corporation, the spinoff company that Beckman had created when NTL&#x27;s board were dubious about electronics, was reincorporated into Beckman Instruments and became the Helipot Division in 1958. Helipot researchers were experimenting with cermets, composite materials made by mixing ceramics and metals. Potentiometers made with cermet instead of metal were more heat-resistant, suitable for use at extreme temperatures.

===Centrifuges===
In 1954, Beckman Instruments acquired ultracentrifuge maker Spinco (Specialized Instruments Corp.), founded by Edward Greydon Pickels in 1946. This acquisition was the basis of Beckman&#x27;s Spinco centrifuge division. The division went on to design and manufacture a range of preparative and analytical ultracentrifuges.

===Semiconductors===
In 1955, Beckman was contacted by William Shockley. Shockley, who had been one of Beckman&#x27;s students at Caltech, led Bell Labs research program into semiconductor technology. Semiconductors were, in some ways, similar to cermets. Shockley wanted to create a new company, and asked Beckman to serve on the board. After considerable discussion, Beckman became more closely involved: he and Shockley signed a letter of intent to create the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory as a subsidiary of Beckman Instruments, under William Shockley&#x27;s direction. The new group would specialize in semiconductors, beginning with the automated production of diffused-base transistors.

Because Shockley&#x27;s aging mother lived in Palo Alto, Shockley wanted to establish the laboratory in nearby Mountain View, California. Frederick Terman, provost at Stanford University, offered the firm space in Stanford&#x27;s new industrial park. The firm launched in February 1956, the same year that Shockley received the Nobel Prize in Physics along with John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain &quot;for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect&quot;. Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as Silicon Valley.

Shockley, however, lacked experience in business and industrial management. Moreover, he decided that the lab would research an invention of his own, the four-layer diode, rather than developing the diffused silicon transistor that he and Beckman had agreed upon. Beckman was reassured by his engineers that the scientific ideas behind Shockley&#x27;s project were still sound. When appealed to by members of Shockley&#x27;s lab, Beckman chose not to interfere with its management. In 1957, eight leading scientists including Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce left Shockley&#x27;s group to form a competing startup, Fairchild Semiconductor, which would successfully develop silicon transistors. In 1960, Beckman sold the Shockley subsidiary to the Clevite Transistor Company, ending his formal association with semiconductors. Nonetheless, Beckman had been an essential backer of the new industry in its initial stages.

===Computers and automation===
Beckman also saw that computers and automation offered a myriad of opportunities for integration into instruments, and the development of new instruments. Beckman Instruments purchased Berkeley Scientific Company in the 1950s, and later developed a Systems Division within Beckman Instruments &quot;to develop and build industrial data systems for automation&quot;. Berkeley developed the EASE analog computer, and by 1959 Beckman had contracts with major companies in the aerospace, space, and defense industries, including Boeing Aerospace, Lockheed Aircraft, North American Aviation, and Lear Siegler. 

The Beckman Systems Division also developed specialized computer systems to handle large volumes of telemetric radio data from satellites and uncrewed spacecraft. These included systems to process photographs of the Moon, taken by NASA&#x27;s Ranger spacecraft.

==Philanthropy==
The Beckmans became increasingly active as philanthropists, with the stated intention of giving away their personal wealth before their deaths. 

Their first major philanthropic gift went to Caltech. In supporting Caltech, they expanded on the long-term relationship that Beckman had begun as a student at Caltech, and continued as a teacher and trustee. In 1962, they funded the construction of a concert hall, the Beckman Auditorium, designed by architect Edward Durrell Stone. Over a period of years, they also supported the Beckman Institute, Beckman Auditorium, Beckman Laboratory of Behavioral Sciences, and Beckman Laboratory of Chemical Synthesis at the California Institute of Technology. In the words of Caltech&#x27;s president emeritus David Baltimore, Beckman &quot;has shaped the destiny of Caltech.&quot; The Beckmans are also named in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology and the Beckman Quadrangle at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

The Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation was incorporated in September 1977. At the time of Beckman&#x27;s death, the Foundation had given more than 400 million dollars to a variety of charities and organizations. In 1990, it was considered one of the top ten foundations in California, based on annual gifts. Donations chiefly went to scientists and scientific causes as well as Beckman&#x27;s &quot;alma maters&quot;. He is quoted as saying, &quot;I accumulated my wealth by selling instruments to scientists ... so I thought it would be appropriate to make contributions to science, and that&#x27;s been my number one guideline for charity.&quot;

In the 1980s, they funded five major centers:
* Beckman Research Institute (BRI) at the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California, United States.
* Beckman Laser Institute, University of California, Irvine, in Irvine, California
* Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign
* Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine at Stanford University, Stanford, California
* Beckman Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California

The Beckmans also gave to:
* The Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry at the Chemical Heritage Foundation (now the Science History Institute), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
* The Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center of the National Academies of Science and Engineering, in Irvine, CA (1988)
* The Pepperdine University School of Business &amp; Management&#x27;s MBA program (1988)

After Mabel&#x27;s death in 1989, Arnold Beckman reorganized the foundation to continue in perpetuity, and developed new initiatives for the foundation&#x27;s giving.

A major focus became the improvement of science education. Beginning in 1998 the Foundation has provided over $23 million to support K-6 hands-on, research-based science education to school districts in Orange County, California, stimulating schools to integrate science into the K-6 curriculum as a core subject.

Arnold Beckman envisioned the Beckman Scholars and Beckman Young Investigators programs to support young scientists at the university level. Each year, the Beckman Foundation selects a list of universities and colleges, each of which selects student from its institution for the Beckman Scholars Program. The Beckman Young Investigators Program provides research support to promising faculty members in the early stages of academic careers in the chemical and life sciences, particularly those whose work involves methods, instruments and materials that may open up new avenues of research in science. In 2017, the Beckman Postdoctoral Fellows award was launched, similarly aimed at supporting promising young postdoctoral scholars in their chemistry or chemical instrumentation research. 

The Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation also supports vision research through its Beckman Initiative in Macular Research and the Beckman-Argyros Award in Vision Research. Supported activities include research into laser surgery and macular degeneration.

==Awards and honors==
In 1971, Beckman was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science (Sc.D.) degree from Whittier College.

Arnold Beckman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1976. In 1982, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Asteroid 3737 Beckman was named after Arnold O. Beckman in 1983. Beckman was inducted into the Junior Achievement US Business Hall of Fame in 1985. In 1987, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio. In 2004 he received its Lifetime Achievement Award.

Beckman was awarded the National Medal of Technology in 1988. It is the highest honor the United States can confer to a US citizen for achievements related to technological progress President George H. W. Bush presented Beckman with the National Medal of Science Award in 1989, &quot;for his leadership in the development of analytical instrumentation and for his deep and abiding concern for the vitality of the nation&#x27;s scientific enterprise.&quot;. He had previously been recognized by the Reagan administration as one of about 30 citizens receiving the 1989 Presidential Citizens Medal for exemplary deeds of service.

In 1989, Beckman received the Charles Lathrop Parsons Award for public service from the American Chemical Society.
He was awarded the Order of Lincoln, the state of Illinois&#x27; highest honor, by The Lincoln Academy of Illinois in 1991. In 1996, Beckman was inducted into the Alpha Chi Sigma Hall of Fame. He was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1999. In 2000, he received a Special Millennium Edition of the Othmer Gold Medal from the Chemical Heritage Foundation in recognition of his multifaceted contributions to chemical and scientific heritage.

The Arnold O. Beckman High School in Irvine, California which has a focus in science education, was named in honor of Arnold O. Beckman. It was not, however, funded by Beckman. The Beckman Coulter Heritage exhibit, which discusses the work of scientists Arnold Beckman and Wallace Coulter, is located at the Beckman Coulter headquarters in Brea, California.

==Personal life==
Beckman married Mabel on June 10, 1925. In 1933, the Beckmans built a home in Altadena, California, in the foothills and adjacent to Pasadena where they lived for over 27 years, raising their family. After Mabel found out she was unable to conceive a child, the couple decided to adopt children, adopting a three year old daughter Gloria Patricia in 1936 and the next year an infant son they named Arnold Stone. Mabel fell in love with a house by the sea in Corona del Mar near Newport Beach, California. They bought the house in 1960, renovated it, and lived there together until Mabel&#x27;s death in 1989. Arnold Beckman died May 18, 2004, at the age of 104, in hospital in La Jolla, Calif. Mabel and Arnold Beckman are buried beneath a simple headstone in West Lawn Cemetery in Cullom, Illinois, the small town where he was born.

<text>Bionomics (Greek: bio = life; nomos = law) has two different meanings: 
* the first is the comprehensive study of an organism and its relation to its environment. As translated from the French word &quot;Bionomie&quot;, its first use in English was in the period of 1885–1890. Another way of expressing this word is the term currently referred to as &quot;ecology&quot;.
* the other is an economic discipline which studies economy as a self-organized evolving ecosystem.

An example of studies of the first type is in Richard B. Selander&#x27;s &quot;Bionomics, Systematics and Phylogeny of &quot;Lytta&quot;, a Genus of Blister Beetles (Coleoptera, Meloidae)&quot;, Illinois Biological Monographs: number 28, 1960.

When related to the territory Ignegnoli talks about Landscape Bionomics, defining Landscape as the &quot;level of biological organization integrating complex systems of plants, animals and humans in a living Entity recognizable in a territory as characterized by suitable emerging properties in a determined spatial configuration&quot;. (Ingegnoli, 2011, 2015; Ingegnoli, Bocchi, Giglio, 2017)

Bionomics as an economic discipline is used by Igor Flor of &quot;Bionomica, the International Bionomics Institute&quot;

<text>In parliamentary procedure, a voice vote (from the Latin &quot;viva voce&quot;, meaning &quot;by live voice&quot;) or acclamation is a voting method in deliberative assemblies (such as legislatures) in which a group vote is taken on a topic or motion by responding vocally. 

Despite not being the same thing, voice votes and votes by viva voce are often confused because they have the same Latin roots. Voice votes gather the vocal response of the full assembly at once whereas viva voce are often done by roll call and record the response and name of the individual voters.

The voice vote is considered the simplest and quickest of voting methods used by deliberative assemblies. The presiding officer or chair of the assembly will put the question to the assembly, asking first for all those in favor of the motion to indicate so orally (&quot;aye&quot; or &quot;yea&quot;), and then ask second all those opposed to the motion to indicate so verbally (&quot;no&quot; or &quot;nay&quot;). The chair will then make an estimate of the count on each side and state what they believe the result to be.

Voice votes have inherent disadvantages and the method has major shortfalls in close contests. The volume of the voices are typically only estimated and not actually measured with sound level meters, giving a chair enough plausible deniability to falsify the result if they disagree with it; even if such a vote can be objectively quantified in terms of decibels, the method gives an unfair advantage to those who have louder voices. The need to make an audible signal also compromises any situation in which a secret ballot may be desired. The method is suitable in most cases where unanimity is required. If there is any doubt as to the outcome, any member of the assembly may request another vote by a method such as division of the assembly (a standing or rising vote), or a roll call vote. Voice votes are usually not recorded, but sometimes are.

Voice votes are also used in non-governmental settings, such as battles of the bands and spectator sports where a most valuable player, Man of the Match or Best in Show award is chosen by the audience.

== Ancient Greece ==
Methods of voice voting were employed in ancient Greece as early as seventh century BC. The election of the members of the Gerousia, Sparta&#x27;s Council of Elders, was conducted by shouting. From the assembly, few persons were selected and locked up in a room close to the election, so that they could only hear the noise of the audience, but not see the candidate put to vote. The candidates were then presented to the assembly one after another without speaking a word. The favor of the assembly towards one candidate was assessed by the selected persons who established a ranking of all candidates with respect to the loudness of the assembly. Those candidates who have received the most and loudest acclamations were eventually elected.

==Australia==
Members vote by saying &quot;aye&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, and the Speaker of the House (or President of the Senate) judges the result. If two or more members demand a recorded vote, known as a division, one must be held.

==Canada==
Members vote by saying &quot;yea&quot; or &quot;nay&quot;, and the Speaker judges the mood of the House. If five or more members demand a recorded vote, one must be held.

==New Zealand==
The initial decision on any question is by voice vote, members saying &quot;aye&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, and the Speaker declaring which side has won. Members of the losing side (or abstainers), but not supporters of the side declared to have won, are entitled to demand a formal test of opinion.

==India==
The voice vote (ध्वनि मत) is used in the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha and state assemblies to vote for certain resolutions. It is used when there is a wide agreement on issues and in some cases where the house is not in order. It was used during the formation of the Indian state of Telangana in 2014.

==United Kingdom==
A voice vote is held to decide if a bill can progress through to the next stage.

The Speaker of the House of Commons will then propose the question by saying, for example (second reading): &quot;The Question is, that the Bill be now read a second time&quot;. The Speaker then invites supporters of the bill to say &quot;aye&quot; and then opponents say &quot;no&quot;: &quot;As many as are of that opinion say &#x27;aye&#x27; [supporters say &#x27;aye&#x27;], of the contrary &#x27;no&#x27; [opponents say &#x27;no&#x27;]&quot;. In what is known as &quot;collecting the voices&quot; the Speaker makes a judgement as to the louder cry. A clear majority either way will prompt the response &quot;I think the Ayes/Noes have it. The Ayes/Noes have it!&quot; (this can be forced to a division by continued cries either way). If the result is at all in doubt a division will be called and the speaker will say &quot;Division, Clear the Lobbies!&quot;

In the House of Lords, the Lord Speaker will propose the question by saying, for example (second reading): &quot;The Question is, that the Bill be now read a second time&quot;. The Lord Speaker then does similarly to the Commons Speaker, by saying, &quot;As many as are of that opinion say &#x27;Content&#x27; [supporters say &#x27;Content&#x27;] and of the contrary &#x27;Not Content&#x27; [opponents say &#x27;Not Content].&quot; The Lord Speaker then decides. In the result of a division, the Lord Speaker will say &quot;Division. Clear the Bar&quot;.

==United States==
&quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; (11th edition) provides that:
In Congress, &quot;the vast majority of actions decided by a voice vote&quot; are ones for which &quot;a strong or even overwhelming majority favors one side,&quot; or even unanimous consent. Members can request a division of the assembly (a rising vote, where each sides rise in turn to be counted), and one-fifth of members can demand a recorded vote on any question, after the chair announces the result of a voice vote.

It is estimated that more than 95 percent of the resolutions passed by state legislatures are passed by a unanimous voice vote, many without discussion; this is because resolutions are often on routine, noncontroversial matters, such as commemorating important events or recognizing groups.

==Other methods==
* Humming is used as a voice vote method at the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) to estimate the participants&#x27; positions on some issues.

<text>The Therac-25 is a computer-controlled radiation therapy machine produced by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) in 1982 after the Therac-6 and Therac-20 units (the earlier units had been produced in partnership with of France).

The Therac-25 was involved in at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, in which some patients were given massive overdoses of radiation. Because of concurrent programming errors (also known as race conditions), it sometimes gave its patients radiation doses that were hundreds of times greater than normal, resulting in death or serious injury. These accidents highlighted the dangers of software control of safety-critical systems. 

The Therac-25 has become a standard case study in health informatics, software engineering, and computer ethics. It highlights the dangers of engineer overconfidence after the engineers dismissed end-user reports, leading to severe consequences.

== History ==

The French company CGR manufactured the &quot;Neptune&quot; and &quot;Sagittaire&quot; linear accelerators.

In the early 1970s, CGR and the Canadian public company &quot;Atomic Energy of Canada Limited&quot; (AECL) collaborated on the construction of linear accelerators controlled by a DEC PDP-11 minicomputer: the Therac-6, which produced X-rays of up to 6 MeV, and the Therac-20, which could produce X-rays or electrons of up to 20 MeV. The computer increased ease of use because the accelerator could operate without it. CGR developed the software for the Therac-6 and reused some subroutines for the Therac-20.

In 1981, the two companies ended their collaboration agreement. AECL developed a new double pass concept for electron acceleration in a more confined space, changing its energy source from klystron to magnetron. In certain techniques, the electrons produced are used directly, while in others they are made to collide against a tungsten anode to produce X-ray beams. This dual accelerator concept was applied to the Therac-20 and Therac-25, with the latter being much more compact, versatile, and easy to use. It was also more economical for a hospital to have a dual machine that could apply treatments of electrons and X-rays, instead of two machines.

The Therac-25 was designed as a machine controlled by a computer, with some safety mechanisms switched from hardware to software as a result. AECL decided not to duplicate some safety mechanisms, and reused modules and code routines from the Therac-20 for the Therac-25.

The first prototype of the Therac-25 was built in 1976 and was put on the market in late 1982.

The software for the Therac-25 was developed by one person over several years using PDP-11 assembly language. It was an evolution of the Therac-6 software. In 1986, the programmer left AECL. In a subsequent lawsuit, lawyers were unable to identify the programmer or learn about his qualification and experience.

Five machines were installed in the United States and six in Canada.

After the accidents, in 1988 AECL dissolved the &quot;AECL Medical&quot; section and the company &quot;Theratronics International Ltd&quot; took over the maintenance of the installed Therac-25 machines.

The machine had three modes of operation, with a turntable moving some apparatus into position for each of those modes: either a light, some &quot;scan magnets&quot;, or a tungsten target and &quot;flattener&quot;.
* A &quot;field light&quot; mode, which allowed the patient and collimator to be correctly positioned by illuminating the treatment area with visible light.
* Direct electron-beam therapy, in which a narrow, low-current beam of high-energy () electrons was scanned over the treatment area by magnets;
* Megavolt X-ray (or photon) therapy, which delivered a beam of 25 MeV X-ray photons. The X-ray photons are produced by colliding a high current, narrow beam of electrons with a tungsten target. The X-rays are then passed through a flattening filter, and then measured using an X-ray ion chamber. The flattening filter resembles an inverted ice-cream cone, and it shapes and attenuates the X-rays. The electron beam current required to produce the X-rays is about 100 times greater than that used for electron therapy.

The patient is placed on a fixed stretcher. Above them is a turntable to which the components that modify the electron beam are fixed. The turntable has a position for the X-ray mode (photons), another position for the electron mode and a third position for making adjustments using visible light. In this position an electron beam is not expected, and a light that is reflected in a stainless steel mirror simulates the beam. In this position there is no ion chamber acting as a radiation dosimeter because the radiation beam is not expected to function.

The turntable has some microswitches that indicate the position to the computer. When the plate is in one of the three allowed fixed positions a plunger locks it by interlocking. In this type of machine, electromechanical locks were traditionally used to ensure that the turntable was in the correct position before starting treatment. In the Therac-25, these were replaced by software checks.

== Problem description ==

The six documented accidents occurred when the high-current electron beam generated in X-ray mode was delivered directly to patients. Two software faults were to blame. One was when the operator incorrectly selected X-ray mode before quickly changing to electron mode, which allowed the electron beam to be set for X-ray mode without the X-ray target being in place. A second fault allowed the electron beam to activate during field-light mode, during which no beam scanner was active or target was in place.

Previous models had hardware interlocks to prevent such faults, but the Therac-25 had removed them, depending instead on software checks for safety.

The high-current electron beam struck the patients with approximately 100 times the intended dose of radiation, and over a narrower area, delivering a potentially lethal dose of beta radiation. The feeling was described by patient Ray Cox as &quot;an intense electric shock&quot;, causing him to scream and run out of the treatment room. Several days later, radiation burns appeared, and the patients showed the symptoms of radiation poisoning; in three cases, the injured patients later died as a result of the overdose.

==Radiation overexposure incidents==

=== Kennestone Regional Oncology Center, 1985 ===
A Therac-25 had been in operation for six months in Marietta, Georgia at the Kennestone Regional Oncology Center when, on June 3, 1985, applied radiation therapy treatment following a lumpectomy was being performed on 61-year-old woman Katie Yarbrough. She was set to receive a 10-MeV dose of electron therapy to her clavicle. When therapy began, she stated she experienced a &quot;tremendous force of heat...this red-hot sensation.&quot; The technician entered the room, to whom Katie stated, &quot;you burned me.&quot; The technician assured her this was not possible. She returned home where, in the following days, she experienced reddening of the treatment area. Shortly after, her shoulder became locked in place and she experienced spasms. Within two weeks, the aforementioned redness spread from her chest to her back, indicating that the source of the burn had passed through her, which is the case with radiation burns. The staff at the treatment center did not believe it was possible for the Therac-25 to cause such an injury, and it was treated as a symptom of her cancer. Later, the hospital physicist consulted the AECL about the incident. He calculated that the applied dose was between 15,000 and 20,000 rad (radiation absorbed dose) when she should have been dosed with 200 rad. A dose of 1000 rad can be fatal. In October 1985, Katie sued the hospital and the manufacturer of the machine. In November 1985, the AECL was notified of the lawsuit. It was not until March 1986, after another incident involving the Therac-25, that the AECL informed the FDA that it had received a complaint from the patient.

Due to the radiation overdose, her breast had to be surgically removed, an arm and shoulder were immobilized, and she was in constant pain. The treatment printout function was not activated at the time of treatment and there was no record of the applied radiation data. An out-of-court settlement was reached to resolve the lawsuit.

=== Ontario Cancer Foundation, 1985 ===

The Therac-25 had been in operation in the clinic for six months when, on July 26, 1985, a 40-year-old patient was receiving her 24th treatment for cervical cancer. The operator activated the treatment, but after five seconds the machine stopped with the error message &quot;H-tilt&quot;, the treatment pause indication and the dosimeter indicating that no radiation had been applied. The operator pressed the key (Proceed : continue). The machine stopped again. The operator repeated the process five times until the machine stopped the treatment. A technician was called and found no problem. The machine was used to treat six other patients on the same day.

The patient complained of burning and swelling in the area and was hospitalized on July 30. She was suspected of a radiation overdose and the machine was taken out of service. On November 3, 1985, the patient died of cancer, although the autopsy mentioned that if she had not died then, she would have had to undergo a hip replacement due to damage from the radiation overdose. A technician estimated that she received between 13,000 and 17,000 rad.

The incident was reported to the FDA and the Canadian Radiation Protection Bureau.

The AECL suspected that there might be an error with three microswitches that reported the position of the turntable. The AECL was unable to replicate a failure of the microswitches and microswitch testing was inconclusive. They then changed the method to be tolerant of one failure and modified the software to check if the turntable was moving or in the treatment position.

Afterward, the AECL claimed that the modifications represented a five-order-of-magnitude increase in safety.

=== Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital, 1985 ===

In December 1985 a woman developed an erythema with a parallel band pattern after receiving treatment from a Therac-25 unit. Hospital staff sent a letter on January 31, 1986, to the AECL about the incident. The AECL responded in two pages detailing the reasons why radiation overdose was impossible on the Therac-25, stating both machine failure and operator error were not possible.

Six months later, the patient developed chronic ulcers under the skin due to tissue necrosis. She had surgery and skin grafts were placed. The patient continued to live with minor sequelae.

=== East Texas Cancer Center, Tyler, March 1986 ===

Over two years, this hospital treated more than 500 patients with the Therac-25 with no incident. On March 21, 1986, a patient presented for his ninth treatment session for a tumor on his back. The treatment was set to be 22-MeV of electrons with a dose of 180 rad in an area of 10x17 cm, with an accumulated radiation in 6 weeks of 6000 rad.

The experienced operator entered the session data and realized that she had written an “x” for ‘x-ray’ instead of an “e” for ‘electron beam’ as the type of treatment. With the cursor she went up and changed the “x” to an “e” and since the rest of the parameters were correct she pressed until she got down to the command box. All parameters were marked &quot;Verified&quot; and the message &quot;Rays ready&quot; was displayed. She hit the key (&quot;Beam on&quot;). The machine stopped and displayed the message &quot;Malfunction 54&quot; (error 54). It also showed &#x27;Treatment pause&#x27;. The manual said that the &quot;Malfunction 54&quot; message was a &quot;dose input 2&quot; error. A technician later testified that &quot;dose input 2&quot; meant that the radiation delivered was either too high or too low.

The radiation monitor (dosimeter) marked 6 units supplied when it had demanded 202 units. The operator pressed ( Proceed : continue). The machine stopped again with the message &quot;Malfunction 54&quot; (error 54) and the dosimeter indicated that it had delivered fewer units than required. The surveillance camera in the radiation room was offline and the intercom had been broken that day.

With the first dose the patient felt an electric shock and heard a crackle from the machine. Since it was his ninth session, he realized that it was not normal. He started to get up from the table to ask for help. At that moment the operator pressed to continue the treatment. The patient felt a shock of electricity through his arm, as if his hand was torn off. He reached the door and began to bang on it until the operator opened it. A physician was immediately called to the scene, where they observed intense erythema in the area, suspecting that it had been a simple electric shock. He sent the patient home. The hospital physicist checked the machine and, because it was calibrated to the correct specification, it continued to treat patients throughout the day. The technicians were unaware that the patient had received a massive dose of radiation between 16,500 and 25,000 rads in less than a second over an area of one cm2. The crackling of the machine had been produced by saturation of the ionization chambers, which had the consequence that they indicated that the applied radiation dose had been very low.

Over the following weeks the patient experienced paralysis of the left arm, nausea, vomiting, and ended up being hospitalized for radiation-induced myelitis of the spinal cord. His legs, mid-diaphragm and vocal cords ended up paralyzed. He also had recurrent herpes simplex skin infections. He died five months after the overdose.

From the day after the accident, AECL technicians checked the machine and were unable to replicate error 54. They checked the grounding of the machine to rule out electric shock as the cause. The machine was back in operation on April 7, 1986.

=== East Texas Cancer Center, Tyler, April 1986 ===

On April 11, 1986, a patient was to receive electron treatment for skin cancer on the face. The prescription was 10 MeV for an area of 7x10 cm. The operator was the same as the one in the March incident, three weeks earlier. After filling in all the treatment data she realized that she had to change the mode from X to E. She did so and pressed to go down to the command box. As &quot;Beam ready&quot; was displayed, she pressed (Proceed : continue). The machine produced a loud noise, which was heard through the intercom. Error 54 was displayed. The operator entered the room and the patient described a burning sensation on his face. The patient died on May 1, 1986, just shy of 3 weeks later. The autopsy showed severe radiation damage to the right temporal lobe and brain stem.

The hospital physicist stopped the machine treatments and notified the AECL. After strenuous work, the physicist and operator were able to reproduce the error 54 message. They determined that speed in editing the data entry was a key factor in producing error 54. After much practice, he was able to reproduce the error 54 at will. The AECL stated they could not reproduce the error and they only got it after following the instructions of the physicist so that the data entry was very rapid.

=== Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital, 1987 ===

On January 17, 1987, a patient was to receive a treatment with two film-verification exposures of 4 and 3 rads, plus a 79-rad photon treatment for a total exposure of 86 rads. Film was placed under the patient and 4 rads were administered through a 22 cm × 18 cm opening. The machine was stopped, the aperture was opened to 35 cm × 35 cm and a dose of 3 rad was administered. The machine stopped. The operator entered the room to remove the film plates and adjust the patient&#x27;s position. He used the hand control inside the room to adjust the turntable. He left the room, forgetting the film plates. In the control room, after seeing the &quot;Beam ready&quot; message, he pressed the key to fire the beams. After 5 seconds the machine stopped and displayed a message that quickly disappeared. Since the machine was paused, the operator pressed (Proceed : continue). The machine stopped, showing &quot;Flatness&quot; as the reason. The operator heard the patient on the intercom, but could not understand him, and entered the room. The patient had felt a severe burning sensation in his chest. The screen showed that he had only been given 7 rad. A few hours later, the patient showed burns on the skin in the area. Four days later the reddening of the area had a banded pattern similar to that produced in the incident the previous year, and for which they had not found the cause. The AECL began an investigation, but was unable to reproduce the event.

The hospital physicist conducted tests with film plates to see if he could recreate the incident, which involved two X-ray parameters with the turntable in field-light position. The film appeared to match the film that was left by mistake under the patient during the accident. It was found the patient was exposed to between 8,000 and 10,000 rad instead of the prescribed 86 rad. The patient died in April 1987 from complications due to radiation overdose. The relatives filed a lawsuit that ended with an out-of-court settlement.

== Root causes ==
A commission attributed the primary cause to generally poor software design and development practices, rather than singling out specific coding errors. In particular, the software was designed so that it was realistically impossible to test it in a rigorous, automated way.

Researchers who investigated the accidents found several contributing causes. These included the following institutional causes:
* AECL did not have the software code independently reviewed and chose to rely on in-house code, including the operating system.
* AECL did not consider the design of the software during its assessment of how the machine might produce the desired results and what failure modes existed, focusing purely on hardware and asserting that the software was free of bugs.
* Machine operators were reassured by AECL personnel that overdoses were impossible, leading them to dismiss the Therac-25 as the potential cause of many incidents.
* AECL had never tested the Therac-25 with the combination of software and hardware until it was assembled at the hospital.

The researchers also found several engineering issues:
* Several error messages merely displayed the word &quot;MALFUNCTION&quot; followed by a number from 1 to 64. The user manual did not explain or even address the error codes, nor give any indication that these errors could pose a threat to patient safety.
* The system distinguished between errors that halted the machine, requiring a restart, and errors which merely paused the machine (which allowed operators to continue with the same settings using a keypress). However, some errors which endangered the patient merely paused the machine, and the frequent occurrence of minor errors caused operators to become accustomed to habitually unpausing the machine.
** One failure occurred when a particular sequence of keystrokes was entered on the VT100 terminal that controlled the PDP-11 computer: If the operator were to press &quot;X&quot; to (erroneously) select 25 MeV photon mode, then use &quot;cursor up&quot; to edit the input to &quot;E&quot; to (correctly) select 25 MeV Electron mode, then &quot;Enter&quot;, all within eight seconds of the first keypress and well within the capability of an experienced user of the machine, the edit would not be processed and an overdose could be administered. These edits were not noticed as it would take 8 seconds for startup, so it would go with the default setup.
* The design did not have any hardware interlocks to prevent the electron-beam from operating in its high-energy mode without the target in place.
* The engineer had reused software from the Therac-6 and Therac-20, which used hardware interlocks that masked their software defects. Those hardware safeties had no way of reporting that they had been triggered, so preexisting errors were overlooked.
* The hardware provided no way for the software to verify that sensors were working correctly. The table-position system was the first implicated in Therac-25&#x27;s failures; the manufacturer revised it with redundant switches to cross-check their operation.
* The software set a flag variable by incrementing it, rather than by setting it to a fixed non-zero value. Occasionally an arithmetic overflow occurred, causing the flag to return to zero and the software to bypass safety checks.

Leveson notes that a lesson to be drawn from the incident is to not assume that reused software is safe: &quot;A naive assumption is often made that reusing software or using commercial off-the-shelf software will increase safety because the software will have been exercised extensively. Reusing software modules does not guarantee safety in the new system to which they are transferred ...&quot; In response to incidents like those associated with Therac-25, the IEC 62304 standard was created, which introduces development life cycle standards for medical device software and specific guidance on using software of unknown pedigree.

<text>Vespula is a small genus of social wasps, widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere. Along with members of their sister genus &quot;Dolichovespula&quot;, they are collectively known by the common name yellowjackets (or yellow jackets) in North America. &quot;Vespula&quot; species have a shorter oculomalar space (shown in the figure below right) and a more pronounced tendency to nest underground than &quot;Dolichovespula&quot;.

==Venom==
The venom of &quot;Vespula&quot; is mostly composed of antigen 5, hyaluronidase, and phospholipase.

===Immunology===
A high degree of similarity occurs between immunogenic fractions of different &quot;Vespula&quot; species. Rabbit serum antibodies are unable to distinguish between them.

<doc id="315221" wikidata="Q2304554" url="?curid=315221" title="Suquamish">
<text>The Suquamish () are a Lushootseed-speaking Native American people, located in present-day Washington in the United States. They are a southern Coast Salish people.

Today, most Suquamish people are enrolled in the federally recognized Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port Madison Reservation, a signatory to the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott. Chief Seattle, the famous leader of the Suquamish and Duwamish Tribes for whom the City of Seattle is named, signed the Point Elliot Treaty on behalf of both Tribes. The Suquamish Tribe owns the Port Madison Indian Reservation.

==Language and culture ==
Suquamish people traditionally speak a dialect of Lushootseed, which belongs to the Salishan language family.

Like many Northwest Coast indigenous peoples pre-European contact, the Suquamish enjoyed the rich bounty of land and sea west of the Cascade Mountains. They fished for salmon and harvested shellfish in local waters and Puget Sound. The cedar tree provided fiber used to weave waterproof clothing and beautiful utilitarian items, and provided wood for longhouses, seagoing canoes and ceremonial items.

The Suquamish traditionally lived on the western shores of Puget Sound, from Apple Tree Cove in the north to Gig Harbor in the south, including Bainbridge Island and Blake Island. They had villages throughout the region, the largest centered on Old Man House, the largest winter longhouse in the Salish Sea and the largest longhouse ever known.

The Suquamish continue to fish and harvest in their traditional territory, and a new generation of local artists — among them Ed Carriere — carry on the ways of their ancestors in creating carved or woven items that help tell the story of the Suquamish people.

In 2011, the Suquamish Tribal Council voted unanimously to approve same-sex marriage.

==History==
The first contact between Suquamish and European people came in 1792 when George Vancouver explored Puget Sound and met members of the Suquamish Tribe, possibly including Schweabe and Kitsap. More regular contact with non-Natives came with the establishment of British trading posts in Puget Sound and the Strait of Georgia in the early 19th century.

Once the Washington Territory was established in 1853, the U.S. government began signing treaties with area indigenous leaders to extinguish aboriginal claims and make land available for non-Native settlement. In the Point Elliott Treaty signed on January 22, 1855, the Suquamish agreed to cede land to the United States in exchange for certain payments and obligations. They reserved for themselves the land that became designated as the Port Madison Indian Reservation, near their winter village on Agate Pass. They also reserved the right to fish and harvest shellfish in their Usual and Accustomed Areas, and reserved certain cultural and natural resource rights within their historical territory. Today, the Suquamish Tribe is a co-manager with the State of Washington of the state&#x27;s salmon fishery.

==Leaders and notable people==
Two members of the Suquamish came to be recognized across the region as great leaders. One was Kitsap, who led a coalition of Puget Sound Tribes against the Cowichan Tribes of Vancouver Island around 1825. Another was Seattle (also spelled Si-ahl, Sealth, See-ahth, and Seathl, pronounced ), son of Schweabe, who was a peacekeeper during the turbulent times of the mid-19th century.

Martha George served as chairwoman of the Suquamish Tribe from the late 1920s to the early 1940s.

Lawrence Webster (1899–1991) served as chairman of the Suquamish Tribe from 1979 to 1985. In 1979, he traveled to Washington, D.C., to represent Native Americans at an event commemorating the 15th anniversary of the government program VISTA. In 1983, he helped establish the Suquamish Museum. Earlier in his life, he was a noted baseball catcher, playing on a Suquamish team in 1921 that was sent by a national sporting goods company on a goodwill tour of Japan.

Leonard Forsman, an anthropologist and archeologist who has served as the Suquamish Tribe&#x27;s chairman since 2005, is a governor-appointed member of the state Board on Geographic Names and an Obama appointee to the U.S. Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. In October 2021, Washington state governor Jay Inslee appointed Forsman to serve as a member on the University of Washington&#x27;s Board of Regents. Forsman&#x27;s term on the board expires on June 30, 2027.

Cindy Webster-Martinson, a former Suquamish Tribal Council member, is vice president of the North Kitsap School Board (elected in 2013 to a four-year term) and is believed to be the first Native American elected to non-Tribal public office in Kitsap County. She is a granddaughter of Lawrence Webster.

==Governance==
The Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port Madison Reservation is governed by a seven-member council, elected by citizens of the Suquamish Tribe. As of July 2024, the Suquamish Tribal Council is as follows:

* Chairman: Leonard Forsman
* Vice-chairman: Josh Bagley
* Secretary: Irene Carpenter
* Treasurer: Denita Holmes
* Council Member: Luther &quot;Jay&quot; Mills
* Council Member: Azure Boure
* Council Member: Lorilee Morsette

Government departments include administration, child support enforcement, community development, court, early learning center, education, fisheries, human services, legal, natural resources, and police. The Tribe contracts with local fire districts for fire protection service.

==Economy==
Port Madison Enterprises, the Tribe&#x27;s economic development arm, is the second-largest private-sector employer in Kitsap County with 752 employees, surpassed only by Harrison Medical Center.

Port Madison Enterprises is governed by a seven-member board of directors, which includes a Tribal Council liaison. Notable ventures include the Suquamish Clearwater Casino Resort, White Horse Golf Club, Kiana Lodge, PME Retail, and Property Management. Ongoing subsidiaries include the Port Madison Enterprises Construction Corporation.

Economic contributions (in 2012): $52.2 million in wages and benefits paid to employees; $46.8 million in goods and services purchased; $18.6 million in capital project investment. Community contributions (in 2012): $694,033 awarded to 201 organizations.

The PME Fund sets aside non-gaming funds for distribution as grants to organizations that &quot;[improve] the lives of community members&quot; and &quot;support worthy programs in the region&quot;.

==Reservation==

The Tribe has reacquired land lost during the allotment era, and &quot;the Tribe and Tribal members now own more than half of the land on the reservation for the first time in recent history&quot;. Major acquisitions include White Horse Golf Club in 2010, placed into trust in March 2014; and 200 acres known as the Place of the Bear, in the Cowling Creek watershed, in November 2014.

As of 2014, the reservation area consists of 7,657 acres, of which 1,475 acres are owned by the Suquamish Tribe, 2,601 acres are owned by individual citizens of the Suquamish Tribe, and 3,581 acres are owned by non-Natives.

<doc id="315232" wikidata="Q6888525" url="?curid=315232" title="Moderation">
<text>Moderation is the process or trait of eliminating, lessening, or avoiding extremes. It is used to ensure normality throughout the medium on which it is being conducted. Common uses of moderation include:
* A way of life emphasizing perfect amounts of everything, not indulging in too much of one thing.
* A moderator may remove unsuitable contributions from the website, forum or chat room they represent in accordance with their moderation system.
* Ensuring consistency and accuracy in the marking of student assessments.
* A &quot;moderator&quot; is one name for the formal position of one who presides over a discussion, helping to ensure that the discussion is balanced among its many voices, for example in the Methodist church&#x27;s use of the term for the heads of its conferences.
* A neutron moderator is used to slow down neutrons in a nuclear reactor.

== History ==

=== Ancient Greece ===

Moderation is also a principle of life. In ancient Greece, the temple of Apollo at Delphi bore the inscription ()—&quot;Nothing in excess&quot;. Doing something &quot;in moderation&quot; means not doing it excessively. For instance, someone who moderates their food consumption tries to eat all food groups, but limits their intake of those that may cause deleterious effects to harmless levels.

According to the historian and sociologist of science Steven Shapin:
=== Christianity ===

In Christianity, &quot;moderationism&quot; is the position that drinking alcoholic beverages temperately is permissible, though drunkenness is forbidden (see Christianity and alcohol).

In the apocryphal Book of Wisdom moderation is listed among the greatest virtues.

===Islam and Judaism===

Wasat, also called () is the Arabic word for &quot;best&quot;, &quot;middle&quot;, &quot;centered&quot;, &quot;balanced&quot;. In the Islamic context, it refers to the &quot;middle way&quot; or &quot;moderation&quot;—a justly balanced way of life, avoiding extremes and experiencing things in moderation. 
Moderate Muslims use contextual relativism to interpret the Quran.

The Jewish philosopher Maimonides, who was heavily influenced by Islamic and Aristotelian thought, also set forth moderation as an ideal within Judaism.

=== Taoism ===

Moderation is considered a key part of one&#x27;s personal development in Chinese Taoist philosophy and religion. It is one of the three jewels of Taoist thought. There is nothing that cannot be moderated including one&#x27;s actions, one&#x27;s desires, and even one&#x27;s thoughts. It is believed that by doing so one achieves a more natural state, faces less resistance in life, and recognises one&#x27;s limits. Moderation as a guiding principle is complex and can be difficult to not only accept, but also understand and implement. It can also be recursive in that one should moderate how much one moderates (i.e. to not be too worried about moderating everything or not to try too hard to find the perfect middle ground)

Moderation as a principle of Taoist philosophy turns up in all three of its main texts. 

=== Others ===

Moderation is a characteristic of the Swedish national psyche, more specifically described by the Swedish synonym .

<text>Ethyl Eichelberger (July 17, 1945 – August 12, 1990) was an Obie award-winning American drag performer, playwright, and actor. He became an influential figure in experimental theater and writing, and wrote nearly forty plays portraying women such as Jocasta, Medea, Nefertiti, Clytemnestra, and Lucrezia Borgia. He became more widely known as a commercial actor in the 1980s.

==Biography==
Ethyl Eichelberger was born on July 17, 1945, in Pekin, Illinois to Amish Mennonite parents. He attended Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois and graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City in 1967. For seven years he was the lead character actor at the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, Rhode Island. He then returned to New York, changed his name to &quot;Ethyl&quot;, and became a member of Charles Ludlam&#x27;s Ridiculous Theatrical Company, acting and designing wigs. At the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, Eichelberger met Black-Eyed Susan (actor), who became a close friend. In 1987 he wrote his play &quot;Saint Joan&quot; for Black-Eyed Susan, following the death of Charles Ludlam.

Eichelberger&#x27;s plays were performed in almost any space that might pass as a stage in New York City during the height of the East Village performance bar scene of the 1980s. Among the venues at which they were produced are the Pyramid Club, King Tut&#x27;s Wah Wah Hut, and 8 B.C., and later at more established venues such as P.S. 122, Dixon Place, La Mama, the Performing Garage, and Dance Theatre Workshop. Eichelberger also took productions of his plays on tour to such far away places as Australia and Europe.

He often performed solo works in free verse based on the lives of the &quot;grandes dames&quot; of history, including Lucrezia Borgia, Jocasta, Medea, Lola Montez, Nefertiti, Clytemnestra, and Carlotta, Empress of Mexico. &quot;I wanted to play the great roles but who would cast me as Medea?&quot;, he mused late in life in &quot;Extreme Exposure: An Anthology of Solo Performance Texts from the Twentieth Century.&quot; His 1984 play &quot;Leer&quot; distilled Shakespears&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; into 3 characters, all played by Eichelberger. Such works are rarely revived, as they require a solo performer capable of accompanying himself on the accordion, eating fire, turning cartwheels, and doing splits and other acrobatic feats.

He became more widely known as a commercial actor in the 1980s, appearing with The Flying Karamazov Brothers on Broadway in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;, and with Sting in &quot;The Threepenny Opera.&quot; He also appeared as a cast member of the HBO variety series &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;.

On August 12, 1990, he committed suicide by slashing his wrists in his Staten Island home. Only after his suicide did it become widely known that he was diagnosed with AIDS two years prior and had become unable to tolerate the side effects of the medication and the debilitating effects of the disease.

In 2005, P.S. 122 awarded the first Ethyl Eichelberger Award to Taylor Mac.

<doc id="315239" wikidata="Q392316" url="?curid=315239" title="First Nations in Canada">
<text>First Nations () is a term used to identify Indigenous peoples in Canada who are neither Inuit nor Métis. Traditionally, First Nations in Canada were peoples who lived south of the tree line, and mainly south of the Arctic Circle. There are 634 recognized First Nations governments or bands across Canada. Roughly half are located in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia.

Under Charter jurisprudence, First Nations are a &quot;designated group&quot;, along with women, visible minorities, and people with physical or mental disabilities. First Nations are not defined as a visible minority by the criteria of Statistics Canada.

North American indigenous peoples have cultures spanning thousands of years. Some of their oral traditions accurately describe historical events, such as the Cascadia earthquake of 1700 and the 18th-century Tseax Cone eruption. Written records began with the arrival of European explorers and colonists during the Age of Discovery in the late 15th century. European accounts by trappers, traders, explorers, and missionaries give important evidence of early contact culture. In addition, archeological and anthropological research, as well as linguistics, have helped scholars piece together an understanding of ancient cultures and historic peoples.

==Terminology==

Collectively, First Nations (Indians), Inuit, and Métis peoples constitute Indigenous peoples in Canada, Indigenous peoples of the Americas, or &quot;first peoples&quot;. &quot;First Nation&quot; as a term became officially used by the government beginning in 1980s to replace the term &quot;Indian band&quot; in referring to groups of Indians with common government and language. The First Nations people had begun to identify by this term during 1970s activism, in order to avoid using the word &quot;Indian&quot;, which some considered offensive. No legal definition of the term exists.

Some Indigenous peoples in Canada have also adopted the term &quot;First Nation&quot; to replace the word &quot;band&quot; in the formal name of their community. A band is a &quot;body of Indians (a) for whose use and benefit in common lands ... have been set apart, (b) ... moneys are held ... or (c) declared ... to be a band for the purposes of&quot;, according to the &quot;Indian Act&quot; by the Canadian Crown.

The term &quot;Indian&quot; is a misnomer, given to Indigenous peoples of North America by European explorers who erroneously thought they had landed in the East Indies. The use of the term &quot;Native Americans&quot;, which the government and others have adopted in the United States, is not common in Canada. It refers more specifically to the Indigenous peoples residing within the boundaries of the US. The parallel term &quot;Native Canadian&quot; is not commonly used, but &quot;Native&quot; (in English) and (in Canadian French; from the Greek , own, and , land) are. Under the Royal Proclamation of 1763, also known as the &quot;Indian &quot;Magna Carta,&quot;&quot; the Crown referred to Indigenous peoples in British territory as tribes or nations. The term &quot;First Nations&quot; is capitalized. Bands and nations may have slightly different meanings.

Within Canada, the term &quot;First Nations&quot; has come into general use for Indigenous peoples other than Inuit and Métis. Outside Canada, the term can refer to Indigenous Australians, U.S. tribes within the Pacific Northwest, as well as supporters of the Cascadian independence movement. The singular, commonly used on culturally politicized reserves, is the term &quot;First Nations person&quot; (when gender-specific, &quot;First Nations man&quot; or &quot;First Nations woman&quot;). Since the late 20th century, members of various nations more frequently identify by their tribal or national identity only, e.g., &quot;I&#x27;m Haida&quot;, or &quot;We&#x27;re Kwantlens&quot;, in recognition of the distinct First Nations.

==History==
===Nationhood===
:&quot;First Nations by linguistic-cultural area: List of First Nations peoples&quot;
First Nations peoples had settled and established trade routes across what is now Canada by 500 BCE – 1,000 CE. Communities developed, each with its own culture, customs, and character. In the northwest were the Athapaskan-speaking peoples, Slavey, Tłı̨chǫ, Tutchone-speaking peoples, and Tlingit. Along the Pacific coast were the Haida, Tsimshian, Salish, Kwakiutl, Nuu-chah-nulth, Nisga&#x27;a and Gitxsan. In the plains were the Blackfoot, Kainai, Sarcee and Northern Peigan. In the northern woodlands were the Cree and Chipewyan. Around the Great Lakes were the Anishinaabe, Algonquin, Iroquois and Wyandot. Along the Atlantic coast were the Beothuk, Maliseet, Innu, Abenaki and Mi&#x27;kmaq.

The Blackfoot Confederacy resides in the Great Plains of Montana and Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan. The name &quot;Blackfoot&quot; came from the dye or paint on the bottoms of their leather moccasins. One account claimed that the Blackfoot Confederacies walked through the ashes of prairie fires, which in turn blackened the bottoms of their moccasins. They had migrated onto the Great Plains (where they followed bison herds and cultivated berries and edible roots) from the area of now eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. Historically, they allowed only legitimate traders into their territory, making treaties only when the bison herds were exterminated in the 1870s.

Pre-contact Squamish history is passed on through oral tradition of the Squamish indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Prior to colonization and the introduction of writing had only oral tradition as a way to transmit stories, law, and knowledge across generations. The writing system established in the 1970s uses the Latin alphabet as a base. Knowledgeable elders have the responsibility to pass historical knowledge to the next generation. People lived and prospered for thousands of years until the Great Flood. In another story, after the Flood, they repopulated from the villages of Schenks and Chekwelp, located at Gibsons. When the water lines receded, the first Squamish came to be. The first man, named Tseḵánchten, built his longhouse in the village, and later on another man named Xelálten, appeared on his longhouse roof and sent by the Creator, or in the Squamish language . He called this man his brother. It was from these two men that the population began to rise and the Squamish spread back through their territory.

The Iroquois influence extended from northern New York into what are now southern Ontario and the Montreal area of modern Quebec. The Iroquois Confederacy is, from oral tradition, formed circa 1142. Adept at cultivating the Three Sisters (maize/beans/squash), the Iroquois became powerful because of their confederacy. Gradually the Algonquians adopted agricultural practises enabling larger populations to be sustained.

The Assiniboine were close allies and trading partners of the Cree, engaging in wars against the Gros Ventres alongside them, and later fighting the Blackfoot. A Plains people, they went no further north than the North Saskatchewan River and purchased a great deal of European trade goods through Cree middlemen from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The lifestyle of this group was semi-nomadic, and they followed the herds of bison during the warmer months. They traded with European traders, and worked with the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara tribes.

In the earliest oral history, the Algonquins were from the Atlantic coast. Together with other Anicinàpek, they arrived at the &quot;First Stopping Place&quot; near Montreal. While the other Anicinàpe peoples continued their journey up the St. Lawrence River, the Algonquins settled along the Ottawa River (), an important highway for commerce, cultural exchange, and transportation. A distinct Algonquin identity, though, was not realized until after the dividing of the Anicinàpek at the &quot;Third Stopping Place&quot;, estimated at 2,000 years ago near present-day Detroit.

According to their tradition, and from recordings in birch bark scrolls (), Ojibwe (an Algonquian-speaking people) came from the eastern areas of North America, or Turtle Island, and from along the east coast. They traded widely across the continent for thousands of years and knew of the canoe routes west and a land route to the west coast. According to the oral history, seven great (radiant/iridescent) beings appeared to the peoples in the to teach the peoples of the way of life. One of the seven great beings was too spiritually powerful and killed the peoples in the when the people were in its presence. The six great beings remained to teach while the one returned into the ocean. The six great beings then established (clans) for the peoples in the east. Of these , the five original Anishinaabe were the (Bullhead), (Echo-maker, i.e., Crane), (Pintail Duck), (Tender, i.e., Bear) and (Little Moose), then these six beings returned into the ocean as well. If the seventh being stayed, it would have established the Thunderbird .

The Nuu-chah-nulth are one of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. The term &quot;Nuu-chah-nulth&quot; is used to describe fifteen separate but related First Nations, such as the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations, Ehattesaht First Nation and Hesquiaht First Nation whose traditional home is on the west coast of Vancouver Island. In pre-contact and early post-contact times, the number of nations was much greater, but smallpox and other consequences of contact resulted in the disappearance of groups, and the absorption of others into neighbouring groups. The Nuu-chah-nulth are relations of the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw, the Haisla, and the Ditidaht. The Nuu-chah-nulth language is part of the Wakashan language group.

In 1999 the discovery of the body of Kwäday Dän Ts&#x27;ìnchi provided archaeologists with significant information on indigenous tribal life prior to extensive European contact. Kwäday Dän Ts&#x27;ìnchi (meaning &quot;Long Ago Person Found&quot; in Southern Tutchone), or &quot;Canadian Ice Man&quot;, is a naturally mummified body that a group of hunters found in Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park in British Columbia. Radiocarbon dating of artifacts found with the body placed the age of the find between 1450 AD and 1700 AD. Genetic testing showed that he was a member of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations.

===European contact===
Aboriginal people in Canada interacted with Europeans as far back as 1000 AD, but prolonged contact came only after Europeans established permanent settlements in the 17th and 18th centuries. European written accounts noted friendliness on the part of the First Nations, who profited in trade with Europeans. Such trade strengthened the more organized political entities such as the Iroquois Confederation. The Aboriginal population is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million in the late 15th century. The effect of European colonization was a 40 to 80 percent Aboriginal population decrease post-contact. This is attributed to various factors, including repeated outbreaks of European infectious diseases such as influenza, measles and smallpox (to which they had not developed immunity), inter-nation conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with colonial authorities and settlers and loss of land and a subsequent loss of nation self-suffiency. For example, during the late 1630s, smallpox killed more than half of the Huron, who controlled most of the early fur trade in what became Canada. Reduced to fewer than 10,000 people, the Huron Wendat were attacked by the Iroquois, their traditional enemies. In the Maritimes, the Beothuk disappeared entirely.

There are reports of contact made before Christopher Columbus between the first peoples and those from other continents.
Even in Columbus&#x27; time there was much speculation that other Europeans had made the trip in ancient or contemporary times; Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés records accounts of these in his &quot;General y natural historia de las Indias&quot; of 1526, which includes biographical information on Columbus. Aboriginal first contact period is not well defined. The earliest accounts of contact occurred in the late 10th century, between the Beothuk and Norsemen. According to the Sagas of Icelanders, the first European to see what is now Canada was Bjarni Herjólfsson, who was blown off course en route from Iceland to Greenland in the summer of 985 or 986 CE. The first European explorers and settlers of what is now Canada relied on the First Nations peoples, for resources and trade to sustain a living. The first written accounts of interaction show a predominantly Old world bias, labelling the indigenous peoples as &quot;savages&quot;, although the indigenous peoples were organized and self-sufficient. In the early days of contact, the First Nations and Inuit populations welcomed the Europeans, assisting them in living off the land and joining forces with the French and British in their various battles. It was not until the colonial and imperial forces of Britain and France established dominant settlements and, no longer needing the help of the First Nations people, began to break treaties and force them off the land that the antagonism between the two groups grew.

===16th–18th centuries===
The Portuguese Crown claimed that it had territorial rights in the area visited by Cabot. In 1493 Pope Alexander VI – assuming international jurisdiction – had divided lands discovered in America between Spain and Portugal. The next year, in the Treaty of Tordesillas, these two kingdoms decided to draw the dividing line running north–south, 370 leagues (from approximately depending on the league used) west of the Cape Verde Islands. Land to the west would be Spanish, to the east Portuguese. Given the uncertain geography of the day, this seemed to give the &quot;new founde isle&quot; to Portugal. On the 1502 Cantino map, Newfoundland appears on the Portuguese side of the line (as does Brazil). An expedition captured about 60 Aboriginal people as slaves who were said to &quot;resemble gypsies in colour, features, stature and aspect; are clothed in the skins of various animals ...They are very shy and gentle, but well formed in arms and legs and shoulders beyond description ...&quot; Some captives, sent by Gaspar Corte-Real, reached Portugal. The others drowned, with Gaspar, on the return voyage. Gaspar&#x27;s brother, Miguel Corte-Real, went to look for him in 1502, but also failed to return.

In 1604 King Henry IV of France granted Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons a fur-trade monopoly. Dugua led his first colonization expedition to an island located near to the mouth of the St. Croix River. Samuel de Champlain, his geographer, promptly carried out a major exploration of the northeastern coastline of what is now the United States. Under Samuel de Champlain, the Saint Croix settlement moved to Port Royal (today&#x27;s Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia), a new site across the Bay of Fundy, on the shore of the Annapolis Basin, an inlet in western Nova Scotia. Acadia became France&#x27;s most successful colony to that time. The cancellation of Dugua&#x27;s fur monopoly in 1607 ended the Port Royal settlement. Champlain persuaded First Nations to allow him to settle along the St. Lawrence, where in 1608 he would found France&#x27;s first permanent colony in Canada at Quebec City. The colony of Acadia grew slowly, reaching a population of about 5,000 by 1713. New France had cod-fishery coastal communities, and farm economies supported communities along the St. Lawrence River. French &quot;voyageurs&quot; travelled deep into the hinterlands (of what is today Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba, as well as what is now the American Midwest and the Mississippi Valley), trading with First Nations as they went – guns, gunpowder, cloth, knives, and kettles for beaver furs. The fur trade kept the interest in France&#x27;s overseas colonies alive, yet only encouraged a small colonial population, as minimal labour was required. The trade also discouraged the development of agriculture, the surest foundation of a colony in the New World.

According to David L. Preston, after French colonisation with Champlain &quot;the French were able to settle in the depopulated St. Lawrence Valley, not directly intruding on any Indian nation&#x27;s lands. This geographic and demographic fact presents a striking contrast to the British colonies&#x27; histories: large numbers of immigrants coming to New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the Carolinas all stimulated destructive wars over land with their immediate Indian neighbors...Settlement patterns in New France also curtailed the kind of relentless and destructive expansion and land-grabbing that afflicted many British colonies.&quot;

====The Métis====

The Métis (from French &quot;métis&quot; – &quot;mixed&quot;) are descendants of unions between Cree, Ojibwe, Algonquin, Saulteaux, Menominee and other First Nations in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries and Europeans, mainly French. The Métis were historically the children of French fur traders and Nehiyaw women or, from unions of English or Scottish traders and Northern Dene women (Anglo-Métis). The Métis spoke or still speak either Métis French or a mixed language called Michif. &quot;Michif&quot;, &quot;Mechif&quot; or &quot;Métchif&quot; is a phonetic spelling of the Métis pronunciation of &quot;Métif&quot;, a variant of &quot;Métis&quot;. The Métis predominantly speak English, with French a strong second language, as well as numerous Aboriginal tongues. Métis French is best preserved in Canada, Michif in the United States, notably in the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation of North Dakota, where Michif is the official language of the Métis that reside on this Chippewa reservation. The encouragement and use of Métis French and Michif is growing due to outreach within the five provincial Métis councils after at least a generation of steep decline. Canada&#x27;s Indian and Northern Affairs define Métis to be those persons of mixed First Nation and European ancestry.

====Colonial wars====


Allied with the French, the first nations of the Wabanaki Confederacy of Acadia fought six colonial wars against the British and their native allies (See the French and Indian Wars, Father Rale&#x27;s War and Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War). In the second war, Queen Anne&#x27;s War, the British conquered Acadia (1710). The sixth and final colonial war between the nations of France and Great Britain (1754–1763), resulted in the French giving up their claims and the British claimed the lands of Canada (New France).

In this final war, the Franco-Indian alliance brought together Americans, First Nations and the French, centred on the Great Lakes and the Illinois Country. The alliance involved French settlers on the one side, and on the other side were the Abenaki, Odawa, Menominee, Ho-Chunk (Winnebago), Mississaugas, Illiniwek, Huron-Petun, Potawatomi etc. It allowed the French and the Indians to form a haven in the middle-Ohio valley before the open conflict between the European powers erupted.

In the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the British recognized the treaty rights of the indigenous populations and resolved to only settle those areas purchased lawfully from the indigenous peoples. Treaties and land purchases were made in several cases by the British, but the lands of several indigenous nations remain unceded and/or unresolved.

====Slavery====
First Nations routinely captured slaves from neighbouring tribes. Sources report that the conditions under which First Nations slaves lived could be brutal, with the Makah tribe practising death by starvation as punishment and Pacific coast tribes routinely performing ritualized killings of slaves as part of social ceremonies into the mid-1800s. Slave-owning tribes of the fishing societies, such as the Yurok and Haida lived along the coast from what is now Alaska to California. Fierce warrior indigenous slave-traders of the Pacific Northwest Coast raided as far south as California. Slavery was hereditary, the slaves and their descendants being considered prisoners of war. Some tribes in British Columbia continued to segregate and ostracize the descendants of slaves as late as the 1970s. Among Pacific Northwest tribes about a quarter of the population were slaves.

The citizens of New France received slaves as gifts from their allies among First Nations peoples. Slaves were prisoners taken in raids against the villages of the Fox nation, a tribe that was an ancient rival of the Miami people and their Algonquian allies.
Native (or &quot;pani&quot;, a corruption of Pawnee) slaves were much easier to obtain and thus more numerous than African slaves in New France, but were less valued. The average native slave died at 18, and the average African slave died at 25 (the average European could expect to live until the age of 35). By 1790 the abolition movement was gaining ground in Canada and the ill intent of slavery was evidenced by an incident involving a slave woman being violently abused by her slave owner on her way to being sold in the United States. The Act Against Slavery of 1793 legislated the gradual abolition of slavery: no slaves could be imported; slaves already in the province would remain enslaved until death, no new slaves could be brought into Upper Canada, and children born to female slaves would be slaves but must be freed at age 25. The act remained in force until 1833 when the British Parliament&#x27;s Slavery Abolition Act finally abolished slavery in all parts of the British Empire. Historian Marcel Trudel has documented 4,092 recorded slaves throughout Canadian history, of which 2,692 were Aboriginal people, owned by the French, and 1,400 blacks owned by the British, together owned by approximately 1,400 masters. Trudel also noted 31 marriages took place between French colonists and Aboriginal slaves.

====1775–1815====
British agents worked to make the First Nations into military allies of the British, providing supplies, weapons, and encouragement. During the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) most of the tribes supported the British. In 1779, the Americans launched a campaign to burn the villages of the Iroquois in New York State. The refugees fled to Fort Niagara and other British posts, with some remaining permanently in Canada. Although the British ceded the Old Northwest to the United States in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, it kept fortifications and trading posts in the region until 1795. The British then evacuated American territory, but operated trading posts in British territory, providing weapons and encouragement to tribes that were resisting American expansion into such areas as Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin. Officially, the British agents discouraged any warlike activities or raids on American settlements, but the Americans became increasingly angered, and this became one of the causes of the War of 1812.

In the war, the great majority of First Nations supported the British, and many fought under the aegis of Tecumseh. But Tecumseh died in battle in 1813 and the Indian coalition collapsed. The British had long wished to create a neutral Indian state in the American Old Northwest, and made this demand as late as 1814 at the peace negotiations at Ghent. The Americans rejected the idea, the British dropped it, and Britain&#x27;s Indian allies lost British support. In addition, the Indians were no longer able to gather furs in American territory. Abandoned by their powerful sponsor, Great Lakes-area natives ultimately assimilated into American society, migrated to the west or to Canada, or were relocated onto reservations in Michigan and Wisconsin. Historians have unanimously agreed that the Indians were the major losers in the War of 1812.

===19th century===
Living conditions for Indigenous people in the prairie regions deteriorated quickly. Between 1875 and 1885, settlers and hunters of European descent contributed to hunting the North American bison almost to extinction; the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway brought large numbers of European settlers west who encroached on Indigenous territory. European Canadians established governments, police forces, and courts of law with different foundations from indigenous practices. Various epidemics continued to devastate Indigenous communities. All of these factors had a profound effect on Indigenous people, particularly those from the plains who had relied heavily on bison for food and clothing. Most of those nations that agreed to treaties had negotiated for a guarantee of food and help to begin farming. Just as the bison disappeared (the last Canadian hunt was in 1879), Lieutenant-Governor Edgar Dewdney cut rations to indigenous people in an attempt to reduce government costs. Between 1880 and 1885, approximately 3,000 Indigenous people starved to death in the North-West Territories.

Offended by the concepts of the treaties, Cree chiefs resisted them. Big Bear refused to sign Treaty 6 until starvation among his people forced his hand in 1882. His attempts to unite Indigenous nations made progress. In 1884 the Métis (including the Anglo-Métis) asked Louis Riel to return from the United States, where he had fled after the Red River Rebellion, to appeal to the government on their behalf. The government gave a vague response. In March 1885, Riel, Gabriel Dumont, and Honoré Jackson (a.k.a. Will Jackson) set up the Provisional Government of Saskatchewan, believing that they could influence the federal government in the same way as they had in 1869. The North-West Rebellion of 1885 was a brief and unsuccessful uprising by the Métis people of the District of Saskatchewan under Riel against the Dominion of Canada, which they believed had failed to address their concerns for the survival of their people. In 1884, 2,000 Cree from reserves met near Battleford to organize into a large, cohesive resistance. Discouraged by the lack of government response but encouraged by the efforts of the Métis at armed rebellion, Wandering Spirit and other young militant Cree attacked the small town of Frog Lake, killing Thomas Quinn, an Indian agent, and eight others. Although Big Bear actively opposed the attacks, he was charged and tried for treason and sentenced to three years in prison. After the Red River Rebellion of 1869–1870, Métis moved from Manitoba to the District of Saskatchewan, where they founded a settlement at Batoche on the South Saskatchewan River. 

In Manitoba settlers from Ontario began to arrive. They pushed for land to be allotted in the square concession system of English Canada, rather than the seigneurial system of strips reaching back from a river which the Métis were familiar with in their French-Canadian culture.

====Colonization and assimilation====
The history of colonization is complex, varied according to the time and place. France and Britain were the main colonial powers involved, though the United States also began to extend its territory at the expense of indigenous people as well.

From the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged First Nations to assimilate into the European-based culture, referred to as &quot;Canadian culture&quot;. The assumption was that this was the &quot;correct&quot; culture because the Canadians of European descent saw themselves as dominant, and technologically, politically and culturally superior. There was resistance against this assimilation and many businesses denied European practices. The Tecumseh Wigwam of Toronto, for example, did not adhere to the widely practiced Lord&#x27;s Day observance, making it a popular spot, especially on Sundays. Moreover, Canadian policies were at times contradictory, such as through the late 19th century-Peasant Farm Policy that severely restricted farming on reserves, despite this practice being seen as important to assimilation efforts. These kinds of attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Founded in the 19th century, the Canadian Indian residential school system was intended to force the assimilation of Aboriginal and First Nations people into European-Canadian society. The purpose of the schools, which separated children from their families, has been described by commentators as &quot;killing the Indian in the child.&quot;
Funded under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, a branch of the federal government, the schools were run by churches of various denominations – about 60% by Roman Catholics, and 30% by the Anglican Church of Canada and the United Church of Canada, along with its pre-1925 predecessors, Presbyterian, Congregationalist and Methodist churches.

The attempt to force assimilation involved punishing children for speaking their own languages or practising their own faiths, leading to allegations in the 20th century of cultural genocide and ethnocide. There was widespread physical and sexual abuse. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of tuberculosis, and death rates of up to 69%. Details of the mistreatment of students had been published numerous times throughout the 20th century, but following the closure of the schools in the 1960s, the work of indigenous activists and historians led to a change in the public perception of the residential school system, as well as official government apologies, and a (controversial) legal settlement.

Colonization had a significant impact on First Nations diet and health. According to the historian Mary-Ellen Kelm, &quot;inadequate reserve allocations, restrictions on the food fishery, overhunting, and over-trapping&quot; alienated First Nations from their traditional way of life, which undermined their physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health.

===20th century===

As Canadian ideas of progress evolved around the start of the 20th century, the federal Indian policy was directed at removing Indigenous people from their communal lands and encouraging assimilation. Amendments to the &quot;Indian Act&quot; in 1905 and 1911 made it easier for the government to expropriate reserve lands from First Nations. The government sold nearly half of the Blackfoot reserve in Alberta to settlers.

When the Kainai (Blood) Nation refused to accept the sale of their lands in 1916 and 1917, the Department of Indian Affairs held back funding necessary for farming until they relented. In British Columbia, the McKenna–McBride Royal Commission was created in 1912 to settle disputes over reserve lands in the province. The claims of Indigenous people were ignored, and the commission allocated new, less valuable lands (reserves) for First Nations.

Those nations who managed to maintain their ownership of good lands often farmed successfully. Indigenous people living near the Cowichan and Fraser rivers, and those from Saskatchewan managed to produce good harvests. Since 1881, those First Nations people living in the prairie provinces required permits from Indian Agents to sell any of their produce. Later the government created a pass system in the old Northwest Territories that required indigenous people to seek written permission from an Indian Agent before leaving their reserves for any length of time. Indigenous people regularly defied those laws, as well as bans on Sun Dances and potlatches, in an attempt to practice their culture.

The or Natural Resources Acts was part of a shift acknowledging indigenous rights. It enabled provincial control of Crown land and allowed Provincial laws regulating game to apply to Indians, but it also ensured that &quot;Indians shall have the right ... of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the said Indians may have a right of access.&quot;

===First and Second World Wars===

More than 6,000 First Nations, Inuit and Métis served with British forces during First World War and Second World War. A generation of young native men fought on the battlefields of Europe during the Great War and approximately 300 of them died there. When Canada declared war on Germany on September 10, 1939, the native community quickly responded to volunteer. Four years later, in May 1943, the government declared that, as British subjects, all able Indian men of military age could be called up for training and service in Canada or overseas.

===Late 20th century===
Following the end of the Second World War, laws concerning First Nations in Canada began to change, albeit slowly. The federal prohibition of potlatch and Sun Dance ceremonies ended in 1951. Provincial governments began to accept the right of Indigenous people to vote. In June 1956, section 9 of the &quot;Citizenship Act&quot; was amended to grant formal citizenship to Status Indians and Inuit, retroactively as of January 1947.

In 1960, First Nations people received the right to vote in federal elections without forfeiting their Indian status. By comparison, Native Americans in the United States had been allowed to vote since the 1920s.

====1969 White Paper====

In his 1969 White Paper, then-Minister of Indian Affairs, Jean Chrétien, proposed the abolition of the &quot;Indian Act&quot; of Canada, the rejection of Aboriginal land claims, and the assimilation of First Nations people into the Canadian population with the status of &quot;other ethnic minorities&quot; rather than as a distinct group.

Harold Cardinal and the Indian Chiefs of Alberta responded with a document entitled &quot;Citizens Plus&quot; but commonly known as the &quot;Red Paper&quot;. In it, they explained Status Indians&#x27; widespread opposition to Chrétien&#x27;s proposal. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the Liberals began to back away from the 1969 White Paper, particularly after the Calder case decision in 1973. After the Canadian Supreme Court recognized that indigenous rights and treaty rights were not extinguished, a process was begun to resolve land claims and treaty rights and is ongoing today.

====Health transfer policy====

In 1970, severe mercury poisoning, called Ontario Minamata disease, was discovered among Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation and Wabaseemoong Independent Nations people, who lived near Dryden, Ontario. There was extensive mercury pollution caused by Dryden Chemicals Company&#x27;s waste water effluent in the Wabigoon-English River system. Because local fish were no longer safe to eat, the Ontario provincial government closed the commercial fisheries run by the First Nation people and ordered them to stop eating local fish. Previously it had made up the majority of their diet. In addition to the acute mercury poisoning in northwestern Ontario, Aamjiwnaang First Nation people near Sarnia, Ontario, experienced a wide range of chemical effects, including severe mercury poisoning. They suffered low birth rates, skewed birth-gender ratio, and health effects among the population. This led to legislation and eventually the Indian Health Transfer Policy that provided a framework for the assumption of control of health services by First Nations people, and set forth a developmental approach to transfer centred on the concept of self-determination in health. Through this process, the decision to enter into transfer discussions with Health Canada rests with each community. Once involved in transfer, communities are able to take control of health programme responsibilities at a pace determined by their individual circumstances and health management capabilities.

The capacity, experience and relationships developed by First Nations as a result of health transfer was a factor that assisted the creation of the First Nations Health Authority in British Columbia.

====Elijah Harper and the Meech Lake Accord====

In 1981, Elijah Harper, a Cree from Red Sucker Lake, Manitoba, became the first &quot;Treaty Indian&quot; in Manitoba to be elected as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. In 1990, Harper achieved national fame by holding an eagle feather as he refused to accept the Meech Lake Accord, a constitutional amendment package negotiated to gain Quebec&#x27;s acceptance of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, but also one that did not address any First Nations grievances. The accord was negotiated in 1987 without the input of Canada&#x27;s Aboriginal peoples. The third, final constitutional conference on Aboriginal peoples was also unsuccessful. The Manitoba assembly was required to unanimously consent to a motion allowing it to hold a vote on the accord, because of a procedural rule. Twelve days before the ratification deadline for the Accord, Harper began a filibuster that prevented the assembly from ratifying the accord. Because Meech Lake failed in Manitoba, the proposed constitutional amendment failed. Harper also opposed the Charlottetown Accord in 1992, even though Assembly of First Nations Chief Ovide Mercredi supported it.

====Women&#x27;s status and Bill C-31====

According to the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, status Indian women who married men who were not status Indians lost their treaty status, and their children would not get status. However, in the reverse situation, if a status Indian man married a woman who was not a status Indian, the man would keep his status and his children would also receive treaty status. In the 1970s, the Indian Rights for Indian Women and Native Women&#x27;s Association of Canada groups campaigned against this policy because it discriminated against women and failed to fulfill treaty promises. They successfully convinced the federal government to change the section of the act with the adoption of Bill C-31 on June 28, 1985. Women who had lost their status and children who had been excluded were then able to register and gain official Indian status. Despite these changes, status Indian women who married men who were not status Indians could pass their status on only one generation: their children would gain status, but (without a marriage to a full-status Indian) their grandchildren would not. A status Indian man who married a woman who was not a status Indian retained status as did his children, but his wife did not gain status, nor did his grandchildren.

Bill C-31 also gave elected bands the power to regulate who was allowed to reside on their reserves and to control development on their reserves. It abolished the concept of &quot;enfranchisement&quot; by which First Nations people could gain certain rights by renouncing their Indian status.

====Erasmus–Dussault commission====

In 1991, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney created the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples chaired by René Dussault and Georges Erasmus. Their 1996 report proposed the creation of a government for (and by) the First Nations that would be responsible within its own jurisdiction, and with which the federal government would speak on a &quot;Nation-to-Nation&quot; basis. This proposal offered a far different way of doing politics than the traditional policy of assigning First Nations matters under the jurisdiction of the Indian and Northern Affairs, managed by one minister of the federal cabinet. The report also recommended providing the governments of the First Nations with up to $2 billion every year until 2010, in order to reduce the economic gap between the First Nations and the rest of the Canadian citizenry. The money would represent an increase of at least 50% to the budget of Indian and Northern Affairs. The report engaged First Nations leaders to think of ways to cope with the challenging issues their people were facing, so the First Nations could take their destiny into their own hands.

The federal government, then headed by Jean Chrétien, responded to the report a year later by officially presenting its apologies for the forced acculturation the federal government had imposed on the First Nations, and by offering an &quot;initial&quot; provision of $350 million.

In the spirit of the Eramus–Dussault commission, tripartite (federal, provincial, and First Nations) accords have been signed since the report was issued. Several political crises between different provincial governments and different bands of the First Nations also occurred in the late 20th century, notably the Oka Crisis, Ipperwash Crisis, Burnt Church Crisis, and the Gustafsen Lake standoff.

===Early 21st century===

In 2001, the Quebec government, the federal government, and the Cree Nation signed &quot;La Paix des Braves&quot; (&quot;The Peace of the Braves&quot;, a reference to the 1701 peace treaty between the French and the Iroquois League). The agreement allowed Hydro-Québec to exploit the province&#x27;s hydroelectric resources in exchange for an allocation of $3.5 billion to be given to the government of the Cree Nation. Later, the Inuit of northern Quebec (Nunavik) joined in the agreement.
In 2005, the leaders of the First Nations, various provincial governments, and the federal government produced an agreement called the Kelowna Accord, which would have yielded $5 billion over 10 years, but the new federal government of Stephen Harper (2006) did not follow through on the working paper.
First Nations, along with the Métis and the Inuit, have claimed to receive inadequate funding for education, and allege their rights have been overlooked. James Bartleman, Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 2002 to 2007, listed the encouragement of indigenous young people as one of his key priorities. During his term, he launched initiatives to promote literacy and bridge-building. Bartleman was the first Aboriginal person to be lieutenant governor in Ontario.

In 2006, 76 First Nations communities had boil-water advisory conditions.
In late 2005, the drinking water crisis of the Kashechewan First Nation received national media attention when &quot;E. coli&quot; was discovered in their water supply system, following two years of living under a boil-water advisory. The drinking water was supplied by a new treatment plant built in March 1998. The cause of the tainted water was a plugged chlorine injector that was not discovered by local operators, who were not qualified to be running the treatment plant. When officials arrived and fixed the problem, chlorine levels were around 1.7 mg/L, which was blamed for skin disorders such as impetigo and scabies. An investigation led by Health Canada revealed that skin disorders were likely due to living in squalor. The evacuation of Kashechewan was largely viewed by Canadians as a cry for help for other underlying social and economic issues that Aboriginal people in Canada face.

On June 29, 2007, Canadian Aboriginal groups held countrywide protests aimed at ending First Nations poverty, dubbed the Aboriginal Day of Action. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, although groups disrupted transportation with blockades or bonfires; a stretch of the Highway 401 was shut down, as was the Canadian National Railway&#x27;s line between Toronto and Montreal.

The Idle No More protest movement originated among the Aboriginals in Canada and their non-Aboriginal supporters in Canada, and to a lesser extent, internationally. It consisted of a number of political actions worldwide, inspired in part by the hunger strike of Attawapiskat First Nation Chief Theresa Spence and further coordinated via social media. A reaction to alleged abuses of indigenous treaty rights by the federal government, the movement took particular issue with the omnibus bill Bill C-45.

==Canadian Crown and First Nations relations==
The relationship between the Canadian Crown and the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples stretches back to the first interactions between European colonialists and North American indigenous people. Over centuries of interaction, treaties were established, and First Nations have, like the Māori and the Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand, come to generally view these agreements as being between them and the Crown of Canada, and not the ever-changing governments.

The associations exist between the Aboriginal peoples and the reigning monarch of Canada; as was stated in the proposed First NationsFederal Crown Political Accord: &quot;cooperation will be a cornerstone for partnership between Canada and First Nations, wherein Canada is the short-form reference to Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada&quot;. These relations are governed by the established treaties; the Supreme Court stated that treaties &quot;served to reconcile pre-existing Aboriginal sovereignty with assumed Crown sovereignty, and to define Aboriginal rights&quot;, and the First Nations saw these agreements as meant to last &quot;as long as the sun shines, grass grows and rivers flow&quot;.

===Taxation===
Although taxes are not specifically addressed in the written terms of any treaties, assurances regarding taxation were clearly offered when at least some treaties were negotiated.

The various statutory exemptions from taxation are established under the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, which reads:

Many scholars believe these exemptions serve to oppress Aboriginal peoples by allowing conservative-minded courts to impart their own (sometimes discriminatory) views into the Aboriginal taxation jurisprudence. As one professor wrote:

===Political organization===

Self-government has given chiefs and their councils powers which combine those of a province, school board, health board and municipality. Councils are also largely self-regulating regarding utilities, environmental protection, natural resources, building codes, etc. There is concern that this wide-ranging authority, concentrated in a single council, might be a cause of the dysfunctional governments experienced by many First Nations.

The Assembly of First Nations (AFN) is a body of First Nations leaders in Canada. The aims of the organization are to protect the rights, treaty obligations, ceremonies, and claims of citizens of the First Nations in Canada.

After the failures of the League of Indians in Canada in the interwar period and the North American Indian Brotherhood in two decades following the Second World War, the Aboriginal peoples of Canada organised themselves once again in the early 1960s. The National Indian Council was created in 1961 to represent Indigenous people, including treaty/status Indians, non-status people, the Métis people, though not the Inuit. This organization collapsed in 1968 as the three groups failed to act as one, so the non-status and Métis groups formed the Native Council of Canada and treaty/status groups formed the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB), an umbrella group for provincial and territorial First Nations organizations.

==Culture==

National Indigenous Peoples Day, formerly &quot;National Aboriginal Day&quot;, June 21, recognizes the cultures and contributions of Aboriginal peoples of Canada. There are currently over 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands encompassing 1,172,790 2006 people spread across Canada with distinctive Aboriginal cultures, languages, art, and music.

===Languages===
Today, there are over thirty different languages spoken by indigenous people, most of which are spoken only in Canada. Many are in decline. Those with the most speakers include Anishinaabe and Cree (together totalling up to 150,000 speakers); Inuktitut with about 29,000 speakers in the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Nunavik (Northern Quebec), and Nunatsiavut (Northern Labrador); and Mi&#x27;kmaq, with around 8,500 speakers, mostly in Eastern Canada. Many Aboriginal peoples have lost their native languages and often all but surviving elders speak English or French as their first language.

Two of Canada&#x27;s territories give official status to native languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in government. In the Northwest Territories, the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; declares that there are eleven different languages: Chipewyan, Cree, English, French, Gwich&#x27;in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey and Tłįchǫ. Besides English and French, these languages are not vehicular in government; official status entitles citizens to receive services in them on request and to deal with the government in them.

===Art===
First Nations were producing art for thousands of years before the arrival of European settler colonists and the eventual establishment of Canada as a nation state. Like the peoples who produced them, indigenous art traditions spanned territories across North America. Indigenous art traditions are organized by art historians according to cultural, linguistic or regional groups: Northwest Coast, Plateau, Plains, Eastern Woodlands, Subarctic, and Arctic.

Art traditions vary enormously amongst and within these diverse groups. Indigenous art with a focus on portability and the body is distinguished from European traditions and its focus on architecture. Indigenous visual art may be used in conjunction with other arts. Shamans&#x27; masks and rattles are used ceremoniously in dance, storytelling and music.
Artworks preserved in museum collections date from the period after European contact and show evidence of the creative adoption and adaptation of European trade goods such as metal and glass beads. During the 19th and the first half of the 20th century the Canadian government pursued an active policy of forced and cultural assimilation toward indigenous peoples. The &quot;Indian Act&quot; banned manifestations of the Sun Dance, the Potlatch, and works of art depicting them.

It was not until the 1950s and 1960s that indigenous artists such as Mungo Martin, Bill Reid and Norval Morrisseau began to publicly renew and re-invent indigenous art traditions. Currently there are indigenous artists practising in all media in Canada and two indigenous artists, Edward Poitras and Rebecca Belmore, have represented Canada at the Venice Biennale in 1995 and 2005 respectively.

===Music===

The First Nations peoples of Canada comprise diverse ethnic groups, each with their own musical traditions. There are general similarities in the music, but is usually social (public) or ceremonial (private). Public, social music may be dance music accompanied by rattles and drums. Private, ceremonial music includes vocal songs with accompaniment on percussion, used to mark occasions like Midewiwin ceremonies and Sun Dances.

Traditionally, Aboriginal peoples used the materials at hand to make their instruments for centuries before Europeans immigrated to Canada. First Nations people made gourds and animal horns into rattles, which were elaborately carved and beautifully painted. In woodland areas, they made horns of birch bark and drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. Traditional percussion instruments such as drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. These musical instruments provide the background for songs, and songs are the background for dances. Traditional First Nations people consider song and dance to be sacred. For years after Europeans came to Canada, First Nations people were forbidden to practice their ceremonies.

==Demographics==
In year 1822 the Indigenous population in Canada, excluding the Métis, was estimated as 283,500 individuals and in year 1885 it was estimated as 131,952 people. In the 20th century, the First Nations population of Canada increased tenfold. Between 1900 and 1950 the population grew only by 29% but after the 1960s the infant mortality level on reserves dropped and the population grew by 161%. Since the 1980s, the number of First Nations babies more than doubled and currently almost half of the First Nations population is under the age of 25. As a result, the First Nations population of Canada is expected to increase in the coming decades.

In 2021, there were 1,807,250 Aboriginal people in Canada, accounting for 5.0% of the total population. This was up from 4.9% in 2016.

There are distinct First Nations in Canada, originating across the country. Indian reserves, established in Canadian law by treaties such as Treaty 7, are the very limited contemporary lands of First Nations recognized by the non-indigenous governments. A few reserves exist within cities, such as the Opawikoscikan Reserve in Prince Albert, Wendake in Quebec City or Enoch Cree Nation 135 in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region. There are more reserves in Canada than there are First Nations, as First Nations were ceded multiple reserves by treaty.
First Nations can be grouped into cultural areas based on their ancestors&#x27; primary lifeway, or occupation, at the time of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada.

Ethnographers commonly classify indigenous peoples of the Americas in the United States and Canada into ten geographical regions with shared cultural traits (called &quot;cultural areas&quot;). The Canadian (in whole or in part) regions are Arctic, Subarctic, Northeast Woodlands, Plains, and Plateau. See the individual article on each tribe, band society or First Nation.

The Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast communities centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunting and gathering and river fishing. In both of these areas, salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River, shifting agriculture was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash.

Today, Aboriginal people work in a variety of occupations and live outside their ancestral homes. The traditional cultures of their ancestors, shaped by nature, still exert a strong influence on their culture, from spirituality to political attitudes.
==Contemporary issues==
First Nations peoples face a number of problems to a greater degree than Canadians overall, some with living conditions comparable to developing countries like Haiti. Indigenous peoples have higher rates of unemployment, rates of incarceration, substance abuse, health problems, homelessness, fetal alcohol syndrome, lower levels of education and higher levels of poverty.

=== Residential schools ===

Canada&#x27;s federal residential school system began in the mid-1870s, building upon a patchwork of boarding schools established and operated by various Christian denominations. Member of Parliament for Assiniboia West, Nicholas Flood Davin, produced a report, known generally as the Davin Report, that recommended the establishment of a school system similar to that being created in the United States. One of its chief goals was to remove Aboriginal children from &quot;the influence of the wigwam&quot;, which he claimed was stronger than that of existing day schools, and keep them instead &quot;constantly within the circle of civilized conditions&quot;. While the history of the Indian Residential School system (IRS) is a checkered one, much criticism has been levelled at both the system and those who established and supported it. Neglect and poor nutrition were often what Aboriginal children experienced, particularly in the early decades of the system&#x27;s operation. The stripping away of traditional Native culturesometimes referred to as &quot;cultural genocide&quot;is another charge levelled at the residential schools. In many schools, students were not allowed to speak their Indigenous languages or practice any of their own customs, and thus lost their sense of identity, inevitably driving a cultural wedge between children and their family.

By 1920, attendance at some sort of school was mandatory for Aboriginal children in Canada. The &quot;Indian Act&quot; made education compulsory, and where there were no federal days schoolsor, in later decades, a provincial public schoola residential school was the only choice. Enrollment statistics indicate that between 20% and 30% of Aboriginal children throughout the history of the IRS (Indian Residential Schools) system attended a residential school for at least a year, and many were enrolled for ten years or more. In some cases, children could return home on weekends and holidays, but for those in schools established far away from remote communities, this was not possible.

The removal of children from their families and communities brought short and long term harm to many Native communities. While many schools had infirmaries and provided medical care in later decades, abuse of various kinds and crowded conditions in the first decades of the IRS history led to poor health and even death for a percentage of those enrolled. It has been argued that the psychological and emotional trauma resulting from both the abuse and the removal of the children from their families and culture has resulted in substance abuse, greater domestic violence, unemployability, and increased rates of suicide. In many cases, children leaving residential schools found themselves at an intersection of cultures, where they were no longer comfortable within their own cultures, yet not accepted into mainstream Canadian culture. Former students are now routinely referred to as &quot;survivors&quot;.

The last Canadian residential school to close was Gordon Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan, founded in 1889, and closed in 1996.

The Christian denominations that operated the schools on behalf of the federal government have expressed regret and issued apologies for their part in a system that harmed many indigenous children. In 2008, the government issued an official apology to the students who were forced to attend the residential schools and their families.

In June 2015, the federally-established Truth and Reconciliation Commission, charged with investigating and reporting on the residential school system, issued its summary report, and in December of the same year, its final report. Chief Commissioner, Judge Murray Sinclair, has publicly declared the residential school system a deliberate act of cultural genocide against First Nations peoples. In its report, the commission submitted 94 recommendations to the Canadian government, recommendations which, if implemented, would substantially improve indigenous race relations, increase quality of life for survivors and extended families, and help undo the damage caused by residential schools. While the Liberal government, under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has committed itself to improving the lives of Canada&#x27;s indigenous people, and specifically to implementing the TRC recommendations, some of those recommendations may be beyond the power of the Canadian government. The countless research documents assembled by the TRC will be archived in a special repository at the University of Manitoba.

=== Employment ===
The income of women with status living off-reserve was on average $13,870 a year, according to a 1996 Canadian census. This is about $5500 less than non-Indigenous women, such as Inuit and Métis women, which recorded slightly higher average annual incomes; regardless of the small discrepancy, all of which are substantially less than Statistics Canada&#x27;s estimated amount of which an individual living in a large Canadian city would require to meet their needs. It is not unlikely for Aboriginal women living in poverty to not only tend to their own needs, but often tend to the needs of their elderly parents, care for loved ones in ill-health, as well as raising children; all of which is often supported only on a single income. It is believed that homelessness and inadequate shelter are widespread problems facing Aboriginal families, in all settings.

=== Self governance ===
A paramount conclusion by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples is that the repeated assaults on the culture and collective identity of the Aboriginal people has resulted in a weakened foundation of Aboriginal society and has contributed to the alienation that inevitably drives some to self-destructive and antisocial behaviour. The social problems among Aboriginal people are, in large measure, a legacy of history.

=== Crime and incarceration ===

Aboriginals are also more likely to be the victims of crime. This is particularly true in the younger population (aged 15–34), where acts of violence are two and a half times more likely to occur than in the older population. Domestic violence and sexual abuse against children is more prevalent in the Aboriginal population with sexual abuse affecting 25–50% of Aboriginal female children versus 20–25% of female children in the general population. Children who come from homes with a history of violence are at a greater risk of becoming the perpetrators of violence later in life. This is especially true of males.

As of 2007, 17% of incarcerated individuals in Canada were of Aboriginal descent, despite representing only 2.7% of the general population. This is a sixfold increase in rates of incarceration within the Aboriginal population as opposed to the general Canadian population. There are many reasons for the over-representation of Aboriginals within the Canadian justice system. Lack of education, poverty, unemployment and abuse all lead to higher crime rates. Also, statistically, Aboriginals have a greater chance of conviction and subsequently, incarceration once convicted. They are also much less likely to receive parole during their sentence.

=== Health ===
The Canadian federal government is responsible for health and social services on the reserve and in Inuit communities, while the provincial and territorial governments provide services elsewhere. The divide between each level of government has led to a gap in services for Aboriginal people living off-reserve and in Canadian towns and cities. Although Aboriginal people living off-reserve have access to the programs and services designed for the general population, these programs and services do not address the specific needs of Aboriginal people, nor is it delivered in a culturally appropriate way. It has not been until recently that the Canadian federal government had to increase recognition to the needs for programs and services for Aboriginal people in predominantly non-Aboriginal communities. It is however funding that lags the growth of urban Aboriginal populations and the uncoordinated delivery of services through various government departments would also pose as a barrier. The federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians pointed out that in 2003 almost 90 percent of the funding for programs designed for Aboriginal peoples is spent on reserves, while off-reserve programs for Aboriginal people are delivered through just 22 federal departments, as well as other provincial and territorial agencies. The federal subcommittee on Indigenous child welfare described a &quot;jurisdictional web&quot; in which there is little to no coordination with or between municipal, provincial and federal levels of government.

The health care services available to Aboriginal people is rarely delivered in a culturally sensitive approach. It is the constant cast of &quot;the other&quot; by the settler Canadian population that contaminates the delivery of such necessary services to Aboriginal peoples. It was argued by Ontario finance minister Jim Flaherty in 1992 that the Canadian government could boost health-care funding for &quot;real people in real towns&quot; by cutting the bureaucracy that serves only Aboriginal peoples. These types of statements, especially made by people often heard by a greater audience, are said to have detrimental and influential effects on the overall attitudes of settler population folks, as well as Aboriginal peoples.

==== Diabetes ====

There are marked differences between the epidemiology of diabetes in First Nation population compared to the general population. Reasons for the different rate of Type 2 Diabetes between First Nation and the general population include a complex combination of environmental (lifestyle, diet, poverty) and genetic and biological factors (e.g. thrifty genotype hypothesis, thrifty phenotype) – though to what extent each factor plays a role is still not clear.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1503/cmaj.090846&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aboriginal population in Canada (First Nations, Inuit and Métis) have a significantly higher prevalence rate of diabetes than the non-Aboriginal population. Age-standardized rates show that the prevalence of diabetes among First Nations individuals living on-reserve is 17.2%; First Nations individuals living off-reserve is 10.3%; Métis individuals 7.3%; and non-Aboriginal peoples at 5.0%. Aboriginal individuals are generally diagnosed at a younger age than non-Aboriginal individuals, and Aboriginal females experience higher rates of gestational diabetes than non-Aboriginal females. The complications and prevalence of diabetes are seen among the Aboriginal population more often than non-Aboriginal population. These may be attributed to the socio-cultural, biological, environmental and lifestyle changes seen in the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis populations, which have been most especially prevalent in the last half century, all of which contributing significantly to the increased rates of diabetes and the complications associated among the Aboriginal population.

==== Substance-use disorders ====
First Nations in Canada engage in a disproportionate amount of substance abuse. In Vancouver, Indigenous people were faced with almost 18 per cent of drug charges, but are just 2.2 per cent of the city&#x27;s population. A much higher proportion of First Nations people engage in heavy drinking weekly (16%) as opposed to the general population (8%). 19% of First Nations also reported cocaine and opiates use, higher than 13% of the general Canadian population that reported using opioids.

==== Life expectancy ====
Life expectancy at birth is significantly lower for First Nations babies than for babies in the Canadian population as a whole. , Indian and Northern Affairs Canada estimates First Nations life expectancy to be 8.1 years shorter for males and 5.5 years shorter for females. Where females in the general population had a life expectancy at birth of 82 years, First Nations females had a life expectancy of 76 years. In males the life expectancy for First Nations individuals was 69 years as opposed to 77 in the general population. The reasons behind the lower life expectancy for First Nations individuals are varied and complex; however, social determinants of health are thought to play a large part.

==== Suicide ====
Overall, First Nations individuals have some of the highest rates of suicide globally. Suicide rates are more than twice the sex-specific rate and also three times the age-specific rates of non-Aboriginal Canadians. Residential Aboriginals between ages 10 and 29 show an elevated suicide risk as compared to non-residential Aboriginals by 5–6 times. One theory for the increased incidences of suicide within Aboriginal populations as compared to the general Canadian population is called acculturation stress which results from the intersection of multiple cultures within one&#x27;s life. This leads to differing expectations and cultural clashes within the community, the family and the individual. At the community level, a general economic disadvantage is seen, exacerbated by unemployment and low education levels, leading to poverty, political disempowerment and community disorganization. The family suffers through a loss of tradition as they attempt to assimilate into mainstream Canadian culture. These lead to low self-esteem in the individual as First Nations culture and tradition are marginalized affecting one&#x27;s sense of self-identity. These factors combine to create a world where First Nations individuals feel they cannot identify completely as Aboriginal, nor can they fully identify as mainstream Canadians. When that balance cannot be found, many (particularly youths) turn to suicide as a way out.

==== Drinking water ====

400 First Nations communities in Canada had some kind of water problem between 2004 and 2014. The residents of Neskantaga First Nation in Ontario have had a boil-water advisory since 1995. In 2015, newly elected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to solve the drinking water problem within five years, by investing $1.8 billion. As of October 2021, long-term boil water advisories are still present in 32 First Nations drinking water systems.

=== Land claims ===

Across Canada, many First Nations have not signed treaties with the Canadian Crown. Many First Nations are in the process of negotiating a modern treaty, which would grant them treaty rights. Some First Nation bands are also trying to resolve their historical grievances with the Canadian government. These grievances often originate from a breach of treaty obligations or of the &quot;Indian Act&quot; by the government of Canada. They can also involve mismanagement of indigenous land or assets by the Crown.

===Missing and murdered women===
Across Canada, there has been a large number of missing and murdered Aboriginal women since 1980. 16% of female murder victims and 12% of missing women have been Aboriginal, while demographically they constitute only 4% of the overall female population. This amounts to almost 1,200 Aboriginal females either missing or murdered in just over 30 years.

In 2014 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) released &quot;Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: A National Operational Review&quot;. This publication documents the official findings of this demographic as well as advises for future change. It finds that there are 164 Aboriginal women still missing and 1,017 murdered, making for a total of 1,181. &quot;There are 225 unsolved cases of either missing or murdered Aboriginal females: 105 missing for more than 30 days , whose cause of disappearance was categorized as &#x27;unknown&#x27; or &#x27;foul play suspected&#x27; and 120 unsolved homicides between 1980 and 2012.&quot; Indigenous women in Canada are overrepresented among the missing and murdered females in Canada. Additionally, there are shared characteristics among these cases: most of the murders were committed by men and were someone the victim knew, either a partner or an acquaintance. &quot;Aboriginal women between the ages of 25 and 44 are 5 times more likely than other women of the same age to die as a result of violence.&quot; These statistics portray the severity and prevalence of violence against indigenous women in Canada.

Self-governance and preservation of indigenous territories become increasingly difficult as natural resources continue to be exploited by foreign companies. Projects such as &quot;mining, logging, hydroelectric construction, large-scale export oriented agribusiness or oil exploration&quot; are usually coupled with environmental degradation and occasionally violence and militarization.&quot; Many scholars go so far as to link the proliferation of global neoliberalism with a rise in violence. Women&#x27;s concerns are nearly always pushed aside, to be addressed later; their safety is therefore often compromised and not deemed priority. Privatization of public services and reduction in the universality of health care produces negative repercussions for those of lower socioeconomic status in rural locations; these downsides are magnified for female Aboriginals.

===Missing and murdered men===
Approximately 2,500 aboriginal people were murdered in Canada between 1982 and 2011, out of 15,000 murders in Canada overall. Of the 2,500 murdered aboriginal Canadians, fully 71 per cent1,750were male.

According to summaries of seven consultation sessions posted to a government website, the desire to dedicate some attention to violence against indigenous men and boys has come up at four of the meetings.

These calls to extend the scope of the inquiry to include missing and murdered aboriginal people of all genders have met with resistance and been criticized as detracting from the current focus on the issue of missing and murdered aboriginal women. Barbara Bailey, who was on the UN team that visited Canada in 2013 to investigate the violence, has said, &quot;I think to detract now would really be a tragedy. Let&#x27;s fix that problem first and then we can begin to see what else is out there.&quot;

Speaking on the matter, Minister of Indigenous Affairs, Carolyn Bennett has said, &quot;Our mandate now is to get to the bottom of the tragedy of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls in Canada&quot;, citing sexism as being of specific concern. Dawn Lavell-Harvard, the president of the Native Women&#x27;s Association of Canada, has also weighed in on the issue by saying, &quot;Absolutely [men] deserve the same amount of attention, just not necessarily in the same forum&quot;, neither that forum nor an equal level of attention have yet to materialize.

<text>Interscope Records is an American record label based in Santa Monica, California, owned by Universal Music Group through its Interscope Geffen A&amp;M imprint. Founded in late 1990 by Jimmy Iovine and Ted Field as a $20 million joint venture with Atlantic Records of Warner Music Group and Interscope Communications, it differed from most record labels by letting A&amp;R staff control decisions and allowing artists and producers full creative control. Interscope&#x27;s first hit records arrived in under a year, and it achieved profitability in 1993. Chair and CEO until May 2014, Iovine was succeeded by John Janick.

In 1992, Interscope acquired the exclusive rights to market and distribute releases from hardcore hip hop label Death Row Records, a decision that ultimately put the label at the center of the mid-1990s gangsta rap controversy. As a result, Time Warner, then the parent of Warner Music Group, severed ties with Interscope by selling its 50 percent stake back to Field and Iovine for $115 million in 1995. In 1996, 50% of the label was acquired for a reported $200 million by MCA Inc., later known as Universal Music Group.

Interscope&#x27;s artist roster includes Sting, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Lady Gaga, OneRepublic, Dermot Kennedy, Blackpink, Dr. Dre, DaBaby, Billie Eilish, Finneas, Imagine Dragons, Olivia Rodrigo, Selena Gomez, Camila Cabello, Playboi Carti, Kendrick Lamar, Jennifer Hudson, Ken Carson, GloRilla, Destroy Lonely, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q, Lana Del Rey, JID, Maroon 5, Moneybagg Yo, Gwen Stefani, Rae Sremmurd, Gracie Abrams, Zedd, Machine Gun Kelly, U2, Yeat, Yungblud, Cuco, Juice Wrld, d4vd, Homixide Gang, Reneé Rapp, Nettspend, J. Cole, Ivan Cornejo and Karol G.

==History==
===1990–1995: Origins, early success, and joint ventures===
In 1989, Ted Field began to build Interscope Records as a division of his film company, Interscope Communications. To run it, he hired John McClain, who had played a central role in Janet Jackson&#x27;s success at A&amp;M Records, and Tom Whalley, who had been the head of A&amp;R at Capitol Records. Separately, Iovine, who had produced records for U2, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Nicks, and John Lennon, among others, was trying to raise money to start a label. &quot;I thought, &#x27;Music is going to change,&#x27;&quot; Iovine said in 1997. &quot;&#x27;Young bands aren&#x27;t going to be asking for me.&#x27; But I love working with the new thing. I always liked the part of the business that&#x27;s the first time you hear something, and I knew I wasn&#x27;t in that business anymore.&quot;

Iovine and Field were introduced by Paul McGuinness, then U2&#x27;s manager. After a series of negotiations led by David Geffen, they came to an agreement, and in 1990, Interscope Records was founded as a joint venture with Atlantic Records. In a 1997 article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Wild wrote: &quot;Interscope&#x27;s start-up coincided with a period of incredible change in the music world. Nirvana had ushered in the alternative revolution... While the major labels were packed with rosters full of expensive veteran artists who had to redefine themselves for a new rock era, Interscope was in the business of signing new artists and could – as Iovine puts it – &#x27;move on a dime.&#x27;&quot;

Based in Los Angeles, California in the Westwood neighborhood at an office building on 10900 Wilshire Boulevard, Interscope was run by &quot;music men&quot;. It was a departure from the music industry practices of the 1970s and 1980s, when labels traditionally appointed lawyers and promotion executives to senior positions. A founding tenet of the label was that artists would have complete creative control.

Interscope&#x27;s first release was &quot;Rico Suave&quot; by Ecuadorian rapper Gerardo in December 1990; the single reached number seven on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; charts in April 1991. Primus&#x27; Interscope debut, &quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot;, was released in May, followed by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch&#x27;s &quot;Music for the People&quot; in July. It included the number-one single &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. Two days after first hearing his demo, Whalley signed Tupac Shakur in August 1991, and by November, Interscope released &quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot;, Shakur&#x27;s studio debut.

Interscope began to develop a significant presence in the genre of alternative rock in 1992. In addition to a second Primus album, the label released No Doubt&#x27;s self-titled debut, Helmet&#x27;s &quot;Meantime&quot;, 4 Non Blondes&#x27; &quot;Bigger, Better, Faster, More!,&quot; acquired and re-released Rocket from the Crypt&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, and, through a joint venture with TVT/Nothing Records, the Nine Inch Nails EP &quot;Broken.&quot; However, Interscope&#x27;s success with alternative and rock music was eclipsed by controversy which began in September 1992, when Vice President Dan Quayle called on Interscope to withdraw &quot;2Pacalypse Now,&quot; stating that it was responsible for the death of a Texas state trooper, who was shot to death in April by a suspect who allegedly was listening to the album on the tape deck of a stolen truck when he was stopped by the officer. The trooper&#x27;s family filed a civil suit against Shakur and Interscope, claiming the record&#x27;s violence-laden lyrics incite &quot;imminent lawless action&quot;.

Earlier in 1992, Interscope negotiated a $10-million deal with Dr. Dre and Marion &quot;Suge&quot; Knight to finance and distribute their label, Death Row Records. It was initiated by McClain, who met Dre when he was recording his solo debut, &quot;The Chronic.&quot; Original plans had called for the album to be released through Sony, but Sony passed on &quot;The Chronic&quot; due to &quot;the crazy things going on around Death Row&quot; and the contractual status of Dr. Dre. After hearing the album, Iovine agreed to put it out, although doing so required a complicated distribution agreement with Priority Records, Dre&#x27;s label as a member of N.W.A. &quot;The Chronic&quot; was released in December 1992.

By the end of the following year, &quot;The Chronic&quot; had sold almost 3 million copies. Snoop Dogg&#x27;s debut &quot;Doggystyle&quot; had sold more than 800,000 copies in its first week alone, and Primus and 4 Non-Blondes had released records which hit the US Top 20. In 1993, with an estimated gross of $90 million, Interscope became profitable ahead of projections.

Interscope further established its strength in the alternative and rock genres in 1994. A $2.5 million investment to establish a joint venture with Trauma Records yielded three number-one Modern Rock tracks and a platinum-certified album with Bush&#x27;s &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot;. The Nine Inch Nails album &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; went to number two on the US charts and was widely acclaimed. Marilyn Manson&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot;, The Toadies album &quot;Rubberneck&quot; and Helmet&#x27;s &quot;Betty&quot; were commercially successful and critically embraced.

===1995–2000: Gangsta rap controversy, acquisition by MCA, Aftermath and Shady===
In May 1995, the controversy related to gangsta rap and explicit lyrics intensified as U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole accused Interscope of releasing music that glorified violence and degraded women. Among others, the label was criticized by William J. Bennett, a former Education Secretary, and C. DeLores Tucker, the chairwoman of the National Political Congress of Black Women. In September, Time Warner announced it would disassociate itself from Interscope by selling its half-interest in the company to Field and Iovine for $115 million. Ownership in Interscope was aggressively pursued by EMI, BMG, PolyGram and MCA. On December 1, 1995, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that with five albums on that week&#x27;s pop charts and sales of $350 million over the previous three years, &quot;what may have been a smart move politically for Time Warner is now looking like a financial fiasco.&quot; In February 1996, MCA Records—then owned by Seagram—bought 50% of Interscope for a reported $200 million. Under the agreement, Interscope retained complete creative control over the label&#x27;s recordings. MCA was not required to distribute material that it deemed offensive.

Dre left Death Row in mid-1996 due to what was then reported as tension over the creative direction of the label, and founded Aftermath Entertainment, a new joint venture with Interscope. In November that same year, Aftermath debuted with the album &quot;Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath&quot;. The Death Row deal remained in place until 1997, when Knight was imprisoned for parole violations.

In November 1996, with records by Bush, Snoop Dogg, No Doubt, and Tupac Shakur, Interscope became the first label in 20 years to hold the top 4 positions on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Six additional Interscope releases were in the Top 100. The label was frequently criticized for overspending on artist acquisitions and joint ventures, however, with revenue for 1996 estimated at $250 million, it operated at a profit.

In 1996, MCA Music Entertainment was renamed Universal Music Group. In 1998, the Universal Music Group parent company Seagram acquired PolyGram Records. MCA&#x27;s Geffen Records and PolyGram&#x27;s A&amp;M Records were merged into Interscope, and in early 1999, Interscope Records began operating under the umbrella of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records, with Iovine and Field serving as co-chairmen.

Iovine&#x27;s assistant (and former intern) Dean Geistlinger saw Eminem perform at the Rap Olympics in Los Angeles in 1997 and passed Eminem&#x27;s CD on to Iovine; Iovine, in turn, passed it on to Dre. In February 1999, Interscope and Aftermath released &quot;The Slim Shady LP.&quot; The album entered the charts at number two, and won two Grammy Awards. Later in 1999 Eminem and his manager, Paul Rosenberg, founded Shady Records.

In 1998, Interscope signed a joint-venture deal with Ruff Ryders.

On June 22, 1999, Interscope/Flip records released Limp Bizkit&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Significant Other&quot; selling 643,874 copies in the first week. In the second week, it sold an additional 335,000 copies. It would go on to sell 7,000,000 copies in the US. Being certified 7× Platinum in 2001. It would go on to sell 16,000,000 copies worldwide.

By the close of the decade, Interscope sales accounted for nearly one-third of Seagram&#x27;s 27% share of the U.S. music market. Records by Limp Bizkit, Eminem, Dre, Eve, Nine Inch Nails, Enrique Iglesias, Blackstreet, Smash Mouth and others generated an estimated $40 million in profit during the final six months of 1999.

===2000–2010: Departure of Field, DreamWorks, Cherrytree Records and Beats===
Interscope/Shady released Eminem&#x27;s &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; on May 23, 2000. The fastest-selling rap album in history, it sold 1.76 million copies in its first week. On October 19, 2000, Interscope/Flip records released Limp Bizkit&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; and it would shift 1.05 million copies in its first week in the United States, becoming the fastest-selling rock album in history. Cementing Nu Metal&#x27;s status in pop culture as a top selling genre during the 2000s. Also Interscope began its relationship with U2 after it acquired the US rights to market and distribute the album &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;. Iovine had been trying to sign U2 since 1990.

In 2001, Field resigned as co-chairman of Interscope to start a new label. Described as an amicable parting, Field said he was &quot;anxious to become an entrepreneur again.&quot; An agreement with Universal allowed Field to resign a year before his contract was set to expire. Conversely, Whalley, Interscope&#x27;s president since 1998, accepted the position of chairman of Warner Bros. Records in May 2000 and was not released from his Interscope contract until it expired in August 2001.

Interscope/Shady released &quot;The Eminem Show,&quot; in May 2002 and the soundtrack for Eminem&#x27;s semi-autobiographical film &quot;8 Mile&quot; in October; the two titles combined sold more than 11,000,000 records before the end of the year. In 2002, New York City rapper 50 Cent signed to Interscope with a $1 million advance. 50 Cent&#x27;s major-label debut album &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot; was released on February 6, 2003, through Interscope. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; and the album went on to be certified 9× platinum in America. In April, it was announced that 50 Cent would sign and develop artists for release on G-Unit Records, which would be marketed and distributed through Interscope. 50 Cent&#x27;s success allowed G-Unit artists to release their own projects. 50 Cent&#x27;s group G-Unit released their debut album, &quot;Beg for Mercy&quot;, through Interscope. It debuted and peaked in the top 3 on Billboard 200. With the success of the singles &quot;Wanna Get to Know You&quot;, &quot;Poppin&#x27; Them Thangs&quot; and &quot;Stunt 101&quot;, the album was certified double platinum by the RIAA.

On September 23, 2003, Interscope/Flip Records released Limp Bizkit&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Results May Vary&quot;, selling 325,000 copies in the first week. Debuting at No. 3 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, ending Limp&#x27;s number 1 streak from their previous releases. It would go on to be certified Gold in 2003 and later Platinum in 2008. Ending Limp Bizkit&#x27;s commercial peak, the album would be their lowest-selling of their career up to that point. The band would go in hiatus in 2006, after releasing &quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot;, their first EP and later their first greatest hits album called &quot;Greatest Hitz&quot; in 2005. They both would sell 2,000,000 and 3,500,000 for a combined total of 5,500,000 worldwide. 

In November 2003, Universal Music Group acquired DreamWorks Records and in 2004 it was merged into Interscope Geffen A&amp;M. The DreamWorks A&amp;R staff was retained, and the label&#x27;s artists were divided between Geffen and Interscope. Among others, Interscope inherited Blink-182, The All-American Rejects, and Nelly Furtado. G-Unit artist Lloyd Banks released his debut studio album, &quot;The Hunger for More&quot; in June 2004 through Interscope. Anchored by the success of the single, &quot;On Fire&quot;, the album debuted atop the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; and achieved platinum status by the RIAA.

In March 2005, Interscope launched Cherrytree Records with Martin Kierszenbaum, its head of international operations. Kierszenbaum, also a producer and A&amp;R executive, focused initially on developing artists from outside the United States. Feist and Robyn were among Cherrytree&#x27;s first artists.

Four of Interscope&#x27;s releases were in the top 10 of the year end sales charts in 2005: &quot;The Massacre&quot; (50 Cent) at number one, &quot;Encore&quot; (Eminem) at number two, &quot;Love.Angel.Music.Baby.&quot; (Gwen Stefani) at number six, and &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; (U2) at number eight. The Game&#x27;s &quot;The Documentary&quot; appeared at number 16, and The Black Eyed Peas album &quot;Monkey Business&quot; charted at number 18.

In 2006, Dre and Iovine established Beats Electronics. Dre had been approached by his attorney to start a line of sneakers, and when he told Iovine about the idea, Iovine said: &quot;You know speakers, not sneakers.&quot; &#x27;Beats by Dr. Dre Studio Headphones&#x27; were introduced in January 2008 at the annual Consumer Electronics Show. &quot;It took us two years to get them right, but when I heard I knew it was going to be big,&quot; Iovine said in 2010. &quot;It&#x27;s just like listening to a hit record.&quot; The marketing for Beats integrated endorsements from Interscope artists including Gwen Stefani, M.I.A. and Pharrell, Lady Gaga, and will.i.am.
Lady Gaga&#x27;s studio debut &quot;The Fame&quot; was released in August 2008; it was re-released with eight new songs as &quot;The Fame Monster&quot; in November 2009. Interscope held the top four positions on the 2009 year-end Hot 100 charts with The Black Eyed Peas&#x27; &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot; (number one) and &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot; (number four); Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Poker Face&quot; charted at number two and &quot;Just Dance&quot; was at number three.

=== 2010–2020: Lady Gaga, Madonna, Eminem, departure of Iovine and appointment of John Janick ===
In June 2010 Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Recovery&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number one, his sixth album to do so. &quot;Born This Way&quot; by Lady Gaga was released in May 2011, and debuted at number one in 23 countries. In the US, with more than one million copies sold in its first week, it had the highest first-week album sales in five years. Four of the album&#x27;s singles—&quot;Born This Way&quot;, &quot;Judas&quot;, &quot;The Edge of Glory&quot;, and &quot;You and I&quot;—charted in the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Interscope signed Madonna and Van Halen in 2011. Both artists were previously signed to Warner Bros. Records; both released their first records for Interscope in 2012.

In October 2012, John Janick was named president and COO of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M. The founder of Fueled By Ramen, Janick had previous success with artists including Jimmy Eat World, Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco and Paramore. At the time of his appointment, it was reported that Iovine had chosen Janick as his eventual successor—Iovine&#x27;s attention had increasingly turned to Beats, which dominated the headphone market with 2012 revenues of $512 million. In May 2014, following Apple&#x27;s acquisition of Beats, Iovine resigned. As anticipated, Janick was named chairman and CEO of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M.

Six Interscope releases appeared in the &quot;Billboard&quot; year end album charts in 2014: &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP 2&quot; by Eminem, &quot;Ultraviolence&quot; by Lana Del Rey, &quot;V&quot; by Maroon 5, &quot;Native&quot; from OneRepublic, Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;ARTPOP&quot;, and &quot;Oxymoron&quot; by Schoolboy Q. In December 2014 it was announced that Selena Gomez, previously signed to Hollywood Records, had signed with Interscope.

Imagine Dragons&#x27; &quot;Smoke + Mirrors&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts at number one in March 2015. A week later, Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s album &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot; appeared at number one, a position it held for two consecutive weeks. Lamar won five Grammys in 2016. In August 2017, JoJo announced she had re-signed to Interscope, in a joint venture deal to launch her own music imprint, Clover Music.

In October 2018, YG Entertainment teamed up with Interscope Records in a global partnership for Blackpink. Interscope and Universal Music Group would represent the girl group worldwide, outside of Asia.

In May 2019, Australian pop rock band 5 Seconds of Summer signed with Interscope Records, following their departure from Capitol Records. On March 27, 2020, the band released their fourth studio album &quot;Calm.&quot; The album was a commercial success and received generally positive reviews from critics who praised the band&#x27;s artistic growth and maturity. The album charted in more than 25 countries on several charts, the album peaked in the top 10 on 17 charts and debuted atop the charts at number one in Australia, the UK and Scotland.

=== 2024–present: Interscope Capitol Labels Group ===

Interscope became the flagship label of Interscope Capitol Labels Group beginning in 2024. The label also signed American singer Jennifer Hudson, her first time being under a UMG label after being under four different labels with Sony Music since 2006. The singer also announced she would release her fourth album, &quot;The Gift of Love&quot;, her first ever Christmas album, which was released on October 18, 2024.

==Criticism and controversies==
===Album delays===
Several artists have criticized Interscope for delaying albums. The label was embroiled in controversy over delaying the release of the singer Bilal&#x27;s second album, &quot;Love for Sale&quot;, because of its creative direction. Dr. Dre had assisted Bilal&#x27;s production for the album in a limited role. After it leaked in 2006, Interscope notoriously shelved the release indefinitely, giving rise to rumors that the label had leaked it on purpose.

In 2013, M.I.A. said her album &quot;Matangi&quot; was held because the label felt the record she turned in was &quot;too positive&quot; for her fans. In 2010, rapper Eve left Interscope after a three-year delay of her album &quot;Lip Lock&quot;. Blink-182, All Time Low, and 50 Cent have similarly criticized Interscope.

===Elton John===
In discussing his 2006 album &quot;The Captain &amp; the Kid&quot; with Cameron Crowe in &quot;Rolling Stone,&quot; Elton John said: &quot;I was so furious with Interscope Records because they put it out and they dropped it. I had meetings in the South of France, and I said, &#x27;I know this isn&#x27;t a commercial album, I just want you to do your best,&#x27; and they dropped it like a fucking turd. It&#x27;s probably why I didn&#x27;t make another solo record. It was pure heartbreak.&quot;
John would later return to Interscope in the US in 2019.

===Nine Inch Nails===
In 2007, Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor criticized Universal Music Group for the inflated price of &quot;Year Zero&quot; in Australia. In an interview with the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; in Melbourne, he said that an employee of UMG stated that NIN had &quot;a core audience that&#x27;s gonna buy whatever we put out, so we can charge more...True fans will pay whatever.&quot; Nine Inch Nails signed with Columbia Records in 2013.

=== Die Antwoord ===
On November 7, 2011, it was reported that the South African hip hop/rave group Die Antwoord was leaving Interscope Records over a dispute with the label wanting their second studio album &quot;Tension&quot; to be re-worked for &quot;mainstream appeal&quot;. Problems with Interscope first arose when the group decided the lead single for their second album would be &quot;Fok julle naaiers&quot; (loosely translated to &quot;Fuck you fuckers&quot;). &quot;Tension&quot; was ultimately released through Zef Recordz in early 2012.

===Kendrick Lamar and Top Dawg Entertainment===
On March 15, 2015, Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s album, &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot;, was released on iTunes, Spotify and Google Play eight days ahead of its scheduled release date (March 23). The CEO of Top Dawg Entertainment, Anthony Tiffith, blamed Interscope for the album&#x27;s unintentional release, and tweeted: &quot;I would personally like to thank Interscope for fucking up our release. Somebody has got to pay for this mistake. #TOP!&quot; The tweet was later deleted. On the following day, the option to purchase the album was removed from iTunes. The album debuted at number one when it was officially released.

===Alleged knowledge of Marilyn Manson sex abuse===
In January 2023, a sex abuse lawsuit was filed alleging that Interscope and its now defunct subsidiary Nothing Records knew about sex abuse committed by Marilyn Manson against a girl in the 1990s when he was signed with Nothing Records.

==Legal issues==
===Rockit Cargo===
In September 2011, it was reported by federal prosecutors that the Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records building was used by a drug-trafficking ring as a transport center. The Drug Enforcement Administration inspected the year-long case and stated that the Los Angeles offices of Interscope Records were used for pickups and deliveries of hundreds of kilograms of cocaine in 2010 and 2011. Rock-It Cargo, a shipping company which has an immense list of musical clients, shipped music cases that allegedly contained drugs to New York City studios.
 Interscope Geffen A&amp;M responded to the claims with a statement that read: &quot;There is no evidence that any employee of UMG or Interscope Records had any involvement in the drug trafficking ring being prosecuted by that office, nor any knowledge of the contents of any of the packages that were purportedly shipped to its offices. Further, neither UMG nor Interscope Records are a subject or target of the investigation. UMG and Interscope will continue to cooperate with the United States Attorney&#x27;s Office regarding this matter&quot;.

===Trauma and JCOR===
In 1997, Trauma Records filed a $100 million lawsuit against Interscope that charged the company with fraud and the unfulfillment of a two-year promise to assign No Doubt to Trauma&#x27;s roster. After a four-month dispute, the partnership was dissolved in an out-of-court agreement. Trauma Records principals reportedly received an additional $3 million; No Doubt remained with Interscope.

In 2002, JCOR founder Jay Faires filed a $30 million breach-of-contract suit that alleged that Interscope had withheld millions of dollars in an effort to drive it out of business. Interscope responded that JCOR had hid its true financial position at the time it signed its distribution contract and had attempted to use Interscope&#x27;s money to finance its business.

<doc id="315244" wikidata="Q648269" url="?curid=315244" title="Albert Campion">
<text>Albert Campion is a fictional character in a series of detective novels and short stories by Margery Allingham. He first appeared as a supporting character in &quot;The Crime at Black Dudley&quot; (1929), an adventure story involving a ring of criminals, and would go on to feature in another 18 novels and over 20 short stories.

Supposedly created as a parody of Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27; detective Lord Peter Wimsey, Campion established his own identity, and matured and developed as the series progressed. After Allingham&#x27;s death her husband Philip Youngman Carter completed her last Campion book and wrote two more before his own death.

==Fictional biography==
Albert Campion is a pseudonym used by a man who was born in 1900 into a prominent British aristocratic family. Early novels hint that he was part of the Royal Family but this suggestion is dropped in later works. However, it is hinted at again in &quot;Cargo of Eagles&quot;, Allingham&#x27;s last novel. He was educated at Rugby School and the (fictitious) St. Ignatius&#x27; College, Cambridge (according to a mini-biography included in &quot;Sweet Danger&quot;; this is also hinted at in &quot;Police at the Funeral&quot;). Ingenious, resourceful and well-educated, in his twenties he assumed the name Campion and began a life as an adventurer and detective.

==Characteristics==
Campion is thin, blond, wears horn-rimmed glasses, and is often described as affable, inoffensive and bland, with a deceptively blank and unintelligent expression. He sometimes engages in silly stunts, slapstick humor, and carries a realistic-looking water pistol instead of a firearm. He is nonetheless a man of authority and action, and considers himself to be a helpful and comforting &#x27;Uncle Albert&#x27; to friends and those in need. In some stories, he lives in a flat above a police station at Number 17A, Bottle Street, in Piccadilly, London. In the early stories he has a pet jackdaw called Autolycus.

In some stories, Allingham explores the differences between society as it existed before the Great War, and the modern world. Campion sometimes works as an intermediary between old upper-class characters and the new, modern police.

==Names==

The name &#x27;Campion&#x27; may have its origin in the Old French word for &#x27;champion&#x27;. Another source says the name was suggested by Allingham&#x27;s husband, Philip Youngman Carter, and may allude to the Jesuit martyr St. Edmund Campion. Carter and St. Edmund Campion were both graduates of Christ&#x27;s Hospital school. Campion&#x27;s fictional college, St. Ignatius, supports the Edmund Campion connection, since St. Ignatius of Loyola was the founder of the Jesuits. There are also occasional references in the books to the field-flower campion (e.g., &quot;Look to the Lady&quot; ch. 21), evoking the similar relationship between the fictional hero the Scarlet Pimpernel and the pimpernel flower.

&#x27;Albert Campion&#x27; is revealed early on to be a pseudonym. In &quot;Mystery Mile&quot; and &quot;Police at the Funeral&quot;, his true first name is said to be Rudolph, while his surname begins with a K. In &quot;The Fashion in Shrouds&quot; he also mentions his first name being Rudolph but confides he changed it, asking people to call him Albert as he did not like the name Rudolph. In &quot;Look to the Lady&quot; the butler reveals to Lugg that he has deduced who Campion is by a particular feature of his pyjamas which he has also seen on Campion&#x27;s elder brother&#x27;s pyjamas.

Campion has used many other names in the course of his career. &#x27;Mornington Dodd&#x27; and &#x27;the Honourable Tootles Ash&#x27; are mentioned in &quot;The Crime at Black Dudley&quot;; &#x27;Christopher Twelvetrees&#x27; and &#x27;Orlando&#x27; are mentioned in &quot;Look to the Lady&quot;.

==Family and background==
Allingham makes various references to Campion&#x27;s aristocratic background, and hints at a connection to royalty in several asides. However, none of the books reveal his full birth name or identify more than an isolated individual or two in his family of origin. A study of the books suggests his father was a viscount and was already dead at the start of the series. Campion&#x27;s mother is mentioned several times and writes a letter in &quot;The Fashion in Shrouds&quot;, and Campion borrows a car from his older brother (apparently the current holder of the title) in &quot;Mystery Mile&quot;, but neither of them appears in person. In &quot;Sweet Danger&quot;, it was mentioned that his brother was &#x27;still unmarried&#x27; and therefore Campion is likely to &#x27;come into the title some day.&#x27; In &quot;Coroner&#x27;s Pidgin&quot; a character mentions Campion&#x27;s uncle, a bishop, and says, &#x27;Let me see, you&#x27;re the only nephew now, aren&#x27;t you?&#x27; This indicates that, by the middle of the Second World War, Campion&#x27;s older brother Herbert has died and Campion has inherited the title.

In &quot;More Work For the Undertaker&quot;, set just after the war, Lugg addresses Campion sarcastically as &#x27;young Viscount Clever&#x27;. Campion&#x27;s sister Valentine Ferris plays a central part in &quot;The Fashion in Shrouds&quot;; in that book, it is revealed that they are both estranged from most of their family. In &quot;Police at the Funeral&quot;, the venerable Caroline Faraday is aware of his true identity, and knows his grandmother Emily (whom she refers to as &#x27;The Dowager&#x27;) – she calls him by his real name, &#x27;Rudolph&#x27;, and states at one point that the rest of his family blame Emily for encouraging Campion in his adventurous ways.

In &quot;Safe as Houses&quot; he has a second cousin called Monmouth who has a mother called Lady Charlotte Lawn whom he refers to as his great aunt.

==Associates==
From &quot;Mystery Mile&quot; onwards, Campion is normally aided by his manservant, Magersfontein Lugg, an uncouth, rough-and-tumble fellow who used to be a burglar. Campion is good friends with Inspector (later Superintendent) Stanislaus Oates of Scotland Yard, who is as by-the-book as Campion is unorthodox, and in later books with Oates&#x27;s protégé Inspector Charles Luke.

In wartime, Campion is involved in intelligence work, and after the war he continues to have an unspecified connection to the secret services.

Campion also has many friends and allies, seemingly scattered all across London and the English countryside, often including professional criminals. In the short story &quot;The Meaning of the Act&quot; Campion explains to Oates that the secret of his success is to &#x27;take a drink with anyone, and pick your pals where you find &#x27;em&#x27;.

In &quot;Mystery Mile&quot; Campion is subtly shown to be in love with Biddy Paget, around whose home most of the story revolves; Campion is distraught when, at the end of the adventure, she marries an American, and his sadness at losing her is mentioned again in subsequent stories.

After a doomed passion for a married woman in &quot;Dancers in Mourning&quot;, Campion eventually marries Amanda Fitton, who first appears in &quot;Sweet Danger&quot; as a 17-year-old and later becomes an aircraft engineer; they have a son, named Rupert. Her brother Hal recovers the family title of Earl of Pontisbright as a result of the adventures described in &quot;Sweet Danger&quot;, and Amanda then becomes Lady Amanda, as the sister of an Earl.

==&quot;Mr Campion&#x27;s Farewell&quot;==

Crime writer Mike Ripley completed an unfinished Campion manuscript, started by Philip Youngman Carter before his death. The fragment, which contained revisions and minor corrections but no plot outline, character synopsis or plan, was bequeathed to Margery Allingham&#x27;s sister Joyce; upon her death in 2001, the manuscript was left to officials of the Margery Allingham Society. Beginning in 2012, Ripley, with the approval and agreement of the Margery Allingham Society, completed Youngman Carter&#x27;s manuscript, which has become &quot;Mr Campion&#x27;s Farewell&quot;. The novel was published in March 2014 by Severn House Publishers. Succeeding volumes were entirely Ripley&#x27;s work.

==Bibliography==

The Campion stories are generally adventures rather than true mysteries, as they rarely feature puzzles that the reader has a chance of solving; it is the characters and situations which carry the story. Most of the novels are short by modern standards – about 200 pages long.

<doc id="315245" wikidata="Q1045684" url="?curid=315245" title="Ricefish">
<text>The ricefishes are a family (Adrianichthyidae) of small ray-finned fish that are found in fresh and brackish waters from India to Japan and out into the Malay Archipelago, most notably Sulawesi (where the Lake Poso and Lore Lindu species are known as buntingi). The common name ricefish derives from the fact that some species are found in rice paddies. This family consists of about 37 species in two genera (some recognize a third, &quot;Xenopoecilus&quot;). Several species are rare and threatened, and some 2–4 may already be extinct.

==Description==

Most of these species are quite small, making them of interest for aquaria. &quot;Adrianichthys&quot; reach lengths of depending on the exact species involved, while the largest &quot;Oryzias&quot; reaches up to . Most &quot;Oryzias&quot; species are less than a half this length, with the smallest being up to only long. They have a number of distinctive features, including an unusual structure to the jaw, and the presence of an additional bone in the tail. 
The Japanese rice fish (&quot;O. latipes&quot;), also known as the medaka, is a popular model organism used in research in developmental biology. This species has traveled into space, where they have the distinction of being the first vertebrate to mate and produce healthy young in space.

Genetic study of the family suggests that it originally evolved on Sulawesi and spread from there to the Asian mainland; the supposed genus &quot;Xenopoecilus&quot; are apparently unrelated, morphologically divergent species of &quot;Oryzias&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The ricefish were formerly classified within the order Cyprinodontiformes but in the 1980s workers showed that they were a monophyletic grouping, mainly based on the characters on the bones of the gill arches and the hyoid apparatus, within the Beloniformes as the family Adrianichthyidae, this family making up one of the three suborders of the Beloniformes, the Adrianichthyoidei. Since then some workers have placed them in the Cyprinodontiformes but more recently molecular studies have supported their placement in the Beloniformes.

==History==
Ricefish are believed to have been kept as aquarium fishes since the 17th century. The Japanese ricefish was one of the first species to be kept and it has been bred into a golden color, from their original white coloring.

==Reproduction==
As with most fish, ricefish typically spawn their eggs, which are fertilised externally. However, some species, including the Japanese ricefish, are known to fertilise the eggs internally, carrying them inside the body as the embryo develops. The female then lays the eggs just before they hatch. Several other species carry their eggs attached to the body between their pelvic fins.

<doc id="315247" wikidata="Q2857193" url="?curid=315247" title="Great Antonio">
<text>Antonio Barichievich (October 10, 1925 – September 7, 2003), born Anton Barichevich and better known as The Great Antonio, was a Croatian-Canadian strongman, professional wrestler, and a Montreal eccentric artist. Barichievich was born in Zagreb, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Nothing is known about his early life and family aside that according to biographers he started to do menial work by the age of six and could uproot trees by age 12. During World War II, he spent time at the Bagnoli displaced persons camp. He arrived as refugee in Canada in 1945, and established himself in Montreal, Quebec. In the late 1940s, Barichievich made a name for himself with demonstrations of strength, and in 1952 he pulled a 433-tonne train 19.8 meters, a feat featured in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records.&quot;

Moving forward Barichievich would tour making demonstrations of strength and wrestled professionally. In 1960, he appeared for the second time in &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; by pulling four city buses loaded with passengers. Barichievich wrestled until the late 1970s and demonstrations of strength until the 1980s.

Until his death in 2003, Barichievich became a Montreal eccentric roaming the streets selling photomontage postcards of his past exploits. At the end of his life, his photomontages started to gain artistic recognition and are currently featured in museum exhibits.

== Early life ==
Barichievich was born Anton Baričević in Zagreb, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Biographers have written that he went to work with a pick and shovel at the age of six and was able to uproot trees with a cable around his neck by age 12. Antonio was at the Bagnoli displaced persons camp during World War II. In 1945, he arrived by refugee ship in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. He never discussed his experiences during World War II, but writers speculate that he was psychologically affected by whatever he saw and experienced.

== Career ==
=== Strongman competitions ===
Beginning in the late 1940s, Barichievich began appearing as a strongman in Montreal. He first made it into the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; in 1952 by pulling a 433-tonne train 19.8 metres.

In 1960, he made it again into &quot;Guinness&quot; by pulling four city buses loaded with passengers. He weighed 465 pounds (211 kg) and stood about 6 foot 4 inches (1.93 m). His suits were size 90 and his shoes size 28. He could eat 25 chickens or 10 steaks at one sitting.

During the 1970s he toured the world as a strongman and performer, appearing in world capitals and on popular TV variety shows.

Despite his imposing stature, Barichievich is said to have sung with a soft, beautiful voice, and at one time wanted to tour with Tiny Tim. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he made increasingly eccentric demands: he said he would pull a Boeing 747 down the tarmac provided Boeing gave him a jet for his own personal use, and he approached Don King saying that he would do a fight film for one million dollars.

=== Professional wrestling ===
In addition to strongman exhibitions, he participated in professional wrestling matches. As a younger wrestler he performed under the names Narcissus or Sweet Narcissus but by the late 1950s he had developed the Great Antonio persona. Barichievich purportedly almost won the Stampede North American Heavyweight Championship in wrestling in Calgary in 1971, but fans nearly rioted at the idea that Antonio, wrestling as a heel at the time, could appear and beat their hometown favorite. He was managed by Deepak Singh. His wrestling career continued into New Japan Pro-Wrestling through the 1970s without much success. On December 8, 1977, he lost a notorious match against Antonio Inoki during which Barichievich inexplicably began no-selling Inoki&#x27;s attacks and then stiffing Inoki; Inoki responded by shooting on Barichievich, knocking him down with palm strikes and kicks, and then stomping him into a bloody mess as he lay on the mat.

=== Film and television ===
Barichievich appeared in several movies, including &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; (1982), &quot;A 20th Century Chocolate Cake&quot; (1983), and &quot;Abominable Snowman&quot; (1996). In addition, he made appearances on several television shows, including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

=== Later life ===
As Barichievich grew older, he became a noted eccentric figure in his adopted home town of Montreal. He changed the story of his background on at least two occasions. In one instance, he claimed that, rather than being of Croatian descent, he was Italian. In his later years, he claimed that he was an extraterrestrial. Destitute, he frequented doughnut shops in Rosemont as well as Berri-UQAM metro station, where he sold postcards of himself and brochures outlining his life story. He carried &quot;every scrap of paper that had been written about him over the years, news clippings from all over the world, in garbage bags.&quot; According to Elliott Augustine of &quot;Erudit&quot;, Barichievich started making photomontage of his past exploits to turned them into postcards in 1972. He describes Barichievich&#x27;s work as well crafted, humorous, and &quot;works of art in their own rights&quot;.

Prior to his death in September 2003, Barichievich was working with Quartier Éphémère, to present his photomontage works in an exhibit about outsiders artists. the event took place between October and December of that year.

=== 2003 to present day: tributes and posthumous success ===
After his death, discovered among the clippings was a letter from the office of Bill Clinton, and old photos of Barichievich with people including Pierre Trudeau, Liza Minnelli, Lee Majors, Sophia Loren and Johnny Carson.

In 2008, the Quebecois group Mes Aïeux recorded a song in homage to Barichievich on their album &quot;La ligne orange&quot;, as well as a recording of a song sung by the strongman himself.

In 2014, Élise Gravel wrote and illustrated a children&#x27;s book about Barichievich. In 2015, a plaque and bench were dedicated to him in the Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie borough of Montreal, where he had lived the last 20 years of his life in a small apartment.

Also that year, the American Folk Art Museum presented Barichievich&#x27;s &quot;first institutional presentation of his works.&quot;

In 2017, The Barr Brothers reference Barichievich in their track &quot;Song That I Heard&quot; from the album &quot;Queens of the Breakers&quot;.

Also that year, Barichievich personal papers went into the archives of McCord Stewart Museum.

== Death ==
Barichievich died in 2003 at the age of 77 of a heart attack while in a grocery store in Montreal.

== Personal ==
He is believed to have been married at least twice, once in Europe and once in Canada, but he left behind no known descendants on either side.

<doc id="315251" wikidata="Q44802" url="?curid=315251" title="Río Negro Province">
<text>Río Negro (, &quot;Black River&quot;) is a province of Argentina, located in northern Patagonia. Neighboring provinces are from the south clockwise Chubut, Neuquén, Mendoza, La Pampa and Buenos Aires. To the east lies the Atlantic Ocean.

Its capital is Viedma near the Atlantic outlet of the province&#x27;s namesake river in the eastern extreme. The largest city is in the Andean foothills Bariloche in the far west. Other important cities include General Roca and Cipolletti.

==History==

Ferdinand Magellan was the first European explorer to visit the coasts of the provinces in 1520. Italian priest Nicolás Mascardi founded the Jesuit mission &quot;Nuestra Señora de Nahuel Huapi&quot; in 1670 at the shore of the Nahuel Huapi Lake, at the feet of the Andes range.

Originally part of the Argentine territory called Patagonia (in 1878 the &quot;Gobernación de la Patagonia&quot;), in 1884 it was organised into the &quot;Territorio Nacional del Río Negro&quot; and General Lorenzo Vintter was appointed as the territory&#x27;s first governor. It was only in 1957, that Río Negro acquired status of a province; its first provincial governor was Edgardo Castello of the Radical Civic Union (UCR).

==Geography==

Río Negro is one of the six provinces that make up Argentine Patagonia. It is bounded to the north by the Colorado River which separates it from La Pampa Province, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean and to the west by the Andes and the Limay River (serves as the natural border with Neuquén Province). The 42nd parallel south marks the southern limit of the province. With an area of , it is the 4th largest province by area.

===Climate===

The climate of the province is temperate at low elevations, and very cold in the higher Andean peaks.

====Temperature====
The mean annual temperatures in the province are relatively cold for its latitude owing to the marine currents to the east and higher altitude to the west. Mean annual temperatures in the province can vary, depending on altitude and distance from the sea. The northern parts of the province are the warmest, with a mean annual temperature of more than while the coldest areas are found in the Cordillera where the mean annual temperatures are less than . At the highest peaks, the mean annual temperature is less than freezing. Summer temperatures can exceed although the mean January temperatures range from . In contrast, the Andean region has milder summers with mean January temperatures of or less, depending on the altitude. In July, mean temperatures range from on the coast in the north to around in the central plateau.

====Humidity and precipitation====
Relative humidity is lower in the central plateau where they average 50%. Along the coastal regions, humidity is higher with a mean annual humidity of 60% while the Andean region has the highest humidity with an average annual humidity exceeding 65% due to the lower temperatures there. In all locations, humidity is lower in the summer and higher in the winter owing to the higher temperatures in the summer.

The Andes block most of the moisture from the Pacific Ocean from coming in, causing it to release most of the precipitation on its western slopes and as such, most of the province is dry, with a mean annual precipitation around . Coastal areas and northern parts of the province receive a slightly higher precipitation, where it can average above a year. The Andean region receives the most precipitation with areas receiving a mean annual precipitation of in which the precipitation gradient is very strong and increases westwards. In some places, precipitation can exceed a year. Most of the Andean region has a rainfall pattern that is Mediterranean like, similar to Central Chile in which most of the precipitation falls during the winter months and summers are dry.

====Wind and sunshine====
One dominant characteristic of the climate is the strong winds that are observed throughout the province. Summers tend to be windier than winters. Winds coming from the west, southwest and northwest are common, occurring 50% of the time (60% if calm winds are not included). There is some tendency for the winds to come from the east, particularly on the coastal regions when sea breezes from the east can occur when westerly winds are weak, which can be felt up to from the coast. The mean wind speed throughout the province varies with the northern parts having the lowest wind speeds while the highest altitude areas being the windiest. Except for the northern parts of the province, mean annual wind speeds exceed .

Cloud cover varies throughout the province, ranging from more than 60% in the Andean region to about 40% in the coastal areas. The central plateaus have intermediate amounts of cloud cover between these 2 regions. As such, the Andean region is cloudier than the rest of the province. Sunshine ranges from 10–11 hours of sunshine/day in January to about 5 hours of sunshine/day (less cloudier areas) to less than 3 hours of sunshine/day (more cloudier areas) in July.

==Demographics==


According to the results from the , the province has a population of 638,645 with 316,774 males and 321,871 females. It constitutes 1.6% of the total population in Argentina. This represented a 15.5% increase in the population compared to which had 552,822 inhabitants. Amongst of all the provinces in Patagonia, it is the most populous, containing 30.4% of the total population in Patagonia.

The province is home to four indigenous groups: The Tehuelches, the Puelches, the Pehuenches, and the Mapuches. Almost all of the indigenous population in the province are the Mapuches with the rest being small in number where their few descendants live in the neighbouring provinces. The Mapuches along with some of the Pehuenches originally lived in the western parts of the province although today, they mainly live in the southern parts of the province. The Tehuelches were nomadic people that hunted on the steppes in the province. The Puelches, being also nomadic, lived on the northern margins of Nahuel Huapi Lake and the surrounding forests in the Andean mountains, living off hunting and fishing. It is estimated that Mapuches started coming to the region before 1880 from Chile, leading to the imposition of their culture onto the other indigenous groups. Originally agricultural people, the Mapuches became nomadic upon arrival to the province due to the utilization of horses.

The province received immigrants mostly from Chile, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom during the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th century.

==Government==

The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.
As of December 2019, Arabela Carreras became governor of the province, following the retirement of Alberto Weretilneck due to term-limit. She is the first woman elected governor of the province.

The Constitution of Río Negro Province forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Río Negro Provincial Police.

==Political division==

The province is divided into 13 departments:

Department (Capital)

* Adolfo Alsina Department (Viedma)
* Avellaneda Department (Choele Choel)
* Bariloche Department (San Carlos de Bariloche)
* Conesa Department (General Conesa)
* El Cuy Department (El Cuy)
* General Roca Department (General Roca)
* 9 de Julio Department (Sierra Colorada)
* Ñorquinco Department (Ñorquincó)
* Pichi Mahuida Department (Río Colorado)
* Pilcaniyeu Department (Pilcaniyeu)
* San Antonio Department (San Antonio Oeste)

==Economy==

Argentina&#x27;s ninth-largest, Rio Negro&#x27;s economy is a diversified service-based one with vigorous agricultural and light manufacturing sectors. Its 2006 output was an estimated US$5.420 billion, or a per capita income of US$9,805. In 2013, its output increased to $43.349 billion Pesos (about US$7.939 billion) at current market prices.

There is a gold mine located at Calcatreu, near Ingeniero Jacobacci, owned by Pan American Silver. in December 2011 the provincial government repealed a law banning the use of cyanide in mineral processing, and the mine&#x27;s owners regarded this as a positive development which is likely to bring increased investment.

==Tourism==
There are two main areas of tourism in the province; the Andes and the Atlantic coast.

:The Andean Area
The most visited area is that of the lake district near San Carlos de Bariloche
inside the Nahuel Huapi National Park, and neighbouring Neuquén Province. This includes the Isla Victoria, &quot;Camino de los Siete Lagos&quot;, Los Arrayanes National Park, and many trekking paths among lakes.

:The Atlantic Coast
Returns of southern right whales are possibly the biggest of tourism attractions. They swim and rest very close to shore, and the San Matías Gulf is the only place in the world where swimming with this kind is commercially permitted.

<text>Catherine Michelle Schwartz (born May 27, 1977) is an American television presenter. She was formerly a co-host on the TechTV television program &quot;Call for Help&quot; with Chris Pirillo and Leo Laporte.

==Early years==
Schwartz earned degrees in Communication and Media studies from University of San Diego

==Career==
After a stint on TechTV&#x27;s &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;, Schwartz became co-host of &quot;Call for Help&quot; in 2002 with then co-host Chris Pirillo. After Pirillo left TechTV in April 2003, former host Leo Laporte returned to co-host with Schwartz. &quot;Call for Help&quot; was cancelled in May 2004 after TechTV&#x27;s merger with G4, resulting in G4techTV.

In the period after the cancellation of &quot;Call for Help&quot;, Schwartz appeared as a G4techTV technology expert on the &quot;Today Show&quot; segment &quot;Gender Wars&quot;. She also made guest appearances on short segments of &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;. She later signed on as a columnist with &quot;Stuff Magazine&quot;, with a column entitled &quot;Ask the Tech Chick&quot;.

She also appears in the music video &quot;Strange New Element&quot; by the band Low Water. Near the end of the video, she makes an appearance with fellow TechTV personalities Morgan Webb, Sarah Lane, Chi-Lan Lieu and Sumi Das.

On an episode of &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;, Schwartz claimed to have invented the Swiffer during her days as a college intern. Schwartz has said that she receives no royalties and signed away her rights to the product as part of Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s policy. The Swiffer was actually based on the Quickle Wiper, which was launched in 1995 in Japan thanks in part to the Quickle Wiper not being patent-protected. The Japanese product was released before Schwartz was a college intern.

In the early part of 2005, Schwartz and her friend Wynter Mitchell (&quot;Screen Savers&quot; teleprompter operator) started a podcast, which stopped on May 10, 2005. It was updated with two posts – one on July 31, 2007, and the other on August 5, 2007, but has not been updated since.

In 2008, Schwartz became a gadget and toy director for &quot;eBay Insider&quot;, a blog which claims to give consumers information from experts in their field, based on searches for products found on eBay.

In 2017 Schwartz became the founder and CEO of DGTL Advisors and DGTL NTWRK. DGTL NTWRK advises companies and individuals on how to use social media to gain a digital portfolio.

==Personal life==
In June 2003 Schwartz became the subject of a stir in the Internet community when it was discovered that at least two cropped photographs of herself she had posted on her personal blog contained hidden Exif thumbnail images clearly showing her bared breasts, because the program she used to edit them, Photoshop, did not create replacement thumbnails.

On November 25, 2005, Schwartz married &quot;South Park&quot; editor Keef Bartkus in Las Vegas, Nevada. Her married name is Catherine Michelle Bartkus but she retains the last name &quot;Schwartz&quot; in professional contexts. They divorced in 2007.

In June, 2006, Schwartz gave birth to a son, named Jack.

<doc id="315269" wikidata="Q18341392" url="?curid=315269" title="Murder of Kitty Genovese">
<text>In the early hours of March 13, 1964, Kitty Genovese, a 28-year-old bartender, was raped and stabbed outside the apartment building where she lived in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York, United States. Two weeks after the murder, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article erroneously claiming that thirty-seven witnesses saw or heard the attack, and that none of them called the police or came to her aid. The incident prompted inquiries into what became known as the bystander effect, or &quot;Genovese syndrome&quot;, and the murder became a staple of U.S. psychology textbooks for the next four decades.

Researchers have since uncovered major inaccuracies in the &quot;Times&quot; article, and police interviews revealed that some witnesses had attempted to contact authorities. In 1964, reporters at a competing news organization discovered that the &quot;Times&quot; article was inconsistent with the facts, but they were unwilling at the time to challenge &quot;Times&quot; editor Abe Rosenthal. In 2007, an article in the &quot;American Psychologist&quot; found &quot;no evidence for the presence of 38 witnesses, or that witnesses observed the murder, or that witnesses remained inactive&quot;. In 2016, the &quot;Times&quot; called its own reporting &quot;flawed&quot;, stating that the original story &quot;grossly exaggerated the number of witnesses and what they had perceived&quot;.

Winston Moseley, a 29-year-old Manhattan native, was arrested during a house burglary six days after the murder. While in custody, he confessed to killing Genovese. At his trial, Moseley was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. Moseley died in prison on March 28, 2016, at the age of 81, having served 52 years.

==Victim==
Catherine Susan &quot;Kitty&quot; Genovese (July 7, 1935 – March 13, 1964) was born in Brooklyn, New York, the eldest of five children of Italian-American parents Rachel () and Vincent Andronelle Genovese. Genovese was raised Catholic, living in a brownstone residence at 29 St. John&#x27;s Place in Park Slope, a western Brooklyn neighborhood populated mainly by families of Italian and Irish heritage.

In her teenage years, Genovese attended the all-girl Prospect Heights High School, where she was recalled as being &quot;self-assured beyond her years&quot; and having a &quot;sunny disposition&quot;. In 1954, after her mother witnessed a murder, Genovese&#x27;s family moved to New Canaan, Connecticut, while Genovese, who had recently graduated from high school, remained in Brooklyn with her grandparents to prepare for her upcoming marriage. Later that year, the couple wed, but the marriage was annulled near the end of 1954 due to Genovese&#x27;s sexuality as a lesbian.

After moving into an apartment in Brooklyn, Genovese worked in clerical jobs, which she found unappealing. By the late 1950s, she had accepted a position as a bartender. In August 1961 she was briefly arrested for bookmaking, as she had been taking bets on horse races from bar patrons. She and a friend, Dee Guarnieri, were fined $50 each () and she lost her job.

Genovese held another bartending position at Ev&#x27;s Eleventh Hour Bar on Jamaica Avenue and 193rd Street in Hollis, Queens, and was soon managing the bar on behalf of its absentee owner. By working double shifts she was able to save money, which she intended to use to open an Italian restaurant. She shared her Kew Gardens apartment at 82–70 Austin Street with Mary Ann Zielonko, her girlfriend since 1963; Zielonko died in 2024 at the age of 85.

==Attack==

At approximately 2:30 a.m. on March 13, 1964, Genovese left Ev&#x27;s Eleventh Hour Bar and began driving home in her red Fiat. While waiting for a traffic light to change on Hoover Avenue, she was spotted by Winston Moseley, who was sitting in his parked Chevrolet Corvair. Genovese arrived home around 3:15 a.m. and parked her car in the Kew Gardens Long Island Rail Road station parking lot, about from the door to her apartment, in an alleyway at the rear of the building. As she walked toward the building, Moseley, who had followed her home, exited his vehicle, which he had parked at a corner bus stop on Austin Street. Armed with a hunting knife, he approached Genovese.

Genovese ran toward the front of the building, and Moseley ran after her, overtook her and stabbed her twice in the back. Genovese screamed, &quot;Oh my God, he stabbed me! Help me!&quot; Several neighbors heard her cry, but only a few of them recognized the sound as a cry for help. When Robert Mozer, one of the neighbors, shouted at the attacker, &quot;Let that girl alone!&quot;, Moseley ran away and Genovese slowly made her way toward the rear of the building, seriously injured and out of view of any witnesses.

Witnesses saw Moseley enter his car, drive away and return ten minutes later. Shadowing his face with a wide-brimmed hat, he systematically searched the parking lot, the train station and an apartment complex, eventually finding Genovese, who was barely conscious and lying in a hallway at the back of the building, where a locked door had prevented her from going inside. Out of view of the street and of those who may have heard or seen any sign of the initial attack, Moseley stabbed Genovese several more times before raping her, stealing $49 from her and running away again. The attacks spanned approximately half an hour, and knife wounds in Genovese&#x27;s hands suggested that she attempted to defend herself. Her neighbor and close friend, Sophia Farrar, found Genovese shortly after the second attack and held her in her arms, whispering, &quot;Help is on the way&quot; until an ambulance arrived.

Records of the earliest calls to police are unclear, but the calls were not given a high priority; the incident occurred four years before New York City implemented the 9-1-1 emergency call system. One witness said his father called the police after the first attack and reported that a woman was &quot;beat up, but got up and was staggering around&quot;. A few minutes after the second attack, another witness, Karl Ross, called friends for advice on what to do before calling the police. Genovese was picked up by an ambulance at 4:15 a.m., and died en route to the hospital. She was buried on March 16, 1964, in Lakeview Cemetery in New Canaan, Connecticut.

==Police investigation==
Zielonko, Genovese&#x27;s girlfriend, was questioned by Detective Mitchell Sang at 7:00 a.m. on the morning after the murder. She was later interrogated for six hours by two homicide detectives, John Carroll and Jerry Burns, whose questioning centered on her relationship with Genovese. This was also the police&#x27;s focus when they questioned the couple&#x27;s neighbors. Initially, Zielonko was considered to be a suspect.

On March 19, 1964, six days after the stabbing, Moseley was arrested for suspected robbery in Ozone Park after a television set was discovered in the trunk of his car. The car was searched after a local man, Raoul Cleary, became suspicious when he saw Moseley removing the television from a neighbor&#x27;s house. Cleary questioned Moseley, who claimed to be a removal worker. However, after consulting another neighbor, Jack Brown, who confirmed that the homeowners were not moving, Cleary called the police. Brown disabled Moseley&#x27;s car to ensure he could not flee before police arrived. A detective recalled that a white car similar to Moseley&#x27;s had been reported by some of the witnesses to Genovese&#x27;s murder, and he informed Detectives Carroll and Sang. During questioning, Moseley admitted to the murders of Genovese and two other women – Annie Mae Johnson, who had been shot and burned to death in her apartment in South Ozone Park a few weeks earlier; and 15-year-old Barbara Kralik, who had been killed in her parents&#x27; Springfield Gardens home the previous July.

==Perpetrator==

Winston Moseley (1935–2016) was 29 years old at the time he murdered Genovese. He was from Ozone Park, Queens, and worked at Remington Rand as a tab operator, preparing the punched cards used at that time mainly for data input for digital computers. Moseley was married with three children and had no criminal record.

While in custody, Moseley confessed to killing Genovese. He detailed the attack, corroborating the physical evidence at the scene. He said that his motive for the attack was simply &quot;to kill a woman&quot;, saying he preferred to kill women because &quot;they were easier and didn&#x27;t fight back&quot;. Moseley stated that he got up that night around 2 a.m., while his wife was working nights as a registered nurse, and drove through Queens to find a victim.

Moseley saw Genovese on her way home and followed her to the parking lot before killing her. He also confessed to murdering and sexually assaulting two other women and to committing between thirty and forty burglaries. Subsequent psychiatric examinations suggested that Moseley was a necrophile.

===Trial===
Moseley was charged with the murder of Genovese but was not charged with the other two murders he had admitted to. For the police, a complicating factor was that another man, Alvin Mitchell, had also confessed to the murder of Barbara Kralik.

Moseley&#x27;s trial began on June 8, 1964, and was presided over by Judge J. Irwin Shapiro. Moseley initially pleaded not guilty, but his attorney later changed his plea to not guilty by reason of insanity. During his testimony, Moseley described the events on the night he murdered Genovese, along with the two other murders to which he had confessed and numerous other burglaries and rapes. The jury deliberated for seven hours before returning a guilty verdict at around 10:30 p.m on June 11. On June 15, Moseley was sentenced to death for the murder of Genovese. When the jury foreman read the sentence, Moseley showed no emotion, while some spectators applauded and cheered. Shapiro added, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in capital punishment, but when I see a monster like this, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to pull the switch myself.&quot;

On June 23, Moseley appeared as a defense witness in the trial of Alvin Mitchell for the murder of Barbara Kralik. After being granted immunity from prosecution, he testified that he had killed Kralik. The trial produced a hung jury, but Mitchell was convicted in a second trial.

On June 1, 1967, the New York Court of Appeals found that Moseley should have been able to argue that he was medically insane at the sentencing hearing when the trial court found that he had been legally sane, and the sentence was reduced to life imprisonment.

===Imprisonment and death===
On March 18, 1968, Moseley escaped from prison while being transported back from Meyer Memorial Hospital in Buffalo, where he had undergone minor surgery for a self-inflicted injury. He hit the transporting correctional officer, stole his weapon and fled to a nearby vacant house owned by a Grand Island couple, Mr. and Mrs. Matthew Kulaga, where he stayed undetected for three days. On March 21, the Kulagas went to check on the house, where they encountered Moseley, who held them hostage for more than an hour, binding and gagging Mr. Kulaga and raping Mrs. Kulaga. He then took the couple&#x27;s car and fled.

Moseley traveled to Grand Island where, on March 22, he broke into another house and held a woman and her daughter hostage for two hours before releasing them unharmed. He surrendered to police shortly afterward and was charged with escape and kidnapping, to which he pleaded guilty. Moseley was given two additional fifteen-year sentences to run concurrently with his life sentence.

In September 1971, Moseley participated in the Attica Prison riot. Later in the same decade, he obtained a Bachelor of Arts in sociology in prison from Niagara University. He became eligible for parole in 1984. During his first parole hearing, he told the parole board that the notoriety he faced due to his crimes made him a victim, stating, &quot;For a victim outside, it&#x27;s a one-time or one-hour or one-minute affair, but for the person who&#x27;s caught, it&#x27;s forever.&quot; At the same hearing, Moseley claimed he never intended to kill Genovese and that he considered her murder to be a mugging because &quot;people do kill people when they mug them sometimes.&quot; The board denied his request for parole.

Moseley returned for a parole hearing on March 13, 2008, the 44th anniversary of Genovese&#x27;s murder. He continued to show little remorse for Genovese&#x27;s murder, and parole was again denied. Genovese&#x27;s brother Vincent was unaware of the 2008 hearing until he was contacted by reporters for the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;. He has reportedly never recovered from his sister&#x27;s murder. &quot;This brings back what happened to her,&quot; Vincent had said; &quot;the whole family remembers&quot;.

Moseley was denied parole an eighteenth time in November 2015 and died in prison on March 28, 2016, at the age of 81. He had served 52 years, making him one of the longest-serving inmates in the New York State prison system.

==Reaction==
===Public reaction===
The murder did not receive much immediate media attention. It took a remark from New York City Police Commissioner Michael J. Murphy to &quot;New York Times&quot; metropolitan editor Abe Rosenthal over lunch – Rosenthal later quoted Murphy as saying, &quot;That Queens story is one for the books&quot; – to motivate the &quot;Times&quot; into publishing an investigative report. The article, written by Martin Gansberg and published two weeks after the murder, claimed that thirty-eight witnesses saw the murder, but an error reduced the number of witnesses by one in the headline, &quot;37 Who Saw Murder Didn&#x27;t Call the Police&quot;. It has been quoted and reproduced since 1964 with a corrected headline of &quot;Thirty-Eight Who Saw Murder Didn&#x27;t Call the Police&quot;. The public view of the story crystallized around a quote from the article by an unidentified neighbor who saw part of the attack but deliberated before finally getting another neighbor to call the police, saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to get involved.&quot; Many then saw the story of Genovese&#x27;s murder as emblematic of the callousness or apathy of life in big cities, and New York in particular.

Science-fiction author and cultural &quot;provocateur&quot; Harlan Ellison stated that &quot;thirty-eight people watched&quot; Genovese &quot;get knifed to death in a New York street&quot;. His June 1988 article in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; (later reprinted in his book &quot;Harlan Ellison&#x27;s Watching&quot;) referred to the murder as &quot;witnessed by thirty-eight neighbors, not one of whom made the slightest effort to save her, to scream at the killer, or even to call the police&quot;. He cited reports he claimed to have read that one man, &quot;viewing the murder from his third-floor apartment window, stated later that he rushed to turn up his radio so he wouldn&#x27;t hear the woman&#x27;s screams&quot;.

Public reaction to murders happening in the neighborhood supposedly did not change. According to a &quot;Times&quot; article dated December 27, 1974, ten years after Genovese&#x27;s murder, 25-year-old Sandra Zahler was beaten to death early Christmas morning in an apartment within a building that overlooked the site of the Genovese attack. Neighbors again said they heard screams and &quot;fierce struggles&quot; but did nothing.

In an interview on NPR on March 3, 2014, Kevin Cook, author of &quot;Kitty Genovese: The Murder, the Bystanders, the Crime That Changed America&quot;, said:

Thirty-eight witnesses – that was the story that came from the police. And it really is what made the story stick. Over the course of many months of research, I wound up finding a document that was a collection of the first interviews. Oddly enough, there were 49 witnesses. I was puzzled by that until I added up the entries themselves. Some of them were interviews with two or three people [who] lived in the same apartment. I believe that some harried civil servant gave that number to the police commissioner who gave it to Rosenthal, and it entered the modern history of America after that.

Two decades after the murder, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; began an article titled &quot;Justice in the wrong hands&quot; by saying: 

===Psychological research===
Harold Takooshian, writing in &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, stated that:

Psychologist Frances Cherry has suggested the interpretation of the murder as an issue of bystander intervention is incomplete. She has pointed to additional research such as that of Borofsky and Shotland demonstrating that people, especially at that time, were unlikely to intervene if they believed a man was attacking his wife or girlfriend. She has suggested that the issue might be better understood in terms of male/female power relations.

The apparent lack of reaction by numerous neighbors purported to have watched the scene or to have heard Genovese&#x27;s cries for help, although erroneously reported, prompted research into diffusion of responsibility and the bystander effect. Social psychologists John M. Darley and Bibb Latané started this line of research, showing that contrary to common expectations, larger numbers of bystanders decrease the likelihood that someone will step forward and help a victim. The reasons include the fact that onlookers see that others are not helping either, that onlookers believe others will know better how to help, and that onlookers feel uncertain about helping while others are watching. The Genovese case thus became a classic feature of social psychology textbooks in the United States and the United Kingdom.

In September 2007, &quot;American Psychologist&quot; published an examination of the factual basis of coverage of the Genovese murder in psychology textbooks. The three authors concluded that the story was more parable than fact, largely because of inaccurate newspaper coverage at the time of the incident. According to the authors, &quot;despite this absence of evidence, the story continues to inhabit our introductory social psychology textbooks (and thus the minds of future social psychologists).&quot; A survey of ten leading undergraduate psychology textbooks found the Genovese case in all ten of them, with eight textbooks suggesting that witnesses watched from their windows as Genovese was murdered, and two textbooks stating that some or most of the witnesses heard but could not see the attack.

==Inaccuracy of original reports==
More recent investigations have questioned the original version of events. A 2004 article in the &quot;Times&quot; by Jim Rasenberger, published on the fortieth anniversary of Genovese&#x27;s murder, raised numerous questions about claims in the original &quot;Times&quot; article. A 2007 study (confirmed in 2014) found many of the purported facts about the murder to be unfounded, stating there was &quot;no evidence for the presence of 38 witnesses, or that witnesses observed the murder, or that witnesses remained inactive&quot;. After Moseley&#x27;s death in March 2016, the &quot;Times&quot; called their second story &quot;flawed&quot;, stating:

Because of the layout of the apartment building and the fact that the attacks took place in different locations, no witness saw the entire sequence of events. Investigation by police and prosecutors showed that approximately a dozen individuals had heard or seen portions of the attack, though none saw or were aware of the entire incident. Only one witness, Joseph Fink, was aware Genovese was stabbed in the first attack, and only Karl Ross was aware of it in the second attack. Many were entirely unaware that an assault or homicide had taken place; some thought what they saw or heard was a domestic quarrel, a drunken brawl or a group of friends leaving the bar when Moseley first approached Genovese. After the initial attack punctured her lungs, leading to her eventual death from asphyxiation, it is unlikely that Genovese was able to scream at any volume.

A 2015 documentary, featuring Genovese&#x27;s brother William, discovered that other crime reporters knew of many problems with the story even in 1964. Immediately after the story broke, WNBC police reporter Danny Meehan discovered many inconsistencies in the original &quot;Times&quot; article, asking Gansberg why his article failed to reveal that witnesses did not feel that a murder was happening. Gansberg replied, &quot;It would have ruined the story.&quot; Not wishing to jeopardize his career by attacking a powerful figure like Rosenthal, Meehan kept his findings secret and passed his notes to fellow WNBC reporter Gabe Pressman. As a journalism instructor, Pressman taught a course in which some of his students called Rosenthal and confronted him with the evidence. Rosenthal was irate that his editorial decisions were being questioned by journalism students and angrily berated Pressman in a phone call.

On October 12, 2016, the &quot;Times&quot; appended an Editor&#x27;s Note to the online version of its 1964 article, stating that, &quot;Later reporting by The Times and others has called into question significant elements of this account.&quot;

==Creation of 9-1-1==
New York radio station WNYC, looking back in 2014, reported on how &quot;An Iconic Murder Helped Create the 9-1-1 System.&quot;

A confirming PBS report wrote how &quot;papers and media outlets ran with the story;&quot; they also added &quot;nearly a dozen books&quot; and when it came to film, mentioned &quot;James Solomon&#x27;s film &quot;The Witness&quot;&quot; more than once. The report&#x27;s &quot;The Genesis of 911&quot; section noted that &quot;Up until the late 1960s, there was no centralized number for people to call in case of an emergency.&quot;

==In popular culture==
The story of the witnesses who did nothing &quot;is taught in every introduction-to-psychology textbook in the United States and Britain, and in many other countries and has been made popularly known through television programs and books,&quot; and songs. It also now appears that the Kitty Genovese investigation and story was linked to false confessions in other cases.

WNYC, PBS and the &quot;New York Times&quot; lookback articles referenced in particular one film (&quot;The Witness&quot;) and have noted the cumulative impact of the murder to the development of the 911 system.

* The DC comic book series &quot;Watchmen&quot; (1986–1987) by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons references Genovese&#x27;s murder as a key influence behind the character Rorschach&#x27;s transformation into a vigilante. In the book, Rorschach&#x27;s mask is fashioned from cloth taken from a (fictional) dress Kitty Genovese had custom made. The &quot;Rorschach&quot; comic series (2020–2021), a distant sequel by Tom King, also references Genovese&#x27;s murder. The prequel series &quot;Nite Owl&quot; likewise references the event.

===Music===
* Genovese&#x27;s murder inspired folk singer Phil Ochs to write the song &quot;Outside of a Small Circle of Friends&quot;, released on the album &quot;Pleasures of the Harbor&quot; (1967) and as a single. This song relates five different situations that should demand action on the part of the narrator – one of them a woman outside being stabbed – but in each case the narrator concludes: &quot;I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t interest anybody outside of a small circle of friends&quot;.
* Following the killing of Meredith Hunter at the Altamont Free Concert in 1969, KSAN put on a four-hour telephone call-in program to discuss the events. A woman who called in gave details about the violent behavior of Hells Angels at the show and said people didn&#x27;t stop them because &quot;we were all in terror of them&quot;. At the concert, she had tried to speak up against the violence, but was warned to be quiet by the people around her, for fear of being beaten. In his response, KSAN&#x27;s Scoop Nisker mentioned the bystander effect and the Genovese story.
* The crime inspired singer Ruby Lynn Reyner from the band Ruby and the Rednecks to write the song &quot;Kitty&quot;, originally released on the album &quot;From the Wrong Side of Town&quot; (2004), also released on the album &quot;Live Again! at CBGB&#x27;s&quot;.
* The song &quot;Big Bird&quot; by AJJ on their 2011 album &quot;Knife Man&quot; references the Genovese murder.

* The Smiths song &quot;Death of a Disco Dancer&quot; on the 1987 album &quot;Strangeways Here We Come&quot; was inspired by the murder.

===Theatre===
* English composer Will Todd&#x27;s music theatre work, &quot;The Screams of Kitty Genovese&quot; (1999), is based on the murder.
* The Spanish theatre company Groc Teatre produced a theatrical piece titled &#x27;Genovese,&#x27; based on the Kitty Genovese case. This production won the Max Award (equivalent to the Tony awards in Spain).

<text>The Free University of Berlin (, often abbreviated as FU Berlin or simply FU) is a public research university in Berlin, Germany. It was founded in West Berlin in 1948 with American support during the early Cold War period as a Western continuation of the Friedrich Wilhelm University, or the University of Berlin, whose traditions and faculty members it retained. The Friedrich Wilhelm University (which was renamed the Humboldt University), being in East Berlin, faced strong communist repression; the Free University&#x27;s name referred to West Berlin&#x27;s status as part of the Western Free World, contrasting with communist-controlled East Berlin. 

In 2008, as part of a joint effort, the Free University of Berlin, along with the Hertie School of Governance, and WZB Social Science Research Center Berlin, created the Berlin Graduate School for Transnational Studies.

The Free University of Berlin was conferred the title of &quot;University of Excellence&quot; under the German Universities Excellence Initiative, of which it is part. As an institution of the Berlin University Alliance, the FU Berlin was included in the second funding line in 2019 as part of the Excellence Strategy.

==History==

The Free University of Berlin was established by students and scholars on 4 December 1948. The foundation is strongly connected to the beginning of the Cold War period.

The University of Berlin was located in the former Soviet sector of Berlin and was granted permission to continue teaching by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SMAD) in January 1946. The university came under increased communist influence and repression, as it became a battlefield for the political disputes of the postwar period. This led to protests by students critical of the prevailing system. Between 1945 and 1948, more than 18 students were brutally beaten and arrested or persecuted, and some were even executed by the Soviet secret police (NKVD). 

===Foundation (1948–2000)===
At the end of 1947, students demanded a university free from political influence. The climax of the protests was reached on 23 April 1948: after three students were expelled from the university without a trial, about 2,000 students protested at the &quot;Hotel Esplanade&quot;. By the end of April, the governor of the United States Army Lucius D. Clay gave the order to legally examine the formation of a new university in the western sectors of Berlin. On 19 June 1948, the &quot;preparatory committee for establishing a free university&quot; consisting of politicians, professors, administrative staff members and students, met. With a manifesto titled &quot;Request for establishing a free university in Berlin&quot;, the committee appealed to the public for support.

The municipal authorities of Berlin granted the foundation of a free university and requested the opening for the coming 1948/49 winter semester. Meanwhile, the students&#x27; committee in the German Democratic Republic protested against the formation, the GDR described the new university as the &quot;so-called free university&quot; in official documents until the fall of the Berlin Wall.

The council-manager government accepted the by-law on 4 November 1948. The by-law achieved prominence under its alias &quot;the Berlin model&quot;:
The university was founded as a statutory corporation (&quot;Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts&quot;) and was not directly subjected to the state, as it was controlled by a supervisory board consisting of six representatives of the state of Berlin, three representatives of the university and students. This form was unique in Germany at that time, as the students had much more influence on the system than before. Until the 1970s, the involvement of the students in the committees was slowly cut back while adapting to the model of the western German universities in order to be fully recognized as an equivalent university.

On 15 November 1948, the first lectures were held in the buildings of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science. The actual foundation took place on 4 December 1948 in the Titania Palace, the film theater with the biggest hall available in the western sectors of Berlin. Attendants of the event were not only scientists, politicians (the Governing Mayor Ernst Reuter amongst others) and students, but also representatives of American universities, among them Stanford University and Yale University. The first elected president of the Free University of Berlin was the historian Friedrich Meinecke.

By 1949, the Free University had registered 4,946 students. Until the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, many students came from the Soviet sector, often supported through the &quot;Währungsstipendium&quot; of the senate.

On 26 June 1963, the same day he delivered his &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; speech at Rathaus Schöneberg, John F. Kennedy was awarded honorary citizen status by the Free University and gave a ceremonial speech in front of the Henry Ford building, in which he addressed the future of Berlin and Germany under the consideration of the motto of the FU. Amongst the attendant crowd are also the Governing Mayor of Berlin Willy Brandt and the Chancellor of Germany Konrad Adenauer. His brother, Robert F. Kennedy visited the university in 1962 for the first time and in June 1964 for receiving his honorary degree from the &quot;Department of Philosophy&quot;. The speech he held at the event was dedicated to John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated the year before.

In the late 1960s, the Free University of Berlin was one of the main scenes of the German student movement of &#x27;68 as a reaction to the global student protests during that time. Significant issues included better living standards and education at the university, the Vietnam War, the presence of former Nazi Party members in the government as epitomized by the Globke affair, and continuing institutional authoritarianism. After the assassination of student Benno Ohnesorg and the attempt on the life of Rudi Dutschke, protests quickly escalated to violence throughout Germany. The events of the 68-movement provided the impulse for more openness, equality, and democracy in German society.

During the 1970s and the 1980s, the university became a &quot;Massenuniversität&quot; (&quot;mass/mega university&quot;) with 50,298 registered students in 1983. After reunification, the Free University of Berlin was the second-largest university in Germany (after the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich) with 62,072 students in the winter term of 1991/92. Shortly thereafter, the senate of Berlin decided to drastically reduce enrollment until 2003, the number of students shrank to 43,885 in the winter term of 2002/03.

Since 2000, the Free University of Berlin has revamped itself. The university&#x27;s research performance increased markedly with regard to the number of graduates, PhDs granted, and publications.

===Since 2000===
Since 2003, the FU Berlin has been regrouping its research capacities into interdisciplinary research focus areas called clusters.
Due to financial cutbacks and restructuring of medical schools in the same year, the medical institutions of the Free and Humboldt Universities of Berlin merged to create a joint department, the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin.

The year 2007 was another crucial year for the Free University of Berlin as it was the university with the most approved funding applications in the German Universities Excellence Initiative, and it is now one of nine elite German universities to receive funding for its future development strategy. In the same year, Free University of Berlin dedicated a monument to the founding students who were murdered during the protests. The university presents its Freedom Award to personalities who have made a special contribution toward the cause of freedom. The university received a total of 108 million euros from the Excellence Initiative for its approved projects between 2007 and 2012.

Based on its founding tradition, the Free University of Berlin seal to this day bears the Latin terms for Truth, Justice, and Liberty. The designer of the seal was art historian and former president of the Free University of Berlin, Edwin Redslob.

==Campuses==

===Campus Dahlem===
Most of the facilities of Free University of Berlin are located in the residential garden district of Dahlem in southwestern Berlin.
Around the beginning of the 20th century, Dahlem was established as a center for research of the highest caliber. Academic activity in Dahlem was supported by Friedrich Althoff, Ministerial Director in the Prussian Ministry of Culture, who initially proposed the foundation of a &quot;German Oxford&quot;.

The first new buildings housed government science agencies and new research institutes of the University of Berlin. The Kaiser Wilhelm Society – forerunner of the present-day Max Planck Society – was founded in 1911 and established several institutes in Dahlem.

A dynamic group of researchers carried out pioneering research resulting in numerous Nobel Prizes. Since its foundation, the Free University of Berlin has been using buildings formerly belonging to the Kaiser Wilhelm Society and, in addition, has added numerous architecturally innovative buildings.

The Free University of Berlin central campus consists of building ensembles within walking distance of each other (about 1.5 km radius). The planners oriented themselves along the type of campus found in the United States – a novelty in post-war Germany. The first independent structure to be completed on campus was the Henry Ford building, funded by the Ford Foundation. To that point, the university was housed in several older structures around the neighborhood, including the Otto Hahn building, which houses the &quot;Department of Biochemistry&quot; to this day. Thanks to further donations from the United States, Free University of Berlin was able to construct several new central building complexes including the Benjamin Franklin university clinic complex.

The largest single complex of university buildings is the &quot;Rost- und Silberlaube&quot;, which translates roughly to the &quot;Rust and Silver Lodges&quot;. This complex consists of a series of interlinked structures corresponding to either a deep bronze (hence, &quot;rust&quot;) or shiny white (&quot;silver&quot;) hue, surrounding a variety of leafy courtyards. It has been complemented in 2005 by a new centerpiece, the brain-shaped Philological Library, designed by British architect Lord Norman Foster. 

With 43 ha and around 22,000 species of plants, FU&#x27;s Berlin Botanical Garden in nearby Lichterfelde West is one of the largest of its kind.

==== Transportation ====
The main campus in Dahlem is well connected to central Berlin by public transportation. The stations Dahlem Dorf and Freie Universität (Thielplatz) connect the university to the Berlin U-Bahn system&#x27;s U3 line. The Lichterfelde West station of the S1 line of the Berlin S-Bahn connects the university to Berlin Mitte.

===Geocampus Lankwitz===
The campus in Lankwitz, formerly part of a teacher training college, is now home to the department of earth sciences and a part of the university archives. Until their move to Dahlem in 2008, the &quot;Institute for Media and Communication Studies&quot; was located there.

===Campus Düppel===
Most of the divisions of the &quot;Department of Veterinary Medicine&quot; are based in Düppel. It is 2 km southwest of the main campus and consists of numerous clinics and institutes, amongst them a small animal clinic, a clinic for horses and an institute of poultry diseases.

===Campus Benjamin Franklin===
Since the formation of the FU in 1948, it has used public hospitals as part of the medical faculty. Between 1959 and 1969, the &quot;Steglitz Clinic&quot;, located in Lichterfelde West about 3 km southeast of Dahlem, was built with large financial supports of the United States. The medical center became one of the biggest European medical establishments unifying all institutes, clinics and lecture halls. In honor of the support by the United States, the clinic was renamed &quot;University Clinic Benjamin Franklin&quot;. In 1994, it consists of 36 scientific institutes and 1,200 hospital beds. After the merger in 2003, it became part of the Charité medical school.

===Academic environment===

Today, the district of Dahlem is a hotspot for research and culture: Beside several institutes of the Max Planck Society (amongst others: The Max Planck Institute for Research in Education (MPIB), the MPI for the History of Science, the MPI for Molecular Genetics, the Fritz Haber Institute (FHI) working in the fields of molecular physics and physical chemistry and the archive of the MPG), the campus is home to the Zuse Institute Berlin as well as some federal institutions like the Federal Institute for Materials Research (BAM) and the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR).

The Berlin Geography Society founded in 1828, the &quot;Berlin University for Professional Studies&quot; and the German Archeological Institute (DAI) are also located on the campus. In addition, Dahlem is an important location for the Berlin State Museums group, housing the Ethnological Museum of Berlin and the Museum of Asian Art.

===Student Village===
During the 1960s, a student village with 27 buildings was constructed near Schlachtensee lake serving as housing opportunities for students.

===Libraries===

With an inventory of 8.5 million volumes and over 25,000 journals distributed in the central university library (UB) and 49 specialized libraries of the institutes, the library system of the FU is the largest in Germany. Items published since 1990 are fully digitalized and accessible through an OPAC. The UB is granted the status &quot;United Nations Depository Library&quot; and is linked to the global library system of the UN under direction of the Dag Hammarskjöld Library in New York. The European Union also uses the UB as a &quot;European Documentation Center&quot;. As part of the library of the UN and the EU, it contains all publications of the UN General Assembly, the UN Security Council, the International Court of Justice as well as publications from the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

Although the UB is generally a lending library, some smaller libraries of the departments are so called &quot;Präsenzbibliotheken&quot;, where students are only able to read books or journals.
Since 2005, the FU creates a new library with about 12,250 m2 of usable space. It is planned to include all libraries of the natural science departments and the smaller institutes in the humanities (e.g. Egyptology). The projected costs are around 51 million euros. Construction work started in March 2012 with plans on finishing at the end of 2014.

==Organisation and governance==

===Administration===
The executive board consists of the president (Prof. Dr. Günter M. Ziegler), an executive vice president (Prof. Dr. Klaus Hoffmann-Holland) and three other vice presidents, as well as the Director of Administration and Finance (Dr.-Ing. Andrea Bör).
There are also supporting offices for Public Affairs and the General Counsel for legal affairs.
There are currently eight central service institutions (ZE) of the FU:
* Botanical Garden Berlin and Botanical Museum Berlin
* Center for Academic Advising, Career and Counselling Services
* Center for Continuing Studies
* Center for Recreational Sports
* Center for the Promotion of Woman&#x27;s and Gender Studies
* Computing Services (ZEDAT)
* Language Center
* Academic library

The ISQ (&quot;Institut für Schulqualität der Länder Berlin und Brandenburg&quot;, &quot;Institute for Quality of Schools in Berlin and Brandenburg&quot;) is an independent facility on the campus. It consults local schools and the senate to achieve and develop a high standard of school quality in Berlin and Brandenburg and closely cooperates with the &quot;Department of Education and Psychology&quot; of the FU.

The Collegium Musicum of Free University of Berlin was founded during the first semester in 1948/49. Under conductor Karl Forster, it merged with the ensemble of Technische Universität Berlin in 1954. Today, the Collegium Musicum has around 500 members from all fields of studies who spend their leisure time making music. It currently consists of five ensembles: a big choir, a chamber choir, two symphony orchestras and a big band. There are frequently events on which the Collegium Musicum plays, for instance on ceremonies.

===Structure===
With 12 academic departments (&quot;Fachbereiche&quot;) and three interdisciplinary central institutes, the university can be seen as an &quot;universitas litterarum&quot; (a traditional university where studies in all basic sciences is possible). Despite the variety of subjects, apart from computer science, studies in the field of engineering can only be done at Technische Universität Berlin or universities of applied science &quot;(Fachhochschulen)&quot;.

===Interdisciplinary Central Institutes===
*John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies
*Institute for East European Studies
*Institute for Latin American Studies

==Academics==

===Admissions===
With 33,000 applicants for the undergraduate programs (Bachelor) in 2013, admissions at Free University of Berlin remain highly competitive as the university only offers about 4,300 places each year. Due to the high numbers of applicants, most undergraduate programs at Free University of Berlin have limitations determined through the NC.In some cases (especially Medicine, Psychology and Political Science), the NC every year is as high as 1.0 (&quot;see Grades in Germany and Abitur&quot;).
Critical applicants which just scored slightly below the NC can be invited to a selective interview or an entry exam, depending on the department/faculty.
Applicants at Charité medical school who do not directly fulfill the NC-criteria have to pass an entry exam, which covers the basic fields of Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics in addition to passing a selective interview. Both results are then added to the Abitur grade. The final decision depends on the results of the competitors.

===Teaching and learning===

Free University of Berlin operates on a semester calendar where the winter term begins on 1 October and ends on 31 March. The exact same model can be found at almost every university in Germany. The time where lectures are being held varies each year, normally beginning around mid-October and ending as early as mid-February.
Free University of Berlin offers a broad spectrum of subjects in over 190 degree programs. A speciality of the FU is the possibility to study a vast number of &quot;small subjects&quot; (e.g. theater and film studies, Egyptology, Byzantine studies, Jewish studies, Turkology, Sinology, Communication studies, Meteorology, Bioinformatics, Biochemistry) with a high level of specialization. Due to the Bologna process, most of the undergraduate programs are now leading to the three-year Bachelor&#x27;s degree with 180 ECTS. At Free University of Berlin, Bachelor programs are generally divided into three categories: a regular Bachelor called &quot;Mono-Bachelor&quot;, a combined Bachelor (&quot;Kombi-Bachelor&quot;) consisting of two fields of studies and a combined Bachelor with a teaching option. Besides the core subject(s), all students are required to complete a series of courses related to general professional skills (ABV).
The old Diplom and Magister artium programs are still running, but do not accept new admissions anymore. In the fields of Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy and the law, students enroll in programs with &quot;Staatsexamen&quot;. Free University of Berlin also offers a variety of graduate degrees, from the master&#x27;s degree to doctoral degrees.
Apart from the regular Master&#x27;s programs, there are a variety of international programs taught in English, especially in the life sciences.

Free University of Berlin does not charge any tuition fees in the classical sense. Since 2003, public universities in Berlin introduced the model of semester contributions (&quot;Semesterbeiträge&quot;). It consists of an enrollment/re-registration fee, a contribution to the student union (&quot;Studentenwerk&quot;), a contribution for the student government and the fee for the semester ticket (public transportation pass) for the current semester. The fees for the semester ticket is defined by a contract with the local transportation company, the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg and allows students to move freely in the ABC zones of Berlin. In the winter semester of 2013/14, students are required to pay €285.83 in total.
Since 2011, Free University of Berlin participates in the national &quot;Germany Scholarship&quot; program organized by the federal government, universities and numerous private companies. Highly talented and committed students can get €300 monthly.

===Research===
In terms of external endowments by the DFG, Free University of Berlin ranks third behind the RWTH Aachen University and LMU Munich. Between 2009 and 2013, 289 foreign guest researchers came to the university through fellowships granted by the renowned Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, making the FU the most popular destination for foreign researchers in Germany.

In the field of natural sciences, research focuses on basic research with a strong emphasis on interdisciplinarity, whereas research in the humanities focuses on the current economical, political and cultural development of society (transformation processes, effects of globalization and environmental politics).
In the field of Earth sciences, the FU has contributed to various aeronautical missions, e.g. the Mars Express and the Cassini-Huygens to Saturn.

Excluding the Charité medical school, which is co-administered by the university with the Humboldt University, Free University of Berlin is currently the lead university for eight collaborative research centers of the German Research Foundation and also has five DFG research units. It is part of the Berlin University Alliance.

In the 2024 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the university is ranked 102th internationally and 9th in Germany. Because of an unresolved dispute over the counting of Nobel laureates before the Second World War (both Humboldt and Free University of Berlin claim to be the rightful successor of the University of Berlin), both do not appear in the &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; (&quot;ARWU&quot;) anymore. The last &quot;ARWU&quot;, placed the FU at 83rd in the world in 2007.

In the 2023 QS Subject Ranking, Free University of Berlin ranks first in Germany in English, modern languages, politics, and sociology. In the 2023 THE Subject Ranking, Free University of Berlin ranks first in Germany in the social sciences.

In the CHE &quot;SubjectRanking&quot;, Freie Universität has been evaluated as one of Germany&#x27;s best universities in Earth sciences, Computer science and Philosophy and also ranks among the Top 5 in Psychology, English studies and Education.

==Global partnerships==
Free University of Berlin maintains wide-ranging international contacts with top universities and organizations which provide key impulses for research and teaching. In the 1950s, the Free University of Berlin had already established partnerships with leading universities in the United States such as the University of California System (including the University of California, Berkeley, the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of California, Santa Cruz), the University of Chicago, Cornell University, Stanford University (which also has a small campus within the FU), Duke University, Princeton University, Yale University, and Columbia University, as well as with Western European universities such as the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, University College London, the University of Sussex and the in Paris.

The university is a founding member of the global educational center for the study of transnational law, the Centre for Transnational Legal Studies in London.
First contacts with universities in Eastern Europe were made in the 1970s. In the 1990s, links were in particular extended to include growing numbers of institutions in Canada (McGill University, University of Alberta, York University), Eastern Europe, and the Far East (China: Peking University, Fudan University, Nanjing University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Japan: University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, Nagoya University, Waseda University; South Korea: Korea University, Yonsei University, Seoul National University). The newly established &quot;Centre for International Cooperation (CIC)&quot; concentrates on identifying new strategic partners for international projects.

Today, Free University of Berlin has established over 400 partnerships in five continents, many of them as part of the European ERASMUS program.
Every year, about 600 visiting scientists contribute to the university teaching and research. For the grant programs in Germany, the Free University of Berlin is one of the first choices both for the ERASMUS and Tempus as well as for the Fulbright program and the international programs of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).
An International Summer and Winter University (FUBiS) has been set up for international students offering (semi-)intensive German courses and numerous subject courses.

===International branch offices===
The Free University of Berlin operates foreign branch offices in New York City, Brussels, Moscow, Beijing, Cairo, São Paulo, and New Delhi. The foreign branch offices work to expand upon cooperation partnerships already existing with universities in the country.

In April 2005, the Free University of Berlin, in conjunction with Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU Munich), opened a joint representative office in New York. This German University Alliance, located in German House, the seat of the German Consulate General and the German UN Mission, represents the interests of the two universities in the United States and Canada and works to increase the exchange of students and scientists.

In addition, the Free University of Berlin, as the first German institution of higher education, founded an alumni and fundraising organization, the Friends of the Freie Universität Berlin (FFUB) in New York. Since 2003 this organization has maintained close contact with alumni and scientists of the Free University of Berlin in the U.S. and attempts to gain alumni and friends as sponsors, to strengthen the long-lasting trans-Atlantic relations. Some of the proceeds from these fundraising activities were contributed to the renovation of the Henry Ford Building.

In April 2006 Peking University opened its first branch in Germany. Its objectives include the promotion of knowledge of Chinese culture, the cultivation of Chinese-German cooperation, and the spread of the Chinese language. Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, has a Berlin program (Duke in Berlin) that is held in cooperation with the Free University of Berlin and Humboldt University. The University of California System organizes programs for American students in Berlin and Potsdam. The UC System maintains an office at the Free University of Berlin to attend to the needs of exchange students from the California campuses.

The Office of Global Programs of Columbia University in New York administers the Berlin Consortium for German Studies. Students from Columbia University and the other colleges and universities included in the consortium (University of Chicago, Cornell University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Vassar College) can attend classes at the Free University of Berlin for one or two semesters as external students. This temporary enrollment is preceded by a six-week intensive language program.

==Notable people==

Alumni of the Free University of Berlin include several scientists, philosophers and politicians, amongst them five Nobel Prize winners and 15 Leibniz laureates.

<text>Skitgubbe, () and also called Mas, Mjölis, Mjölnarmatte, or Flurst (in the United States), is a popular Swedish card game that is rated as one of the best for three players. It has two phases: in the first, players accumulate cards; in the second players aim to discard the accumulated hand. The last player to go out is the &quot;skitgubbe&quot;. Sometimes, the &quot;skitgubbe&quot; must make a goat noise.

The first phase is unusual for a trick-taking game, in that there is sloughing of cards that match played cards, while play goes around the table.

== History ==
Skitgubbe&#x27;s predecessor is probably the Finnish game of &quot;Myllymatti&quot;, which is first mentioned in 1808. The Finnish word is a combination of &quot;mylly&quot;, which means mill, and &quot;Matti&quot;, which is the Finnish form of the name Mats. The miller Mylly Matti is part of Finnish folklore and is described by Zacharias Topelius as a good-hearted, easily deceived fellow who often walks around with a sack. The Finnish name of the game was translated to &quot;Mjölnarmatte&quot; in Swedish and was first mentioned under this name in 1875. Mjölnarmatte was soon simplified to &quot;Mjölis&quot; (known since 1890) and &quot;mas&quot; (known since 1905). Mas can be understood both as a lazy and tardy person and as a transformation of the name Mats. The name Skitgubbe for the game has been known since 1953, but did not begin to be used in gaming literature until the 1980s.

The first Swedish rules were published in Kortoxen in 1949 under the name Mas. Today the game is usually called Skitgubbe or Mas. The name Mas occurs especially in parts of the country where Skitgubbe is used for the game of Vändtia. According to the games expert Dan Glimne, today&#x27;s Skitgubbe is one of the most played card games in Sweden. In Finland the game is now called &quot;Koira&quot;, which means dog, and in Norway a similar game is played called &quot;Mattis &quot;.

It is unclear how the rules of the game have evolved over time. Closely related games were formerly played in German-speaking circles in the Baltics under the name Müller Matz (a direct translation of Myllymatti into German) and in Russia under the name &quot;Melniki&quot; (&quot;miller&quot;). The rules of the Russian game are very similar to a variant described in Kortoxen and called Mas with upturned trump. It is possible that this corresponds to an original or early variant of the game.

== Rules ==
Skitgubbe is a game for three or more players using a regular fifty-two card pack without jokers. There are a large number of rule variations, and some of the most common are given below. The denominations have the usual ranking with Aces at the top and Deuces at the bottom.

The game has two different phases. In the first phase, the players try to take cards that give as favourable a starting position as possible before the second phase, where you must get rid of the cards again as quickly as possible. The game is about avoiding being the last person sitting with cards in hand. Whoever does that has lost and become a &quot;skitgubbe&quot;. So there is no winner, only a loser.

=== Deal ===
The dealer deals three cards each, clockwise, starting with forehand, the player on the left. The cards are normally dealt singly. The remaining cards are placed face down in the middle of the table and form the talon.

=== Phase 1 ===
Phase 1 is a trick-taking round where the winner of a trick captures all the cards in it. In some variants of Skitgubbe only two players play for each trick in this phase, in other variants everyone plays for each trick. The latter is probably the most common way to play these days.

The suit normally doesn&#x27;t matter in the first phase, but there is an older variation where you play with the trump upcard and where the trick can only be won by the highest trump or the highest card of the led suit if no trumps are played. This variant is now rare.

==== Two-player tricks ====
Forehand leads to the first trick, and the player next in clockwise order also plays a card. Whoever plays the highest rank wins the trick; suit doesn&#x27;t matter. If both play the same rank or denomination, it is called &quot;countering&quot; or &quot;bouncing&quot; or a &quot;counterplay&quot;. The players then play one more card each. If both play the same denomination again, they play another card again and so on. After each card played, the player immediately draws a new card from the talon, so that players always have three cards in their hands. A player with poor cards in hand may play the top card from the talon to the trick. This is called &#x27;taking a chance&#x27; or &#x27;daring&#x27;.

Trick play continues in the same way as in the first trick. Only two players play to each trick. The winner of a trick leads to the next, and the player immediately to the left plays as the second (and last) person to the trick.

The player who draws the last card from the talon may neither look at this card nor play it to a trick, but leaves it face down next to self. Players continue to play with the cards in their hands. If the person who should lead to a trick is out of cards, the turn to lead continues clockwise. The same principle applies if the player who plays last to the trick has no cards. The trick taking continues until there are no longer at least two players with enough cards to complete a trick.

If the last trick cannot be decided because there has been a counterplay and either player has no cards left, the players take back the cards they played to the trick and add up their tricks taken.

==== All-player tricks ====
Forehand leads one or more equally ranked cards to the first trick. Other players in clockwise order then take turns playing one or more equally ranked cards. Suit is irrelevant. A player who has played to the trick draws an equal number of new cards from the talon, so that players have three cards in their hands at all times.

The trick is won by the player who played the card or cards of the highest rank. If more than one player has played cards of the highest rank, those players play to the trick once more in the same turn order. Whoever plays the highest card(s) wins. If the trick is still undecided, the players who played the highest card(s) the second time continue to play to the trick once more, and so on if it happens again. Players constantly replenishing their hands from the talon so that they have three cards. Playing card(s) of the same rank as the highest cards that have already been played to the trick is called making a &quot;counterplay&quot;.

When the trick, including any counterplays, is decided and players have replenished their hands to three cards, those players who so wish may add additional cards to the trick pile of denominations that are already there. This is called &quot;sloughing&quot; or &quot;sluffing&quot; and does not affect who wins the trick. The players then draw an equal number of new cards from the talon to bring their hands back up to three cards. A player may slough cards of more than one denomination, but after the player has drawn new cards from the talon to replace those sloughed, no additional cards may be sloughed.

&quot;Variation:&quot; players may only slough cards of the same denomination as they themselves played. This may be done at any time after the player has played to the trick. A player who draws more cards of the same denomination that he has played or sloughed may also slough these cards and draw new ones from the talon, and so on if it happens again. If there is a counterplay, the players who re-play to the trick get to slough more cards of the denomination they are re-playing. However, they may not throw in any more cards of the denomination they played before.

&quot;Variation:&quot; Any player may slough cards at any time after the first play and before the trick has been turned over. The cards are placed at the top of the trick pile and do not affect who wins the trick. A player who sloughs cards must always draw an equal number of new cards from the talon. The cards may be thrown in even after you have started to settle for the victory in the trick after a counterplay, and it is allowed to throw in additional cards after you have already thrown in cards and drawn new cards from the talon. A player who sloughs cards directly before or after they play cards to the trick should of course clarify which cards are being played and which are being sloughed.

&quot;Optional rule:&quot; If two or more players play cards of the same denomination to the trick, those cards beat all cards of denominations played by only one player. A player thus makes a counterplay, even if the cards of the same rank are lower than the highest rank in the trick up to that point. If a counterplay is made in several denominations, the counterplay of the highest denomination beats the others. Players who tie for the lead in the trick resolve it in the usual way by playing again to the trick. Also when players play the second time to a trick, a counterplay beats all other cards and a higher-ranked counterplay beats a lower-ranked counterplay. When playing with this optional rule, it is also convenient to use the variantion above that the players may only slough cards of the denomination they themselves played.

&quot;Optional rule:&quot; A player who can make a counterplay must do so. If you play as usual – that is, without the optional rule above – this means that a player who has one or more cards of the highest rank in the trick up to that point must play one or more of these cards. If playing with the optional rule above, the following applies: a player who can play one or more cards of a rank that has already been played to the trick must do so, unless a counterplay of another, higher rank has already been made. In such a case, the player cannot tie the trick and may play any card. A player who can counterplay in several different denominations must counterplay in the highest one.

A player who doesn&#x27;t like his cards may play the top card from the talon to the trick. This is called &quot;taking a chance&quot; or &quot;daring&quot;.

The winner of a trick leads to the next.

The player who draws the last card from the talon may neither look at this card nor play it to a trick, but leaves it face down next to self. Players continue to play from their hands, until any player whose turn it is to play a trick has no cards left. If at this point the last trick is not completed, all players take back the cards they played to that trick.

&quot;Variation:&quot; When a player has taken the bottom card from the talon, the current trick is completed if possible and phase 1 is then over. If the last trick cannot be completed, all players take back the cards they played to that trick.

=== Between phases ===
When phase 1 is over, the player who drew the last card from the talon turns the card over so it is visible. The suit of the card indicates trumps in phase 2.

Players pick up all the cards they have won in tricks and combine them with any cards left in the hand or taken back from the last trick. The player who drew the last card from the talon also picks up this card.

&quot;Optional rule:&quot; If at this point one or more players have fewer than 5 cards in their hand, these players may share all so-called rubbish cards, i.e. all those from the 2s to the 5s. If applicable, all the players – even those who will receive low cards – sort out all the 2s, 3s, 4sand 5s from their hands. Note that the low trumps must also be sorted out. The low cards are shuffled by one of the other players and dealt out one by one to the players concerned. This is a standard rule in the United States. &quot;Variation:&quot; The minimum number of cards required to avoid the low cards may also be six, seven or ten.

&quot;Variation:&quot; Players who have too few cards are dealt the low cards according to the optional rule above, but the minimum number of cards required to avoid this is specified by the face value of the trump upcard. Aces count in this context as 14, Kings as 13, Queens as 12 and Jacks 11.

=== Phase 2 ===
The player who drew the last card from the pack goes first in phase 2. A player who plays to a trick in this phase may play any card or sequence from his own hand. A sequence is an unbroken succession of cards of a suit, for example 9 10 J.

Play proceeds clockwise. A player playing to the trick must play a card or sequence of the same suit and of higher rank than the top card or play a card or sequence in trump. If the trump is at the top of the pile, of course the only option left is to overtrump. Leading a card or a sequence to a trick or playing a card or sequence to a trick is called making a &#x27;lay&#x27; (&quot;läggning&quot;).

If a player is unable or unwilling to play cards to a trick, he must take the top card from the trick pile and all cards in sequence from this card. Note that this applies even if the sequence has been played in several lays. For example, if A plays the 3, B plays the 6 and 7, C plays the 8, 9 and 10 and D cannot overtake, then D must pick up the entire sequence from 6 to 10 (but not the three, as it does not sit in an unbroken sequence with the others). Picking up cards is usually called &#x27;plucking&#x27; (&quot;plocka&quot;) or &#x27;tanking up&#x27; (&quot;supa&quot;).

&quot;Variation:&quot; A player picking up must pick up the bottom sequence of the trick pile. This is the standard rule in the United States.

&quot;Variation:&quot; A player who picks up must not take the top (or bottom, if you play with that variant) sequence in the stack, but the top (bottom) lay. In the example above, D should only pick up 8, 9 and 10 (provided that it is the top lay to be picked up).

&quot;Variation:&quot; It is not allowed to play sequences. Players may only play one card at a time. When playing with this variant, a player who pick up must always only take the top (or bottom) card.

If someone picks up, the turn to play to the trick rotates clockwise. The player whose turn it is must, in the same way as before, either overtake the top card of the pile or draw a card. If this player also picks up, he or she must take the top card and all cards in sequence from that and the turn to play to the trick proceeds clockwise. If a player picks up the last card(s) in the trick pile, the next player in clockwise order leads to a new trick.

A trick is complete when there are cards from as many lays in the trick pile as there were active players left when the lead to the trick was made. Playing last to a trick and thus ending it is called completing a trick. For example, suppose four people still have cards left in their hand. A leads, B and C both overtake, and D chooses to pick up. Assume further that the cards from B and C form an unbroken sequence. D must then pick up both B&#x27;s and C&#x27;s cards, and only the cards from A&#x27;s play remain in the trick pile. A is again on lead and must overtake the cards played before. If then B and C both overtake, there are cards from four lays in the trick: A&#x27;s play, A&#x27;s second play to the trick, and B&#x27;s and C&#x27;s second play to the trick. The trick is thus complete. The player completing the trick discards the cards from the trick pile face up into a separate pile and leads to the next trick. The discarded cards are no longer in the game.

A player who no longer has any cards left has gone out and is no longer at risk of becoming the &quot;skitgubbe&quot;. If a player goes out at the same time as he is completing a trick, the next lead is made by the next player in clockwise order. As soon as the second last player has disposed of their last card, the game is over, and the remaining player is the &quot;skitgubbe&quot;.

Melniki: The Russian game of Melniki was played like Mas with a trump turnup, but with the difference that a player who could follow suit was not allowed to draw, but had to play a card. A player who could not follow a suit, but had a trump, however, could choose to draw or trump. The Mas rules that a player with three trumps may draw new cards and that the player with the two trumps may steal the turnup are not mentioned in the Russian source.

<text>The common sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos) is a small Palearctic wader. This bird and its American sister species, the spotted sandpiper (&quot;A. macularia&quot;), make up the genus &quot;Actitis&quot;. They are parapatric and replace each other geographically; stray birds of either species may settle down with breeders of the other and hybridize. Hybridization has also been reported between the common sandpiper and the green sandpiper, a basal species of the closely related genus &quot;Tringa&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
The common sandpiper was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Tringa hypoleucos&quot;. The species is now placed together with the spotted sandpiper in the genus &quot;Actitis&quot; that was introduced in 1811 by the German zoologist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger. The genus name &quot;Actitis&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;aktites&quot; meaning &quot;coast-dweller&quot; from &quot;akte&quot; meaning &quot;coast&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;hypoleucos&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;hupo&quot; meaning &quot;beneath&quot; with &quot;leukos&quot; meaning &quot;white&quot;. The species is monotypic and no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The adult is long with a wingspan. It has greyish-brown upperparts, white underparts, short dark-yellowish legs and feet, and a bill with a pale base and dark tip. In winter plumage, they are duller and have more conspicuous barring on the wings, though this is still only visible at close range. Juveniles are more heavily barred above and have buff edges to the wing feathers.

This species is very similar to the slightly larger spotted sandpiper (&quot;A. macularia&quot;) in non-breeding plumage. But its darker legs and feet and the crisper wing pattern (visible in flight) tend to give it away, and of course they are only rarely found in the same location.

==Distribution and migration==
The common sandpiper breeds across most of temperate and subtropical Europe and Asia, and migrates to Africa, southern Asia and Australia in winter. The eastern edge of its migration route passes by Palau in Micronesia, where hundreds of birds may gather for a stop-over. They depart the Palau region for their breeding quarters around the last week of April to the first week of May.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The Common Sandpiper is usually encountered alone, occasionally in small groups, although larger flocks are sometimes formed around migration or at breeding season roosts. It seldom joins multispecies flocks. This species has a distinctive stiff-winged flight, low over the water.

===Breeding===
It nests on the ground near freshwater. When threatened, the young may cling to their parent&#x27;s body to be flown away to safety.

===Feeding===
The common sandpiper forages by sight on the ground or in shallow water, picking up small food items such as insects, crustaceans and other invertebrates; it may even catch insects in flight.

==Conservation==
It is widespread and common, and therefore classified as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List but is a vulnerable species in some states of Australia. The common sandpiper is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

==Relationship to humans==
In the Nukumanu language of the Nukumanu Islands (Papua New Guinea), this species is usually called tiritavoi. Another Nukumanu name for it, matakakoni, exists, but this is considered somewhat taboo and not used when children and women are around. The reason for this is that &quot;matakakoni&quot; means &quot;bird that walks a little, then copulates&quot;, in reference to the pumping tail and thrusting head movements the &quot;Actitis&quot; species characteristically perform during foraging.

<text>Cambaroides japonicus, also known as , is a species of crayfish endemic to Japan.

They are small in size (6 cm) and grayish in color. Its front claws are much weaker than the American crayfish, which is an invasive species in Japan. The Japanese crayfish needs low temperature and high water purity, so they live in upper streams of rivers or lakes in highland regions. These crayfish often burrow alongside the riverbank when breeding and hibernating. Studies have shown that &quot;Cambaroides japonicus&quot; preferentially select artificial burrows based on their relative size, leading to the conclusion that burrow patterns are related to size characteristics of the organism. The distribution of Japanese crayfish comprises Hokkaidō and northern Tōhoku (the northern area of Honshū).

The Environmental Agency (now Ministry of Environment) of Japan added it as a vulnerable species (IUCN category) to the Red Data List in 2000. It is thought that the causes of its decrease are corruption of water quality and the spread of the American crayfish &quot;Pacifastacus leniusculus&quot;, which was imported in the 20th century and has steadily proliferated in northern Japan. Some suspect that this American crayfish carries some disease, such as the crayfish plague known in Europe, that eliminates endemic crayfish.

<text>&quot;The Tattler&quot; is the student newspaper of Ithaca High School in Ithaca, New York. Founded in 1892, it is one of the oldest student newspapers in the United States. It is published twelve times a year and has a circulation of about 3,000, with distribution in both the school and in the community.

The &quot;Tattler&quot; has twice (in 2005 and 2007) won the Ithaca High School Class/Ithaca Public Education Initiative &quot;Support Our School Community Award,&quot; an award given to the extracurricular activity &quot;which has had the most positive impact on IHS&quot;.

==2005 controversy==
In 2004 and early 2005 &quot;The Tattler&quot; published a number of controversial articles, most notably several articles critical of the Ithaca High School administration and a restaurant review that some considered racist. In response, in January 2005 the Ithaca City School District issued a set of guidelines, declaring &quot;The Tattler&quot; a school-sponsored publication and giving its faculty adviser considerably greater power to edit or remove objectionable material.

A cartoon intended for the February 2005 issue included stick-figure depictions of sexual positions was removed by &quot;The Tattler&#x27;s&quot; faculty advisor, Stephanie Vinch. The student editors refused to allow a &quot;censored&quot; version of the issue to be published, and appealed the decision to IHS principal Joe Wilson and ICSD superintendent Judith Pastel. Both Wilson and Pastel ultimately rejected the appeals, also finding the cartoon lewd and inappropriate for the student newspaper. Vinch soon resigned her position as faculty advisor, halting publication of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Tattler&quot;. Principal Wilson closed &quot;The&quot; &quot;Tattler&quot; office in the school.Publication of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Tattler&quot; went underground, running out of editor-in-chief Rob Ochshorn&#x27;s house. The student staff produced a complete underground March issue, which the high school administration denied permission to distribute on school grounds because it contained the same cartoon that was earlier deemed obscene. The editors also created underground issues for April and May, which did not contain the controversial cartoon, which the school allowed them to distribute on school grounds.

IHS mathematics and computer science teacher Roselyn Teukolsky was named interim faculty advisor for &quot;The&quot; &quot;Tattler&quot; and the student staff produced the June 2005 issue back on school grounds.

Later that month, the student editors sued the Ithaca City School District, Superintendent Pastel, Principal Wilson, and Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction Bill Russell, alleging they violated the student editors’ First Amendment press rights by censoring the February issue cartoon, prohibiting campus distribution of the underground March issue, and imposing guidelines that required pre-publication approval by the faculty adviser. On March 23, 2009, the federal trial court ruled that the district could prohibit publication and campus distribution of the cartoon, but denied summary judgment regarding the guidelines, ruling that the issue would require a trial.

The students appealed the district court&#x27;s decision. In &quot;R.O. v. Ithaca City School District&quot;, 645 F.3d 533, 269 Ed. Law Rep. 464 (2nd Cir. 2011), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the school district&#x27;s censorship of the cartoon and held that the editorial guidelines did not violate the First Amendment, relying on Supreme Court decisions in &quot;Bethel School District Number 403 v. Fraser&quot;, 478 U.S. 675, 683, 106 S.Ct. 3159, 92 L.Ed.2d 549 (1986) (First Amendment does not prevent school district from disciplining high school student for giving lewd speech at school assembly) and &quot;Hazelwood School District vs. Kuhlmeier,&quot; 484 U.S. 260, 108 S.Ct. 562, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988) (schools may exercise editorial control over student speech in school-sponsored activities if &quot;reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns&quot;).

The Supreme Court denied review.

The school district revised the editorial guidelines in 2009 to mimic the language in &quot;Fraser&quot; and &quot;Hazelwood&quot; and the plaintiffs tried again to invalidate the new guidelines. In 2014, the federal district court dismissed the case as moot. &quot;R.O v. Ithaca City Sch. Dist.&quot;, 5:05-CV-695 (NAM/ATB) (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2014).

<doc id="315315" wikidata="Q3913249" url="?curid=315315" title="Stonecutters Island">
<text>Stonecutters Island or Ngong Shuen Chau is a former island in Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong. Following land reclamation, it is now attached to the Kowloon Peninsula.

==Fauna==
The island once boasted at least three mating pairs of sulphur-crested cockatoos as well as many snakes; banded kraits, brown cobras and bamboo snakes were all common denizens as late as the 1980s. Black kites often hovered overhead, looking for prey and carrion amongst the many tamarind, &quot;ficus benjamina&quot; and banyan trees.

==History==
===Under British rule===
The island was ceded by the Qing dynasty to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland along with Kowloon in 1860 through the Convention of Peking. It was initially used for quarrying by the British, hence the English name for the island. In the 1850s it was the site of a prison.

A Royal Navy Radio Interception and Direction-finding Station was established on the island in 1935. From 1935 to 1939, the base was the main radio interception unit for the Far East Combined Bureau, which was four miles (6.4 kilometres) away across the harbour in the naval dockyard.

After World War II the island became host to British Army units including 415 Maritime Unit RCT and the Ammunition Sub-Depot RAOC. Explosive storage became more important following the 1967 riots and the Mines Division elected to have all commercial explosives stored on Stonecutters prior to being issued to the various blasting sites around the colony. British Royal Army Ordnance Corps soldiers oversaw all commercial explosive issues post-1968 until 1994, at which time the Royal Navy took over care and custody of the military explosives at the site. Civilian explosive storage and issues was controlled by civilian contractors. The Royal Navy retained care and custody until the colony was transferred to China in 1997. Before then, it was the training and HQ depot of the Hong Kong Military Service Corps.

The island was policed by Indian Sikhs, because traditionally they neither smoke nor drink alcohol. The Army Department Police (ADP), as they were known, saw continuous service on the island during the British era. They enjoyed field hockey, and were often seen playing bare-footed on the field. During the early 1980s, the ADP boasted two Indian national hockey players. It was common to see their blue pagris (turbans) drying in the sun outside their barracks.

The Royal Navy continued to provide a ferry service (known as T-Boats) connecting the islanders with HMS &quot;Tamar&quot; on Hong Kong and the Star Ferry terminal in Kowloon. Additional boats were provided by 415 Maritime Unit RCT and crewed by Local Employed Personnel (LEPs).

During the 1960s, 70s and 80s, the island was used as a &#x27;Rest and Recuperation&#x27; resort, having several chalet style bungalows built around the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes shop, restaurant and swimming pool complex on the South Shore. There was also a commercial interest on the island; Jardine Matheson along with DuPont erected an explosives factory to cater to the ever-growing need for commercial blasting explosives. The factory manufactured several tonnes of water gel and other commercial explosives per week. Limited stocks of Chinese, British and other commercial explosives were stored in the island&#x27;s Victorian explosive storage tunnels.

During the 1970s and 80s, the island was also the forward operating base (FOB) of a Royal Navy Hovercraft unit deployed to assist the Hong Kong government with anti-illegal immigration operations. The Royal Navy unit (Naval Party 1009) was under the control of Cmdr Chris Stafford and two SRN6 Mk6 Hovercraft were continually operated until 1985 when the unit was finally disbanded.

Some buildings or military facilities within the Ngong Shuen Chau Barracks are now graded historic buildings.

===During World War II===
Stonecutters Island was captured by the Japanese Imperial Army on 11December 1941, following heavy shelling. Merchant ships in the island&#x27;s docks were scuttled, and demolitions were carried out at Kowloon Naval Yard and on the island. During World War II, radio installations on the island were used by the Japanese for military purposes and for extending the range of transmission of the NHK Overseas Broadcasting Bureau.

The Japanese (during the WW2 occupation) used the unique isolation of the island to house a snake farm. The snakes were milked of their venom to provide antidotes for their soldiers bitten on active duty in the Pacific theatre.

===After 1997===
Following the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 1July 1997, the naval base is now operated by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy.

==Infrastructure on the island==
The island was connected to the Kowloon peninsula by the West Kowloon Reclamation in the 1990s to provide land for the construction of the road and railway network to the new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok, and for the Container Terminal 8 of Kwai Tsing Container Terminals.

Stonecutters Island is the site of a large sewage treatment facility known as Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works. Since the facility was built in 2001, it has reduced the amount of E. coli in the nearby water by 99 percent, while other pollutants have been reduced by 70-80 percent, allowing coral to return to Victoria Harbour and make Hong Kong&#x27;s beaches safe for swimming again.

Stonecutters Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge linking the Kowloon peninsula with Tsing Yi Island over Rambler Channel to form part of Route 8, opened on 20 December 2009.

<doc id="315320" wikidata="Q330946" url="?curid=315320" title="Blade">
<text>A blade is the sharp, cutting portion of a tool, weapon, or machine, specifically designed to puncture, chop, slice, or scrape surfaces or materials. Blades are typically made from materials that are harder than those they are intended to cut. This includes early examples made from flaked stones like flint or obsidian, evolving through the ages into metal forms like copper, bronze, and iron, and culminating in modern versions made from steel or ceramics. Serving as one of humanity&#x27;s oldest tools, blades continue to have wide-ranging applications, including in combat, cooking, and various other everyday and specialized tasks.

Blades function by concentrating force at the cutting edge. Design variations, such as serrated edges found on bread knives and saws, serve to enhance this force concentration, adapting blades for specific functions and materials. Blades thus hold a significant place both historically and in contemporary society, reflecting an evolution in material technology and utility.

==Uses==
During food preparation, knives are mainly used for slicing, chopping, and piercing.

In combat, a blade may be used to slash or puncture, and may also be thrown or otherwise propelled. The function is to sever a nerve, muscle or tendon fibers, or blood vessel to disable or kill the adversary. Severing a major blood vessel typically leads to death due to exsanguination.

Blades may be used to scrape, moving the blade &quot;sideways&quot; across a surface, as in an ink eraser, rather than along or through a surface. For construction equipment such as a grader, the ground-working implement is also referred to as the blade, typically with a replaceable cutting edge.

==Physics==
A simple blade intended for cutting has two faces that meet at an edge. Ideally, this edge would have no roundness but in practice, all edges can be seen to be rounded to some degree under magnification either optically or with an electron microscope. Force is applied to the blade, either from the handle or pressing on the back of the blade. The handle or back of the blade has a large area compared to the fine edge. This concentration of applied force onto the small edge area increases the pressure exerted by the edge. It is this high pressure that allows a blade to cut through a material by breaking the bonds between the molecules, crystals, fibers, etc. in the material. This necessitates the blade being strong enough to resist breaking before the other material gives way.

===Geometry===
The angle at which the faces meet is important as a larger angle will make for a duller blade while making the edge stronger. A stronger edge is less likely to dull from fracture or have the edge roll out of shape.

The shape of the blade is also important. A thicker blade will be heavier and stronger and stiffer than a thinner one of similar design while also making it experience more drag while slicing or piercing. A filleting knife will be thin enough to be very flexible while a carving knife will be thicker and stiffer; a dagger will be thin so it can pierce, while a camping knife will be thicker so it can be stronger and more durable. A strongly curved edge, like a talwar, will allow the user to draw the edge of the blade against an opponent even while close to the opponent where a straight sword would be more difficult to pull in the same fashion. The curved edge of an axe means that only a small length of the edge will initially strike the tree, concentrating force as does a thinner edge, whereas a straight edge could potentially land with the full length of its edge against a flat section of the tree. A splitting maul has a convex section to avoid getting stuck in the wood where chopping axes can be flat or even concave. A khopesh, falchion, or kukri is angled and/or weighted at the distal end so that force is concentrated at the faster moving, heavier part of the blade maximizing cutting power and making it largely unsuitable for thrusting, whereas a rapier is thin and tapered allowing it to pierce and be moved with more agility while reducing its chopping power compared to a similarly sized sword.

A serrated edge, such as on a saw or a bread knife, concentrates force onto the tips of the serrations which increases pressure as well as allowing soft or fibrous material (like wood, rope, bread, and vegetables) to expand into the spaces between serrations. Whereas pushing any knife, even a bread knife, down onto a bread loaf will just squash the loaf as bread has a low elastic modulus (is soft) but high yield strain (loosely, can be stretched or squashed by a large proportion without breaking), drawing serrations across the loaf with little downward force will allow each serration to simultaneously cut the bread with much less deformation of the loaf. Similarly, pushing on a rope tends to squash the rope while drawing serrations across it sheers the rope fibers. Drawing a smooth blade is less effective as the blade is parallel to the direction draw but the serrations of a serrated blade are at an angle to the fibers. Serrations on knives are often symmetric allowing the blade to cut on both the forward and reverse strokes of a cut, a notable exception being Veff serrations which are designed to maximize cutting power while moving the blade away from the user. Saw blade serrations, for both wood and metal, are typically asymmetrical so that they cut while moving in only one direction. (Saws act by abrading a material into dust along a narrow channel, the kerf, whereas knives and similar act by forcing the material apart. This means that saws result in a loss of material and the serrations of a saw also serve to carry metal swarf and sawdust out of the cut channel.)

Fullers are longitudinal channels either forged into the blade or later machined/milled out of the blade though the latter process is less desirable. This loss of material necessarily weakens the blade but serves to make the blade lighter without sacrificing stiffness. The same principle is applied in the manufacture of beams such as I-beams. Fullers are only of significant utility in swords. In most knives there is so little material removed by the fuller that it makes little difference to the weight of the blade and they are largely cosmetic.

===Materials===
Typically blades are made from a material that is about as hard, though usually harder, than the material to be cut. Insufficiently hard blades will be unable to cut a material or will wear away quickly as hardness is related to a material&#x27;s ability to resist abrasion. However, blades must also be tough enough to resist the dynamic load of impact and as a general rule the harder a blade the less tough (the more brittle) a material. For example, a steel axehead is much harder than the wood it is intended to cut and is sufficiently tough to resist the impact resulting when swung against a tree while a ceramic kitchen knife, harder than steel, is very brittle (has low toughness) and can easily shatter if dropped onto the floor or twisted while inside the food it is cutting or carelessly stored under other kitchen utensils. This creates a tension between the intended use of the blade, the material it is to be made from, and any manufacturing processes (such as heat treatment in the case of steel blades that will affect a blade&#x27;s hardness and toughness). A balance must be found between the sharpness and how well it can last. Methods that can circumvent this include differential hardening. This method yields an edge that can hold its sharpness as well as a body that is tough.

====Non-metals====

Prehistorically, and in less technologically advanced cultures even into modern times, tool and weapon blades have been made from wood, bone, and stone. Most woods are exceptionally poor at holding edges and bone and stone suffer from brittleness making them suffer from fracture when striking or struck. In modern times stone, in the form of obsidian, is used in some medical scalpels as it is capable of being formed into an exceedingly fine edge. Ceramic knives are non-metallic and non-magnetic. As non-metals do not corrode they remain rust and corrosion free but they suffer from similar faults as stone and bone, being rather brittle and almost entirely inflexible. They are harder than metal knives and so more difficult to sharpen, and some ceramic knives may be as hard or harder than some sharpening stones. For example, synthetic sapphire is harder than natural sharpening stones and is as hard as alumina sharpening stones. Zirconium dioxide is also harder than garnet sharpening stones and is nearly as hard as alumina. Both require diamond stones or silicon carbide stones to sharpen and care has to be taken to avoid chipping the blade. As such ceramic knives are seldom used outside of a kitchen and they are still quite uncommon. Plastic knives are difficult to make sharp and poorly retain an edge. They are largely used as low cost, disposable utensils or as children&#x27;s utensils or in environments such as air travel where metal blades are prohibited. They are often serrated to compensate for their general lack of sharpness but, as evidenced by the fact they can cut food, they are still capable of inflicting injury. Plastic blades of designs other than disposable cutlery are prohibited or restricted in some jurisdictions as they are undetectable by metal detectors.

====Metals====

Native copper was used to make blades by ancient civilizations due to its availability. Copper&#x27;s comparative softness causes it to deform easily; it does not hold an edge well and is poorly suited for working stone. Bronze is superior in this regard, and was taken up by later civilizations. Both bronze and copper can be work hardened by hitting the metal with a hammer. With technological advancement in smelting, iron came to be used in the manufacturing of blades. Steel, a range of alloys made from iron, has become the metal of choice for the modern age.

Various alloys of steel can be made which offer a wide range of physical and chemical properties desirable for blades. For example, surgical scalpels are often made of stainless steel so that they remain free of rust and largely chemically inert; tool steels are hard and impact resistant (and often expensive as retaining toughness and hardness requires expensive alloying materials, and, being hard, they are difficult to make into their finished shape) and some are designed to resist changes to their physical properties at high temperatures. Steels can be further heat treated to optimize their toughness, which is important for impact blades, or their hardness, which allows them to retain an edge well with use (although harder metals require more effort to sharpen).

====Combined materials and heat-treatments====
It is possible to combine different materials, or different heat treatments, to produce desirable qualities in a blade. For example, the finest Japanese swords were routinely made of up to seven sections of metals and even poorer quality swords were often made of two. These would include soft irons that could absorb the energy of impact without fracturing but which would bend and poorly retain an edge, and hard steels more liable to shatter on impact but which retained an edge well. The combination provided a sword that would resist impact while remaining sharp, even though the edge could chip if abused. Pattern welding involved forging together twisted bars of soft (bendable) low carbon and hard (brittle) higher carbon iron. This was done because furnaces of the time were typically able to produce only one grade or the other, and neither was well suited for more than a very limited use blade. The ability of modern steelmakers to produce very high-quality steels of various compositions has largely relegated this technique to either historical recreations or to artistic works. Acid etching and polishing blades made of different grades of steel can be used to produce decorative or artistic effects.

Japanese sword makers developed the technique of differential hardening by covering their sword blades in different thicknesses of clay before quenching. Thinner clay allowed the heated metal to cool faster, particularly along the edge. Faster cooling resulted in a finer crystal structure, resulting in a blade with a hard edge but a more flexible body. European sword makers produced similar results using differential tempering.

===Dulling===
Blades dull with use and abuse. This is particularly true of acute blades and those made of soft materials. Dulling usually occurs due to contact between the blade and a hard substance such as ceramic, stone, bone, glass, or metal.

The more acute the blade, the more easily it will dull. As the blade near the edge is thinner, there is little material to remove before the edge is worn away to a thicker section. Thin edges can also roll over when force is applied it them, forming a section like the bottom part of a letter &quot;J&quot;. For this reason, straight edge razors are frequently stropped to straighten the edge.

Drawing a blade across any material tends to abrade both the blade, usually making it duller, and the cut material. Though softer than glass or many types of stone used in the kitchen, steel edges can still scratch these surfaces. The resulting scratch is full of very fine particles of ground glass or stone which will very quickly abrade the blade&#x27;s edge and so dull it.

In times when swords were regularly used in warfare, they required frequent sharpening because of dulling from contact with rigid armor, mail, metal rimmed shields, or other swords, for example. Particularly, hitting the edge of another sword by accident or in an emergency could chip away metal and even cause cracks through the blade. Soft-cored blades are more resistant to fracturing on impact.

===Nail pulls===
Folding pocket knives often have a groove cut in the side of the blade near the spine. This is called a nail pull and allows the fingernail to be inserted to swing the blade out of the holder.
==Knife patterns==

Some of the most common shapes are listed below.

;S1: A &quot;straight back&quot; blade, also called &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;normal&quot;, has a curving edge and a straight back. A dull back lets the wielder use fingers to concentrate force; it also makes the knife heavy and strong for its size. The curve concentrates force on a smaller area, making cutting easier. This knife can chop as well as pick and slice. This is also the best single-edged blade shape for thrusting, as the edge cuts a swath that the entire width of the knife can pass through without the spine having to push aside any material on its path, as a sheepsfoot or drop-point knife would.

;S2: A &quot;trailing-point&quot; knife has a back edge that curves upward to end above the spine. This lets a lightweight knife have a larger curve on its edge and indeed the whole of the knife may be curved. Such a knife is optimized for slicing or slashing. Trailing point blades provide a larger cutting area, or belly, and are common on skinning knives.

;S3: A &quot;drop point&quot; blade has a convex curve of the back towards the point. It handles much like the &quot;clip-point&quot;, though with a stronger point typically less suitable for piercing. Swiss army pocket knives often have drop-points on their larger blades.

;S4: A &quot;clip-point&quot; blade is like a normal blade with the back &quot;clipped&quot;. This clip can be either straight or concave. The back edge of the clip may have a false edge that could be sharpened to make a second edge. The sharp tip is useful as a pick, or for cutting in tight places. If the false edge is sharpened it increases the knife&#x27;s effectiveness in piercing. As well, having the tip closer to the center of the blade allows greater control in piercing. The Bowie knife has a clip point blade and clip-points are common on pocket knives and other folding knives.

;S5: A &quot;&quot; blade has a straight edge and a straight dull back that curves towards the edge at the end. It gives the most control because the dull back edge is made to be held by fingers. Sheepsfoot blades were originally made to trim the hooves of sheep; their shape bears no similarity to the foot of a sheep.

;S6: A &quot;Wharncliffe&quot; blade is similar in profile to a sheep&#x27;s foot but the curve of the back edge starts closer to the handle and is more gradual. Its blade is much thicker than a knife of comparable size. Wharncliffes were used by sailors, as the shape of the tip prevented accidental penetration of the work or the user&#x27;s hand with the sudden motion of a ship.

;S7: A &quot;spey point&quot; blade (once used for neutering livestock) has a single, sharp, straight edge that curves strongly upwards at the end to meet a short, dull, straight point from the dull back. With the curved end of the blade being closer to perpendicular to the blade&#x27;s axis than other knives and lacking a point, making penetration unlikely, spey blades are common on Trapper style pocketknives for skinning fur-bearing animals.

;C1: &quot;Leaf blade&quot; with a distinctive recurved &quot;waist&quot; adding some curved &quot;belly&quot; to the knife facilitating slicing as well as shifting weight towards the tip meaning that it is commonly used for throwing knives as well as improving chopping ability.

;C2: A &quot;spear point&quot; blade is a symmetrically-shaped blade with a point aligned with the centerline of the blade&#x27;s long axis. True spear-point blades are double-edged with a central spine, like a dagger or spear head. The spear point is one of the stronger blade point designs in terms of penetration stress, and is found on many thrusting knives such as the dagger. The term spear point is occasionally and confusingly used to describe small single-edged blades without a central spine, such as that of the &quot;pen knife&quot;, a small folding-blade pocket knife formerly used in sharpening quills for writing. Pen-knife may also nowadays refer to a knifelike weapon blade pattern of some of larger pocket knife blades that would otherwise be termed drop-point designs.

;C3: A &quot;needle point&quot; blade has a sharply-tapered acuminated point. It is frequently found on daggers such as the stiletto (which had no sharpened edges) and the Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife. Its long, narrow point reduces friction and increases the blade&#x27;s penetrative capabilities, but is liable to stick in bone and can break if abused. When the needle point is combined with a reinforced &#x27;T&#x27; section running the length of the blade&#x27;s spine, it is called a &quot;reinforced tip&quot;. One example of a knife with a reinforced tip is the &quot;pesh-kabz&quot;.

;C4: Kris or flame-bladed sword. These blades have a distinct recurved blade form and are sharpened on both sides, typically tapering to (or approximating) a symmetrical point.

;C5: Referred to in English speaking countries as a &quot;tanto&quot; or &quot;tanto a corruption of the Japanese word &quot;tantō&quot;, despite the tip bearing no resemblance to a or as a &quot;chisel point&quot;, referring to the straightness of the edge that comprises the end of the blade (and not to be confused with a blade said to have a &quot;chisel grind&quot;, which would refer to a blade ground on only one side, even though chisels can be ground on one or both sides). It is similar to, but not the same as, some early Japanese swords that had &quot;kamasu kissaki&quot; (&quot;barracuda tip&quot;), a &quot;nearly&quot; straight edge at the tip whereas the typical &quot;tanto point&quot; as found in the west has a straight edge. The barracuda tip sword was sharp but also fragile whereas modern tanto points are often advertised as being stronger at the tip for having nearly the whole thickness of the blade present until quite close to the end of the knife. The geometry of the angle under the point gives tanto blades excellent penetration capabilities. For this reason, tanto blades are often found on knives designed for combat or fighting applications, where the user may need to pierce heavy clothing or low-level soft body armor. With a &quot;modified tanto&quot;, the end is clipped and often sharpened. This brings the tip closer to the center of the blade increasing control of the blade and improves penetration potential by having a finer point and a sharpened back edge.

;C6: A &quot;hawkbill&quot; blade is sharpened on the inside edge and is similar to carpet and linoleum knives. The point will tear even if the rest of the knife is comparatively dull. The karambit from Far South-East Asia is a hawkbill knife which is held with the blade extending from the bottom of the fist and the tip facing forward. The outside edge of a karambit may be sharp and if so may also feature a backward-facing point.

;C7: An &quot;ulu&quot; (lit. &#x27;woman&#x27;s knife&#x27; in Inuktitut) knife is a sharpened segment of a circle. This blade type has no point, and has a handle in the middle. It is good for scraping and sometimes chopping. The semi-circular version appears elsewhere in the world and is called a &quot;head knife&quot;. It is used in leatherworking both to scrape down leather (reducing thickness, i.e. skiving), and to make precise, rolling cuts for shapes other than straight lines. The circular version is a popular tool for slicing pizzas. One corner is placed at the edge of the pizza and the blade is rolled across in a diameter cut.

==Sword patterns==

The sharp edges of a sword may be either curved or straight. Curved blades tend to glide more easily through soft materials, making these weapons more ideal for slicing. Techniques for such weapons feature drawing the blade across the opponent&#x27;s body and back. For straight-edged weapons, many recorded techniques feature cleaving cuts, which deliver the power out to a point, striking directly in at the target&#x27;s body, done to split flesh and bone rather than slice it. That being said, there also exist many historical slicing techniques for straight-edged weapons. Hacking cuts can be followed by a drawing action to maximize the cut&#x27;s effectiveness. For more information see Western Martial Arts or kenjutsu.

Some weapons are made with only a single leading edge, such as the sabre or dusack. The dusack has a &#x27;false edge&#x27; near the tip, which only extends down a portion of the blade&#x27;s backside. Other weapons have a blade that is entirely dull except for a sharpened point, like the épée or foil, which prefer thrusts over cuts. A blade cannot perform a proper cut without an edge, and so in competitive fencing such attacks reward no points.

Some variations include:
* The flame blade (an undulated blade, for both psychological effect and some tactical advantage of using a non-standard blade: vibrations and easier parry)
* The colichemarde, found in smallsword

==Marks and decoration==

Blades are sometimes marked or inscribed, for decorative purposes, or with the mark of either the maker or the owner. Blade decorations are often realized in inlay in some precious metal (gold or silver).

Early blade inscriptions are known from the Bronze Age, a Hittite sword found at Hattusa bears an inscription chiseled into the bronze, stating that the blade was deposited as an offering to the storm-god by king Tuthaliya.

Blade inscriptions become particularly popular in the 12th century knightly sword, based on the earlier, 9th to 11th century, the tradition of the so-called Ulfberht swords.

<text>Liriope is a genus of low, grass-like flowering plants from East and Southeast Asia.

Some species are often used in landscaping in temperate latitudes. It may be called &quot;lilyturf&quot; in North America, although it is neither a true grass (family Poaceae) nor a lily (genus &quot;Lilium&quot;). In the APG III classification system, it is placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae). Like many lilioid monocots, it was once classified with lilies in the family Liliaceae; it has also been placed in the former family Convallariaceae. The genus was named for the nymph Liriope of Greek mythology.

==Background and pronunciation==
&quot;Liriope&quot; are usually used in the garden for their evergreen foliage as a groundcover. Some species, e.g., &quot;L. spicata&quot;, grow aggressively in the right conditions, spreading by runners; hence their nickname, &quot;creeping lilyturf&quot;.

In the southeastern United States &quot;Liriope&quot; is sometimes referred to by the common name monkey grass or spider grass.

The pronunciation of &quot;Liriope&quot; varies. Commonly recommended pronunciation are (US), and (British), but there are many regional variations. In the southern United States, for example, it may be pronounced , , or .

==Cultivation==
&quot;Liriope muscari&quot; is perhaps most widespread in cultivation and is considered appropriate for USDA Hardiness Zones 6-10.

Spikes of tiny violet-blue flowers appear in late summer, and will be more prolific with a dose or two of fertilizer early in the season. A number of variegated varieties are now available to add golden or silver flashes of color to shady situations.
