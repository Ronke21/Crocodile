<text>The embryophytes () are a clade of plants, also known as Embryophyta ([[Plant|Plantae]] sensu strictissimo) () or land plants. They are the most familiar group of photoautotrophs that make up the vegetation on Earth&#x27;s dry lands and wetlands. Embryophytes have a common ancestor with green algae, having emerged within the Phragmoplastophyta clade of freshwater charophyte green algae as a sister taxon of Charophyceae, Coleochaetophyceae and Zygnematophyceae. Embryophytes consist of the bryophytes and the polysporangiophytes. Living embryophytes include hornworts, liverworts, mosses, lycophytes, ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms (flowering plants). Embryophytes have diplobiontic life cycles. 

The embryophytes are informally called &quot;land plants&quot; because they thrive primarily in terrestrial habitats (despite some members having evolved secondarily to live once again in semiaquatic/aquatic habitats), while the related green algae are primarily aquatic. Embryophytes are complex multicellular eukaryotes with specialized reproductive organs. The name derives from their innovative characteristic of nurturing the young embryo sporophyte during the early stages of its multicellular development within the tissues of the parent gametophyte. With very few exceptions, embryophytes obtain biological energy by photosynthesis, using chlorophyll a and b to harvest the light energy in sunlight for carbon fixation from carbon dioxide and water in order to synthesize carbohydrates while releasing oxygen as a byproduct.

==Description==

The Embryophytes emerged either a half-billion years ago, at some time in the interval between the mid-Cambrian and early Ordovician, or almost a billion years ago, during the Tonian or Cryogenian, probably from freshwater charophytes, a clade of multicellular green algae similar to extant Klebsormidiophyceae. The emergence of the Embryophytes depleted atmospheric CO2 (a greenhouse gas), leading to global cooling, and thereby precipitating glaciations. Embryophytes are primarily adapted for life on land, although some are secondarily aquatic. Accordingly, they are often called land plants or terrestrial plants.

On a microscopic level, the cells of charophytes are broadly similar to those of chlorophyte green algae, but differ in that in cell division the daughter nuclei are separated by a phragmoplast. They are eukaryotic, with a cell wall composed of cellulose and plastids surrounded by two membranes. The latter include chloroplasts, which conduct photosynthesis and store food in the form of starch, and are characteristically pigmented with chlorophylls &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, generally giving them a bright green color. Embryophyte cells also generally have an enlarged central vacuole enclosed by a vacuolar membrane or tonoplast, which maintains cell turgor and keeps the plant rigid.

In common with all groups of multicellular algae they have a life cycle which involves alternation of generations. A multicellular haploid generation with a single set of chromosomes – the gametophyte – produces sperm and eggs which fuse and grow into a diploid multicellular generation with twice the number of chromosomes – the sporophyte which produces haploid spores at maturity. The spores divide repeatedly by mitosis and grow into a gametophyte, thus completing the cycle. Embryophytes have two features related to their reproductive cycles which distinguish them from all other plant lineages. Firstly, their gametophytes produce sperm and eggs in multicellular structures (called &#x27;antheridia&#x27; and &#x27;archegonia&#x27;), and fertilization of the ovum takes place within the archegonium rather than in the external environment. Secondly, the initial stage of development of the fertilized egg (the zygote) into a diploid multicellular sporophyte, takes place within the archegonium where it is both protected and provided with nutrition. This second feature is the origin of the term &#x27;embryophyte&#x27; – the fertilized egg develops into a protected embryo, rather than dispersing as a single cell. In the bryophytes the sporophyte remains dependent on the gametophyte, while in all other embryophytes the sporophyte generation is dominant and capable of independent existence.

Embryophytes also differ from algae by having metamers. Metamers are repeated units of development, in which each unit derives from a single cell, but the resulting product tissue or part is largely the same for each cell. The whole organism is thus constructed from similar, repeating parts or &quot;metamers&quot;. Accordingly, these plants are sometimes termed &#x27;metaphytes&#x27; and classified as the group Metaphyta (but Haeckel&#x27;s definition of Metaphyta places some algae in this group). In all land plants a disc-like structure called a phragmoplast forms where the cell will divide, a trait only found in the land plants in the streptophyte lineage, some species within their relatives Coleochaetales, Charales and Zygnematales, as well as within subaerial species of the algae order Trentepohliales, and appears to be essential in the adaptation towards a terrestrial life style.

== Evolution ==
The green algae and land plants form a clade, the Viridiplantae. According to molecular clock estimates, the Viridiplantae split to into two clades: chlorophytes and streptophytes. The chlorophytes, with around 700 genera, were originally marine algae, although some groups have since spread into fresh water. The streptophyte algae (i.e. excluding the land plants) have around 122 genera; they adapted to fresh water very early in their evolutionary history and have not spread back into marine environments.

Some time during the Ordovician, streptophytes invaded the land and began the evolution of the embryophyte land plants. Present day embryophytes form a clade. Becker and Marin speculate that land plants evolved from streptophytes because living in fresh water pools pre-adapted them to tolerate a range of environmental conditions found on land, such as exposure to rain, tolerance of temperature variation, high levels of ultra-violet light, and seasonal dehydration.

The preponderance of molecular evidence as of 2006 suggested that the groups making up the embryophytes are related as shown in the cladogram below (based on Qiu &quot;et al.&quot; 2006 with additional names from Crane &quot;et al.&quot; 2004).

==Diversity==

===Non-vascular land plants ===


The non-vascular land plants, namely the mosses (Bryophyta), hornworts (Anthocerotophyta), and liverworts (Marchantiophyta), are relatively small plants, often confined to environments that are humid or at least seasonally moist. They are limited by their reliance on water needed to disperse their gametes; a few are truly aquatic. Most are tropical, but there are many arctic species. They may locally dominate the ground cover in tundra and Arctic–alpine habitats or the epiphyte flora in rain forest habitats. 

They are usually studied together because of their many similarities. All three groups share a haploid-dominant (gametophyte) life cycle and unbranched sporophytes (the plant&#x27;s diploid generation). These traits appear to be common to all early diverging lineages of non-vascular plants on the land. Their life-cycle is strongly dominated by the haploid gametophyte generation. The sporophyte remains small and dependent on the parent gametophyte for its entire brief life. All other living groups of land plants have a life cycle dominated by the diploid sporophyte generation. It is in the diploid sporophyte that vascular tissue develops. In some ways, the term &quot;non-vascular&quot; is a misnomer. Some mosses and liverworts do produce a special type of vascular tissue composed of complex water-conducting cells. However, this tissue differs from that of &quot;vascular&quot; plants in that these water-conducting cells are not lignified. It is unlikely that water-conducting cells in the mosses is homologous with the vascular tissue in &quot;vascular&quot; plants. 

Like the vascular plants, they have differentiated stems, and although these are most often no more than a few centimeters tall, they provide mechanical support. Most have leaves, although these typically are one cell thick and lack veins. They lack true roots or any deep anchoring structures. Some species grow a filamentous network of horizontal stems, but these have a primary function of mechanical attachment rather than extraction of soil nutrients (Palaeos 2008).

===Rise of vascular plants===

During the Silurian and Devonian periods (around ), plants evolved which possessed true vascular tissue, including cells with walls strengthened by lignin (tracheids). Some extinct early plants appear to be between the grade of organization of bryophytes and that of true vascular plants (eutracheophytes). Genera such as &quot;Horneophyton&quot; have water-conducting tissue more like that of mosses, but a different life-cycle in which the sporophyte is branched and more developed than the gametophyte. Genera such as &quot;Rhynia&quot; have a similar life-cycle but have simple tracheids and so are a kind of vascular plant. It was assumed that the gametophyte dominant phase seen in bryophytes used to be the ancestral condition in terrestrial plants, and that the sporophyte dominant stage in vascular plants was a derived trait. However, the gametophyte and sporophyte stages were probably equally independent from each other, and that the mosses and vascular plants in that case are both derived, and have evolved in opposite directions.

During the Devonian period, vascular plants diversified and spread to many different land environments. In addition to vascular tissues which transport water throughout the body, tracheophytes have an outer layer or cuticle that resists drying out. The sporophyte is the dominant generation, and in modern species develops leaves, stems and roots, while the gametophyte remains very small.


===Lycophytes and euphyllophytes===
All the vascular plants which disperse through spores were once thought to be related (and were often grouped as &#x27;ferns and allies&#x27;). However, recent research suggests that leaves evolved quite separately in two different lineages. The lycophytes or lycopodiophytes – modern clubmosses, spikemosses and quillworts – make up less than 1% of living vascular plants. They have small leaves, often called &#x27;microphylls&#x27; or &#x27;lycophylls&#x27;, which are borne all along the stems in the clubmosses and spikemosses, and which effectively grow from the base, via an intercalary meristem. It is believed that microphylls evolved from outgrowths on stems, such as spines, which later acquired veins (vascular traces).

Although the living lycophytes are all relatively small and inconspicuous plants, more common in the moist tropics than in temperate regions, during the Carboniferous period tree-like lycophytes (such as &quot;Lepidodendron&quot;) formed huge forests that dominated the landscape.

The euphyllophytes, making up more than 99% of living vascular plant species, have large &#x27;true&#x27; leaves (megaphylls), which effectively grow from the sides or the apex, via marginal or apical meristems. One theory is that megaphylls evolved from three-dimensional branching systems by first &quot; – flattening to produce a two dimensional branched structure – and then &#x27;webbing&#x27; – tissue growing out between the flattened branches. Others have questioned whether megaphylls evolved in the same way in different groups.

===Ferns and horsetails===

The ferns and horsetails (the Polypodiophyta) form a clade; they use spores as their main method of dispersal. Traditionally, whisk ferns and horsetails were historically treated as distinct from &#x27;true&#x27; ferns. Living whisk ferns and horsetails do not have the large leaves (megaphylls) which would be expected of euphyllophytes. This has probably resulted from reduction, as evidenced by early fossil horsetails, in which the leaves are broad with branching veins.

Ferns are a large and diverse group, with some 12,000 species. A stereotypical fern has broad, much divided leaves, which grow by unrolling.

===Seed plants===


Seed plants, which first appeared in the fossil record towards the end of the Paleozoic era, reproduce using desiccation-resistant capsules called seeds. Starting from a plant which disperses by spores, highly complex changes are needed to produce seeds. The sporophyte has two kinds of spore-forming organs or sporangia. One kind, the megasporangium, produces only a single large spore, a megaspore. This sporangium is surrounded by sheathing layers or integuments which form the seed coat. Within the seed coat, the megaspore develops into a tiny gametophyte, which in turn produces one or more egg cells. Before fertilization, the sporangium and its contents plus its coat is called an ovule; after fertilization a seed. In parallel to these developments, the other kind of sporangium, the microsporangium, produces microspores. A tiny gametophyte develops inside the wall of a microspore, producing a pollen grain. Pollen grains can be physically transferred between plants by the wind or animals, most commonly insects. Pollen grains can also transfer to an ovule of the same plant, either with the same flower or between two flowers of the same plant (self-fertilization). When a pollen grain reaches an ovule, it enters via a microscopic gap in the coat, the micropyle. The tiny gametophyte inside the pollen grain then produces sperm cells which move to the egg cell and fertilize it. Seed plants include two clades with living members, the gymnosperms and the angiosperms or flowering plants. In gymnosperms, the ovules or seeds are not further enclosed. In angiosperms, they are enclosed within the carpel. Angiosperms typically also have other, secondary structures, such as petals, which together form a flower.

Meiosis in sexual land plants provides a direct mechanism for repairing DNA in reproductive tissues. Sexual reproduction appears to be needed for maintaining long-term genomic integrity and only infrequent combinations of extrinsic and intrinsic factors allow for shifts to asexuality.

<text>Martin H. Peretz (; born December 6, 1938) is an American former magazine publisher and Harvard University assistant professor. In 1974, he purchased &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and he later assumed editorial control of the magazine. In 1996, Peretz founded the financial news website TheStreet.com with CNBC host and hedge fund manager Jim Cramer. 

==Early life and education==
Peretz grew up in New York City. Both of his parents were Zionists, but not religious Jews. He is a descendant of the Polish-Yiddish writer I. L. Peretz.

Peretz graduated from the Bronx High School of Science at age 15. He received his Bachelor of Arts from Brandeis University in 1959, and a Master of Arts and PhD from Harvard University in Government. 

==Career==
After graduating from Harvard, Peretz was hired as a lecturer in the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies at the university.

===New Republic magazine===

In 1974, Peretz purchased &quot;The New Republic&quot; from Gilbert Harrison for $380,000, which his wife supplied.

After purchasing the magazine, Peretz allowed Gilbert A. Harrison, its editor, to continue editing it. Peretz pledged to let him continue running the magazine for at least three years. By 1975, Peretz was agitated by having his own articles rejected for publication, pointing out that he had been pouring more and more money into the magazine to cover its losses, and he fired Harrison. Much of the rest of the staff, including such prominent writers as Walter Pincus, Stanley Karnow, and Doris Grumbach, were fired or quit. They were replaced mainly by recent Harvard graduates lacking journalistic experience. Peretz then named himself the magazine&#x27;s new editor, serving in that post until 1979. 

In the 1980 presidential election, the magazine endorsed the liberal Republican John B. Anderson, running as an independent, rather than the Democratic incumbent, Jimmy Carter. Over time, Peretz purged the magazine of other progressive editors and writers as the magazine underwent a dramatic ideological transformation. As other editors were appointed, Peretz remained editor-in-chief until 2012.

During Peretz&#x27;s stewardship of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, the magazine generally maintained liberal and neoliberal positions on economic and social issues while assuming correspondingly pro-Israel and neoconservative hawkish stances on foreign affairs.

Peretz has said, &quot;Support for Israel is, deep down, an expression of America&#x27;s best view of itself.&quot; Alexander Cockburn and Ken Silverstein have said that Peretz said, &quot;I am in love with the State of Israel.&quot; 

In December 2012, Caroline Glick, a columnist for &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, praised Peretz for his unshakable loyalty to Israel, writing, &quot;As a man of the Left, he has fought the fight for Israel and Jewish rights, increasingly alone for nearly fifty years, and has done so despite what must have been enormous personal costs as his comrades all jumped ship, and in many cases, joined the cause of Israel&#x27;s enemies.&quot;

Media critic Eric Alterman wrote in the &quot;American Prospect&quot; of Peretz&#x27;s tenure as editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot; that Peretz used the magazine to attack, tarnish, and marginalize people and institutions with which he personally or politically disagreed: &quot;[D]uring his reign, Peretz has also done lasting damage to the cause of American liberalism. By turning TNR into a kind of ideological police dog, Peretz enjoyed... [playing] a key role in defining the borders of &#x27;responsible&#x27; liberal discourse, thereby tarring anyone who disagreed as irresponsible or untrustworthy. But he did so on the basis of a politics simultaneously so narrow and idiosyncratic—in thrall almost entirely to an Israel-centric neoconservatism.&quot;

During his tenure as owner of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Peretz repeatedly used the magazine&#x27;s editorial pages to attack and marginalize people he perceived as enemies of Israel, among them even many mainstream Israeli politicians and activists. &quot;Sometimes we attack people unfairly&quot;, Peretz&#x27;s friend and TNR literary editor Leon Wieseltier said. Peretz attacked I. F. Stone after Stone signed a public appeal for the provision of water and medical supplies for siege victims trapped in West Beirut during the 1982 Israeli Siege of Beirut, writing, &quot;So this is what I. F. Stone has come to, asking his admirers to put up money so that the PLO can continue to fight.&quot; In an April 1991 editorial, as the Gulf War commenced, Peretz wrote that he was &quot;the only writer on the Middle East not invited by PBS or NPR to speak about the Gulf.&quot;

In 1997, Peretz fired Michael Kelly as the editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot; after Kelly refused to publish a ghostwritten, unsigned editorial defending Peretz&#x27;s former student and friend Al Gore, who was then vice president and likely to run for president when Bill Clinton&#x27;s term was over. Kelly told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that his &quot;firing-by-phone came days after he refused to publish an unsigned item by Peretz saying that recent allegations of improper fund-raising by Gore were overblown and old news.&quot; Kelly added: &quot;I didn&#x27;t think that should be our editorial position. I wrote him a memo saying, &#x27;Here&#x27;s why I think you&#x27;re wrong and I&#x27;m right.&#x27;&quot; In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Kelly said: &quot;As long as Marty Peretz has the involvement with Al Gore and with the magazine to the degree that he does, I think the job is structurally impossible.&quot;

Peretz has long supported both Democrats and Republicans. As he aged, his support moved from progressives and liberal candidates to neoliberals and conservatives. He was a major behind-the-scenes benefactor of Eugene McCarthy&#x27;s primary presidential bid in 1968. He supported Senator Barack Obama in both his Democratic primary race and in the 2008 general election, but in 2012 wrote that he hoped that &quot;maybe Barack Obama will be a one-term president&quot; and that a prominent alternative candidate would run against him in the Democratic primary. 

Peretz later expressed disappointment with Obama, telling &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure I feel betrayed, but it&#x27;s close... our first African-American president has done less to fight AIDS in Africa than George Bush. He&#x27;s done nothing on human rights.&quot;

Peretz is further known for his support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He retained majority ownership of &quot;The New Republic&quot; until 2002, when he sold a two-thirds stake in the magazine to two financiers. In 2007, Peretz sold the remainder of his ownership rights to CanWest Global Communications, but remained editor-in-chief. In 2009, Peretz repurchased the magazine with a group of investors led by ex-Lazard executive Laurence Grafstein. 

In late 2010, Peretz gave up his title of editor-in-chief at &quot;The New Republic&quot;, becoming instead editor emeritus, and terminated his blog &quot;The Spine&quot; after other editors and writers at the magazine said they found it offensive and that Peretz would never have had the opportunity to write it if he had not been the magazine&#x27;s owner. He no longer has any association with the magazine.

In December 2014, journalist Robert Parry wrote, &quot;Though &quot;The New Republic&quot; still touts its reputation as &#x27;liberal&#x27;, that label has been essentially a cover for its real agenda: pushing a hawkish foreign policy agenda that included the Reagan administration&#x27;s slaughter of Central Americans in the 1980s, violent U.S. interventions in Iraq, Syria and other Muslim countries for the past two decades, and Israel&#x27;s suppression of Palestinians forever.&quot;

===Accusations of bigotry===
Throughout his career, Peretz has drawn criticism from several of his fellow commentators, particularly Jack Shafer of &quot;Slate&quot;, James Fallows of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, and Eric Alterman of &quot;The Nation&quot; for making bigoted comments, often directed towards Arabs and Muslims. He has written (among other things) that &quot;&#x27;Arab society&#x27; is &#x27;hidebound and backward&#x27; [and] [t]hat the Druze are &#x27;congenitally untrustworthy&#x27;&quot;.

On September 4, 2010, Peretz drew media attention and controversy when he posted an editorial which concluded:
But, frankly, Muslim life is cheap, most notably to Muslims. And among those Muslims led by the Imam Rauf there is hardly one who has raised a fuss about the routine and random bloodshed that defines their brotherhood. So, yes, I wonder whether I need honor these people and pretend that they are worthy of the privileges of the First Amendment which I have in my gut the sense that they will abuse.

In September 2010, Nicholas Kristof, a columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, denounced Peretz&#x27;s comments, asking: &quot;Is it possible to imagine the same kind of casual slur tossed off about blacks or Jews?&quot;

Peretz issued an apology on September 13. In his statement about Muslims and the First Amendment, Peretz said: &quot;I wrote that, but I do not believe that. I do not think that any group or class of persons in the United States should be denied the protections of the First Amendment, not now, not ever.&quot; Peretz also said that his comment that &quot;Muslim life is cheap, most notably to Muslims&quot; was &quot;a statement of fact, not of value&quot; and pointed out that Kristof himself agreed that Muslims have not adequately condemned violence perpetrated by Muslims on fellow Muslims.

Kristof responded by criticizing Peretz for falsely claiming that Kristof agreed with him, and also for continuing to generalize that all Muslims had the attitude of Muslim terrorists toward human life:

On September 17, 2010, Peretz issued yet another apology:

On September 20, 2010, five major Harvard University student organizations, citing Peretz&#x27;s long &quot;history of making terribly racist statements&quot;, urged Harvard not to go ahead with honors planned for Peretz. The organizations—the Harvard Islamic Society, Latinas Unidas, and the Harvard Black Students Association—asserted that Peretz, over more than a decade, had not only made racist comments against Muslims but also regarding African Americans and Mexicans.

Following the controversy, Harvard University canceled Peretz&#x27;s scheduled September 25 speech on the 50th anniversary of Harvard&#x27;s Social Studies Department where Peretz once taught.

&quot;The Atlantic&quot;&#x27;s James Fallows summarized Peretz&#x27;s reputation, concluding that if his legacy were settled that day, despite being &quot;beloved by many students and respected by some magazine colleagues&quot;, he would be considered a bigot. Fallows also wrote: &quot;Martin Peretz has been undeniably shamed. And lastingly shamed.&quot;

Marc Tracy wrote in the Jewish magazine &quot;The Tablet&quot;:

[I]f you will—this is not the first time he has written something racist, and it isn&#x27;t the fifteenth time, either... But the tonnage of these quotations and the consistency of their content demonstrate that Peretz&#x27;s insensitivity and bigotry toward Muslims and Arabs (er, and black people) yank him out of the realm of people you should be reading on the subject.

Jefferson Morley, a Peretz friend who worked at &quot;The New Republic&quot; from 1983 to 1987, told Jack Shafer of &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;I could never reconcile this intellectual strength with his racism and unpleasant attempts to play the bully.&quot;

===Racist statements===
Speaking at a 1994 conference on Black-Jewish relations, Peretz said, &quot;So many people in the black population are afflicted by deficiencies—and I mean cultural deficiencies—which Jews, for example, didn&#x27;t.&quot; He added: &quot;In the ghetto, mothers—a lot of mothers don&#x27;t appreciate the importance of schooling&quot; and &quot;A mother who is on crack is in no position to help her children get through school.&quot; 

===Allegations of gender bias in hiring===
In January 2015, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, after having been purchased by a new owner, Chris Hughes, published a long, detailed report on the magazine&#x27;s history of alleged racism. The article, by journalist Jeet Heer, also alleged that during Peretz&#x27;s tenure as owner of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, women were rarely, if ever, given opportunities to write or edit for the magazine:

One may also ask if a staff dominated by privileged white males might not have benefited from greater diversity, and not just along racial lines. &quot;Marty [Peretz] doesn&#x27;t take women seriously for positions of responsibility,&quot; staff writer Henry Fairlie told &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine in 1985. &quot;He&#x27;s really most comfortable with a room full of Harvard males.&quot; In a 1988 article for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, occasional contributor James Wolcott concurred, noting, &quot;&quot;The New Republic&quot; has a history of shunting women to the sidelines and today injects itself with fresh blood drawn largely from male interns down from Harvard.&quot; When Robert Wright succeeded Michael Kinsley in 1988, he joked he was hired as part of an &#x27;affirmative action program&#x27; since he went to Princeton, not Harvard.&quot;

===Sexual harassment controversy===
On October 24, 2017, Leon Wieseltier, a former literary editor at &quot;The New Republic&quot; (from 1983 until his resignation in 2014), admitted to &quot;offenses against some of my colleagues in the past&quot; after several women accused him of sexual harassment and inappropriate sexual advances.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Several women... said they were humiliated when Mr. Wieseltier sloppily kissed them on the mouth, sometimes in front of other staff members. Others said he discussed his sex life, once describing the breasts of a former girlfriend in detail. Mr. Wieseltier made passes at female staffers, they said, and pressed them for details about their own sexual encounters.

&quot;Mr. Wieseltier often commented on what women wore to the office, the former staff members said, telling them that their dresses were not tight enough. One woman said he left a note on her desk thanking her for the miniskirt she wore to the office that day.&quot;

One woman whom Wieseltier harassed, Sarah Wildman, a former assistant editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, has written that she was fired in retaliation for complaining: &quot;In disclosing this incident to my superiors, the outcome was, in many ways, far worse than the act itself. It&#x27;s not exactly that I was disbelieved; it&#x27;s that in the end, I was dismissed&quot;, she wrote in &quot;Vox&quot;.

Wildman wrote that the sexual harassment she and other women at the magazine faced went hand in hand with gender discrimination at the magazine during Peretz&#x27;s tenure: &quot;The women knew we had a far shallower chance of rising up the masthead than our male counterparts; all of us hoped we&#x27;d be the exception. To do so, we entered into a game in which the rules were rigged against us, sometimes pushing us well past our point of comfort in order to remain in play.&quot;

Peretz later said he knew nothing of the harassment. But Peter Beinart, an editor of the magazine, later said and wrote that when he reported one such incident in particular to Peretz—Wieseltier&#x27;s harassment of Wildman—he was ignored, allowing the harassment to continue.

Peretz responded to Beinart&#x27;s recollection of the two men specifically meeting to discuss the matter by saying: &quot;Peter never, ever, ever reported this to me.&quot; He added: &quot;I don&#x27;t remember Sarah Wildman.&quot;

===Stephen Glass controversy===

During Peretz&#x27;s tenure as editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, the magazine faced one of journalism&#x27;s most infamous fabrication scandals. One of the magazine&#x27;s then-writers, Stephen Glass, was found to have fabricated portions or the entirety of 27 of 41 stories he wrote for the magazine. Stories were found to have included some accurate reporting interwoven with fabricated quotations, scenes, and incidents. In some instances, stories were completely invented and contained no factual content.

The Glass fabrications were &quot;the greatest scandal in the magazine&#x27;s history and marked a decade of waning influence and mounting financial losses&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; later assessed.

==In popular culture==
In the 1993 novel &quot;Blue Hearts&quot;, set in Washington D.C., PBS news anchor Jim Lehrer included Peretz as the &quot;roman à clef&quot; character &quot;Jonathan Perry&quot;. Lehrer wrote of the fictional Perry:He was a lightweight sociology professor of no special talent or accomplishment who owned and edited the magazine &quot;The New World&quot; because his wife was a shoe company heiress who bought it for him. He was a joke in all circles except those that believed money was important...[he] had made himself even more foolish by writing a recent column accusing the producers of...public television and radio, of blacklisting him for his strong pro-Israel views. It was an embarrassing incoherence that only the owner of a publication could have brought to public print.

The incident described in the novel apparently derived from real life. Press critic Jack Shafer noted that Peretz, in a column titled &quot;Blacklisted&quot;, described having &quot;leaned on NPR News Veep Bill Buzenberg for just a little mike (to no avail) and that he told PBS&#x27;s Jim Lehrer he wouldn&#x27;t turn down a date on The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, either.&quot; Lehrer was said to have never offered Peretz an invitation to appear on the show.

Peretz is portrayed in Stephen Glass&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;The Fabulist&quot; and by Ted Kotcheff in the 2003 film &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, based on the Glass controversy.

==Personal life==
Peretz was married briefly in his twenties to Linda Heller, the daughter of prominent citrus growers who lived on Fifth Avenue, and in Miami Beach, Florida. The couple met in Boston. The ceremony took place at the Plaza Hotel. They separated shortly thereafter.

From 1967 to 2009, Peretz was married to Anne Devereux (Labouisse) Farnsworth Peretz, daughter of Henry Richardson Labouisse, Jr. and an heir to the Singer Sewing Machine Company fortune. They helped finance &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine in the 1960s, until it published articles critical of Israel&#x27;s governmental policies, which led Peretz and his wife to withdraw their support. 

In 2009, the couple divorced, with his wife citing multiple infidelities and an &quot;explosive temper&quot; as problems in the marriage.

In his 2023 memoir, Peretz wrote for the first time that he is gay, confirming long-standing rumors.

Peretz is the father of Jesse Peretz, a director, and Evgenia Peretz, a writer. He is a longtime friend, former teacher, and political supporter of former Vice President Al Gore.

==Honors and awards==
Peretz has seven honorary doctorates: the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from Bard College (1982), Coe College (1983), Long Island University (1988), Brandeis University (1989), Hebrew College (1990), Chicago Theological Seminary (1994), and the degree of Doctor of Philosophy honoris causa from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1987).&quot;

In 1993, Harvard inaugurated the Martin Peretz Chair in Yiddish Literature in his honor. The Chair is currently held by Ruth Wisse.

Peretz has been a member of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy&#x27;s Board of Advisors.

<doc id="318782" wikidata="Q735236" url="?curid=318782" title="NRG Park">
<text>NRG Park, formerly Reliant Park and Astrodomain, is a complex in Houston, named after the energy company NRG Energy. It is located on Kirby Drive at the South Loop West Freeway (I-610). This complex of buildings encompasses of land and consists of four venues: NRG Stadium, NRG Center, NRG Arena and the NRG Astrodome.

The complex hosts many sporting events and conventions each year, the largest of which are Houston Texans home games, and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

The complex is served by the Stadium Park / Astrodome station, a light rail station on the Red Line of the METRORail light rail system. It also includes one of the world&#x27;s largest parking lots (holding 26,000 total) and sees nearly 750 events yearly. Until 2005, the lot also served as a parking lot for Six Flags Astroworld, which has since closed. Since 2018, it served as the site of the Astroworld Festival, an annual music festival run by Travis Scott, which became the site of a deadly crowd crush in 2021.

==NRG Stadium==
NRG Stadium, home to the Houston Texans and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, was the home of Super Bowl XXXVIII (held February 1, 2004), where the New England Patriots defeated the Carolina Panthers 32-29 and where the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy took place. The stadium also hosted Super Bowl LI (held February 5, 2017), also won by the Patriots after storming back from down 25 points to the Atlanta Falcons, winning 34–28 in overtime. NRG Stadium hosted WrestleMania XXV on April 5, 2009, with a sellout attendance of 72,774 and a live gate of $6.9 million.

The stadium was the first NFL stadium with a retractable roof and natural grass. The stadium can be configured to utilize a space for general session, catered functions, exhibits, concerts, and much more. In addition, NRG Stadium offers four massive concourse levels for special events. The design of the stadium roof provides a very flexible rigging configuration for major audio and visual presentations. 200 suites complement NRG Stadium.

==NRG Center==
The NRG Center is a convention center located among the sports venues in NRG Park. It opened in 2002 and hosts various events year-round, including portions of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, who maintains its offices on the second floor of the building. It runs over ¼ mile in length.

Offering over of contiguous single-level exhibit space divisible into 11 separate halls, NRG Center contains 61 meeting rooms configurable into over 100 variations, 2 major conference centers, 118 loading bays, over of registration space. NRG Center is equipped with a technological infrastructure capable of providing high-speed internet access, pre-wired fiber optic cabling backbone, on-site production facilities, 120 television monitors, and web-casting abilities. Exclusive services include on-site support from telephone and internet, electrical, food and beverage, rigging, security and event staffing. Each meeting room has its own dedicated sound, lighting and networking capabilities. A marshalling area on-site with over of space for shuttle transportation.

Along with the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, NRG Center hosts some of the largest conventions and trade shows in Houston. Some examples of these events are the Offshore Technology Conference, Nutcracker Market, Houston Auto Show, International Gem &amp; Jewelry Show, Houston Gun Collector&#x27;s and Antique Show, and the Houston Boat, Sport and Travel Show - to name a few.

==NRG Arena==

The NRG Arena, formerly known as the &quot;Astro Arena&quot;, is a sports center. It was completed in 1971 and located adjacent to the Astro Hall (later renamed the Reliant Hall), which was later demolished in May 2002 to make room for more parking. The Arena has been the home of several different events, including the Houston Hotshots, Houston&#x27;s former indoor soccer team and smaller wrestling events such as &quot;WCW Thunder&quot;.

With fixed seating in the main arena for 5,800 and floor space encompassing approximately , Reliant Arena is ideal for general sessions and events for less than 10,000. NRG Arena&#x27;s pavilion also provides 1,700 fixed seats and is surrounded by over of exhibit space divisible into four halls. NRG Arena also includes over of meeting space.

Some of the latest events to come through NRG Arena are the And 1 Mix Tape Tour, Hannah Montana, The Cheetah Girls, and Sesame Street Live.

==NRG Astrodome==
The NRG Astrodome, formerly known as just the Houston Astrodome, is called the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot; by many as it is the first domed structure of its size created without a pillar supporting it in the center. The Astrodome opened for business on April 9, 1965, and was the home of the Houston Astros and Houston Oilers for over 30 years before both teams moved out, the former to Daikin Park and the latter to Nashville, Tennessee (where they eventually became the Tennessee Titans). The Astrodome has been the home of many other special events, including the Republican National Convention, the NBA All-Star Game, and World Wrestling Federation (WWF) WrestleMania X-Seven. The venue has also seen the likes of historic recording artists such as Elvis Presley. Until 2002, NRG Astrodome was also the host of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, the largest of its kind in the world. The last concert in NRG Astrodome was the largest attended event ever in the building, featuring George Strait on March 3, 2002, at the Livestock Show and Rodeo where he sang to 68,266 people.

The Astrodome (and NRG Park in general) gained nationwide attention in September 2005 when it was opened as a massive shelter for refugees fleeing Hurricane Katrina. Each building except for NRG Stadium (which was configured for the Houston Texans) hosted several thousand refugees, and local media dubbed the complex &quot;Reliant City&quot;. This &quot;city&quot; was itself evacuated when Hurricane Rita threatened Texas later that month, but many returned after the scare and moved out shortly before the end of the year.

The Astrodome has been closed to the general public since 2008 because of fire code violations, and was to undergo renovations in October 2018 to become a multi-purpose event center. The floor of the stadium would have been raised and would have created over 1,000+ parking spaces, while the top floor would be used for events. The project was supposed to start in October 2018 and be completed sometime in 2020. Harris County was to spend $105 million in order to complete this massive overhaul. However, the renovations were rescheduled to 2019, and then put on hold, and then all together scrapped.

==MDAnderson Cancer Center Speedway at NRG Park==

The MDAnderson Cancer Center Speedway at NRG Park is a temporary street circuit that is configured throughout NRG Park&#x27;s parking lot. The speedway hosted the Grand Prix of Houston, a Champ Car race held in 2006 and 2007. The pit lane and paddock for the race teams were located in NRG Arena. Due to the merger between Champ Car and the Indy Racing League in 2008, the 2008 Grand Prix of Houston was canceled.

On March 28, 2012, the Verizon IndyCar Series announced that Grand Prix of Houston would return in 2013 to the temporary circuit in NRG Park. The first race since the merger was a doubleheader and the races were won by Scott Dixon and Will Power. The weekend also featured a horrible accident in the second race, Dario Franchitti and Takuma Sato made contact in turn 5 on the last lap making Franchitti airborne hitting the catchfence similar to Kenny Brack&#x27;s incident in 2003 at Texas. The accident injured 13 fans from flying debris. The race returned in June 2014 with safety upgrades for both drivers and fans featuring updated fencing and grandstands were removed from where the 2013 accident happened. Carlos Huertas and Simon Pagenaud won the two Verizon indyCar Series races of the weekend.

The track was sponsored by JAGFlo in 2007.

<doc id="318784" wikidata="Q1931244" url="?curid=318784" title="Underemployment">
<text>Underemployment is the underuse of a worker because their job does not use their skills, offers them too few hours, or leaves the worker idle. It is contrasted with unemployment, where a person lacks a job at all despite wanting one.

Examples of workers who may be considered underemployed include those who hold a part-time job but wish to work more hours, part-time workers who wish to work full-time, and overqualified workers who have education, experience, or skills beyond their role&#x27;s requirements.

Underemployment has been studied from a variety of perspectives, including economics, management, psychology, and sociology.

In economics, underemployment has three different distinct meanings and applications. Policy-makers may under-research these meanings when assessing the economy as they focus on unemployment instead:
# &quot;Overqualification&quot; or &quot;overeducation&quot;, the employment of workers with high education, skill levels, or experience in jobs that do not require such abilities. For example, a trained medical doctor with unrecognized foreign credentials working as a taxi driver.
# &quot;Under hours&quot; or &quot;involuntary part-time&quot; work, for those who wish to work more hours and/or move from part-time to full-time. By extension, the term is also used in regional planning to describe regions where economic activity rates are unusually low due to a lack of job opportunities, training opportunities, or services like childcare and public transportation.
# &quot;Overstaffing&quot;, &quot;hidden unemployment&quot;, or &quot;disguised unemployment&quot; (also called &quot;labor hoarding&quot;), the practice in which businesses or entire economies employ workers who are not fully occupied. For example, workers currently not being used to produce goods or services due to legal or social restrictions or because the work is highly seasonal.

Underemployment is a significant cause of poverty as pay may be insufficient to meet basic needs. It has been associated with OECD wage stagnation. Underemployment is a problem particularly in developing countries, where the unemployment rate is often quite low, as most workers are doing subsistence work or occasional part-time jobs. In 2011, the global average of full-time workers per adult population was only 26%, compared to 30–52% in developed countries and 5–20% in most of Africa.

==Underutilization of skills==
In one usage, underemployment describes the employment of workers with high skill levels and postsecondary education who are working in relatively low-skilled, low-wage jobs. For example, someone with a college degree may be a bartender, or working as a factory assembly line worker. That may result from the existence of unemployment, which makes workers with bills to pay (and responsibilities) take almost any jobs available, even if they do not use their full talents. That can also occur with individuals who are being discriminated against, lack appropriate trade certification or academic degrees (such as a high school or college diploma), have disabilities or mental illnesses, or have served time in prison.

Two common situations that can lead to underemployment are immigrants and new graduates. When highly trained immigrants arrive in a country, their foreign credentials may not be recognized or accepted in their new country, or they may have to do a lengthy or costly re-credentialing process. As a result, when doctors or engineers from other countries immigrate, they may be unable to work in their profession, and they may have to seek menial work. New graduates may also face underemployment because even though they have completed the technical training for a given field for which there is a good job market, they lack experience. Recent graduates with a master&#x27;s degree in accounting or business administration may have to work in a low-paid job as a barista or store clerk, which does not require a university degree, until they are able to find work in their professional field.

Another example of underemployment is someone who holds high skills for which there is low market-place demand. While it is costly in terms of money and time to acquire academic credentials, many types of degrees, particularly those in the liberal arts, produce significantly more graduates than can be properly employed. Employers have responded to the oversupply of graduates by raising the academic requirements of many occupations higher than is really necessary to perform the work. A number of surveys show that skill-based underemployment in North America and Europe can be a long-lasting phenomenon. If university graduates remain in a prolonged state of underemployment, the skills they gained from their degrees can atrophy from disuse or become out of date. For example, a person who graduates with a PhD in English literature has advanced research and writing skills when they graduate, but if they work as a store clerk for a number of years, these skills may atrophy from disuse. Similarly, technically specialized workers may find themselves unable to acquire positions commensurate with their skills for extended lengths of time following layoffs. Skilled machinists who are laid off may find that they cannot find another job as a machinist and so they may work as a server in a restaurant, a job which does not use their professional skills.

As the tertiary education of most students in Western countries is fully or partially subsidized by government monies (because it takes place at a state university or public university or because the student receives government loans or grants), the underemployment of recent college graduates may also be an ineffective use of public resources. Several solutions have been proposed to reduce skill-based underemployment: for example, government-imposed restrictions on public university enrollment in degree fields with a very low labor market demand (e.g. fine arts), or changes in degree cost model that reflect potential labour market demand.

A related kind of underemployment refers to &quot;involuntary part-time&quot; workers, who could (and would like to) be working on a standard work-week (typically full-time employment means 40 hours per week in the United States) schedule but can find only part-time work. Underemployment is more prevalent during times of economic stagnation (during recessions or depressions) and when financial pressures increase. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, many of those who were employed were underemployed. Those kinds of underemployment arise because labor markets typically do not &quot;clear&quot; using wage adjustment. Instead, there is a non-wage rationing of jobs.

==Underuse of economic capacity==
Underemployment can also be used in regional planning to describe localities where economic activity rates are unusually low. This can be induced by a lack of job opportunities, training opportunities, or services such as childcare and public transportation. Such difficulties may lead residents to accept economic inactivity rather than register as unemployed or actively seek jobs because their prospects for regular employment appear so bleak. (These people are often called discouraged workers and are not counted officially as being &quot;unemployed.&quot;) The tendency to get by without work (to exit the labor force, living off relatives, friends, personal savings, or non-recorded economic activities) can be aggravated if it is made difficult to obtain unemployment benefits.

Relatedly, in macroeconomics, &quot;underemployment&quot; simply refers to &quot;excess unemployment&quot;, i.e., high unemployment relative to full employment or the natural rate of unemployment, also called the NAIRU. Thus, in Keynesian economics, reference is made to underemployment equilibrium. Economists calculate the cyclically-adjusted full employment unemployment rate, e.g. 4% or 6% unemployment, which in a given context is regarded as &quot;normal&quot; and acceptable. Sometimes, this rate is equated with the NAIRU. The difference between the observed unemployment rate and cyclically adjusted full employment unemployment rate is one measure of the societal level of underemployment. By Okun&#x27;s Law, it is correlated with the gap between potential output and the actual real GDP. This &quot;GDP gap&quot; and the degree of underemployment of labor would be larger if they incorporated the roles of underemployed labor, involuntary part-time labor, and discouraged workers.

==Underuse of employed workers==

The third definition of &quot;underemployment&quot; describes a polar opposite phenomenon: to some economists, the term refers to &quot;overstaffing&quot; or &quot;hidden unemployment,&quot; the practice of businesses or entire economies employing workers who are not fully occupied (in other words, employees who are not economically productive, or underproductive, or economically inefficient). This may be because of legal or social restrictions on firing and lay-offs (e.g. union rules requiring managers to make a case to fire a worker or spend time and money fighting the union) or because they are &quot;overhead&quot; workers, or because the work is highly seasonal (which is the case in accounting firms focusing on tax preparation, as well as agriculture and the hospitality industry). The presence of this issue in white collar office jobs is described in the boreout phenomenon, which posits that the major issue facing office workers is lack of work and boredom.

This kind of underemployment does &quot;not&quot; refer to the kind of non-work time done by, for instance, firefighters or lifeguards, who spend a lot of their time waiting and watching for emergency or rescue work to do; this kind of activity is necessary in case there are multiple simultaneous incidents.

This kind of underemployment may exist for &quot;structural&quot; or &quot;cyclical&quot; reasons. In many economies, some firms become insulated from fierce competitive pressures and grow inefficient, because they are awarded a government monopoly (e.g., telephone or electrical utilities) or due to a situation of abuse of market power (e.g., holding a monopoly position in a certain industry). As such, if they may employ more workers than necessary, they might not be getting the market signals that would pressure them to reduce their labour force, and they may end up carrying the resultant excess costs and depressed profits.

In some countries, labour laws or practices (e.g. powerful unions) may force employers to retain excess employees. Other countries (e.g. Japan) often have significant cultural influences (the relatively great importance attached to worker solidarity as opposed to shareholder rights) that result in a reluctance to shed labour in times of difficulty. In Japan, there is a long-held tradition that if a worker commits to serve a company with long and loyal service, the company will, in return, keep the worker on the payroll even during economic downturns. In centrally-planned economies, layoffs were often not allowed so that some state-run companies would have periods when they had more workers than they needed to complete the organization&#x27;s tasks.

Cyclical underemployment refers to the tendency for the capacity utilization of firms (and therefore of their demand for labor) to be lower at times of recession or economic depression. At such times, underemployment of workers may be tolerated and indeed may be wise business policy, given the financial cost and the reduction of morale from shedding and then rehiring staff. Alternatively, paying underused overhead workers is seen as an investment in their future contributions to production. This kind of underemployment has been given as a possible reason why Airbus gained market share from Boeing. Unlike Airbus, which had more flexibility, Boeing was unable to ramp up production fast enough when prosperous times returned because it had dismissed a great part of its personnel in lean times.

Another example is the tourism sector, which faces cyclical demand in areas where attractions are weather-related. In some tourism sectors, such as the sun and sand tours operated by Club Med, the company can shed bartenders, lifeguards, sports instructors, and other staff in the off-season because there is such a strong demand for young people to work for the company since its glamorous beachfront properties are desirable places to work. However, not all tourism sectors find it so easy to recruit staff. Some tourism sectors require workers with unusual or hard-to-find skills. Northern Ontario hunting and fishing camps that require skilled guides may have an incentive to retain their staff in the off-season. Another example is companies that run tours for foreign tourists using staff speaking the travelers&#x27; native tongue. In Canada, guided tours are available for Japanese and German tourists in their native languages; in some locations, it may be hard for companies to find Japanese- or German-speaking staff and so companies may retain their staff in the off-season.

<doc id="318794" wikidata="Q315072" url="?curid=318794" title="Georges Bernanos">
<text>Louis Émile Clément Georges Bernanos (; 20 February 1888 – 5 July 1948) was a French author, and a soldier in World War I. A Catholic with monarchist leanings, he was critical of elitist thought and was opposed to what he identified as defeatism. He believed this had led to France&#x27;s defeat and eventual occupation by Germany in 1940 during World War II. His two best-known novels &quot;Sous le soleil de Satan&quot; (1926) and the &quot;Journal d&#x27;un curé de campagne&quot; (1936) both revolve around a parish priest who combats evil and despair in the world. Most of his novels have been translated into English and frequently published in both Great Britain and the United States.

==Life and career==
Bernanos was born in Paris, into a family of craftsmen. He spent much of his childhood in the village of Fressin, Pas-de-Calais region, which became a frequent setting for his novels. He served in the First World War as a soldier, where he fought in the battles of the Somme and Verdun. He was wounded several times.

After the war, he worked in insurance before writing &quot;Sous le soleil de Satan&quot; (1926, &quot;Under the Sun of Satan&quot;). He won the Grand Prix du roman de l&#x27;Académie française for &quot;The Diary of a Country Priest&quot; (&quot;Journal d&#x27;un curé de campagne&quot;), published in 1936.

A man of Royalist leanings and a member of the &quot;Camelots du Roi&quot; (Action Française&#x27;s youth organization) when he was younger, Bernanos broke with Charles Maurras and the Action Française in 1932. He initially supported Franco&#x27;s coup at the outset of the Spanish Civil War. However, after he observed the conflict in Majorca and saw &#x27;a terrorized people,&#x27; he became disgusted with the &quot;nacionales&quot; and criticized them in the book &quot;Diary of My Times&quot; (1938). He wrote, &quot;My illusions regarding the enterprise of General Franco did not last long—two or three weeks—but while they lasted I conscientiously endeavoured to overcome the disgust which some of his men and means caused me.&quot;

With political tensions rising in Europe, Bernanos emigrated to South America with his family in 1938, settling in Brazil. He remained until 1945 in Barbacena, State of Minas Gerais, where he tried his hand at managing a farm. His three sons returned to France to fight after World War II broke out, while he fulminated at his country&#x27;s &#x27;spiritual exhaustion,&#x27; which he saw as the root of its collapse in 1940. From exile, he mocked the &#x27;ridiculous&#x27; Vichy regime and became a strong supporter of the Free French led by Charles De Gaulle. After France&#x27;s Liberation, De Gaulle invited Bernanos to return to his homeland, offering him a post in the government. Bernanos did return but, disappointed to perceive no signs of spiritual renewal, he declined to play an active role in French political life.

==Adaptations of selected works==
* &quot;The Diary of a Country Priest&quot;: this was the first novel by Bernanos to be adapted as a film, called &quot;Diary of a Country Priest&quot; (1951); it was directed by Robert Bresson, and starred Claude Laydu in his debut role.
*&quot;Mouchette&quot; was adapted into a film of the same name by Robert Bresson, released in 1967.
* &quot;Under the Sun of Satan&quot;: his novel was adapted as a film of the same name, produced in 1987 in France. The film won the Palme d&#x27;Or prize at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival.
* &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot;: in 1947, Bernanos had been hired to write the dialogue for a film screenplay, through Raymond-Léopold Bruckberger and the scenario writer Philippe Agostini, based on the novella &quot;The Song at the Scaffold&quot; by the German writer Gertrud von Le Fort, about the 1794 execution of the Carmelite Nuns of Compiègne. The screenplay was judged unsatisfactory at the time. Following Bernanos&#x27; death his literary executor, Albert Béguin, discovered the manuscript. To assist Bernanos&#x27; heirs, Béguin sought to have the work published, requesting permission from Baroness von Le Fort for publication. In January 1949 she agreed, gifting her portion of the royalties over to Bernanos&#x27; widow and children. However, the Baroness requested that Bernanos&#x27; play be given a different title from her novella. Béguin chose &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot;, and the work was published in 1949. It was translated into German, published there in 1951 as &quot;Die begnadete Angst&quot; (&quot;The Blessed Fear&quot;) and first staged in Zürich and Munich that year. The French stage première took place in May 1952 at the Théâtre Hébertot. The composer Francis Poulenc adapted Bernanos&#x27; work into an opera of the same name, which was first performed at La Scala Milan in 1957. A film based on Bernanos&#x27; play and starring Jeanne Moreau was released in 1960.

<doc id="318804" wikidata="Q838588" url="?curid=318804" title="The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius">
<text>The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius, or just The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron and often shortened as Jimmy Neutron, is an American animated television series created by John A. Davis for Nickelodeon. Based on the 2001 film &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;, the series serves as a sequel to the film. It originally aired on Nickelodeon for three seasons from July 20, 2002, to November 25, 2006. The show follows the eponymous character, an 11-year-old genius from the fictitious town of Retroville, Texas, as he goes on adventures with his best friends Carl Wheezer and Sheen Estevez. Throughout the show, various mishaps and conflicts occur on these adventures, as Jimmy&#x27;s various inventions go awry. The series features voices of Debi Derryberry (Jimmy), Rob Paulsen (Carl), and Jeff Garcia (Sheen) for the three main characters. It was the first Nicktoon series to be animated in CGI.

Receiving mostly favorable reviews upon and since its release, the series has been the recipient of various nominations such as the Kids&#x27; Choice Award for Favorite Cartoon in 2006 and 2007, and has also won an Annie Award for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Television Production Produced for Children&quot; in 2004 as well as a Motion Picture Sound Editors &quot;Golden Reel Award&quot;. A spin-off, &quot;Planet Sheen&quot;, aired from 2010 to 2013.

==Premise==

The show follows a scientifically minded boy named Jimmy Neutron from Retroville, Texas who frequently goes on adventures with his two best friends, Carl and Sheen, usually involving his inventions going wrong.

==Episodes==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===&quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; crossover episodes===
There have also been three tie-ins with special episode crossovers involving the Nickelodeon hand-drawn style series &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; under the title &quot;The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour&quot; (the first alone, the second and third with the subtitles &quot;When Nerds Collide!&quot; and &quot;The Jerkinators!,&quot; respectively); the five main characters from Jimmy Neutron meet with the main characters from &quot;The Fairly OddParents,&quot; Timmy, his godparents, and his two best friends Chester, and AJ, and often cross between each of their worlds of 2D and 3D animation.

==Production==
===Development===
Keith Alcorn and John A. Davis created Jimmy (then named Johnny Quasar) sometime during the 1980s and wrote a script titled &quot;Runaway Rocketboy&quot; (later the name of the pilot), which was abandoned. He later stumbled upon the idea while moving into a new house in the early 1990s. Davis re-worked it as a short film titled &quot;Johnny Quasar&quot; and presented it at SIGGRAPH, where he met Steve Oedekerk and worked on a television series of the short as well as the movie. Jimmy was still called Johnny Quasar before it was decided to name him Jimmy Neutron because the name sounded eerily similar to Jonny Quest.
The pilot involves Jimmy Neutron testing a rocket ship that he has invented, and later uses it when he inadvertently stumbles upon a Yolkian plot to conquer Earth. The pilot was aired in short mini-episodes on Nickelodeon before the film&#x27;s release, and its plot was used for the film. It was later included as an extra on the &quot;Confusion Fusion&quot; and &quot;The Complete Series&quot; DVDs. It was originally supposed to air as a short on &quot;KaBlam!&quot;, but the show got canceled before the episode aired. 

The pilot had a few differences from the main series. In it, Jimmy wore a red and white striped shirt and did not wear his signature red atom shirt, Judy&#x27;s hair was darker, Hugh wore a blue suit (instead of a sweater vest and tie) and was a bit smarter, the Yolkians all wore grey suits and King Goobot&#x27;s crown was a different color, the theme song was longer with a few lines that were cut later, Goddard was voiced by Nathan Lane, Carl Wheezer had a very different design, main characters Sheen Estevez, Cindy Vortex, and Libby Folfax were absent and the title card had a picture in the scene.

===Writing===
The show began with Jed Spingarn as story editor and Steven Banks as head writer, though the series featured a variety of freelance writers as well. Midway through the first season, Jed Spingarn was promoted to Co-Producer and started writing fewer episodes, while Gene Grillo took his place as story editor. In seasons 2 and 3 the show featured fewer freelance writers and Banks and Grillo wrote most episodes. In addition, season 1 was more episodic and had mostly 11-minute episodes, while seasons 2 and 3 had serial elements and mostly half-hour episodes.

===Animation===
DNA Productions retooled their pipeline when moving from the film to the TV series, to reuse assets for the episodes. Some of the programming team at the studio programmed a special code that allowed the animators to animate scenes in Maya, which can then be rendered in Lightwave. This helped the team keep up with the deadline and avoid going over budget.

===Possible reboot/revival plans===
In 2016, director John A. Davis has stated that he has a story for a &quot;Jimmy Neutron&quot; reboot feature that he would like to make, but he is waiting for the &quot;right situation&quot; to make it.

When asked about a reboot in 2020, Rob Paulsen stated &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve got to tell you, man. I go all over the world when we don&#x27;t have the coronavirus, and people love Carl. They love Carl. I don&#x27;t think it would be a bad thing at all to reboot Jimmy Neutron. I think that&#x27;s one of those shows that a lot of people would love to see again. It was very good. Really smart. That wouldn&#x27;t surprise me.&quot;

In 2025, screenwriter Adam Pava unveiled that a potential new film project based on the character was in the works since December 2023.

==Theme song==
The theme song was originally written by Brian Causey for the pilot episode. Pop-punk band Bowling for Soup later revamped and extended Causey&#x27;s theme for the film version theme. Ultimately, the original theme was kept for the TV series intro and outro.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
Joly Herman of Common Sense Media gave the series 3 out of 5 stars; saying that, &quot;Jimmy Neutron has all the trappings of a Nickelodeon show: the preteen peer pressure, the gadgets, the spacey parents. But it&#x27;s clever enough and funny enough to have earned a devoted following. The script is generally well written and well executed – the adults behind this show approach the project with apparent zeal. [...] Kids will enjoy this program, while parents might get a kick out of some of the gags as well. And though the computer animation may seem a bit freaky for old-school animation fans, it does allow for quality special effects.&quot;

=== Awards and nominations ===
==Home media==
===DVD releases===

== Spin-off ==

A spin-off series, &quot;Planet Sheen&quot;, aired from 2010 to 2013. The show focuses on Sheen Estevez, who accidentally crash-lands on the planet Zeenu in the pilot episode.

<text>8½ ( ) is a 1963 comedy drama film co-written and directed by Federico Fellini. The metafictional narrative centers on Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), a famous Italian film director who suffers from stifled creativity as he attempts to direct an epic science fiction film. Claudia Cardinale, Anouk Aimée, Sandra Milo, Rossella Falk, Barbara Steele, and Eddra Gale portray the various women in Guido&#x27;s life. The film was shot in black and white by cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo and features a score by Nino Rota, with costume and set designs by Piero Gherardi.

&quot;8½&quot; was critically acclaimed and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Costume Design (black-and-white). It is acknowledged as an avant-garde film and a highly influential classic. It was ranked 10th on the British Film Institute&#x27;s The &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; Greatest Films of All Time 2012 critics&#x27; poll and 4th by directors. It is included in the Vatican&#x27;s compilation of 45 important films made before 1995, the 100th anniversary of cinema. The film ranked 7th in BBC&#x27;s 2018 list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Foreign Language Films&quot; voted by 209 film critics from 43 countries around the world.

It was included on the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage&#x27;s 100 Italian films to be saved, a list of 100 films that &quot;have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978&quot;. It is considered to be one of the greatest and most influential films of all time.

== Plot ==
Guido Anselmi, a famous Italian film director, is suffering from &quot;director&#x27;s block&quot;. Stalled on his new science fiction film that includes thinly veiled autobiographical references, he has lost interest amidst artistic and marital difficulties. While attempting to recover from his anxieties at a luxurious spa, Guido hires a well-known critic to review his ideas for his film, but the critic blasts them. Guido has recurring visions of an Ideal Woman, whom he sees as key to his story. His mistress Carla comes to visit him, but Guido puts her in a separate hotel. The film production crew relocates to Guido&#x27;s hotel in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to work on the film.

Guido admits to a cardinal that he is not happy. The cardinal offers little insight. Guido invites his estranged wife Luisa and her friends to join him. They dance, but Guido abandons her for his production crew. Guido confesses to his wife&#x27;s best friend Rosella that he wanted to make a film that was pure and honest, but he is struggling with something honest to say. Carla surprises Guido, Luisa, and Rosella outside the hotel, and Guido claims that he and Carla ended their affair years earlier. Luisa and Rosella call him on the lie, and Guido slips into a fantasy world where he lords over a harem of women from his life, but a rejected showgirl starts a rebellion. The fantasy women attack Guido with harsh truths about himself and his sex life.

When Luisa sees how bitterly Guido represents her in the film, she declares that their marriage is over. Guido&#x27;s Ideal Woman arrives in the form of an actress named Claudia. Guido explains that his film is about a burned-out man who finds salvation in this Ideal Woman. Claudia concludes that the protagonist is unsympathetic because he is incapable of love. Broken, Guido calls off the film, but the producer and the film&#x27;s staff announce a press conference at which the filming will commence. Guido attempts to escape from the journalists and eventually imagines shooting himself in the head. Guido realizes he was attempting to solve his personal confusion by creating a film to help others, when instead he needs to accept his life for what it is. He asks Luisa for her assistance in doing so. Carla tells him that she figured out what he was trying to say: that Guido cannot do without the people in his life. As the production crew and cast begin to troop onto the set, Guido&#x27;s passion revives and he begins to direct. The men and women of the cast and crew start holding hands and walk briskly around in a circle with Guido and Luisa joining them last. The production set is dismantled, Guido salutes the last of the crew members, and the set fades to black.

== Cast ==
== Themes ==
&quot;8½&quot; is about the struggles involved in the creative process, both technical and personal, and the problems artists face when expected to deliver something personal and profound with intense public scrutiny, on a constricted schedule, while simultaneously having to deal with their own personal relationships. It is, in a larger sense, about the search for meaning within a difficult, fragmented life. Like several Italian films of the period (most evident in the films of Fellini&#x27;s contemporary, Michelangelo Antonioni), &quot;8½&quot; also is about the alienating effects of modernization.

At this point, Fellini had directed six feature films: &quot;Lo sceicco bianco&quot; (1952), &quot;I Vitelloni&quot; (1953), &quot;La Strada&quot; (1954), &quot;Il bidone&quot; (1955), &quot;Le notti di Cabiria&quot; (1957), and &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960). He had co-directed &quot;Luci del varietà&quot; (&quot;Variety Lights&quot;) (1950) with Alberto Lattuada, and had directed two short segments, &quot;Un&#x27;Agenzia Matrimoniale&quot; (&quot;A Marriage Agency&quot;) in the omnibus film &quot;L&#x27;amore in città&quot; (&quot;Love in the City&quot;) (1953) and &quot;Le Tentazioni del Dottor Antonio&quot; from the omnibus film &quot;Boccaccio &#x27;70&quot; (1962). The title is in keeping with Fellini&#x27;s self-reflexive theme: by his count it was his eighth-and-a-half film. The working title for &quot;8½&quot; was &quot;La bella confusione&quot; (&quot;The Beautiful Confusion&quot;) proposed by co-screenwriter, Ennio Flaiano, but Fellini then &quot;had the simpler idea (which proved entirely wrong) to call it &quot;Comedy&quot;&quot;.

According to Italian writer Alberto Arbasino, &quot;8½&quot; used techniques similar to, and has parallels with, Robert Musil&#x27;s novel &quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot; (1930).

The film is unusual in that it is a film about making a film, and the film that is being made is the film that the audience is viewing. An example is the dream sequence of &quot;Guido&#x27;s Harem&quot; where Guido is bathed and carried in white linen by all the women from the film, only to have the women protest for being sent to live upstairs in the house when they turn 30, and &quot;Jacquilene Bonbon&quot; does her last dance. The Guido&#x27;s Harem scene is immediately followed by the &quot;Screen Test&quot; depicting the same actors in a theater, each taking the stage for a screen test, being chosen to act for the very scene the audience just watched. This mirror of mirrors is further emphasized at the end where the director Guido sits at the table of the press conference, where the entire table is a mirror reflecting the director in it.

== Production ==

In an October 1960 letter to his colleague Brunello Rondi, Fellini first outlined his film ideas about a man suffering from a creative block: &quot;Well then—a guy (a writer? any kind of professional man? a theatrical producer?) has to interrupt the usual rhythm of his life for two weeks because of a not-too-serious disease. It&#x27;s a warning bell: something is blocking up his system.&quot; Unclear about the script, its title, and his protagonist&#x27;s profession, he scouted locations throughout Italy &quot;looking for the film&quot; in the hope of resolving his confusion. Flaiano suggested &quot;La bella confusione&quot; (literally &quot;The Beautiful Confusion&quot;) as the film&#x27;s title. Under pressure from his producers, Fellini finally settled on &quot;8½&quot;, a self-referential title referring principally (but not exclusively) to the number of films he had directed up to that time.

Giving the order to start production in spring 1962, Fellini signed deals with his producer Rizzoli, fixed dates, had sets constructed, cast Mastroianni, Anouk Aimée, and Sandra Milo in lead roles, and did screen tests at the Scalera Studios in Rome. He hired cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo, among key personnel. But apart from naming his hero Guido Anselmi, he still could not decide what his character did for a living. The crisis came to a head in April when, sitting in his Cinecittà office, he began a letter to Rizzoli confessing he had &quot;lost his film&quot; and had to abandon the project. Interrupted by the chief machinist requesting he celebrate the launch of &quot;8½&quot;, Fellini put aside the letter and went on the set. Raising a toast to the crew, he &quot;felt overwhelmed by shame... I was in a no exit situation. I was a director who wanted to make a film he no longer remembers. And lo and behold, at that very moment everything fell into place. I got straight to the heart of the film. I would narrate everything that had been happening to me. I would make a film telling the story of a director who no longer knows what film he wanted to make&quot;.

When shooting began on 9 May 1962, Eugene Walter recalled Fellini taking &quot;a little piece of brown paper tape&quot; and sticking it near the viewfinder of the camera. Written on it was &quot;Ricordati che è un film comico&quot; (&quot;Remember that this is a comic film&quot;). Perplexed by the seemingly chaotic, incessant improvisation on the set, Deena Boyer, the director&#x27;s American press officer at the time, asked for a rationale. Fellini told her that he hoped to convey the three levels &quot;on which our minds live: the past, the present, and the conditional - the realm of fantasy&quot;.

&quot;8½&quot; was filmed in the spherical cinematographic process, using 35-millimeter film, and exhibited with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1. As with most Italian films of this period, the sound was entirely dubbed in afterwards; following a technique dear to Fellini, many lines of the dialogue were written only during post production, while the actors on the set mouthed random lines. &quot;8½&quot; marks the first time that actress Claudia Cardinale was allowed to dub her own dialogue; previously her voice was thought to be too throaty and, coupled with her Tunisian accent, was considered undesirable. This is Fellini&#x27;s last black-and-white film.

In September 1962, Fellini shot the end of the film as initially written: Guido and his wife sit together in the restaurant car of a train bound for Rome. Lost in thought, Guido looks up to see all the characters of his film smiling ambiguously at him as the train enters a tunnel. Fellini then shot an alternative ending set around the spaceship on the beach at dusk but with the intention of using the scenes as a trailer for promotional purposes only. In the 2002 documentary &quot;&quot;, co-scriptwriter Tullio Pinelli explains how he warned Fellini to abandon the train sequence with its implicit theme of suicide for an upbeat ending. Fellini accepted the advice, using the alternative beach sequence as a more harmonious and exuberant finale.

After shooting wrapped on 14 October, Nino Rota composed various circus marches and fanfares that would later become signature tunes of the maestro&#x27;s cinema.

== Reception ==
===Critical response===
First released in Italy on 14 February 1963, &quot;8½&quot; received widespread acclaim, with reviewers hailing Fellini as &quot;a genius possessed of a magic touch, a prodigious style&quot;. Italian novelist and critic Alberto Moravia described the film&#x27;s protagonist, Guido Anselmi, as &quot;obsessed by eroticism, a sadist, a masochist, a self-mythologizer, an adulterer, a clown, a liar and a cheat. He&#x27;s afraid of life and wants to return to his mother&#x27;s womb ... In some respects, he resembles Leopold Bloom, the hero of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, and we have the impression that Fellini has read and contemplated this book. The film is introverted, a sort of private monologue interspersed with glimpses of reality ... Fellini&#x27;s dreams are always surprising and, in a figurative sense, original, but his memories are pervaded by a deeper, more delicate sentiment. This is why the two episodes concerning the hero&#x27;s childhood at the old country house in Romagna and his meeting with the woman on the beach in Rimini are the best of the film, and among the best of all Fellini&#x27;s works to date&quot;.

Reviewing for &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, Giovanni Grazzini underlined that &quot;the beauty of the film lies in its &#x27;confusion&#x27;... a mixture of error and truth, reality and dream, stylistic and human values, and in the complete harmony between Fellini&#x27;s cinematographic language and Guido&#x27;s rambling imagination. It is impossible to distinguish Fellini from his fictional director and so Fellini&#x27;s faults coincide with Guido&#x27;s spiritual doubts. The osmosis between art and life is amazing. It will be difficult to repeat this achievement. Fellini&#x27;s genius shines in everything here, as it has rarely shone in the movies. There isn&#x27;t a set, a character or a situation that doesn&#x27;t have a precise meaning on the great stage that is &quot;8½&quot;&quot;. Mario Verdone of &quot;Bianco e Nero&quot; insisted the film was &quot;like a brilliant improvisation ... The film became the most difficult feat the director ever tried to pull off. It is like a series of acrobats [sic] that a tightrope walker tries to execute high above the crowd, ... always on the verge of falling and being smashed on the ground. But at just the right moment, the acrobat knows how to perform the right somersault: with a push he straightens up, saves himself and wins&quot;.

&quot;8½&quot; screened at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival in April to &quot;almost universal acclaim&quot; and was Italy&#x27;s official entry in the later 3rd Moscow International Film Festival where it won the Grand Prize. French film director François Truffaut wrote: &quot;Fellini&#x27;s film is complete, simple, beautiful, honest, like the one Guido wants to make in &quot;8½&quot;&quot;. &quot;Premier Plan&quot; critics André Bouissy and Raymond Borde argued that the film &quot;has the importance, magnitude, and technical mastery of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. It has aged twenty years of the avant-garde in one fell swoop because it both integrates and surpasses all the discoveries of experimental cinema&quot;. Pierre Kast of &quot;Les Cahiers du cinéma&quot; explained that &quot;my admiration for Fellini is not without limits. For instance, I did not enjoy &quot;La Strada&quot; but I did &quot;I Vitelloni&quot;. But I think we must all admit that &quot;8½&quot;, leaving aside for the moment all prejudice and reserve, is prodigious. Fantastic liberality, a total absence of precaution and hypocrisy, absolute dispassionate sincerity, artistic and financial courage these are the characteristics of this incredible undertaking&quot;. The film ranked 10th on Cahiers du Cinéma&#x27;s Top 10 Films of the Year List in 1963.

Released in the United States on 25 June 1963 by Joseph E. Levine, who had bought the rights sight unseen, the film was screened at the Festival Theatre in New York City in the presence of Fellini and Marcello Mastroianni. The acclaim was unanimous with the exception of reviews by Judith Crist, Pauline Kael, and John Simon. Crist &quot;didn&#x27;t think the film touched the heart or moved the spirit&quot;. Kael derided the film as a &quot;structural disaster&quot; while Simon considered it &quot;a disheartening fiasco&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; defended the film as &quot;beyond doubt, a work of art of the first magnitude&quot;. Bosley Crowther praised it in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a piece of entertainment that will really make you sit up straight and think, a movie endowed with the challenge of a fascinating intellectual game ... If Mr. Fellini has not produced another masterpieceanother all-powerful exposure of Italy&#x27;s ironic sweet lifehe has made a stimulating contemplation of what might be called, with equal irony, a sweet guy&quot;. Archer Winsten of the &quot;New York Post&quot; interpreted the film as &quot;a kind of review and summary of Fellini&#x27;s picture-making&quot; but doubted that it would appeal as directly to the American public as &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; had three years earlier: &quot;This is a subtler, more imaginative, less sensational piece of work. There will be more people here who consider it confused and confusing. And when they do understand what it is aboutthe simultaneous creation of a work of art, a philosophy of living together in happiness, and the imposition of each upon the other, they will not be as pleased as if they had attended the exposition of an international scandal&quot;. Audiences, however, loved it to such an extent that a company attempted to obtain the rights to mass-produce Guido Anselmi&#x27;s black director&#x27;s hat.

Fellini biographer Hollis Alpert noted that in the months following its release, critical commentary on &quot;8½&quot; proliferated as the film &quot;became an intellectual cud to chew on&quot;. Philosopher and social critic Dwight Macdonald, for example, insisted it was &quot;the most brilliant, varied, and entertaining movie since &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;&quot;. In 1987, a group of thirty European intellectuals and filmmakers voted &quot;Otto e mezzo&quot; the most important European film ever made. In 1993, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film reviewer Roger Ebert wrote that &quot;despite the efforts of several other filmmakers to make their own versions of the same story, it remains the definitive film about director&#x27;s block&quot;. &quot;8½&quot; was voted the best foreign (i.e. non-Swedish) sound film with 21 votes in a 1964 poll of 50 Swedish film professionals organized by Swedish film magazine &quot;&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked the film at number 112 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted it at No. 36 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. In 2000, Ebert added it to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list, calling it &quot;the best film ever made about filmmaking&quot;, concluding &quot;I have seen &quot;8½&quot; over and over again, and my appreciation only deepens. It does what is almost impossible: Fellini is a magician who discusses, reveals, explains and deconstructs his tricks, while still fooling us with them. He claims he doesn&#x27;t know what he wants or how to achieve it, and the film proves he knows exactly, and rejoices in his knowledge.&quot; &quot;8½&quot; is a fixture on the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; and directors&#x27; polls of the top 10 films ever made. The film ranked 4th and 5th on critics&#x27; poll in 1972 and 1982 respectively. It ranked 2nd on the magazine&#x27;s 1992 and 2002 &quot;Directors&#x27; Top Ten Poll&quot; and 8th on the 2002 &quot;Critics&#x27; Top Ten Poll&quot;. It was slightly lower in the 2012 directors&#x27; poll, 4th and 10th on the 2012 critics&#x27; poll. The film was included in &quot;Time&quot;″s All-Time 100 best movies list in 2005. The film was voted at No. 46 on the list of &quot;100 Greatest Films&quot; by the prominent French magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; in 2008. In 2010, the film was ranked #62 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot;. It was also ranked number 1 when the asked 279 Polish film professionals (filmmakers, critics, and professors) to vote for the best films in 2015.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;8½&quot; has an approval rating of 97% based on 61 reviews, with an average score of 8.5/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Inventive, thought-provoking, and funny, 8 1/2 represents the arguable peak of Federico Fellini&#x27;s many towering feats of cinema.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 93 out of 100 based on 23 critic&#x27;s reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

=== Awards and nominations ===
&quot;8½&quot; won two Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Costume Design (black-and-white) while garnering three other nominations for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Art Direction (black-and-white). The New York Film Critics Circle also named &quot;8½&quot; best foreign language film in 1964. The Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists awarded the film all seven prizes for director, producer, original story, screenplay, music, cinematography, and best supporting actress (Sandra Milo). It also garnered nominations for Best Actor, Best Costume Design, and Best Production Design.

At the Saint Vincent Film Festival, it was awarded Grand Prize over Luchino Visconti&#x27;s &quot;Il gattopardo&quot; (&quot;The Leopard&quot;). The film screened in April at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival to &quot;almost universal acclaim but no prize was awarded because it was shown outside the competition. Cannes rules demanded exclusivity in competition entries, and &quot;8½&quot; was already earmarked as Italy&#x27;s official entry in the later Moscow festival&quot;. Presented on 18 July 1963 to an audience of 8,000 in the Kremlin&#x27;s conference hall, &quot;8½&quot; won the prestigious Grand Prize at the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival to acclaim that, according to Fellini biographer Tullio Kezich, worried the Soviet festival authorities: the applause was &quot;a cry for freedom&quot;. Jury members included Stanley Kramer, Jean Marais, Satyajit Ray, and screenwriter Sergio Amidei. The film was nominated for a BAFTA Award in Best Film from any Source category in 1964. It won the Best European Film Award at Bodil Awards in 1964. The film also won National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

== Influence ==
Later in the year of the film&#x27;s 1963 release, a group of young Italian writers founded Gruppo &#x27;63, a literary collective of the neoavanguardia composed of novelists, reviewers, critics, and poets inspired by &quot;8½&quot; and Umberto Eco&#x27;s seminal essay, &quot;Opera aperta&quot; (&quot;Open Work&quot;).

&quot;Imitations of &quot;8½&quot; pile up by directors all over the world&quot;, wrote Fellini biographer Tullio Kezich. The following is Kezich&#x27;s short-list of the films it has inspired: &quot;Mickey One&quot; (Arthur Penn, 1965), &quot;Alex in Wonderland&quot; (Paul Mazursky, 1970), &quot;Beware of a Holy Whore&quot; (Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 1971), &quot;Day for Night&quot; (François Truffaut, 1974), &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (Bob Fosse, 1979), &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; (Woody Allen, 1980), &quot;Sogni d&#x27;oro&quot; (Nanni Moretti, 1981), &quot;Planet Parade&quot; (Vadim Abdrashitov, 1984), &quot;A King and His Movie&quot; (Carlos Sorín, 1986), 1993), &quot;Living in Oblivion&quot; (Tom DiCillo, 1995), &quot;8½ Women&quot; (Peter Greenaway, 1999), and &quot;8½ $&quot; (Grigori Konstantinopolsky, 1999).

Martin Scorsese included &quot;8½&quot; on his ballot for the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll. In conversation with the Criterion Collection, he named it one of his favorites: What would Fellini do after &quot;La dolce vita&quot;? We all wondered. How would he top himself? Would he even want to top himself? Would he shift gears? Finally, he did something that no one could have anticipated at the time. He took his own artistic and life situation—that of a filmmaker who had eight and a half films to his name (episodes for two omnibus films and a shared credit with Alberto Lattuada on Variety Lights counted for him as one and a half films, plus seven), achieved international renown with his last feature and felt enormous pressure when the time came for a follow-up—and he built a movie around it. &quot;8½&quot; has always been a touchstone for me, in so many ways—the freedom, the sense of invention, the underlying rigor and the deep core of longing, the bewitching, physical pull of the camera movements and the compositions...But it also offers an uncanny portrait of being the artist of the moment, trying to tune out all the pressure and the criticism and the adulation and the requests and the advice, and find the space and the calm to simply listen to oneself. The picture has inspired many movies over the years (including &quot;Alex in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Stardust Memories&quot;, and &quot;All That Jazz&quot;), and we’ve seen the dilemma of Guido, the hero played by Marcello Mastroianni, repeated many times over in reality—look at the life of Bob Dylan during the period we covered in &quot;No Direction Home&quot;, to take just one example. Like with &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, I look at it again every year or so, and it&#x27;s always a different experience.

==Musical adaptation==
The Tony-winning 1982 Broadway musical &quot;Nine&quot; (score by Maury Yeston, book by Arthur Kopit) is based on the film, underscoring Guido&#x27;s obsession with women by making him the only male character. The original production, directed by Tommy Tune, starred Raúl Juliá as Guido, Anita Morris as Carla, Liliane Montevecchi as Liliane LaFleur, Guido&#x27;s producer and Karen Akers as Luisa. A 2003 Broadway revival starred Antonio Banderas, Jane Krakowski, Mary Stuart Masterson and Chita Rivera. The play was adapted into a 2009 film of the same name, directed by Rob Marshall and starring Daniel Day-Lewis as Guido alongside Nicole Kidman, Marion Cotillard, Judi Dench, Kate Hudson, Penélope Cruz, Sophia Loren, and Fergie.

<text>Mandurah ( ) is a coastal city in the Australian state of Western Australia, situated approximately south of the state capital, Perth. It is the state&#x27;s second most populous city, with a population of 90,306.

Mandurah&#x27;s central business district is located on the Mandurah Estuary, which is an outlet for the Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary. The city&#x27;s name is derived from the Noongar word &quot;mandjar&quot;, meaning &quot;meeting place&quot; or &quot;trading place&quot;. A townsite for Mandurah was laid out in 1831, two years after the establishment of the Swan River Colony, but attracted few residents, and until the post-war boom of the 1950s and 1960s it was little more than a small fishing village. In subsequent years, Mandurah&#x27;s reputation for boating and fishing attracted many retirees, including to the canal developments in the city&#x27;s south.

Along with four other local government areas (Boddington, Murray, Serpentine-Jarrahdale, and Waroona), the City of Mandurah is included in the wider Peel region. Mandurah is sometimes grouped together with Perth for statistical purposes, especially since the extension of the Kwinana Freeway and the completion of the Mandurah railway line in the late 2000s. The two cities now form a conurbation along the Indian Ocean coastline, although the Perth metropolitan area officially ends at Singleton around north of Mandurah&#x27;s city centre.

==Geography==
Mandurah has grown from isolated holiday communities along the shores of the Peel-Harvey Estuary to a major regional city in just over a decade, in a similar vein to the Gold Coast in Eastern Australia. In recent times, it has formed a conurbation with Perth along the coast; it is only south of Rockingham, a southern suburb of Perth.

Mandurah has also become a popular lifestyle alternative for Perth retirees and its connection with the Perth CBD has been strengthened with the opening of the Perth-Mandurah railway line in December 2007 and a direct road connection to the Kwinana Freeway built by late 2010. A housing affordability survey of 227 cities in 2008 ranked it the least affordable city in Australia.

===Geology===
The waters of the Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary (one of Australia&#x27;s larger inlet systems) form the centre of Mandurah. The estuary is approximately twice the size of Sydney Harbour. The city lies in and around this freshwater system which in turn feeds into the Indian Ocean. The city and its suburbs have many kilometres of ocean coastline most of which is sandy beaches. Mandurah also has a number of suburbs built around artificially created canal systems that extend from the Peel Inlet, such as Halls Head, Dudley Park and Wannanup.

In terms of geology, much of Mandurah lies on the dune systems which dominate South Western WA&#x27;s coastline, progressively grading towards the Swan Coastal Plain as one travels inland. The area has infertile soils due to the dunes being rather sandy, having poor water retention qualities. Limestone outcrops are found to the north of the city especially along the Mandurah railway line. Mandurah is the closest city to Yalgorup National Park which is home to modern thrombolites as well as an array of flora and fauna.

Mandurah is located in the Swan Coastal Plain ecoregion. The ecoregion contains an array of vegetation, from coastal dune and sandplains to banksia and eucalypt woodlands. Mandurah is covered by shoreline and dune deposits from the Pleistocene and Holocene that overlie Paleozoic and Neogene deposits of the Perth Basin. Coastal dunes feature scrub-heath communities, though banksia low woodlands occur on the soils of coastal dunes. Progressing inland give way to eucalypt woodlands.

Seasonal wetlands (dry in the summer and wet in winter) are the most diverse habitat in the Swan Coastal Plain, which Mandurah has several wetland regions around the Peel Inlet. The wetlands feature several osprey nests, spoonbill and darters. Other fauna includes galah, short-billed black cockatoo, long-billed black cockatoo, and Australian ringneck among others. Australian ringnecks face competition for nesting space from rainbow lorikeet, an introduced species in Western Australia, that has now spread to Mandurah. Despite attempts to eradicate rainbow lorikeets, the population has grown to the point that they can no longer be eradicated.

===Political===

Mandurah is typically considered a marginal area for the major parties in Australian politics. Northern Mandurah lies in the safe Labor Federal seat of Brand, held by Gary Gray, while southern and central Mandurah lies in the more marginal Canning, held by the Liberal Party&#x27;s Andrew Hastie. At state level, northern and central Mandurah is located in the safe Labor seat of Mandurah held by David Templeman, while southern Mandurah is located in Dawesville, a traditionally safe Liberal seat that was swept up in Labor&#x27;s landslide of 2021, and is now held by Labor&#x27;s Lisa Munday. A sliver of eastern Mandurah is located in Murray-Wellington, held by Labor&#x27;s Robyn Clarke. Despite technically being in a regional area, the National Party vote is negligible.

===Climate===
Mandurah has a typical Mediterranean climate (Köppen classification &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot dry summers and mild wet winters. During summer (December to February), the average maximum temperature is 27 °C (80 °F) with an average minimum temperature of 19 °C (66 °F). At its extreme it can get very hot, often having a couple of days exceed 40 °C (104 °F) in the latter half of summer. In winter (June to August), the average maximum temperature is 18 °C (64 °F) with an average minimum temperature of 9 °C (48 °F). Mandurah&#x27;s proximity to the ocean moderates diurnal temperatures somewhat, with temperatures a few kilometres inland often 4 or 5 degrees warmer during summer days (or cooler during winter nights). Frosts are very rare as a result, but do occur annually around areas such as Greenfields. The current weather station opened in 2001 and is situated on the coastline, causing data recorded to appear warmer during winter nights and cooler in summer days compared to surrounding areas.

Mandurah also receives a moderate though highly seasonal rainfall of about 850 mm a year, however recent trends have seen this once reliable rainfall drop significantly. In addition, most of the winter rains are usually accompanied by severe winds and storms capable of causing widespread damage, making Mandurah one of the windiest cities in Australia. These conditions are perfect for tornado formation, which Mandurah&#x27;s climate is remarkable for producing one of the highest densities of tornadoes in the world.

Summer storms are rare due to the Mediterranean climate in the city, but not unheard of. Mandurah was affected to a lesser degree than Perth in the 2010 Western Australian storms, but the 2011–12 summer was notable for Mandurah bearing the brunt of three severe thunderstorms. One such storm on 12 December 2011 gave Mandurah almost seven times its monthly average (69.4 mm compared to an average of 15.5 mm), which was eclipsed exactly one year later on 12 December 2012 (74.2 mm). Another storm on 20 January 2012 dumped 57 mm on the city causing power outages and flash flooding. One man and numerous buildings in the city were struck by lightning during the storm, which produced 2,300 strikes within 30 kilometres of the city, which was more than what neighbouring Perth receives in an entire year and comparable to the most severe electrical storms for which places in the tropics like Darwin are known. 
==History==
The Noongar (or Bibbulmun) people, who inhabited the southwest of Western Australia, named the area Mandjar (&quot;meeting place&quot;), which became the present day name &quot;Mandurah&quot;.

In December 1829, Thomas Peel arrived in Western Australia from the United Kingdom with workmen, equipment and stores on the ship . He had financed the trip in exchange for a grant of land in the Swan River Colony. A term of the grant was that he arrive no later than 1 November 1829, thus his original land grant was forfeited. Undaunted, Peel built a small settlement named Clarence south of the Swan River Colony at what is known today as Woodman Point. Facing many problems with the settlement and his own ill-health, Peel led the remaining Clarence settlers to the area known today as Mandurah. Soon after, other settlers also took up land in Mandurah including the families Hall (whose cottage at Halls Head is one of the region&#x27;s most notable heritage places), Tuckey and Eacott. The census of 1837 records only 12 settlers at Mandurah, probably representing only 3 households. Thomas Peel died in 1865 but Mandurah continued to grow, albeit very slowly, over the years leading to the 20th century. Fish were abundant, and in 1870 a fish cannery was established at Mandurah. Canning factories sustained the preservation of produce from local fishing and fruit industries.

A railway line between Perth and Pinjarra was opened in 1893, which allowed Mandurah to emerge as a tourism hub in the region.

The population of the town was 160 (95 males and 65 females) in 1898.

Mandurah was administered under the Murray Road Board until 1949, when the Mandurah Road Board was established. However, dissension within the board during the 1950s saw it suspended and Commissioner Richard Rushton oversaw the town&#x27;s affairs. On 26 April 1960, the Mandurah Road Board was reconstituted, and on 1 July 1961, in accordance with the Local Government Act 1960, the Shire of Mandurah was founded.

Industrial development at Kwinana (1955), a mining boom in nearby Jarrahdale (1963) and Wagerup (1984), with the associated industrial boom in Pinjarra (1963), combined with an idyllic lifestyle by the coast, saw Mandurah grow rapidly, and on 1 July 1987 it became the Town of Mandurah. Three years later, on 14 April 1990, Mandurah became the fifth non-metropolitan settlement in Western Australia to be named a city.

===Tourism===
Mandurah is considered the unofficial gateway to the South West and possesses a variety of tourist attractions, most of which are located near the water. It is a major fishing and crabbing area in Western Australia, with the city well known for the blue manna crab (&quot;Portunus pelagicus&quot;) with a festival held in March known as Mandurah Crab Fest.

Mandurah is home to WA&#x27;s largest population of Bottlenose Dolphins (&quot;Tursiops&quot;), currently estimated at 120.

Like neighbouring settlements Bunbury and Rockingham dolphins and whales frequent the city annually and dolphin and whale watching are a popular pastime. In December, the canal areas in Mandurah becomes well known for their Christmas lights and special boat cruises are often promoted as a result.

There are two zoos within the outskirts of the city, as well as a miniature village, a tourist railway and a national park.

Mandurah is Australia&#x27;s top tourism town for 2023.

===Retail===
Mandurah has year-round seven-day shopping. Mandurah has five distinct shopping areas, including Mandurah Forum, which opened in 1983 and has had major renovations during 2016 to 2018 and is located at the intersection of Pinjarra and Mandurah Roads, The Bridge Quarter (or The Foreshore) located in the CBD, and Dolphin Quay/Mandurah Ocean Marina built at the intersection of Mandjar Bay and the Peel Inlet. There are also significant retail centres in Meadow Springs, Greenfields, Halls Head and Falcon.

===Mining===
Although not a mining settlement, Mandurah has a number of mines within two hours of the city. This includes bauxite mining and alumina refining at Pinjarra and Wagerup with the Huntly Mine at Pinjarra the largest in the world. Mandurah is also just one hour away from the Boddington Gold Mine, which has recently become Australia&#x27;s largest producing gold mine.

===Festivals===

The Mandurah Crab Fest is held annually on the estuary foreshore on the third weekend in March. Celebrating the region&#x27;s seafood, the event features food stalls and cooking demonstrations as well as live music and entertainment. It was first held in 1999, succeeding the Kanyana Carnival, which was held annually between 1966 and 1988, with sporadic events held during the 1990s.

Every New Year&#x27;s Eve, there are fireworks and live entertainment and activities throughout the evening through to midnight.

==Transport==

Highway 1 bisects the city of Mandurah as Mandurah Road towards Fremantle and Old Coast Road towards Bunbury. Meanwhile, Pinjarra and Gordon/Lakes Roads serve as major east-west corridors for the northern part of the city. The Kwinana Freeway and Forrest Highway also provides a rural bypass for the city. Mandjoogoordap Drive (formerly the Mandurah Entrance Road) also provides a direct link from the Kwinana Freeway.

The Mandurah railway line, opened in December 2007, links Mandurah to Perth, with a travel time of approximately 50 minutes. Public transport within Mandurah is provided by Transperth, due to its proximity to Perth itself, with eleven bus routes servicing the city. Mandurah is also a stop on Transwa bus services between Perth and the South West.

The Mandurah Estuary Bridge was constructed between 1981 and 1986, and was the first incrementally-launched box girder bridge in Australia. The Dawesville Channel (also known as the &quot;Dawesville Cut&quot;), a large man-made channel, was opened in April 1994. It was created to allow saline seawater from the Indian Ocean to flush into the Peel Inlet, to deal with the incidence of algal blooms which had plagued the estuary for many years.

==Media==
Mandurah lies at the southern end of the Perth TV licence area, and is close to the regional Western Australia licence area. Local translators provide five digital free to air networks from Perth: ABC, SBS, Seven Perth, Nine and 10 and three networks from southern Western Australia: Seven Regional WA, WIN and West Digital Television.

One local newspaper, the weekly “Mandurah Times” (formerly named “Mandurah Coastal Times) services the city. The &quot;Mandurah Mail&quot; circulated in the area until 2022 when it became an online-only publication. The Mandurah Mail no longer has local reporters.

Mandurah is served by two commercial radio stations, 91.7 The Wave (formerly known as 6MM 1116) and 97.3 Coast FM. Perth radio stations can also be heard in the city.

==Water use==
Mandurah is at the centre of a water recycling project known as the &quot;Halls Head Indirect Water Reuse Project&quot;. Based in Mandurah, it has been awarded the Western Australian Water Corporation Award for Water Treatment and Recycling in 2009. An aquifer is used to filter the area&#x27;s sewage water providing safe, quality irrigation water for local parks, gardens and ovals. Mandurah is also linked to Perth&#x27;s water supply.

==Sport==
Mandurah is home to the Peel Thunder Football Club in the West Australian Football League, Mandurah City FC in the Football West State League Division 1, and the Mandurah Magic in the NBL1 West.

Greyhound racing is held weekly at the Greyhounds WA Mandurah venue.

<doc id="318820" wikidata="Q604418" url="?curid=318820" title="An American Tragedy">
<text>An American Tragedy is a 1925 novel by American writer Theodore Dreiser. He began the manuscript in the summer of 1920, but a year later abandoned most of that text. It was based on the notorious murder of Grace Brown in 1906 and the trial of her lover, Chester Gillette. In 1923 Dreiser returned to the project, and with the help of his future wife Helen and two editor-secretaries, Louise Campbell and Sally Kusell, he completed the massive novel in 1925. The book entered the public domain in the United States on January 1, 2021.

==Plot==
Clyde Griffiths is raised by poor and devoutly religious parents to help in their street missionary work. As a young man, Clyde must, to help support his family, take menial jobs as a soda jerk, then a bellhop at a prestigious Kansas City hotel. There, his more sophisticated colleagues introduce him to bouts of social drinking and sex with prostitutes.

Enjoying his new lifestyle, Clyde becomes infatuated with Hortense Briggs, who manipulates him into buying her expensive gifts. When Clyde learns Hortense goes out with other men, he becomes jealous. Nevertheless, he would rather spend money on her than to help his sister, who had eloped, only to end up pregnant and abandoned by her lover.

Clyde&#x27;s life changes dramatically when his friend Sparser, driving Clyde, Hortense, and other friends back from a secluded rendezvous in the country in his boss&#x27;s car, used without permission, hits a little girl and kills her. Fleeing from the police at high speed, Sparser crashes the car. Everyone but Sparser and his partner flee the scene of the crime. Clyde leaves Kansas City, fearing prosecution as an accessory to Sparser&#x27;s crimes.

While working as a bellboy at an exclusive club in Chicago, he meets his wealthy uncle Samuel Griffiths, the owner of a shirt-collar factory in the fictional city of Lycurgus, New York. Samuel, feeling guilt for neglecting his poor relations, offers Clyde a menial job at the factory. After that, he promotes Clyde to a minor supervisory role.

Samuel Griffiths&#x27;s son Gilbert, Clyde&#x27;s immediate supervisor, warns Clyde that as a manager, he should not consort with women working under his supervision. At the same time the Griffithses pay Clyde little attention socially. As Clyde has no close friends in Lycurgus, he becomes lonely. Emotionally vulnerable, Clyde is drawn to Roberta Alden, a poor and innocent farm girl working in his shop, who falls in love with him. Clyde secretly courts Roberta, ultimately getting her pregnant.

At the same time, elegant young socialite Sondra Finchley, daughter of another Lycurgus factory owner, takes an interest in Clyde despite his cousin Gilbert&#x27;s efforts to keep them apart. Clyde&#x27;s engaging manner makes him popular among the young smart set of Lycurgus; he and Sondra become close, and he courts her while neglecting Roberta. Roberta expects Clyde to marry her to avert the shame of an unwed pregnancy, but Clyde now dreams instead of marrying Sondra.

Having failed to procure an abortion for Roberta, Clyde gives her no more than desultory help with living expenses while his relationship with Sondra matures. When Roberta threatens to reveal her relationship with Clyde unless he marries her, he plans to murder her by drowning while they go boating. He had read a local newspaper report of a boating accident.

Clyde takes Roberta out in a canoe on the fictional Big Bittern Lake (modeled on Big Moose Lake, New York) in the Adirondacks, and rows to a secluded bay. He freezes. Sensing something wrong, Roberta moves toward him, and he unintentionally strikes her in the face with a camera, stunning her and accidentally capsizing the boat. Roberta, unable to swim, drowns, while Clyde, unwilling to save her, swims to shore. The narrative implies that the blow was accidental, but the trail of circumstantial evidence left by the panicky and guilt-ridden Clyde points to murder.

The local authorities are eager to convict Clyde, to the point of manufacturing additional evidence against him, and he repeatedly incriminates himself with his confused and contradictory testimony. Despite a vigorous (and untruthful) defense by two lawyers hired by his uncle, Clyde is convicted, sentenced to death, and after an appeal is denied, he is executed by electric chair.
==Influences and characteristics==
Dreiser based the book on a notorious criminal case. On July 11, 1906, resort owners found an overturned boat and the body of Grace Brown at Big Moose Lake in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York. Chester Gillette was put on trial, and convicted of killing Brown, though he claimed that her death was a suicide. Gillette was executed by electric chair on March 30, 1908. The murder trial drew international attention when Brown&#x27;s love letters to Gillette were read in court. Dreiser saved newspaper clippings about the case for several years before writing his novel, during which he studied the case closely. He based Clyde Griffiths on Chester Gillette, deliberately giving him the same initials.

The historical location of most of the central events was Cortland, New York, a city situated in Cortland County in a region replete with place names resonant of Greco-Roman history. Townships include Homer, Solon, Virgil, Marathon, and Cincinnatus. Lycurgus, the pseudonym given to Cortland, was the legendary law-giver of ancient Sparta. Grace Brown, a farm girl from the small town of South Otselic in adjacent Chenango County, was the factory girl who was Gillette&#x27;s lover. The place where Grace was killed, Big Moose Lake in the Adirondacks, was called Big Bittern Lake in Dreiser&#x27;s novel.

A strikingly similar murder took place in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in 1934, when Robert Edwards clubbed Freda McKechnie, one of his two lovers, and placed her body in a lake. The cases were so similar that the press at the time dubbed the Edwards/McKechnie murder &quot;The American Tragedy&quot;. Edwards was eventually found guilty, and also executed by electric chair.

The novel is a tragedy, Clyde&#x27;s destruction being the consequence of his innate weaknesses: moral and physical cowardice, lack of scruples and self-discipline, muddled intellect, and unfocused ambition; additionally, the effect of his ingratiating (Dreiser uses the word &quot;soft&quot;) social manner places temptation in his way which he cannot resist.

This novel is full of symbolism, ranging from Clyde&#x27;s grotesque description of the high gloomy walls of the factory as an opportunity for success, symbolizing how it is all a mirage, to the description of girls as &quot;electrifying&quot; to foreshadow Clyde&#x27;s destination to the electric chair; Dreiser transforms everyday mundane objects to symbols.

Dreiser sustains readers&#x27; interest in the lengthy novel (over 800 pages) by the accumulation of detail, and by continually varying the &quot;emotional distance&quot; of his writing from Clyde and other characters, from detailed examination of their thoughts and motivations to dispassionate reportage.

==Adaptations==
The novel has been adapted several times into other forms, and the storyline has been used, not always attributed, as the basis for other works:
* A first stage adaptation written by Patrick Kearney for Broadway premiered at the Longacre Theatre in New York on October 11, 1926. In the cast was actress Miriam Hopkins, who had not yet started her film career.
* Sergei Eisenstein prepared a screenplay in the late 1920s which he hoped to have produced by Paramount or by Charlie Chaplin during Eisenstein&#x27;s stay in Hollywood in 1930. &quot;Foolish Wives&quot; and &quot;Greed&quot; director Erich von Stroheim briefly considered directing a film version in the 1920s. Dreiser strongly disapproved of the 1931 film version directed by Josef von Sternberg. 
* In April 1929, Dreiser agreed that German director Erwin Piscator should produce a stage version of &quot;An American Tragedy&quot;. Piscator&#x27;s stage adaptation premiered in Vienna in April 1932, and made its US debut in April 1935 at the Hedgerow Theatre, Rose Valley. The play was produced as well by Lee Strasberg at the Group Theatre in March 1936. A revival was produced by the Hedgerow Theatre in September 2010.
* In the 1940s, the novel inspired an episode of the award-winning old-time radio comedy &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;, an episode known as &quot;Weekend at Crystal Lake&quot;, or &quot;An American Tragedy&quot;. The episode revolved around the characters&#x27; misinterpreting the intentions of biology teacher Philip Boyton (played by Jeff Chandler), Connie Brooks&#x27;s (Eve Arden) high school colleague and love interest. The characters fear that Boynton plans to kill Miss Brooks during a leisurely weekend at their boss&#x27;s lakeside retreat. The episode was broadcast twice, on September 19, 1948, and on August 21, 1949. The episode was also repeated in 1955, when the show was a hit on both radio and television.
* The 1951 Paramount Pictures film &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;, directed by George Stevens and starring Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, and Shelley Winters, is &quot;Based on the novel &quot;An American Tragedy&quot; by Theodore Dreiser and the Patrick Kearney play adapted from the novel&quot; (quoted from film credits).
* Further television or film adaptations of &quot;An American Tragedy&quot; have been produced in Brazil (&quot;Um Lugar ao Sol&quot;, TV series, 1959, director: Dionísio Azevedo), Italy (&quot;:it:Una tragedia americana&quot;, Rai 1, 1962, regista: Anton Giulio Majano), Czechoslovakia (&quot;Americká tragédia&quot;, TV series, 1976, director: Stanislav Párnický), Philippines (&quot;Nakaw Na Pag-ibig&quot;, film, 1980, director: Lino Brocka), USSR (&quot;Американская трагедия&quot;, 4 parts, Lithuanian Film Studio, 1981, director: Marijonas Giedrys), and Japan (&quot;Hi no ataru basho&quot;, TV series, 1982, director: Masami Ryuji).
* Composer Tobias Picker adapted the material as an opera of the same title, with a libretto by Gene Scheer. It premiered at the Metropolitan Opera starring Nathan Gunn in New York on December 2, 2005.
* Critics and commentators have compared elements of Woody Allen&#x27;s film, &quot;Match Point&quot; (2005), to the central plot of the novel.
* The novel was adapted as a musical of the same title by three-time Tony Award-winning composer and lyricist Charles Strouse. It premiered at Muhlenberg College, located in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on March 24, 2010.
* In Cuba, the novel has been adapted and broadcast by Radio Progreso national broadcasting twice: in 1977 and 2001. The first of the versions starred such renowned actors as Raul Selis (as Clyde), Martha del Rio (Roberta), Miriam Mier (Sondra), Julio Alberto Casanova (Gilbert), and Maggie Castro (Bertine).
* Jennifer Donnelly&#x27;s 2003 young adult novel, &quot;A Northern Light&quot;, recounts the events from the narrative viewpoint of a young woman working at the local camp.
* In 2021, the classic crime novel was re-imagined in the form of a fictional investigative docuseries in &quot;The Anatomy of Desire&quot; by L. R. Dorn, the pen name of screenwriting team Matt Dorff and Suzanne Dunn.

<doc id="318823" wikidata="Q510373" url="?curid=318823" title="Lord High Steward">
<text>The Lord High Steward is the first of the Great Officers of State in England, nominally ranking above the Lord Chancellor.

The office has generally remained vacant since 1421, and is now an &quot;ad hoc&quot; office that is primarily ceremonial and is filled only for a coronation.

At coronations of the British monarch, the Lord High Steward bears St Edward&#x27;s Crown. The Lord High Steward has the sole legal power to preside over impeachment trials of peers (which last happened in 1806). The trial of peers by their peers (a law which applied for felonies) was abolished in 1948. In general, but not invariably, the Lord Chancellor was deputised (to act as Lord High Steward) in the felony trials. There was a &quot;Court of the Lord High Steward&quot; which served this purpose when Parliament was not in session.

Initially the position was largely an honorary one. It grew in importance until its holder became one of the most powerful men of the kingdom. From the late 12th century, the office was considered to be bound with the Earldom of Leicester. When the House of Lancaster ascended the throne in 1399, Henry IV made his second son, Thomas of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence, Lord High Steward. He held the post until his death in 1421.

The equivalent offices in Scotland and Ireland respectively are the Great Steward of Scotland (always held by the heir to the throne, known in Scotland as the Duke of Rothesay) and the Lord High Steward of Ireland (held by the Earls of Shrewsbury, who are also Earls of Waterford in the Peerage of Ireland).

<doc id="318826" wikidata="Q538267" url="?curid=318826" title="William of Moerbeke">
<text>William of Moerbeke, O.P. (; ; 1215–35 – 1286), was a prolific medieval translator of philosophical, medical, and scientific texts from Greek into Latin, enabled by the period of Latin rule of the Byzantine Empire. His translations were influential in his day, when few competing translations were available, and are still respected by modern scholars.

==Biography==
Moerbeke was Flemish by birth (his surname indicating an origin in Moerbeke near Geraardsbergen), and a Dominican by vocation. Little is known of his life. In the spring of 1260, he was at either at Nicaea or at Nicles in the Peloponnese; in the autumn of the same year, he was at Thebes, where the Dominicans had been since 1253 and where he dated his translation of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;De partibus animalium&quot;.

For a time, he resided at the pontifical court of Viterbo (with evidence for his residence there in 22 November 1267, May 1268, and 15 June 1271), where he met the Latin translator Vitellius, who dedicated to him the Latin optical treatise &quot;Perspectiva&quot; (also named &quot;Opticae libri decem&quot;). Subsequently, Moerbeke moved to Orvieto in 1272 and appeared at the Council of Lyons (1274). Then, from 1278 until his death in 1286 (which probably occurred several months before the nomination of his successor as bishop in October 1286), he occupied the Latin Archbishopric of Corinth, a Catholic see established in the northeastern Peloponnese after the Fourth Crusade. It is not clear how much time he actually spent in his see; documents show him on mission in Perugia for the pope in 1283 and dictating his will there.

He was associated with the philosopher Thomas Aquinas, the mathematician John Campanus, the Silesian naturalist and physician Witelo, and the astronomer Henri Bate of Mechlin, who dedicated to William his treatise on the astrolabe.

A little Greek village, Merbaka, with an exceptional late-13th-century church, is believed to have been named for him; it lies between Argos and Mycenae.

==Translations==
At the request of Aquinas—so it is assumed; the source document is not clear—he undertook a complete translation of the works of Aristotle directly from the Greek or, for some portions, in a revision of existing translations. The reason for the request was that many of the copies of Aristotle in Latin then in circulation had originated in Spain (see Toledo School of Translators), from Arabic whose texts in turn had often passed through Syriac versions rather than being translated from the originals.

Aquinas wrote his commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;De Anima&quot;, the translation of which from the Greek was completed by Moerbeke in 1267, while Aquinas was regent at the &quot;studium provinciale&quot; at the convent of Santa Sabina in Rome, the forerunner of the 16th-century College of Saint Thomas at Santa Maria sopra Minerva and the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;.

William of Moerbeke was the first translator of the &quot;Politics&quot; (c. 1260) into Latin, as the &quot;Politics&quot;, unlike other parts of the Aristotelian corpus, had not been translated into Arabic. He was also responsible for one of only three medieval Latin translations of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Rhetoric&quot;. William&#x27;s translations were already standard classics by the 14th century, when Henricus Hervodius put his finger on their enduring value: they were literal (&quot;de verbo in verbo&quot;), faithful to the spirit of Aristotle, and without elegance. For several of William&#x27;s translations, the Byzantine Greek manuscripts have since disappeared; without him the works would be lost.

William also translated John Philoponus and mathematical treatises by Hero of Alexandria and Archimedes. Especially important was his translation of the &quot;Elements of Theology&quot; of Proclus (made in 1268), because the &quot;Elements of Theology&quot; is one of the fundamental sources of the revived Neo-Platonic philosophical currents of the 13th century. His translation of Proclus&#x27; commentary on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Parmenides&quot;, which included Plato&#x27;s dialogue up to 142b in Stephanus pagination, made this text available in Latin for the first time. Some important shorter texts of Proclus, such as &quot;On Providence&quot;, &quot;On Providence and Fate&quot;, and &quot;On the Existence of Evil&quot;, are preserved only in William of Moerbeke&#x27;s translations.

The Vatican collection holds William&#x27;s own copy of the translation he made of the greatest Hellenistic mathematician, Archimedes, with commentaries of Eutocius, which was made in 1269 at the papal court in Viterbo. William consulted two of the best Byzantine Greek manuscripts of Archimedes, both of which have since disappeared. The manuscript, in his own hand, was in the exhibition &quot;Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture&quot; at the Library of Congress in 1993.

== In popular culture ==
In Umberto Eco&#x27;s puzzle-mystery set in the 1320s, &quot;The Name of the Rose,&quot; there is some debate among the monks about Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; (Second Day: Prime). Jorge of Burgos has condemned this book because knowledge of it came through the &quot;infidel Moors&quot; (as so much of Aristotle had indeed come). But the main character, William of Baskerville, knew that Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; had recently been translated directly from Greek into Latin by William of Moerbeke.

<doc id="318830" wikidata="Q737248" url="?curid=318830" title="Animalcule">
<text>Animalcule (; ) is an archaic term for microscopic organisms that included bacteria, protozoans, and very small animals. The word was invented by 17th-century Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek to refer to the microorganisms he observed in rainwater.

Some better-known types of animalcule include:
* &quot;Actinophrys&quot;, and other heliozoa, termed sun animalcules.
* &quot;Amoeba&quot;, termed &quot;Proteus&quot; animalcules.
* &quot;Noctiluca scintillans&quot;, commonly termed the sea sparkles.
* &quot;Paramecium&quot;, termed slipper animalcules.
* &quot;Rotifers&quot;, termed wheel animalcules.
* &quot;Stentor&quot;, termed trumpet animalcules.
* &quot;Vorticella&quot;, and other peritrichs, termed bell animalcules.

The concept seems to have been proposed at least as early as about 30 BC, as evidenced by this translation from Marcus Varro&#x27;s &quot;Rerum Rusticarum Libri Tres&quot;:

Note also if there be any swampy ground, both for the reasons given above, and because certain minute animals, invisible to the eye, breed there, and, borne by the air, reach the inside of the body by way of the mouth and nose, and cause diseases which are difficult to be rid of.

The term was also used during the 17th century by Henry Oldenburg, the first Secretary of the Royal Society and founding editor of &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, to translate the Dutch words used by van Leeuwenhoek to describe microorganisms that he discovered.

In Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, the word appears in adjectival form in the &#x27;Major-General&#x27;s Song&#x27;, in which Major-General Stanley sings, &#x27;I know the scientific names of beings animalculous...&#x27; 

The term continued to be current at least as late as 1879.

<text>An m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;-gameis an abstract [[board game]] in which two [[player (game)|player]]s take turns in placing a stone of their color on an &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; board, the winner being the player who first gets &quot;k&quot; stones of their own color in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Thus, [[tic-tac-toe]] is the 3,3,3-game and free-style [[gomoku]] is the 15,15,5-game. An &quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;-game is also called a k&quot;-in-a-row game on an &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; board.

The &quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;-games are mainly of mathematical interest. One seeks to find the game-theoretic value, the result of the game with perfect play. This is known as solving the game.

== Strategy stealing argument ==

A standard strategy stealing argument from combinatorial game theory shows that in no &quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;-game can there be a strategy that assures that the second player will win (a second-player winning strategy). This is because an extra stone given to either player in any position can only improve that player&#x27;s chances. The strategy stealing argument assumes that the second player has a winning strategy and demonstrates a winning strategy for the first player. The first player makes an arbitrary move, to begin with. After that, the player pretends that they are the second player and adopts the second player&#x27;s winning strategy. They can do this as long as the strategy doesn&#x27;t call for placing a stone on the &#x27;arbitrary&#x27; square that is already occupied. If this happens, though, they can again play an arbitrary move and continue as before with the second player&#x27;s winning strategy. Since an extra stone cannot hurt them, this is a winning strategy for the first player. The contradiction implies that the original assumption is false, and the second player cannot have a winning strategy.

This argument tells nothing about whether a particular game is a draw or a win for the first player. Also, it does not actually give a strategy for the first player.

== Applying results to different board sizes ==
A useful notion is a &quot;weak (&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) game&quot;, where the second player cannot win but may only draw (by preventing the first player from playing &quot;k&quot;-in-a-row). The weak version of a game then has just two possible outcomes (&quot;win&quot; and &quot;draw&quot;) instead of three.

If weak (&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) is a draw, then decreasing &quot;m&quot; or &quot;n&quot;, or increasing &quot;k&quot; will also result in a drawn game.

Conversely, if weak or normal (&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) is a win, then any larger weak (&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) is a win.

Note that proofs of draws using pairing strategies also prove a draw for the weak version and thus for all smaller versions.

== General results ==
The following statements refer to the first player in the weak game, assuming that both players use an optimal strategy.

* If a particular (&quot;m&quot;0, &quot;n&quot;0, &quot;k&quot;0) is a draw, then (&quot;m&quot;0, &quot;n&quot;0, &quot;k&quot;) with &quot;k&quot; ≥ &quot;k&quot;0 is a draw, and (&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;0) with &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;m&quot;0 and &quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;0 is a draw. Likewise, if (&quot;m&quot;0, &quot;n&quot;0, &quot;k&quot;0) is a win, then (&quot;m&quot;0, &quot;n&quot;0, &quot;k&quot;) with &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;k&quot;0 is a win, and (&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;0) with &quot;m&quot; ≥ &quot;m&quot;0 and &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;n&quot;0 is a win.
* &quot;k&quot; ≥ 9 is a draw: when &quot;k&quot; = 9 and the board is infinite, the second player can draw via a &quot;pairing strategy&quot;. A draw on an infinite board means that the game will go on forever with perfect play. A pairing strategy involves dividing all the squares of the board into pairs in such a way that by always playing on the pair of the first player&#x27;s square, the second player is ensured that the first player cannot get &quot;k&quot; in a line. A pairing strategy on an infinite board can be applied to any finite board as well – if the strategy calls for making a move outside the board, then the second player makes an arbitrary move inside the board.
* &quot;k&quot; ≥ 8 is a draw on an infinite board. It is not clear if this strategy applies to any finite board sizes. It is not known if the second player can force a draw when &quot;k&quot; is 6 or 7 on an infinite board.
* &quot;k&quot; ≥ 3 and either &quot;k&quot; &gt; &quot;m&quot; or &quot;k&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot; is a draw, also by a pairing strategy in the dimension not smaller than &quot;k&quot; (or trivially impossible to win if both are smaller)

== Specific results ==
* &quot;k&quot; = 1 and &quot;k&quot; = 2 are trivial wins, except for (1,1,2) and (2,1,2)
* (3,3,3) is a draw (see Tic-tac-toe), and (&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,3) is a draw if &quot;m&quot; &lt; 3 or &quot;n&quot; &lt; 3. (&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,3) is a win if &quot;m&quot; ≥ 3 and &quot;n&quot; ≥ 4 or &quot;m&quot; ≥ 4 and &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3. 
* (5,5,4) is a draw, which means that (&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,4) is a draw for &quot;m&quot; ≤ 5 and &quot;n&quot; ≤ 5, and (6,5,4) is a win, which means that (&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,4) is a win for &quot;m&quot; ≥ 6 and &quot;n&quot; ≥ 5 or &quot;m&quot; ≥ 5 and &quot;n&quot; ≥ 6. (&quot;m&quot;,4,4) is a win for &quot;m&quot; ≥ 9 and a draw for &quot;m&quot; ≤ 8.
* Computer search by Wei-Yuan Hsu and Chu-Ling Ko has shown that both (7,7,5) and (8,8,5) are draws, which means that (&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,5) is a draw for &quot;m&quot; ≤ 8 and &quot;n&quot; ≤ 8. Computer search by L. Victor Allis has shown that (15,15,5) is a win, even with one of the restrictive rules of Gomoku.
* (9,6,6) and (7,7,6) are both draws via pairings.

==Multidimensional variant==
It is possible to consider variants played on a multidimensional board instead of a bidimensional board.

For the case of &quot;k&quot;-in-a-row where the board is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hypercube with all edges with length &quot;k&quot;, Hales and Jewett proved that the game is a draw if &quot;k&quot; is odd and 
:&quot;k&quot; ≥ 3&quot;n&quot; − 1 

or if &quot;k&quot; is even and 
:&quot;k&quot; ≥ 2&quot;n&quot;+1 − 2.

They conjecture that the game is a draw also when the number of cells is at least twice the number of lines, which happens if and only if
:2 &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≥ (&quot;k&quot; + 2)&quot;n&quot;.

<doc id="318844" wikidata="Q763473" url="?curid=318844" title="Rabbi ben Ezra">
<text>&quot;Rabbi ben Ezra&quot; is a poem by Robert Browning about the famous Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra (10921167), one of the great Jewish poets and scholars of the 12th century. He wrote on grammar, astronomy, the astrolabe, and other topics.

== Analysis ==
The poem begins:
It is not a biography of Abraham ibn Ezra; like all of Browning&#x27;s historical poems, it is a free interpretation of the &quot;idea&quot; that ibn Ezra&#x27;s life and work suggests to Browning. At the center of the poem is a theistic paradox that good might lie in the inevitability of its absence:

== History ==
The poem was published in Browning&#x27;s &quot;Dramatis Personae&quot; in 1864.

<text>was the 12th &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan.

==Biography==
Ieyoshi was born as the second son of the 11th &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tokugawa Ienari and named Toshijirō (敏次郎). Toshijirō was appointed heir on the death of his elder brother, Takechiyo. He became shogun on September 2, 1837, at the age of 45 upon the retirement of his father, Tokugawa Ienari. However, Ienari continued to wield much power from behind the throne, and it was not until after his death in 1841 that Senior &quot;Rōjū&quot; Mizuno Tadakuni was able to purge the government of his clique, and to implement measures to overhaul the shogunate&#x27;s finances and controls in the aftermath of the Great Tenpō Famine of 1832–36.

Known as the Tenpō Reforms, these numerous sumptuary laws attempted to stabilize the economy through a return to the frugality, simplicity and discipline that were characteristic of the early Edo period, by banning most forms of entertainment and displays of wealth. The restrictions proved extremely unpopular with the commoners.

Increasing criticism of the government&#x27;s handling of foreign affairs led to the &quot;Bansha no goku&quot; in 1839, suppressing &quot;rangaku&quot; studies.

Another part of the Reform included the &quot;Agechi-rei&quot; of 1843, which was to have daimyō in the vicinity of Edo and Ōsaka surrender their holdings for equal amounts of land elsewhere, thereby consolidating Tokugawa control over these strategically vital areas. However, this was also greatly unpopular amongst daimyō of all ranks and income levels. To complicate the situation further, in May 1844, Edo Castle burned down, and Mizuno Tadakuni was forced into exile and retirement. Mizuno was replaced by Doi Yoshitsura, Abe Masahiro and Tsutsui Masanori as &quot;rōjū&quot;.
He forced the retirement of Tokugawa Nariaki in 1844 and placed Nariaki&#x27;s seventh son, Tokugawa Yoshinobu as head of the Hitotsubashi-Tokugawa house in 1847. He also forced the retirement of Shimazu Narioki in 1851.

In August 1844, William II of the Netherlands urged Japan to also open the mainland to trade, but was rejected. US Commodore Matthew Perry arrived on 3 June 1853, on a mission to force a treaty opening Japan to trade. Ieyoshi died on 27 July 1853, before the treaty could be concluded, of heart failure possibly brought on by heat stroke, and was succeeded by his third son Tokugawa Iesada. The following year the Tokugawa shogunate was forced to accept the American demands by signing the Convention of Kanagawa.

Tokugawa Ieyoshi&#x27;s grave is at the Tokugawa family mausoleum at Zōjō-ji in Shiba. His Buddhist name was Shintokuin.

==Family==
Ieyoshi&#x27;s official wife was Princess Takako (1795–1840), the sixth daughter of Prince Arisugawa Orihito. She relocated to Edo Castle in 1804 when she was only age 10, and they were formally wed in 1810. In 1813, she gave birth to a son, Takechiyo, followed by a daughter in 1815 and in 1816. In addition, Ieyoshi had another 13 sons and 11 daughters by numerous concubines; however, only one son, Tokugawa Iesada, lived past the age of 20.

<doc id="318852" wikidata="Q912552" url="?curid=318852" title="Geared steam locomotive">
<text>A geared steam locomotive is a type of steam locomotive which uses gearing, usually reduction gearing, in the drivetrain, as opposed to the common directly driven design.

This gearing is part of the machinery within the locomotive and should not be confused with the pinion that propels a rack locomotive along the rack between the rails. The geared steam locomotives that have been built have been for conventional track, relying on the adhesion between wheels and rail.

Unlike conventional steam locomotives, they are not classified by their wheel arrangement. Instead, they are classified by their model and the number of trucks they have.

== Explanation and rationale ==
The steam locomotive, as commonly employed, has its pistons directly attached to cranks on the driving wheels; thus, there is no gearing, one revolution of the driving wheels is equivalent to one revolution of the crank and thus two power strokes per piston (steam locomotives are almost universally double-acting, unlike the more familiar internal combustion engine).

The maximum rotational speed is fairly fixed for a given engine technology. Given the lack of any variable-ratio transmission between the piston engine and the wheels, the designer is forced to compromise between desired torque and desired maximum speed; the radius of the driving wheels determines this. The radius of the crank affixed to the wheel is of course less than this; its radius determines the length of the piston stroke. This cannot be too large, for the locomotive will be unable to generate enough steam to supply those large cylinders at speed; it cannot be too small, or the available starting torque and thus tractive effort will be too small, and the locomotive will not be able to start a train.

Many industrial applications require a low speed locomotive with ample starting tractive effort. These industries range from mining and quarry operations to forestry and logging operations. Steeply graded lines, especially when the track is cheaply built and not suited to high speeds, will also favour the usage of a locomotive with a high tractive effort. Although the trade-off of speed versus torque can be adjusted in favour of torque and tractive effort by reducing the size of the driving wheels, there is a practical limit below which this cannot be done without making the piston stroke too short on a directly-driven locomotive.

The solution is to separate the crank from the wheels, firstly allowing for a reasonable piston stroke and crank radius without requiring larger than desired driving wheels, and secondly allowing for reduction in rotational speed via gearing. Such a locomotive is a geared locomotive. Most were and are still single speed, but some did employ a variable-ratio gearbox and multiple ratios.

== Types of geared locomotive ==

The vast majority of geared locomotives in the world were built to one of three distinct designs, whether licensed and official, or clones built after the expiration of key patents. Of the types, the &quot;Shay locomotive&quot; was the most numerous and best known. The overwhelming majority operated on the North American region, but with a number in use in various parts of South America and a fair number in Australia and New Zealand, including home-developed types.

These were not the first locomotives to use geared transmission. Richard Trevithick&#x27;s Coalbrookdale Locomotive used a large gear instead of side rods to link the crankshaft to the driving axles, with a net 1:1 gear ratio. The early &quot;Grasshopper&quot; (1832), &quot;Crab&quot; (1837) and &quot;Mud Digger&quot; (1842) locomotives built for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad used gear ratios on the order of 2:1 so that each turn of the crankshaft caused about two turns of the driving axles. This allowed use of relatively small driving wheels without sacrificing speed.

===The Shay locomotive===

The Shay locomotive features an offset boiler with a multiple-cylinder engine affixed to it on the opposite side, driving a longitudinal shaft geared to the axles via bevel gears (see also Ephraim Shay, inventor).

===The Climax locomotive===

Classes B and C Climax locomotives have two inclined cylinders driving a transverse crankshaft, geared to a longitudinal driveshaft placed centrally on the locomotive and driving the powered trucks via internal gearing.

There was also an earlier Class A Climax with a vertically mounted marine-type steam engine, working through a similar drive-line, via a two-speed gearbox.

===The Heisler locomotive===

The Heisler locomotive has a &#x27;V-twin&#x27; style steam engine, one cylinder each side of the boiler, affixed to a centrally located longitudinal driveshaft, again geared to the wheels.

===Other types===
Besides the three main designs mentioned, there were other designs and clones:

* The Sentinel Waggon Works built numerous geared shunting locomotives to several designs mainly with vertical water-tube boilers and high-speed, enclosed, poppet-valve engines. These combined high-pressure boilers with high-reduction gearing to provide high torque at low speeds.
* The Willamette locomotive was an improved-upon clone of the Shay locomotive produced in limited number by Willamette Iron &amp; Steel (better known for their steam donkey engines) after key patents expired. West coast logging customers were clamoring for improvements in detail design and the application of more modern locomotive technology to the geared locomotive; Lima (manufacturers of the Shay) were dragging their heels. The Willamette was the response to that.
* Davenport Locomotive Works held a series of patents for gearboxes designed to ride between the locomotive frames of side-rod locomotives, the first granted in 1913, had open gearing. Later improvements had fully enclosed gears. This was offered as both a single-speed and two-speed transmission, and it was used in four-coupled and six-coupled side-rod locomotives, with the crankshaft input to the gearbox just behind the rear driver. Larger articulated locomotives were built with 2 4-coupled geared trucks, with the cylinders at the inboard ends and gearboxes outboard. Davenport advertised these locomotives for industrial, quarry and logging use.
* The Bell Locomotive Works sold a line of small industrial locomotives based on modular, fully enclosed 2-cylinder &quot;steam motors&quot; geared to the drive axles.
* A &amp; G Price Ltd of Thames, New Zealand built a number of geared locomotives, often home-grown variants of the Climax A, Climax B or Heisler types. They did however produce a type that is known as the &quot;16-wheeler&quot; (0-4-4-4-4-0) that was also produced by another NZ manufacturer, Johnson Brothers of Invercargill. Price&#x27;s last steam engine was a Heisler locomotive, built 3 years after the last American Heisler was built.
* Aveling and Porter built a few geared locomotives which were, essentially, traction engines with flanged wheels. The early ones used sprocket chain drive but later versions had spur gears.
* The Avonside Engine Company produced a small number of narrow-gauge geared steam locomotives for sugar cane plantations in Natal. These were similar in design to Heislers.
* The Kitson-Still locomotive used different ends of the same cylinders for steam or diesel propulsion. The crank was above the frame and a gear train of fixed reduction linked it to the centre axle.
* In 1899, the Wiener Lokomotivfabrik, Floridsdorf, Austria produced the narrow-gauge geared steam cog locomotives operated on the Achensee Railway. 
* Vertical boilered &quot;coffee-pot&quot; locomotives were often geared, though those made by De Winton were not.

== Today ==
With the decline of the commercial use of steam traction, the commercial use of geared locomotives has similarly reduced.

Some geared steam locomotives are still at work in the sugar plantations of Indonesia, and no doubt elsewhere too, but in most countries they may now be seen only on tourist lines, preservation sites and museums. These locomotives&#x27; particular advantage in cane sugar operations is their ability to use the dried solid residue of pressing the cane (see bagasse) as a fuel of trivial cost, providing that low cost technical labor is available to maintain the locomotives.

===Australia===
*Puffing Billy Railway in Victoria, Australia:
**Class B Climax 1694. Purchased by the Forests Commission Victoria in 1928 for hauling logs on the Tyers Valley timber tramway which branched off the Moe-Walhalla railway east of Melbourne. After decommissioning the locomotive in the early 1950s it was stored (abandoned) at the State Sawmill site at Erica until it was transferred to Puffing Billy&#x27;s museum for static display in 1965. Restored to steam by the Puffing Billy Railway in the 1980s. A major overhaul has been finished and it returned to service Sunday 8 September 2013.
**Lima-built Shay locomotive from the Ali-shan railway in Taiwan, although it has not yet been restored.

===Canada===
*The Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa, Ontario has an operational class B Shay Locomotive, that is in operation Sundays and Wednesdays in July and August.
*The British Columbia Forest Discovery Centre in Duncan, British Columbia. Shays - Lima shop numbers 2475 (display) and 3147 (out of service pending boiler work). Climax shop numbers 1057 (display) and 1359 (operational).

===Indonesia===
Wide variety of types still in use at sugar mills. Most are long wheelbase 0-10-0 locomotives that use an articulation technique incorporating a geared drive to the outer-most axles, the inner pair being direct-drive.

===New Zealand===

===United States===
No geared steam locomotives remain in commercial use in America. However, several are in operation on tourist lines.

*The Cass Scenic Railroad State Park in West Virginia uses only geared locomotives, and features the largest remaining and last Shay locomotive ever built, the 162-ton former Western Maryland Railway #6. The railroad also owns a Climax locomotive and a Heisler, enabling all three types to be seen.
*The Roaring Camp and Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad in Felton, California, has several operational Shays, a seldom-operated Heisler, and a Climax awaiting restoration.
*The White Mountain Central Railroad at Clark&#x27;s Trading Post in Lincoln, New Hampshire, operates Climax #6, built in 1920 (builder number 1603), on its tourist line. Clark&#x27;s also has the last remaining Shay in New England. The Shay is non-operational but in storage. Clark&#x27;s also has a 32-ton Heisler locomotive that is awaiting staybolt replacement.
*A 65-ton 1922 Lima locomotive with three-truck Shay design is on static display at the Travel Town open-air museum in Los Angeles.
*The Southeastern Railway Museum in Duluth, Georgia, has a two-truck Heisler (#9) lovingly restored on static display inside the main exhibit hall. The Heisler is painted for the Campbell Limestone Co and is in excellent condition.
*At the Mount Rainier Scenic Railroad in Washington state, a 99-ton West Fork Logging Heisler #91 is operational, a 70-ton Hillcrest Lumber Climax #10 is operational, a 95-ton Pickering Lumber Shay #11 is awaiting boiler work, and a 75-ton Rayonier Company Willamette #2 is operational and is the only Willamette operating.
*The Silver Creek and Stephenson Railroad in Freeport, Illinois. Heisler shop number 1260 in operation.
*The Durbin &amp; Greenbrier Valley Railroad in Durbin, West Virginia. Climax shop number 1059 in operation.
*The Sumpter Valley Railroad in Baker City, Oregon. Heisler shop #1306 in operation.
*The Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad in Garibaldi, Oregon. Heisler shop #1198 in operation.
*The Foster Brook &amp; State Line Railroad in Bradford, Pennsylvania. narrow-gauge Shay (Lima Locomotive Works shop #3118) operational. Not available to the public.
*The Georgetown Loop Railroad in Georgetown, Colorado. Shay (Lima Locomotive Works shop #3199) operational.
*The Yosemite Mountain Sugar Pine Railroad in Sugar Pine, California.
*The Hesston Steam Museum in Hesston, Indiana has an operational Shay locomotive that was first restored in 1975. It was severely damaged in the 1985 fire, but restored again between 2000 and 2006 in time for the foundation&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Restoration has since continued, and &quot;The Big Shay&quot; will begin offering rides to museum patrons the weekend of August 5, 2023.

===Taiwan===
The Alishan Forest Railway in Taiwan operated 22 Shay locomotives in the past, with the oldest dating to 1910 . Sixteen of the original 22 have been preserved, with 3 in operational condition and 1 preserved on the Puffing Billy Railway.

<text>The Shay locomotive is a geared steam locomotive that originated and was primarily used in North America. The locomotives were built to the patents of Ephraim Shay, who has been credited with the popularization of the concept of a &quot;geared steam locomotive&quot;. Although the design of Ephraim Shay&#x27;s early locomotives differed from later ones, there is a clear line of development that joins all Shays. Shay locomotives were especially suited to logging, mining and industrial operations and could operate successfully on steep or poor quality track.

== Development ==
Ephraim Shay (1839–1916), was a schoolteacher, a clerk in an American Civil War hospital, a civil servant, a logger, a merchant, a railway owner, and an inventor who lived in Michigan.

In the 1860s, he became a logger and wanted a better way to move logs to the mill than on winter snow sleds. He built his own tramway in 1875, on gauge track on wooden ties, allowing him to log all year round. Two years later he developed the idea of having an engine sit on a flatcar with a boiler, gears, and trucks that could pivot. The first Shay only had two cylinders and the front truck was mounted normally while the rear truck was fixed to the frame and could not swivel, much as normal drivers on a locomotive. He mounted the diameter by tall boiler centered on the car with the water tank over the front trucks and with an engine supplied by William Crippen mounted crossways over the rear trucks. Shay experimented first with a chain drive from the engine through the floor to the truck axle. It is not known if he powered one or both axles, but he soon found that the chain drive was not practical and he next tried a belt drive. It did not take long for the idea to become popular.

Shay applied for and was issued a patent for the basic idea in 1881. He patented an improved geared truck for his engines in 1901.

Lima Locomotive Works of Lima, Ohio built Ephraim Shay&#x27;s prototype engine in 1880.
Prior to 1884, all the Shays Lima produced weighed each and had just two cylinders. In 1884, they delivered the first 3-cylinder (Class B) Shay, and in 1885, the first 3-truck (Class C) Shay. The success of the Shay led to a major expansion and reorganization of the Lima company. When Lima first received the Shay idea it was not impressed, until John Carnes influenced the company to use the idea, resulting in the classic Shay design.

In 1903, Lima could claim that it had delivered the &quot;heaviest locomotive on drivers in the world&quot;, the first 4-truck (class D) Shay, weighing . This was built for the El Paso Rock Island Line from Alamogordo, New Mexico to Cox Canyon, away over winding curves and grades of up to 6%. The use of a two-truck tender was necessary because the poor water quality along the line meant that the locomotive had to carry enough water for a round trip.

Lewis E. Feightner, working for Lima, patented improved engine mounting brackets and a superheater for the Shay in 1908 and 1909.

After the basic Shay patents had expired, Willamette Iron and Steel Works of Portland, Oregon, manufactured Shay-type locomotives, and in 1927, Willamette obtained a patent on an improved geared truck for such locomotives. These became known as Willamette locomotives. Since &quot;Shay&quot; was a trademark of Lima, strictly speaking it is incorrect to refer to locomotives manufactured by Willamette and others as &quot;Shays&quot;. Six Shay Patent locomotives, known as Henderson-style Shays, were built by the Michigan Iron Works in Cadillac, Michigan.

==Overview==

According to Lima Locomotive Works in 1925, &quot;The Shay Geared Locomotive has a wide and varied range of service, being used in industrial, quarry, contractors, logging, mining and plantation work; (also on branch lines and mountain sections of trunk-line railways). It is especially adapted to industrial railroads in and around large manufacturing plants. Its value as a switching engine is due to the rapidity with which it will accelerate a load and to its ability to spot cars in a minimum of time. It is designed to take any curve on which standard cars can be operated.&quot; The company emphasized its performance on &quot;steep grades&quot;, &quot;uneven track&quot;, and &quot;track too light for a direct engine of the same axle load&quot;.

Shay locomotives had regular fire-tube boilers offset to the left to provide space for, and counterbalance the weight of, a two or three cylinder &quot;motor,&quot; mounted vertically on the right with longitudinal drive shafts extending fore and aft from the crankshaft at wheel axle height. These shafts had universal joints and square sliding prismatic joints to accommodate the swiveling trucks. Each axle was driven by a separate bevel gear, with no side rods.

The strength of these engines lies in the fact that all wheels, including, in some engines, those under the tender, are driven so that all the weight develops tractive effort. A high ratio of piston strokes to wheel revolutions allowed them to run at partial slip, where a conventional rod engine would spin its drive wheels and burn rails, losing all traction.

Shay locomotives were often known as &quot;sidewinders&quot; or &quot;stemwinders&quot; for their side-mounted drive shafts. Most were built for use in the United States, but many were exported, to about 30 countries, either by Lima, or after they had reached the end of their usefulness in the US.

==Classes==
Approximately 2,770 Shay locomotives were built by Lima in four classes, from , between 1878 and 1945.

* Class A: two cylinders, two trucks. Weight between .
* Class B: three cylinders, two trucks. Weight between .
* Class C: three cylinders, three trucks. Weight between .
* Class D: three cylinders, four trucks. Weight of . These were no more powerful than Class C, but had greater fuel and water capacity, resulting in improved adhesion.

Two Shays were built with two cylinders and three trucks.

Four Shays, gauge, were built left-handed, all special ordered by the Sr. Octaviano B. Cabrera Co., San Luis de la Paz, Mexico.

==Survivors==
116 Shays survive today, some a combination of parts of two Shays. This is a partial list: 
* The oldest surviving Shay, serial number 122, built in 1884, is currently displayed in Redding California, at Turtle Bay Exploration Park.
* The oldest operational Shay is located at the Cass Scenic Railroad State Park in West Virginia as their locomotive No. 5. It was first bought in 1905 by the West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co. at Cass. Number 5 is in fact still running on its original rail since it first ran in 1905.
* The Yosemite Lumber Company&#x27;s #4 Shay is partially restored and is on display at the Sierra Nevada Logging Museum in Arnold, California.

There they were picked up by a different railroad and taken to the mill.
* The Arizona State Railroad Museum foundation owns former Anaconda Copper Mining Shay No. 5, which was previously stored in Montana.

<doc id="318854" wikidata="Q335133" url="?curid=318854" title="Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey">
<text>Henry William Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey (17 May 1768 – 29 April 1854), styled Lord Paget between 1784 and 1812 and known as the Earl of Uxbridge between 1812 and 1815, was a British Army officer and politician. After serving as a member of parliament for Carnarvon and then for Milborne Port, he took part in the Flanders Campaign and then commanded the cavalry for Sir John Moore&#x27;s army in Spain during the Peninsular War; his cavalry showed distinct superiority over their French counterparts at the Battle of Sahagún and at the Battle of Benavente, where he defeated the elite chasseurs of the French Imperial Guard. During the Hundred Days he led the charge of the heavy cavalry against Comte d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s column at the Battle of Waterloo. At the end of the battle, he lost part of one leg to a cannonball. In later life, he served twice as Master-General of the Ordnance and twice as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

==Background, education and politics==
He was born Henry Bayley, the eldest son of Henry Bayley-Paget, 1st Earl of Uxbridge and his wife Jane (&quot;née&quot; Champagné), daughter of the Very Reverend Arthur Champagné, Dean of Clonmacnoise, Ireland. His father assumed the surname Paget in 1770. He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford.

Paget entered parliament at the 1790 general election as member for Carnarvon, a seat he held until the 1796 general election when his brother Edward was elected unopposed in his place. He then represented Milborne Port from 1796 until he resigned his seat in 1804 by appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, and again from the 1806 election to January 1810, when he took the Chiltern Hundreds again.

==Military career==

At the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Paget raised a regiment of Staffordshire volunteers and was given the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel-commandant in December 1793. As the 80th Regiment of Foot, the unit took part in the Flanders Campaign of 1794 under Paget&#x27;s command. He was formally commissioned into the British Army as a lieutenant in the 7th Regiment of Foot on 14 April 1795 and received rapid promotion, first to captain in the 23rd Regiment of Foot, also on 14 April 1795, then to major in the 65th Regiment of Foot, on 19 May 1795 and then to lieutenant-colonel in the 80th Regiment of Foot on 30 May 1795. He transferred to the command of the 16th Light Dragoons on 15 June 1795. Promoted to colonel on 3 May 1796, he was given command of the 7th Light Dragoons on 6 April 1797. He commanded a cavalry brigade at the Battle of Castricum in October 1799 during the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland.

Paget was promoted to major-general on 29 April 1802 and lieutenant-general on 25 April 1808. He commanded the cavalry for Sir John Moore&#x27;s army in Spain; his cavalry showed distinct superiority over their French counterparts at the Battle of Sahagún in December 1808, where his men captured two French lieutenant colonels and so mauled the French &quot;chasseurs&quot; that they ceased to exist as a viable regiment. He also commanded the cavalry at the Battle of Benavente later in December 1808, where he defeated the elite chasseurs of the French Imperial Guard, and then commanded the cavalry again during the Retreat to Corunna in January 1809. This was his last service in the Peninsular War, because his liaison with Lady Charlotte, the wife of Henry Wellesley, afterwards Lord Cowley, made it impossible subsequently for him to serve with Wellington, Wellesley&#x27;s brother. His only war service from 1809 to 1815 was in the disastrous Walcheren expedition in 1809, during which he commanded an infantry division. In 1810 he was divorced and then married Lady Charlotte, who had been divorced from her husband around the same time. He inherited the title of Earl of Uxbridge on his father&#x27;s death in March 1812 and was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 4 January 1815.

==Waterloo==
During the Hundred Days he was appointed cavalry commander in Belgium, under the still resentful eye of Wellington. He fought at the Battle of Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815 and at the Battle of Waterloo two days later, when he led the spectacular charge of the British heavy cavalry against Comte d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s column which checked and in part routed the French Army.

One of the last cannon shots fired that day hit Paget in the right leg, necessitating its amputation. According to anecdote, he was close to Wellington when his leg was hit, and exclaimed, &quot;By God, sir, I&#x27;ve lost my leg!&quot; – to which Wellington replied, &quot;By God, sir, so you have!&quot; The earliest account is that given in the diary of J. W. Croker on 8 December 1818, quoting Horace Seymour who was next to Uxbridge when he was hit and helped move the wounded general from the field: &quot;Rode with Horace Seymour. He was next to Lord Uxbridge when he was shot; he cried out: “I have got it at last.” And the Duke of Wellington only replied: “No? Have you, by God?&quot;&quot; According to his aide-de-camp, Thomas Wildman, during the amputation Paget smiled and said, &quot;I have had a pretty long run. I have been a beau these 47 years and it would not be fair to cut the young men out any longer.&quot; 

&#x27;Lord Uxbridge&#x27;s leg&#x27; became a tourist attraction in the village of Waterloo in Belgium, to which it had been removed and where it was later interred. Paget had an articulated artificial limb fitted. The prosthetic legs he had commissioned (from one James Potts) which had movable joints became known as &#x27;Anglesey legs&#x27; and he is credited with popularising the style. He became known as &#x27;One-Leg&#x27;.

Paget was created Marquess of Anglesey on 4 July 1815. A high monument to his heroism (designed by Thomas Harrison) was erected at Llanfairpwllgwyngyll on Anglesey, close to Paget&#x27;s country retreat at Plas Newydd, in 1816. He was also appointed a Knight of the Garter on 13 March 1818 and promoted to full general on 12 August 1819.

==Social life==
Paget was the commodore of the Royal Irish Yacht Club, based at Sackville Street, Dublin (now O&#x27;Connell Street) in 1832 at the time when he served as lord-lieutenant of Ireland.

==Later career==
Paget&#x27;s support of the proceedings against Queen Caroline, alleging her infidelity, made him for a time unpopular, and when he was on one occasion beset by a crowd, who compelled him to shout &quot;The Queen!&quot;, he added the wish, &quot;May all your wives be like her&quot;. At the coronation of George IV in July 1821, Paget acted as Lord High Steward of England. He was also given the additional honour of captain of Cowes Castle on 25 March 1826. In April 1827, he became a member of the Canningite Government, taking the post of Master-General of the Ordnance. Under the Wellington ministry, he accepted the appointment of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in February 1828.

In December 1828, Paget addressed a letter to Patrick Curtis, the Roman Catholic primate of Ireland, stating his belief in the need for Catholic emancipation, which led to his recall by the government; on the formation of Earl Grey&#x27;s administration in November 1830, he again became Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. In this capacity he introduced state-aided education for 400,000 children. In July 1833, the ministry resigned over the Irish question. Still an impressive horseman even with a cork leg, George Whyte-Melville recalled the crowds that formed to cheer Paget as his well-ridden hack wended the London route from Piccadilly into Albemarle Street. Paget spent the following thirteen years out of office, then joined Lord John Russell&#x27;s administration as Master-General of the Ordnance in July 1846. He was promoted to field-marshal on 9 November 1846 and, having been appointed Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire on 31 January 1849, he finally retired from the Government in March 1852.

Paget also served as honorary colonel of the 7th Light Dragoons and later of the Royal Horse Guards. He died of a stroke at Uxbridge House in Burlington Gardens on 29 April 1854 and was buried at Lichfield Cathedral, where a monument is erected to his honour. He was succeeded by his eldest son from his first marriage, Henry.

==Marriage and issue==

Paget was first married on 5 July 1795 in London to Lady Caroline Elizabeth Villiers (16 December 1774 – 16 June 1835), daughter of George Bussy Villiers, 4th Earl of Jersey and Frances Villiers, Countess of Jersey. They had eight children:

*Lady Caroline Paget (6 June 1796 – 12 March 1874); married Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond. They are ancestors of Diana, Princess of Wales, and of her sons, Princes William, the Prince of Wales, and Harry, Duke of Sussex.
*Henry Paget, 2nd Marquess of Anglesey (6 July 1797 – 7 February 1869); married Eleanora Campbell, granddaughter of John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll
*Lady Jane Paget (13 October 1798 – 28 January 1876); married Francis Conyngham, 2nd Marquess Conyngham.
*Lady Georgina Paget (29 August 1800 – 9 November 1875); married Edward Crofton, 2nd Baron Crofton.
*Lady Augusta Paget (26 January 1802 – 6 June 1872); married Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Templemore.
*Captain Lord William Paget RN (1 March 1803 – 17 May 1873); married Frances de Rottenburg, daughter of Francis de Rottenburg
*Lady Agnes Paget (11 February 1804 – 9 October 1845); married George Byng, 2nd Earl of Strafford; they were parents to George Byng, 3rd Earl of Strafford, Henry Byng, 4th Earl of Strafford and Francis Byng, 5th Earl of Strafford
*Lord Arthur Paget (31 January 1805 – 28 December 1825)

While Lady Paget recovered from the birth of their last child, Lord Paget 
&quot;paid her the kindest affectionate attentions yet from that period his love and affection for her as a wife seem to have been entirely estranged. While his Lordship lived in the same house sat at the same table and frequented the same Company with his wife he treated her person with the coldest indifference and neglect withholding all Connubial intercourse with her and constantly sleeping in a different room from her.&quot;

Paget had in fact begun an affair with Lady Charlotte Wellesley (1781–1853), the wife of Henry Wellesley (brother of the Duke of Wellington) and daughter of Charles Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan and Mary Churchill.

In November 1808, Paget went to Spain to fight in the Peninsular War, but on his return he and Lady Charlotte resumed their affair, and in March 1809 they scandalously eloped and began living together. On 28March 1809, Lady Charlotte&#x27;s brother, Henry Cadogan, challenged Paget to a duel:
&quot;My Lord, I hereby request you to name a time and place where I may meet you, to obtain satisfaction for the injury done myself and my whole family by your conduct to my sister. I have to add that the time must be as early as possible, and the place not in the immediate neighbourhood of London, as it is by concealment alone that I am able to evade the Police.&quot;

The contest took place on Wimbledon Common on the morning of 30May with Hussey Vivian as Lord Paget&#x27;s second and Captain McKenzie as Cadogan&#x27;s. Both men discharged their pistols, honour was satisfied and the parties left the field uninjured. Henry Wellesley had his marriage dissolved by private act of parliament in 1810 and sued Lord Paget for damages.

By this time, Caroline, Lady Paget, had fallen in love with the Duke of Argyll, and was equally eager to divorce Lord Paget. However, she was unable to obtain a divorce in England, as only husbands could seek a bill of divorce on the grounds of adultery alone; for wives, the adultery was required to be compounded by &quot;life-threatening cruelty.&quot;

The Pagets took advantage of Scots law to get an expedited divorce. Lord Paget stayed together at hotels in Edinburgh and Perthshire, where they were witnessed in bed together by chambermaids. However, if Lady Charlotte had been identified by name she would not have been able to marry Lord Paget under Scottish law, and she &quot;positively refus&#x27;d letting Lord Paget domiciliate with any other woman&quot;, so the couple concealed her identity so the witnesses could attest they had no idea of the identity of the woman whom they saw with Lord Paget. It was said she &quot;eat, drank, and slept in a black veil&quot;.

The divorce was granted in Scotland, and Lord Paget and (the already pregnant) Lady Charlotte married in Edinburgh on 15 November 1810. They had 10 children, of whom six survived infancy:

*Lady Emily Paget (4 March 1810 – 6 March 1893); married John Townshend, 1st Earl Sydney.
*Lord Clarence Paget (17 June 1811 – 22 March 1895); married Martha Stuart, the youngest daughter of Admiral Sir Robert Otway.
*Lady Mary Paget (16 June 1812 – 20 February 1859); married John Montagu, 7th Earl of Sandwich. They were parents of Edward Montagu, 8th Earl of Sandwich.
*The Hon. Alfred Paget (4 May 1815 – buried 13 May 1815), died in infancy
*Lord Alfred Paget (29 June 1816 – 24 August 1888); married Cecilia, second daughter and co-heiress of George Thomas Wyndham, of Cromer Hall, Norfolk in 1847.
*Lord George Paget (16 March 1818 – 30 June 1880); a brigadier general of the British Army.
*Lady Adelaide Paget (2 January 1820 – 21 August 1890); married Frederick William Cadogan, a son of George Cadogan, 3rd Earl Cadogan and his wife Honoria Louisa Blake. She was a train-bearer at Queen Victoria&#x27;s coronation in 1838. She wrote the first book of patience games in the English language as well as other books and plays.
*Lord Albert Augustus William Paget (27 December 1821 – buried April 1822 in St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly; reburied 23 June 1823 in Lichfield Cathedral), died in infancy
*Lord Albert Arthur Paget (24 May 1823 – buried 23 June 1823), buried in Lichfield Cathedral with elder brother Lord Albert
*Lady Alice Paget (21 May 1825 – buried 10 June 1825)

<text>The Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company (1909–1929) was an American aircraft manufacturer originally founded by Glenn Hammond Curtiss and Augustus Moore Herring in Hammondsport, New York. After significant commercial success in its first decades, it merged with the Wright Aeronautical to form Curtiss-Wright Corporation.

==History==
=== Origin ===
In 1907, Glenn Curtiss was recruited by the scientist Dr. Alexander Graham Bell as a founding member of Bell&#x27;s Aerial Experiment Association (AEA), with the intent of establishing an aeronautical research and development organization. According to Bell, it was a &quot;co-operative scientific association, not for gain but for the love of the art and doing what we can to help one another.&quot;

In 1909, shortly before the AEA was disbanded, Curtiss partnered with Augustus Moore Herring to form the Herring-Curtiss Company. It was renamed the Curtiss Aeroplane Company in 1910 and reorganized in 1912 after being taken over by the Curtiss Motor Company.

===Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company===
The Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company was created on January 13, 1916, from the Curtiss Aeroplane Company of Hammondsport, New York, and Curtiss Motor Company of Bath, New York. Burgess Company of Marblehead, Massachusetts, became a subsidiary in February 1916. At the same time, the Curtiss Engineering Company was established as a subsidiary in Garden City, New York.

With the onset of World War I, military orders rose sharply, and Curtiss needed to expand quickly. In 1916, the company moved its headquarters and most manufacturing activities to Buffalo, New York, where there was far greater access to transportation, manpower, manufacturing expertise, and much needed capital. The company housed an aircraft engine factory in the former Taylor Signal Company-General Railway Signal Company. An ancillary operation was begun in Toronto, Ontario, that was involved in both production and training, setting up the first flying school in Canada in 1915.

In 1917, the two major aircraft patent holders, the Wright Company and the Curtiss Company, had effectively blocked the building of new airplanes, which were desperately needed as the United States was entering World War I. The U.S. government, as a result of a recommendation of a committee formed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, pressured the industry to form a cross-licensing organization (in other terms a Patent pool), the Manufacturer&#x27;s Aircraft Association. Later that year, Curtiss was acquired by the automobile manufacturer Willys-Overland.

Curtiss was instrumental in the development of U.S. Naval Aviation by providing training for pilots and providing aircraft. The first major order was for 144 various subtypes of the Model F trainer flying boat. In 1914, Curtiss had lured B. Douglas Thomas from Sopwith to design the Model J trainer, which led to the JN-4 two-seat biplane trainer (known affectionately as the &quot;Jenny&quot;).

The Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company worked with the United States&#x27; British and Canadian allies, resulting in JN-4 (Can) trainers (nicknamed the &quot;Canuck&quot;) being built in Canada. In order to complete large military orders, JN-4 production was distributed to five other manufacturers. After the war, large numbers of JN-4s were sold as surplus, making influential as the first plane for many interwar pilots, including Amelia Earhart. A stamp was printed to commemorate the Curtiss JN-4, however a printing error resulted in some having the aircraft image inverted, which has become very valuable, and one of the best known rare stamps, even being featured in a number of movies.
The Curtiss HS-2L flying boat was used extensively in the war for anti-submarine patrols and was operated from bases in Nova Scotia, France, and Portugal. John Cyril Porte of the Royal Navy and Curtiss worked together to improve the design of the Curtiss flying boats resulting in the Curtiss F5L and the similar Felixstowe F.3. Curtiss also worked with the United States Navy to develop the NC-4, which became the first aircraft to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in 1919, making several stops en route. By the end of World War I, the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company would claim to be the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, employing 18,000 in Buffalo and 3,000 in Hammondsport, New York. Curtiss produced 10,000 aircraft during that war, and more than 100 in a single week.

Peace brought cancellation of wartime contracts. In September 1920, the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company underwent a financial reorganization and Glenn Curtiss cashed out his stock in the company for $32 million and retired to Florida. He continued as a director of the company but served only as an advisor on design. Clement M. Keys gained control of the company from Willys-Overland and it later became the nucleus of a large group of aviation companies.

Curtiss seaplanes won the Schneider Cup in two consecutive races, those of 1923 and 1925. The 1923 race was won by U.S. Navy lieutenant David Rittenhouse flying a Curtiss R3C to . Piloted by U.S. Army Lt. Cyrus K. Bettis, a Curtiss R3C won the Pulitzer Trophy on October 12, 1925, at . Thirteen days later, Jimmy Doolittle won the Schneider Trophy in the same aircraft fitted with floats with a top speed of .

The Curtiss Robin light transport was first flown in 1928, becoming one of the company&#x27;s biggest sellers during the Great Depression, and the 769 built helped keep the company solvent when orders for military aircraft were hard to find.

===Curtiss-Wright Corporation===
On July 5, 1929, Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company together with 11 other Wright and Curtiss affiliated companies merged to become the Curtiss-Wright Corporation. One of the last projects started by Curtiss Aeroplane was the ambitious Curtiss-Bleecker SX-5-1 Helicopter, a design that had propellers located midpoint on each of the four large rotors that drove the main rotors. This design, while costly and well engineered, was ultimately a failure.

===Curtiss Aviation School===
Curtiss also operated a flying school at Long Branch Aerodrome in Toronto Township, Ontario, from 1915 to 1917 before being taken over by the Royal Flying Corps Canada.

===Atlantic Coast Aeronautical Station===
Glenn H. Curtiss sponsored the Atlantic Coast Aeronautical Station on a 20-acre tract east of the Newport News boat harbor in the Fall of 1915 with Captain Thomas Scott Baldwin as head. Many civilian students, including Canadians, later became famed World War I flyers. Victor Carlstrom, Vernon Castle, Eddie Stinson and General Billy Mitchell trained here. The school was disbanded in 1922.

<text>A Climax locomotive is a type of geared steam locomotive built by the &quot;Climax Manufacturing Company&quot; (later renamed to the &quot;Climax Locomotive Works&quot;), of Corry, Pennsylvania. These had two steam cylinders attached to a transmission located under the center of the boiler, which sent power to driveshafts running to the front and rear trucks. Some 1,000-1,100 were built in three classes (A, B, and C) between 1888 and 1928.

== Invention and production ==
The invention of the Climax locomotive is attributed to Charles D. Scott, who ran a forest railway near Spartansburg, Pennsylvania between 1875 and 1878. A lumberjack of considerable mechanical ingenuity, Scott sought to bring an improved logging locomotive of his own design to market and brought the drawings to the nearby Climax Manufacturing Company in Corry, Pennsylvania. The first four Climax locomotives were built and delivered in 1888. The design patent was filed in February in the same year and granted in December. The invention was not patented in the name of Scott, as he had only a limited education, so he left the drawings to his brother-in-law George D. Gilbert, who was a civil engineer by profession and worked for Climax. Gilbert had the invention patented in his name without mentioning Scott.

=== Gilbert patent ===

Gilbert&#x27;s patent specified an upright maritime-type two-cylinder steam engine, a 2-speed transmission and a drivetrain in the underframe passing just above the axle centers. The patented differential for transferring the power from the drive shaft to the wheels was only used in the first Climax locomotives. In a similar way to that used in an automobile, the force was transferred to the two wheels of an axle separately, with one wheel being firmly connected to the wheelset shaft and the other wheel being able to rotate loosely on a sleeve around the shaft. The idea of the differential transmissions was to reduce resistance on tight bends by allowing one wheel to turn with fewer revolutions than the one at the other end of the axle. The design did not prove workable, because when driving at the adhesion limit, less tractive effort could be exerted compared to locomotives with rigid wheelsets.

=== Battles patent ===

Rush S. Battles patented the basic design of the drivetrain without the differential, using simple hypoid bevel gears to drive the wheelsets with normal fixed wheels. Unlike the later, somewhat similar Heisler design, there were no side rods on the trucks and all gearing was open, exposed to the elements.

A further patent from 1891 describes a locomotive with horizontal cylinders connected to the drive shaft through a 2-speed transmission. Battles&#x27;s patent describes the core design that became the Class B Climax, and his patent illustrations show the name Climax emblazoned on the locomotive cab.

=== Scott patent ===
Charles D. Scott, who had previously proposed a less successful geared steam locomotive, filed a lawsuit against Gilbert and Battles and applied for a patent in his own name, which was granted to him on 20 December 1892 after a lengthy legal dispute. But the lawsuit left Scott penniless because he could hardly benefit from the invention.

Scott&#x27;s patent showed the arrangement of the steam engine, boiler and two-speed gearbox in accordance with Gilbert&#x27;s patent while the drive without differential gearbox was described in accordance to Battles&#x27; patent. Scott&#x27;s patent corresponds to the most common design of Class A Climax locomotives.

In 1893, Scott proposed a geared steam locomotive, in which the frame of the boiler was hinged to the frame of the tender. The running gear underneath the boiler was firmly connected to it and was driven by common lateral cylinders and side rods. Underneath the tender was a truck which was similar to the Climax locomotives driven by a central shaft which took the power from the front axle of the locomotive via a hypoid bevel gear. For the first time, the design used closed axle drives with housings on one hand protecting the gear unit from and on the other hand also containing the gear lubricant.

=== Production ===
All Climax locomotives were built by the &quot;Climax Manufacturing Company&quot; (later renamed to the &quot;Climax Locomotive Works&quot;), of Corry, Pennsylvania. In addition, an agency and service facility was established in Seattle, Washington to sell and maintain locomotives for west coast buyers. Production began in 1888 and the last Climax locomotive was produced in 1928. Between 1,000 and 1,100 were built.

=== Operational reliability ===
Many loggers considered the Climax superior to the Shay in hauling capability and stability, particularly in a smaller locomotive. This was due to its fully sprung truck arrangement; the Shay locomotive had no springs on the bogie on the drivetrain side and was therefore not fully able to compensate for twists in the track. The ride on the large class C Climax was characteristically rough for the crew, since the imbalance of the large drivetrain could only be compensated at one speed.

==Classes==
Climaxes were built in three distinct classes:

===Class A===
These featured a steam engine unit with two vertical cylinders mounted in the center of the locomotive. Class A Climaxes had a frame similar to a flatcar with wooden boxcar-like bodywork built up above it to protect the crew and fuel from the elements—this could be more or less covering between locomotive to locomotive. The front half of the locomotive, in front of the engine unit, contained the boiler. In smaller examples this may have been a vertical boiler, while in larger ones a tee boiler was employed. Class A Climaxes were small locomotives, generally under 17 tons. Class A Climaxes, unlike Heisler and Shay locomotives, had two-speed gearboxes.

===Class B===
Introduced in 1893, the Climax Class B was looking more like a conventional steam locomotive. It had the cylinders on both side of the boiler, permitting it to be longer and larger than possible with the Class A arrangement. The two cylinders drove a transverse shaft that was geared to the longitudinal driveshaft in the middle; on early Class B Climaxes, the cylinders were horizontal and pointing forwards, while later ones had the cylinders angled upwards at about 30 degrees from horizontal. Class B Climaxes weighed approximately 17 tons at minimum to a maximum of approximately 60 tons.

===Class C===
A class C was a three-truck design, the additional powered truck being beneath a water-carrying tender articulated to the locomotive. This allowed the locomotive to operate for longer periods of time before needing to stop for water. All Class C locomotives had inclined cylinders.

==Survivors==
Approximately 17 Climax locomotives survive in North America, of which about five are operational. 

*Two survive in Australia: No. 1694, restored and operational since 8 September 2013, at the Puffing Billy Railway, in Belgrave, and No. 1653, on display at Hobart, Tasmania. 

*The New Zealand Climaxes are No. 522, stored at Tokomaru, No. 1203, stored in Shantytown Heritage Park near Greymouth, No. 1317, under static restoration at Te Awamutu, and No. 1650, as of 2013 under restoration at Pukemiro. Hence, four of the seven Climax locos delivered to New Zealand have survived.

*The Climax locomotive No. 9 at the Cass Scenic Railroad State Park in West Virginia is operational, used alongside the Shays to power the regular excursions up Cheat Mountain from May to November.

*The White Mountain Central Railroad located off Interstate 93 in Lincoln, New Hampshire uses Climax #6 as the primary or main locomotive.

*The &quot;Durbin Rocket&quot;, of the Durbin and Greenbrier Valley Railroad in Durbin, West Virginia, is hauled by a Climax on its regular excursions.

*The Corry Area Historical Society&#x27;s Museum in Corry, Pennsylvania has a Class B Climax on display in its own exhibit room inside the museum, with the locomotive sitting on a section of track. Check out the website for current hours. 

*A restored Climax locomotive is on display at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania, located in Strasburg. It is displayed beside a Heisler locomotive and a Shay locomotive, which are also fully restored. The locomotives are not in operating condition. 

*Two Climax locomotives are preserved in Canada, both at the BC Forest Discovery Centre in Duncan, British Columbia. Shawnigan Lake Lumber Co. No. 2 is a 25-ton Class B locomotive, and was built in 1910 as shop number 1057. Hillcrest Lumber Co. No. 9 was built to a larger, 50-ton Class B design in 1915, and is Climax shop number 1359. Hillcrest Lumber Co. #10, the larger locomotive weighing 70 tons, is currently preserved at Mt. Rainier Scenic Railroad at Elbe, Washington. It is not currently operational and is awaiting work.

*One Climax is located in Roaring Camp And Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad, In Felton, California, USA. It is In pieces and as of 2017, its boiler and pistons are operation under its own steam, estimated full restoration in 5 – 10 years.

*Only two Climax Class A locomotives are known to survive today. One was located in Nome, Alaska before it was acquired 2019-2020, and is currently undergoing restoration in Corry, PA. The other, Cabin Creek Lumber Co. #1; was acquired by Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad in 2024 and will be restored to operation.
*One Class B Climax is preserved on the grounds of the Cradle of Forestry in North Carolina.

*Fruit Growers Supply Co. No. 3 is preserved on the grounds of the RailGiants Train Museum, located inside the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds in Pomona, California.

==Conversions==
Some Climaxes, especially Class A, were later converted to diesel or gasoline power, and some still exist in this form, using the original frame and drive mechanism.

<text>The Heisler locomotive is one of the three major types of geared steam locomotives and the last to be patented.

Charles L. Heisler received a patent for the design in 1892, following the construction of a prototype in 1891. Somewhat similar to a Climax locomotive, Heisler&#x27;s design featured two cylinders canted inwards at a 45-degree angle to form a &#x27;V-twin&#x27; arrangement. Power then went to a longitudinal drive shaft in the center of the frame that drove the outboard axle on each powered truck through bevel gears in an enclosed gearcase riding on the axle between the truck frames. The inboard axle on each truck was then driven from the outboard one by external side (connecting) rods.

In 1897, Heisler received a patent on a three-truck locomotive. As with Class C Shay locomotives, the tender rode on the third truck. Unlike the Shay, Heisler&#x27;s design did not have a continuous string of line shafting running the length of the engine. Instead, the tender truck was driven by a line shaft above the shaft driving the main engine trucks, connected to it through spur gears. This patent also covered use of a 4-cylinder &#x27;V4&#x27; cylinder configuration.

The Heisler was the fastest of the geared steam locomotive designs, and yet was still claimed by its manufacturer to have the same low-speed hauling ability.

==Builders==
The first Heislers were built by the Dunkirk Engineering Company of Dunkirk, New York, at the time producer of their own design of geared locomotive (called the Dunkirk), of which the Heisler could be considered an improvement. They did not adopt the Heisler design, but in 1894 the Stearns Manufacturing Company of Erie, Pennsylvania started to produce Heislers, and did so until 1904. Reorganised as the Heisler Locomotive Works in 1907, it produced locomotives of the Heisler design until 1941.

A &amp; G Price of Thames, New Zealand received an order for a Heisler locomotive in 1943 from Ogilvie and Co, sawmillers of Hokitika, who wanted to purchase a Heisler locomotive but were unable to do so as production of Heisler locomotives had ceased in 1941. The resulting locomotive, maker&#x27;s NO 148 of 1944, was the last Heisler-design steam locomotive to be built, and closely followed Heisler practice but with the addition of a Belpaire firebox and front-mounted water tanks that featured a unique curved leading edge.

==Variants==
Heislers were produced mostly in two- and three-truck variants in sizes ranging from . There was one single-truck, narrow-gauge Heisler-built, Lake Shore Stone Products Co. #7 for the Lake Shore Stone Products Co.Lake Shore Stone Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin?

==Notable survivors==
Roughly 625 Heislers were produced, of which some 35 still exist. Approximately eight of these survivors are currently operational. 
==Advantages and disadvantages==
The Heisler locomotive&#x27;s gearing was inside the frame and thus protected, unlike that of a Shay locomotive. However, the Heisler&#x27;s drive shaft, which was located in the center of the frame, limited firebox space. For this reason, when A &amp; G Price built their Heisler, in 1943, they used a Belpaire firebox, to mitigate problems with burning wood and accommodating the drive shaft.

==Conversions==
Similar to the Climax, some Heislers, especially two-truck ones, were converted to diesel or gasoline power, retaining their gearing and drive shafts, but their steam boiler is replaced by an internal combustion engine.

<text>The Willamette locomotive was a geared steam locomotive of the Shay locomotive type, built by the Willamette Iron and Steel Works of Portland, Oregon. After key patents on the Shay locomotive had expired, it was possible for other manufacturers to produce Shay-like locomotive designs.

==History==
Willamette Iron and Steel Works in Portland, Oregon, was well established in the Pacific Northwest, as a logging operations supplier, when they expanded into locomotive building. Their design of the Willamette locomotives, was focused on logging, incorporating all of the modern (in 1922) aspects of a Shay locomotive and the standard features most requested by western loggers; steel cabs, girder frame, cast trucks, air brakes, electric headlamps. The unique features of the locomotive were patented in 1923 (patent No. 1,464,696) by Albert Claypoole, an engineer with Willamette Iron and Steel Works. All Willamette locos were Standard gauge, 56½&quot;. A total of 33 were built in Portland Oregon, between Nov. 1922 and Dec. 1929; 1 ordered and cancelled in 1927. 

Three class sizes were built:

(50-2) 50-ton, 2-truck, with Three 11 inch x 13 inch cylinders, 2 built, 1 cancelled.

(70-3) 70-ton, 3-truck, with Three 12 inch x 15 inch cylinders, 27 built.

(75-3) 75-ton, 3-truck, with Three 12½ inch x 15 inch cylinders, 4 built.
Designed and introduced in late 1922, the high point in production was 1923, when 11 were built and shipped. By 1929, only one, the last one, was built.

The Willamette locomotive was very similar to a Shay, but had many differences, as the company that made them intended on making an &quot;improved Shay&quot;, even though the &quot;Pacific Coast Shay&quot;, later made by Lima, took up many of the features of the Willamette. The differences were:

*Most Willamettes were equipped with superheaters, while Shays usually were not.
*The boiler parts were riveted together, instead of being bolted together.
*The Willamette locomotive used Walschaerts valve gear driving piston valves, while the Shay mainly used Stephenson valve gear driving slide valves.
*The truck design was completely redone and rode much smoother.
*The rear cylinder on the Willamette was facing the same direction as the rest of the cylinders, while the two front cylinders on a Shay faced forward, with the rear cylinder facing backwards.
*The back cylinder on a Willamette was moved forward of the cab, while in a Shay, the back cylinder was almost protruding into the cab.
*The valve chests were all turned outward, making all three cylinders essentially identical.
*In a test done between a Shay and a Willamette, the Shay pulled 27 empty cars, while the Willamette pulled 29 empty cars, as well as using 40% less fuel.

All but one Willamette burned oil, despite their working for logging companies, where wood would be abundant. Oil burners produced few sparks, however, and were less likely to ignite a forest than coal- or wood-fired locomotives. The only coal-fired Willamette worked for Anaconda Copper.

Six Willamette locomotives survive. 
*Locomotive (Construction No. 34) Rayonier No. 2 was operational at the Mt. Rainier Scenic Railroad in Mineral, Washington, until the railroad shut down operations in 2020, but the line was later revived in 2023.
*Willamette Locomotive (Construction No. 7) Anaconda Copper and Mining No. 7 is undergoing restoration at The Historical Museum of Fort Missoula in Missoula, Montana. 
*Willamette Locomotive (Construction No. 21) Medford No. 7 is on display and can be viewed at Railroad Park Resort in Dunsmuir, California. 
*Willamette 1924-built (Construction No. 16) Locomotive Rayonier No. 4 is on display in Port Angeles, Washington and being cosmetically restored. As of 2023, the lead community organization for the project is the North Olympic Peninsula Railroaders, a local charitable organization dedicated to railroad history. 
*Crown-Zellerbach No. 6 Willamette (Construction No. 13) is on display in Cathlamet, Washington. 
*Medford No. 4 (Construction No. 18) is being restored to operation by the Southern Oregon Railway Historical Society in Medford, Oregon 

==In Popular Culture==
A Willamette locomotive, filmed on location in Washington, features prominently in the action sequences of the 1937 Warner Brothers film God&#x27;s Country and the Woman, with the film&#x27;s logging industry plot.

<doc id="318861" wikidata="Q270722" url="?curid=318861" title="Striated heron">
<text>The striated heron (Butorides striata) also known as mangrove heron, little green heron or green-backed heron, is a small heron, about 44 cm tall. Striated herons are mostly sedentary and noted for some interesting behavioural traits. Their breeding habitat is small wetlands in the Old World tropics from west Africa to Japan and Australia, and in South America and the Caribbean. Vagrants have been recorded on Oceanic islands, such as Chuuk and Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marianas and Palau; the bird recorded on Yap on February 25, 1991, was from a continental Asian rather than from a Melanesian population, while the origin of the bird seen on Palau on May 3, 2005 was not clear.

==Taxonomy==
The striated heron was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other herons in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea striata&quot;. Linnaeus specified the locality as Suriname. The specific epithet is from Latin &quot;striatus&quot; meaning &quot;striated&quot;. The striated heron is now one of three closely related species placed in the genus &quot;Butorides&quot; that was described in 1852 by the English zoologist Edward Blyth.

This bird was long considered to be conspecific with the closely related North American species, the green heron, which is now usually separated as &quot;Butorides virescens&quot;, as well as the lava heron of the Galápagos Islands (now &quot;Butorides sundevalli&quot;, but often included in &quot;Butorides striata&quot;, e.g. by BirdLife International); collectively they were called &quot;green-backed heron&quot;.

Currently, 21 subspecies are accepted:
* &quot;B. s. striata&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – east Panama to north Argentina, Bolivia and Chile
* &quot;B. s. atricapilla&quot; (Afzelius, 1804) – Africa south of the Sahara
* &quot;B. s. brevipes&quot; (Hemprich &amp; Ehrenberg, 1833) – Somalia and the Red Sea coasts
* &quot;B. s. crawfordi&quot; Nicoll, 1906 – Aldabra and Amirante groups (south, central Seychelles)
* &quot;B. s. rhizophorae&quot; Salomonsen, 1934 – Comoros
* &quot;B. s. rutenbergi&quot; (Hartlaub, 1880) – Madagascar and Réunion
* &quot;B. s. degens&quot; Hartert, EJO, 1920 – northeast Seychelles
* &quot;B. s. albolimbata&quot; Reichenow, 1900 – Chagos Archipelago and Maldives
* &quot;B. s. amurensis&quot; (Schrenck, 1860) – southeast Siberia, northeast China and Japan
* &quot;B. s. actophila&quot; Oberholser, 1912 – east China to north Myanmar and north Vietnam
* &quot;B. s. javanica&quot; (Horsfield, 1821) – Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka to Thailand, Philippines, the Greater Sundas and Sulawesi
* &quot;B. s. spodiogaster&quot; Sharpe, 1894 – Andaman and Nicobar Islands and islands off west Sumatra
* &quot;B. s. steini&quot; Mayr, 1943 – Lesser Sunda Islands
* &quot;B. s. moluccarum&quot; Hartert, EJO, 1920 – Moluccas
* &quot;B. s. papuensis&quot; Mayr, 1940 – northwest New Guinea
* &quot;B. s. idenburgi&quot; Rand, 1941 – north New Guinea
* &quot;B. s. flyensis&quot; Salomonsen, 1966 – central south, southeast New Guinea
* &quot;B. s. stagnatilis&quot; (Gould, 1848) – northwest, central north Australia
* &quot;B. s. macrorhyncha&quot; (Gould, 1848) – east, northeast Australia and New Caledonia
* &quot;B. s. solomonensis&quot; Mayr, 1940 – New Hanover Island (=New Hanover) to Solomon Islands (except Rennell Island), and Vanuatu to Fiji (southwest Polynesia)
* &quot;B. s. patruelis&quot; (Peale, 1849) – Tahiti Islands (Society Islands)

A recent study has found that &quot;Butorides striata&quot; as currently treated above is paraphyletic, with South American &quot;B. s. striata&quot; more closely related to North American &quot;B. virescens&quot; and Galapagos &quot;B. sundevalli&quot;, than it is to any of the Old World subspecies above. It is likely that the Old World subspecies will in the near future be split out as a separate species little heron &quot;Butorides atricapilla&quot; .

==Description==

The striated heron is in length, weighs and has a wing-span of . The sexes are alike. The plumage is vary variable, even sometimes within the same race. Adults have a blue-grey back and wings, white underparts, a black cap, a dark line extends from the bill to under the eye and short yellow legs. Juveniles are browner above and streaked below.

==Behaviour==
===Food and feeding===
These birds stand still at the water&#x27;s edge and wait to ambush prey, but are easier to see than many small heron species. They mainly eat small fish, frogs and aquatic insects. They sometimes use bait, dropping a feather or leaf carefully on the water surface and picking fish that come to investigate.

===Breeding===

The nest is a platform of sticks measuring between 20–40 cm long and 0.5–5 mm thick. The entire nest measures some 40–50 cm wide and 8–10 cm high outside, with an inner depression 20 cm wide and 4–5 cm deep. It is usually built in shrubs or trees but sometimes in sheltered locations on the ground, and often near water. The clutch is 2–5 eggs, which are pale blue and measure around 36 by 28 mm.

An adult bird was once observed in a peculiar and mysterious behaviour: while on the nest, it would grab a stick in its bill and make a rapid back-and-forth motion with the head, like a sewing machine&#x27;s needle. The significance of this behaviour is completely unknown: While such movements occur in many other nesting birds where they seem to compact the nest, move the eggs, or dislodge parasites, neither seems to have been the case in this particular striated heron.

Young birds will give a display when they feel threatened, by stretching out their necks and pointing the bill skywards. How far this would deter predators is not known.

Widespread and generally common, the striated heron is classified as a species of least concern by the IUCN; this holds true whether the lava heron is included in &quot;Butorides striata&quot; or not.

<doc id="318864" wikidata="Q941731" url="?curid=318864" title="Evergreen State College">
<text>The Evergreen State College is a public liberal arts college in Olympia, Washington. Founded in 1967, it offers a non-traditional undergraduate curriculum in which students have the option to design their own study towards a degree or follow a predetermined path of study. Full-time students can enroll in interdisciplinary academic programs, in addition to stand-alone classes. Programs typically offer students the opportunity to study several disciplines in a coordinated manner. Faculty write substantive narrative evaluations of students&#x27; work in place of issuing grades.

Evergreen&#x27;s main campus, which includes its own saltwater beach, spans 1,000 acres of forest close to the southern end of Puget Sound. Evergreen also has a satellite campus in nearby Tacoma. The school offers the following degrees: Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Environmental Studies, Master in Teaching, Master of Public Administration, and Master of Public Administration in Tribal Governance.

Evergreen was one of many alternative colleges and programs launched in the 1960s and 1970s, often described as experiments. While the vast majority of these have either closed or adopted more mainstream approaches, Evergreen is pursuing its mission, and after declines in the late 2010s experienced substantial growth in enrollment, with a record growth between 2022-2023 and school years 2023-2024 and four straight years of enrollment growth as of the 2024-2025 school year.

==History==
In 1964, a report was issued by the Council of Presidents of Washington State baccalaureate institutions stating that another college was needed in the state to balance the geographical distribution of the existing state institutions. This report spurred the 1965 Washington legislature to create the Temporary Advisory Council on Public Higher Education to study the need and possible location for a new state college.

In 1965–66, the Temporary Advisory Council on Public Higher Education (assisted by Nelson Associates of New York) concluded that &quot;at the earliest possible time a new college should be authorized&quot;, to be located at a suburban site in Thurston County within a radius of approximately from Olympia. Evergreen&#x27;s enabling legislation – HB 596 (Chapter 47, Laws of 1967) – stated that the campus should be no smaller than , making it then the largest campus in the state as well as the first public four-year college created in Washington in the 20th century.

On January 24, 1968, &quot;The Evergreen State College&quot; was selected from 31 choices as the name of the new institution. On November 1, 1968, Charles J. McCann assumed the first presidency of the college. McCann and the founding faculty held the first day of classes October 4, 1971, with 1,128 students. McCann served from 1968 until stepping down to join the faculty June 6, 1977, when former Governor Daniel J. Evans, who signed the legislation creating Evergreen, assumed the presidency. Evans left the president&#x27;s office in 1983 when he was appointed to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of senator Henry M. Jackson. The largest building on campus is named in honor of Evans, the Daniel J. Evans Library Building. The entrance to the campus bears McCann&#x27;s name, the Charles J. McCann plaza.

In 1982, Maxine Mimms founded Evergreen&#x27;s Tacoma campus.

In the 1992–93 school year, students chose Leonard Peltier to give the address at commencement, which was the first with a graduating class of more than 1,000. The selection was described as &quot;perhaps the most unconventional commencement speaker&quot; in a published round-up of the most controversial graduation speakers on campuses nationwide that year. Peltier, who was in federal prison, submitted his remarks in writing, to be read by a graduating senior.

In 1999, Mumia Abu-Jamal was invited to deliver the keynote address by audiotape for the graduating class at the college. The event was protested by some.

In 2004, the college completed the Seminar II building, as well as a significant remodeling of the Daniel J Evans Library.

In 2015, George Sumner Bridges became the sixth president of Evergreen State College, not counting interim appointments. Bridges had previously served as president of Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington. He followed Thomas L. &quot;Les&quot; Purce (2000–2015), Jane L. Jervis (1992–2000), and Joseph D. Olander (1985–1990).

===2017 protests===

President Bridges appointed a committee to study social equity on campus. In November 2016, the committee recommended changes to faculty hiring and evaluation criteria that proved to be controversial. Earlier that year, a white male faculty member was given an annual review that referred to his race and speculated whether students of color in his class were able to freely participate in discussions; however, ultimately the College agreed that a teacher&#x27;s race and gender should not be mentioned in performance reviews, so it was changed. The debate continued through the spring quarter. Every April from the 1970s until 2017, Evergreen held a daylong event called &quot;Day of Absence&quot;, inspired by the Douglas Turner Ward play of the same name, during which minority students and faculty members voluntarily stayed off campus to raise awareness of the contributions of minorities and to discuss racial and campus issues. Since 1992, the Day of Absence has been followed by the &quot;Day of Presence&quot;, when the campus community reunites. In 2017, approximately 25% of Evergreen students were members of racial minority groups.

In 2017, some students of color voiced concerns about feeling unwelcome on campus following the 2016 US presidential election and a 2015 off-campus police shooting. Consequently, &quot;it was decided that on Day of Absence, white students, staff and faculty will be invited to leave the campus for the day&#x27;s activities&quot; to attend an off-campus event. The off-campus event was held at a church that accommodated 200 people, about 7% of the white student body. An event for students of color was held on the Evergreen campus. Bret Weinstein, a professor of biology at Evergreen, wrote a letter in March to Evergreen faculty, protesting the change in format, stating &quot;On a college campus, one&#x27;s right to speak—or to be—must never be based on skin color.&quot; and &quot;There is a huge difference between a group or coalition deciding to voluntarily absent themselves from a shared space to highlight their vital and under-appreciated roles and a group or coalition encouraging another group to go away.&quot; The incident attracted national attention, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing that Evergreen &quot;found itself on the front line of the national discontent over race, speech and political disagreement&quot; and that the national exposure led &quot;right-leaning websites to [heap derision] on their newest college target&quot;.

In late May 2017, student protesters disrupted the campus and called for a number of changes to the college. Protesters occupied the office of Evergreen’s President George Bridges, without permission; exits to the campus library were blocked with furniture. Weinstein was told by campus police that it was not safe for him to be on campus, which caused Weinstein to hold his biology class in a public park. Weinstein and his wife, professor Heather Heying, later resigned and each received $250,000 in a settlement with the university, after having sued for $3.8 million for failing to &quot;protect its employees from repeated provocative and corrosive verbal and written hostility based on race, as well as threats of physical violence&quot;.

A June 1 direct threat to campus safety led to an evacuation and two-day closure of the campus. According to campus police, protesters with sticks and bats caused approximately $10,000 in damage to the campus and forced closure of the school for an additional day. Two weeks later, a June 15 protest on campus by the far-right group Patriot Prayer led to the campus being closed early. The following day, Evergreen&#x27;s 2017 commencement ceremony was also moved off-campus because of safety concerns. Through the spring and summer, African American students reported receiving harassing and threatening messages. An African American staff member and faculty member both resigned before the end of the year claiming escalating online attacks against them.

A report from the college suggested protests may adversely affect Evergreen&#x27;s enrollment, which has been declining over the last decade. In the immediate aftermath enrollments fell, with the November 2018 head count dropping to 3,327 students, down from 3,881 students in 2017. The college&#x27;s chief enrollment officer cited &quot;questions about our reputation&quot; as making efforts to attract students &quot;more difficult&quot; and the drop forced the college to cut its budget by 10% and increase student fees. Enrollment has since plummeted 41%, to 2,281 students in fall of 2020 and was expected to top at around 2,000 in 2021. In February 2022, the chief enrollment officer reported that total enrollment had fallen to 1,952 students. Enrollment began to recover from its low point with 14% year-over-year growth in 2022, and 23% growth in 2023, which brought the total enrollment to 2,225.

==Academics==
===Undergraduate===
Evergreen is unique in that undergraduate students select one 16-credit program for the entire quarter rather than multiple courses. Full-time programs will encompass a quarter&#x27;s worth of work in everything related to that program concentration, by up to three professors. There are no majors; students have the freedom to choose what program to enroll in each quarter for the entire duration of their undergraduate education, and are not required to follow a specific set of programs. Evergreen is on the &quot;quarter&quot; system, with programs lasting one, two, or three quarters. Three-quarter programs are generally September through June.

At the end of the program, the professor writes a one-page report (&quot;Evaluation&quot;) about the student&#x27;s activity in the class rather than awarding a letter grade, and has an end-of-program evaluation conference with each student. The professor also determines how many credits should be awarded to the student, and students can lose credit.

In order to be granted a Bachelor of Science degree, a student must complete 180 credits, 72 of which need to be in science, with 48 of those noted as upper division. This requirement can be satisfied by one year of upper-division science.

Evergreen offers an evening and weekend program.

===Graduate===
Unlike the undergraduate programs, the graduate programs require a student to take a certain rotation of courses.

Evergreen graduate studies consist of the following three programs:
* Master of Environmental Studies
* Master in Teaching
* Master of Public Administration

==Rankings==
Among regional schools offering some masters programs but few doctorates in the western United States, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in 2020 ranked Evergreen tied for 37th overall, second for &quot;most innovative&quot;, tied for fourth best for undergraduate teaching, tied for 14th best public school, and tied at 21st best school for veterans.

The Evergreen State College has an admission rate of 96%.

==Facilities==
===Daniel J. Evans Library===
The main library on The Evergreen State College campus is the Daniel J. Evans Library, named after the former governor who signed the legislation that founded Evergreen, and was also the school&#x27;s second president. The library is home to some 428,000 volumes and 750,000 print and media items overall. The library hosts a number of small viewing rooms and also maintains special collections of rare books, archival material, and government documents. The Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning Center (QuaSR), a tutoring center for the sciences, is located on the first floor of the library. The library is located in the Information Technology wing of the Daniel J. Evans Library Building. This wing is also the home for Media Services and a large Academic Computing center.

===Environmental reserve and beach===
The Evergreen State College has of land that is mostly second growth forest. The entire campus serves as a natural laboratory for scientific field research and provides inspiration for creative work. Throughout the forest there are multiple trails leading to a variety of locations throughout the reserve and to Evergreen Beach. The coastal habitat is characterized by steep bluffs, gravelly beaches with many washed-up logs, and the marine intertidal zone which extends up to out into Puget Sound&#x27;s Eld Inlet during low tides. Evergreen has approximately of untouched beach and of southern Puget Sound tidelands. Students use the beach and tidelands for scientific study and as a place to get away from their studies and relax. There are multiple trails leading to the beach and a small road that leads to the only building at the beach and a small boat ramp. The bluffs range from 15 to 60 feet (5 to 20 m) in height.

===Organic farm===

The Evergreen Organic Farm annual crop bed space comprises , slightly less than . The farm also produces apples and other perennial food crops, and tends to a flock of hens. Produce is sold to the Evergreen community through CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) shares, or from a farm-stand on Red Square every Tuesday and Thursday from 11am to 5pm during the growing season. Produce is sometimes sold to campus food services Aramark and the Flaming Eggplant Cafe. Excess produce is available to students in the interdisciplinary program, titled &quot;The Practice of Sustainable Agriculture&quot;.

Proceeds from the sale of the crops are used to finance farm projects, as well as purchase seeds and equipment. Two of the greenhouses, the cooler, compost shed, farm fencing and orchard are just a few projects made possible from farm sales. Another use for money generated on the farm is to fund student projects. Many of these projects are related to horticultural aspects of food crops.

The farm production area is divided into sections that are used to delineate cropping areas for specific types of crops. The farm practices a strict five year crop rotation. The rotating of crops creates plant diversity over time as opposed to plant diversity in space. The rotation has four general crop categories with each category occupying a given space for one growing season.

Crop rotation is just one method the farm uses to maintain diversity in the field. Other methods employed are the use of undersown ground covers and inter-cropping different types of vegetable crops. Creating diversity in the field is one of the cornerstones of sustainable agriculture. Diversity provides non-toxic, sustainable crop protection against plant diseases and insect pests.

The Evergreen Organic Farm hosts a large composting facility that composts all compostables from the campus. It also hosts a Biodiesel facility, a community garden, demeters garden, and a large farmhouse that was partially built by students.

===Public service centers===
The Evergreen State College is the home of the Longhouse Education and Cultural Center. The Longhouse exists to provide service and hospitality to students, the college, and surrounding Native communities. With a design based on the Northwest Indigenous Nations&#x27; philosophy of hospitality, its primary functions are to provide a gathering place for hosting cultural ceremonies, classes, conferences, performances, art exhibits and community events. The Longhouse provides the opportunity to build a bridge of understanding between the regions&#x27; tribes and visitors of all cultures. The public service mission of the Longhouse is to promote indigenous arts and cultures through education, cultural preservation, and economic development.

It is also the administrative home for the Washington State Institute for Public Policy. The institute&#x27;s mission is to carry out practical, non-partisan research—at legislative direction—on issues of importance to Washington State. The institute conducts research using its own policy analysts and economists, specialists from universities, and consultants. Institute staff work closely with legislators, legislative and state agency staff, and experts in the field to ensure that studies answer relevant policy questions.

Other notable public service centers on campus are:
* Washington Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education
* Center for Community-Based Learning and Action

==Athletics==
The Evergreen State College athletic teams are called the Geoducks. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Cascade Collegiate Conference (CCC) since the 1999–2000 academic year.

Evergreen competes in nine intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, track &amp; field and volleyball. Former sports include men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s crew.

===Mascot===
A geoduck is a clam native to the region.

===Soccer===
Former men&#x27;s soccer star Joey Gjertsen, who led the Geoducks to the 2004 NAIA National Quarterfinals, has gone on to have professional success with the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer. Shawn Medved previously had success in the MLS, playing for D.C. United and the San Jose Clash. Medved scored the tying goal in the 1996 MLS Cup as D.C. went on to the championship.

===Basketball===
Evergreen also had a strong run in men&#x27;s basketball during the first decade of the 21st century, winning the 2002 CCC Championship and reaching the NAIA National Tournament in 2002, 2009 and 2010. Forward Mike Parker from the &#x27;02 team has become one of the top professional players in Japan, and several other basketball players have gone on to professional careers overseas.

<doc id="318869" wikidata="Q974568" url="?curid=318869" title="Iceland spar">
<text>Iceland spar, formerly called Iceland crystal ( , ) and also called optical calcite, is a transparent variety of calcite, or crystallized calcium carbonate, originally brought from Iceland, and used in demonstrating the polarization of light.

== Formation and composition ==

Iceland spar is a colourless, transparent variety of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). It crystallizes in the trigonal system, typically forming rhombohedral crystals. It has a Mohs hardness of 3 and exhibits double refraction, splitting a ray of light into two rays that travel at different speeds and directions.

Iceland spar forms in sedimentary environments, mainly limestone and dolomite rocks, but it also forms in hydrothermal veins and evaporite deposits. It precipitates from solutions rich in calcium and carbonate ions, influenced by temperature, pressure, and impurities.

The most common crystal structure of Iceland spar is rhombohedral, but other structures, such as scalenohedral or prismatic, can form depending on formation conditions. Iceland spar is primarily found in Iceland but can occur in different parts of the world with suitable geological conditions.

== Characteristics and optical properties ==

Iceland spar is characterized by its large, readily cleavable crystals, easily divided into parallelepipeds. This feature makes it easily identifiable and workable. One of the most remarkable properties of Iceland spar is its birefringence, where the crystal&#x27;s refractive index differs for light of different polarizations. When a ray of unpolarized light passes through the crystal, it is divided into two rays of mutually perpendicular polarization directed at various angles. This double refraction causes objects seen through the crystal to appear doubled.

Iceland spar possesses several optical properties other than double refraction and birefringence. It is highly transparent to visible light, allowing light to pass through with minimal absorption or scattering, which is ideal for optical applications requiring clarity. Iceland spar can produce vivid colours when viewed under polarized light due to its birefringent nature. This effect is known as the &quot;Becke line&quot; and can be used to determine a mineral&#x27;s refractive index. Additionally, Iceland spar is optically active, meaning it can rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through it, a property resulting from its asymmetrical atomic arrangement. These optical properties contribute to the mineral&#x27;s scientific use and aesthetic appeal.

== Historical significance ==
Iceland spar holds historical importance in optics and the study of light. One of its most notable properties is its ability to exhibit double refraction. This phenomenon was first described by the Danish scientist Erasmus Bartholin in 1669, who observed it in a specimen of Iceland spar.

The study of double refraction in Iceland spar played a role in developing the wave theory of light. Scientists such as Christiaan Huygens, Isaac Newton, and Sir George Stokes studied this phenomenon and contributed to the understanding of light as a wave. Huygens, in particular, used double refraction to support his wave theory of light, in contrast to Newton&#x27;s corpuscular theory. Augustin-Jean Fresnel published a complete explanation of double refraction in light polarization in the 1820s.

The understanding of double refraction in Iceland spar also led to the development of polarized light microscopy, which is used in various scientific fields to study the properties of materials. Iceland spar has been used historically in optical instruments like polarizing microscopes and navigation equipment.

== Mining ==

Mines producing Iceland spar include many mines producing related calcite and aragonite. Iceland spar occurs in various locations worldwide, historically named after Iceland due to its abundance on the island. Other productive sources include China and the greater Sonoran Desert region, in Santa Eulalia, Chihuahua, Mexico, and New Mexico, United States. The clearest specimens, as well as the largest, have been from the Helgustaðir mine in Iceland.

Surveying tools and techniques are combined to reduce the risk and cost of exploration to identify deposits. Geological maps and remote sensing techniques, such as satellite imagery and aerial photography, are used for initial exploration and regional assessment to identify potential areas for further exploration. Geophysical surveys, including magnetometry, gravity surveys, and electromagnetic surveys, are then employed to detect anomalies indicating mineralization. Field mapping of surface geology and mineralogy also plays a role in identifying potential mineralization zones.

The mining process for Iceland spar varies based on the specific geological conditions of the deposit. Open-pit mining or quarrying is common for surface deposits. Once extracted, the calcite is processed to remove impurities, prepared for various applications, including optical instruments and jewelry, and used as a source of calcium carbonate in industries like construction and agriculture.

=== Environmental issues ===
Some potential environmental issues associated with Iceland spar mining include habitat destruction, water pollution, air pollution, soil degradation, and visual impact. Mining activities can destroy natural habitats, mainly if the mining site is located in ecologically sensitive areas, leading to the loss of biodiversity and disrupting local ecosystems. Water sources can be contaminated through the discharge of chemicals used in the extraction and processing of minerals, impacting aquatic life and water quality. Mining activities can also lead to soil erosion and degradation, mainly if proper land reclamation measures are not implemented after mining ceases. Open-pit mining operations can have a significant visual impact on the landscape, altering the natural scenery of an area. These measures may include erosion control, environmentally friendly mining techniques, and the reclamation of mined areas to restore them to a natural state.

=== Health concerns ===
Mining, including Iceland spar mining, poses various health risks to workers and nearby communities. Some key health concerns associated with mining activities include respiratory issues, noise-induced hearing loss, chemical exposure, musculoskeletal disorders, injuries and accidents, and mental health issues. Dust generated during mining operations can contain harmful particles, leading to respiratory problems. The high noise levels generated by mining activities can cause hearing loss over time if proper protective measures are not in place. Miners may also be exposed to harmful chemicals used in the extraction and processing of minerals, which can cause various health issues. The physical demands of mining work, such as heavy lifting and repetitive motions, can result in musculoskeletal disorders. Injuries and accidents are also common risks in mining, including falls, equipment-related incidents, and mine collapses. The demanding nature of mining work, along with long hours and isolation, can contribute to mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression. Mining companies must implement health and safety measures to mitigate these risks to protect workers and nearby communities, including personal protective equipment, dust control measures, and health and safety training. Regularly monitoring air quality, noise levels, and other potential hazards is essential to ensure a safe working environment.

== Uses ==
Iceland spar has been historically used in telecommunications due to its unique optical properties. One of its key features, birefringence, made it worthwhile in early optical technologies, such as developing optical instruments like polarizing microscopes and constructing optical rangefinders and gunsights.

While uncommon, Iceland spar has historically been used in navigation as a polarizing filter to determine the sun&#x27;s direction on overcast days. It has been speculated that the sunstone (, a different mineral from the gem-quality sunstone) mentioned in medieval Icelandic texts, such as Rauðúlfs þáttr, was Iceland spar, and that Vikings used its light-polarizing property to tell the direction of the sun on cloudy days for navigational purposes. The polarization of sunlight in the Arctic can be detected, and the direction of the sun identified to within a few degrees in both cloudy and twilight conditions using the sunstone and the naked eye. The process involves moving the stone across the visual field to reveal a yellow entoptic pattern on the fovea of the eye, probably Haidinger&#x27;s brush. The recovery of an Iceland spar sunstone from a ship of the Elizabethan era that sank in 1592 off Alderney suggests that this navigational technology may have persisted after the invention of the magnetic compass.

William Nicol (1770–1851) invented the first polarizing prism, using Iceland spar to create his Nicol prism.

=== Modern applications ===
Despite being historically significant, Iceland spar still holds an essential place in modern applications. Due to its optical properties, Iceland spar is still used in instruments like polarizing microscopes, lenses, and filters. Iceland spar is also used in optical instruments for geological and biological microscopy as its birefringence helps to reveal material structure. It is also a practical tool used in education and research to demonstrate optical principles. Though its applications are less widespread than in the past, Iceland spar continues to contribute to various scientific and technological endeavours.

As a type of calcite, Iceland spar can be used in construction as a building material in cement and concrete. Its high purity and brightness make it an ideal filler in paints and coatings. In metallurgy, calcite acts as a flux to lower the melting point of metals during smelting and refining. Additionally, it is used in agriculture as a soil conditioner and neutralizer to adjust soil pH levels and improve crop yields. Calcite also contributes to environmental remediation efforts, treating acidic water and soil by neutralizing acidity and removing heavy metals.

=== Geological significance ===
Due to Iceland spar typically forming in sedimentary environments, particularly limestone and dolomite rocks, its formation is closely tied to these carbonate rocks&#x27; deposition and diagenesis (compaction and cementation). Studying Iceland spar can provide valuable information about past environmental conditions, such as the presence of ancient seas and marine life, as carbonate rocks like limestone often form in marine environments. The presence of Iceland spar can also indicate the presence of hydrothermal activity, as calcite can form in hydrothermal veins.

== Conservation and protection ==
Due to their scientific and historical significance, conservation efforts related to Iceland spar primarily focus on preserving specimens and mining sites. One of the challenges in preserving Iceland spar specimens is the risk of damage during extraction, handling, and storage. Mining sites that yield high-quality Iceland spar specimens are also of interest for conservation. These sites may be designated protected areas to prevent overexploitation.

== Cultural impact ==

The Thomas Pynchon novel &quot;Against the Day&quot; uses the doubling effect of Iceland spar as a theme.

<doc id="318870" wikidata="Q264490" url="?curid=318870" title="Gianni Versace">
<text>Giovanni Maria &quot;Gianni&quot; Versace (; 2 December 1946 – 15 July 1997) was an Italian fashion designer, socialite and businessman. He was the founder of Versace, an international luxury-fashion house that produces accessories, fragrances, make-up, home furnishings and clothes. He also designed costumes for theatre and films. As a friend of Eric Clapton, Princess Diana, Whitney Houston, Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Madonna, Elton John, Tupac Shakur, Joan Collins and many other celebrities, he was one of the first designers to link fashion to the music world. He and his partner Antonio D&#x27;Amico were regulars on the international party scene. The place where he was born and raised, Reggio di Calabria, greatly influenced his career.

On 15 July 1997, he was murdered outside his Miami Beach mansion, Casa Casuarina, by serial killer Andrew Cunanan.

== Early life ==
Giovanni Maria Versace was born in the city of Reggio Calabria on 2 December 1946 and grew up with his elder brother Santo Versace and younger sister Donatella Versace, along with their father and dressmaker mother, Francesca. An older sister, Tina, died at age 12 because of an improperly treated tetanus infection.

Versace was strongly influenced by ancient Greek history, which dominates the historical landscape of his birthplace. He attended Liceo Classico Tommaso Campanella, where he studied Latin and ancient Greek, without completing the course. He was also influenced by Andy Warhol.

Versace began his apprenticeship at a young age at his mother&#x27;s sewing business, which employed up to a dozen seamstresses. He became interested in architecture before moving to Milan at the age of 26 to work in fashion design.

In 1973, he became the designer of &quot;Byblos&quot;, a successful Genny&#x27;s youthful line, and in 1977, he designed Complice, another, more experimental, line for Genny. A few years later, encouraged by his success, Versace presented his first signature collection for women at the Palazzo Della Permanente Art Museum of Milan. His first fashion show followed in September of the same year. His first boutique was opened in Milan&#x27;s Via della Spiga in 1978.

==Fashion empire==
After opening his Milan boutique in 1978, Versace quickly became a sensation on the international fashion scene. His designs employed vivid colors, bold prints and sexy cuts, which were a refreshing contrast to the prevailing taste for muted colors and simplicity. His aesthetic, which &quot;combined luxurious classicism with overt sexuality&quot;, attracted much criticism in addition to praise. He is quoted as saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in good taste&quot;, which was reflected in his &quot;brazen defiance of the rules of fashion&quot;. A saying referencing Versace&#x27;s rivalry with Giorgio Armani was: &quot;Armani dresses the wife, Versace dresses the mistress.&quot;

Gianni Versace often drew inspiration from historical periods like Classicism, Byzantium, the 18th century, and the 1920s and 1930s. His designs reimagined elements such as Ravenna&#x27;s mosaics and Roman drapery, incorporating them into contemporary fashion.

From 1978, Versace built the company with the support of his family, employing his sister Donatella as vice president and his brother Santo as president of the company. Donatella&#x27;s purview extended to creative oversight, where she acted as a key consultant to Versace. Gianni would also come to employ Donatella&#x27;s husband, Paul Beck, as menswear director.

Among Versace&#x27;s most famous innovations was his 1982 invention of a type of super-light chainmail called &#x27;Oroton&#x27;, which became a signature material in his outfits. His suits were inspired more by his experience in female tailoring, departing from masculine Savile Row models by crafting suits that accentuated the male form and &quot;insisted on men as sex objects&quot;.

Versace was very proud of his southern Italian heritage and infused his designs with motifs inspired by historical fashion and art movements, especially Graeco-Roman art. This is evident in the company&#x27;s logo, the Medusa Head, and recurring motifs such as the Greek key. He also allowed his love for contemporary art to inspire his work, creating graphic prints based on the art of Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol.

Versace’s work was deeply influenced by art, from Gustav Klimt, Robert Delaunay, and Alexander Calder to Andy Warhol and Jim Dine. He often collaborated with contemporary artists and used their works as motifs in his designs. For example, one of his collections featured dresses inspired by Warhol&#x27;s portraits of Marilyn Monroe and James Dean. Versace also drew inspiration from Pablo Picasso, and his appreciation for the artist extended beyond his fashion creations. He was an avid art collector and owned several works by Picasso. Following his death, 25 pieces from his personal Picasso collection were auctioned, showcasing his deep connection to the artist.

In 1982, Versace expanded the business into jewelry and housewares, designing luxury furnishings, china and textiles for the home. He was unusual in retaining complete creative control over all aspects of his company. In 1984 and &#x27;85, he contributed a specially appointed Gianni Versace Edition to the Mark VII line of American luxury automaker Lincoln. In 1989, the firm expanded into &quot;haute couture&quot; with the launch of Atelier Versace. Versace became known for employing celebrities in his marketing campaigns and seating them in the front rows of his fashion shows, the first to do so. He is also credited with inventing the supermodel vogue of the 1990s, by discovering and featuring major supermodels such as Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington and Linda Evangelista, all of whom he featured both on the runway and in advertisement campaigns.
At the time of his death, Versace&#x27;s empire was valued at $807 million and included 130 boutiques across the world.

===Stage designs===
Throughout his career, Versace was a prolific costume designer for stage productions and performing artists. He stated, &quot;for me the theatre is liberation&quot;, and his designs were well served by his penchant for bold colors, drapery, embellishment, and an encyclopedic knowledge of fashion history. He was a collaborator at the La Scala Theatre Ballet in Milan and designed the costumes for the Strauss ballet &quot;Josephslegende&quot; in 1982 and Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;. He also designed the costumes for five Béjart Ballet productions: &quot;Dionysos&quot; (1984), &quot;Leda and the Swan&quot; (1987), &quot;Malraux ou la Métamorphoses des Dieux&quot; (1986), &quot;Chaka Zulu&quot; (1989) and the &quot;Ballet du XXme Siècle&quot;. In 1990, he designed the costumes for the San Francisco Opera&#x27;s production of &quot;Capriccio&quot;. Versace designed Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney on their 1983 &quot;Say Say Say&quot; video and Elton John&#x27;s costumes for his The One Tour.

== Personal life ==
Versace met his partner Antonio D&#x27;Amico, a model, in 1982. Their relationship lasted until Versace&#x27;s murder. During this time, Versace was diagnosed with ear cancer. He was declared cancer free six months before he was murdered.

Versace was known for adoration towards his nieces and nephews: Santo&#x27;s two children, Francesca and Antonio, and Donatella&#x27;s two children, Allegra and Daniel.

== Death ==

On the morning of 15 July 1997, Versace exited his mansion and walked on Ocean Drive to retrieve his morning magazines. Usually, Versace would have an assistant walk from his home to the nearby News Cafe to get his magazines, but on this occasion he decided to go himself. Versace had returned and was climbing the steps of his Miami Beach mansion when a man dressed in a gray T-shirt, black shorts, a white hat, and carrying a backpack shot him in the head at point-blank range with a .40 caliber Taurus PT100. Versace was pronounced dead at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, at 9:21 a.m. He was 50 years old at the time of his death. Versace&#x27;s murder was witnessed by his former UK senior stylist, Dean Aslett, who was on vacation in South Beach, Miami, and had partied with Versace a few days prior.

Versace was the last victim of Andrew Cunanan, a serial killer who had earlier murdered four other men (including real estate developer Lee Miglin). Cunanan died by suicide on a houseboat eight days after Versace&#x27;s murder.

Cunanan was obsessed with the designer and often bragged about his close &quot;friendship&quot; with Versace, although this was symptomatic of Cunanan&#x27;s delusions of grandeur: he often falsely claimed to have met celebrities. However, FBI agents firmly believe that Versace and Cunanan had previously met in San Francisco, although what their relationship entailed is still a mystery. Maureen Orth published a 2008 article in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; reporting that Cunanan and Versace had met briefly at a San Francisco nightclub in 1990 (according to several eyewitness claims) and that they could have interacted on further occasions because both were involved in sex-for-hire circles in Miami and San Francisco. However, Versace&#x27;s family has always steadfastly denied that the two ever met. Police have said that they do not know why Versace was killed. &quot;I don&#x27;t know that we are ever going to know the answers&quot;, said Miami Beach Police Chief Richard Barreto.

=== Memorial ===
Versace&#x27;s body was cremated and his ashes returned to the family&#x27;s estate near Cernobbio and buried in the family vault at Moltrasio cemetery near Lake Como. Versace&#x27;s funeral liturgy, held at Milan Cathedral, was attended by over 2,000 people, including Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, Naomi Campbell, Elton John, and Diana, Princess of Wales, who was killed in a car accident a little over a month later.

== Legacy ==
In September 1997, the estate announced that Versace&#x27;s brother, Santo, would serve as the new CEO of Gianni Versace S.p.A. while Versace&#x27;s sister, Donatella, would become the new head of design.

In his will, Versace left 50% of his fashion empire to his niece, Allegra Versace. She and her younger brother, Daniel, inherited Versace&#x27;s rare artwork collection. Allegra inherited her stake, worth approximately $500 million, when she turned 18 in 2004.

<doc id="318871" wikidata="Q18864" url="?curid=318871" title="Bar-tailed godwit">
<text>The bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica) is a large and strongly migratory wader in the family Scolopacidae, which feeds on bristle-worms and shellfish on coastal mudflats and estuaries. It has distinctive red breeding plumage, long legs, and a long upturned bill. Bar-tailed godwits breed on Arctic coasts and tundra from Scandinavia to Alaska, and overwinter on coasts in temperate and tropical regions of Australia and New Zealand. The migration of the subspecies &quot;Limosa lapponica baueri&quot; across the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to New Zealand is the longest known non-stop flight of any bird, and also the longest journey without pausing to feed by any animal. The round-trip migration for this subspecies is over .

==Taxonomy==
The bar-tailed godwit was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Scolopax limosa&quot;. It is now placed with three other godwits in the genus &quot;Limosa&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The genus name &quot;Limosa&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;muddy&quot;, from &quot;limus&quot;, &quot;mud&quot;, referring to its preferred habitat. The specific name&quot; lapponica&quot; refers to Lapland.

The English term &quot;godwit&quot; was first recorded in about 1416–17 and may be an imitation of the bird&#x27;s call, or be derived from the Old English &quot;god whit&quot;, meaning &quot;good creature&quot;, perhaps referring to its eating qualities. Its English name is taken from the black-and-white barred tail and upper tail coverts in this species.

Four subspecies are recognised:
*&quot;L. l. lapponica&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – breeds from northern Scandinavia east to the Yamal Peninsula; winters western coasts of Europe and Africa from the British Isles and the Netherlands south to South Africa, and also around the Persian Gulf. Smallest subspecies, males up to , females to 
* &quot;L. l. yamalensis&quot; Bom et al. 2021 – breeds in northwest Siberia including the Yamal Peninsula and the lower Ob River valley; winters in Oman east to west India, and probably the coast of east Africa, perhaps south to South Africa
*&quot;L. l. taymyrensis&quot; Engelmoer &amp; Roselaar, 1998 – breeds in central north Siberia from the lower Yenisei River valley east to the lower Anabar River valley; winters on the coast of west Africa
*&quot;L. l. menzbieri&quot; – Portenko, 1936 – breeds northeastern Asia from the Anabar River east to the Kolyma River delta; winters in southeast Asia and northwest Australia
*&quot;L. l. baueri&quot; – Naumann, 1836 – breeds in northeast Siberia to north and west Alaska; winters in China and Australasia. Largest subspecies. (includes &quot;L. l. anadyrensis&quot;) Population is less than 150,000 birds where 75000 of them occur in New Zealand (McCaffery and Gill, 2001).

==Description==
The bar-tailed godwit is a relatively short-legged species of godwit. The bill-to-tail length is , with a wingspan of . Males average smaller than females but with much overlap; males weigh , while females weigh ; there is also some regional variation in size (see subspecies, below). The adult has blue-grey legs and a long, tapering, slightly upturned bi-coloured bill: pink at the base and black towards the tip. The neck, breast and belly are unbroken brick red in breeding plumage, and dark brown above. Females breeding plumage is much duller than males, with a chestnut to cinnamon belly. Breeding plumage is not fully apparent until the third year, and there are three distinguishable age classes; during their first migration north, immature males are noticeably paler in colour than more mature males. Non-breeding birds seen in the Southern Hemisphere are plain grey-brown with darker feather centres, giving them a striped look, and are whitish underneath. Juveniles are similar to non-breeding adults but more buff overall with streaked plumages on flanks and breast.

Alaska-breeding bar-tailed godwits show an increase in body size from north to south, but this trend is not apparent in their non-breeding grounds in New Zealand; birds of different sizes mix freely.

&quot;Limosa lapponica&quot; is distinguished from the black-tailed godwit (&quot;Limosa limosa&quot;) by its black-and-white horizontally-barred (rather than wholly black) tail, and lack of white wing bars. The most similar species is the Asiatic dowitcher (&quot;Limnodromus semipalmatus&quot;).

==Distribution and migration==

It was evident for some time that the migrating birds can fly distances up to 5000 km non stop. All bar-tailed godwits spend the Northern Hemisphere summer in the Arctic, where they breed, and make a long-distance migration south in winter to more temperate areas. &quot;L. l. lapponica&quot; make the shortest migration, some only as far as the North Sea, while others travel as far as India. Bar-tailed godwits nesting in Alaska (&quot;L. l. baueri&quot;) travel all the way to Australia and New Zealand. They undertake the longest non-stop migrations of any bird, and to fuel they carry the greatest fat loads of any migratory bird so far studied, reducing the size of their digestive organs to do so.

&quot;L. l. bauri&quot; breeds in Alaska and spends the non-breeding season in eastern Australia and New Zealand. &quot;L. l. menzbieri&quot; breeds in Siberia and migrates to northern and western Australia. Birds breeding in Siberia follow the coast of Asia northwards and southwards, but those breeding in Alaska migrate directly across the Pacific to Australasia away. To track the return journey, seven birds in New Zealand were tagged with surgically implanted transmitters and tracked by satellite to the Yellow Sea in China, a distance of ; the actual track flown by one bird was , taking nine days. At least three other bar-tailed godwits also appear to have reached the Yellow Sea after non-stop flights from New Zealand.
One specific female of the flock, nicknamed &quot;E7&quot;, flew onward from China to Alaska and stayed there for the breeding season. Then in August 2007 she departed on an eight-day non-stop flight from western Alaska to the Piako River near Thames, New Zealand, setting a new known flight record of . This &quot;L. l. bauri&quot; female made a 174-day round-trip journey of with 20 days of flying. In 2021, a male bar-tailed godwit, 4BBRW, set a new record for non-stop migratory flight with an 8,100 mile (approximately 13035 km) flight from Alaska, USA to New South Wales, Australia. The same individual held a previous record in 2020. In 2022, a godwit numbered 234684 left Alaska on 13 October and flew non-stop to Tasmania, the first time a tagged bird has flown this route. It flew a minimum of in 11 days 1 hour: a record non-stop distance.

To fuel such long journeys, &quot;L. l. baueri&quot; birds in New Zealand deposit much more fat for their body size than other subspecies, allowing them to fly to . Both Australasian subspecies head north to their breeding grounds along the coast of Asia to the Yalu Jiang coastal wetland in the north Yellow Sea, the most important staging grounds for godwits and great knots (&quot;Calidris tenuirostris)&quot; in their northern migration. &quot;L. l. baueri&quot; birds rested for about 41 days before continuing approximately on to Alaska. &quot;L. l. menzbieri&quot; spent on average 38 days in the Yellow Sea region and flew an additional to high Arctic Russia.

Birds will often depart early from New Zealand if there are favourable winds; they seem to be able to predict weather patterns that will assist them on the entire migration route. Birds that had nested in southern Alaska were larger and departed New Zealand earliest; this pattern was repeated six months later, with birds departing Alaska in the same order they arrived, and over the same span of days. Birds in southern New Zealand departed on average 9–11 days earlier than birds in more northern sites. Godwits arrive at the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in Alaska in two waves; local breeders in early May, and larger flocks in the third week of May en route to breeding grounds further north.
==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
The bar-tailed godwit is a non-breeding migrant in Australia and New Zealand. Birds first depart for their northern hemisphere breeding sites at age 2–4. Breeding take place each year in Scandinavia, northern Asia, and Alaska. The nest is a shallow cup in moss sometimes lined with vegetation. Clutch size is from 2 to 5, averaging four. Both sexes share incubation of the eggs for 20 to 21 days, the male during the day and the female at night. The young fledge when they are around 28 days old. They first breed when aged 2 years. The earliest clutch may start by mid-May on coastal Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. There are never 2 broods at once but it may replace the first clutch. The nest site is variable in selection where there is a slighly elevated ridge drier than surrounding vegetation. The site is frequently well concealed by standing vegetation and placed near or between tussocks. The construction of the nest is conducted by both parents which lining is added to the nest during egg laying. The eggs shape are pointed oval to pyriform and subpyriform to ovate pyriform and usually the latter eggs are elongate ovate.

===Food and feeding===

Their main source of food in wetlands is bristle-worms (up to 70%), supplemented by small bivalves and crustaceans. In wet pastures, bar-tailed godwits eat invertebrates. In a major staging site in the northern Yellow Sea, they continue to hunt polychaetes, but most of their food intake is the bivalve mollusc &quot;Potamocorbula laevis&quot;, which they generally swallow whole. The sexual dimorphism also leads to differences in foraging behaviour which enables more effective exploitation.

Male bar-tailed godwits are smaller than females and have shorter bills. In a study at the Manawatū Estuary, shorter-billed birds (males) fed mostly on small surface prey like &quot;Potamopyrgus&quot; snails, half being snail specialists, whereas females consumed more deeply-buried prey such as worms; the birds also displayed some individual food preferences.

They are known to forage actively in the day and night. They will pick items on the surface while walking or probes for items in matted vegetation by inserting and twisting bills. In Europe, the females tend to feed in deeper water than males. Males that feed in deeper water are less successful than males that feed in the tide line. Meanwhile, females are successful at both locations. Birds that prey in flocks have higher prey capture than birds that prey alone. The individuals also capture fewer prey when there is drop in ambient temperature that slows the activity of prey. The degree of feeding activity depends on the tide, weather, season and the behaviour exhibited by the prey. In New Zealand, female &quot;L. l. baueri&quot; has a probe rate of 26.5 probes per 4 minutes period which is 1.6 times higher than that of males but the feeding success is observed to be similar in both sexes. The tapping technique is seen to be more useful in males than the females.

=== Sexual and antagonistic behaviour ===
During breeding season, shore birds such as bar-tailed godwit will exhibit conspicuous acts such as song flight, courtship, copulation and antagonistic behaviour. They can produce 9 different vocalizations with increasing and decreasing frequency which is mostly are a repetition of basic tonal element of 0.15-0.2s. Some vocalizations have multiple functions and some calls is used in a same context which is commonly shown in other shorebirds. The most common song-flight they have done is the ceremonial flights. ceremonial flights are performed disproportionately by the males and the function is mainly heterosexual. The flight was not found to induce ceremonial flight in neighboring males. There are 4 stages in ceremonial flights: (1) ascent, (2) limping flight, (3) gliding, and (4) descent to attract the females.

There are 3 categories in ceremonial flights: (A) A straight line, (B) performing 1 or more circles, (C) wide circles. The ceremonial flight is also known to be similar to Black-tailed godwit. They lack the flight that corresponds to the tumbling flight and the limping flight is not so erratic as in Black-tailed Godwit. The main purpose of this flight is to announce to the females that they are not mated yet. Their territorial defence behaviour is most likely limited to male-to-male aggression on the ground and other Limosa species also do not show high level territoriality. Aggressive reaction distance is usually less than 2 m. The bar-tailed godwit does not exhibit the &quot;tumbling flight&quot; that the Black-tailed Godwit shows after its ascending phase, and its limping flight is much more ordered and less chaotic than that of the Black-tailed Godwit. The highly conspicuous limping flight with song in the ceremonial flight is potentially to give signaling value are pivoting take off during ascent, diving and breaking with primaries during descent and wings-high after landing. It is the most highly possible for long-distance signalling to be aimed only to a nearby mate.

Another common flight that occurs in this species is the pursuit flight which is initiated by a paired female. The males will follow closely behind. Sometimes, another male can join in if they are not mated yet. The aggressive and courtship behaviour should not be similar as the aggressive behaviour. During courtship, they tend to point their bill slightly upwards along with raising their tails while during aggression, they will point the bill downwards in a normal tail posture. It is common to perform tail-raising in this family. Nest-scraping behaviour is also shown by the ruffling of the back-feathers.

=== Migration behaviour ===
Although the immediate destinations and flight lengths of this species is unclear, potential destinations include the Yellow Sea, China, and Korea (39°45′N, 124°30′E; 9,600 km) from the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia (17°38′S, 140°06′E; 3,800 km). Waders are known to use mostly fat to fuel their long flights that sometimes undertake 10,000 km to 29,000 km and also catabolizing lean tissue from their organs. The sexual dimorphism is also thought to contribute to them having different fuel deposition. The typical shorebird fat loads are 35%-40% of their body mass. Juvenile males migrating from South Alaska have the highest fat load, but we cannot conclude that for all godwits migrating from the same breeding ground since juveniles are still growing and have smaller body sizes than adults. The female godwits are found to be the heaviest due to their body size being larger than males, and the fat content was also found to be high, from 197-280g.

In the size comparison of the subspecies with &quot;L. l. taymyrensis&quot; which is comparatively smaller than subspecies &quot;L. l. baueri&quot;. The latter is known to deposit 75-85g more fat for their size. In general, larger godwits have greater flight costs, which accounts for the difference in travel expenses. The smaller subspecies with would exhibit lower travel cost with and without wind assistance. The subspecies &quot;L. l. baueri&quot; is predicted with travel distance further than &quot;L. l. taymyrensis&quot; ranged from 8,200 to 8,600 km with wind assistance, and 6,000 to 6,300 km with no wind assistance. Those flight lengths are sufficient to allow the individuals from northern New Zealand potentially to Japan or South Korea. New Zealand godwits would need to have wind assistance comparable to &quot;L. l. taymyrensis&quot;, the European birds, or the European bird would need to retain significant amounts of fat after migration in order for the greater flight ranges to be feasible. This species is able to &quot;ride&quot; high-pressure systems over the Tasman Sea during the first part of their migration from New Zealand, and so they are most likely to receive wind assistance to Australia.

Sometimes during Southward migration, they will make some stopovers in different staging sites if their destinations are likely to be father north than Australia or Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya. These massive flights might involve extensive fueling periods before and during migration. This calls for the utilization of a flight&#x27;s network of locations. They will rest, moult and refuel themselves for the remaining distance. &quot;L. l. baueri&quot; are highly conservative in their use of staging sites to refuel and most of them just stopped in one or two countries when migrating northwards. During southwards migration, some of them will stop in a few islands in the Southwest Pacific Ocean. These altered routes are suggested to be adaptive reactions to the risks of continuing to fly over open oceans when the wind is unfavourable. This migration strategy of Australasian bar-tailed godwits is exemplify by their exceptional travels, which cross hemispheres and encompass 10,000 km, and their reliance on a few number of refueling sites. These extreme flights are also dependent on the presence and productivity of these staging sites.

==Status==
The status of the bar-tailed godwit is Near Threatened, and the population is declining. Fewer birds have been using East African estuaries since 1979, and there has been a steady decline in numbers around the Kola Peninsula, Siberia, since 1930. The global population is estimated to number 1,099,000–1,149,000 individuals.

Both &quot;L. l. bauri&quot; and &quot;L. l. menzbieri&quot; adult survival rates decreased between 2005 and 2012, probably because of the loss of intertidal staging areas in the Yellow Sea. The construction of seawalls and the reclamation of mudflats have led to a critical reduction in food supplies for migrating birds, particularly subspecies like &quot;L. l. menzbieri&quot; that rely on the Yalu Jiang estuary on both their northward and southward migrations. Numbers of &quot;L. l. baueri&quot; have declined in New Zealand from over 100,000 in the late 1980s to 67,500 in 2018. Meanwhile, a wader census conducted Bird New Zealand in 1983 and they found that the number of bar-tailed godwits in New Zealand as well has declined over the last 35 years which drops from 101,000 in 1983–1993 to 78,000 in 2005–2019. The decline in numbers of bar-tailed godwits is probably associated with habitat loss and degradation near Yellow Sea. They are quite sensitive and easily spooked so it prevents them from disturbance at high tide roosts which leads to stress since they could not rest. We need to contribute to their conservation measures to help maintain their population by restricting human access, creating protected zones and keeping safe distance from bar-tailed godwits. In 2024, &quot;L. l. baueri&quot; and &quot;L. l. menzbieri&quot; were listed as Endangered under the Australian EPBC Act.

The bar-tailed godwit is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. In New Zealand the species is protected under the 1953 Wildlife Act.

<doc id="318873" wikidata="Q977422" url="?curid=318873" title="Chocolate Hills">
<text>The Chocolate Hills (, , or ) are a geological formation in the Philippine province of Bohol. There is a minimum of 1,260 hills and possibly up to 1,776, spread over an area of more than . They are covered in green grass that turns a chocolate-brown during the dry season, hence the name.

The Chocolate Hills are featured on the provincial flag and seal to symbolize the abundance of natural attractions in the province. The site is on the Philippine Tourism Authority&#x27;s list of tourist destinations in the Philippines, and it has been declared the country&#x27;s third national geological monument, as well as being proposed for inclusion in UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage List.

==Description==
The Chocolate Hills form a rolling terrain of haycock-shaped hills—mounds of a generally conical and almost symmetrical shape. With an estimated 1,268 to 1,776 individual mounds, these dome-shaped hills are actually made of grass-covered limestone. The domes vary in size from high, with the largest being in height. One of Bohol&#x27;s best-known tourist attractions, these unique hills are scattered by the hundreds throughout the towns of Carmen, Batuan, and Sagbayan.

===Vegetation===
During the dry season, the grass-covered hills dry up and turn chocolate-brown. The vegetation is dominated by grass species such as &quot;Imperata cylindrica&quot; and &quot;Saccharum spontaneum&quot;. Several &quot;Compositae&quot; and ferns also grow on them. In between the hills, the flatlands are cultivated with rice and other cash crops. However, the natural vegetation on the Chocolate Hills is threatened by quarrying activities.

===Origin===

The Chocolate Hills are conical karst that consist of Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene, thin to medium-bedded, sandy to rubbly marine limestone. They contain abundant fossils of shallow marine foraminifera, coral, mollusks, and algae. These conical hills are geomorphological features called cockpit karst, which were created by a combination of the dissolution of limestone by rainfall, surface water, and groundwater, and their subaerial erosion by streams after they had been uplifted above sea level and fractured by tectonic processes. The hills are separated by flat plains and contain numerous caves and springs.

The origin of the conical karst of the Chocolate Hills is described on the bronze plaque at the viewing deck in Carmen. This plaque states that they are eroded formations of a type of marine limestone that sits on top of hardened clay.

Self-published, popular web pages present a variety of fanciful and less credible explanations about how these hills formed. They include sub-oceanic volcanism; limestone-covered blocks created by the destruction of an active volcano in a cataclysmic eruption; and tidal movements. The lack of any exposed or associated volcanic rocks in the Chocolate Hills refutes the popular theories involving volcanic eruptions, however. The theories involving either a sudden, massive geologic shift, coral reefs being erupted from the sea, or tidal movements lack any corroborating evidence or support among geologists.

==Tourism==
Two of the hills have been developed into tourist resorts. The main viewing point of the Chocolate Hills is the government-owned Chocolate Hills Complex in Carmen, about from the capital of Tagbilaran. The other main point to view the Chocolate Hills is at Sagbayan Peak, in Sagbayan, away from the complex, also in Carmen.

==Protection==
===Legislation===
The National Committee on Geological Sciences declared the Chocolate Hills of Bohol a National Geological Monument on June 18, 1988, in recognition of its special characteristics, scientific importance, uniqueness, and high scenic value. As such, this added the Chocolate Hills to the country&#x27;s protected areas. More protection was provided by &quot;Proclamation No. 1037&quot;, signed by President Fidel V. Ramos on July 1, 1997, which established the Chocolate Hills and the areas within, around, and surrounding them located in the municipalities of Carmen, Batuan, Sagbayan, Bilar, Valencia, and Sierra Bullones as a natural monument to protect and maintain its natural beauty and to provide restraining mechanisms for inappropriate exploitation. They are thus covered under the National Integrated Protected Areas System, with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) as the lead implementing agency for its protection.

Land-use conflict prompted President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to sign an amendment to &quot;Proclamation 468&quot; on September 26, 1994, declaring the land around or in between the Chocolate Hills as no longer part of the national monument during the Sandugo celebration on July 17, 2002. This amendment allowed the tracts of land surrounding and within the famous tourist spot to be developed by the provincial government and other entities that have control over the area. Further, the amended proclamation ensured that the areas that have to be preserved are preserved, while those that could be developed would be excluded from the national monument area and classified as and disposable by the government. The president initially decided on the issue during the joint meeting of the Regional Development Council–Regional Peace and Order Council of Region VII, which was conducted at the Bohol Tropics Resort.

Bills have been filed aiming to strengthen protection of the hills. On July 6, 2004, the Philippine House of Representatives introduced &quot;House Bill No. 01147&quot;, subtitled &quot;an act declaring the Chocolate Hills as national patrimony and geological monuments, penalizing their plunder, destruction or defacement, and for other purposes&quot;. The bill was authored by Congressman Eladio &quot;Boy&quot; Jala and co-authored by congressmen Roilo Golez and Edgar Chatto. The bill has not been passed into law.

On May 16, 2006, the DENR submitted the Chocolate Hills to UNESCO for inclusion as a World Heritage Site on the list of natural monuments, because of its outstanding universal value.

The Chocolate Hills was declared a national park under &quot;Republic Act No. 11038 (Expanded National Integrated Protected Areas System Act of 2018)&quot;, signed by President Rodrigo Duterte in July 2018.

===Issues===
Balancing protection, resource utilization, and tourism are the challenges faced by the Chocolate Hills. Before they were designated national geological monuments, some of the hills (about ) were classified as alienable and disposable or as private lands, such that they were titled to local residents. The declaration consequently caused some social unrest, resulting in almost simultaneous civil uprising, led by the New People&#x27;s Army (generally described as Maoist guerrillas) establishing a new front, known as the Chocolate Hills Command. To some farmers, the proclamation is a government scheme that suppresses their right to own lands. As such, conflicts between the New People&#x27;s Army group and government military forces escalated, culminating in two major engagements.

Being alienable and disposable lands, the Chocolate Hills are seen as quarrying assets and a source of income for small-scale miners as well as quarry materials for the province&#x27;s construction projects. The challenge has been how national and local officials can harmonize the current needs of small-scale miners, the construction sector, and the tourism industry with the preservation of the Chocolate Hills. Even with their protected status, mining permits continue to be granted by DENR and local government units. Hence, mining and quarrying are still taking place. Because of this, the provincial government of Bohol has requested jurisdiction over the Chocolate Hills from the DENR. Meanwhile, the provincial government has suggested that the legislation defining the Natural Monument should be changed, which would require that the proclamation be redrafted and ratified by both the Philippine House and Senate. This is a cumbersome and costly process, on which no progress has been made to date. Future development and investment challenges within the Chocolate Hills area include: obtaining the national government&#x27;s sanction for the project; persuading landowners to sell; convincing the Protected Areas Management Board, which has jurisdiction over the hills, not to use its veto power over any investment requiring physical facilities.

A resort was built between the Chocolate Hills, sparking controversy in March 2024. In response, Congress launched inquiries, which led to the resort being built despite the hills&#x27; protected status and a subsequent six-month suspension of 68 local officials, including Bohol governor Erico Aristotle Aumentado.

==Disasters==
===2013 Bohol earthquake===
One of the largest earthquakes to hit Bohol struck the island at 8:12 a.m. (PHT) on October 15, 2013. The center of the M7.2 earthquake was near Sagbayan, Bohol. Due to the earthquake, a portion of one of the hills gave way, and the Chocolate Hills&#x27; viewing deck was destroyed.

In October 2018, the Provincial Development Council&#x27;s Executive Committee proposed in funding for the repair work and restored the viewing deck and surrounding facilities, including pathways, parking space, water features, trellis, stairs, ramps, food court, museum, activity center, lamp posts, signage, and landscaping.

===Grass fires===
On April 30, 2024, two of the hills were burned in a grass fire in Carmen after Bohol&#x27;s heat index reached .

==Formation myths==
The Chocolate Hills have inspired many geomyths, most of which revolve around their formation and figures of giants.

===Battle between two giants===
There were once two giants, dwelling in the northern and southern edges of the island, respectively. During a rainy day, when the ground became muddy, a hostile encounter between them prompted worried people to vacate to other parts of the island, and the giant from the north instigated a mud-throwing fight. After a while, the battle climaxed into a fistfight between the giants and ended with both knocking each other to the ground and dying. What was left of the thrown mud that landed on the ground became the hills.

===Romance of Arogo and Aloya===
A young and powerful giant named Arogo once fell in love with a human named Aloya, and they lived together for some time, until Aloya became ill and died. Arogo mourned, and his tears fell to the ground, forming mounds that would later become the hills.

===Mud cakes===
The flatlands of Carmen were once a playground for giant children. One day, they initiated a contest on who could bake the most mud cakes, gathering mud and &quot;baking&quot; them under coconut half-shells laid flat on the ground. Before the contest could end, however, the children were called home. After a while, they returned to the area to witness their finished creations and left them undisturbed out of admiration—the baked cakes thus became the hills.

==Karst hill ranges outside of Bohol==
Outside of Bohol, similar karst hill ranges are found throughout the Philippines, such as in the interiors of Siquijor and Cebu, southestern Leyte, along the western coast of Guimaras, the northwestern tip of Masbate, and in the Bicol region, comprising southern Albay and western Sorsogon.

<text>The black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa) is a large, long-legged, long-billed shorebird first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It is a member of the godwit genus, &quot;Limosa&quot;. There are four subspecies, all with orange head, neck and chest in breeding plumage and dull grey-brown winter coloration, and distinctive black and white wingbar at all times.

Its breeding range stretches from Iceland through Europe and areas of central Asia. Black-tailed godwits spend (the northern hemisphere) winter in areas as diverse as the Indian subcontinent, Australia, New Zealand, western Europe and west Africa. The species breeds in fens, lake edges, damp meadows, moorlands and bogs and uses estuaries, swamps and floods in (the northern hemisphere) winter; it is more likely to be found inland and on freshwater than the similar bar-tailed godwit. The world population is estimated to be 634,000 to 805,000 birds and is classified as Near Threatened. The black-tailed godwit is the national bird of the Netherlands.

== Taxonomy ==
The black-tailed godwit was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Scolopax limosa&quot;. It is now placed with three other godwits in the genus &quot;Limosa&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The name &quot;Limosa&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;muddy&quot;, from &quot;limus&quot;, &quot;mud&quot;. The English name &quot;godwit&quot; was first recorded in about 1416–17 and is believed to imitate the bird&#x27;s call.

Four subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;L. l. islandica&quot; – : the Icelandic black-tailed godwit, which breeds mostly in Iceland, but also on the Faeroe Islands, the Shetland and the Lofoten Islands. It has a shorter bill, shorter legs and more rufous coloration extending onto the belly, compared to &quot;limosa&quot;.
* &quot;L. l. limosa&quot; – : the European black-tailed godwit, which breeds from western and central Europe to central Asia and Asiatic Russia, as far east as the Yenisei River. Its head, neck and chest are pale orange.
* &quot;L. l. melanuroides&quot; – : the Asian black-tailed godwit, which breeds in Mongolia, northern China, Siberia and Far Eastern Russia. Its plumage is similar to &quot;islandica&quot;, but the bird is distinctly smaller.
* &quot;L. l. bohaii&quot; – : assumed to breed in Russian Far East; non-breeding in northeast China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Peninsular Malaysia

== Description ==

The black-tailed godwit is a large wader with long bill ( long), neck and legs. During the breeding season, the bill has a yellowish or orange-pink base and dark tip; the base is pink in winter. The legs are dark grey, brown or black. The sexes are similar, but in breeding plumage, they can be separated by the male&#x27;s brighter, more extensive orange breast, neck and head. In winter, adult black-tailed godwits have a uniform brown-grey breast and upperparts (in contrast to the bar-tailed godwit&#x27;s streaked back). Juveniles have a pale orange wash to the neck and breast.

In flight, its bold black and white wings and white rump can be seen readily. When on the ground it can be difficult to separate from the similar bar-tailed Godwit, but the black-tailed godwit&#x27;s longer, straighter bill and longer legs are diagnostic. Black-tailed godwits are similar in body size and shape to bar-taileds, but stand taller.

It measures from bill to tail with a wingspan of . Males weight around and females . The female is around 5% larger than the male, with a bill 12–15% longer.

The most common call is a strident &quot;weeka weeka weeka&quot;.

A study of black-tailed godwits in the Netherlands found a mortality rate of 37.6% in the first year of life, 32% in the second year, and 36.9% thereafter.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Black-tailed godwits have a discontinuous breeding range stretching from Iceland to the far east of Russia. Their breeding habitat is river valley fens, floods at the edges of large lakes, damp steppes, raised bogs and moorlands. An important proportion of the European population now uses secondary habitats: lowland wet grasslands, coastal grazing marshes, pastures, wet areas near fishponds or sewage works, and saline lagoons. Breeding can also take place in sugar beet, potato and rye fields in the Netherlands and Germany.

In spring, black-tailed godwits feed largely in grasslands, moving to muddy estuaries after breeding and for winter. On African wintering grounds, swamps, floods and irrigated paddy fields can attract flocks of birds. In India, inland pools, lakes and marshes are used, and occasionally brackish lakes, tidal creeks and estuaries.

Godwits from the Icelandic population winter mainly in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and the Netherlands, though some fly on to Spain, Portugal and perhaps Morocco. Birds of the &quot;limosa&quot; subspecies from western Europe fly south to Morocco and then on to Senegal and Guinea-Bissau. Birds from the eastern European populations migrate to Tunisia and Algeria, then on to Mali or Chad. Young birds from the European populations stay on in Africa after their first winter and return to Europe at the age of two years. Asian black-tailed godwits winter in Australia, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea.
Black-tailed godwits are much more likely to be found on inland wetlands than the more coastal bar-tailed godwit. They migrate in flocks to western Europe, Africa, south Asia and Australia. Although this species occurs in Ireland and Great Britain all year-round, they are not the same birds. The breeding birds depart in autumn, but are replaced in winter by the larger Icelandic race. These birds occasionally appear in the Aleutian Islands and, rarely, on the Atlantic coast of North America.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
Black-tailed godwits are mostly monogamous; although it was not recorded in a four-year study of 50–60 pairs, bigamy was considered &quot;probably frequent&quot;. A study of the Icelandic population showed that despite spending winter apart, pairs are reunited on their breeding grounds within an average of three days of each other. If one partner does not arrive on time, &#x27;divorce&#x27; occurs. They nest in loose colonies. Unpaired males defend a temporary territory and perform display flights to attract a mate. Several nest scrapes are made away from the courtship territory, and are defended from other godwits. Once eggs are laid, an area of around the nest is defended. The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground, usually in short vegetation. The eggs may be hidden with vegetation by the incubating parent.

The single brood of three to six eggs, coloured olive-green to dark brown, measure and weigh each (of which 6% is shell). Incubation lasts 22–24 days and is performed by both parents. The young are downy and precocial and are brooded while they are small and at night during colder weather. After hatching, they are led away from the nest and may move to habitats such as sewage farms, lake edges, marshes and mudflats. The chicks fledge after 25–30 days.

Black-tailed godwit productivity varies, positively, with spring temperatures. However, during extreme events, such as a volcanic eruption, complete breeding failures can occur.

===Food and feeding===

They mainly eat invertebrates, but also aquatic plants in winter and on migration. In the breeding season, prey includes beetles, flies, grasshoppers, dragonflies, mayflies, caterpillars, annelid worms and molluscs. Occasionally, fish eggs, frogspawn and tadpoles are eaten. In water, the most common feeding method is to probe vigorously, up to 36 times per minute, and often with the head completely submerged. On land, black-tailed godwits probe into soft ground and also pick prey items from the surface.

==Relationship to humans==
In Europe, black-tailed godwits are only hunted in France, with the annual total killed estimated at 6,000 to 8,000 birds. This puts additional pressure on the western European population, and the European Commission has a management plan in place for the species in its member states. In England, black-tailed godwits were formerly much prized for the table. Sir Thomas Browne (1605–1682) said: &quot;[Godwits] were accounted the daintiest dish in England and I think, for the bignesse, of the biggest price.&quot; Old names included Blackwit, Whelp, Yarwhelp, Shrieker, Barker and Jadreka Snipe. The Icelandic name for the species is Jaðrakan.

==Status==
There is an estimated global population of between 634,000 and 805,000 birds and estimated range of . In 2006 BirdLife International classified this species as Near Threatened due to a decline in numbers of around 25% in the previous 15 years. It is also among the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. In 2024, &quot;L. limosa&quot; was listed as Endangered under the Australian EPBC Act.

<text>Rainer &quot;Rai&quot; Weiss ( , ; born September 29, 1932) is a German-born American physicist, known for his contributions in gravitational physics and astrophysics. He is a professor of physics emeritus at MIT and an adjunct professor at LSU. He is best known for inventing the laser interferometric technique which is the basic operation of LIGO. He was Chair of the COBE Science Working Group.

In 2017, Weiss was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Kip Thorne and Barry Barish, &quot;for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves&quot;.

Weiss has helped realize a number of challenging experimental tests of fundamental physics. He is a member of the Fermilab Holometer experiment, which uses a 40m laser interferometer to measure properties of space and time at quantum scale and provide Planck-precision tests of quantum holographic fluctuation.

== Early life and education ==
Rainer Weiss was born in Berlin, Germany, the son of Gertrude Loesner and Frederick A. Weiss. His father, a physician, neurologist, and psychoanalyst, was forced out of Germany by Nazis because he was Jewish and an active member of the Communist Party. His mother, an actress, was Christian. His aunt was the sociologist Hilda Weiss.

The family fled first to Prague, but Germany&#x27;s occupation of Czechoslovakia after the 1938 Munich Agreement caused them to flee again; the philanthropic Stix family of St. Louis helped them obtain visas to enter the United States. Weiss spent his youth in New York City, where he attended Columbia Grammar School. He studied at MIT, dropped out during his junior year, but eventually returned to receive his S.B. degree in 1955 and Ph.D. degree in 1962 under Jerrold Zacharias.

He taught at Tufts University from 1960 to 1962, was a postdoctoral scholar at Princeton University from 1962 to 1964, and then joined the faculty at MIT in 1964.

In a 2022 interview given to Federal University of Pará in Brazil, Weiss talks about his life and career, the memories of his childhood and youth, his undergraduate and graduate studies at MIT, and the future of gravitational waves astronomy.

== Achievements ==
Weiss brought two fields of fundamental physics research from birth to maturity: characterization of the cosmic background radiation, and interferometric gravitational wave observation.

In 1973 he made pioneering measurements of the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation, taken from a weather balloon, showing that the microwave background exhibited the thermal spectrum characteristic of the remnant radiation from the Big Bang. He later became co-founder and science advisor of the NASA Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite, which made detailed mapping of the radiation.

Weiss also pioneered the concept of using lasers for an interferometric gravitational wave detector, suggesting that the path length required for such a detector would necessitate kilometer-scale arms. He built a prototype in the 1970s, following earlier work by Robert L. Forward. He co-founded the NSF LIGO (gravitational-wave detection) project, which was based on his report &quot;A study of a long Baseline Gravitational Wave Antenna System&quot;.

Both of these efforts couple challenges in instrument science with physics important to the understanding of the Universe.

In February 2016, he was one of the four scientists of LIGO/Virgo collaboration presenting at the press conference for the announcement that the first direct gravitational wave observation had been made in September 2015.

<doc id="318889" wikidata="Q1509101" url="?curid=318889" title="Viscount Sydney">
<text>Viscount Sydney (an alternative spelling of the surname Sidney) is a title that has been created twice. The title was elevated twice from a barony, and once into an earldom.

==First creation (1689)==
The first creation came on 9 April 1689 when Henry Sydney was elevated from Baron Sydney to Viscount Sydney, of Sheppey, in the Peerage of England. On 14 May 1694, he was also created Earl of Romney but his titles became extinct when he died unmarried in 1704.

==Second creation (1789)==
The second creation came in 1789 when Thomas Townshend (the then Baron Sydney) was made Viscount Sydney, of St Leonards, in the Peerage of Great Britain. He served as Home Secretary and Leader of the House of Lords. Townshend was the son of the Hon. Thomas Townshend, second son of Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend, whose eldest son Charles Townshend, 3rd Viscount Townshend is the ancestor of the Marquesses of Townshend. Townshend was also a female-line great-great-grandson of Lady Lucy Sydney, daughter of Robert Sydney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, hence his choice of title. The family seat of this branch of the Townshend family was Frognal House, near Sidcup (then in Kent, now in the London Borough of Bexley).

=== List of Viscounts Sydney (1789) ===
* Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney (1733–1800) - the cities of Sydney (1785) in Nova Scotia, Canada, and Sydney (1788) in New South Wales, Australia, were named in his honour
* John Thomas Townshend, 2nd Viscount Sydney (1764–1831) - represented Newport and Whitchurch in the House of Commons. 
*John Robert Townshend, 3rd Viscount Sydney (1805–1890) - served as Lord Chamberlain of the Household and as Lord Steward of the Household, and was elevated to Earl Sydney in 1874. He died childless in February 1890, aged 84, when all his titles became extinct.

<doc id="318890" wikidata="Q10958564" url="?curid=318890" title="Winesburg, Ohio">
<text>Winesburg, Ohio (full title: &quot;Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life&quot;) is a 1919 short story cycle by the American author Sherwood Anderson. The work is structured around the life of protagonist George Willard, from the time he was a child to his growing independence and ultimate abandonment of Winesburg as a young man. It is set in the fictional town of Winesburg, Ohio (not to be confused with the actual Winesburg, Ohio), which is loosely based on Anderson&#x27;s childhood memories of Clyde, Ohio.

Mostly written from late 1915 to early 1916, with a few stories completed closer to publication, they were &quot;...conceived as complementary parts of a whole, centered in the background of a single community.&quot; The book consists of twenty-two stories, with the first story, &quot;The Book of the Grotesque&quot;, serving as an introduction. Each of the stories shares a specific character&#x27;s past and present struggle to overcome the loneliness and isolation that seem to permeate the town. Stylistically, because of its emphasis on the psychological insights of characters over plot, and plainspoken prose, &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; is known as one of the earliest works of Modernist literature.

&quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; was received well by critics despite some reservations about its moral tone and unconventional storytelling. Though its reputation waned in the 1930s, it has since rebounded and is now considered one of the most influential portraits of pre-industrial small-town life in the United States.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; 24th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

==Genre==
Though there is practically no argument about the unity of structure within &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, few scholars have concluded that it fits the standards of a conventional novel. Instead, it is typically placed &quot;...midway between the novel proper and the mere collection of stories,&quot; known as the short story cycle. Aside from its structural unity, the common setting, characters, symbolism and &quot;consistency of mood&quot; are all additional qualities that tie the stories together despite their initial publication as separate tales.

Promoted to younger writers by Anderson himself, &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; has served as a representative early example of the modern short story cycle in American letters. Comparisons between &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; and Jean Toomer&#x27;s &quot;Cane&quot; (1923), Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;In Our Time&quot; (1925), William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;Go Down, Moses&quot; (1942), and several of John Steinbeck&#x27;s works, among others, demonstrate the pervasiveness of the formal innovations made in Anderson&#x27;s book.

The focus on George Willard&#x27;s development as a young man and a writer has also led some critics to put &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; within the tradition of &quot;the American boy book, the &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;, and the &quot;Künstlerroman&quot;&quot;.

==Setting==
It is widely acknowledged that the fictional model of the book&#x27;s town, Winesburg, is based on Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s boyhood memories of Clyde, Ohio, where Anderson lived between the ages of eight and nineteen (1884–1896), and not the actual town of Winesburg, Ohio. This view is supported by the similarities between the names and qualities of several Winesburg characters and Clyde&#x27;s townspeople, in addition to mentions of specific geographic details of Clyde and the surrounding area.

It is not known why Anderson chose the name &quot;Winesburg&quot; for the town in the book. What is known is that the name was not necessarily determined by the stories themselves. In actuality, Anderson had been using Winesburg, Ohio, as a base for Talbot Whittingham, the protagonist of an unfinished novel he had been writing on-and-off for several years prior to the composition of the Winesburg stories.

A direct relationship between the real Clyde and the fictional Winesburg, however, remains the supposition of scholars. Anderson wrote in &quot;A Writer&#x27;s Conception of Realism&quot; that he reacted with &quot;shock&quot; when he &quot;...heard people say that one of my own books &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, was an exact picture of Ohio village life.&quot; The author went on to admit that, &quot;the hint for almost every character was taken from my fellow lodgers in a large rooming house...&quot; These lodgers were the &quot;...young musicians, young writers, painters, actors...&quot; and others that lived in proximity to Anderson on the North Side of Chicago and to whom he referred as &quot;The Little Children of the Arts&quot;. The truth probably lies somewhere in between, with memories of Clyde &quot;merging&quot; with Anderson&#x27;s interactions at the boardinghouse.

==Literary sources==
It is difficult to say that any specific writer or work influenced &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; as a whole because Anderson was ambiguous about the matter. Still, most scholars affirm the obvious connection between Anderson&#x27;s cycle and the &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; of Edgar Lee Masters (published in ), which Anderson reportedly stayed up all night to read. Though B.W. Huebsch, Anderson&#x27;s publisher, sent out a statement, upon the release of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, heading off comparisons between the two works by stating (erroneously, as it turns out) that the Winesburg stories were printed in magazines before the &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; was published, the similarities in small-town setting, structure, and mood of the works have been noted by several reviewers, with one going so far as to call &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, the &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; &quot;...put into prose.&quot;

Gertrude Stein, whose work Anderson was introduced to by either his brother Karl or photographer Alfred Stieglitz between 1912 and 1915, is also said to have played a key role in helping shape the unique style found in the stories. Through his interaction (at first satirizing it before ultimately accepting it as essential to his development) with Stein&#x27;s &quot;Three Lives&quot; (1909) and &quot;Tender Buttons&quot; (1914), Anderson found the plain, unambiguous voice that became a staple of his prose. As indicated by the correspondence the two writers developed after the publication of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, variations on the repetition found in Stein&#x27;s writing in addition to their mutual appreciation for the sentence as a basic unit of prose were also likely features of her writing that Anderson noticed and drew upon in writing his &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;. Literary critic Irving Howe summarized the pair&#x27;s connection aptly when he wrote, &quot;Stein was the best kind of influence: she did not bend Anderson to her style, she liberated him for his own.&quot;

Numerous other writers and works have been mentioned as possible sources from which the elements of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; were drawn, most of them either denied or unacknowledged by Anderson himself. The influence of Theodore Dreiser and the Russians (Chekhov, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy) were discounted by the author, the former for stylistic reasons, the latter because he had apparently not read them prior to writing his book. While Anderson expressed an admiration for Ivan Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;A Sportsman&#x27;s Sketches&quot;, the affinities between Turgenev&#x27;s novel and &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; (&quot;...both are episodic novels containing loosely bound but closely related sketches, both depend for impact less on dramatic action than on climactic lyrical insight, and in both the individual sketches frequently end with bland understatements that form an ironic coda to the body of the writing&quot;) may not be a sign of influence since it is not known whether Anderson read the book before writing &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;. Finally, the regional focus on the Midwest has been linked to the writing of Mark Twain, particularly &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,&quot; and while Anderson read and revered Twain, the connection between Twain and &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; has largely been made by scholars seeking to place the book within the canon of American literature, not necessarily by the author.

==Composition and publication==
According to Anderson&#x27;s account, the first of the stories that became &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; (probably &quot;The Book of the Grotesque&quot;) was composed, on the spur of the moment, in the middle of the night, probably while he was staying on the third floor of a rooming house at in Chicago: &quot;...it was a late fall night and raining...I was there naked in the bed and I sprang up. I went to my typewriter and began to write. It was there, under those circumstances, myself sitting near an open window, the rain occasionally blowing in and wetting my bare back, that I did my first writing...I wrote it, as I wrote them all, complete in the one sitting...The rest of the stories in the book came out of me on succeeding evenings, and sometimes during the day while I worked in the advertising office...&quot; Study of his manuscripts shows that, though it is probably true that most of the stories were written within a relatively short span of time in late 1915, like a number of facts in Anderson&#x27;s retelling of his writing process (for instance, his claim that he had written the &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; stories after his earlier books were already published), it is inaccurate to say that the final versions of the stories published in 1919 were exactly the same as the ones written whole four years earlier.

In fact, in his seminal article &quot;How Sherwood Anderson wrote &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;,&quot; William L. Phillips wrote that the manuscript of &quot;Hands&quot; contained &quot;...almost two hundred instances in which earlier words and phrases are deleted, changed, or added to...&quot; though no major structural changes to the story were detected. Additionally, slightly different versions of ten stories that ended up in the book were published by three literary magazines between 1916 and 1918 as follows:

Though the stories were published to some acclaim in literary circles, John Lane, the publisher of Anderson&#x27;s first two novels, referred to the &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; stories as &quot;too gloomy&quot; and refused to publish them. It was not until editor Francis Hackett showed the manuscript to Ben Huebsch, owner and editor of a small publishing house in New York, that the stories (Huebsch suggested calling them &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;) were brought together and published.

==The stories==
The cycle consists of twenty-two short stories, one of which consists of four parts:
* The Book of the Grotesque
* Hands—&quot;concerning&quot; Wing Biddlebaum
* Paper Pills—&quot;concerning&quot; Doctor Reefy
* Mother—&quot;concerning&quot; Elizabeth Willard
* The Philosopher—&quot;concerning&quot; Doctor Parcival
* Nobody Knows—&quot;concerning&quot; Louise Trunnion
* Godliness
** Parts I and II—&quot;concerning&quot; Jesse Bentley
** Surrender (Part III)—&quot;concerning&quot; Louise Bentley
** Terror (Part IV)—&quot;concerning&quot; David Hardy
* A Man of Ideas—&quot;concerning&quot; Joe Welling
* Adventure—&quot;concerning&quot; Alice Hindman
* Respectability—&quot;concerning&quot; Wash Williams
* The Thinker—&quot;concerning&quot; Seth Richmond
* Tandy—&quot;concerning&quot; Tandy Hard
* The Strength of God—&quot;concerning&quot; The Reverend Curtis Hartman
* The Teacher—&quot;concerning&quot; Kate Swift
* Loneliness—&quot;concerning&quot; Enoch Robinson
* An Awakening—&quot;concerning&quot; Belle Carpenter
* &quot;Queer&quot;—&quot;concerning&quot; Elmer Cowley
* The Untold Lie—&quot;concerning&quot; Ray Pearson
* Drink—&quot;concerning&quot; Tom Foster
* Death—&quot;concerning&quot; Doctor Reefy and Elizabeth Willard
* Sophistication—&quot;concerning&quot; Helen White
* Departure—&quot;concerning&quot; George Willard

The book is written as a third-person omniscient narrative with the narrator occasionally breaking away from the story to directly address the reader or make self-conscious comments (in &quot;Hands&quot;, after describing the poignant nature of the story, he writes that &quot;It is a job for a poet&quot;, later in the same story adding, &quot;It needs a poet there&quot;.) These remarks appear less often as the book progresses.

Though each story&#x27;s title notes one character, there are a total of over named in the book, some appearing only once and some recurring several times. According to literary scholar Forrest L. Ingram, &quot;George Willard [recurs] in all but six stories; 33 characters each appear in more than one story (some of them five and six times). Ninety-one characters appear only once in the cycle (ten of these are central protagonists in their stories).&quot; Within the stories, characters figure in anecdotes that cover a relatively large time period; much of the action takes place during George&#x27;s teenage years, but there are also episodes that go back several generations (particularly in &quot;Godliness&quot;), approximately twenty years (&quot;Hands&quot;), and anywhere in between. Indeed, the climactic scenes of two stories, &quot;The Strength of God&quot; and &quot;The Teacher&quot;, are actually juxtaposed over the course of one stormy January evening. As Malcolm Cowley writes in his introduction to the 1960 Viking edition of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, Anderson&#x27;s &quot;...instinct was to present everything together, as in a dream&quot;.

==Major themes==
The major themes of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; largely concern the interaction between the individual citizens of Winesburg and the world around them. As each of the book&#x27;s stories focuses primarily (though not exclusively) on one character, the narrator develops these themes continuously, sometimes adding new insights about previously introduced characters. (Elizabeth Willard&#x27;s relationship with Dr. Reefy in &quot;Death,” for example, was never alluded to when she was first introduced in &quot;Mother.”) Because George Willard is a fixture in much of the book, his character arc becomes just as important a theme of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; as that of the rest of the town&#x27;s inhabitants.

=== Inability to communicate, loneliness, and isolation ===
The most prevalent theme in &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; is the interplay between how the Winesburg citizens&#x27; &quot;...inability to translate inner feelings into outward form&quot; expresses itself in the loneliness and isolation that makes their various adventures noteworthy. This dynamic is present, in some form, in practically all of the stories, three fairly representative examples being the merchant&#x27;s son, Elmer Cowley, in the story &quot;Queer,” George&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Willard, in the stories &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Death,” and Jessie Bentley in &quot;Godliness.”

In the former, the young man Elmer Cowley, incited by an imagined slight (&quot;He thought that the boy who passed and repassed Cowley &amp; Son&#x27;s store ... must be thinking of him and perhaps laughing at him&quot; when in reality, &quot;[George] had long been wanting to make friends with the young merchant...&quot;) tries twice to tell George off but is unable to communicate his feelings either time, finally physically assaulting the young reporter. The story ends with Cowley telling himself, &quot;I showed him ... I guess I showed him. I guess I showed him I ain&#x27;t so queer&quot;, a proclamation obviously laced with dramatic irony.

In the latter two stories, Elizabeth Willard was the &quot;tall and gaunt...ghostly figure [moving] slowly through the halls...&quot; of the New Willard House who eventually, in &quot;Death,” succumbs to illness. In her youth, Elizabeth &quot;...had been &#x27;stage-struck&#x27; and, wearing loud clothes, paraded the streets with traveling men from her father&#x27;s hotel“. She was a character who, &quot;perhaps more than any of the other characters, seeks some kind of release from her perpetual loneliness&quot;. And yet, aside from her very brief love affair with Dr. Reefy, Elizabeth Willard finds no solace. Instead, both of her stories conclude with Elizabeth Willard attempting to communicate with her son but, like the dumbfounded Elmer Cowley, winding up unsuccessful.

===Escaping isolation===
In contrast with the stark view of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; above, a number of scholars have taken the perspective that the cycle is, in fact, about escape from isolation instead of the condition itself. Barry D. Bort writes, &quot;Criticism of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; has recognized this desperate need to communicate, but what has not been understood about Anderson&#x27;s work is that this continual frustration serves as the context out of which arise a few luminous moments of understanding... Such moments are at the heart of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, although they are few and evanescent&quot;. Though rarely does escape come in the narrative present, many of the stories prominently feature anecdotes of past adventures where lonely and reserved characters run naked through the town on a rainy night (Alice Hindman in &quot;Adventure&quot;), drive their wagon headlong into a speeding locomotive (Windpeter Winters in &quot;The Untold Lie&quot;), and have window-shattering religious epiphanies (Reverend Curtis Hartman in &quot;The Strength of God&quot;). While not all of the adventures are so dramatic, each has its place in the annals of the town, sometimes as told to George Willard, other times in the memories of participants.

===George Willard&#x27;s coming-of-age===
George Willard, a young reporter for the &quot;Winesburg Eagle&quot;, figures prominently in much of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;. Throughout the book, he plays the dual role of listener and recorder of other people&#x27;s stories and advice, and the young representative of the town&#x27;s hopes whose coming-of-age reaches its dénouement in the final tale, &quot;Departure,” when George leaves Winesburg for the city. Much of George&#x27;s story is centered around two interconnected threads: those of his sexual and artistic maturation. Most of the time, these two formative elements proceed together; it is solely when George loses his virginity to Louise Trunnion in &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; that the adventure is exclusively sexual. Afterwards, starting with his desire to fall in love with Helen White in order to have material for a love story in &quot;The Thinker,” the desire for sexual fulfillment becomes linked to his literary/emotional sensibility.

In &quot;The Teacher,” a central point in George&#x27;s development, &quot;Kate Swift, George&#x27;s school teacher, realizes his literary potential...&quot; and tries to communicate her thoughts to George but, &quot;...his sexual desire kindles her own, and she loses touch with the intellectual, spiritual, and creative potentials of her emotion. At last, however, George begins to perceive that there is something more to be communicated between men and women than physical encounter...&quot; Yet this lesson is not solidified for the young reporter when, after boasting in a bar in the story &quot;An Awakening,” he has a surge of &quot;masculine power&quot; and tries to seduce Belle Carpenter, only to be repelled and humiliated by her beau, the large-fisted bartender, Ed Handby.

The climax of George&#x27;s sexual and artistic coming-of-age comes in the second-to-last story of the collection, &quot;Sophistication&quot;. Early in the story, while walking amongst the crowds of the Winesburg County Fair, George felt &quot;...a thing known to men and unknown to boys. He felt old and little tired...[and]...he wanted someone to understand the feeling that had taken possession of him after his mother&#x27;s death [an event that took place in, &quot;Death,” the previous story]&quot;. That someone turned out to be Helen White, who herself had &quot;...come to a period of change&quot;. It is in the time they spend together that readers see &quot;his acceptance of Helen as a spiritual mediator...&quot; which signifies that &quot;...George&#x27;s masculinity is balanced by the feminine qualities of tenderness and gentleness, an integration that Anderson suggests is necessary for the artist.&quot;

==Style==
The style of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; has often been placed at various points in the spectrum between the naturalism of Anderson&#x27;s literary predecessor, William Dean Howells (who died almost one year after the publication of the book), contemporaries Theodore Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis, and the Modernist writers of the Lost Generation. In what has been dubbed a &quot;New Realism&quot;, &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; surpasses the notion of the novel as an &quot;objective report&quot; by making use of &quot;lyrical, nostalgic, evocative,&quot; even sentimental effects of nineteenth-century novels in its depictions of what lies beneath the psychological surface of a midwestern town. In the book, Anderson reoriented the facts typical of realist novels by incorporating his characters&#x27; inner beliefs about themselves as part of &quot;reality&quot;.

The symbolism in &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; plays a large role in allowing for this reorientation. Beginning with the idea of characters as grotesques whose &quot;...grotesqueness is not merely a shield of deformity; it is also a remnant of misshapen feelings, what Dr. Reefy in the sketch &#x27;Paper Pills&#x27; calls &#x27;the sweetness of the twisted apples&#x27;&quot;. The irony of the sweet, but twisted (meaning, in the sentimental Victorian tradition, internally inferior), apples is that they are compared to Dr. Reefy&#x27;s own knuckles that make a habit of stuffing crumpled notes bearing his thoughts unread into his pockets (itself a symbol of the &quot;ineffectuality of human thought&quot;). Wing Biddlebaum, the subject of the story &quot;Hands&quot;, likewise was &quot;...forever striving to conceal [his hands] in his pockets or behind his back&quot;. For Wing, his hands were &quot;...the very index of his humanity&quot;, with the potential to symbolize a continuum going from a general fear of sexuality to sublimated homosexuality. Wing Biddlebaum and Dr. Reefy are just two examples of how throughout &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, Anderson builds myriad themes by adding symbolic significance to gestures, weather conditions and time of day, and events, among other features of the stories.

Another major characteristic of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; that separates its style from Anderson&#x27;s contemporaries, as well as his previous novels, is the minimal role of plot. According to critic David Stouk&#x27;s article &quot;Anderson&#x27;s Expressionist Art&quot;, &quot;As an expressionist drama, there is little development of a story line in the Winesburg tales in term of cause and effect.&quot; Indeed, it is this de-emphasis of traditional story elements in lieu of experimentation with language that provides both a link and a rift between &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; and the novels of the following decades; whereas the simple, stripped-down vernacular that Gertrude Stein found so appealing in Anderson&#x27;s writing of the time became an exemplar of quintessential American style most famously associated with Ernest Hemingway, the expressionistic portrayal of emotional states in &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; was later, by some critics, considered &quot;undisciplined&quot; and &quot;vague&quot;.

==Literary significance and criticism==
The critical reception to &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; upon its publication in 1919 was mostly positive, even effusive. Hart Crane, for example, wrote that &quot;...America should read this book on her knees,&quot; while H.L. Mencken wrote that &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; &quot;...embodies some of the most remarkable writing done in America in our time&quot;. Despite criticism that Anderson&#x27;s &quot;sordid tales&quot; were humorless, and &quot;mired...in plotlessness&quot;, &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; was reprinted several times, selling a total of about by 1921.

The popularity of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; among readers and critics has remained fairly high but has fluctuated with Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s literary reputation. His reputation, while steady through the 1920s, began to decline in the 1930s. William L. Phillips, following the lukewarm reception of &quot;The Letters of Sherwood Anderson&quot; in 1953, commented that &quot;...Anderson is out of fashion.&quot; Throughout that decade, however, the author and his most popular book were the subject of a &quot;...re-examination, if only as a neglected literary ancestor of the moderns.&quot; Into the 1960s and beyond, this &quot;re-examination&quot; became a &quot;reevaluation&quot; by critics who today generally consider &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; a modern classic. &quot;Cleveland Review of Books&quot; reviewed the book after a new edition came out through Ohio University Press in 2019, calling it &quot;a spotlight on the outcasts, of whom there are so many one may begin to wonder whether there exist any incasts.&quot; The Pequod called it “one of the great modern short story collections… Anderson’s writing is of such consistently high quality that he is able to elevate the stories to the level of great poetry and even tragedy,” and rated the book a 9.5 (out of 10.0). In a 2011 review, Ploughshares praised the book, and specifically highlighted its “in-depth, fearless, summarized description of emotion.”

==Literary and cultural connections==

===In film===
In the 1985 film &quot;Heaven Help Us&quot;, Danni reads a passage from &quot;Sophistication&quot; to her grief-stricken father.

In the 2003 film &quot;The Best of Youth (La meglio gioventù)&quot;, Matteo Carati borrows &quot;Racconti dell&#x27;Ohio&quot;, the Italian translation of the book, from the library in Rome where he sees Mirella for the second time.

Daniel Nearing&#x27;s 2009 independent film &quot;Chicago Heights&quot; was based on &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;.

===In literature===
F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his wry reminisence of the Jazz Age, summed up the lesson learned by the book&#x27;s unsophisticated readers as the fact that &quot;there&#x27;s a lot of sex around if we only knew it&quot;.

Ray Bradbury has credited &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; as an inspiration for his book &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;.

H. P. Lovecraft said that he wrote the short story &quot;Arthur Jermyn&quot; after he &quot;had nearly fallen asleep over the tame backstairs gossip of Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;.&quot;

Henry Miller references the book on the first page of his novel &quot;Sexus&quot; (of &quot;The Rosy Crucifixion&quot; series).

Amos Oz writes in his autobiography &quot;A Tale of Love and Darkness&quot; that &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; had a powerful influence on his writing, showing him that literature must not necessarily always be about heroes. Only after reading Anderson did he find the courage to start writing.

Philip Roth&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;Indignation&quot; is set, in part, at Winesburg College in Winesburg, Ohio. His protagonist holds a part-time job as a waiter at the &quot;New Willard House&quot;, evoking the protagonist, George Willard, of Anderson&#x27;s book.

Porter Shreve presents a possible sequel to &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; in his novel &quot;The End of the Book&quot;.

===In television===

In the pilot episode of the AMC television series, &quot;Fear the Walking Dead&quot;, the novel &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; is picked up in the church used as a drug den, from under a mattress, when character Madison Clark indicates it belongs to her son, Nick. Nick is shown reading and discussing the book in season 2, episode 8, which takes its title from the book&#x27;s opening story.

In the ABC television series, &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot;, the book is given to the character Aria Montgomery by her English teacher, Ezra Fitz, with whom she is having an affair. He writes the inscription &quot;When you need to leave Rosewood... Ezra&quot; on the first page.

In the sixth episode of second season of &quot;Mad Men&quot;, &quot;Maidenform&quot;, Duck Phillips walks into the office of William Redd, who quickly puts down his copy of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;.

In the 13th and final episode of the 6th Season of the Netflix series, &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot;, the character Nicky Nichols is seen carrying a copy of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;.

Nathaniel Halpern, the writer of the 2020 Amazon television series &quot;Tales from the Loop&quot;, drew inspiration from &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, its themes of loneliness and isolation, and its focus on small town characters.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
On 3 Aug. 1959, &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced a film adaptation to be produced by Mirisch Company for release by United Artists, Christopher Sergel to write the screenplay and Jeffrey Hayden to direct. This film was never made.

A TV version was made in 1973 directed by Ralph Senensky and starring Joseph and Timothy Bottoms as George Willard, Jean Peters as Elizabeth Willard, Curt Conway as Will Henderson, Norman Foster as Old Pete, Dabbs Greer as Parcival, Albert Salmi as Tom Willard, Laurette Spang as Helen White, and William Windom as Dr. Reefy.

In 2008 &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, a filmed adaptation of the novel, was produced by Jennifer Granville. It was screened at the Athens International Film and Video Festival. A companion documentary, &quot;Lost in Winesburg&quot;, directed by Tommy Britt, examined the legacy of Anderson&#x27;s book by documenting present day small town Ohio and the attempt to adapt Anderson&#x27;s book for the screen by the local community and Ohio University students, alumni, staff and faculty.

In 2010, &quot;Chicago Heights&quot;, a contemporary adaptation of the modular novel, premiered in competition at the Busan International Film Festival and appeared in multiple additional festivals. Noted film critic Roger Ebert said &quot;it is a beautiful book, and has inspired this beautiful film,&quot; and later listed &quot;Chicago Heights&quot; among the Best Art Films of 2010. The film was directed by Daniel Nearing, written by Nearing and Rudy Thauberger, and stars Andre Truss, Keisha Dyson and Gerrold Johnson.

===Stage===
A stage adaptation of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; by Sherwood Anderson (initially in collaboration with playwright Arthur Barton) was performed at the Hedgerow Theatre in Rose Valley, Pennsylvania in 1934. Directed by Jasper Deeter, it achieved some success, running from June through September of that year. Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons published this version of the play alongside three one-act plays (&quot;Triumph of an Egg&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot;, and &quot;They Married Later&quot;), also by Anderson, as &quot;Plays: Winesburg and Others&quot; in 1937.

A Broadway production played for in at the Nederlander Theatre (then known as the National Theatre). The adaptation, written by Christopher Sergel, starred Ben Piazza as George Willard, James Whitmore as Tom Willard, Sandra Church as Helen White, and Leon Ames as Dr. Reefy.

Four of the stories from &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; were staged in 2001 at the Julia Morgan Theater in Berkeley, California. Word for Word Performing Arts Company and the Shotgun Players adapted &quot;A Man of Ideas&quot;, &quot;Paper Pills&quot;, &quot;Surrender&quot;, and &quot;Hands&quot;. The production was nominated for five San Francisco Bay Area Theatre Critics Circle Awards (Entire Production – Drama, Supporting Performance – Female, Director, Sound Design, and Ensemble Performance).

The whole cycle was adapted into a musical and premiered in 2002 at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago, Illinois. The book and lyrics were written by Eric Rosen (in collaboration with Andrew Pluess, Ben Sussman, and Jessica Thebus). Following its 2002 premiere, the musical was featured as part of the About Face Theatre Company&#x27;s 2003–2004 season. The About Face production received the two Jeff Awards for New Adaptation and Actor in a Supporting Role-Musical. A 2006 production of the musical by the Arden Theatre Company (Philadelphia) won the Barrymore Award for &quot;Outstanding Musical&quot;.

A loose musical adaptation of &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; written by Kevin Kuhlke with music by Heaven Phillips premiered in 2003 as &quot;Winesburg: Small Town Life&quot; at the Perseverance Theatre in Juneau, Alaska.

<text>This is a list of foods and dishes named after people. 
== A ==

* Poularde Adelina Patti – named for 19th-century opera singer Adelina Patti.
* Woodcock salmis Agnès Sorel – one of the dishes Agnès Sorel (1422–1450) is reputed to have created herself. A garnish, soup, timbales, and tartlets all bear her name, as later chefs remembered her for her interest in food.
* Big Hearted Al candy bar – early-20th-century presidential candidate Al Smith had this candy bar named after him by an admirer who owned a candy company.
* Fillet of Beef Prince Albert – Queen Victoria&#x27;s Consort Prince Albert (1819–1861). Also named for him: an English white sauce, the pea and apple varieties, Coburg Soup (brussels sprouts and smoked bacon) and probably Albert Pudding.
* Poularde Albufera, Albufera Sauce – Louis Gabriel Suchet (1770–1826), one of Napoleon&#x27;s generals and Marshal of France for a time, was named duc d&#x27;Albufera after a lake near Valencia, Spain, to mark his victory there during the Peninsular War. Marie-Antoine Carême created several dishes in the duke&#x27;s honor, including duck, beef, and the sauce that accompanies this chicken.
* Alexandertorte – possibly Tsar Alexander I, the gourmet Russian tsar who employed Antonin Carême. Finland claims the creation, allegedly by Swiss pastry chefs in Helsinki in 1818, in anticipation of the tsar&#x27;s visit there.
* Gâteau Alexandra – like her husband Edward VII, Alexandra of Denmark (1844–1925) was honoured by an assortment of foods named after her when she was Princess of Wales and Queen. Besides this chocolate cake, there is consommé Alexandra, soup, sole, chicken quail, and various meat dishes.
* Lobster Duke Alexis – the Russian Grand-Duke Alexis made a highly publicized visit to the U.S. in 1871. A dinner for him at Delmonico&#x27;s featured this, and was kept on the menu by chef Charles Ranhofer.
* Fettuccine Alfredo – Alfredo di Lelio, an early-20th-century Italian chef invented the dish for his pregnant wife at his Roman restaurant and popularized it among tourists.
* Consommé Princess Alice – this consommé with artichoke hearts and lettuce is named for Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone (1883–1981), one of Queen Victoria&#x27;s granddaughters.
* Alice B. Toklas&#x27; hashish fudge – due to the recipe being included in her book, &quot;The Alice B. Toklas Cook Book&quot;.
* Amundsen&#x27;s Dessert – (1872–1928), invented for the Norwegian polar explorer by Norwegian-American friends in Wisconsin not long before he died in an Arctic plane crash.
* Omelette André Theuriet – the French novelist and poet André Theuriet (1833–1907) has this omelette with truffles and asparagus named for him.
* Angelina Burdett plum – bred by a Mr. Dowling of Southampton, England around 1850, was named after the philanthropist Baroness Angelina Burdett-Coutts (1814–1906).
* Pommes Anna – the casserole of sliced potatoes cooked in butter was created and named by French chef Adolphe Dugléré for the 19th-century courtesan/actress Anna Deslions, who frequented Dugléré&#x27;s Café Anglais (Paris). &quot;Potatoes Annette&quot; is a version of Potatoes Anna, with the potatoes julienned instead of in rounds.
* Arnold Palmer – beverage of half lemonade and half iced-tea, named for the golfer, Arnold Palmer.
* Omelette Arnold Bennett – an unfolded omelette with smoked haddock invented at the Savoy Hotel for the writer Arnold Bennett
* Oreiller de la Belle Aurore – Claudine-Aurore Récamier, the mother of Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, also has a lobster dish named after her but this elaborate game pie was one of her son&#x27;s favorite dishes. The large square pie contains a variety of game birds and their livers, veal, pork, truffles, aspic, and much else, in puff pastry.
* Château Ausone red Bordeaux wine – Ausonius (310–395), the poet employed by Valentinian I to tutor the Roman emperor&#x27;s son, retired to the Bordeaux region and wrote about oyster farming. The wine named after him is said to be made of grapes grown on the site of his villa.

== B ==


* Bachwürfel – a cubiform confectionery named after Johann S. Bach, following the style of the Mozartkugel.
* Baco noir – a hybrid grape, named after its breeder, Maurice Baco.
* Baldwin apple – Colonel Loammi Baldwin (1745–1807), a commander of militia at the Battle of Lexington, found this apple between 1784 and 1793 while working as a surveyor and engineer on the Middlesex Canal in Massachusetts.
* Chicken Cardinal la Balue – Cardinal Jean la Balue (1421–1491), a somewhat notorious minister to Louis XI, is remembered in this dish of chicken, crayfish, and mashed potatoes.
* Barros Luco – is a popular hot sandwich in Chile that includes beef and melted cheese in one of several types of bread. The sandwich is named after Chilean president Ramón Barros Luco, and was coined in the restaurant of the National Congress of Chile, where president Luco always asked for this sandwich.
* Bartlett pear – The English Williams pear variety was inadvertently renamed by Massachusetts nurseryman Enoch Bartlett, early 19th century. Williams was a 17th-century English horticulturist.
* Bauru – This popular Brazilian sandwich was created by college student Casimiro Pinto Neto, nicknamed &quot;Bauru.&quot;

* Crab Louis – (pronounced Loo-ey) while Louis XIV is often cited as the inspiration because of his notorious fondness for food, The Davenport Hotel (Spokane) in Spokane, Washington claims Louis Davenport is the name source and inventor. Davenport was a Spokane restaurateur from 1889 on, and opened the hotel in 1914. There are several other alleged creators, including Victor Hirtzler (see Celery Victor).
* Macaroni Lucullus – Lucullus (c. 106–56 BC), full name Lucius Licinius Lucullus Ponticus, was perhaps the earliest recorded gastronome in the Western world. After a long spell of wars, the Roman general retired to a life of indulgence and opulence, most evident in his gardens and his cuisine. His name has become associated with numerous dishes of the over-the-top sort, using haute cuisine&#x27;s favorite luxury staples—truffles, foie gras, asparagus tips, artichoke hearts, sweetbreads, cockscombs, game, Madeira, and so on. Macaroni Lucullus incorporates truffles and foie gras.

* Mapo tofu – the name Mapo (麻婆) is thought to refer to a (possibly fictional) old pockmarked-face lady by the name of Chen, who invented and sold the dish. It is thus sometimes translated as &quot;Pockmarked-Face Lady&#x27;s Tofu&quot;, or &quot;Pockmarked Mother Chen&#x27;s Tofu&quot;.
* Sole Marco Polo – the renowned explorer and traveler Marco Polo (1254–1324) has this dish of sole with lobster and, somewhat oddly, tomato, named after him.

It is unknown after whom the recipe is named. It is speculated that it could be associated with the Maréchale de Luxembourg (1707–1787), the wife of Charles-François-Frédéric de Montmorency-Luxembourg (1702–1764) and a major society hostess.
* Margarita – there are many claims for the name of this tequila/lime/orange liqueur cocktail. Dallas socialite Margarita Samas said she invented it in 1948 for one of her Acapulco parties. Enrique Bastate Gutierrez claimed he invented it in Tijuana in the 1940s for Rita Hayworth. Hayworth&#x27;s real name was Margarita Cansino, and another story connects the drink to her during an earlier time when she was dancing in Tijuana nightclubs under that name. Carlos Herrera said he created and named the cocktail in his Tijuana restaurant in 1938–1939 for Marjorie King. Ms. King was reportedly allergic to all alcohol except tequila, and had asked for something besides a straight shot. Around this same general time period, Nevada bartender Red Hinton said he&#x27;d named the cocktail after his girlfriend Margarita Mendez. Other stories exist.

In 1892–1893, she was living at the Savoy Hotel in London, which was then managed by César Ritz and Auguste Escoffier. During an illness, the singer favored some extremely dry toast which was subsequently named for her. Around this same time, Escoffier created the dessert Peach Melba in her honor.

* Mornay sauce – diplomat and writer Philippe de Mornay (1549–1623), a member of Henri IV&#x27;s court, is often cited as the name source for this popular cheese version of Béchamel sauce. The alternative story is that 19th-century French chef Joseph Voiron invented it and named it after one of his cooks, Mornay, his oldest son.
* Mozartkugel – Salzburg, the birthplace of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791), is also the place where this marzipan/nougat-filled chocolate was created c. 1890. Also in the composer&#x27;s honor, Ranhofer created &quot;Galantine of pullet à la Mozart&quot; at Delmonico&#x27;s.

* Napoleon Brandy – a sort of brandy named for Napoleon Bonaparte.
* Bigarreau Napoleon cherry – unlike the pastry, the French cherry &quot;was&quot; most likely named after Napoleon Bonaparte, his son Napoleon II, or his nephew Napoleon III. The sweet, white-fleshed (bigarreau) cherry often used in maraschino cherry production fell into the hands of Oregon&#x27;s Seth Luelling of Bing cherry fame (the Napoleon is a forebear of the Bing), and he renamed it the Royal Anne. Subsequently, the cherry also became known as Queen Anne cherry in North America.
* Lord Nelson apple – Admiral Horatio Nelson (1758–1805), British hero of the Battle of Trafalgar. Nelson also has a dish of mutton cutlets named after him, as well as an early-19th-century boiled sweet (or hard candy) somewhat indelicately called &quot;Nelson&#x27;s balls&quot;.
* Nesselrode Pudding – Russian diplomat Count Karl Robert von Nesselrode (1780–1862) had several dishes named for him, usually containing chestnuts, like this iced dessert.
* Lobster Newberg – variously spelled Newburg and Newburgh, and now applied to other seafood besides lobster, this dish is usually attributed to a Captain Ben Wenberg, who brought the recipe he had supposedly found in his travels to Delmonico&#x27;s in the late 19th century. The chef, Charles Ranhofer, reproduced the dish for him and put it on the restaurant menu as Lobster Wenberg. Allegedly, the two men had a falling-out, Ranhofer took the dish off the menu, and returned it, renamed, only at other customers&#x27; insistence.

In the U.S., Ranhofer made a dish of hashed mutton Omer Pasha, as well as eggs on a dish.
* Veal Prince Orloff – Count Gregory Orloff, paramour of tzarina Catherine the Great is often cited. Much more likely, Urbain Dubois, noted 19th-century French chef, created the dish for his veal-hating employer Prince Nicolas Orloff, minister to tzar Nicolas I, hence the multiple sauces and seasonings. Stuffed pheasant à la Prince Orloff was created by Charles Ranhofer.
* Veal Oscar – Sweden&#x27;s King Oscar II (1829–1907) The dish was first served at Restaurant Operakällaren, Stockholm, Sweden in 1897 in conjunction with the world fair. It was composed by the French mâitre de cuisine of the Operakällaren restaurant, Paul Edmond Malaise, for the 25th anniversary of the accession of King Oscar II to the throne. Choron sauce that has the color of red as the same as the kings royal mantle is piped in the shape of an &quot;O&quot; around a slice of fried fillet of veal. On top the fillet, a white slice of lobster tail and a slice of black truffle are placed to symbolize the black and white outer trimming on the royal mantle and you create King Oscar&#x27;s crowned monogram. This is topped with two white sticks of asparagus, forming a Roman number two as for the number of the king being Oscar the 2nd. Contemporary versions may substitute chicken and crab.

Smeterlin had acquired the recipe in Austria, and the Queen Mother&#x27;s fondness for the cake produced its name, via either Smeterlin, food writer Clementine Paddleford or dessert maven Maida Heatter.

* Reuben sandwich – possibly Reuben Kolakofsky (1874–1960) made it for a poker group gathered at his restaurant in an Omaha, Nebraska hotel c. 1925, or Arnold Reuben, a New York restaurateur (1883–1970), may have created and named it c. 1914.
* Rigó Jancsi – the Viennese chocolate and cream pastry is named after the Gypsy violinist, Rigó Jancsi (by Hungarian use, Rigó is his last name, Jancsi his first, called literally &#x27;Blackbird Johnny&#x27;). He is perhaps best known for his part in one of the great late-19th-century society &quot;scandales&quot;. In 1896, Clara Ward, Princesse de Caraman-Chimay.

A friend of Carême, Prince Metternich, et al., Rossini had many dishes named for him: eggs, chicken, soup, salad, cannelloni, sole, risotto, pheasant, and more.

* Baby Ruth candy bar – most likely, Babe Ruth (1895–1948) was the inspiration for the name. Although the Curtiss Candy Co. has insisted from the beginning that the candy bar was named after a daughter of Grover Cleveland, Ruth Cleveland died in 1904 at the age of 12, while the Baby Ruth was introduced in 1921 right at a time when George Herman Ruth, Jr. had become a baseball superstar. Very early versions of the wrapper offer a baseball glove for 79 cents. Babe Ruth&#x27;s announced intent to sue the company is probably what drove and perpetuated the dubious cover story.

== S ==

* Sachertorte – Franz Sacher, Vienna, 1832, working for Prince Metternich.
* Chicken filets Sadi Carnot – chef Charles Ranhofer almost certainly had French President Marie François Sadi Carnot (1837–1894) in mind, not his uncle, the physicist Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot (1796–1832).

He was as well known for his entertaining as his political work, apparently agreeing with Talleyrand that dining well was essential to diplomacy. Why Ranhofer named a beef hash after him is open to speculation.
* Sandwich – John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich (1718–1792) did not invent the sandwich. Meat between slices of bread had been eaten long before him. But as the often-repeated story goes, his title name was applied to it c. 1762, after he frequently called for the easily handled food while entertaining friends. Their card games then were not interrupted by the need for forks and such.
* Sarah Bernhardt Cakes – French actress Sarah Bernhardt (1844–1923). The pastry may be Danish in origin. There is a Sole Sarah Bernhardt, and a soufflé. &quot;Sarah Bernhardt&quot; may indicate a dish garnished with a purée of foie gras, and Delmonico&#x27;s &quot;Sarah Potatoes&quot;, by Charles Ranhofer, are most likely named for the actress.
* Eggs Sardou – Invented at the New Orleans restaurant Antoine&#x27;s and named after the French dramatist Victorien Sardou
* Schillerlocken – two quite distinct foods named after the curly hair of the German poet Friedrich von Schiller (1759–1805).

During his presidency, White House dinners were even more French than in Jefferson&#x27;s day. Ranhofer may have been returning the compliment with this soup.

The son of John Wanamaker, founder of the family business, Rodman Wanamaker went to Paris in 1889 to oversee the Paris branch of their department store. When he returned to the U.S. in 1899, he kept his Paris home and contacts.

It was probably created by his personal chef. Theories vary: either the Duke had no sense of taste and didn&#x27;t care what he was eating (leaving his chef to his own devices), or he loved the dish so much that it had to be served at every formal dinner, or the shape of the concoction resembles the Wellington boot.
* Lobster Wenberg – see Lobster Newberg.
* Wibele – Jakob Christian Carl Wibel, he invented this sweet pastry in 1763
* Fraises Wilhelmine – A dessert of strawberries, macerated in orange juice, powdered sugar and kirsch, served with Crème Chantilly, created by Auguste Escoffier and named after Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. Wilhelmina Pepermunt, a Dutch peppermint candy, is also named after her.
* Prince William Cider Apple – Created to celebrate the 21st birthday of Prince William. It was named the &quot;Prince William&quot; after he said in an interview that he was a cider drinker. Large, robust yet mild in nature with a red flush and will make a cider of fair complexion, well balanced with much character.

<text>The Reuben sandwich is a North American grilled sandwich composed of corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing or Thousand Island dressing, grilled between slices of rye bread. It is associated with kosher-style delicatessens but is not kosher, as it combines meat and cheese.

==Possible origins==
One origin story holds that Reuben Kulakofsky (his first name sometimes spelled Reubin; his last name sometimes shortened to Kay), a Lithuanian-born Jewish grocer residing in Omaha, Nebraska, asked for a sandwich made of corned beef and sauerkraut at his weekly poker game held in the Blackstone Hotel from around 1920 through 1935. The participants, who nicknamed themselves &quot;the committee&quot;, included the hotel&#x27;s owner, Charles Schimmel. Schimmel&#x27;s son, who worked in the kitchen, made the first Reuben for him, adding Swiss cheese and thousand island dressing to his order, putting the whole thing on rye bread. The sandwich first gained local fame when Schimmel put it on the Blackstone&#x27;s lunch menu, and its fame spread when a former employee of the hotel won the national sandwich 
idea contest with the recipe. In Omaha, March 14 was proclaimed Reuben Sandwich Day.

Another account holds that the Reuben&#x27;s creator was Arnold Reuben, the German-Jewish owner of Reuben&#x27;s Delicatessen (1908–2001) in New York City. According to an interview with Craig Claiborne, Arnold Reuben created the &quot;Reuben Special&quot; around 1914. Bernard Sobel in his 1953 book, &quot;Broadway Heartbeat: Memoirs of a Press Agent&quot; states that the sandwich was an extemporaneous creation for Marjorie Rambeau, inaugurated when the Broadway actress visited the Reuben&#x27;s Delicatessen one night when the cupboards were particularly bare.

Still other versions give credit to Alfred Scheuing, a chef at Reuben&#x27;s Delicatessen, and say he created the sandwich for Reuben&#x27;s son, Arnold Jr., in the 1930s.

==Variations==

===Montreal Reuben===
The Montreal Reuben substitutes Montreal-style smoked meat for the corned beef.

===Thousand Island dressing===
Thousand Island dressing is commonly used as a substitute for Russian dressing.

===Walleye Reuben===
The walleye Reuben features the freshwater fish (&quot;Sander vitreus&quot;) in place of the corned beef.

===Grouper Reuben===
The grouper Reuben is a variation on the standard Reuben sandwich, substituting grouper for the corned beef, and sometimes coleslaw for the sauerkraut as well. This variation is often a menu item in restaurants in Florida.

===Reuben egg rolls===
Reuben egg rolls, sometimes called &quot;Irish egg rolls&quot; or &quot;Reuben balls&quot;, use the standard Reuben sandwich filling of corned beef, sauerkraut, and cheese inside a deep-fried egg roll wrapper. Typically served with Thousand Island dressing (instead of Russian dressing) as an appetizer or snack, they originated at Mader&#x27;s, a German restaurant in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where chef Dennis Wegner created them for a summer festival circa 1990.

===Rachel sandwich===
The Rachel sandwich is a variation which substitutes pastrami or turkey for the corned beef, and coleslaw for the sauerkraut. 
 In some parts of the United States, especially Michigan, this turkey variant is known as a &quot;Georgia Reuben&quot; or &quot;California Reuben&quot;, and it may also call for barbecue sauce or French dressing instead of Russian dressing. The name may have originated from the 1871 song &quot;Reuben and Rachel&quot;.

===Dinty Moore sandwich===
The Dinty Moore sandwich is a Detroit variation which substitutes coleslaw or shredded lettuce and tomato for the sauerkraut. It is sometimes on toasted white (wheat) bread instead of toasted rye and sometimes omits the Swiss cheese. It is often a triple-decker sandwich.

===Vegetarian and vegan versions===
Vegetarian versions, called &quot;veggie Reubens&quot;, omit the corned beef or substitute vegetarian ingredients for it, including zucchini, cucumbers, wheatmeat, and mushrooms. Vegan versions can use the aforementioned wheatmeat also known as seitan, tempeh or mushrooms with non-dairy cheese, dressing and butter.

===Kosher versions===
As a Reuben combines both meat and dairy ingredients in the same meal, it is not kosher. However, it is frequently served at kosher style restaurants. Kosher versions may be made using non-dairy imitation cheese, or substitute vegetarian corned beef, thereby omitting the meat or the cheese.

<doc id="318895" wikidata="Q309035" url="?curid=318895" title="Deodorant">
<text>A deodorant is a substance applied to the body to prevent or mask body odor caused by bacterial breakdown of perspiration, for example in the armpits, groin, or feet. A subclass of deodorants, called antiperspirants, prevents sweating itself, typically by blocking sweat glands. Antiperspirants are used on a wider range of body parts, at any place where sweat would be inconvenient or unsafe, since unwanted sweating can interfere with comfort, vision, and grip (due to slipping). Other types of deodorant allow sweating but prevent bacterial action on sweat, since human sweat only has a noticeable smell when it is decomposed by bacteria.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration classifies and regulates most deodorants as cosmetics, but classifies antiperspirants as over-the-counter drugs.

The first commercial deodorant, Mum, was introduced and patented in the late nineteenth century by an inventor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Edna Murphey. The product was briefly withdrawn from the market in the US. The modern formulation of the antiperspirant was patented by Jules Montenier on January 28, 1941. This formulation was first found in &quot;Stopette&quot; deodorant spray, which &quot;Time&quot; magazine called &quot;the best-selling deodorant of the early 1950s&quot;.

Use of deodorant with aluminium compounds has been suspected of being linked to breast cancer, but research has not proven any such link.

== Overview ==
The human body produces perspiration (sweat) via two types of sweat gland: eccrine sweat glands which cover much of the skin and produce watery odourless sweat, and apocrine sweat glands in the armpits and groin, which produce a more oily &quot;heavy&quot; sweat containing a proportion of waste proteins, fatty acids and carbohydrates, that can be metabolized by bacteria to produce compounds that cause body odor. In addition, the vagina produces secretions which are not a form of sweat but may be undesired and also masked with deodorants.

Human perspiration of all types is largely odorless until its organic components are fermented by bacteria that thrive in hot, humid environments. The human underarm is among the most consistently warm areas on the surface of the human body, and sweat glands readily provide moisture containing a fraction of organic matter, which when excreted, has a vital cooling effect. When adult armpits are washed with alkaline pH soap, the skin loses its protective acid mantle (pH 4.5–6), raising the skin pH and disrupting the skin barrier. Many bacteria are adapted to the slightly alkaline environment within the human body, so they can thrive within this elevated pH environment. This makes the skin more than usually susceptible to bacterial colonization. Bacteria on the skin feed on the waste proteins and fatty acids in the sweat from the apocrine glands and on dead skin and hair cells, releasing &quot;trans&quot;-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid in their waste, which is the primary cause of body odor.

Underarm hair wicks the moisture away from the skin and aids in keeping the skin dry enough to prevent or diminish bacterial colonization. The hair is less susceptible to bacterial growth and therefore reduces bacterial odor. The apocrine sweat glands are inactive until puberty, which is why body odor often only becomes noticeable at that time.

Deodorant products work in one of two ways – by preventing sweat from occurring, or by allowing it to occur but preventing bacterial activity that decomposes sweat on the skin.

==History ==
===Modern deodorants===
In 1888, the first modern commercial deodorant, Mum, was developed and patented by a U.S. inventor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Edna Murphey; the small company was bought by Bristol-Myers in 1931. In the late 1940s, Helen Barnett Diserens developed an underarm applicator based on the newly invented ball-point pen. In 1952, the company began marketing the product under the name Ban Roll-On. The product was briefly withdrawn from the market in the U.S., but it is once again available at retailers in the U.S. under the brand Ban. In the UK it is sold under the names Mum Solid and Mum Pump Spray. Chattem acquired the Ban deodorant brand in 1998 and subsequently sold it to Kao Corporation in 2000.

In 1903, the first commercial antiperspirant was Everdry. The modern formulation of the antiperspirant was patented by Jules Montenier on January 28, 1941. This patent addressed the problem of the excessive acidity of aluminum chloride and its excessive irritation of the skin, by combining it with a soluble nitrile or a similar compound. This formulation was first found in &quot;Stopette&quot; deodorant spray, which &quot;Time&quot; magazine called &quot;the best-selling deodorant of the early 1950s&quot;. &quot;Stopette&quot; gained its prominence as the first and long-time sponsor of the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;; it was later eclipsed by many other brands once the 1941 patent expired.

Between 1942 and 1957, the market for deodorants increased 600 times to become a $70 million market. Deodorants were originally marketed primarily to women, but by 1957 the market had expanded to male users, and estimates were that 50% of men were using deodorants by that date. The Ban Roll-On product led the market in sales.

In the early 1960s, the first aerosol antiperspirant in the marketplace was Gillette&#x27;s Right Guard, whose brand was later sold to Henkel in 2006. Aerosols were popular because they let the user dispense a spray without coming in contact with the underarm area. By the late 1960s, half of all the antiperspirants sold in the U.S. were aerosols, and continued to grow in all sales to 82% by the early 1970s. However, the late 1970s saw two developments which greatly reduced the popularity of these products. First, in 1977 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned the active ingredient used in aerosols, aluminium zirconium chemicals, due to safety concerns over long term inhalation. Second, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency limited the use of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants used in aerosols due to awareness that these gases can contribute to depleting the ozone layer. As the popularity of aerosols slowly decreased, stick antiperspirants became more popular.

==Classification==
=== Deodorant ===
In the United States, deodorants are classified and regulated as cosmetics by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are designed to eliminate odor. Deodorants are often alcohol-based. Alcohol initially stimulates sweating but may also temporarily kill bacteria. Other active ingredients in deodorants include sodium stearate, sodium chloride, and stearyl alcohol. Deodorants can be formulated with other, more persistent antimicrobials such as triclosan that slow bacterial growth or with metal chelant compounds such as EDTA. Deodorants may contain perfume fragrances or natural essential oils intended to mask the odor of perspiration. Some of the first patented deodorants used zinc oxide, acids, ammonium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and formaldehyde (which is now known as a carcinogen), and some of these ingredients were messy, irritating to the skin.

Over-the-counter products, often labeled as &quot;natural deodorant crystal&quot;, contain the chemical rock crystals potassium alum or ammonium alum, which prevents bacterial action on sweat. These have gained popularity as an alternative health product, in spite of concerns about possible risks related to aluminum (see below – all alum salts contain aluminum in the form of aluminum sulphate salts) and contact dermatitis.

Vaginal deodorant, in the form of sprays, suppositories, and wipes, is often used by women to mask vaginal secretions. Vaginal deodorants can sometimes cause dermatitis.

=== Deodorant antiperspirant ===

In the United States, deodorants combined with antiperspirant agents are classified as drugs by the FDA. Antiperspirants attempt to stop or significantly reduce perspiration and thus reduce the moist climate in which bacteria thrive. Aluminium chloride, aluminium chlorohydrate, and aluminium-zirconium compounds, most notably aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly are frequently used in antiperspirants. Aluminium chlorohydrate and aluminium-zirconium tetrachlorohydrate gly are the most frequent active ingredients in commercial antiperspirants. Aluminium-based complexes react with the electrolytes in the sweat to form a gel plug in the duct of the sweat gland. The plugs prevent the gland from excreting liquid and are removed over time by the natural sloughing of the skin. The metal salts work in another way to prevent sweat from reaching the surface of the skin: the aluminium salts interact with the keratin fibrils in the sweat ducts and form a physical plug that prevents sweat from reaching the skin&#x27;s surface. Aluminium salts also have a slight astringent effect on the pores; causing them to contract, further preventing sweat from reaching the surface of the skin. The blockage of a large number of sweat glands reduces the amount of sweat produced in the underarms, though this may vary from person to person. Methenamine in the form of cream or spray is effective in the treatment of excessive sweating and attendant odor. Antiperspirants are usually best applied before bed.

== Product formulations and formats ==

===Formulations===
Common and historical formulations for deodorants include the following active ingredients:

:* Aluminum salts (aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly, and others) – used as the basis for almost all non-prescription (everyday) antiperspirants. The aluminum reacts within the sweat gland to form a colloid which physically prevents sweating.
:* Alum (typically potassium alum or ammonium alum, also described as &quot;rock alum&quot;, or &quot;rock crystal&quot;, or &quot;natural deodorant&quot;). Alum is a natural crystalline product widely used both historically and in modern times as a deodorant, because it inhibits bacterial action. The word &#x27;alum&#x27; is a historical term for aluminum sulfate salts, therefore all alum products will contain aluminum, albeit in a different chemical form from antiperspirants.
:* Bactericidal products such as triclosan (TCS), octenidine dihydrochloride, and parabens kill bacteria on the skin.
:* Alcohols and related compounds such as propylene glycol – these products can have both drying and bactericidal effects.
:* Methenamine (hexamethylenetetramine, also known as hexamine or urotropin) is a powerful antiperspirant, often used for severe sweat-related issues, as well as prevention of sweating within the sockets of prosthetic devices used by amputees.
:* Acidifiers and pH neutral products – deodorants that prevent bacterial action by enhancing (or at least, not depleting) the skin&#x27;s natural slight acidity, known as the acid mantle, which naturally reduces bacterial action but can be compromised by typically alkaline soaps and skin products.
:* Masking scents – other strong or overriding scents of a pleasing type may be used, used to mask bodily odors. Typically these are strongly smelling plant extracts or synthetic aromas.
:* Activated charcoal and other products capable of absorbing sweat and/or smell. Although charcoal most often has a black color, the activated charcoal used in deodorants may be a very light color for aesthetic reasons.
:* Less commonly used, products such as milk of magnesia (a thick liquid suspension of magnesium hydroxide) are sometimes used as deodorants. Many milk of magnesia products contain small amounts of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) at very low levels that are safe for ingestion and skin application. Sodium hypochlorite is a powerful bactericide, and it is possible that its presence in a product that can dry onto the skin, may explain this use as a deodorant. (&quot;Safety info: bleach is caustic and extremely poisonous, and can be lethal, in higher concentrations.&quot;)

=== Formats===
Deodorants and antiperspirants come in many forms. What is commonly used varies in different countries. In Europe, aerosol sprays are popular, as are cream and roll-on forms. In North America, solid or gel forms are dominant.

== Health effects ==
After using a deodorant containing zirconium, the skin may develop an allergic, axillary granuloma response. Antiperspirants with propylene glycol, when applied to the axillae, can cause irritation and may promote sensitization to other ingredients in the antiperspirant. Deodorant crystals containing synthetically made potassium alum were found to be a weak irritant to the skin. Unscented deodorant is available for those with sensitive skin. Frequent use of deodorants was associated with blood concentrations of the synthetic musk galaxolide.

=== Aluminum ===

Many deodorants and antiperspirants contain aluminium in the form of aluminium salts such as aluminium chlorohydrate.

The US Food and Drug Administration, in a 2003 paper discussing deodorant safety, concluded that &quot;despite many investigators looking at this issue, the agency does not find data from topical and inhalation chronic exposure animal and human studies submitted to date sufficient to change the monograph status of aluminum containing antiperspirants&quot;, therefore allowing their use and stating they will keep monitoring the scientific literature. Members of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) of the European Commission concluded similarly in 2015, that &quot;due to the lack of adequate data on dermal penetration to estimate the internal dose of aluminium following cosmetic uses, risk assessment cannot be performed.&quot; In the light of new data in 2020 the SCCS considered aluminium compounds safe up to 6.25% in non-spray deodorants or non-spray antiperspirants and 10.60% in spray deodorants or spray antiperspirants.
==== Myths and claims related to aluminium compounds in deodorants====
Common myths and marketing claims for aluminium in deodorants (including aluminum in alum products) include claims:

* That aluminium in deodorants applied to the skin is a risk factor for some cancers (notably breast cancer) and some forms of dementia
* That aluminium in antiperspirants can enter the body (possibly through shaving cuts)
* That aluminium in alum &quot;natural deodorant&quot; products is &quot;safer&quot; because it is &quot;too large&quot; to enter the body

Of note, the parts of the body which are commonly shaved and also commonly treated with deodorants, such as the armpits, contain substantial deposits of subcutaneous fat. Shaving cuts would be extremely unlikely to penetrate sufficiently beyond the very outer layers of the skin, for much if any product to enter the bloodstream.

====Alzheimer&#x27;s disease====

A 2014 review of 469 peer-reviewed studies examining the effect of exposure to aluminum products concluded &quot;that health risks posed by exposure to inorganic depend on its physical and chemical forms and that the response varies with route of administration, magnitude, duration and frequency of exposure. These results support previous conclusions that there is little evidence that exposure to metallic Al, the Al oxides or its salts increases risk for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, genetic damage or cancer&quot;.

=== Breast cancer ===
The claim that breast cancer is believed to be linked with deodorant use has been widely circulated and appears to originate from a spam email sent in 1999; however, there is no evidence to support the existence of such a link. The myth circulates in two forms:

* &quot;Antiperspirants block the &quot;purging&quot; of toxins which build up in the body and cause breast cancer:&quot; As sweat glands simply do not have this function, the claim is scientifically implausible. Perspiration from the eccrine sweat glands is 99% water, with some salt (sodium chloride) and only trace amounts of lactic acid (almost entirely processed in the liver), urea (almost entirely excreted by the kidneys), and only very small amounts of all other components. Perspiration from the apocrine sweat glands (those in the armpits and groin, which are more responsible for body odor) also include waste proteins, carbohydrates, and fatty acids  which would otherwise be processed by other organs such as the liver.

It is possible that there has been confusion between sweat glands, and the lymph nodes deep within the armpits which form part of the immune system and help filter toxins, but if so, there is no evidence at all of such &quot;blocking&quot; of lymph nodes, nor any scientifically plausible route by which this could result from deodorant use.

* &quot;Aluminum in antiperspirants can enter the body (possibly through cuts) and cause breast cancer:&quot; There is no current evidence to support this claim, nor any convincing evidence that it is true. A fact often cited to back up this claim is that more breast cancers occur in the part of the breast near the armpits. However, breast tissue is not evenly spread out, and the part of the breast near the armpit (the Tail of Spence) simply contains much more breast tissue than the other quadrants, making it much more likely that any cancer would occur in that location. See above for current scientific knowledge regarding aluminum in deodorants.

The National Cancer Institute states that &quot;no scientific evidence links the use of these products to the development of breast cancer&quot; and that &quot;no clear evidence that the use of aluminum-containing underarm antiperspirants or cosmetics increases the risk of breast cancer&quot;, but also concludes that studies of antiperspirants and deodorants and breast cancer have provided conflicting results, additional research would be needed to determine whether a relationship exists&quot;.

Another constituent of deodorant products that has given cause for concern are parabens, a chemical additive. However parabens do not cause cancer.

=== Kidney dysfunction ===
The FDA has &quot;acknowledge[d] that small amounts of aluminum can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and through the skin&quot;, leading to a warning &quot;that people with kidney disease may not be aware that the daily use of antiperspirant drug products containing aluminum may put them at a higher risk because of exposure to aluminum in the product.&quot; The agency warns people with kidney dysfunction to consult a doctor before using antiperspirants containing aluminum.

=== Aerosol burns and frostbite ===
If aerosol deodorant is held close to the skin for long enough, it can cause an aerosol burn—a form of frostbite. In controlled tests, spray deodorants have been shown to cause temperature drops of over 60 °C in a short period of time.

== Clothing ==
Aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly, a common antiperspirant, can react with sweat to create yellow stains on clothing. Underarm liners are an antiperspirant alternative that does not leave stains.

<text>Harold Joseph &quot;Pie&quot; Traynor (November 11, 1898 – March 16, 1972) was an American third baseman, manager, scout and radio broadcaster in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played his entire career between 1920 and 1937 for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Traynor batted over .300 ten times, posting a career average of .320, and had seven seasons with over 100 runs batted in (RBI). With home runs limited by playing in Forbes Field, the most difficult park for power hitting in the National League (NL), he compensated by reaching double digits in triples eleven times, leading the league in 1923. He batted .346 in the 1925 World Series to help the Pirates take their first championship in 16 years.

Traynor led NL third basemen in putouts seven times, in double plays four times, and in assists three times; his 41 double plays in 1925 were an NL record until 1950, and his 226 putouts that year remain the highest NL total since 1905. He set major league records for career double plays (303) and games (1,863) at third base which were broken in 1945 and 1960 respectively, and which remained NL records until Eddie Mathews broke them in 1964 and 1965; his 2,289 putouts remain the NL record, and his 3,521 assists were the league record until Mathews passed him in 1964. Traynor was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1948, becoming the initial third baseman elected by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America.

Following World War II, Traynor was often cited as the greatest third baseman in major league history. In recent years his renown has diminished, with the modern-era careers of third basemen including Mathews, Brooks Robinson, Mike Schmidt and George Brett moving to the forefront in the memories of baseball fans; however, he is still widely regarded as the top third baseman in the National League prior to 1950.

==Early life==
Traynor was born in Framingham, Massachusetts, to parents who had emigrated from Canada. He received his nickname as a child in Somerville, Massachusetts, because he frequented a grocery store and often asked for pie. The store owner called him &quot;Pie Face&quot;, which was later shortened to Pie by his friends.

In 1919, he played in what is now the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). Playing for both the Falmouth and Oak Bluffs town teams, he batted .447 for Falmouth and had a combined batting average of .322 for the two teams. In 2009 he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==
Traynor began his professional baseball career in 1920 as a shortstop for the Portsmouth Truckers of the Virginia League. He was asked by a Boston Braves scout to work out with the team at Braves Field, but the scout forgot to tell Braves manager George Stallings. Stallings ran Traynor off the field, telling him not to return. Traynor made his major league debut with the Pittsburgh Pirates at the age of 21 on September 15, 1920, appearing in 17 games that season. He appeared in 10 games for the Pirates in 1921, but spent the majority of the season playing for the Birmingham Barons. He posted a .336 batting average in 131 games for the Barons, but he committed 64 errors as a shortstop.

Traynor became the Pirates&#x27; regular third baseman in 1922, hitting for a .282 batting average with 81 runs batted in. Following the advice of Rogers Hornsby, he began using a heavier bat in 1923 and blossomed into one of the best hitters in the National League (NL) . He hit above .300 for the first time with a .338 batting average along with 12 home runs and 101 runs batted in. With tutoring provided by teammate Rabbit Maranville, his defense also began to improve, leading National League third basemen in putouts and assists.

In 1925, Traynor posted a .320 average with six home runs, 106 runs batted in and led the league in fielding percentage as the Pirates won the NL pennant by games over the New York Giants. In the 1925 World Series, he hit .346 including a home run off future Hall of Fame pitcher Walter Johnson as the Pirates defeated the Washington Senators in a seven-game series. Traynor ended the season eighth in Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award balloting. His 41 double plays in 1925 set an NL record for third basemen that stood for 25 years.

The Pirates won the pennant again in 1927 with Traynor hitting .342 with five home runs and 106 runs batted in, but they lost to the New York Yankees in the 1927 World Series. In November of that year, members of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America selected him as the third baseman for the 1927 all-star major league team. Traynor hit .337 and produced a career-high 124 runs batted in during the 1928 season despite hitting only three home runs and finished in sixth place in the NL MVP Award balloting. He continued to be a cornerstone for the Pirates, posting a .356 batting average in 1929.

Traynor hit for a career-high .366 average in 1930. A different baseball was used in MLB in 1931, and Traynor&#x27;s batting average decreased to .298. Despite the decline in his average, Traynor supported the use of the new ball, saying that the 1930 ball had caused too large of an advantage for hitters and had led to lopsided games that had ultimately decreased interest in the sport. In 1933 MLB held its inaugural All-Star Game and, Traynor was selected as a reserve player for the NL team.

Traynor&#x27;s last full season was in 1934 when he hit over .300 for the ninth time in ten seasons, and was named as the starting third baseman for the NL in the 1934 All-Star Game. During the 1934 season, his throwing arm was injured in a play at home plate and his defense began to suffer as a result. Traynor played his final game on August 14, 1937.

==Career statistics==
In a 17-year major league career, Traynor played in 1,941 games, accumulating 2,416 hits in 7,559 at bats for a .320 career batting average along with 58 home runs, 1,273 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .362. He retired with a .946 fielding percentage. Traynor reached a high of 12 home runs in 1923; he had higher numbers of doubles and triples, hitting 371 doubles and 164 triples lifetime and leading the league in triples in 1923, with 19. He hit over .300 ten times and had over 100 runs batted in (RBI) in a season seven times. Traynor accumulated 6 five-hit games and 39 four-hit games in his MLB career. Among major league third basemen, his seven seasons with more than 100 runs batted in is second only to the nine seasons by Mike Schmidt. Chipper Jones is the only other third baseman in history to match Traynor&#x27;s five consecutive seasons with more than 100 runs batted in. He had 208 hits in 1923, and was the last Pirate infielder with 200 or more hits until shortstop Jack Wilson, who had 201 hits in 2004. He struck out only 278 times in his career.

Traynor was considered the best fielding third baseman of his era, leading the National League in fielding percentage once, assists and double plays three times and putouts seven times. His 2,289 putouts ranks him fifth all-time among third basemen. His 1,863 games played at third base was a major league record that stood until 1960 when it was surpassed by Eddie Yost. Traynor is the only MLB player to steal home plate in an All-Star Game. Traynor finished in the top ten in voting for the NL&#x27;s MVP Award six times during his career.

==Managing career==

Traynor became the Pirates&#x27; player-manager during the 1934 season. He retired as an active player after the 1937 season, but continued as the Pirates&#x27; manager. Traynor almost won another pennant, as a manager in 1938, as the Pirates led the NL for most of the season before faltering to the Chicago Cubs in the famous &quot;Homer in the Gloamin&#x27;&quot; game at Wrigley Field. The loss of the pennant devastated Traynor. He seemed to lose confidence in his team, and after a sixth-place finish in 1939, he resigned after five seasons as the manager of the Pirates.

==Post-retirement and legacy==
After spending time as a scout for the Pirates, Traynor eventually took a job as a sports director for a Pittsburgh radio station in 1944. His radio broadcasts became popular with Pittsburgh sports fans and he remained at the job for 21 years. Traynor retired from broadcasting in 1965. In 1948, Traynor was selected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, being the first third baseman to be chosen by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America. In 1969, as part of the observance of the centennial of professional baseball, Traynor was named the third baseman on MLB&#x27;s all-time team. In 1971, he threw out the first pitch of Game 3 of the 1971 World Series at Three Rivers Stadium. He died in 1972 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, not long after the Pirates moved into Three Rivers Stadium. His #20 was retired posthumously at the Pirates home opener on April 18, 1972. Traynor was buried in Homewood Cemetery in Pittsburgh.

In 1999, he ranked number 70 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Baseball historian Bill James ranked Traynor 15th all-time among third baseman in his Historical Baseball Abstract.

The television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; made a brief visual reference to Traynor in the 1992 episode &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;, where Mr. Burns had slotted him to play third base for Mr. Burns&#x27; nuclear power plant&#x27;s all-star softball team. His assistant Smithers has to point out that all of the players Mr. Burns had selected have long since retired and died.

The sketch comedy series &quot;Second City Television&quot; (&quot;SCTV&quot;) contains a character of a burlesque dancer named &quot;Honey Pie&quot; Traynor, in likely homage to Traynor.

<text>Marie Eugène François Thomas Dubois (; 28January 185816December 1940) was a Dutch paleoanthropologist and geologist. He earned worldwide fame for his discovery of &quot;Pithecanthropus erectus&quot; (later redesignated &quot;Homo erectus&quot;), or &quot;Java Man&quot;. Although hominid fossils had been found and studied before, Dubois was the first anthropologist to embark upon a purposeful search for them.

== Life and work ==

Dubois was born and raised in the village of Eijsden, Limburg, where his father, Jean Joseph Balthazar Dubois, an immigrant from Thimister-Clermont, Liège, Belgium, was an apothecary, later the mayor. Interested in all phenomena of the world of nature, Eugène explored the &quot;caves&quot; (&quot;grotten&quot;, actually underground limestone mines) of Mount Saint Peter and amassed collections of plant parts, stones, insects, shells, and animal skulls. From age 12-13 on, he attended school in the Limburg city of Roermond, boarding with a family there and then he dropped out. In Roermond he attended lectures on Charles Darwin&#x27;s new theory of evolution given by the German biologist, Carl Vogt.

Resisting his father&#x27;s plan for him to train to follow in his footsteps, Dubois, encouraged by his teachers, decided in 1877 to study medicine at the University of Amsterdam. While a student, he taught anatomy at both of the brand new (founded 1880) art schools housed at the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam (Amsterdam State Museum) the Rijksschool voor Kunstnijverheid (State School for Applied Arts) and the Rijksnormaalschool voor Teekenonderwijzers (State Normal School for Drawing Instructors). In 1884 he completed his medical degree. He declined an offer from the University of Utrecht of a position as a docent. Instead, at the invitation of his anatomy instructor, Max Fürbringer, he decided to train as an academic. From 1881 to 1887 he studied comparative anatomy and became Fürbringer&#x27;s assistant. In 1885 he investigated the larynx of vertebrates, which led him to develop a hypothesis of the evolution of this organ. Nevertheless, his chief interest was in human evolution, influenced by Ernst Haeckel, who reasoned that there must be intermediate species between ape and human.

Dubois contributed an article on whale anatomy to a book by the Dutch zoologist, Max Weber, and, inspired by the fresh discovery of new Neanderthal fossils at the Belgian town of Spy, he spent his vacation fossil hunting in the vicinity of his birthplace. In the Henkeput near the village of Rijckholt, where a prehistoric flint mine had just been discovered in 1881, he found some prehistoric human skulls.

Reasoning that the origins of the human species must be in the tropics, in 1887 he joined the Dutch army and arranged to be posted in the Dutch East Indies (the Dutch colony that is now independent Indonesia), to the dismay of his academic colleagues. With his wife and newborn daughter he moved to the colony to search for the missing link in human evolution. (He was unalterably convinced there was only one missing link.)

=== Hominid discoveries ===
Between 1887 and 1895, Dubois searched at potential sites near rivers and in caves, first on the island of Sumatra, then on the Indonesian island of Java.

In 1891, Dubois discovered remains of what he described as &quot;a species in between humans and apes&quot;. He called his finds &quot;Pithecanthropus erectus&quot; (&quot;ape-human that stands upright&quot;) or Java Man. Today, they are classified as &quot;Homo erectus&quot; (&quot;human that stands upright&quot;). These were the first specimens of early hominid remains to be found outside of Africa or Europe. During this period Dubois carried out fieldwork at sites such as Sangiran in Central Java and Trinil in East Java.

=== Later years ===
In 1897, the University of Amsterdam awarded Dubois an honorary doctorate in botany and zoology, but he had to wait until 1899 for a professorship. In that year, he was appointed a professor in geology, a function that did not keep him from his research in anatomy. He was also (from 1897 until 1928) keeper of paleontology, geology and mineralogy at Teylers Museum, where he also kept the &quot;H. erectus&quot; remains.

In 1919, he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Although the scientific debate slowly began to turn in his favour in the 1920s and 1930s, he died embittered in 1940. He was buried in unconsecrated ground on 16 December 1940 in Venlo, &quot;Algemene Begraafplaats&quot;, grave number NH2\26\-\BR.

== Legacy ==
His paleontological collection and scientific archive remain at Naturalis in Leiden. The institute dedicated an exhibition to his findings of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; in their renovated museum, where the holotype Trinil 2 is on display. According to Pat Shipman, adjunct professor of anthropology at Pennsylvania State University, Dubois was &quot;an extremely influential person in founding paleo-anthropology. He not only found the fossils. He analyzed them in wholly new ways. He pulled human fossils out of this context of racial identification and shoved it into an evolutionary context and that was a real revolution.&quot; A special section of Museum Het Ursulinenconvent - International Museum for Family History is devoted to Dubois&#x27; life and work. Asteroid 206241 Dubois, discovered by the NEAT program in 2002, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 7 June 2009 ().

<doc id="318900" wikidata="Q732282" url="?curid=318900" title="Ennin">
<text>, better known in Japan by his posthumous name, Jikaku Daishi (), was a priest of the Tendai school of Buddhism in Japan, and its third . Ennin was instrumental in expanding the Tendai Order&#x27;s influence, and bringing back crucial training and resources from China, particularly esoteric Buddhist training and Pure Land teachings.

== Birth and origin ==

He was born into the Mibu () family in present-day Tochigi Prefecture, Japan and entered the Buddhist priesthood at Enryaku-ji on Mt. Hiei (Hieizan) near Kyoto at the age of 14.

== Trip to China ==
In 838, Ennin was in the party which accompanied Fujiwara no Tsunetsugu&#x27;s diplomatic mission to the Tang dynasty Imperial court. The trip to China marked the beginning of a set of tribulations and adventures which he documented in his journal. The journal describes an account of the workings of the government of China, which saw strong and able administrative control of the state and its provinces, even at a time of a supposed decline of the Tang dynasty. His writings also expanded on religious matters and commerce. He stayed in Xi&#x27;an for five years.

Initially, he studied under two masters and then spent some time at Wutaishan (; Japanese: &quot;Godaisan&quot;), a mountain range famous for its numerous Buddhist temples in Shanxi Province in China. Here, he learned among other practices. Later he went to Chang&#x27;an (Japanese: Chōan), then the capital of China, where he was ordained into both mandala rituals: the Mahāvairocana-sūtra and the Vajraśekhara-sūtra, along with initiation and training in the Susiddhikara Sūtra tantra. He also wrote of his travels by ship while sailing along the Grand Canal of China.

Ennin was in China when the anti-Buddhist Emperor Wuzong of Tang took the throne in 840, and he lived through the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution of 842–846. As a result of the persecution, he was deported from China, returning to Japan in 847.

== Return to Japan ==
In 847 he returned to Japan and in 854, he became the third abbot of the Tendai sect at Enryakuji, where he built buildings to store the sutras and religious instruments he brought back from China. His dedication to expanding the monastic complex and its courses of study assured the Tendai school a unique prominence in Japan. While his chief contribution was to strengthen the Tendai tantric Buddhist tradition, the Pure Land recitation practices (&quot;nenbutsu&quot;) that he introduced also helped to lay a foundation for the independent Pure Land movements of the subsequent Kamakura period (1185–1333). Ennin also founded the temple of Ryushakuji at Yamadera.

== Literary work ==
He wrote more than one hundred books. His diary of travels in China, , was translated into English by Professor Edwin O. Reischauer under the title &quot;Ennin&#x27;s Diary: The Record of a Pilgrimage to China in Search of the Law&quot;. Sometimes ranked among the best travelogues in world literature, it is a key source of information on life in Tang China and Silla Korea and offers a rare glimpse of the Silla personality Jang Bogo.

<text>Public art is art in any media whose form, function and meaning are created for the general public through a public process. It is a specific art genre with its own professional and critical discourse. Public art is visually and physically accessible to the public; it is installed in public space in both outdoor and indoor settings. Public art seeks to embody public or universal concepts rather than commercial, partisan, or personal concepts or interests. Notably, public art is also the direct or indirect product of a public process of creation, procurement, and/or maintenance.

Independent art created or staged in or near the public realm (for example, graffiti, street art) lacks official or tangible public sanction has not been recognized as part of the public art genre, however this attitude is changing due to the efforts of several street artists. Such unofficial artwork may exist on private or public property immediately adjacent to the public realm, or in natural settings but, however ubiquitous, it sometimes falls outside the definition of public art by its absence of public process or public sanction as &quot;bona fide&quot; public art.

== Characteristics of public art ==

Common characteristics of public art are public accessibility, public realm placement, community involvement, public process (including public funding); these works can be permanent or temporary. According to the curator and art/architecture historian, Mary Jane Jacob, public art brings art closer to life.

=== Public accessibility: placement in public space/public realm ===
Public art is publicly accessible, both physically and/or visually. When public art is installed on privately owned property, general public access rights still exist.

Public art is characterized by site specificity, where the artwork is &quot;created in response to the place and community in which it resides&quot; and by the relationship between its content and the public. Cher Krause Knight states that &quot;art&#x27;s publicness rests in the quality and impact of its exchange with audiences ... at its most public, art extends opportunities for community engagement but cannot demand particular conclusion,&quot; it introduces social ideas but leaves room for the public to come to their own conclusions.

=== Public process, public funding ===

Public art is often characterized by community involvement and collaboration. Public artists and organizations often work in conjunction with architects, fabricators/construction workers, community residents and leaders, designers, funding organizations, and others.

Public art is often created and provided within formal &quot;art in public places&quot; programs that can include community arts education and art performance. Such programs may be financed by government entities through Percent for Art initiatives.

=== Longevity ===
Some public art is planned and designed for stability and permanence. Its placement in, or exposure to, the physical public realm requires both safe and durable materials. Public artworks are designed to withstand the elements (sun, wind, water) as well as human activity. In the United States, unlike gallery, studio, or museum artworks, which can be transferred or sold, public art is legally protected by the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 (VARA) which requires an official deaccession process for sale or removal.

== Forms of public art ==

The following forms of public art identify to what extent public art may be physically integrated with the immediate context or environment. These forms, which can overlap, employ different &quot;types&quot; of public art that suit a particular form of environment integration.

* stand alone: for example, sculptures, statues, structures
* integrated (into façades, pavements, or landscapes): for example, bas reliefs, Hill figure, Geoglyph, Petroglyph, mosaics, digital lighting
* applied (to a surface): for example, murals, building-mounted sculptures
* installation (where artwork and site are mutually embedded): for example, transit station art
* ephemeral (or non-permanent): performances, temporary installations: for example, a precarious rock balance or an instance of colored smoke.

== History of public art ==

=== United States, 20th century ===
In the 1930s, the production of national symbolism implied by 19th century monuments began being regulated by long-term national programs with propaganda goals (Federal Art Project, United States; Cultural Office, Soviet Union). Programs like President Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal facilitated the development of public art during the Great Depression but was wrought with propaganda goals. New Deal art programs were intended to develop national pride in American culture while avoiding addressing the faltering economy. Although problematic, New Deal art programs such as FAP altered the relationship between the artist and society by making art accessible to all people. The New Deal program Art-in-Architecture (A-i-A) developed percent for art programs, a structure for funding public art still utilized today. This program allotted one half of one percent of total construction costs of all government buildings to the purchase of contemporary American art for them. A-i-A helped solidify the policy that public art in the United States should be truly owned by the public. It also promoted site-specific public art.

The approach to public art radically changed during the 1970s, following the civil rights movement&#x27;s claims on public space, the alliance between urban regeneration programs and artistic efforts at the end of the 1960s, and revised ideas of sculpture. Public art acquired a status beyond mere decoration and visualization of official national histories in public space. Public art became much more about the public. This perspective was reinforced in the 1970s by urban cultural policies, for example the New York-based Public Art Fund and urban or regional Percent for Art programs in the United States and Europe. Moreover, public art discourse shifted from a national to a local level, consistent with the site-specific trend and criticism of institutional exhibition spaces emerging in contemporary art practices.

=== Environmental public art ===
Between the 1970s and the 1980s, gentrification and ecological issues surfaced in public art practice both as a commission motive and as a critical focus by artists. The individual, Romantic retreat element implied in the conceptual structure of land art, and its will to reconnect the urban environment with nature, is turned into a political claim in projects such as &quot;Wheatfield – A Confrontation&quot; (1982) by American artist Agnes Denes, as well as in Joseph Beuys’ &quot;7000 Oaks&quot; (1982). Both projects focus on the increase of ecological awareness through a green urban design process, bringing Denes to plant a two-acre field of wheat in downtown Manhattan and Beuys to plant 7000 oaks coupled with basalt blocks in Kassel, Germany in a guerrilla or community garden fashion. In recent years, programs of green urban regeneration aiming at converting abandoned lots into green areas regularly include public art programs. This is the case for High Line Art, 2009, a commission program for the High Line, derived from the conversion of a portion of railroad in New York City; and of Gleisdreieck, 2012, an urban park derived from the partial conversion of a railway station in Berlin which hosts, since 2012, an open-air contemporary art exhibition.

The 1980s also witnessed the institutionalization of sculpture parks as curated programs. While the first public and private open-air sculpture exhibitions and collections dating back to the 1930s aimed at creating an appropriate setting for large-scale sculptural forms difficult to show in museum galleries, installations such as Noguchi&#x27;s Garden in Queens, New York (1985) reflect the necessity of a permanent relationship between the artwork and its site.

This relationship also develops in Donald Judd’s project for the Chinati Foundation (1986) in Texas, which advocates for the permanent nature of large-scale installations whose fragility may be destroyed when re-locating the work.

=== Sustainability and public art ===
 Public art faces a design challenge by its very nature: how best to activate the images in its surroundings. The concept of &quot;sustainability&quot; arises in response to the perceived environmental deficiencies of a city. Sustainable development, promoted by the United Nations since the 1980s, includes economical, social, and ecological aspects. A sustainable public art work would include plans for urban regeneration and disassembly. Sustainability has been widely adopted in many environmental planning and engineering projects. Sustainable art is a challenge to respond the needs of an opening space in public.

In another public artwork titled &quot;Mission leopard&quot; was commissioned in 2016 in Haryana, India, among the remote deciduous terrain of Tikli village a team coordinated by Artist Hunny Mor painted two leopards perched on branches on a water source tank 115 feet high. The campaign was aimed to spread awareness on co-habitation and environmental conservation. The art work can be seen from several miles across in all directions.

Ron Finley&#x27;s work as the Gangsta Gardener (or Guerrilla Gardener) of South Central L.A. is an example of an artist whose works constitute temporary public art works in the form of public food gardens that addresses sustainability, food security and food justice.

Andrea Zittel has produced works, such as &quot;Indianapolis Island&quot; that reference sustainability and permaculture with which participants can actively engage.

=== Interactive public art ===

Some public art is designed to encourage direct hands-on interaction. Examples include public art that contain interactive musical, light, video, or water components. For example, the architectural centerpiece in front of the Ontario Science Centre is a fountain and musical instrument (hydraulophone) by Steve Mann where people can produce sounds by blocking water jets to force water through sound-producing mechanisms. An early and unusual interactive public artwork was Jim Pallas&#x27; 1980 C&quot;entury of Light&quot; in Detroit, Michigan of a large outdoor mandala of lights that reacted in complex ways to sounds and movements detected by radar (mistakenly destroyed 25 years later). Another example is Rebecca Hackemann&#x27;s two works &quot;The Public Utteraton Machines&quot; of 2015 and &quot;The Urban Field Glass Project / Visionary Sightseeing Binoculars 2&quot;008, 20013, 2021, 2022. The Public Utteraton Machines records people&#x27;s opinions of other public art in New York, such as Jeff Koon&#x27;s Split Rocker and displays responses online. 
=== New genre public art ===
In the 1990s, some artists called for artistic social intervention in public space. These efforts employed the term &quot;new genre public art&quot; in addition to the terms &quot;contextual art&quot;, &quot;relational art&quot;, &quot;participatory art&quot;, &quot;dialog art&quot;, &quot;community-based art&quot;, and &quot;activist art&quot;. &quot;New genre public art&quot; is defined by Suzanne Lacy as &quot;socially engaged, interactive art for diverse audiences with connections to identity politics and social activism&quot;. Mel Chin&#x27;s Fundred Dollar Bill Project is an example of an interactive, social activist public art project. Rather than metaphorically reflecting social issues, new genre public art strove to explicitly empower marginalized groups while maintaining aesthetic appeal. An example was curator Mary Jane Jacob&#x27;s 1993 public art show &quot;Culture in Action&quot; that investigated social systems though engagement with audiences that typically did not visit traditional art museums.

In the 21st Century public art has often been a significant component of public realm projects in UK cities and towns, often via engagement with local residents where artists will work with the community in developing an idea or sourcing content to be featured in the artwork. Examples would include Adrian Riley&#x27;s &#x27;Come Follow Me&#x27; in Minster in Lincolnshire where a 35m long text artwork in the public square outside the town&#x27;s Minster includes local residents own stories alongside official civic history and the town&#x27;s origin myth.

=== Curated public art ===

The term &quot;curated public art&quot; is used to define the way of producing public art that significantly takes into account the context, the process and the different actors involved. It defines itself slightly differently from top-down approaches of direct commissioning.

If it mainly designates the fact that a curator conducts and supervises the realization of a public art work for a third party, it can also mean that the art work is produced by a community or public who commissions a work in collaboration with a curator-mediator.

For the first, significant examples of these prospective manners of commissioning art projects have been established by the Public Art Fund launched by Doris C. Freedman in 1977, with a new approach in the way the percent for art was used, or the public art funds of Geneva with the Neon Parallax project involving a very large urban environnement in 2005.

For the second one can refer to &quot;Les Nouveaux Commanditaires&quot; launched by Fondation de France with François Hers in 1990 with the idea a project can respond to a community&#x27;s wish. The New York High Line from 2009 is a good example although less art is involved. The doual&#x27;art project in Douala (Cameroon, 1991) is based on a commissioning system that brings together the community, the artist and the commissioning institution for the realization of the project.

=== Memorial public art ===
Memorials for individuals, groups of people or events are sometimes represented through public art. Examples are Maya Lin&#x27;s Vietnam War Memorial in Washington DC, Tim Tate&#x27;s AIDS Monument in New Orleans, and Kenzō Tange&#x27;s &quot;Cenotaph for the A-bomb Victims&quot; in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Japan.

== Controversies ==
Public art is sometimes controversial. The following public art controversies have been notable:

*Detroit&#x27;s Heidelberg Project was controversial for several decades since its inception in 1986 due to its garish appearance.
*Richard Serra&#x27;s minimalist piece &quot;Tilted Arc&quot; was removed from Foley Square in New York City in 1989 after office workers complained their work routine was disrupted by the piece. A public court hearing ruled against continued display of the work.
*Victor Pasmore&#x27;s &quot;Apollo Pavilion&quot; in the English New Town of Peterlee has been a focus for local politicians and other groups complaining about the governance of the town and allocation of resources. Artists and cultural leaders mounted a campaign to rehabilitate the reputation of the work with the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art commissioning artists Jane and Louise Wilson to make a video installation about the piece in 2003.
* Sam Durant&#x27;s &quot;Scaffold&quot; (2017), installed in the Walker Art Center&#x27;s garden represented the gallows used in seven government hangings. Native American groups found the work offensive, as 38 Dakota people had been hung at Mankato, Minnesota. The artist agreed to dismantle and permit the tribal elders to burn and bury the piece.
*Maurice Agis&#x27; &quot;Dreamspace V&quot;, a huge inflatable maze erected in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, killed two women and seriously injured a three-year-old girl in 2006 when a strong wind broke its moorings and carried it into the air, with thirty people trapped inside.
* Ron Robertson-Swann&#x27;s &quot;Vault&quot;, an abstract yellow polygonal structure erected in Melbourne City Square was considered so visually offensive that it was moved several times and referred by much of the public by the racist colour metaphor &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;.
* There have been numerous controversies regarding monuments in the United States, many of which have to do with public monuments dedicated to soldiers and leaders of the Confederate States of America following the American Civil War.

==Online documentation==
Online databases of local and regional public art emerged in the 1990s and 2000s in tandem with the development of web-based data. Online public art databases can be general or selective (limited to sculptures or murals), and they can be governmental, quasi-governmental, or independent. Some online databases, such as the Smithsonian American Art Museum&#x27;s Archives of American Art. It currently holds over six thousand works in its database.

There are dozens of non-government organizations and educational institutions that maintain online public art databases of public artworks covering numerous areas, including the National Endowment for the Arts, WESTAF, Public Art Fund, Creative Time, and others. Public Art Online, maintains a database of public art works, essays and case studies, with a focus on the UK. The Institute for Public Art, based in the UK, maintains information about public art on six continents.

The project began in 2009 and strove to document public art around the globe. While this project received initial attention from the academic community, it mainly relied on temporary student contributions. Its status is currently unknown.

<text>Linda Jean Barry (born January 2, 1956), known professionally as Lynda Barry, is an American cartoonist. Barry is best known for her weekly comic strip &quot;Ernie Pook&#x27;s Comeek&quot;. She garnered attention with her 1988 illustrated novel &quot;The Good Times are Killing Me&quot;, about an interracial friendship between two young girls, which was adapted into a play. Her second illustrated novel, &quot;Cruddy&quot;, first appeared in 1999. Three years later she published &quot;One! Hundred! Demons!&quot;, a graphic novel she terms &quot;autobifictionalography&quot;. &quot;What It Is&quot; (2008) is a graphic novel that is part memoir, part collage and part workbook, in which Barry instructs her readers in methods to open up their own creativity; it won the comics industry&#x27;s 2009 Eisner Award for Best Reality-Based Work.

In recognition of her contributions to the comic art form, ComicsAlliance listed Barry as one of twelve women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition, and she received the Wisconsin Visual Art Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013. In July 2016, she was inducted into the Eisner Hall of Fame. Barry was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship as part of the Class of 2019. She is currently an Associate Professor of Interdisciplinary Creativity at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

In 2020, her work was included in the exhibit &quot;Women in Comics: Looking Forward, Looking Back&quot; at the Society of Illustrators in New York City.

==Early life and education==
Linda Jean Barry, who changed her first name to &quot;Lynda&quot; at age 12, was born on Highway 14 in Richland Center, Wisconsin.

Her father was a meat-cutter of Irish and Norwegian descent, and her mother, a hospital housekeeper, was of Irish and Filipino descent. Barry grew up in Seattle, Washington, in a racially mixed working-class neighborhood, and recalls her childhood as difficult and awkward. Her parents divorced when she was 12. By age 16, she was working nights as a janitor at a Seattle hospital while still attending high school, where her classmates included artist Charles Burns. Neither of Barry&#x27;s parents attended her graduation. Her mother strongly disapproved of Lynda&#x27;s love of books and desire to go to college; she said they were a waste of time, and that it was time for Lynda to get a job.

At The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, Barry met fellow cartoonist Matt Groening. Her career began in 1977 when Groening and &quot;University of Washington Daily&quot; student editor John Keister each published her work without her knowledge in their respective student newspapers, titling it &quot;Ernie Pook&#x27;s Comeek&quot;.

==Career==
===Comics===
Barry was known as the class cartoonist in her grade school.

While studying fine arts at Evergreen State College, she began drawing comic strips compulsively when her boyfriend left her for another girl: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t sleep after that, and I started making comic strips about men and women. The men were cactuses and the women were women, and the cactuses were trying to convince the women to go to bed with them, and the women were constantly thinking it over but finally deciding it wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea.&quot; Her first comic strip was created in 1977 and published in the Evergreen State College newspaper. These were the cartoons Groening and Keister published as &quot;Ernie Pook&#x27;s Comeek&quot;. Barry also credits her start in comics to Evergreen State professor Marilyn Frasca, saying, &quot;The lessons I learned from her when I was 19 and 20, I still use every day and have never been able to wear out.&quot;

After graduating from Evergreen, Barry returned to Seattle. When she was 23, the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; picked up her comic strip, enabling her to make a living from her comics alone. She later moved to Chicago, Illinois. As she described her career start:

Collections of her work include &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; (1981), &quot;Big Ideas&quot; (1983), &quot;Everything in the World&quot; (1986), &quot;The Fun House&quot; (1987), &quot;Down the Street&quot; (1989), and &quot;The Greatest of Marlys&quot; (2000). In 1984, she released a coloring book with brief text called &quot;Naked Ladies! Naked Ladies! Naked Ladies!&quot; She also wrote and drew a full-page color strip examining the everyday pathology of relationships for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, starting in 1983 with the strip &quot;The Story of Men and Women&quot;. In 1989 Barry&#x27;s strip appeared weekly in more than 50 publications, mostly alternative newspapers in large cities.

Barry has described her process as developing a story while working, not planning it out in advance. In answering a question about her book &quot;What It Is&quot; in an interview with Michael Dean for &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, Barry said:

Due to the loss of weekly newspaper clients, Barry moved her comics primarily online by 2007.

===Books===
Commercially published collections of Barry&#x27;s comics began appearing in 1981 . Her limited edition self published Xerox book called &quot;Two Sisters&quot; about sisters Evette and Rita was published in 1979. She has written two illustrated novels, &quot;The Good Times Are Killing Me&quot; (1988) and &quot;Cruddy&quot;, also known as &quot;Cruddy: An Illustrated Novel&quot; (1999).

&quot;Cruddy&quot; is written in the voice of a fictional girl named Roberta Rohbeson, who describes her home as &quot;the cruddy top bedroom of a cruddy rental house on a very cruddy mud road&quot; and who ends up in a string of violent adventures with her father. Barry addressed the violence in the book in an interview with Hillary Chute in &quot;The Believer&quot;, saying:

The book was well regarded by critics. Alanna Nash wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;the author&#x27;s ability to capture the paralyzing bleakness of despair, and her uncanny ear for dialogue, make this first novel a work of terrible beauty.&quot; In &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, Stephen MacMillan Moser wrote a review in the form of a letter to Barry, saying &quot;You blew me away. Sometimes I wasn&#x27;t sure if something was supposed to be funny or not, but I laughed a lot. But I also feel like I got run over by a bus.&quot; In 2013, English professor Ellen E. Berry published a paper focused on the novel titled &quot;Becoming‐Girl/Becoming‐Fly/Becoming‐Imperceptible: Gothic Posthumanism in Lynda Barry&#x27;s &quot;Cruddy: An Illustrated Novel.&quot;&quot; Berry wrote in her summary of the paper that the book is &quot;a vivid example of what I call &#x27;gothic posthumanism&#x27; in which gothic themes and tropes serve to advance an extensive critique of anthropo‐ and other centrisms, all forms of domination, the values of liberal humanism and affirmative conformist culture.&quot; Berry analyzes Cruddy using a theory of posthuman ethics articulated by Rosi Braidotti, writing that she used Braidotti&#x27;s theory &quot;to analyze Roberta&#x27;s survival strategies and her radically posthuman identification with animals centering on their shared vulnerability and thus their shared goal: to disappear and to survive.&quot;

Barry adapted &quot;The Good Times are Killing Me&quot; as an Off-Broadway play (see below).

&quot;One! Hundred! Demons!&quot; first appeared as a serialized comic on Salon.com; according to the book&#x27;s introduction, it was produced in emulation of an old Zen painting exercise called &quot;one hundred demons&quot;. In this exercise, the practitioner awaits the arrival of demons and then paints them as they arise in the mind. The demons Barry wrestles with in this book include regret, abusive relationships, self-consciousness, the prohibition against feeling hate, and her response to the results of the 2000 U.S. presidential election. The book contains an instructional section that encourages readers to take up the brush and follow her example. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, the book uses &quot;acutely-observed humor to explore the pain of growing up.&quot;

Barry has also published four books about the creative processes of writing and drawing. &quot;Making Comics&quot;, &quot;What It Is&quot;, &quot;Picture This&quot;, and &quot;Syllabus: Notes From an Accidental Professor&quot; focus on opening pathways to personal creativity. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; gave &quot;Syllabus&quot; a starred review, calling it &quot;an excellent guide for those seeking to break out of whatever writing and drawing styles they have been stuck in, allowing them to reopen their brains to the possibility of new creativity.&quot; The AV Club named &quot;Syllabus&quot; one of the best comics of 2014.

===Other media===
Barry adapted her illustrated novel &quot;The Good Times are Killing Me&quot; (1988) as an off-Broadway play that had 106 performances from March 26 to June 23, 1991, at the McGinn-Cazale Theatre at 2162 Broadway, and 136 performances from July 30 to November 24, 1991, at the Minetta Lane Theatre. It was directed by Mark Brokaw and produced by Second Stage Theatre, with the Minetta Lane portion produced by Concert Productions International. Angela Goethals won a 1990–91 Obie Award for her lead role as Edna Arkins. Chandra Wilson as Bonna Willis won a 1991 Theatre World Award. Barry was nominated for the 1992 Outer Critics Circle&#x27;s John Gassner Award.

In its March–April 1991 issue, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; published Barry&#x27;s essay &quot;War&quot;, which protested the first Gulf War: &quot;War becomes part of our DNA...How dare anyone purposefully bring it into our lives when other options remain?&quot; Barry had previously read the essay on Chicago Public Radio&#x27;s program &quot;The Wild Room&quot;, which she co-hosted with Ira Glass and Gary Covino.

===Workshops and teaching===

Barry offers a workshop titled &quot;Writing the Unthinkable&quot; through the Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, New York, and The Crossings in Austin, Texas, in which she teaches the process she uses to create all of her work. Barry conducts approximately 15 writing workshops around the country each year. She credits her teacher, Marilyn Frasca at The Evergreen State College, with teaching her these creativity and writing techniques. Many of these techniques appear in her book &quot;What It Is&quot;. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article about her writing workshops summed up her technique: &quot;Barry isn&#x27;t particularly interested in the writer&#x27;s craft. She&#x27;s more interested in where ideas come from—and her goal is to help people tap into what she considers to be an innate creativity.&quot;

In the spring term of 2012, Barry was artist in residence at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Arts Institute and Department of Art. She taught a class, &quot;What It Is: Manually Shifting the Image&quot;.

She joined the faculty of University of Wisconsin–Madison in 2013 as an assistant professor in the art department and through the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery. During September 24–28, 2012, Barry was the artist in residence at Capilano University in North Vancouver, British Columbia.

== Other associates ==

As of 2013, singer and friend Kelly Hogan was working as an assistant for Barry, helping her arrange her teaching schedule. In one episode of Barry&#x27;s &quot;Ernie Pook&#x27;s Comeek&quot;, children are peering in a window of the Hideout nightclub in Chicago, listening to Hogan&#x27;s band The Wooden Leg.

==Personal life==
For a time, Barry dated public-radio personality Ira Glass. She briefly joined him in Washington, D.C., but a few months later, in the summer of 1989, she moved to Chicago to be near fellow cartoonists. Glass followed her there. Reflecting on the relationship, she called it the &quot;worst thing I ever did,&quot; and said he told her she &quot;was boring and shallow, and...wasn&#x27;t enough in the moment for him.&quot; She later drew a comic based on their relationship titled &quot;Head Lice and My Worst Boyfriend&quot;, which was later included in her book &quot;One! Hundred! Demons!...&quot; Glass has not denied her assertions, and told the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, &quot;I was an idiot. I was in the wrong...About so many things with her. Anything bad she says about me I can confirm.&quot;

Barry is married to Kevin Kawula, a prairie restoration expert. They met while she was an artist in residence at the Ragdale Foundation and he was land manager of the Lake Forest Open Lands project in Lake Forest, Illinois. In 2002 they moved to a dairy farm near Footville, Wisconsin.

Barry is an outspoken critic of wind turbines and has lobbied the Wisconsin government for clearer zoning regulations for turbines being built in residential areas. She has also spoken out about wind power&#x27;s problems with noise pollution, human health, and efficiency as related to variability.

In 1994, Barry suffered a near-fatal case of dengue fever.

<doc id="318909" wikidata="Q2361552" url="?curid=318909" title="Canóvanas, Puerto Rico">
<text>Canóvanas (, ) is a town and municipality in Puerto Rico, located in the northeastern region, north of Juncos and Las Piedras; south of Loíza; east of Carolina; and west of Río Grande. Canóvanas is spread over 6 barrios and Canóvanas Pueblo (the downtown area and administrative center). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The region of what is now Canóvanas belonged to the Taíno region of &quot;Cayniabón&quot;, also the native name of the Grande de Loiza River, which stretched from the central eastern region of Puerto Rico to the northeast coast of the island. The region was led by cacique &quot;Canobaná&quot;, from which the actual name is derived, in the south half, and female Cacica &quot;Loaiza&quot; in the north (mostly modern day Loíza). During the Spanish colonization, the region of Canóvanas was granted to Miguel Díaz, who turned the Taíno yucayeque into a ranch. It is said that Canóbana, along with Loaiza, were supporters of the Spanish regime and did not join the Taino rebellion of 1511.

Canóvanas was a &quot;barrio&quot; (district) of the municipality of Loíza for over 400 years. In 1902, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved a law for the consolidation of certain municipalities. As a result, both Canóvanas and Loíza were incorporated into the municipality of Río Grande. However, in 1905 a new law revoked the previous one, returning Canóvanas to its previous state of &quot;barrio&quot; of Loíza.

In 1909, the Municipal administration of Loíza was transferred to the barrio of Canóvanas, which was more developed than the Loíza region. Also, the construction of the PR-3 facilitated the communication with Canóvanas. As a result of the transfer, land was acquired to build a new city hall, a town square, a slaughterhouse, and a cemetery. A plot of land was purchased by Don Luis Hernaiz Veronne, a townhall senator and local farmer. The site location was strategic, to intercept traffic from the PR-3, and from other nearby roads like the PR-185.

However, the transfer was not well received by the residents of the original town of Loíza, then renamed Loiza Aldea. It was not until a law was passed on June 30, 1969, that both municipalities were recognized as having &quot;clearly different population nuclei&quot; recommending the establishment of two separate municipalities. The change was approved in 1970 by Governor Luis A. Ferré.

Like other nearby towns, the proximity of Canóvanas to the capital, San Juan, has allowed extraordinary urban and commercial development in the region. The municipality became renown in the 1990s for popularizing the urban legend of the chupacabras.

Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides, and caused catastrophic damages in Canóvanas. Five cases of Leptospirosis were reported in Canóvanas.
==Geography==
Canóvanas sits on the Northern Coastal Plain region of Puerto Rico. It is bordered by the municipalities of Loíza, Río Grande, Las Piedras, Juncos, Gurabo, and Carolina. Canóvanas covers only 28 square miles (72.8 km2).

Canóvanas combines flat alluvial plains in the center and north, areas with both gentle hills and rugged, deeply dissected mountainous areas made up of volcaniclastic rocks (lava flows and exposed intrusive igneous rocks) to the southeast and south. The Cuchilla de Santa Inés, a karstic limestone hill (mogote) with an elevation of 328 feet, rises from coastal sediments on the northeast of the municipality near San Isidro, while the Cuchilla El Asomante lies at the south with elevations that range from 656 to 2,296 feet.

On the southeast, Canóvanas features portions of the Sierra de Luquillo mountain range, with the Cerro El Negro being the tallest peak in the municipality at 2,592 feet. Other notable peaks are La Peregrina (1,903 feet) and Pitahaya (951 feet), both located at Barrio Hato Puerco.

===Water features===
Much of the flat plains are part of the flood-prone alluvial valley of the Río Grande de Loíza and its main tributaries, the Río Canóvanas and Río Canovanillas. Floods are typical during the storm season, between June and November. Other important tributaries are the Río Herrera and Río Cubuy, as well as numerous creeks.

===Barrios===

Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Canóvanas is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as , near the center of the municipality.
# Canóvanas
#Canóvanas barrio-pueblo
# Cubuy
# Hato Puerco
# Lomas
# Torrecilla Alta

The urban center of Canóvanas is located along Road PR-3, historically the main road between San Juan and Fajardo.

===Sectors===

Barrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions) are further subdivided into smaller areas called (&quot;sectors&quot; in English). The types of &quot;sectores&quot; may vary, from normally &quot;sector&quot; to &quot;urbanización&quot; to &quot;reparto&quot; to &quot;barriada&quot; to &quot;residencial&quot;, among others.

===Special Communities===

 (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion. A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Canóvanas: Cambalache, Jardines de Palmarejo, Sector Quintas, La Central, Sector Pueblo Indio, Sector Sierra Maestra, La Central, Sector Villa Borinquén, Las 400, Las Lomas, Palma Sola, Parcelas Nuevas in San Isidro, Parcelas Viejas in San Isidro, Sector Alturas de Campo Rico, Sector Los Navarros, Sector Monte Verde, Sector Valle Hills, Sector Villa Delicias, Villa Conquistador II, Villa Hugo 1, Villa Hugo II, and Villa Sin Miedo.

==Demographics==

Official population records for Canóvanas start in 1980, after the municipality was officially separated from Loíza. In 30 years, the population has increased by almost 50% according to the 2010 census.

According to the 2010 Census, 61% of the population identifies themselves as white, and 21.6% as black. Also, 48.6% of the population identified themselves as males, and 51.4% as females. Finally, 26.7% of the population is under 18 years old. The next biggest percentage of population (21.5%) is between 35 and 49 years old.

==Tourism==
Although Canóvanas is not particularly known for its touristic importance, there are several landmarks and places of interest to visit. The Jesús T. Piñero House is located along the PR-3. The residence, which was built around 1931, houses a museum dedicated to the life of Jesús T. Piñero, first Puerto Rican governor of the island.

The Hipódromo Camarero is also a tourist attraction for horserace enthusiasts of the island and the Caribbean. Other places of interest are the ruins of the Canóvanas Sugar Mill, El Español Bridge, the Old Ceiba Tree, and Villarán Park, which features the historic Villarán Bridge, the only one of its kind in Puerto Rico and the United States.

To stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the &quot;Voy Turistiendo&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Touring&quot;) campaign, with a passport book and website. The Canóvanas page lists , and the Pueblo with its historic architecture, as places of interest.

==Economy==
===Agriculture===
The economy of Canóvanas has traditionally relied on agriculture, primarily sugarcane and coffee. There was an important sugar mill located in the PR-951 from Canóvanas to Loíza. It belonged to &quot;Loíza Sugar Company&quot;, and then to &quot;Fajardo Sugar Company&quot;. However, the mill closed in 1965. In 1999, the structure was declared of historical importance by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico. There&#x27;s also growth of minor vegetables and fruits, as well as a minor cattle and poultry industry. Most of Canóvanas flat areas are subject to occasional flooding and are used as pastures for cattle.

&quot;Best Iguana Puerto Rico Meat&quot; in Canóvanas is the only company in Puerto Rico certified for processing, packaging and distributing iguana meat. The green iguana is an invasive species of Puerto Rico.

===Commerce===
In recent years, Canóvanas economy has shifted to commerce and industry, supplemented by the production of fresh milk. There has also been an increase in retail businesses. There are three main shopping malls, located along the PR-3 in the Canóvanas region. These malls such as The Outlet 66 Mall are the location of main stores like Wal-Mart, Marshalls, Burlington, and others.

Canóvanas is referred to as &quot;The Door to the East&quot; due to its location on the eastern edge of the San Juan Metropolitan Area sprawl, and its proximity to the northeast region of Puerto Rico. Also the expansion of Route 66 has sparked new interest in Canóvanas as an industrial and commercial sector. Recently the largest local supermarket chain brand Econo, has started the construction of its consolidated operations facilities with the construction of a super complex which will have the administrative headquarters, cold storage warehouse and main storages.

The municipal government has an economic development plan called &quot;Canovanas Opened for Business&quot; in which it provides fast legal and permit assistance, tax breaks and incentives for new commercial opportunities moving or establishing their businesses in Canóvanas. This has prompted the emergence of new small businesses and high demand for professional and technical services.

===Industrial===
The industrial sector is growing with large international pharmaceuticals like AstraZeneca, IPR Pharmaceuticals, QBD, and other manufacturing plants in Canóvanas.

==Culture==
===Festivals and events===

===Sports===
Although Canóvanas has no professional sports team currently active, several of its past teams have been notable. Traditionally, local sports teams bear the nickname of &quot;Indios&quot;. The Indios de Canóvanas, of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional, won the championship two years in a row (1983–1984) and reached the finals in 1988. Guard Angelo Cruz and center Ramón Ramos were two of the key players of the team during that era. However, the team disappeared during the 1990s. There have been movements to reestablish the team, but they&#x27;ve been unsuccessful.

The Indias of Canóvanas team, from the Liga de Voleibol Superior Femenino, also won a number of championships.

Canóvanas is also the location of Hipódromo Camarero, Puerto Rico&#x27;s only horse racetrack. The track, which was formerly named El Nuevo Comandante was established in 1976.

==Government==
All municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor, elected every four years. The current mayor of Canóvanas is Lornna Soto, of the New Progressive Party (PNP), who was first elected in the 2012 Puerto Rican General Election. She is the daughter of long-serving former Mayor Jose &quot;Chemo&quot; Soto, who distinguished himself for his eccentricities in clothing, and for successfully using the urban legend of the Chupacabra to promote the city. His daughter, Lornna, also served as a member of the Senate of Puerto Rico from 2004 to 2013.

The city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VIII, which is represented by two Senators. In 2024, Marissa Jiménez and Héctor Joaquín Sánchez Álvarez were elected as District Senators. Representatives Wanda Del Valle Correa (District 38) and Carmen Medina Calderón (District 37) represent different regions of Canóvanas in the House of Representatives.

===Flag===
The flag of Canóvanas features a purple background with a wide yellow band across, and the town&#x27;s coat of arms in the center.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms features a shield with the same colors (purple background and a yellow band). The colors are taken from the banner of the &quot;Hijos y Amigos Ausentes de Canóvanas&quot;. A broken chain symbolizes the separation of Canóvanas from Loíza. The crown in the middle represents the supremacy of Cacique Canobaná. The laurels are a symbol of the 23 consecutive wins achieved by the Loíza Indians basketball team, establishing a record in Puerto Rico, also represented by the basket in the middle. The rising sun, with its sixteen rays of light, indicate the sprouting of a new municipality in Puerto Rico and the number of incumbent mayors before Canóvanas was separated from Loíza.

The coat of arms also features a white banner below with the inscription &quot;1130 1909, Canobaná del Cayniabón, 8–16 1970&quot;. The first date, November 30, 1909, is the date of the installation of the municipal seat of Loíza in Canóvanas. The second date, August 15, 1970, is the date of the official founding of Canóvanas as a separate municipality. The names of Canobaná and Cayniabón make reference to the Taíno heritage of the region. Finally, a coronet in the form of a three-tower mural crown stands above the shield.

===Nicknames===
Canóvanas is known by various names. It is known as the &quot;Pueblo Valeroso&quot; after Cacique Yuira lost her life defending the Spanish people from her own people, the Taínos. It is also known as the &quot;City of Indians&quot; because of its important Taíno heritage. Canóvanas is also known as the &quot;City of Races&quot;, because of the Hipódromo Camarero, and the &quot;Town of the Chupacabras&quot; because of the alleged sightings of the creature, and the beliefs in it of former mayor, José Chemo Soto.

<doc id="318911" wikidata="Q217070" url="?curid=318911" title="Laurent Fabius">
<text>Laurent Fabius (; born 20 August 1946) is a French politician serving as president of the Constitutional Council since 8 March 2016. A member of the Socialist Party, he previously served as Prime Minister of France from 17 July 1984 to 20 March 1986. Fabius was 37 years old when he was appointed and is, after Gabriel Attal, the second youngest prime minister of the Fifth Republic.

Fabius was also President of the National Assembly from 1988 to 1992 and again from 1997 to 2000. Fabius served in the government as Minister of Finance from 2000 to 2002 and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2012 to 2016.

== Early life ==
Fabius was born in the affluent 16th arrondissement of Paris, the son of Louise (&quot;née&quot; Strasburger-Mortimer; 1911–2010) and André Fabius (1908–1984). He is the younger brother of Catherine Leterrier and François Fabius. His parents were from Ashkenazi Jewish families who converted to Catholicism. Fabius was raised a Catholic; he has three sons, David (born 1978) with his partner Christine d&#x27;Izarny Gargas, Thomas (born 1981) and Victor (born 1983) with his spouse, Françoise Castro.

Fabius&#x27; received secondary education at the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly and Lycée Louis-le-Grand, where he was a pupil of Donald Adamson. Fabius then went up to institutions that are training grounds for academics (), and senior civil servants and executives (Sciences Po, École nationale d&#x27;administration).

== Political career ==
After his studies, Fabius became an auditor for the Council of State. A member of the Socialist Party (PS) since 1974, Fabius was first elected to the National Assembly in 1978 for the fourth constituency of Seine-Maritime. Fabius quickly gained entry to the circle of François Mitterrand, the leader of the party.

=== In Government: 1981–1984 ===
When Mitterrand was elected as President of France in 1981, Fabius was nominated as Minister of the Budget. Two years later, Fabius became Minister of Industry, and pursued the policy of &quot;industrial restructuring&quot;. In 1984, in a government shake-up, Mitterrand chose Fabius as prime minister (choosing Fabius over Pierre Bérégovoy and Jacques Delors). At the age of 37 he was the youngest French prime minister since 1819.

=== Prime minister: 1984–1986 ===
Fabius advocated a new kind of French socialism, which accepted the market economy. It marked a shift away from traditional socialist concerns with state ownership and instead looked for ways to modernize industry, and increase productivity, even at the cost of some jobs. Fabius also worked to modernize the party&#x27;s archaic structures. In social policy, a law of December 1984 replaced allowance for orphans with a family support allowance, and empowered family allowance funds to aid in recovery of child support when a parent fails to pay. The allowable income for recipients of the young child allowance was increased (July 1984) for families with three or more children. The Fabius Government also sought to reduce penalties on families with working mothers by substantially increasing the income ceiling for dual-income families receiving the young child allowance. A parental education fund was created (1985), which provided for payments to each person who stops work or reduces hours of work as a result of the birth of any child beyond the first two, for which the parent(s) is/are responsible. In 1985, as a means of upholding the rights of homosexuals, the penal code was amended to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of &quot;moral habits&quot; which included sexual orientation, which also secured the right to same-sex relationships.

A decree of 17 July 1984 set up an Immigrants&#x27; Council, which could be consulted on questions of concern to the immigrant population regarding living conditions, housing, work, employment, education, and training, as well as social and cultural activities. In November 1984, an allowance was introduced if the parent concerned had been employed for two or more years. Known as the &quot;allocation parentale d&#x27;education,&quot; this allowance provided 1,000 francs per month for parents who decided to take two years of parental leave after the birth of their first child. The &quot;allocation au jeune enfant,&quot; introduced in January 1985, was paid to all families at a flat rate for each child from the third month of pregnancy for nine months, regardless of the parents&#x27; income. Payment was to continue after this period for 8 out of 10 families for a further 32 months on a means-tested basis. In effect, this created a benefit for the first child in lower income families. The government, however, reduced the daily maternity allowance from 90% to 84% of the basic wage, while the reimbursement rate of so-called &quot;comfort&quot; medicinal products was also lowered.

In June 1985, a law was passed allowing first offenders who had committed petty crimes to serve sentences of six months or less in public-service jobs. A July 1985 law tripled the amount of aid for victims of crimes. Legislation was introduced later that year to restrict the use of preventive detention, and ensure that the rights of suspects were better protected.

A decree of September 1984 reconstituted the Supreme Council for the Prevention of Occupational Risks, a consultative body representing both sides of industry, to make it function more flexibly, and was extended to include crafts. A law of January 1985 extended the scope for associations whose formal objectives include combating racism to institute a civil action where an offence has been committed against an individual by reason of his national or ethnic origin, race or religion. A special 1985 holiday programme was introduced, directed particularly at young people outside the traditional circuits of organised leisure activities. Provisions were also adopted that same year according new rights to families and users of child social assistance, particularly as regards information and the association of families and children in decision-making. The right to maternity leave was also extended to the father, in the event of the death of the mother in child-birth. The father was entitled to post-natal leave and could claim an allowance under the maternity insurance scheme.

In the field of education, much time and effort was spent on improving the system and educational outcomes. Vast sums were provided to improve technical education in schools, with closer ties established between education and industry, a programme was launched to train 25,000 teachers per annum in the use of computers, 100,000 computers were purchased for students to use, and 1 billion francs were provided for purchasing modern machine tools. The university system was reformed along practical, technological lines, with a degree in new technologies introduced, the reorientation of the first cycle to include greater emphasis on languages and new technologies, the provision of students with orientation and career opportunity meetings to help them plan their course of study in relation to the job market. Universities were encouraged to open up to industry and new technologies via training more skilled researchers and considering the practical needs of business. In 1985, a vocational baccalaureat was established. to provide training for highly skilled workers.

In employment policy, the Fabius Government introduced a number of measures designed to mitigate the effects of unemployment. In 1984, three youth training programmes were set up to ease the transition from school to work. The contrat de qualification (CQ) combined work and training for young workers during a 6-month to 2-year period. The contrat d&#x27;adaptation (CA) was aimed at facilitating the hiring of young workers by adapting existing skills to the
work setting. Under this scheme, individuals worked for a maximum 6-month period while receiving at least 200 hours of training. The stages d&#x27;initiation a La vie professionnelle (SIVP) provided schoolleavers with an initiation into work life to enable them to sample and then choose a career. The pre-training stages lasted for three to six months, with the worker receiving at least twenty-five hours of training a month. Participation in this scheme could lead to a CQ or CA.

Under a law of August 1985 governing leave for training, retraining and reemployment, employers undertake to offer such leave to a specific number of wage-earners whose redundancy would have been authorised; during this period the workers concerned will be able to benefit from a number of activities organised to help them find new jobs. A law of January 1985 widened the scope of certain social provisions, including the encouragement of training work experience schemes for young people by setting up introductory apprenticeships and extending the fifth week of annual paid holiday to nursery school assistants. A law of July 1985, while increasing the number of cases in which a firm could use temporary workers and relaxing conditions regarding the duration of certain types of contracts, also introduced changes in the rules relating to the duration of probation periods and made it harder to re-employ temporary workers in the same job before a waiting period has expired, etc.

The way in which the occupational health services are organised was modified by two decrees issued in March 1986. The first established regional occupational health committees while the second made important changes to the regulations. A Decree of March 1986 laid down conditions for the approval of organisations conducting atmospheric monitoring and made a French standard on such work compulsory, while a Decree of March 1986 on the information and test results to be provided under the Labour Code introduced in France the European Community testing methods for analysing dangerous substances as well as the OECD &quot;codes of practice&quot; governing the procedures to be followed when conducting these tests.

During the early Eighties, the Socialists introduced the &quot;congé de conversion&quot; (&quot;conversion leave&quot;), which received widespread publicity in 1984 when redundancy measures were introduced for the shipbuilding and steel industries. These combined the traditional tool of early retirement for redundant workers over the age of fifty with a &quot;conversion leave&quot; for others. These leaves suspended (but did not break) the work contract for a period of up to two years, and during this time the individual received 70% of their previous wage together with retraining in a new occupation. After the retraining was over, workers were promised two job offers. In 1985, the Fabius Government universalised the congé. The revamped congé de conversion offered redundant workers 65% of their previous salary (in line with the benefits for early retirement and unemployment compensation) and a training period of 4–10 months. Between 1985 and 1987, however, only 15,000 workers had taken advantage of the congés, and only one-third succeeded in their &quot;conversion.&quot; A year earlier, in 1984, the Fabius government established the travaux d&#x27;utilite collective (TUC) programme to prepare school leavers for professional life. This scheme offered unemployed youth between the ages of 16 and 21 (extended to 25 in 1985), the opportunity to work half time in a public sector job.

Improvements were also made to the system of benefits for the long-term unemployed whose rights to unemployment insurance had expired. Subject to certain conditions regarding previous activity and resources, the daily solidarity allowance paid to them was raised from FF 42 to FF.64.50 on 1 April. This could be as high as FF 86 per day for unemployed persons aged 55 and over who could give proof of 20 years&#x27; paid employment, while unemployed persons aged 57 1/2 had to give proof of only ten paid employment to obtain this allowance and are not required to look for a job. A law of July 1985 amended the articles of the Code de Travail (Labour Code) to bring them into line with EEC Directive 79/781/EEC on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances. A decree of January 1985 laid down a list of work for which the employees of temporary labour agencies may not be employed, the work in question involving exposure to certain toxic agents and special risks for temporary workers for whom it is difficult to provide medical supervision. A decree of April 1985 laid down technical instructions to be observed by occupational physicians responsible for medical checks on employees exposed to substances which may cause malignant damage to the bladder. The scope of a decree of October 1983, which laid down a list of and the conditions for the labelling and packaging of paints, varnishes, printing inks, adhesives and similar products was extended by a decree of July 1985 to include enamelling preparations. A circular of May 1985 on the prevention of occupational cancers specified the roles of the employer, the trade unions and the occupational physician in preventing this hazard, the effects of which may appear only long after exposure to the agents in question.

A law of January 1986 contained a number of changes regarding workers&#x27; right to express their views. The obligation to negotiate agreements on the way in which this right is exercised, which used to be limited to firms employing at least 200 workers, was extended to all businesses where trade unions had established one or more sections and appointed a shop steward. The obligation to negotiate did not, however, apply to firms without trade union representations and with less than 50 workers, even if a staff representative had been appointed as trade union delegate. A law of February 1986 amending the labour code included various changes e.g. to ensure that wage-earners received a stable income, independent of fluctuations in weekly working hours. A decree on the protection of workers exposed to benzene was issued in February 1986 with the purpose of simplifying and updating the relevant regulations, most of which dated back to 1939. A decree was issued in March 1986 which amended certain provisions in the Labour Code concerning substances and preparations hazardous to workers, thus transferring into national law the provisions of the Council Directive 79/831/EEC amending for the sixth time Directive 67/548/EEC on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances. The procedures for forwarding documents concerning inspections and verifications for health and safety purposes were laid down in a decree dated 13 March 1986. A further decree, issued that same year, laid down the health and safety requirements to be met by mobile agricultural and forestry machinery, while a further decree issued on the same date related to the protection of workers exposed to methyl bromide. A decree of January 1986 covers the flooring of fixed scaffolding while a decree of March 1986 laid down the health and safety requirements to be met by mobile agricultural and forestry machinery. A circular of January 1986 on the labelling and packaging of chemical products for industrial use defined the scope of the 1983 decrees on the labelling of chemical products and contained a &quot;guide to EEC packaging&quot;. Following a number of accidents involving pyralene transformers, a circular of March 1986 on the hazards associated with pyralene and its decomposition products sets out, for the inspection officers involved, the risks associated with such products, the sectors most at risk, the elementary precautions to be taken, and the regulations to be applied.

Despite the Fabius Government&#x27;s achievements in social policy, it was unable to prevent a rise in social inequality during its time in office, a situation arguably exacerbated by austerity measures introduced by the government. Although the rate of inflation fell, unemployment continued to increase, standing at 11% in early 1986, compared with 8% in 1983. Concern over rising inequality in France was expressed in the publication of a number of books on both &quot;the new poverty&quot; and &quot;social exclusion,&quot; which had become major public preoccupations. As a result of a decline in unemployment insurance coverage, those who had no welfare assistance had to rely on local charity and local assistance. This led to cases of some supermarkets providing free food parcels for the unemployed. In 1985, the Fabius Government increased the wealth tax to provide subsidies for organisations providing basic services such as hot meals, agreed to make empty housing and surplus food stocks available, and decided to provide a basic allowance of 40 francs per day for some of the unemployed over the age of 50 who had been left out of the benefit scheme.

The Fabius Government&#x27;s inability to prevent both rising unemployment and inequality arguably contributed to the defeat of the French Socialists in the 1986 legislative election, which led Fabius to step down as prime minister.

=== Scandals as prime minister ===
The symbol of a modern French socialism, he was weakened by the &quot;Infected blood scandal&quot;. His government was accused of having knowingly let doctors give haemophiliacs transfusions of blood infected by HIV. A judicial process similar to impeachment acquitted him of all personal moral responsibility in the matter.

After the sinking of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;, a Greenpeace ship, on 10 July 1985, Prime Minister Fabius summoned journalists to his office on 22 September 1985 to read a 200-word statement in which he said: &quot;The truth is cruel,&quot; and acknowledged that &quot;Agents of the French secret service sank this boat. They were acting on orders.&quot; He had previously denied that the bombers of the Rainbow Warrior were in the employ of the French secret service.

=== Further political career: 1986–2002 ===
Fabius came to be seen as Lionel Jospin&#x27;s rival to be Mitterrand&#x27;s heir. He failed to win the First Secretaryship of the party in 1988 and 1990 (Rennes Congress) in spite of Mitterrand&#x27;s support. Installed as President of the National Assembly in 1988 (at 41 years of age, the equal youngest in the history of the lower house).

In 1989, he was elected to the European Parliament where he served on the Committee on Institutional Affairs, while simultaneously remaining President of the National Assembly. He used this dual role to successfully propose the establishment of The Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union (COSAC) - a conference of Members of Parliament (MPs) drawn from parliamentary committees responsible for European Union affairs in each national parliament and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). 

He succeeded finally in becoming First Secretary of the party in 1992, but resigned after the Socialist disaster of the 1993 legislative election.

He came back as president of the National Assembly in 1997, then as Minister of Economy and Finance in Lionel Jospin&#x27;s cabinet between 2000 and 2002. After Jospin&#x27;s retirement, he hoped to return as Socialist leader but he failed. He declared that his mind was changed about a number of matters and he joined the left-wing of the party.

=== Major figure of the Socialist Party: 2002–12 ===
In this position he was the leader of the defeated &quot;No&quot; camp in the vote that took place among the members of his party on 1 December 2004, to decide the stance that the party would take on the impending referendum on the European Constitution. He went on to lead the rebel faction of the party advocating a &quot;no&quot; vote in the 2005 Referendum, and was seen as the spearhead of the whole &quot;no&quot; campaign in France. After the &quot;no&quot; vote won, the party leader gave an assurance that he could remain in the party though he was dismissed from the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee.

Fabius was a candidate in the Socialist Party&#x27;s primary to be the party&#x27;s candidate in the 2007 presidential election, but finished third, behind Ségolène Royal, the winner, and Dominique Strauss-Kahn. He was subsequently re-elected to the National Assembly in the June 2007 parliamentary election.

=== Minister for Foreign Affairs: 2012–2016 === 
On 17 May 2012, Laurent Fabius became foreign minister in the government of Jean-Marc Ayrault, appointed prime minister by President François Hollande.
His mandate had three milestones:
* he didn&#x27;t want to negotiate with President Assad to defeat what became ISIL,
* he supported Syrian rebel groups, and
* he reckoned that &quot;Al-Nosra was doing a good job&quot;.
As foreign minister, Fabius was also chair of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference which took place in Paris. His way of engaging with all delegates to achieve a successful agreement has been described as crucial, and something that will make him &quot;go down in history as one of the great diplomats&quot;.

=== President of the Constitutional Council: 2016–present ===
Fabius was chosen by President François Hollande to succeed Jean-Louis Debré as President of the Constitutional Council. The change became effective on 8 March 2016.

On 12 November 2023, he took part in the March for the Republic and Against Antisemitism in Paris in response to the rise in antisemitism since the start of the Israel–Hamas war.

<doc id="318915" wikidata="Q1781726" url="?curid=318915" title="Stabilization policy">
<text>In macroeconomics, a stabilization [[policy]] is a package or set of measures introduced to stabilize a financial system or economy. The term can refer to policies in two distinct sets of circumstances: business cycle stabilization or credit cycle stabilization. In either case, it is a form of discretionary policy.

==Business cycle stabilization==
“Stabilization” can refer to correcting the normal behavior of the business cycle, thus enhancing economic stability. In this case, the term generally refers to demand management by monetary and fiscal policy to reduce normal fluctuations and output, sometimes referred to as &quot;keeping the economy on an even keel.&quot;

The policy changes in these circumstances are usually countercyclical, compensating for the predicted changes in employment and output, to increase short-run and medium run welfare.

==Crisis stabilization==
The term can also refer to measures taken to resolve a specific economic crisis, for instance, an exchange-rate crisis or stock market crash, in order to prevent the economy developing recession or inflation.

The package is usually initiated either by a government or central bank, or by either or both of these institutions acting in concert with international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank. Depending on the goals to be achieved, it involves some combination of restrictive fiscal measures (to reduce government borrowing) and monetary tightening (to support the currency).

Recent examples of such packages include Argentina&#x27;s rescheduling of its international obligations (where central banks and leading international banks rescheduled Argentina&#x27;s debt so as to allow it to avoid total default), and IMF interventions in South East Asia (at the end of the 1990s) when several Asian economies encountered financial turbulence. See examples:

*Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002): The recovery
*Timeline of Brazilian economic stabilization plans
*Economic Stabilization Plan (Israel 1985)
*Economy of South Korea: 1990s and the Asian Financial Crisis
*Economy of Malaysia: Asian financial crisis and recovery
*United States
**Troubled Asset Relief Program
**Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008
**Office of Economic Stabilization
**Economic Stabilization Act of 1970

This type of stabilization can be painful, in the short term, for the economy concerned because of lower output and higher unemployment. Unlike a business-cycle stabilization policy, these changes will often be pro-cyclical, reinforcing existing trends. While this is clearly undesirable, the policies are designed to be a platform for successful long-run growth and reform.

It has been argued that, rather than imposing such policies after a crisis, the international financial system architecture needs to be reformed to avoid some of the risks (e.g., hot money flows and/or hedge fund activity) that some people hold to destabilize economies and financial markets, and lead to the need for stabilization policies and, e.g., IMF interventions. Proposed measures include for example a global Tobin tax on currency trades across borders.

<text>Obor is the name of a square and the surrounding district of Bucharest, the capital of Romania. There is also a Bucharest Metro station (on the M1 line) named Obor, which lies in this area. The district is near the Colentina and Moșilor neighborhoods.

Obor stands in the place of &quot;Târgul Moșilor&quot;, a fair famous throughout Wallachia, which was held twice a week. In Old Romanian, &quot;obor&quot; meant &quot;enclosure, corral&quot;. Located outside the city, in the 18th century, it was also the place for public hangings. About 20 Turks captured from wars were hanged here by the Romanians.

The Obor Market (Piața Obor), the direct successor of the original fair, was, until 2007, Bucharest&#x27;s largest public market. It covered about 16 city blocks and included a variety of indoor and outdoor market spaces, with goods ranging from compact discs to live chickens. During his official visit to Romania in August 1969, President Richard Nixon paid visit to the Obor Market, where he tasted the grapes. Informally, the market spilled into the surrounding neighborhood, both in terms of street vendors and in terms of the nearby &quot;Magazin Universal&quot; (&quot;Universal Store&quot;) named &quot;Bucur Obor&quot;, a large commercial building and housing estate (officially named the ALMO housing estate, built in 1975 and renovated in 2013 and 2017) that has been parcelled up into hundreds of small, independent retail stores. The market was demolished, not without public outcry, in order to pave the way for a modern market and a small park, thus ending a 300-year tradition.

The Veranda Mall, which lies close to the Obor metro station, was inaugurated in October 2016. With a surface, it includes 18 fashion and footwear shops, restaurants, children&#x27;s playgrounds, a cinema, and a gym, as well as a Carrefour hypermarket.

In Romanian popular culture, the neighborhood is referenced by Gică Petrescu in his song &quot;Uite-așa aș vrea să mor&quot;, in which the artist playfully expresses his desire to be buried in a tavern in the area with a glass of red wine in his hand. Among Bucharest dwellers, it has attained a reputation of a market of relatively cheap products, sometimes even of low quality.

The was inaugurated in 1903.
