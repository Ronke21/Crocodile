<text>Network society is an expression coined in 1991 related to the social, political, economic and cultural changes caused by the spread of networked, digital information and communications technologies. The intellectual origins of the idea can be traced back to the work of early social theorists such as Georg Simmel who analyzed the effect of modernization and industrial capitalism on complex patterns of affiliation, organization, production and experience.

==Origins==
The term &quot;network society&quot; was coined by Jan van Dijk in his 1991 Dutch book &quot;De Netwerkmaatschappij&quot; (&quot;The Network Society&quot;) and by Manuel Castells in &quot;The Rise of the Network Society&quot; (1996), the first part of his trilogy &quot;The Information Age&quot;. In 1978 James Martin used the related term &#x27;The Wired Society&#x27; indicating a society that is connected by mass- and telecommunication networks. 

Van Dijk defines the network society as a society in which a combination of social and media networks shapes its prime mode of organization and most important structures at all levels (individual, organizational and societal). He compares this type of society to a mass society that is shaped by groups, organizations and communities (&#x27;masses&#x27;) organized in physical co-presence.

==Barry Wellman, Hiltz and Turoff==
Wellman studied the network society as a sociologist at the University of Toronto. His first formal work was in 1973, &quot;The Network City&quot; with a more comprehensive theoretical statement in 1988. Since his 1979 &quot;The Community Question&quot;, Wellman has argued that societies at any scale are best seen as networks (and &quot;networks of networks&quot;) rather than as bounded groups in hierarchical structures. More recently, Wellman has contributed to the theory of social network analysis with an emphasis on individualized networks, also known as &quot;networked individualism&quot;. In his studies, Wellman focuses on three main points of the network society: community, work and organizations. He states that with recent technological advances an individual&#x27;s community can be socially and spatially diversified. Organizations can also benefit from the expansion of networks in that having ties with members of different organizations can help with specific issues.

In 1978, Roxanne Hiltz and Murray Turoff&#x27;s &quot;The Network Nation&quot; explicitly built on Wellman&#x27;s community analysis, taking the book&#x27;s title from Craven and Wellman&#x27;s &quot;The Network City&quot;. The book argued that computer supported communication could transform society. It was remarkably prescient, as it was written well before the advent of the Internet. Turoff and Hiltz were the progenitors of an early computer supported communication system, called EIES.

==Manuel Castells==
According to Castells, networks constitute the new social morphology of our societies. When interviewed by Harry Kreisler from the University of California Berkeley, Castells said &quot;...the definition, if you wish, in concrete terms of a network society is a society where the key social structures and activities are organized around electronically processed information networks. So it&#x27;s not just about networks or social networks, because social networks have been very old forms of social organization. It&#x27;s about social networks which process and manage information and are using micro-electronic based technologies.&quot; The diffusion of a networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production, experience, power, and culture. For Castells, networks have become the basic units of modern society. Van Dijk does not go that far; for him these units still are individuals, groups, organizations and communities, though they may increasingly be linked by networks.

The network society goes further than the information society that is often proclaimed. Castells argues that it is not purely the technology that defines modern societies, but also cultural, economic and political factors that make up the network society. Influences such as religion, cultural upbringing, political organizations, and social status all shape the network society. Societies are shaped by these factors in many ways. These influences can either raise or hinder these societies. For van Dijk, information forms the substance of contemporary society, while networks shape the organizational forms and infrastructures of this society.

The space of flows plays a central role in Castells&#x27; vision of the network society. It is a network of communications, defined by hubs where these networks crisscross. Élites in cities are not attached to a particular locality but to the space of flows.

Castells puts great importance on the networks and argues that the real power is to be found within the networks rather than confined in global cities. This contrasts with other theorists who rank cities hierarchically.

==Jan van Dijk==
Van Dijk has defined the idea &quot;network society&quot; as a form of society increasingly organizing its relationships in media networks gradually replacing or complementing the social networks of face-to-face communication. Personal and social-network communication is supported by digital technology. This means that social and media networks are shaping the prime mode of organization and most important structures of modern society.

Van Dijk&#x27;s &quot;The Network Society&quot; describes what the network society is and what it might be like in the future. The first conclusion of this book is that modern society is in a process of becoming a network society. This means that on the internet interpersonal, organizational, and mass communication come together. People become linked to one another and have access to information and communication with one another constantly. Using the internet brings the “whole world” into homes and work places. Also, when media like the internet becomes even more advanced it will gradually appear as “normal media” in the first decade of the 21st century as it becomes used by larger sections of the population and by vested interests in the economy, politics and culture. It asserts that paper means of communication will become out of date, with newspapers and letters becoming ancient forms for spreading information.

==Interaction with new media==

New media are “media which are both integrated and interactive and also use digital code at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries.”

In western societies, the individual linked by networks is becoming the basic unit of the network society. In eastern societies, this might still be the group (family, community, work team) linked by networks. In the contemporary process of individualisation, the basic unit of the network society has become the individual who is linked by networks. This is caused by simultaneous scale extension (nationalisation and internationalisation) and scale reduction (smaller living and working environments) Other kinds of communities arise. Daily living and working environments are getting smaller and more heterogenous, while the range of the division of labour, interpersonal communications and mass media extends. So, the scale of the network society is both extended and reduced as compared to the mass society. The scope of the network society is both global and local, sometimes indicated as “glocal”. The organization of its components (individuals, groups, organizations) is no longer tied to particular times and places. Aided by information and communication technology, these coordinates of existence can be transcended to create virtual times and places and to simultaneously act, perceive and think in global and local terms.

There is an explosion of horizontal networks of communication, quite independent from media business and governments, that allows the emergence of what can be called self-directed mass communication. It is mass communication because it is diffused throughout the Internet, so it potentially reaches the whole planet. It is self-directed because it is often initiated by individuals or groups by themselves bypassing the media system. The explosion of blogs, vlogs, podding, streaming and other forms of interactive, computer to computer communication set up a new system of global, horizontal communication Networks that, for the first time in history, allow people to communicate with each other without going through the channels set up by the institutions of society for socialized communication.

What results from this evolution is that the culture of the network society is largely shaped by the messages exchanged in the composite electronic hypertext made by the technologically linked networks of different communication modes. In the network society, virtuality is the foundation of reality through the new forms of socialized communication. Society shapes technology according to the needs, values and interests of people who use the technology. Furthermore, information and communication technologies are particularly sensitive to the effects of social uses on technology itself. The history of the internet provides ample evidence that the users, particularly the first thousands of users, were, to a large extent, the producers of the technology. However, technology is a necessary, albeit not sufficient condition for the emergence of a new form of social organization based on networking, that is on the diffusion of networking in all realms of activity on the basis of digital communication networks.

==Modern Examples==
The concepts described by Jan van Dijk, Barry Wellman, Hiltz and Turoff, and Manuel Castells are embodied in much digital technology. Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, instant messaging and email are prime examples of the Network Society at work. These web services allow people all over the world to communicate through digital means without face-to-face contact. This demonstrates how the ideas of society changing will affect the persons we communicate over time.
Network society does not have any confinements and has found its way to the global scale. Network society is developed in modern society that allows for a great deal of information to be traded to help improve information and communication technologies. Having this luxury of easier communication also has consequences. This allows for globalization to take place by having more and more people joining the online society and learning about different techniques with the world wide web. This benefits users who have access to the internet, to stay connected at all times with any topic the user wants. Individuals without internet may be affected because they are not directly connected into this society. People always have an option to find public space with computers with internet. This allows a user to keep up with the ever changing system. Network society is constantly changing the “cultural production in a hyper-connected world.” 
Social Structures revolve around the relationship of the “production/consumption, power, and experience.” These conclusively create a culture, which continues to sustain by getting new information constantly. Our society system was a mass media system where it was a more general place for information. Now the system is more individualized and custom system for users making the internet more personal. This makes messages to the audience more inclusive sent into society. Ultimately allowing more sources to be included to better communication. Network society is seen as a global system that helps with globalization. This is beneficial to the people who have access to the internet to get this media. The negative to this is the people without access do not get this sense of the network society. These networks, that have now been digitized, are more efficient of connecting people. Everything we know now can be put into a computer and processed. Users put messages online for others to read and learn about. This allows people to gain knowledge faster and more efficiently. Networked society allows for people to connect to each other quicker and to engage more actively. This networks go away from having a central theme, but still has a focus in what it is there to accomplish.

<text>CBS Radio Mystery Theater (a.k.a. Radio Mystery Theater and Mystery Theater, sometimes abbreviated as CBSRMT) is a radio drama series created by Himan Brown that was broadcast on CBS Radio Network affiliates from 1974 to 1982, and later in the early 2000s was repeated by the NPR satellite feed. In New York City it was not aired by the then all-news WCBS but by its originating station, WOR, which produced and announced it as simply Radio Mystery Theater.

The format was similar to that of classic old time radio shows like &quot;The Mysterious Traveler&quot; and &quot;The Whistler&quot;, in that the episodes were introduced by host E. G. Marshall who provided pithy wisdom and commentary throughout. Unlike the hosts of those earlier programs, Marshall is fully mortal, merely someone whose heightened insight and erudition plunge the listener into the world of the macabre.

As with Himan Brown&#x27;s prior &quot;Inner Sanctum Mysteries&quot;, each episode of &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; opened and closed with the ominous sound of a creaking door. This sound effect is accompanied by Marshall&#x27;s greeting, &quot;Come in!… Welcome. I&#x27;m E. G. Marshall.&quot; At each show&#x27;s conclusion, the door swings shut, and Marshall signs off with: &quot;Until next time, pleasant… dreams?&quot; This is followed by an extended variation of the show&#x27;s theme music.

&quot;CBSRMT&quot; was broadcast each weeknight, at first with a new program each night. Later in the run, three or four episodes were new originals each week, and the remainder repeats. There were 1,399 original episodes. The total number of broadcasts, including repeats, was 2,969. Each episode was allotted a full hour of airtime, but after commercials and newscasts, each episode typically ran for around 45 minutes.

==Hosts==
E. G. Marshall hosted the program from January 1974 until February 1, 1982, when actress Tammy Grimes took over for the remainder of the series&#x27; final season, maintaining the format. Himan Brown re-recorded E. G. Marshall&#x27;s original host segments for NPR&#x27;s broadcast of the show in the 2000s.

==Music==
The series&#x27; theme music features three descending notes from double basses, a stopped horn sting and timpani roll, then a low, eerie theme played by the bass clarinet. The opening and closing themes for &quot;CBSRMT&quot; are excerpted from the music from the score for &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Two&quot;, composed by Nathan Van Cleave. Series listeners will immediately recognize the &quot;RMT Theme&quot; beginning about 1:35 on the &quot;Two&quot; soundtrack selection from the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; CD boxed set. Other background tracks from the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; music library, to which CBS owned full rights, were featured repeatedly in episodes of &quot;CBSRMT&quot;. The theme song and the other music was also previously used in the 1950s and 1960s in other CBS-owned radio and television dramas (&quot;Perry Mason&quot;; &quot;Rawhide&quot;; &quot;The Fugitive&quot;; &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;; &quot;Have Gun Will Travel&quot;; &quot;Suspense&quot;; &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot;; etc.), in addition to &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, as it was all owned by CBS.

==Scope==
Despite the show&#x27;s title, Brown expanded its scope beyond mysteries to include horror, science fiction, historical drama, westerns and comedy, along with seasonal dramas during the Christmas season: An adaptation of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, starring host E.G. Marshall as Scrooge, was broadcast every Christmas Eve with the exception of 1974 and 1982.

In addition to original stories, there were adaptations of classic tales by such writers as O. Henry, Ambrose Bierce, Algernon Blackwood, Wilkie Collins, Arthur Conan Doyle, Charles Dickens, H. Rider Haggard, Henry James, Guy de Maupassant, Edith Wharton, Oscar Wilde and others. Brown typically devoted the first full week of each January to a five- or seven-part series on a common theme. These included a full week of stories by an American writer, (Edgar Allan Poe in 1975, Mark Twain in 1976); week-long adaptations of classic novels (&quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; in 1980, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in 1982); and original dramas about historical figures (Nefertiti in 1979, Alexander the Great in 1981). The works of Russian writers, including Gogol, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, were also adapted.

==Criticism==
Radio historian John Dunning has criticized the quality of the show&#x27;s script writing, arguing that Brown used writers for many scripts &quot;who were by their nature performers&quot; rather than writers.

==Notable performers==
Prominent actors from the stage, radio, film and television performed on the series. Notable regulars included Mason Adams, Lloyd Battista, John Beal, Robert Dryden, Teri Keane, Ralph Bell, Howard Da Silva, Keir Dullea, Patricia Elliot, Morgan Fairchild, Bernard Grant, Veleka Gray, Jack Grimes, Fred Gwynne, Marian Hailey, Larry Haines, Paul Hecht, Celeste Holm, Russell Horton, Kim Hunter, Richard Kiley, Beatrice Straight, John Lithgow, Roberta Maxwell, Mercedes McCambridge, Kevin McCarthy, Arnold Moss, William Redfield, Tony Roberts, Norman Rose, Alexander Scourby, Marian Seldes, Kristoffer Tabori and Michael Tolan.

The series introduced a new generation of listeners to many of the great voices from radio&#x27;s golden age , including Joan Banks, Jackson Beck, Virginia Gregg, Victor Jory, Mandel Kramer, Marvin Miller, Dan Ocko, Santos Ortega, Alan Reed, Rosemary Rice, Anne Seymour, Arnold Stang, Les Tremayne, Lurene Tuttle and Janet Waldo.

When the program began in 1974, actors were paid union scale; at the time around $73.92 per episode. Writers earned a flat rate of $350 per episode. Production took place with assembly-line precision. Brown met with actors at 9:00 a.m. for the first script reading. After roles were assigned, recording began. By noon, the recording of the actors was complete, and Brown handed everyone checks. The program was taped in New York at the CBS Studio Building, 49 East 52nd Street in Studio G, formerly Studio 27 (renamed Studio &#x27;G&#x27; in honor of Arthur Godfrey whose programs originated in the building for decades).

==Episodes==
Below is a list of the number of first-run episodes broadcast on each of the nine seasons of the series, with links to a list of each season&#x27;s episodes.
==Awards==
In 1974, &quot;CBSRMT&quot; won a Peabody Award, and in 1990 it was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. On May 6, 1979, Himan Brown was presented a Broadcast Preceptor Award by San Francisco State University for his contributions with the &quot;CBSRMT&quot;.

==Continuing popularity==
From June 3 to November 27, 1998, &quot;CBSRMT&quot; was rebroadcast over CBS radio affiliates and, in 2000, on some NPR stations, in both cases, Himan Brown re-recorded the original introduction and narrations of E.G. Marshall and Tammy Grimes.

&quot;CBSRMT&quot; remains popular with listeners of audio drama, with numerous websites and podcasts devoted to the series. All episodes are available, and many recordings include original network and local news and commercials, providing insights into the period in which the episodes were broadcast.

==Related publications==
The episode &quot;Children of Death&quot;, broadcast February 5, 1976, written by Sam Dann, served as the basis for Dann&#x27;s 1979 novel &quot;The Third Body&quot;, published by Popular Library. Another of his stories for &quot;Mystery Theater&quot;, &quot;Goodbye, Karl Erich&quot; from the 1975 season, was also turned into a novel by the same name, first published in 1985.

In 1976, a paperback anthology with three short stories adapted from the series&#x27; radio scripts was published by Pocket Library, &quot;Strange Tales from the CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;, edited and with a foreword by Himan Brown.

In January 1999, McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. published &quot;The CBS Radio Mystery Theater: An Episode Guide and Handbook to Nine Years of Broadcasting. 1974–1982&quot;. The book, by Gordon Payton and Martin Grams, Jr., includes a brief history of the program and an episode guide. A partial list of errors in this guide is maintained on The Long Trek website.

In October 2006, Michael Anthony Stahl published &quot;The CBS Radio Mystery Theater As An Educational Degree&quot;.

<doc id="316678" wikidata="Q75848" url="?curid=316678" title="Gated community">
<text>A gated community (or walled community) is a form of residential community or housing estate containing strictly controlled entrances for pedestrians, bicycles, and automobiles, and often characterized by a closed perimeter of walls and fences. Historically, cities have built defensive city walls and controlled gates to protect their inhabitants, and such fortifications have also separated quarters of some cities. Today, gated communities usually consist of small residential streets and include various shared amenities. For smaller communities, these amenities may include only a park or other common area. For larger communities, it may be possible for residents to stay within the community for most daily activities. Gated communities are a type of common interest development, but are distinct from intentional communities.

For socio-historical reasons, in the developed world they exist primarily in the United States.

Given that gated communities are spatially a type of enclave, Setha M. Low, an anthropologist, has argued that they have a negative effect on the net social capital of the broader community outside the gated community. Some gated communities, usually called &quot;guard-gated communities&quot;, are staffed by private security guards and are often home to high-value properties, and/or are set up as retirement villages.

==Features==
Besides the services of gatekeepers, many gated communities provide other amenities. These may depend on a number of factors including geographical location, demographic composition, community structure, and community fees collected. When there are sub-associations that belong to master associations, the master association may provide many of the amenities. In general, the larger the association the more amenities that can be provided.

Amenities also depend on the type of housing. For example, single-family-home communities may not have a common-area swimming pool, since individual home-owners have the ability to construct their own private pools. A condominium, on the other hand, may offer a community pool, since the individual units do not have the option of a private pool installation.

Typical amenities offered can include one or more:

* Swimming pools
* Bowling alleys
* Tennis courts
* Community centres or clubhouses
* Golf courses
* Marina
* On-site dining
* Playgrounds
* Exercise rooms including workout machines
* Spa
* Coworking spaces

==Around the world==

In Brazil, the most widespread form of gated community is called &quot;&quot;&quot; (closed housing estate) and is the object of desire of the upper classes. Such a place is a small town with its own infrastructure (reserve power supply, sanitation, and security guards). The purpose of such a community is to protect its residents from exterior violence. The same philosophy is seen on closed buildings and most shopping centres (many of them can only be accessed from inside the parking lot or the garage).

In Mexico, the most common form of a gated community is called privada, fraccionamiento, or condominio, in which privadas and fraccionamientos are mostly composed of individual, single-family houses grouped, these may vary on size and shape, sometimes, houses will be individually developed and built while in others (primarily in fraccionamientos) houses are of the same design and shape. In fraccionamientos, these houses may have access to amenities within the gated zone as well, such as parks, gyms, party rooms, pools and maintenance by the residential&#x27;s administration. Condominios are commonly similar to fraccionamientos and privadas, but applied in a scheme of apartment buildings.

In Pakistan, gated communities are located in big as well as small cities and are considered the standard of high quality living. Defence Housing Authority and Bahria Town are major private gated community developers and administrators and one of the largest in the world. The assets of Bahria Town itself are worth $30 billion. Most gated communities in Pakistan have public parks, schools, hospitals, shopping malls, gymnasiums, and country clubs.

In Argentina, they are called &quot;barrios privados&quot;&quot; (literal translation &quot;private neighbourhoods&quot;) or just &quot;countries&quot; (which comes from a shortening of the term &quot;country club&quot;) and are often seen as a symbol of wealth. However, gated communities enjoy dubious social prestige (many members of the middle and upper middle class regard gated community dwellers as &quot;nouveaux riches&quot; or snobs). While most gated communities have only houses, some bigger ones, such as Nordelta, have their own hospital, school, shopping mall, and more.

In post-apartheid South Africa, gated communities have mushroomed in response to high levels of violent crime. They are commonly referred to as &quot;complexes&quot; but also broadly classified as &quot;security villages&quot; (large-scale privately developed areas) or &quot;enclosed neighbourhoods&quot;. Some of the newest neighbourhoods being developed are almost entirely composed of security villages, some with malls and few other essential services (such as hospitals). In part, property developers have adopted this response to counter squatting, which local residents fear due to associated crime, and which often results in a protracted eviction process.

They are popular in southern China and Hong Kong, where most of the new apartment compounds have 24/7 guards on duty, and for some high-end residences, facial recognition systems to grant residents and domestic workers entry into the compound. The most famous of which is Clifford Estates in Guangzhou.

In Saudi Arabia, gated communities have existed since the discovery of oil, mainly to accommodate families from Europe or North America. After threat levels increased from the late 1990s on against foreigners in general and U.S. citizens in particular, gates became armed, sometimes heavily, and all vehicles are inspected. Marksmen and Saudi Arabian National Guard armored vehicles appeared in certain times, markedly after recent terrorist attacks in areas near-by, targeting people from European or North American countries.

Gated communities are rare in continental Europe and Japan.

==Criticism==

Proponents of gated communities (and to a lesser degree, of cul-de-sacs) maintain that the reduction or exclusion of people who would be only passing through, or more generally, of all non-local people, makes any &quot;stranger&quot; much more recognisable in the closed local environment, and thus reduces crime danger. However, some have argued that, since only a very small proportion of all non-local people passing through the area are potential criminals, increased traffic should increase rather than decrease safety by having more people around whose presence could deter criminal behaviour or who could provide assistance during an incident.

Another criticism is that gated communities offer a false sense of security. Some studies indicate that safety in gated communities may be more illusion than reality and that gated communities in suburban areas of the United States have no less crime than similar non-gated neighbourhoods.

A commentary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; specifically blames the gated communities for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin as the columnist states that &quot;gated communities churn a vicious cycle by attracting like-minded residents who seek shelter from outsiders and whose physical seclusion then worsens paranoid groupthink against outsiders.&quot;

In a paper, Vanessa Watson includes gated communities within a class of &quot;African urban fantasies&quot;: attempts to remake African cities in the vein of Dubai or Singapore. In Watson&#x27;s analysis, this kind of urban planning prizes exclusionary and self-contained spaces that limit opportunities for interaction between different classes, while worsening marginalization of the urban poor.

A study done by Breetzke, Landman &amp; Cohn (2014) had investigated the effect of gated communities on individual&#x27;s risk of burglary victimization in South Africa. Results shown that not only are gated communities not able to reduce burglary, but even facilitate criminal activities. For both the gated communities and the areas surrounding them, the densities of burglary were found to be four times higher than that of Tshwane. The crime rates did not decrease in areas that were far away from the gated communities. Also, the high risk of burglaries was found consistent in both daytime and night-time. As this research on the effect of gated communities in South Africa reflects a negative correlation between the use of gated communities and crime prevention, the effectiveness of gated communities is in doubt.

==Common economic model types==
* Life-style — country clubs, retirement developments.
* Prestige — gates for status appeal
* Physical security communities — gates for crime and traffic.
* Purpose-designed communities — catering to foreigners (e.g. worker compounds in Mid-West Asia, built largely for the oil industry)

== Comparison to closed cities ==

Closed cities are different from the gated communities.

* The guard duty in closed cities is free to residents (paid by taxes).
* The public transport in closed cities may go with transit checkpoints or checking passes/passports at technical stops and available to others outside the security area. Within a gated community in the best cases, the bus stop is opposite the checkpoint; a few offer free buses. Via gated communities buses go due to easement or good will.
* Fares and communal payments in closed cities are often equal (in all cases, not greater), if it would be a common city. In gated communities, service companies raise non legally fixed tariffs because it is difficult for those communities either to negotiate lower terms or knock out this service company (in most cases, the result is no quorum).

==Countries==

A limited number of gated communities have long been established for foreigners in various countries of the world:

* The worker compounds in the Middle East, built largely for the oil industry.
* The Arbor Oaks subdivision in El Monte, California, which appears in the film &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; as &quot;Hilldale&quot;, is now gated because of the fans coming to see it in person. Residents are sometimes angry at fans who come by the development.

=== Argentina ===

There are many gated communities in Argentina, especially in Greater Buenos Aires, in the suburb of Pilar, 60 km N of Buenos Aires city, and in other suburban areas, such as Nordelta. Tortugas Country Club was the first gated community developed in Argentina, dating from the 1930s/1940s, but most date from the 1990s, when liberal reforms were consolidated.

Since Buenos Aires has been traditionally regarded as a socially integrated city, gated communities have been the subject of research by sociologists. Gated communities are an important way through middle and upper-class people cope with insecurity in Greater Buenos Aires.

As Mara Dicenta writes, &quot;The story of Nordelta exposes how violent environments are enacted through whiteness and drives for elite distinction. Exemplified by Nordelta, MPCs generate profit by transforming rural into elite lands while rearticulating racial and spatial borders that make distinctions sharper, more guarded, and less porous—between centers and peripheries, grounded and flooded lands, or poachers and conservationists. MPCs originated in the U.S. and continue to circulate American imaginaries of race, segregation, and neoliberal commons worldwide. In this process, they are met with different forms of slow violence rooted in colonial and postcolonial national geographies. Furthermore, in seeking to capitalize on those racialized differences, global real estate corporations also circulate and help materialize homogenizing visions of racial formation.&quot;

=== Australia ===
Although gated communities have been rare in Australia, since the 1980s, a few have been built. The most well-known are those at Hope Island, in particular Sanctuary Cove, on the Gold Coast of Queensland. Other similar projects are being built in the area. In Victoria, the first such development is Sanctuary Lakes, in the local government area of Wyndham, about 16 km south west of Melbourne. In New South Wales, there is Macquarie Links gated community as well as Southgate Estate gated community. Many Australian gated communities are built within private golf courses.

In the ACT, the only example is Uriarra Village, based around community horse paddocks and dwellings jointly managed through strata title.

=== Bangladesh ===
The trade association for real estate developers in Bangladesh, RAJUK, stated in 2021 that the capital city Dhaka had approximately 25 gated communities. While RAJUK claimed that these communities adhered to the global standard of keeping 60% of the land in the gated community for open spaces and common use, the Bangladesh Institute of Planners disputed this claim, advocating for fewer gated communities in the city centres.

=== Brazil ===

Brazil also has many gated communities, particularly in the metropolitan regions Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. For example, one of São Paulo&#x27;s suburbs, Tamboré, has at least 6 such compounds known as Tamboré 1, 2, 3, and so on. Each consists of generously spaced detached houses with very little to separate front gardens.

One of the first large-scale gated community projects in São Paulo city region was Barueri&#x27;s Alphaville, planned and constructed during the 1970s military dictatorship when the big cities of Brazil faced steep increases of car ownership by the middle and higher-classes, rural exodus, poverty, crime, urban sprawl, and downtown decay.

=== Canada ===
Neighbourhoods with &quot;physical&quot; or explicit gating with security checkpoints and patrols are extremely rare, being absent in even some of Canada&#x27;s richest neighbourhoods such as Bridle Path, Toronto. Furthermore, municipal planning laws in many Canadian provinces ban locked gates on public roads as a health issue since they deny emergency vehicles quick access.

A noted exception in Canada is Arbutus Ridge, an age-restricted community constructed between 1988 and 1992 on the southeastern coast of Vancouver Island.

More common in most Canadian neighbourhoods, especially the largest cities, is an implicit or symbolic gating which effectively partitions the private infrastructure and amenities of these communities from their surrounding neighbourhoods. A classic example of this is the affluent Montreal suburb of Mount Royal, which has a long fence running along its side of L&#x27;Acadie Boulevard that for all intents and purposes separates the community from the more working-class neighbourhood of Park Extension. Also, many newer suburban subdivisions employ decorative gates to give the impression of exclusivity and seclusion. Some gated communities have been planned in recent years in Greater Toronto, although they are infrequent.

=== China ===
In China, some of these compounds, like most other gated communities around the world, target the rich. Also many foreigners live in gated communities in Beijing. Often foreign companies choose the locations where their foreign employees will live, and in most cases, they pay the rent and associated costs (e.g. management fees and garden work).

Similar communities exist in Shanghai, another major Chinese city. Shanghai Links, an exclusive expatriate community enclosing a golf course and the Pudong campus of Shanghai American School, is an example. The Shanghai Links project began in 1994 with the signing by the then Prime Minister of Canada, Honourable Jean Chretien, of a Memorandum of Agreement with the Shanghai Pudong New Area Government controlled company, Huaxia Tourism Development Company. Other notable gated communities in Shanghai include Seasons Villas, a development by Hutchinson Whampoa; Thomson Golf Villas, and Green Villas.

Other gated communities in China such as those in the Daxing District of Beijing enclose the homes of rural migrants. These are intended to reduce crime and increase public order and safety, which the Chinese Communist Party-run &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; claims it has, by 73%. The system is controversial as it segregates migrants and the poor, with some claiming its true purpose is to keep track of migrants, but it is scheduled for implementation in Changping District also.

=== Ecuador ===
Ecuador has many gated communities, mostly in Guayaquil and Quito. In the coastal city of Guayaquil, gated communities are mostly located in Samborondón, and in Quito in the valleys surrounding the city. These are home mostly for the wealthiest. However, there is a trend -especially in Guayaquil- of houses in gated communities with moderate prices.

=== Egypt ===
Due to the population boom and an increasing class segregation, gated communities have been more and more established in Egypt since the 1970s. Greater Cairo, for example, is home to El Rehab and Dreamland, Mountain View Egypt. There is also El Maamoura in Alexandria. They were criticized for being a niche market that fails to address the crippling congestion problem in Cairo.

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, some gated communities are luxurious (with up to 740 square metres (8000 sq ft)), and some are very affordable (with lots ranging from 40 to 120 square metres). From 2000, most of the new residential areas built by private developers are mostly composed of gated communities. Examples include the residential areas of Bumi Serpong Damai in South Tangerang, Tropicana Residence Community in Tangerang City, Telaga Golf Sawangan and Pesona Khayangan in Depok, and Sentul City in Bogor Regency. Gated communities in Indonesia still allow outsiders to use some of the facilities inside the community because there is a regulation that the social facilities in the residential development should be handed to the local government to be used by the public.

=== Italy ===
Two examples of gated community in Italy are Olgiata in Rome and the village of Roccamare, in Castiglione della Pescaia, Tuscany.

=== Lebanon ===
Because of the pollution, the lack of proper infrastructure, electrical power and green spaces in residential areas outside of Beirut, the high class society chooses to reside in gated communities for a better living environment.

Gated communities in Lebanon are mainly in the suburbs of the capital city Beirut.

=== Malaysia ===
In Malaysia, these are known as Gated and Guarded Communities and have been seeing a steady increase in popularity. Currently, according to the Town and Country Planning Department, there are four types of gated communities in Malaysia, namely:
# Elite community: this type of gated community is primarily occupied by the upper-class or high-income group of people. It focuses on exclusion and status in which security is one of the major concerns due to the resident&#x27;s status within the community.
# Lifestyle community: the lifestyle community generally consists of retirement communities, leisure communities and suburban &#x27;new towns&#x27;. Activities inside these communities can include golf courses, horseback riding and residents-oriented leisure activities.
# Security zone community: the security zone community is the most popular type of gated community in which it offers a housing development that is surrounded by fences or gates. This development is normally provided with guard services.
# Security zone community and lifestyle: this type of gated community housing development is usually developed within a city centre. It focuses on both the security aspect and the provision of lifestyle facilities for its residents.

The gated community is a concept that emerged in response to the rise of safety and security issues, and offers more advantages in terms of a calm environment and enhanced safety that is ideal for family development.

=== Mauritius ===
Several gated communities now exist on the island of Mauritius since the government introduced Integrated Resort Schemes (IRS) and Real Estate Schemes (RES) in the mid-1990s. Recently they have been amalgamated into Property Development Schemes (PDS). The government also introduced Smart City permits and in 2016 it secured the assistance of Saudi Arabia to launch the government&#x27;s version of a gated Smart City known as Heritage City Project which was proposed at Minissy, in the region of Ebène, with the assistance of Saudi Arabia.

=== Mexico ===
Gated communities in Mexico are a result of the huge income gap existing in the country. A 2008 study found that the average income in an urban area of Mexico was $26,654, a rate higher than advanced regions like Spain or Greece while the average income in rural areas (sometimes just a short distance away) was only $8,403. This close a proximity of wealth and poverty has created a large security risk for Mexico&#x27;s middle class. Gated communities can be found in virtually every medium and large-sized city in Mexico with the largest found in major cities, such as Monterrey, Mexico City or Guadalajara.

Luxury or &quot;status&quot; gated communities are very popular with middle to high income residents in Mexico. Gated luxury communities in Mexico are considerably cheaper than in countries such as the United States while retaining houses of similar size and quality due to the commonness of the communities and the lower cost to build them and are priced lower to attract middle class residents.

Many gated communities in Mexico have fully independent and self-contained infrastructure, such as schools, water and power facilities, security and fire forces, and medical facilities. Some of the larger gated communities even retain their own school districts and police departments. The Interlomas area of Mexico City contains hundreds of gated communities and is the largest concentration of gated communities in the world, stretching over . The surrounding areas of Santa Fe, Bosques-Lomas, Interlomas-Bosque Real, are also made up predominantly of gated communities and span over 30% of Greater Mexico City.

Many smaller gated communities in Mexico are not officially classified as separate gated communities as many municipal rules prohibit closed off roads. Most of these small neighbourhoods cater to lower middle income residents and offer a close perimeter and check points similar to an &quot;authentic&quot; gated community. This situation is tolerated and sometimes even promoted by some city governments due to the lack of capacity to provide reliable and trusted security forces.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, gated communities have been developed in suburban areas of the main cities since the 1980s and 1990s.

=== Nigeria ===
Gated communities are widespread in Nigeria, where they are often referred to as housing estates or villas. These estates can cover between 50 and 100 hectares, with one, the Gwarimpa estate, spanning more than a thousand hectares. Additionally, some of them offer amenities like schools, daycares, gyms, playgrounds, supermarkets and parks. In urban centers like Lagos, Lagos Island, and Abuja, a number of estates are luxury estates catering exclusively to Nigeria&#x27;s upper class, including politicians, government officials, CEOs, and celebrities. In contrast, there are also more affordable estates which target Nigeria&#x27;s middle class. 

Gated communities appeal to Nigerians primarily because of the exclusivity and sense of security they provide. Many estates have tightly controlled entrances, ensuring that unauthorized or unfamiliar individuals cannot gain access. 

Another form of gated community common in Nigeria is the quarters, typically developed and reserved for employees of a particular organization and their families. For example, many Nigerian universities, including the University of Ibadan have staff quarters. These staff quarters are usually located within or near the organization&#x27;s premises.

=== Pakistan ===

Pakistan has a very large number of gated communities, most of which target middle class Pakistanis. The largest being Bahria Town, which is also the largest in Asia and has communities in major cities. Defence Housing Authority is also a major developer of gated communities.

Others include WAPDA Town, Gulberg, Islamabad and Schon Properties, while Emaar Properties also maintains several gated communities in the country targeting primarily upper class people. Gated communities in Pakistan are mostly immune from problems of law enforcement and lack of energy faced by the majority of the other housing societies. In a short time, the property prices in such communities have greatly increased – in 2007 a 20-square-meter house in Bahria Town, Lahore cost around four million Pakistani rupees ($40,000); a similar property in 2012 costed nine million rupees, while houses are priced around 100-300 million rupees. The Bahria Town of Karachi is currently constructing Rafi Cricket Stadium, when completed will be the largest stadium in the country and Grand Jamia Mosque, when completed will be the largest in South Asia and third-largest in the world.

=== Peru ===
Lima, Peru has several gated communities, especially in the wealthy districts of La Molina and Santiago de Surco. They are home to many prominent Peruvians. 

=== Philippines ===
The Philippines has a large number of gated communities which are known in Philippine English as &quot;subdivisions&quot; or &quot;villages&quot;. Gated communities represent one of the main residency types for upper and middle class Filipinos up and down the country, along with condominiums. Regardless of their names, such communities may either form part of a larger barangay (village), or constitute a single barangay in and of themselves. Gated communities are often grouped by the phase of build, or by project number, and homes within these communities are designated with a lot and block number on a street as opposed to conventional house numbers or building names. Gated communities are divided between two types:

# Executive subdivisions/villages: Along with condominiums, these are the residential neighbourhoods of the wealthiest in Philippine society. Examples of these include Bel-Air, Greenwoods Executive Villages, Magallanes village, Dasmarinas Village and Ayala Alabang village.
# Subdivisions/villages: Gated communities targeted to the Philippine middle classes. These may begin with a name and end with a number E.g. &quot;Kalayaan Village 3&quot;, the 3 designating that it is the third subdivision project for the land development company under the &quot;Kalayaan&quot; homes project. Examples of subdivisions include BF Homes, Camella Homes, among a majority of wealthier suburban areas.

=== Russia ===

Aerobus live complex is the &quot;de facto&quot; first gated community in Moscow. Business center is in this complex but outside the residential area.

Potapovo (known as New Moscow, but developed with North Butovo to RAS members) - known as fenced Kommunarka-Butovo road between 1994-2000 and Moscow had to build another road. Service company has bus license and guard wearing uniform is always in a bus (not usual even in strict restricted acsess). Later they opened trade center but neither allowed to cut the corner or use 2 entrances (from northbound). Fence lowers effectiveness of bus routes and direct or loop extension of line 12. This area set to order bus on demand but paxes ordered to walk outside.

&quot;Ozero&quot; is a cooperative formed around Vladimir Putin&#x27;s dacha on Lake Komsomolskoe (), Priozersky District, Leningrad Oblast.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
In Saudi Arabia, many expatriate workers are required to live in company-provided housing. After the 2003 attack on Al Hambra, Jadawel, Siyanco and Vinell by militant Saudi dissidents, the government established tight military security for those compounds with large western populations. Many western individuals also reside in the many other gated compounds or non-gated villas and apartments in the cities that they work. Saudi Aramco provides a compound in Dhahran which is one of the largest of its kind within Saudi Arabia. Gated communities are also popular with many Saudis, which accounts for the limited availability of open villas in these communities and the premium rent paid for that housing. These compounds can be found in many of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s cities, including but not limited to Abha, Dhahran, Riyadh, and Taif.

=== Singapore ===
Sentosa Cove is the only gated residential community in Singapore, containing 350 bungalows on a 99-year leasehold term. It is the only landed housing that can be purchased by non-citizens. Despite this, as of 2021, the properties transact at a lower price to comparable areas on the mainland.

=== South Africa ===
South Africa has an increasing number of gated communities, where the wealthy sometimes live in close proximity to the urban poor (yet with little contact between the two).

=== Thailand ===
Many housing estates in Thailand take the form of gated communities, targeted to the upper and middle classes. They may be managed by the development company or by resident committees.

Gated communities are often referred to as mubans in Thailand.

=== Turkey ===
Turkey has several gated communities, especially in Istanbul and Ankara. Called &quot;site&quot; in Turkish, they are mostly located around the edge of the city.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
In the United Arab Emirates, gated communities have exploded in popularity, particularly in Dubai, where the 2002 decision to allow foreigners to own freehold properties has resulted in the construction of numerous such communities built along various themes. Examples include The Lakes, Springs, Meadows, and Arabian Ranches.

=== United Kingdom ===

Gated communities were established in the late 1920s in response to the increasing crime rates in cities. The first gated community was established in 1928 by John Galsworthy on the outskirts of London. In the United Kingdom, gated communities are relatively rare. In 2004 there were an estimated 1,000 such communities in England (i.e. not including Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). As of 2002, the majority of these communities were found to be in the South East and most were small developments; only four local authorities had one or more gated communities with over 300 dwellings. They generally consisted of a gated street of up to 60 or 100 houses, or a single block of flats.

The bulk of gated communities in the United Kingdom have been constructed by private developers, with smaller proportions built by social landlords and through public-private partnerships. Research has found that they typically exist within surrounding areas that are also highly affluent, if not necessarily gated. It has been noted that as far as buyer motivation is concerned, issues of security, exclusivity and prestige were often subsumed by a desire to obtain property that would maintain its value. Although the appeal of these communities is said to be mainly be to &quot;young affluent singles&quot; and older couples, this varies significantly according to location and the availability of accommodation types. Unlike in America, marketing materials rarely refer to any community aspect of living in a gated development.
There is &quot;considerable diversity in terms of the built form&quot; of gated communities. In London, many new-build and converted spaces that have been turned into gated communities consist largely of flats and are therefore unlikely to be suitable for families. The redevelopment of these inner city sites for &quot;secure, upscale, condominium-style housing in central London&quot; was partly fuelled by a cultural shift among young professionals towards &quot;loft-living&quot; in the city centre. Examples from London include the Docklands developments of New Caledonian Wharf, Kings and Queen Wharf and Pan Peninsula, and East London locations like the Bow Quarter in Bow.

Outside London, gated communities tend to be more spacious. The most prestigious gated communities, or &quot;private estates&quot;, are generally seen as being those around the fringes of London; these include the large estates at St George&#x27;s Hill and Wentworth, both of which are in Surrey. In general, there is a heavy concentration around Surrey&#x27;s Cobham-Esher-Weybridge triangle – examples are Burwood Park and Kingswood Warren, while Blackhills and Clare Hill represent smaller competitors with somewhat lower property values. In suburban Kent, Keston Park and Farnborough Park are most notable.

=== United States ===

The earliest American gated communities date to the 1850s, though it was in the early 1900s when they first began to proliferate. Most gated communities are today located in the Sun Belt region in the South and West, where there is more land available for development. They are usually developed privately and for this reason it is difficult to determine the total number. Although they are often unincorporated, there are numerous incorporated gated cities in Southern California, namely Bradbury, Canyon Lake, Hidden Hills, Laguna Woods, and Rolling Hills.

In 2002, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that approximately 40% of new builds in California were behind walls. By 1997, an estimated 20,000 gated communities had been built across the country. That year, estimates of the number of people in gated communities ranged from 4 million in 30,000 communities up to around 8 million. This growth continued and by 2009 figures from the American Housing Survey indicated that the number of people living in gated communities had risen to 11 million households. Setha Low, a psychologist who has studied gated communities and their residents, suggested this was likely an underestimate.
The notion that gated communities in the United States are &quot;bastions of affluence&quot; has been challenged by academic research. A 2005 study published in the &quot;Journal of Planning Education and Research&quot; revealed they often contain both owner-occupied and renter-occupied properties and that socioeconomic status and income levels can vary significantly across communities. Criminologists Nicholas Branic and Charis Kubrin have argued that the &quot;affluent, high socioeconomic status gated communities&quot; of popular imagination in fact represent just one type of gated community.

Ed Blakely distinguishes between &quot;prestige communities&quot; of the rich and socially distinguished and &quot;security zones&quot;, in which safety is the main goal. Nevertheless, much of the literature points to gated communities as contributing to greater social seclusion and segregation. Common motivations for moving into them are fear of crime and a desire to escape demographic change — gated communities are generally ethnically homogenous. Alternatively, a 2015 &quot;Urban Studies&quot; article argued that while gated communities in the southwestern United States entrenched social segregation, no effect was present for racial segregation, as the streets they bordered tended to already be segregated on a racial level.

===Uruguay===

Gated communities in Uruguay are known locally as &#x27;barrios privados&#x27; or private neighbourhoods. There is no official data on how widespread gated communities in Uruguay are, but by 2013 at least 20 were known to exist in the Maldonado Department, seven in the Canelones Department, seven in Rocha, one in Soriano, and two in Rio Negro. Gated communities had experienced &quot;huge growth&quot; by 2020, and were a popular choice for foreigners with families, although rental returns are reportedly low and the properties will not necessarily appreciate in value. While socially exclusive areas exist in the capital Montevideo, such as the Carrasco barrio, the closing of streets is not permitted and attempts to build gated communities within the city limits have been refused.

Contrary to what might be assumed, research has found that gated communities in this country do not increase residential segregation as they select for affluent people who already experience a high degree of segregation. These residents tend to be a very homogenous group in age, family stage, and social class. La Tahona and Carmel are two of the most prominent gated communities located just outside Montevideo in the Canelones Department and nearby to the Zonamerica business park and Carrasco International Airport. La Tahona and Carmel both adjoin Camino de los Horneros, a road immediately north of Ciudad de la Costa that connects to multiple gated communities with 2000 homes in total, though these numbers are expected to eventually treble. Numerous gated communities have also been constructed in Punta Del Este.

Demand for gated communities in Uruguay has increased in recent years due to the growing availability of remote working, and amenities like swimming pools can be found more often than in Montevideo. They have also become more accessible to the middle class as pre-designed new builds have become common, as opposed to the older model of requiring individual owners to buy a plot and then hire their own builder. The resulting economies of scale have helped to keep average prices lower than they otherwise would be.

<doc id="316681" wikidata="Q1440435" url="?curid=316681" title="Fragile base class">
<text>The fragile base class problem is a fundamental architectural problem of object-oriented programming systems where base classes (superclasses) are considered &quot;fragile&quot; because seemingly safe modifications to a base class, when inherited by the derived classes, may cause the derived classes to malfunction. The programmer cannot determine whether a base class change is safe simply by examining in isolation the methods of the base class.

One possible solution is to make instance variables private to their defining class and force subclasses to use accessors to modify superclass states. A language could also make it so that subclasses can control which inherited methods are exposed publicly. These changes prevent subclasses from relying on implementation details of superclasses and allow subclasses to expose only those superclass methods that are applicable to themselves.

An alternative solution is to have an interface instead of superclass.

The fragile base class problem has been blamed on open recursion (dynamic dispatch of methods on codice_1), with the suggestion that invoking methods on codice_2 default to closed recursion (static dispatch, early binding) rather than open recursion (dynamic dispatch, late binding), only using open recursion when it is specifically requested; external calls (not using codice_2) would be dynamically dispatched as usual.

==Java example==
The following trivial example is written in the Java programming language and shows how a seemingly safe modification of a base class can cause an inheriting subclass to malfunction by entering an infinite recursion which will result in a stack overflow.

class Super {
 private int counter = 0;

 void inc1() {
 counter++;

 void inc2() {
 counter++;
}

class Sub extends Super {
 @Override
 void inc2() {
 inc1();
}
Calling the dynamically bound method &quot;inc2()&quot; on an instance of &quot;Sub&quot; will correctly increase the field &quot;counter&quot; by one. If however the code of the superclass is changed in the following way:

class Super {

 private int counter = 0;

 void inc1() {
 inc2();

 void inc2() {
 counter++;
}
a call to the dynamically bound method &quot;inc2()&quot; on an instance of &quot;Sub&quot; will cause an infinite recursion between itself and the method &quot;inc1()&quot; of the super-class and eventually cause a stack overflow. This problem could have been avoided, by declaring the methods in the superclass as final, which would make it impossible for a sub-class to override them. However, this is not always desirable or possible. Therefore, it is good practice for super-classes to avoid changing calls to dynamically-bound methods.

==Solutions==
* Objective-C has categories as well as non-fragile instance variables.
* Component Pascal deprecates superclass calls.
* Java, C++ (Since C++11) and D allow inheritance or overriding a class method to be prohibited by labeling a declaration of a class or method, respectively, with the keyword &quot;codice_4&quot;. In the book &quot;Effective Java&quot;, author Joshua Bloch writes (in item 17) that programmers should &quot;Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it&quot;.
* C# and VB.NET like Java have &quot;codice_5&quot; and &quot;codice_6&quot; class declaration keywords to prohibit inheritance, and require a subclass to use keyword &quot;codice_7&quot; on overriding methods, the same solution later adopted by Scala.
* Scala require a subclass to use keyword &quot;codice_7&quot; explicitly in order to override a parent class method. In the book &quot;Programming in Scala, 2nd Edition&quot;, the author writes that (with modifications here) If there was no method f(), the client’s original implementation of method f() could not have had an override modifier. Once you add the f() method to the second version of your library class, a recompile of the client code would give an compile error instead of wrong behavior.
* In Kotlin classes and methods are final by default. To enable the class inheritance, the class should be marked with the codice_9 modifier. Likewise, a method should be marked as codice_9 to allow overriding of the method.
* Julia allows only subtyping of abstract types and uses composition as an alternative to inheritance. It however has multiple dispatch.

<doc id="316682" wikidata="Q1193976" url="?curid=316682" title="SuperDrive">
<text>SuperDrive is the product name for a floppy disk drive and later an optical disc drive made and marketed by Apple Inc. The name was initially used for what Apple called their high-density floppy disk drive, and later for the internal CD and DVD drive integrated with Apple computers. Though Apple no longer manufactures computers that feature built-in SuperDrives, the name is still used when referring to Apple&#x27;s external CD and DVD drive accessory (pictured).

==Floppy disk drive==

The term was first used by Apple Computer in 1988 to refer to their 1.44 MB 3.5 inch floppy drive. This replaced the older 800 KB floppy drive that had been standard in the Macintosh up to then, but remained compatible in that it could continue to read and write both 800 KB (double-sided) and 400 KB (single-sided) floppy disks, as well as the newer high-density floppies.

This drive was also capable of reading and writing MS-DOS formatted disks and FAT12 file formats, using PC Exchange or other software, unlike the 400 KB and 800 KB drives. This was made possible as the SuperDrive now utilitized the same MFM (Modified Frequency Modulation) encoding scheme used by the IBM PC, yet still retained backward compatibility with Apple&#x27;s variable-speed zoned CAV scheme and group coded recording encoding format, so it could continue to read Macintosh MFS, HFS and Apple II ProDOS formats on 400/800 KB disks.

Introduced in 1988 under the Trademark name &quot;FDHD&quot; (Floppy Disk High Density), the subsequently renamed SuperDrive was known primarily as an internally mounted floppy drive that was part of the Macintosh computer; however, an external version of the drive was manufactured that came in a Snow White-styled plastic case.
While the external drive worked on both Apple&#x27;s product lines, it was mainly intended for use on the Apple II series, for which Apple introduced in 1991 a slot-based interface called the Apple II 3.5 Disk Controller Card for Apple IIe and II computers so they too could use 1.40 MB storage and read/write MS-DOS. The controller card as well as the external Superdrive were discontinued in June 1994.

The SuperDrive cannot be used with the original four Mac models (Macintosh 128K through Macintosh Plus), as their disk controller (the IWM) doesn&#x27;t support high density. The next two models to be released (Macintosh II &amp; Macintosh SE (1987)) also shipped with that controller; a SuperDrive connected to them will behave as an 800 KB drive. These two models can be upgraded via the M0244 upgrade kit (which replaces the IWM disk controller with the SWIM) and gain full use of the SuperDrive. All later models shipped with the SWIM.

The first Macintosh model to include a SuperDrive floppy drive was the Macintosh IIx (1988). Every Macintosh and PowerBook introduced from 1988 to 1997 (with the exception of the PowerBook 100, PowerBook Duo series, and PowerBook 2400c, which offered a proprietary external floppy drive as an option), had a built-in SuperDrive floppy drive. The last model to include one was the beige Power Macintosh G3 series, which was manufactured until January 1999.

The PowerBook G3 1998 model (a.k.a. Wallstreet) had an optional floppy drive module. The PowerBook 190 series, PowerBook 5300 Series, PowerBook 3400c, and original PowerBook G3 shared the same interchangeable floppy drive module as a standard feature. The drive as mounted on PowerBooks lacked the auto-inject feature of Apple&#x27;s initial desktop SuperDrive implementation, requiring the user to manually insert the disk all the way into the drive. The feature was dropped throughout the lineup during 1993–94.

The PowerBook 1400 series also had a floppy drive module, but was incompatible with the other PowerBooks. The end of the SuperDrive coincides with the demise of Old World ROM Macs; with the advent of the New World ROM machines, Apple stopped offering internal floppy drives on all models. The SuperDrive is not supported in Mac OS X, not even on the few Old World ROM machines that can officially run OS X.

==Internal CD and DVD drive==

Once the use of floppy disks started declining, Apple reused the trademark to refer to the optical drives built into its Macintosh models, which could read and write both DVDs and CDs. The early 2001 release of the Power Mac G4 was the first Macintosh to include a SuperDrive. SuperDrives featured 6–24x write speeds and supported the DVD±R, DVD±RW, CD-R, and CD-RW formats along with all normal read-only media. Some drive models used as SuperDrives are capable of reading DVD-RAM; on these drives, the ability to write to these discs is disabled. Apple never offered a Blu-ray drive or supported playback of the format. DVD±R DL Dual Layer DVD did not come out until 2005 and was not supported on the SuperDrive until the release of early 2005 models of PowerMac G5 which came with updated SuperDrives which supported DL recording on DL media.

Unlike tray-style disc holders which have an inner guide ring, slot-style drives will not work with MiniCD or MiniDVD discs (8 cm diameter instead of 12 cm) unless an 8 cm optical disc adapter is used, and extraction of the disc is difficult, requiring tweezers, use of a card with double-sided sticky tape, or complete disassembly of it.

The MacBook Air, released on January 29, 2008, is the first Macintosh to not include a SuperDrive after it became standard across the line. Apple began phasing SuperDrives out across the Macintosh line beginning on July 20, 2011. The updated second generation 13-inch MacBook Pro, released on June 11, 2012 and discontinued on October 27, 2016, is the last Macintosh to include a SuperDrive, while the Late 2011 was the last iMac model with the built in optical drive.

==External CD and DVD drive==
Apple has sold a USB-connected external SuperDrive as an accessory since 2008 with the introduction of the MacBook Air. The drive has faced criticism and mixed customer reviews, with 410 reviews averaging two and a half stars before Apple&#x27;s removal of customer reviews from their shopping website. Criticism includes the lack of support for Blu-ray or mini optical discs and malfunctions that make the drive inoperable, with no way to eject a stuck disc. On newer Mac computers, it also requires the additional purchase of a USB-C-to-USB-A adapter to connect.

<text>The Macintosh IIx is a personal computer designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer from September 1988 to October 1990. This model was introduced as an update to the original Macintosh II, replacing the 16 MHz Motorola 68020 CPU and 68881 FPU with a 68030 CPU and 68882 FPU running at the same clock speed. The initial price of the IIx was or for the version with a 40 MB hard drive.

The 800 KB floppy drive was replaced with a 1.44 MB SuperDrive; the IIx is the first Macintosh to include this as standard.

The Mac IIx included 0.25 KiB of L1 instruction CPU cache, 0.25 KiB of L1 data cache, a 16 MHz bus (1:1 with CPU speed), and supported up to System 7.5.5.

The IIx was the second of three Macintosh models to use this case allowing dual floppy drives and 6 NuBus slots; the last model was the Macintosh IIfx. Apple&#x27;s nomenclature of the time used the &quot;x&quot; to indicate the presence of the 68030 CPU as used in the Macintosh IIcx and IIvx.

Support and spare parts for the IIx were discontinued on August 31, 1998.

<doc id="316685" wikidata="Q420678" url="?curid=316685" title="Ornithine transcarbamylase">
<text>Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) (also called ornithine carbamoyltransferase) is an enzyme () that catalyzes the reaction between carbamoyl phosphate (CP) and ornithine (Orn) to form citrulline (Cit) and phosphate (Pi). There are two classes of OTC: anabolic and catabolic. This article focuses on anabolic OTC. Anabolic OTC facilitates the sixth step in the biosynthesis of the amino acid arginine in prokaryotes. In contrast, mammalian OTC plays an essential role in the urea cycle, the purpose of which is to capture toxic ammonia and transform it into urea, a less toxic nitrogen source, for excretion.

== Reaction mechanism ==
== Structure ==
OTC is a trimeric protein. There are three active sites of the protein which are located at the cleft between the monomers. The carbamoyl phosphate binding domain resides on the N-terminal end of each monomer, while the C-terminal end contains the binding domain for ornithine. Both binding domains have a similar structural pattern with a central parallel β-pleated sheet bordered by α-helices and loops. In addition to the binding domains, OTCs have SMG loops. These swing to close the binding site once both substrates have bound. SMG stands for the conserved amino acid motif of Ser-Met-Gly. Upon closure, these residues interact with L-ornithine. The binding of CP induces a global conformational change, while the binding of L-ornithine only induces movement of the SMG loop to close and isolate the activation site.

=== Active site ===

Ser-Thr-Arg-Thr-Arg motif from one subunit and a His from the neighboring subunit both interact with the phosphate group of CP for binding. Binding the primary nitrogen of CP are residues Gln, Cys, and Arg. The carbonyl oxygen of CP is bound by residues Thr, Arg, and His.

=== Amino acid composition ===
 Plant OTCs have the largest difference from other OTCs. There are 50 to 70% less Leu residues, while there are twice as many Arg residues. The number of subunits in OTCs vary from 322 to 340 residues. Animals have the highest density of Leu. This residue breakdown causes a pI for the animal enzyme of 6.8 while the plant enzyme has a pI of 7.6. Rat, bovine, and human OTC have the same C terminal residue of phenylalanine. Their N-terminal residues on the other hand differ. Rat ends with Ser, bovine with aspartate, and human with glycine.

== Genomics ==
The human OTC gene is located on the short arm of chromosome X (Xp21.1). The gene is located in the Watson (plus) strand and is 73 kbases in length. The open reading frame of 1,062 nucleotides is disbursed between 10 exons and nine introns. The encoded protein is 354 amino acids long with a predicted molecular weight of 39.935 kD. Postranscriptional modification leaves the mature peptide with 322 amino acids and a weight of 36.1 kD. The protein is located in the mitochondrial matrix. In mammals, OTC is expressed in the liver and small intestinal mucosa.

=== Human mutations ===
341 mutations in human OTC have been reported. At least 259 of these mutations are considered to be disease-causing mutations. 149 of these mutations are known to cause onset of hyperammonemia during the first weeks of life. 70 manifest as hyperammonemia in male patients later in life. Most of the mutations occur in known functional motifs, such as the SMG loop or CP binding domains.

==Deficiency==
Mutations in the OTC gene can cause Ornithine Transcarbamylase deficiency. It is classified as a urea cycle disorder due to the fact that without proper OTC function ammonia starts to accumulate in the blood. Accumulation of ammonia in the blood is known as hyperammonemia. Although toxic in excess, ammonia is a nitrogen source for the body. Therefore increased ammonia will also increase levels of the nitrogen-containing non-essential amino acids glutamate, glutamine, and alanine. Levels of carbamoyl phosphate (CP) will begin to drop as urea nitrogen levels in the blood decrease. This will cause CP to be diverted to the uridine monophosphate synthetic pathway. Orotic acid is a product of this pathway. Increased levels of orotic acid in urine can be an indicator that a patient is suffering from a disorder linked to hyperammonemia.

OTC deficiency manifests in both early and late onset forms.

=== Early onset ===
Early onset is seen in newborns. The symptoms of a urea cycle disorder are often not seen until the child is at home and may not be recognized in a timely manner by the family and primary care physician. Symptoms in young children with hyperammonemia are non-specific: not willing to eat, problems with breathing, body temperature, seizures, unusual body movements (twitches) and somnolence. As ammonia build up continues, symptoms progress from somnolence to lethargy potentially ending in a coma. Abnormal posturing (uncontrolled movement) and encephalopathy (brain damage) are often related to the degree of central nervous system swelling and pressure upon the brainstem. About 50% of neonates with severe hyperammonemia have seizures.

=== Late onset ===
In milder (or partial) urea cycle enzyme deficiencies, ammonia accumulation may be triggered by illness or stress at almost any time of life, resulting in multiple mild elevations of plasma ammonia concentration [Bourrier et al. 1988]. Patients with partial enzyme deficiencies may have a delay of symptoms for months or years. Indicators that you maybe suffering from OTC deficiency or a urea cycle disorder include &quot;episodes of delirium, erratic behavior, or reduced consciousness, headaches, vomiting, aversion to foods high in protein, and seizures.&quot;

=== Treatment ===
A potential treatment for the high ammonia levels is to give sodium benzoate, which combines with glycine to produce hippurate, at the same time removing an ammonium group. Biotin also plays an important role in the functioning of the OTC enzyme and has been shown to reduce ammonia intoxication in animal experiments. Additionally, the use of whole-body therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has been proposed and studied as a treatment. TH is thought to increase the effectiveness of dialysis to extract ammonia from the body.

<doc id="316697" wikidata="Q1053193" url="?curid=316697" title="Macintosh Centris">
<text>Macintosh Centris is a family of personal computers designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. in 1992 and 1993. They were introduced as a replacement for the six-year-old Macintosh II family of computers; the name was chosen to indicate that the consumer was selecting a Macintosh in the &quot;center&quot; of Apple&#x27;s product line. Centris machines were the first to offer Motorola 68040 CPUs at a price point around US$2,500, making them significantly less expensive (albeit slower and less expansion options) than Quadra computers, but also offering much higher performance than the Macintosh LC computers of the time powered by the Motorola 68030.

Apple released three computers bearing the Centris name: the Centris 610 (replacing the Macintosh IIsi) and Centris 650 (replacing the Macintosh IIci in form and the Quadra 700 in function), both of which were introduced in March 1993, and the multimedia-focused Centris 660AV which followed in July. Apple also planned for the Macintosh IIvx (although powered by the Motorola 68030) to be part of the Centris line, being released in October 1992, although Apple&#x27;s lawyers were unable to complete the trademark check on the &quot;Centris&quot; name in time for the IIvx&#x27;s release.

The retirement of the Centris name was announced in September 1993, with the 610, 650 and 660AV all being rebranded the following month as Macintosh Quadra machines as part of Apple&#x27;s effort to reposition their product families to correlate with customer markets instead of price ranges and features. The IIvx was also discontinued in favor of the newly announced Quadra 605.

==Overview==
When the Centris family was released, they offered considerably higher performance than the Macintosh LC which used the aging Motorola 68030 CPUs. To fit below the expensive Quadra family (consisting of the Quadra 800 and Quadra 950 each with 33 MHz 68040 CPUs (with the Quadra 700 soon to be discontinued) and later joined by the Quadra 840AV with its 40 MHz 68040), the Centris models had slower 20 MHz or 25 MHz 68040 CPUs (often the 68LC040 which omits the FPU), slower system buses, and lower RAM ceilings. 

The Centris 610 uses a 20 MHz 68LC040 CPU, which has no math coprocessor functions. It used a new &quot;pizza box&quot; case that was intended to be placed under the user&#x27;s computer monitor. The Centris 610 also provided the basis for the Workgroup Server 60. This case was also used for the Power Macintosh 6100 lines of computers and, when these later computers were introduced, Apple offered consumers a product upgrade path by letting them buy a new motherboard. Apple&#x27;s motherboard upgrades of this type were considered expensive, however, and were not a popular option. 

The base-configuration Centris 650 uses a 25 MHz 68LC040 lacking the FPU; while more expensive configurations with built-in Ethernet use the 25 MHz 68040 giving it similar performance to the recently discontinued Quadra 700. The Centris 650 uses the Macintosh IIvx-style desktop case which provides more expansion options than the Quadra 700 (limited by its Macintosh IIci-style mini-tower case).

The Centris 660AV uses a 25 MHz 68040 and also includes a 55 MHz AT&amp;T 3210 digital signal processor, compared to the faster Quadra 840AV powered by a 40 MHz 68040 and 66.7 MHz AT&amp;T 3210 DSP. Like other &quot;AV&quot; computers from Apple, the 660AV supports both video input and output. It uses the &quot;pizza box&quot; case which debuted earlier in the Centris 610.

The Centris 610 and 650 were replaced about six months after their introduction by the Quadra 610 and 650 models, which kept the same case and designs but raised the CPU speeds from 20 MHz and 25 MHz to 25 MHz and 33 MHz, respectively – while the Centris 660AV was renamed as the Quadra 660AV without any actual design change. These Macs also existed during Apple&#x27;s transition from auto-inject floppy drives to manual-inject drives. This is why there are two different styles of floppy drive bezel (faceplate) on these models. Some later Centris 660AV Macs have manual-inject floppy drives, so this change was not entirely concurrent with the name change.

<doc id="316711" wikidata="Q332635" url="?curid=316711" title="Johnny Winter">
<text>John Dawson Winter III (February 23, 1944 – July 16, 2014) was an American singer, guitarist, songwriter, and record producer. Winter was known for his high-energy blues rock albums, live performances, and slide guitar playing from the late 1960s into the early 2000s. He also produced three Grammy Award-winning albums for blues singer and guitarist Muddy Waters. After his time with Waters, Winter recorded several Grammy-nominated blues albums. In 1988, he was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame and in 2003, he was ranked 63rd in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

== Early life ==
Johnny Winter was born in Beaumont, Texas, on February 23, 1944. He and his younger brother Edgar Winter (born 1946) were nurtured at an early age by their parents in musical pursuits. Both were born with albinism. Their father, Leland, Mississippi native John Dawson Winter Jr. (1909–2001), was also a musician who played saxophone and guitar and sang at churches, weddings, Kiwanis and Rotary Club gatherings. Johnny and his brother began performing at an early age. When Winter was ten years old, the brothers appeared on a local children&#x27;s show with Johnny playing ukulele.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
His recording career began at the age of 15, when his band Johnny and the Jammers released &quot;School Day Blues&quot; on a Houston record label. During that same period, he was able to see performances by classic blues artists such as Muddy Waters, B.B. King, and Bobby Bland. In the early days, Winter would sometimes sit in with Roy Head and the Traits when they performed in the Beaumont area, and in 1967, Winter recorded a single with the Traits: &quot;Tramp&quot; backed with &quot;Parchman Farm&quot; (Universal Records 30496). In 1968, he released his first album &quot;The Progressive Blues Experiment&quot;, on Austin&#x27;s Sonobeat Records.

=== Signing with Columbia Records ===

Winter got his biggest break in December 1968, when Mike Bloomfield, whom he met and jammed with in Chicago, invited him to sing and play a song during a Bloomfield and Al Kooper concert at the Fillmore East in New York City. As it happened, representatives of Columbia Records (which had released the Top Ten Bloomfield/Kooper/Stills &quot;Super Session&quot; album) were at the concert. Winter played and sang B.B. King&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s My Own Fault&quot; to loud applause, and within a few days, was signed to what was reportedly the largest advance in the history of the recording industry at that time—$600,000.

Winter&#x27;s first Columbia album, &quot;Johnny Winter&quot;, was recorded and released in 1969. It featured the same backing musicians with whom he had recorded &quot;The Progressive Blues Experiment&quot;, bassist Tommy Shannon and drummer Uncle John Turner, plus Edgar Winter on keyboards and saxophone on 2 tracks, and (for his &quot;Mean Mistreater&quot;) Willie Dixon on upright bass and Big Walter Horton on harmonica. The album featured a few selections that became Winter signature songs, including his song &quot;Dallas&quot; (an acoustic blues, on which Winter played a steel-bodied, resonator guitar), John Lee &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Little School Girl&quot;, and B.B. King&#x27;s &quot;Be Careful with a Fool&quot;.

The album&#x27;s success coincided with Imperial Records picking up &quot;The Progressive Blues Experiment&quot; for wider release. The same year, the Winter trio toured and performed at several rock festivals, including Woodstock. With brother Edgar added as a full member of the group, Winter also recorded his second album, &quot;Second Winter&quot;, in Nashville in 1969. The two-disc album only had three recorded sides (the fourth was blank). It introduced more staples of Winter&#x27;s concerts, including Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;. Johnny entered into a short-lived affair with Janis Joplin, which culminated at a concert at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, where Johnny joined her on stage to sing and perform.

=== Unofficial albums ===
Contrary to urban legend, Johnny Winter did not perform with Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison on the infamous 1968 Hendrix bootleg album &quot;Woke up this Morning and Found Myself Dead&quot; from New York City&#x27;s the Scene club. According to Winter, &quot;I never even met Jim Morrison! There&#x27;s a whole album of Jimi and Jim and I&#x27;m supposedly on the album but I don&#x27;t think I am &#x27;cause I never met Jim Morrison in my life! I&#x27;m sure I never, never played with Jim Morrison at all! I don&#x27;t know how that [rumor] got started.&quot;

Beginning in 1969, the first of numerous Johnny Winter albums was released which were cobbled together from approximately fifteen singles (about 30 &quot;sides&quot;) he recorded before signing with Columbia in 1969. Many were produced by Roy Ames, owner of Home Cooking Records/Clarity Music Publishing, who had briefly managed Winter. According to an article from the &quot;Houston Press&quot;, Winter left town for the express purpose of getting away from him. Ames died on August 14, 2003, of natural causes at age 66. As Ames left no obvious heirs, the ownership rights of the Ames master recordings remain unclear. As Winter stated in an interview when the subject of Roy Ames came up, &quot;This guy has screwed so many people it makes me mad to even talk about him.&quot;

=== Johnny Winter And ===

In 1970, when his brother Edgar released a solo album &quot;Entrance&quot; and formed Edgar Winter&#x27;s White Trash, an R&amp;B/jazz-rock group, the original trio disbanded. Johnny Winter then formed a new band with the remnants of the McCoys—guitarist Rick Derringer, bassist Randy Jo Hobbs, and drummer Randy Z (who was Derringer&#x27;s brother, their family name being Zehringer). Originally to be called &quot;Johnny Winter and the McCoys&quot;, the name was shortened to &quot;Johnny Winter And&quot;, which was also the name of their first album. The album included Derringer&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo&quot; and signaled a more rock-oriented direction for Winter. When Johnny Winter And began to tour, Randy Z was replaced with drummer Bobby Caldwell. Their mixture of the new rock songs with Winter&#x27;s blues songs was captured on the live album &quot;Live Johnny Winter And&quot;. It included a new performance of &quot;It&#x27;s My Own Fault&quot;, the song which brought Winter to the attention of Columbia Records.

Winter&#x27;s momentum was throttled when he sank into heroin addiction during the Johnny Winter And days. After he sought treatment for and recovered from the addiction, Winter was put in front of the music press by manager Steve Paul to discuss the addiction candidly. By 1973, he returned to the music scene with the release of &quot;Still Alive and Well&quot;, a basic blend of blues and hard rock, whose title track was written by Rick Derringer. His comeback concert at Long Island, New York&#x27;s Nassau Coliseum featured the &quot;And&quot; line-up minus Rick Derringer and Bobby Caldwell. Also performing on stage was Johnny&#x27;s wife Susie. &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot; and &quot;John Dawson Winter III&quot;, two albums released in 1974, continue in the same direction. In 1975, Johnny returned to Bogalusa, Louisiana, to produce an album for Thunderhead, a Southern rock band which included Pat Rush and Bobby &quot;T&quot; Torello, who would later play with Winter. A second live Winter album, &quot;Captured Live!&quot;, was released in 1976 and features an extended performance of &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;.

=== Muddy Waters sessions ===
In live performances, Winter often told the story about how, as a child, he dreamed of playing with the blues guitarist Muddy Waters. He got his chance in 1974, when blues artists came together to honor Waters, the musician responsible for bringing blues to Chicago; the resulting concert presented many blues classics and was the start of a TV series, &quot;Soundstage&quot; (this particular session was called &quot;Blues Summit in Chicago&quot;). And in 1977, after Waters&#x27; long-time label Chess Records went out of business, Winter brought Waters into the studio to record &quot;Hard Again&quot; for Blue Sky Records, a label set up by Winter&#x27;s manager and distributed by Columbia. In addition to producing the album, Winter played guitar with Waters veteran James Cotton on harmonica. Winter produced two more studio albums for Waters, &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot; (with Big Walter Horton on harmonica) and &quot;King Bee&quot; and a best-selling live album &quot;Muddy &quot;Mississippi&quot; Waters – Live&quot;. The partnership produced three Grammy Awards for Waters and an additional Grammy for Winter&#x27;s own &quot;Nothin&#x27; But the Blues&quot;, with backing by members of Waters&#x27; band. Waters told &quot;Deep Blues&quot; author Robert Palmer that Winter had done remarkable work in reproducing the sound and atmosphere of Waters&#x27;s vintage Chess Records recordings of the 1950s. AllMusic writer Mark Deming noted: &quot;Between &quot;Hard Again&quot; and &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; [1976 concert film by The Band], Waters enjoyed a major career boost, and he found himself touring again for large and enthusiastic crowds&quot;.

== Lawsuit against DC Comics ==
In 1996, Winter and his brother Edgar filed suit against DC Comics and the creators of the &quot;Jonah Hex: Riders of the Worm and Such&quot; limited series, claiming, among other things, defamation: two characters named Johnny and Edgar Autumn in the series strongly resemble the Winters. The brothers claimed the comics falsely portrayed them as &quot;vile, depraved, stupid, cowardly, subhuman individuals who engage in wanton acts of violence, murder and bestiality for pleasure and who should be killed.&quot; The California Supreme Court sided with DC Comics, holding that the comic books were deserving of First Amendment protection.

==Later career==
After his time with Blue Sky Records, Winter began recording for several labels, including Alligator, Point Blank, and Virgin, where he focused on blues-oriented material. In 2004, he received a Grammy Award nomination for his &quot;I&#x27;m a Bluesman&quot; album. Beginning in 2007, a series of live Winter albums titled the &quot;Live Bootleg Series&quot; and a live DVD all entered the Top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; Blues chart. In 2009, &quot;The Woodstock Experience&quot; album was released, which includes eight songs that Winter performed at the 1969 festival. In 2011, Johnny Winter released &quot;Roots&quot; on Megaforce Records. It includes Winter&#x27;s interpretation of eleven early blues and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll classics and features several guest artists (Vince Gill, Sonny Landreth, Susan Tedeschi, Edgar Winter, Warren Haynes, and Derek Trucks). His last studio album, &quot;Step Back&quot; (which features appearances by Joe Bonamassa, Eric Clapton, Billy Gibbons, Leslie West, Brian Setzer, Dr. John, Paul Nelson, Ben Harper and Joe Perry), was released on September 2, 2014. Nelson and Winter won a Grammy Award in the Best Blues Album category for &quot;Step Back&quot; in 2015. Nelson said Winter knew it was an award winner and Winter told him &quot;If we don&#x27;t win a Grammy for this, they&#x27;re nuts.&quot;

Winter continued to perform live, including at festivals throughout North America and Europe. He headlined such prestigious events as the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, Chicago Blues Festival, the 2009 Sweden Rock Festival, the Warren Haynes Christmas Jam, and Rockpalast. He also performed with the Allman Brothers at the Beacon Theatre in New York City on the 40th anniversary of their debut. In 2007 and 2010, Winter performed at Eric Clapton&#x27;s Crossroads Guitar Festivals. Two guitar instructional DVDs were produced by Cherry Lane Music and the Hal Leonard Corporation. The Gibson Guitar Company released the signature Johnny Winter Firebird guitar in a ceremony in Nashville with Slash presenting.

=== Teddy Slatus management ===
During the time Teddy Slatus was employed as Winter&#x27;s manager (1984 to 2005) it has been alleged Slatus abused his power and continued to give Winter methadone to stop him from asking about getting paid. Johnny could barely talk or play anymore until Paul Nelson took over Johnny&#x27;s management in 2005, slowly easing him off drugs, alcohol, and smoking.

== Personal life and death ==
In 1993 Winter married Susan Warford, who died in 2019.

Winter was professionally active until the time of his death near Zürich, Switzerland, on July 16, 2014. He was found dead in his hotel room two days after his last performance, at the Cahors Blues Festival in France. The cause of Winter&#x27;s death was not officially released. According to his guitarist friend and record producer Paul Nelson, Winter died of emphysema combined with pneumonia.

Writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, after Winter&#x27;s death, David Marchese said, &quot;Winter was one of the first blues rock guitar virtuosos, releasing a string of popular and fiery albums in the late Sixties and early Seventies, becoming an arena-level concert draw in the process&quot; ... [he] &quot;made an iconic life for himself by playing the blues&quot;.

Winter is buried at Union Cemetery (Easton, Connecticut).

===Recognition and legacy===
Winter produced three Grammy Award-winning albums by Muddy Waters – &quot;Hard Again&quot; (1977), &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot; (1978), and &quot;Muddy &quot;Mississippi&quot; Waters – Live&quot; (1979). Several of Winter&#x27;s own albums were nominated for Grammy Awards – &quot;Guitar Slinger&quot; (1984) and &quot;Serious Business&quot; (1985) for Best Traditional Blues Album, and &quot;Let Me In&quot; (1991) and &quot;I&#x27;m a Bluesman&quot; (2004) for Best Contemporary Blues Album. In 2015 Winter posthumously won the Grammy Award for Best Blues Album for &quot;Step Back&quot;. The album also won the 2015 Blues Music Award for Best Rock Blues Album. At the 18th Maple Blues Awards in 2015, Winter was also posthumously awarded the B.B. King International Artist of The Year Award.

In 1980, Winter was on the cover of the first issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot;. In 1988, he was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, the first non-African-American performer to be inducted into the Hall.

Multiple guitarists have cited Winter as an influence, including Joe Perry, Frank Marino, Michael Schenker, Adrian Smith, Alex Skolnick and Billy Corgan, whose band The Smashing Pumpkins released a song titled &quot;Tribute to Johnny&quot;.

In her audiobook &quot;May You Live in Interesting Times: A Memoir&quot; (2021), comedian and founding &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member Laraine Newman recounts losing her virginity to Johnny Winter at the age of 17 in the late 1960s.

In 2008 Johnny Winter appeared (alongside brother Edgar) in the documentary film &quot;American Music: Off the Record&quot; directed by Benjamin Meade.

==Guitars and picking style==
Winter played a variety of guitars during his career, but he is probably best known for his use of Gibson Firebirds. He owned several, but favored a 1963 Firebird V model. Winter explained:

The original Firebird was a departure from Gibson&#x27;s traditional configuration, with Firebird &quot;sidewinder&quot; pickups in place of the company&#x27;s standard sized PAF humbucker or P-90 single-coil pickup models. Later Firebirds used a different (non-sidewinder) design, which may account for Winter&#x27;s preference for the 1963. Firebird pickups were still different than Gibson&#x27;s Mini-Humbuckers, but the terminology is often incorrectly mixed. Firebird pickups, by nature of their design, are brighter than Mini-Humbuckers. In a 2014 interview, Winter described the tone:

In 2008, the Gibson Custom Shop issued a signature Johnny Winter Firebird V in a ceremony in Nashville with Slash presenting.

In 1984, luthier Mark Erlewine approached Winter with his Lazer electric guitar. With its unusual design (for the time) without a headstock and having a small body, Winter responded immediately: &quot;the first day I plugged it in, it sounded so good that I wanted to use it for a gig that night.&quot; He commented:

Other guitars that Winter owned and played include a Gibson ES-125 (his first electric guitar), a Fender Stratocaster, a Gibson Les Paul/SG Custom, a Fender Mustang, a Gibson Les Paul Goldtop with P-90 pickups, a Gibson Flying V, an Epiphone Wilshire, a Gibson Black Beauty, a Fender Electric XII (strung with only 6 strings), and an acoustic National Resonator.

Winter played with a thumb pick and his fingers. His picking style was inspired by Chet Atkins and Merle Travis and he never used a flat pick. Winter preferred a plastic thumb pick sold by Gibson and a steel pinky slide, later marketed by Dunlop.

<text>The Passover massacre was a suicide bombing carried out by Hamas at the Park Hotel in Netanya, Israel on 27 March 2002, during a Passover seder. 30 civilians were killed in the attack and 140 were injured. It was the deadliest attack against Israeli civilians during the Second Intifada, and one of the most severe suicide attacks Israel has ever experienced.

==The attack==
On the evening of March 27, 2002, the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover and during the traditional seder meal, a Palestinian bomber named (also known as Abd Al-Baset Odeh) approached the Park Hotel in the Israeli coastal city of Netanya. Disguised as a woman, he had shaved his mustache and beard and used a wig and makeup. Carrying a suitcase with a ten-kilogram bomb, Odeh entered the hotel&#x27;s dining room, where approximately 250 civilians were celebrating the seder.

At 19:30 (GMT+2) the suicide bomber detonated the explosive device he was carrying. The force of the explosion instantly killed 28 civilians and injured about 140 people, of whom 20 were injured severely. Two of the injured later died from their wounds. Some of the victims were Holocaust survivors.

Most of the victims were senior citizens (70 and over). The oldest victim was 90 and the youngest was 20 years old. A number of married couples were killed, as well as a father together with his daughter. One of the victims was a Jewish tourist from Sweden who was visiting Israel for Passover.

Seventy-three of the 140 injured in the attack were evacuated to Laniado Hospital in neighboring Kiryat Sanz, Netanya. Although established as a regional hospital, Laniado had established a trauma center and emergency protocol in the wake of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in the Netanya area during the Second Intifada. In addition to medical teams, the hospital benefited from the volunteerism of Hasidim living in Kiryat Sanz, who donated blood, carried stretchers, and otherwise assisted the medical staff.

According to the indictment filed in the Tel Aviv court, the initial plot for the Passover massacre included the use of cyanide; 4 kg of cyanide had been bought and prepared for a chemical attack. Tarak Zidan had been recruited to Hamas, and during 1997 he researched the use of chlorine and other nerve agents to be used in terror attacks. In 2002, 4 kg of chlorine had been bought and packed for the attack. For unknown reasons it was not used and passed to instead.

== Hamas response ==
Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomber was identified as (Abd Al-Baset Odeh), a 25-year-old from the nearby West Bank city of Tulkarm. Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said that &quot;This is a trial (attempt) to send a letter, to send a message, to all the world that we are trying to fight for our own freedom against a terrorist government in Israel led by Sharon&quot; and that Israelis &quot;have to expect those attacks from everywhere, from every Palestinian group.&quot; Another Hamas spokesperson Abdel Aziz Rantisi said &quot;[a]s long as there is occupation, there will be a resistance&quot; and denied that the attack was timed to coincide with the peace initiative of the Saudi government at the Beirut Summit, an initiative rejected by Hamas.

==Official reactions==
Israeli government spokesman Gideon Meir related to the attack saying &quot;what we had tonight was a Passover massacre&quot; and added &quot;There is no limit to Palestinian barbarism.&quot; Palestinian Authority officials &quot;strongly condemned&quot; the attack. Palestinian President Yasser Arafat personally ordered the arrests of militants associated with Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades as a response. During a television broadcast on the Palestinian TV channel, Arafat praised the Palestinian people for the current popular uprising against Israel, but stressed that &quot;We are against killing civilians on both sides&quot;.

Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah condemned it, while also commenting that &quot;I will add to this by saying to the Israeli people that if their government stopped its methods of violence and destruction, and agreed to real peace, we will not hesitate in accepting that Israel live in peace with the rest of the nations in the region.&quot; Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary General stated that he condemned suicide bombings against Israeli civilians as morally repugnant. President of the United States George W. Bush condemned the attack and called on Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to do everything in their power to stop the terrorist killing.

US Secretary of State Colin Powell stated that the bombing set the peace process back but vowed to continue.

==Aftermath==
===Diplomacy===
In his response to the Arab Peace Initiative adopted at the Arab League&#x27;s summit in Beirut, Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel Shimon Peres noted that &quot;... the details of every peace plan must be discussed directly between Israel and the Palestinians, and to make this possible, the Palestinian Authority must put an end to terror, the horrifying expression of which we witnessed just last night in Netanya.&quot;

===Israeli retaliation===

The attack was perceived in Israel as the high point of a bloody month in which more than 135 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed in terror attacks.

Following the Passover massacre attack the Israeli government declared a state of emergency, ordered the immediate recruitment of 20,000 reservists in an emergency call-up, and in the following day launched the large-scale counter-terrorism operation Operation Defensive Shield in the West Bank which took place between 29 March and 10 May.

Qeis Adwan, head of the suicide bombing network responsible for the massacre, was killed by IDF forces on 5 April 2002 during Operation Defensive Shield, after the IDF and the Yamam caught him in Tubas, some 70 kilometers north of Jerusalem. An armored IDF Caterpillar D9 bulldozer toppled the house where he was hiding, after he was given a chance to surrender and refused.

===Arrests and killings of perpetrators===
One of the two chief planners of the attack, Qais Adwan, a Hamas member who was involved in numerous attacks in which a total of 77 people were killed, was killed in a shootout with the IDF during Operation Defensive Shield. In May 2002, Israeli forces arrested the other chief planner, . On 22 September 2005, al-Sayed was convicted of the Passover attack and also of ordering the May 2001 bombing of a Netanya mall. He received 35 life sentences for each murder victim and additional time for those who were wounded.

Fathi Khatib, who transported the bomber to his target, Mohand Sharim, who financed the operation and helped hide the bomber, Muammar Abu Sheikh, who recruited the bomber to Hamas and transferred the explosive belts used in the attack to an explosives expert for examination, and Nasser Yatiya, who helped transport the explosive belts, were tried and convicted together in an Israeli military court in April 2003 and handed 29 life sentences. Nasser Yatiya was released in the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange in 2011. Muhammad Taher, who prepared the explosive charges, was killed in a clash with Israeli Shayetet 13 naval commandos in June 2003.

On 26 March 2008 Hamas commander Omar Jabar, suspected of helping organize the attack, was arrested in Tulkarem by IDF troops of the Nahshon Battalion. In March 2013 he was convicted over his role and sentenced to 30 years in prison.

In September 2009, Muhammad Harwish, a senior Hamas militant and a planner of the Passover Massacre, was arrested by the Border Police&#x27;s elite Yamam counter-terror squad in his home village along with an aide, Adnan Samara.

=== Soccer tournament ===
In 2003, the Palestinian Authority sponsored a soccer tournament, &quot;Tulkarm Shahids Memorial Soccer Championship Tournament of the Shahid &quot;, describing the perpetrator as a &quot;shahid&quot; (&quot;martyr&quot;). 71% of Palestinians polled about the tournament approved of naming it in honor of the bomber.

<text>The genus Centris contains circa 250 species of large apid bees occurring in the Neotropical and Nearctic realms, from Kansas to Argentina. Most females of these bees possess adaptations for carrying floral oils rather than (or in addition to) pollen or nectar. They mainly visit plants of the family Malpighiaceae to collect oil, but also visit others such as Plantaginaceae, Calceolariaceae, and Krameriaceae. Recent studies have shown they are sister to the corbiculate bees, the most well-known and economically important group of bees 

They are large (up to 3 cm), fast-flying bees, distinguished from the closely related genus &quot;Epicharis&quot; by the absence of long, whip-like setae that project backwards from just behind the eyes. They are commonly encountered bees in American deserts, and are active at very high ambient temperatures when many other species are in hiding. They can often be seen in large numbers on desert-willow (&quot;Chilopsis&quot;) and palo verde (&quot;Parkinsonia&quot;) blossoms. Bees of this genus are of some economical significance in pollinating crops such as Brazil Nut (&quot;Bertholletia excelsa&quot;) and Cashew (&quot;Anacardium occidentale&quot;, pollinated by &quot;C. tarsata&quot; among others).

The mating system of one species, &quot;C. pallida&quot;, has been particularly well-researched by the behavioral ecologist John Alcock; the entomologist Adolpho Ducke also studied this genus.

<doc id="316723" wikidata="Q166118" url="?curid=316723" title="Archive">
<text>An archive is an accumulation of historical records or materials, in any medium, or the physical facility in which they are located.

Archives contain primary source documents that have accumulated over the course of an individual or organization&#x27;s lifetime, and are kept to show the history and function of that person or organization. Professional archivists and historians generally understand archives to be records that have been naturally and necessarily generated as a product of regular legal, commercial, administrative, or social activities. They have been metaphorically defined as &quot;the secretions of an organism&quot;, and are distinguished from documents that have been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to posterity.

In general, archives consist of records that have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation on the grounds of their enduring cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. Archival records are normally unpublished and almost always unique, unlike books or magazines, of which many identical copies may exist. This means that archives are quite distinct from libraries with regard to their functions and organization, although archival collections can often be found within library buildings.

A person who works in archives is called an archivist. The study and practice of organizing, preserving, and providing access to information and materials in archives is called archival science. The physical place of storage can be referred to as an archive (more usual in the United Kingdom), an archives (more usual in the United States), or a repository.

The computing use of the term &quot;archive&quot; should not be confused with the record-keeping meaning of the term.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;archive&quot; is derived from the French &quot;archives&quot; (plural), and in turn from Latin &quot;archīum&quot; or &quot;archīvum&quot;, the romanized form of the Greek (&quot;arkheion&quot;). The Greek term originally referred to the home or dwelling of the Archon, a ruler or chief magistrate, in which important official state documents were filed and interpreted; from there its meaning broadened to encompass such concepts as &quot;town hall&quot; and &quot;public records&quot;. The root of the Greek word is (&quot;arkhē&quot;), meaning among other things &quot;magistracy, office, government&quot;, and derived from the verb (&quot;arkhō&quot;), meaning &quot;to begin, rule, govern&quot; (also the root of English words such as &quot;anarchy&quot; and &quot;monarchy&quot;).

The word &quot;archive&quot; was first attested in English in the early 17th century, and the word &quot;archivist&quot; in the mid-18th century, although in these periods both terms were usually used only in reference to foreign institutions and personnel. Not until the late 19th century did they begin to be used widely in domestic contexts.

The adjective formed from &quot;archive&quot; is &quot;archival&quot;.

==History==
The practice of keeping official documents is very old. Archaeologists have discovered archives of hundreds (and sometimes thousands) of clay tablets dating back to the third and second millennia BC in sites like Ebla, Mari, Amarna, Hattusas, Ugarit, and Pylos. These discoveries have been fundamental to learning about ancient alphabets, languages, literature, and politics.

Oral literature, such as Palestinian hikaye, can also have archival functions for communities.

Archives were well developed by the ancient Chinese, the ancient Greeks, and the ancient Romans (who called them &quot;Tabularia&quot;). The idea that a society would designate a place to preserve records is integral to the Justinian Code (which set Roman law).

England, after 1066, developed archives and archival access methods. The Swiss developed archival systems after 1450.

The first predecessors of archival science in the West are Jacob von Rammingen&#x27;s manuals of 1571. and Baldassarre Bonifacio&#x27;s &quot;De Archivis libris singularis&quot; of 1632.

Modern archival thinking has some roots dating back to the French Revolution. The French National Archives, which possess perhaps the largest archival collection in the world (with records going as far back as 625 A.D.), was created in 1790 during the Revolution from various government, religious, and private archives seized by the revolutionaries.

In 1883, French archivist Gabriel Richou published the first Western text on archival theory, entitled &quot;Traité théorique et pratique des archives publiques&quot; (&quot;Treaty of Theory and Practice of the Public Archives&quot;), in which he systematized the archival theory of the &quot;respect des fonds&quot;, first published by Natalis de Wailly in 1841.

==Users and institutions==

Historians, genealogists, lawyers, demographers, filmmakers, and others conduct research at archives. The research process at each archive is unique and depends upon the institution that houses the archive. While there are many kinds of archives, the most recent census of archivists in the United States identifies five major types: academic, business (for profit), government, non-profit, and others. There are also four main areas of inquiry involved with archives: material technologies, organizing principles, geographic locations, and tangled embodiments of humans and non-humans. These areas help to further categorize what kind of archive is being created.

===Academic===
Archives in colleges, universities, and other educational facilities are typically housed within a library, and duties may be carried out by an archivist. Academic archives exist to preserve institutional history and serve the academic community. An academic archive may contain materials such as the institution&#x27;s administrative records, personal and professional papers of former professors and presidents, memorabilia related to school organizations and activities, and items the academic library wishes to remain in a closed-stack setting, such as rare books or thesis copies. Access to the collections in these archives is usually by prior appointment only; some have posted hours for making inquiries. Users of academic archives can be undergraduates, graduate students, faculty and staff, scholarly researchers, and the general public. Many academic archives work closely with alumni relations departments or other campus institutions to help raise funds for their library or school. Qualifications for employment may vary. Entry-level positions usually require an undergraduate diploma, but typically archivists hold graduate degrees in history or library science (preferably certified by a body such as the American Library Association). Subject-area specialization becomes more common in higher-ranking positions.

===Business (for profit)===
Archives located in for-profit institutions are usually those owned by a private business. Examples of prominent business archives in the United States include Coca-Cola (which also owns the separate museum World of Coca-Cola), Procter and Gamble, Motorola Heritage Services and Archives, and Levi Strauss &amp; Co. These corporate archives maintain historic documents and items related to the history and administration of their companies. Business archives serve the purpose of helping corporations maintain control over their brand by retaining memories of the company&#x27;s past. Especially in business archives, records management is separate from the historical aspect of archives. Workers in these types of archives may have any combination of training and degrees, from either a history or library background. These archives are typically not open to the public and are only used by workers of the owner company, though some allow approved visitors by appointment. Business archives are concerned with maintaining the integrity of their company and are therefore selective about how their materials may be used.

===Government===
Government archives include those maintained by local and state governments as well as those maintained by the national (or federal) government. Anyone may use a government archive, and frequent users include reporters, genealogists, writers, historians, students, and people seeking information on the history of their home or region. Many government archives are open to the public, and no appointment is required to visit.

In the United States, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) maintains central archival facilities in the District of Columbia and College Park, Maryland, with regional facilities distributed throughout the United States. Some city or local governments may have repositories, but their organization and accessibility vary widely. Similar to the library profession, certification requirements and education also varies widely, from state to state. Professional associations themselves encourage the need to professionalize. NARA offers the Certificate of Federal Records Management Training Program for professional development. The majority of state and local archives staff hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree—increasingly repositories list advanced degrees (e.g. MA, MLS/MLIS, Ph.D.) and certifications as a position requirement or preference.

In the UK, the National Archives (formerly known as the Public Record Office) is the government archive for England and Wales. The physical records stored by the National Archives amount to of shelving, a number that increases every year. The English Heritage Archive is the public archive of English Heritage. The National Records of Scotland, located in Edinburgh, serves that country; while the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland in Belfast is the government archive for Northern Ireland.

A network of county record offices and other local authority-run archives exists throughout England, Wales, and Scotland and holds many important collections, including local government, landed estates, church, and business records. Many archives have contributed catalogs to the national &quot;Access to Archives&quot; program and online searching across collections is possible.

In France, the French Archives Administration (&quot;Service interministériel des Archives de France&quot;) in the Ministry of Culture supervises the National Archives (&quot;Archives nationales&quot;), which possess of physical records (the total length of occupied shelves put next to each other), with original records going as far back as A.D. 625, and 74.75 terabytes (74,750 GB) of electronic archives, as well as the National Overseas Archives (ANOM, of physical records), the (ANMT, of physical records), and all local public archives (departmental archives, or &quot;archives départementales&quot;, located in the &quot;préfectures&quot; of each of the 100 &quot;départements&quot; of France plus the City of Paris, more than 400 municipal archives in the larger towns and cities of France, and 12 newer regional archives) which possess of physical records and 225.25 terabytes of electronic archives (). Put together, the total volume of archives under the supervision of the French Archives Administration is the largest in the world.

The archives of the French Ministry of Armed Forces (Defence Historical Service, ca. of physical records) and the archives of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs (, ca. of physical records) are managed separately by their respective ministries and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Archives of France Administration.

In India, the National Archives (NAI) are located in New Delhi.

In Taiwan, the National Archives Administration are located in Taipei.

Most intergovernmental organizations keep their own historical archives. However, a number of European organizations, including the European Commission, choose to deposit their archives with the European University Institute in Florence.

===Church===
A prominent church archive is the Vatican Apostolic Archive.
Archdioceses, dioceses, and parishes also have archives in the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches. Very important are monastery archives because of their antiquity, like the ones of Monte Cassino, Saint Gall, and Fulda. The records in these archives include manuscripts, papal records, local church records, photographs, oral histories, audiovisual materials, and architectural drawings.

Most Protestant denominations have archives as well, including the Presbyterian Historical Society, the Moravian Church Archives, the Southern Baptist Historical Library and Archives, the United Methodist Archives and History Center of the United Methodist Church, and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).

===Motion pictures, film, and audio and video tape===

Film archives collect, restore, investigate and conserve audiovisual content like films, documentaries, tv programs and newsreel footage. Often, a country has its own film archive to preserve its national audiovisual heritage. The International Federation of Film Archives comprises more than 150 institutions in over 77 countries and the Association of European Film Archives and Cinematheques is an affiliation of 49 European national and regional film archives founded in 1991. For a comprehensive look at the history of film preservation and the institutions and organizations that developed various practices, see Penelope Houston&#x27;s &quot;Keepers of the Frame.&quot;

===Non-profit===
Non-profit archives include those in historical societies, not-for-profit businesses such as hospitals, and repositories within foundations. Such repositories are typically set up with private funds from donors to preserve the papers and histories of specific people or places. These institutions may rely on grant funding from the government as well as private funds. Depending on the availability of funds, non-profit archives may be as small as the historical society in a rural town to as big as a state historical society that rivals a government archive. Users of this type of archive may vary as much as the institutions that hold it. Employees of non-profit archives may be professional archivists, paraprofessionals, or volunteers, as the education required for a position at a non-profit archive varies with the demands of the collection&#x27;s user base.

===Web archiving===

Web archiving is the process of collecting portions of the World Wide Web and ensuring the collection is preserved in an archive, such as an archive site, for future researchers, historians, and the public. Due to the massive size of the Web, web archivists typically employ web crawlers for automated collection.

Similarly, software code and documentation can be archived on the web, as with the example of CPAN.

===Other===

Some archives defy categorization. There are tribal archives within the Native American nations in North America, and there are archives that exist within the papers of private individuals. Many museums keep archives in order to prove the provenance of their pieces. Any institution or persons wishing to keep their significant papers in an organized fashion that employs the most basic principles of archival science may have an archive. In the 2004 census of archivists taken in the United States, 2.7% of archivists were employed in institutions that defied categorization. This was a separate figure from the 1.3% that identified themselves as self-employed.

Another type of archive is the Public Secrets project. This is an interactive testimonial, in which women incarcerated in the California State Prison System describe what happened to them. The archive&#x27;s mission is to gather stories from women who want to express themselves and want their stories heard. This collection includes transcripts and an audio recording of the women telling their stories.

The archives of an individual may include letters, papers, photographs, computer files, scrapbooks, financial records, or diaries created or collected by the individual, regardless of medium or format. The archives of an organization (such as a corporation or government) tend to contain other types of records, such as administrative files, business records, memos, official correspondence, and meeting minutes. Some archives are made up of a compilation of both types of collections. An example of this type of combined compilation is the Transgender Archives at the University of Victoria, which contain a multitude of collections of donations from both individuals and organizations from all over the world. Many of these donations have yet to be cataloged but are currently in the process of being digitally preserved and made available to the public online.

The Arctic World Archive is a commercially-run facility for data preservation located in the Svalbard archipelago, Norway, that contains data of historical and cultural interest from several countries as well as all of American multinational company GitHub&#x27;s open source code. The data is kept on reels of specially developed film in a steel vault buried deep beneath the permafrost, with the data storage medium expected to last for 500 to 1000 years.

==Standardization==
The International Council on Archives (ICA) has developed a number of standards on archival description, including the General International Standard Archival Description ISAD(G). ISAD (G) is meant to be used in conjunction with national standards or as a basis for nations to build their own standards. In the United States, ISAD (G) is implemented through Describing Archives: A Content Standard, popularly known as &quot;DACS&quot;. In Canada, ISAD (G) is implemented through the Council of Archives as the Rules for Archival Description, also known as &quot;RAD&quot;.

ISO is currently developing standards.

==Protection==
The cultural property stored in archives is threatened by natural disasters, wars, or other emergencies in many countries. International partners for archives are UNESCO and Blue Shield International, in accordance with the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property from 1954 and its 2nd Protocol from 1999. From a national and international perspective, there are many collaborations between archives and local Blue Shield organizations to ensure the sustainable existence of cultural property storage facilities. In addition to working with United Nations peacekeeping in the event of war, the protection of the archives requires the creation of &quot;no-strike lists&quot;, the linking of civil and military structures, and the training of local personnel.

== Limitations and alternatives ==

Archives that primarily contain physical artifacts and printed documents are increasingly shifting to digitizing items that did not originate digitally, which are then usually stored away. This allows for greater accessibility when using search tools and databases, as well as an increase in the availability of digitized materials from outside the physical parameters of an archive, but there may be an element of loss or disconnect when there are gaps in what items are made available digitally. Both physical and digital archives also generally have specific limitations regarding the types of content that are deemed able to be preserved, categorized, and archived. Conventional institutionalized archive spaces have a tendency to prioritize tangible items over ephemeral experiences, actions, effects, and even bodies. This type of potentially biased prioritization may be seen as a form of privileging particular types of knowledge or interpreting certain experiences as more valid than others, limiting the content available to archive users, leading to barriers in accessing information, and potentially alienating under-represented and/or marginalized populations and their epistemologies and ontologies. As Omnia El Shakry shows, dealing with destruction is a challenge central to decolonial historiography. When faced with a lack of archival documents, historians resort to different sources and methods. For example, due to the lack of a Palestinian state archive, many historians of Nakba had to rely on sources in the Israeli state&#x27;s archives.

As a result of this perceived under-representation, some activists are making efforts to decolonize contemporary archival institutions that may employ hegemonic and white supremacist practices by implementing subversive alternatives such as anarchiving or counter-archiving with the intention of making intersectional accessibility a priority for those who cannot or do not want to access contemporary archival institutions. An example of this is Morgan M. Page&#x27;s description of disseminating transgender history directly to trans people through various social media and networking platforms like tumblr, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as via podcast. While the majority of archived materials are typically well conserved within their collections, anarchiving&#x27;s attention to ephemerality also brings to light the inherent impermanence and gradual change of physical objects over time as a result of being handled.

The concept of counter-archiving brings into question what tends to be considered archivable and what is therefore selected to be preserved within conventional contemporary archives. With the options available through counter-archiving, there is the potential to &quot;challenge traditional conceptions of history&quot; as they are perceived within contemporary archives, which creates space for narratives that are often not present in many archival materials. The unconventional nature of counter-archiving practices makes room for the maintenance of ephemeral qualities contained within certain historically significant experiences, performances, and personally or culturally relevant stories that do not typically have a space in conventional archives.

The practices of anarchiving and counter-archiving are both rooted in social justice work.

<text>The Macintosh Quadra is a family of personal computers designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from October 1991 to October 1995. The Quadra, named for the Motorola 68040 central processing unit, replaced the Macintosh II family as the high-end Macintosh model.

The first models were the Quadra 700 and Quadra 900, both introduced in October 1991, with the latter discontinued after six months and replaced by the Quadra 950. The Quadra 800 was added in February 1993 (succeeding the Quadra 700), followed the multimedia-focused 840AV at the end of July 1993. The Macintosh Centris line was merged with the Quadra in October 1993, adding the 610, 650 and 660AV to the range. The 605 (also sold as the Performa 475 or LC 475) was also introduced in October 1993, featuring the 68LC040 (lacking an FPU) as standard although it could be upgraded to the full 68040. After the introduction of the Power Macintosh line in early 1994, the Quadra 630 (using the &quot;full&quot; Motorola 68040 instead of the LC&#x27;s 68LC040) became the last new Quadra member. The Quadra 950 continued to be sold until October 1995.

The product manager for the Quadra family was Frank Casanova who was also the Product Manager for the Macintosh IIfx.

==Models==


The first computers bearing the Macintosh Quadra name were the Quadra 700 and Quadra 900, both introduced in 1991 with a central processing unit (CPU) speed of 25 MHz. The 700 featured identical case dimensions as the Macintosh IIci but vertically oriented as a mini-tower, with a Processor Direct Slot (PDS) expansion slot, while the latter was a newly designed full-tower case with five NuBus expansion slots and one PDS slot. The 900 was replaced in 1992 with the very similar Quadra 950, with a faster CPU speed of 33 MHz and improved graphics support. 

The Quadra 800 was added in February 1993. It was positioned below the flagship Quadra 950 and succeeded the Quadra 700 (which was discontinued shortly after the Quadra 800&#x27;s announcement). Debuting at half the price of the Quadra 950, the Quadra 800 featured the same Motorola 68040 33 MHz processor as the 950 but its additional interleaved RAM running at 70 ns, as well as an enhanced video system and SCSI bus, enabled it to outperform the 950. The Quadra 800&#x27;s mid-tower case had four drive bays, giving it more expansion options than the Quadra 700&#x27;s mini-tower, while having a form factor still considerably shorter than the Quadra 900/950&#x27;s full tower. 

In July 1993, the Quadra 840AV and 660AV (originally branded as Centris 660AV) were introduced at 40 MHz and 25 MHz respectively. They included an AT&amp;T 3210 Digital signal processor and S-Video and composite video input/output ports, as well as CD-quality microphone and audio output ports. The AV models also introduced PlainTalk, consisting of the text-to-speech software MacinTalk Pro and speech control (although not dictation). However, all of these features were poorly supported in software and a DSP was not installed in later AV Macs, which were based on the more powerful PowerPC 601 - a CPU powerful enough to handle the coprocessor&#x27;s duties on its own.

The Quadra name was also used for the successors to the Centris models that briefly existed during 1993: the 610, the 650 and the 660AV. Centris was a &quot;mid-range&quot; line of systems (featuring slower 68040 CPUs, often the 68LC040 which omits the FPU), between the existing Quadra on the high end (featuring the faster 68040 CPU) and the LC on the low end (built around the 68030 CPU), but it was later decided that there were too many product lines and so Centris was dropped in October 1993. 

The 605 (also sold as the Performa 475 or LC 475) was also introduced in October 1993, featuring the 68LC040 as standard although it could be upgraded to the full 68040. At that point, the Quadra lineup consisted of the 950 using a full tower case, the &quot;800-series&quot; machines with a Mid-tower case design (Quadra 800 and 840AV), and the &quot;600-series&quot; (the Quadra 605, Quadra 610 and 660AV had pizza box desktop cases, while the Quadra 650 had a taller desktop case). 

After the Power Macintosh line was launched in early 1994, only one more member of the Quadra family was released which was in July 1994, the Quadra 630, which was a variation of the LC 630 using a &quot;full&quot; Motorola 68040 instead of the LC&#x27;s 68LC040, and introduced together with it in 1994. The 630 was the first Mac to use an IDE based drive bus for the internal hard disk drive, whereas all earlier models had used SCSI. All of the other Quadra models introduced in 1993 would be discontinued in 1994 after being available for sale for a year, to be replaced by Power Macintosh models, except for the Quadra 950 which continued to be sold until October 1995. 

==Branding==
Apple hired marketing firm Lexicon Branding to come up with the name. Lexicon chose the name Quadra hoping to appeal to engineers by evoking technical terms like quadrant and quadriceps.

The first three Apple Workgroup Server models, the WGS 60, the WGS 80 and the WGS 95 (mostly called &quot;AWS 95&quot; for &quot;Apple Workgroup Server&quot;) were based on the Quadra 610 (originally Centris 610), the Quadra 800 and the Quadra 950, respectively.

In October 1993, to keep pace with the growing number of relatively affordable IBM compatibles powered by the Intel 80486, Apple introduced or rebranded numerous &quot;entry-level&quot; Quadra models (particularly the 605, 610, and later 630) for home or education use with their 68LC040 CPU, in comparison to the original models (700, 800/840AV, 900/950) which were positioned as high-end workstations due to their 68040 CPU and higher RAM ceilings. These low-end models arguably devaluated the Quadra branding, as the &quot;600-series&quot; also featured the higher-end models 650 and 660AV that more faithful to the original Quadra family (despite being rebranded from Centris). Furthermore the 605 and 630 were sold under the LC and Performa labels which created further confusion among consumers, whereas the more expensive Quadra models did not have an alternative branding. Ultimately, the Quadra family&#x27;s demise was hastened as models were succeeded by the Power Macintosh, the latter family aiming to compete with IBM compatibles powered by the Pentium (P5).

==Processor==
The transition to the Motorola 68040 was not as smooth as the previous transitions to the Motorola 68020 or Motorola 68030. Due to the Motorola 68040&#x27;s split instruction and data caches, the Quadra had compatibility problems with self-modifying code (including relocating code, which was common under the Macintosh memory model). Apple partially fixed this by having the basic Mac OS memory copy call flush the caches. This solved the vast majority of stability problems, but negated much of the Motorola 68040&#x27;s performance improvements. Apple also introduced a variant of the memory copy call that did not flush the cache. The new trap was defined in such a way that calling it on an older version of Mac OS would simply call the previous memory copy routine. The net effect of this was that many complex applications were initially slow or prone to crashing on the 68040, although developers quickly adapted to the new architecture by relying on Apple&#x27;s memory copy routines rather than their own (or flushing the cache) and using the memory copy that did not flush the cache when appropriate (most of the time).

<text>Anand Milk Union Limited commonly known as Amul is an Indian dairy brand owned by the cooperative society, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), based in Anand, Gujarat. GCMMF is controlled by 3.6 million milk producers.

Tribhuvandas Kishibhai Patel founded the organisation in 1946 and served as its chairman until his retirement in the 1970s. He hired Verghese Kurien in 1949, initially as the general manager, where Kurien guided the technical and marketing efforts of the cooperative. Kurien briefly became the chairman of Amul following Patel&#x27;s death in 1994, and is credited with the success of Amul&#x27;s marketing.

Amul spurred India&#x27;s White Revolution, which made the country the world&#x27;s largest producer of milk and milk products, and has since ventured into overseas markets.

==History==
Amul was founded on 14 December 1946 as a response to the exploitation of small dairy farmers by traders and agents. At the time, milk prices were arbitrarily determined, giving Polson an effective monopoly in milk collection from Kaira and its subsequent supply to Mumbai.

Frustrated with the trade practices (which they perceived as unfair), the farmers of Kaira, led by Tribhuvandas Patel, approached Vallabhbhai Patel, who advised them to form a cooperative. If they did so, they would be able to directly supply their milk to the Bombay Milk Scheme instead of working for Polson. Sardar Patel sent Morarji Desai to organise the farmers.

Following a meeting in Chaklasi, the farmers formed the cooperative and resolved not to provide Polson with any more milk. Milk collection was decentralised, as most producers were marginal farmers who could deliver, at most, 1–2 litres of milk per day. Cooperatives were formed for each village. By June 1948, the KDCMPUL had started pasteurising milk for the Bombay Milk Scheme. Then-Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri visited Anand to inaugurate Amul&#x27;s cattle feed factory. On 31 October 1964, he spoke to farmers about their cooperative. After returning to Delhi, he set in motion the creation of an organisation, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), to replicate the Kaira cooperative in other parts of India. Under the leadership of Tribhuvandas Patel, in 1973, Amul celebrated its 25th anniversary with Morarji Desai, Maniben Patel, and Verghese Kurien.

The cooperative was further developed through the efforts of Verghese Kurien and H. M. Dalaya. Dalaya&#x27;s innovation of making skim milk powder from buffalo milk was a technological breakthrough that revolutionised India&#x27;s organised dairy industry.

With Kurien&#x27;s help, the process was expanded on a commercial scale, which led to the first modern dairy cooperative at Anand. This cooperative would go on to compete against the established players in the market.

The success of the trio (T. K. Patel, Kurien, and Dalaya) at the cooperative&#x27;s dairy soon spread to Anand&#x27;s neighbourhood in Gujarat. Within a short span, five unions in other districts—Mehsana, Banaskantha, Baroda, Sabarkantha, and Surat – were set up, following the approach sometimes described as &quot;the Anand pattern&quot;.

In 1970, the cooperative spearheaded the &quot;White Revolution&quot; of India. To combine forces and expand the market while saving on advertising and avoiding competing against each other, the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd., an apex marketing body of these district cooperatives, was set up in 1973. The Kaira Union, which had the brand name Amul with it since 1955, transferred it to GCMMF. Technological developments at Amul have subsequently spread to other parts of India.

In 1999, it was awarded the &quot;Best of All&quot; Rajiv Gandhi National Quality Award.

==Promotion and advertisement==
In 1966, Amul hired Sylvester daCunha, the managing director of an advertising agency, to design an ad campaign for Amul Butter. DaCunha created an operation consisting of a series of hoardings featuring topical ads related to day-to-day issues. It was popular and earned a Guinness World Record for the longest-running ad campaign in the world. In the 1980s, cartoon artist Kumar Morey and scriptwriter Bharat Dabholkar were involved in sketching the Amul ads; the latter rejected the trend of using celebrities in advertisement campaigns. Dabholkar credited chairman Verghese Kurien with creating a free atmosphere that fostered the development of the ads.

Despite encountering political pressure on several occasions, daCunha&#x27;s agency has made it a policy not to back down. Some of the more controversial Amul ads include one commenting on the Naxalite uprising in West Bengal, one on the Indian Airlines employees&#x27; strike, and one depicting the Amul girl wearing a Gandhi cap.

In 2013, Amul tweeted a picture featuring the Amul Butter Girl, implying that &quot;freedom of choice&quot; died in 2013, in opposition to the Supreme Court of India overruling the judgment of the High Court of Delhi and criminalising homosexuality again.

On 17 October 2016, the Amul Butter Girl celebrated 50 years since she first appeared in the topical ad, titled &quot;Thoroughbred&quot;. The ad showed a jockey holding a slice of bread during the horse race season in 1966. The impish Amul girl had appeared for the first time even before that, with Eustace Fernandez showing her offering bedtime prayers with a wink and a lick of lips, saying &quot;Give us this day our daily bread: with Amul butter&quot;.

Their ad on &quot;Aagey Badhta Hai India&quot; had an excellent response from the audience. It spoke about how their milk is seen as a household product, with a catchy tune associated with it. It has over 39 lakh (3.9 million) views on YouTube.

In February 2020, Amul posted a picture of the Amul girl treating Joaquin Phoenix with butter after his academy award win for his role in the 2019 film, &quot;Joker&quot;. Since Phoenix is a vegan, Amul faced criticism from vegans in India and PETA for the poor knowledge of his vegan activism and life.

In July 2024, Amul featured Maya Neelakantan, a ten-year-old guitar prodigy who auditioned for &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; season 19 in June 2024.

==In popular culture==
The White Revolution inspired filmmaker Shyam Benegal to base his 1976 film &quot;Manthan&quot; on it. The film was financed by over five lakh (half a million) rural farmers in Gujarat, who contributed ₹2 each to its budget. Upon its release, these farmers went in truckloads to watch &#x27;their&#x27; film, making it a commercial success. &quot;Manthan&quot; won the National Film Award for Best Hindi Feature Film during the 24th National Film Awards in 1977.

<text>Nicodemus (; {{langx|grc|Νικόδημος|Nikódēmos}}; {{Langx|arc|𐡍𐡒𐡃𐡉𐡌𐡅𐡍|translit=Naqdīmūn}}; {{Langx|he|נַקְדִּימוֹן|translit=Naqdīmōn}}) is a New Testament figure venerated as a saint in a number of Christian traditions. He is depicted as a Pharisee and a member of the Sanhedrin who is drawn to hear Jesus&#x27;s teachings. As is the case with Lazarus, Nicodemus is not mentioned in the synoptic Gospels, and is mentioned only by John, who devotes more than half of Chapter 3 of his gospel and a few verses of Chapter 7 to Nicodemus, and lastly mentions him in Chapter 19.

Nicodemus is considered by both Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church traditions to have secretly been a disciple of Jesus on the basis of the narrative in John 19; there is no explicit mention of his discipleship in the Gospel of John. Owing to his insistence on a hearing for Jesus according to Jewish law, Nicodemus is sometimes referred to as &quot;defender of Jesus&quot;.

Some scholars have identified the Nicodemus of the New Testament with a 1st-century historic Nicodemus ben Gurion, while others consider the dates and the seeming age discrepancy between the two figures make this unlikely. An apocryphal work under his name{{snd}}the Gospel of Nicodemus{{snd}}was produced in the mid-4th century, and is mostly a reworking of the earlier Acts of Pilate, which recounts the Harrowing of Hell.

== Gospel narrative ==
Nicodemus is mentioned in three places in the Gospel of John:
* He first visits Jesus one night, in secret, to discuss Jesus&#x27;s teachings. (John 3){{efn|{{bibleref2|John|3:1–21}} }}
* The second time Nicodemus is mentioned, he reminds his colleagues in the Sanhedrin that the law requires that a person be heard before being judged. (John 7){{efn|{{bibleref2|John|7:50–51}} }}
* Finally, Nicodemus appears after Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion to provide the customary spices for anointing the dead, and assists Joseph of Arimathea in preparing the body of Jesus for burial. (John 19){{efn|{{bibleref2|John|19:39–42}}; Verse 40: &quot;They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths, according to the burial custom of the Jews.&quot;}}
The first time Nicodemus is mentioned, he is identified as a Pharisee who comes to see Jesus at night. According to the scripture, Jesus went to Jerusalem for the Passover feast. While in Jerusalem he chased the moneychangers from the temple and overturned their tables. His disciples remembered then the words of Psalm 69: &quot;Zeal for your house will consume me.&quot; After these events &quot;many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing&quot;.{{efn|{{bibleref2|John|2:23–25}} }} When Nicodemus visits Jesus he makes reference to these events: &quot;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him&quot;.{{efn|{{bibleref2|John|3:2}} }}

Jesus replies: &quot;Unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.&quot; Then follows a conversation with Nicodemus about the meaning of being &quot;born again&quot; or &quot;born from above&quot; ({{langx|el|ἄνωθεν}}): Nicodemus explores the notion of being literally born again from one&#x27;s mother&#x27;s womb, but most theologians recognise that Nicodemus knew Jesus was not speaking of literal rebirth. Theologian Charles Ellicott wrote that &quot;after the method of Rabbinic dialogue, [Nicodemus] presses the impossible meaning of the words in order to exclude it, and to draw forth the true meaning. &#x27;You cannot mean that a man is to enter the second time into his mother&#x27;s womb, and be born. What is it, then, that you do mean?{{&#x27;}}&quot; In this instance, Nicodemus chooses the literal (rather than the figurative) meaning of {{transl|grc|anōthen}} and assumes that that meaning exhausts the significance of the word.

Jesus expresses surprise, perhaps ironically, that &quot;a teacher of Israel&quot; does not understand the concept of spiritual rebirth:{{efn|{{bibleref2|John|3:10–11|ESV}} }}
{{bq|Jesus answered him, &quot;Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things? Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony.&quot;|John 3:10–11}}

In Chapter 7, Nicodemus advises his colleagues among &quot;the chief priests and the Pharisees&quot;, to hear and investigate before making a judgment concerning Jesus, reminding them that Jewish law requires that a person must be heard before they can be condemned. Their mocking response argues that no prophet comes from Galilee. Nonetheless, it is probable that he wielded a certain influence in the Sanhedrin.

Finally, when Jesus is buried, Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes—about 100 Roman pounds ({{convert|33|kg||disp=x|, or }}).{{efn|{{bibleref2|John|19:39}} }} Nicodemus must have been a man of means; in his book &quot;Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week&quot;, Pope Benedict XVI observes that, &quot;The quantity of the balm is extraordinary and exceeds all normal proportions. This is a royal burial.&quot;

==Historicity==
Although there is no clear source of information about Nicodemus outside the Gospel of John, Ochser and Kohler, writing in &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; in 1905, identify him with Nicodemus ben Gurion, mentioned in the Talmud as a wealthy and popular holy man reputed to have had miraculous powers. Some 20th- and 21st-century historians make the same connection. Other scholars reject this identification, arguing that the biblical Nicodemus is likely an older man at the time of his conversation with Jesus, while Nicodemus ben Gurion was on the scene forty years later, at the time of the First Jewish-Roman War.

== Veneration ==
Nicodemus is venerated as a saint in Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy and in Catholicism. The Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic Churches commemorate him on the Sunday of the Holy Myrrhbearers, which is celebrated on the Third Sunday of Pascha (i.e., the second Sunday after Easter). Sacred tradition holds that his relics were found on 2 August, along with those of Saint Stephen the Protomartyr; Gamaliel; and Gamaliel&#x27;s second son, Abibon (also, &quot;Abibas&quot;; &quot;Abibo&quot;). This event is commemorated on that date in the Eastern churches, while the Catholic General Roman Calendar marks the anniversary of the translation of Nicodemus&#x27; remains, rather than their discovery, which by the same tradition occurred the following day, 3 August. In the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot;, Nicodemus&#x27; feast day is 31 August, celebrated jointly with Saint Joseph of Arimathea, and generally followed in the Roman Rite tradition. 

This does not preclude local preferences and traditions from being applied, as dioceses, national churches and religious institutes may have their own days of observance approved. For example, at the St. Nicodemus and St. Joseph of Arimathea Church, which the Franciscan Order established in Ramla in the 19th century, permission from the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem was obtained to celebrate the feast day of the two saints on the Saturday of the third week of Easter, so that the link between their role in the burial of Jesus and Easter solemnities would be highlighted in the Holy Land. The church has a painting above its altar, attributed to Titian, &quot;The Deposition from the Cross&quot;, which shows the two saints.

===Days of observance===
* Eastern Christianity (including Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy and Eastern-rite Catholics):
** Discovery of the saint&#x27;s relics: 2 August
** As a Holy Myrrhbearer: Third Sunday of Pascha (Easter)
* Roman-rite Catholicism:
** Translation of the saint&#x27;s relics: 3 August
** Feast day: 31 August

== Legacy ==
=== Art ===
Nicodemus figures prominently in medieval depictions of the Deposition or Descent from the Cross in which he and Joseph of Arimathea are shown removing the dead Christ from the cross, often with the aid of a ladder.

Like Joseph, Nicodemus became the object of various pious legends during the Middle Ages, particularly in connection with monumental crosses. He was reputed to have carved both the Holy Face of Lucca and the Batlló Crucifix, receiving angelic assistance with the face in particular and thus rendering the works instances of {{transl|grc|acheiropoieta}}.

Both of these sculptures date from at least a millennium after Nicodemus&#x27;s life, but the ascriptions attest to the contemporary interest in Nicodemus as a character in medieval Europe.

=== Literature ===
In Henry Vaughan&#x27;s &quot;The Night&quot;, Nicodemus is significant to the 17th-century poem&#x27;s theme: He serves as the departure point and illustration of its meditation on night&#x27;s relationship with experience of God.

&quot;Persuaded: The Story of Nicodemus&quot; by David Harder is a fictionalized account of the life of Nicodemus. According to the author, he used episodes and timetables sourced from all four gospels and the Acts of the Apostles to develop his novel&#x27;s timeline of events. Scripture quoted within the novel is taken from the Passion Translation{{efn|Passion Translation}} version of the Bible. 

=== Music ===

In 18th-century Lutheranism, prescribed readings were assigned throughout the year; the gospel text of the meeting of Jesus and Nicodemus at night was assigned to Trinity Sunday. Johann Sebastian Bach composed several cantatas for the occasion, of which {{lang|de|&quot;O heilges Geist- und Wasserbad&quot;, BWV 165 |italic=unset}}, composed in 1715, stays close to the gospel based on a libretto by the court poet in Weimar, Salomo Franck.

In popular music, Nicodemus&#x27; name was used figuratively in Henry Clay Work&#x27;s 1864 American Civil War-era piece &quot;Wake Nicodemus&quot;, an abolitionist song hailing the end of slavery, which at that time was popular in minstrel shows. In 1978 Tim Curry covered the song on his debut album &quot;Read My Lips&quot;. The song&#x27;s layered connotations, its anti-slavery sentiment{{mdash}}gave it a connection with &quot;rebirths&quot;, and to John&#x27;s &quot;born again&quot; Nicodemus. By extension, it became associated with the civil rights movement in the {{slink|#United States}}.

Ernst Pepping composed an {{lang|de|Evangelienmotette}} (motet on gospel text) {{lang|de|Jesus und Nikodemus}} in 1937. In 1941, The Golden Gate Quartet, sang the Gospel &quot;God Told Nicodemus&quot;, in the African-American Jubilee style. The song &quot;Help Yourself&quot; by The Devil Makes Three, from their 2009 &quot;Do Wrong Right&quot; album, contains a very informal retelling of the relationship between Nicodemus and Jesus.

=== Film and television ===
Nicodemus is portrayed by Diego Matamoros in the 2003 film &quot;The Gospel of John&quot;.

The figure of Nicodemus appears in several television productions:
* In the 1952 series, &quot;The Living Bible&quot;, Forrest Taylor plays the character of Nicodemus
* In the 1965 film, &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;, Joseph Schildkraut plays the character of Nicodemus
* Sir Laurence Olivier portrayed Nicodemus in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1977 series, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;
* Erick Avari plays Nicodemus in the 2019 web series &quot;The Chosen&quot;

== Social influence ==
=== The Reformation and religious conflict ===
{{Main|Nicodemite}}{{Further|Reformation}}
During the struggle between Protestants and Catholics in Europe, from the 16th century to the 18th, a person professing a creed different from the locally approved one often risked severe penalties—in many cases, capital punishment. There developed the use of &quot;Nicodemite&quot;, usually a term of disparagement, referring to a person who is suspected of public misrepresentation of their actual religious beliefs.{{rp|117–118}}
The term is recorded from at least 1529, in relation to religious concealment or reticence. It is a reference to the clandestine night visit of Nicodemus to Jesus, suggesting an analogy between the undeclared belief of Nicodemus and the reluctance of some dissenters from (at first) Catholicism to risk being open about their true creed. To John Calvin, who opposed all veneration of saints, the fact of Nicodemus being a Catholic saint in no way exonerated this &quot;duplicity&quot;. Calvin used the word in his 1544 {{lang|fr|Excuse à messieurs les Nicodemites}} referring to religious dissemblers in France—outwardly, conforming Catholics; inwardly, adherents of Protestantism. He was apparently not completely comfortable with the term&#x27;s allusion to Nicodemus, however; subsequent editions of the work reduced the label&#x27;s use and later French editions replaced the word with &quot;{{lang|fr|faux}} (&#x27;false&#x27;) Nicodemus&quot; instead. While the epithet initially applied to crypto-protestants, it later came to be used broadly for anyone suspected of exhibiting a false appearance of their religious adherence and concealing their genuine beliefs.

=== United States ===
The discussion with Jesus is the source of several common expressions of contemporary American Christianity, specifically, the descriptive phrase &quot;born again&quot; used to describe salvation or baptism by some groups, and John 3:16, a commonly quoted verse used to describe God&#x27;s plan of salvation.

The Nicodemus National Historic Site, commemorating the only remaining western town established by African Americans during the Reconstruction Period following the American Civil War, is in Kansas. The National Park Service indicates the town&#x27;s name came from the 1864 piece, &quot;Wake Nicodemus&quot; by Henry Clay Work. Some point to the lyrics&#x27; use of the name &quot;Nicodemus&quot; as a figurative reference to the biblical figure. In the case of the song, Nicodemus is an enslaved African, long deceased, but acknowledged in the lyrics as both prophet and herald of freedom. The contrast in the lyrics between &quot;night&quot; and &quot;morning&quot;, and the enslaved Nicodemus&#x27; certainty in what the metaphorical &quot;morning&quot; would bring, have been seen as drawing a parallel to, and being inspired by, the story of the biblical figure. In one story, emancipation, and in the other, salvation, is to come &quot;in the morning&quot;; each Nicodemus has faith in their eventual advent. The lyrics say, in part:
{{poem quote|1=&quot;First verse&quot;:
Nicodemus, the slave, was of African birth,
And was bought for a bagful of gold;{{nbsp}}[...]
But he died years ago, very old.{{nbsp}}[...]
&quot;Wake me up!&quot; was his charge,
at the first break of day–
Wake me up for the great Jubilee!
{{nbsp}}
&quot;Chorus&quot;:
The &quot;Good Coming&quot; is almost here!
It was long, long, long on the way!
Now run and tell Elijah to hurry up, Pomp
And meet up at the gum tree down in the swamp,
To wake Nicodemus today.
{{nbsp}}
&quot;Fourth verse&quot;:
&#x27;Twas a long weary night – we were almost in fear
That the future was more than he knew;
&#x27;Twas a long weary night – but the morning is near,
And the words of our prophet are true.{{nbsp}}...|2=Extract from &quot;Wake Nicodemus&quot; by Henry Clay Work (1864)}}
Scholar of placenames, researcher Rosamund Rodman, noted in a 2008 article that enslaved people who learnt to read generally did so in secret and at night, due to risks of punishment for this forbidden activity. The gospel&#x27;s Nicodemus came to Jesus to learn from him, also in secret and at night, for fear of repercussions. Such connections and allusions lead Rodman to conclude that the town&#x27;s name has its ultimate origin with the biblical figure. Religious affairs journalist Daniel Burke notes that, &quot;To blacks after the Civil War, he was a model of rebirth as they sought to cast off their old identity as slaves&quot;.

On 16 August 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. invoked Nicodemus as a metaphor concerning the need for the United States to be &quot;born again&quot; in order to effectively address social and economic inequality. The speech was called &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot;, and delivered at the 11th Annual SCLC Convention in Atlanta, Georgia.

<text>Jan Olov Karlsson (1 June 1939 – 19 September 2016) was a Swedish politician; former Minister for Development Cooperation, Migration and Asylum Policy (2002-2003) and acting Minister for Foreign Affairs (11 September-10 October 2003), following the murder of Anna Lindh. He also served as President of the European Court of Auditors.

==Career==
Jan O. Karlsson studied economics, political science and history at Stockholm University, before becoming an undersecretary at the Ministry of Agriculture in 1962. In 1968 he transferred to the Office of the Prime Minister where he worked as an advisor. From 1973 he served as secretary to the Deputy Mayor of Stockholm and in 1977 he became the deputy secretary for the presidency of the Nordic Council. Following the election in 1982 when the Social Democrats returned to power he was made state secretary at the Ministry of Finance. Following the election in 1988 he was instead made chairman for the government commission of inquiry on metropolitan areas, and in 1990 once again advisor and coordinator at the prime minister&#x27;s Office.

Between 1991 and 1994 when the Social Democrats were in opposition Karlsson worked as an advisor for the party parliamentary group. In the autumn of 1994 the Swedes went to the ballot box on two occasions. The first swept the Social Democrats back to power and in the second Sweden joined the European Union. As a consequence of this Jan O. Karlsson was nominated by the Swedish Government as its representative to the European Court of Auditors in 1995, and on 18 January 1999 he became President of the Court. As the head of a principal organ in the European Union he held one of the most senior position within the European Union, number five in the top hierarchy. He held this position until 31 December 2001 when he resigned after being offered a cabinet post. He died on 19 September 2016 at the age of 77.

==Minister==
Jan O. Karlsson&#x27;s tenure as minister was far from smooth, his relation with the local press was troublesome, often attributed to his late father, who also was a high ranking social democratic politician, who died of a heart attack during an interview with a journalist. In spite of a number of minor political scandals – he, among other things, referred to George W. Bush as &quot;that damn Texan geezer&quot; (&quot;den där jävla texasgubben&quot;) and abruptly murmured (with a microphone attached to his jacket) &quot;now we better see an end to these fag issues&quot; (&quot;nu får det väl vara slut på de här bögfrågorna&quot;) during a SIDA conference – he was able to maintain the trust of prime minister Göran Persson and keep his place in the Cabinet. His appointment as acting Minister for Foreign Affairs following the death of Anna Lindh on 11 September 2003, was a short-term solution. Changes in government, effective on 10 October the same year, forced him to resign his post.

<text>A credit default swap (CDS) is a financial swap agreement that the seller of the CDS will compensate the buyer in the event of a debt default (by the debtor) or other credit event. That is, the seller of the CDS insures the buyer against some reference asset defaulting. The buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (the CDS &quot;fee&quot; or &quot;spread&quot;) to the seller and, in exchange, may expect to receive a payoff if the asset defaults.

In the event of default, the buyer of the credit default swap receives compensation (usually the face value of the loan), and the seller of the CDS takes possession of the defaulted loan or its market value in cash. However, anyone can purchase a CDS, even buyers who do not hold the loan instrument and who have no direct insurable interest in the loan (these are called &quot;naked&quot; CDSs). If there are more CDS contracts outstanding than bonds in existence, a protocol exists to hold a credit event auction. The payment received is often substantially less than the face value of the loan.

==Overview==
Credit default swaps in their current form have existed since the early 1990s and increased in use in the early 2000s. By the end of 2007, the outstanding CDS amount was $62.2 trillion, falling to $26.3 trillion by mid-year 2010 and reportedly $25.5 trillion in early 2012. CDSs are not traded on an exchange and there is no required reporting of transactions to a government agency. During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the lack of transparency in this large market became a concern to regulators as it could pose a systemic risk. In March 2010, the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (see Sources of Market Data) announced it would give regulators greater access to its credit default swaps database. There is &quot;$8 trillion notional value outstanding&quot; as of June 2018.

==Uses==
Most CDSs are documented using standard forms drafted by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), although there are many variants. 
In addition to the basic, single-name swaps, there are basket default swaps (BDSs), index CDSs, funded CDSs (also called credit-linked notes), as well as loan-only credit default swaps (LCDS). 
Further, in addition to corporations and governments, the reference entity can include a special purpose vehicle issuing asset-backed securities.

CDS data can be used by financial professionals, regulators, and the media to monitor how the market views credit risk of any entity on which a CDS is available, which can be compared to that provided by the Credit Rating Agencies.

Some claim that derivatives such as CDS are potentially dangerous in that they combine priority in bankruptcy with a lack of transparency. A CDS can be unsecured (without collateral) and be at higher risk for a default.

==Description==
A &quot;credit default swap&quot; (CDS) is a credit derivative contract between two counterparties. The buyer makes periodic payments to the seller, and in return receives a payoff if an underlying financial instrument defaults or experiences a similar credit event. 

The CDS may refer to a specified loan or bond obligation of a &quot;reference entity&quot;, usually a corporation or government. The reference entity is not a party to the contract. The buyer makes regular premium payments to the seller, the premium amounts constituting the &quot;spread&quot; charged in basis points by the seller to insure against a credit event. If the reference entity defaults, the protection seller pays the buyer the par value of the bond in exchange for physical delivery of the bond, although settlement may also be by cash or auction.

A default is often referred to as a &quot;credit event&quot; and includes such events as failure to pay, restructuring and bankruptcy, or even a drop in the borrower&#x27;s credit rating. CDS contracts on sovereign obligations also usually include as credit events repudiation, moratorium, and acceleration. Most CDSs are in the $10–$20 million range with maturities between one and 10 years. Five years is the most typical maturity.

An investor or speculator may &quot;buy protection&quot; to hedge the risk of default on a bond or other debt instrument, regardless of whether such investor or speculator holds an interest in or bears any risk of loss relating to such bond or debt instrument. In this way, a CDS is similar to credit insurance, although CDSs are not subject to regulations governing traditional insurance. Also, investors can buy and sell protection without owning debt of the reference entity. These &quot;naked credit default swaps&quot; allow traders to speculate on the creditworthiness of reference entities. CDSs can be used to create synthetic long and short positions in the reference entity. Naked CDS constitute most of the market in CDS. In addition, CDSs can also be used in capital structure arbitrage.

As an example, imagine that an investor buys a CDS from AAA-Bank, where the reference entity is Risky Corp. The investor—the buyer of protection—will make regular payments to AAA-Bank—the seller of protection. &quot;If&quot; Risky Corp defaults on its debt, the investor receives a one-time payment from AAA-Bank, and the CDS contract is terminated.

If the investor owns Risky Corp&#x27;s debt (i.e., is owed money by Risky Corp), a CDS can act as a hedge. But investors can also buy CDS contracts referencing Risky Corp debt without actually owning any Risky Corp debt. This may be done for speculative purposes, to bet against the solvency of Risky Corp in a gamble to make money, or to hedge investments in other companies whose fortunes are expected to be similar to those of Risky Corp (see Uses).

If the reference entity (i.e., Risky Corp) defaults, one of two kinds of settlement can occur:
*the investor delivers a defaulted asset to Bank for payment of the par value, which is known as &quot;physical settlement&quot;;
*AAA-Bank pays the investor the difference between the par value and the market price of a specified debt obligation (even if Risky Corp defaults there is usually some &quot;recovery&quot;, i.e., not all the investor&#x27;s money is lost), which is known as &quot;cash settlement&quot;.

The &quot;spread&quot; of a CDS is the annual amount the protection buyer must pay the protection seller over the length of the contract, expressed as a percentage of the notional amount. For example, if the CDS spread of Risky Corp is 50 basis points, or 0.5% (1 basis point = 0.01%), then an investor buying $10 million worth of protection from AAA-Bank must pay the bank $50,000. Payments are usually made on a quarterly basis, in arrear. These payments continue until either the CDS contract expires or Risky Corp defaults.

All things being equal, at any given time, if the maturity of two credit default swaps is the same, then the CDS associated with a company with a &quot;higher&quot; CDS spread is considered &quot;more likely&quot; to default by the market, since a higher fee is being charged to protect against this happening. However, factors such as liquidity and estimated loss given default can affect the comparison. Credit spread rates and credit ratings of the underlying or reference obligations are considered among money managers to be the best indicators of the likelihood of sellers of CDSs having to perform under these contracts.

===Differences from insurance===
CDS contracts have obvious similarities with insurance contracts because the buyer pays a premium and, in return, receives a sum of money if an adverse event occurs.

However, there are also many differences, the most important being that an insurance contract provides an indemnity against the losses &quot;actually suffered&quot; by the policy holder on an asset in which it holds an insurable interest. By contrast, a CDS provides an equal payout to all holders, calculated using an agreed, market-wide method. The holder does not need to own the underlying security and does not even have to suffer a loss from the default event. The CDS can therefore be used to speculate on debt objects.

The other differences include:
* The seller might in principle not be a regulated entity (though in practice most are banks);
* The seller is not required to maintain reserves to cover the protection sold (this was a principal cause of AIG&#x27;s financial distress in 2008; it had insufficient reserves to meet the &quot;run&quot; of expected payouts caused by the collapse of the housing bubble);
* Insurance requires the buyer to disclose all known risks, while CDSs do not (the CDS seller can in many cases still determine potential risk, as the debt instrument being &quot;insured&quot; is a market commodity available for inspection, but in the case of certain instruments like CDOs made up of &quot;slices&quot; of debt packages, it can be difficult to tell exactly what is being insured); 
* Insurers manage risk primarily by setting loss reserves based on the Law of large numbers and actuarial analysis. Dealers in CDSs manage risk primarily through hedging with other CDS deals and in the underlying bond markets;
* CDS contracts are generally subject to mark-to-market accounting, introducing income statement and balance sheet volatility while insurance contracts are not;
* Hedge accounting may not be available under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) unless the requirements of FAS 133 are met. In practice this rarely happens;
* To cancel the insurance contract, the buyer can typically stop paying premiums, while for CDS the contract needs to be unwound.

===Risk===
When entering into a CDS, both the buyer and seller of credit protection take on counterparty risk:
* The buyer takes the risk that the seller may default. If AAA-Bank and Risky Corp. default simultaneously (&quot;double default&quot;), the buyer loses its protection against default by the reference entity. If AAA-Bank defaults but Risky Corp. does not, the buyer might need to replace the defaulted CDS at a higher cost.
* The seller takes the risk that the buyer may default on the contract, depriving the seller of the expected revenue stream. More importantly, a seller normally limits its risk by buying offsetting protection from another party — that is, it hedges its exposure. If the original buyer drops out, the seller squares its position by either unwinding the hedge transaction or by selling a new CDS to a third party. Depending on market conditions, that may be at a lower price than the original CDS and may therefore involve a loss to the seller.

In the future, in the event that regulatory reforms require that CDS be traded and settled via a central exchange/clearing house, such as ICE TCC, there will no longer be &quot;counterparty risk&quot;, as the risk of the counterparty will be held with the central exchange/clearing house.

As is true with other forms of over-the-counter derivatives, CDS might involve liquidity risk. If one or both parties to a CDS contract must post collateral (which is common), there can be margin calls requiring the posting of additional collateral. The required collateral is agreed on by the parties when the CDS is first issued. This margin amount may vary over the life of the CDS contract, if the market price of the CDS contract changes, or the credit rating of one of the parties changes. Many CDS contracts even require payment of an upfront fee (composed of &quot;reset to par&quot; and an &quot;initial coupon.&quot;).

Another kind of risk for the seller of credit default swaps is jump risk or jump-to-default risk (&quot;JTD risk&quot;). A seller of a CDS could be collecting monthly premiums with little expectation that the reference entity may default. A default creates a sudden obligation on the protection sellers to pay millions, if not billions, of dollars to protection buyers. This risk is not present in other over-the-counter derivatives.

===Sources of market data===
Data about the credit default swaps market is available from three main sources. Data on an annual and semiannual basis is available from the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) since 2001 and from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) since 2004. The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), through its global repository Trade Information Warehouse (TIW), provides weekly data but publicly available information goes back only one year. The numbers provided by each source do not always match because each provider uses different sampling methods. Daily, intraday and real time data is available from S&amp;P Capital IQ through their acquisition of Credit Market Analysis in 2012.

According to DTCC, the Trade Information Warehouse maintains the only &quot;global electronic database for virtually all CDS contracts outstanding in the marketplace.&quot;

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency publishes quarterly credit derivative data about insured U.S commercial banks and trust companies.

==Uses==
Credit default swaps can be used by investors for speculation, hedging and arbitrage.

===Speculation===
Credit default swaps allow investors to speculate on changes in CDS spreads of single names or of market indices such as the North American CDX index or the European iTraxx index. An investor might believe that an entity&#x27;s CDS spreads are too high or too low, relative to the entity&#x27;s bond yields, and attempt to profit from that view by entering into a trade, known as a basis trade, that combines a CDS with a cash bond and an interest rate swap.

Finally, an investor might speculate on an entity&#x27;s credit quality, since generally CDS spreads increase as credit-worthiness declines, and decline as credit-worthiness increases. The investor might therefore buy CDS protection on a company to speculate that it is about to default. Alternatively, the investor might sell protection if it thinks that the company&#x27;s creditworthiness might improve. The investor selling the CDS is viewed as being &quot;long&quot; on the CDS and the credit, as if the investor owned the bond. In contrast, the investor who bought protection is &quot;short&quot; on the CDS and the underlying credit.

Credit default swaps opened up important new avenues to speculators. Investors could go long on a bond without any upfront cost of buying a bond; all the investor need do was promise to pay in the event of default. Shorting a bond faced difficult practical problems, such that shorting was often not feasible; CDS made shorting credit possible and popular. Because the speculator in either case does not own the bond, its position is said to be a synthetic long or short position.

For example, a hedge fund believes that Risky Corp will soon default on its debt. Therefore, it buys $10 million worth of CDS protection for two years from AAA-Bank, with Risky Corp as the reference entity, at a spread of 500 basis points (=5%) per annum.
*If Risky Corp does indeed default after, say, one year, then the hedge fund will have paid $500,000 to AAA-Bank, but then receives $10 million (assuming zero recovery rate, and that AAA-Bank has the liquidity to cover the loss), thereby making a profit. AAA-Bank, and its investors, will incur a $9.5 million loss minus recovery unless the bank has somehow offset the position before the default.
*However, if Risky Corp does not default, then the CDS contract runs for two years, and the hedge fund ends up paying $1 million, without any return, thereby making a loss. AAA-Bank, by selling protection, has made $1 million without any upfront investment.

Note that there is a third possibility in the above scenario; the hedge fund could decide to liquidate its position after a certain period of time in an attempt to realise its gains or losses. For example:
* After 1 year, the market now considers Risky Corp &quot;more likely&quot; to default, so its CDS spread has &quot;widened&quot; from 500 to 1500 basis points. The hedge fund may choose to &quot;sell&quot; $10 million worth of protection for 1 year to AAA-Bank at this higher rate. Therefore, over the two years the hedge fund pays the bank 2 * 5% * $10 million = $1 million, but receives 1 * 15% * $10 million = $1.5 million, giving a total profit of $500,000.
* In another scenario, after one year the market now considers Risky much &quot;less likely&quot; to default, so its CDS spread has &quot;tightened&quot; from 500 to 250 basis points. Again, the hedge fund may choose to &quot;sell&quot; $10 million worth of protection for 1 year to AAA-Bank at this lower spread. Therefore, over the two years the hedge fund pays the bank 2 * 5% * $10 million = $1 million, but receives 1 * 2.5% * $10 million = $250,000, giving a total loss of $750,000. This loss is smaller than the $1 million loss that would have occurred if the second transaction had not been entered into.

Transactions such as these do not even have to be entered into over the long-term. If Risky Corp&#x27;s CDS spread had widened by just a couple of basis points over the course of one day, the hedge fund could have entered into an offsetting contract immediately and made a small profit over the life of the two CDS contracts.

Credit default swaps are also used to structure synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Instead of owning bonds or loans, a synthetic CDO gets credit exposure to a portfolio of fixed income assets without owning those assets through the use of CDS. CDOs are viewed as complex and opaque financial instruments. An example of a synthetic CDO is Abacus 2007-AC1, which is the subject of the civil suit for fraud brought by the SEC against Goldman Sachs in April 2010. Abacus is a synthetic CDO consisting of credit default swaps referencing a variety of mortgage-backed securities.

====Naked credit default swaps====
In the examples above, the hedge fund did not own any debt of Risky Corp. A CDS in which the buyer does not own the underlying debt is referred to as a &quot;naked credit default swap&quot;, estimated to be up to 80% of the credit default swap market. There is currently a debate in the United States and Europe about whether speculative uses of credit default swaps should be banned. Legislation is under consideration by Congress as part of financial reform.

Critics assert that naked CDSs should be banned, comparing them to buying fire insurance on your neighbor&#x27;s house, which creates a huge incentive for arson. Analogizing to the concept of insurable interest, critics say you should not be able to buy a CDS—insurance against default—when you do not own the bond. Short selling is also viewed as gambling and the CDS market as a casino.
Another concern is the size of the CDS market. Because naked credit default swaps are synthetic, there is no limit to how many can be sold. The gross amount of CDSs far exceeds all &quot;real&quot; corporate bonds and loans outstanding. As a result, the risk of default is magnified leading to concerns about systemic risk.

Financier George Soros called for an outright ban on naked credit default swaps, viewing them as &quot;toxic&quot; and allowing speculators to bet against and &quot;bear raid&quot; companies or countries. His concerns were echoed by several European politicians who, during the Greek government-debt crisis, accused naked CDS buyers of making the crisis worse.

Despite these concerns, former United States Secretary of the Treasury Geithner and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gensler are not in favor of an outright ban on naked credit default swaps. They prefer greater transparency and better capitalization requirements. These officials think that naked CDSs have a place in the market.

Proponents of naked credit default swaps say that short selling in various forms, whether credit default swaps, options or futures, has the beneficial effect of increasing liquidity in the marketplace. That benefits hedging activities. Without speculators buying and selling naked CDSs, banks wanting to hedge might not find a ready seller of protection. Speculators also create a more competitive marketplace, keeping prices down for hedgers. A robust market in credit default swaps can also serve as a barometer to regulators and investors about the credit health of a company or country.

Germany&#x27;s market regulator BaFin found that naked CDS did not worsen the Greek credit crisis. Without credit default swaps, Greece&#x27;s borrowing costs would be higher. As of November 2011, the Greek bonds have a bond yield of 28%.

A bill in the U.S. Congress proposed giving a public authority the power to limit the use of CDSs other than for hedging purposes, but the bill did not become law.

===Hedging===
Credit default swaps are often used to manage the risk of default that arises from holding debt. A bank, for example, may hedge its risk that a borrower may default on a loan by entering into a CDS contract as the buyer of protection. If the loan goes into default, the proceeds from the CDS contract cancel out the losses on the underlying debt.

There are other ways to eliminate or reduce the risk of default. The bank could sell (that is, assign) the loan outright or bring in other banks as participants. However, these options may not meet the bank&#x27;s needs. Consent of the corporate borrower is often required. The bank may not want to incur the time and cost to find loan participants.

If both the borrower and lender are well-known and the market (or even worse, the news media) learns that the bank is selling the loan, then the sale may be viewed as signaling a lack of trust in the borrower, which could severely damage the banker-client relationship. In addition, the bank simply may not want to sell or share the potential profits from the loan. By buying a credit default swap, the bank can lay off default risk while still keeping the loan in its portfolio. The downside to this hedge is that without default risk, a bank may have no motivation to actively monitor the loan and the counterparty has no relationship to the borrower.

Another kind of hedge is against concentration risk. A bank&#x27;s risk management team may advise that the bank is overly concentrated with a particular borrower or industry. The bank can lay off some of this risk by buying a CDS. Because the borrower—the reference entity—is not a party to a credit default swap, entering into a CDS allows the bank to achieve its diversity objectives without impacting its loan portfolio or customer relations. 
Similarly, a bank selling a CDS can diversify its portfolio by gaining exposure to an industry in which the selling bank has no customer base.

A bank buying protection can also use a CDS to free regulatory capital. By offloading a particular credit risk, a bank is not required to hold as much capital in reserve against the risk of default (traditionally 8% of the total loan under Basel I). This frees resources the bank can use to make other loans to the same key customer or to other borrowers.

Hedging risk is not limited to banks as lenders. Holders of corporate bonds, such as banks, pension funds or insurance companies, may buy a CDS as a hedge for similar reasons.
Pension fund example: A pension fund owns five-year bonds issued by Risky Corp with par value of $10 million. To manage the risk of losing money if Risky Corp defaults on its debt, the pension fund buys a CDS from Derivative Bank in a notional amount of $10 million. The CDS trades at 200 basis points (200 basis points = 2.00 percent). In return for this credit protection, the pension fund pays 2% of $10 million ($200,000) per annum in quarterly installments of $50,000 to Derivative Bank.
*If Risky Corporation does not default on its bond payments, the pension fund makes quarterly payments to Derivative Bank for 5 years and receives its $10 million back after five years from Risky Corp. Though the protection payments totaling $1 million reduce investment returns for the pension fund, its risk of loss due to Risky Corp defaulting on the bond is eliminated.
*If Risky Corporation defaults on its debt three years into the CDS contract, the pension fund would stop paying the quarterly premium, and Derivative Bank would ensure that the pension fund is refunded for its loss of $10 million minus recovery (either by physical or cash settlement — see Settlement below). The pension fund still loses the $600,000 it has paid over three years, but without the CDS contract it would have lost the entire $10 million minus recovery.

In addition to financial institutions, large suppliers can use a credit default swap on a public bond issue or a basket of similar risks as a proxy for its own credit risk exposure on receivables.

Although credit default swaps have been highly criticized for their role in the 2007–2008 financial crisis, most observers conclude that using credit default swaps as a hedging device has a useful purpose.

===Arbitrage===
&quot;Capital Structure Arbitrage&quot; is an example of an arbitrage strategy that uses CDS transactions. This technique relies on the fact that a company&#x27;s stock price and its CDS spread should exhibit negative correlation; i.e., if the outlook for a company improves then its share price should go up and its CDS spread should tighten, since it is less likely to default on its debt. However, if its outlook worsens then its CDS spread should widen and its stock price should fall.

Techniques reliant on this are known as capital structure arbitrage because they exploit market inefficiencies between different parts of the same company&#x27;s capital structure; i.e., mis-pricings between a company&#x27;s debt and equity. An arbitrageur attempts to exploit the &quot;spread&quot; between a company&#x27;s CDS and its equity in certain situations.

For example, if a company has announced some bad news and its share price has dropped by 25%, but its CDS spread has remained unchanged, then an investor might expect the CDS spread to increase relative to the share price. Therefore, a basic strategy would be to go long on the CDS spread (by buying CDS protection) while simultaneously hedging oneself by buying the underlying stock. This technique would benefit in the event of the CDS spread widening relative to the equity price, but would lose money if the company&#x27;s CDS spread tightened relative to its equity.

An interesting situation in which the inverse correlation between a company&#x27;s stock price and CDS spread breaks down is during a Leveraged buyout (LBO). Frequently this leads to the company&#x27;s CDS spread widening due to the extra debt that will soon be put on the company&#x27;s books, but also an &quot;increase&quot; in its share price, since buyers of a company usually end up paying a premium.

Another common arbitrage strategy aims to exploit the fact that the swap-adjusted spread of a CDS should trade closely with that of the underlying cash bond issued by the reference entity. Misalignment in spreads may occur due to technical reasons such as:
*Specific settlement differences
*Shortages in a particular underlying instrument
*The cost of funding a position
*Existence of buyers constrained from buying exotic derivatives.
The difference between CDS spreads and asset swap spreads is called the &quot;basis&quot; and should theoretically be close to zero. Basis trades attempt to exploit this difference to make a profit, however hedging a bond with a CDS does have irreducible risks which should be considered when making basis trades.

==History==

===Conception===
Forms of credit default swaps had been in existence from at least the early 1990s, with early trades carried out by Bankers Trust in 1991. J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and economist Blythe Masters are widely credited with creating the modern credit default swap in 1994. In that instance, J.P. Morgan had extended a $4.8 billion credit line to Exxon, which faced the threat of $5 billion in punitive damages for the Exxon Valdez oil spill. A team of J.P. Morgan bankers led by Masters then sold the credit risk from the credit line to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development in order to cut the reserves that J.P. Morgan was required to hold against Exxon&#x27;s default, thus improving its own balance sheet.

Despite early successes, credit default swaps could not be profitable until an industrialized and streamlined process was created to issue them. This changed when CDS&#x27;s began to be traded as securities from JPMorgan, an effort led by Bill Demchak where he and his team created bundles of swaps and sold them to investors. The investors would get the streams of revenue, according to the risk-and-reward level they chose; the bank would get insurance against its loans, and fees for setting up the deal.

In 1997, JPMorgan developed a proprietary product called BISTRO (Broad Index Securitized Trust Offering) that used CDS to clean up a bank&#x27;s balance sheet. The advantage of BISTRO was that it used securitization to split up the credit risk into little pieces that smaller investors found more digestible, since most investors lacked EBRD&#x27;s capability to accept $4.8 billion in credit risk all at once. BISTRO was the first example of what later became known as synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). There were two Bistros in 1997 for approximately $10 billion (~$ in ) each.

Mindful of the concentration of default risk as one of the causes of the S&amp;L crisis, regulators initially found CDS&#x27;s ability to disperse default risk attractive. 
In 2000, credit default swaps became largely exempt from regulation by both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, which was also responsible for the Enron loophole, specifically stated that CDSs are neither futures nor securities and so are outside the remit of the SEC and CFTC.

===Market growth===
At first, banks were the dominant players in the market, as CDS were primarily used to hedge risk in connection with their lending activities. Banks also saw an opportunity to free up regulatory capital. By March 1998, the global market for CDS was estimated at $300 billion, with JP Morgan alone accounting for about $50 billion of this.

The high market share enjoyed by the banks was soon eroded as more and more asset managers and hedge funds saw trading opportunities in credit default swaps. By 2002, investors as speculators, rather than banks as hedgers, dominated the market.
National banks in the USA used credit default swaps as early as 1996. In that year, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency measured the size of the market as tens of billions of dollars. Six years later, by year-end 2002, the outstanding amount was over $2 trillion (~$ in ).

Although speculators fueled the exponential growth, other factors also played a part. An extended market could not emerge until 1999, when ISDA standardized the documentation for credit default swaps. Also, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis spurred a market for CDS in emerging market sovereign debt. In addition, in 2004, index trading began on a large scale and grew rapidly.

The market size for Credit Default Swaps more than doubled in size each year from $3.7 trillion in 2003. By the end of 2007, the CDS market had a notional value of $62.2 trillion. But notional amount fell during 2008 as a result of dealer &quot;portfolio compression&quot; efforts (replacing offsetting redundant contracts), and by the end of 2008 notional amount outstanding had fallen 38 percent to $38.6 trillion.

Explosive growth was not without operational headaches. On September 15, 2005, the New York Fed summoned 14 banks to its offices. Billions of dollars of CDS were traded daily but the record keeping was more than two weeks behind. This created severe risk management issues, as counterparties were in legal and financial limbo. U.K. authorities expressed the same concerns.

===Market as of 2008===

Since default is a relatively rare occurrence (historically around 0.2% of investment grade companies default in any one year), in most CDS contracts the only payments are the premium payments from buyer to seller. Thus, although the above figures for outstanding notionals are very large, in the absence of default the net cash flows are only a small fraction of this total: for a 100 bp = 1% spread, the annual cash flows are only 1% of the notional amount.

====Regulatory concerns over CDS====
The market for Credit Default Swaps attracted considerable concern from regulators after a number of large scale incidents in 2008, starting with the collapse of Bear Stearns.

In the days and weeks leading up to Bear&#x27;s collapse, the bank&#x27;s CDS spread widened dramatically, indicating a surge of buyers taking out protection on the bank. It has been suggested that this widening was responsible for the perception that Bear Stearns was vulnerable, and therefore restricted its access to wholesale capital, which eventually led to its forced sale to JP Morgan in March. An alternative view is that this surge in CDS protection buyers was a &quot;symptom&quot; rather than a &quot;cause&quot; of Bear&#x27;s collapse; i.e., investors saw that Bear was in trouble, and sought to hedge any naked exposure to the bank, or speculate on its collapse.

In September, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers caused a total close to $400 billion to become payable to the buyers of CDS protection referenced against the insolvent bank. However the net amount that changed hands was around $7.2 billion. This difference is due to the process of &#x27;netting&#x27;. Market participants co-operated so that CDS sellers were allowed to deduct from their payouts the inbound funds due to them from their hedging positions. Dealers generally attempt to remain risk-neutral, so that their losses and gains after big events offset each other.

Also in September American International Group (AIG) required an $85 billion federal loan because it had been excessively selling CDS protection without hedging against the possibility that the reference entities might decline in value, which exposed the insurance giant to potential losses over $100 billion. The CDS on Lehman were settled smoothly, as was largely the case for the other 11 credit events occurring in 2008 that triggered payouts. And while it is arguable that other incidents would have been as bad or worse if less efficient instruments than CDS had been used for speculation and insurance purposes, the closing months of 2008 saw regulators working hard to reduce the risk involved in CDS transactions.

In 2008 there was no centralized exchange or clearing house for CDS transactions; they were all done over the counter (OTC). This led to recent calls for the market to open up in terms of transparency and regulation.

In November 2008 the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which runs a warehouse for CDS trade confirmations accounting for around 90% of the total market, announced that it will release market data on the outstanding notional of CDS trades on a weekly basis. The data can be accessed on the DTCC&#x27;s website here:

By 2010, Intercontinental Exchange, through its subsidiaries, ICE Trust in New York, launched in 2008, and ICE Clear Europe Limited in London, UK, launched in July 2009, clearing entities for credit default swaps (CDS) had cleared more than $10 trillion in credit default swaps (CDS) (Terhune Bloomberg Business Week 2010-07-29). Bloomberg&#x27;s Terhune (2010) explained how investors seeking high-margin returns use Credit Default Swaps (CDS) to bet against financial instruments owned by other companies and countries. Intercontinental&#x27;s clearing houses guarantee every transaction between buyer and seller providing a much-needed safety net reducing the impact of a default by spreading the risk. ICE collects on every trade.(Terhune Bloomberg Business Week 2010-07-29). Brookings senior research fellow, Robert E. Litan, cautioned however, &quot;valuable pricing data will not be fully reported, leaving ICE&#x27;s institutional partners with a huge informational advantage over other traders. He calls ICE Trust &quot;a derivatives dealers&#x27; club&quot; in which members make money at the expense of nonmembers (Terhune citing Litan in Bloomberg Business Week 2010-07-29). (Litan Derivatives Dealers’ Club 2010).&quot; Actually, Litan conceded that &quot;some limited progress toward central clearing of CDS has been made in recent months, with CDS contracts between dealers now being cleared centrally primarily through one clearinghouse (ICE Trust) in which the dealers have a significant financial interest (Litan 2010:6).&quot; However, &quot;as long as ICE Trust has a monopoly in clearing, watch for the dealers to limit the expansion of the products that are centrally cleared, and to create barriers to electronic trading and smaller dealers making competitive markets in cleared products (Litan 2010:8).&quot;

In 2009 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission granted an exemption for Intercontinental Exchange to begin guaranteeing credit-default swaps. The SEC exemption represented the last regulatory approval needed by Atlanta-based Intercontinental. A derivatives analyst at Morgan Stanley, one of the backers for IntercontinentalExchange&#x27;s subsidiary, ICE Trust in New York, launched in 2008, claimed that the &quot;clearinghouse, and changes to the contracts to standardize them, will probably boost activity&quot;. IntercontinentalExchange&#x27;s subsidiary, ICE Trust&#x27;s larger competitor, CME Group Inc., hasn&#x27;t received an SEC exemption, and agency spokesman John Nester said he didn&#x27;t know when a decision would be made.

===Market as of 2009===
The early months of 2009 saw several fundamental changes to the way CDSs operate, resulting from concerns over the instruments&#x27; safety after the events of the previous year. According to Deutsche Bank managing director Athanassios Diplas &quot;the industry pushed through 10 years worth of changes in just a few months&quot;.
By late 2008 processes had been introduced allowing CDSs that offset each other to be cancelled. Along with termination of contracts that have recently paid out such as those based on Lehmans, this had by March reduced the face value of the market down to an estimated $30 trillion.

The Bank for International Settlements estimates that outstanding derivatives total $708 trillion. U.S. and European regulators are developing separate plans to stabilize the derivatives market. Additionally there are some globally agreed standards falling into place in March 2009, administered by International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA). Two of the key changes are:

1. The introduction of central clearing houses, one for the US and one for Europe. A clearing house acts as the central counterparty to both sides of a CDS transaction, thereby reducing the counterparty risk that both buyer and seller face.

2. The international standardization of CDS contracts, to prevent legal disputes in ambiguous cases where what the payout should be is unclear.

Speaking before the changes went live, Sivan Mahadevan, a derivatives analyst at Morgan Stanley, one of the backers for IntercontinentalExchange&#x27;s subsidiary, ICE Trust in New York, launched in 2008, claimed that 

In the U.S., central clearing operations began in March 2009, operated by InterContinental Exchange (ICE). A key competitor also interested in entering the CDS clearing sector is CME Group.

In Europe, CDS Index clearing was launched by IntercontinentalExchange&#x27;s European subsidiary ICE Clear Europe on July 31, 2009. It launched Single Name clearing in Dec 2009. By the end of 2009, it had cleared CDS contracts worth EUR 885 billion reducing the open interest down to EUR 75 billion

By the end of 2009, banks had reclaimed much of their market share; hedge funds had largely retreated from the market after the crises. According to an estimate by the Banque de France, by late 2009 the bank JP Morgan alone now had about 30% of the global CDS market.

====Government approvals relating to ICE and its competitor CME====
The SEC&#x27;s approval for ICE Futures&#x27; request to be exempted from rules that would prevent it clearing CDSs was the third government action granted to Intercontinental in one week. On March 3, its proposed acquisition of Clearing Corp., a Chicago clearinghouse owned by eight of the largest dealers in the credit-default swap market, was approved by the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. On March 5, 2009, the Federal Reserve Board, which oversees the clearinghouse, granted a request for ICE to begin clearing.

Clearing Corp. shareholders including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG, received $39 million in cash from Intercontinental in the acquisition, as well as the Clearing Corp.’s cash on hand and a 50–50 profit-sharing agreement with Intercontinental on the revenue generated from processing the swaps.

SEC spokesperson John Nestor stated 

Other proposals to clear credit-default swaps have been made by NYSE Euronext, Eurex AG and LCH.Clearnet Ltd. Only the NYSE effort is available now for clearing after starting on Dec. 22. As of Jan. 30, no swaps had been cleared by the NYSE’s London- based derivatives exchange, according to NYSE Chief Executive Officer Duncan Niederauer.

====Clearing house member requirements====
Members of the Intercontinental clearinghouse ICE Trust (now ICE Clear Credit) in March 2009 would have to have a net worth of at least $5 billion (~$ in ) and a credit rating of A or better to clear their credit-default swap trades. Intercontinental said in the statement today that all market participants such as hedge funds, banks or other institutions are open to become members of the clearinghouse as long as they meet these requirements.

A clearinghouse acts as the buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer, reducing the risk of counterparty defaulting on a transaction. In the over-the-counter market, where credit- default swaps are currently traded, participants are exposed to each other in case of a default. A clearinghouse also provides one location for regulators to view traders’ positions and prices.

===J.P. Morgan losses===
In April 2012, hedge fund insiders became aware that the market in credit default swaps was possibly being affected by the activities of Bruno Iksil, a trader at J.P. Morgan Chief Investment Office (CIO), referred to as &quot;the London whale&quot; in reference to the huge positions he was taking. Heavy opposing bets to his positions are known to have been made by traders, including another branch of J.P. Morgan, who purchased the derivatives offered by J.P. Morgan in such high volume. Major losses, $2 billion (~$ in ), were reported by the firm in May 2012 in relationship to these trades. The disclosure, which resulted in headlines in the media, did not disclose the exact nature of the trading involved, which remains in progress. The item traded, possibly related to CDX IG 9, an index based on the default risk of major U.S. corporations, has been described as a &quot;derivative of a derivative&quot;.

==Terms of a typical CDS contract==
A CDS contract is typically documented under a &quot;confirmation&quot; referencing the credit derivatives definitions as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. The confirmation typically specifies a &quot;reference entity&quot;, a corporation or sovereign that generally, although not always, has debt outstanding, and a &quot;reference obligation&quot;, usually an unsubordinated corporate bond or government bond. The period over which default protection extends is defined by the contract &quot;effective date&quot; and &quot;scheduled termination date&quot;.

The confirmation also specifies a &quot;calculation agent&quot; who is responsible for making determinations as to &quot;successors&quot; and &quot;substitute reference obligations&quot; (for example necessary if the original reference obligation was a loan that is repaid before the expiry of the contract), and for performing various calculation and administrative functions in connection with the transaction. By market convention, in contracts between CDS dealers and end-users, the dealer is generally the calculation agent, and in contracts between CDS dealers, the protection seller is generally the calculation agent.

It is not the responsibility of the calculation agent to determine whether or not a credit event has occurred but rather a matter of fact that, pursuant to the terms of typical contracts, must be supported by &quot;publicly available information&quot; delivered along with a &quot;credit event notice&quot;. Typical CDS contracts do not provide an internal mechanism for challenging the occurrence or non-occurrence of a credit event and rather leave the matter to the courts if necessary, though actual instances of specific events being disputed are relatively rare.

CDS confirmations also specify the &quot;credit events&quot; that will give rise to payment obligations by the protection seller and delivery obligations by the protection buyer. Typical credit events include &quot;bankruptcy&quot; with respect to the reference entity and &quot;failure to pay&quot; with respect to its direct or guaranteed bond or loan debt. CDS written on North American investment grade corporate reference entities, European corporate reference entities and sovereigns generally also include &quot;restructuring&quot; as a credit event, whereas trades referencing North American high-yield corporate reference entities typically do not.

Finally, standard CDS contracts specify &quot;deliverable obligation characteristics&quot; that limit the range of obligations that a protection buyer may deliver upon a credit event. Trading conventions for deliverable obligation characteristics vary for different markets and CDS contract types. Typical limitations include that deliverable debt be a bond or loan, that it have a maximum maturity of 30 years, that it not be subordinated, that it not be subject to transfer restrictions (other than Rule 144A), that it be of a standard currency and that it not be subject to some contingency before becoming due.

The premium payments are generally quarterly, with maturity dates (and likewise premium payment dates) falling on March 20, June 20, September 20, and December 20. Due to the proximity to the IMM dates, which fall on the third Wednesday of these months, these CDS maturity dates are also referred to as &quot;IMM dates&quot;.

==Credit default swap and sovereign debt crisis==


The European sovereign debt crisis resulted from a combination of complex factors, including the globalisation of finance; easy credit conditions during the 2002–2008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the 2007–2008 financial crisis; international trade imbalances; real estate bubbles that have since burst; the Great Recession; fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses; and approaches used by nations to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socialising losses.
The Credit default swap market also reveals the beginning of the sovereign crisis.

Since December 1, 2011 the European Parliament has banned naked Credit default swap (CDS) on the debt for sovereign nations.

The definition of restructuring is quite technical but is essentially intended to respond to circumstances where a reference entity, as a result of the deterioration of its credit, negotiates changes in the terms in its debt with its creditors as an alternative to formal insolvency proceedings (i.e. the debt is &quot;restructured&quot;). During the 2012 Greek government-debt crisis, one important issue was whether the restructuring would trigger Credit default swap (CDS) payments. European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund negotiators avoided these triggers as they could have jeopardized the stability of major European banks who had been protection writers. An alternative could have been to create new CDS which clearly would pay in the event of debt restructuring. The market would have paid the spread between these and old (potentially more ambiguous) CDS. This practice is far more typical in jurisdictions that do not provide protective status to insolvent debtors similar to that provided by Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In particular, concerns arising out of Conseco&#x27;s restructuring in 2000 led to the credit event&#x27;s removal from North American high yield trades.

==Settlement==

===Physical or cash===
As described in an earlier section, if a credit event occurs then CDS contracts can either be &quot;physically settled&quot; or &quot;cash settled&quot;.

* Physical settlement: The protection seller pays the buyer par value, and in return takes delivery of a debt obligation of the reference entity. For example, a hedge fund has bought $5 million worth of protection from a bank on the senior debt of a company. In the event of a default, the bank pays the hedge fund $5 million cash, and the hedge fund must deliver $5 million face value of senior debt of the company (typically bonds or loans, which are typically worth very little given that the company is in default).
* Cash settlement: The protection seller pays the buyer the difference between par value and the market price of a debt obligation of the reference entity. For example, a hedge fund has bought $5 million worth of protection from a bank on the senior debt of a company. This company has now defaulted, and its senior bonds are now trading at 25 (i.e., 25 cents on the dollar) since the market believes that senior bondholders will receive 25% of the money they are owed once the company is wound up (all the defaulting company&#x27;s liquidable assets are sold off). Therefore, the bank must pay the hedge fund $5 million × (100% − 25%) = $3.75 million.

The development and growth of the CDS market has meant that on many companies there is now a much larger outstanding notional of CDS contracts than the outstanding notional value of its debt obligations. (This is because many parties made CDS contracts for speculative purposes, without actually owning any debt that they wanted to insure against default. See &quot;naked&quot; CDS) For example, at the time it filed for bankruptcy on September 14, 2008, Lehman Brothers had approximately $155 billion of outstanding debt but around $400 billion notional value of CDS contracts had been written that referenced this debt. Clearly not all of these contracts could be physically settled, since there was not enough outstanding Lehman Brothers debt to fulfill all of the contracts, demonstrating the necessity for cash settled CDS trades. The trade confirmation produced when a CDS is traded states whether the contract is to be physically or cash settled.

===Auctions===
When a credit event occurs on a major company on which a lot of CDS contracts are written, an auction (also known as a &quot;credit-fixing event&quot;) may be held to facilitate settlement of a large number of contracts at once, at a fixed cash settlement price. During the auction process participating dealers (e.g., the big investment banks) submit prices at which they would buy and sell the reference entity&#x27;s debt obligations, as well as net requests for physical settlement against par. A second stage Dutch auction is held following the publication of the initial midpoint of the dealer markets and what is the net open interest to deliver or be delivered actual bonds or loans. The final clearing point of this auction sets the final price for cash settlement of all CDS contracts and all physical settlement requests as well as matched limit offers resulting from the auction are actually settled. According to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), who organised them, auctions have recently proved an effective way of settling the very large volume of outstanding CDS contracts written on companies such as Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual. Commentator Felix Salmon, however, has questioned in advance ISDA&#x27;s ability to structure an auction, as defined to date, to set compensation associated with a 2012 bond swap in Greek government debt. For its part, ISDA in the leadup to a 50% or greater &quot;haircut&quot; for Greek bondholders, issued an opinion that the bond swap would not constitute a default event.

Below is a list of the auctions that have been held since 2005.

==Pricing and valuation==
There are two competing theories usually advanced for the pricing of credit default swaps. The first, referred to herein as the &#x27;probability model&#x27;, takes the present value of a series of cashflows weighted by their probability of non-default. This method suggests that credit default swaps should trade at a considerably lower spread than corporate bonds.

The second model, proposed by Darrell Duffie, but also by John Hull and Alan White, uses a no-arbitrage approach.

===Probability model===
Under the probability model, a credit default swap is priced using a model that takes four inputs; this is similar to the rNPV (risk-adjusted NPV) model used in drug development:
*the &quot;issue premium&quot;,
*the recovery rate (percentage of notional repaid in event of default),
*the &quot;credit curve&quot; for the reference entity and
*the &quot;LIBOR curve&quot;.
If default events never occurred the price of a CDS would simply be the sum of the discounted premium payments. So CDS pricing models have to take into account the possibility of a default occurring some time between the effective date and maturity date of the CDS contract. For the purpose of explanation we can imagine the case of a one-year CDS with effective date formula_1 with four quarterly premium payments occurring at times formula_2, formula_3, formula_4, and formula_5. If the nominal for the CDS is formula_6 and the issue premium is formula_7 then the size of the quarterly premium payments is formula_8. If we assume for simplicity that defaults can only occur on one of the payment dates then there are five ways the contract could end:
*either it does not have any default at all, so the four premium payments are made and the contract survives until the maturity date, or
*a default occurs on the first, second, third or fourth payment date.

To price the CDS we now need to assign probabilities to the five possible outcomes, then calculate the present value of the payoff for each outcome. The present value of the CDS is then simply the present value of the five payoffs multiplied by their probability of occurring.
For a simplified numeric example, see 
and
This is illustrated in the following tree diagram where at each payment date either the contract has a default event, in which case it ends with a payment of formula_9 shown in red, where formula_10 is the recovery rate, or it survives without a default being triggered, in which case a premium payment of formula_8 is made, shown in blue. At either side of the diagram are the cashflows up to that point in time with premium payments in blue and default payments in red. If the contract is terminated the square is shown with solid shading.

The probability of surviving over the interval formula_12 to formula_13 without a default payment is formula_14 and the probability of a default being triggered is formula_15. The calculation of present value, given discount factor of formula_16 to formula_17 is then

The probabilities formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, formula_21 can be calculated using the credit spread curve. The probability of no default occurring over a time period from formula_22 to formula_23 decays exponentially with a time-constant determined by the credit spread, or mathematically formula_24 where formula_25 is the credit spread zero curve at time formula_22. The riskier the reference entity the greater the spread and the more rapidly the survival probability decays with time.

To get the total present value of the credit default swap we multiply the probability of each outcome by its present value to give
Grouped by cash flow direction (receiving protection and paying premium):
===No-arbitrage model===
In the &quot;no-arbitrage&quot; model proposed by both Duffie, and Hull-White, it is assumed that there is no risk free arbitrage. Duffie uses the LIBOR as the risk free rate, whereas Hull and White use US Treasuries as the risk free rate. Both analyses make simplifying assumptions (such as the assumption that there is zero cost of unwinding the fixed leg of the swap on default), which may invalidate the no-arbitrage assumption. However the Duffie approach is frequently used by the market to determine theoretical prices.

===Sensitivities===
Analogous to DV01 for a bond, CS01 - the credit spread dollar value of one basis point - reflects the change in market value of a CDS in response to a one basis point change in its swap premium. 
CS01 may also 
be defined as the change in value for a one basis point parallel shift in the credit spread curve.

&quot;CS01 Risk&quot;, in turn, refers to 

any unfavorable change in value, in response to changes in underlying credit spreads.

==Criticisms==
Critics of the huge credit default swap market have claimed that it has been allowed to become too large without proper regulation and that, because all contracts are privately negotiated, the market has no transparency. Furthermore, there have been claims that CDSs exacerbated the 2007–2008 financial crisis by hastening the demise of companies such as Lehman Brothers and AIG.

In the case of Lehman Brothers, it is claimed that the widening of the bank&#x27;s CDS spread reduced confidence in the bank and ultimately gave it further problems that it was not able to overcome. However, proponents of the CDS market argue that this confuses cause and effect; CDS spreads simply reflected the reality that the company was in serious trouble. Furthermore, they claim that the CDS market allowed investors who had counterparty risk with Lehman Brothers to reduce their exposure in the case of their default.

Credit default swaps have also faced criticism that they contributed to a breakdown in negotiations during the 2009 General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization, because certain bondholders might benefit from the credit event of a GM bankruptcy due to their holding of CDSs. Critics speculate that these creditors had an incentive to push for the company to enter bankruptcy protection. Due to a lack of transparency, there was no way to identify the protection buyers and protection writers.

It was also feared at the time of Lehman&#x27;s bankruptcy that the $400 billion notional of CDS protection which had been written on the bank could lead to a net payout of $366 billion from protection sellers to buyers (given the cash-settlement auction settled at a final price of 8.625%) and that these large payouts could lead to further bankruptcies of firms without enough cash to settle their contracts. However, industry estimates after the auction suggest that net cashflows were only in the region of $7 billion. because many parties held offsetting positions. Furthermore, CDS deals are marked-to-market frequently. This would have led to margin calls from buyers to sellers as Lehman&#x27;s CDS spread widened, reducing the net cashflows on the days after the auction.

Senior bankers have argued that not only did the CDS market function remarkably well during the 2007–2008 financial crisis; that CDS contracts have been acting to distribute risk just as was intended; and that it is not CDSs themselves that need further regulation but the parties who trade them.

Some general criticism of financial derivatives is also relevant to credit derivatives. Warren Buffett famously described derivatives bought speculatively as &quot;financial weapons of mass destruction.&quot; In Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s annual report to shareholders in 2002, he said, &quot;Unless derivatives contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their ultimate value also depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties to them. In the meantime, though, before a contract is settled, the counterparties record profits and losses—often huge in amount—in their current earnings statements without so much as a penny changing hands. The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen).&quot;

To hedge the counterparty risk of entering a CDS transaction, one practice is to buy CDS protection on one&#x27;s counterparty. The positions are marked-to-market daily and collateral pass from buyer to seller or vice versa to protect both parties against counterparty default, but money does not always change hands due to the offset of gains and losses by those who had both bought and sold protection. Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation, the clearinghouse for the majority of trades in the US over-the-counter market, stated in October 2008 that once offsetting trades were considered, only an estimated $6 billion would change hands on October 21, during the settlement of the CDS contracts issued on Lehman Brothers&#x27; debt, which amounted to somewhere between $150 and $360 billion.

Despite Buffett&#x27;s criticism on derivatives, in October 2008 Berkshire Hathaway revealed to regulators that it has entered into at least $4.85 billion in derivative transactions. Buffett stated in his 2008 letter to shareholders that Berkshire Hathaway has no counterparty risk in its derivative dealings because Berkshire require counterparties to make payments when contracts are initiated, so that Berkshire always holds the money. Berkshire Hathaway was a large owner of Moody&#x27;s stock during the period that it was one of two primary rating agencies for subprime CDOs, a form of mortgage security derivative dependent on the use of credit default swaps.

The monoline insurance companies got involved with writing credit default swaps on mortgage-backed CDOs. Some media reports have claimed this was a contributing factor to the downfall of some of the monolines. In 2009 one of the monolines, MBIA, sued Merrill Lynch, claiming that Merrill had misrepresented some of its CDOs to MBIA in order to persuade MBIA to write CDS protection for those CDOs.

===Systemic risk===
During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, counterparties became subject to a risk of default, amplified with the involvement of Lehman Brothers and AIG in a very large number of CDS transactions. This is an example of systemic risk, risk which threatens an entire market, and a number of commentators have argued that size and deregulation of the CDS market have increased this risk.

For example, imagine if a hypothetical mutual fund had bought some Washington Mutual corporate bonds in 2005 and decided to hedge their exposure by buying CDS protection from Lehman Brothers. After Lehman&#x27;s default, this protection was no longer active, and Washington Mutual&#x27;s sudden default only days later would have led to a massive loss on the bonds, a loss that should have been insured by the CDS. There was also fear that Lehman Brothers and AIG&#x27;s inability to pay out on CDS contracts would lead to the unraveling of complex interlinked chain of CDS transactions between financial institutions.

Chains of CDS transactions can arise from a practice known as &quot;netting&quot;. Here, company B may buy a CDS from company A with a certain annual &quot;premium&quot;, say 2%. If the condition of the reference company worsens, the risk premium rises, so company B can sell a CDS to company C with a premium of say, 5%, and pocket the 3% difference. However, if the reference company defaults, company B might not have the assets on hand to make good on the contract. It depends on its contract with company A to provide a large payout, which it then passes along to company C.

The problem lies if one of the companies in the chain fails, creating a &quot;domino effect&quot; of losses. For example, if company A fails, company B will default on its CDS contract to company C, possibly resulting in bankruptcy, and company C will potentially experience a large loss due to the failure to receive compensation for the bad debt it held from the reference company. Even worse, because CDS contracts are private, company C will not know that its fate is tied to company A; it is only doing business with company B.

As described above, the establishment of a central exchange or clearing house for CDS trades would help to solve the &quot;domino effect&quot; problem, since it would mean that all trades faced a central counterparty guaranteed by a consortium of dealers.

==Tax and accounting issues==
The U.S federal income tax treatment of CDS is uncertain (Nirenberg and Kopp 1997:1, Peaslee &amp; Nirenberg 2008-07-21:129 and Brandes 2008). Commentators have suggested that, depending on how they are drafted, they are either notional principal contracts or options for tax purposes,(Peaslee &amp; Nirenberg 2008-07-21:129). but this is not certain. There is a risk of having CDS recharacterized as different types of financial instruments because they resemble put options and credit guarantees. In particular, the degree of risk depends on the type of settlement (physical/cash and binary/FMV) and trigger (default only/any credit event) (Nirenberg &amp; Kopp 1997:8). And, as noted below, the appropriate treatment for Naked CDS may be entirely different.

If a CDS is a notional principal contract, pre-default periodic and nonperiodic payments on the swap are deductible and included in ordinary income. If a payment is a termination payment, or a payment received on a sale of the swap to a third party, however, its tax treatment is an open question. In 2004, the Internal Revenue Service announced that it was studying the characterization of CDS in response to taxpayer confusion. As the outcome of its study, the IRS issued proposed regulations in 2011 specifically classifying CDS as notional principal contracts, and thereby qualifying such termination and sale payments for favorable capital gains tax treatment. These proposed regulations, which are yet to be finalized, have already been subject to criticism at a public hearing held by the IRS in January 2012, as well as in the academic press, insofar as that classification would apply to Naked CDS.

The thrust of this criticism is that Naked CDS are indistinguishable from gambling wagers, and thus give rise in all instances to ordinary income, including to hedge fund managers on their so-called carried interests, and that the IRS exceeded its authority with the proposed regulations. This is evidenced by the fact that Congress confirmed that certain derivatives, including CDS, do constitute gambling when, in 2000, to allay industry fears that they were illegal gambling, it exempted them from &quot;any State or local law that prohibits or regulates gaming.&quot; While this decriminalized Naked CDS, it did not grant them relief under the federal gambling tax provisions.

The accounting treatment of CDS used for hedging may not parallel the economic effects and instead, increase volatility. For example, GAAP generally require that CDS be reported on a mark to market basis. In contrast, assets that are held for investment, such as a commercial loan or bonds, are reported at cost, unless a probable and significant loss is expected. Thus, hedging a commercial loan using a CDS can induce considerable volatility into the income statement and balance sheet as the CDS changes value over its life due to market conditions and due to the tendency for shorter dated CDS to sell at lower prices than longer dated CDS. One can try to account for the CDS as a hedge under FASB 133 but in practice that can prove very difficult unless the risky asset owned by the bank or corporation is exactly the same as the Reference Obligation used for the particular CDS that was bought.

==LCDS==
A new type of default swap is the &quot;loan only&quot; credit default swap (LCDS). This is conceptually very similar to a standard CDS, but unlike &quot;vanilla&quot; CDS, the underlying protection is sold on syndicated secured loans of the Reference Entity rather than the broader category of &quot;Bond or Loan&quot;. Also, as of May 22, 2007, for the most widely traded LCDS form, which governs North American single name and index trades, the default settlement method for LCDS shifted to auction settlement rather than physical settlement. The auction method is essentially the same that has been used in the various ISDA cash settlement auction protocols, but does not require parties to take any additional steps following a credit event (i.e., adherence to a protocol) to elect cash settlement. On October 23, 2007, the first ever LCDS auction was held for Movie Gallery.

Because LCDS trades are linked to secured obligations with much higher recovery values than the unsecured bond obligations that are typically assumed the cheapest to deliver in respect of vanilla CDS, LCDS spreads are generally much tighter than CDS trades on the same name.

== ISDA Definitions ==
During the rapid growth of the credit derivatives market the 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions were introduced to standardize the legal documentation of CDS. Subsequently, replaced with the 2003 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions, and later the 2014 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions, each definition update seeks to ensure the CDS payoffs closely mimic the economics of the underlying reference obligations (bonds).

<text>Johann Joachim Becher (; 6 May 1635 – October 1682) was a German physician, alchemist, precursor of chemistry, scholar, polymath and adventurer, best known for his development of the phlogiston theory of combustion, and his advancement of Austrian cameralism.

==Early life and education==
Becher was born in Speyer during the Thirty Years War. His father was a Lutheran minister and died when Becher was a child. At the age of thirteen Becher found himself responsible not only for his own support but also for that of his mother and two brothers. He learned and practiced several small handicrafts, devoted his nights to study of the most miscellaneous description and earned a pittance by teaching.

In 1654, at the age of nineteen, he published the &quot;Discurs von der Großmächtigen Philosophischen Universal-Artzney / von den Philosophis genannt Lapis Philosophorum Trismegistus&quot; (discourse about the almighty philosophical and universal medicine by the philosopher called Lapis Philosophorum Trismegistus) under the pseudonym &#x27;Solinus Salzthal of Regiomontus.&#x27; It was published in Latin in 1659 as &quot;Discursus Solini Saltztal Regiomontani De potentissima philosophorum medicina universali, lapis philosophorum trismegistus dicta&quot; (translated by Johannes Jacobus Heilmann) in vol. VI of the &quot;Theatrum Chemicum&quot;.

==Career==
In 1657, he was appointed professor of medicine at the University of Mainz and physician to the archbishop-elector. His &quot;Metallurgia&quot; was published in 1660; and the next year appeared his &quot;Character pro notitia linguarum universali&quot;, in which he gives 10,000 words for use as a universal language. In 1663, he published his &quot;Oedipum Chemicum&quot; and a book on animals, plants and minerals (&quot;Thier- Kräuter- und Bergbuch&quot;).

In 1666, he was made councillor of commerce () at Vienna, where he had gained the powerful support of the prime minister of Emperor Leopold I. Sent by the emperor on a mission to the Netherlands, he wrote there in ten days his &quot;Methodus Didactica&quot;, which was followed by the &quot;Regeln der Christlichen Bundesgenossenschaft&quot; and the &quot;Politischer Discurs von den eigentlichen Ursachen des Auf- und Abblühens der Städte, Länder und Republiken&quot;. In 1669, he published his &quot;Physica subterranea&quot;; the same year, he was engaged with the count of Hanau in a scheme to acquire Dutch colonization of Guiana from the Dutch West India Company.

Meanwhile, he had been appointed physician to the elector of Bavaria; but in 1670 he was again in Vienna advising on the establishment of a silk factory and propounding schemes for a great company to trade with the Low Countries and for a canal to unite the Rhine and Danube.

In 1678, he crossed to England. He travelled to Scotland where he visited the mines at the request of Prince Rupert. He afterwards travelled for the same purpose to Cornwall, and spent a year there. At the beginning of 1680, he presented a paper to the Royal Society in which he attempted to deprive Christiaan Huygens of the honour of applying the pendulum to the measurement of time. In 1682, he returned to London, where he wrote &quot;Närrische Weisheit und weise Narrheit&quot; (in which, according to Otto Mayr he made extensive references to temperature regulated furnaces), a book the &quot;Chymischer Glücks-Hafen, Oder Grosse Chymische Concordantz Und Collection, Von funffzehen hundert Chymischen Processen&quot; and died in October of the same year.

==Legacy==
===Austrian Cameralist===
Becher was the most original and influential theorist of Austrian cameralism. He sought to balance between the need to reinstate postwar levels of population and production both in the countryside and the towns. By leaning more seriously on trade and commerce, Austrian cameralism helped to transfer attention to the troubles of the monarchy&#x27;s urban economies. Ferdinand II had already taken some corrective steps before he died by attempting to ease the debts of the Bohemian towns and to put limits on some of the land-holding nobility&#x27;s commercial rights. Even though preceding Habsburgs had held the guilds responsible for their restrictiveness, wastefulness, and the poor value of the merchandise they created, Ferdinand II ramped up the pressure by extending rights to private artisans who usually then earned the fortification of powerful local leaders such as seigneurs, military commanders, churches, and universities. An edict by Leopold I in 1689 had granted the government the right to monitor and control the number of masters and cut down on the monopoly effect of guild operations. Even previous to this, Becher, who was against all forms of monopoly, surmised that a third of the Austrian lands’ 150,000 artisans were &quot;Schwarzarbeiter&quot; who were not in a guild.
Immediately after the Thirty Years’ War the Bohemian towns had petitioned Ferdinand to refine its own raw materials into more finished goods for export. Becher became the leading force in attempting this conversion. By 1666 he had inspired the creation of a Commerce Commission (Kommerzkollegium) in Vienna, as well as the reestablishment of the first postwar silk plantation on the Lower Austrian estates of Hofkammer President Sinzendorf. Becher then subsequently helped create a Kunst- und Werkhaus in which foreign masters trained non-guild artisans in the production of finished goods. By 1672 he had promoted the construction of a wool factory in Linz. Four years later he established a textile workhouse for vagabonds in the Boemian town of Tabor that eventually employed 186 spinners under his own directorship. 
Some of Becher’s projects met with limited success. In time Linz’s new wool factory even became one of the largest and most important in Europe. Yet most of the government initiatives ended in failure. The Commerce Commission was doomed by Sinzendorf’s corruption and indifference. The Tabor workhouse nearly collapsed after just five years owing to the lack of government funding, and was then destroyed two years later during the Turkish invasion. The Oriental Company was fatally handicapped by a combination of poor management, government export prohibitions against Turkey, the opposition of Ottoman (principally Greek) merchants, and ultimately by the outbreak of war. The Kunst- und Werkhaus also folded during the 1680s, partly because of the regime’s unwillingness to import a significant number of foreign, Protestant teachers and skilled workers.
===Chemist and alchemist===
William Cullen considered Becher as a chemist of first importance and &quot;Physica Subterranea&quot; as the most considerable of Bechers writings.

Bill Bryson, in his &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot;, notes:
Chemistry as an earnest and respectable science is often said to date from 1661, when Robert Boyle of Oxford published &quot;The Sceptical Chymist&quot; — the first work to distinguish between chemists and alchemists — but it was a slow and often erratic transition. Into the eighteenth century scholars could feel oddly comfortable in both camps — like the German Johann Becher, who produced sober and unexceptionable work on mineralogy called &quot;Physica Subterranea&quot;, but who also was certain that, given the right materials, he could make himself invisible.

<text>Vietnamese Americans () are Americans of Vietnamese ancestry. They constitute a major part of all overseas Vietnamese. As of 2023, over 2.3 million people of Vietnamese descent live in the United States, making them one of the largest Asian American ethnic groups. The majority (60%) are immigrants, while 40% were born in the United States.

The Vietnamese American population grew significantly after 1975, when a large wave of South Vietnamese refugees arrived in the U.S. following the end of the Vietnam War. Today, over half of Vietnamese-Americans reside in California and Texas, particularly in metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, Houston, and San Jose.

==History==

=== Early arrivals (pre-1975) ===
The history of Vietnamese Americans is relatively recent. Early arrivals included both laborers and elites. Among them was Ho Chi Minh, who later became a Vietnamese communist leader. He arrived in 1912 as a ship’s cook, although parts of his American experience may have been embellished.

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Office of Immigration Statistics, the earliest recorded instances of Vietnamese individuals obtaining lawful permanent resident (LPR) status in the United States occurred between 1951 and 1959, when 290 Vietnamese were granted residency. These numbers began to grow during the Vietnam War, with around 2,949 Vietnamese obtaining LPR status between 1960 and 1969. Between 1955 and 1974, about 18,000 immigrants from Vietnam were admitted to the U.S.

=== First wave of immigration: 1975 and the Fall of Saigon ===
The Fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, which marked the end of the Vietnam War, triggered the first major wave of Vietnamese immigration, as many with ties to the United States or the South Vietnam government feared reprisals from the communist regime. 

In the week leading up to the Fall of Saigon, between 10,000 and 15,000 people departed on scheduled flights, followed by an additional 80,000 who were evacuated by air. The final group was transported aboard U.S. Navy ships. Altogether, approximately 125,000 to 130,000 Vietnamese refugees were evacuated and resettled in the United States during the first wave.

After leaving Vietnam, the refugees first arrived at reception camps in the Philippines and Guam before being transferred to temporary housing at U.S. military bases, including Camp Pendleton (California), Fort Chaffee (Arkansas), Eglin Air Force Base (Florida), and Fort Indiantown Gap (Pennsylvania). Following resettlement preparations, they were assigned to voluntary agencies (VOLAGs), which provided assistance in securing financial and personal support from sponsors in the U.S.

Most first-wave refugees were better educated, wealthier, and more proficient in English than those in subsequent waves. According to 1975 U.S. State Department data, over 30% of first-wave household heads were medical professionals or technical managers, 16.9% worked in transportation, and 11.7% held clerical or sales jobs in Vietnam. Less than 5% were fishermen or farmers.

The resettlement of South Vietnamese refugees in the U.S. initially faced mixed reception, fueled by fears of job competition, welfare strain, and cultural concerns. According to a 1975 Gallup poll, only 36% of Americans approved of the resettlement, while 54% disapproved. 

Despite initial public reluctance, President Gerald Ford emphasized a &quot;profound moral obligation&quot; to assist the refugees, calling it a &quot;great human tragedy.&quot; In response, Congress passed the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975, providing special entry status and $455 million in resettlement aid.

To prevent the refugees from forming ethnic enclaves and minimize impact on local communities, they were initially dispersed across the country. However, within a few years, many relocated to California and Texas.

=== Second wave of immigration: &quot;boat people&quot; (1978–1980s) ===

Between 1978 to the mid-1980s, a second major wave of refugees from former South Vietnam fled, primarily by sea on fishing boats, becoming known as &quot;boat people.&quot; This group represented a diverse range of backgrounds, including South Vietnamese elites, former South Vietnam military and government officials, Chinese minorities, religious minorities, farmers, fishermen, and merchants.

Many fled persecution following the fall of Saigon, where many South Vietnamese, particularly former South Vietnamese military officers and government employees, were detained in re-education camps for political indoctrination, forced labor, and torture. A significant number of boat people included ethnic Chinese, Hmong, and other minority groups, many of whom were Vietnamese citizens. Notably, ethic Chinese were specifically targeted for expulsion and accounted for 50% to 80% of the over 50,000 monthly refugee arrivals at Southeast Asian camps in 1979.

The boat people were often rescued up by foreign ships and transported to asylum camps in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia such as Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines. From these camps, many were resettled in countries that agreed to accept them, including the United States, Canada, Australia, France, and others.

Between 1975 and 1979, limitations in existing refugee admission laws required U.S. presidential actions to admit approximately 300,000 Southeast Asian refugees, including many from Vietnam. In response to the plight of Vietnamese boat people, Congress passed the Refugee Act of 1980 to ease restrictions on refugee admissions.

In 1979, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) established the Orderly Departure Program (ODP) to facilitate legal emigration from Vietnam to the U.S. and other countries. The ODP initially succeeded in relocating an average of 16,500 individuals annually—over 115,000 people by 1986, including 50,000 to the United States. However, progress eventually stalled due to disagreements over priorities, as the U.S. focused on specific groups such as Amerasian children and re-education camp prisoners, while Vietnam prioritized the exodus of ethnic Chinese.

==== Vietnamese Fishermen&#x27;s Association Antitrust Suit ====
Vietnamese refugees in the Gulf Coast faced discrimination as they arrived throughout the 1970s and 1980s. White fishermen complained about unfair competition from their Vietnamese American counterparts. &quot;Non-Vietnamese docks refused to allow Vietnamese American boats to dock, [and] wholesalers refused to buy shrimp from Vietnamese Americans.&quot; The Ku Klux Klan attempted to intimidate Vietnamese American shrimp fishermen, at one time having plans to burn Vietnamese shrimp boats. The Vietnamese Fishermen&#x27;s Association, with the aid of the Southern Poverty Law Center, won a 1981 antitrust suit against the Klan, disbanding the &quot;private army of white supremacists.&quot;

=== Shifts in Vietnamese immigration pathways (post-1980s) ===
While Vietnamese immigration has remained relatively steady since the 1980s, the pathways for Vietnamese immigrants to obtain lawful permanent resident (LPR) status have changed dramatically. 

Prior to 1998, the majority of Vietnamese green card holders were granted LPR status on humanitarian grounds, such as through refugee or asylum programs. In 1982, for example, 99% of Vietnamese immigrants received green cards via these channels. 

By 2022, this figure had fallen to less than 1%, or fewer than 100 Vietnamese. Instead, the majority of Vietnamese immigrants (87%) gained green cards through family reunification, a rate much higher than the overall figure of 58%. About 12% secured LPR status via employment sponsorship.

==Demographics==
=== Population and distribution ===
As of 2023, nearly 2.4 million Vietnamese Americans lived in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, with approximately 60% being immigrants (&quot;foreign-born&quot;) and 40% born in the U.S.

Vietnamese Americans have the highest naturalization rate among all immigrant groups. By 2023, 78% of eligible Vietnamese immigrants in the United States had become U.S. citizens, surpassing the 53% naturalization rate of the overall foreign-born population. In fiscal year 2024, Vietnam ranked among the top five countries of origin for new U.S. citizens, accounting for 4.1% of all naturalizations. 

Geographically, Vietnamese Americans are predominantly concentrated in California (38%), Texas (14%), and Washington State (5%). Florida, Virginia, Georgia, and Massachusetts each accounted for about 3% to 4% of the Vietnamese American population. Major hubs include Orange, Santa Clara, and Los Angeles counties in California, and Harris County in Texas, together making up 31% of Vietnamese immigrants in the U.S. 

The largest and oldest Vietnamese-American enclave in the United States, Little Saigon, is located in Westminster and Garden Grove. According to the 2023 United States Census American Community Survey (ACS), Vietnamese Americans account for 43.8% and 32.6% of the population, respectively.

=== Socioeconomics ===

==== Education ====
Coming from different waves of immigration, Vietnamese Americans have a lower educational attainment than overall Asian American population but it is higher than other Southeast Asian groups and is also trending upward, with each generation more likely to attain higher degrees and/or qualifications overall than the generation prior.

As of 2019, 32% of Vietnamese Americans held a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, compared to 54% of Asian Americans overall and 33% of the total U.S. population. Educational attainment varies notably between U.S.-born and foreign-born Vietnamese Americans. Among those born in the U.S., 55% have earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, while 27% of those born abroad have achieved the same level of education.

==== Income ====

In 2023, Vietnamese Americans had a median household income of $88,467, which was 9.7% higher than the national median of $80,610. 

As of 2022, around 11% Vietnamese Americans lived below the poverty line, a rate similar to the 11.5% rate for the general U.S. population. This poverty rate has shown a gradual decline over recent years. In 2015, about 14.3% of Vietnamese Americans were living in poverty, which decreased to 12% by 2019.

==== Employment ====
In 2023, the employment rate for Vietnamese Americans was 61.4%, surpassing the overall U.S. employment rate of 60.3% during the same period. The unemployment rate was 2.8%, notably lower than the national average of 3.6%.
Vietnamese Americans work in a wide array of occupations, with employment distributed as follows:

* Management, business, science, and arts: 36%
* Services: 30%
* Sales and office: 13%
* Natural resources, construction, and maintenance: 4%
* Production, transportation, and material moving: 17%

== Culture ==

=== Language ===

According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey, approximately 1.5 million people aged five and older speak Vietnamese at home, making it the fifth most commonly spoken language in the U.S., after English, Spanish, Chinese, and Tagalog.

Additionally, the survey indicates that 57% of Vietnamese speakers reported speaking English &quot;less than very well.&quot; This percentage is higher than that of Spanish (39%) and Tagalog (30%) speakers, and comparable to Chinese speakers (52%).

English proficiency varies significantly between U.S.-born and foreign-born Vietnamese Americans. While 90% of U.S.-born Vietnamese Americans are fluent in English, only 35% of the foreign-born counterparts report the same level of proficiency.

==== Linguistic differences ====
English relies on tonal inflection sparingly, primarily to convey questions, whereas Vietnamese is a tonal language in which the tone of a word determines its meaning. For example, the syllable &quot;ma&quot; can have different meanings depending on its tone, as marked by diacritics:

* &quot;ma&quot;: &quot;ghost&quot;
* &quot;mà&quot;: &quot;but&quot;
* &quot;mã&quot;: &quot;code&quot;
* &quot;mạ&quot;: &quot;rice plant&quot;
* &quot;má&quot;: &quot;cheek&quot;
* &quot;mả&quot;: &quot;tomb&quot;

Another key difference between Vietnamese and English is the extensive use of relationship-specific pronouns in Vietnamese. English employs &quot;you&quot; as a universal second-person singular pronoun, regardless of age, gender, or relationship. In contrast, Vietnamese employs different pronouns depending on factors like the person&#x27;s age, gender (&quot;anh&quot; or &quot;chị&quot;), and relationship (&quot;bạn&quot;, &quot;cậu&quot;, or &quot;mày&quot;).

=== Religion ===
According to the Pew Research Center, 37% of Vietnamese Americans identify as Buddhist, 36% as Christian, and 23% have no religious affiliation, while smaller proportions adhere to other faiths (2%), identify as Muslim (&lt;1%), or did not provide an answer (3%). 

In 2024, Vietnamese Americans are more likely to identify as Christian compared to those in Vietnam. While Christians, primarily Roman Catholics, make up about 10% of Vietnam&#x27;s population, they make up approximately 36% of the Vietnamese American population. Due to hostility between Communists and Catholics in Vietnam, many Catholics fled the country after the Communist takeover, and many Catholic Churches had sponsored them to America. 

Many practice Mahayana Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism and animist practices (including ancestor veneration) influenced by Chinese folk religion. Vietnamese are a major ethnic group notable among Asian American Catholics. Hòa Hảo and Caodaism are two of the other religions of Vietnamese Americans.

There are 150 to 165 Vietnamese Buddhist temples in the United States, with most observing a mixture of Pure Land (Tịnh Độ Tông) and Zen (Thiền) doctrines and practices. Most temples are small, consisting of a converted house with one or two resident monks or nuns. Two of the most prominent figures in Vietnamese American Buddhism are Thich Thien-An and Thich Nhat Hanh. There are also Theravada-based Vietnamese temples like Chua Buu Mon in Port Arthur, Texas.

=== Cuisine ===

Vietnamese immigration to the United States post-Vietnam War (1975) profoundly influenced American cuisine. Vietnamese Americans opened restaurants to preserve traditions and support families, introducing iconic dishes like &quot;phở&quot;, &quot;bánh mì&quot;, and &quot;gỏi cuốn,&quot; which have since become widely popular and embraced across the country.

Alongside traditional dishes, Vietnamese Americans have introduced notable fusion creations. Garlic noodles, introduced in the 1970s, blend Vietnamese flavors with Italian pasta. Huy Fong sriracha sauce, created in 1980 by a Vietnamese refugee, was originally made for the Vietnamese and other Asian immigrant communities but has since gained nationwide popularity, becoming a staple in U.S. kitchens.

Viet-Cajun cuisine is another prominent example of fusion, which has flourished in Gulf Coast regions like Louisiana and Texas. Vietnamese Americans in these areas integrated Vietnamese and Cajun culinary elements, creating dishes such as crawfish boils infused with lemongrass, garlic, and other Vietnamese seasonings.

=== Festivals and celebrations ===
Vietnamese Americans continue to celebrate Vietnamese lunar calendar holidays, with &quot;Tết&quot; (Vietnamese New Year) being the most significant. Festivities include activities like &quot;bầu cua tôm cá&quot; (dice games), &quot;múa lân&quot; (lion dances), the exchange of &quot;lì xì&quot; (red envelopes), and sharing festive meals featuring dishes such as &quot;bánh chưng, bánh tét,&quot; and &quot;mứt&quot; (candied fruit).

In recent years, Lunar New Year, which includes &quot;Tết&quot;, has gained recognition in the U.S. California (2022), Colorado (2023), and Washington State (2024) have officially designated it as a state holiday, while New York declared it a school holiday in 2023.

, or the Mid-Autumn Festival, is also widely celebrated by Vietnamese Americans. Much like &quot;Tết&quot;, cities with sizable Vietnamese communities often organize large-scale &quot;Tết Trung Thu&quot; festivities that include lion dances, traditional performances, and community-centered activities. The festival is known for its iconic mooncakes and colorful lanterns.

== Politics ==

=== Political preferences and generational differences ===
Vietnamese Americans, shaped by a history of fleeing communism as refugees, tend to lean Republican (51%) more than any other Asian American group. However, younger Vietnamese Americans are increasingly shifting toward the Democratic Party. Among voters aged 50 and older, 68% identified with or leaned Republican, while 58% of younger voters identified with or leaned Democratic. 

Many older, first-generation Vietnamese American refugees who fled communist rule after the Vietnam War exhibit strong patriotism toward the United States, support for the military, and anti-communist views that often align with the Republican Party. The party&#x27;s vocal anti-communism appealed to those who resettled during the Reagan administration and has continued to resonate with many since 2016, particularly due to Donald Trump&#x27;s anti-China rhetoric. This support persists despite Trump’s plans to deport some Vietnamese refugees. 

According to the 2008 National Asian American Survey, 22 percent identified with the Democratic Party and 29 percent with the Republican Party. Exit polls during the 2004 presidential election indicated that 72 percent of Vietnamese American voters in eight eastern states polled voted for Republican incumbent George W. Bush, compared to the 28 percent voting for Democratic challenger John Kerry. In a poll conducted before the 2008 presidential election, two-thirds of Vietnamese Americans who had decided said that they would vote for Republican candidate John McCain. 

In contrast, younger Vietnamese Americans lean Democratic, marking a generational shift from the Republican preferences of older immigrants who fled communism. The younger generation&#x27;s political preferences are shaped by exposure to diverse viewpoints, including those on economic policy, healthcare, and social justice, which encourage a shift toward progressive values. 

Polling data underscores this generational divide. A survey by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) revealed that Vietnamese Americans aged 18–29 favored Democrat Barack Obama by 60 percentage points during the 2008 presidential election. According to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, 47% of registered Vietnamese American voters leaned Republican and 32% Democratic. Among Vietnamese Americans overall (including non-registered voters), 36% leaned Democratic and 35% Republican.

==== January 6 United States Capitol attack ====
Several Vietnamese Americans took part in the January 6 United States Capitol attack, with some reportedly waving the South Vietnamese flag and marching alongside neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups. Of the seven Asian individuals charged in connection with the event, five were of Vietnamese descent.

The flag&#x27;s display during the Capitol riot disappointed many Vietnamese Americans, particularly younger generations, who denounced its association &quot;with hate, with racism, with supremacy.&quot; They argued that &quot;the ideas of authoritarianism, of overturning the people&#x27;s will, are not the principles that this flag stands for,&quot; and expressed feeling embarrassed by the incident, saying it made them &quot;looked like clowns.&quot; The event also prompted many young people to question &quot;their elders&#x27; unyielding loyalty to and interpretation of the banner&#x27;s values.&quot;

Amid this controversy, Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy, the first Vietnamese American woman elected to Congress, served on the January 6th Committee, where she co-led a public hearing and contributed to the investigation of the attack on the U.S. Capitol.

=== Notable Vietnamese American politicians ===

* Joseph Cao: Elected in 2008 as a Republican to represent Louisiana’s 2nd congressional district, Cao served one term in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2009 to 2011, becoming the first Vietnamese American to hold this position.
* Stephanie Murphy: Elected in 2016 as a Democrat to represent Florida’s 7th congressional district, Murphy served three terms in Congress from 2017 to 2023, becoming the first Vietnamese American woman and first Vietnamese American Democrat to hold this position. During her tenure, she also served on the January 6th Committee, which investigated the attack on the U.S. Capitol.
* Derek Tran: Elected in 2024 as a Democrat to represent California&#x27;s 45th congressional district, Tran began serving in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2025, becoming the first Vietnamese American to represent California in Congress.

==Activism==

=== Opposition to communism ===
According to a 1995 study, the relationship between Vietnam and the United States has been the most important issue for most Vietnamese Americans. As many are refugees from South Vietnam, many are strongly opposed to communism; this attitude could also take root during and after the Indochina Wars, injustice in reeducation camps as well as other issues with the communist government. In a 2000 &quot;Orange County Register&quot; poll, 71 percent of respondents ranked fighting communism as a &quot;top priority&quot; or &quot;very important.&quot; Vietnamese Americans stage protests against the Vietnamese government&#x27;s policies. 

In 1999, opposition to a video-store owner in Westminster, California who displayed the flag of Vietnam and a photo of Ho Chi Minh peaked when 15,000 people held a nighttime vigil in front of the store; this raised free speech issues. Although few Vietnamese Americans enrolled in the Democratic Party because it was seen as more sympathetic to communism than the Republican Party, Republican support has eroded in the second generation and among newer, poorer refugees. However, the Republican Party still has strong support; in 2007, in Orange County, Vietnamese Americans registered as Republicans outnumbered registered Democrats (55 and 22 percent, respectively).

=== Advocacy for the South Vietnamese flag ===
The flag of South Vietnam, also known as the Vietnamese Heritage and Freedom Flag, carries significant cultural and historical significance for Vietnamese Americans in the United States, particularly among refugees impacted by the Vietnam War. It serves as a &quot;potent symbol of struggle and pride for Vietnamese Americans.&quot; Community leaders describe it embodying &quot;the longing for one’s lost homeland that is felt by so many Vietnamese in the diaspora.&quot;

Over the years, the Vietnamese have poured a great deal of resources into getting recognition for the flag across the U.S. By 2023, resolutions recognizing the South Vietnamese flag as the Vietnamese Heritage and Freedom Flag had been adopted by 20 states, 15 counties, and 85 cities.

=== Community activism post-Hurricane Katrina ===
During the months following Hurricane Katrina, the Vietnamese American community in New Orleans (among the first to return to the city) rallied against a landfill used to dump debris near their community. After months of legal wrangling, the landfill was closed.

=== Support for Hong Kong protests ===
Since the onset of Hong Kong protests in June 2019, Vietnamese Americans have been the most active Asian Americans rallying in favor of the pro-democracy (pro-Labor Union) Hongkongers, organizing vocal marches in California, where their largest community exists. They clashed with pro-communist Mainland Chinese immigrants. Trúc Hồ, a famed Vietnamese American singer, wrote a song in July 2019 to praise the Hong Kong protesters. The song went viral among Vietnamese and Hong Kong citizens.

==Ethnic subgroups==
Although census data counts those who identify as ethnically Vietnamese, how Vietnamese ethnic groups view themselves may affect that reporting.

===Hoa===
The Hoa people are Han Chinese who migrated to Vietnam. In 2013, they made up 11.5 percent of the Vietnamese American population, and in majority, identified itself as Vietnamese. Some Hoa Vietnamese Americans also speak a dialect of Yue Chinese, generally code-switching between Cantonese and Vietnamese to speak to both Hoa immigrants from Vietnam and ethnic Vietnamese. Teochew, a variety of Southern Min which had virtually no speakers in the US before the 1980s, is spoken by another group of Hoa immigrants. A small number of Vietnamese Americans may also speak Mandarin as a third (or fourth) language in business and other interaction.

===Eurasians and Amerasians===
Some Vietnamese Americans are Eurasians: people of European and Asian descent. They are descendants of ethnic Vietnamese and French settlers and soldiers (and sometimes Hoa) during the French colonial period (1883–1945) or the First Indochina War (1946–1954).

Amerasians are descendants of an ethnic Vietnamese (or Hoa) parent and an American parent, most commonly white or black. The first substantial generation of Amerasian Vietnamese Americans were born to American personnel, primarily military men, during the Vietnam War from 1961 to 1975. Many Amerasians were ignored by their American parent; in Vietnam, the fatherless children of foreign men were called &quot;con lai&quot; (&quot;mixed race&quot;) or the pejorative &quot;bụi đời&quot; (&quot;dust of life&quot;). Since 1982, Amerasians and their families have come to the United States under the Orderly Departure Program. Many could not be reunited with their fathers, and commonly arrived with their mothers. In some cases, they were part of false families that were created to escape from Vietnam. Many of the first-generation Amerasians and their mothers experienced significant social and institutional discrimination in Vietnam, where they were denied the right to education; discrimination worsening after the 1973 American withdrawal, and by the U.S. government, which discouraged American military personnel from marrying Vietnamese nationals and frequently refused claims of U.S. citizenship that were lodged by Amerasians born in Vietnam if their mothers were not married to their American fathers.

Discrimination was even greater for children of black servicemen than for children of white fathers. Subsequent generations of Amerasians (children born in the United States) and Vietnamese-born Amerasians whose American paternity was documented by their parents&#x27; marriage or their subsequent legitimization have had an arguably more favorable outlook.

The 1988 American Homecoming Act helped over 25,000 Amerasians and their 67,000 relatives in Vietnam, to emigrate to the United States. Although they received permanent-resident status, many have been unable to obtain citizenship and express a lack of belonging or acceptance in the US because of differences in culture, language and citizenship status.

===Ethnic Tai-Lao===
The Thái peoples, including the Laotians, Nungs and other Tai ethnicities who migrated to the United States were majority from Northern Vietnam. The community, overall, do not develop a separate ethnic identity sentiment due to long friendly relations with the Vietnamese rulers, thus the community don&#x27;t regard itself Thai Americans or Laotian Americans, and see itself part of Vietnamese American diaspora.

===Cham===
Cham are an ethnic minority of Vietnam and Cambodia, and a small number of them came to the United States as refugees fleeing the Cambodian genocide. The main Cham populations in the United States are located in Orange County, California, Portland, and Seattle.

<doc id="316737" wikidata="Q558378" url="?curid=316737" title="Autoignition temperature">
<text>The autoignition temperature or self-ignition temperature, often called spontaneous ignition temperature or minimum ignition temperature (or shortly ignition temperature) and formerly also known as kindling point, of a substance is the lowest temperature at which it spontaneously ignites in a normal atmosphere without an external source of ignition, such as a flame or spark. This temperature is required to supply the activation energy needed for combustion. The temperature at which a chemical ignites decreases as the pressure is decreased. 

*Substances which spontaneously ignite in a normal atmosphere at naturally ambient temperatures are termed pyrophoric.

Autoignition temperatures of liquid chemicals are typically measured using a flask placed in a temperature-controlled oven in accordance with the procedure described in ASTM E659.

When measured for plastics, autoignition temperature can also be measured under elevated pressure and at 100% oxygen concentration. The resulting value is used as a predictor of viability for high-oxygen service. The main testing standard for this is ASTM G72.

==Autoignition time equation==
The time formula_1 it takes for a material to reach its autoignition temperature formula_2 when exposed to a heat flux formula_3 is given by the following equation:

:formula_4

where &quot;k&quot; = thermal conductivity, &quot;ρ&quot; = density, and &quot;c&quot; = specific heat capacity of the material of interest, formula_5 is the initial temperature of the material (or the temperature of the bulk material).

==Autoignition temperature of selected substances==
Temperatures vary widely in the literature and should only be used as estimates. Factors that may cause variation include partial pressure of oxygen, altitude, humidity, and amount of time required for ignition. Generally the autoignition temperature for hydrocarbon/air mixtures decreases with increasing molecular mass and increasing chain length. The autoignition temperature is also higher for branched-chain hydrocarbons than for straight-chain hydrocarbons.

<doc id="316745" wikidata="Q7239513" url="?curid=316745" title="Precising definition">
<text>A precising definition is a definition that contracts or reduces the scope of the lexical definition of a term for a specific purpose by including additional criteria that narrow down the set of things meeting the definition.

For example, a dictionary may define the term &quot;student&quot; as &quot;1. anyone attending an educational institution of any type, or 2. anyone who studies something.&quot; However, a movie theater may propose a &quot;precising definition&quot; for the word &quot;student&quot; of &quot;any person under the age of 18 enrolled in a local school&quot; in order to determine who is eligible to receive discounted tickets.

Precising definitions are generally used in contexts where vagueness is unacceptable; many legal definitions are precising definitions, as are company policies. This type of definition is useful in preventing disputes that arise from the involved parties using different definitions of the term in question.

A precising definition is intended to make a vague word more precise so that the word&#x27;s meaning is not left to the interpretation of the reader or listener. Here is an example:

&quot;From a class syllabus:&quot; &quot;Class participation&quot; means attending class, listening attentively, answering and asking questions, and participating in class discussions.

This is similar to a stipulative definition, but differs in that a stipulative definition may contradict the lexical definition, while a precising definition does not.

#Defence of the land area of the realm
#Support of civilian authorities
#International military crisis management operations

In addition to these tasks, the Army is responsible for conscription and personnel management of reserve.

Because Finland is not under direct military threat, the current Army is, as it has been since the end of Second World War, in peacetime training formation. This means that its brigades () are not meant to be operational combat units but training formations. According to the &quot;troop production&quot; doctrine (), peacetime units will train each batch of conscripts they receive for a specific wartime unit. After the end of training, the conscripts are demobilised into reserve. During regular refresher exercises and in case of a crisis, the reserve unit will be activated and deployed in the formation it trained in during conscription. Thus, the peacetime structure of the Army does not give any meaningful information about the mobilised structure or about the areas where the units would be used.

==History==

Between 1809 and 1917 Finland was an autonomous state ruled by the Russian Empire as the Grand Duchy of Finland. Between 1881 and 1901 the Grand Duchy had its own army. Before that several other military units had also been formed while Finland belonged to Sweden.

The Grand Duchy inherited its allotment system (; ) from the Swedish military organization. However, for several decades, Russian rulers did not require military service from Finland; operations and defence were mostly taken care by Russian troops based in the Grand Duchy. As a result, officer benefits of the allotment system became practically pensions, as payment was based on passive availability, not on actual service.

During the Napoleonic Wars three 1200-man regiments were formed in Finland and Topographic Corps in Hamina. In 1821 the Topographic Corps was transformed into the cadet officers school. In 1829 one of the training battalions was transformed into the Young Guard Battalion, the Finnish Guards. 

During the Crimean War, 1854, Finland set up nine sharpshooter battalions based on a rota system. Conscription was introduced in Finland in 1878. The Finnish Guard took part in fighting to suppress the 1830 November Uprising in Poland and participated in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), after which it gained the status of Old Guard of the Russian Emperor.

The Finnish army was gradually broken up during the &quot;oppression years&quot; just after the turn of the century. As Finnish conscripts refused to serve in the Russian Imperial Army, conscription ended in Finland and it was replaced with a tax paid from the Finnish Senate to the Imperial treasury.

At the end of the 19th century the Russian empire was weakening, and this was reflected in a reduced capacity of the Russian troops to keep public order. Voluntary defence organizations disguised as fire brigades were formed by the Finnish people, especially during the strikes during and after the Russo-Japanese War.

There were socialist Red Guards and conservative, anti-socialist Protection Guards (or White Guards). Also, during the First World War activists secretly travelled to Germany to receive military training and to be trained as Jäger troops (&quot;,&quot; ).

After independence and the beginning of the Finnish Civil War the White government declared the White Guards as government troops, and the war was fought between the Red Guards, assisted by Communist Russians, and White Guards added with the Jägers and assisted by the German Empire.

After the war in 1919, the Protection Guards became a separate organization. Therefore, strictly speaking, there is no continuity between the White Guards, which became a voluntary organization, and the Finnish army, which was a cadre army based on conscription. However, Jägers gained important positions in the army, and German tactics and military principles were adopted.

===Winter War===
The Finnish Army consisted of 9 field divisions, 4 brigades and a number of small independent battalions and companies at the beginning of the Winter War in 1939. The Army was organised into three corps. The II and III Corps were organised into the Army of the Isthmus which was located on the Karelian Isthmus, the likely location for the main Soviet attack. The IV Corps defended the area north of Lake Ladoga. The defence of the rest of the border up to Petsamo by the Arctic Ocean was given to the North Finland Group which consisted of a handful of independent battalions.

In order to organize replacements for the units a Field Replacement Brigade (, KT-Pr) of nine battalions was formed. But due to the severity of the Soviet attack the battalions had to be used as combat troops. Also three Replacement Divisions or Home Replacement Divisions (1.Koti.TD – 3.Koti.TD) were formed from the available reservists. As the situation became more alarming the 1st and 3rd Replacement Divisions were reformed into the 21st and 23rd Divisions and sent to the front on 19 December. The 2nd Replacement Division was deployed as individual regiments to Northern Finland.

Finland ceded 9% of its territory via the Moscow Peace Treaty, but prevented the Soviets from annexing the whole country.

===Order of battle===

===Army of the Isthmus===
*Army of the Isthmus (, KannA) (Commander: Lieutenant General Hugo Österman) located on the Karelian Isthmus.
** II Corps (II AK) (Commander: Lieutenant General Harald Öhquist)
*** 4th Division
*** 5th Division
*** 11th Division
** III Corps (III AK) (Commander: Major General Erik Heinrichs)
*** 8th Division
*** 10th Division
** Reserve
*** 1st Division

Four delaying groups, named for their location, were stationed immediately by the border on the isthmus.

====Independent formations====
* IV Corps (IV AK) (Commander: Major General Juho Heiskanen and then Major General Woldemar Hägglund from 4 December 1939) located in the Ladoga Karelia.
** 12th Division
** 13th Division
* North Finland Group () (Commander: Major General Wiljo Tuompo)
** Lapland Group () in Salla and Petsamo
** North Karelian Group () in North Karelia

====Reserves of C-in-C====
* 6th Division (Southern Finland)
* 9th Division (Northern Finland)
* Field Replacement Brigade (KT-Pr)

===Continuation War===

The Army of Karelia was formed on 29 June 1941 soon after the start of the Continuation War. There were seven Finnish corps in the field during the war: the I, II, III, IV, V, VI and VII. During the war the Finnish Army was responsible for the front from the Gulf of Finland to Kainuu. The front in Northern Finland was the responsibility of the German AOK Norwegen. During summer and autumn 1941, the Finnish Army re-conquered the areas lost to the Soviet Union in the Winter War and pushed deep into Soviet territory in Eastern Karelia. In winter 1942, the Finnish political leadership ended offensive action and the front stagnated for over two years.

The relatively inactive period of stationary war ended abruptly in June 1944, as the Soviet Union started its Fourth Strategic Offensive. As a result, the Finnish Army lost large areas of the Karelian Isthmus, most importantly Viipuri, a major city, and was forced to retreat from Eastern Karelia. However, in the decisive Battle of Tali-Ihantala, the Soviet advance was halted. The Soviet Union concentrated its forces on the battles in Central Europe, and Finland made a separate peace in September 1944.

===Lapland War===
The Lapland War () was the hostilities between Finland and Nazi Germany between September 1944 and April 1945, fought in Finland&#x27;s northernmost Lapland Province. While the Finns saw this as a separate conflict much like the Continuation War, German forces considered their actions to be part of the Second World War. A peculiarity of the war was that the Finnish army was forced to demobilise their forces while at the same time fighting to force the German army to leave Finland. The German forces retreated to Norway, and Finland was, therefore, able to uphold its armistice promise to the Soviet Union.

=== Cold War ===
During the Cold War, Finland was neutral but maintained close ties to the Soviet Union. The Finnish Army was in a difficult situation as it bordered the Soviet Union. Porkkala was a Soviet naval base taken from Finland in 1944. Construction for it finished in 1945 and became a naval base. It was handed back to Finland in 1956, for Kaliningrad had become a better place for the Soviet Navy.

==Organisation==

The Army is organised into eight Peacetime brigades. Two of these brigades, the Army Academy and the Utti Jaeger Regiment do not have subordinate regional offices. The six other brigades have one or more subordinate regional offices and a deputy commander. During a crisis, the regional offices form provincial local battalions and the brigade headquarters form the regional command level. During normal operation, the regional offices are responsible for conscription, organising voluntary national defence work and planning crisis-time activities.

The brigades are:
* Armoured Brigade, Parola and Riihimäki
* Army Academy, Lappeenranta and Hamina 
* Guard Jaeger Regiment, Helsinki
* Jaeger Brigade, Sodankylä and Rovaniemi
* Kainuu Brigade, Kajaani
* Karelia Brigade, Valkeala
* Pori Brigade, Säkylä and Niinisalo
* Utti Jaeger Regiment, Utti

Army logistics is part of the joint Finnish Defence Forces Logistics Command.

During war time the army is organised operative forces which consists of approximately 61 000 men and territorial forces which consist of 176 000 men.

*1 helicopter battalion
*1 special jaeger battalion
*1 anti-aircraft missile and anti-aircraft unit
Territorial forces:

<doc id="316759" wikidata="Q1433936" url="?curid=316759" title="Hyperprolactinaemia">
<text>Hyperprolactinaemia (also spelled hyperprolactinemia) is a condition characterized by abnormally high levels of prolactin in the blood. In women, normal prolactin levels average to about 13 ng/mL, while in men, they average 5 ng/mL. The upper normal limit of serum prolactin is typically between 15 and 25 ng/mL for both genders. Levels exceeding this range indicate hyperprolactinemia.

Prolactin (PRL) is a peptide hormone produced by lactotroph cells in the anterior pituitary gland. It plays a vital role in lactation and breast development. Hyperprolactinemia, characterized by abnormally high levels of prolactin, may cause galactorrhea (production and spontaneous flow of breast milk), infertility, and menstrual disruptions in women. In men, it can lead to hypogonadism, infertility and erectile dysfunction.

Prolactin is crucial for milk production during pregnancy and lactation. Together with estrogen, progesterone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and hormones from the placenta, prolactin stimulates the proliferation of breast alveolar elements during pregnancy. However, lactation is inhibited during pregnancy due to elevated estrogen levels. After childbirth, the rapid decline in estrogen and progesterone levels allows lactation to begin.

Unlike most tropic hormones released by the anterior pituitary gland, prolactin secretion is primarily regulated by hypothalamic inhibition rather than by negative feedback from peripheral hormones. Prolactin also self-regulates through a counter-current flow in the hypophyseal pituitary portal system, which triggers the release of hypothalamic dopamine. This process also inhibits the pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), thereby negatively influencing the secretion of pituitary hormones that regulate gonadal function.

Estrogen promotes the growth of pituitary lactotroph cells, particularly during pregnancy. However, lactation is hindered by the elevated levels of estrogen and progesterone during this period. The rapid decline in estrogen and progesterone after childbirth enables lactation to begin. While breastfeeding, prolactin suppresses gonadotropin secretion, potentially delaying ovulation. Ovulation may resume before the return of menstruation during this time. Although hyperprolactinemia can result from normal physiological changes during pregnancy and breastfeeding, it can also be caused by other etiologies. For example, high prolactin levels could result from diseases affecting the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Other organs, such as the liver and kidneys, could affect prolactin clearance and consequently, prolactin levels in the serum. The disruption of prolactin regulation could also be attributed to external sources such as medications.

In the general population, the prevalence of hyperprolactinemia is 0.4%. The prevalence increases to as high as 17% in women with reproductive diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome. In cases of tumor-related hyperprolactinemia, prolactinoma is the most common culprit of consistently high levels of prolactin as well as the most common type of pituitary tumor. For non-tumor related hyperprolactinemia, the most common cause is medication-induced prolactin secretion. Particularly, antipsychotics have been linked to a majority of non-tumor related hyperprolactinemia cases due to their prolactin-rising and prolactin-sparing mechanisms. Typical antipsychotics have been shown to induce significant, dose-dependent increases in prolactin levels up to 10-fold the normal limit. Atypical antipsychotics vary in their ability to elevate prolactin levels, however, medications in this class such as risperidone and paliperidone carry the highest potential to induce hyperprolactinemia in a dose-dependent manner similar to typical antipsychotics.

==Signs and symptoms==
In women, high blood levels of prolactin are typically associated with hypoestrogenism, anovulatory infertility, and changes in menstruation. Menstruation disturbances commonly manifests as amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea. While mild hyperprolactinemia may not always result in menstrual disorders, it is uncommon for women to have normal menstrual cycles if their serum prolactin levels exceed 180 ng/ml (3,600 mU/L). In such cases, irregular menstrual flow may result in abnormally heavy and prolonged bleeding (menorrhagia). Women who are not pregnant or nursing may also unexpectedly begin producing breast milk (galactorrhea), a condition that is not always associated with high prolactin levels. For instance, many pre-menopausal women experiencing hyperprolactinemia do not experience galactorrhea and only some women who experience galactorrhea will be diagnosed with hyperprolactinemia. Thus, galactorrhea may be observed in individuals with normal prolactin levels and does not necessarily indicate hyperprolactinemia. This phenomenon is likely due to galactorrhea requiring adequate levels of progesterone or estrogen to prepare the breast tissue. Additionally, some women may also experience loss of libido and breast pain, particularly when prolactin levels rise initially, as the hormone promotes tissue changes in the breast.

In men, the most common symptoms of hyperprolactinemia are decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction/impotence, infertility, and gynecomastia. Unlike women, men do not experience reliable indicators of elevated prolactin such as menstrual changes, to prompt immediate medical consultation. As a result, the early signs of hyperprolactinemia are generally more difficult to detect and may go unnoticed until more severe symptoms are present. For instance, symptoms such as loss of libido and sexual dysfunction are subtle, arise gradually, and may falsely indicate a different cause. Many men with pituitary tumor–associated hyperprolactinemia may forego clinical help until they begin to experience serious endocrine and vision complications, such as major headaches or eye problems.

Men often present late in the course of hyperprolactinemia, typically symptoms are related to the expansion of their pituitary tumor, such as headaches, visual defects, and external opthalmoplegia, or symptoms from secondary adrenal or thyroid failure. Despite experiencing sexual impairment for many years before receiving a diagnosis, it is unclear whether macroprolactinomas are more commonly seen in men due to delayed diagnosis or if the pathogenesis of prolactinomas differs between men and women. Unlike women, who most commonly have microprolactinomas, men usually present with macroprolactinomas, and their serum prolactin levels are generally much higher than those observed in women.

Long-term hyperprolactinaemia can lead to detrimental changes in bone metabolism as a result of hypoestrogenism and hypoandrogenism. Studies have shown that chronically elevated prolactin levels lead to increased bone resorption and suppress bone formation, resulting in reduced bone density, increased risk of fractures, and increased risk of osteoporosis. In men, the chronic presence of hyperprolactinemia can lead to hypogonadism and osteolysis. The prevalence of bone impairment is significantly higher in men with prolactinomas compared to women. Impaired bone mineral density (BMD) serves as an &quot;end organ&quot; marker, reflecting the full extent of the disease. It could potentially become a surrogate marker for the severity of long-term hyperprolactinemia and associated hypogonadism.

==Causes==
Prolactin secretion is regulated by both stimulatory and inhibitory mechanisms. Dopamine acts on pituitary lactotroph D2 receptors to inhibit prolactin secretion while other peptides and hormones, such as thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), stimulate prolactin secretion. As a result, hyperprolactinemia may be caused by disinhibition (e.g., compression of the pituitary stalk or reduced dopamine levels) or excess production. The most common cause of hyperprolactinemia is prolactinoma (a type of pituitary adenoma). A blood serum prolactin level of 1000–5000 mIU/L (47–235 ng/mL) may arise from either mechanism, however levels &gt;5000 mIU/L (&gt;235 ng/mL) is likely due to the activity of an adenoma. Prolactin blood levels are typically correlated to the size of the tumors. Pituitary tumors smaller than 10 mm in diameter, or microadenomas, tend to have prolactin levels &lt;200 ng/mL. Macroadenomas larger than 10 mm in diameter possess prolactin &gt;1000 ng/mL.

Hyperprolactinemia inhibits the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, which in turn inhibits the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland and results in diminished gonadal sex hormone production (termed hypogonadism). This is the cause of many of the symptoms described below.

In many people, elevated prolactin levels remain unexplained and may represent a form of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysregulation.

===Physiological causes===
Physiological (i.e., non-pathological) causes that can increase prolactin levels include: ovulation, pregnancy, breastfeeding, chest wall injury, stress, stress-associated REM sleep, and exercise. During pregnancy, prolactin increases can range up to 600 ng/mL, depending on estrogen and progesterone concentrations. After delivery, progesterone concentrations decrease, and prolactin levels drop. Only during nipple stimulation will prolactin levels rise, allowing for milk production. At 6 weeks post-birth (postpartum), estradiol concentrations decrease, and prolactin concentrations return to normal even during breastfeeding. Fluctuations in prolactin levels during menstrual cycles and menopause are inconclusive.

Stress-related factors include physical exercise, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction, and surgery. While both aerobic and anaerobic activity increases prolactin, anaerobic activity has a greater effect. Coitus can also contribute to an increased prolactin release. Prolactin serum concentrations increase during nocturnal sleep, and increase transiently during daytime naps. After waking, prolactin levels return to daytime levels within 60–90 minutes.

===Medications===
Prolactin secretion in the pituitary lactrotroph cells is normally suppressed by the brain chemical dopamine, which binds to dopamine receptors. Drugs that block the effects of dopamine at the pituitary or deplete dopamine stores in the brain may cause the pituitary to secrete excess prolactin without an inhibitory effect. These drugs include the typical antipsychotics: phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine, and butyrophenones such as haloperidol; atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and paliperidone; gastroprokinetic drugs used to treat gastro-esophageal reflux and medication-induced nausea (such as that from chemotherapy): metoclopramide and domperidone; less often, alpha-methyldopa and reserpine, used to control hypertension; and TRH. Aripiprazole, while an atypical antipsychotic, lowers prolactin levels as it is contains both agonistic and antagonistic dopamine-receptor activity.

It is well known that estrogen stimulates prolactin secretion by upregulating the formation of lactotrophs. However, there is mixed evidence whether estrogen-containing oral contraceptives significantly increases prolactin levels. Gender-affirming therapy for transgender women that includes estrogen and antiandrogens have shown to increase prolactin levels, but it is unclear whether the cause is due to the estrogen or antiandrogen therapy. The melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon also increases the risk of hyperprolactinemia, however, the mechanism is unclear.

===Specific diseases===
A common cause for hyperprolactinemia is prolactinomas and other tumors arising near the pituitary. These adjacent tumors, such as those that cause acromegaly, can physically compress the pituitary stalk and block the flow of dopamine from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland, causing prolactin levels to increase. Other causes include chronic kidney failure, hypothyroidism, liver cirrhosis, bronchogenic carcinoma and sarcoidosis. Hyperprolactinemia develops in one-third of individuals with chronic kidney disease due to impaired renal clearance and regulation.

Some women with polycystic ovary syndrome may have mildly elevated prolactin levels. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder appears to be also correlated with elevated prolactin levels. In men, hyperprolactinemia leads to hypoactive sexual desire and, occasionally, erectile dysfunction. However, the link between erectile dysfunction and prolactin levels are not conclusive. When prolactin levels return to normal in these individuals, sexual desire fully recovers; however, erectile dysfunction only partially recovers.

Nonpuerperal mastitis may induce transient hyperprolactinemia (neurogenic hyperprolactinemia) of about three weeks&#x27; duration; conversely, hyperprolactinemia may contribute to nonpuerperal mastitis. Some inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, are also linked to higher prolactin levels in certain regions.

Apart from diagnosing hyperprolactinemia and hypopituitarism, prolactin levels are often checked by physicians in those who have had a seizure, when there is need to differentiate between epileptic seizure or a non-epileptic seizure. Shortly after epileptic seizures, prolactin levels often rise, whereas they are normal in non-epileptic seizures.

==Diagnosis==
An appropriate diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia starts with conducting a complete clinical history before performing any treatment. Physiological causes, systemic disorders, and the use of certain drugs must be ruled out before the condition is diagnosed. Screening is indicated for those who are asymptomatic and those with elevated prolactin without an associated cause.

The most common causes of hyperprolactinemia are prolactinomas, drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, and macroprolactinemia. Individuals with hyperprolactinemia may present with symptoms including galactorrhea, hypogonadism effects, and/or infertility. The magnitude that prolactin is elevated can be used as an indicator of the etiology of the hyperprolactinemia diagnosis. Prolactin levels over 250 ng/mL may suggest prolactinoma. Prolactin levels less than 100 ng/mL may suggest drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, macroprolactinemia, nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, or systemic disorders. Prolactin levels over 500 ng/mL usually indicates the presence of macroprolactinoma, however, in patients with elevated serum prolactin ( &gt;250 ng/mL) without evidence of prolactinoma, some medications such as metoclopramide, a dopamine receptor antagonist, can result in elevation of prolactin ( &gt;200 ng/mL) in patients with no evidence of pituitary adenomas. In patients with mildly elevated serum prolactin levels, secondary causes such as pituitary adenomas can be ruled out

Elevated prolactin blood levels are typically assessed in women with unexplained breast milk secretion (galactorrhea) or irregular menses or infertility, and in men with impaired sexual function and milk secretion. If high prolactin levels are present, all known conditions and medications which raises prolactin secretion must be assessed and excluded for diagnosis. After ruling out other causes and prolactin levels remain high, TSH levels are assessed. If TSH levels are elevated, hyperprolactinemia is secondary to hypothyroidism and treated accordingly. If TSH levels are normal, an MRI or CT scan is conducted to assess for any pituitary adenomas. Although hyperprolactinemia is often uncommon in postmenopausal women, prolactinomas detected after menopause are typically macroadenomas. While a plain X-ray of the bones surrounding the pituitary may reveal the presence of a large macroadenoma, small microadenomas will not be apparent. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive test for detecting pituitary tumors and determining their size. MRI scans may be repeated periodically to assess tumor progression and the effects of therapy. Computed Tomography (CT scan) is another indicator of abnormalities in pituitary gland size; it also gives an image of the pituitary, but is less sensitive than the MRI. In addition to assessing the size of the pituitary tumor, physicians also look for damage to surrounding tissues, and perform tests to assess whether production of other pituitary hormones are normal. Depending on the size of the tumor, physicians may request an eye exam that includes the measurement of visual fields. In the rare cases that other causes of hyperprolactinaemia, such as surgery, medication usage, renal and hepatic diseases, and seizures, are ruled out and no evidence of existing adenomas, the hyperprolactinaemia is considered as &quot;idiopathic&quot;. When the cause of hyperprolactinaemia is concluded as idiopathic, standard of care is given to patients and an MRI is expected to be repeated in 6–12 months. In diagnosing hyperprolactinaemia in men, some physical signs may indicate the onset of the condition. Increased prolactin can have an effect of the inhibition of GnRH secretion which is responsible for libido, and the releases of FSH (Follicle-stimulating hormone), LH (Luteinizing hormone), and testosterone. FSH in men is responsible to stimulate sperm production and LH is responsible for the stimulation of testosterone; with the inhibition of GnRH, FSH, and LH, physical signs that show in men include reduced sex drive and infertility, these symptoms suggests the onset of hyperprolactinaemia.

However, a high measurement of prolactin may also result from the presence of macroprolactin, otherwise known as &#x27;big prolactin&#x27; or &#x27;big-big prolactin&#x27;, in the serum. Macroprolactin occurs when prolactin polymerizes together and can bind with IgG to form complexes. Although this can result in high prolactin levels in some assay tests, macroprolactin is biologically inactive and will not cause symptoms typical of hyperprolactinemia. In those who are asymptomatic or without obvious causes of hyperprolactinemia, macroprolactin should be assessed and ruled out. However, in patients with abnormally high levels of serum prolactin, false negative results that indicates a low level of prolactin may occur; this occurrence is due to a phenomenon called the &quot;Hook effect&quot;. Antigen tests such as the pregnancy test shows positive line via the formation of a sandwich immune complex that allows the positive line to be visible, in the occurrence of Hook Effect, large amounts of analyte exists in the solution which saturates the antibodies, preventing normal binding and formation of the sandwich immune complex therefore showing a weak positive line. In the case of diagnosing hyperprolactinaemia, a weak positive line can often lead to a false negative result and increase the risk of misdiagnosis of the condition or a potential pituitary adenomas. If Hook Effect is suspected in the patient diagnosis, serial dilution of the analyte until the concentration of prolactin falls within the assay&#x27;s analytical measurements is suggested. Ruling out the possibilities of false negative is important to ensure patients receive necessary care for their conditions.

==Treatment==
The treatment for hyperprolactinemia is usually dependent upon its cause. There are many underlying factor that can cause hyperprolactinemia, some of them are hypothyroidism (disorder in which thyroid glands has a reduced thyroid hormone production), drug-induced hyperprolactinemia (such as antidepressant medication, antihypertensive medication and medication that can promotes bowel motility), hypothalamic disease(disorder caused by damage in the hypothalamus), idiopathic hyperprolactinemia( no recognized cause are present since there is no pituitary or central nervous disease present), macroprolactin (complex form of prolactin in the blood), or prolactinoma (non-cancerous tumor in the pituitary gland). Because there are so many underlying factors, in order to provide the proper management of hyperprolactinemia, the pathological form and physiological increase in prolactin levels are differentiated, and the correct cause of hyperprolactinemia must be identified before treatment. There are two types of functional hyperprolactinemia: symptomatic and asymptomatic. For functional asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia, the treatment of choice is removing the associated cause, including antipsychotic therapy. However, prolactin levels should be drawn and monitored both prior to any discontinuation or changes to therapy, and afterwards. In contrast to functional asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia, the treatment for functional symptomatic hyperprolactinemia is different since stopping antipsychotic drugs for a short trial period is not recommended due to the risk of exacerbation or relapse of symptoms. A systemic review and meta analysis review has shown options for treatment of hyperprolactinemia in people with psychotic disorder include decreasing the dose of antipsychotics, adding aripiprazole as an adjunctive therapy, and switching antipsychotics as a last resort. On the other hand, the treatment of hyperprolactinemia in children and adolescents with antipsychotic medications has been studied to provide guidelines, as these medications may adversely affect child growth and development. Results have shown that aripiprazole significantly decreases prolactin levels compared to other medications such as olanzapine and risperidone, which result in increased prolactin levels. Pharmacologic hyperprolactinemia, the concerning drug can be switched to another treatment or discontinued entirely. &quot;Vitex agnus-castus&quot; extract may be tried in cases of mild hyperprolactinemia. No treatment is required in asymptomatic macroprolactin and instead, serial prolactin measurements and pituitary imaging is monitored in a regular follow-up appointments.

Medical therapy is the preferred treatment in prolactinomas. In most cases, medications that are dopamine agonists, such as cabergoline, quinagolide and bromocriptine (often preferred when pregnancy is possible), are the treatment of choice used to decrease prolactin levels and tumor size upon the presence of microadenomas or macroadenomas. A systematic review and meta-analysis has shown that cabergoline and quinagolide are more effective in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia compared to bromocriptine, this is because evidence had suggested fewer side effects, rapid titration and offers better dosing interval in medication like quinagolide compared to bromocriptine. Similar studies have been conducted regarding the safety and efficacy of dopamine agonists. According to SUCRA (Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking) and SMAA (Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis), quinagolide was found to be the best treatment for women since it can help reduce menstrual irregularities, in addition bromocriptine was shown to be more effective in the treatment for galactorrhea (breast milk production unrelated to pregnancy), and cabergoline was the safest medication as it did not show any alarming side effects. Other dopamine agonists that have been used less commonly to suppress prolactin include dihydroergocryptine, ergoloid, lisuride, metergoline, pergolide, and terguride. If the prolactinoma does not initially respond to dopamine agonist therapy, such that prolactin levels are still high or the tumor is not shrinking as expected, the dose of the dopamine agonist can be increased in a stepwise fashion to the maximum tolerated dose. Another option is to consider switching between dopamine agonists. It is possible for the prolactinoma to be resistant to bromocriptine but respond well to cabergoline or other dopamine agonist and vice versa. It is crucial for people undergoing treatment with dopamine agonists to adhere to their medication and not stop it unless instructed by their medical provider. Meta-analysis and systematic reviews have shown that in many patients, hyperprolactinemia reemerges after withdrawal of the medication. For successful treatment with cabergoline, a duration of at least two years is recommended.

Surgical therapy can be considered if pharmacologic options have been exhausted. There is evidence to support improvement in outcomes in hyperprolactinemic patients who have shown to be resistant to or intolerant to the most effective treatment with dopamine agonists, on those patients radiotherapy and surgery are an alternative.

Although some studies have tried to explain the consequences of untreated hyperprolactinemia, there are limited studies available. However, it has been shown that some consequences can lead to osteoporosis (low bone mass), increasing the risk of fracture. Further analysis might determine whether population like high-risk men or post-menopausal women with no other indication for treatment should be on dopamine agonists.

<doc id="316760" wikidata="Q3062170" url="?curid=316760" title="Polymer-bonded explosive">
<text>Polymer-bonded explosives, also called PBX or plastic-bonded explosives, are explosive materials in which explosive powder is bound together in a matrix using small quantities (typically 5–10% by weight) of a synthetic polymer. PBXs are normally used for explosive materials that are not easily melted into a casting, or are otherwise difficult to form. 

PBX was first developed in 1952 at Los Alamos National Laboratory, as RDX embedded in polystyrene with diisooctyl phthalate (DEHP) plasticizer. HMX compositions with teflon-based binders were developed in 1960s and 1970s for gun shells and for Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) seismic experiments, although the latter experiments are usually cited as using hexanitrostilbene (HNS).

== Potential advantages ==
Polymer-bonded explosives have several potential advantages:
* If the polymer matrix is an elastomer (rubbery material), it tends to absorb shocks, making the PBX very insensitive to accidental detonation, and thus ideal for insensitive munitions.
* Hard polymers can produce PBX that is very rigid and maintains a precise engineering shape even under severe stress.
* PBX powders can be pressed into a desired shape at room temperature; casting normally requires hazardous melting of the explosive. High pressure pressing can achieve density for the material very close to the theoretical crystal density of the base explosive material.
* Many PBXes are safe to machine; turning solid blocks into complex three-dimensional shapes. For example, a billet of PBX can be precisely shaped on a lathe or CNC machine. This technique is used to machine explosive lenses necessary for modern nuclear weapons.

== Binders ==

=== Fluoropolymers ===

Fluoropolymers are advantageous as binders due to their high density (yielding high detonation velocity) and inert chemical behavior (yielding long shelf stability and low aging). They are somewhat brittle, as their glass transition temperature is at room temperature or above. This limits their use to insensitive explosives (e.g. TATB) where the brittleness does not have detrimental effects on safety. They are also difficult to process.

=== Elastomers ===

Elastomers have to be used with more mechanically sensitive explosives like HMX. The elasticity of the matrix lowers sensitivity of the bulk material to shock and friction; their glass transition temperature is chosen to be below the lower boundary of the temperature working range (typically below -55 °C). Crosslinked rubber polymers are however sensitive to aging, mostly by action of free radicals and by hydrolysis of the bonds by traces of water vapor. Rubbers like Estane or hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) are used for these applications extensively. Silicone rubbers and thermoplastic polyurethanes are also in use.

Fluoroelastomers, e.g. Viton, combine the advantages of both.

=== Energetic polymers ===
Energetic polymers (e.g. nitro or azido derivates of polymers) can be used as a binder to increase the explosive power in comparison with inert binders. Energetic plasticizers can be also used. The addition of a plasticizer lowers the sensitivity of the explosive and improves its processibility.

== Insults (potential explosive inhibitors) ==
Explosive yields can be affected by the introduction of mechanical loads or the application of temperature; such damages are called insults. The mechanism of a thermal insult at low temperatures on an explosive is primarily thermomechanical, at higher temperatures it is primarily thermochemical.

=== Thermomechanical ===
Thermomechanical mechanisms involve stresses by thermal expansion (namely differential thermal expansions, as thermal gradients tend to be involved), melting/freezing or sublimation/condensation of components, and phase transitions of crystals (e.g. transition of HMX from beta phase to delta phase at 175 °C involves a large change in volume and causes extensive cracking of its crystals).

=== Thermochemical ===
Thermochemical changes involve decomposition of the explosives and binders, loss of strength of binder as it softens or melts, or stiffening of the binder if the increased temperature causes crosslinking of the polymer chains. The changes can also significantly alter the porosity of the material, whether by increasing it (fracturing of crystals, vaporization of components) or decreasing it (melting of components). The size distribution of the crystals can be also altered, e.g. by Ostwald ripening. Thermochemical decomposition starts to occur at the crystal nonhomogeneities, e.g. intragranular interfaces between crystal growth zones, on damaged parts of the crystals, or on interfaces of different materials (e.g. crystal/binder). Presence of defects in crystals (cracks, voids, solvent inclusions...) may increase the explosive&#x27;s sensitivity to mechanical shocks.

<text>Karmiel () is a city in northern Israel. Established in 1964 as a development town, Karmiel is located in the Beit HaKerem Valley which divides upper and lower Galilee. The city is located south of the Acre–Safed road, from Safed and from Ma&#x27;alot-Tarshiha and from Acre. In Karmiel had a population of .

==History==

In 1956, about of land in the area that is now Karmiel, owned by residents of the nearby Israeli Arab villages of Deir al-Asad, Bi&#x27;ina and Nahf, were declared &quot;closed areas&quot; by Israeli authorities. This area, near the main road between Acre and Safed, had been an important marble quarrying site. In 1961, the Israeli authorities expropriated the land to build Karmiel. The villagers were offered &quot;equally good land&quot; in the area, but when Moshe Sneh (Maki) and Yusef Khamis (Mapam) brought the case to the Knesset on behalf of the villagers, the Knesset established that there was no such land. According to the Haredi newspaper &quot;She&#x27;arim&quot;, about (394 lots) were confiscated by a court order on 4 March 1963, at the request of the Israel Development Authority. However, the land was rocky, uninhabited and unfit for agriculture.

In 1964, when local Arabs applied for permission to move into the town, Minister of Housing Yosef Almogi replied that &quot;Karmiel was not built to solve the problems for the people in the surrounding area.&quot; In February 1965, 400 protesters marched from Tel Aviv to protest against &quot;discrimination of a group of our citizens&quot;. Representatives went to a local police station, informing the police that they were staying in the area without permission. Eventually, the perceived leaders were arrested and tried before a military tribunal.

Karmiel was one of the first cities in Israel to be established according to an urban master plan. It was built as part of the Central Galilee Development Project. Work began in 1963, and the official inauguration ceremony took place in October 1964. The first 16 families moved in at that time. A tender for the construction of Karmiel&#x27;s main roads was issued in 1963, and Mekorot built a water pipe network connecting Karmiel, Rameh, Sha&#x27;ab and other nearby villages. In 1972, Karmiel was granted development town status, which bolstered its growth due to government-provided economic incentives to attract young couples.

In 1981, Karmiel was awarded the Beautiful Israel prize and the Kaplan Prize for Management and Services. Karmiel achieved city status on November 20, 1986. The first mayor was Baruch Venger, followed by Adi Eldar, who has remained in this position until Moshe Kuninsky took his place in 2018.

18,000 new immigrants settled in Karmiel between 1990 and 2002. And in the 2000s, some SLA families were resettled in Karmiel following the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon.

During the Second Lebanon War in 2006, Hezbollah fired 180 Katyusha rockets into Karmiel and the neighboring villages, leading to casualties and damage to buildings, roads, and cars.

==Geography==

Karmiel is located on the Acre–Safed road, on the northern edge of the Lower Galilee. It lies in the Beit HaKerem Valley and its elevation is . The Hilazon Stream passes slightly to the south of Karmiel. Its tributaries, the Shezor and Shagor Streams pass through Karmiel on the east and north, respectively. Karmiel sits on the Shagor mountain range, which stretches from Mount Hazon in the east (, next to Maghar) to Mount Gilon in the west (, at Gilon). Western Karmiel was built on the Karmi (362 m) and Makosh (315 m) mountains. Work on a new railway line linking Haifa and Karmiel began in 2011 and opened in 2017.

==Demographics==
, the city encompasses an area of about 24 km2 with a population of about 50,000 residents, approximately 40% of whom are immigrants from 75 countries. The city also receives significant internal migration of Haredi families. Since 1990, 16,000 immigrants have arrived in Karmiel, the majority of whom are from the former Soviet Union. According to the national master plan, by 2020 Karmiel will have a population of approximately 120,000 residents. Since 1980, six new neighborhoods have been developed and populated. A technical college has been serving the community since 1989. , work is underway to create a further neighborhood on Mount Karmi on Karmiel&#x27;s western fringe.

===Integration of Russian-speakers===
&quot;Nitzotz-Machanaiym&quot; is a Religious Zionist community center which caters to the Russian-speaking population of Karmiel. It is one of a number of similar centers in Israel which operate in the framework of the Machanaiym &quot;Communities&quot; project. Rabbi Eli Talberg is the director of Natzotz-Machanyim, which is located on the first floor of &quot;Kikar Ha&#x27;Ir&quot; (often called &quot;The Old Mall&quot;). Activities include a beit midrash, conversion classes, Hebrew classes, a youth club, a women&#x27;s club, and additional workshops and activities for all ages. The community also organizes regular educational tours throughout Israel and participates in sporting and social events with other branches of the Communities project.

===Arab residents===
According to The Times of Israel, as of 2020, Israeli Arabs &quot;...now constitute around six percent of Karmiel&#x27;s population - around 2,760 people...&quot;
 The Israel Democracy Institute report of 2018, as quoted in The Times of Israel, suggests Karmiel is one of a number of cities &#x27;in the process of being mixed&#x27;, and reflects the upward mobility of some Arab Israelis, who seek to move into predominantly Jewish towns and cities, which do not suffer from a lack of government planning and construction.
==Local government==
The local government is the Municipality of Karmiel, which is responsible for all the municipal matters regarding the City. Adam Tal was the first official head of the group that founded Karmiel in 1964. Avraham Argov replaced him and was himself replaced in 1968 by Baruch Venger, who headed the municipality of Karmiel until his death in office on November 22, 1988. His successor was Adi Eldar, who was re-elected several times. In November 2018, Moshe Kuninsky was elected Mayor of Karmiel.

==Education==
Karmiel has four high schools, four junior high schools, a vocational training center, nine state-run elementary schools, one state-run religious school (including high school), an independent education elementary school, a school for gifted children and an educational farm, many kindergartens, nursery schools and daycare centers, as well as a network of community youth and sports centers and the international ORT Braude College of Engineering with a student body of 3,500 studying computers, electronics, industrial administration, biotechnology and other subjects. A biotechnology research and development center will also open at the college. However, despite a gradual increase in the Arab-Israeli population of Karmiel (c. six percent as of 2020), there is no Arabic-speaking school.

In November 2020, Krayot Magistrate&#x27;s Court dismissed a lawsuit brought by Attorney Nizar Bakri on behalf of his two Arab Israeli nephews, alleging their right to education in Karmiel had been infringed by the municipality&#x27;s failure to provide transport to and from Arabic-language schools outside the town. In his ruling the judge said that Karmiel was a Jewish city and Arabic-language schools could change its demographic balance and character. This ruling was based on Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People, which states that &quot;the right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.&quot; Critics say the law constitutionally enshrines Jewish supremacy and ethno-religious discrimination in Israel&#x27;s Basic Law and relegates the Arab minority to an inferior status.

==Culture==
===Dance festival===
The city is known for the Karmiel Dance Festival, a yearly event since 1988. The festival is usually held for 3 days and nights in July, and includes dance performances, workshops, and open dance sessions. The festival began as a celebration of Israeli folk dance, but today it features many different dance forms from all around the globe, and attracts thousands of dancers and hundreds of thousands of spectators from many countries.

===Beer festival===
Karmiel used to host a yearly beer festival event, which included music and food, and was usually held in October. The 5th and last festival was held in 2019, being cancelled the next year and not renewed due to the corona pandemic.

==Health care==
In 2011, a Terem emergency care clinic was opened in Karmiel. The clinic is under the medical management of Dr. Walid Assadi and is open seven days a week, including Sabbath and holidays. Israel&#x27;s four national health funds all maintain clinics in the city. In addition, Karmiel has dental clinics, general clinics, and private clinics.

==Environmental protection==
Karmiel was the first Israeli city to receive ISO 9002 certification for the quality of its services. It is one of the few Israeli cities with ISO 1410 certification for environmental standards. Karmiel has enacted by-laws to protect the environment and prevent pollution, and become a center for clean industries and advanced technology enterprises that abide by these standards.

==Parks and gardens==

The Holocaust Memorial Park is located at the entrance to the city. The bronze sculptures were made by Jewish sculptor and artist Nicky Imber (1920-1996). The sculptures are separated into three groups: Holocaust, wondering and hope; which represent the story of the Jewish people from the time of the Holocaust to the return to the holy land.

The Karmiel Quarries Park is a 12.4-acre park developed on the site of a defunct limestone quarry. One section of the park is a sculpture garden. An amphitheater on the grounds of the park hosts local events and incorporates a drainage system that collects rainfall which is later used for watering greenery.

<text>James Columbus &quot;Jay&quot; McShann (January 12, 1916 – December 7, 2006) was an American jazz pianist, vocalist, composer, and bandleader. He led bands in Kansas City, Missouri, that included Charlie Parker, Bernard Anderson, Walter Brown, and Ben Webster.

==Early life and education==
McShann was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma, and was nicknamed Hootie. During his youth he taught himself how to play the piano through observing his sister&#x27;s piano lessons and trying to practice tunes he heard off the radio. He was also heavily influenced by late-night broadcasts of pianist Earl Hines from Chicago&#x27;s Grand Terrace Cafe: &quot;When &#x27;Fatha&#x27; (&quot;Hines&quot;) went off the air, I went to bed&quot;. He began working as a professional musician in 1931 at the age of 15, performing around Tulsa, Oklahoma, and neighboring Arkansas.

==Career==
===1936–44===
McShann moved to Kansas City, Missouri, in 1936, and set up his own big band which variously featured Charlie Parker (1937–42), Al Hibbler, Ben Webster, Paul Quinichette, Bernard Anderson, Gene Ramey, Jimmy Coe, Gus Johnson (1938–43), Harold &quot;Doc&quot; West, Earl Coleman, Walter Brown, and Jimmy Witherspoon, among others. His first recordings were all with Charlie Parker, the first as the Jay McShann Orchestra on August 9, 1940.

The band played both swing and blues numbers, but played blues on most of its records; its most popular recording was &quot;Confessin&#x27; the Blues&quot; with Walter Brown on vocals. The group disbanded when McShann was drafted into the Army in 1944. After his return two years later, he found that small groups were now taking the place of big-bands in the jazz scene.

McShann told the Associated Press in 2003: &quot;You&#x27;d hear some cat play, and somebody would say, &#x27;This cat, he sounds like he&#x27;s from Kansas City.&#x27; It was Kansas City Style. They knew it on the East Coast. They knew it on the West Coast. They knew it up North, and they knew it down South.&quot;

===1945–2006===
After World War II McShann began to lead small groups featuring the blues shouter Jimmy Witherspoon. Witherspoon began to record with McShann in 1945 and, fronting McShann&#x27;s band, he had a hit in 1949 with &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody&#x27;s Business&quot;. As well as writing much material, Witherspoon continued recording with McShann&#x27;s band, which also featured Ben Webster. McShann had a modern rhythm and blues hit with &quot;Hands Off&quot;, featuring a vocal by Priscilla Bowman, in 1955.

In the late 1960s, McShann often performed as a singer as well as a pianist, often with violinist Claude Williams. He continued recording and touring through the 1990s. Well into his 80s, McShann still performed occasionally, particularly in the Kansas City area and Toronto, Ontario, where he made his last recording, &quot;Hootie Blues&quot;, in February 2001, after a recording career of 61 years. In 1979, he appeared prominently in &quot;The Last of the Blue Devils&quot;, a documentary film about Kansas City jazz.

One of McShann&#x27;s favorite stories to tell was how band member and friend Charlie Parker got his nickname &quot;Bird&quot;. During their drive to a gig in Nebraska with a car full of musicians, the driver of the car accidentally hit a chicken. According to McShann, Parker requested the driver turn around so he could get the bird, and sat with it in the backseat of the car all the way to Lincoln. Once they arrived he asked the keeper of the home they were staying in to cook it up for him.

McShann died on December 7, 2006, in Kansas City, Missouri at the age of 90.

<text>Ralph Johnson Bunche ( ; August 7, 1904 – December 9, 1971) was an American political scientist, diplomat, and leading actor in the mid-20th-century decolonization process and US civil rights movement, who received the 1950 Nobel Peace Prize for his late 1940s mediation in Israel. He is the first black Nobel laureate and the first person of African descent to be awarded a Nobel Prize. He was involved in the formation and early administration of the United Nations (UN), and played a major role in both the decolonization process and numerous UN peacekeeping operations.

Bunche served on the US delegation to both the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944 and United Nations Conference on International Organization in 1945 that drafted the UN charter. He then served on the American delegation to the first session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1946 and joined the UN as head of the Trusteeship Department, beginning a long series of troubleshooting roles and responsibilities related to decolonization. In 1948, Bunche became an acting mediator for the Middle East, negotiating an armistice between Egypt and Israel. For this success he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950.

Bunche continued to serve at the UN, working on crises in the Sinai (1956), the Congo (1960), Yemen (1963), Cyprus (1964) and Bahrain in 1970, reporting directly to the UN Secretary-General. He chaired study groups dealing with water resources in the Middle East. In 1957, he was promoted to Under-Secretary-General for special political affairs, having prime responsibility for peacekeeping roles. In 1965, Bunche supervised the cease-fire following the war between India and Pakistan. He retired from the UN in June 1971, dying six months later.

In 1963, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President John F. Kennedy. At the UN, Bunche gained such fame that &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine proclaimed him perhaps the most influential African American of the first half of the 20th century and &quot;[f]or nearly a decade, he was the most celebrated African American of his time both [in the US] and abroad.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Bunche was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1904 and baptized at the city&#x27;s Second Baptist Church. When Ralph was a child, his family moved to Toledo, Ohio, where his father looked for work. They returned to Detroit in 1909 after his sister Grace was born, with the help of their maternal aunt, Ethel Johnson. Their father did not live with the family again after Ohio and had not been &quot;a good provider&quot;. But he followed them when they moved to New Mexico.

Because of the declining health of his mother and uncle, the family moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1915. His mother, &quot;a musically inclined woman who contributed much to what her son called a household &#x27;bubbling over with ideas and opinions, died in 1917 from tuberculosis, and his uncle shortly thereafter. Thereafter, Bunche was raised by his maternal grandmother, Lucy Taylor Johnson, whom he credited with instilling in him his pride in his race and his self-belief.

In 1918, Lucy Taylor Johnson moved with the two Bunche grandchildren to the South Central neighborhood of Los Angeles.

Bunche was a brilliant student, a debater, athlete and the valedictorian of his graduating class at Jefferson High School. He attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as a political science student, and graduated &quot;&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa in 1927 as the valedictorian of his class. Using the money his community raised for his studies and a graduate scholarship at Harvard University, he earned a doctorate in political science.

==Academic career==
Bunche earned a master&#x27;s degree in political science in 1928 and a doctorate in 1934, while he was already teaching in the Department of Political Science at Howard University, a historically black college. At the time, it was typical for doctoral candidates to start teaching before completion of their dissertations. He was the first African American to gain a PhD in political science from an American university. Bunche&#x27;s 1934 dissertation, &quot;French Administration in Togoland and Dahomey&quot;, won the Toppan Prize for the best dissertation on comparative politics in the Department of Government at Harvard University. The dissertation examined the mandates system of the League of Nations, arguing that the system was indistinguishable from formal empire.

From 1936 to 1938, Ralph Bunche studied anthropology and conducted postdoctoral research at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and at the London School of Economics (LSE), and later at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.

He published his first book, &quot;A World View of Race,&quot; in 1936, arguing that &quot;race is a social concept which can be and is employed effectively to rouse and rationalize emotions [and] an admirable device for the cultivation of group prejudices.&quot; In 1940, Bunche served as the chief research associate to Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal&#x27;s landmark study of racial dynamics in the U.S., &quot;An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy&quot;.

For more than two decades (1928–1950), Bunche served as chair of the Department of Political Science at Howard University, where he also taught. Furthermore, he contributed to the Howard School of International Relations with his work regarding the effect racism and imperialism had on global economic systems and international relations.

Bunche was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1950. He was the first Black member to be inducted into the Society since its founding in 1743. In 1953–54, he served as the president of the American Political Science Association. He served as a member of the Board of Overseers of his alma mater, Harvard University (1960–1965), as a member of the board of the Institute of International Education, and as a trustee of Oberlin College, Lincoln University, and New Lincoln School.

==World War II years==

In 1941–43, Bunche worked in the Research and Analysis Branch (R&amp;A) of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the wartime intelligence service, as a senior social analyst on Colonial Affairs. In 1943, he was transferred from the OSS to the State Department. He was appointed Associate Chief of the Division of Dependent Area Affairs under Alger Hiss. With Hiss, Bunche became one of the leaders of the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR). He participated in the preliminary planning for the United Nations at the San Francisco Conference of 1945. In 2008, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration released a 51-page PDF of his OSS records, which is available online.

==United Nations==
Near the close of World War II in 1944, Bunche took part in planning for the United Nations at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, held in Washington, D.C. He was an adviser to the U.S. delegation for the Charter Conference of the United Nations held in 1945, when the governing document was drafted. Together with First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, Bunche was instrumental in the creation and adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Bunche urged African Americans to take UN positions. &quot;Negroes ought to get busy and prepare to obtain some of the jobs in the United Nations&#x27; set-up,&quot; he counseled. &quot;There are going to be all kinds of jobs and Negroes should attempt to get jobs on all levels. Some organization should be working on this now.&quot;

According to the United Nations document &quot;Ralph Bunche: Visionary for Peace&quot;, during his 25 years of service to the United Nations, he

===Decolonization===
Bunche was instrumental in ending colonialism. His work to end colonialism began early in his academic career, during which time he developed into a leading scholar and expert of the impact of colonialism on subjugated people, and developed close relationships with many anti-colonialism leaders and intellectuals from the Caribbean and Africa, in particular during his field research and his time at the London School of Economics. Bunche characterized economic policies in colonies and mandates as exploitative, and argued that the colonial powers misrepresented the nature of their rule. He argued that Permanent Mandates Commission needed expanded powers to investigate how the mandates were governed.

Bunche&#x27;s work on decolonization was influenced by the work of Raymond Leslie Buell. However, Bunche disagreed with Buell on the relative merits of British and French colonial rule. Bunche argued that British rule was not more progressive – British rule was characterized by paternalism at best and white supremacy at worst.

At a speech in Cleveland, Bunche said: &quot;The modern world has come to the realisation that there is a great moral issue involved in the perpetuation of the colonial system.&quot;

Historian Susan Pedersen describes Bunche as the &quot;architect&quot; of the United Nations&#x27; trusteeship regime. Bunche was a principal author of the chapters in the UN charter on non-self-determining territories and trusteeship. He was later head of the Trusteeship Division of the UN.

===Arab–Israeli conflict and Nobel Peace Prize===
Beginning in 1947, Bunche was involved with trying to resolve the Arab–Israeli conflict in Palestine. He served as assistant to the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, and thereafter as the principal secretary of the UN Palestine Commission. In 1948, he traveled to the Middle East as the chief aide to Sweden&#x27;s Count Folke Bernadotte, who had been appointed by the UN to mediate the conflict. These men chose the island of Rhodes for their base and working headquarters. In September 1948, Bernadotte was assassinated in Jerusalem by members of the underground Jewish Lehi group, which was led by Yitzhak Shamir and referred to its members as terrorists and admitted to having carried out terrorist attacks.
Following the assassination, Bunche became the UN&#x27;s chief mediator; he conducted all future negotiations on Rhodes. The representative for Israel was Moshe Dayan; he reported in memoirs that much of his delicate negotiation with Bunche was conducted over a billiard table while the two were shooting pool. Optimistically, Bunche commissioned a local potter to create unique memorial plates bearing the name of each negotiator. When the agreement was signed, Bunche awarded these gifts. After unwrapping his, Dayan asked Bunche what might have happened if no agreement had been reached. &quot;I&#x27;d have broken the plates over your damn heads,&quot; Bunche answered. For achieving the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Bunche received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950. He continued to work for the United Nations, mediating in other strife-torn regions, including the Congo, Yemen, Kashmir, and Cyprus. Bunche was appointed Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1968. While at the UN, Bunche forged a close bond with his friend and colleague, Ambassador Charles W. Yost, with whom he had worked at the UN founding conference.

he was a person

Bunche was actively involved in movements for black liberation in his pre-United Nations days, including through leadership positions with various civil rights organizations and as one of the leading scholars on the issue of race in the US and colonialism abroad. During his time at the United Nations, Bunche remained a vocal supporter of the US Civil Rights Movement despite his activities being somewhat constrained by the codes governing international civil servants. He participated in the 1963 March on Washington, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, and also, marching side by side with King, in the Selma to Montgomery march in 1965, which contributed to passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 and federal enforcement of voting rights. As a result of his activism in the pre-war period, Bunche was a topic of discussion in the House Un-American Activities Committee. However, he was never a communist or Marxist, and indeed came under very heavy attack from the pro-Soviet press during his career.

Bunche lived in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York, in a home purchased with his Nobel Prize money, from 1953 until his death. Like many other people of color, Bunche continued to struggle against racism across the United States and sometimes in his own neighborhood. In 1959, he and his son, Ralph, Jr., were denied membership in the West Side Tennis Club in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens. After the issue was given national coverage by the press, the club offered the Bunches an apology and invitation of membership. The official who had rebuffed them resigned. Bunche refused the offer, saying it was not based on racial equality and was an exception based only on his personal prestige. During his UN career, Bunche turned down appointments from presidents Harry Truman and John Kennedy, because of the Jim Crow laws still in effect in Washington, D.C. Historian John Hope Franklin credits him with &quot;creating a new category of leadership among African-Americans&quot; due to his unique ability &quot;to take the power and prestige he accumulated...to address the problems of his community.&quot;

Bunche denounced the Watts riots, which led to a critique from the black power movement. He took the critique seriously and following his daughter&#x27;s suicide came to sympathize with the riots, calling them a violent rejection of unjust authority.

==Marriage and family==
While teaching at Howard University in 1928, Bunche met Ruth Harris, who was a first-grade teacher in Washington, D.C. They later started seeing each other and married June 23, 1930. The couple had three children: Joan Harris Bunche (1931–2015), Jane Johnson Bunche (1933–1966), and Ralph J. Bunche, Jr. (1943–2016). His grandson, Ralph J. Bunche III, is the general secretary of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, an international membership organization established to facilitate the voices of unrepresented and marginalised nations and peoples worldwide.

On October 9, 1966, their daughter Jane Bunche Pierce fell or jumped from the roof of her apartment building in Riverdale, Bronx; her death was believed to be suicide. She left no note. She and her husband Burton Pierce, a Cornell alumnus and labor relations executive, had three children. Their apartment was on the first floor of the building.

==Death==
Bunche resigned from his position at the UN due to ill health, but this was not announced, as Secretary-General U Thant hoped he would be able to return soon. His health did not improve, and Bunche died December 9, 1971, from complications of heart disease, kidney disease, and diabetes. He was 67. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

<text>James Witherspoon (August 8, 1920 – September 18, 1997) was an American jump blues singer.

==Early life, family and education==
Witherspoon was born in Gurdon, Arkansas. His father was a railroad worker who sang in local choirs, and his mother was an avid piano player. Witherspoon&#x27;s grandson Ahkello Witherspoon is a cornerback for the Los Angeles Rams.

Witherspoon eventually joined the Merchant Marines.

==Career==
Witherspoon first attracted attention singing in Calcutta, India, with Teddy Weatherford&#x27;s band, which made regular radio broadcasts over the US Armed Forces Radio Service during World War II. Witherspoon made his first records with Jay McShann&#x27;s band in 1945. He first recorded under his own name in 1947, and two years later with the McShann band, he had his first hit, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody&#x27;s Business&quot;, a song that came to be regarded as his signature tune. In 1950 he had hits with two more songs closely identified with him—&quot;No Rollin&#x27; Blues&quot; and &quot;Big Fine Girl&quot;—and also hit with &quot;Failing by Degrees&quot; and &quot;New Orleans Woman&quot;, recorded with the Gene Gilbeaux Orchestra (which included Herman Washington and Don Hill) for Modern Records. They were recorded at a live performance on May 10, 1949, at a &quot;Just Jazz&quot; concert in Pasadena, California, sponsored by Gene Norman. Another classic Witherspoon composition is &quot;Times Gettin&#x27; Tougher Than Tough&quot;.

Witherspoon performed in four of the famed Cavalcade of Jazz concerts held in Los Angeles at Wrigley Field which were produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. His first performance was at the fourth Cavalcade of Jazz on September 12, 1948, and Dizzy Gillespie was the featured artist along with Frankie Lane, Little Miss Cornshucks, The Sweetheart of Rhythms, Joe Liggins&#x27;s Honeydrippers, Joe Turner, The Blenders, and The Sensations. The program description stated that Witherspoon &quot;is one of the most sought-after blues singers in the business. He has a strong, clear voice and diction that you would hear in the classics. Although he has been quite successful singing the blues, Witherspoon can sing ballads with a surprising sweetness.&quot; He played at the fifth Cavalcade of Jazz concert on July 10, 1949, along with Lionel Hampton, The Hamptones, Buddy Banks and his Orchestra, Big Jay McNeely, and Smiley Turner. Witherspoon came back again for the seventh Cavalcade of Jazz concert on July 8, 1951, and performed alongside Billy Eckstine, Lionel Hampton and his Revue, Percy Mayfield, Joe Liggins&#x27;s Honeydrippers, and Roy Brown. His last appearance at the eighth Cavalcade of Jazz concert was on June 1, 1952. Also featured that day were Anna Mae Winburn and Her Sweethearts, Jerry Wallace, Toni Harper, Roy Brown and His Mighty Men, Louis Jordan and his Orchestra, and Josephine Baker.

Witherspoon&#x27;s style of blues—as a &quot;blues shouter&quot;—became unfashionable in the mid-1950s, but he returned to popularity with his 1959 album &quot;Jimmy Witherspoon at the Monterey Jazz Festival&quot;, which featured Roy Eldridge, Woody Herman, Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins, Earl Hines, and Mel Lewis. Witherspoon later recorded with Gerry Mulligan, Leroy Vinnegar, Richard &quot;Groove&quot; Holmes, and T-Bone Walker.

==Tours and successes==
In 1961 he toured Europe with Buck Clayton and returned to the UK on many occasions, featuring on a mid-&#x27;60s live UK recording, &quot;Spoon Sings and Swings&quot; (1966), with tenor sax player Dick Morrissey&#x27;s quartet. In 1970, Witherspoon appeared on Brother Jack McDuff&#x27;s London Blue Note recording &quot;To Seek a New Home&quot; together with British jazz musicians, including Dick Morrissey, again, and Terry Smith. In the 1970s Witherspoon also recorded the album &quot;Guilty!&quot; (later released on CD as &quot;Black &amp; White Blues&quot;) with Eric Burdon and featuring Ike White &amp; the San Quentin Prison Band. He then toured with a band of his own featuring Robben Ford and Russ Ferrante. A recording from this period, &quot;Spoonful&quot;, featured Witherspoon accompanied by Robben Ford, Joe Sample, Cornell Dupree, Thad Jones, and Bernard Purdie. He continued performing and recording into the 1990s.

Other performers with whom Witherspoon recorded include Jimmy Rowles, Earl &quot;Fatha&quot; Hines, Vernon Alley, Mel Lewis, Teddy Edwards, Gerald Wiggins, John Clayton, Paul Humphrey, Pepper Adams, Kenny Burrell, Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison, Jimmy Smith, Long John Baldry, Junior Mance, Ellington bassist Jimmy Woode, Kenny Clarke, Gerry Mulligan, Jim Mullen, Count Basie, Van Morrison, Dutch Swing College Band, and Gene Gilbeaux.

==Acting==
In the 1995 film &quot;Georgia&quot;, Witherspoon portrayed Trucker, a traveling, gun-collecting blues singer who has a relationship with the troubled character Sadie, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh.

He played Nate Williams in &quot;The Black Godfather&quot; (1974) and Percy in &quot;To Sleep with Anger&quot; (1990).

==Personal life, death and legacy==
Witherspoon died of throat cancer on September 18, 1997, in Los Angeles, California.

<text>Mahir Çağrı (, born 1962) is a Turkish individual who became an Internet celebrity in 1999. His picture-laden personal homepage, which exclaimed, in broken English, his love of the accordion, travel, and women, was visited by millions and spawned numerous fansites and parodies, one of which was featured on Fox&#x27;s &quot;MadTV&quot; (season 5, episode 20). He was also repeatedly parodied in 1999 on episodes of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, wearing red Speedos and playing ping-pong. Çağrı was ranked #2 in CNET&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Web fads&quot;. The site was also included in PC World&#x27;s &quot;The 25 Worst Web Sites&quot; list.

Çağrı claimed in various interviews that his personal webpage was hacked, with additions such as &quot;I like sex&quot; embedded into his webpage. The site was originally hosted on the now defunct XOOM web hosting service which advertised Çağrı on its front page during the mania.

Çağrı was used in British TV advertising for smartgroups.com by St. Luke&#x27;s advertising agency.

==Similarities to Borat==

Çağrı has stated that Sacha Baron Cohen&#x27;s character Borat was based on him, and is therefore owed some sort of royalties for use of his likeness.

<doc id="316789" wikidata="Q1034573" url="?curid=316789" title="Patriot Day">
<text>In the United States, Patriot Day occurs on September 11 of each year in memory of the victims killed in the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001.

==History==
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, carried out by terrorists from Al-Qaeda, President George W. Bush proclaimed Friday, September 14, 2001, as a National Day of Prayer and Remembrance for the Victims of the Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001.

A bill to make September 11 a national day of mourning was introduced in the U.S. House on October 25, 2001, by Rep. Vito Fossella (R-NY) with 22 co-sponsors. The result was the resolution to proclaim September 11, 2002, as the first Patriot Day.

Original co-sponsors in the House were:

* Gary Ackerman (D-NY)
* Rick Boucher (D-VA)
* Eliot Engel (D-NY)
* Phil English (R-PA)
* Randy Forbes (R-VA)
* Benjamin Gilman (R-NY)
* Felix Grucci (R-NY)
* Maurice Hinchey (D-NY)
* Steve Israel (D-NY)
* Peter T. King (R-NY)
* Ray LaHood (R-IL)
* Nita Lowey (D-NY)
* Carolyn Maloney (D-NY)
* Michael R. McNulty (D-NY)
* Jim Moran (D-VA)
* Jerry Nadler (D-NY)
* John E. Peterson (R-PA)
* Thomas M. Reynolds (R-NY)
* Ed Schrock (R-VA)
* Don Sherwood (R-PA)
* Ed Towns (D-NY)
* James T. Walsh (R-NY)
From 2009 to 2016, President Barack Obama proclaimed September 11 as Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, in observance of the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. In 2017, President Donald Trump proclaimed September 8–10 as National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, and proclaimed September 11 as Patriot Day.
President Trump also did so in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Since Joe Biden was elected president in 2020, he has also issued Executive Orders for Patriot Day in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. 

==Observance==
The flag of the United States is flown at half-staff at the White House and on all U.S. government buildings and establishments throughout the world; Americans are also encouraged to display flags in and outside their homes. Additionally, a moment of silence is observed to correspond with the attacks, beginning at 8:46 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time), the time the first plane, American Airlines Flight 11, struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.

Patriot Day is not a federal holiday; schools and businesses remain open in observance of the occasion, although memorial ceremonies for the 2,977 victims are often held. Volunteer and service opportunities are coordinated by the Corporation for National and Community Service.

<doc id="316794" wikidata="Q1940083" url="?curid=316794" title="Hockey stick">
<text>A hockey stick is a piece of sports equipment used by the players in all the forms of hockey to move the ball or puck (as appropriate to the type of hockey) either to push, pull, hit, strike, flick, steer, launch or stop the ball/puck during play with the objective being to move the ball/puck around the playing area using the stick, and then trying to score.

The word &quot;stick&quot; is a generic term for the equipment since different types of hockey require different forms and sizes to be effective. Field/ice/roller hockey all have a visually similar form of stick with a long shaft or handle which can be held with two hands, and a curved and flattened end; the end and curvature of these sticks are generally the most visible differences between the sticks for these sports. A modern underwater hockey stick bears little resemblance to any field/ice/roller hockey stick, since it is much smaller to enable it to be used exclusively in one hand, and it also has to be produced in one of two colours in order to identify which of the competing teams a player is playing for.

== Field hockey ==
Field hockey sticks have an end that varies in shape, often depending on the player&#x27;s position. In general, there are four main variations on the head:
The &#x27;short&#x27; is mainly used by players wishing control over the ball, and increase their manoeuvrability. This specific head is most associated with the mid-field position. (or centre for Ice Hockey)

The &#x27;Midi&#x27; is used by players who will be hitting the ball often and need to be strong on their &#x27;reverse side&#x27;. This specific head is most associated with the striker or &#x27;up-front&#x27; position.

The &#x27;Maxi&#x27; is similar to the &#x27;Midi&#x27; as it has an increased surface area which is useful for hitting. However, its strength allows it to be used much more effectively for stopping the ball. This head is used by &#x27;defenders&#x27; and &#x27;attackers&#x27;.

The &#x27;J Hook&#x27; again has a large surface area. However does not have the effectiveness of the &#x27;Midi&#x27; for striking the ball, it has an increased thickness making it ideal for stopping the ball. This head is most commonly used by &#x27;defenders&#x27;.
Field hockey sticks vary widely in length and price, ranging from to . The main brands of sticks include TK, Grays, Slazenger, Byte, Kookaburra, Malik, Dita, Voodoo, Adidas, Gryphon, uber hockey, Woodworm, Brabo, Mercian, Mazon, Zoppo, Tempest, Matador, King Karachi, NedStar, The Indian Maharaja, Stag, Wasa, No Fear, BHP, Taurus, Wasp, Princess, IHSAN, Mohinder, Chryso, Piranha, Rage, Sachin and Edge.

The size of the stick that is most effective for a specific player is judged by that player&#x27;s height. A stick would be used by a player under 4&#x27; most commonly, whereas a stick would be used mainly by players over . However &#x27;defenders&#x27; often like to have a longer stick than &#x27;attackers&#x27; as this can be used for a greater reach when stopping a moving ball. The &#x27;attackers&#x27; prefer a shorter stick as it allows greater control of the ball.

== Ice hockey ==

Ice hockey sticks have traditionally been made from wood, but in recent years, sticks made of more expensive materials such as aluminum, aramid (brands Kevlar, Nomex, Twaron, etc.), fibreglass, carbon fibre, and other composite materials have become common. In addition to weighing less, composite sticks can be manufactured with more consistent flexibility properties than their wooden counterparts. They also do not have the natural variations that wooden sticks possess therefore a batch of the same sticks will all perform roughly the same. There were a few die-hard NHL professionals who still liked the feel of wood sticks as late as 2010, such as Paul Stastny, son of Hall-of-Famer Peter Šťastný. Some of these sticks have replaceable wood or composite blades, while others are one-piece sticks without a replaceable blade. Composite sticks, despite their greater expense, are now commonplace at nearly all competitive levels of the sport, including youth ice hockey. These new sticks are lighter and provide a quicker release of the puck, resulting in a harder, more accurate shot. Although the new materials do enable harder shots, the improved durability and lighter materials can make the transition from wooden to composite stick more difficult for less experienced players. A shortcut used by numerous players is to use a weighted system, such as kwik hands, to quickly adjust to the new sticks. More expensive ice hockey sticks usually are the lightest sticks on the market (390-470 grams in a senior stick). In addition to the increased torque that these composite sticks possess, the sticks do not warp or absorb moisture like their wooden counterparts.

When the player is standing on his skates with the stick upright, on the toe, perpendicular to the ice, the top of the shaft should stop just below or above the chin, depending on personal preference. Defensemen tend to use longer sticks which provide greater reach when poke-checking.

Ice hockey sticks are also used in rinkball.

== Inline hockey ==
In the event of roller inline hockey, one-piece sticks are usually the same as ice hockey sticks. But when graphite shafts are used with replacement blades, it&#x27;s quite common for the replacement blades to be made of mainly fibreglass with a narrow wood core. Fibreglass shaves down over time on concrete, sport court and blacktop surfaces where traditional wooden ice hockey replacement blades are more likely to splinter, split and/or crack on those surfaces.

== Underwater hockey ==

The stick (also referred to as a pusher) for underwater hockey is relatively short compared to that for field/ice/roller hockey, and should be coloured either white or black in its entirety to indicate the player&#x27;s team. The shape of the stick can affect playing style and is often a very personal choice.

A wide variety of stick designs are allowed within the constraints of the rules of the game, the principal rule being that the stick must fit into a box of and that the stick must not be capable of surrounding the puck by any more than 50% of the puck&#x27;s circumference, nor any part of the hand. A rule concerning the radiuses of projections and edges tries to address the risk that the stick might unintentionally become more of a weapon than a playing tool.

Construction materials may be of wood or plastics and current rules now supersede those that previously required sticks to be homogeneous, although they almost always are anyway. Many players of UWH manufacture their own sticks of wood to their preferred shape and style, although there are increasingly more mass-produced designs that suit the majority (such as Bentfish, Britbat, CanAm, Dorsal, Stingray etc.) which in most cases are made of a moulded nylon or PTFE, and many styles can be obtained to suit either handedness.

The rules allow for a symmetrical double-ended stick to be used, i.e. one that may be held in either the left or the right hand, and this can give ambidextrous players the opportunity to swap hands during play, although the rules are also very clear that the stick may be held in only one hand at a time.

Modern-day Underwater Hockey (UWH) was invented as a sport originally known as Octopush in Southsea, England in 1954 and has always used short sticks or pushers similar to those described above, but a very similar game also called underwater hockey evolved some years after this in South Africa. This game used a &#x27;long stick&#x27; that had a very similar form to an ice hockey stick, although it was considerably smaller at around long and required two hands to hold and use it. The &#x27;long stick&#x27; version of the game that was played largely in the southern hemisphere eventually gave way to the more widely played &#x27;short stick&#x27; version and since about 1980, the year of the first UWH World Championship, the original &#x27;short stick&#x27; game has been played universally around the world.

== Other uses of the term ==
In the cha-cha and rhumba dancing, the &quot;hockey stick&quot; is a figure in which the dancer moves along a straight line, with an angled turn at the end.

On aircraft liveries, a Hockey stick is a cheatline – a line that extends along the side of an aircraft – which turns up at the end and goes up the tailfin.

<text>Peter&#x27;s Pence (or Denarii Sancti Petri and &quot;Alms of St Peter&quot;) are donations or payments made directly to the Holy See of the Catholic Church. The practice began under the Saxons in England and spread through Europe. Both before and after the Norman conquest the practice varied by time and place: initially, it was given as a pious contribution, whereas later it was required by various rulers and collected like a tax. Though formally discontinued in England at the time of the Reformation, a post-Reformation payment of uncertain character was seen in some English manors into the 19th century. In 1871, Pope Pius IX formalized the practice of lay members of the church and &quot;other persons of good will&quot; providing financial support to the Roman See. Modern &quot;Peter&#x27;s Pence&quot; proceeds are used by the Pope for philanthropic works throughout the world and for administrative costs of the Vatican state.

== Medieval payment (1031–1555)==
The term Peter&#x27;s pence, in its Latin form, first appeared in writing in 1031. However, the payment may not have had a single origin under the Saxons. It was applied by the Normans to Ireland as a &#x27;penny per hearth&#x27; annual tax in the later part of the twelfth century under the Papal Bull &quot;Laudabiliter&quot;. The traditional scholarly view is summarized in Jacob&#x27;s &quot;Law Dictionary&quot;. Otherwise called by Saxons the &quot;Romefeoh&quot; (the fee due to Rome), it was a tribute, or rather an alms, given by Ina, King of the West Saxons, on his pilgrimage to Rome in 725. A similar &quot;contribution&quot; was also collected by Offa, King of the Mercians, throughout his dominions, in 794. However, it was said to be not a tribute to the pope, but for the maintenance of the English School or College at Rome. It was called Peter&#x27;s pence because a penny from every house (subject to a means test) was collected on 1 August, the feast day of St. Peter ad Vincula. The penny of Offa was a small silver coin. King Edgar’s laws contained a sharp Constitution touching this money (Leg. Edg 78 c 4)

Some sources give the Anglo-Saxon term &quot;Romescot&quot; instead of &quot;Romefeoh&quot;.

The Offa story is elaborated in later accounts of unknown reliability:

Ethelbert, king of the East Angles, having reigned single some time, thought fit to take a wife; for this purpose he came to the court of Offa, king of Mercia, to desire his daughter in marriage. Cynethryth, consort of Offa, a cruel, ambitious, and blood-thirsty woman, who envied the retinue and splendor of the unsuspicious king, resolved in some manner to have him murdered, before he left their court, hoping by that to gain his immense riches; for this purpose she, with her malicious and fascinating arts, overcame the king–her husband, which she most cunningly effected, and, under deep disguises, laid open to him her portentous design; a villain was therefore hired, named Gimberd, who was to murder the innocent prince.

The manner in which the heinous crime was effected was as cowardly as it was fatal: under the chair of state in which Ethelbert sat, a deep pit was dug; at the bottom of it was placed the murderer; the unfortunate king was then let through a trap-door into the pit; his fear overcame him so much, that he did not attempt resistance. Three months after this, Queenrid died, when circumstances convinced Offa of the innocence of Ethelbert; he, therefore, to appease his guilt, built St. Alban&#x27;s monastery, gave one-tenth part of his goods to the poor, and went in penance to Rome, where he gave to the Pope a penny for every house in his dominions.
The earliest documentary evidence concerning these payments is found in a letter written from Rome by King Canute to the English clergy in 1031. At that time, Canute was collecting a levy of one penny on each hearth or household, using a means test requiring that the household have an annual rental cost of thirty pence or more; households paying less than that in rent were exempt.

Over time, the payment came to be regarded as a tax rather than an offering, and payment was apt to be avoided, if possible, the more so as time went on. Indeed, in the 13th century, the revenue arising from it had been stabilized, on the basis of the assessment of a much earlier day, at the annual sum of £20 1s. 9d for the whole of England. Pope Clement V pressed to return to the more rewarding ancient basis of a penny from each sufficient household. By the 14th century, a standard sum, typically 5s. per manor or parish, was being given to local church authorities for forwarding. It appears that new tenants entering on a property which had historically been subject to a Peter&#x27;s Pence levy did not always accept the obligation to pay.

Older sources are often unclear in their references to Peter&#x27;s Pence, and there was (and remains) a degree of local confusion between it, various hearth taxes (sometimes called smoke-money or smoke-farthings), and other ancient payments.

By the end of the 12th century, the English population had increased, so the ecclesiastical authorities were collecting more than the stabilized sum, and keeping the surplus.

It ceased to be remitted to the pope after 1320, but seemingly this was not permanent. The exact reason for the &#x27;prohibition&#x27; by Edward III is unknown, but the threat of withholding payment of Peter&#x27;s Pence proved more than once a useful weapon against uncooperative popes in the hands of English kings. In 1366 and for some years after, it was refused on the grounds of the pope&#x27;s obstinacy. Evidently, however, the payment survived or was revived in some localities, because it was one of many payments abolished by an Act of Parliament in the 25th year of Henry VIII&#x27;s reign. The 1534 Act, &quot;An Act for the exoneration of exactions paid to the See of Rome&quot;, specifically mentions Peter&#x27;s Pence. Along with other payments, it was &quot;never more to be levied … to any person&quot;, indicating that the payment was to be extinguished completely and not diverted to crown use. This occurred just prior to Henry&#x27;s permanent break from the Church, which occurred in 1536, making England part of the Protestant Reformation.

However, under the Catholic Queen Mary, Henry VIII&#x27;s reformation legislation was overturned. On 16 January 1555, royal assent was given to &quot;An Act, repealing all Statutes, Articles, and Provisions, made against the See of Rome, sithence the 20th Year of King Henry the Eighth; and for the Establishment of Ecclesiastical Possessions conveyed to the Laity&quot; (1 &amp; 2 Philip &amp; Mary c.8). However, this act did not mention Peter&#x27;s Pence specifically. There is isolated evidence that in some parishes, payment of Peter&#x27;s Pence did indeed resume during Mary&#x27;s reign, for instance in Rowington, Warwickshire, where the church accounts for 1556 record the collection of 54s. 4d., a considerable sum. Mary&#x27;s Act was in turn repealed by the 1559 Act of Supremacy, under the Protestant Queen Elizabeth I.

== Post-Reformation practice in England ==

Despite the unequivocal abolition called for by the 1559 Act, payments termed Peter&#x27;s Pence undoubtedly continued in England in the succeeding centuries. In one Devon parish, there is a record regarding 1609–1610 that states &quot;besides 2s. for Peter&#x27;s farthings there is a payment of 2s. for Peter&#x27;s pence&quot;. In Gloucestershire, a survey of the then royal manor of Cheltenham in 1617 asked tenants, &quot;whether there is not duly continued and paid certain moneys called peter pence; if not when did they discontinue and what was the sum of them and to whom was it paid?&quot; This question indicates that at the least, Gloucester recognized that practices varied. The reply given was that, &quot;the moneys called Peter Pence are commonly every year paid unto the Bailiff and are not discontinued to their knowledge, and the sum of them by the year is 5s. or thereabouts, as they think&quot;. This suggests that originally some 60 households contributed annually. The survey makes no mention of when in the year the payment was made, and whether the bailiff passed the money on or retained it on the lord&#x27;s behalf. (Pre-Reformation practice in Cheltenham had called for payment—invariably of 5s.—on the accustomed date of 1 August, as above.) In Cheltenham manorial records, occasional references to properties being liable for Peter&#x27;s Pence are seen until as late as 1802, but there is no direct evidence of any actual payment.

An Act of Parliament obtained in 1625 to clarify manorial customs in Cheltenham acknowledges the continued existence of Peter&#x27;s Pence: &quot;And be it enacted … that the said copyholders … shall … hold the said customary messuages and lands of the said manors severally and respectively, by copies of court-roll to them and their heirs, by suit of court, and by the yearly rents, worksilver, Peter-pence, and Bead Reap-money, to be paid severally and respectively as heretofore…&quot;

It is uncertain how exceptional the situation in Cheltenham may have been. It is possible that the label Peter&#x27;s Pence had been transferred to some other type of household or hearth tax. Some evidence for this comes from references in Minchinhampton (Gloucestershire) churchwardens&#x27; accounts of 1575 to &quot;Peter-pence or smoke-farthings&quot; expended at the time of the bishop&#x27;s visitation in the summer. Smoke-farthings are glossed as a composition for offerings made in Whitsun week by every man who occupied a house with a chimney, to the cathedral of the diocese in which he lived; and that though Peter&#x27;s pence was abolished in 1534, &quot;on the grant of those monasteries to whom they had by custom become payable, they continued payable as appendant to the manors etc of the persons to whom granted&quot;. Before the Reformation, the lordship of the manor of Cheltenham had been held by the Abbess of Syon. It is plausible therefore that as both the pious payment of Peter&#x27;s Pence and the secular manorial fees had once gone to the same institution, the former came over time to be regarded as part of the latter.

== Revived custom ==
In 1871, Pope Pius IX formalized the practice of lay members of Church and &quot;other persons of good will&quot; – providing financial support directly to the Papal Treasury. In general, contributions go to the local parish or diocese, who then provide contributions to support higher level offices. Collections for Peter&#x27;s Pence go directly to Rome. Pius IX approved this practice in the encyclical &quot;Saepe venerabilis&quot;, issued on 5 August 1871. The money collected is today used by the pope for philanthropic purposes.

At present, this collection is taken each year on the Sunday closest to 29 June, the Solemnity of the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul in the liturgical calendar. , the United States has donated the largest amounts, giving some 28% of the total, followed by Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Brazil and South Korea. US donations totaled $75.8 million in 2008, $82.5 million in 2009, $67.7 million in 2010 and $69.7 million in 2011.

==Finances==
In 2019, it was revealed that the charity had secretly been used by people within the Vatican to buy luxury property in London and to finance movies such as the 2019 Elton John biopic &quot;Rocketman&quot;. It has also been used to finance the budget deficit of the Holy See. As a partial justification for this, Gladden Pappin and Edoardo Bueri, two commentators in the University of Notre Dame&#x27;s &quot;Church Life Journal,&quot; have argued that, “without significant territory in which to invest its assets for the good of residents, the Holy See has to engage in the normal investing operations that other sovereign states do.”

<doc id="316798" wikidata="Q512276" url="?curid=316798" title="Temperature record of the last 2,000 years">
<text>The temperature record of the last 2,000 years is reconstructed using data from climate proxy records in conjunction with the modern instrumental temperature record which only covers the last 170 years at a global scale. Large-scale reconstructions covering part or all of the 1st millennium and 2nd millennium have shown that recent temperatures are exceptional: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report of 2007 concluded that &quot;Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were &quot;very likely&quot; higher than during any other 50-year period in the last 500 years and &quot;likely&quot; the highest in at least the past 1,300 years.&quot; The curve shown in graphs of these reconstructions is widely known as the hockey stick graph because of the sharp increase in temperatures during the last century. this broad pattern was supported by more than two dozen reconstructions, using various statistical methods and combinations of proxy records, with variations in how flat the pre-20th-century &quot;shaft&quot; appears. Sparseness of proxy records results in considerable uncertainty for earlier periods.

Individual proxy records, such as tree ring widths and densities used in dendroclimatology, are calibrated against the instrumental record for the period of overlap. Networks of such records are used to reconstruct past temperatures for regions: tree ring proxies have been used to reconstruct Northern Hemisphere extratropical temperatures (within the tropics trees do not form rings) but are confined to land areas and are scarce in the Southern Hemisphere which is largely ocean. Wider coverage is provided by multiproxy reconstructions, incorporating proxies such as lake sediments, ice cores and corals which are found in different regions, and using statistical methods to relate these sparser proxies to the greater numbers of tree ring records. The &quot;Composite Plus Scaling&quot; (CPS) method is widely used for large-scale multiproxy reconstructions of hemispheric or global average temperatures; this is complemented by Climate Field Reconstruction (CFR) methods which show how climate patterns have developed over large spatial areas, making the reconstruction useful for investigating natural variability and long-term oscillations as well as for comparisons with patterns produced by climate models.

During the 1,900 years before the 20th century, it is likely that the next warmest period was from 950 to 1100, with peaks at different times in different regions. This has been called the Medieval Warm Period, and some evidence suggests widespread cooler conditions during a period around the 17th century known as the Little Ice Age. In the &quot;hockey stick controversy&quot;, climate change deniers have asserted that the Medieval Warm Period was warmer than at present, and have disputed the data and methods of climate reconstructions.

== Temperature change in the last 2,000 years ==
According to IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, in the last 170 years, humans have caused the global temperature to increase to the highest level in the last 2,000 years. The current multi-century period is the warmest in the past 100,000 years. The temperature in the years 2011-2020 was 1.09 °C higher than in 1859–1890. The temperature on land rose by 1.59 °C while over the ocean it rose by 0.88 °C. In 2020 the temperature was 1.2 °C above the pre-industrial era. In September 2023 the temperature was 1.75 °C above pre-industrial level and during the entire year of 2023 is expected to be 1.4 °C above it.

== General techniques and accuracy ==

By far the best observed period is from 1850 to the present day, with coverage improving over time. Over this period the recent instrumental record, mainly based on direct thermometer readings, has approximately global coverage. It shows a general warming in global temperatures.

Before this time various proxies must be used. These proxies are less accurate than direct thermometer measurements, have lower temporal resolution, and have less spatial coverage. Their only advantage is that they enable a longer record to be reconstructed. Since the direct temperature record is more accurate than the proxies (indeed, it is needed to calibrate them) it is used when available: i.e., from 1850 onwards.

===Quantitative methods using proxy data===
As there are few instrumental records before 1850, temperatures before then must be reconstructed based on proxy methods. One such method, based on principles of dendroclimatology, uses the width and other characteristics of tree rings to infer temperature. The isotopic composition of snow, corals, and stalactites can also be used to infer temperature. Other techniques which have been used include examining records of the time of crop harvests, the treeline in various locations, and other historical records to make inferences about the temperature. These proxy reconstructions are indirect inferences of temperature and thus tend to have greater uncertainty than instrumental data.

Most proxy records have to be calibrated against local temperature records during their period of overlap, to estimate the relationship between temperature and the proxy. The longer history of the proxy is then used to reconstruct temperature from earlier periods.

Proxy records must be averaged in some fashion if a global or hemispheric record is desired. The &quot;Composite Plus Scaling&quot; (CPS) method is widely used for large-scale multiproxy reconstructions of hemispheric or global average temperatures. This is complemented by Climate Field Reconstruction (CFR) methods which show how climate patterns have developed over large spatial areas.

Considerable care must be taken in the averaging process; for example, if a certain region has a large number of tree ring records, a simple average of all the data would strongly over-weight that region, and statistical techniques are used to avoid such over-weighting. In the and CFR reconstructions, principal components analysis was used to combine some of these regional records before they were globally combined. An important distinction is between so-called &#x27;multi-proxy&#x27; reconstructions, which attempt to obtain a global temperature reconstruction by using multiple proxy records distributed over the globe and more regional reconstructions. Usually, the various proxy records are combined arithmetically, in some weighted average. More recently, Osborn and Briffa used a simpler technique, counting the proportion of records that are positive, negative or neutral in any time period. This produces a result in general agreement with
the conventional multi-proxy studies.

The 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report cited 14 reconstructions, 10 of which covered 1,000 years or longer, to support its conclusion that &quot;Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were very likely higher than during any other 50-year period in the last 500 years and likely the highest in at least the past 1,300 years&quot;.

===Qualitative reconstruction using historical records===

It is also possible to use historical data such as times of grape harvests, sea-ice-free periods in harbours and diary entries of frost or heatwaves to produce indications of when it was warm or cold in particular regions. These records are harder to calibrate, are often only available sparsely through time, may be available only from developed regions, and are unlikely to come with good error estimates. These historical observations of the same time period show periods of both warming and cooling.

===Limitations ===

The apparent differences between the quantitative and qualitative approaches are not fully reconciled. The reconstructions mentioned above rely on various assumptions to generate their results. If these assumptions do not hold, the reconstructions would be unreliable. For quantitative reconstructions, the most fundamental assumptions are that proxy records vary with temperature and that non-temperature factors do not confound the results. In the historical records temperature fluctuations may be regional rather than hemispheric in scale.

In a letter to &quot;Nature&quot; pointed at the original title of their 1998 article: &quot;Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the past millennium: inferences, uncertainties, and limitations&quot; and pointed out more widespread high-resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached and that the uncertainties were the point of the article.

==History==
In the 1960s, Hubert Lamb generalised from historical documents and temperature records of central England to propose a Medieval Warm Period in the North Atlantic region, followed by Little Ice Age. This was discussed in the IPCC First Assessment Report with cautions that the medieval warming might not have been global. Using proxy indicators for quantitative estimates of past temperature record had developed sporadically from the 1930s onwards, and introduced the &quot;Composite Plus Scaling&quot; (CPS) method. Their reconstruction back to 1400 featured in the IPCC Second Assessment Report.

The Michael E. Mann, Raymond S. Bradley and Malcolm K. Hughes reconstruction (, MBH98) showed global patterns of annual surface temperature, and average hemispheric temperatures back to 1400 with emphasising on uncertainties.

 independently produced a CPS reconstruction extending back for a thousand years, and (MBH99) used the MBH98 methodology to extend their study back to 1000. The term hockey stick was used by the climatologist Jerry Mahlman to describe the pattern this showed, envisaging a graph that is relatively flat to 1900 as forming an ice hockey stick&#x27;s &quot;shaft&quot;, followed by a sharp increase corresponding to the &quot;blade&quot;.

A version of the MBH99 graph was featured prominently in the 2001 IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR), which also drew on Jones et al. 1998 and three other reconstructions to support the conclusion that, in the Northern Hemisphere, the 1990s was likely to have been the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year during the past 1,000 years. The graph was featured in publicity, and became a focus of dispute for those opposed to the strengthening scientific consensus that late 20th century warmth was exceptional.

In 2003, as lobbying over the 1997 Kyoto Protocol intensified, efforts by the Bush administration to remove climate reconstructions from the first Environmental Protection Agency and Jim Inhofe&#x27;s Senate speech claiming that man-made global warming is a hoax both drew on the Soon and Baliunas controversy. Later in 2003, Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick published disputing data in the MBH98 paper, but their argument was refuted. In 2004 Hans von Storch said that the MBH98 statistical techniques understated variability, but he erred in saying this undermined the overall graph. In 2005 McIntyre and McKitrick criticised the principal components analysis methodology in MBH98 and MBH99, but and pointed to errors made by McIntyre and McKitrick. The National Research Council North Report in 2006 supported MBH with minor caveats. The Wegman Report supported McIntyre and McKitrick&#x27;s study, but was subsequently discredited. Arguments against the MBH studies were reintroduced as part of the Climatic Research Unit email controversy, but dismissed by eight independent investigations.

The test in science is whether findings can be replicated using different data and methods. More than two dozen reconstructions, using various statistical methods and combinations of proxy records, have supported the broad consensus shown in the original 1998 hockey-stick graph, with variations in how flat the pre-20th century &quot;shaft&quot; appears. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5 WG1) of 2013 examined temperature variations during the last two millennia, and concluded that for average annual Northern Hemisphere temperatures, &quot;the period 1983–2012 was &quot;very likely&quot; the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years (&quot;high confidence&quot;) and &quot;likely&quot; the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years (&quot;medium confidence&quot;)&quot;.

<doc id="316803" wikidata="Q5187977" url="?curid=316803" title="Croppies Lie Down">
<text>&quot;Croppies Lie Down&quot; is a British folk song, dating from the 1798 rebellion in Ireland, that celebrates the defeat of the Irish rebels. The author has been reported as George Watson-Taylor.

This song illustrates the deep divisions which existed in Ireland at the time of the 1798 rebellion. Irish Catholics, and to a lesser extent Dissenters, were legally excluded from political and economic life. The Kingdom of Great Britain was at war with revolutionary France at the time, and Irish republicans were encouraged by rumours that France would invade the island. The lyrics describe the rebels as treacherous cowards and those fighting them as brave defenders of the innocent. &quot;Croppies&quot; meant people with closely cropped hair, a fashion associated with the French revolutionaries, in contrast to the wigs favoured by the aristocracy. In George Borrow&#x27;s 1862 travel book &quot;Wild Wales&quot;, the author comes upon an itinerant Irish fiddler and asks him to play the tune.

== Lyrics ==
&quot;We soldiers of Erin, so proud of the name,
We&#x27;ll raise on the rebels and Frenchmen our fame;
We&#x27;ll fight to the last in the honest old cause,
And guard our religion, our freedom and laws;
We&#x27;ll fight for our country, our King and his crown,
And make all the traitors and croppies lie down.
Down, down, croppies lie down.

The rebels so bold, when they&#x27;ve none to oppose,
To houses and haystacks are terrible foes;
They murder poor parsons and likewise their wives,
At the sight of a soldier they run for their lives;
Whenever we march over country and town
In ditches and cellars the croppies lie down.
Down, down, croppies lie down.

In Dublin the traitors were ready to rise
And murder was seen in their lowering eyes
With poison, the cowards, they aimed to succeed
And thousands were doomed by the assassins to bleed
But the yeoman advanced, of rebels the dread
And each croppy soon hid his dastardly head
Down, down, croppies lie down.

Should France e&#x27;er attempt, by fraud or by guile,
Her forces to land on Erin&#x27;s green isle,
We&#x27;ll show that they n&#x27;er can make free soldiers, slaves,
They shall only possess our green fields for their graves;
Our country&#x27;s applauses our triumphs will crown,
Whilst with their French brothers the croppies lie down.
Down, down, croppies lie down.

Oh, croppies ye&#x27;d better be quiet and still
Ye shan&#x27;t have your liberty, do what ye will
As long as salt water is formed in the deep
A foot on the necks of the croppy we&#x27;ll keep
And drink, as in bumpers past troubles we drown,
A health to the lads that made croppies lie down
Down, down, croppies lie down.&quot;

<text>&quot;Lillibullero&quot; (also spelt Lillibulero, Lilliburlero, or Lilli Burlero) is a march attributed to Henry Purcell that became popular in England at the time of the Glorious Revolution of 1688.

== Background ==

Henry Purcell is alleged to have composed the melody of &quot;Lillibulero&quot; for a march in 1686, but this is still disputed:

LILLBURLERO. A 17th-century party tune ... It has been attributed to Henry Purcell, but whether Purcell composed the melody or only fitted the bass is a question not finally settled.

The melody is found in the second half of Purcell&#x27;s piece, the quickstep. There is no extant manuscript of this 1686 march. It was first published that year in &quot;The Delightful Companion&quot;, John Playford&#x27;s method book for recorder. Writing over 200 years later, William Chappell surmised that Purcell&#x27;s tune deserves nine-tenths of the credit for the popularity of the song.
Also in 1686, Thomas, Lord Wharton composed lyrics for Purcell&#x27;s tune. The rakish Wharton was satirizing King James II&#x27;s appointment of Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell as Lord Deputy of Ireland. Wharton&#x27;s conceit is a sarcastic conversation between two Irishmen about the imminent arrival of the Catholic Talbot, and its dire implications for the Protestants. &quot;Lilliburlero&quot; (with &quot;-rl&quot;) was the watchword used by Irish Catholics during the Irish Rebellion of 1641.

The song initially made very little impression on the public. However, when James II began transferring Irish regiments to England in 1688, broadsides of the lyrics were printed, and &quot;Lillibullero&quot; became immensely popular by October. It spread as a popular street song in English towns, and especially inside English barracks to mock the arriving Irish regiments.

The next month, William of Orange invaded, and &quot;Lillibullero&quot; became even more commonplace. Even the palace guards supposedly loyal to James II were heard singing it. A second part was published to the song as William advanced. The language of the second part is even rougher as two Irish soldiers stationed in England pine for home since the English hate them anyway.

Wharton boasted that he had &quot;sung a deluded Prince out of three kingdoms&quot;. Many alternate versions cropped up during these tumultuous days. By 17 November an anti-Dutch parody of the original, &quot;A New Song Upon the Hogen Mogens&quot; was in circulation, drawing on popular animosity against the Dutch, who had been the national enemy for a generation, to counter the original&#x27;s appeal.

==Lyrics==
&quot;&quot;Lillibullero bullen a la&quot; is repeated after every line in each verse. Those repetitions are omitted after the first verse here to save space.&quot;

===Meaning===
The first Irish Roman Catholic to serve as Lord Deputy of Ireland in nearly 200 years, Talbot quickly filled the army in Ireland with Catholic officers (hence &quot;we will have commissions galore&quot;) and recruits, alarming the Protestants and raising the hopes of the Irish Catholic community for a restoration of their lands and political power (&quot;by Christ and St Patrick, the nation&#x27;s our own&quot;). The Catholic resurgence created fears amongst Irish Protestants of a massacre, similar to that which had happened in the Irish Rebellion of 1641.

The song parodies the widespread Irish belief in prophecy (&quot;there was an old prophecy found in a bog, that Ireland&#x27;d be ruled by an ass and a dog&quot;). Talbot, as well as being a name, is a breed of hound or hunting dog. A common theme of such prophecies was that the foreigners would be driven out of Ireland in some decisive battle. See the Siege of Limerick for an example of these attitudes. The song&#x27;s title and the words of the refrain have been interpreted as a garbled version of the Irish words &quot;An Lile ba léir é, ba linn an lá&quot;, &quot;The Lily was everywhere and ours was the day (i.e., we won
)&quot;. The lily may be a reference to the fleur de lis of France, or to the most celebrated astrologer of the mid-seventeenth century, William Lilly, who became well known for prophesy at this time and to whom could readily be attributed foreknowledge that a Catholic would be king of England. Alternatively, the lyrics could mean, &quot;Lilly is clear [about this], the day will be ours&quot;.
It is also thought that &quot;Lilli&quot; is a familiar form of William, and that bullero comes from the Irish &quot;Buaill Léir ó&quot;, which gives: &quot;William defeated all that remained&quot;.

Professor Breandán Ó Buachalla has claimed that they are a garbled version of the Irish sentence &quot;Leir o, Leir o, leir o, leiro, Lilli bu leir o: bu linn an la, &quot; which he translates as &quot;Manifest, manifest, manifest, manifest, Lilly will be manifest, the day will be ours&quot; referring to a possible prophecy of an Irish victory by the astrologer William Lilly.

===&quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;===

Purcell&#x27;s music provided the tune for the highwayman Macheath&#x27;s satire on modern society in John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, which first premiered in 1728, using popular folk tunes for its score. Here, the lyrics are:

&lt;poem&gt;The Modes of the Court so common are grown,
That a true Friend can hardly be met;
Friendship for Interest is but a Loan,
Which they let out for what they can get.
&#x27;Tis true, you find
Some Friends so kind,
Who will give you good Counsel themselves to defend.
In sorrowful Ditty,
They promise, they pity,
But shift for your Money, from Friend to Friend.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Protestant Boys===
One of the best-known parodies of &quot;Lillibullero&quot; is the Ulster Protestant folk lyric called &quot;Protestant Boys&quot;. The song is played by flute bands accompanying the Orange Order during Orange or band-only parades, which have been the subject of controversy during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

There are two versions of &quot;Protestant Boys&quot;, both sung to the tune of &quot;Lillibullero&quot;. They begin as follows:
:Version 1
:The Protestant Boys are loyal and true
:Stout hearted in battle and stout-handed too
:The Protestant Boys are true to the last
:And faithful and peaceful when danger has passed
:And Oh! they bear and proudly wear
:The colours that floated o&#x27;er many a fray
:Where cannon were flashing
:And sabres were clashing
:The Protestant Boys still carried the day.

:Version 2
:Tel me, my friends, why are we met here?
:Why thus assembled, ye Protestant Boys?
:Do mirth and good liquor, good humour, good cheer,
:Call us to share of festivity&#x27;s joys?
:Oh, no! &#x27;tis the cause,
:Of king – freedom – and laws,
:That calls loyal Protestants now to unite;
:And Orange and Blue,
:Ever faithful and true,
:Our king shall support, and sedition a fright.
===Nottingham Ale===
&quot;Nottingham Ale&quot; is an English drinking song sung to the tune of &quot;Lillibullero&quot;.

The historian Blackner relates that a person of the name Gunthorpe, who within memory of persons then living [1815] kept the PunchBowl public house in Peck Lane Nottingham, sent a barrel of ale of his own brewing as a present to his brother, an officer in the navy, who in return composed this poetic epistle. It appears to have been a popular song around the end of the 18th century and was one which Goldsmith enjoyed especially when sung by one of the comic singers who frequented one of his haunts in London.

It was sung at the launching ceremony of the &quot;Nottingham&quot;, an East Indiaman, on 7 March 1787, at the Clevey&#x27;s yard Gravesend. The ship was 1152 tons and had a crew of 144 and was one of the largest and fastest ever built.
:Fair Venus, the goddess of beauty and love
:Arose from the froth which swam on the sea
:Minerva leapt out of the cranium of Jove
:A coy, sullen slut, as most authors agree
:Bold Bacchus, they tell us, the prince of good fellas
:Was a natural son, pray attend to my tale
:And they that thus chatter, mistake quite the matter
:He sprung from a barrel of Nottingham Ale!

::Nottingham Ale, boys, Nottingham Ale
::No liquor on earth is like Nottingham Ale!
::Nottingham Ale, boys, Nottingham Ale
::No liquor on earth like Nottingham Ale!

:And having survey&#x27;d well the cask whence he sprung
:For want of more liquor, low spirited grew
:He mounted astride to the jolly cask clung
:And away to the gods and the goddess flew
:But when he look&#x27;d down and saw the fair town
:To pay it due honours, not likely to fail
:He swore that on earth &#x27;twas the town of his birth
:And the best – and no liquor like Nottingham ale
:Ye bishops and deacons, priests, curates and vicars
:When once you have tasted, you&#x27;ll own it is true
:That Nottingham Ale, it&#x27;s the best of all liquors
:And who understands the good creature like you
:It expels every vapour, saves pen, ink and paper
:And when you&#x27;re disposed from the pulpit to rail
:T&#x27;will open your throats, you may preach without notes
:When inspired with a bumper of Nottingham Ale

:Ye doctors who more execution have done
:With powder and bolus, with potion and pill
:Than hangman with halter, or soldier with gun
:Than miser with famine, a lawyer with quill
:To dispatch us the quicker, you forbid us malt liquor
:Till our bodies consume and our faces grow pale
:But mind it what pleases and cures all diseases
:Is a comfortable dose of good Nottingham Ale

:Ye poets, who brag of the Helicon brook
:The nectar of gods, and the juice of the vine
:You say none can write well, except they invoke
:The friendly assistance of one of the nine
:Hers liquor surpasses the stream of Parnassus
:The nectar Ambrosia, on which gods regale
:Experience will show it, nought makes a good poet
:Like quantum sufficit of Nottingham ale
===Overtures from Richmond===
Yet another set of lyrics set to the tune at the time of the American Civil War is attributed to the ballad scholar Francis J. Child, born in Boston in 1825. It is a satire on Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy, and perhaps refers to the Hampton Roads Conference.
:&quot;Well, Uncle Sam,&quot; says Jefferson D.,
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;You&#x27;ll have to join my Confed&#x27;racy,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam.
:&quot;Lero, lero, that don&#x27;t appear-o,
:That don&#x27;t appear,&quot; says old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;Lero, lero, filibustero,
:That don&#x27;t appear,&quot; says old Uncle Sam.

:&quot;So, Uncle Sam, just lay down your arms,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;Then you shall hear my reas&#x27;nable terms,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam.
:&quot;Lero, lero, I&#x27;d like to hear-o
:I&#x27;d like to hear,&quot; says old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;Lero, lero, filibustero,
:I&#x27;d like to hear,&quot; says old Uncle Sam.

:&quot;First you must own I&#x27;ve beat you in a fight,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;then that I always have been in the right,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam.
:&quot;Lero, lero, rather severe-o,
:rather severe,&quot; says old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;Lero, lero, filibustero,
:Rather severe,&quot; says old Uncle Sam.

:&quot;Then you must pay my national debts,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;No questions asked about my assets,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam.
:&quot;Lero, lero, that&#x27;s very dear-o,
:That&#x27;s very dear,&quot; says old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;Lero, lero, filibustero,
:That&#x27;s very dear,&quot; says old Uncle Sam.

:&quot;Also some few IOUs and bets,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;Mine, and Bob Toombs&#x27;, and Sidell&#x27;s and Rhett&#x27;s,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam.
:&quot;Lero, lero, that leaves me zero,
:That leaves me zero,&quot; says Uncle Sam,
:&quot;Lero, lero, filibustero,
:That leaves me zero,&quot; says Uncle Sam.

:&quot;And by the way, one little thing more,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;You&#x27;re to refund the costs of the war,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam.
:&quot;Lero, lero, just what I fear-o,
:Just what I fear,&quot; says old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;Lero, lero, filibustero,
:Just what I fear,&quot; says old Uncle Sam.

:&quot;Next you must own our Cavalier blood!&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;And that your Puritans sprang from the mud!&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam.
:&quot;Lero, lero, that mud is clear-o,
:That mud is clear,&quot; says old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;Lero, lero, filibustero,
:That mud is clear,&quot; says old Uncle Sam.

:&quot;Slavery&#x27;s, of course, the chief corner-stone,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;Of our new civilisation!&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam.
:&quot;Lero, lero, that&#x27;s quite sincere-o,
:That&#x27;s quite sincere,&quot; says old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;Lero, lero, filibustero,
:That&#x27;s quite sincere,&quot; says old Uncle Sam.

:&quot;You&#x27;ll understand, my recreant tool,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;You&#x27;re to submit, and we are to rule,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam.
:&quot;Lero, lero, aren&#x27;t you a hero!
:Aren&#x27;t you a hero,&quot; says Uncle Sam,
:&quot;Lero, lero, filibustero,
:Aren&#x27;t you a hero,&quot; says Uncle Sam.

:&quot;If to these terms you fully consent,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;I&#x27;ll be perpetual King-President,&quot;
:Lilliburlero, old Uncle Sam.
:&quot;Lero, lero, take your sombrero,
:Off to your swamps,&quot; says old Uncle Sam,
:&quot;Lero, lero, filibustero,
:Cut, double quick!&quot; says old Uncle Sam.
===The Farmer&#x27;s Curst Wife===
In recent times, the melody and refrain of &quot;Lillibullero&quot; are frequently paired with lyrics from the ballad &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Curst Wife&quot;. The lyrics tell the story of a ploughman&#x27;s wife who is taken away to Hell by the Devil, but is subsequently returned to Earth due to her violent acts against demons.

Lyrics from &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Curst Wife&quot; were used in the version of &quot;Lillibullero&quot; recorded by Bellowhead in their 2012 album &quot;Broadside&quot;, and in the version recorded by the band The City Waites in their 1976 self-titled album.

===There Was an Old Woman===
The 19th-century nursery rhyme &quot;There Was an Old Woman Tossed Up in a Basket&quot;, published in the collection &quot;Mother Goose&quot; has also been sung to this tune.

===My Thing Is My Own===
The 18th-century ballad &quot;My Thing Is My Own,&quot; a racy ballad about a young woman and the various seducers she&#x27;s resisted, is sung to the tune of &quot;Lilliburlero,&quot; for example on the &quot;Renaissance Album&quot; by Ann Wilson and her sister Nancy Wilson (rock musician).

A version published in 1707 has twelve verses, including these:

:I, a tender young Maid have been courted by many,
:Of all sorts and Trades as ever was any:
:A spruce Haberdasher first spake me fair,
:But I would have nothing to do with Small ware.
:My Thing is my own, and I’ll keep it so still,
:Yet other young Lasses may do what they will.

:A sweet scented Courtier did give me a Kiss,
:And promis’d me Mountains if I would be his,
:But I’ll not believe him, for it is too true,
:Some Courtiers do promise much more than they do.
:My Thing is my own, and I’ll keep it so still,
:Yet other young Lasses may do what they will.

:A Master of Music came with an intent,
:To give me a Lesson on my Instrument,
:I thank’d him for nothing, but bid him be gone,
:For my little Fiddle should not be played on.
:My thing is my own, and I’ll keep it so still,
:Yet other young Lasses may do what they will.

:A blunt Lieutenant surprised my Placket,
:And fiercely began to rifle and sack it,
:I mustered my Spirits up and became bold,
:And forced my Lieutenant to quit his strong hold.
:My thing is my own, and I’ll keep it so still,
:Yet other young Lasses may do what they will.

:Now here I could reckon a hundred and more,
:Besides all the Gamesters recited before,
:That made their addresses in hopes of a snap
:But as young as I was, I understood Trap.
:My thing is my own, and I’ll keep it so still,
:Until I be Married, say Men what they will.

==In popular culture==
===Broadcasting===
&quot;Lillibullero&quot; was adopted by the British Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s World War II programme &quot;Into Battle&quot; and became the unofficial march of the Commandos of the British Army. Since its association with the BBC&#x27;s role in the war, various recordings of &quot;Lillibullero&quot; have been played by the BBC as an interval signal. These include a marching band and a symphony orchestra.

David Cox arranged the version used for over 30 years. During the 1970s a rousing recording by the band of HM Royal Marines used just before the BBC World Service News on the hour was replaced by a weaker and quieter version by a brass ensemble, on the grounds that the band record had worn out. However, the Marines version was later reinstated. The most recent recording, written by David Arnold and performed by a string orchestra, was until recently played on the World Service several times a day. A shortened version is currently sometimes played just before each hour before the news.

A well-regarded argument for the persistence of Lillibullero as a signature tune of the BBC World Service was that its powerful and simple structure was an effective means of identifying the broadcaster. The engineers who selected it were unaware of its origins, though a BBC World Service history states that the choice of interval theme at the time was that of &quot;the transmission engineers who found it particularly audible through short wave mush, and anyway [the BBC] knew it as a tune for the old English song &#x27;There was an old woman tossed up in a blanket, 20 times as high as the moon&#x27;. Another likely reason for the particular choice of this tune during World War II is that its beginning bars sound the &#x27;Victory V&#x27; rhythm (dit dit dit dah, repeated) i.e. the letter V in Morse code, which was used in various forms by the BBC in its home and foreign services.&quot;

The recently initiated BBC Persian TV service makes use of a re-mixed version of Lillibullero as the title theme for its music programmes. Both the music magazine and music documentaries have cuts of the tune with Persian instrumental influence. It was also used for the BBC World Service Television service broadcast in Europe and Asia during the early 1990s.

===Military===
Lillibullero is the (official) Regimental March of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (abbrev. REME). This Corps was established during the Second World War and so the BBC&#x27;s official wartime use of Lillibullero described above may well have played a part in its selection by REME, but it seems more likely that the BBC&#x27;s reliance on REME for its wartime development and coverage led to the BBC adopting the march about that time as a signature tune (as mentioned previously). This is borne out by the fact that the melody had long been in use in military music, and that the foundation of REME is inextricably associated with many of those regiments.
Lillibullero is also the official March of the Corps of Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (abbrev. RAEME) together with &quot;Boys in the Backroom&quot;.

===Fiction===
Laurence Sterne&#x27;s experimental and comic novel &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, prints the score to &quot;Lillibullero&quot; at the end of Chapter 17 in Book 9 after Tristram&#x27;s uncle, Captain Toby Shandy, whistles the tune. A British Army veteran of the fighting in Ireland and the Low Countries during King William&#x27;s reign, Toby whistles &quot;Lillibullero&quot; when he is offered any opinion or argument which would require passionate rebuttal or which he finds embarrassing or upsetting.

In Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Waverley&quot;, the highland Chieftain Fergus Mac-Ivor sings a verse of &quot;Lillibulero&quot; during a dinner before he and his comrades prepare for battle on the side of the Pretender.

One of the scoundrels in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (Chapter XVI) whistles the tune, whose title is mentioned four times.

One of Kage Baker&#x27;s principal characters of &quot;The Life of the World to Come&quot;, Alec, loves this tune and it is referenced by him several times. This is likely connected to his well-known love for Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.

Neal Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Baroque Cycle&quot; also makes mention of Lillibulero&#x27;s use as anti-Catholic propaganda.

In the movie &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975) Lillibullero is heard near the start as Barry&#x27;s regiment assembles at Swords Castle to embark for the Seven Years&#x27; War.

The tune is used in &quot;The Last Man Out&quot; and &quot;Raid on Rommel&quot;. The tune is also used during the title credits in the period adventure &quot;East of Sudan&quot; (1964).

In Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s novel &quot;The Afghan&quot;, one of the protagonists, Terry Martin, has Lillibullero as his ringtone on his mobile phone.

In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot;, the theme can be heard coming from the Brigadier of 1977&#x27;s radio.

===Music===
Henry Purcell subsequently arranged the melody for a keyboard piece titled &quot;A New Irish Tune&quot;. The composition was a contribution to a method book for virginals and harpsichords called &quot;Musick&#x27;s Hand-Maid&quot;. &quot;A New Irish Tune&quot; was included in the Second Part of &quot;Musick&#x27;s Hand-Maid&quot;, published by Henry Playford.

A French version is known as the &quot;Marche du Prince d&#x27;Orange&quot;, and is attributed to Louis XIV&#x27;s court composers Philidor the Elder and Jean-Baptiste Lully.

The basic melody of &quot;Lillibulero&quot; appears to have been adapted by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart for the theme of the first movement of his Piano Sonata No. 11 in A major, K. 331 (1783). Since then, other composers have written variations on the Mozartean theme in which the relationship to Lillibulero is made even clearer, for example, Max Reger&#x27;s Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart, Op. 132 (1914).

In 1936 Walter Niemann wrote &quot;Kleine Variationen uber eine alt-irische Volksweise&quot; (Little Variations on an Old Irish Folksong), Op. 146, but a footnote acknowledges Purcell&#x27;s authorship of the theme.

Michael Longcor adapted &quot;Lillibullero&quot; as a setting for Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;Brown Bess&quot; on his album, &quot;Norman and Saxon&quot;.

<text>Judith Arlene Resnik (April 5, 1949 – January 28, 1986) was an American electrical engineer, software engineer, biomedical engineer, pilot and NASA astronaut who died in the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. She was the fourth woman, the second American woman and the first Jewish woman of any nationality to fly in space, logging 145 hours in orbit.

Recognized while still a child for her intellectual brilliance, Resnik was accepted at Carnegie Institute of Technology after becoming only the sixteenth woman in the history of the United States to have attained a perfect score on the SAT exam. She graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from Carnegie Mellon before attaining a PhD in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland.

Resnik worked for RCA as an engineer on Navy missile and radar projects, as a senior systems engineer for Xerox Corporation, and published research on special-purpose integrated circuitry. She was also a pilot and made research contributions to biomedical engineering as a research fellow at the National Institutes of Health.

At age 28, Resnik was selected by NASA as a mission specialist. She was part of NASA Astronaut Group 8, the first group to include women. While training on the astronaut program, she developed software and operating procedures for NASA missions. Her first space flight was the STS-41-D mission in August and September 1984, the twelfth Space Shuttle flight, and the of , where her duties included operating its robotic arm. Her second Shuttle mission was STS-51-L in January 1986 aboard . She died when the orbiter broke up shortly after liftoff and crashed into the ocean.

== Early life ==
Judith Arlene Resnik was born in Akron, Ohio, on April 5, 1949, the daughter of Marvin Resnik, an optometrist, and his wife Sarah ( Polensky), a legal secretary. She had a brother, Charles, who was four years younger. Her father was the son of a rabbi, and he had been born in Preluke in Ukraine. His family had emigrated to Mandatory Palestine in the 1920s, and then to the United States after the 1929 Hebron massacre. He was fluent in eight languages and served in the U.S. Army during World War II in military intelligence, conducting prisoner of war interrogations and aerial reconnaissance in the Pacific Theater and the subsequent occupation of Japan. Resnik grew up in an observant Jewish home, studying at Hebrew school at Beth El Synagogue in Akron and celebrating her Bat Mitzvah in 1962. The Bat Mitzvah was not common at this time.

Resnik was noticed for her intellectual ability while still in kindergarten, and she entered elementary school a year early. She attended Fairlawn Elementary School, Simon Perkins Junior High School, and Harvey S. Firestone High School. She was an outstanding student, excelling in mathematics, languages and piano. She played classical piano, and at one point considered a career as a concert pianist. Before college, she attained a perfect score on her SAT exam, the only woman in the country to do so that year and only the sixteenth woman in US history. She graduated from Firestone in 1966 as valedictorian and runner-up homecoming queen.

Although her mother disapproved of her dating, Resnik had a series of boyfriends. She preferred to socialize with boys from the nearby Copley High School rather than from Firestone, where her intellectual reputation preceded her. She met Len Nahmi (who eventually became a pilot) at a basketball game. He was half Irish and half Lebanese, and her mother disapproved of him. Nonetheless, she continued to see him secretly, and when she stayed with a cousin in Cleveland while taking a college course available to high school students, she also met with him there. Her parents acrimoniously divorced while she was a teenager, and custody was given to her mother, as was the custom in the United States. Her mother&#x27;s dislike of Nahmi became more intense, and Nahmi eventually ended their relationship to spare Resnik more pain. When she was 17, she prepared and filed a successful court case so that her custody could be switched from her mother to her father, with whom she was particularly close. She tore up letters from her mother unopened. Her father remarried, and she acquired twin stepsisters, Linda and Sandy, who were nine years older than she was, and with whom she became close.
At age 17, Resnik entered Carnegie Institute of Technology, where she joined the Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority. She began college intending to become a math major, but in her second year, after attending electrical engineering lectures with her boyfriend Michael Oldak, she developed a passion for the subject. She was one of three female students in electrical engineering. She was a gourmet cook and a navigator in sports car rallies, in which she took part many times with Oldak in his Triumph TR6. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University (as it now was) in 1970. She became a member of Tau Beta Pi, Mortar Board, and Eta Kappa Nu honor societies.

Resnik married Oldak on July 14, 1970. Her mother attended the wedding; two sets of invitations were sent out, one describing her as her father&#x27;s daughter, and the other as her mother&#x27;s. Upon graduation from Carnegie Mellon, Resnik and Oldak moved to Moorestown, New Jersey, where they both worked for RCA. She was a design engineer on missile and radar projects and won the Graduate Study Program Award. She performed circuit design for the missile and surface radar division. While at RCA, she worked for the Navy building custom integrated circuitry for the phased-array radar control systems and developed electronics and software for NASA&#x27;s sounding rocket and telemetry systems programs. An academic paper she wrote on special purpose integrated circuitry caught the attention of NASA during this time. She registered for master&#x27;s degree evening courses at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1971, Oldak was accepted into Georgetown University Law Center, and they moved to Washington, D.C. Resnik continued to work for RCA, transferring to its office in Springfield, Virginia, and she continued pursuing her master&#x27;s degree at the University of Maryland. She then entered a doctoral program. Resnik and Oldak divorced in 1975—he wanted children and she did not—but they remained in contact and on good terms.

While working on her doctorate, Resnik switched jobs in 1974, and went to work as a research fellow in biomedical engineering at the Laboratory of Neurophysiology at the National Institutes of Health. As a biomedical engineer, Resnik researched the physiology of visual systems. In 1977 she earned her PhD in electrical engineering with honors at the University of Maryland, writing her dissertation on &quot;Bleaching kinetics of visual pigments&quot;. Her research involved the effects of electrical currents on the retina. An academic paper co-written by her concerning the biomedical engineering of optometry (&quot;A novel rapid scanning microspectrophotometer and its use in measuring rhodopsin photoproduct pathways and kinetics in frog retinas&quot;) was published in the &quot;Journal of the Optical Society of America&quot; in 1978.

== NASA astronaut ==
=== Selection and training ===
After her divorce from Oldak, Resnik reconnected with Nahmi, who was now a commercial airline pilot. When he heard that the National Air and Space Administration (NASA) was recruiting women to become astronauts, he encouraged her to apply. They read &quot;Carrying the Fire&quot;, the 1974 book by Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins, and she met with him in his office at the National Air and Space Museum. She also met with another former astronaut, John Glenn, who was now a United States senator from her home state of Ohio. Nahmi convinced her to obtain a private pilot&#x27;s license to bolster her credentials. Resnik qualified as a pilot in 1977, while completing her Ph.D., having achieved near-perfect scores in her flying exams (two 100s and a 98). When she received a promotion at RCA and again when she completed her doctorate, he suggested she send NASA a telegram informing them.

Resnik&#x27;s mentor and advisor, Professor Angel G. Jordan, then Dean of Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering and later provost of Carnegie Mellon, also encouraged Resnik to apply for the program. After she completed her doctorate, Resnik became a senior systems engineer for Xerox Corporation in Los Angeles, working in product development. She rented an apartment in Redondo Beach, California, where she would jog along the beach to improve her stamina and reduce her weight.

In January 1978, at age 28, Resnik was selected as a mission specialist with NASA Astronaut Group 8, one of twenty-nine men and six women selected out of 8,029 applicants in the first NASA astronaut selection that included women. This involved taking a pay cut, as her new salary was considerably less than what she was being paid at Xerox. Her fellow astronaut candidates nicknamed her &quot;JR&quot;. She dated some of them. She trained intensely and with great determination, focusing particularly on her physical fitness. She piloted the Northrop T-38 Talon, an aircraft used by NASA astronauts for transportation and training. Astronaut Jerome Apt described her as &quot;an excellent pilot&quot;. Asked about Resnik, fellow astronaut Rhea Seddon said: &quot;I thought she was really really bright, obviously a very beautiful person, flirtatious, funny. She was just a live wire. We would do the happy hours, or we&#x27;d go on these NASA trips, and Judy was just a star attraction.&quot;

Resnik worked on research into the principle of orbital systems, flight software and the development of systems of manual control of spacecraft. She developed the software and operating procedures for the Space Shuttle&#x27;s Remote Manipulator System (RMS). She also developed the deployment systems for the tethered satellite systems and worked on orbiter development, writing software for NASA to use on its missions. She disliked the part of her job that required making public appearances and drumming up support for the space program. She avoided television interviews when possible, and resented intrusive questions about her private life, such as questions about her divorce.

Other astronauts felt that either Resnik or Sally Ride would become the first woman in the group to fly in space, as they received the sorts of technical assignments that best prepared them for flight, such as capsule communicator (CapCom) duties. The shortlisted candidates for the mission specialist assignments for the STS-7 mission included all six women, but since the mission involved the use of the RMS, the choice of the first to fly on the Space Shuttle narrowed to Resnik, Ride and Anna Fisher, who had specialized on it. Resnik was considered best qualified, but was passed over in favor of Ride because it was felt that Resnik was less comfortable with public affairs, and the first American woman to fly in space would attract an unusual amount of public interest.

=== STS-41-D ===

In February 1983, Resnik was assigned to the crew of STS-41-D, the twelfth Space Shuttle flight, the of the , along with Henry Hartsfield, Michael Coats, Steven Hawley and Mike Mullane. During a visit to a contractor&#x27;s factory, Resnik whispered to Mullane: &quot;there are no maidens on this flight&quot;. She was the center of attention on such visits, and one contractor engineer became a stalker, sending her unwelcome letters, poems and gifts. Eventually, after he appeared in the office, he had to be dealt with by NASA security. After Hawley and Mullane had a fawning encounter with actor Bo Derek, who was working on the film &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot;, Resnik started calling Mullane &quot;Tarzan&quot; and Hawley &quot;Cheetah&quot;; when the office secretaries heard about this, they began referring to the STS-41-D crew as the &quot;zoo crew&quot;. Resnik was a fan of the actor Tom Selleck, and had a coffee cup that said: &quot;Excuse No. 1: I&#x27;m Saving Myself for Tom Selleck.&quot; Her crewmates hid a poster of Tom Selleck behind the bathroom curtain on &quot;Discovery&quot;.

The STS-41-D mission&#x27;s launch was delayed three times. The first attempt, on June 25, 1984, was aborted due to a failure of the backup computer. The following day, during the second attempt, the computer detected a fault in one of the Space Shuttle main engines, and shut them down four seconds before liftoff. This was the first time a NASA space mission had been aborted after starting the engines since Gemini 6 in 1965. &quot;Discovery&quot; had to be taken back to the Vehicle Assembly Building, where the faulty engine was replaced. A further launch attempt was made on August 29, but was again delayed for a day due to a software issue. Finally, on August 30, &quot;Discovery&quot; lifted off for the first time, and was in orbit eight minutes later. Resnik invited her family to watch the launch from the VIP viewing area. This included her father, brother, Oldak and Nahmi. Her mother was also in attendance, to avoid bad publicity.

Resnik became the second American woman in space. She was also the first American Jewish astronaut to go into space, and the first Jewish woman. Her duties included operating the Space Shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm, which she helped create and on which she was an expert. On the first day of the mission, Resnik and Mullane deployed the first of three commercial communications satellites, the SBS-4 satellite for Satellite Business Systems. On the second day, the crew released a second satellite, Syncom IV-2, also known as Leasat 2, for the U.S. Navy. While Hartsfield was filming its release with the IMAX camera for the documentary &quot;The Dream is Alive&quot;, Resnik&#x27;s hair became caught in the camera&#x27;s belt feed mechanism. The camera jammed, and she had to be cut free with scissors. Strands of loose hair floated about the cabin. Hartsfield informed the mission control center that the camera had jammed, but did not say why. Coats was able to repair the camera, and Hartsfield continued filming, while Resnik kept her distance. The crew deployed a third satellite, Telstar 302 for Telesat of Canada, without mishap the following day.

That day Resnik also deployed the OAST-1 solar array wing, considered a potential future way of generating more electrical power during space missions. After performing several dynamic tests that day and the next, she reported that the experiment was well-behaved and matched ground simulations of the array. During the mission, she held up a hand-written sign saying &quot;Hi Dad&quot; to the cameras, and in a live televised broadcast told President Ronald Reagan &quot;the Earth looks great&quot;. When Reagan asked her if the flight was all she hoped it would be, she replied, &quot;It certainly is and I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better crew to fly with.&quot; After the mission, Hartsfield described Resnik as the &quot;astronaut&#x27;s astronaut&quot;, and Mullane wrote: &quot;I was also happy to be crewed with Judy ... She was smart, hardworking, and dependable, all the things you would want in a fellow crewmember.&quot;

&quot;Discovery&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base on September 5, after a flight lasting 6 days and 56 minutes.

=== Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster ===

On January 29, 1985, NASA announced that Resnik had been assigned to the crew of STS-51-L. The main objective of this mission was to launch TDRS-B, the second in a series of NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellites. It would also carry the Spartan (Shuttle Pointed Autonomous Research Tool for Astronomy), which would use two ultraviolet spectrometers to study the tail of Comet Halley. Resnik was primarily responsible for the operation of the RMS and, with fellow astronaut Ronald McNair, would deploy and later retrieve the Spartan. The flight would also carry Christa McAuliffe, a teacher-observer selected as part of NASA&#x27;s Teacher in Space Project. Resnik was part of the team of astronauts who flew to Washington, D.C., to speak to the 113 finalists, and provide them an insider&#x27;s view of a Space Shuttle mission. They were taken to the National Air and Space Museum, where they viewed &quot;The Dream is Alive&quot; with its scenes of Resnik deploying a satellite and eating and sleeping in space. She told them that it was a shame that they could not all fly in space, but privately she disagreed with NASA&#x27;s decision to send non-astronauts on the Space Shuttle. Resnik&#x27;s assignment was tied to McAuliffe&#x27;s; NASA wanted McAuliffe to fly with a veteran female astronaut.

Initially scheduled for January 24, 1986, the launch was delayed until January 28 by rain, high winds, a troublesome bolt on the &#x27;s hatch and freezing temperatures. Resnik&#x27;s father and stepmother, and her brother and his family watched the launch from the VIP area, as did her Firestone High math teacher. Selleck declined her invitation to attend. Resnik carried a locket for her niece, a signet ring for her nephew and a cigarette lighter for Nahmi.

&quot;Challenger&quot; lifted off from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B at 11:38 on January 28. A minute later it broke up, torn apart by aerodynamic forces after a catastrophic failure of an O-ring seal on the starboard solid rocket booster. The cabin remained intact until it hit the water at 207 mph, killing all on board. Resnik&#x27;s last recorded words aboard &quot;Challenger&quot; regarded scanning for &quot;LVLH&quot; (local vertical/local horizontal), reminding the cockpit crew of a switch configuration change to the attitude direction indicator.

Following the disaster, examination of the recovered vehicle cockpit revealed that the Personal Egress Air Packs were activated for pilot Mike Smith and two other crew members. The location of Smith&#x27;s activation switch on the back of his seat means either Resnik or Ellison Onizuka likely activated it for him. Mike Mullane wrote:

This is the only evidence that shows Onizuka and Resnik were alive after the cockpit separated from the vehicle. If the cabin had lost pressure, the air packs alone would not have sustained the crew during the two-minute descent. Resnik&#x27;s remains were recovered from the crashed vehicle cockpit by Navy divers from the . The remains of the seven crew members were cremated, comingled and buried at the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery on May 20, 1986.

== Legacy ==

Resnik was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor. She was also awarded the NASA Space Flight Medal for her first flight. Landmarks and buildings named for her include a dormitory at her alma mater, Carnegie Mellon University; Judith A. Resnik Elementary School in Gaithersburg, Maryland; Judith A. Resnik Community Learning Center (formerly Fairlawn Elementary) which she had attended was renamed in her honor in her hometown of Akron; and Judith A. Resnik Middle School, established in 2016, in San Antonio, Texas. A crater on the Moon was named after her, as was one on Venus, where all features are named after women. An asteroid, 3356 Resnik, was also named after her.

A memorial to Resnik and the rest of the crew of &quot;Challenger&quot; was dedicated in Seabrook, Texas, where she lived while stationed at the Johnson Space Center. She is also commemorated on the Space Mirror Memorial at the Kennedy Space Center. The IEEE Judith A. Resnik Award was established in 1986 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and is presented annually to an individual or team in recognition of outstanding contributions to space engineering in areas of relevance to the IEEE. The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) awards the Resnik Challenger Medal annually to &quot;a woman who has changed the space industry, has personally contributed innovative technology verified by flight experience ... and will be recognized through future decades as having created milestones in the development of space as a resource for all humankind.&quot; The Challenger Center was established in 1986 by the families of the &quot;Challenger&quot; crew, including Resnik&#x27;s brother, Charles, in honor of the crew members. Its goal is to increase children&#x27;s interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

Julie Fulton portrayed Resnik in the 1990 made-for-TV movie &quot;Challenger&quot;.

<text>A nozzle is a device designed to control the direction or characteristics of a fluid flow (specially to increase velocity) as it exits (or enters) an enclosed chamber or pipe.

A nozzle is often a pipe or tube of varying cross sectional area, and it can be used to direct or modify the flow of a fluid (liquid or gas). Nozzles are frequently used to control the rate of flow, speed, direction, mass, shape, and/or the pressure of the stream that emerges from them. In a nozzle, the velocity of fluid increases at the expense of its pressure energy.

==Types==

===Jet===
A gas jet, fluid jet, or hydro jet is a nozzle intended to eject gas or fluid in a coherent stream into a surrounding medium. Gas jets are commonly found in gas stoves, ovens, or barbecues. Gas jets were commonly used for light before the development of electric light. Other types of fluid jets are found in carburetors, where smooth calibrated orifices are used to regulate the flow of fuel into an engine, and in jacuzzis or spas.

Another specialized jet is the laminar jet. This is a water jet that contains devices to smooth out the pressure and flow, and gives laminar flow, as its name suggests. This gives better results for fountains.

The foam jet is another type of jet which uses foam instead of a gas or fluid.

Nozzles used for feeding hot blast into a blast furnace or forge are called tuyeres.

Jet nozzles are also used in large rooms where the distribution of air via ceiling diffusers is not possible or not practical. Diffusers that uses jet nozzles are called jet diffuser where it will be arranged in the side wall areas in order to distribute air. When the temperature difference between the supply air and the room air changes, the supply air stream is deflected upwards, to supply warm air, or downwards, to supply cold air.

===High velocity===
Frequently, the goal of a nozzle is to increase the kinetic energy of the flowing medium at the expense of its pressure and internal energy.

Nozzles can be described as &quot;convergent&quot; (narrowing down from a wide diameter to a smaller diameter in the direction of the flow) or &quot;divergent&quot; (expanding from a smaller diameter to a larger one). A de Laval nozzle has a convergent section followed by a divergent section and is often called a convergent-divergent (CD) nozzle (&quot;con-di nozzle&quot;).

Convergent nozzles accelerate subsonic fluids. If the nozzle pressure ratio is high enough, then the flow will reach sonic velocity at the narrowest point (i.e. the &quot;nozzle throat&quot;). In this situation, the nozzle is said to be &quot;choked&quot;.

Increasing the nozzle pressure ratio further will not increase the throat Mach number above one. Downstream (i.e. external to the nozzle) the flow is free to expand to supersonic velocities; however, Mach 1 can be a very high speed for a hot gas because the speed of sound varies as the square root of absolute temperature. This fact is used extensively in rocketry where hypersonic flows are required and where propellant mixtures are deliberately chosen to further increase the sonic speed.

Divergent nozzles slow fluids if the flow is subsonic, but they accelerate sonic or supersonic fluids.

Convergent-divergent nozzles can therefore accelerate fluids that have choked in the convergent section to supersonic speeds. This CD process is more efficient than allowing a convergent nozzle to expand supersonically externally.
The shape of the divergent section also ensures that the direction of the escaping gases is directly backwards, as any
sideways component would not contribute to thrust.

===Propelling===

A jet exhaust produces thrust from the energy obtained from burning fuel. The hot gas is at a higher pressure than the outside air and escapes from the engine through a &quot;propelling nozzle&quot;, which increases the speed of the gas.

Exhaust speed needs to be faster than the aircraft speed in order to produce thrust but an excessive speed difference wastes fuel (poor propulsive efficiency). Jet engines for subsonic flight use convergent nozzles with a sonic exit velocity. Engines for supersonic flight, such as used for fighters and SST aircraft (e.g. Concorde) achieve the high exhaust speeds necessary for supersonic flight by using a divergent extension to the convergent engine nozzle which accelerates the exhaust to supersonic speeds.

Rocket motors maximise thrust and exhaust velocity by using convergent-divergent nozzles with very large area ratios and therefore extremely high pressure ratios. Mass flow is at a premium because all the propulsive mass is carried with vehicle, and very high exhaust speeds are desirable.

===Magnetic===

Magnetic nozzles have also been proposed for some types of propulsion, such as VASIMR, in which the flow of plasma is directed by magnetic fields instead of walls made of solid matter.

===Spray===

Many nozzles produce a very fine spray of liquids.
* Atomizer nozzles are used for spray painting, perfumes, carburetors for internal combustion engines, spray on deodorants, antiperspirants and many other similar uses.
* Air-aspirating nozzles use an opening in the cone shaped nozzle to inject air into a stream of water based foam (CAFS/AFFF/FFFP) to make the concentrate &quot;foam up&quot;. Most commonly found on foam extinguishers and foam handlines.
* Swirl nozzles inject the liquid in tangentially, and it spirals into the center and then exits through the central hole. Due to the vortexing this causes the spray to come out in a cone shape.
* Water spray nozzles are designed to distribute water in a controlled pattern for cooling, dust suppression, fire protection, and industrial applications. They ensure efficient liquid dispersion for various needs.

===Vacuum===
Vacuum cleaner nozzles come in several different shapes. Vacuum nozzles are used in vacuum cleaners.

===Shaping===
Some nozzles are shaped to produce a stream that is of a particular shape. For example, extrusion molding is a way of producing lengths of metals or plastics or other materials with a particular cross-section. This nozzle is typically referred to as a die.

<text>The notion of a fibration generalizes the notion of a fiber bundle and plays an important role in algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics.

Fibrations are used, for example, in Postnikov systems or obstruction theory.

In this article, all mappings are continuous mappings between topological spaces.

== Formal definitions ==

=== Homotopy lifting property ===
A mapping formula_1 satisfies the homotopy lifting property for a space formula_2 if:

* for every homotopy formula_3 and
* for every mapping (also called lift) formula_4 lifting formula_5 (i.e. formula_6)

there exists a (not necessarily unique) homotopy formula_7 lifting formula_8 (i.e. formula_9) with formula_10

The following commutative diagram shows the situation: 
=== Fibration ===
A fibration (also called Hurewicz fibration) is a mapping formula_1 satisfying the homotopy lifting property for all spaces formula_12 The space formula_13 is called base space and the space formula_14 is called total space. The fiber over formula_15 is the subspace formula_16
=== Serre fibration ===
A Serre fibration (also called weak fibration) is a mapping formula_1 satisfying the homotopy lifting property for all CW-complexes. 

Every Hurewicz fibration is a Serre fibration.

=== Quasifibration ===
A mapping formula_1 is called quasifibration, if for every formula_19 formula_20 and formula_21 holds that the induced mapping formula_22 is an isomorphism.

Every Serre fibration is a quasifibration.

== Examples ==

* The projection onto the first factor formula_23 is a fibration. That is, trivial bundles are fibrations.
* Every covering formula_1 is a fibration. Specifically, for every homotopy formula_3 and every lift formula_4 there exists a uniquely defined lift formula_27 with formula_28 
* Every fiber bundle formula_1 satisfies the homotopy lifting property for every CW-complex.
* A fiber bundle with a paracompact and Hausdorff base space satisfies the homotopy lifting property for all spaces.
* An example of a fibration which is not a fiber bundle is given by the mapping formula_30 induced by the inclusion formula_31 where formula_32 formula_2 a topological space and formula_34 is the space of all continuous mappings with the compact-open topology.
* The Hopf fibration formula_35 is a non-trivial fiber bundle and, specifically, a Serre fibration.

== Basic concepts ==

=== Fiber homotopy equivalence ===
A mapping formula_36 between total spaces of two fibrations formula_37 and formula_38 with the same base space is a fibration homomorphism if the following diagram commutes:

The mapping formula_39 is a fiber homotopy equivalence if in addition a fibration homomorphism formula_40 exists, such that the mappings formula_41 and formula_42 are homotopic, by fibration homomorphisms, to the identities formula_43 and formula_44 

=== Pullback fibration ===
Given a fibration formula_1 and a mapping formula_46, the mapping formula_47 is a fibration, where formula_48 is the pullback and the projections of formula_49 onto formula_50 and formula_14 yield the following commutative diagram:

The fibration formula_52 is called the pullback fibration or induced fibration.

=== Pathspace fibration ===
With the pathspace construction, any continuous mapping can be extended to a fibration by enlarging its domain to a homotopy equivalent space. This fibration is called pathspace fibration.

The total space formula_53 of the pathspace fibration for a continuous mapping formula_46 between topological spaces consists of pairs formula_55 with formula_56 and paths formula_57 with starting point formula_58 where formula_59 is the unit interval. The space formula_60 carries the subspace topology of formula_61 where formula_62 describes the space of all mappings formula_63 and carries the compact-open topology.

The pathspace fibration is given by the mapping formula_64 with formula_65 The fiber formula_66 is also called the homotopy fiber of formula_39 and consists of the pairs formula_55 with formula_56 and paths formula_70 where formula_71 and formula_72 holds.

For the special case of the inclusion of the base point formula_73, an important example of the pathspace fibration emerges. The total space formula_74 consists of all paths in formula_13 which starts at formula_76 This space is denoted by formula_77 and is called path space. The pathspace fibration formula_78 maps each path to its endpoint, hence the fiber formula_79 consists of all closed paths. The fiber is denoted by formula_80 and is called loop space.

== Properties ==

* The fibers formula_81 over formula_15 are homotopy equivalent for each path component of formula_83
* For a homotopy formula_84 the pullback fibrations formula_85 and formula_86 are fiber homotopy equivalent. 
* If the base space formula_13 is contractible, then the fibration formula_1 is fiber homotopy equivalent to the product fibration formula_89
* The pathspace fibration of a fibration formula_1 is very similar to itself. More precisely, the inclusion formula_91 is a fiber homotopy equivalence.
* For a fibration formula_1 with fiber formula_93 and contractible total space, there is a weak homotopy equivalence formula_94

== Puppe sequence ==

For a fibration formula_1 with fiber formula_93 and base point formula_97 the inclusion formula_98 of the fiber into the homotopy fiber is a homotopy equivalence. The mapping formula_99 with formula_100, where formula_101 and formula_57 is a path from formula_103 to formula_104 in the base space, is a fibration. Specifically it is the pullback fibration of the pathspace fibration formula_105 along formula_106. This procedure can now be applied again to the fibration formula_107 and so on. This leads to a long sequence: 
formula_108
The fiber of formula_107 over a point formula_110 consists of the pairs formula_111 where formula_112 is a path from formula_113 to formula_104, i.e. the loop space formula_80. The inclusion formula_116 of the fiber of formula_107 into the homotopy fiber of formula_107 is again a homotopy equivalence and iteration yields the sequence:formula_119Due to the duality of fibration and cofibration, there also exists a sequence of cofibrations. These two sequences are known as the Puppe sequences or the sequences of fibrations and cofibrations.

== Principal fibration ==
A fibration formula_1 with fiber formula_93 is called principal, if there exists a commutative diagram:

The bottom row is a sequence of fibrations and the vertical mappings are weak homotopy equivalences. Principal fibrations play an important role in Postnikov towers.

== Long exact sequence of homotopy groups ==
For a Serre fibration formula_1 there exists a long exact sequence of homotopy groups. For base points formula_97 and formula_124 this is given by:formula_125

formula_126The homomorphisms formula_127 and formula_128 are the induced homomorphisms of the inclusion formula_129 and the projection formula_130

=== Hopf fibration ===
Hopf fibrations are a family of fiber bundles whose fiber, total space and base space are spheres:formula_131

formula_132

formula_133

formula_134The long exact sequence of homotopy groups of the hopf fibration formula_135 yields:formula_136 formula_137
This sequence splits into short exact sequences, as the fiber formula_138 in formula_139 is contractible to a point:formula_140This short exact sequence splits because of the suspension homomorphism formula_141 and there are isomorphisms:formula_142The homotopy groups formula_143 are trivial for formula_144 so there exist isomorphisms between formula_145 and formula_146 for formula_147

Analog the fibers formula_139 in formula_149 and formula_149 in formula_151 are contractible to a point. Further the short exact sequences split and there are families of isomorphisms:
formula_152 and

formula_153

== Spectral sequence ==
Spectral sequences are important tools in algebraic topology for computing (co-)homology groups.

The Leray-Serre spectral sequence connects the (co-)homology of the total space and the fiber with the (co-)homology of the base space of a fibration. For a fibration formula_1 with fiber formula_155 where the base space is a path connected CW-complex, and an additive homology theory formula_156 there exists a spectral sequence:

:formula_157

Fibrations do not yield long exact sequences in homology, as they do in homotopy. But under certain conditions, fibrations provide exact sequences in homology. For a fibration formula_1 with fiber formula_155 where base space and fiber are path connected, the fundamental group formula_160 acts trivially on formula_161 and in addition the conditions formula_162 for formula_163 for formula_164 hold, an exact sequence exists (also known under the name Serre exact sequence):formula_165This sequence can be used, for example, to prove Hurewicz&#x27;s theorem or to compute the homology of loopspaces of the form
formula_166 formula_167For the special case of a fibration formula_168 where the base space is a formula_169-sphere with fiber formula_155 there exist exact sequences (also called Wang sequences) for homology and cohomology:
formula_171

formula_172

== Orientability ==
For a fibration formula_1 with fiber formula_93 and a fixed commutative ring formula_175 with a unit, there exists a contravariant functor from the fundamental groupoid of formula_13 to the category of graded formula_175-modules, which assigns to formula_15 the module formula_179 and to the path class formula_180 the homomorphism formula_181 where formula_182 is a homotopy class in formula_183

A fibration is called orientable over formula_175 if for any closed path formula_185 in formula_13 the following holds: formula_187

== Euler characteristic ==
For an orientable fibration formula_1 over the field formula_189 with fiber formula_93 and path connected base space, the Euler characteristic of the total space is given by:formula_191Here the Euler characteristics of the base space and the fiber are defined over the field formula_189.

<text>Sant Joan d&#x27;Alacant (; ), or simply Sant Joan (or San Juan), is a municipality belonging to Alicante metropolitan area, in the southeast of Valencian Community, Spain. It is the geographic center of the Old Garden of Alicante. Its limits are with the settled areas of Alicante (7 km), Mutxamel (1 km) and El Campello (3 km). It is within the Alicante metropolitan area and shares the same fire department and metro services. Its population growth is due to its function as a bedroom community, as well as in recent years, its isolation from tourist areas, its cultural and academic activities, and because has part of the campus of the University Miguel Hernández of Elx/Elche. It comprises two zones: the town of Sant Joan and Benimagrell, which is now joined through its urban expansion.

As of the register of 2023, the population is 25,275.

<doc id="316837" wikidata="Q10614739" url="?curid=316837" title="Incenter">
<text>In geometry, the incenter of a triangle is a triangle center, a point defined for any triangle in a way that is independent of the triangle&#x27;s placement or scale. The incenter may be equivalently defined as the point where the internal angle bisectors of the triangle cross, as the point equidistant from the triangle&#x27;s sides, as the junction point of the medial axis and innermost point of the grassfire transform of the triangle, and as the center point of the inscribed circle of the triangle.

Together with the centroid, circumcenter, and orthocenter, it is one of the four triangle centers known to the ancient Greeks, and the only one of the four that does not in general lie on the Euler line. It is the first listed center, X(1), in Clark Kimberling&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers, and the identity element of the multiplicative group of triangle centers.

For polygons with more than three sides, the incenter only exists for tangential polygons: those that have an incircle that is tangent to each side of the polygon. In this case the incenter is the center of this circle and is equally distant from all sides.

==Definition and construction==
It is a theorem in Euclidean geometry that the three interior angle bisectors of a triangle meet in a single point. In Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, Proposition 4 of Book IV proves that this point is also the center of the inscribed circle of the triangle. The incircle itself may be constructed by dropping a perpendicular from the incenter to one of the sides of the triangle and drawing a circle with that segment as its radius.

The incenter lies at equal distances from the three line segments forming the sides of the triangle, and also from the three lines containing those segments. It is the only point equally distant from the line segments, but there are three more points equally distant from the lines, the excenters, which form the centers of the excircles of the given triangle. The incenter and excenters together form an orthocentric system.

The medial axis of a polygon is the set of points whose nearest neighbor on the polygon is not unique: these points are equidistant from two or more sides of the polygon. One method for computing medial axes is using the grassfire transform, in which one forms a continuous sequence of offset curves, each at some fixed distance from the polygon; the medial axis is traced out by the vertices of these curves. In the case of a triangle, the medial axis consists of three segments of the angle bisectors, connecting the vertices of the triangle to the incenter, which is the unique point on the innermost offset curve. The straight skeleton, defined in a similar way from a different type of offset curve, coincides with the medial axis for convex polygons and so also has its junction at the incenter.

==Proofs==

===Ratio proof===

Let the bisection of formula_1 and formula_2 meet at formula_3, and the bisection of formula_4 and formula_5 meet at formula_6, and formula_7 and formula_8 meet at formula_9.

And let formula_10and formula_11 meet at formula_12.

Then we have to prove that formula_10 is the bisection of formula_14.

In formula_15, formula_16, by the Angle bisector theorem.

In formula_17, formula_18.

Therefore, formula_19, so that formula_20.

So formula_21 is the bisection of formula_14.

===Perpendicular proof===

A line that is an angle bisector is equidistant from both of its lines when measuring by the perpendicular. At the point where two bisectors intersect, this point is perpendicularly equidistant from the final angle&#x27;s forming lines (because they are the same distance from this angles opposite edge), and therefore lies on its angle bisector line.

==Relation to triangle sides and vertices==

===Trilinear coordinates===
The trilinear coordinates for a point in the triangle give the ratio of distances to the triangle sides. Trilinear coordinates
for the incenter are given by
:formula_23

The collection of triangle centers may be given the structure of a group under coordinatewise multiplication of trilinear coordinates; in this group, the incenter forms the identity element.

===Barycentric coordinates===
The barycentric coordinates for a point in a triangle give weights such that the point is the weighted average of the triangle vertex positions.
Barycentric coordinates for the incenter are given by
:formula_24
where formula_25, formula_26, and formula_27 are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, or equivalently (using the law of sines) by
:formula_28
where formula_29, formula_30, and formula_31 are the angles at the three vertices.

===Cartesian coordinates===
The Cartesian coordinates of the incenter are a weighted average of the coordinates of the three vertices using the side lengths of the triangle relative to the perimeter—i.e., using the barycentric coordinates given above, normalized to sum to unity—as weights. (The weights are positive so the incenter lies inside the triangle as stated above.) If the three vertices are located at formula_32, formula_33, and formula_34, and the sides opposite these vertices have corresponding lengths formula_25, formula_26, and formula_27, then the incenter is at
:formula_38

===Distances to vertices===
Denoting the incenter of triangle &quot;ABC&quot; as &quot;I&quot;, the distances from the incenter to the vertices combined with the lengths of the triangle sides obey the equation
:formula_39
Additionally,
:formula_40
where &quot;R&quot; and &quot;r&quot; are the triangle&#x27;s circumradius and inradius respectively.

==Related constructions==

===Other centers===

The distance from the incenter to the centroid is less than one third the length of the longest median of the triangle.

By Euler&#x27;s theorem in geometry, the squared distance from the incenter &quot;I&quot; to the circumcenter &quot;O&quot; is given by

:formula_41

where &quot;R&quot; and &quot;r&quot; are the circumradius and the inradius respectively; thus the circumradius is at least twice the inradius, with equality only in the equilateral case.

The distance from the incenter to the center &quot;N&quot; of the nine point circle is

:formula_42

The squared distance from the incenter to the orthocenter &quot;H&quot; is

:formula_43

Inequalities include:

:formula_44

The incenter is the Nagel point of the medial triangle (the triangle whose vertices are the midpoints of the sides) and therefore lies inside this triangle. Conversely the Nagel point of any triangle is the incenter of its anticomplementary triangle.

The incenter must lie in the interior of a disk whose diameter connects the centroid &quot;G&quot; and the orthocenter &quot;H&quot; (the orthocentroidal disk), but it cannot coincide with the nine-point center, whose position is fixed 1/4 of the way along the diameter (closer to &quot;G&quot;). Any other point within the orthocentroidal disk is the incenter of a unique triangle.

===Euler line===
The Euler line of a triangle is a line passing through its circumcenter, centroid, and orthocenter, among other points.
The incenter generally does not lie on the Euler line; it is on the Euler line only for isosceles triangles, for which the Euler line coincides with the symmetry axis of the triangle and contains all triangle centers.

Denoting the distance from the incenter to the Euler line as &quot;d&quot;, the length of the longest median as &quot;v&quot;, the length of the longest side as &quot;u&quot;, the circumradius as &quot;R&quot;, the length of the Euler line segment from the orthocenter to the circumcenter as &quot;e&quot;, and the semiperimeter as &quot;s&quot;, the following inequalities hold:

:formula_45

:formula_46

:formula_47

===Area and perimeter splitters===
Any line through a triangle that splits both the triangle&#x27;s area and its perimeter in half goes through the triangle&#x27;s incenter; every line through the incenter that splits the area in half also splits the perimeter in half. There are either one, two, or three of these lines for any given triangle.

===Relative distances from an angle bisector===

Let &quot;X&quot; be a variable point on the internal angle bisector of &quot;A&quot;. Then &quot;X&quot; = &quot;I&quot; (the incenter) maximizes or minimizes the ratio formula_48 along that angle bisector.

<text>Andon Beça (7 September 1879– 31 October 1944) was an Albanian politician.

Under the Italian occupation of Albania during World War II he was Minister of Agriculture and Domestic Economy in Shefqet Vërlaci&#x27;s government which started functioning on 12 April 1939, and Minister of Finances in 1943. Beça was a loyal hanger-on of Vërlaci and was injured during an attempt on Vërlaci&#x27;s life in 1927, inspired by his enemy, Zog. As a deputy of the electoral zone of Elbasan, he raised the cry &quot;Long Life Italy&quot; at the opening of the Albanian Parliament, on 15 October 1938, evoking no response from the audience.
Beça had a son, who was sentenced by Enver Hoxha, and died in prison. He also had adopted his late brother&#x27;s infant daughters, Haretina Beça and Maria Beça. Andon Beça owned a lot of real estate, including riverside properties and estates in several cities.

<text>Thomas Metzinger (born 12 March 1958) is a German philosopher and Professor Emeritus of theoretical philosophy at the University of Mainz. His primary research areas include philosophy of mind, philosophy of neuroscience, and applied ethics, particularly focusing on neurotechnology, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. He has argued in his book &quot;Being No One&quot; that the phenomenal self is a mental construct created by the brain. His 2024 book &quot;The Elephant and the Blind&quot; compiled extensive research on meditation.

== Academic career ==
Metzinger studied philosophy, ethnology, and theology at Goethe University Frankfurt. He received his doctorate there in 1985, with a thesis on the mind-body problem. In 1992, he completed his habilitation at the University of Giessen. In 2000, Metzinger was appointed professor of philosophy of cognitive science at Osnabrück University, but moved to the University of Mainz in the same year.

Metzinger cofounded in 1994 of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness, of which he has been a board and committee member, and was the 2010 president. From 2005 to 2007 he was president of the German Cognitive Science Society. Metzinger is an Adjunct Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, a co-founder of the German Effective Altruism Foundation, president of the Barbara Wengeler Foundation, and on the advisory board of the Giordano Bruno Foundation and the MIND Foundation. From 2008 to 2009, he served as a Fellow at the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study; from 2014 to 2019, he was a Fellow at the Gutenberg Research College; from 2019 to 2022, he was awarded a &quot;Senior-Forschungsprofessur&quot; by the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture. In 2019 he founded the MPE project. From 2018 to 2020, Metzinger worked as a member of the European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence. In 2022 he was elected into the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.

==Personal life==
Metzinger has practiced meditation twice a day for over forty years. He has recommended vipassana practice.

<text>In sociology, social distance describes the distance between individuals or social groups in society, including dimensions such as social class, race/ethnicity, gender or sexuality. Members of different groups mix less than members of the same group. It is the measure of nearness or intimacy that an individual or group feels towards another individual or group in a social network or the level of trust one group has for another and the extent of perceived likeness of beliefs.

== History ==
Modern research into social distance is primarily attributed to work by sociologist Georg Simmel. Simmel&#x27;s conceptualization of social distance was represented in his writings about a hypothetical stranger that was simultaneously near and far from contact with his social group.

Simmel&#x27;s lectures on the topic were attended by Robert Park, who later extended Simmel&#x27;s ideas to the study of relations across racial/ethnic groups. At the time, racial tensions in the US at the time had brought intergroup relations to the forefront of academic interest. Robert Park tasked his student, Emory Bogardus, to create a quantifiable measure of social distance. Bogardus&#x27; creation of the first Social Distance Scale played a large role in popularizing Park&#x27;s and Bogardus conceptualization of social distance, which had some significant differences from Simmel&#x27;s original ideas.

Contemporary studies of social distance do exhibit some features of a cohesive body of literature, but the definitions and frameworks sometimes show significant variations across researchers and disciplines.

== Dimensions ==
Nedim Karakayali put forth a framework that described four dimensions of social distance:

# Affective social distance: One widespread view of social distance is affectivity. Social distance is associated with affective distance, i.e. how much sympathy the members of a group feel for another group. Emory Bogardus, the creator of &quot;Bogardus social distance scale&quot; was typically basing his scale on this subjective-affective conception of social distance: &quot;[i]n social distance studies the center of attention is on the feeling reactions of persons toward other persons and toward groups of people.&quot;
# Normative social distance: A second approach views social distance as a normative category. Normative social distance refers to the widely accepted and often consciously expressed norms about who should be considered as an &quot;insider&quot; and who an &quot;outsider/foreigner&quot;. Such norms, in other words, specify the distinctions between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;. Therefore, normative social distance differs from affective social distance, because it conceives social distance is conceived as a non-subjective, structural aspect of social relations. Examples of this conception can be found in some of the works of sociologists such as Georg Simmel, Emile Durkheim and to some extent Robert Park.
# Interactive social distance: Focuses on the frequency and intensity of interactions between two groups, claiming that the more the members of two groups interact, the closer they are socially. This conception is similar to the approaches in sociological network theory, where the frequency of interaction between two parties is used as a measure of the &quot;strength&quot; of the social ties between them.
# Cultural and habitual distance: Focuses cultural and habitual which is proposed by Bourdieu (1990). This type of distance is influenced by the &quot;capital&quot; people possess.

It is possible to view these different conceptions as &quot;dimensions&quot; of social distance, that do not necessarily overlap. The members of two groups might interact with each other quite frequently, but this does not always mean that they will feel &quot;close&quot; to each other or that normatively they will consider each other as the members of the same group. In other words, interactive, normative and affective dimensions of social distance might not be linearly associated.

==Measurement==
Some ways social distance can be measured include: direct observation of people interacting, questionnaires, speeded decision making tasks, route planning exercises, or other social drawing tasks (see sociogram).

Bogardus Social Distance Scale and its variations remain the most popular measure of social distance. In questionnaires based on Bogardus&#x27; scale, respondents are typically asked members of which groups they would accept in particular relationships. For example, to check whether or not they would accept a member of each group as a neighbor, as a fellow worker as a marriage partner. The social distance questionnaires may not accurately measure what people actually would do if a member of another group sought to become a friend or neighbour. The social distance scale is only an attempt to measure one&#x27;s feeling of unwillingness to associate equally with a group. What a person will actually do in a situation also depends upon the circumstances of the situation.

== Theoretical implications ==

=== Psychological distance ===
Some researchers have examined social distance as a form of psychological distance. Research in this vein has drawn connections between social distance, other kinds of psychological distance (such as temporal distance). This type of work also examined the effect of social distance on construal levels, suggesting that greater social distance promotes high-level and increase cognitive abstraction.

In speeded decision making tasks, studies have suggested a systematic relationship between social distance and physical distance. When asked to either indicate the spatial location of a presented word or verify a word&#x27;s presence, people respond more quickly when &quot;we&quot; was displayed in a spatially proximate versus spatially distant location and when &quot;others&quot; was displayed in a
spatially distant versus a spatially proximate location. This suggests that social distance and physical distance are conceptually related.

Route planning exercises have also hinted at a conceptual link between social distance and physical distance. When asked to draw a route on a map, people tend to draw routes closer to friends they pass along the way and further away from strangers. This effect is robust even after controlling for how easy it is for the people passing one another to communicate.

There is some evidence that reasoning about social distance and physical distance draw on shared processing resources in the human parietal cortex.

== Practical implications ==

===Prejudice===
Social distance can emerge between groups that differ on a variety of dimensions, including culture, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic class. Construal level theory suggests that greater social distance can contribute to a reliance on stereotypes when evaluating socially distant individuals/groups.

The relationship between social distance and prejudice is documented in studies of attitudes towards individuals who suffer from a mental illness. Distance from the mentally ill and the desire to maintain it depends on the diagnosis, and varies across age groups and nationalities. The desire to maintain social distance is reduced with exposure to/familiarity with mental illness, and increased with perceptions that mentally ill individuals are dangerous.

=== Generosity ===
Social distance has been incorporated in economic decision making experiments using the ultimatum game and the dictator game. In this line of work, researchers increase social distance by anonymizing economic decisions. This work finds that social distance reduces altruistic behavior. A similar line of work aimed to reduce social distance by increasing social cues, or by incorporating minimal forms of interaction. These manipulations showed that decreasing social distance increases generosity.

=== Power ===
Research on the relationship between power and social distance suggests that powerful individuals have a greater perception of distance from others. Based on construal level theory, this means that powerful individuals are more likely to engage in high-level construals. This connection between power, social distance, and construal level has been used to explain other features of cognitions and behaviors related to power, including findings that powerful individuals are less likely to be influenced by others [#45], and more likely to engage in stereotyping. This work also has important implications given that greater social distance reduces generosity.

=== Media influence ===
Social distance has also been examined in the context of third-person effects. The third-person effect describes individuals&#x27; tendency to assume that media messages have a greater influence on those other than themselves. Some work has shown that this effect increases the greater the distance from the self; in other words, the greater the social distance between an individual and a hypothetical target, the greater the perceived influence of the media message on the target. This phenomenon has been dubbed the social distance corollary.

=== Housing ===
&quot;Social periphery&quot; is a term often used in conjunction with social distance. It refers to people being &#x27;distant&#x27; with regard to social relations. It is often implied that it is measured from the dominant &quot;city élite&quot;. The social periphery of a city is often located in the centre.

&quot;Locational periphery&quot; in contrast is used to describe places physically distant from the heart of the city. These places often include suburbs which are socially close to the core of the city. In some cases the locational periphery overlaps with the social periphery, such as in Paris&#x27; &quot;banlieues&quot;.

In 1991, Geoff Mulgan stated that &quot;The centres of two cities are often for practical purposes closer to each other than to their own peripheries.&quot; This reference to social distance is especially true for global cities.

<text>National Insurance (NI) is a fundamental component of the welfare state in the United Kingdom. It acts as a form of social security, since payment of NI contributions establishes entitlement to certain state benefits for workers and their families.

Introduced by the National Insurance Act 1911 and expanded by the Attlee ministry in 1948, the system has been subjected to numerous amendments in succeeding years. Initially, it was a contributory form of insurance against illness and unemployment, and eventually provided retirement pensions and other benefits.

Currently, workers pay contributions from the age of sixteen years, until the age they become eligible for the State Pension. Contributions are due from employed people earning at or above a threshold called the Lower Earnings Limit, the value of which is reviewed each year. Self-employed people contribute through a percentage of net profits above a threshold, which is reviewed periodically. Individuals may also make voluntary contributions to fill a gap in their contributions record and thus protect their entitlement to benefits.

Contributions are collected by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). For employees, this is done through the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system along with Income Tax, repayments of Student Loans and any Apprenticeship Levy which the employer is liable to pay. National Insurance contributions form a significant proportion of the UK Government&#x27;s revenue, raising £145 billion in 2019-20 (representing 17.5% of all tax revenue).

The benefit component includes several contributory benefits, availability and amount of which is determined by the claimant&#x27;s contribution record and circumstances. Weekly income and some lump-sum benefits are provided for participants upon death, retirement, unemployment, maternity and disability. In order to obtain the benefits which are related to the contributions, a National Insurance number is necessary.

==History==

The current system of National Insurance has its roots in the National Insurance Act 1911, which introduced the concept of benefits based on contributions paid by employed people and their employer. William Martin-Smith was issued with the First NI number A1. The chosen means of recording the contributions required the employer to buy special stamps from a Post Office and affix them to contribution cards. The cards formed proof of entitlement to benefits and were given to the employee when the employment ended, leading to the loss of a job often being referred to as being &quot;given your cards&quot;, a phrase which endures to this day although the card itself no longer exists.

Initially there were two schemes running alongside each other, one for health and pension insurance benefits (administered by &quot;approved societies&quot; including friendly societies and some trade unions) and the other for unemployment benefit which was administered directly by Government. The Beveridge Report in 1942 proposed expansion and unification of the welfare state under a scheme of what was called social insurance. In March 1943 Winston Churchill in a broadcast entitled &quot;After the War&quot; committed the government to a system of &quot;national compulsory insurance for all classes for all purposes from the cradle to the grave.&quot;

After the Second World War, the Attlee government pressed ahead with the introduction of the Welfare State, of which an expanded National Insurance scheme was a major component. As part of this process, in 1948, a single stamp was introduced which covered all the benefits of the new Welfare State. At that point, responsibility passed to the new Ministry of National Insurance; many of the former approved societies went into liquidation as a result.

Stamp cards for class 1 (employed) contributions persisted until 1975 when these contributions finally ceased to be flat-rate and became earnings related, collected along with Income Tax under the PAYE procedures. Making NI contributions is still often described by people as &quot;paying their stamp&quot;.

As the system developed, the link between individual contributions and benefits was weakened.

=== National Insurance Fund ===

The National Insurance Funds are used to pay for certain types of welfare expenditure and National Insurance payments cannot be used directly to fund general government spending. However, any surplus in the funds is invested in government securities, and so is effectively lent to the government at low rates of interest. National Insurance contributions are paid into the various National Insurance Funds after deduction of monies specifically allocated to the National Health Services (NHS). However a small percentage is transferred from the funds to the NHS from certain of the smaller sub-classes. Thus the four NHS organisations are partially funded from NI contributions but not from the NI Fund. Less than half of benefit expenditure (42.1%) now goes on contributory benefits, compared with over 65% in 1978–79 because of the growth of means-tested benefits since the late 1970s.

An actuarial evaluation of the long-term prospects for the National Insurance system is mandated every 5 years, or whenever any changes are proposed to benefits or contributions. Such evaluations are conducted by the Government Actuary&#x27;s Department and the resulting reports must be presented to the UK Parliament. The most recent review was conducted as at April 2020, with the report being published two years later.

==Contributions==

The contributions component of the system, &quot;National Insurance Contributions&quot; (NICs) are paid by employees and employers on earnings, and by employers on certain benefits-in-kind provided to employees. The self-employed contribute partly by a fixed weekly or monthly payment, and partly on a percentage of net profits above a certain threshold. Individuals may also make voluntary contributions, in order to fill a gap in their contributions record and thus protect their entitlement to benefits. Contributions are collected by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) through the PAYE system, along with Income Tax and repayments of Student Loans and Postgraduate Loans.

People in certain circumstances, such as caring for a child, caring for a severely disabled person for more than 20 hours a week or claiming unemployment or sickness benefits, can gain National Insurance credits which protects their rights to various benefits.

National Insurance is a significant contributor to UK government revenues, with contributions estimated to comprise 18% of total revenue in the 2019/2020 financial year.

===Contribution classes===

National insurance contributions (NICs) fall into a number of classes. Class 1, 2 and 3 NICs paid are credited to an individual&#x27;s NI account, which determines eligibility for certain benefits - including the state pension. Class 1A, 1B and 4 NIC do not count towards benefit entitlements but must still be paid if due.

====Class 1====
Class 1 contributions are paid by employers and their employees. In law, the employee contribution is referred to as the &#x27;primary&#x27; contribution and the employer contribution as the &#x27;secondary&#x27;, but they are usually referred to simply as employee and employer contributions.

The employee contribution is deducted from gross wages by the employer, with no action required by the employee. The employer then adds in their own contribution and remits the total to HMRC along with income tax and other statutory deductions. Contributions for employees are calculated on a periodic basis, usually weekly or monthly depending on how the employee is paid, with no reference to earnings in previous periods. Those for company directors are calculated on an annual basis, to ensure that the correct level of NICs are collected regardless of how often the director chooses to be paid.

There are a number of milestone figures which determine the rate of NICs to be paid. These are the Lower Earnings Limit (LEL), Primary Threshold (PT), Secondary Threshold (ST) and Upper Earnings Limit (UEL), though often the PT and ST are set to the same value. The cash value of most of these figures normally changes each year, either in line with inflation or by some other amount decided by the Chancellor. The PT is normally indexed to inflation using the CPI, while other thresholds remain indexed using the RPI.

*On earnings below the LEL, no NICs are paid because no benefits accrue on earnings below this limit.
*On earnings above the LEL, up to and including the PT, employee contributions are not paid but are credited by the government as if they were (enabling certain low-paid workers to qualify for benefits).
*On earnings above the LEL, up to and including the ST, employer contributions are not paid. 
*On earnings above the PT/ST, up to and including the UEL, NICs are collected at a rate which is determined by a number of factors:
**Whether the employee has reached the age at which State Pension becomes payable
**Whether the employee is a married woman paying reduced-rate contributions. This facility was abolished on 11 May 1977 but women who were already paying these contributions at that time were allowed to opt to continue to do so for as long as they remained married (or widowed) and in employment
**Whether the employee is an ocean-going mariner or deep-sea fisherman.
**In the case of the employer contribution, whether the employee is aged under 21 or is an apprentice aged under 25.
*On earnings above the UEL yet another set of rates apply, this time depending only on whether the employee has reached the age at which State Pension becomes payable or is an ocean-going mariner or deep-sea fisherman

=====Table letters=====
As indicated above, the rates at which an individual and their employer pay contributions depend on a number of factors. Consequently, there are many possible sets of employer/employee contribution rates to allow for all combinations of the various factors. HMRC allocate a letter of the alphabet, referred to as an &#x27;NI Table Letter&#x27;, to each of these sets of contribution rates. Employers are responsible for allocating the correct table letter to each employee depending on their particular circumstances.

Each tax year, HMRC publish look-up tables for each table letter to assist with manual calculation of contributions, though these days most of the calculations are done by computer systems and the tables are available only as downloads. In addition, HMRC provide an online National Insurance Calculator.

=====Class 1A=====
Class 1A contributions were introduced from 6 April 1991, and are paid by employers on the value of company cars and certain other benefits in kind provided to their employees and directors, at the standard employer contribution percentage rate for the tax year. Class 1A contributions do not provide any benefit entitlement for individuals.

=====Class 1B=====
Class 1B contributions were introduced on 6 April 1999 and are payable by employers as part of a PAYE Settlement Agreement (an arrangement whereby the employer meets the tax liabilities on certain benefits). Class 1B contributions are paid at the same rate as Class 1A contributions and do not provide any benefit entitlement for individuals.

=====Contribution rates=====
Contribution rates are set for each tax year by the government.

The general rates for the tax year 2023/24 between 6 January and 5 April 2024 are shown below. For those who qualify for the mariners rates, the employee rates are as shown below and the non-zero employer rates are 0.5% lower than those shown below.


====Class 2====
Class 2 contributions are fixed weekly amounts paid by the self-employed until 5 April 2024. They are due regardless of trading profits or losses, but those with low earnings can apply for exemption from paying and those on high earnings with liability to either Class 1 or 4 can apply for deferment from paying. As of January 2020, self-employed National Insurance Contributions (NICs) will be categorised as Class 2 when profits are between £6,365 and £8,631.99 a year. If a self-employed worker earns £8,632 or more a year they will be categorised as Class 4. Class 2 contributions are charged at £3.00 per week and are usually paid by direct debit. While the amount is calculated to a weekly figure, they were typically paid monthly or quarterly until 2015. For future years, class 2 is collected as part of the tax self-assessment process. For the most part, unlike Class 1, they do not form part of a qualifying contribution record for contributions-based Jobseekers Allowance, but do count towards Employment and Support Allowance.

====Class 3====
Class 3 contributions are voluntary NICs paid by people wishing to fill a gap in their contributions record which has arisen either by not working or by their earnings being too low.

Class 3 contributions only count towards State Pension and Bereavement Benefit entitlement. The main reason for paying Class 3 NICs is to ensure that a person&#x27;s contribution record is preserved to provide entitlement to these benefits, though care needs to be taken not to pay unnecessarily as it is not necessary to have contributions in every year of a working life in order to qualify.

====Class 4====
Class 4 contributions are paid by self-employed people as a portion of their profits. The amount due is calculated with income tax at the end of the year, based on figures supplied on the SA100 tax return.

Contributions are based around two thresholds, the Lower Profits Limit (LPL) and the Upper Profits Limit (UPL). These have the same cash values as the Primary Threshold and Upper Earnings Limit used in Class 1 calculations.

*No class 4 NICs are due on profits up to and including the LPL.
*Above the LPL, up to and including the UPL, class 4 NICs are paid at a rate which can vary but has been 9% for several years.
*Above the UPL, class 4 NICs are paid at a second rate, which has been 2% for several years

Class 4 contributions do not form part of a qualifying contribution record for any benefits, including the State Pension, as self-employed people qualify for these benefits by paying Class 2 contributions.

====NI credits====
People who are unable to work for some reason may be able to claim NI credits (technically &quot;credited earnings&quot;, since 1987). These are equivalent to Class 1 NICs, though are not paid for. They are granted either to maintain a contributions record while not working, or to those applying for benefits whose contribution record is only slightly short of the requirements for those benefits. In the latter case, they cannot be used to fill &quot;gaps&quot; in past years in contribution records for some benefits.

==Benefits==

The benefit component comprises a number of &quot;contributory benefits&quot; of availability and amount determined by the claimant&#x27;s contribution record and circumstances. Weekly income benefits and some lump-sum benefits to participants upon death, retirement, unemployment, maternity and disability are provided.

===Current benefits===
Benefits for which there is a contribution condition:

*Bereavement benefit
*Employment and Support Allowance (new-style)
*Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance (new-style)
*Statutory Sick Pay
*State Pension

===Former benefits===
Historic benefits for which there was a contribution condition:

*Incapacity Benefit
*Invalidity Benefit
*State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme
*Unemployment Benefit
*Widowed Mother’s Allowance
*Widowed Parent&#x27;s Allowance
*Widow’s Pension

==National Insurance number==

To administer the National Insurance system, a National Insurance number is allocated to every child shortly after their birth when a claim to Child Benefit is made. People coming from overseas have to apply for a NI number before they can qualify for benefits; although holding a NI number is not a prerequisite for working in the UK, a tax code cannot be operated without one. An NI number is in the format: two letters, six digits and one further letter or a space. The example used is typically QQ123456C. It is usual to pair off the digits - such separators are seen on forms used by government departments (both internal and external, notably the P45 and P60).

==National Insurance and PAYE Service==
National Insurance contributions for all UK residents and some non-residents are recorded using the NPS computer system (&quot;National Insurance and PAYE Service&quot;). This came into use in June and July 2009 and brought NIC and Income Tax records together on one system for the first time.

The original National Insurance Recording System (NIRS) was a more archaic system first used in 1975 without direct user access to its records. A civil servant working within the Contributions Office (NICO) would have to request paper printouts of an individual&#x27;s account which could take up to two weeks to arrive. New information to be added to the account would be sent to specialised data entry operatives on paper to be input into NIRS.

NIRS/2, introduced in 1996, was a large and complex computer system which had several uses. These included individual applications to access or update an individual National Insurance account, to view employer&#x27;s National Insurance schemes and a general work management application. There was some controversy regarding the NIRS/2 system from its inception when problems with the new system attracted widespread media coverage. 

Due to these computer problems, Deficiency Notices (telling individuals of a possible shortfall in their contributions), which had been sent out on an annual basis prior to 1996, stopped being issued; the Inland Revenue took several years to clear the backlog. As a result, many customers were unaware whether they had incomplete years of contributions towards their State Pension (including women affected by the rise in State Pension age).

==Contribution rates – employees==
As noted above, the employee contribution was a flat rate stamp until 1975. After this, the rates have been as follows:

On 7 September 2021, the government announced an increase of NI rates by 1.25 percentage points for the 2022–23 tax year, breaking its 2019 manifesto promise. From 2023, a new health and social care levy charged at the 1.25% rate would be introduced with NI rates reverting to their previous rates. This move was reversed by new chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng effective 6 November 2022. 

In the early 2000s the lower threshold for employee contributions was aligned with the standard personal allowance for Income Tax but has since diverged significantly, as illustrated in the following table.

For 2015–16 there was therefore up to £304.80 payable by someone who has not reached the point where they are liable for Income Tax. This has risen to £352.80 for 2016–17, to £400.32 for 2017–18, to £411.12 for 2018-19 and to £464.16 for 2019–20. This fell to £360 for 2020–21.

The upper limit is currently set at the figure at which the higher rate of Income Tax becomes chargeable for a person on the standard personal allowance for Income Tax in all parts of the UK except Scotland (which can set its own level for the tax threshold, but not for the NI upper limit).

The 2019-24 government&#x27;s manifesto in the 2019 general election promised to restore the parity between the NI and Income Tax thresholds by the end of their first term in office. The limits were harmonised on 6 July 2022.

The limits and rates for the following tax year are normally announced at the same time as the autumn budget made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Current rates are shown on the hmrc.gov.uk website.

The calculation of contributions for employees has to be made on each pay period (for non-directors of a company). As a result and unlike Income Tax, a weekly paid employee will face a charge in any week where earnings exceed 1/52 of the annual limit. It is therefore possible for a charge to arise on someone who earns below the limit on an annual basis but who has occasional payments above the weekly limit.

A further complication is that an employee has an allowance per employer, unlike income tax where the allowance is split between employers via the person&#x27;s tax code. So a person with two low paid jobs would pay less, possibly nothing, than someone who earned the same amount from one job. In addition, no deductions are allowable unlike with Income Tax. This means that NI becomes payable on a greater share of income (immediately after the threshold).

<doc id="316849" wikidata="Q279454" url="?curid=316849" title="Hazard analysis and critical control points">
<text>Hazard analysis and critical control points, or HACCP (), is a systematic preventive approach to food safety from biological, chemical, and physical hazards in production processes that can cause the finished product to be unsafe and designs measures to reduce these risks to a safe level. In this manner, HACCP attempts to avoid hazards rather than attempting to inspect finished products for the effects of those hazards. The HACCP system can be used at all stages of a food chain, from food production and preparation processes including packaging, distribution, etc. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) require mandatory HACCP programs for juice and meat as an effective approach to food safety and protecting public health. Meat HACCP systems are regulated by the USDA, while seafood and juice are regulated by the FDA. All other food companies in the United States that are required to register with the FDA under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, as well as firms outside the US that export food to the US, are transitioning to mandatory hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls (HARPC) plans.

It is believed to stem from a production process monitoring used during World War II because traditional &quot;end of the pipe&quot; testing on artillery shells&#x27; firing mechanisms could not be performed, and a large percentage of the artillery shells made at the time were either duds or misfiring. HACCP itself was conceived in the 1960s when the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) asked Pillsbury to design and manufacture the first foods for space flights. Since then, HACCP has been recognized internationally as a logical tool for adapting traditional inspection methods to a modern, science-based, food safety system. Based on risk-assessment, HACCP plans allow both industry and government to allocate their resources efficiently by establishing and auditing safe food production practices. In 1994, the organization International HACCP Alliance was established, initially to assist the US meat and poultry industries with implementing HACCP. As of 2007, its membership spread over other professional and industrial areas.

HACCP has been increasingly applied to industries other than food, such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. This method, which in effect seeks to plan out unsafe practices based on science, differs from traditional &quot;produce and sort&quot; quality control methods that do nothing to prevent hazards from occurring and must identify them at the end of the process. HACCP is focused only on the health safety issues of a product and not the quality of the product, yet HACCP principles are the basis of most food quality and safety assurance systems. In the United States, HACCP compliance is regulated by 21 CFR part 120 and 123. Similarly, FAO and WHO published a guideline for all governments to handle the issue in small and less developed food businesses.

==History==
In the early 1960s, a collaborated effort between the Pillsbury Company, NASA, and the U.S. Army Laboratories began with the objective to provide safe food for space expeditions. People involved in this collaboration included Herbert Hollander, Mary Klicka, and Hamed El-Bisi of the United States Army Laboratories in Natick, Massachusetts, Paul A. Lachance of the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas, and Howard E. Baumann representing Pillsbury as its lead scientist.

To ensure that the food sent to space was safe, Lachance imposed strict microbial requirements, including pathogen limits (including &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;Salmonella&quot;, and &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;). Using the traditional end product testing method, it was soon realized that almost all of the food manufactured was being used for testing and very little was left for actual use. Therefore, a new approach was needed.

NASA&#x27;s own requirements for critical control points (CCP) in engineering management would be used as a guide for food safety. CCP derived from failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) from NASA via the munitions industry to test weapon and engineering system reliability. Using that information, NASA and Pillsbury required contractors to identify &quot;critical failure areas&quot; and eliminate them from the system, a first in the food industry then. Baumann, a microbiologist by training, was so pleased with Pillsbury&#x27;s experience in the space program that he advocated for his company to adopt what would become HACCP at Pillsbury.

Soon, Pillsbury was confronted with a food safety issue of its own when glass contamination was found in farina, a cereal commonly used in infant food. Baumann&#x27;s leadership promoted HACCP in Pillsbury for producing commercial foods, and applied to its own food production. This led to a panel discussion at the 1971 National Conference on Food Protection that included examining CCPs and good manufacturing practices in producing safe foods. Several botulism cases were attributed to under-processed low-acid canned foods in 1970–71. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asked Pillsbury to organize and conduct a training program on the inspection of canned foods for FDA inspectors. This 21-day program was first held in September 1972 with 11 days of classroom lecture and 10 days of canning plant evaluations. Canned food regulations (21 CFR 108, 21 CFR 110, 21 CFR 113, and 21 CFR 114) were first published in 1969. Pillsbury&#x27;s training program, which was submitted to the FDA for review in 1969, entitled &quot;Food Safety through the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point System&quot; was the first use of the acronym HACCP.

HACCP was initially set on three principles, now shown as principles one, two, and four in the section below. Pillsbury quickly adopted two more principles, numbers three and five, to its own company in 1975. It was further supported by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) when they wrote that the FDA inspection agency should transform itself from reviewing plant records into an HACCP system compliance auditor.

Over the period 1986 to 1990, a team consisting of National Sea Products and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans developed the first mandatory food inspection programme based on HACCP principles in the world. Together, these Canadian innovators developed and implemented a Total Quality Management Program and HACCP plans for all their groundfish trawlers and production facilities.

A second proposal by the NAS led to the development of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF) in 1987. NACMCF was initially responsible for defining HACCP&#x27;s systems and guidelines for its application and were coordinated with the Codex Alimentarius Committee for Food Hygiene, that led to reports starting in 1992 and further harmonization in 1997. By 1997, the seven HACCP principles listed below became the standard.

A year earlier, the American Society for Quality offered their first certifications for HACCP Auditors. First known as Certified Quality Auditor-HACCP, they were changed to Certified HACCP Auditor (CHA) in 2004.

HACCP expanded in all realms of the food industry, going into meat, poultry, seafood, dairy, and has spread now from the farm to the fork.

==Principles==

# Conduct a hazard analysis
#: Plan to determine the food safety hazards and identify the preventive measures that can be applied to control these hazards. A food safety hazard is any biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption.
# Identify critical control points
#: A critical control point (CCP) is a point, step, or procedure in a food manufacturing process at which control can be applied and, as a result, a food safety hazard can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to an acceptable level.
# Establish critical limits for each critical control point
#: A critical limit is the maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical hazard must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce that hazard to an acceptable level.
# Establish critical control point monitoring requirements
#: Monitoring activities are necessary to ensure that the process is under control at each critical control point. In the United States, the FSIS requires that each monitoring procedure and its frequency be listed in the HACCP plan.
# Establish corrective actions
#: These are actions to be taken when monitoring indicates a deviation from an established critical limit. The final rule requires a plant&#x27;s HACCP plan to identify the corrective actions to be taken if a critical limit is not met. Corrective actions are intended to ensure that no product is injurious to health or otherwise adulterated as a result if the deviation enters commerce.
# Establish procedures for ensuring the HACCP system is working as intended
#: Validation ensures that the plans do what they were designed to do; that is, they are successful in ensuring the production of a safe product. Plants will be required to validate their own HACCP plans. FSIS will not approve HACCP plans in advance, but will review them for conformance with the final rule.
#: Verification ensures the HACCP plan is adequate, that is, working as intended. Verification procedures may include such activities as review of HACCP plans, CCP records, critical limits and microbial sampling and analysis. FSIS is requiring that the HACCP plan include verification tasks to be performed by plant personnel. Verification tasks would also be performed by FSIS inspectors. Both FSIS and industry will undertake microbial testing as one of several verification activities.
#: Verification also includes &#x27;validation&#x27; – the process of finding evidence for the accuracy of the HACCP system (e.g. scientific evidence for critical limitations).
# Establish record keeping procedures
#: The HACCP regulation requires that all plants maintain certain documents, including its hazard analysis and written HACCP plan, and records documenting the monitoring of critical control points, critical limits, verification activities, and the handling of processing deviations. Implementation involves monitoring, verifying, and validating of the daily work that is compliant with regulatory requirements in all stages all the time. The differences among those three types of work are given by Saskatchewan Agriculture and Food.

==Standards==
The seven HACCP principles are included in the international standard ISO 22000. This standard is a complete food safety and quality management system incorporating the elements of prerequisite programmes(GMP &amp; SSOP), HACCP and the quality management system, which together form an organization&#x27;s Total Quality Management system.

Other schemes with recognition from the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI), such as Safe Quality Food Institute&#x27;s SQF Code, also relies upon the HACCP methodology as the basis for developing and maintaining food safety (level 2) and food quality (level 3) plans and programs in concert with the fundamental prerequisites of good manufacturing practices.

==Training==
Training for developing and implementing HACCP food safety management system are offered by several quality assurance companies.
However, ASQ
does provide a Trained HACCP Auditor (CHA) exam to
individuals seeking professional training.
In the UK the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH) and Royal Society for Public Health offer HACCP for Food Manufacturing qualifications, accredited by the QCA
(Qualifications and Curriculum Authority).

==Application==
Consequent to the promulgation of US Seafood Regulation on HACCP on 18 December 1995, it became mandatory that every processor exporting to USA to comply with HACCP with effect from 18.12.1997. The Marine Products Export Development Authority of India (MPEDA) constituted an HACCP Cell in early 1996 to assist the Indian seafood industry in the effective implementation of HACCP. Technical personnel of MPEDA are trained in India and abroad on various aspects of HACCP including HACCP Audit. Seafood Exporters Association of India has eight regional offices to monitor compliance and members use the latest sustainable aquaculture practices and a high-tech hatchery that provides disease-resistant baby shrimp and fingerlings to its own farm, and to hundreds of farmers who supply raw shrimp to major brands Falcon Marine, Devi Seafoods, Ananda Group, Gadre Marine and Mukka Seafood.

==Water quality management==
The use of HACCP for water quality management was first proposed in 1994. Thereafter, a number of water quality initiatives applied HACCP principles and steps to the control of infectious disease from water, and provided the basis for the Water Safety Plan (WSP) approach in the third edition of the WHO &quot;Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality&quot; report. This WSP has been described as &quot;a way of adapting the HACCP approach to drinking water systems&quot;.

===Water quality management programme guidelines===
Program Modernization: According to Ongley, 1998, a series of steps could be taken to execute a more useful transition – from technical programmes to policy to management decisions. Various aspects of the modernization process have been discussed by Ongley in ESCAP (1997):
* Policy reform – A consultative process must define all the policy tenets and should review the execution of the said policy tenets.
* Legal reform – Legal reform with respect to water quality management is one of the most crucial elements. This could be addressed by the creation of national data standards as well as the creation of a national process to analyze and review collected data.
* Institutional reform – This is a complex issue and has no simple answers. Still, there are some key principles that can be helpful for institutional reform in light of water quality management. One of them is water quality monitoring as a service function. Apart from that, both technical efficiency and capacity issues emerge as major factors in reformed water quality programs.
* Technical reform – This is the area that garners the most attention as well as investment. Such a reform targets facility modernization, including other co-factors like data programmes/networks, technical innovation, data management/data products and remediation.

==HACCP for building water systems==
Hazards associated with water systems in buildings include physical, chemical and microbial hazards. In 2013, NSF International, a public health and safety NGO, established education, training and certification programs in HACCP for building water systems. The programs, championed by NSF Executive VP Clif McLellan, were developed by subject matter experts Aaron Rosenblatt (Co-founder of Gordon &amp; Rosenblatt, LLC) and William McCoy (Co-founder of Phigenics, Inc.) center on the use of HACCP principles adapted to the specific requirements of domestic (hot and cold) and utility (Cooling Towers, etc.) water systems in buildings, to prevent plumbing-associated hazards from harming people. Hazards addressed include scalding, lead, and disinfection byproducts as well as a range of clinically-important pathogens, such as &quot;Legionella&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Early adopters of HACCP for building water systems include leading healthcare institutions, notably the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

==ISO 22000 Food Safety Management System==
ISO 22000 is a standard designed to help augment HACCP on issues related to food safety. Although several companies, especially big ones, have either implemented or are on the point of implementing ISO 22000, there are many others which are hesitant to do so. The main reason behind that is the lack of information and the fear that the new standard is too demanding in terms of bureaucratic work. ISO 22000 references the Codex Alimentarius General Principles of Food Hygiene, CXC 1-1969 which includes HACCP principles and 12 HACCP application steps. This is explained in a joint publication from ISO and United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) which provides guidance to assist all organizations (including small and medium-sized) that recognize the potential benefits of implementing a Food Safety Management System.

<doc id="316851" wikidata="Q300338" url="?curid=316851" title="A Boy Named Sue">
<text>&quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot; is a song written by Shel Silverstein and made famous by Johnny Cash. Cash recorded the song live in concert on February 24, 1969, at California&#x27;s San Quentin State Prison for his &quot;At San Quentin&quot; album. Cash also performed the song (with comical variations on the original performance) in December 1969 at Madison Square Garden. The live San Quentin version of the song became Cash&#x27;s biggest hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and his only top ten single there, spending three weeks at No. 2 in 1969, held out of the top spot by &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; by The Rolling Stones. The track also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs and Easy Listening charts that same year and was certified Gold on August 14, 1969, by the RIAA.

Silverstein&#x27;s recording was released the same year as &quot;Boy Named Sue&quot;, a single on the album &quot;Boy Named Sue (and His Other Country Songs)&quot;, produced by Chet Atkins and Felton Jarvis.

==Content==
The song tells the tale of a young man&#x27;s quest for revenge on a father who abandoned him at three years of age and whose only contribution to his entire life was giving him a guitar and naming him Sue, commonly a feminine name, which results in the young man suffering from ridicule and harassment by everyone he meets. Ashamed of his name, he becomes a hard-hearted nomad as a young man; he swears that he will find and kill his father for giving him &quot;that awful name&quot;.

Sue later locates his father at a tavern one summer day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and after recognizing him by the scar on his cheek and his evil eye confronts him by saying, &quot;My name is Sue! How do you do? Now you&#x27;re gonna die!&quot; This results in a vicious brawl that spills outdoors into a muddy street. As the two pull their guns on each other, Sue&#x27;s father smiles with pride and admits that he is the man (&quot;son of a bitch&quot; in the Johnny Cash version) that named him Sue. Because Sue&#x27;s father knew that he would not be there for his son, he gave him the name as an act of tough love, believing (correctly) that the ensuing ridicule would force him to &quot;get tough or die&quot;. Learning this, Sue makes peace and reconciles with his father. Sue closes the song conceding his father&#x27;s point of view, but that if he ever has a son, he will name the boy &quot;Bill, or George, any damn thing but Sue&quot; because he &quot;still hate(s) that name.&quot;

==Structure==
The song has an unusual AABCCB rhyme scheme, broken only to mark the midpoint and end. The song is performed mostly in the speech-like style of talking blues rather than conventional singing.

==Censorship==
The term &quot;son of a bitch&quot; in the line &quot;I&#x27;m the son of a bitch that named you Sue!&quot; was bleeped out in the Johnny Cash version both on the single and the &quot;At San Quentin&quot; album and the final line was also edited to remove the word &quot;damn&quot;. Both the edited and unedited versions are available on various albums and compilations. The term &quot;son of a bitch&quot; was edited to &quot;son of a gun&quot; or altogether bleeped out in some versions. When performing the song live in later performances (such as in April 1970 at the White House and in 1994 at the Glastonbury Festival, for example), Cash would himself utter a bleep-censor sound instead of the word. The unedited version of the original San Quentin performance is included on later reissues of the &quot;At San Quentin&quot; album and Cash&#x27;s posthumous &quot;The Legend of Johnny Cash&quot; album. Silverstein does not utter any profanity in his original version, with Sue&#x27;s father instead identifying himself as the &quot;heartless hound&quot; that named him Sue.

==Inspiration==
The core story of the song may have been inspired by humorist Jean Shepherd, a close friend of Silverstein, who was often taunted as a child because of his feminine-sounding name.

The song might also have been inspired by the male attorney Sue K. Hicks of Madisonville, Tennessee, a friend of John Scopes who agreed to be a prosecutor in what was to become known as the &quot;Scopes Monkey Trial&quot;. Hicks was named after his mother, who died giving birth to him. Cash sent two autographed albums and photos of himself, all signed &quot;To sue, how do you do?&quot;.

In his autobiography, Cash wrote that he had just received the song and only read over it a couple of times. It was included in that concert to try it out—he did not know the words, and he can be seen regularly referring to a piece of paper on the filmed recording. Cash was surprised at how well the song went over with the audience. The rough, spontaneous performance with sparse accompaniment was included in the &quot;Johnny Cash At San Quentin&quot; album, ultimately becoming one of Cash&#x27;s biggest hits. According to Cash biographer Robert Hilburn, neither the British TV crew filming the concert nor his band knew he planned to perform the song; he used a lyric sheet on stage while Perkins and the band improvised the backing on the spot. While another song, &quot;San Quentin&quot;, was expected to be the significant new song featured in the concert and subsequent album (so much so the album includes two performances of &quot;San Quentin&quot;), &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot; ended up being the concert&#x27;s major find.

Cash also performed it on his musical variety show, ending the song with the line, &quot;And if I ever have a son, I think I&#x27;m gonna name him... John Carter Cash&quot;, referring to his newborn son. Cash also performed this variant at the White House in April 1970; in later years, however, he would restore the original &quot;any name but Sue&quot; ending, but change the wording to &quot;if I ever have another son&quot;. When Cash performed with The Highwaymen in the 1980s and 1990s, he would end the song by saying, &quot;if I ever have another boy, I think I&#x27;m gonna name him Waylon, or Willie, or Kris.&quot; referring to bandmates Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson.

According to Shel Silverstein&#x27;s biographer Mitch Myers, June Carter Cash encouraged her husband to perform the song. Silverstein introduced it to them at what they called a &quot;Guitar Pull,&quot; where musicians would pass a guitar around and play their songs.

Silverstein later wrote a follow-up named &quot;The Father of a Boy Named Sue&quot; in his 1978 &quot;Songs and Stories&quot; in which he tells the old man&#x27;s point of view of the story. The only known recording of the song by a major artist is by Shel Silverstein himself. Various cover artists have covered this song since then.

Cash performed the song at the Nixon White House in 1970, at the request of an aide.

At the 12th Annual Grammy Awards in 1970, Cash won the &quot;Best Country Vocal Performance, Male&quot; award and Silverstein won &quot;Best Country Song&quot; for the song.

==Impact on popular culture==
A number of parodies and covers of the song appeared in 1970. American–French artist Joe Dassin covered the song on his fourth studio album, released in 1970, as &quot;Un Garçon Nommé Suzy&quot;; the lyrics were translated to French by Pierre Delanoë. Comedian Martin Mull wrote a parody titled &quot;A Girl Named Johnny Cash&quot; which was recorded in 1970 by Jane Morgan and reached No. 61 on Billboard&#x27;s country charts. &quot;MAD Magazine&quot; issue No. 137 (September 1970) included a parody titled &quot;A Boy Dog Named Lassie&quot;, based on the fact that the &quot;Lassie&quot; movies and TV series employed male Collies in the female title role.

The gender-bending implications of the title have been adapted to explore issues of sex and gender, another use of the popular song title that goes beyond its original scope. The 2001 documentary &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot; features a transgender protagonist and uses the song in the soundtrack. &quot;A Boy Named Sue: Gender and Country Music&quot; is the title of a 2004 book about the role of gender in American country music.

In Winston Groom&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and its 1995 sequel &quot;Gump and Co.&quot;, the title character explores the world with a male ape named Sue, who had been a NASA test animal. The ape is never mentioned in the 1994 &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; movie.

In the film &quot;Swingers&quot;, one of the male characters is named Sue. Another character explains the name by saying, &quot;his dad was a big Johnny Cash fan.&quot;

&quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot; is referenced in the Red Hot Chili Peppers song &quot;Save This Lady.&quot;

The Stone Temple Pilots&#x27; song &quot;Crackerman&quot; references &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot; in the second verse.

Big John Bates did an uptempo cover of the song for a Johnny Cash compilation record in 2009.

<doc id="316857" wikidata="Q1111300" url="?curid=316857" title="8 Simple Rules">
<text>8 Simple Rules (originally 8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter) is an American television sitcom originally starring John Ritter and Katey Sagal as middle-class parents Paul and Cate Hennessy, raising their three children. Kaley Cuoco, Amy Davidson, and Martin Spanjers co-starred as their teenage kids: Bridget, Kerry, and Rory. The series ran on ABC from September 17, 2002, to April 15, 2005. The first season focused on Paul being left in charge of the children after Cate takes a full-time job as a nurse, with comedic emphasis on his often strict rules concerning his daughters and dating. The series&#x27; name and premise were derived from the book &quot;8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter&quot; by W. Bruce Cameron.

While &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; was renewed for a second season and production had begun, Ritter&#x27;s sudden death on September 11, 2003, left the series in an uncertain position. After a hiatus, the series returned and killed off his character. James Garner and David Spade later joined the main cast as Cate&#x27;s father Jim Egan and her nephew C.J. Barnes. In May 2005, after three seasons, ABC cancelled &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; due to low ratings.

==Episodes==

==Characters==

===Main===
* Paul Hennessy, portrayed by John Ritter (2002–2003), is a former sportswriter who works from home as a lifestyle columnist. He is a protective father whose nature often embarrasses his children and leads them to accuse him of hypocrisy. Following Ritter&#x27;s death, Paul dies offscreen early in the second season, having suddenly collapsed in a grocery store while buying milk.
* Cate S. Hennessy (née Egan), portrayed by Katey Sagal, is the wife, mother, nurse, and easily the most sane and composed person in the family. She takes a nursing job at the kids&#x27; school so that she can work standard hours and spend more time with the kids. Cate starts dating her kids&#x27; high-school principal, Ed Gibb (portrayed by Adam Arkin), towards the end of Season 3. During her teens, she was just as popular, scheming, and rebellious as Bridget, and as such, she is usually the first to notice when Bridget is up to something. Her middle name is Stinky because her father had promised his best friend that he would name one of his children after him after having accidentally stabbed him with a bayonet while they were drunk in Korea; to hide this, she claims that the &quot;S&quot; stands for Stacy.
* Bridget Erin &quot;Beach&quot; Hennessy, portrayed by Kaley Cuoco, is the beautiful, ditzy oldest child. She is depicted as a stereotypical blonde, a popular bombshell who is preoccupied with her looks, teenage boys, and little else. However, she sometimes displays intelligence or profundity in a poignant manner. Her favorite book is J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. After her father dies, she begins to steadily mature. Bridget immediately feels guilty about Paul&#x27;s death because the last words that she had ever spoken to him were &quot;I hate you&quot; after arguing with him on the morning of his death. In Season 2, Bridget is revealed to have been conceived on a beach.
* Kerry &quot;Care Bear&quot; Hennessy, portrayed by Amy Davidson, is the disgruntled middle child. She is often seen as unattractive when compared to her beautiful older sister. Bridget accuses her of stealing her boyfriend Kyle, though her own actions had driven Kyle away. Kerry is typically negative and sarcastic, often making snide remarks about others. She is also a passionate activist who cares about animal rights. She loses her virginity to Bruno (her boyfriend in Europe) later in the third season. She is often annoyed at her sister and is easily upset, yet frequently the two girls team up against their parents&#x27; authority or at the expense of their brother. Kerry is also very artistic and keeps a sketchbook. She is the smart child, but often shows naiveté. After she starts dating Bridget&#x27;s popular ex-boyfriend Kyle, her own popularity increases, and she begins to act a bit more like her older sister.
* Rory Joseph Hennessy, portrayed by Martin Spanjers, is Cate and Paul&#x27;s son and their youngest child. He often takes pleasure in on his sisters. Usually he waits until his sisters have already committed an infraction, then tells his father, who explodes. Rory is his father&#x27;s favorite child. He becomes involved in money-making schemes with C.J. He is commonly seen playing in the living room and mentions wanting a monkey; he had once acquired a monkey by trading some of his father&#x27;s baseball cards, and later traded the monkey for a guitar. He also delights in showing his friends the private aspects of his sister Bridget&#x27;s life, mentioning once that his friends looted Bridget&#x27;s underwear drawer. Rory is hit hard by Paul&#x27;s death and punches a hole in his wall out of anger, cutting his hand. He explains the injury as a burn from having removed a hot casserole from the oven. After he enters high school, Rory matures, leaving C.J. to be the main er of the family.
* Jim Egan, portrayed by James Garner (2003–2005), is Cate&#x27;s father. Jim served in the Korean War and is proud of his service (he becomes angry whenever the war is called a &quot;police action&quot;). He is very protective of the family. He often sneaks away to smoke tobacco. He is divorced, having formerly resided in Florida before moving into Cate&#x27;s basement, and often tries to beat C.J. with his cane. He takes pride in C.J.&#x27;s success as a teacher.
* C.J. Barnes, portrayed by David Spade (2004–2005), is Cate&#x27;s nephew. He was once in the army and claims to have studied aerial photography during the Gulf War, and to have received a Purple Heart in combat, which is in contrast to his generally childish attitude. He is a teacher who often pursues women, though unsuccessfully. When C.J. first arrives, the family is initially surprised. He reveals that he was ashamed that he did not live up to Paul&#x27;s expectations and avoided them because of that. He lives with his grandfather, Jim, in the basement (having previously lived in a van, which Jim had burned). He once dated Mrs. Krupp, Kerry and Bridget&#x27;s math teacher, but cheated on her with his ex-girlfriend Cheryl. He reveals that his first initial stands for Corey. C.J. previously smoked marijuana heavily (and in fact used to smoke with Kyle&#x27;s older brother), but he claims to not have touched it in two years (he originally claims it was five years, though he relents after Jim expresses disbelief).

===Recurring===
* Kyle, portrayed by Billy Aaron Brown, is Bridget&#x27;s – and later Kerry&#x27;s – boyfriend. He is often seen spending time with Rory when not with either Kerry or Bridget. His father, Tommy, used to work with Paul.
* Ed Gibb, portrayed by Adam Arkin, is the principal of the local high school. He and Cate knew each other in high school, and even dated. Their accounts of their first romantic encounter are different, each professing to have had more self-control. Despite this, they have some very intimate moments.
*Nick Sharpe, portrayed by Patrick Warburton, is Paul’s editor at the newspaper. He takes Paul’s place at the sports writer’s poker game and he and Paul frequently commiserate about having teenage daughters. 
* Coach Scott, portrayed by Dan Cortese, is a high-school coach on whom Bridget had a crush. He likes Cate, and Cate initially likes him, but then discovers Bridget&#x27;s crush, which causes her to deny Scott&#x27;s romantic advances towards her.
* Jenna Sharpe, portrayed by Nikki Danielle Moore (2003–2005), is the daughter of Paul&#x27;s boss Nick, and one of Bridget&#x27;s rivals, who later becomes her friend. She has a younger sister, Rachael (Nicole Mansour), who is a friend of Kerry.
* Missy Kleinfeld, portrayed by Daniella Monet (2003–2004), is Rory&#x27;s love interest in Season 2. She has a sister, Sissy (Elena Lyons), who likes C.J.
* Jeremy, portrayed by Jonathan Taylor Thomas (2004), is Bridget&#x27;s tutor and eventual boyfriend. He is considered a nerd at school, and because of this, Bridget at first denies her interest in him.
* Anthony W., portrayed by Cole Williams (2002–2003), is a student in Bridget&#x27;s class. He is a white boy who speaks like a black rapper, often resulting in confusion. In &quot;Cool Parent&quot;, he is shown to play lacrosse.
* Maggie Barnes (née Egan), portrayed by Cybill Shepherd, is Cate&#x27;s sister and C.J.&#x27;s mother. Maggie shares the same sensitive, moody nature as Kerry. However, it appears (from a conversation between Ed Gibb and Cate) that Cate was the smarter one, as well as being more popular.
* Fred Doyle, portrayed by John Ratzenberger, is a persistent and overly friendly neighbor of the Hennessys, and husband of Mary Ellen (portrayed originally by Shelley Long and then by Cindy Williams). He is the father of Donald &quot;Donny&quot; Doyle, who has dated Bridget for some time. Fred is the head of the neighborhood watch, and his family is religious.
* Mrs. Crupp, portrayed by Suzy Nakamura, is a math teacher at the school.
* Damian, portrayed by Paul Wesley, is Bridget&#x27;s ex-boyfriend who appears in two episodes.

===Ritter&#x27;s death===
The first three episodes of the series&#x27; second season had been completed when Ritter experienced discomfort during a rehearsal on the afternoon of September 11, 2003. Crew members took him to a nearby hospital, Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center, where he was misdiagnosed as having a heart attack and, as a result, his condition had worsened when physicians later diagnosed him with an aortic dissection. He died that night at the age of 54. Two days after Ritter’s emotional funeral, Disney CEO, Michael Eisner weighed in with an email to ABC Entertainment Chairman, Lloyd Braun, and President, Susan Lyne, outlining how they should resume the series; Eisner proposed that Cate, Ritter’s wife in the show, played by Katey Sagal, be pregnant (she’d had a pregnancy scare in an earlier episode). Then she could give birth for the May sweeps week. Before the TV executives could respond, Eisner’s number-two (Disney’s President and COO), Bob Iger, weighed in with an email, cheerleading his boss’s proposal. Nevertheless, Braun and Lyne were both appalled; they were still undecided about resuming the series at all, but to suggest that Ritter’s character would be leaving a baby behind was going too far. It seemed unspeakably exploitative to capitalize on Ritter’s death by making his wife pregnant and having her give birth during the May sweeps. After highly emotional arguments between both factions, where Eisner accused Braun and Lyne of behaving as elitists, the pregnancy pitch eventually faded.

Following Ritter&#x27;s death, ABC announced that &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; would continue after a hiatus and would incorporate the death of Ritter&#x27;s character. The three new episodes that Ritter had completed were aired with an introduction by Sagal.

&quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; returned two months after Ritter&#x27;s death with a one-hour episode, &quot;Goodbye&quot;, which was turned into a tribute to Ritter&#x27;s character. Subsequent episodes dealt with the family&#x27;s reaction to his death and how they moved on from it. The first four post-Ritter episodes were shot without a live audience with James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette guest-starring as Cate&#x27;s strict parents and David Spade guest-starring as Cate&#x27;s wayward nephew, C.J. Barnes. Garner and Spade later received starring roles in order to fill the void left by Ritter for the remainder of the series&#x27; run.

===Third season and cancellation===
Before Ritter&#x27;s death, &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; ranked 42nd in the Nielsen ratings. After Ritter&#x27;s death, it had slipped to 50th, but was renewed for a third season, in which ABC moved the series to Friday at 8:00 p.m. as part of its &quot;TGIF&quot; comedy line-up. The series&#x27; creator and show-runner, Tracy Gamble, left the series for a time over creative differences prior to the third season, but he later returned as a consulting producer midway through the season. Gamble was replaced by Judd Pillot and John Peaslee, who had performed the same role in the final season of Spade&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot;. The series plunged to 94th in the ratings. Even before the third-season finale&#x27;s airing, rumors began circulating that &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; was facing cancellation because of Ritter&#x27;s death and poor ratings. The Friday night &quot;death slot&quot; ratings took their toll on &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;. The third-season finale was not aired for May sweeps. The finale received a 3.9/8 rating share, which gave ABC a third-place finish behind NBC&#x27;s &quot;Dateline&quot; (5.8/11) and CBS&#x27;s &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; (4.9/10), which starred Ritter&#x27;s son, Jason. ABC officially cancelled &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; in May 2005.

== Syndication ==
While the ratings for &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; were well above those of the surrounding &quot;TGIF&quot; shows during the show&#x27;s third season, ABC canceled it because of a perceived inability to sell reruns of the show into syndication; a fourth season would have given the show one hundred episodes, traditionally considered the minimum number of episodes necessary for a show to successfully enter daily syndication.

On July 11, 2005 (less than two months after ABC officially canceled the show), The WB network announced that it would air all 76 episodes of &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; from 4–5 p.m. as part of its replacement of Kids&#x27; WB with the Daytime WB block, aimed at a broader audience. The show aired weekdays from January 2, 2006, to September 15, 2006, when it was replaced by &quot;Reba&quot; upon the merger of UPN and The WB into The CW.

On Tuesday, June 12, 2007, the show joined the ABC Family lineup, airing weekdays from 6:00 to 7:00 p.m. In September 2008, the show began airing from 3:00 to 4:00 p.m., continuing at that time until October 10, 2008. On October 3, 2009, &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; returned to ABC Family, having been absent for a year, airing on Saturdays from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m., and Sundays from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Airings have been sporadic because of the channel&#x27;s unpredictable movie schedule and holiday programming block. On February 8, 2010, the series was added back to ABC Family&#x27;s weekday lineup, airing from 6:00 to 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time, replacing &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;. After a few more months of absence, &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; resumed on ABC Family at 7:00 p.m. ET on select weekend mornings, beginning on July 18, 2010. In mid-December 2012, &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; was removed from ABC Family&#x27;s weekday lineup, only to be added back in September 2013. The series was removed from the network&#x27;s lineup once again in 2014.

In the United Kingdom, the show began airing on the Disney Channel in 2003, with the episodes edited for a children&#x27;s audience. It was picked up by ABC1, which aired it until the channel&#x27;s closure in 2007. The same year, Channel 5 began airing Season 1 of the series. From 2008, all three seasons of the show were aired on 5*. The series was aired uncut on subsequent channels following its cancellation by Disney Channel. Both Channel 5 and 5* aired the series in its original widescreen format. In 2017, Comedy Central obtained the rights to the show and started airing it on June 12, 2017.

In Denmark, &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; aired on TV3.

In Canada, the show aired on YTV and ABC Spark (the Canadian version of Freeform).

In the Republic of Ireland, &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; aired on RTÉ Two. Later, rights to the show were acquired by TG4, which aired the series weeknights at 5:35 p.m. The series was shown on both channels uncut, despite the early time of day, but the show was issued an age rating. On RTÉ Two, it was issued a &quot;PS&quot; rating and, on TG4, a &quot;12&quot; rating.

In Israel, the show aired on satellite provider yes, using its shortened title &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; in Hebrew (&quot;8 כללים פשוטים&quot;).

==Home media==
On August 7, 2007, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released Season 1 of &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Season 1 was released in the UK on September 1, 2008.

In August 2008, Lionsgate Home Entertainment announced that it had acquired the rights to the series from ABC Studios. Lionsgate subsequently released Season 2 on DVD in Region 1 on May 19, 2009.
The first 2 seasons of the series were released on Disney+ on May 20, 2022. For reasons unknown, season 3 is absent from the service.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season reports a 57% approval rating, based on 21 reviews. In a review for &quot;Variety&quot;, Michael Speier deemed the series unoriginal, but did praise the cast performances, especially John Ritter. Critical of the show&#x27;s humor, he did go on to comment, &quot;nothing even remotely deep here, but &quot;Rules&quot; isn&#x27;t as silly as some of its plotlines suggest. Going for the mass appeal, bow&#x27;s reach goes a little too far, trying to appease every single potential audience member off the bat with standard-fare jokes about clothing, dating and busy spouses. It would really be something if execs went for the slowburn once in a while, letting some of these shows breathe before jamming punchlines down viewers&#x27; throats.&quot;

The second season reports a 60% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 5 reviews.

<text>Eastern Armenian () is one of the two standardized forms of Modern Armenian, the other being Western Armenian. The two standards form a pluricentric language.

Eastern Armenian is spoken in Armenia, Russia, as well as Georgia, and by the Armenian community in Iran. Although the Eastern Armenian spoken by Armenians in Armenia and Iranian-Armenians are similar, there are pronunciation differences with different inflections.
Armenians from Iran also have some words that are unique to them. Due to migrations of speakers from Armenia and Iran to the Armenian diaspora, the dialect is now very prominent in countries and regions where only Western Armenian was used. Eastern Armenian is based on the Yerevan dialect.

== Official status and recognition ==

Eastern Armenian is, for the most part, mutually intelligible by educated or literate users of Western Armenian – and vice versa. Conversely, semi-literate or illiterate users of lower registers of either variety may have difficulty understanding the other.

The official language, according to law, of Armenia is an unspecified &quot;Armenian&quot;. In practice, however, Eastern Armenian is the &quot;de facto&quot;, day-to-day common language of Armenia. For example, commercial translations are generally completed in Eastern Armenian.
Until 2018, both varieties shared the same ISO 639-3 code: hye. However, on 23 January 2018, a code specifically for Western Armenian was added to ISO 639-3: &quot;hyw&quot;. (The previous code under ISO 639-1 was &quot;hy&quot;.)

The Armenian Wikipedia is predominantly composed of Eastern Armenian content. As a result of the amendment to ISO 639-3, a has been approved. This has resulted in separate Wikipedia sites for Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

====Monophthongs====
Eastern Armenian has six monophthong vowel sounds.

===Consonants===
This is the Eastern Armenian Consonantal System using symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), followed by the corresponding Armenian letter in parentheses.
*Some of the dialects may release the voiceless stops and affricates as ejectives.

Notes

The phonology of Eastern Armenian preserves the Classical Armenian three-way distinction in stops and affricates: one voiced, one voiceless and one aspirated. Compare this to the phonology of the Western Armenian language, which has kept only a two-way distinction: one voiced and one aspirated. (See the &quot;Differences in Phonology from Classical Armenian&quot; in the &quot;Western Armenian language&quot; article for details.)

Some Eastern Armenian words contain voiced stop letters pronounced as voiceless aspirated stops, like Western Armenian. For instance, (king) is , not ; other examples are (), (), (), (), ().

== Orthography ==
The Eastern Armenian language is written using either Traditional Armenian Orthography or Reformed Armenian Orthography. The controversial reformed orthography was developed during the 1920s in Soviet Armenia and is in widespread use today by Eastern Armenian speakers in Armenia and those in the diaspora that are from Armenia. Eastern Armenian speakers in Iran continue to use the traditional orthography. Nevertheless, writings of either form are mutually intelligible, since the difference between the two orthographies is not large.

==Morphology==

===Pronouns===
Armenian has T-V distinction, with , , used informally and capitalized , , as the polite forms.

===Nouns===
Eastern Armenian nouns have seven cases, one more than Western Armenian. They are: nominative (subject), accusative (direct object), genitive (possession), dative (indirect object), ablative (origin), instrumental (means) and locative (position). Of the seven cases, the nominative and accusative, with exceptions, are the same, and the genitive and dative are the same, meaning that nouns have mostly five distinct forms for case. Nouns in Armenian also decline for number (singular and plural), but do not decline for gender (i.e. masculine or feminine).

Declension in Armenian is based on how the genitive is formed. There are several declensions, but two are the most used (genitive in &quot;i&quot;, and genitive in &quot;u&quot;):
Two notes:&lt;br&gt;
First, notice that the Ablative form in Eastern Armenian is , where it is -ê in Western Armenian:

Abl.sg WA &quot;karê&quot;/EA 

Second, notice that in Western Armenian, the plural forms followed the &quot;u&quot;-declension, while in Eastern Armenian the plural forms follow the &quot;i&quot;-declension:

Gen.pl WA &quot;karineru&quot;/EA 

===Articles===
Like some other languages such as English, Armenian has definite and indefinite articles. The indefinite article in Eastern Armenian is , which precedes the noun:

 (&#x27;a book&#x27;, Nom.sg), (&#x27;of a book&#x27;, Gen.sg)

The definite article is a suffix attached to the noun, and is one of two forms, either or , depending on whether the final sound is a vowel or a consonant, and whether a following word begins with a vowel or consonant:

 (&#x27;the man&#x27;, Nom.sg)
&lt;br&gt; (&#x27;the barley&#x27; Nom.sg)
&lt;br&gt;but:
&lt;br&gt; (&#x27;This is the man&#x27;)
&lt;br&gt; (&#x27;This is the barley&#x27;)

===Adjectives===
Adjectives in Armenian do not decline for case or number, and precede the noun:

 (&#x27;the good book&#x27;, Nom.sg)
&lt;br&gt; (&#x27;of the good book&#x27;, Gen.sg)

===Verbs===
Verbs in Armenian are based on two basic series of forms, a &quot;present&quot; form and an &quot;imperfect&quot; form. From this, all other tenses and moods are formed with various particles and constructions. There is a third form, the preterite, which in Armenian is a tense in its own right, and takes no other particles or constructions. (See also Armenian verbs and Eastern Armenian verb table for more detailed information.)

The present tense in Eastern Armenian is based on two conjugations (a, e). In Eastern Armenian, the distinct conjugations in &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot; merged as &quot;e&quot;.
The present tense (as we know it in English) is made by adding the present tense of &quot;linel&quot; after the present participle form of the verb:

 (I am reading the book)
&lt;br&gt; (I love that book)

<doc id="316860" wikidata="Q1435594" url="?curid=316860" title="Folsom State Prison">
<text>Folsom California State Prison is a California State Prison in Folsom, California, United States, approximately northeast of the state capital of Sacramento. It is one of 34 adult institutions operated by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

Opened in 1880, Folsom is the state&#x27;s second-oldest prison, after San Quentin, and the first in the United States to have electricity. Folsom was also one of the first maximum security prisons. It has been the execution site of 93 condemned prisoners.

Musician Johnny Cash put on two live performances at the prison on January 13, 1968. These were recorded and released as a live album titled &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot;. He had written and recorded the song &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; more than a decade earlier.

== Facilities ==
Both FSP and California State Prison, Sacramento (SAC) share the mailing address: Represa, CA 95671. &quot;Represa&quot; (translated as &quot;dam&quot; from the Spanish language) is the name given in 1892 to the State Prison post office because of its proximity to a dam on the American River that was under construction at the time. The dam was replaced in 1955 by the Folsom Dam.

The facility includes five housing units within the secure perimeter, including the original two-tiered structure. Unit 1 is the most populous cellblock in the United States, with a capacity of nearly 1,200 inmates on four five-tiered sections. All cells include a toilet, sink, bunks, and storage space for inmate possessions. Prison facilities also include two dining halls, a large central prison exercise yard, and two smaller exercise yards. The visiting room includes an attached patio as well as space for non-contact visits.

As of April 30, 2020, FSP&#x27;s men&#x27;s facilities were incarcerating people at 130.4% of design capacity, with 2,694 occupants, and FSP&#x27;s women&#x27;s facilities were incarcerating people at 68.5% of design capacity, with 276 occupants.

== History ==

FSP is California&#x27;s second-oldest prison, long known for its harsh conditions in the decades following the California Gold Rush. Although FSP now houses primarily medium security prisoners, it was one of America&#x27;s first maximum security prisons.

Construction of the facility began in 1857 on the site of the Stony Bar mining camp along the American River. The prison officially opened in 1880 with a capacity of 1,800 inmates. They spent most of their time in the dark, behind solid boiler plate doors in stone cells measuring with eye slots. Air holes were drilled into the cell doors in the 1940s, and the cell doors are still in use today.

FSP was the first prison in the world to have electric power, which was provided by the first hydroelectric powerhouse in California.

After the state of California took sole control of the death penalty in 1891, executions were held at Folsom and San Quentin. A total of 93 prisoners were hanged at FSP between December 13, 1895, and December 3, 1937. Subsequent executions were carried out in the gas chamber at San Quentin. Due to an incorrect record, it is often mistaken that there were 92 executions, but there were in fact 93.

The prison&#x27;s first hanging occurred December 13, 1895 when Chen Hane was &quot;hanged by the neck until dead&quot; at 10:00 am. The public was invited to witness the execution. In 1892 Hane was accused of murdering Lee Gong, even though a witness stated they saw Lee Sam shoot Gong; another said they thought Gong had been shot through a window while sitting at a desk.

FSP industries include metal fabrication and a print shop, and the quarry at FSP provided granite for the foundation of the state capitol building and much of the gravel used in the early construction of California&#x27;s roads. California&#x27;s vehicle license plates have been manufactured at FSP since 1947.

In 1968, Johnny Cash played a concert at the prison. Each attending prisoner lived in his own cell and nearly all were in an education program or learning a trade. Most of the attending prisoners who were released did not return to prison after being released.

Laura Sullivan of &quot;National Public Radio&quot; said that the costs of housing prisoners &quot;barely registered&quot; in the state&#x27;s budget. In 2009, Folsom was overcrowded, with 4,427 inmates. Around that year most of its prisoners who were released returned to prison after being released.

== Cemetery ==
Connected to the prison on a hillside above Folsom Dam is the Folsom Prison Burial Ground (or Folsom Prison Cemetery); a burial location for former inmates who died while serving a prison sentence. In 2018, the El Dorado Hills Genealogical Society started the process of researching and trying to determine which unmarked grave stone belonged to whom; the grave stones originally had only numbers and they were updated to have names as well.

== Inmate programs ==
=== California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) ===
California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) program includes administration, a Braille enterprise, a license plate factory where the inmates have been making California license plates since before the 1930s, maintenance, metal fabrication, a printing plant, and a sign shop.

=== Vocational ===
The Vocational Inmate Program referred to as Construction and Technical Education (CTE&#x27;s) include welding, auto mechanics, electronics, electrical works, masonry, building-maintenance, plumbing, carpentry, roofing, Union Ironworkers, Sustainable Ecological Environmental Development (SEEDS), and office services.

=== Academic ===
The Academic Inmate Program includes Adult Basic Education, High School/GED, English as a Second Language, a literacy program, and computer assisted instruction.

== Folsom Women&#x27;s Facility==
In January 2013 the Folsom Women&#x27;s Facility, a standalone section for women, opened. The northernmost women&#x27;s prison in the CDCR, the facility had space for 403 women. As of 2013, 25% of the women were Hispanic. The prison housed low-risk prisoners. Folsom’s Women Facility was closed during the Coronavirus pandemic. The incarcerated women were either sent to other institutions within the state, out of state, or simply released. 

== Escape attempts ==
Folsom was one of the first maximum-security prisons in the United States. Prior to the completion of its granite wall in the 1920s, the prison saw numerous escape attempts; the first occurred shortly after the first inmates arrived in the 1880s. Throughout Folsom&#x27;s violent and bloody history, numerous riots and escape attempts have resulted in both inmate and staff deaths.

=== 1920 prison train attempt ===
In 1920, three convicts hijacked a prison train that was used to move materials and smashed it through a prison gate to escape.

=== 1927 Thanksgiving Day attempt ===
On Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1927, an attempted prison break resulted in a violent altercation, killing fourteen including an unarmed prison guard and inmate George Baker. Convicted burglar Roy “the Rat” Stokes was charged with first degree murder, and hanged on January 3, 1930. Both Stokes and Baker are buried in the Folsom Prison Cemetery.

=== 1932 dummy used in escape ===
On June 16, Matthew Harris, a Los Angeles robber, escaped from Folsom by making a lifelike dummy. The dummy was cleverly made to look real enough with Abbott&#x27;s own hair, that of his cellmate, and a plaster of Paris face, to fool the guards until late the next day. This, according to the Warden, was seen in his bed and deceived the guards until general lock-up.

=== 1932 diving suit attempt ===
An inmate, Carl Reese, tried to escape in 1932 using a diving suit fashioned from a football bladder, a goggle lens, and other scrounged materials. According to Floyd Davis, a prison guard of 13 years who continued to volunteer at the museum after his retirement, the inmate made only one mistake: he did not make his breathing tube long enough and ended up drowning in the power-house-mill pond. Guards had to drain the pond to recover the inmate&#x27;s body.

=== September 19, 1937 ===

Approximately 40 inmates had been waiting to talk to Warden Clarence Larkin concerning upcoming parole hearings when seven of the inmates suddenly attacked him. As they took him into the yard, other guards started firing. In the commotion that followed, Officer Harry Martin and Warden Larkin were both stabbed to death. Officer Martin died at the scene, and Warden Larkin died of his wounds five days later.

The inmates involved in the attack were said to have attacked the Warden and the officer with shivs (prison-made knives). Also, a prison-made wooden imitation semiautomatic pistol was found; it was carved and meant for use in the attack.

One of the seven inmates who attempted to escape was wanted for the murder of Officer James Hill, of the Marlow, Oklahoma Police Department, on April 20, 1931.

Two of the escaping inmates were fatally shot during the incident. The remaining five were all sentenced to death and eventually executed in late 1938. Two suspects, including the one who had murdered Officer Hill, were executed in the gas chamber on December 2. Two others were executed on December 9, and the leader of the group was executed on December 16.

=== June 5, 1987 ===
Inmate Glen Stewart Godwin&#x27;s notable escape earned him a spot on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.

In 1987, Godwin attempted to escape during his incarceration at Deuel Vocational Institute in Tracy, California, and he was moved to the maximum-security Folsom State Prison.

Authorities believe Godwin&#x27;s wife, Shelly Rose Godwin, and his former cellmate in Deuel, Lorenz Karlic, helped to plan his successful escape from Folsom. A hacksaw and other tools had been smuggled into the prison for Godwin. On June 5, 1987, he cut a hole through fence wire and escaped into a storm drain that emptied into the American River. Godwin dropped through a manhole and crawled 750 feet through the pitch black drain. Either Godwin&#x27;s wife or his accomplice Karlic had left a raft that Godwin used to float down the river, following painted arrows on rocks that directed him where to go.

In June 1987, Karlic was arrested in Hesperia, California, and convicted for aiding Godwin&#x27;s escape. In January 1988, Shelly Godwin was classified as a federal fugitive for her role in her husband&#x27;s escape. The FBI captured her in Dallas, Texas, on February 7, 1990.

Godwin was arrested in Mexico in 1991 but escaped again from a prison in Guadalajara in September of that year and remains at large.

=== October 19, 2010 ===
Two minimum-security inmates, Jeffrey William Howard, 43, and Garrett Daniel Summet, 34, escaped from Folsom on October 19, 2010.

Prison spokesman Lt. Anthony Gentile did not elaborate on the circumstances of how the men got away, only saying that the two men fled from the prison&#x27;s Minimum Support Facility, and that the escape was discovered when the two failed to report to their work areas.

Folsom State Prison correctional staff and California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) Office of Correctional Safety agents initiated escapee apprehension efforts. The CDCR, local law enforcement agencies, and the California Highway Patrol joined the search for the two men, who were apprehended in Inglewood, CA on November 22, 2010.

===October 26, 2017===
Inmate Todd Willis walked away at about 8 A.M. from a minimum-security housing facility at the prison; five days later on October 31, 2017, an off-duty officer was driving through Rancho Cordova when she spotted him. Police were contacted and Willis was quickly apprehended.

== Violent incidents ==
In 1937, Warden Clarence Larkin was stabbed during an escape attempt and died from his wounds.

During the 1970s and 1980s violence at Folsom peaked, when the Mexican Mafia, Black Guerrilla Family and other prison gangs made prisons increasingly dangerous. The establishment of Secure Housing Units, first at California State Prison, Sacramento, and later at Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City, and California State Prison, Corcoran, did much to control gang-related violence.

On August 27, 2010, seven federal inmates at Folsom were admitted to a hospital after corrections officers discharged firearms during a riot involving 200 inmates. None of the inmates&#x27; injuries were life-threatening, and no corrections officers were injured during the incident.

On Wednesday, September 19, 2012, a fight erupted in one of the yards, shortly after 11:00 am. No prison staffers are believed injured and the fight was eventually broken up by the prison guards (using less-than-lethal force), but one inmate was shot and at least ten other inmates had stab or slash wounds, authorities stated (the inmates were treated at area hospitals).

== In popular culture ==

=== Johnny Cash ===
Singer Johnny Cash made FSP widely known to the outside world through his song &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; (1955) – which narrated a fictional account of an outlaw&#x27;s incarceration, and through the two live concerts he performed at FSP. The first was in 1966; the more famous, held on January 13, 1968 in the FSP cafeteria, was recorded as the album &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot;. Cash later said the FSP inmates &quot;were the most enthusiastic audience I ever played.&quot; The &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; single from that album was #1 on the country music chart for four weeks, and the album was on the top 200 pop album chart for 122 weeks. 

A 40th-anniversary tribute concert was to take place in the same cafeteria at FSP on January 13, 2008, with a special appearance by Cash&#x27;s original drummer W. S. &quot;Fluke&quot; Holland. The original plans were to stream the concert over the Internet, with four nonprofit groups underwriting the show and sharing in any proceeds from the show. However, a few days before the concert was to occur, it was canceled in a dispute over filming rights, media access, and security concerns.

=== Los Tigres Del Norte ===
To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Cash&#x27;s groundbreaking concert, the Sinaloa, Mexico norteño band Los Tigres del Norte performed for both male and female inmates at FSP. The performances were filmed as part of a Netflix special, and was released in September 2019.

===Films===
FSP has been the location of a number of feature films, including &quot;The Work&quot;, &quot;Riot in Cell Block 11,&quot; &quot;Convicts 4,&quot; &quot;American Me,&quot; &quot;The Jericho Mile,&quot; &quot;Another 48 Hrs.,&quot; &quot;Diggstown,&quot; parts of &quot;Walk the Line&quot; (a biographical film of Johnny Cash), and &quot;Inside the Walls of Folsom Prison&quot;.

FSP is referenced during the 1995 film &quot;Heat&quot;. It is suggested as being the home of Neil McCauley, the movie&#x27;s main protagonist, for seven years. A majority of the other accompanying crew members are said to have met and spent time in the facility.

===Public works===
On the M-5 freeway in Farmington Hills, MI, two service drives – named Folsom and Freedom – are adjacent to the eastbound and westbound sides respectively.

=== Music ===
Folsom Prison is mentioned in The Offspring&#x27;s 1998 song &quot;Walla Walla.&quot; However, the implied or mistaken location of Folsom is in Walla Walla, Washington, based on the song&#x27;s lyrics.

=== Television ===
The series premiere of the Cartoon Network animated series &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;, appropriately titled &quot;Field Trip to Folsom Prison&quot;, sees the titular characters visiting the prison on a field trip, only for Chicken to end up swapping places with a prisoner named Red. 

Season 2 episode 16 of &quot;The Mentalist&quot; mentions Folsom briefly, with a detective stating to the episode&#x27;s criminal &quot;you&#x27;ll be the richest man in Folsom.&quot;

=== Games ===
New Folsom Prison in &quot;StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty&quot; was named after the facility, or maybe after New Folsom Prison, now California State Prison, Sacramento.
