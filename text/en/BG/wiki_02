<text>House of 1000 Corpses is a 2003 American black comedy horror film written, co-scored, and directed by Rob Zombie in his directorial debut, and the first film in the &quot;Firefly&quot; film series. It stars Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, Sheri Moon, Karen Black, Rainn Wilson, Chris Hardwick, Tom Towles, Erin Daniels, Jennifer Jostyn, Walton Goggins, and Dennis Fimple in his final role. The plot centers on a group of teenagers who are kidnapped and tortured by a psychopathic family during Halloween after traveling across the country to write a book.

Inspired by 1970s horror films such as &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; (1977), Zombie conceived the film while designing a haunted-house attraction for Universal Studios Hollywood, where filming took place in 2000 on the backlots and in Valencia, California. When the studio shelved the film fearing that it would receive an NC-17 rating, Zombie re-acquired the rights. They were eventually sold to Lions Gate Entertainment, who released the film in April 2003. Despite receiving an unfavorable response from critics, it went on to gross $16 million worldwide. Since its release, the film has achieved a cult following, was developed into a haunted-house attraction by Zombie for Universal Studios, and was followed by two sequels: &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot; (2005) and &quot;3 from Hell&quot; (2019).

==Plot==
On October 30, 1977, amateur criminals Killer Karl and Richard Wick attempt an armed robbery at a gas station/horror museum, but are killed by the owner, Captain Spaulding, and his assistant, Ravelli. Later that night, Jerry Goldsmith, Bill Hudley, Mary Knowles, and Denise Willis are on the road in hopes of writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. When the four meet Spaulding, who is also the owner of &quot;The Museum of Monsters &amp; Madmen&quot;, they learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan. As they take off in search of the tree from which Dr. Satan was hanged, they pick up a young free-spirited hitchhiker named Baby, who claims to live only a few miles away. Shortly after, a mysterious figure appears hidden in some overgrowth and shoots out their vehicle&#x27;s tire with a shotgun. The group thinks it is just a blown out tire and so Baby takes Bill to her family&#x27;s house to get a tow truck. Moments later, Baby&#x27;s half-brother, Rufus, picks up the stranded passengers and takes them to the family home.

There, they meet Baby&#x27;s family: her adopted brother Otis Driftwood, her deformed giant half-brother Tiny, Mother Firefly, and Grandpa Hugo. While being treated to dinner, Mother Firefly explains that her ex-husband, Earl, had previously tried to burn Tiny alive, along with the Firefly house after he suffered a psychotic breakdown. After dinner, the family puts on a Halloween show for their guests and Baby offends Mary by flirting with Bill. After Mary threatens Baby, Rufus tells them their car is repaired. As the couples leave, Otis and Tiny, disguised as scarecrows, attack them in the driveway and take them captive. The next day, Otis kills Bill and mutilates his body for art. Mary is tied up in a room and tormented by Otis, Denise is tied to a bed dressed up as a doll for Halloween, and Jerry is partially scalped for failing to guess Baby&#x27;s favorite movie star.

When Denise does not come home, her father Don calls the police to report her missing. Two deputies, George Wydell and Steve Naish, find the couples&#x27; abandoned car in a field with a dead, mutilated cheerleader in the trunk (one of five cheerleaders who went missing over a week ago, as explained in a news broadcast; an earlier scene established that the cheerleaders were being tortured, raped and killed by the Firefly family). Don, a former policeman, is called to the scene to help the deputies search. They arrive at the Firefly house and Wydell questions Mother Firefly about the missing teens. Mother Firefly shoots Wydell in the head and kills him; Don and Steve are then killed by Otis when they find more bodies of missing cheerleaders in the barn, along with a barely conscious Mary.

Later that night, the three remaining teenagers are dressed as rabbits and taken out to an abandoned well. Otis torments Denise using the skin of her dead father&#x27;s face as a mask. Mary attempts to run away, but is tracked down and stabbed to death by Baby moments later. Otis and the family burn the bodies on a pyre.

Meanwhile, Jerry and Denise are placed in a coffin and lowered into a well, where a group of Dr. Satan&#x27;s failed experiments break open the coffin and pull Jerry away, leaving Denise to find her way through an underground lair. As she wanders through tunnels filled with mutilated corpses, she encounters Dr. Satan and a number of mental patients; Jerry is on Dr. Satan&#x27;s operating table being vivisected, and dies as Denise screams. Dr. Satan orders his mutated gargantuan assistant, who turns out to be Mother Firefly&#x27;s ex-husband Earl, to capture Denise, but Denise outwits him and escapes by crawling to the surface as Earl is crushed by falling debris in the collapsing tunnel.

She makes her way to the main road where she encounters Captain Spaulding, who gives her a ride in his car. She passes out from exhaustion in the front seat, and Otis suddenly appears in the back seat with a knife. Denise later wakes up to find herself strapped to an operating table, surrounded by Dr. Satan and Earl, who survived the cave-in. The movie ends with Denise screaming in horror and the words &quot;The End?&quot; displayed before the end credits.

==Production==
===Development===
Rob Zombie rose to fame as frontman of the White Zombie metal band before beginning a solo career. Zombie&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe&quot; (1998), was influenced by classic horror films, as were its music videos for &quot;Dragula&quot; and &quot;Living Dead Girl&quot; (1999). The album was a commercial success, selling over three million copies in the United States. Prior to working on &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;, Zombie had worked on animation for &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot; (1996), directed music videos, and completed a full screenplay for &quot;The Crow: 2037&quot;, but was unsuccessful getting it greenlit with himself as director. In 1999, Zombie designed a haunted maze attraction at Universal Studios that was instrumental in reviving the studio&#x27;s annual Halloween Horror Nights and for which Bill Moseley presented Zombie an award. The studio later began working on an animated &quot;Frankenstein&quot; film which Zombie hoped to be a part of, though plans for the film were ultimately scrapped by the studio.

The idea for &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; came to Zombie while designing a haunted house attraction with that title for the studio, and Universal responded positively to his pitch. Zombie later stated, &quot;I was in the office of the head of production or something and he asked me if I had any movie ideas and I pitched him &quot;Corpses&quot;, which was very rough at the time, because I wasn&#x27;t ready and I made it up on the spot. He liked it, I went home, wrote a 12-page treatment and met up with them. Two months later, we were shooting.&quot; Production on the film began in May 2000 and was finished by Halloween of 2000. The house was launched the following year, although the title was changed to &quot;American Nightmare&quot; due to the film&#x27;s shelving. Despite the name change, the house still featured numerous references to the film, and the theatrical trailer played while customers waited.

The film&#x27;s starting budget was $3–4 million, though its final budget is debatable. Zombie first claimed that the film was made solely with the initial $4 million but later described a budget between $7 million and $14 million. Zombie later admitted that he initially knew he did not have the funding for a good ending but gambled that if he shot what he could on what remained of his budget, the studio would kick in more funds to make a better ending. &quot;I knew the ending sucked, so I let it suck and they said, &#x27;The movie&#x27;s great but the ending sucks&#x27; and I know. So they gave me more money and we shot a more elaborate ending, bigger sets, the whole razzamatazz.&quot; The original film featured more characters, including a skunk ape, and featured footage of the four teenagers on their road trip. Universal hoped that the film would focus more on the group of kids, but Zombie knew &quot;nobody gives a shit about the kids&quot;. Zombie claimed the film was not initially meant to feature elements of black humor, saying it &quot;turned out a little wackier and campier than I originally intended. But as we were shooting, that&#x27;s the tone that it was turning out to be. Movies sometimes dictate their own course, so I just sort of went with it.&quot;

The film was shot on a 25-day shooting schedule. Two weeks were spent filming on the Universal Studios Hollywood backlots—the house featured in the film is the same house used in &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; (1982), and it can be seen on Universal Studios&#x27; tram tours. Zombie stated that filming on the lot was at times difficult, as the amusement park was often open and ruined takes. The remaining 11 days of the shoot were spent on a ranch in Valencia, California. The scene involving Bill being transformed into &quot;Fishboy&quot; was initially much longer, featuring gory details of the creation of the monster. Zombie stated the scene was created after Universal passed on the film. Scenes featuring Baby masturbating with a skeleton, along with other cutaway scenes, were filmed in Zombie&#x27;s basement after initial filming for the project had concluded. Zombie later cited home recordings from the Manson family as inspiration for the Firefly family&#x27;s &quot;bizarre&quot; rants. Zombie often filmed two versions of scenes, one of them less gory, in an attempt to please Universal.

Jake McKinnon could not see well when dressed as The Professor, and almost hit actress Erin Daniels with a real ax during the film&#x27;s climax. Zombie later said he had simply hoped Daniels would move out of the way in time. When Denise calls her father from a telephone booth, a sign for a missing dog head can be seen hanging in the booth; this was in fact a real item found by Zombie and used for the film. In the early stages of the film, Grandpa Hugo was to have been revealed as the murderous Dr. Satan, who at the time was simply referred to as the mad doctor. The legend of the mad doctor was to be a ploy by the Firefly family to lure victims in, though this idea was later scrapped. This led to Grandpa Hugo receiving much less screen time. The character of Dr. Satan was inspired by a 1950s billboard-sized poster advertising a &quot;live spook show starring a magician called Dr. Satan&quot; that Zombie has in his house.

===Casting===

The film&#x27;s main cast consisted of the murderous Firefly family, the four teenagers and various police officers attempting to find the group, among others. Sid Haig was cast as Captain Spaulding, a man who dresses as a clown and owns a gas station and museum of curiosities. Haig claimed he had to &quot;get in touch with [his] own insanity&quot; for the role. His relation to the Firefly family is not revealed in the film, though he is working with them to some extent; however, the sequel establishes that he is the father of Baby. Bill Moseley starred as Otis B. Driftwood, who was adopted into the Firefly family. Sheri Moon Zombie portrayed Baby Firefly, who became known for her high pitched laugh and sexual nature. Karen Black was cast as Mother Firefly, the protective mother to the family. Matthew McGrory portrayed Tiny Firefly, a tall man who was left deformed after a house fire started by his father. Robert Allen Mukes portrayed Rufus &quot;RJ&quot; Firefly Jr. Dennis Fimple was selected to play Grampa Hugo Firefly. He died following filming, and the finished product was dedicated to him.

The names of members of the Firefly family were taken from the names of Groucho Marx characters. Captain Spaulding was a character in &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; (1930), Otis B. Driftwood was a character in &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1935), Rufus T. Firefly was taken from &quot;Duck Soup&quot; (1933), and lastly Hugo Z. Hackenbush derived from &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1937). Despite only allusions to this being made in &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;, it is more prevalent in the film&#x27;s sequel, with the names becoming integral to the plot. Zombie acknowledged that viewers were meant to &quot;root for&quot; the Firefly family as opposed to the group of teens, though claims it wasn&#x27;t intentional: &quot;Yeah, I wanted the audience to cheer &#x27;em. I didn&#x27;t consciously think of it at the time, because I was trying to make Bill and Jerry likeable. But it&#x27;s like when you saw &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and you could tell all Tim Burton cared about was Beetlejuice.&quot;

Erin Daniels portrayed Denise Willis. Chris Hardwick was cast as Jerry Goldsmith, a young man who was seen as &quot;hyper&quot; and &quot;wise-cracking&quot;. The character Bill Hudley was portrayed by Rainn Wilson. &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; served as one of Wilson&#x27;s first films, though he found mainstream success following the film&#x27;s release. Mary Knowles, Bill&#x27;s girlfriend, was played by Jennifer Jostyn. Mary was seen as the most confrontational of the group, often clashing with Baby due to her flirtatious relationship with Bill. Harrison Young was selected to play Don Willis, the father of Denise who later goes looking for her and her group of friends. Tom Towles and Walton Goggins portrayed Lieutenant George Wydell and Deputy Steve Naish, respectively; the pair work with Don to find the missing group.

Irwin Keyes was cast as Ravelli, the assistant to Captain Spaulding who helps run the tourist attraction. Michael J. Pollard portrayed Stucky, a friend of Captain Spaulding and Ravelli&#x27;s. Chad Bannon and David Reynolds played Killer Karl and Richard &quot;Little Dick&quot; Wick, two men who try to rob Captain Spaulding&#x27;s shop and are murdered. William H. Basset had a small role in the film as Sheriff Frank Huston. Joe Dobbs III played Gerry Ober, a man who works at the liquor store; he is later given the nickname &quot;Goober&quot; by Baby. Gregg Gibbs appeared as Dr. Wolfenstein during the &quot;murder ride&quot;. Zombie made a cameo appearance as Dr. Wolfenstein&#x27;s assistant. Despite initially planning to appear as Dr. Wolfenstein, Zombie opted to be his assistant instead, believing he would look &quot;normal&quot; in costume. Walter Phelan was cast as Dr. Satan, whose real name was S. Quintin Quale.

Actress and pin-up model Jeanne Carmen had been cast in &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; as Miss Bunny, a dead animal puppeteer. However, Carmen&#x27;s character was ultimately cut from the film.

===Music===

The score for the film was composed by Zombie, alongside Canadian producer Scott Humphrey. Much of the production work for the soundtrack to the film was done in Humphrey&#x27;s studio, The Chop Shop. The film&#x27;s score featured similar musical themes to Zombie&#x27;s releases, consisting of heavy metal influences. MTV said the music mixed &quot;snippets of ominous hillbilly dialogue with grim horror movie rock&quot;. While making the movie, Zombie joked with his manager that he should do a cover of &quot;Brick House&quot; (1977), originally performed by Commodores. His manager later got both Lionel Richie and rapper Trina to appear on a cover of the song with Zombie, under the title &quot;Brick House 2003&quot;. Aside from making audio clips and snippets for the film, Zombie recorded a variety of new songs for the film&#x27;s soundtrack. The song &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;, taken from Zombie&#x27;s album &quot;The Sinister Urge&quot; (2001), is also present. The soundtrack, released on March 25, 2003, made an appearance on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the United States. The soundtrack to the film is isolated on home video releases of the film as a separate audio track. Later in 2019, Rob Zombie announced that the soundtrack would be released on vinyl by the label Waxwork Records. The record included an essay by Zombie and a 12x12&quot; photo booklet of behind the scenes photos.

==Release==
Prior to agreeing to release the film through Universal, Zombie reportedly told the studio of the film&#x27;s nature, stating &quot;I was really blatant when I talked to them. I didn&#x27;t want to get into a situation where they thought I was making something mainstream. And I told them that I wanted to make a drive-in movie, something very gritty and nasty and weird.&quot; Production of the film was completed in 2000, and was set for release through Universal. The studio completed a theatrical trailer for the film, which was shown in theaters and prior to the Universal ride created by Zombie. Zombie later received a call for a meeting with Stacey Snider, head of Universal. Zombie recalled fearing that the studio would demand a re-shoot, though he later learned that Snider&#x27;s fears of the film receiving an NC-17 rating had led to the company&#x27;s refusal to release the film. The film remained shelved for several months, with Zombie eventually purchasing the rights to the film from Universal. Zombie claimed that many urged him to scrap the film following the fallout with Universal, though he continued to search for a new distributor.

Zombie later made a deal with MGM to release the film, with MGM slating an October 2002 release for the film. MGM later refused to release the film following a controversial remark from Zombie claiming that the company had no morals for releasing the film. Zombie later announced plans to release the film himself, without the backing of a production company. Despite this, Zombie eventually caught the eye of Lions Gate Entertainment, the final studio to sign on for the project. Lions Gate, attempting to venture into new types of films, hoped releasing a horror film would provide more opportunities. The film was cut and edited in an attempt to achieve an R-rating, with Zombie claiming that most of the cut footage featured Sherri Moon Zombie&#x27;s character.

The first public screening of the film occurred in Argentina on March 13, 2003. The version screened at the Mar del Plata International Film Festival was 105 minutes long. &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; then received its theatrical release on April 11, 2003. The film made its debut in the United Kingdom at Fright Fest, and was the fastest selling event of the night. &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; grossed $3,460,666 on a limited opening weekend, while boasting $2,522,026 on its official opening. The film opened in second at the box office, behind the comedy film &quot;Anger Management&quot; (2003). It went on to gross $12,634,962 in the United States alone, with an additional $4,194,583 accumulated worldwide. The film&#x27;s reported gross is $16,829,545. According to Zombie, Lions Gate Entertainment made back their investment on the film on the first day, and shortly afterwards approached Zombie about a sequel to the film. Having already begun developing ideas for a sequel, Zombie quickly began work on a follow-up.

===Critical response===

&quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; received a generally negative critical reception upon its release. Frank Scheck of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that the film &quot;lives up to the spirit but not the quality of its inspirations&quot; and is ultimately a &quot;cheesy and ultragory exploitation horror flick&quot; and &quot;strangely devoid of thrills, shocks or horror&quot;. Clint Morris of &quot;Film Threat&quot; slammed the film as &quot;an hour and a half of undecipherable plot&quot; and found the film to be &quot;sickening&quot; overall. James Brundage of Filmcritic.com wrote that the film was simply &quot;hick after hick, cheap scary image after cheap scary image, lots of southern accents and psychotic murders&quot;, and was &quot;too highbrow to be a good cheap horror movie, too lowbrow to be satire, and too boring to bear the value of the ticket&quot;. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave the film two out of four stars, stating, &quot;If not for the blink-and-miss sideshow attractions and stockpile of memorable quotes, [&quot;House of&quot;] &quot;1000 Corpses&quot; would have been easier to shrug off. This vintage curio is proudly and humorously derivative but that familiar aftertaste is that of wasted opportunities.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; also had a negative review of the film, writing, &quot;As much as film buffs might enjoy recognizing references to &quot;Motel Hell&quot; and other drive-in classics, Mr. Zombie&#x27;s encyclopedic approach to the genre results in a crowded, frenzied film in which no single idea is developed to a satisfying payoff.&quot; The review also criticized the cutaway scenes and home footage used throughout the film, adding, &quot;Mr. Zombie is both too much of a stylist, always cutting away to oddball inserts, black-and-white flashbacks, negative images and much else, and too little: he is not in enough control of his means to let a mood grow and fester. And festering is what this kind of film is all about.&quot;

&quot;JoBlo.com&quot; had a more positive view of the film, claiming it &quot;slaps together just the right amount of creepy atmosphere, nervous laughter, cheap scares, fun rides and blood and guts to satisfy any major fan of the macabre&quot;. Horror Express gave the film a generally positive review, claiming, &quot;He has succeeded for the most part, but really this is only a film Rob Zombie could do. Beyond the harkening back to the old days, there are instances where Zombie&#x27;s signature style comes through. It&#x27;s a style he has honed over the years through his videos, animations and music. Grotesque imagery is shown through skewed camera angles as grinning faces watch on. A use of bright fluorescents almost creates a deceptive atmosphere of childlike innocence as the devils perfect their craft on screen.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a C+, saying, &quot;&quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; &quot;isn&#x27;t coherent, exactly, but what dripping-ghoul horror movie is these days? The new rule is, It&#x27;s not hip to make sense when you&#x27;re raising hell.&quot; Maitland McDonagh of &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film two out of four stars, stating, &quot;It is ugly—in the distinctively washed out, grainy, slightly burned manner of low-budget &#x27;70s films—gory and single-mindedly mean, none of which is a criticism since that&#x27;s exactly what it wants to be.&quot; The project was well received by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, who wrote, &quot;Let&#x27;s give the devil his due. Zombie, who displays a natural flair for the cinematic, has a real appreciation and knowledge of horror pictures and a Diane Arbus-like affinity for sleazy, bizarre Americana and schlock culture. Throughout his fast-moving movie he inserts vintage clips in a witty, telling manner, and as to be expected, Zombie, with Scott Humphries, has come through with a rip-roaring score for his picture.&quot;

The film has a 22% &quot;rotten&quot; rating on film review website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 87 reviews, with a weighted average of 3.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;There&#x27;s an abundance of gore in this derivative horror movie, but little sense or wit.&quot; It has a Metacritic score of 31 based on 15 critics, signifying &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Since its initial release, the film has gone on to gain a cult following. In his 2007 review of the Blu-ray release, Christopher Monfette of IGN called the film &quot;fun as hell&quot;, writing, &quot;&quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; is a messy film—veering this way and that across the genre map with no discernible destination. But viewed less a movie and more as an experience, the film offers a certain degree of inspired insanity and a healthy dose of carnival-like madness&quot;. Zombie has acknowledged the film&#x27;s cult status, stating, &quot;Now, a decade later, it&#x27;s become a pretty loved movie among people. It&#x27;s great that we have this big celebration. I love seeing Sid Haig and the other actors get such great attention from it. The funny thing is, ten years becomes a long time. I&#x27;ll meet someone who&#x27;s eighteen years old, and that&#x27;s always been a film that they&#x27;ve loved. It&#x27;s funny that the film&#x27;s been around that long to be like that for some people.&quot; CinemaBlend also wrote of the film&#x27;s cult status, stating, &quot;While his &quot;Halloween&quot; films were a mess, Zombie did bring something new with his original films &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot;, developing a cult following for his movies on top of the one he earned for his music. Say what you will about him as a director, but there&#x27;s no denying that he has a unique vision.&quot; Zombie has gone on to dismiss the film following its release, saying, &quot;The first film [I directed], which people seems to love, is just a calamitous mess. Well, when it came out it seemed like everyone hated it. Now everyone acts like it&#x27;s beloved in some way. All I see is flaw, upon flaw, upon flaw ... upon flaw.&quot; The success of the film led to two sequels, released in 2005 and 2019 respectively, and later a seasonal haunted house attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood.

===Home media=== 
The film was released on VHS and DVD on August 12, 2003. For the main menu of the film, Zombie had Sid Haig perform in character as an added bonus. The Blu-ray edition of the film was released on September 18, 2007. The Blu-ray edition of the film features the added menu content with Haig, as well as the bonus features found on its initial release. The film was released alongside &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot; (2005) in a combo-pack on January 4, 2011. Zombie spoke in 2003 of releasing a &quot;super-duper deluxe&quot; edition of the film on DVD, which he hoped would include the footage of the scrapped characters, as well as deleted footage from the film&#x27;s death scenes; Zombie also claimed the &quot;fishboy&quot; scene was initially much gorier, and he hoped to include added footage for that scene. Years later, Zombie elaborated on the subject, stating:

<text>The ocean sunfish (Mola mola), also known as the common mola, is one of the largest bony fish in the world. It is the type species of the genus &quot;Mola&quot;, and one of five extant species in the family Molidae. It was once misidentified as the heaviest bony fish, which was actually a different and closely related species of sunfish, &quot;Mola alexandrini&quot;. Adults typically weigh between . It is native to tropical and temperate waters around the world. It resembles a fish head without a tail, and its main body is flattened laterally. Sunfish can be as tall as they are long when their dorsal and ventral fins are extended.

Many areas of sunfish biology remain poorly understood, and various research efforts are underway, including aerial surveys of populations, satellite surveillance using pop-off satellite tags, genetic analysis of tissue samples, and collection of amateur sighting data.

Adult sunfish are vulnerable to few natural predators, but sea lions, killer whales, and sharks will consume them. Sunfish are considered a delicacy in some parts of the world, including Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. In the European Union, regulations ban the sale of fish and fishery products derived from the family Molidae. Sunfish are frequently caught in gillnets.

== Naming ==
Its common English name, sunfish, refers to the animal&#x27;s habit of sunbathing at the surface of the sea. Its common names in Dutch, Portuguese, French, Spanish, Catalan, Italian, Russian, Greek, Hungarian, Norwegian, and German (&quot;maanvis&quot;, &quot;peixe lua&quot;, &quot;Poisson lune&quot;, &quot;pez luna&quot;, &quot;peix lluna&quot;, &quot;Pesce luna&quot;, &quot;рыба-луна&quot;, &quot;φεγγαρόψαρο&quot;, &quot;holdhal&quot;, &quot;månefisk&quot; and &quot;Mondfisch&quot;, respectively) mean &quot;moon fish&quot;, in reference to its rounded shape. In German, the fish is also known as &quot;Schwimmender Kopf&quot;, or &quot;swimming head&quot;. In Polish, it is named &quot;samogłów&quot;, meaning &quot;head alone&quot; or &quot;only head&quot;, because it has no true tail. In Swedish and Danish it is known as &quot;klumpfisk&quot;, in Dutch &quot;klompvis&quot;, in Finnish &quot;möhkäkala&quot;, all of which mean &quot;lump fish&quot;. The Chinese translation of its academic name is , meaning &quot;toppled wheel fish&quot;. Many of the sunfish&#x27;s various names allude to its flattened shape.

=== Taxonomy ===
French polymath Guillaume Rondelet wrote about the ocean sunfish in his 1554 work &quot;de Piscibus&quot;, using the term &quot;Orthagoriscus&quot;, &quot;sucking pig&quot; for the likeness of its body and mouth. It was originally classified in the pufferfish family as &quot;Tetraodon mola&quot;, its epithet &quot;mola&quot; is Latin for &quot;millstone&quot;, which the fish resembles because of its gray color, rough texture, and rounded body. It is now placed in its own genus &quot;Mola&quot; and family name Molidae as the type species with two other species: &quot;Mola tecta&quot; and &quot;M. alexandrini&quot; (previously known as &quot;Mola ramsayi&quot;). Extinct relatives of &quot;Mola mola&quot; lived in the Oligocene and Miocene epochs. However, the earliest known fossil remains of &quot;Mola mola&quot; itself were found in archaeological middens dating to the Holocene epoch.

The common name &quot;sunfish&quot; without qualifier is used to describe the marine family Molidae and the freshwater sunfish in the family Centrarchidae, which is unrelated to Molidae. On the other hand, the name &quot;ocean sunfish&quot; and &quot;mola&quot; refer only to the family Molidae.

== Description ==

It shares many traits common to members in the order Tetraodontiformes including pufferfish, porcupinefish, and filefish like having a beak formed from four fused teeth; sunfish fry resemble spiky pufferfish more than they resemble adult molas.

The caudal fin of the ocean sunfish is replaced by a rounded clavus, creating the body&#x27;s distinct truncated shape. The body is flattened laterally, giving it a long oval shape when seen head-on. The pectoral fins are small and fan-shaped, while the dorsal fin and the anal fin are lengthened, often making the fish as tall as it is long. Specimens up to in height have been recorded.

The mature ocean sunfish has an average length of and a fin-to-fin length of . The weight of mature specimens can range from , but even larger individuals are not unheard of. The maximum size recorded is in length, and maximum weight recorded is .

The spinal column of &quot;M. mola&quot; contains fewer vertebrae and is shorter in relation to the body than that of any other fish.
Although the sunfish descended from bony ancestors, its skeleton contains largely cartilaginous tissues, which are lighter than bone, allowing it to grow to sizes impractical for other bony fishes. Its teeth are fused into a beak-like structure, which prevents them from being able to fully close their mouths, while also having pharyngeal teeth located in the throat.

The axial musculature is completely lost during development. In addition they are missing a swim bladder. Instead they get their buoyancy from a stiff and gelatinous layer under the skin, which consist of about 90% water and a meshwork of collagen and elastin, acting like an exoskeleton. Due to its greasy texture, it may also contain lipids. The layer, which is horizontally separated by a septum, makes up a larger part of the animal&#x27;s total mass the bigger the individual is. Some sources indicate the internal organs contain a concentrated neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin, like the organs of other poisonous tetraodontiformes, while others dispute this claim.

===Fins===
In the course of its evolution, the caudal fin (tail) of the sunfish disappeared, to be replaced by a lumpy pseudotail, the clavus. This structure is formed by the convergence of the dorsal and anal fins, and is used by the fish as a rudder. The smooth-denticled clavus retains 11–14 fin rays and terminates in a number of rounded ossicles.

Ocean sunfish often swim near the surface, and their protruding dorsal fins are sometimes mistaken for those of sharks. However, the two can be distinguished by the motion of the fin. Unlike most fish, the sunfish swings its dorsal fin and anal fin in a characteristic sculling motion.

===Skin===
Adult sunfish range from brown to silvery-grey or white, with a variety of region-specific mottled skin patterns. Coloration is often darker on the dorsal surface, fading to a lighter shade ventrally as a form of countershading camouflage. &quot;M. mola&quot; also exhibits the ability to vary skin coloration from light to dark, especially when under attack. The skin, which contains large amounts of reticulated collagen, can be up to thick on the ventral surface, and is covered by denticles and a layer of mucus instead of scales. The skin on the clavus is smoother than that on the body, where it can be as rough as sandpaper.

More than 40 species of parasites may reside on the skin and internally, motivating the fish to seek relief in a number of ways. One of the most frequent ocean sunfish parasites is the flatworm &quot;Accacoelium contortum&quot;.

In temperate regions, drifting kelp fields harbor cleaner wrasses and other fish which remove parasites from the skin of visiting sunfish. In the tropics, &quot;M. mola&quot; solicits cleaning help from reef fishes. By basking on its side at the surface, the sunfish also allows seabirds to feed on parasites from its skin. Sunfish have been reported to breach, clearing the surface by approximately , in an apparent effort to dislodge embedded parasites.

==Distribution and habitat==

Ocean sunfish are native to the temperate and tropical waters of every ocean in the world. &quot;Mola&quot; genotypes appear to vary widely between the Atlantic and Pacific, but genetic differences between individuals in the Northern and Southern hemispheres are minimal.

Although early research suggested sunfish moved around mainly by drifting with ocean currents (which has resulted in the sunfish sometimes being characterized as a megaplankton), individuals have been recorded swimming in a day at a cruising speed of .
They are also capable of moving rapidly when feeding or avoiding predators, to the extent that they can vertically leap out of water. Contrary to the perception that the fish spend much of their time basking at the surface, &quot;M. mola&quot; adults actually spend a large portion of their lives actively hunting at depths greater than , occupying both the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones. Sunfish are most often found in water warmer than ; prolonged periods spent in water at temperatures of or lower can lead to disorientation and eventual death. Surface basking behavior, in which a sunfish swims on its side, presenting its largest profile to the sun, may be a method of &quot;thermally recharging&quot; following dives into deeper, colder water in order to feed. Sightings of the fish in colder waters outside of its usual habitat, such as those southwest of England, may be evidence of increasing marine temperatures.

Sunfish are usually found alone, but occasionally in pairs.

==Feeding==
The diet of the ocean sunfish was formerly thought to consist primarily of various jellyfish. However, genetic analysis reveals that sunfish are actually generalist predators that consume mostly small fish, fish larvae, squid, and crustaceans, with jellyfish and salps making up only around 15% of the diet. Occasionally they will ingest eel grass. This range of food items indicates that the sunfish feeds at many levels, from the surface to deep water, and occasionally down to the seafloor in some areas.

==Life cycle==
Ocean sunfish may live up to ten years in captivity, but their lifespan in a natural habitat has not yet been determined. Their growth rate remains undetermined. However, a young specimen at the Monterey Bay Aquarium increased in weight from and reached a height of nearly in 15 months.

The sheer size and thick skin of an adult of the species deters many smaller predators, but younger fish are vulnerable to predation by bluefin tuna and mahi mahi. Adults are consumed by orca, sharks and sea lions.

The mating practices of the ocean sunfish are poorly understood, but spawning areas have been suggested in the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian oceans. Females of the species can produce more eggs than any other known vertebrate, up to 300 million at a time. Sunfish eggs are released into the water and externally fertilized by sperm. 

Newly hatched sunfish larvae are only long and weigh less than one gram. They develop into fry that resemble miniature pufferfish, their close relatives. Sunfish fry do not have the large pectoral fins and tail fin of their adult forms, but they have body spines uncharacteristic of adult sunfish, that disappear as they grow. Young sunfish school for protection, but this behavior is abandoned as they grow. The fry that survive can grow up to 60 million times their original weight before reaching adult proportions, arguably the most extreme size growth of any vertebrate animal.

==Genome==
In 2016, researchers from China National Genebank and A*STAR Singapore, including Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner, sequenced the genome of the ocean sunfish and discovered several genes which might explain its fast growth rate and large body size. As member of the order Tetraodontiformes, like fugu, the sunfish has quite a compact genome, at 730 Mb in size. Analysis from this data suggests that sunfish and pufferfishes diverged approximately 68 million years ago, which corroborates the results of other recent studies based on smaller datasets.

==Human interaction==

Despite their size, ocean sunfish are docile and pose no threat to human divers. Injuries from sunfish are rare, although a slight danger exists from large sunfish leaping out of the water onto boats. In 2005, a -long sunfish landed on a 4-year-old boy when the fish leaped onto the boy&#x27;s family&#x27;s boat off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. Areas where they are commonly found are popular destinations for sport dives, and sunfish at some locations have reportedly become familiar with divers. They are more of a problem to boaters than to swimmers, as they can pose a hazard to watercraft due to their large size and weight. Collisions with sunfish are common in some parts of the world and can cause damage to the hull of a boat, or to the propellers of larger ships, as well as to the fish.

The flesh of the ocean sunfish is considered a delicacy in some regions, the largest markets being Taiwan and Japan. All parts of the sunfish are used in cuisine, from the fins to the internal organs.
Some parts are used in some areas of traditional medicine. Fishery products derived from sunfish are forbidden in the European Union according to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council, as they contain toxins that are harmful to human health.

Sunfish are accidentally but frequently caught in drift gillnet fisheries, making up nearly 30% of the total catch of the swordfish fishery employing drift gillnets in California. The bycatch rate is even higher for the Mediterranean swordfish industry, with 71% to 90% of the total catch being sunfish.

A decrease in sunfish populations may be caused by more frequent bycatch and the increasing popularity of sunfish in human diet. The fishery bycatch and destruction of ocean sunfish are unregulated worldwide. In some areas, the fish are &quot;finned&quot; by fishermen who regard them as worthless bait thieves; this process, in which the fins are cut off, results in the eventual death of the fish, because it can no longer propel itself without its dorsal and anal fins.
The species is also threatened by floating litter such as plastic bags which resemble jellyfish, a common prey item. Bags can choke and suffocate a fish or fill its stomach to the extent that it starves.

=== In art ===
Patterns of this fish, known as &quot;kebuku&quot;, are seen in sarongs worn by women in Lamalera, a village in the island of Lembata, in the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia.

=== In captivity ===
Sunfish are not widely held in aquarium exhibits, due to the unique and demanding requirements of their care. Some Asian aquaria display them, particularly in Japan. The Kaiyukan Aquarium in Osaka is one of few aquaria with &quot;Mola mola&quot; on display, where it is reportedly as popular an attraction as the larger whale sharks.
The Lisbon Oceanarium in Portugal has ocean sunfish showcased in the main tank, and sunfish are also on display at the Denmark Nordsøen Oceanarium.

In Kamogawa Sea World the ocean sunfish named Kukey, who started captivity in 1982, set a world record for captivity for 2,993 days, living for eight years. Kukey was at the time of delivery, but was in size at the time of death.

While the first ocean sunfish to be held in an aquarium in the United States is said to have arrived at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in August 1986, other specimens have previously been held at other locations. Marineland of the Pacific, closed since 1987 and located on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles County, California, held at least one ocean sunfish by 1961, and in 1964 held a specimen, said to be the largest ever captured at that time. However, another specimen was brought alive to Marineland Studios Aquarium, near St. Augustine, Florida, in 1941.

Because sunfish had not been kept in captivity on a large scale before, the staff at Monterey Bay was forced to innovate and create their own methods for capture, feeding, and parasite control. By 1998, these issues were overcome, and the aquarium was able to hold a specimen for more than a year, later releasing it after its weight increased by more than 14 times. &quot;Mola mola&quot; has since become a permanent feature of the Open Sea exhibit. Monterey Bay Aquarium&#x27;s largest sunfish specimen was euthanized on February 14, 2008, after an extended period of poor health.

A major concern to curators is preventive measures taken to keep specimens in captivity from injuring themselves by rubbing against the walls of a tank, since ocean sunfish cannot easily maneuver their bodies. In a smaller tank, hanging a vinyl curtain has been used as a stopgap measure to convert a cuboid tank to a rounded shape and prevent the fish from scraping against the sides. A more effective solution is simply to provide enough room for the sunfish to swim in wide circles. The tank must also be sufficiently deep to accommodate the vertical height of the sunfish, which may reach .

Feeding captive sunfish in a tank with faster-moving, more aggressive fish can also present a challenge. Eventually, the fish can be taught to respond to a floating target to be fed, and to take food from the end of a pole or from human hands.

<doc id="307798" wikidata="Q160619" url="?curid=307798" title="Roger Garaudy">
<text>Roger Garaudy (; 17 July 1913 – 13 June 2012) was a French philosopher, French resistance fighter and a communist author. He converted to Islam in 1982. In 1998, he was convicted for several years and fined for Holocaust denial under French law for claiming that the death of six million Jews was a &quot;myth&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Roger Garaudy was born in Marseille to working class Catholic parents. At the age of 14, Garaudy converted to Protestantism. He fought during World War II and received the Croix de Guerre. After a period as a Vichy France prisoner of war in Algeria, Garaudy joined the French Resistance working for resistance radio and the newspaper &quot;Liberté&quot;.

==Political career==
Garaudy joined the French Communist Party in 1933. By mid 1940s, Garaudy was considered a leading polemicist within the party. He rose through the ranks and in 1945 he became a member of the party&#x27;s leadership and its Central Executive Committee, where he occupied positions for 28 years.

Garaudy remained a Christian and eventually re-converted to Catholicism during his political career. Eventually he converted to Islam. He was befriended by one of France&#x27;s most prominent clerics of the time, the Abbé Pierre, who in later years supported Garaudy, even regarding the latter&#x27;s most controversial views.

Garaudy was expelled from the Communist Party in 1970, because he had criticized the party&#x27;s position on the student movement and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. His philosophical and political views were characterized as revisionist by Soviet commentators. He had, however, accepted the invasion of Hungary in 1956.

==Academic career==
He obtained a state doctorate in philosophy in 1953, with a dissertation discussing theory of knowledge and materialism, entitled &quot;La théorie matérialiste de la connaissance&quot;. In May 1954, Garaudy defended another doctoral thesis, &quot;The Problem of Freedom and Necessity in the Light of Marxism&quot;, at the Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences.

Garaudy lectured in the faculty of arts department of the University of Clermont-Ferrand from 1962 to 1965. Due to controversies between Garaudy and Michel Foucault, Garaudy left. He later taught in Poitiers from 1969 to 1972.

His main research subject was foundations of revolutionary politics.

==Political and philosophical views==
As of 1940s, Garaudy was critical of Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s view of freedom, maintaining that it lacks any social, economic, political or historical context. He criticized &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; for what he deemed not going beyond the domain of metaphysical pathology, and Sartre&#x27;s novels for &quot;depicting only degenerates and human wrecks&quot; and describing his existentialism as &quot;a sickness&quot;.

Garaudy&#x27;s faith in communism was shaken in 1956, after Nikita Khrushchev made the Secret Speech at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Afterwards, he espoused an eclectic and humanist view on Marxism, strictly opposing the theoretical Marxism of Louis Althusser and advocating dialogue with other schools of thought.

In 1974, Frederic Will described him as sympathetic towards Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Gabriel Marcel. He held that the Western culture was something of a coalition between the idealistic philosophy and the elite class, which is devoted to turning man away from the material world. The goal of socialism in his view was not simply economic or providing social justice, but also giving each individual their personal chances for creativity.

===Conversion to Islam===
Around 1980, Garaudy read &quot;The Green Book&quot; by Muammar Gaddafi and became interested in Libya and Islam, meeting the country&#x27;s leader on several occasions in the desert. He converted formally at the Islamic Centre in Geneva, an organisation managed by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at the time.

In &quot;The Case of Israel: A Study of Political Zionism&quot; (1983), Garaudy portrays Zionism as an isolationist and segregationist ideology that not only depends on antisemitism to nourish it, but also willfully encourages it to achieve its goals.

==Holocaust denial==
=== Conviction of violating Gayssot Act ===

In 1996, Garaudy published, with his editor Pierre Guillaume, the work &quot;Les Mythes fondateurs de la politique israelienne&quot; (literally, &quot;The Founding Myths of Israeli Politics&quot;), later translated into English as &quot;The Founding Myths of Modern Israel&quot;. In the book he wrote of &quot;the myth of the six million&quot; Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Because of this breach of French law concerning Holocaust denial, the courts banned any further publication and on 27 February 1998 fined Garaudy 120,000 French francs. He was sentenced to a suspended jail sentence of several years.

===&quot;Garaudy v. France&quot;===
Garaudy appealed this decision to the European Court of Human Rights, stating that his book was a political work criticizing the policies of Israel that did not deny that the Nazis had committed crimes against humanity, and that his freedom of expression was interfered by the French courts. At his hearing, Garaudy stated that his book in no way condoned National Socialist methods, and that book was an attack on the mythologizing and use of &quot;the holocaust&quot; by Israeli government as policy. He argued that his book dealt with the Israeli government&#x27;s use of &quot;the holocaust&quot; as a &quot;justifying dogma&quot; for its actions, mainly in Palestine and toward Palestinians.

His appeal was rejected as inadmissible. The ECHR ruled that Garaudy has denied historical facts in his book which is not a research work. It also argued that the interference pursued two of the legitimate aims included in Gayssot Act articles and is not a violation of Garaudy&#x27;s right for free speech. The ECHR did not use this rationale in &quot;Perinçek v. Switzerland&quot;.

===Iranian support===
In Iran, 160 members of the parliament and 600 journalists signed a petition in Garaudy&#x27;s support. On 20 April 1998, Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei met Garaudy. Khamenei was critical of the West which, he said, condemned &quot;the racist behavior of the Nazis&quot; while accepting the Zionists’ &quot;Nazi-like behavior.&quot; Iranian president, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, insisted in a sermon delivered on Iranian radio that Hitler &quot;only killed 20,000 Jews and not six million&quot; and that &quot;Garaudy&#x27;s crime derives from the doubt he cast on Zionist propaganda.&quot; Iranian President, Mohammad Khatami, described Garaudy in 1998 as &quot;a thinker&quot; and &quot;a believer&quot; who was brought to trial merely for publishing research which was &quot;displeasing to the West.&quot;

In December 2006, Garaudy was unable to attend the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust in Tehran, Iran owing to ill health. He reportedly sent a videotaped message supporting Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s view that Israel should cease to exist.

==Death and legacy==
Roger Garaudy died in Chennevières-sur-Marne, Val-de-Marne, on Wednesday 13 June 2012, aged 98.

According to Azzam Tamimi, Tunisian thinker Rached Ghannouchi was inspired by Garaudy in the early 1980s, after he read a translation of his book on women. He subsequently authored a treatise on women rights and on the status of women in the Islamic movement, partly influenced by Garaudy&#x27;s work.

<text>Pashupati (, ) is a form of the Hindu deity Shiva, in his benign aspect as the five-faced herdsman of all creatures. Pashupati is traditionally considered to be the guardian deity of Nepal, described in texts such as the &quot;Nepala Mahatmya&quot;, found in regional versions of the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Paśupati&quot; means &quot;lord of the animals&quot;. &quot;Paśu&quot; indicates animal as well as a follower of Shiva. It was an epithet of Rudra in the Vedic period and is one of the epithets of Shiva.

==History==

The earliest claimed evidence of Pashupati comes from the Indus Valley civilization (3300 BCE to 1300 BCE), where the Pashupati seal has been said to represent a proto-Shiva figure.

== Literature ==

=== Vedas ===
Pashupati was generally applied as an epithet of Rudra in the &quot;Samhitas&quot; and the &quot;Brahmanas&quot;. In the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;, Rudra is described to be the lord of the bipeds and the quadrupeds, including creatures that inhabited the earth, woods, the waters, and the skies. His lordship over cattle and other beasts denoted both a benevolent and destructive role; he slew animals that incurred his wrath, but was also kind to those who propitiated him, blessing them with health and prosperity. 

=== Nepala Mahatmya ===
Markandeya narrates the origin of Pashupati to the sage Jaimini. Accompanied by his consort Parvati, Shiva visited the Śleṣmātaka forest upon the banks of the Bagmati in the form of a deer, while she assumed the form of a doe. Brahma, Vishnu, and Indra, confounded by his absence, scoured the three worlds in search of him. When they finally discovered Shiva in the Himalayas, they were surprised to find him bearing one horn, three eyes, surrounded by his consort and a flock of deer. After they venerated him, they realised that he did not wish to return to his divine form. The deities attempted to subdue Shiva by holding his horn, which broke upon their touch into four parts as he leapt across the riverbanks. When the deities begged Shiva to return to his abode and his place in the universe, he told them that he would reside in the forest for all time in the form of the deer, and would henceforth be known as Pashupati. He stated that the four horns would be consecrated as four &quot;lingams&quot; across the region. He declared that those who worshipped him in this aspect would never be born as animals, and would be blessed with good virtues.

== Iconography ==
The five faces of Pashupati represent the five forms of Shiva: Sadyojata (also known as Varuna), Vamadeva (also known as Uma Maheshvara), Tatpurusha, Aghora, and Ishana. They face the west, north, east, south and zenith respectively, representing the &quot;pancha bhuta&quot; (five basic elements) of the Hindu cosmos, namely earth, water, air, light and ether.

The &quot;Puranas&quot; describe these faces of Shiva as:

==By country==
=== Nepal ===

Although Nepal is a secular state, its population is predominantly Hindu. Pashupatinath is revered as a national deity. The Pashupatinath Temple, located at the bank of the river Bagmati, is considered one of the most sacred places in Nepal. In mythology it is said that Pashupatinath started living in Nepal in the form of a deer because he was enchanted by the beauty of Kathmandu Valley.

=== India ===
A Pashupatinath temple is sited on the banks of the Shivana river in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, India. It is one of the most important shrines of Mandsaur, and Shiva in the form of Pashupati is its primary deity.

==Pashupata Shaivism==

Pashupata Shaivism is one of the oldest Shaivite sects that derives its name from &quot;Pashupati&quot;. The sect upholds Pashupati &quot;as the supreme deity, the lord of all souls, and the cause of all existence&quot;.

<text>Richard Edward Geoffrey Howe, Baron Howe of Aberavon, (20 December 1926 – 9 October 2015), known from 1970 to 1992 as Sir Geoffrey Howe, was a British politician who served as Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1989 to 1990. A member of the Conservative Party, he was Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s longest-serving Cabinet minister, successively holding the posts of chancellor of the Exchequer, foreign secretary, and finally leader of the House of Commons, deputy prime minister and lord president of the Council. His resignation on 1 November 1990 is widely considered to have precipitated the leadership challenge that led to Thatcher&#x27;s resignation three weeks later.

Born in Port Talbot, Wales, Howe was educated at Bridgend Preparatory School, Abberley Hall School, Winchester College, and – after serving in the army as a lieutenant – Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he read law. He was called to the bar in 1952 and practised in Wales, after which he was elected as the Conservative member of Parliament (MP) for Bebington in 1964, but lost his seat in 1966, returning to the bar. Howe became an MP again at the 1970 general election and represented various constituencies in the House of Commons until 1992. In Edward Heath&#x27;s government, he was solicitor general and a minister of state; after Labour&#x27;s victory in 1974, Howe became the shadow chancellor of the Exchequer in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s shadow cabinet.

Howe became Chancellor of the Exchequer upon Thatcher&#x27;s victory in the 1979 general election, with his tenure characterised by a programme of radical policies intended to restore the public finances, reduce inflation and liberalise the economy. As chancellor, Howe delivered five budgets. After the 1983 general election, Howe was appointed foreign secretary, serving six years. In 1989, Thatcher replaced Howe with John Major, giving Howe the role of deputy prime minister. He resigned from the government on 1 November 1990; in his resignation letter, he criticised Thatcher&#x27;s handling of relations with the EEC and further attacked Thatcher in his resignation speech to the Commons on 13 November. The speech was widely seen as the key catalyst for the leadership challenge mounted by Michael Heseltine a few days later, which led to Thatcher&#x27;s resignation and her replacement by Major.

Howe retired as an MP in 1992 and was made a life peer in June of that year. Following his retirement from the Commons, Howe took on several non-executive directorships in business and advisory posts in law and academia. He retired from the House of Lords in May 2015 and died in October of the same year, aged 88.

== Early life and education ==
Howe was born in 1926 at Port Talbot, Wales, to Benjamin Edward Howe, a solicitor and coroner, and Eliza Florence (née Thomson) Howe. He was to describe himself as a quarter Scottish, a quarter Cornish and half Welsh. He had one older sister, Barbara, who died of meningitis just before he was born, and a younger brother, Colin.

He was educated at three private schools: at Bridgend Preparatory School in Bryntirion, followed by Abberley Hall School in Worcestershire and by winning an exhibition to Winchester College in Hampshire. Howe was not sporty, joining the debating society instead. It was during wartime, so he was active in the Home Guard at the school and set up a National Savings group. He was also a keen photographer and film buff. A gifted classicist, Howe was offered an exhibition to Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1945 but first decided to join the army. He did a six-month course in maths and physics. Then he did national service as a lieutenant with the Royal Corps of Signals in East Africa, by his own account giving political lectures in Swahili about how Africans should avoid communism and remain loyal to &quot; Kingy George&quot;; and also climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.

Having declined an offer to remain in the army as a captain, he matriculated at Trinity Hall in 1948, where he read law and was chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association, and on the committee of the Cambridge Union Society. He was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1952 and practised in Wales. On 28 August 1953, Howe married Elspeth Shand, daughter of P. Morton Shand. They had a son and two daughters. At first, his legal practice struggled to pay, surviving thanks to a £1,200 gift from his father and a prudent marriage. He served on the Council of the Bar from 1957 to 1962 and was a council member of the pressure group JUSTICE. A high-earning barrister, he was made a QC in 1965.

Choosing a parallel career in politics, Howe stood as the Conservative Party candidate in his native Aberavon at the 1955 and 1959 general elections, losing in what was a very safe Labour Party seat. He helped to found the Bow Group, an internal Conservative think tank of &quot;young modernisers&quot; in the 1950s; he was one of its first chairmen in 1955–1956 and edited its magazine &quot;Crossbow&quot; from 1960 to 1962. In 1958, he co-authored the report &quot;A Giant&#x27;s Strength&quot; published by the Inns of Court Conservative Association. The report argued that the unions had become too powerful and that their legal privileges should be curtailed. Iain Macleod discouraged the authors from publicising the report.

Harold Macmillan believed that trade union votes had contributed towards the 1951 and 1955 election victories and thought that it &quot;would be inexpedient to adopt any policy involving legislation which would alienate this support&quot;. Through a series of Bow Group publications, Howe advanced free market ideas, primarily inspired by the thinking of Enoch Powell, which was later to be known as Thatcherism.

== Early political career ==

=== Backbencher ===
Howe represented Bebington in the House of Commons from 1964 to 1966 with a much-reduced majority. He became a chairman of the backbench committee on social services, being quickly recognised for promotion to the front bench as HM Opposition spokesman on welfare and labour policy. He was defeated at the 1966 general election.

Howe returned to the bar. He participated in the 1966 Aberfan Disaster Tribunal, representing the colliery managers. He sat as deputy chairman of Glamorgan quarter sessions. More politically significant was working on the Latey Committee, tasked with recommending a reduction in the voting age. In 1969, he chaired the committee of inquiry to investigate alleged abuse at Ely Mental Hospital, Cardiff. On Howe&#x27;s insistence, the inquiry&#x27;s remit was expanded to cover the treatment of patients with intellectual disabilities within the National Health Service. The report greatly impacted mental health provision in the UK, beginning a process that led to the widespread closure of large mental hospitals. But of more legislative importance were the Street Committee on racial discrimination, and Cripps Committee on discrimination against women, the reports of which helped the Labour government to change the law.

He returned to the House of Commons as the MP for Reigate from 1970 to 1974 and East Surrey from 1974 to 1992. In 1970, he was appointed Solicitor General in Edward Heath&#x27;s government and was knighted. He was responsible for the Industrial Relations Act that caused immediate retaliatory union strikes. He was promoted in 1972 to Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Industry, with a seat in the Cabinet and Privy Council membership, a post he held until Labour was returned to government in March 1974.

=== Shadow Cabinet ===
In 1974, the Reigate boundary changes redrew the seat as East Surrey, and Heath appointed him as spokesman for social services. Howe contested the second ballot of the 1975 Conservative leadership election, in which Margaret Thatcher was elected as party leader. She saw him as a like-minded right-winger, and he was appointed Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. He masterminded the development of new economic policies embodied in an Opposition mini-manifesto &quot;The Right Approach to the Economy&quot;.

At the same time, in response to the 1976 sterling crisis, Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey had requested a loan of $3.9 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF); at the time, it was the largest loan request the IMF had ever received. In 1978, Healey said Howe&#x27;s criticism was &quot;like being savaged by a dead sheep&quot;. Nevertheless, when Healey was featured on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1989, Howe appeared and paid warm tribute.

=== Chancellor of the Exchequer ===
With the Conservative victory in the 1979 general election, Howe became Chancellor of the Exchequer. His tenure was characterised by an ambitious programme of radical policies intended to restore the public finances, reduce inflation and liberalise the economy. The shift from direct to indirect taxation, the development of a medium-term financial strategy, the abolition of exchange controls and the creation of tax-free enterprise zones were among the most important decisions of his chancellorship.

The first of five budgets, in 1979, promised to honour Professor Hugh Clegg&#x27;s report that recommended a return to pre-1975 pay levels in real terms, conceding Howe&#x27;s point about &quot;concerted action&quot;. Rampant inflation had, however, eroded competitiveness, and devalued pensions, investments, and wages. Thatcher reminded him: &quot;On your own head be it, Geoffrey, if anything goes wrong,&quot; commencing an often tense and querulous working relationship. Thatcher&#x27;s point was that the vast increase in (indirect) taxation and government spending (notably in public sector pay) in 1979 would lead to terrible consequences – which it did, as unemployment doubled. The financial policy tightened the money supply and restricted public sector pay, ultimately driving up inflation, at least in the short term, and unemployment in the medium term.

During Thatcher&#x27;s first term, the government&#x27;s poll ratings plummeted until the &quot;Falklands Factor&quot;. Howe&#x27;s 1981 Budget defied conventional economic wisdom by slowing the inflation rate during a recession. At the time, his decision was fiercely criticised by 364 academic economists in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, who contended that there was no place for de-stimulatory policies in the economic climate of the time, remarking the budget had &quot;no basis in economic theory or supporting evidence&quot;. Many signatories were prominent members of the academic sphere, including Mervyn King who later became the Governor of the Bank of England.

The logic in his proposals was that by reducing the deficit, which at the time was £9.3 billion (3.6% GDP), and controlling inflation, long-term interest rates would be able to decline, thus re-stimulating the economy. The budget did reduce inflation from 11.9% in early 1981 to 3.8% in February 1983. Long-term interest rates declined from 14% in 1981 to 10% in 1983. The economy slowly climbed out of recession. However, already extremely high unemployment was pushed to a 50-year high of 12% by 1984, narrowly avoiding the figure reached during the Great Depression of 13.5%. Some have argued that the budget, although ultimately successful, was nevertheless over the top. Specialist opinions on the question, expressed with 25 years&#x27; hindsight, are collected in an Institute of Economic Affairs report.

Unlike Reaganomics, his macro-economic policy emphasised the need to narrow the budget deficit rather than engage in unilateral tax cuts – &quot;I never succumbed ... to the mistaken interpretations of Lafferism, which have led some US policymakers so far astray&quot;; despite these measures the budget deficit remained on average 3% of GDP during Howe&#x27;s tenure. His macroeconomic policy was designed to liberalise the economy and promote supply-side reform. This combination of policies became one of the defining features of Thatcherism in power. However, by the time of his last budget, shortly before a general election, there were early signs of a recovery, which Howe used to justify a tax cut.

Documents released under the British government&#x27;s 30-year rule in 2011 revealed that in the wake of the Toxteth riots in Liverpool in 1981, Howe had warned Thatcher &quot;not to overcommit scarce resources to Liverpool&quot;, writing that &quot;It would be even more regrettable if some of the brighter ideas for renewing economic activity were to be sown only on relatively stony ground on the banks of the Mersey. I cannot help feeling that the option of managed decline is one which we should not forget altogether. We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill&quot;. Howe later stated that he had not advocated the &quot;managed decline&quot; policy and that he had merely been warning of the danger of concentrating excessive resources on one area of need.

=== Foreign Secretary ===

After the 1983 general election, Thatcher reluctantly appointed Howe Foreign Secretary, a post he held for six years, the longest tenure since Sir Edward Grey in 1905–1916. With &quot;the quiet determination&quot; applied in the Treasury, he set off on a tour of Warsaw Pact countries, interviewing communist leaders and sounding out opponents. The trip opened the way to further discussions with Mikhail Gorbachev, with whom he believed Thatcher shared &quot;extraordinary chemistry.&quot; He later looked back on this period (1983–1985) as his happiest and most fruitful and productive, engaging with world leaders across the summit table, sharing decisions with Thatcher, including a notable encounter with Caspar Weinberger on 6 September 1982. Success with the Americans proved decisive in bringing about the end of Communism in Europe.

Howe was closely involved in the negotiations leading up to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong, and developed a good working relationship with the United States Secretary of State, George Shultz, mirroring the close connection between Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan. However, Howe&#x27;s tenure was made difficult by growing behind-the-scenes tensions with the Prime Minister on a number of issues, first on South Africa, next on Britain&#x27;s relations with the European Community, and then in 1985 the Anglo-Irish Agreement. For his staff, Howe was a respected boss; mild-mannered, polite and courteous, he was assiduous in his attention to detail. However, the human rights questions over South African sanctions and trade embargo, coupled with his deep concern over Thatcher&#x27;s strident style in Europe, increasingly drove a stressful wedge between Nos. 10 and 11. They began to drift apart on policy objectives with fatal consequences for the Prime Minister&#x27;s ambitions. Thatcher&#x27;s dominant style contrasted with his emollience, patience and capacity for negotiation. Their differences were dated to the Westland Affair in 1986, when senior ministers almost forced her to resign, according to Douglas Hurd&#x27;s memoirs.

In June 1989, Howe and his successor as chancellor, Nigel Lawson, both secretly threatened to resign over Thatcher&#x27;s opposition to proposed British membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Howe supported the ERM because of his general support of European integration and because he had become convinced as chancellor of the need for more exchange rate stability. She turned increasingly for advice to her No.10 private secretary Charles Powell, a career diplomat who contrasted to Howe&#x27;s mandarin-style. Howe remarked: &quot;She was often exasperated by my tenaciously quiet brand of advocacy.&quot; His friends often wondered why he put up with her style for so long, but many considered him her successor. One historian has suggested that the government would have survived even the ructions over Europe had Howe remained her ally.

=== Deputy prime minister ===
In July 1989, the then little-known John Major was unexpectedly appointed to replace Howe as Foreign Secretary. Howe became Leader of the House of Commons, Lord President of the Council and Deputy Prime Minister. In the reshuffle, Howe was also offered, but turned down, the post of Home Secretary. Although attempts were made to belittle this aspect, Howe&#x27;s move back to domestic politics was generally seen as a demotion, especially after Thatcher&#x27;s press secretary Bernard Ingham belittled the significance of the deputy prime minister appointment, saying that the title had no constitutional significance, at his lobby briefing the following morning.

Howe then had to give up the Foreign Secretary&#x27;s country residence Chevening. The sceptical attitude towards Howe in Number 10 weakened him politically – even if it might have been driven to some degree by fear of him as a possible successor, a problem compounded by the resignation from the Treasury of his principal ally Nigel Lawson later in the same year. During his time as deputy prime minister, Howe made a series of coded calls on Thatcher to realign her administration, which was suffering rising unpopularity following its introduction of the poll tax, as a &quot;listening government&quot;.

=== Relationship with Thatcher ===
Tensions began to emerge in 1982 during the Falklands War when Thatcher, on the advice of Harold Macmillan (who warned against including the Treasury), refused to appoint him to the war cabinet. During his first budget, Thatcher wrote to Adam Ridley: &quot;The trouble with people like Geoffrey – lawyers – they are too timid.&quot; On the occasion of the general election victory of 1983, there were heated exchanges of views in No. 10 on her decision to move him to the Foreign Office. Howe was one of those who persuaded Michael Heseltine that on balance, it was probably better that he, rather than she, resign during the Westland affair in 1986. At the Scottish Party Conference in Perth in 1987, Howe spelt out his position for the European single market and the proposed Delors Plan (Thatcher having accepted the Single European Act in 1986). In the following year, Thatcher made her speech at Bruges declining the offer to deepen the bureaucratic state towards a &quot;Federalist Superstate&quot;.

At the Madrid inter-governmental conference, the tensions were ratcheted higher as Thatcher emphatically renounced any advance in British policy over the European agenda for &quot;ever closer union&quot; of political and economic forces. Howe forced her to give conditions for entering the proposal for entry to the ERM in June 1989. Howe and Nigel Lawson threatened to resign, but she called his bluff by appointing John Major over his head. Howe resented having to give up the state residence of Chevening in Kent on being effectively demoted to Lord President of the Council. He deeply resented leaving the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, a job he had always coveted. When Lawson resigned, it looked like a natural reshuffle, but Howe was frozen out of the inner circle. When Howe attended a meeting with the Queen, he found that Britain had joined the ERM before he had been informed about it – the ERM had been Howe&#x27;s policy. The pound sterling was thus pegged to the Deutsche Mark instead of the US dollar. The consequence was that Britain&#x27;s currency was pummelled into devaluation by a much stronger German economy – the option to leave cost Britain billions in 1992. But at the Rome Summit in October 1990, Thatcher was said to have exclaimed, in a fit of pique, &quot;no, no, no&quot; to the Delors Plan and repeated the government&#x27;s policy at Paris summit on 18–20 November. She also repeated the &quot;no, no, no&quot; message in the House of Commons on her return to Westminster. Howe had told Brian Walden (a former Labour MP) on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Weekend World&quot; that the &quot;government did not oppose the principle of a single currency&quot;, which was factually accurate – as its policy was that the &quot;hard ECU&quot; could evolve into a single currency, but that a single currency should not be imposed – but contrary to Thatcher&#x27;s emerging view.

=== Resignation ===
Howe tendered his resignation on 1 November 1990. Sometimes mocked as &quot;Mogadon man&quot; – Mogadon being a well-known sleeping medication – Howe delivered a blow to Thatcher&#x27;s government in full view of Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions and a packed House of Commons on 13 November. Howe later contended that the Community Charge was incompetently implemented, but it was the direction of European policy rather than domestic rioting that tipped the balance. His dispute with Thatcher was over matters of substance more than ones of style; he advocated a move back towards a more centrist position on constitutional and administrative issues, such as taxation and European integration. Howe represented a moderate position in the party, being educated, lawyerly, and diligent; while direct, he was conciliatory and collegial in style.

Howe wrote a cautiously worded letter of resignation in which he criticised the Prime Minister&#x27;s overall handling of UK relations with the European Community. After largely successful attempts by 10 Downing Street to claim that there were differences only in style, rather than substance, in Howe&#x27;s disagreement with Thatcher on Europe, Howe chose to send a powerful message of dissent. In his resignation speech in the Commons on 13 November 1990, he attacked Thatcher for running increasingly serious risks for the country&#x27;s future. He criticised her for undermining the policies on EMU proposed by her chancellor and governor of the Bank of England.

Howe offered a cricket simile for British negotiations on EMU in Europe: &quot;It&#x27;s rather like sending our opening batsmen to the crease only for them to find that before the first ball is bowled, their bats have been broken by the team captain.&quot; The simile was written by his wife, Elspeth, who was an avid cricket fan and had watched Thatcher use a cricket metaphor on the news the night before Howe gave his speech. He ended his speech with an appeal to cabinet colleagues: &quot;The time has come for others to consider their own response to the tragic conflict of loyalties, with which I have myself wrestled for perhaps too long.&quot; A few days later, Cledwyn Hughes, the Labour leader in the Lords, said: &quot;I much regretted the departure of Sir Geoffrey Howe from his office and from the Government. Sir Geoffrey was an outstanding member of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Administration since 1979 and his decision to leave reveals a fatal flaw in the management of our affairs.&quot;

Although Howe subsequently wrote in his memoir that his intention was only to constrain any shift in European policy by the Cabinet under the existing prime minister, his speech is widely seen as the key catalyst for the leadership challenge mounted by Michael Heseltine a few days later. Although Thatcher won the most votes in the leadership election, she did not win by a large enough margin to win outright. Subsequently, she withdrew from the contest on 22 November. Five days later, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major was elected party leader and thus became prime minister. The change proved to be a positive one for the Tories, who had trailed Labour in most opinion polls by a double-digit margin throughout 1990 but soon returned to the top of the polls and won the general election in April 1992.

== Retirement ==

Howe retired from the House of Commons in 1992 and was made a life peer on 30 June 1992 as Baron Howe of Aberavon, of Tandridge in the County of Surrey. He published his memoirs (1994) soon after. In the Lords, Howe continued to speak on a wide range of foreign-policy and European issues and led opposition to the Labour government&#x27;s plans from 1997 to convert the second chamber into a largely elected body – a position reiterated in the face of Coalition proposals in 2012. He retired from the House of Lords on 19 May 2015.

Following his retirement from the Commons, Howe took on several non-executive directorships in business and advisory posts in law and academia, including as an international political adviser to the US law firm Jones Day, a director of GlaxoSmithKline and J. P. Morgan, and visitor at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London.

His wife, Elspeth, a former chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Commission, was made a life peer in 2001. The Baroness Howe of Idlicote and her husband were among the few couples holding titles in their own right. Lord Howe was a patron of the UK Metric Association and the Conservative Foreign and Commonwealth Council. Howe was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 1996 Birthday Honours. He was an honorary fellow of SOAS. From 1996 to 2006 he was president of the Academy of Experts and in November 2014 was made an honorary fellow of the organisation in recognition of his contribution to the development of methods of dispute resolution.

Howe was a close friend of Ian Gow, the former MP, parliamentary private secretary, and personal confidant of Margaret Thatcher. He delivered the principal appreciation of Gow at the latter&#x27;s memorial service after the IRA murdered Gow in July 1990. Obituarists noted how Howe was &quot;warm and well liked by colleagues&quot;, with Nigel Lawson writing that he would be remembered by those who knew him &quot;as one of the kindest and nicest men in politics&quot; who, according to Andrew Rawnsley of &quot;The Observer&quot;, was frequently spoken of by fellow politicians &quot;as one of the most honest and decent practitioners of their profession&quot;.

Howe died from a heart attack at his home in Idlicote, Warwickshire, on 9 October 2015, at the age of 88.

==In popular culture==
Howe&#x27;s dramatic resignation speech in the House of Commons formed the basis of Jonathan Maitland&#x27;s 2015 play &quot;Dead Sheep&quot;. Howe was interviewed in 2012 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project.

Howe has been depicted multiple times in film and television, including being portrayed by Paul Rogers in &quot;&quot; (1991), John Sessions in &quot;Margaret&quot; (2009), Anthony Head in &quot;The Iron Lady&quot; (2011), Paul Jesson in season four of &quot;The Crown&quot; (2020), and Paul Higgins in &quot;Brian and Maggie&quot; (2025).

<doc id="307809" wikidata="Q422766" url="?curid=307809" title="C-reactive protein">
<text>C-reactive protein (CRP) is an annular (ring-shaped) pentameric protein found in blood plasma, whose circulating concentrations rise in response to inflammation. It is an acute-phase protein of hepatic origin that increases following interleukin-6 secretion by macrophages and T cells. Its physiological role is to bind to lysophosphatidylcholine expressed on the surface of dead or dying cells (and some types of bacteria) in order to activate the complement system via C1q.

CRP is synthesized by the liver in response to factors released by macrophages, T cells and fat cells (adipocytes). It is a member of the pentraxin family of proteins. It is not related to C-peptide (insulin) or protein C (blood coagulation). C-reactive protein was the first pattern recognition receptor (PRR) to be identified.

== History and etymology ==
Discovered by Tillett and Francis in 1930, it was initially thought that CRP might be a pathogenic secretion since it was elevated in a variety of illnesses, including cancer. The later discovery of hepatic synthesis (made in the liver) demonstrated that it is a native protein. Initially, CRP was measured using the quellung reaction which gave a positive or a negative result. More precise methods nowadays use dynamic light scattering after reaction with CRP-specific antibodies.

CRP was so named because it was first identified as a substance in the serum of patients with acute inflammation that reacted with the cell wall polysaccharide (C-polysaccharide) of pneumococcus.

== Genetics and structure ==

It is a member of the small pentraxins family (also known as short pentraxins). The polypeptide encoded by this gene has 224 amino acids. The full-length polypeptide is not present in the body in significant quantities due to signal peptide, which is removed by signal peptidase before translation is completed. The complete protein, composed of five monomers, has a total mass of approximately 120,000 Da. In serum, it assembles into stable pentameric structure with a discoid shape.

== Function ==

CRP binds to the phosphocholine expressed on the surface of bacterial cells such as pneumococcus bacteria. This activates the complement system, promoting phagocytosis by macrophages, which clears necrotic and apoptotic cells and bacteria. With this mechanism, CRP also binds to ischemic/hypoxic cells, which could regenerate with more time. However, the binding of CRP causes them to be disposed of prematurely. CRP binds to the Fc-gamma receptor IIa, to which IgG isotype antibodies also bind. In addition, CRP activates the classical complement pathway via C1q binding. CRP thus forms immune complexes in the same way as IgG antibodies.

This so-called acute phase response occurs as a result of increasing concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is produced by macrophages as well as adipocytes in response to a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions such as bacterial, viral, or fungal infections; rheumatic and other inflammatory diseases; malignancy; and tissue injury and necrosis. These conditions cause release of IL-6 and other cytokines that trigger the synthesis of CRP and fibrinogen by the liver.

CRP binds to phosphocholine on micro-organisms. It is thought to assist in complement binding to foreign and damaged cells and enhances phagocytosis by macrophages (opsonin-mediated phagocytosis), which express a receptor for CRP. It plays a role in innate immunity as an early defense system against infections.

== Serum levels ==

===Measurement methods===
Traditional CRP measurement only detected CRP in the range of 10 to 1,000 mg/L, whereas high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) detects CRP in the range of 0.5 to 10 mg/L. hs-CRP can detect cardiovascular disease risk when in excess of 3 mg/L, whereas below 1 mg/L would be low risk. Traditional CRP measurement is faster and less costly than hs-CRP, and can be adequate for some applications, such as monitoring hemodialysis patients. Current immunoassay methods for CRP have similar precision to hsCRP performed by nephelometry and could probably replace hsCRP for cardiovascular risk assessment, however, in the United States this would represent off-label use, making it a laboratory-developed test under FDA regulations.

===Normal===
In healthy adults, the normal concentrations of CRP varies between 0.8 mg/L and 3.0 mg/L. However, some healthy adults show elevated CRP at 10 mg/L. CRP concentrations also increase with age, possibly due to subclinical conditions. There are also no seasonal variations of CRP concentrations. Gene polymorphism of interleukin-1 family, interleukin 6, and polymorphic GT repeat of the CRP gene do affect the usual CRP concentrations when a person does not have any medical illnesses.

===Acute inflammation===
When there is a stimulus, the CRP level can increase 10,000-fold from less than 50 μg/L to more than 500 mg/L. Its concentration can increase to 5 mg/L by 6 hours and peak at 48 hours. The plasma half-life of CRP is 19 hours, and is constant in all medical conditions. Therefore, the only factor that affects the blood CRP concentration is its production rate, which increases with inflammation, infection, trauma, necrosis, malignancy, and allergic reactions. Other inflammatory mediators that can increase CRP are TGF beta 1, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. In acute inflammation, CRP can increase as much as 50 to 100 mg/L within 4 to 6 hours in mild to moderate inflammation or an insult such as skin infection, cystitis, or bronchitis. It can double every 8 hours and reaches its peak at 36 to 50 hours following injury or inflammation. CRP between 100 and 500 mg/L is considered highly predictive of inflammation due to bacterial infection. Once inflammation subsides, CRP level falls quickly because of its relatively short half-life.

===Metabolic inflammation===
CRP concentrations between 2 and 10 mg/L are considered as metabolic inflammation: metabolic pathways that cause arteriosclerosis and type II diabetes mellitus.

== Clinical significance ==

===Diagnostic use===
CRP is used mainly as an inflammation marker. Apart from liver failure, there are few known factors that interfere with CRP production. Interferon alpha inhibits CRP production from liver cells which may explain the relatively low levels of CRP found during viral infections compared to bacterial infections 

Measuring and charting CRP values can prove useful in determining disease progress or the effectiveness of treatments. ELISA and radial immunodiffusion methods are available for research use, while immunoturbidimetry is used clinically for CRP and nephelometry is typically used for hsCRP.Cutoffs for cardiovascular risk assessment have included:
* low: hs-CRP level under 1.0 mg/L
* average: between 1.0 and 3.0 mg/L
* high: above 3.0 mg/L

Normal levels increase with aging. Higher levels are found in late pregnant women, mild inflammation and viral infections (10–40 mg/L), active inflammation, bacterial infection (40–200 mg/L), severe bacterial infections and burns (&gt;200 mg/L).

CRP cut-off levels indicating bacterial from non-bacterial illness can vary due to co-morbidities such as malaria, HIV and malnutrition and the stage of disease presentation. In patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected sepsis, a CRP/albumin ratio of less than 32 has a negative predictive value of 89% for ruling out sepsis.

CRP is a more sensitive and accurate reflection of the acute phase response than the ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate). ESR may be normal while CRP is elevated. CRP returns to normal more quickly than ESR in response to therapy.

=== Cardiovascular disease ===

Recent research suggests that patients with elevated basal levels of CRP are at an increased risk of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. A study of over 700 nurses showed that those in the highest quartile of trans fat consumption had blood levels of CRP that were 73% higher than those in the lowest quartile. Although one group of researchers indicated that CRP may be only a moderate risk factor for cardiovascular disease, this study (known as the Reykjavik Study) was found to have some problems for this type of analysis related to the characteristics of the population studied, and there was an extremely long follow-up time, which may have attenuated the association between CRP and future outcomes. Others have shown that CRP can exacerbate ischemic necrosis in a complement-dependent fashion and that CRP inhibition can be a safe and effective therapy for myocardial and cerebral infarcts; this has been demonstrated in animal models and humans.

It has been hypothesized that patients with high CRP levels might benefit from use of statins. This is based on the JUPITER trial that found that elevated CRP levels without hyperlipidemia benefited. Statins were selected because they have been proven to reduce levels of CRP. Studies comparing effect of various statins in hs-CRP revealed similar effects of different statins. A subsequent trial however failed to find that CRP was useful for determining statin benefit.

In a meta-analysis of 20 studies involving 1,466 patients with coronary artery disease, CRP levels were found to be reduced after exercise interventions. Among those studies, higher CRP concentrations or poorer lipid profiles before beginning exercise were associated with greater reductions in CRP.

To clarify whether CRP is a bystander or active participant in atherogenesis, a 2008 study compared people with various genetic CRP variants. Those with a high CRP due to genetic variation had no increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those with a normal or low CRP. A study published in 2011 shows that CRP is associated with lipid responses to low-fat and high-polyunsaturated fat diets.

=== Coronary heart disease risk ===

Arterial damage results from white blood cell invasion and inflammation within the wall. CRP is a general marker for inflammation and infection, so it can be used as a very rough proxy for heart disease risk. Since many things can cause elevated CRP, this is not a very specific prognostic indicator. Nevertheless, a level above 2.4 mg/L has been associated with a doubled risk of a coronary event compared to levels below 1 mg/L; however, the study group in this case consisted of patients who had been diagnosed with unstable angina pectoris; whether elevated CRP has any predictive value of acute coronary events in the general population of all age ranges remains unclear. Currently, C-reactive protein is not recommended as a cardiovascular disease screening test for average-risk adults without symptoms.

The American Heart Association and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have defined risk groups as follows:
* Low Risk: less than 1.0 mg/L
* Average risk: 1.0 to 3.0 mg/L
* High risk: above 3.0 mg/L
But hs-CRP is not to be used alone and should be combined with elevated levels of cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, and glucose level. Smoking, hypertension and diabetes also increase the risk level of cardiovascular disease.

=== Fibrosis and inflammation ===

Scleroderma, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis elicit little or no CRP response. CRP levels also tend not to be elevated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) unless serositis or synovitis is present. Elevations of CRP in the absence of clinically significant inflammation can occur in kidney failure. CRP level is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. Patients with high CRP concentrations are more likely to develop stroke, myocardial infarction, and severe peripheral vascular disease. Elevated level of CRP can also be observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis.

High levels of CRP has been associated to point mutation Cys130Arg in the &quot;APOE&quot; gene, coding for apolipoprotein E, establishing a link between lipid values and inflammatory markers modulation.

=== Cancer ===

The role of inflammation in cancer is not well understood. Some organs of the body show greater risk of cancer when they are chronically inflamed. While there is an association between increased levels of C-reactive protein and risk of developing cancer, there is no association between genetic polymorphisms influencing circulating levels of CRP and cancer risk.

In a 2004 prospective cohort study on colon cancer risk associated with CRP levels, people with colon cancer had higher average CRP concentrations than people without colon cancer. It can be noted that the average CRP levels in both groups were well within the range of CRP levels usually found in healthy people. However, these findings may suggest that low inflammation level can be associated with a lower risk of colon cancer, concurring with previous studies that indicate anti-inflammatory drugs could lower colon cancer risk.

=== Obstructive sleep apnea ===

C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, is also increased in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). CRP and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were significantly higher in patients with OSA compared to obese control subjects. Patients with OSA have higher plasma CRP concentrations that increased corresponding to the severity of their apnea-hypopnea index score. Treatment of OSA with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) significantly alleviated the effect of OSA on CRP and IL-6 levels.

=== Rheumatoid arthritis ===

In the context of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), CRP is one of the acute phase reactants, whose assessment is defined as part of the joint 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA with abnormal levels accounting for a single point within the criteria. Higher levels of CRP are associated with more severe disease and a higher likelihood of radiographic progression. Rheumatoid arthritis associated antibodies together with 14-3-3η YWHAH have been reported to complement CRP in predicting clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients with recent onset inflammatory polyarthritis. Elevated levels of CRP appear to be associated with common comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and interstitial lung (pulmonary) disease. Mechanistically, CRP also appears to influence osteoclast activity leading to bone resorption and also stimulates RANKL expression in peripheral blood monocytes.

It has previously been speculated that single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CRP gene may affect clinical decision-making based on CRP in rheumatoid arthritis, e.g. DAS28 (Disease Activity Score 28 joints). A recent study showed that CRP genotype and haplotype were only marginally associated with serum CRP levels and without any association to the DAS28 score. Thus, that DAS28, which is the core parameter for inflammatory activity in RA, can be used for clinical decision-making without adjustment for CRP gene variants.

=== Viral infections ===

Increased blood CRP levels were higher in people with avian flu H7N9 compared to those with H1N1 (more common) influenza, with a review reporting that severe H1N1 influenza had elevated CRP. In 2020, people infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, had elevated CRP.

<text>Lavender oil is an essential oil obtained by distillation from the flower spikes of certain species of lavender. There are over 400 types of lavender worldwide with different scents and qualities. Two forms of lavender oil are distinguished, &quot;lavender flower oil&quot;, a colorless oil, insoluble in water, having a density of 0.885 g/mL; and &quot;lavender spike oil&quot;, a distillate from the herb &quot;Lavandula latifolia&quot;, having a density of 0.905 g/mL. Like all essential oils, it is not a pure compound; it is a complex mixture of phytochemicals, including linalool and linalyl acetate.

==Production==
Pure lavender essential oil is produced through steam distillation. This generates a greater amount of oil compared to other methods due to reduction of polar compound loss. Harvest of lavender blooms is typically between late June and August. The cut lavender flowers and stems are compacted into a lavender still. A boiler is then used to steam the bottom of the lavender flower filled still at a very low pressure. The lavender flower pockets containing oil are broken from this heating process and a pipe of cold water is run through the center of the still. The hot lavender oil vapor condenses on the cold pipe with the cold water and is collected into a holding tank where it is allowed to settle. Due to polarity and densities of the water and oil, these two will separate in the holding tank whereupon the water is piped out, leaving just lavender essential oil.

Lavender oil is produced around the world, with Bulgaria, France and China leading its production.

==Uses==
Lavender oil has been used as a perfume, aromatherapy, and skin application, but these uses have no clinical benefit. Lavender oil is used in massage therapy as a way of inducing relaxation through direct skin contact, although allergic reactions may occur. There is no good evidence to support the use of lavender oil for treating dementia. 

A 2021 meta-analysis included five studies of people with anxiety disorders. All five studies were funded by the manufacturers of the lavender oil capsule used, four of them were conducted by one author of the meta-analysis, and blinding was not clear. In this analysis, an oral 80 mg dose of lavender oil per day was associated with reduced anxiety scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, the effectiveness of using oral lavender oil for treating anxiety remains undetermined due to the limitations of these studies.

Oil of spike lavender was used as a solvent in oil painting, mainly before the use of distilled turpentine became common.

==Possible adverse effects==
Although lavender oil is generally recognized as safe for its intended uses, it is a potential endocrine disruptor that may affect breast development in children.

Many essential oils, including lavender oil, can be poisonous if swallowed. In general, of a diluted essential oil may cause toxicity in adults, whereas can be toxic in children. Over 2014-18 in New South Wales, there were 271 reported cases of lavender oil poisoning mostly in children accounting for 6.1% of all essential oil poisoning cases. The main toxic constituents of lavender oil are linalyl acetate and linalool.

Symptoms of lavender oil poisoning by ingestion include blurred vision, difficulty breathing, burning pain in the throat, burns to the eye, confusion, decreased level of consciousness, diarrhea, stomach pain, vomiting, and rash. Topical application of lavender oil may cause contact dermatitis.

Ingestion of lavender oil may cause interactions with prescription drugs, including anticoagulants, statins, and anticonvulsants.

==Phytochemicals==

The phytochemical composition of lavender oil varies from species to species (table), consisting primarily of monoterpeneoid and sesquiterpeneoid alcohols. Linalool (20-35%) and linalyl acetate (30-55%) dominate, with moderate levels of lavandulyl acetate, terpinen-4-ol and lavandulol, 1,8-cineole, camphor, limonene, and tannins. Lavender oil typically contains more than 100 compounds, although many of these are at negligible concentrations.

<doc id="307827" wikidata="Q3480510" url="?curid=307827" title="Universal service">
<text>Universal service is an economic, legal and business term used mostly in regulated industries, referring to the practice of providing a baseline level of services to every resident of a country. An example of this concept is found in the US Telecommunications Act of 1996, whose goals are:

*to promote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable, and affordable rates
*to increase access to advanced telecommunications services throughout the Nation
*to advance the availability of such services to all consumers, including those in low income, rural, insular, and high cost areas at rates that are reasonably comparable to those charged in urban areas

Universal service was widely adopted in legislation in Europe beginning in the 1980s and 1990s. For instance, under the EU Postal Services Directive (97/67/EC), the Electricity Market Directive (2003/54/EC) and the Telecommunications Directive (2002/22/EC). The language of &quot;universal service&quot; has also been used in proposals by the US Democratic Party for the reform of health care.

When the practice is applied to providing media content, a term &quot;must-carry&quot; is typically used.

==Origins of universal service==

The &quot;concept&quot; of universal service appears to have originated with Rowland Hill and the Uniform Penny Post which he introduced in the United Kingdom in 1837. Though Hill never used the term &quot;universal service&quot;, his postal system had the hallmarks of early universal service; postal rates were reduced to uniform rates throughout the nation which were affordable to most Britons, enabled by the postage stamp (first introduced here) and a General Post Office monopoly on mail. Hill&#x27;s reforms were quickly adopted by postal authorities worldwide, including the United States Post Office Department (now the United States Postal Service) which already held a monopoly through the Private Express Statutes. The service obligations of USPS under current law are commonly referred to as the &quot;universal service obligation&quot; or &quot;USO&quot;. Universal service is also a key objective of the Universal Postal Union.

==Interconnection between telephone exchanges (1907-1960s)==
===Bell system===
In the early history of the telephone up until the early 20th century, telephone service was fragmented. The ability to make a telephone call depended on not just on both parties having telephones, but that their telephone companies used the same standards and that there was a physical interconnect of their networks. The term &quot;universal service&quot; originated with Theodore Newton Vail, president of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (the original AT&amp;T) and head of the Bell System, in 1907 with the corporate slogan &quot;One Policy, One System, Universal Service&quot;. It was intended as a contrast to the &quot;dual service&quot; that had become common since the original Bell telephone patents expired in 1894, where independent telephone companies operated not only in non-Bell System markets, but also as a competitor in Bell markets.

These independent phone companies did not interconnect to the Bell System; though modern commentators suggest Bell refused to do so as an excuse for monopolization, it was argued then that phone systems of that day could not interconnect unless all phone companies used the same technology, as the Bell System did. This required many businesses to maintain phones with both companies, or else risk losing customers who subscribed to the other phone company.

Vail argued that an interconnected phone system (the Bell System), operated by one company (AT&amp;T) and with rates regulated by the government, would be superior to the dual system and would produce great social benefits, much like Hill&#x27;s postal reforms.

Eventually, Vail prevailed in his views, first through state laws and ultimately through the Kingsbury Commitment of 1913, where AT&amp;T agreed to several measures, including interconnection with non-competing independent phone companies, to avoid antitrust action, thus formalizing the Bell System monopoly. Meanwhile, the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910 made AT&amp;T subject to regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission.

By 1913, AT&amp;T had favored status from U.S. government, allowing it to operate in a noncompetitive economic environment in exchange for subjection to price and quality service regulation. The government asserted that a monopolistic telephone industry would best serve the goal of creating a &quot;universal&quot; network with compatible technology country-wide for telephone consumers. Regulators emphasized limits on profits, enforcing &quot;reasonable&quot; prices for service, setting levels of depreciation and investment for new technology and equipment, dependability and &quot;universality&quot; of service. &quot;Universal&quot; was originally used by AT&amp;T to mean, &quot;interconnection to other networks, not service to all customers&quot;. After years of regulation, the term came to include infrastructural development of telephony and service to everyone at a reasonable price.

=== Willis Graham Act of 1921 ===
The Willis Graham Act of 1921 was called into action in order to resolve pressing issues in the debate about the merits of interconnectivity of telecommunication. The act marks the first piece of legislation in the history of telecommunication to tackle the increasingly difficult challenges of the telecommunication industry in the 20th century. Before the Graham act was passed the commonly expressed opinion was, such as by the Senate Commerce Committee, that telephone service fit the definition of a natural monopoly.

The central practical problem, according to the committee, with the Willis Graham Act was competing telecommunication services serving one individual market. The act was in favor of a monopoly, which aimed to exempt competing telephone companies from the antitrust laws and allow them to unify the service by merging competing telecommunication service providers. The main principle behind the act was that there should be only one system in each community through which all users communicate. The focus was exclusively on local service rather than long-distance service, as no independent long-distance lines were able to compete with AT&amp;T.

===Communications Act of 1934===
Universal service in telecommunications was eventually established as U.S. national policy by the preamble of the Communications Act of 1934, whose preamble declared its purpose as “to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges”. The chief purpose of this law was to combine the Federal Radio Commission with the ICC&#x27;s wire communications powers, including regulation of AT&amp;T, into a new Federal Communications Commission with greater powers over both radio and wire communications. The language of the 1934 Communications Act was later re-interpreted to mean a commitment for telephone companies to provide service to all people, but historically this language was aimed at the more limited goal of unifying the United States&#x27; fragmentary telephone exchanges into a single universal system.

To comply with the act, AT&amp;T began increasing the price of long-distance service to pay for universal service. The act also established the FCC to oversee all non-governmental broadcasting, interstate communications, as well as international communication which originate or terminate in the United States.

==Providing service to all (1970s-present)==
Historians of AT&amp;T tend to hold that the modern concept of &quot;Universal Service&quot; has been essentially the same since the firm&#x27;s foundation. While agreeing that Vail&#x27;s coining of the term was clearly influential, other scholars have pointed to a significant shift in meaning connected to the Breakup of the Bell System where the meaning of &quot;Universal Service&quot; became less focused less on interconnection, and more on providing service to all.

The 1975 report to congress by Eugene V. Rostow on behalf of AT&amp;T was influential in offering a reinterpretation of the 1934 communications Act as defending the benefits of monopoly: not duplicating infrastructure and providing service to all. The Bell System divestiture of 1984 dissolved the monopoly that inspired &quot;Universal Service&quot; and the FCC began to abandon rate regulation.

Universal service, in the sense of aspiring to provide service to all was more explicitly codified by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, even as it permitted expanded competition in the telecommunications field. The Federal Communications Commission is actively exploring universal service reform, and the place of universal service to the broadband communications environment.

==Funding==
Most countries fund their USO by requiring the incumbent operator to be the designated USO provider or USP. USPs often previously held a legal monopoly protection. The USO is thus funded by rates/tariffs, and also by scale and scope economies. The risk of such an approach, while allowing competitive entry, is that a cross-subsidy exists and thus new entrants can potentially cream-skim (enter in only profitable routes or lines). One response is that some countries have a Universal Service Fund and have all their telecommunications industries pay a part of their net earnings into it. This fund has different names in different countries:

* Chile has the Telecommunications Development Fund (FDT),
* India has the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF),
* Pakistan has the Universal Service Fund Company (USF Co.),
* Taiwan has the Universal Service Fund (USF),
* Australia has the Telecommunications Industry Levy (TIL), etc.

== Implementation ==
Though the nomenclature is different the importance of the goal of universal service has been noted by most of the countries and similar methods are being implemented to work towards this end. Each country gives certain service providers Universal Service Provider or Eligible Telecommunications Carrier status. This allows the provider in question to get subsidies from the universal service fund to economically provide the necessary service.

The basic concept of Universal service is the below-cost pricing of service to increase the quantity of service as shown in Fig. 1. 

The figure shows a demand curve where the region in red shows the extent of the original service and the increase shown by the green area represents the increase in the service area once the subsidy helps reduce the prices. The conclusion is simple, as the prices reduce from P1 to P2 the quantity of customers increases form Q1 to Q2. Thus satisfying allowing universal service.

The size of the subsidy paid out to the telecommunication service provider in this case is shown in Fig.2.

Since each call in fact costs price P1 and price P2 in the cash flow from the customer, the rest (P1-P2) comes from the Universal Service Fund.
This is a simplistic case and most countries have very complex legislation to guarantee the service and have several subsidy mechanisms to implement universal service. The case shows the idea behind universal service not the universal service mechanism actually used in any country.

==Efficiency==
As seen from the above, the number of potential customers increases as the number of people who can now afford it increases. However service providers need to be able to actually provide that service through their network. This build-out of network is also subsidized by funds like the High Cost Fund in the United States which is also provided for in the Telecommunications Act of 1996.

Besides services to deprived areas, there is also a &quot;Lifeline&quot; program that subsidizes telephone service to low-income people regardless of location.

<doc id="307830" wikidata="Q5156358" url="?curid=307830" title="Competitive local exchange carrier">
<text>A competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC), in the United States and Canada, is a telecommunications provider company (sometimes called a &quot;carrier&quot;) competing with other, already established carriers, generally the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC).

==Background==
Local exchange carriers (LECs) are divided into incumbent (ILECs) and competitive (CLECs). The ILECs are usually the original, monopoly LEC in a given area, and receive different regulatory treatment from the newer CLECs. A data local exchange carrier (DLEC) is a CLEC specializing in DSL services by leasing lines from the ILEC and reselling them to Internet service providers (ISPs).

==History==

CLECs evolved from the competitive access providers (CAPs) that began to offer private line and special access services in competition with the ILECs beginning in 1985. The CAPs (such as Teleport Communications Group (TCG) and Metropolitan Fiber Systems (MFS)) deployed fiber optic systems in the central business districts of the largest U.S. cities (New York, Chicago, Boston, etc.) A number of state public utilities commissions, particularly New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts, encouraged this competition. By the early 1990s, the CAPs began to install switches in their fiber systems. Initially, they offered a &quot;shared PBX&quot; service with these switches and interconnected with the ILECs as end users rather than as co-carriers. However, the New York Public Service Commission authorized the nation&#x27;s first CLEC when it required New York Telephone (the ILEC) to allow Teleport Communications Group&#x27;s switches in New York City to connect as peers. Other states followed New York&#x27;s lead so that by the mid-1990s most of the large states had authorized local exchange competition.

==Growth==

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 incorporated the successful results of the state-by-state authorization process by creating a uniform national law to allow local exchange competition. This had the unintended consequence of stimulating the formation of many more CLECs than the markets could bear. The formation of these CLECs, with easy financing from equipment vendors and IPOs, was a significant contributor to the &quot;telecom bubble&quot; of the late 1990s which then turned into the &quot;bust&quot; of 2001–2002.

The original CAP/CLECs spent the decade from 1985–1995 deploying their own fiber optics networks and digital switches so that their only reliance on the ILEC was leasing some DS-1 loops to locations not served by the CLEC&#x27;s own fiber and interconnecting the CLEC&#x27;s switches with the ILECs&#x27; on a peer-to-peer basis. While not trivial dependencies, the original &quot;facilities-based&quot; CLECs such as TCG and MFS were beginning to become profitable by the time the Telecom Act was adopted. In contrast, many CLECs formed in the post-Telecom Act &quot;bubble&quot; operated using the unbundled Network Element Platform (UNE-P), in which they resold the ILECs&#x27; service by leasing the underlying copper and port space on the ILEC&#x27;s local switch. This greater dependency on the ILECs made these &quot;UNE-P CLECs&quot; vulnerable to changes in the UNE-P rules.

In the meantime, the largest facilities-based CLECs, MFS, and TCG, had IPOs and then were acquired by WorldCom and AT&amp;T, respectively, in 1996 and 1998 as those long distance companies prepared to defend their business customers from the Regional Bell Operating Companies&#x27; (RBOC) incipient entry into the long distance business.

==Important FCC rulings==
With the Triennial Review in August 2003, the FCC began to rewrite a large portion of the rules implementing the Telecommunications Act of 1996. One alternative to the UNE-P is unbundled network element loop (UNE-L), in which the CLEC has access to or operates their own local switch. The underlying copper (loop) that runs to the subscriber&#x27;s premises is then leased by the CLEC, and cross-connected to the CLEC&#x27;s switch. Both UNE-P and UNE-L have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. Other CLECs bypass the ILEC&#x27;s network entirely, using their own facilities. These facility-based LECs include cable companies offering phone service over coaxial cable.

Non facilities-based CLECs that operate under the UNE-P rules are able to resell wholesale services purchased from multiple ILECs, thereby establishing broader geographical coverage than ILECs or facilities-based CLECs.

In October 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a lower court&#x27;s ruling to stand (by refusing to hear the appeal) that voided rules requiring ILECs to lease certain network elements (such as local switching or the high-frequency portion of the loop) at a cost-based regulated wholesale price to CLECs. The FCC agreed earlier in the year to rewrite rather than appeal the validity of the rules. In December 2004, the FCC released another set of rules which phase out, over a year, all CLEC leasing of ILEC local switching, while preserving access to most copper local loops and some interoffice facilities.

== Proposed termination ==
In May 2018, USTelecom, the Washington, D.C. trade group for the major telecommunication companies, filed a petition with the FCC, asking it to end the leasing rule within years, which would terminate the CLEC operations of smaller telecommunications companies.

<text>In public relations and communication science, publics are groups of individual people, and the public (a.k.a. the general public) is the totality of such groupings. This is a different concept to the sociological concept of the &quot;Öffentlichkeit&quot; or public sphere. The concept of a public has also been defined in political science, psychology, marketing, and advertising. In public relations and communication science, it is one of the more ambiguous concepts in the field. Although it has definitions in the theory of the field that have been formulated from the early 20th century onwards, and suffered more recent years from being blurred, as a result of conflation of the idea of a public with the notions of audience, market segment, community, constituency, and stakeholder.

==Etymology and definitions==
The name &quot;public&quot; originates with the Latin &quot;&quot; (also &quot;&quot;), from &quot;&quot;, to the English word &#x27;populace&#x27;, and in general denotes some mass population (&quot;the people&quot;) in association with some matter of common interest. So in political science and history, a public is a population of individuals in association with civic affairs, or affairs of office or state. In social psychology, marketing, and public relations, a public has a more situational definition. John Dewey defined public as a group of people who, in facing a similar problem, recognize it and organize themselves to address it. Dewey&#x27;s definition of a public is thus situational: people organized about a situation. Built upon this situational definition of a public is the situational theory of publics by James E. Grunig , which talks of &quot;nonpublics&quot; (who have no problem), &quot;latent publics&quot; (who have a problem), &quot;aware publics&quot; (who recognize that they have a problem), and &quot;active publics&quot; (who do something about their problem).

In public relations and communication theory, a public is distinct from a stakeholder or a market. A public is a subset of the set of stakeholders for an organization, that comprises those people concerned with a specific issue. Whilst a market has an exchange relationship with an organization, and is usually a passive entity that is created by the organization, public does not necessarily have an exchange relationship, and is both self-creating and self-organizing. Publics are targeted by public relations efforts. In this, &quot;target publics&quot; are those publics whose involvement is necessary for achieving organization goals; &quot;intervening publics&quot; are opinion formers and mediators, who pass information to the target publics; and &quot;influentials&quot; are publics that the target publics turn to for consultation, whose value judgements are influential upon how a target public will judge any public relations material. The public is often targeted especially in regard to political agendas as their vote is necessary in order to further the progression of the cause. As seen in Massachusetts between 2003 and 2004, it was necessary to &quot;win a critical mass of states and a critical mass of public support&quot; in order to get same-sex marriage passed in the commonwealth.

Public relations theory perspectives on publics are situational, per Dewey and Grunig; mass, where a public is simply viewed as a population of individuals; agenda-building, where a public is viewed as a condition of political involvement that is not transitory; and &quot;homo narrans&quot;, where a public is (in the words of Gabriel M. Vasquez, assistant professor in the School of Communication at the University of Houston) a collection of &quot;individuals that develop a group consciousness around a problematic situation and act to solve the problematic situations&quot; . Public schools are often under controversy for their &quot;agenda-building,&quot; especially in debates over whether to teach a religious or secular curriculum. The promotion of an agenda is commonplace whenever one is in a public environment, but schools have exceptional power in that regard.

One non-situational concept of a public is that of Kirk Hallahan, professor at Colorado State University, who defines a public as &quot;a group of people who relate to an organization, who demonstrate varying degrees of activity—passivity, and who might (or might not) interact with others concerning their relationship with the organization&quot;.

Samuel Mateus&#x27;s 2011 paper &quot;Public as Social Experience&quot; considered to view the concept by an alternative point of view: the public &quot;is neither a simple audience constituted by media consumers nor just a rational-critical agency of a Public Sphere&quot;. He argued &quot;the concept should also be seen in the light of a publicness principle, beyond a critic and manipulative publicity (...). In accordance, the public may be regarded as the result of the social activities made by individuals sharing symbolic representations and common emotions in publicness. Seen with lower-case, the concept is a set of subjectivities who look publicly for a feeling of belonging. So, in this perspective, the public is still a fundamental notion to social life although in a different manner in comparison to 18th century Public Sphere&#x27;s Public. He means above all the social textures and configurations where successive layers of social experience are built up.&quot;

==Social publics==
Social publics are groups of people united by common ideas, ideology, or hobbies. Networked publics are social publics which have been socially restructured by the networking of technologies. As such, they are simultaneously both (1) the space constructed through networked technologies and (2) the imagined collective which consequently emerges as a result of the intersection of human persons, shared technologies, and their practices.

<text>ISO 639-1:2002, &quot;Codes for the representation of names of languages—Part 1: Alpha-2 code&quot;, is the first part of the ISO 639 series of international standards for language codes. Part 1 covers the registration of &quot;set 1&quot; two-letter codes. There are 183 two-letter codes registered as of June 2021. The registered codes cover the world&#x27;s major languages.

These codes are a useful international and formal shorthand for indicating languages.

Many multilingual web sites use these codes to prefix URLs of specific language versions of their web sites, for example, &quot;ru.&quot; before the website name is the Russian version of that website. See also IETF language tag. (Two-letter country-specific top-level-domain code suffixes are often different from these language-tag prefixes.)

ISO 639, the original standard for language codes, was approved in 1967. It was split into parts, and in 2002 ISO 639-1 became the new revision of the original standard. The last code added was codice_1, representing Haitian Creole on 2003-02-26. The use of the standard was encouraged by IETF language tags, introduced in RFC 1766 in March 1995, and continued by RFC 3066 from January 2001 and RFC 4646 from September 2006. The current version is RFC 5646 from September 2009. Infoterm (International Information Center for Terminology) is the registration authority for ISO 639-1 codes.

New ISO 639-1 codes are not added if an ISO 639-2 &quot;set 2&quot; three-letter code exists, so systems that use ISO 639-1 and 639-2 codes, with 639-1 codes preferred, do not have to change existing codes.

If an ISO 639-2 code that covers a group of languages is used, it might be overridden for some specific languages by a new ISO 639-1 code.

Part 3 (2007) of the standard, ISO 639-3, aiming to cover all known natural languages, largely supersedes the ISO 639-2 three-letter code standard.

There is no specification on treatment of macrolanguages (see ISO 639-3).

<doc id="307837" wikidata="Q7502714" url="?curid=307837" title="Shoulder problem">
<text>Shoulder problems including pain, are one of the more common reasons for physician visits for musculoskeletal symptoms. The shoulder is the most movable joint in the body. However, it is an unstable joint because of the range of motion allowed. This instability increases the likelihood of joint injury, often leading to a degenerative process in which tissues break down and no longer function well.

Shoulder pain may be localized or may be referred to areas around the shoulder or down the arm. Other regions within the body (such as gallbladder, liver, or heart disease, or disease of the cervical spine of the neck) also may generate pain that the brain may interpret as arising from the shoulder.

==Shoulder structures and functions==
The shoulder joint is composed of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) (see diagram). Two joints facilitate shoulder movement. The acromioclavicular (AC) joint is located between the acromion (part of the scapula that forms the highest point of the shoulder) and the clavicle. The glenohumeral joint, to which the term &quot;shoulder joint&quot; commonly refers, is a ball-and-socket joint that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. The &quot;ball&quot; is the top, rounded portion of the upper arm bone or humerus; the &quot;socket,&quot; or glenoid, is a dish-shaped part of the outer edge of the scapula into which the ball fits. Arm movement is further facilitated by the ability of the scapula itself to slide along the rib cage. The capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the glenohumeral joint. It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane.

The bones of the shoulder are held in place by muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Tendons are tough cords of tissue that attach the shoulder muscles to bone and assist the muscles in moving the shoulder. Ligaments attach shoulder bones to each other, providing stability. For example, the front of the joint capsule is anchored by three glenohumeral ligaments.

The rotator cuff is a structure composed of tendons that, with associated muscles, holds the ball at the top of the humerus in the glenoid socket and provides mobility and strength to the shoulder joint.

Four filmy sac-like structures called bursa permit smooth gliding between bone, muscle, and tendon. They cushion and protect the rotator cuff from the bony arch of the acromion.

==Diagnosis==
Following are some of the ways doctors diagnose shoulder problems:

===Medical history and physical exam===
* Medical history (the patient tells the doctor about an injury). For shoulder problems the medical history includes the patient&#x27;s age, dominant hand, if injury affects normal work/activities as well as details on the actual shoulder problem including acute versus chronic and the presence of shoulder catching, instability, locking, pain, paresthesias (burning sensation), stiffness, swelling, and weakness. Other salutary information includes OPQRST (onset, palliation/provocation, quality, radiation, severity, timing) and a history of issues that could lead to referred pain (pain felt at the shoulder but actually coming from another part of the body) including cervical spine disorders, heart attacks, peptic ulcer disease, and pneumonia. Standardized questionnaires like the Penn Shoulder Score that assess shoulder pain and function can aid in eliciting the required history to make a diagnosis and monitor condition progression.
* Physical examination of the shoulder to feel for injury and discover the limits of movement, location of pain, and extent of joint instability. The steps to elicit this information are inspection (looking), palpation (feeling), testing range of motion, and performing special maneuvers. Information collected on inspection are asymmetry, atrophy, ecchymosis, scars, swelling, and venous distention. Palpation can help find pain and deformities, and should specifically include the anterior glenohumeral joint, acromioclavicular joint, biceps tendon, cervical spine, coracoid process, scapula, and sternoclavicular joint. Range of motion tests external and internal rotation, abduction and adduction, passive and active weakness, and true weakness versus weakness due to pain. The Apley scratch test is the most useful: touch opposite scapular by reaching behind the head for adduction and external rotation and behind the back for abduction and internal rotation. Finally, there are more specific maneuvers that can home in on a diagnosis, however their accuracy is limited.

===Diagnostic tests===
* Tests to confirm the diagnosis of certain conditions. Some of these tests include:
** X-ray
** Arthrogram—Diagnostic record that can be seen on an X-ray after injection of a contrast fluid into the shoulder joint to outline structures such as the rotator cuff. In disease or injury, this contrast fluid may either leak into an area where it does not belong, indicating a tear or opening, or be blocked from entering an area where there normally is an opening.
** MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)--A non-invasive procedure in which a machine produces a series of cross-sectional images of the shoulder.
** Other diagnostic tests, such as injection of an anesthetic into and around the shoulder joint.

==Dislocation==
===Description===
The shoulder joint is the most frequently dislocated major joint of the body. In a typical case of a dislocated shoulder, a strong force that pulls the shoulder outward (abduction) or extreme rotation of the joint pops the ball of the humerus out of the shoulder socket. Dislocation commonly occurs when there is a backward pull on the arm that either catches the muscles unprepared to resist or overwhelms the muscles. When a shoulder dislocates frequently, the condition is referred to as shoulder instability. A partial dislocation where the upper arm bone is partially in and partially out of the socket is called a subluxation. In the medical community, dislocation is commonly referred to as luxation.

===Signs and diagnosis===
Almost all shoulder dislocations are downwards (inferior) and of these, 95 percent are in a forward direction. Clinically this is referred to as an anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint. Not only does the arm appear out of position when the shoulder dislocates, but the dislocation also produces pain. Muscle spasms may increase the intensity of pain. Swelling and bruising normally develop, and in some cases there may be numbness and muscle weakness. Problems seen with a dislocated shoulder are tearing of the ligaments or tendons reinforcing the joint capsule and, less commonly, nerve damage. Doctors usually diagnose a dislocation by a physical examination, but X-rays are taken to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out a related fracture and other complications. X-rays are also taken after relocation to ensure it is in the correct place.

===Treatment===
Doctors treat a dislocation by putting the head of the humerus back into the joint socket (glenoid fossa) of the scapula—a procedure called manipulation and reduction. This is usually followed up with an X-ray to make sure the reduction did not fracture the surrounding bones. The arm is then immobilized in a sling or a device called a shoulder immobilizer for several days. Usually the doctor recommends resting the shoulder and applying ice three or four times a day. After pain and swelling have been controlled, the patient enters a rehabilitation program that includes exercises to restore the range of motion of the shoulder and strengthen the muscles to prevent future dislocations. These exercises may progress from simple motion to the use of weights.

After treatment and recovery, a previously dislocated shoulder may remain more susceptible to reinjury, especially in young, active individuals. Ligaments are stretched and may tear due to dislocation. Torn ligaments and other problems resulting from dislocation can increase the chance of repeated dislocation. A shoulder that dislocates severely or often, injuring surrounding tissues or nerves, usually requires surgery to repair the damaged parts of the shoulder.

Sometimes the doctor performs surgery through a tiny incision into which a small scope (arthroscope) is inserted to observe the inside of the joint. After this procedure, called arthroscopic surgery, the shoulder is generally restrained by a sling for three to six weeks, while full recovery, including physical therapy, takes several months. Arthroscopic techniques involving the shoulder are relatively new and many surgeons prefer to repair a recurrent dislocating shoulder by the time-tested open surgery under direct vision. There are usually fewer repeat dislocations and improved movement following open surgery, but it may take a little longer to regain motion.

==Separation==
===Description===
A shoulder separation occurs where the collarbone (clavicle) meets the shoulder blade (scapula). When ligaments that hold the AC (acromioclavicular) joint together are partially or completely torn, the outer end of the clavicle may slip out of place, preventing it from properly meeting the scapula. Most often the injury is caused by a blow to the shoulder or by falling on an outstretched hand. After injury it is hard to do a 180 degrees rotation.

===Signs and diagnosis===
Shoulder pain or tenderness and, occasionally, a bump in the middle of the top of the shoulder (over the AC joint) are signs that a separation may have occurred. Sometimes the severity of a separation can be detected by taking X-rays while the patient holds a light weight that pulls on the muscles, making a separation more pronounced.

===Treatment===
A shoulder separation is usually treated conservatively by rest and wearing a sling. Soon after injury, an ice bag may be applied to relieve pain and swelling. After a period of rest, a therapist helps the patient perform exercises that put the shoulder through its range of motion. Most shoulder separations heal within two or three months without further intervention. However, if ligaments are severely torn, surgical repair may be required to hold the clavicle in place. A doctor may wait to see if conservative treatment works before deciding whether surgery is required.

==Sternoclavicular separation==

===Description===

While not directly a shoulder problem, this may affect shoulder functionality due to problems with sternoclavicular rotation. A sternoclavicular separation occurs when the sternum separates from the clavicle at the sternoclavicular joint. Sternoclavicular separations (dislocation and subluxation) are rare and generally caused by accident. If the clavicle is separated posteriorly (i.e. the clavicle separates and goes behind the sternum) the situation can be dangerous and the clavicle can cause damage to interior arteries, veins or organs.

===Signs and diagnosis===
An X-ray or CT Scan may be necessary to accurately diagnose a sternoclavicular separation.

===Treatment===
Treatment consists of the standard use of plenty of rest, icing, NSAIDs and a sling. The joint may need to be reduced (i.e. put back in place), especially after posterior separations. In severe cases, surgery may be advised.

==Rotator cuff tendinopathy (tendinitis, bursitis, impingement syndrome, and rotator cuff tears)==
=== Anatomy ===
The &quot;rotator cuff&quot; is a group of four tendons that blend together as they attach to the upper end of the arm bone (humerus). These tendons transmit the force of muscles originating on the shoulder blade (scapula) to the arm providing rotational motion and centering or stability of the joint.

===Pathology ===
The rotator cuff tendons degenerate with age. A group of respected scientists wrote in a review of existing evidence that, the theory that this degeneration is related to pinching (or impingement) between the head of the humerus and the acromion is now considered inaccurate. Rotator cuff pathology is similar in non-dominant compared to dominant and symptomatic compared to asymptomatic shoulder. About two-thirds of all humans develop rotator cuff tendinopathy if they live to 70 years of age. The pathology is mucoid degeneration, not inflammation. The process can involve the intra-articular part of the long head of biceps in addition to the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendons.

Tendinitis is inflammation (redness, soreness, and swelling) of a tendon. In tendinitis of the shoulder, the rotator cuff and/or biceps tendon become inflamed, usually as a result of being pinched by surrounding structures. The injury may vary from mild inflammation to involvement of most of the rotator cuff. When the rotator cuff tendon becomes inflamed and thickened, it may get trapped under the acromion. Squeezing of the rotator cuff is called impingement syndrome.

An inflamed bursa is called bursitis. Tendinitis and impingement syndrome are often accompanied by inflammation of the bursa sacs that protect the shoulder. Inflammation caused by a disease such as rheumatoid arthritis may cause rotator cuff tendinitis and bursitis. Sports involving overuse of the shoulder and occupations requiring frequent overhead reaching are other potential causes of irritation to the rotator cuff or bursa and may lead to inflammation and impingement.

==== Rotator cuff tear ====

The most commonly affected tendon is that of the supraspinatus muscle. Defects in the rotator cuff can come from an injury (cuff tear) or from degeneration (cuff wear). The degree to which a tendon is reparable depends on its quantity and quality. Degenerated tendons are often frail and retracted and may not be amenable to repair. Individuals that are elderly, smokers, or those having had cortisone injections often have weaker tendon tissue that fails without a significant injury. By contrast those whose tendon was torn by a substantial fall often have good quality tendon that can be repaired if surgery is performed promptly after the injury. The symptoms of rotator cuff disease include difficulty lifting the arm. Repair of a rotator cuff requires that the tendon be securely anchored to the bone at surgery and that the repair be protected for several months during healing.

===Signs===
Signs of these conditions include the slow onset of discomfort and pain in the upper shoulder or upper third of the arm and/or difficulty sleeping on the shoulder, similar condition can have sharp pain or discomfort when the upper shoulder is positioned at certain angles. Tendinitis and bursitis also cause pain when the arm is lifted away from the body or overhead. If tendinitis involves the biceps tendon (the tendon located in front of the shoulder that helps bend the elbow and turn the forearm), pain will occur in the front or side of the shoulder and may travel down to the elbow and forearm. Pain may also occur when the arm is forcefully pushed upward overhead.

===Diagnosis===
Diagnosis of tendinitis and bursitis begins with a medical history and physical examination. X-rays do not show tendons or the bursae but may be helpful in ruling out bony abnormalities or arthritis. The doctor may remove and test fluid from the inflamed area to rule out infection.
Ultrasound scans are frequently used to confirm a suspected tendinitis or bursitis as well as rule out a tear in the rotator cuff muscles.
Impingement syndrome may be confirmed when injection of a small amount of anesthetic (lidocaine hydrochloride) into the space under the acromion relieves pain.

===Treatment===
Anti-inflammatory medicines such as aspirin, naproxen or ibuprofen among others can be taken to help with pain. In some cases the physical therapist will use ultrasound and electrical stimulation, as well as manipulation. Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises are added gradually. If there is no improvement, the doctor may inject a corticosteroid medicine into the space under the acromion. However, recent level one evidence showed limited efficacy of corticosteroid injections for pain relief. While steroid injections are a common treatment, they must be used with caution because they may lead to tendon rupture. If there is still no improvement after six to 12 months, the doctor may perform either arthroscopic or open surgery to repair damage and relieve pressure on the tendons and bursae.

In those with calcific tendinitis of the shoulder high energy extracorporeal shock-wave therapy can be useful. It is not useful in other types of tendonitis. For a rotator cuff tear, tentative evidence suggests exercise may reduce pain in the short-term. Combination of exercise and joint mobilization can result in long term benefits. Other evidence demonstrates the use of corticosteroids injections to be more effective.

==SLAP tear (lesion)==
A SLAP (superior labrum anterior to posterior) tear occurs when the cartilage of the shoulder (labrum) delaminates from glenoid. This causes an instability of the shoulder, typically in overhead movements.

===Symptoms===

Symptoms include a dull ache deep in the shoulder joint, trouble sleeping due to the instability and discomfort, and extreme weakness in overhead activities.

===Diagnosis===

The best diagnosis for a SLAP tear is a clinical exam
followed by an MRI combined with a contrast agent.

===Treatment===

Very few cases recover to complete mobility without surgical intervention. Some patients are able to strengthen their shoulders to limit the day to day dull ache, but with limited mobility and function. Surgery reattaches the labrum to the glenoid through the use of surgical anchors.

===Recovery===

Recovery is often a lengthy process. The first four or so weeks the patient is required to wear a sling. Following this, there is a month of physical therapy to regain range of motion. At two months limited strength training occurs. At six months the patient is typically released to full active use, although many patients find that full recovery takes longer than this.

==Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)==
As the name implies, movement of the shoulder is severely restricted in people with a &quot;frozen shoulder&quot;. This condition, which doctors call adhesive capsulitis, is frequently caused by injury that leads to lack of use due to pain. Rheumatic disease progression and recent shoulder surgery can also cause frozen shoulder. Intermittent periods of use may cause inflammation. Adhesions (abnormal bands of tissue) grow between the joint surfaces, restricting motion. There is also a lack of synovial fluid, which normally lubricates the gap between the arm bone and socket to help the shoulder joint move. It is this restricted space between the capsule and ball of the humerus that distinguishes adhesive capsulitis from a less complicated painful, stiff shoulder. People with diabetes, stroke, lung disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and heart disease, or who have been in an accident, are at a higher risk for frozen shoulder. The condition rarely appears in people under the age of 40.

==Fracture==
===Description===
A bone fracture of the shoulder involves a partial or total crack through one of the three bones in the shoulder, the clavicle, the scapula, and the humerus. The break in a bone usually occurs as a result of an impact injury, such as a fall or blow to the shoulder. Fractures usually involve the clavicle or the neck (area below the ball) of the humerus. Fractures of the scapula sometimes occur through the coracoid process.

===Signs and diagnosis===
A shoulder fracture that occurs after a major injury is usually accompanied by severe pain. Within a short time, there may be redness and bruising around the area. Sometimes a fracture is obvious because the bones appear out of position.
(However this occur in non-involved dislocations and separations.) Both diagnosis and severity can be confirmed by X-rays.

===Treatment===
When a fracture occurs, the doctor tries to bring the bones into a position that will promote healing and restore arm movement. If the clavicle is fractured, the patient must at first wear a strap and sling around the chest to keep the clavicle in place. After removing the strap and sling, the doctor will prescribe exercises to strengthen the shoulder and restore movement. Surgery is occasionally needed for certain clavicle fractures, especially for disunions.

Fracture of the neck of the humerus is usually treated with a sling or shoulder immobilizer. If the bones are out of position, surgery may be necessary to reset them. Exercises are also part of restoring shoulder strength and motion.

==Arthritis of the shoulder (glenohumeral joint)==
===Description===
In arthritis of the shoulder, the cartilage of the ball and socket (glenohumeral joint) is lost so that bone rubs on bone.
It may be caused by wear and tear (degenerative joint disease), injury (traumatic arthritis), surgery (secondary degenerative joint disease), inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis) or infection (septic arthritis).

===Signs and diagnosis===

Arthritis of the shoulder causes pain and loss of motion and use of the shoulder. X-rays of the shoulder show loss of the normal space between the ball and socket. X-ray can provide radiographic staging of shoulder osteoarthritis.

===Treatment===
Early on arthritis of the shoulder can be managed with mild analgesics and gentle exercises. Known gentle exercises include warm water therapy pool exercises that are provided by a trained and licensed physical therapist; approved land exercises to assure free movement of the arthritic area; cortisone injections (administered at the minimum of every six months according to orthopedic physicians) to reduce inflammation; ice and hot moist pact application are very effective. Moist heat is preferred over ice whereas ice is preferred if inflammation occurs during the daytime hours. Local analgesics along with ice or moist heat are adequate treatments for acute pain.

In the case of rheumatoid arthritis, specific medications selected by a rheumatologist may offer substantial relief.

When exercise and medication are no longer effective, shoulder replacement surgery for arthritis may be considered. In this operation, a surgeon replaces the shoulder joint with an artificial ball for the top of the humerus and a cap (glenoid) for the scapula. Passive shoulder exercises (where someone else moves the arm to rotate the shoulder joint) are started soon after surgery. Patients begin exercising on their own about three to six weeks after surgery. Eventually, stretching and strengthening exercises become a major part of the rehabilitation programme. The success of the operation often depends on the condition of rotator cuff muscles prior to surgery and the degree to which the patient follows the exercise programme.

In young and active patients a partial shoulder replacement with a non-prosthetic glenoid arthroplasty may also be a consideration

==Arthritis or osteolysis of the AC (acromioclavicular) joint==

===Description===
The acromioclavicular articulation consists of the acromioclavicular ligament and a small disk of cartilage located in between the acromion and the clavicle. This disk can wear down through injury, extreme joint stress (via bodybuilding) or normal wear.

===Signs and diagnosis===
Pain is perceived on shoulder motion, especially on certain movements. Often a crossover arm test is utilized in diagnosis because this compresses the AC joint, exacerbating the symptoms. X-rays of the shoulder joint may show either arthritic changes of the ac joint or osteolysis.

===Treatment===
Conservative treatment for this joint is similar to treatments for other types of arthritis, including restricting activity, anti-inflammatory medications (or supplements), physical therapy, and occasionally cortisone shots. If the pain is severe, surgery may be an option. The most common surgical treatment, known as resection arthroplasty, involves cutting a very small portion off the clavicle end and letting scar tissue fill in its place. Some portions of the acromioclavicular ligament may still remain attached.

==Treatment==
A mnemonic for the basic treatment principles of any musculoskeletal problems is PRICE: Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation:
* &quot;Protection&quot;: Guard the shoulder to prevent further injury.
* &quot;Rest&quot;: Reduce or stop using the injured area for 48 hours.
* &quot;Ice&quot;: Put an ice pack on the injured area for 20 minutes at a time, 4 to 8 times per day. Use a cold pack, ice bag, or a plastic bag filled with crushed ice that has been wrapped in a towel.
* &quot;Compression&quot;: Compress the area with bandages, such as an elastic wrap, to help stabilize the shoulder.
* &quot;Elevation&quot;: Keep the injured area elevated above the level of the heart. Use a pillow to help elevate the injury.

If pain and stiffness persist, see a doctor.

According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) visits to orthopedic specialists for shoulder pain has been rising since 1998 and in 2005 over 13 million patients sought medical care for shoulder pain, of which only 34 percent were related to injury.

<text>Tileagd () is a commune located in Bihor County, Crișana, Romania. It is composed of six villages: Bălaia (&quot;Kabaláspatak&quot;), Călătani (&quot;Kalotaitanya&quot;), Poșoloaca (&quot;Pósalaka&quot;), Tileagd, Tilecuș (&quot;Telkesd&quot;) and Uileacu de Criș (&quot;Pusztaújlak&quot;).

==Geography==

It is on the picturesque road between Oradea and Cluj-Napoca, 23 kilometres from Oradea. The closest town to Tileagd is Aleșd, 12 km away. Tileagd is served by three CFR trains daily from Oradea, which continue to Aleșd, Huedin and Cluj-Napoca.

==Etymology==

Its Hungarian name originates in the word telek which means &quot;plot&quot; in English with a &quot;d&quot; affixture. The first written record about the village was made in a warrant of 1294&#x27;s copy of 1572 under the name Thelegd and then its name emerged in 1773 as Mező-Telegd.

==History==

At the beginning of the 13th century, a group of Székelys lived in the area, having moved from Udvarhelyszék. They were called &#x27;Székelys of Telegd&#x27; and the first name of Székelyudvarhely which is the centre Telegd, the area they moved into. In 1291, the founder of the Thelegdy family moved to here. In 1688, at the edge of the village, Imre Thököly&#x27;s Kuruc army was defeated by general Heissler. With the building of the railway line, animal and food businesses started thriving in 1870. Later many new industrial, financial and other institutions were founded; for example, the first bank &quot;Mezőtelegd vidéki Takarékpénztár Rt&quot; in 1890; and an oil refinery and its associated a works were built at the beginning of the 20th century.

==Population==
* In 1828, it had a population of 1575.
* In 1900, it had a population of 2508. These included 2034 Hungarians, 424 Romanians, 24 Germans, 13 Slovaks and 13 Gypsies.
* In 2002, it had a population of 3960. These included 2374 Romanians, 1016 Hungarians, 523 Gypsies and 40 Slovaks.

==Notable residents==
* The bishop of Nagyszombat and the archbishop of Esztergom, Miklós Telegdi, was born here.
* The wife of Stephen Bocskay, Kata Hagymássy, died here.

<doc id="307845" wikidata="Q268034" url="?curid=307845" title="Crișana">
<text>Crișana (), (), ) is a geographical and historical region in north-western Romania, named after the Criș (Körös) River and its three tributaries: the Crișul Alb, Crișul Negru, and Crișul Repede. In Romania, the term is sometimes extended to include areas beyond the border, in Hungary; in this interpretation, the region is bounded to the east by the Apuseni Mountains, to the south by the Mureș River, to the north by the Someș River, and to the west by the Tisza River, the Romanian-Hungarian border cutting it in two. However, in Hungary, the area between the Tisza River and the Romanian border is usually known as Tiszántúl.

== History ==

=== Ancient history ===

In ancient times, this area was settled by Celts, Dacians, Sarmatians, and Germanic peoples. In the first century BC, it was part of the Dacian Kingdom under Burebista.

=== Middle Ages ===

In the Middle Ages, it was ruled by the Hunnic Empire, the Kingdom of the Gepids, the Avar Empire, the Bulgarian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary.

Hungarian maps based on the Gesta Hungarorum call it Kazárország. According to Simon of Keza&#x27;s 13th C. Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum, the same area was ruled (under Zvataplug son of Morout), by Morout&#x27;s grandson Menumorout (Stallion of Morout) in the 10th century. Morout was a Prince of Poland who had supposedly subdued Bractari and ruled as Emperor of the Bulgars and Moravians. Prince Morout occupied Crișana and the people that are called Cozar inhabited that land in reference to the Cozlones. Prince Morout&#x27;s son Zvataplug appears to have been the father of Prince Morout&#x27;s grandson Menumorout who succeeded Zvataplug and wed his daughter to Árpád&#x27;s son Zoltán of Hungary father of Taksony of Hungary.

The largest city in the region, Oradea (), was most probably established during the early years of Hungarian rule. It is first mentioned in 1113 under the name &quot;Varadinum&quot; in a diploma belonging to Benedictine Zobor Abbey. The Romanian name &quot;Oradea&quot; originates from the Hungarian name &quot;Várad&quot;, meaning &quot;fortified place&quot;. The city was one of the most important cultural centres of the medieval Hungarian state: two Hungarian kings, Ladislaus I (1077-1095) and Sigismund (1387-1437) were buried there. After the canonization of Ladislaus I in 1192, his shrine at Várad became a Catholic pilgrimage site.

=== Modern History ===

After the Battle of Mohács (1526), the region became part of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. In 1552, the Ottoman Empire occupied the southern part of Crișana and included it in the newly established Temeşvar Eyalet. According to the Treaty of Speyer (1570), the rest of Crișana became part of the Principality of Transylvania, a successor state of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. 
John Sigismund Zápolya abdicated as King of Hungary and in return, Maximilian II of Habsburg recognized John Sigismund&#x27;s authority over the eastern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary. John Sigismund became &quot;princeps Transsylvaniae et partium regni Hungariae dominus&quot; – Prince of Transylvania and of a part of the Kingdom of Hungary (Partium). Crișana was included in the Partium.
The Ottoman Varat Eyalet that was formed in the second half of the 17th century was centered on Crișana. Since the end of the 17th century, the whole region became part of the lands of the Habsburg monarchy and was administratively divided between the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, the Habsburg Principality of Transylvania and the Habsburg Military Frontier.

Following the abolition of the Theiß-Muresch section of the Habsburg Military Frontier (in 1750) and the abolition of the Principality of Transylvania in 1867, the whole area was included again into the Kingdom of Hungary, which was then part of the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. During Habsburg administration, Crișana did not, on the whole, have special status such as that of Transylvania or the Banat; briefly, from 1850 to 1860, it was organized as the Military District of Großwardein. After disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Crișana was divided between Romania (eastern part) and Hungary (western part).

==Geography==
Romanian Crișana is located within the Pannonian basin and bounded in Romania by Maramureș to the north, Transylvania proper to the east, Banat to the south, and Hungary to the west. The region consists of the current Romanian counties of Arad (most of it), Bihor and some parts of Sălaj, Satu Mare, parts of Maramureș County (Codru, Chioar) and Hunedoara counties. Nowadays it is sometimes considered part of the historical region Transylvania, although it did not fall fully within the boundaries of the historical principality.

Hungarian Körösvidék is covered by the areas of Hajdú-Bihar County and Békés County. The southern part of Crișana, near the Mureș River, was called Pomorišje by the Serbs.

==Cities==
The most important cities are:
* Zalău, Oradea, Arad, Salonta, and Beiuș (in Romania)
* Debrecen, Békéscsaba, and Gyula (in Hungary)

<text>The concept of modern, big and self-service store came to Romania in mid-1990s. Since mid-2000s, there has been a strong growth in the number of supermarkets in the country, particularly in Bucharest and other main urban areas.

<doc id="307855" wikidata="Q537781" url="?curid=307855" title="Billa (supermarket)">
<text>BILLA () is an Austrian supermarket chain that operates in Central, Eastern and Southeast Europe. The company was founded by Karl Wlaschek in 1953. He sold his controlling interest to Germany&#x27;s REWE Group in 1996.

==History==
In 1953, Karl Wlaschek opened a discount perfume shop in the Vienna district of Margareten called WKW (&quot;Warenhandel Karl Wlaschek&quot;, translatable as &quot;Karl Wlaschek Trading&quot;). By 1960 WKW had 45 stores in Austria. In 1961 the chain was renamed Billa, a portmanteau of &quot;billiger Laden&quot;, German for &#x27;cheap shop&#x27;, and it started selling food and then went over to self-service. In 1965 the company had grown to 109 stores. REWE Group acquired Billa in 1996.

==Present locations==
Billa operates stores in four European countries:
===Austria===
Austria is the chain&#x27;s home market. As of March 2019, Billa had 1,069 stores in the country, second only to SPAR&#x27;s 1,538.

===Czech Republic===
The first Billa supermarket in the Czech Republic was opened on Stránského Street, Brno, on 26 October 1991. The company has 271 stores in the country and employs over 6,000 staff. Billa stores have an average sales area of 900 m2.

===Slovakia===
Billa opened its first store in Slovakia in 1993.

===Bulgaria===
The company opened its first supermarket in Bulgaria in 2000, and has since then expanded to cover 49 Bulgarian cities, operating a total of 156 supermarkets as of December 2023.

==Former locations==
Billa operated in other countries in the past.

===Russia===
The first Billa supermarket in Russia opened in 2004. In 2008, the network for the first time went outside of Moscow. In the same year, thirteen Yum-Yum supermarkets in Moscow were purchased.

In 2012, Billa bought the Russian supermarket chain Citistor (part of the former Ramstor chain).

Since 2008, all new Rewe Group stores in Russia in the &quot;supermarket&quot; format have been opened not under the Billa brand, but under the Biop (Billa Operations) brand. The reason is that only Billa Russia LLC had the right to develop the Billa brand in Russia, but one of the partners (22.5%)—the Russian holding &quot;Marta&quot;—since the end of 2008 stopped investing in the development of the company due to the beginning of the bankruptcy procedure. In June 2010, this package was purchased from &quot;Marta&quot;.

On January 27, 2011, the official renaming of all the stores of the Biop chain to the Bill stores took place. In 2018, 151 Billa stores were opened in Russia. In 2021, before the deal with Lenta, there were 161 stores operating across Russia mostly in Moscow and surrounding cities. The holding company Lenta LLC announced on May 18 that it had struck a deal to acquire the supermarkets business of Billa Russia GmbH for 215 millions € in cash.

=== Ukraine ===
The first BILLA supermarket in Ukraine was opened on February 3, 2000, in Kyiv. Over the next 14 years, the company developed actively — in 2014, the number of its stores reached 39. BILLA supermarkets were represented in 16 cities in 9 regions of the country.

Since 2015, the number of supermarkets has started to decrease. In June 2017, the company announced the sale of 9 of its stores in the regions at once. As of September 2017, the chain of supermarkets of the Austrian concern had decreased to 17 supermarkets, of which 12 were in Kyiv and the Kyiv region, two each in Dnipro and Odesa, and 1 in Zhytomyr.

In March 2019, there were 30 BILLA supermarkets in Ukraine.

On September 16, 2020, it became known that the Austrian company &quot;Rewe International AG&quot; sold the Ukrainian chain of supermarkets to the Lithuanian company Consul Trade House UAB, the founder of Novus Ukraine LLC.

<doc id="307860" wikidata="Q351287" url="?curid=307860" title="John Horne Tooke">
<text>John Horne Tooke (25 June 1736 – 18 March 1812), known as John Horne until 1782 when he added the surname of his friend William Tooke to his own, was an English clergyman, politician and philologist. Associated with radical proponents of parliamentary reform, he stood trial for treason in 1794.

==Early life and work==
He was the third son of John Horne, of Newport Street, Long Acre, Westminster, a member of the Worshipful Company of Poulters. As a youth at Eton College, he had claimed &quot;that his father was an eminent Turkey merchant&quot; implying that, rather than a dealer in poultry, he traded with the Eastern Mediterranean. Before Eton, he had been at school in Soho Square, in a Kentish village, and from 1744 to 1746 at Westminster School. He was blinded in his right eye during a schoolboy fight.

On 12 January 1754 he was admitted as sizar at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and took his degree of B.A. in 1758, as last but one of the senior optimes, Richard Beadon, his lifelong friend, afterwards Bishop of Bath and Wells, being a Wrangler in the same year. Horne had been admitted on 9 November 1756, as student at the Inner Temple, becoming friends with John Dunning and Lloyd Kenyon. His father wished him to take orders in the Church of England, and he was ordained deacon on 23 September 1759 and priest on 23 November 1760.

For a few months he was usher (assistant teacher) at a boarding school at Blackheath. On 26 September 1760 he became perpetual curate of New Brentford, the incumbency of which his father had purchased for him. Horne Tooke retained this poor living until 1773. During part of this time (1763–1764) he travelled on a tour in France, acting as a &#x27;bear-leader&#x27; (travelling tutor) to a wealthy man.

==Political career==

The excitement created by the actions of John Wilkes led Horne into politics, and in 1765 he brought out a scathing pamphlet on Bute and Mansfield, entitled &quot;The Petition of an Englishman&quot;.

In the autumn of 1765 he escorted another rich young man to Italy. In Paris he met Wilkes, and from Montpellier, in January 1766, addressed a letter to him which began the quarrel between them. In the summer of 1767 Horne returned, and in 1768 secured the return of Wilkes to parliament for Middlesex. With inexhaustible energy he promoted the legal proceedings over the riot in St George&#x27;s Fields when a youth named Allen was killed, and exposed the irregularity in the judge&#x27;s order for the execution of two Spitalfields weavers. His dispute with George Onslow, MP for Surrey, who at first supported and then threw over Wilkes for place, culminated in a civil action, ultimately decided, after the reversal of a verdict which had been obtained through the charge of Lord Mansfield, in Horne&#x27;s favour, and in the loss by his opponent of his seat in parliament. An influential association, called The Society for Supporting the Bill of Rights, was founded, mainly through the exertions of Horne and Wilkes, with the support of John Wheble, in 1769, but the members were soon divided into two opposite camps, and in 1771 Horne and Wilkes, their respective leaders, broke out into open dispute.

On 1 July 1771 Horne obtained at Cambridge his degree of M.A., though not without some opposition from members of both the political parties. Earlier in that year he claimed for the public the right of printing an account of parliamentary debates, and after a long struggle, the right was definitely established. In the same year (1771), Horne argued with Junius, and ended in disarming his masked antagonist.

===Study of law and personal legal problems===

Horne resigned his benefice in 1773 and began the study of the law and philology. An accident, however, occurred at this moment which largely affected his future. His friend William Tooke had purchased a considerable estate, including Purley Lodge, south of the town of Croydon in Surrey. The possession of this property brought about frequent disputes with an adjoining landowner, Thomas de Grey, and, after many actions in the courts, de Grey&#x27;s friends endeavoured to obtain, by a bill forced through the houses of parliament, the privileges which the law had not assigned to him (February 1774). Horne, thereupon, by a bold libel on the Speaker, drew public attention to the case, and though he himself was placed for a time in the custody of the serjeant-at-arms, the clauses which were injurious to the interest of Tooke were eliminated from the bill. Tooke declared his intention of making Horne the heir to his fortune, and during his lifetime he bestowed upon him large gifts of money.

No sooner had this matter been happily settled than Horne found himself involved in serious trouble. For his conduct in signing the advertisement soliciting subscriptions for the relief of the relatives of the Americans &quot;murdered by the king&#x27;s troops at Lexington and Concord,&quot; he was tried at the Guildhall on 4 July 1777, before Lord Mansfield, found guilty, and committed to the King&#x27;s Bench Prison in St George&#x27;s Fields, from which he only emerged after a year&#x27;s durance, and after a loss in fines and costs amounting to £1,200.

Soon after his release he applied to be called to the bar, but his application was rejected on the grounds that his orders in the Church were indelible. Horne thereupon tried his fortune, but without success, on farming some land in Huntingdonshire. Two tracts about this time exercised great influence in the country. One of them, &quot;Fads Addressed to Landholders, etc.&quot; (1780), written by Horne in conjunction with others, criticizing the measures of Lord North&#x27;s ministry, passed through numerous editions; the other, &quot;A Letter on Parliamentary Reform&quot; (1782), addressed by him to Dunning, set out a scheme of reform, which he afterwards withdrew in favour of that advocated by William Pitt the Younger.

On his return from Huntingdonshire he became once more a frequent guest at Tooke&#x27;s house at Purley, and in 1782 assumed the name of Horne Tooke. In 1786 Horne Tooke conferred perpetual fame upon his benefactor&#x27;s country house by adopting, as a second title of his elaborate philological treatise of &quot;Epea Pteroenta&quot; — the Greek phrase &quot;ἔπεα πτερόεντα&quot; (&quot;winged words&quot;) comes from Homer — the more popular though misleading title of &quot;The Diversions of Purley&quot;. The treatise at once attracted attention in England and the Continent. The first part was published in 1786, the second in 1805. The best edition is that which was published in 1829, under the editorship of Richard Taylor, with the additions written in the author&#x27;s interleaved copy.

Between 1782 and 1790 Horne Tooke gave his support to Pitt, and in the election for Westminster, in 1784, threw all his energies into opposition to Fox. With Fox he was never on terms of friendship, and Samuel Rogers, in his &quot;Table Talk&quot;, asserts that their antipathy was so pronounced that at a dinner party given by a prominent Whig not the slightest notice was taken by Fox of the presence of Horne Tooke. It was after the election of Westminster in 1788 that Horne Tooke depicted the rival statesmen (Lord Chatham and Lord Holland, William Pitt and Charles James Fox) in his celebrated pamphlet &quot;Two Pair of Portraits&quot;.

===Bids for office and treason trial===
At the general election of 1790, Horne Tooke stood as a candidate for the Westminster constituency, in opposition to Fox and Lord Hood, but was defeated. At a second attempt in 1796, he was again at the bottom of the poll. In the meantime, the excesses of the French republicans had provoked reaction in England, and the Tory ministry adopted a policy of repression.

Early on the morning of 16 May 1794 Horne Tooke was detained and conveyed to the Tower of London. His was one of a series of arrests that placed him in the company of a number of prominent figures associated with the London Corresponding Society, its opposition to the war with France and call for democratic reform, among them Thomas Hardy, Thomas Spence, Thomas Holcroft, and John Thelwall. For the government of William Pitt their trials in November for treason proved an acute embarrassment. Juries were not ready to accept mere expression of political opinion as evidence of plots against King and Parliament. When the evidence running to four printed volumes failed to impress in the case of Hardy, the courts were unable to take seriously the charges against his associates. Horne Tooke jeered at the Attorney-General and clowned in the dock. His jury took only eight minutes to settle on acquittal.

Horne Tooke&#x27;s public life after this event was only distinguished by one act of importance. Through the influence of the second Lord Camelford, he was returned to parliament at a by-election on 14 February 1801 for the pocket borough of Old Sarum. When he took his seat two days later an observer described him as &quot;very old&quot; (he was then aged 64) and &quot;lame&quot;, &quot;walking about the House from bench to bench ... followed by Sir Francis Burdett&quot;, his sponsor and a former pupil.

Lord Temple endeavoured to secure his exclusion on the ground that he had taken orders in the Church of England, and one of James Gillray&#x27;s caricatures delineates the two politicians, Temple and Camelford, playing at battledore and shuttlecock, with Horne Tooke as the shuttlecock. The ministry of Addington would not support this suggestion, but a bill was at once introduced by them and carried into law, which rendered all persons in holy orders ineligible to sit in the House of Commons, and Horne Tooke sat for only that parliament.

==Later years and legacy==

The last years of Horne Tooke&#x27;s life, from 1792 until his death in 1812, were spent in retirement, at Chester House on the west side of Wimbledon Common.

The traditions of Horne Tooke&#x27;s Sunday parties lasted unimpaired up to this point, and the most pleasant pages penned by his biographer describe the politicians and the men of letters who gathered around his hospitable board. Horne Tooke&#x27;s conversational powers rivalled those of Samuel Johnson; and, if more of his sayings have not been chronicled for the benefit of posterity, the defect is due to the absence of a James Boswell. Through the liberality of Horne Tooke&#x27;s friends, his last days were freed from the pressure of poverty, and he was enabled to place his illegitimate son in a position which soon brought him wealth, and to leave a competency to his two illegitimate daughters. Illness seized Horne Tooke early in 1810, and for the next two years his sufferings were acute. He died in his house at Wimbledon, London, and was buried with his mother at Ealing; the tomb which he had prepared in the garden attached to his house at Wimbledon was found unsuitable for the interment. An altar-tomb still stands to his memory in Ealing churchyard. A catalogue of his library was printed in 1813.

Many of Horne Tooke&#x27;s sayings are preserved in the table talk of Samuel Rogers and of Samuel Taylor Coleridge; the main facts of his life were set out by Thorold Rogers, in his &quot;Historical Gleanings&quot;, 2nd series. &quot;The Life of Horne Tooke&quot;, by Alexander Stephens, was written by an admirer who only knew Horne Tooke as an old man. William Hamilton Reid made a compilation, noticed in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, June 1812, by John William Ward. He is the subject of Coleridge&#x27;s poem &quot;Addressed to J. Horne Tooke and the Company Who Met on June 28, 1796 to Celebrate His Poll at the Westminster Election&quot;.

<doc id="307862" wikidata="Q1004693" url="?curid=307862" title="Fårö">
<text>Fårö () or  in Gutnish is a Baltic Sea island just north of the island of Gotland, itself off mainland Sweden&#x27;s southeastern coast. It is the second-largest island in the county and it is a popular summer resort. It has its own language, Faroymal, a dialect of Gutnish.

Fårö is also the name of the populated area () consisting of both Fårö and Gotska Sandön islands. It comprises the same area as the administrative Fårö District, established on 1January 2016.

==Geography==

The island is separated from Gotland by the narrow Fårö-strait, and connected by two car ferries, operated by the Swedish Transport Administration. It has a total area of , of which are water areas or islets.

On the islands of Fårö and Gotland are rock formations called rauk. They are a result of erosion during the Ice age and are unique to Gotland and Fårö.

The medieval Fårö Church is on Fårö. , Fårö Church along with Gotska Sandön Chapel on Gotska Sandön belongs to Fårö parish in Norra Gotlands pastorat.

One of the asteroids in the Asteroid belt, 9358 Fårö, is named after the island.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Fårö&quot; (in Gutnish ) is derived from the words , meaning island, and probably , which is a word stem associated with travel like in the Swedish verb (&#x27;to travel&#x27;). The word &quot;Fårö&quot; likely means &#x27;the island one has to travel to&#x27; or &#x27;the traveler&#x27;s island&#x27;. Mainland Swedes might misinterpret the name Fårö to be derived from , the (standard) Swedish word for sheep, due to the many sheep on the island. That word is absent from Modern Gutnish, which uses the word (which in Swedish means &#x27;lamb&#x27;).

==Demographics==
==Military past==

Carl Linnaeus spent two days in 1741 in Fårö during the expedition in which he surveyed the strategic and military resources of Gotland. 

Until the 1990s, Fårö and the North of Gotland were off-limits to foreigners because of a government military installation there. There were large, multilingual signs at the side of the roads informing visitors of this and the prohibition was strictly enforced. After the Cold War ended, the installation (Swedish Coastal Artillery regiment KA 3) was mostly shut down. A relic of the island&#x27;s military past is a tall radio mast at Holmudden at .

==Cinematic heritage==
Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman lived and died on Fårö and several of his films were filmed there, among them &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; (1961), &quot;Persona&quot; (1966), &quot;Hour of the Wolf&quot; (1968), &quot;Shame&quot; (1968), &quot;The Passion of Anna&quot; (1969), and &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; (1973), as well as Liv Ullmann’s &quot;Faithless&quot; (2000), based on a Bergman screenplay. The Bergman Week is a tribute to the filmmaker held on the island every June. Fårö itself is the subject of Bergman&#x27;s documentary films &quot;Fårö Document&quot; (1970) and &quot;Fårö Document 1979&quot;.

Andrei Tarkovsky wanted to film &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; on Fårö but was denied access by the military, so it was filmed further south on Gotland at När instead.

Mia Hansen-Løve filmed and set her film &quot;Bergman Island&quot; (2021) on Fårö.

==Tourism==
An annual event on Fårö is &quot;Fårönatta&quot; (Fårö Night), held in September, during which restaurants and bars stay open all night, craft stands are set up and the church holds a midnight Mass.

== Places of interest ==


=== Digerhuvud ===
The Digerhuvud coast with Bjärge nature reserve is the largest stack area in Sweden, with hundreds of stacks along a part of the coast. Close by is the Helgumannen fishing village. The coast is not suited for swimming due to its depth (up to close to the shore), and its strong currents.

An asteroid in the Asteroid belt, 10102 Digerhuvud, is named after the area.

===Fårö Lighthouse===
The &quot;Fårö Lighthouse&quot; lies on the island&#x27;s northeastern point. It is high and was built between 1846 and 1847.

===Langhammars===
The Langhammars peninsula and the Langhammars nature reserve on north-western Fårö are rocky beaches with Ice age stone monoliths known as rauks. Langhammars was the setting for Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s film &quot;Shame&quot;.

===Sudersand===
The long, sandy Sudersand beach on north-eastern Fårö lies next to Sudersands Semesterby which rents cabins to tourists.

<text>Michael John Knight Smith , better known as M. J. K. Smith or Mike Smith, (born 30 June 1933) is an English double international, in cricket and in rugby union. 

He was captain of Oxford University Cricket Club (1956), Warwickshire County Cricket Club (1957–1967) and the England cricket team (1963–1966). He was one of England&#x27;s most popular cricket captains. He also played rugby union, including one match for England in 1956. Smith was England&#x27;s most recent double international in cricket and rugby.

==University==

Born at Westcotes, Leicester, Smith was educated at Stamford School and St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where he read geography. He was president of Vincent&#x27;s Club in 1956. While at university in 1951–55 he played in the summer for Leicestershire County Cricket Club, the county of his birth. Smith came to prominence playing for Oxford University, scoring centuries in three consecutive Varsity matches against Cambridge, from 1954 to 1956. 

Smith also represented England at rugby union, playing against Wales in 1956. He remains England&#x27;s last double international to date in major sports by reference to his final appearance in 1972. Arthur Milton, a double international in football and cricket, is later in terms of his first appearance in a second sport, making his Test debut six weeks after Smith.

==Warwickshire captain==

Smith was encouraged to move to Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1957 to take over the captaincy. In the 1950s an amateur had to captain the county and Warwickshire had no capable amateurs. Wearing steel-rimmed spectacles, Smith was a heavy run-maker in County cricket and passed 2,000 runs a season each year from 1957 to 1962, including 3,245 runs (57.94) in 1959. Fred Trueman thought &quot;there is probably nobody in the world who plays the off-spinner better&quot;, but Smith&#x27;s fragility against fast bowling meant that he could not hold down a regular place in the Test team. It was not his only failing as &quot;Mike is widely remembered...as a very unreliable runner between the wickets. Warwickshire tales of woe in this respect are numerous and I can remember a call between them in 1964 going something like &quot;No A.C.&quot; – Yes, Mike&quot; – Wait A.C.&quot; – &quot;Damn it, Mike&quot; – &quot;Sorry A.C.&quot;&quot; He was, however, a mantis-like close fielder who took a record 593 catches for Warwickshire and 53 catches in 50 Tests for England. His outwardly nonchalant captaincy hid a good cricketing brain and he took a rebuilt Warwickshire side to third, fourth and second place in the County Championship in 1962–64.

==Early England career==

Mike Smith was called up as a makeshift opener against New Zealand in 1958, making 0 and 7 on debut on his home ground at Edgbaston in the First Test. In the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s he took 230 minutes to make 47 in a match where England (269) beat New Zealand (47 and 74) by an innings on a poor wicket. In the Third Test at Headingley Smith made 3 and was dropped. Recalled as a top order batsman against India in 1959 he made his maiden Test century, 100 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford followed by 98 in the Fifth Test at the Oval. He played his first full series in the West Indies in 1959–60, making 39 in the First Test, 108 in 350 minutes in England&#x27;s 256 run victory in the Second Test, taking longer to reach three figures than the notorious stonewaller Ken Barrington. Thereafter his weakness against quality fast bowling was exposed by Wes Hall and Chester Watson with innings of 12, 0, 10, 0, 23 and 20, but he recovered with 96 in the second innings of the Fifth Test, adding 197 for the seventh wicket with the wicketkeeper Jim Parks.

Smith was one of many signatories in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on 17 July 1958 opposing &#x27;the policy of apartheid&#x27; in international sport and defending &#x27;the principle of racial equality which is embodied in the Declaration of the Olympic Games&#x27;. Against South Africa in 1960 he started well with 54 and 28 in the First Test and top-scoring with 99 in the Second Test, where England won by an innings on another poor wicket. This was followed by 0, 0 and 11 and the next year against Australia he was out for a duck in the First Test at Edgbaston when the part-time bowler Ken Mackay took 3 wickets in four balls and he was dropped for the rest of the summer. It was thought that Smith would do better in India and Pakistan on the MCC tour of 1961–62 and he made another 99 in the First Test against Pakistan, having come in at 21/2 and adding 192 with Ken Barrington. This stood him in good stead as he made three successive ducks against India before recovering with 73 when recalled for the Fifth Test. Despite his powerful run-making in the County Championship Smith&#x27;s batting was classed as fragile and he was dropped from the England team for three years.

==England captain==

Smith captained England in 25 of his 50 Test match appearances, but in a period rich in batting talent he was rarely guaranteed a place. His uncertainty against fast bowling was exposed by a series of low scores in the mid-1960s, and Smith faced considerable press criticism, unusual for the time. Still, he was a good tourist and was made captain of the England tour of India in 1963–64 when Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey were unavailable and without England&#x27;s top bowlers Brian Statham and Fred Trueman. He lost the toss five times in a row and had so many injuries and illnesses that in the Second Test at Madras Smith had to use three batsmen, two wicket-keepers and six bowlers. When Mickey Stewart was unable to play after the first day because of dysentery he seriously considered calling up the cricket journalist Henry Blofeld, but managed to survive with just 10 men. Smith became the first England captain to draw all five Tests in a series (it was the third time India had done this) and was considered to have done well to avoid defeat. It was his best series with 306 runs (51.00) and when Ted Dexter retired after losing 1–0 to Bobby Simpson&#x27;s Australia in 1964 Smith was made captain for England&#x27;s last tour of South Africa before the Basil d&#x27;Oliveira Crisis. He won 1–0 against the talented Springboks, the last captain to defeat them in a Test series until 1996–97. It was also a personal success as he took four catches in the vital First Test and 10 in the series. He also made his third and last Test century, a top-score of 121 in England&#x27;s 442 as they replied to South Africa&#x27;s 501/7 in the Third Test, and finished with 257 runs (42.83). Wisden said, &#x27;MCC have sent more powerful teams from Lord&#x27;s than this one, but never one superior in terms of corporate effort on the playing pitch and harmony in the pavilion.&#x27;

Back in England in 1965, Smith beat a weak New Zealand 3–0, then lost 1–0 to South Africa, but was appointed captain for the MCC tour of Australia in 1965-66 with Cowdrey as vice-captain, despite support for the Kent captain at Lord&#x27;s. Although the press labelled the England team as the weakest to go to Australia, their entertaining cricket won them favour with the crowds. They also made their runs faster than any other England team since the war and for once England batted faster than Australia, a refreshing contrast to other Ashes series of the era. The tourists had had the best run of games of any MCC team since the war, beating Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales, drawing with Queensland, when they needed two more wickets to win, and losing to Victoria by 32 runs after an exciting run-chase. As a result, the bookies reduced the odds of their winning the Ashes from 7/2 to evens. England survived the follow on in the First Test and made 558 in the Second, both drawn. At Sydney in the Third Test England rattled up 488 and won by an innings and 93 runs to give them a 1–0 lead in the series. It was Australia&#x27;s biggest defeat at home for nearly 50 years, but they fought back to win the Fourth Test by an innings and retained the Ashes. Rain ruined play in New Zealand and the three Test series was drawn 0–0 despite the home team suffering at the hands of the England bowlers. On his return to England Smith was dropped after losing the First Test against the West Indies in 1966 by an innings. He was replaced by Cowdrey and retired at the end of the following season.

==Captaincy style and popularity==
&quot;...he strolled in with an open-necked shirt, a white linen jacket which appeared to have been slept in for a week and a carry-cot containing a slumbering junior member of the Smith dynasty. Apparently Mrs Smith had gone shopping and M.J.K. was left holding the baby. Despite an Oxford education his accent was utterly classless and between questions to which he appeared to be paying no attention whatever, he applied himself to solving the crossword in the latest Times to arrive from Britain. &quot;Good heavens&quot;, growled one of Australia&#x27;s senior cricket correspondents, &quot;what have we here?&quot; What we all had on that tour was the affable companionship of one of the most popular England captains ever to tour anywhere. It never occurred to him to leave the baby, let alone his wife, at home while he led the fight for the Ashes.&quot;
:Ian Wooldridge
Unlike his predecessors Len Hutton, Peter May and Ted Dexter Smith rode &quot;... the side with a loose rein, believing it knew where it was going and need only an occasional tug to keep it on the right course. I think most players appreciated this and his openness as a person brought a better response on the field&quot;. He thought that any bowler good enough to play for England knew what field suited him best, and generally let his men play in their own style, though this resulted in slow over rates as he did not chivvy them along. Even the truculent fast bowler John Snow &quot;...thought he was very astute in his handling of players...&quot; and recalled &quot;...Mike Smith adding a few words of congratulations in his thoroughly open, absent-minded-professor sort of way&quot;. E. W. Swanton reported that &quot;Smith, though outwardly unconventional and in manner casual to a degree, succeeds as a captain for the conventional reasons. He is thoughtful for his players, unselfish, does not &#x27;fuss&#x27; them or panic, shows a grasp of the situation which they deem generally sensible, and not least gives an inspiring personal lead in the field&quot;.

==Later career==

Smith returned to Warwickshire in 1970 and did well enough to be recalled for England for the first three Tests against Australia in 1972 before finally retiring in 1975. In later years he was chairman of Warwickshire County Cricket Club from 1991 until 2003. In November 1991, Smith became the first to officiate as a ICC match referee when he was appointed for the first Test of India&#x27;s tour of Australia; he oversaw four Tests and 17 ODIs in this role.

==Family==
His son Neil followed in his footsteps by captaining Warwickshire and playing, albeit only in One Day Internationals, for England. His daughter Carole is the wife of Sebastian Coe.

<doc id="307868" wikidata="Q2041357" url="?curid=307868" title="Richard Grenville-Temple, 2nd Earl Temple">
<text>Richard Grenville-Temple, 2nd Earl Temple, KG, PC (26 September 1711 – 12 September 1779) was a British politician and peer who served as Lord Privy Seal from 1757 to 1761. He is best known for his association with his brother-in-law William Pitt, serving with him in the Pitt–Newcastle ministry during Britain&#x27;s participation in the Seven Years&#x27; War from 1756 to 1761. He resigned, along with Pitt, in 1761 in protest over the ministry&#x27;s refusal to declare war on Spain.

==Early life==
The eldest son of Richard Grenville (1678–1727) of Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire, and of Hester, later Countess Temple, he was educated at Eton College, and in 1734 was returned to Parliament as member for the borough of Buckingham. In 1752, on the death of his mother, he inherited her titles together with the rich estates of Stowe and Wotton; and he then took the name of Temple in addition to his original surname of Grenville.

On 7 May 1737 he married Anna Chamber, an heiress.

==Seven Years War==

The turning point in his political fortunes was the marriage of his sister Hester in 1754 to William Pitt, later Earl of Chatham. Although Lord Temple had no outstanding qualities, his political career became linked with that of his brother-in-law. In November 1756 Temple became First Lord of the Admiralty in the ministry of Devonshire and Pitt. He was intensely disliked by George II, who dismissed both him and Pitt from office in April 1757. But when the coalition cabinet of Newcastle and Pitt was formed in June of the same year, Temple received the office of privy seal. He was the only member of the cabinet who supported Pitt&#x27;s proposal to declare war with Spain in 1761, and they resigned together on 5 October.

==Later career==
From this time Temple became one of the most factious of politicians; he himself is said to have avowed that &quot;he loved faction, and had a great deal of money to spare.&quot; He was on bad terms with his younger brother, George Grenville, when the latter became first lord of the treasury in April 1763, and he had no place in that ministry; but the brothers were reconciled before 1765, when Temple refused to join the government and persuaded Pitt to refuse likewise. A few weeks later the king offered terms to induce Pitt to form or join an administration; &quot;a ministry directed by that great statesman,&quot; wrote William Edward Hartpole Lecky

&quot;would have been beyond all comparison the most advantageous to the country; it had no serious difficulty to encounter, and Pitt himself was now ready to undertake the task, but the evil genius of Lord Temple again prevailed. Without his co-operation Pitt could not, or would not proceed, and Temple absolutely refused to take office even in the foremost place.&quot;

Pitt&#x27;s continued refusal to join the first Rockingham ministry may have been partly due to Temple, but before the end of 1765 the old friendship between the brothers-in-law was dissolving; and when at last in July 1766 Pitt agreed to form a government, Temple refused to join, offended because, although offered the Treasury, he was not to be allowed an equal share with Pitt in nominating to other offices. Temple then began to libel Pitt; and in conjunction with his brother George he concentrated the whole Grenville connection in hostility to the government. After George Grenville&#x27;s death in 1770 Lord Temple retired almost completely from public life.

Lord Temple was said to have been the author of several anonymous libels, and the inspirer of many more. Macaulay&#x27;s comparison of him with a mole working below &quot;in some foul, crooked labyrinth whenever a heap of dirt was flung up,&quot; from Horace Walpole, was partisan; but his character was rated very low by his contemporaries. In private life he used his wealth with generosity to his relations, friends and dependents. Pitt owed money to him. He was the principal backer behind &quot;The North Briton&quot; weekly newspaper, and he paid the costs incurred by John Wilkes in litigation. He also provided Wilkes with the freehold qualification which enabled him to stand for Middlesex in the election of 1768.

Although known as a man given to confrontation and strife, Earl Temple did get involved with one of London&#x27;s most fashionable charities of his time. He served as a vice president for the Foundling Hospital from 1760 to 1768, which was dedicated to the salvation of the large number of children abandoned by their parents in London each day. It cannot be ruled out that his involvement in this charity was motivated purely by compassion. However, it is possible that it also had to do with the achievement of status and access to other notable supporters, such as the Duke of Bedford, Lord Vere Beauclerk, and the Earl of Dartmouth, among others.

In addition to the estates he inherited, Temple gained a considerable fortune by his marriage in 1737 with Anne, daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Chambers of Hanworth, Middlesex; a volume of poems by her was printed at the Strawberry Hill Press in 1764.

==Cricket==
Like his friend George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, Grenville was keen on cricket. The earliest surviving record of his involvement in the sport comes from August 1741 when, as the patron and captain of the Buckinghamshire county team, he and Halifax organised the Northamptonshire v Buckinghamshire match at Cow Meadow, Northampton.

==Death==
Earl Temple died early in September 1779, aged 67, after a fall from his phaeton. The only issue of his marriage being a daughter who died in infancy, Temple was succeeded in the earldom by his nephew George Nugent-Temple-Grenville.

<doc id="307869" wikidata="Q13479645" url="?curid=307869" title="Transatlantic crossing">
<text>Transatlantic crossings are passages of passengers and cargo across the Atlantic Ocean between Europe or Africa and the Americas. The majority of passenger traffic is across the North Atlantic between Western Europe and North America. Centuries after the dwindling of sporadic Viking trade with Markland, a regular and lasting transatlantic trade route was established in 1566 with the Spanish West Indies fleets, following the voyages of Christopher Columbus.

== By sea ==

Prior to the 19th century, transatlantic crossings were undertaken in sailing ships, and the journeys were time-consuming and often perilous. The first trade route across the Atlantic was inaugurated by Spain a few decades after the European Discovery of the Americas, with the establishment of the West Indies fleets in 1566, a convoy system that regularly linked its territories in the Americas with Spain for over two centuries. Portugal created a similar maritime route between its ports in Brazil and the Portuguese mainland. Other colonial powers followed, such as Britain, France and the Netherlands, as they colonized the New World.

&quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; has awarded world records to vessels of various classes such as luxury liners, sail boats, and rowing boats. Because of the shape of the continents and the assistance (or resistance) of ocean currents, the Eastbound crossing is quicker than the Westbound crossing.

=== Passenger liners ===

Transatlantic passenger crossings became faster, safer, and more reliable with the advent of steamships in the 19th century. The wooden-hulled, paddle-wheel built in 1838 is recognized as the first purpose-built transatlantic steamship, on a scheduled run back and forth from Bristol to New York City. The design by British civil engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel was a breakthrough in its size, unprecedented passenger capacity, and for Brunel leveraging the fuel efficiency of a larger ship. It became the prototype for a generation of similar ships.

The British &amp; North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company started its year-round Liverpool-Halifax-Boston service in 1840, using four new s and a mail contract from the British government. The company later evolved into the Cunard Line, with Cunard&#x27;s dominance drawing the attention of the U.S. government, which had its own mail contract to offer to an American firm willing to compete. In 1850 the contract was awarded to the New York and Liverpool United States Steamship Company, which became the Collins Line, and which answered Cunard with its own four ships, which were newer, larger, faster, and more luxurious.

Competition developed among the industrial powers of the time—the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and the United States—to competitively build grand ocean liners as symbols of national technical skill and expressions of power, not just transport businesses. The competition was for speed. An award called the Blue Riband has been tracked since 1838, for the fastest average speed of a steamship in regular service across the Atlantic. This record became so critical to international prestige that the was commissioned by the British government specifically to take the Blue Riband back from the Germans and their SS &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot;, which it did in 1907. The government also required it be convertible into a troop carrier if needed. In 1935 shipping magnate Harold Hales formalized the prize by commissioning and donating the four-foot, solid silver Hales Trophy.

Examples of other famous transatlantic liners are , , , , , , , , , , &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;, , and the . The &quot;United States&quot; is the current holder of the Hales Trophy. In July 1952 that ship made the crossing in 3 days, 10 hours, 40 minutes. Cunard Line&#x27;s RMS Queen Mary 2 is the only ship currently making regular transatlantic crossings throughout the year, usually between Southampton and New York. For this reason it has been designed as a proper ocean liner, not as a cruise ship.

During World War II the transatlantic crossing was very important for the United Kingdom as much of Europe had been taken over by Germany and its allies preventing trade and supplies; the struggle is known as the Battle of the Atlantic.

===Smallest powerboat to cross the Atlantic===
In 2009, two brothers, Ralph and Robert Brown, crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a flats boat – a special boat designed to operate in extremely shallow water. This flats boat was designed and built by Ralph Brown. The voyage was called the &quot;I Am Second Wounded Hero Voyage&quot; in honor of the men who were killed in Operation Eagle Claw; Ralph Brown had been in the USMC at the time of the Operation and was told he was going to participate in the mission. Though he ultimately did not go, other servicemen who did perished in the failed military operation.

====Zodiac====
In 1952, Alain Bombard crossed the Atlantic from East to West, journeying 113 days in a Zodiac, .

====Rafts====
In 1956, Henri Beaudout crossed the Atlantic from West to East, from Halifax to Falmouth, on a raft of wood and rope, , in 88 days.

In 1970, Thor Heyerdahl crossed the Atlantic in &quot;Ra II&quot;, a papyrus raft built to an Ancient Egyptian design. This voyage followed an unsuccessful attempt the previous year in his first raft, &quot;Ra I&quot;.

In 1988, the junk raft, &quot;Son of Town Hall&quot;, crossed the North Atlantic Ocean.

In 2011, Anthony Smith and the Antiki crossed the Atlantic.

====Rowing and paddling====

On 13 June 2003, French rower Maud Fontenoy started an eastward crossing of the Atlantic from Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. She reached A Coruña in Spain on 10 October, becoming the first woman to accomplish this feat.

In 2005, the Vivaldi Atlantic 4 broke the previous rowing record of 55 days and setting a new record of 39 days.

On 26 October 2010, Polish sexagenarian Aleksander Doba was the first recorded individual to complete a non-stop transatlantic crossing by kayak. He departed Dakar, Senegal and arrived in Brazil 99 days later.

=====Transatlantic rowing races=====

In 1997, the first East–West Atlantic Rowing Race took place, running from the Canary Islands to the Caribbean. It now runs roughly once every two years.

In 2006, the first West–East North Atlantic Rowing Race took place, running from New York City to Falmouth, Cornwall in the UK.

=====Sail=====
In 1775, the 62-ton schooner &quot;Quero&quot;, sailed by John Derby from Salem, Massachusetts to the Isle of Wight in 28 days (April 28 to May 25).

In 1866, the lifeboat &quot;Red, White and Blue&quot; sailed from New York City to Margate, England, in 38 days. In 1870 and 1871, The 20-ft yawl City of Ragusa sailed from Queenstown, Ireland, to New York and back, crewed by two men (and a dog) each way.

==Transatlantic flights==

Transatlantic flight surpassed ocean liners as the predominant mode of crossing the Atlantic in the mid 20th century. In 1919, the American NC-4 became the first airplane to cross the Atlantic (but in multiple stages). Later that year, a British Vickers Vimy piloted by Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic flight from Newfoundland to Ireland. Also in 1919, the British were the first to cross the Atlantic in an airship when the R34 captained by Major George Herbert Scott of the Royal Air Force with his crew and passengers flew from East Fortune, Scotland to Mineola, Long Island, covering a distance of about in about four and a half days; he then made a return trip to England, thus also completing the first double crossing of the Atlantic (east–west–east). The first aerial crossing of the South Atlantic was made by the Portuguese naval aviators Gago Coutinho and Sacadura Cabral in 1922. Coutinho and Cabral flew from Lisbon, Portugal, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in stages, using three different Fairey III biplanes, and they covered a distance of between 30 March and 17 June. The first night-time crossing of the Atlantic was accomplished during 16–17 April 1927 by the Portuguese aviators Sarmento de Beires, Jorge de Castilho and Manuel Gouveia, flying from the Bijagós Archipelago, Portuguese Guinea, to Fernando de Noronha, Brazil in the &quot;Argos&quot;, a Dornier Wal flying boat. In May 1927, Charles Lindbergh made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between New York City and Paris). The second solo piloting, and the first to carry a passenger, was Clarence Duncan Chamberlin on 6 June 1927. Edward R. Armstrong proposed a string of anchored &quot;seadromes&quot; to refuel planes in a crossing.

The first serious attempt to take a share of the transatlantic passenger market away from the ocean liners was undertaken by Germany. In the 1930s, Germany crossed the Atlantic with Zeppelins that could carry about 60 passengers in a similar luxurious style to the ocean liners. However, the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster in 1937 put an end to transatlantic Zeppelin flights.

On 1 June 1944, two K-class blimps from Blimp Squadron ZP-14 of the United States Navy (USN) completed the first transatlantic crossing by non-rigid airships. The two K-ships (K-123 and K-130) left South Weymouth, MA on 28 May 1944 and flew approximately 16 hours to Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland. From Argentia, the blimps flew approximately 22 hours to Lajes Field on Terceira Island in the Azores. The final leg of the first transatlantic crossing was about a 20-hour flight from the Azores to Craw Field in Port Lyautey (Kenitra), French Morocco.

Beginning in the 1950s, the predominance of ocean liners began to wane when larger, jet-powered airplanes began carrying passengers across the ocean in less and less time. The speed of crossing the ocean therefore became more important than the style of crossing it. The maturing passenger Jet Age starting with the Boeing 707 reduced the typical crossing time between London and New York City to between 6.5 and 8 hours, depending on weather conditions. By the 1970s, supersonic Concorde airplanes could connect the two cities in less than 4 hours, and only one ocean liner, &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; remained on the transatlantic route for those who favored the slower style of travel.

The economics of commercial transatlantic flying have evolved markedly since the 1950s; the introduction of widebody airliners (such as the Boeing 747 and Douglas DC-10) in the early 1970s made affordable transatlantic travel to the masses a reality. Since the 1990s, the high reliability of modern jet engines has meant that twin-engine jet aircraft such as the Boeing 767, Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 have largely taken over on transatlantic routes from quad-engine jets, whilst the supersonic Concorde was ultimately doomed by its high running costs, leading to its retirement in 2003. Since the late 1990s, twin-engined, narrow-body jet airliners have been used for transatlantic service, meaning that city pairs between major North American hubs and secondary European cities can now be connected directly without the need for larger widebody jets, which were uneconomic on routes with lower passenger demand. The Boeing 757 started this trend when it became ETOPS certified, although the most recent versions of both the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 now have transatlantic capability.

== Transatlantic cables ==
Transatlantic cables are cables that have been laid along the ocean floor to connect North America and Europe. Before the advent of radio, the only means of communication across the Atlantic Ocean was to physically connect the continents with a transatlantic telegraph cable, the first of which was installed from Valentia, Ireland to Heart&#x27;s Content, Newfoundland in 1858. It worked for a month.

The first pair of eastbound and westbound transatlantic telephone cables, TAT-1, were laid in 1955 and 1956 by the cable ship HMTS &quot;Monarch&quot;. The first transatlantic fiber optic cable, TAT-8, was installed in 1988.

The exchange rate between the United States dollar and British pound is still colloquially known as &quot;cable&quot; by financial marketeers, from the early use of the transatlantic cable for this purpose.

== Transatlantic tunnel ==

A transatlantic tunnel is a theoretical structure proposed several times since the late 19th century. It would be a tunnel spanning the Atlantic Ocean between New York City and the United Kingdom or France.

==Duration of transatlantic crossings==
The introduction of various technologies facilitated progressively faster transatlantic crossings. The duration to travel westbound from Europe to North America when a new transport innovation was introduced for commercial use is listed below:

* 1620: 66 days: fluyt &quot;Mayflower&quot; (Southampton to Cape Cod)
* 1838: 18 days 4 hours: paddle steamer SS &quot;Sirius&quot; (Cork to New York City)
* 1863: 8 days 3 hours: single screw steamship RMS (Queenstown to New York City)
* 1889: 5 days 19 hours: double screw steamship SS &quot;City of Paris&quot; (Queenstown to Sandy Hook)
* 1907: 4 days 20 hours: steam turbine-equipped steamship: RMS (Queenstown to Sandy Hook)
* 1929: 4 days 3 hours: bulbous bow-equipped steamship: SS (Cherbourg to Ambrose Light)
* 1936: 4 days: Yarrow boiler-equipped steamship: RMS (Bishop Rock to Ambrose Light)
* 1936: 2 days 5 hours: airship LZ 129 &quot;Hindenburg&quot; (Frankfurt to Lakehurst)
* 1939: 1 day 3 hours: flying boat Pan Am Boeing 314 Clipper &quot;Yankee Clipper&quot; (Southampton to Port Washington via Foynes, Botwood and Shediac)
* 1945: 14 hours: landplane American Overseas Airlines Douglas DC-4 (London to New York City via Gander)
* 1958: 10 hours 20 minutes: jet aircraft BOAC de Havilland Comet (London to New York City via Gander)
* 1976: 3 hours 30 minutes: supersonic aircraft British Airways Concorde (London to Washington, D.C.)

<text>Mary Ellis (born May Belle Elsas; June 15, 1897 – January 30, 2003) was an American actress and singer who spent most of her career in Britain. Trained as a lyric soprano, she began performing at the Metropolitan Opera where she created the role of Genovieffa in the world premiere of Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Suor Angelica&quot; in 1918. In 1924 she originated the title role in Rudolf Friml&#x27;s operetta &quot;Rose-Marie&quot; at Broadway&#x27;s Imperial Theatre. Other Broadway parts included Shakespeare roles such as Kate in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;.

After immigrating to England in 1930, Ellis performed in musicals in London&#x27;s West End. She achieved enduring fame in the leading roles of the original productions of two Ivor Novello pieces: &quot;Glamorous Night&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Dancing Years&quot; (1938). After performing welfare work in hospitals during World War II, she returned to acting in London in plays by Noël Coward, Terence Rattigan and Shakespeare. She also worked in radio, television and film; including in &quot;The 3 Worlds of Gulliver&quot; in 1960. Her career spanned more than half a century of her 105-year-long life.

==Biography==
Ellis was born in Manhattan in New York City, to German parents, Herman Elsas and Caroline Elsas (&quot;née&quot; Reinhardt), who was a pianist. She first became interested in performing around 1910, and in a vocational course began to train her lyric soprano voice under the tutelage of Belgian contralto Freida de Goebele and Italian operatic coach Fernando Tanara.

She made her debut with the Metropolitan Opera on December 14, 1918, in the world premiere of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Il trittico&quot;, creating the role of Genovieffa in &quot;Suor Angelica&quot;, the second of the evening&#x27;s three one-act operas. Later in the run, she also played Lauretta in the third opera of the triptych, &quot;Gianni Schicchi.&quot; She also appeared in the premiere of &quot;L&#x27;oiseau bleu&quot; by Albert Wolff, singing Mytyl, in 1919. While in the Metropolitan company she sang Giannetta in &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; to Enrico Caruso&#x27;s Nemorino and Fyodor in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; to Feodor Chaliapin&#x27;s Boris.

On Broadway, Ellis played the roles of street urchin and errand girl in &quot;Louis&quot; in 1921, Nerissa in the 1922 production of &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot; and The Dancer from Milan in &quot;Casanova&quot; (1923). She gained wider notice by creating the title role in Rudolf Friml&#x27;s long-running operetta &quot;Rose-Marie&quot; in 1924. She played Leah in The Neighborhood Playhouse&#x27;s 1925 adaptation of &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;, and her later Broadway roles included Anna in &quot;The Crown Prince&quot; (1927), Kate in a long-running revival of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (1927–1928), The Baroness of Spangenburg &quot;12,000&quot; (1928) and Jennifer in &quot;Meet the Prince&quot;. In 1929 she acted the title role in &quot;Becky Sharp&quot; in the Players&#x27; Club adaptation of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and played Laetitia in 1930 in &quot;Children of Darkness&quot;.

In 1930, Ellis emigrated to England with Basil Sydney, her third husband, whom she had married in 1929. In London&#x27;s West End, she starred in Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;Music in the Air&quot; (1933) and went on to her best remembered roles as the heroines of three Ivor Novello operettas: &quot;Glamorous Night&quot; (1935), &quot;The Dancing Years&quot; (1939) and &quot;Arc de Triomphe&quot; (1943). She also starred in several films in the 1930s, including a film version of &quot;Glamorous Night&quot; in 1937.

For most of World War II, Ellis was absent from the theatre, performing welfare work in hospitals, and from time to time giving concerts to entertain members of the armed forces. Returning to the stage after the war, Ellis was successful in the 1944 and 1947 British productions of Noël Coward&#x27;s melodrama &quot;Point Valaine&quot;, playing a hotel keeper in a sordid, clandestine relationship with her head waiter. In 1948 she gave one of her most praised performances as the embittered Millie Crocker-Harris in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;The Browning Version&quot;. In 1952 she played Volumnia in Coriolanus for the nine-month Stratford season.

In 1954, Ellis was cast as Mrs. Erlynne in Coward&#x27;s musical &quot;After the Ball&quot;, but her singing voice had deteriorated drastically, and much of her music had to be cut. Coward blamed her performance for the relative failure of the show. She appeared in the 1960 movie &quot;The 3 Worlds of Gulliver&quot; and made her last stage appearance in 1970, playing Mrs Warren in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot; at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford. She appeared in 1993 and 1994 in two episodes of the television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; and again in 1994.

She became a centenarian in 1997 and died at her home on Eaton Square in London on January 30, 2003, at the age of 105.

==Memoir and autobiography==
Ellis published her memoirs in 1982 under the title &quot;Those Dancing Years&quot;. A further autobiography &quot;Moments of Truth&quot; followed in 1986. She was the last surviving performer to have created a role in a Puccini opera and the last to have sung opposite Caruso.

<doc id="307874" wikidata="Q655132" url="?curid=307874" title="Sacred Band of Thebes">
<text>The Sacred Band of Thebes (Ancient Greek: , &quot;Hierós Lókhos&quot;) was a troop of select soldiers, consisting of 150 pairs of male couples which formed the elite force of the Theban army in the 4th century BC, ending Spartan domination. 

Its predominance began with its crucial role in the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC. It was annihilated by Philip II of Macedon in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC.

== Formation ==

The earliest surviving record of the Sacred Band by name was in 324 BC, in the oration &quot;Against Demosthenes&quot; by the Athenian logographer Dinarchus. He mentions the Sacred Band as being led by the general Pelopidas and, alongside Epaminondas who commanded the army of Thebes (Boeotia), were responsible for the defeat of the Spartans at the decisive Battle of Leuctra (371 BC).

Plutarch (46–120 AD), a native of the village of Chaeronea, is the source of the most substantial surviving account of the Sacred Band. He records that the Sacred Band was originally formed by the boeotarch Gorgidas, shortly after the expulsion of the Spartan garrison occupying the Theban citadel of Cadmea. The 2nd century AD Macedonian author Polyaenus in his &quot;Stratagems in War&quot; also records Gorgidas as the founder of the Sacred Band. However, Dio Chrysostom (c. 40–120 AD), Hieronymus of Rhodes (c. 290–230 BC), and Athenaeus of Naucratis (c. 200 AD) credit Epaminondas instead.

The exact date of the Sacred Band&#x27;s creation, and whether it was created before or after the &quot;Symposium&quot; of Plato (c. 424–347 BC) and the similarly titled &quot;Symposium&quot; by his rival Xenophon (c. 430–354 BC), has also long been debated. The generally accepted date of the Sacred Band&#x27;s creation is between 379 and 378 BC. Prior to this, there were references to elite Theban forces also numbering 300. Herodotus (c.484–425 BC) and Thucydides (c. 460–395 BC) both record an elite force of 300 Thebans allied with the Persians, who were annihilated by Athenians in the Battle of Plataea (479 BC). Herodotus describes them as &quot;the first and the finest&quot; () among Thebans. Diodorus also records 300 picked men () present in the Battle of Delium (424 BC), composed of &quot;heníochoi&quot; (, &quot;charioteers&quot;) and &quot;parabátai&quot; (, &quot;those who walk beside&quot;). Though none of these mention the Sacred Band by name, these may have referred to the Sacred Band or at least its precursors. Historian John Kinloch Anderson believes that the Sacred Band was indeed present in Delium, and that Gorgidas did not establish it, but merely reformed it.

In the old debate surrounding Xenophon&#x27;s and Plato&#x27;s works, the Sacred Band has figured prominently as a possible way of dating which of the two wrote their version of &quot;Symposium&quot; first. Xenophon&#x27;s Socrates in his &quot;Symposium&quot; disapprovingly mentions the practice of placing lovers beside each other in battle in the city-states of Thebes and Elis, arguing that while the practice was acceptable to them, it was shameful for Athenians. Both Plato and Xenophon were Athenians. According to the British classical scholar Sir Kenneth Dover, this was a clear allusion to the Sacred Band, reflecting Xenophon&#x27;s contemporary, albeit anachronistic, awareness of the Theban practice, as the dramatic date of the work itself is c. 421 BC.

However, it is the speech of the character Phaedrus in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; referring to an &quot;army of lovers&quot; that is most famously connected with the Sacred Band; even though it does not technically refer to the Sacred Band, since the army referred to is hypothetical. Dover argues Plato wrote his &quot;Symposium&quot; first since Plato&#x27;s Phaedrus uses language that implies that the organization does not yet exist. He acknowledges, however, that Plato may have simply put the hypothesis in the mouth of Phaedrus according to the supposed earlier dramatic date of the work (c. 416 BC). It only shows that Plato was more mindful of his chronology in his &quot;Symposium&quot; than Xenophon, and proves that he was actually quite aware of the Sacred Band in his time.

==Composition==
According to Plutarch, the 300 hand-picked men were chosen by Gorgidas purely for ability and merit, regardless of social class. It was composed of 150 male couples, each pair consisting of an older &quot;erastês&quot; (, &quot;lover&quot;) and a younger &quot;erômenos&quot; (, &quot;beloved&quot;). Athenaeus of Naucratis also records the Sacred Band as being composed of &quot;lovers and their favorites, thus indicating the dignity of the god Eros in that they embrace a glorious death in preference to a dishonorable and reprehensible life&quot;, while Polyaenus describes the Sacred Band as being composed of men &quot;devoted to each other by mutual obligations of love&quot;. The origin of the &quot;sacred&quot; appellation of the Sacred Band is unexplained by Dinarchus and other historians. But Plutarch claims that it was due to an exchange of sacred vows between lover and beloved at the shrine of Iolaus (one of the lovers of Heracles) at Thebes. He also tangentially mentions Plato&#x27;s characterization of the lover as a &quot;friend inspired of God&quot;.

The Sacred Band was stationed in Cadmea as a standing force, likely as defense against future attempts by foreign forces to take the citadel. It was occasionally referred to as the &quot;City Band&quot; (), due to their military training and housing being provided at the expense of the Boeotian &quot;polis&quot;. Their regular training included wrestling and dance. The historian James G. DeVoto points out that Gorgidas previously served as a hipparch (cavalry officer), therefore equestrian training was also likely provided. The exact ages of the unit&#x27;s members are not recorded in ancient testimonies. However, comparing them with the Spartan elite unit &quot;hippeis&quot; () and the Athenian &quot;epheboi&quot; (ἔφηβοι) recruits, DeVoto estimates that trainees were inducted as full members to the Sacred Band at the ages of 20 to 21, whereupon they were given a full set of armor by their &quot;erastai&quot;. They likely ended their service at age 30.

== Military history ==

According to Plutarch, Gorgidas originally distributed the members of the Sacred Band among the front ranks of the phalanxes of regular infantry. In 375 BC, the command of the band was transferred to the younger boeotarch Pelopidas, one of the original Theban exiles who had led the forces who recaptured Cadmea. Under Pelopidas, the Sacred Band was united as a single unit of shock troops. Their main function was to cripple the enemy by engaging and killing their best men and leaders in battle.

=== Invasions of Agesilaus II ===
The Sacred Band first saw action in 378 BC, at the beginning of the Boeotian War. It was during the famous stand-off between the Athenian mercenary commander (and later &quot;strategos&quot;) Chabrias (d. 357 BC) and the Spartan King Agesilaus II (444 BC–360 BC). Prior to the creation of the Sacred Band under Gorgidas, the Athenians had helped the Theban exiles retake control of Thebes and the citadel of Cadmea from Sparta. This was followed by Athens openly entering into an alliance with Thebes against Sparta. In the summer of 378 BC, Agesilaus led a Spartan expedition against Thebes from the Boeotian city of Thespiae (then still allied to Sparta).

The Spartan forces were held up for several days by Theban forces manning the earthen stockades at the perimeter of Theban territory. The Spartans eventually breached the fortifications and entered the Theban countryside, devastating the Theban fields in their wake. Though the Athenians had by this time joined the Theban forces, they were still outnumbered by the Spartans. With the fall of the stockades, they were left with two choices, either to retreat back to the defensible walls of Thebes or to hold their ground and face the Spartans in the open. They chose the latter and arrayed their forces along the crest of a low sloping hill, opposite the Spartan forces. Gorgidas and the Sacred Band occupied the front ranks of the Theban forces on the right, while Chabrias and an experienced force of mercenary hoplites occupied the front ranks of the Athenian forces on the left.

Agesilaus first sent out skirmishers to test the combined Theban and Athenian lines. These were easily dispatched by the Theban and Athenian forces, probably by their more numerous cavalry. Agesilaus then commanded the entire Spartan army to advance. He may have hoped that the sight of the massed Spartan forces resolutely moving forward would be enough to intimidate the Theban and Athenian forces into breaking ranks. The same tactic had worked for Agesilaus against Argive forces in the Battle of Coronea (394 BC).

It was during this time that Chabrias gave his most famous command. With scarcely separating the two armies, Agesilaus was expecting the Theban and Athenian forces to charge at any moment. Instead, Chabrias ordered his men to stand at ease. In unison, his mercenary hoplites immediately assumed the resting posture—with the spear remaining pointing upwards instead of towards the enemy, and the shield propped against the left knee instead of being hoisted at the shoulders. Gorgidas, on seeing this, also commanded the Sacred Band to follow suit, which they did with the same military drill precision and confidence. The audacity of the maneuver and the discipline of the execution was such that Agesilaus halted the advance. Seeing that his attempts to provoke the Theban and Athenian forces to fight on lower ground were unsuccessful, Agesilaus eventually thought it wiser to withdraw his forces back to Thespiae.

Shortly after the stand-off in Thebes, Agesilaus disbanded his army in Thespiae and returned to Peloponnesos through Megara. He left the general Phoebidas as his harmost (military governor) at Thespiae, the same general responsible for the Spartan seizure of the citadel of Cadmea in 382 BC. Phoebidas began making various raids into Theban territory using the Spartans under his command and Thespian conscripts. These forays became so destructive that by the end of the summer, the Thebans went out in force against Thespiae under the command of Gorgidas.

Phoebidas engaged the advancing Theban army with his peltasts. The harrying of the light infantry apparently proved too much for the Thebans and they started to retreat. Phoebidas, hoping for a rout, rashly pursued them closely. However, the Theban forces suddenly turned around and charged Phoebidas&#x27; forces. Phoebidas was killed by the Theban cavalry. His peltasts broke ranks and fled back to Thespiae pursued by Theban forces. Aside from Polyaenus, none of these accounts mention the Sacred Band by name, but given that they were under the command of Gorgidas, they are likely to have been part of Theban forces involved.

Not long afterwards, Agesilaus mounted a second expedition against Thebes. After a series of skirmishes which he won with some difficulty, he was forced again to withdraw when the Theban army came out full force as he approached the city. Diodorus observes at this point that the Thebans thereafter faced the Spartans with confidence. Gorgidas disappears from history between 377 and 375, during which the command of the Sacred Band was apparently transferred to Pelopidas.

===Battle of Tegyra===

As a single unit under Pelopidas, the first recorded victory of the Sacred Band was at the Battle of Tegyra (375 BC). It occurred near the Boeotian city of Orchomenus, then still an ally of Sparta. Hearing reports that the Spartan garrison in Orchomenus had left for Locris, Pelopidas quickly set out with the Sacred Band and a few cavalry, hoping to capture it in their absence. They approached the city through the northeastern route since the waters of Lake Copais were at their fullest during that season. Upon reaching the city, they learned that a new &quot;mora&quot; had been sent from Sparta to reinforce Orchomenus. Unwilling to engage the new garrison, Pelopidas decided to retreat back to Thebes, retracing their northeastern route along Lake Copais. However, they only reached as far as the shrine of Apollo of Tegyra before encountering the returning Spartan forces from Locris.

The Spartans were composed of two &quot;morai&quot; led by the &quot;polemarchoi&quot; Gorgoleon and Theopompus. They outnumbered the Thebans at least two to one. According to Plutarch, upon seeing the Spartans, one Theban allegedly told Pelopidas &quot;We are fallen into our enemy&#x27;s hands&quot; to which Pelopidas replied, &quot;And why not they into ours?&quot; He then ordered his cavalry to ride up from the rear and charge while he reformed the Sacred Band into an abnormally dense formation, hoping to at least cut through the numerically superior Spartan lines. The Spartans advanced, confident in their numbers, only to have their leaders killed immediately in the opening clashes. Leaderless and encountering forces equal in discipline and training for the first time in the Sacred Band, the Spartans faltered and opened their ranks, expecting the Thebans to pass through and escape. Instead, Pelopidas surprised them by using the opening to flank the Spartans. The Spartans were completely routed, with considerable loss of life. The Thebans didn&#x27;t pursue the fleeing survivors, mindful of the remaining Spartan &quot;mora&quot; stationed in Orchomenus less than away. They stripped the dead and set up a &quot;tropaion&quot; (τρόπαιον, a commemorative trophy left at the site of a battle victory) before continuing on to Thebes. Having proven their worth, Pelopidas kept the Sacred Band as a separate tactical unit in all subsequent battles.

An account of the battle was mentioned both by Diodorus and Plutarch, both based heavily on the report by Ephorus. Xenophon conspicuously omits any mention of the Theban victory in his &quot;Hellenica&quot;, though this has traditionally been ascribed to Xenophon&#x27;s strong anti-Theban and pro-Spartan sentiments. An obscure allusion to Orchomenus in &quot;Hellenica&quot;, however, implies that Xenophon was aware of the Spartan defeat.

The exact number of the belligerents on each side varies by account. Diodorus puts the number of Thebans at 500 against the Spartans&#x27; 1,000 (each &quot;mora&quot; consisting of 500 men), apparently basing it on Ephorus&#x27; original figures. Plutarch puts the number of the Thebans at 300, and acknowledges three sources for the number of Spartans: 1000 by the account of Ephorus; 1,400 by Callisthenes (c. 360–328 BC); or 1,800 by Polybius (c. 200–118 BC). Some of these numbers may have been exaggerated due to the overall significance of the battle. The battle, while minor, was remarkable for being the first time a Spartan force had been defeated in pitched battle, dispelling the myth of Spartan invincibility. It left a deep impression in Greece and boosted the morale among Boeotians, foreshadowing the later Battle of Leuctra. In Plutarch&#x27;s own words:

Shortly after this, the Athenians initiated the Common Peace of 375 BC (Κοινὴ Εἰρήνη, &quot;Koine Eirene&quot;) among Greek city-states. According to Xenophon, they were alarmed at the growing power of Thebes and weary of fending off Spartan fleets alone as the Thebans were not contributing any money to maintaining the Athenian fleet. However this broke down soon after in 374 BC, when Athens and Sparta resumed hostilities over Korkyra (modern Corfu). During this time period, Athens also gradually became hostile to Thebes. While Athens and Sparta were busy fighting each other, Thebes resumed her campaigns against the autonomous pro-Spartan Boeotian &quot;poleis&quot;. Thespiae and Tanagra were subjugated and formally became part of the reestablished democratic Boeotian confederacy. In 373 BC, Thebans under the command of the boeotarch Neocles attacked and razed its traditional rival, the Boeotian city of Plataea. The Plataean citizens were allowed to leave alive, but they were reduced to being refugees and sought sanctuary in Athens. Of the pro-Spartan Boeotian &quot;poleis&quot;, only Orchomenus remained.

By this time, Thebes had also started attacking Phocian &quot;poleis&quot; allied to Sparta. Pelopidas is again mentioned as the commander of the abortive Theban siege of the Phocian city of Elateia (c. 372 BC). In response to the Theban army outside the city&#x27;s walls, the Phocian general Onomarchus brought out all the inhabitants of the city (including the elderly, women, and children) and locked the gates. He then placed the non-combatants directly behind the defenders of Elateia. On seeing this, Pelopidas withdrew his forces, recognizing that the Phocians would fight to the death to protect their loved ones.

By 371 BC, there was another attempt to revive the King&#x27;s Peace to curb the rise of Thebes. It was initiated by either the Athenians or the Persians (perhaps at the prompting of the Spartans). The Spartans also sent a large force led by King Cleombrotus I (Sparta having two kings simultaneously for most of its history) to Phocis, ready to invade Boeotia if the Thebans refused to attend the peace conference or accept its terms.

=== Battle of Leuctra ===
Epaminondas&#x27; refusal to accept the terms of the peace conference of 371 BC excluded Thebes from the peace treaty and provided Sparta with the excuse to declare war.
Shortly thereafter the army of Cleombrotus was ordered to invade Boeotia. Cleombrotus&#x27; army crossed the Phocian-Boeotian border into Chaeronea then halted, perhaps hoping that the Thebans might change their mind. The Thebans however were committed to a fight. Cleombrotus then moved inland, following the eastward road towards Thebes, until he reached the Boeotian village of Leuctra (modern Lefktra, Plataies) near the southwestern end of the Theban plain. There they were met by the main Theban army. The two armies pitched their camps opposite each other on two low ridges respectively. The battleground between them was about wide.

The Spartan army numbered about 10,000 hoplites, 1,000 light infantry, and 1,000 cavalry. However, only about 700 hoplites of the Spartan army were composed of spartiates (Spartan citizens), the rest were conscripted troops from Spartan subject states (the perioeci) forced to fight. They were arrayed traditionally, in which the hoplites were formed into phalanxes about eight to twelve men deep. Cleombrotus positioned himself and the spartiate hoplites (including the elite royal guard of 300 &quot;Hippeis&quot;) in the Spartan right wing, the traditional position of honor in Greek armies. Cleombrotus&#x27; only tactical innovation was the placing of his cavalry in front of his troops.
The Theban army was outnumbered by the Spartans, being composed of only about 6,000 hoplites (including the Sacred Band), 1,500 light infantry, and 1,000 cavalry. Anticipating the standard Spartan tactic of flanking enemy armies with their right wing, Epaminondas concentrated his forces on his own left wing, directly opposite the strongest Spartiate phalanx, led by Cleombrotus. Here, the massed Theban phalanx was arrayed into a highly unconventional depth of fifty men. The rest of the Theban lines were reduced to depths of only four to at most eight men because of this. Epaminondas also copied Cleombrotus by placing his cavalry in front of the Theban lines. The original position of the Sacred Band being led by Pelopidas is unknown. Some military historians believe Epaminondas placed Pelopidas and the Sacred Band behind the main hoplite phalanx, others believe he put it in front of the main hoplite phalanx and behind the cavalry, while others put it on the front left corner of the main hoplite phalanx (the most likely). Either way, the Sacred Band is definitely known to have been on the left wing, close to the main Theban forces and detached enough to be able to maneuver freely.

The battle opened with a cavalry charge by both armies. The Spartan cavalry were quickly defeated by the superior Theban cavalry and were chased back to their own side. Their disorderly retreat disrupted the battle lines of the Spartan heavy infantry and, because of the resulting chaos and the dust stirred up, the Spartans were unable to observe the highly unusual advance of the Theban army until the last moment. Epaminondas had ordered his troops to advance diagonally, such that the left wing of the Theban army (with its concentration of forces) would impact with the right wing of the Spartan army well before the other weaker phalanxes. The furthest right wing of the Theban phalanx was even retreating to make this possible. This is the first recorded instance of the military formation later known as the oblique order. The Theban cavalry also helped by continuing to carry out intermittent attacks along the Spartan battle lines, holding their advance back.

By the time the Spartans realized that something unusual was happening it was already too late. Shortly before the Theban left wing made contact, the Spartans hastily stretched out their right wing in an attempt to outflank and engulf the rapidly approaching Thebans. This was a traditional tactic and, once the Thebans were in range, the stretched wing would then be brought back in an encircling movement. Acting under his own initiative, Pelopidas quickly led the Sacred Band ahead of the Theban left wing to intercept the Spartan maneuver before it could be completed. They succeeded in fixing the Spartans in place until the rest of the Theban heavy infantry finally smashed into the Spartan right wing. The sheer number of Thebans overwhelmed the Spartan right wing quickly. The number of Spartan casualties amounted to about 1,000 dead, among whom were 400 Spartiates and their own king. The Spartan right flank were forced to retreat (after retrieving the body of Cleombrotus). Seeing the Spartiates fleeing in disarray, the Perioeci phalanxes also broke ranks and retreated. Although some Spartans were in favor of resuming the battle in order to recover the bodies of their dead, the allied Perioeci of the Spartan left wing were less than willing to continue fighting (indeed some of them were quite pleased at the turn of events). The remaining &quot;polemarchoi&quot; eventually decided to request a truce, which the Thebans readily granted. The Spartan dead were returned and a &quot;tropaion&quot; was set up on the battlefield by the Thebans to commemorate their victory.

According to Pausanias (c. 2nd century AD), the Battle of Leuctra was the most decisive battle ever fought by Greeks against Greeks. Leuctra established Theban independence from Spartan rule and laid the groundwork for the expansion of Theban power, but possibly also for the eventual supremacy of Philip II of Macedon.

=== Battle of Chaeronea ===

Defeat came at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), the decisive contest in which Philip II of Macedon, with his son Alexander, extinguished Theban hegemony. The battle is the culmination of Philip&#x27;s campaign into central Greece in preparation for a war against Persia. It was fought between the Macedonians and their allies and an alliance of Greek city-states led by Athens and Thebes. Diodorus records that the numbers involved for the two armies were more or less equal, both having around 30,000 men and 2,000 cavalry.

The traditional hoplite infantry was no match for the novel long-speared Macedonian phalanx: the Theban army and its allies broke and fled, but the Sacred Band, although surrounded and overwhelmed, refused to surrender. The Thebans of the Sacred Band held their ground and Plutarch records that all 300 fell where they stood beside their last commander, Theagenes. Their defeat at the battle was a significant victory for Philip, since until then, the Sacred Band was regarded as invincible throughout all of Ancient Greece. Plutarch records that Philip II, on encountering the corpses &quot;heaped one upon another&quot;, understanding who they were, wept and exclaimed,

Though the significance of the battle was well-documented by ancient scholars, there is little surviving information on the deployment of the armies involved. Most modern scholars (including N.G.L. Hammond and George Cawkwell) credit Alexander as having led a cavalry wing. James G. DeVoto, likewise, says in &quot;The Theban Sacred Band&quot; that Alexander had deployed his cavalry behind the Macedonian hoplites, apparently permitting &quot;a Theban break-through in order to effect a cavalry assault while his hoplites regrouped&quot;. Other historians however argue that Alexander actually commanded hoplites armed with sarissas (pikes), rather than cavalry. Plutarch and Diodorus both credit Alexander as being the first to engage the Sacred Band.

=== Trophy of the Battle of Leuctra ===

After the defeat of Cleombrotus&#x27; forces in the Battle of Leuctra, a &quot;tropaion&quot; was set up on the battlefield by the Thebans to commemorate their victory. The &quot;tropaion&quot; was later replaced by a permanent monument, an unprecedented move by the Thebans as &quot;tropaia&quot; were designed to be ephemeral. The original appearance of the monument is attested by contemporary coins of the period and showed that it took the form of a tree trunk mounted upon a cylindrical pedestal carved with metopes, triglyphs, and a series of stone shields. On the tree trunk itself is affixed the shields, weapons, and armor of the defeated Spartans. The base of the monument still survives to this day.

=== Lion of Chaeronea ===

Pausanias in his &quot;Description of Greece&quot; mentions that the Thebans had erected a gigantic statue of a lion near the village of Chaeronea, surmounting the &quot;polyandrion&quot; (, common tomb) of the Thebans killed in battle against Philip. The Greek historian Strabo (c. 64 BC–24 AD) also mentions &quot;tombs of those who fell in the battle&quot; erected at public expense in Chaeronea.

In 1818, a British architect named George Ledwell Taylor spent a summer in Greece with two friends at Livadeia. On June 3, they decided to go horseback riding to the nearby village of Chaeronea using Pausanias&#x27; &quot;Description of Greece&quot; as a guidebook. Two hours away from the village, Taylor&#x27;s horse momentarily stumbled on a piece of marble jutting from the ground. Looking back at the rock, he was struck by its appearance of being sculpted and called for their party to stop. They dismounted and dug at it with their riding-whips, ascertaining that it was indeed sculpture. They enlisted the help of some nearby farmers until they finally uncovered the massive head of a stone lion which they recognized as the same lion mentioned by Pausanias. Parts of the statue had broken off and a good deal of it still remained buried. They immediately reported their discovery when they returned to Athens.

A common story, still often reported to this day, is that the lion was smashed to pieces during the subsequent Greek War of Independence (1821–1829), even using dynamite, by the klepht leader Odysseas Androutsos, who supposedly hoped to find it filled with treasure. This tale was current already in the 1830s, but has been strongly refuted. The five pieces (head, neck, chest, and forelegs) into which the statue was divided for most of the 19th century, before its reconstruction in 1902, bore no evidence of an explosion, but were cleanly cut, likely being the original pieces that formed the statue. Androutsos is held to have been the one to unearth the statue during his tenure as local military governor by Ali Pasha of Yanina in 1819, but the statue had likely fallen apart due to the poor quality of the pedestal&#x27;s material.
Offers in the late 19th century by the British archeologist Cecil Harcourt Smith to fund the restoration of Lion of Chaeronea were initially refused by the Greeks. In 1902, however, permission was granted and the monument was pieced back together with funding by the Order of Chaeronea. The lion, which stands about high, was mounted on a reconstructed pedestal about high.

In the late 19th century, excavations in the area revealed that the monument stood at the edge of a quadrangular enclosure. The skeletons of 254 men laid out in seven rows were found buried within it. A tumulus near the monument was also tentatively identified as the site of the Macedonian &quot;polyandrion&quot; where the Macedonian dead were cremated. Excavation of the tumulus between 1902 and 1903 by the archeologist Georgios Soteriades confirmed this. At the center of the mound, about deep, was a layer of ashes, charred logs, and bones about thick. Recovered among these were vases and coins dated to the 4th century BC. Swords and remarkably long spearheads measuring about were also discovered, which Soteriades identified as the Macedonian sarissas.

The skeletons within the enclosure of the lion monument are generally accepted to be the remains of the Sacred Band, as the number given by Plutarch was probably an approximation. However, historians such as Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière Hammond, Karl Julius Beloch, and Vincenzo Costanzi do not believe that the lion monument marks the location of the Sacred Band dead. Hammond claims it was the place where Philip turned his army around during the Battle of Chaeronea and believes that it contains the members of the Macedonian right flank who perished. He argues that it is highly improbable that the Thebans would be able to commemorate their dead within Philip&#x27;s lifetime with such a massive and obviously expensive monument.

The historian William K. Pritchett criticizes Hammond&#x27;s rationale as &quot;subjective&quot; and counters it with a passage from &quot;Historiarum Philippicarum Libri XLIV&quot; of the 3rd-century AD Roman historian Justin. In addition to Pausanias and Strabo, Justin also clearly says that Philip forced the Thebans to pay for the privilege of burying (not cremating) their dead. Therefore, the cremated remains are likely to be Macedonian, while the remains around the lion were the Sacred Band. Philip, after all, was known for his ability to inflict unnecessary cruelty when it served a greater purpose. He further points out that questioning the honesty of Pausanias is unwarranted, as any well-informed Greek then would probably know the ascription of the monument even centuries after the battle; Pausanias&#x27; knowledge of topography was not second-hand and his testimony was echoed independently by other ancient sources such as Strabo and Justin. Indeed, Pausanias&#x27; &quot;Description of Greece&quot; has proved to be an accurate and important guide to modern archeologists in rediscovering the locations of other ancient Greek monuments and buildings.

== Historicity ==

The historicity of the Sacred Band is largely accepted by historians; it is detailed in the writings of numerous classical authors, especially Plutarch. Noted classical historians such as John Kinloch Anderson and George Cawkwell accept Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Pelopidas&quot;, which contains the most detailed account of the Sacred Band, as a highly reliable account of the events, in contrast to Xenophon&#x27;s patchy treatment of Theban history. Other noted classical scholars like Frank William Walbank and Felix Jacoby have also defended Callisthenes&#x27; descriptions of land battles in the past. Walbank commented that his depictions of the Battle of the Eurymedon, Gaugamela, and Tegyra (all surviving through Plutarch) are quite adequate. While Jacoby, responding to claims that Callisthenes was unreliable in accounts of land battles in contrast to Xenophon, pointed out that Callisthenes did accurately describe the details on the Battle of Tegyra. He summarized his opinion of Callisthenes&#x27; account with &quot;&quot;Sie ist panegyrisch gehalten, aber sachlich nicht unrichtig.&quot; [It is panegyrical, but it is not factually incorrect.]&quot; This is echoed by the historians John Buckler and Hans Beck who conclude that &quot;In sum, Plutarch&#x27;s description of the battle of Tegyra does justice both to the terrain of Polygyra and to the information gleaned from his fourth-century sources. There is nothing implausible or unusual in Plutarch&#x27;s account, and every reason to consider it one of the best of his battle pieces.&quot; They also had the same opinion of his account on Leuctra, dismissing assertions that his accounts were confused or rhetorical.

Historian David D. Leitao, however, has claimed that the group was actually Macedonian, and did not consist of male lovers.

The historian Gordon S. Shrimpton further provides an explanation for Xenophon&#x27;s silence on much of Theban history. He notes that all the surviving contemporary accounts of Thebes during the period of Theban hegemony between 371 and 341 BC were often highly critical; with their failures ridiculed and their accomplishments usually being downplayed or omitted altogether. For instance, the Athenian Isocrates (436–338 BC) in his &quot;Plataicus&quot; (which details the destruction of Plataea by the Thebans), makes no mention of the Theban victory in Leuctra, and harshly reviles Thebes throughout. His later work &quot;Archidamus&quot; mention Leuctra briefly, and only to criticize Thebans as being incompetent and incapable of capitalizing on their rise to power. The same sentiments are echoed by the Athenians Demosthenes (384–322 BC) and Antisthenes (c. 445–365 BC). Xenophon, another Athenian, is the only contemporary who grudgingly notes some Theban accomplishments, and even then, never in-depth and with numerous omissions. His only mentions of Pelopidas and Epaminondas by name, for example, were very brief and shed no light on their previous accomplishments. Indeed, the historians Bruce LaForse and John Buckler have noted that the character and accomplishments of Epaminondas were so unassailable that there is no known hostile account of him in ancient sources. The most unfriendly writers like Xenophon and Isocrates could do was omit his accomplishments in their work altogether.

Shrimpton believes that the apparent indifference of earlier authors was due to the general hatred by other Greeks against the Thebans who had medized (i.e. allied with the Persians) in the second Persian invasion in 480 BC and again in 368 BC. Athenians, in particular, held a special contempt for Thebes due to the latter&#x27;s actions in the Peloponnesian War; as well as the Thebans&#x27; destruction of Plataea in 373 BC, and the invasion of the Athenian-allied Boeotian city of Oropus in 366 BC. Demosthenes records this sentiment very clearly in a disclaimer in his speech &quot;On the Navy&quot; (354 BC): &quot;It is difficult to speak to you about [Thebans], because you have such a hearty dislike of them that you would not care to hear any good of them, even if it were true.&quot;

This sentiment changed in 339 BC, when Thebes abruptly severed its alliance with Philip II (after being convinced by a speech from Demosthenes) and joined the Athenian-led Pan-Hellenic alliance against Macedonia, with the result being the annihilation of the Sacred Band in Chaeronea and the destruction of the city of Thebes itself in 335 BC by the Macedonians. In light of these actions, Athenians eventually changed their opinions on Thebes, now regarding it in a sympathetic light as a fallen ally. It was during this period that much of the accounts favorable to Thebans were at last written. Works by authors like Anaximenes of Lampsacus, Aristoxenus, Callisthenes, Daimachus, Dinarchus, and Ephorus are believed to have been written between 330 and 310 BC. Except for Dinarchus, almost all of them have been lost to history or survive only in fragments. Among them are Ephorus and Callisthenes, who were contemporaries of the Theban hegemony and the Sacred Band. The works of the latter two, however, survived long enough for later authors like Plutarch, Diodorus, and Polyaenus to base their works on.

<doc id="307875" wikidata="Q16363" url="?curid=307875" title="Shoulder">
<text>The human shoulder is made up of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) as well as associated muscles, ligaments and tendons. 

The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints. The shoulder joint, also known as the glenohumeral joint, is the major joint of the shoulder, but can more broadly include the acromioclavicular joint. 

In human anatomy, the shoulder joint comprises the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula, and the head sits in the glenoid cavity. The shoulder is the group of structures in the region of the joint.

The shoulder joint is the main joint of the shoulder. It is a ball and socket joint that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. The joint capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the glenohumeral joint and attaches to the scapula, humerus, and head of the biceps. It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane. The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that surround the shoulder joint and contribute to the shoulder&#x27;s stability. The muscles of the rotator cuff are supraspinatus, subscapularis, infraspinatus, and teres minor. The cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches to the humeral head.

The shoulder must be mobile enough for the wide range actions of the arms and hands, but stable enough to allow for actions such as lifting, pushing, and pulling.

==Structure==
The shoulder consists of a ball-and-socket joint formed by the humerus and scapula and their surrounding structures - ligaments, muscles, tendons - which support the bones and maintain the relationship of one to another. These supporting structures attach to the clavicle, humerus, and scapula, the latter providing the glenoid cavity, acromion and coracoid processes. The main joint of the shoulder is the shoulder joint (or glenohumeral joint), between the humerus and the glenoid process of the scapular. The acromioclavicular joint and sternoclavicular joint also play a role in shoulder movements. White hyaline cartilage on the ends of the bones (called articular cartilage) allows the bones to glide and move on each other, and the joint space is surrounded by a synovial membrane. Around the joint space are muscles - the rotator cuff, which directly surrounds and attaches to the shoulder joint - and other muscles that help provide stability and facilitate movement.

Two filmy sac-like structures called bursae permit smooth gliding between bone, muscle, and tendon. They cushion and protect the rotator cuff from the bony arch of the acromion.

The glenoid labrum is the second kind of cartilage in the shoulder which is distinctly different from the articular cartilage. This cartilage is more fibrous or rigid than the cartilage on the ends of the ball and socket. Also, this cartilage is also found only around the socket where it is attached.

===Joint===

The shoulder joint (also known as the glenohumeral joint) is the main joint of the shoulder. It is a ball and socket joint that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. It is formed by the articulation between the head of the humerus and the lateral scapula (specifically-the glenoid cavity of the scapula). The &quot;ball&quot; of the joint is the rounded, medial anterior surface of the humerus and the &quot;socket&quot; is formed by the glenoid cavity, the dish-shaped portion of the lateral scapula. The shallowness of the cavity and relatively loose connections between the shoulder and the rest of the body allows the arm to have tremendous mobility, at the expense of being much easier to dislocate than most other joints in the body. There is an approximately 4-to-1 disproportion in size between the large head of the humerus and the shallow glenoid cavity.The glenoid cavity is made deeper by the addition of the fibrocartilaginous ring of the glenoid labrum.

The capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the glenohumeral joint and attaches to the scapula, humerus, and head of the biceps. It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane. This capsule is strengthened by the coracohumeral ligament which attaches the coracoid process of the scapula to the greater tubercle of the humerus. There are also three other ligaments attaching the lesser tubercle of the humerus to lateral scapula and are collectively called the glenohumeral ligaments.

The transverse humeral ligament, which passes from the lesser tubercle to the greater tubercle of humerus, covers the intertubercular groove, in which the long head of biceps brachii travels.

===Rotator cuff===

The rotator cuff is an anatomical term given to the group of four muscles and their tendons that act to stabilize the shoulder. These muscles are the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis and that hold the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity during movement. The cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches to the head of the humerus. Together, these keep the humeral head in the glenoid cavity, preventing upward migration of the humeral head caused by the pull of the deltoid muscle at the beginning of arm elevation. The infraspinatus and the teres minor, along with the anterior fibers of the deltoid muscle, are responsible for external rotation of the arm.

The four tendons of these muscles converge to form the rotator cuff tendon. This tendon, along with the articular capsule, the coracohumeral ligament, and the glenohumeral ligament complex, blend into a confluent sheet before insertion into the humeral tuberosities. The infraspinatus and teres minor fuse near their musculotendinous junctions, while the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons join as a sheath that surrounds the biceps tendon at the entrance of the bicipital groove.

===Other muscles===
Muscles from the shoulder region

In addition to the four muscles of the rotator cuff, the deltoid muscle and teres major muscles arise and exist in the shoulder region itself. The deltoid muscle covers the shoulder joint on three sides, arising from the front upper third of the clavicle, the acromion, and the spine of the scapula, and travelling to insert on the deltoid tubercle of the humerus. Contraction of each part of the deltoid assists in different movements of the shoulder - flexion (clavicular part), abduction (middle part) and extension (scapular part). The teres major attaches to the outer part of the back of the scapula, beneath the teres minor, and attaches to the upper part of the humerus. It helps with medial rotation of the humerus.

Muscles from the front

Muscles from the chest wall that contribute to the shoulder are:
Muscles from the back
=== Armpit ===
The armpit () is formed by the space between the muscles of the shoulder. The nerves and blood vessels of the arm travel through the armpit, and it possesses several sets of lymph nodes that are able to be examined. The armpit is formed by the pectoralis major and minor muscles at the front, the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles at the back, the serratus anterior muscle on its inner surface, and the intertubercular groove of the humerus on the outer side.

=== Nerve supply and passage ===

The skin around the shoulder is supplied by C2-C4 (upper), and C7 and T2 (lower area). The brachial plexus emerges as nerve roots from the cervical vertebrae C5-T1. Branches of the plexus, in particular from C5-C6, supply the majority of the muscles of the shoulder.

=== Blood vessels ===
The subclavian artery arises from the brachiocephalic trunk on the right and directly from the aorta from the left. This becomes the axillary artery as it passes beyond the first rib. The axillary artery also supplies blood to the arm, and is one of the major sources of blood to the shoulder region. The other major sources are the transverse cervical artery and the suprascapular artery, both branches of the thyrocervical trunk which itself is a branch of the subclavian artery. The blood vessels form a network (anastamosis) behind the shoulder that helps to supply blood to the arm even when the axillary artery is compromised.
==Function==
The muscles and joints of the shoulder allow it to move through a remarkable range of motion, making it one of the most mobile joints in the human body. The shoulder can abduct, adduct, rotate, be raised in front of and behind the torso and move through a full 360° in the sagittal plane. This tremendous range of motion also makes the shoulder extremely unstable, far more prone to dislocation and injury than other joints

The following describes the terms used for different movements of the shoulder:

==Development==

===Puberty===
Under the influence of testosterone and growth hormone, the shoulders broaden in males during puberty.

==Clinical significance==
The shoulder is the most mobile and potentially unstable joint in the body. Due to this, it is often prone to problems.

=== Fracture ===
Fractures of shoulder bones can include clavicular fractures, scapular fractures, and fractures of the upper humerus.

=== Pain ===
Shoulder problems, including pain, are common and can relate to any of the structures within the shoulder. The primary cause of shoulder pain is a rotator cuff tear. The supraspinatus is most commonly involved in a rotator cuff tear, but other parts of the rotator cuff may also be involved. There are different severities of a rotator cuff tear, which range from a partial tear to a full-thickness tear. A partial tear is when the tendon is thinned, but still connected to the bone. Full-thickness tears can be separated into two classes: a full-thickness incomplete tear or a full-thickness complete tear. The incomplete tear is characterized by having only a portion of the tendon disconnected from the bone, where the complete tear has the tendon completely separated off the bone. For all forms of rotator cuff tears, depending on the severity of the injury, possible treatments include rest, an arm sling, physical therapy, steroid injections, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or surgery.

When this type of cartilage starts to wear out (a process called arthritis), the joint becomes painful and stiff.

===Imaging===
Imaging of the shoulder includes ultrasound, X-ray and MRI, and is guided by the suspected diagnosis and presenting symptoms.

Conventional x-rays and ultrasonography are the primary tools used to confirm a diagnosis of injuries sustained to the rotator cuff. For extended clinical questions, imaging through Magnetic Resonance with or without intraarticular contrast agent is indicated.

Hodler et al. recommend starting scanning with conventional x-rays taken from at least two planes, since this method gives a wide first impression and even has the chance of exposing any frequent shoulder pathologies, i.e., decompensated rotator cuff tears, tendinitis calcarea, dislocations, fractures, usures, and/or osteophytes. Furthermore, x-rays are required for the planning of an optimal CT or MR image.

The conventional invasive arthrography is nowadays being replaced by the non-invasive MRI and ultrasound, and is used as an imaging reserve for patients who are contraindicated for MRI, for example pacemaker-carriers with an unclear and unsure ultrasonography.

====X-ray====
Projectional radiography views of the shoulder include:
;AP-projection 40° posterior oblique after Grashey
The body has to be rotated about 30 to 45 degrees towards the shoulder to be imaged, and the standing or sitting patient lets the arm hang. This method reveals the joint gap and the vertical alignment towards the socket.

;Transaxillary projection
The arm should be abducted 80 to 100 degrees. This method reveals:
* The horizontal alignment of the humerus head in respect to the socket and the lateral clavicle in respect to the acromion
* Lesions of the anterior and posterior socket border, or of the tuberculum minus
* The eventual non-closure of the acromial apophysis
* The coraco-humeral interval

;Y-projection
The lateral contour of the shoulder should be positioned in front of the film in a way that the longitudinal axis of the scapula continues parallel to the path of the rays. This method reveals:
* The horizontal centralization of the humerus head and socket
* The osseous margins of the coraco-acromial arch and hence the supraspinatus outlet canal
* The shape of the acromion

This projection has a low tolerance for errors and, accordingly, needs proper execution. The Y-projection can be traced back to Wijnblath’s 1933 published cavitas-en-face projection.

====Ultrasound====
There are several advantages of ultrasound. It is relatively cheap, does not emit any radiation, is accessible, is capable of visualizing tissue function in real time, and allows the performance of provocative maneuvers in order to replicate the patient’s pain. Those benefits have helped ultrasound become a common initial choice for assessing tendons and soft tissues. Limitations include, for example, the high degree of operator dependence and the inability to define pathologies in bones. One also has to have an extensive anatomical knowledge of the examined region and keep an open mind to normal variations and artifacts created during the scan.

Although musculoskeletal ultrasound training, like medical training in general, is a lifelong process, Kissin &quot;et al.&quot; suggests that rheumatologists who taught themselves how to manipulate ultrasound can use it just as well as international musculo-skeletal ultrasound experts to diagnose common rheumatic conditions.

After the introduction of high-frequency transducers in the mid-1980s, ultrasound has become a conventional tool for taking accurate and precise images of the shoulder to support diagnosis.

Adequate for the examination are high-resolution, high-frequency transducers with a transmission frequency of 5, 7.5, and 10 MHz. To improve the focus on structures close to the skin an additional &quot;water start-up length&quot; is advisable. During the examination the patient is asked to be seated, the affected arm is then adducted and the elbow is bent to 90 degrees. Slow and cautious passive lateral and/or medial rotations have the effect of being able to visualize different sections of the shoulder. In order to also demonstrate those parts which are hidden under the acromion in the neutral position, a maximum medial rotation with hyperextension behind the back is required.

To avoid the different tendon echogenicities caused by different instrument settings, Middleton compared the tendon’s echogenicity with that of the deltoid muscle, which is still lege artis.

Usually the echogenicity compared to the deltoid muscle is homogeneous intensified without dorsal echo extinction. Variability with reduced or intensified echo has also been found in healthy tendons. Bilateral comparison is very helpful when distinguishing and setting boundaries between physiological variants and a possible pathological finding. Degenerative changes at the rotator cuff often are found on both sides of the body. Consequently, unilateral differences rather point to a pathological source and bilateral changes rather to a physiological variation.

In addition, a dynamic examination can help to differentiate between an ultrasound artifact and a real pathology.

To accurately evaluate the echogenicity of an ultrasound, one has to take into account the physical laws of reflection, absorption and dispersion. It is at all times important to acknowledge that the structures in the joint of the shoulder are not aligned in the transversal, coronal or sagittal plane, and that therefore during imaging of the shoulder the transducer head has to be held perpendicularly or parallel to the structures of interest. Otherwise the appearing echogenicity may not be evaluated.

====MRI====
Orthopedics established the MRI early on as the tool of choice for joint- and soft tissue-imaging because of its non-invasiveness, lack of radiation exposure, multi planar slicing possibilities and the high soft tissue contrast.

MRIs can provide joint details to the treating orthopedist, helping them to diagnose and decide the next appropriate therapeutic step.
To examine the shoulder, the patient should lay down with the concerned arm is in lateral rotation. For signal detection it is recommended to use a surface-coil. To find pathologies of the rotator cuff in the basic diagnostic investigation, T2-weighted sequences with fat-suppression or STIR sequences have proven value. In general, the examination should occur in the following three main planes: axial, oblique coronal and sagittal.

Most morphological changes and injuries are sustained to the supraspinatus tendon. Traumatic rotator cuff changes are often located antero-superior, meanwhile degenerative changes more likely are supero-posterior.

Tendons are predominantly composed of dense collagen fiber bundles. Because of their extreme short T2-relaxation time they appear typically signal-weak, respectively, dark. Degenerative changes, inflammations and also partial and complete tears cause loss of the original tendon structure. Fatty deposits, mucous degeneration and hemorrhages lead to an increased intratendinal T1-image. Edema formations, inflammatory changes and ruptures increase the signals in a T2-weighted image.

====MRA====
While using MRI, true lesions at the rotator interval region between the parts of the supraspinatus and subscapularis are all but impossible to distinguish from normal synovium and capsule.

In 1999, Weishaupt D. et al. reached through two readers a significant better visibility of pulley lesions at the rotator interval and the expected location of the reflection pulley of the long biceps and subscapularis tendon on parasagittal (reader1/reader2 sensitivity: 86%/100%; specificity: 90%/70%) and axial (reader1/reader2 sensitivity: 86%/93%; specificity: 90%/80%) MRA images.

When examining the rotator cuff, the MRA has a couple of advantages compared to the native MRI. Through a fat suppressed T2-weighted spin echo, MRA can reproduce an extreme high fat-water-contrast, which helps to detect water-deposits with better damage diagnosis in structurally changed collagen fiber bundles.

==Other animals==
Tetrapod forelimbs are characterised by a high degree of mobility in the shoulder-thorax connection. Lacking a solid skeletal connection between the shoulder girdle and the vertebral column, the forelimb&#x27;s attachment to the trunk is instead mainly controlled by serratus lateralis and levator scapulae. Depending on locomotor style, a bone connects the shoulder girdle to the trunk in some animals; the coracoid bone in reptiles and birds, and the clavicle in primates and bats.

In primates, the shoulder shows characteristics that differ from other mammals, including a well developed clavicle, a dorsally shifted scapula with prominent acromion and spine, and a humerus featuring a straight shaft and a spherical head.

<text>In the oil and gas industry, the term wireline usually refers to the use of multi-conductor, single conductor or slickline cable, or &quot;wireline&quot;, as a conveyance for the acquisition of subsurface petrophysical and geophysical data and the delivery of well construction services such as pipe recovery, perforating, plug setting and well cleaning and fishing. The subsurface geophysical and petrophysical information results in the description and analysis of subsurface geology, reservoir properties and production characteristics.

Associated with this, &quot;wireline logging&quot; is the acquisition and analysis of geophysical and petrophysical data and the provision of related services provided as a function of along-hole depth.

There are four basic types of wireline: multi-conductor, single conductor, slickline and braided line. Other types of wireline include sheathed slickline and fibre-optic lines.

Multi-conductor lines consist of external armor wires wound around a core of typically 4- or 7-conductors. The conductors are bound together in a central core, protected by the outer armor wires. These conductors are used to transmit power to the downhole instrumentation and transmit data (and commands) to and from the surface. Multi-conductor cables are used primarily in open- (and cased-) hole applications. Typically they have diameters from to with suggested working loads from . (Note that wireline diameters and performance characteristics are typically expressed in imperial units.) Multi-conductor cables can be sheathed in smooth polymer coverings but are more commonly open wound cables.

Single-conductor cables are similar in construction to multi-conductor cables but have only one conductor. The diameters are usually much smaller, ranging from to and with suggested working loads of 800 to 7,735 lbf. Because of their size, these cables can be used in pressurized wells making them particularly suited for cased hole logging activities under pressure. They are typically used for well construction activities such as pipe recovery, perforating and plug setting as well as production logging and reservoir production characterization such as production logging, noise logging, pulsed neutron, production fluid sampling and production flow monitoring.

Slickline is a smooth single strand of wireline with diameters ranging form 0.082&quot; to 0.160&quot;. Slickline has no conductor (although there are specialized polymer coated slicklines and tubing encapsulated (TEC) slicklines). They are used for light well construction and well maintenance activities as well as memory reliant subsurface data gathering. Slickline work includes mechanical services such a gauge emplacement and recovery, subsurface valve manipulation, well bore cleaning and fishing.

Braided line has mechanical characteristics similar to mono-conductor wireline, and is used for well construction and maintenance tasks such as heavy duty fishing and well bore cleaning work.

==Slicklines==
Used to place and recover wellbore equipment, such as plugs, gauges and valves, slicklines are single-strand non-electric cables lowered into oil and gas wells from the surface. Slicklines can also be used to adjust valves and sleeves located downhole, as well as repair tubing within the wellbore.

Wrapped around a drum on the back of a truck, the slickline is raised and lowered in the well by reeling in and out the wire hydraulically.

Braided line can contain an inner core of insulated wires which provide power to equipment located at the end of the cable, normally referred to as electric line, and provides a pathway for electrical telemetry for communication between the surface and equipment at the end of the cable.
On the other hand, wirelines are electric cables that transmit data about the well. Consisting of single strands or multi-strands, the wireline is used for both well intervention and formation evaluation operations. In other words, wirelines are useful in gathering data about the well in logging activities, as well as in workover jobs that require data transmittal.

==Wireline logs==

First developed by Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger in 1927, wireline logs measure formation properties in a well through electrical lines of wire. Different from measurement while drilling (MWD) and mud logs, wireline logs are constant downhole measurements sent through the electrical wireline used to help geologists, drillers and engineers make real-time decisions about the reservoir and drilling operations. Wireline instruments can measure a host of petrophysical properties that form the basis of geological and petrophysical analysis of the subsurface. Measurements include self-potential, natural gamma ray, acoustic travel time, formation density, neutron porosity, resistivity and conductivity, nuclear magnetic resonance, borehole imaging, well bore geometry, formation dip and orientation, fluid characteristics such as density and viscosity and formation sampling.

The logging tool, also called a , is located at the end of the wireline. The measurements are made by initially lowering sonde using the wireline to the prescribed depth and then recorded while raising it out of the well. The sonde responses are recorded continuously on the way up creating a so-called &quot;log&quot; of the instrument responses. The tension on the line assures that the depth measurement can be corrected for elastic stretch of the wireline. This elastic stretch correction will change as a function of cable length, tension at surface (called surface tension, Surf.Ten) and at the tool end of the wireline (called cablehead tension, CHT) and the elastic stretch coefficient of the cable. None of these are constants, so the correction has to be adjusted continuously between when starting the logging operation to recovery to the reference point (usually surface, or zero depth point, ZDP).

==Workover operations==

When producing wells require remedial work to sustain, restore or enhance production, this is called workover. Many times, workover operations require production shut-in, but not always.

==Slickline firing head system==

In workover operations, a well-servicing unit is used to winch items in and out of the wellbore. The line used to raise and lower equipment can be braided steel wireline or a single steel slickline. Workover operations conducted can include well clean-up, setting plugs, production logging and perforation through explosives.

==Wireline tools==

Wireline tools are specially designed instruments lowered into a well bore on the end of the wireline cable. They are individually designed to provide any number of particular services, such as evaluation of the rock properties, the location of casing collars, formation pressures, information regarding the pore size or fluid identification and sample recovery. Modern wireline tools can be extremely complicated, and are often engineered to withstand very harsh conditions such as those found in many modern oil, gas, and geothermal wells. Pressures in gas wells can exceed 30,000 psi, while temperatures can exceed 500 deg Fahrenheit in some geothermal wells. Corrosive or carcinogenic gases such as hydrogen sulfide can also occur downhole.

To reduce the amount of time running in the well, several wireline tools are often joined together and run simultaneously in a tool string that can be hundreds of feet long and weigh more than 5000 lbs.

===Natural gamma ray tools===
Natural gamma ray tools are designed to measure gamma radiation in the Earth caused by the disintegration of naturally occurring potassium, uranium, and thorium. Unlike nuclear tools, these natural gamma ray tools emit no radiation. The tools have a radiation sensor, which is usually a scintillation crystal that emits a light pulse proportional to the strength of the gamma ray striking it. This light pulse is then converted to a current pulse by means of a photomultiplier tube (PMT). From the photomultiplier tube, the current pulse goes to the tool&#x27;s electronics for further processing and ultimately to the surface system for recording. The strength of the received gamma rays is dependent on the source emitting gamma rays, the density of the formation, and the distance between the source and the tool detector. The log recorded by this tool is used to identify lithology, estimate shale content, and depth correlation of future logs.

===Nuclear tools===
Nuclear tools measure formation properties through the interaction of reservoir molecules with radiation emitted from the logging tool. The two most common properties measured by nuclear tools are formation porosity and rock density:

Formation porosity is determined by installing a radiation source capable of emitting fast neutrons into the downhole environment. Any pore spaces in the rock are filled with fluid containing hydrogen atoms, which slow the neutrons down to an epithermal or thermal state. This atomic interaction creates gamma rays which are then measured in the tool through dedicated detectors, and interpreted through a calibration to a porosity. A higher number of gamma rays collected at the tool sensor would indicate a larger number of interactions with hydrogen atoms, and thus a larger porosity.

Most open hole nuclear tools utilize double-encapsulated chemical sources.

Density tools use gamma ray radiation to determine the lithology and density of the rock in the downhole environment. Modern density tools utilize a Cs-137 radioactive source to generate gamma rays which interact with the rock strata. Since higher density materials absorb gamma rays much better than lower density materials, a gamma ray detector in the wire line tool is able to accurately determine formation density by measuring the number and associated energy level of returning gamma rays that have interacted with the rock matrix. Density tools usually incorporate an extendable caliper arm, which is used both to press the radioactive source and detectors against the side of the bore and also to measure the exact width of the bore in order to remove the effect of varying bore diameter on the readings.

Some modern nuclear tools use an electronically powered source controlled from the surface to generate neutrons. By emitting neutrons of varying energies, the logging engineer is able to determine formation lithology in fractional percentages.

===Resistivity tools===
In any matrix which has some porosity, the pore spaces will be filled with a fluid of oil, gas (either hydrocarbon or otherwise) or formation water (sometimes referred to as connate water). This fluid will saturate the rock and change its electrical properties. A wireline resistivity tool direct injects current (lateralog-type tools for conductive water-based muds) or induces (induction-type tools for resistive or oil-based muds) an electric current into the surrounding rock and determines the resistivity via Ohm&#x27;s law. The resistivity of the formation is used primarily to identify pay zones containing highly resistive hydrocarbons as opposed to those containing water, which is generally more conductive. It is also useful for determining the location of the oil-water contact in a reservoir. Most wireline tools are able to measure the resistivity at several depths of investigation into the bore hole wall, allowing log analysts to accurately predict the level of fluid invasion from the drilling mud, and thus determine a qualitative measurement of permeability.

Some resistivity tools have many electrodes mounted on several articulated pads, allowing for multiple micro-resistivity measurements. These micro-resistivities have a very shallow depth of investigation, typically in the range of 0.1 to 0.8 inches, making them suitable for borehole imaging. Resistivity imagers are available which operate using induction methods for resistive mud systems (oil base), and direct current methods for conductive mud systems (water based).

===Sonic and ultrasonic tools===
Sonic tools, such as the Baker Hughes XMAC-F1, consist of multiple piezoelectric transducers and receivers mounted on the tool body at fixed distances. The transmitters generate a pattern of sound waves at varying operating frequencies into the down hole formation. The signal path leaves the transmitter, passes through the mud column, travels along the borehole wall and is collected at multiple receivers spaced out along the tool body. The time it takes for the sound wave to travel through the rock is dependent on a number of properties of the existing rock, including formation porosity, lithology, permeability and rock strength. Different types of pressure waves can be generated in specific axis, allowing geoscientists to determine anisotropic stress regimes. This is very important in determining hole stability and aids drilling engineers in planning for future well design.

Sonic tools are also used extensively to evaluate the cement bond between casing and formation in a completed well, primarily by calculating the accentuation of the signal after it as passed through the casing wall (see Cement Bond Tools below).

Ultrasonic tools use a rotating acoustic transducer to map a 360-degree image of the borehole as the logging tool is pulled to surface. This is especially useful for determining small scale bedding and formation dip, as well as identifying drilling artifacts such as spiraling or induced fractures.

===Nuclear magnetic resonance tools===
A measurement of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) properties of hydrogen in the formation. There are two phases to the measurement: polarization and acquisition. First, the hydrogen atoms are aligned in the direction of a static magnetic field (B0). This polarization takes a characteristic time T1. Second, the hydrogen atoms are tipped by a short burst from an oscillating magnetic field that is designed so that they precess in resonance in a plane perpendicular to B0. The frequency of oscillation is the Larmor frequency. The precession of the hydrogen atoms induces a signal in the antenna. The decay of this signal with time is caused by transverse relaxation and is measured by the CPMG pulse sequence. The decay is the sum of different decay times, called T2. The T2 distribution is the basic output of an NMR measurement.

The NMR measurement made by both a laboratory instrument and a logging tool follow the same principles very closely. An important feature of the NMR measurement is the time needed to acquire it. In the laboratory, time presents no difficulty. In a log, there is a trade-off between the time needed for polarization and acquisition, logging speed and frequency of sampling. The longer the polarization and acquisition, the more complete the measurement. However, the longer times require either lower logging speed or less frequent sampling.

===Borehole seismic tools===

===Cased hole electric line tools===

====Cement bond tools====
A cement bond tool, or CBT, is an acoustic tool used to measure the quality of the cement behind the casing. Using a CBT, the bond between the casing and cement as well as the bond between cement and formation can be determined. Using CBT data, a company can troubleshoot problems with the cement sheath if necessary. This tool must be centralized in the well to function properly.

Two of the largest problems found in cement by CBT&#x27;s are channeling and micro-annulus. A micro annulus is the formation of microscopic cracks in the cement sheath. Channeling is where large, contiguous voids in the cement sheath form, typically caused by poor centralization of the casing. Both of these situations can, if necessary, be fixed by remedial electric line work.

A CBT makes its measurements by rapidly pulsing out compressional waves across the well bore and into the pipe, cement, and formation. The compressional pulse originates in a transmitter at the top of the tool, which, when powered up on surface sounds like a rapid clicking sound. The tool typically has two receivers, one three feet away from the receiver, and another at five feet from the transmitter. These receivers record the arrival time of the compressional waves. The information from these receivers are logged as travel times for the three- and five-foot receivers and as a micro-seismogram.

Recent advances in logging technologies have allowed the receivers to measure 360 degrees of cement integrity and can be represented on a log as a radial cement map and as 6-8 individual sector arrival times.

====Casing collar locators====
Casing collar locator tools, or CCL&#x27;s, are among the simplest and most essential in cased hole electric line. CCL&#x27;s are typically used for depth correlation and can be an indicator of line overspeed when logging in heavy fluids. 

A CCL operates on Faraday&#x27;s Law of Induction. Two magnets are separated by a coil of copper wire. As the CCL passes by a casing joint, or collar, the difference in metal thickness across the two magnets induces a current spike in the coil. This current spike is sent uphole and logged as what&#x27;s called a collar kick on the cased hole log.

====Gamma perforating tools====
A cased hole gamma perforator is used to perform mechanical services, such as shooting perforations, setting downhole tubing/casing elements, dumping remedial cement, tracer surveys, etc. Typically, a gamma perforator will have some sort of explosively initiated device attached to it, such as a perforating gun, a setting tool, or a dump bailor. In certain instances, the gamma perforator is used to merely spot objects in the well, as in tubing conveyed perforating operations and tracer surveys.

Gamma perforators operate in much the same way as an open hole natural gamma ray tool. Gamma rays given off from naturally occurring radioactive elements bombard the scintillation detector mounted on the tool. The tool processes the gamma ray counts and sends the data uphole where it processed by a computerized acquisition system, and plotted on a log versus depth. The information is then used to ensure that the depth shown on the log is correct. After that, power can be applied through the tool to set off explosive charges for things like perforating, setting plugs or packers, dumping cement, etc.

====Wireline pressure setting assemblies (WLSPA)====
Setting tools are used to set downhole completion elements such as production packers or bridge plugs. Setting tools typically use the expanding gas energy from a slow-burning explosive charge to drive a hydraulic piston assembly. The assembly is attached to the plug or packer by means of a setting mandrel and a sliding sleeve, which when &quot;stroked&quot; by the piston assembly, effectively squeezes the elastomer elements of the packing element, deforming it sufficiently to wedge it into place in the tubing or casing string. Most completion packers or plugs have a specially designed shear mechanism that release the setting tool from the element allowing it to be retrieved back to surface. The packer/plug, however, remains down hole as a barrier to isolate production zones or permanently plug off a well bore.

====Casing expander tools====
Expansion tools incorporate similar design features to WLSPA, using an internal piston assembly, except the main differences are that the piston is bi-directional, and does not detach to be left downhole. A hardened set of contoured pads expand when the piston is &quot;stroked&quot;, indenting a small circle in the inner wall of the casing, and expanding the overall casing to make full contact with cement, packing material, or directly with the formation wall. The original design and concept of the tool was to stop surface casing pressure without impacting production by leaving hardware in the well bore. They can also be used in other applications like plugging and abandoning or drilling intervention operations like setting whipstocks.

==Additional equipment==

===Cable head===
The cable head is the uppermost portion of the toolstring on any given type of wireline. The cable head is where the conductor wire is made into an electrical connection that can be connected to the rest of the toolstring. Cable heads are typically custom built by the wireline operator for every job and depend greatly on depth, pressure and the type of wellbore fluid.

Electric line weakpoints are also located in the cable head. If the tool is to become stuck in the well, the weak point is where the tool would first separate from the wireline. If the wireline were severed anywhere else along the line, the tool becomes much more difficult to fish.

===Tractors===
Tractors are electrical tools used to push the toolstring into hole, overcoming wireline&#x27;s disadvantage of being gravity dependent. These are used for in highly deviated and horizontal wells where gravity is insufficient, even with roller stem. They push against the side of the wellbore either through the use of wheels or through a wormlike motion.

===Measuring head===

A measuring head is the first piece of equipment the wireline comes into contact with off the drum. The measuring head is composed of several wheels that support the wireline on its way to the winch and they also measure crucial wireline data.

A measuring head records tension, depth, and speed. Current models use optical encoders to derive the revolutions of a wheel with a known circumference, which in turn is used to figure speed and depth. A wheel with a pressure sensor is used to figure tension.

==Wireline apparatus==

For oilfield work, the wireline resides on the surface, wound around a large (3 to 10 feet in diameter) spool. Operators may use a portable spool (on the back of a special truck) or a permanent part of the drilling rig. A motor and drive train turn the spool and raise and lower the equipment into and out of the well – the winch.

==Pressure control during wireline operations==
The pressure control employed during wireline operations is intended to contain pressure originating from the well bore. During open hole electric line operations, the pressure might be the result from a well kicking. During cased hole electric line, this is most likely the result of a well producing at high pressures. Pressure equipment must be rated to well over the expected well pressures. Normal ratings for wireline pressure equipment is 5,000, 10,000, and 15,000 pounds per square inch. Some wells are contained with 20,000 psi and 30,000 psi equipment is in development also.

===Flange===
A flange attaches to the top of the Christmas tree, usually with some sort of adapter for the rest of the pressure control. A metal gasket is placed between the top of the Christmas tree and the flange to keep in well pressures.

===Wireline valve===
A wireline control valve, also called a wireline blow out preventer (BOP), is an enclosed device with one or more rams capable of closing over the wireline in an emergency. A dual wireline valve has two sets of rams and some have the capability of pumping grease in the space between the rams to counterbalance the well pressure.

===Lubricator===
Lubricator is the term used for sections of pressure tested pipe that act to seal in wireline tools during pressurization.
As stated it is a series of pipes that connect and it is what holds the tool string so operators can make runs in and out of the well. It has valves to bleed off pressure so that you can disconnect it from the well and work on tools, etc.

===Pump-in sub===
Pump-in subs (also known as a flow T) allow for the injection of fluid into the pressure control string. Normally these are used for wellsite pressure testing, which is typically performed between every run into the well. They can also be used to bleed off pressure from the string after a run in the well, or to pump in kill fluids to control a wild well.
===Grease injector head===
The grease injector head is the main apparatus for controlling well pressure while running into the hole. The grease head uses a series of very small pipes, called flow tubes, to decrease the pressure head of the well. Grease is injected at high pressure into the bottom portion of the grease head to counteract the remaining well pressure.

===Pack-off===
Pack-off subs utilize hydraulic pressure on a two brass fittings which compress a rubber sealing element to create a seal around the wireline. Pack-offs can be hand pumped or compressed through a motorized pumping unit.
===Line wiper===
A line wiper operates in much the same way as a pack-off sub, except that the rubber element is much softer. Hydraulic pumps exert force on the rubber element until a light pressure is exerted on the wireline, cleaning grease and well fluid off the line in the process.

===Quick test sub===
A quick test sub (QTS) is used when pressure testing the pressure control equipment (PCE) for repetitive operations. The PCE is pressure tested and then broke at the QTS afterward to avoid having to retest the entire string. The PCE is then reconnected at the QTS. The QTS has two O-rings where it was disconnected that can be tested with hydraulic pressure to confirm the PCE can still hold the pressure it was tested to.

===Ball-check valve===
If the wireline were to become severed from the tool, a ball check valve can seal the well off from the surface. During wireline operations, a steel ball sits to the side of a confined area within the grease head while the cable runs in and out of the hole. If the wireline exits that confined area under pressure, the pressure will force the steel ball up towards the hole where the wireline had been. The ball&#x27;s diameter is larger than that of the hole, so the ball effectively seals off pressure to the surface.

===Head catcher===
A head catcher (also called tool catcher) is a device placed at the top of the lubricator section. Should the wireline tools be forced into the top of the lubricator section, the head catcher, which looks like a small &#x27;claw,&#x27; will clamp down on the fishing neck of the tool. This action prevents the tools from falling downhole should the line pull out of the rope socket. Pressure is applied to the head catcher to release the tools.

===Tool trap===
A tool trap has the same purpose as a head catcher in that it prevents the tools from inadvertently dropping down the hole. This device is normally located just above the well control valves, providing protection to these important barriers from a dropped tool. The tool trap has to be functioned Open in order to allow the tools to enter the well, and is normally built to allow tools to be recovered through the tool trap even when it is in the Closed position.

===Quick-connect sub===
A subassembly device that is bolted to the top of the BOP stack that is designed to eliminate traditional bolt-flanges to connect lubricator heads and utilize tapered-wedge and lock ring designs. This allows the same security of traditional pressure control connections but a significant time savings component.

<text>Jabez is a man appearing in the Book of Chronicles. He is implied to be ancestor of the Kings of Judah, although not explicitly included in the lineage. His mother named him Jabez (Hebrew יַעְבֵּץ ), meaning &quot;he makes sorrowful&quot;, because his birth was difficult. Jabez&#x27;s most important action was to conquer new territory with divine sanction.

Although the textual description of Jabez is brief, some Targumim elaborate that Jabez also established a religious institution for the Levite children of Zipporah: &quot;And he was called Jabez, because in his council he instituted a school of 31 disciples; they were called &quot;Tirathim&quot;, because in their hymns their voice was like trumpets; and &quot;Shimaathim&quot;, because in hearing they lifted up their faces, i.e., in prayer; and &quot;Suchathim&quot;, because they were overshadowed by the Spirit of prophecy.&quot;

In Arabic and Persian, Jabez is transliterated as &quot;Yabis&quot; or &quot;Yabiz&quot; ( يَعْبِيصَ ). However, Syriac and Arabic translations use a substantially different transliteration of &quot;ainei&quot; or &quot;aina&quot;, cognate with Hebrew עיני .

Jabez is also mentioned in , possibly as a place name.

<text>Frank Hamilton Cushing (July 22, 1857 in North East Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania – April 10, 1900 in Washington, D.C.) was an American anthropologist and ethnologist. He made pioneering studies of the Zuni Indians of New Mexico by entering into their culture; his work helped establish participant observation as a common anthropological research strategy. In recent years, however, questions have emerged about Cushing&#x27;s activities among the Zuni. Consequently, Frank Cushing&#x27;s work provides an important case study for considering the ethics of both ethnographic research and the generation of museum collections.

==Early life==
Cushing was born in the borough of North East, Pennsylvania. He later moved with his family to Western New York. As a boy he took an interest in the Native American artifacts in the surrounding countryside and taught himself how to knap flint (make arrowheads and such from flint). He published his first scientific paper when he was 17.

After a brief period at Cornell University, where he curated an exhibit of Indian artifacts, Cushing attracted notice from the director of the Smithsonian Institution. At 19 Cushing was appointed curator of the ethnological department of the National Museum in Washington, D.C. There he came to the attention of John Wesley Powell, of the Bureau of Ethnology.

==Work at Zuni==
Cushing was invited by Powell to join the James Stevenson anthropological expedition to New Mexico. The group traveled by rail to the end of the line at Las Vegas, New Mexico, then on to Zuni Pueblo. Fascinated by this culture, Cushing gained permission to stay at the pueblo. He &quot;went native&quot;, living with the Zuni from 1879 to 1884, and becoming anthropology&#x27;s first participant observer. This technique has often been attributed to Bronisław Malinowski, but he did not work with the Trobriand Islanders until more than 30 years following Cushing&#x27;s lengthy stay at Zuni.

After some initial difficulties, Cushing was generally accepted by the community. He was adopted by the Governor of the Pueblo, Patrico Pino (Ba:lawahdiwa), he was given a Zuni name, &quot;Tenatsali&quot;, meaning &quot;medicine flower&quot;, and he was allowed to participate in Zuni activities. In 1881, Cushing was initiated into the warrior society, the Priesthood of the Bow. Yet, there were always factions who disliked and distrusted Cushing. At least once, members of the Zuni community considered killing him as they believed he was after their sacred secrets. Despite his later success and quasi-acceptance, the same charge frequently brought him close to local definitions of witchcraft, a serious violation of Zuni norms.

Cushing often recounted Zuni folk tales and legends. In 1882 he took his Zuni father, Pedro Pino (Lai-iu-ah-tsai-lu), and fellow Bow members on a tour to the Eastern United States to show them his culture. Their journey attracted considerable press attention, as there was great interest in American Indians of the West. Cushing considered the tour part of what he called &quot;the reciprocal method.&quot; He introduced his anthropological subjects to his own culture, just as they had introduced him to theirs (Green 1990:166). He was a century ahead of other practitioners of this process, now called &quot;reflexive anthropology&quot;.

During this tour, Cushing married Emily Tennison of Washington, D.C. His wife and her sister returned with him and his party to Zuni.

Cushing became embroiled in political intrigue after President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1877 signed a bill designating the boundaries of the new Zuni reservation. One section of Zuni territory, called the Nutria Valley, had been left out. Three land speculators, including Major W. F. Tucker, arrived in Zuni in late 1882 to claim the parcel for a cattle ranching operation. The angered Zuni appealed to Cushing for help, and he wrote letters to newspapers in Chicago and Boston in their defense. Major Tucker&#x27;s father-in-law was US Senator John A. Logan from Illinois, who was influential in the Republican Party and would become a vice presidential candidate in 1884. Although the administration of President Chester A. Arthur redefined the Zuni boundaries in 1883 to correct the Nutria Valley omission, the damage to Cushing&#x27;s position had been done.

Senator Logan resented his reputation being tarnished in the &quot;land grab&quot; imbroglio. As U.S. Senator, he threatened director John Wesley Powell of the Bureau of American Ethnology with funding cuts if Cushing&#x27;s stay in Zuni was not terminated. Cushing was forced to return to Washington, ending his landmark efforts among the New Mexico natives.

Cushing returned to Zuni briefly in 1886 as leader of the Hemenway Southwestern Archaeological Expedition. He was forced from this position by personal and health problems. In 1889 he was succeeded as leader by ethnologist J. Walter Fewkes, who had little field experience.

== Professional Controversy ==
Among the forces driving the growth of the Smithsonian Institution at the end of the 19th century was John Wesley Powell&#x27;s belief in the need to document Native American life and to collect Indian materials before the Westward expansion of the United States caused both to disappear. This conviction accounted for the urgency with which the Stevenson expedition, including the inexperienced Frank Cushing, was dispatched to Zuni pueblo in 1879. It is no coincidence that numerous Zuni artifacts, including many sacred objects (some considered living beings by the Zuni), began to be shipped to Washington the same year. By its heyday, the Zuni collection of the Smithsonian&#x27;s Museum of Natural History included some 10,000 pieces, the earliest of which were acquired by the members of the Stevenson expedition. Many (if not most) of these artifacts were collected through less-than-honest means, sometimes including outright theft, and often against the express wishes of Zuni elders and traditionalists.

The Zuni tried Cushing, himself, for stealing sacred artifacts. While he managed to survive his trial, it is certain that Cushing, like other members of the Stevenson expedition and later anthropologists, removed sacred items from the Zuni pueblo. Some of these artifacts joined the Smithsonian collection; others found themselves further afield, in the collections of museums as far away as Germany and the UK.

==Later years==
Because of Cushing&#x27;s work at Zuni, in 1882 Powell assigned the anthropologist to an expedition to the Hopi village of Oraibi. His mission was to council with Oraibi&#x27;s chiefs and get permission to trade goods for a collection of artifacts and crafts for the Smithsonian expedition. The Oraibi Governor approved the visit and trade, but the ultra-conservative Oraibi Traditionalists held special council and refused to trade. The expedition was forced to leave without trading.

Cushing worked with Tichkematse (Cheyenne), who worked at the Smithsonian, to document Plains Indian Sign Language.

Cushing led the Pepper-Hearst Expedition at Key Marco (1895–1897) and studied abandoned villages in the American West. He came into contact with Stewart Culin on the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition and began to work with him to write about the history of games and their role in culture.

Cushing was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1896.

Cushing died suddenly. While on a research project in Maine, he choked on a fishbone. Subsequent hemorrhaging in his throat led to his death on April 10, 1900. He was only 42. Some Zuni have understood Cushing&#x27;s unfortunate and untimely death as spiritual retribution for his handling of secret information and his pilfering of sacred objects.

==Significance of work==
Cushing was an innovator in the development of the anthropological view that all peoples have a culture from which they draw. He was ahead of his time as the first participant observer who entered into and participated in another culture, rather than studying and commenting on it as an outside observer. At the same time, Cushing&#x27;s work also presents a series of ethical dilemmas that must be considered in tracing anthropology&#x27;s relationship to Indigenous people.

The noted artist Thomas Eakins painted him in Zuni costume. John K. Hillers took photographs at Zuni, some showing Cushing as a Bow Priest.

<doc id="307913" wikidata="Q1569753" url="?curid=307913" title="Machzor">
<text>The machzor (, plural machzorim, and , respectively) is the prayer book which is used by Jews on the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Many Jews also make use of specialized &quot;machzorim&quot; on the three pilgrimage festivals of Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot. The &quot;machzor&quot; is a specialized form of the &quot;siddur&quot;, which is generally intended for use in weekday and Shabbat services.

The word &quot;machzor&quot; means &quot;cycle&quot;; the root ח־ז־ר means &quot;to return&quot;. The term &quot;machzor&quot; originally referred to a book containing prayers for the entire year, including weekdays and Shabbat as well as holidays. Later (first in Ashkenazi communities) a distinction developed between the &quot;siddur&quot;, which included weekday and Shabbat prayers, and the &quot;machzor&quot;, which included festival prayers. Nevertheless, the original type of Machzor containing all of the prayers for the year continued to be used (even if less common) at least into the 20th century.

==Origins and peculiarities==
Some of the earliest formal Jewish prayerbooks date from the tenth century; they contain a set order of daily prayers. However, due to the many liturgical differences between the ordinary, day-to-day services and holiday services, the need for a specialized variation of the &quot;siddur&quot; was recognized by some of the earliest rabbinic authorities, and consequently, the first &quot;machzorim&quot; were written incorporating these liturgical variations and additions.

The &quot;machzor&quot; contains not only the basic liturgy, but also many &quot;piyyutim&quot;, which are liturgical poems specific to the holiday for which the &quot;machzor&quot; is intended. Many of the prayers in the &quot;machzor&quot;, including those said daily or weekly on the Sabbath, have special melodies sung only on the holidays. Most &quot;machzorim&quot; contain only text and no musical notation; the melodies, some of which are ancient, have been passed down orally.

==Popular versions==
* &quot;Koren Sacks Machzor Series&quot; – A growing body of Hebrew-English holiday prayer books that fuses the translation and commentary of Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks with the unique design and layout of Koren Publishers Jerusalem. The liturgy includes a modern English translation and features prayers for the State of Israel, Israel&#x27;s Defense Forces, Welfare of the Government and the Safety of the American Military Forces. The Koren Sacks Rosh Hashanah &quot;machzor&quot; was released in 2011 and was named a 2011 National Jewish Book Award finalist by The Jewish Book Council. The Koren Sacks Yom Kippur &quot;machzor&quot; was released in 2012 and the Koren Sacks Pesah &quot;machzor&quot; was released in March 2013. The Jewish Press calls the introduction to the Koren Sacks Pesah &quot;machzor&quot; &quot;a thematic and theological entree to the very essence of Passover.&quot; The vast majority of the piyyutim are contained in an appendix in the back of the volume and are not translated.
* &quot;ArtScroll Machzor&quot; – Very popular &quot;machzor&quot; published by ArtScroll and used both in the Haredi and Modern Orthodox Jewish community. The text has English translations, commentary, scriptural sources, and choreography (when to sit, stand, bow, etc.) Many versions are available. It contains all of the piyyutim of Minhag Polin (except for Selichot of Shacharit, Musaf and Mincha on Yom Kippur), but some of the piyyutim have been moved to an appendix in the back and do not contain translation.
* &quot;Machzor HaShalem: High Holiday Prayerbook&quot; – Edited by Philip Birnbaum. This book only went out of print around 2000, after having been used for more than 50 years, well before Koren, Artscroll, and Harlow. Many congregations still pray according to their existing stock of it, particularly in the Modern Orthodox Jewish community, and for a time in some Conservative/Masorti synagogues. The text has English translations, commentary, scriptural sources. It eliminates the vast majority of the piyyutim for the 3 Festivals, and omits some of the piyyutim for the high holidays.
* Rödelheim machzorim - Edited by Wolf Heidenheim, these machzorim first came out in the early 19th century. They were printed hundreds of times, and they are still used in many Yekkish communities. There are versions of the machzor according to the Western Ashkenazic rite, as well as according to Minhag Polin; the former was also published with an English translation. 
* Goldschmidt-Fraenkel Machzor - This is an &quot;academic&quot; machzor. It includes piyyutim found only in manuscripts, reconstructs customs of Ashkenazic and French communities in the Middle Ages, and contains critical notes and commentaries on all of the piyyutim. The series currently contains 5 volumes for the five major Festivals Additional volumes for the piyyutim of special Shabbatot in preparation by the Goldschimdt/Fraenkel family.
* &quot;Machzor: High Holiday Prayerbook&quot; – Edited by Conservative Rabbi Morris Silverman, this book became the de facto Conservative Jewish &quot;machzor&quot; for 30 years. The text has explanatory notes, meditations, and supplementary readings. It is still in use in some congregations today. Published by the Prayer Book Press.
* &quot;Machzor for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur&quot; – Edited by Jules Harlow, the official &quot;machzor&quot; of Conservative Judaism from the early 1970s until 2009. 816 pages. This text has much less commentary and instruction than other &quot;machzorim&quot; published in the 20th century. The editors focused on the translation, feeling in most places it would be sufficient. It has somewhat fewer poems than other traditional and Conservative &quot;machzorim&quot;. The translations are more poetic and less literal. In 2009 the Rabbinical Assembly and the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism announced a new successor volume, &quot;Machzor Lev Shalem&quot;, intended to replace this edition.
* &quot;Machzor Lev Shalem&quot; – The new official &quot;machzor&quot; of the Conservative movement. This prayerbook presents a complete liturgy, restoring many traditional prayers that had not been included in the Silverman or Harlow editions, yet also offers options to use the creative liturgical developments presenting the theology and gender equality of non-Orthodox Judaism. It contains a variety of commentaries from classical and modern-day rabbis, gender-sensitive translations, and choreography instructions (when to sit, stand, bow, etc.). It offers more literal translations of the prayers than previous non-Orthodox &quot;machzorim&quot;. English transliterations are offered for all prayers and lines recited aloud by the congregation. The page layout surrounds prayers with a variety of English commentaries and readings, as one finds in classical rabbinic commentaries. This book was designed to be used by Conservative, non-denominational and Traditional-Egalitarian synagogues and chavurot, and by leaving out certain texts and choosing the options to be included, it also can be used in Orthodox or Reform congregations.
* &quot;Machzor Hadash&quot; – A &quot;machzor&quot; edited by two Conservative rabbis, Sidney Greenberg and Jonathan D. Levine, using gender-neutral translations; it is used by Conservative, non-denominational and Traditional-Egalitarian synagogues and chavurot.
* &quot;Kol Haneshama: Prayerbook for the Days of Awe&quot;, published by the Reconstructionist Press. This is the official &quot;machzor&quot; of the Reconstructionist movement.
* &quot;Gates of Repentance: The New Union Prayerbook&quot; – The official prayerbook of the Reform movement in Judaism from 1978 to 2015. While significantly smaller and less complete than any of the above books, this prayerbook features a wider range of excerpts and selections from the traditional &quot;machzor&quot; than any other Reform work in the 20th century. It features a rich variety of English commentaries, readings and transliterations. The original version was published in 1978, and a gender-neutral edition was published in 1996. Published by the Central Conference of American Rabbis.
* &quot;Days of Awe&quot; - the High Holy Days prayer book of the UK Movement for Reform Judaism. Its eighth edition was published in 1985 and the first edition in 1840.

<text>This article lists expulsions, refugee crises and other forms of displacement that have affected Jews.

==Timeline==
The following is a list of Jewish expulsions and events that prompted significant streams of Jewish refugees.

===Assyrian captivity===

;733/2 BCE: Tiglath-Pileser III, King of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, sacked the northern Kingdom of Israel and annexed the territory of the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Manasseh in Gilead. People from these tribes were taken captive and resettled in the region of the Khabur River, in Halah, Habor, Hara and Gozan (). Tiglath-Pileser also captured the territory of Naphtali and the city of Janoah in Ephraim, and an Assyrian governor was placed over the region of Naphtali. According to , the population of Naphtali was deported to Assyria. 

;722 BCE: In 722 BCE, Samaria, the capital city of the northern Kingdom of Israel, was taken by Sargon II, who resettled the Israelites in Halah, Habor, Gozan and in the cities of Media (). Sargon recorded the capture of that city thus: &quot;Samaria I looked at, I captured; 27,280 men who dwelt in it I carried away&quot; into Assyria. Some people of the northern tribes were spared, and it has been suggested that many also fled south to Jerusalem.

=== Babylonian captivity ===

;597 BCE: In 598 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire besieged Jerusalem, then capital of the southern Kingdom of Judah. The city fell after a three-month siege, and the new king Jeconiah, who was either 8 or 18, his court and other prominent citizens (including the prophet Ezekiel) and craftsmen, were deported to Babylon. Jehoiakim&#x27;s uncle Zedekiah was appointed king in his place.

; 587/6 BCE: When Zedekiah revolted against Babylonian rule, Nebuchadnezzar responded by invading Judah (). In December 589 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar began another siege of Jerusalem. During the siege, many Jews fled to surrounding Moab, Ammon, Edom and other countries to seek refuge. The city eventually fell after a thirty-month siege, and the Babylonian general Nebuzaradan was sent to complete its destruction. The city was plundered, and Solomon&#x27;s Temple was destroyed. Most of the members of the elite class were taken into captivity in Babylon. The city was razed. Only a few people were permitted to remain and tend to the land ().: In 537 BCE Cyrus the Great, the founding king of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, allowed the Jews to return to Judah and rebuild the Temple.

=== 500–1 BCE ===
;139 BCE: Expulsion from the city of Rome under the accusation of aggressive proselytizing among the Romans.

===1–599 CE===
;19 CE: Expulsion from the city of Rome by Emperor Tiberius together with practitioners of the Egyptian religion.

;38 CE: Jews were expelled from one of their quarters in the city of Alexandria, in Egypt, under the instigation of Aulus Avilius Flaccus.

;41–53 CE: Claudius&#x27; expulsion of Jews from Rome.

;73 CE: The Jewish defeat in the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE) resulted in significant loss of life from battle, famine, and disease, extensive city destruction—including Jerusalem—and widespread forced displacement. Many Jews were enslaved or sent into forced labor in locations such as Egypt and the Isthmus of Corinth, while others were dispersed across the Roman Empire. Young men were coerced into gladiatoral combat, and others were sold into brothels or slavery. As a result, a substantial portion of the Jewish population of Judaea was either expelled or displaced.

;117: The suppression of the Diaspora Revolt (115–117) involved a devastating campaign of ethnic cleansing that resulted in the near-total annihilation and expulsion of Jews from Cyrenaica, Cyprus, and large portions of Egypt. 

;135
: The Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE) had catastrophic effects on the Jewish population in Judaea, resulting in massive loss of life, extensive forced displacements, and widespread enslavement, which left central Judea in a state of desolation. Some scholars describe the Roman suppression of the revolt as constituting an act of genocide. Following the revolt, Jews were expelled from the vicinity of Jerusalem and the districts of Gophna, Herodion, and Aqraba. The revolt triggered a significant migration of Jews from Judea to coastal cities and Galilee. Jewish captives were sold into slavery and dispersed across various parts of the empire, causing a significant influx of new slaves into the market.

;415: After a massacre of Christians by some Jews, Jews were expelled from Alexandria under the leadership of Saint Cyril of Alexandria. Sources differ over whether all Alexandrian Jews were expelled or just the ones involved in the massacre.

;418: Jews expelled from Minorca or asked to convert.

===Sixth to tenth centuries===
;612: Visigothic king Sisebut mandated that every Jew who would refuse for over a year to have himself or his children and servants baptized would be banished from the country and deprived of his possessions.

;629: The entire Jewish population of Galilee massacred or expelled, following the Jewish rebellion against Byzantium.

;13th century: The influential philosopher and logician Ramon Llull (1232–1315) called for expulsion of all Jews who would refuse conversion to Christianity. Some scholars regard Llull&#x27;s as the first comprehensive articulation, in the Christian West, of an expulsionist policy regarding Jews.

;1231: Simon de Montfort expels the Jews of Leicester. 

;1253: On July 23 (Menachem Av 25) the Jews of Vienne, France were expelled by order of Pope Innocent III.

;1294: On June 24 (4th of Tamuz), the Jews of Berne, Switzerland were expelled. &quot;Several Jews were put to death there in consequence of a blood libel&quot;, but a deal involving the Jews paying money reverted the expulsion.

=== 14th century ===
;1360: Jews expelled from Hungary by Louis I of Hungary.

;1392: Jews expelled from Bern, Switzerland. Although between 1408 and 1427 Jews were again residing in the city, the only Jews to appear in Bern subsequently were transients, chiefly physicians and cattle dealers.

=== 15th century ===

;1569: Pope Pius V expels Jews from the papal states, except for Ancona and Rome.

;1593: Pope Clement VIII expels Jews living in all the papal states, except Rome, Avignon and Ancona. Jews are invited to settle in Leghorn, the main port of Tuscany, where they are granted full religious liberty and civil rights, by the Medici family, who want to develop the region into a center of commerce.

;1597: Nine hundred Jews expelled from Milan.

=== 17th century ===

;1614: Fettmilch Uprising: Jews are expelled from Frankfurt, Holy Roman Empire, following the plundering of the Judengasse.

;1791: The tzarina of Russia Catherine the Great institutes the Pale of Settlement, restricting Jews to the western parts of the empire by means of deportation. By the late 19th century, over four million Jews would live in the Pale.

=== 19th century ===
;1862 Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky: Jews expelled by Ulysses S. Grant by General Order No. 11.

;1880–1910s: Pogroms in the Russian Empire: around 2.5 million Jews emigrated from eastern Europe, mostly to the United States.

=== 20th century ===
;1917
: Jews expelled from the area of Jaffa by Ottoman authorities during World War I.

;1933–1957: The Nazi German persecution started with the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses in 1933, reached a first climax during &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in 1938 and culminated in the Holocaust of European Jewry. The 1938 Evian Conference, the 1943 Bermuda Conference and other attempts failed to resolve the problem of Jewish refugees, a fact widely used in Nazi propaganda. A small number of German and Austrian Jewish refugees from Nazism emigrated to Britain, where attitudes were not necessarily positive. Many of the refugees fought for Britain in the Second World War. Already before the Holocaust, by February 1940, the expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany from occupied western Poland also targeted some 20,000 Polish Jews. There was a special institution set up in 1939 to coordinate the expulsion, initially named the Special Staff for the Resettlement of Poles and Jews (&quot;Sonderstab für die Aussiedlung von Polen und Juden&quot;), soon renamed to Office for the Resettlement of Poles and Jews (&quot;Amt für Umsiedlung der Polen und Juden&quot;), and eventually to Central Bureau for Resettlement (&quot;Umwandererzentralstelle&quot;). After the war, central and eastern European Holocaust survivors migrated to the western Allied-controlled part of Europe, as the Jewish society to which most of them belonged did not exist anymore. Often they were lone survivors consumed by the often futile search for other family and friends, and often unwelcome in the towns from which they came. They were known as displaced persons (also known as Sh&#x27;erit ha-Pletah) and placed in displaced persons camps, most of which were by 1951 closed. The last camp Föhrenwald was closed in 1957.

;1940: During World War II, the so-called June Deportation, carried out by the Soviet Union in June and July 1940, as the fourth of five waves of mass deportations of Polish citizens from Soviet-occupied eastern Poland, also targeted some 65,000 Polish Jews who fled from the German-occupied part of Poland. According to the NKVD, Polish Jews accounted for 85% of people deported in the June Deportation. The victims were deported to the Altai Krai, Chelyabinsk Oblast, Irkutsk Oblast, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Novosibirsk Oblast, Omsk Oblast, Sverdlovsk Oblast and Yakutia in Siberia, and Arkhangelsk Oblast, Komi, Mari, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Perm Oblast and Vologda Oblast in European Russia.

;1943–1944: Jews are expelled, their citizenship is stripped from them and they are subjected to pogroms in some Italian cities, including Rome, Verona, Florence, Pisa and Alessandria.

;1947–1972:The Jewish exodus from the Muslim world, in which the combined population of the Jewish communities of the Middle East and North Africa (excluding Israel) was reduced from about 900,000 in 1948 to under 8,000 today, and approximately 600,000 of them became citizens of Israel. The history of the exodus is politicized, given its proposed relevance to a final settlement to the Israeli–Palestinian peace negotiations. When presenting the history, those who view the Jewish exodus as equivalent to the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, such as the Israeli government and NGOs such as JJAC and JIMENA, emphasize &quot;push factors&quot;, such as cases of anti-Jewish violence and forced expulsions, and refer to those affected as &quot;refugees&quot;. Those who argue that the exodus does not equate to the Palestinian exodus emphasize &quot;pull factors&quot;, such as the actions of local Jewish Agency for Israel officials aiming to fulfil the One Million Plan, highlight good relations between the Jewish communities and their country&#x27;s governments, emphasize the impact of other push factors such as the decolonization in the Maghreb and the Suez War and Lavon Affair in Egypt, and argue that many or all of those who left were not refugees.

:Then UNHCR announced in February 1957 and in July 1967, that these Jews who had fled from Arab countries &quot;may be considered prima facie within the mandate of this office,&quot; so according them in international law, as bona fide refugees.

;1947: Egypt passed the Companies&#x27; Law. This law required that no less than 75% of employees of companies in Egypt must be Egyptian citizens. This law strongly affected Jews, as only about 20% of all Jews in Egypt were Egyptian citizens. The rest, although in many cases born in Egypt and living there for generations, did not hold Egyptian citizenship.

;1948: State of Israel established. Antisemitism in Egypt strongly intensified. On May 15, 1948, emergency law was declared, and a royal decree forbade Egyptian citizens to leave the country without a special permit. This was applied to Jews. Hundreds of Jews were arrested and many had their property confiscated. In June through August 1948, bombs were planted in Jewish neighborhoods and Jewish businesses looted. About 250 Jews were killed or wounded by the bombs. Roughly 14,000 Jews left Egypt between 1948 and 1950.

;1949: Jordan occupies and then annexes the West Bank – largely allotted by the 1947 UN Partition of Palestine to an Arab state, proposal rejected by the Arab leadership – and conducts large scale discrimination and persecution of all non-Muslim residents – Jewish, Christian (of many denominations), Druze, Circassian, etc. – and forces Arabisation of all public activity, including schools and public administration.

;1951–1952: During Operation Ezra and Nehemiah, ~120,000 Jews are expelled under the De-Naturalization Act of Iraqi PM Tawfeeq Al-Suwaidi.

;1954: Gamal Abdel Nasser seizes power in Egypt. Nasser immediately arrested many Jews who were tried on various charges, mainly for Zionist and communist activities. Jews were forced to donate large sums of money to the military. Strict supervision of Jewish enterprises was introduced; some were confiscated and others forcibly sold to the government.

;1956: Suez Crisis. Roughly 3,000 Egyptian Jews were interned without charge in four detention camps. The government ordered thousands of Jews to leave the country within a few days, and they were not allowed to sell their property, nor to take any capital with them. The deportees were made to sign statements agreeing not to return to Egypt and transferring their property to the administration of the government. The International Red Cross helped about 8,000 stateless Jews to leave the country, taking most of them to Italy and Greece. Most of the Jews of Port Said (about 100) were smuggled to Israel by Israel agents. The system of deportation continued into 1957. Other Jews left voluntarily, after their livelihoods had been taken from them, until only 8,561 were registered in the 1957 census. The Jewish exodus continued until there were about 3,000 Jews left as of in 1967.

;1962
:Jews flee Algeria as result of FLN violence. The community feared that the proclamation of independence would precipitate a Muslim outburst. By the end of July 1962, 70,000 Jews had left for France and another 5,000 for Israel. It is estimated that some 80% of Algerian Jews settled in France.

;1965
:Situation of Jews in Algeria rapidly deteriorates. By 1969, fewer than 1,000 Jews remain. By the 1990s, the numbers had dwindled to approximately 70.

;1967: Six-Day War. Hundreds of Egyptian Jews arrested, suffering beatings, torture, and abuse. Some were released following intervention by foreign states, especially by Spain, and were permitted to leave the country. Libyan Jews, who numbered approximately 7,000, were subjected to pogroms in which 18 were killed, prompting a mass exodus that left fewer than 100 Jews in Libya.

;1968: Thousands of Jews were forced to leave communist Poland because of &quot;anti-Zionist&quot; campaigns during the 1968 Polish political crisis.
;1970
:Less than 1,000 Jews still lived in Egypt in 1970. They were given permission to leave but without their possessions. As of 1971, only 400 Jews remained in Egypt. As of 2013, only a few dozen Jews remain in Egypt. , there were five in Cairo. As of 2022 the total number of known Egyptian Jews permanently residing in Egypt is three.

;1970–1986: State-sponsored persecution in the Soviet Union prompted hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews, known as Refuseniks because they had been denied official permission to leave, to flee; most went to Israel or to the United States as refugees.
;1972: Idi Amin expels all Israelis from Uganda.
;1984–1985: 10,000 Jews flee Ethiopia as part of Operation Moses and Operation Joshua.
;1991: 14,000 Jews flee Ethiopia as part of Operation Solomon.

=== 21st century ===
;2003:Last Jew left Libya.
;2005:Israeli disengagement from the Gaza Strip forced relocation of 8,000 people from the Gaza strip
;2010:Contact with last two Jews in Somalia was lost.
;2021:Last Jews left Afghanistan.
;2021:The Jewish population of Yemen decreases from 18 to six, and later to five by 2024.

<doc id="307923" wikidata="Q881227" url="?curid=307923" title="Wade Hampton III">
<text>Wade Hampton III (March 28, 1818April 11, 1902) was the scion of one of the richest families in the ante-bellum South, owning thousands of acres of cotton land in South Carolina and Mississippi, as well as thousands of slaves. He became a senior general in the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia during the American Civil War. He also had a career as a leading Democratic politician in state and national affairs.

By 1877, at the end of the Reconstruction era, Hampton was a leader of the Redeemers, White Southerners who successfully fought to restore white supremacy in the state. His campaign for governor was marked by extensive violence by the Red Shirts, a white supremacist paramilitary group that disrupted elections and suppressed Black voters in the state. Hampton was elected governor, serving from 1876 to 1879. After that, he served two terms as U.S. Senator from 1879 to 1891.

==Early life and career==

Wade Hampton III was born in 1818 at 54 Hasell St. in Charleston, South Carolina, the eldest son of &quot;Colonel&quot; Wade Hampton II (1791–1858) and Ann (née Fitzsimmons) Hampton. His mother was from a wealthy family in Charleston. After the War of 1812, his father built a fortune on land speculation in the southern states.

The senior Hampton was an officer of dragoons in the War of 1812 and an aide to General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans. The boy was the grandson of Wade Hampton (1754–1835), lieutenant colonel of cavalry in the American War of Independence, member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and brigadier general in the War of 1812. Wade III&#x27;s uncle by marriage, James Henry Hammond, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, Governor of South Carolina and, in the late 1850s, elected to the United States Senate.

Wade Hampton III grew up in a wealthy planter family, receiving private instruction. He had four younger sisters. His was an active outdoor life; he rode horses and hunted, especially at his family&#x27;s North Carolina summer retreat, High Hampton. All his life he took hunting trips alone into the woods, hunting American black bears with only a knife.

In 1836 Hampton graduated from South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) and was trained for the law, although he never practiced. His father assigned certain plantations to him to manage in South Carolina and Mississippi. The younger man also became active in Democratic state politics.

He was elected to the South Carolina General Assembly in 1852 and was a state Senator from 1858 to 1861. After Hampton&#x27;s father died in 1858, he inherited a vast fortune, plantations, and enslaved people.

==Civil War==
During the Civil War, Hampton served in the Confederate army, resigning from the South Carolina Senate to enlist as a private in the South Carolina Militia. The governor of South Carolina insisted that Hampton accept a colonel&#x27;s commission.
Although he had no military experience, his years of managing plantations and serving in state government were considered signs of leadership. Furthermore wealthy men were commissioned based on social standing and expected to finance military units. Hampton organized &quot;Hampton&#x27;s Legion&quot;, which consisted of six companies of infantry, four companies of cavalry, and one battery of artillery. He paid for all the weapons for the unit. Hampton proved a natural cavalryman—brave, audacious, and a superb horseman. Of officers without previous military experience, he was one of three to achieve the rank of lieutenant general, the others being Nathan Bedford Forrest and Richard Taylor.

Hampton&#x27;s first combat came at the First Battle of Manassas, where he deployed his unit at a decisive moment, reinforcing a Confederate line that was retreating from Buck Hill, giving the brigade of Thomas J. Jackson the time to reach the field and make a defensive stand. A bullet creased Hampton&#x27;s forehead when he led a charge against a U.S. artillery position. It was the first of five wounds he would receive during the war.

During the winter of 1861–62, Hampton&#x27;s Legion was assigned to the command of Gustavus W. Smith. Smith&#x27;s division accompanied the rest of Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia down the Virginia Peninsula to aid in the Siege of Yorktown (1862) before Johnston withdrew to Richmond. On May 23, 1862, Hampton was promoted to brigadier general. At the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31, 1862, he was severely wounded in the foot, but while still under fire, he remained on his horse while the foot was treated. Hampton returned to duty in time to fill in as leader of an infantry brigade for Stonewall Jackson at the end of the Seven Days Battles, although the brigade was not significantly engaged.

After the Peninsula Campaign, General Robert E. Lee reorganized his cavalry forces as a division under the command of J.E.B. Stuart, who selected Hampton as his senior subordinate to command one of two cavalry brigades. Hampton&#x27;s brigade was left in Richmond to observe McClellan&#x27;s withdrawal from the Peninsula, while the rest of the army participated in the Northern Virginia Campaign. Thus, Hampton and his men missed the Second Battle of Manassas, re-joining the army shortly thereafter; but were present on the extreme left of the Confederate line at Sharpsburg. His brigade was selected to participate in Stuart&#x27;s Chambersburg Raid in October 1862, in which Hampton was briefly appointed &quot;military governor&quot; of the town following its surrender to the Confederate cavalry. During the winter of 1862, Hampton led a series of cavalry raids behind enemy lines and captured numerous prisoners and supplies without casualties, earning a commendation from General Lee. In November 1862, he captured 137 men of the 3rd Pennsylvania Cavalry at Hartwood Presbyterian Church.

Hampton was not present at the Battle of Fredericksburg or the Battle of Chancellorsville due to being detached for raids elsewhere.

At the Battle of Brandy Station, the war&#x27;s largest predominantly cavalry battle, Hampton was slightly wounded, and his younger brother Frank was killed. Immediately thereafter, Hampton&#x27;s brigade participated in Stuart&#x27;s raid in Pennsylvania, swinging around the U.S. army and losing contact with Lee. Stuart and Hampton reached the vicinity of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, late on July 2, 1863. While just outside town, Hampton was confronted by a U.S. cavalryman pointing a rifle at him from 200 yards. Hampton charged the soldier before he could fire his rifle, but another soldier blindsided Hampton with a saber cut to the back of his head. On July 3, Hampton led the cavalry attack east of Gettysburg, attempting to disrupt the U.S. rear, but collided with U.S. cavalry. He received two more saber cuts to the front of his head but continued fighting until he was again wounded with shrapnel to the hip. Colonel Laurence S. Baker assumed command of Hampton&#x27;s Brigade after the injury. Hampton was carried back to Virginia in the same ambulance as John Bell Hood. On August 3, 1863, Hampton was promoted to major general and received command of a cavalry division. His wounds from Gettysburg were slow to heal, so he did not return to duty until November.

During the Overland Campaign of 1864, Hampton&#x27;s cavalry fought at the Battle of Todd&#x27;s Tavern during the Battle of the Wilderness. It patrolled the left flank of the Confederate position at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, during which time J.E.B. Stuart was killed at the Battle of Yellow Tavern. Hampton escorted Lee&#x27;s withdrawal to Richmond, fighting at the Battle of North Anna and the Battle of Haw&#x27;s Shop before being detached from Lee&#x27;s army to deal with Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry destroying central Virginia&#x27;s railroad. He distinguished himself further with a victory at the Battle of Trevilian Station, the war&#x27;s largest all-cavalry battle. After his return to Richmond, he fought at the Battle of Nance&#x27;s Shop and was given command of the Cavalry Corps on August 11, 1864. For the rest of the war, Hampton lost no cavalry battles. In September, Hampton conducted what became known as the &quot;Beefsteak Raid&quot;, where his troopers captured over 2400 head of cattle and more than 300 prisoners behind enemy lines.

In October 1864, near Petersburg, Virginia, Hampton sent his son, T. Preston Hampton, a lieutenant serving as one of his aides, to deliver a message. Shortly afterward, Hampton and his other son, Wade IV, rode in the same direction. Before traveling 200 yards, they came across Preston lying on the ground; he was fatally wounded and soon died. As young Wade dismounted, he was also shot but survived.

While Lee&#x27;s army was bottled up in the Siege of Petersburg, in January 1865, Hampton returned to South Carolina to recruit soldiers. He was promoted to lieutenant general on February 14, 1865, but eventually surrendered to the United States along with General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s Army of Tennessee at Bennett Place in Durham, North Carolina. Hampton was reluctant to surrender and nearly got into a personal fight with U.S. Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick (often called &quot;Kill-Cavalry&quot;) at the Bennett Farm.

==Postwar years==
Together with Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early, Hampton became a proponent of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy movement. He worked to justify the Confederacy&#x27;s loss and lamented the loss of his wealthy antebellum life. He embraced the negationist belief that slavery as practiced in the American South was benign and that Black people were racially inferior to White people, but that upper class whites like himself should act in paternalistic fashion. Hampton resented the U.S. government&#x27;s use of United States Colored Troops in occupying forces in South Carolina.
Hampton was offered the nomination for governor in 1865 but refused because he believed Northerners would naturally be suspicious of a former Confederate general seeking political office only months after the end of the Civil War. Hampton campaigned to ask supporters &quot;not&quot; to vote for him in the gubernatorial election. In 1868, he became the chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party central committee. That year, the Radical Republicans won the election.

Hampton essentially ceased most overt political activity until 1876. He helped raise money for legal defense funds after the U.S. government began enforcing anti-Klan legislation of 1870 and 1871 to suppress the Ku Klux Klan&#x27;s violence against freedmen and white Republicans. He was not active in the Klan. Hampton supported Matthew Calbraith Butler in the Union Reform campaign of 1870.
===Redeemers recapture South Carolina===

Other insurgent groups rapidly formed to compound the KKK. In South Carolina and other states, groups of men calling themselves &quot;rifle clubs&quot; formed to act as vigilantes in the years after the war. In 1876, an estimated 20,000 men in South Carolina were members of rifle clubs. Political campaigns were increasingly violent as whites tried to suppress black voting.

Beginning in the mid-1870s, the white supremacist paramilitary group known as the Red Shirts developed chapters in most South Carolina counties. These groups acted as &quot;the military arm of the Democratic Party.&quot; They marched in parades during campaigns, openly disrupted Republican meetings, and worked to suppress black voting in the state by violence and intimidation.

Hampton opposed the Radical Republicans&#x27; Reconstruction era policies in the Southern United States, especially African Americans being allowed to vote and participate in politics. He re-entered South Carolina politics in 1876, running in opposition to those policies. Hampton, a Democrat, ran against the Republican incumbent governor Daniel Henry Chamberlain. The 1876 South Carolina gubernatorial election was the bloodiest in the state&#x27;s history. The Red Shirts used violence in every county to suppress Black voters. &quot;An anti-Reconstruction historian later estimated that 150 Negroes were murdered in South Carolina during the campaign.&quot; Though it seems clear that supporters of Hampton included Red Shirts, prominent Hampton biographer Rod Andrew asserted that there was &quot;no evidence that Hampton himself supported or encouraged that violence.&quot; Indeed, Benjamin Tillman, the undisputed leader of the Red Shirts, would be instrumental in removing Hampton from his Senate seat in 1890.

Both parties claimed victory. For more than six months, two legislatures in the state claimed to be authentic. Eventually, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that Hampton won the election, the first Democratic governor in South Carolina since the end of the Civil War. The national election of Rutherford B. Hayes as President of the United States was settled by a compromise among Democrats, by which the national party agreed to end the Reconstruction era formally. In 1877 Hayes ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Southern United States, essentially leaving whites to reassert control over freedmen.

After the election, Hampton became known as the &quot;Savior of South Carolina&quot;; he was one of those Democrats elected who were called &quot;Redeemers.&quot; He was re-elected in 1878; the Red Shirts gave support, but less violence was required.

Hampton was thrown from a mule while deer hunting two days later and broke his right leg. Several weeks later, his right leg was amputated due to complications from the injury. Despite refusing to announce his candidacy for the Senate, Hampton was elected to the United States Senate by the South Carolina General Assembly on the same day his leg was amputated. He resigned from the governorship to serve two terms in the U.S. Senate until 1891. He was a conservative Bourbon Democrat who appealed to some freedmen in support of his win.

==Later years==
From 1893 to 1897, Hampton served as United States Railroad Commissioner, appointed by President Grover Cleveland.

He was a hereditary member of the South Carolina Society of the Cincinnati.

==Personal life==
In 1838, Hampton married Margaret Preston (1818–1852). Their children were: Wade Hampton IV (1840–1879), Thomas Preston Hampton (1843–1864, killed in the war), Sarah Buchanan Hampton (1845–1886), John Preston Hampton (1846–1847), and Harriet Flud Hampton (1848–1853).

In 1858, Hampton III married Mary Singleton McDuffie (1830–1874). Their children were: George McDuffie Hampton (1859–1917), Mary Singleton &quot;Daisy&quot; Hampton (1861–1934), Alfred Hampton (1863–1942), and Catherine Fisher Hampton (born and died 1867)

Wade Hampton died in Columbia in 1902. He was buried in Trinity Cathedral Churchyard.

==Legacy==

Statues of him were erected in the South Carolina State House building and the United States Capitol. An equestrian statue by Frederick W. Ruckstull was erected on the grounds of the S.C. state capitol in Columbia, in 1906.

In the wake of the June 17, 2015, massacre at the Charleston Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church by white supremacist Dylann Roof, there was a push to remove Confederate symbols in the United States Capitol, including the Hampton statue. Congressional representatives voted to retain the statues.

To honor Hampton for his leadership in the Civil War and the &quot;redemption&quot; of the state from Reconstruction-era reforms, the General Assembly created Hampton County from Beaufort County in 1878. The town of Hampton Courthouse, later shortened to Hampton, was incorporated on December 23, 1879, to serve as the county seat of Hampton County.

Across South Carolina, many towns and cities renamed streets for him. At least eight municipalities in South Carolina have a street named &quot;Wade Hampton&quot; (Beaufort, Charleston, Duncan, Greenville, Greer, Hampton, Taylors, and Walterboro) and approximately 47 towns in the state have streets named &quot;Hampton&quot;. Two high schools in South Carolina are named Wade Hampton High School: in Greenville and in Varnville. A residence hall at Hampton&#x27;s alma mater, the University of South Carolina, was named for him. In July 2021, the university&#x27;s Presidential Commission on University History recommended removing his name from the building.

A Hampton Park was dedicated in Charleston and another in Columbia in his honor. The historic Hampton Heights neighborhood in Spartanburg is named after him. In 1964, Wade Hampton Academy was started in Orangeburg, considered a segregation academy. The school merged with Willington Academy in 1986 to become Orangeburg Preparatory Schools, Inc.

In 1913, Judge John Randolph Tucker named the Wade Hampton Census Area in Alaska to commemorate his father-in-law (it was renamed Kusilvak Census Area in 2015 to remove the blemish of having a place named for a slave-holding Confederate general).

An artillery battery was named after Wade Hampton at Fort Crockett, built on Galveston Island, Texas. The Wade Hampton Battery was one of four coastal artillery batteries and contained two 10-inch guns. During World War II, the SS &quot;Wade Hampton&quot;, a Liberty ship named in honor of the general, was sunk off the coast of Greenland by a German U-boat.

In Greenville County, South Carolina, the section of U.S. Route 29 that connects the city of Greenville to Spartanburg is called Wade Hampton Boulevard. There is also a fire district (Wade Hampton Fire Department) named in his honor placed on the east side of Greenville, adjoining the Greenville city limits, which include Wade Hampton High School.

The Sons of Confederate Veterans awarded Hampton with its Confederate Medal of Honor, created in 1977.

==In fiction==

In Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, Scarlett O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s first husband, Charles Hamilton, serves in Hampton&#x27;s regiment. As it was fashionable (according to Mitchell) to name baby boys after their fathers&#x27; commanding officers, Scarlett&#x27;s son by Charles is named Wade Hampton Hamilton. In the film version of &quot;Gone With The Wind,&quot; the letter sent to Scarlett advising her of Charles&#x27; death is shown to be signed by Hampton.

In the &quot;North and South&quot; trilogy by John Jakes, the character Charles Main serves with Hampton&#x27;s cavalry throughout the Civil War.

Hampton appears in a small role in &quot;How Few Remain&quot;, the first novel in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s &quot;Southern Victory Series,&quot; an alternate history in which the South wins the American Civil War. Later in the series, in the novel &quot;American Empire: Blood and Iron,&quot; Hampton&#x27;s fictional grandson Wade Hampton V appears as President of the Confederate States, assassinated in the first few months of his term by a Freedom Party stalwart.

Hampton is mentioned in Chapter 14, Section V of &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot; by Harper Lee, when Jean Louise&#x27;s Uncle Jack is trying to get her to understand her father Atticus&#x27;s actions regarding the citizens&#x27; committee after the Brown v Board of Education 1954 Supreme Court decision.

The 2021 independent film Hampton&#x27;s Legion presents details of Hampton&#x27;s military activity during the American Civil War.

<doc id="307925" wikidata="Q384121" url="?curid=307925" title="African Methodist Episcopal Church">
<text>The African Methodist Episcopal Church, usually called the AME Church or AME, is a Methodist denomination based in the United States. It adheres to Wesleyan–Arminian theology and has a connexional polity. It cooperates with other Methodist bodies through the World Methodist Council and Wesleyan Holiness Connection.

Though historically a black church and the first independent Protestant denomination to be founded by Black people, the African Methodist Episcopal Church welcomes and has members of all ethnicities.

The AME Church was founded by Richard Allen (1760–1831) in 1816 when he called together five African American congregations of the previously established Methodist Episcopal Church with the hope of escaping the discrimination that was commonplace in society, including some churches. It was among the first denominations in the United States to be founded for this reason (rather than for theological distinctions). Allen, a previously ordained deacon in the Methodist Episcopal Church, was elected by the gathered ministers and ordained as its first bishop in 1816 by the first General Conference of the five churches—extending from the three in the Philadelphia area in Pennsylvania to ones in Delaware and Baltimore, Maryland. The denomination then expanded west and through the South, particularly after the American Civil War (1861–1865). By 1906, the AME had a membership of about half a million, more than the combined predominantly black American denominations—the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in America and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, making it the largest major African-American denomination of the Methodist tradition.

The AME Church currently has 20 districts, each with its own bishop: 13 are based in the United States, mostly in the South, while seven are based in Africa. The global membership of the AME is around 2.5 million members, and it remains one of the largest Methodist denominations in the world.

==Name==
;African: The AME Church was created and organized by people of African descent (most descended from enslaved Africans taken to the Americas) as a response to being officially discriminated against by white congregants in the Methodist Episcopal Church. The church was not founded in Africa, nor is it exclusively for people of African descent. It is open and welcoming to people of all ethnic groups, origins, nationalities, and colors, although its congregations are predominantly made up of black Americans.
;Methodist: The church&#x27;s roots are in the Methodist tradition. Members of St. George&#x27;s Methodist Church left the congregation when faced with racial discrimination, but continued with the Methodist doctrine and the order of worship.
;Episcopal: The AME Church operates under an episcopal form of church government. The denomination leaders are bishops of the church.

==History==
===Origins===
The AME Church worked out of the Free African Society (FAS), which Richard Allen, Absalom Jones, and other free blacks established in Philadelphia in 1787. They left St. George&#x27;s Methodist Episcopal Church because of discrimination. Although Allen and Jones were both accepted as preachers, they were limited to black congregations. In addition, the blacks were made to sit in a separate gallery built in the church when their portion of the congregation increased. These former members of St. George&#x27;s made plans to transform their mutual aid society into an African congregation. Although the group was originally non-denominational, eventually members wanted to affiliate with existing denominations.

Allen led a small group who resolved to remain Methodist. They formed the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1793. In general, they adopted the doctrines and form of government of the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1794 Bethel AME was dedicated with Allen as pastor. To establish Bethel&#x27;s independence, Allen successfully sued in the Pennsylvania courts in 1807 and 1815 for the right of his congregation to exist as an institution independent of white Methodist congregations.

Because black Methodists in other middle Atlantic communities also encountered racism and desired religious autonomy, Allen called them to meet in Philadelphia in 1816 to form a new Wesleyan denomination. Sixteen representatives, from Bethel African Church in Philadelphia and African churches in Baltimore, MD, Wilmington, DE, Attleboro, PA, and Salem, NJ, met to form a church organization or connection under the title of the &quot;African Methodist Episcopal Church&quot;.

===Growth===
It began with eight clergy and five churches, and by 1846 had grown to 176 clergy, 296 churches, and 17,375 members. Safe villages like the Village of Lima, Pennsylvania, were setup with nearby AME churches and in sometimes involved in the Underground Railroad. The 20,000 members in 1856 were located primarily in the North. AME national membership (including probationers and preachers) jumped from 70,000 in 1866 to 207,000 in 1876.

The church also expanded internationally during this period. The British Overseas Territory of Bermuda, 640 miles from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, was settled in 1609 by the Virginia Company and retained close links with Virginia and the Carolinas (with Charleston settled from Bermuda in 1670 under William Sayle) for the next two centuries, with Bermudians playing both sides during the American War of Independence, being the point from which the blockade of southern Atlantic ports was maintained and the Chesapeake Campaign was launched during the American War of 1812, and being the primary port through which European-manufactured weapons and supplies were smuggled into the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Other Bermudians, such as First Sergeant Robert John Simmons of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, fought to end slavery in the United States. Among the numerous residents of the American South with ties to Bermuda was Denmark Vesey, who was brought to South Carolina from Bermuda as a slave before purchasing his freedom. Vesey was a founder of Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church before his execution after conviction in a show trial resulting from white hysteria over an alleged conspiracy for a slave revolt in 1822.

The majority of the population of Bermuda during the first century of settlement was European, with free and enslaved blacks primarily from the Spanish West Indies and Native Americans, primarily from New England (anyone not entirely of European ancestry was counted as &quot;coloured&quot;). As any child of a coloured and a white parent was counted as coloured, the ratio of the white to coloured population shifted during the course of the 18th century (4,850 whites and 3,514 coloured in 1721; but 4,755 whites and 5,425 coloured in 1811). The Church of England was the established church, and was the only church originally permitted to operate in Bermuda. Presbyterians were permitted to have a separate church and to conduct their own services during the 18th century. The Wesleyan Methodists sought to include enslaved blacks and a law was passed by the Parliament of Bermuda in 1800 barring any but Church of England and Presbyterian ministers from preaching. The Methodist Reverend John Stephenson was incarcerated in December, 1800, for six months for preaching to slaves. The law and attitudes changed during the course of the following century, but any church organised by blacks and organising blacks would not be welcomed by the white dominated Government. Stephenson was followed in 1808 by the Reverend Joshua Marsden. There were 136 members of the Society when Marsden left Bermuda in 1812.

&quot;Susette Harriet Lloyd&quot; travelled to Bermuda in company with the Church of England&#x27;s Archdeacon of Bermuda Aubrey Spencer. Her visit lasted two years, and her ‘’Sketches of Bermuda’’ (a collection of letters she had written en route to, and during her stay in, Bermuda, and dedicated to Archdeacon Spencer) was published in 1835, immediately following the 1834 abolition of slavery in Bermuda and the remainder of the British Empire (Bermuda elected to end slavery immediately, becoming the first colony to do so, though all other British colonies except for Antigua availed themselves of an allowance made by the Imperial government enabling them to phase slavery out gradually). Lloyd&#x27;s book gives a rare contemporary account of Bermudian society immediately prior to the abolition of slavery. Among her many observations of the people of Bermuda, Lloyd noted of the coloured population:

Lloyd&#x27;s negative comments on the &quot;dissenters&quot; was in reference to the Wesleyan Methodists. The degree of education of coloured Bermudians would be noted by later visitors, also. Christiana Rounds wrote in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (re-published in an advertising pamphlet by A.L Mellen, the Proprietor of the Hamilton Hotel in 1876):

The foundation stone of a Wesleyan Methodist Chapel was laid in St. George&#x27;s Town on the 8 June 1840, the local Society (by then numbering 37 class leaders, 489 members, and 20 other communicants) having previously occupied a small, increasingly decrepit building that had been damaged beyond use in a storm in 1839. The inscription on the foundation stone included:

The AME First District website records that in the autumn of 1869, &quot;three farsighted Christian men—Benjamin Burchall of St. George’s, William B. Jennings of Devonshire and Charles Roach Ratteray of Somerset—set in motion the wheels that brought African Methodism to&quot; Bermuda. By the latter Nineteenth Century, the law in Bermuda specified that any denomination permitted to operate in the United Kingdom should also be permitted in the colony (although only the Church of England, the Presbyterian Church, and the Wesleyan Methodists were permitted to conduct baptisms, weddings and funerals until after the First World War). As the Imperial Government had ruled that the AME Church could operate in the United Kingdom, the first AME church in Bermuda was erected in 1885 in Hamilton Parish, on the shore of Harrington Sound, and titled St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church (the congregation had begun previously as part of the British Methodist Episcopal Church of Canada). Although the Church of England (since 1978, titled the Anglican Church of Bermuda) remains the largest denomination in Bermuda (15.8%), the AME quickly flourished (accounting for 8.6% of the population today), overtaking the Wesleyan Methodists (2.7% today).

The rise of the Wesleyan-Holiness movement in Methodism influenced the African Methodist Episcopal Church, with Jarena Lee and Amanda Smith preaching the doctrine of entire sanctification throughout pulpits of the connexion.
===Education===
AME put a high premium on education. In the 19th century, the AME Church of Ohio collaborated with the Methodist Episcopal Church, a predominantly white denomination, in sponsoring the second independent historically black college (HBCU), Wilberforce University in Ohio. By 1880, AME operated over 2,000 schools, chiefly in the South, with 155,000 students. For school houses they used church buildings; the ministers and their wives were the teachers; the congregations raised the money to keep schools operating at a time the segregated public schools were starved of funds.

===Bishop Turner===
After the America Civil War, Bishop Henry McNeal Turner (1834–1915) was a major leader of the AME and played a role in Republican Party politics. In 1863 during the American Civil War, Turner was appointed as the first black chaplain in the United States Colored Troops. Afterward, he was appointed to the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau in Georgia. He settled in Macon, Georgia, and was elected to the state legislature in 1868 during Reconstruction. He planted many AME churches in Georgia after the war.

In 1880 he was elected as the first southern bishop of the AME Church after a fierce battle within the denomination. Angered by the Democrats&#x27; regaining power and instituting Jim Crow laws in the late nineteenth century South, Turner was the leader of black nationalism and proposed emigration of blacks to Africa.

===Race===

The African Methodist Episcopal Church has a unique history as it is the first major religious denomination in the western world that developed because of race rather than theological differences. It was the first African-American denomination organized and incorporated in the United States. The church was born in protest against racial discrimination and slavery. This was in keeping with the Methodist Church&#x27;s philosophy, whose founder John Wesley had once called the slave-trade &quot;that execrable sum of all villainies.&quot; In the 19th century, the AME Church of Ohio collaborated with the Methodist Episcopal Church, a predominantly white denomination, in sponsoring the second independent historically black college (HBCU), Wilberforce University in Ohio. Among Wilberforce University&#x27;s early founders was Salmon P. Chase, then-governor of Ohio and the future Secretary of Treasury under President Abraham Lincoln.

Other members of the FAS wanted to affiliate with the Episcopal Church and followed Absalom Jones in doing that. In 1792, they founded the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas, the first Episcopal church in the United States with a founding black congregation. In 1804, Jones was ordained as the first black priest in the Episcopal Church.

While the AME is doctrinally Methodist, clergy, scholars, and lay persons have written works that demonstrate the distinctive racial theology and &quot;praxis&quot; that have come to define this Wesleyan body. In an address to the 1893 World&#x27;s Parliament of Religions, Bishop Benjamin W. Arnett reminded the audience of blacks&#x27; influence in the formation of Christianity. Bishop Benjamin T. Tanner wrote in 1895 in &quot;The Color of Solomon – What?&quot; that biblical scholars wrongly portrayed the son of David as a white man. In the post-civil rights era, theologians James Cone, Cecil W. Cone, and Jacqueline Grant, who came from the AME tradition, criticized Euro-centric Christianity and African-American churches for their shortcomings in resolving the plight of those oppressed by racism, sexism, and economic disadvantage.

== Statistics ==
The World Council of Churches estimates the membership of the AME Church at around 2,510,000; 3,817 pastors, 21 bishops and 7,000 congregations.

==Organization==
===General Conference===

The General Conference is the supreme body of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. It is composed of the bishops, as &quot;ex officio&quot; presidents, according to the rank of election, and an equal number of ministerial and lay delegates, elected by each of the annual conferences and the lay electoral colleges of the annual conferences. Other &quot;ex officio&quot; members are: the general officers, college presidents, deans of theological seminaries; and chaplains in the regular United States Armed Forces. The General Conference meets every four years, but may have extra sessions in certain emergencies.

At the General Conference of the AME Church, notable and renowned speakers have been invited to address the clergy and laity of the congregation. Such as in 2008, the church invited then Senator Barack H. Obama, and in 2012, the church invited then First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama.

===Council of Bishops===

The Council of Bishops is the executive branch of the church. It has the general oversight of the church during the interim between general conferences. The AME Council of Bishops shall meet annually at such time and place as the majority of the council shall determine and also at such other times as may be deemed necessary in the discharging its responsibility as the executive branch of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. This council shall hold at least two public sessions at each annual meeting. At the first, complaints and petitions against a bishop shall be heard, at the second, the decisions of the council shall be made public. All decisions shall be in writing.

===Board of Incorporators===

The Board of Incorporators, also known as the General Board of Trustees, has the supervision, in trust, of all connectional property of the church and is vested with authority to act in behalf of the AME Church wherever necessary.

===General Board===

The AME General Board is in many respects the administrative body and comprises various departmental commissions made up of the respective treasurer/CFO, the secretary/CIO of the AME Church, the treasurer/CFO and the members of the various commissions, and one bishop as presiding officer with the other bishops associating.

==Ecumenism==
The African Methodist Episcopal Church cooperates with other Methodist bodies through the World Methodist Council and Wesleyan Holiness Connection.

In May 2012, the African Methodist Episcopal Church entered into full communion with the racially-integrated United Methodist Church, and the predominantly black/African American members of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, African Union Methodist Protestant Church, Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, and Union American Methodist Episcopal Church, in which these churches agreed to &quot;recognize each other&#x27;s churches, share sacraments, and affirm their clergy and ministries&quot;, bringing a semblance of unity and reconciliation to those church bodies which follow in the footsteps of John and Charles Wesley.

==Doctrine==

The AME motto, &quot;God Our Father, Christ Our Redeemer, Holy Spirit Our Comforter, Humankind Our Family&quot;, reflects the basic beliefs of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.

The basic foundations of the beliefs of the church can be summarized in the Apostles&#x27; Creed, and the 25 Articles of Religion, held in common with other Methodist denominations. The church also observes the official bylaws of the AME Church. The &quot;Doctrine and Discipline of the African Methodist Episcopal Church&quot; is revised at every AME General Conference and published every four years. The AME Church also follows the rule that a minister of the denomination must retire at age 75, with bishops, more specifically, being required to retire upon the general conference nearest their 75th birthday.

=== Social issues ===
The AME Church is active regarding issues of social justice and has invested time in reforming the criminal justice system. The AME Church also opposes &quot;elective abortion&quot;. On women&#x27;s issues, the AME has supported gender equality and, in 2000, first elected a woman to become bishop. 

While always being open to people of all racial backgrounds, the AME has advocated for the civil and human rights of ethnic minorities, such as African Americans, through social improvement, religious autonomy, and political engagement.

The African Methodist Episcopal Church unanimously voted to forbid ministers from blessing same-sex unions in July 2004. The church leaders stated that homosexual activity &quot;clearly contradicts [their] understanding of Scripture&quot; and that the call of the African Methodist Episcopal Church &quot;is to hear the voice of God in our Scriptures&quot;. In the same year, the General Conference voted to &quot;appoint a sexual ethics discernment committee to make recommendations to the denomination about LGBTQ matters.&quot; As of 2015, &quot;the AME Church’s Doctrine and Discipline [had] no explicit policy regarding gay clergy.&quot; Regarding LGBT clergy, in 2003, Bishop Richard Franklin Norris declared his position for his region of the African Methodist Episcopal Church and instructed pastors of the denomination to read it to their congregations:
In 2021, the AME General Conference voted against a motion to allow same-sex marriages in church, but confirmed that &quot;it does not bar LGBTQ individuals from serving as pastors or otherwise leading the denomination.&quot; The same AME General Conference voted &quot;to appoint a sexual ethics discernment committee to make recommendations to the denomination about LGBTQ matters.&quot; In 2024, the AME General Conference voted against allowing same-sex marriage, the vote was 896 to 722; following that vote, the Conference voted to continue the &quot;sexual ethics discernment committee&quot; through 2028.

The AME Church voted to take &quot;a stand against climate change&quot;.

==History==
===Foundation period (1858–1903)===

Itochu started in 1858, shortly after the opening of Japan to foreign trade, when began door-to-door wholesaling of linen in the regions between Osaka and Kyushu. Itoh founded the &quot;Benichu&quot; drapery store in the Honmachi district of Osaka in 1872. This site was renamed &quot;Itoh Honten&quot; in 1884 and became the Itoh Thread and Yarn Store in 1893

In the following year, he traveled as far as Nagasaki via Okayama, Hiroshima, and Shimonoseki. At this time, Japan concluded the Treaty of Amity and Commerce with five countries, namely the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and the Netherlands, opening an era of free trade. The sight of foreigners, battleships, and foreign trading posts astonished Chubei and sparked his curiosity. He became convinced of the limitless potential of commerce.

Chubei opened Benchu, a drapery store at Honmachi 2-chome, Higashi-ku, Osaka, east of Nakahashisuji. Benchu mainly handled linen and fabrics from the Bino and Kanto regions. At that time, the Fushimi-machi area was the center of drapery wholesalers, while Honmachi was attracting many used clothing merchants. Despite this, in selecting the base of his business in Osaka, Chubei Itoh I chose Honmachi, anticipating the future development of the Honmachi area. He is said to have chosen Honmachi because it was accessible by road from Kawaguchi-cho, where boats could dock, and the cost of land was less than a half that in Fushimi-machi. Once Benchu was open, Chubei drew up a charter. In it, he set out his workers&#x27; rights and duties, unique for the time, to ensure that all workers, including junior staff, could work to their utmost capabilities.

Chubei opened Itoh Itomise, a cotton thread wholesale store, at Azuchi-cho 2-chome, Higashi-ku, Osaka. Under Chubei Itoh I, the general manager, the store started with ten workers, including an assistant general manager, manager, and assistant manager. Itoh Itomise adopted a series of management systems that were revolutionary for the times, including the codifying of the sharing of profits by three stakeholders, the introduction of Western-style bookkeeping, and the issuance of Jitsugyo, a monthly business magazine (which became a leading magazine for the fabric industry; with some copies sold to the public).

===Interwar period (1903–1945)===
Chubei Itoh II took over the company following his father&#x27;s death in 1903. The Russo-Japanese War, which began that year, ended with Japan&#x27;s victory. When Chubei II was in charge of Itochu&#x27;s management, the business of the Ito head office was booming due to the victorious boom brought about by the Russo-Japanese War.

When Chubei II took his first steps at the company in the Logistics Department, which was in charge of packing, shipping, and transporting products, he refined himself as a young manager and embarked on reforming the management of the Ito Head Office. In 1908, he integrated the scattered businesses of the Ito family, organized &#x27;Ito Chubei Headquarters&#x27;, and served as its representative. This was an epoch-making organizational reform since Chubei I founded Benichu in Osaka 36 years ago. The headquarters decided management policies for each of the four stores and one factory, and supervised personnel and fund management.

In July 1908, he opened the first Tokyo branch of a Kansai yarn dealer in Ningyocho, Nihonbashi.

The company opened an office in Shanghai in the 1890s and started business in Seoul in 1905, but had severe difficulties with these first overseas forays. He turned his attention to overseas markets from an early stage, making the export department of the Ito head office independent as the Ito export store, and opening branch offices one after another in Shanghai, South Korea, the Philippines, and Manila. Chubei II was infused with the business aspirations and enterprising spirit of Chubei I. He travelled to London in 1910 and began direct procurement and financing for the business in the London markets, which considerably improved its margins, as it had previously used more expensive intermediaries in Japan.

In 1912, Emperor Meiji died and the era was changed to Taisho. In 1913, he established a cotton yarn department, but in July 1914, World War I began, and he experienced a sharp drop in the market prices of raw silk and cotton yarn. Uncertainty about the course of the war caused the Japanese economy to temporarily fall into turmoil, with the stock market, raw silk and cotton yarn trading prices crashing, and bank runs on bank runs.

In 1918, &quot;C. Itoh &amp; Co.&quot; is transformed into a public stock company &quot;C. Itoh &amp; Co., Ltd.&quot; The New York branch office is opened.

Itoh&#x27;s company grew considerably in the wake of World War I, with offices in the United States, India, the Philippines and China, and the firm began to handle machinery, automobiles and metals in addition to its core business of textiles. However, a recession in 1920 left the company deeply in debt, and unlike the major zaibatsu firms of the time, it had no captive bank to finance its business. In 1921, the company split in half, with one half forming what is now known as Marubeni. The company&#x27;s performance improved in the 1930s, but as World War II began in the latter half of the 1930s, all trading companies&#x27; business became increasingly war-oriented.

In 1941, Sanko Kabushiki Kaisha, Ltd. is established by merging of C. Itoh &amp; Co., Marubeni Shoten Ltd., and Kishimoto Shoten Ltd. In 1944, Sanko is merged with Daido Boeki Kaisha, Ltd. and Kureha Cotton Spinning Co., Ltd. to form Daiken Co., Ltd.

===Post-war period (1945–1960)===
In August 1945, Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, and the World War II ended with Japan&#x27;s unconditional surrender and defeat. In the chaos after the war, the company&#x27;s employees working overseas and their families returned to their home country of Japan for about two years from September 1945 to September 1947, whose number reached 1077. The Allied Forces, which occupied Japan at the end of the war, followed the policy of destroying Japan&#x27;s military power and establishing a democratic political and economic system.

In 1946, Daiken Co., Ltd. was designated as a restricted company along with 46 subsidiaries, and was placed under the strict supervision of the Holding Company Liquidation Committee. In 1947, in accordance with the Law for Elimination of Excessive Concentration of Economic Power, Daiken Co., Ltd. decided on a corporate restructuring plan centered on the separation of the manufacturing and trading divisions. It was decided to split into four new companies: ITOCHU Corporation, Marubeni Corporation, and Amagasaki Nail Works, Ltd.

The constituent companies of Daiken were spun off from each other in December 1949 as part of GHQ efforts to dismantle the war-era zaibatsu. Itoh re-listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1950. On December 1, 1949, the company was incorporated. Daiken Co., Ltd., a company created from the merger of trading and manufacturing firms during World War II, separates into C. Itoh &amp; Co., Ltd., Kureha Cotton Spinning Co., Ltd., Marubeni Co., Ltd., and Amagasaki Nail Works, Ltd.

The inflation that had continued since the end of the war was brought under control by the Dodge Line, and from around 1949, Japan accelerated its progress toward a liberal economic system. Itoh resumed business in the wake of the war by bartering Japanese textiles for foreign grain, and resumed trading in petroleum, aircraft, automobiles and machinery to meet UN forces requirements during the Korean War. It was Uichiro Kosuge, president of the company, who led the post-war relaunch of Itochu. The new Itochu established its head office at 2-36 Honmachi, Higashi-ku, Osaka, and began domestic sales and import/export operations in the three fields of textiles, machinery, and general goods.

Since 1950, The Korean War gave further impetus to the Japanese economy, and ITOCHU greatly improved its performance in import and export transactions. In the mid-1950s, ITOCHU&#x27;s transformation into a general trading company progressed rapidly, and against the background of exchange trade and the liberalization of exchange rates of Japanese Yen. The company&#x27;s sales composition, which had a high proportion of textiles, expanded significantly from this time on non-textiles, and the transaction volume accounted for 13% of total sales (fiscal year ended March 1951).

Starting out as a textile trading company, it expanded its business in non-textile fields such as aircraft, automobiles, petroleum, and machinery, and accelerated its progress towards generalization. In March 1950, the company concluded a general sales agency agreement with Roots, a British automobile manufacturer, and it established an aircraft section to respond to the resumption of civil aviation. and moved to acquire import agency rights for foreign aircraft manufacturers in 1952. As for oil, the company took dynamic measures one after another, such as becoming an agent for Standard Oil, a major US oil company, and participating in the management of Nichibei Oil.

There was also a quick response to internationalization. In 1951, the New York office was established, and a local subsidiary, Itochu America Inc. was established in 1952to prepare for the expansion of trade with the United States. Subsequently, the company name was raised high in various parts of the world, such as London, Mexico in 1953, Hamburg in 1954, Hong Kong, and Bangkok in 1955.

After the war, Itoh absorbed many smaller trading operations that could no longer stand on their own. Itoh expanded its overseas mining and petroleum exploration activity in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

In 1957, The Company completes construction of a new Tokyo Branch Office building (at 2-chome, Nihonbashi Honcho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo), and, later in 1967, The Company renames the Tokyo Branch Office the Tokyo Head Office, to join the Osaka Head Office in a dual head-office structure.

===Japan&#x27;s economic growth period (1960–1980)===
After gaining support from the United States and achieving domestic economic reform, Japan&#x27;s economy was able to soar from the 1950s to the 1970s. After the first oil-price shock struck Japan (1973 oil crisis), the country&#x27;s economy has entered a steady increasing stage till 1990&#x27;. (Refer to Japanese economic miracle) The company also entered a growth period in the 1970s.

The company&#x27;s long-held vision of “Enhancing non-textile businesses - Diversification” was finally realized, and it rapidly expanded operations as a general trading company. In 1972 Itoh became the first Japanese trading company allowed to do business in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It publicly announced that it would comply with the “Four Japan-China trading conditions” on December 14, 1971, and then established a section within the company dedicated to China and began initiatives to actively promote trade. When a mission led by then President Mr. Echigo visited China in March 1972, ITOCHU was officially recognized as a friendly trading company by the Chinese government, and continued to play significant roles in promoting friendship and trade between Japan and China. Soon after this appointment, on September 29, 1972, Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka achieved a normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

In the 1970s, the company became part of the &quot;Kawasaki Group&quot; within the keiretsu of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (now Mizuho Corporate Bank), eventually displacing Nissho Iwai as the keiretsu&#x27;s dominant trading company. Itoh&#x27;s affiliation with the keiretsu was significantly looser than other keiretsu-affiliated trading companies, and many firms within the DKB group did not use Itoh&#x27;s services at all.

Former Imperial Japanese Army staff officer Ryuzo Sejima joined Itoh in 1958 after spending 11 years in a Siberian prison. Four years later, he was promoted to director and became Itoh&#x27;s head of corporate planning, implementing a military-style internal reporting system. He went on to serve as president and chairman of the company, having developed a powerful group of followers known as the &quot;Sejima Machine.&quot;

In 1970, Sejima and his younger protege Minoru Murofushi arranged a joint venture between General Motors and Isuzu, one of the first tie-ups between US and Japanese automakers. In 1971, the company successfully assisted in arranging a basic contract for cooperation between General Motors of the United States and Isuzu of Japan. The first investment of GM taking a 34% stake in Isuzu was seen in 1972, when the Chevrolet LUV became the first Isuzu-built vehicle to be sold in the United States. While the company had a long relationship with GM going back to the 1920s, Isuzu introduced the Gemini in 1974 which was co-produced with General Motors as the T-body Chevrolet Chevette. A modified version was sold in the United States as Buick&#x27;s Opel by Isuzu, and in Australia as the Holden Gemini. As a result of the collaboration, certain American GM products were sold to Japanese customers through Isuzu dealerships. The company assisted Isuzu to export also increased considerably as a result of being able to use GM networks, from 0.7% of production in 1973 to 35.2% by 1976; this while overall production increased more than fourfold in the same period.

Itoh absorbed Ataka &amp; Co., the ninth largest general trading company in Japan, in 1977. Ataka had recently suffered major losses from an oil development project in the United States and had undergone restructuring at the direction of its main lender, Sumitomo Bank.

From the early 1970s Itoh was a major supplier of synthetic yarn (polyester) to India&#x27;s Reliance Industries Limited. Over the years, the close collaboration between both companies culminated in the co-promotion of a world-scale Polypropylene Project with a capacity of 250,000 tonnes per annum at a total project cost of Rs. 525 Crores, at Hazira in the State of Gujarat. With a $50 million cost for a 15 percent stake, it was at that point, the largest investment in India by a Japanese firm. Itoh also marketed products—under their own label—as diverse as a line of bicycles (mostly manufactured by Bridgestone), and computer printers. Itochu began to develop a strong information technology business in the 1980s through its subsidiary C. Itoh Techno-Science (CTC), which acted as a Japan distributor for Sun Microsystems, Cisco, Oracle and others.

===Economic recession period (1990–2000)===
After the economic miracle and consequent asset price bubble the country experienced a recession period the lost decade. Trying to deflate speculation and keep inflation in check, the Bank of Japan sharply raised inter-bank lending rates in late 1989. This sharp policy caused the bursting of the bubble, and the Japanese stock market crashed. In the two decades starting from such period, the company experienced the challenges and restructured its portfolio.

On October 1, 1992, C. Itoh &amp; Co. Ltd. changed its English name to Itochu Corporation, a more direct transliteration of its Japanese name. By the early 1990s Itochu had become the largest trading company in Japan, but losses from the Japanese asset price bubble, particularly domestic real estate investments, brought it down to third place by the middle of the decade. In the 1990s, Itochu made several investments in the media industry, including a minority stake in Time Warner and investments in cable and satellite delivery systems.

In 1997, the company introduced &quot;Division Company&quot; system, which is to till today. With ITOCHU&#x27;s operations in Japan and overseas becoming more diversified and the management environment changing very quickly, the Company recognized that it needed to adopt a more autonomous management approach, enabling greater agility by delegating authority and responsibility to its divisions. The concept of developing a “Division Company” system was created. Consequently, an examination committee was set up in 1995 and the system was adopted in FY1997. The main purposes of the system were, first, to create an optimal management system with independent management by the Division Companies (to create a system geared to the characteristics of the Companies, enable prompt decision making through a bold decentralization of authority, and build a more sophisticated management system based on consolidated performance and balance sheets); second, to establish a small and efficient head office; and third, to achieve the minimum control required in line with the decentralization of authority. By adopting this new approach, ITOCHU sought to strengthen its performance and operations, while bolstering its earnings. ITOCHU becomes the first sogo shosha to receive environmental certificate ISO14001.

Uichirō Niwa became president of Itochu in 1998, implementing cuts to unprofitable businesses and cutting back executive perks enjoyed by his predecessor Murofushi. In 1999, Itochu became one of the first Japanese companies to move away from the traditional seniority-based pay scale, adopting a base pay scale based on responsibilities, impact and value of each position as well as a performance-linked bonus system. Itochu also spun off CTC in 1999, only to see CTC quickly achieve a market capitalization more than twice that of its former parent company.

In 2001, ITOCHU Corporation and Marubeni Corporation spin off and merge their respective steel divisions, launching Marubeni-Itochu Steel Inc. (MISI). At the period, both ITOCHU and Marubeni have been experiencing excessive competition in the domestic market of steel and metal products and the two entities who share the same history routes filed the dialogues towards merging the similar operations into MISI.

===Period under current management (2010–present)===
Masahiro Okafuji became president of Itochu in 2010 and announced a strategy to make Itochu the first-ranked &quot;sogo shosha&quot; in areas other than raw resources, particularly in food products and machinery. Under Okafuji&#x27;s leadership, Itochu has led its way to be one of the most profitable &quot;sogo shosha.&quot; He remained as the president till he was appointed as Chairman-CEO in 2018.

In 2011, Itochu moved its Osaka headquarters to the North Gate Building adjacent to Osaka Station.

In 2013, Itochu implemented a general ban on work after 8 PM with an across-the-board &quot;lights out&quot; policy at 10 PM while encouraging that any necessary overtime be taken in the early morning hours, reducing the total amount of overtime across the company.

In 2014, Itochu entered into a cross-shareholding partnership with the Thai conglomerate Charoen Pokphand (CP), and together with CP, agreed to invest over $8 billion in the Chinese state-owned conglomerate CITIC Limited during 2015, the largest investment ever made by a Japanese general trading company. The transaction was also the largest acquisition in China by a Japanese company, and the largest investment by foreigners in a Chinese state-owned enterprise.

In March 2016, Itochu recorded JPY 352.2 bil in PAT in the fiscal year which ranked itself as the most profitable &quot;sogo shosha&quot; for its first time. The natural resources commodity price was decreased during the fiscal year ended in March 2016, which made its competitors Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd fell in profits. In July 2016, an American short seller Glaucus Research Group published a report critical of Itochu&#x27;s accounting practices, causing a stock price dip of around 10%.In May 2017, Itochu acquired 10.1% share of Yanase which is an importer distributor of automobiles such as Mercedes-Benz, through TOB, which made Itochu to be 50.1% shareholder. Itochu participated in its equity earlier in 2003, and acquired further share to be a 66% shareholder in 2018.

In August 2018, Itochu acquired 8.6% share of FamilyMart which is Japan&#x27;s second largest convenience store chain behind 7-Eleven, through TOB, which made Itochu the 50.1% shareholder. Itochu participated in its equity earlier in 1998, and, after merging other competitors including CircleK, acquired further share to be a 95% shareholder in 2021.
In 2019 and 2020, Itochu was ranked the most popular employer for newly minted Japanese university graduates. Itochu has remained one of the most popular employers for graduates of top Japanese universities since the 1990s due to their high compensation levels, employment stability and the diversity of opportunities available to prospective employees.

In September 2020, Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway announced that it had acquired over 5% of the stock in the company, along with four other Japanese trading houses, over the 12-month period ending in August 2020. By April 2023, Berkshire increased the stake to 7.4%.

In March 2021, Itochu ended its fiscal year by becoming the most profitable (recording JPY 401.4 bil in PAT) and the most valued (recording JPY 5,685 bil in market capitalization) &quot;sogo shosha&quot; in Japan.

On 5 February 2024, Itochu Chief Financial Officer Tsuyoshi Hachimura, announced that the company was to end its partnership with the Israeli military technology company Elbit after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel the prior month to prevent alleged acts of genocide against Palestinians and to do more to help the region&#x27;s civilians. It also purchased Big Motor following a series of scandals, finalising the transaction on 1 May.

<doc id="307927" wikidata="Q1094813" url="?curid=307927" title="Pochette (musical instrument)">
<text>The pochette is a small stringed instrument of the bowed variety. It is a small violin-like instrument designed to fit in a pocket, hence the name &quot;pochette&quot; (French for &quot;small pocket&quot;).

Also known as a pocket fiddle, it was designed to be used by dance masters in royal courts and noble households, and by street musicians, from about the 15th century until around the 19th century, becoming especially popular in the 1800s. Prior, the rebec was used in a similar way, and some modern pochettes descend from the rebec instead of the violin family.

A common misconception is that pochettes were intended for children, when in fact they were conceived for adults; their small size allowed them to be used where the larger violins were too cumbersome to carry, or too expensive to own. The instrument&#x27;s body is very small, but its fingerboard is long relative to the instrument&#x27;s overall size, to preserve as much of the instrument&#x27;s melodic range as possible. Pochettes come in many shapes, with the narrow boat-shaped ones called &quot;sardinos&quot; being one of the most common, along with the pear-shaped type. A pochette shaped like a violin is called a &quot;kit violin&quot; or just &quot;kit&quot;.

==Etymology==
Trichet is said to have described the pochette&#x27;s leather carrying case as a &quot;poche&quot;. Similarly, Mersenne wrote that it was common practice among pochette players (such as traveling minstrels or dance teachers) to carry the instrument in a pocket. The word &quot;kit&quot; possibly arose from an abbreviation of the word &quot;pocket&quot; to &quot;-cket&quot; and subsequently &quot;kit&quot;; alternatively, it may be a corruption of &quot;cittern&quot; (). The word &quot;Kit&quot; is believed to have first been used in the first quarter of the 16th century England where it was mentioned in &quot;Interlude of the Four Elements&quot;, 1517. It is possible that the word &quot;kit&quot; originally referred to a small rebec, which was used in the same manner at the time in England, but came to belong to the violin-shaped pochettes later on as it replaced the rebec.

==History==
Many fiddlers in the 18th century used pochettes because of their portability. The pochette or pocket fiddle was used by dance masters not only during dances, but when teaching as well.

The great luthier Antonio Stradivari is known to have made a few pochettes in his career; two are known to have survived to modern times, one possibly in bad shape, and the other on display at the Conservatoire de Paris Museum.

==Sound==
The pochette tends to be tuned one octave above a violin. The three-string variant specifically tends to be tuned the highest.

Claudio Monteverdi used the &quot;chirp&quot; sound of the pochette to infer bird song in his aria &quot;Ecco pur ch&#x27;a voi ritorno&quot; from the 1607 opera &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;. In the opera they are called &quot;violini piccoli alla francese&quot; (&quot;small French violins&quot;).

The Fellowship of Makers and Restorers of Historical Instruments has expressed that even with a sound post a violin cannot imitate the sound of a pochette enough for the two to be considered the same.

==Notable players==
* Niel Gow is known to have played a pochette, and reportedly carried one in his pocket whenever he walked from his house in Inver to Blair Castle, where he worked.
* Thomas Jefferson owned at least two pochettes.

==Design==
Due to being an essential feature of court entertainment and dance, pochettes were often made of expensive materials such as exotic woods, tortoise shells or ivory, as well as being decorated with elaborate carvings.

A pochette shaped like a boat is called a &quot;sardino&quot; (or &quot;Tanzmeistergeige&quot; in Germany), while a violin-shaped one is called a &quot;kit&quot;.

In general pochettes have a narrower body and longer neck in overall relation to its size compared to other bowed string instruments. They often lack frets and have either four or three strings. They also often have a distinctly vaulted and arched back. A pochette is distinguishable from the rest of the violin family due to the fact that the neck is a prolongation of the body, instead of simply being attached to it.

The Fellowship of Makers and Restorers of Historical Instruments has expressed that a pochette&#x27;s strings ought not to be longer than .

==Playing==
Due to their small size, pochettes cannot be played resting on the chin or shoulder like a violin, and are instead pressed against the chest or along the upper arm, being played with a short bow.

<text>A violin concerto is a concerto for solo violin (occasionally, two or more violins) and instrumental ensemble (customarily orchestra). Such works have been written since the Baroque period, when the solo concerto form was first developed, up through the present day. Many major composers have contributed to the violin concerto repertoire. 

Traditionally a three-movement work, the violin concerto has been structured in four movements by a number of modern composers, including Dmitri Shostakovich, Igor Stravinsky, and Alban Berg. In some violin concertos, especially from the Baroque and modern eras, the violin (or group of violins) is accompanied by a chamber ensemble rather than an orchestra—for instance, in Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;estro armonico&quot;, originally scored for four violins, two violas, cello, and continuo, and in Allan Pettersson&#x27;s first concerto, for violin and string quartet.

<text>Kāfiristān, or Kāfirstān (; Persian: کافرستان; ), is a historical region that covered present-day Nuristan Province in Afghanistan and its surroundings. This historic region lies on, and mainly comprises, the basins of the rivers Alingar, Pech (Kamah), Landai Sin river and Kunar, and the intervening mountain ranges. It is bounded by the main range of the Hindu Kush on the north, Pakistan&#x27;s Chitral District to the east, the Kunar Valley in the south and the Alishang River in the west.

Kafiristan took its name from the enduring kafir (non-Muslim) Nuristani inhabitants who once followed a distinct form of ancient Hinduism mixed with locally developed accretions; they were thus known to the surrounding predominantly Sunni Muslim population as Kafirs, meaning &quot;disbelievers&quot; or &quot;infidels&quot;. They are closely related to the Kalash people, an independent people with a distinctive culture, language and religion.

The area extending from modern Nooristan to Kashmir was known as &quot;Peristan&quot;, a vast area containing a host of &quot;Kafir&quot; cultures and Indo-European languages that became Islamized over a long period of time, which eventually led them to become Muslim on the orders of Emir Abdur Rahman Khan who conquered the territory in 1895–96. The region was earlier surrounded by Buddhist states that temporarily brought literacy and state rule to the mountains; the decline of Buddhism heavily isolated the region. It was surrounded by Muslim states in the 16th century.

==Etymology==
&quot;Kafiristan&quot; or &quot;Kafirstan&quot; is normally taken to mean &quot;land [&quot;-stan&quot;] of the kafirs&quot; in the Persian language, where the name &#x27; is derived from the Arabic &#x27;, literally meaning a person who refuses to accept a principle of any nature and figuratively as a person refusing to accept Islam as his faith; it is commonly translated into English as a &quot;non-believer&quot;. However, the influence from district names in Kafiristan of Katwar or Kator and the ethnic name Kati has also been suggested. Kafiristan was inhabited by people who followed a form of Paganism before their conversion to Islam in 1895–1896.

==History of Kafiristan==

===Ancient history===
Ancient Kapiśa &quot;janapada&quot;, located south-east of the Hindukush, included and is related to Kafiristan. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang who visited Kapisa in 644 AD calls it &quot;Kai-pi-shi(h)&quot; (迦畢試; standard Chinese: &quot;Jiābìshì&quot; &lt; Middle Chinese ZS: *&quot;kɨɑ-piɪt̚-ɕɨH&quot;). Xuanzang describes &quot;Kai-pi-shi&quot; as a flourishing kingdom ruled by a Buddhist &quot;kshatriya&quot; king holding sway over ten neighbouring states, including Lampaka, Nagarahara, Gandhara and Bannu. Until the 9th century AD, Kapiśi remained the second capital of the Shahi dynasty of Kabul. Kapiśa was known for goats and their skin. Xuanzang talks of &quot;Shen&quot; breed of horses from Kapiśa (&quot;Kai-pi-shi&quot;). There is also a reference to Chinese emperor Taizong being presented with an excellent breed of horses in 637 AD by an envoy from Chi-pin (Kapisa). Further evidence from Xuanzang shows that Kai-pi-shi produced a variety of cereals, many kinds of fruits, and a scented root called &quot;yu-kin&quot;, probably of the grass khus, or vetiver. The people used woollen and fur clothes; also gold, silver and copper coins. Objects of merchandise from all parts were found here.

===Medieval history===
The area extending from modern Nooristan to Kashmir was known as &quot;Peristan&quot;, a vast area containing a host of &quot;Kafir&quot; cultures and Indo-European languages that became Islamized over a long period. Earlier, it was surrounded by Buddhist states and societies which temporarily extended literacy and state rule to the region. The journey to the region was perilous according to reports of Chinese pilgrims Faxian and Song Yun. The decline of Buddhism resulted in the region becoming heavily isolated. The Islamization of the nearby Badakhshan began in the 8th century and Peristan was surrounded by Muslim states in the 16th century. The Kalash people of lower Chitral are the last surviving heirs of the area.

===Ghaznavids era===
===Early modern and later history===

The first European recorded as having visited Kafiristan was the Portuguese Jesuit missionary Bento de Góis, SJ. By his account, he visited a city named &quot;Capherstam&quot; in 1602, during the course of a journey from Lahore to China.

American adventurer Colonel Alexander Gardner claimed to have visited Kafiristan twice, in 1826 and 1828. On the first occasion, Dost Mohammad, the amir of Kabul, killed members of Gardner&#x27;s delegation in Afghanistan and forced him to flee from Kabul to Yarkand through west Kafiristan. On his second visit, Gardner briefly sojourned in northern Kafiristan and the Kunar Valley while returning from Yarkand.

In 1883, William Watts McNair, a British surveyor on leave, explored the area disguised as a hakim. He reported on the journey later that year to the Royal Geographical Society.

George Scott Robertson, medical officer during the Second Anglo-Afghan War and later British political officer in the princely state of Chitral, was given permission to explore the country of the Kafirs in 1890–91. He was the last outsider to visit the area and observe these people&#x27;s polytheistic culture before their conversion to Islam. Robertson&#x27;s 1896 account was entitled &quot;The Kafirs of the Hindu Kush&quot;. Though some sub-groups such as the Kom paid tribute to Chitral, the majority of Kafiristan was left on the Afghan side of the frontier in 1893, when large areas of tribal lands between Afghanistan and British India were divided into zones of control by the Durand Line.

The territory between Afghanistan and British India was demarcated between 1894 and 1896. Part of the frontier lying between Nawa Kotal in the outskirts of Mohmand country and Bashgal Valley on the outskirts of Kafiristan was demarcated by 1895 in an agreement reached on 9 April 1895. Emir Abdur Rahman Khan wanted to force every community and tribal confederation to accept his single interpretation of Islam due to it being the only uniting factor. After the subjugation of Hazaras, Kafiristan was the last remaining autonomous part.

Abdur Rahman Khan&#x27;s forces invaded Kafiristan in the winter of 1895–96 and captured it in 40 days according to his autobiography. Columns invaded it from the west through Panjshir to Kullum, the strongest fort of the region. The columns from the north came through Badakhshan and from the east through Asmar. A small column also came from south-west through Laghman. The Kafirs were resettled in Laghman while the region was settled by veteran soldiers and other Afghans. The Kafirs were converted and some also converted to avoid the &quot;jizya&quot;.

A few years after Robertson&#x27;s visit, in 1895–96, Abdur Rahman Khan invaded and converted the Kafirs to Islam as a symbolic climax to his campaigns to bring the country under a centralised Afghan government. He had similarly subjugated the Hazara people in 1892–93. In 1896 Abdur Rahman Khan, who had thus conquered the region for Islam, renamed the people the Nuristani (&quot;Enlightened Ones&quot; in Persian) and the land as Nuristan (&quot;Land of the Enlightened&quot;).

Kafiristan was full of steep and wooded valleys. It was famous for its precise wood carving, especially of cedar-wood pillars, carved doors, furniture (including &quot;horn chairs&quot;) and statuary. Some of these pillars survive, as they were reused in mosques, but temples, shrines, and centers of local cults, with their wooden effigies and multitudes of ancestor figures were torched and burnt to the ground. Only a small fraction brought back to Kabul as spoils of this Islamic victory over infidels. These consisted of various wooden effigies of ancestral heroes and pre-Islamic commemorative chairs. Of the more than thirty wooden figures brought to Kabul in 1896 or shortly thereafter, fourteen went to the Kabul Museum and four to the Musée Guimet and the Musée de l&#x27;Homme located in Paris.
Those in the Kabul Museum were badly damaged under the Taliban but have since been restored.

A few hundred Kati Kafirs, known as the &quot;Red Kafirs&quot; of the Bashgal Valley, fled across the border into Chitral but, uprooted from their homeland, they converted by the 1930s. They settled near the frontier in the valleys of Rumbur, Bumburet and Urtsun, which were then inhabited by the Kalash tribe or the Black Kafirs. Only this group in the five valleys of Birir, Bumburet, Rumbur, Jineret and Urtsun escaped conversion, because they were located east of the Durand Line in the princely state of Chitral. However, by the 1940s the southern valleys of Urtsun and Jingeret had been converted. After a decline in population caused by forced conversion in the 1970s, this region of Kafiristan in Pakistan, known as Kalasha Desh, has recently shown an increase in its population.

In early 1991, the Republic of Afghanistan government recognized the &quot;de facto&quot; autonomy of Nuristan and created a new province of that name from districts of Kunar Province and Laghman Province.

<text>Jean Negulesco (born Ioan Negulescu; – 18 July 1993) was a Romanian-American film director and screenwriter. He first gained notice for his film noirs and later made such notable films as &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; (1948), &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; (1953), &quot;Titanic&quot; (1953), and &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; (1954).

He was called &quot;the first real master of CinemaScope&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Craiova, Negulesco was the son of a hotel keeper and attended Carol I High School.

When he was 15, he was working in a military hospital during World War I. George Enescu, the Romanian composer, came to play the violin to the war wounded; Negulesco drew a portrait of him, and Enesco bought it. Negulesco decided to be a painter and studied art in Bucharest.

Negulesco went to Paris in 1920, and enrolled in the Académie Julian. He sold one of his paintings to Rex Ingram.

===America===
In 1927, he visited New York City for an exhibition of his paintings and settled there.

He then made his way to California, at first working as a portraitist.

He became interested in movies and made an experimental feature film, financed as well as written and directed by himself, called &quot;Three and a Day&quot;. Through his contact with the film&#x27;s star, Mischa Auer, he managed to get a job at Paramount.

===Paramount===
He did the opening montage for the film musical &quot;Tonight We Sing&quot; and worked on &quot;The Story of Temple Drake&quot; and &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1932).

He worked his way to assistant producer, second unit director.

===Warner Brothers===
Negulesco went to Warner Brothers in 1940. He made his reputation at Warner Bros by directing short subjects, particularly a series of band shorts featuring unusual camera angles and dramatic use of shadows and silhouettes.

Negulesco&#x27;s first feature film as director was &quot;Singapore Woman&quot; (1941). In 1948, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Directing for &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot;.

===20th Century Fox===
In 1948, Negulesco went to work for 20th Century Fox. He was the first director to make two films in Fox&#x27;s CinemaScope - &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; and &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot;; the former receiving a nomination for a BAFTA Award for Best Film.

His 1959 movie &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; was on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Top 50 Cult Films of All-Time.

During his Hollywood career and in his 1984 autobiography &quot;Things I Did and Things I Think I Did&quot;, Negulesco claimed to have been born on 29 February 1900; he apparently was motivated to make this statement because birthdays on leap year day are comparatively rare (and even though 1900 was not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar, it was under the Julian calendar, which applied in Romania at that time).

He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6212 Hollywood Blvd.

==Death==
From the late 1960s, Negulesco lived in Marbella, Spain, where he died, at age 93, of heart failure. He is buried in the Virgen del Carmen cemetery in Marbella.

<text>Gerald Joseph Mulligan (April 6, 1927 – January 20, 1996), also known as Jeru, was an American jazz saxophonist, clarinetist, composer and arranger. Though primarily known as one of the leading jazz baritone saxophonists—playing the instrument with a light and airy tone in the era of cool jazz—Mulligan was also a significant arranger working with Claude Thornhill, Miles Davis, Stan Kenton, and others. His piano-less quartet of the early 1950s with trumpeter Chet Baker is still regarded as one of the best cool jazz ensembles. Mulligan was also a skilled pianist and played several other reed instruments. Several of his compositions including &quot;Walkin&#x27; Shoes&quot; and &quot;Five Brothers&quot;, have become standards.

==Biography==
=== Early life and career ===
Gerry Mulligan was born in Queens Village, Queens, New York, the son of George and Louise Mulligan. His father was a Wilmington, Delaware, native of Irish descent; his mother a Philadelphia native of half-Irish and half-German descent. Gerry was the youngest of four sons with George, Phil and Don preceding him.

George Mulligan&#x27;s career as an engineer necessitated frequent moves through numerous cities. When Gerry was less than a year old, the family moved to Marion, Ohio, where his father accepted a job with the Marion Power Shovel Company.

With the demands of a large home and four young boys to raise, Mulligan&#x27;s mother hired an African American nanny named Lily Rose, who became especially fond of the youngest Mulligan. As he became older, Mulligan began spending time at Rose&#x27;s house and was especially amused by Rose&#x27;s player piano, which Mulligan later recalled as having rolls by numerous players, including Fats Waller. Black musicians sometimes came through town, and because many motels would not take them, they often had to stay at homes within the black community. The young Mulligan occasionally met such musicians staying at Rose&#x27;s home.

The family&#x27;s moves continued with stops in South Jersey (where Mulligan lived with his maternal grandmother), Chicago, and Kalamazoo, Michigan, where Mulligan lived for three years and attended Catholic school. When the school moved into a new building and established music courses, Mulligan decided to play clarinet in the school&#x27;s nascent orchestra. Mulligan made an attempt at arranging with the Richard Rodgers song &quot;Lover&quot;, but the arrangement was seized prior to its first reading by an overzealous nun who was taken aback by the title on the arrangement.

When Gerry Mulligan was 14, his family moved to Detroit and then to Reading, Pennsylvania. While in Reading, Mulligan began studying clarinet with dance-band musician Sammy Correnti, who also encouraged Mulligan&#x27;s interest in arranging. Mulligan also began playing saxophone professionally in dance bands in Philadelphia, an hour and a half or so away.

The Mulligan family next moved to Philadelphia, where Gerry attended the West Philadelphia Catholic High School for Boys and organized a school big band, for which he also wrote arrangements. When Mulligan was sixteen, he approached Johnny Warrington at local radio station WCAU about writing arrangements for the station&#x27;s house band. Warrington was impressed and began buying Mulligan&#x27;s arrangements.

Mulligan dropped out of high school during his senior year to pursue work with a touring band. He contacted bandleader Tommy Tucker when Tucker was visiting Philadelphia&#x27;s Earle Theatre. While Tucker did not need an additional reedman, he was looking for an arranger and Mulligan was hired at $100 a week to do two or three arrangements a week (including all copying). At the conclusion of Mulligan&#x27;s three-month contract, Tucker told Mulligan that he should move on to another band which was a little less &quot;tame&quot;. Mulligan went back to Philadelphia and began writing for Elliot Lawrence, a pianist and composer who had taken over for Warrington as the band leader at WCAU.

Mulligan moved to New York City in January 1946 and joined the arranging staff on Gene Krupa&#x27;s bebop-tinged band. Arrangements of Mulligan&#x27;s work with Krupa include &quot;Birdhouse&quot;, &quot;Disc Jockey Jump&quot; and an arrangement of &quot;How High the Moon&quot;, quoting Charlie Parker&#x27;s &quot;Ornithology&quot; as a countermelody.

Mulligan next began arranging for the Claude Thornhill Orchestra, occasionally sitting in as a member of the reed section. Thornhill&#x27;s arranging staff included Gil Evans, whom Mulligan had met while working with the Krupa band. Mulligan eventually began living with Evans; this was at the time that Evans&#x27; apartment on West 55th Street became a regular hangout for a number of jazz musicians, working on creating a new jazz idiom.

===&quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;===
In September 1948, Miles Davis formed a nine-piece band that used arrangements by Mulligan, Evans and John Lewis. The band initially consisted of Davis on trumpet, Mulligan on baritone saxophone, trombonist Mike Zwerin, alto saxophonist Lee Konitz, Junior Collins on French horn, tubist Bill Barber, pianist John Lewis, bassist Al McKibbon, and drummer Max Roach.

The band only played a handful of live performances (a two-week engagement at the Royal Roost and two nights at the Clique Club). However over the next couple of years, Davis reformed the nonet on three occasions to record twelve pieces for release as singles by Capitol Records. They formed the &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; 12-inch album released in 1957. Mulligan wrote and arranged three of the tunes recorded (&quot;Rocker&quot;, &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;, and &quot;Jeru&quot;, the last named after himself), and arranged a further three (&quot;Deception&quot;, &quot;Godchild&quot;, and &quot;Darn That Dream&quot;).

He was also one of only four musicians who played on all the recordings, with Davis, Konitz and Barber. Despite the chilly reception by audiences of 1949, the Davis nine-piece has been judged by history as one of the most influential groups in jazz history, creating a sound that, despite its East Coast origins, became known as West Coast Jazz.

During his period of occasional work with the Davis nonet between 1949 and 1951, Mulligan also regularly performed with and arranged for trombonist Kai Winding. Mulligan&#x27;s composition &quot;Elevation&quot; and his arrangement of &quot;Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea&quot; were recorded by Mulligan&#x27;s old boss, Elliot Lawrence. It brought Mulligan additional recognition. Mulligan also arranged for and recorded with bands led by Georgie Auld and Chubby Jackson.

In September 1951, Mulligan recorded the first album under his own name, &quot;Mulligan Plays Mulligan&quot;. By that point, he had mastered a melodic and linear playing style, inspired by Lester Young, that he would retain for the rest of his career.

In early 1952, seeking better employment opportunities, Mulligan headed west to Los Angeles with his girlfriend, pianist Gail Madden. Through an acquaintance with arranger Bob Graettinger, Mulligan started writing arrangements for Stan Kenton&#x27;s Orchestra. While most of Mulligan&#x27;s work for Kenton were somewhat pedestrian arrangements, that Kenton needed to fill out money-making dance performances, Mulligan was able to throw in some more substantial original works along the way. His compositions &quot;Walking Shoes&quot; and &quot;Young Blood&quot;, stand out as embodiments of the contrapuntal style that became Mulligan&#x27;s signature.

=== The pianoless quartet with Chet Baker ===
While arranging for Kenton, Mulligan began performing on off-nights at The Haig, a small jazz club on Wilshire Boulevard at Kenmore Street in Hollywood, Los Angeles. During the Monday night jam sessions, a young trumpeter named Chet Baker began sitting in with Mulligan. Mulligan and Baker began recording together, although they were unsatisfied with the results. Around that time, vibraphonist Red Norvo&#x27;s trio (with guitar and bass) began headlining at The Haig, thus leaving no need to keep the grand piano that had been brought in for Erroll Garner&#x27;s stay at the club.

Faced with a dilemma of what to do for a rhythm section, Mulligan decided to build on earlier experiments and perform as a pianoless quartet with Baker on trumpet, Carson Smith on bass, and Chico Hamilton on drums (later Mulligan himself would occasionally double on piano). These early live dates were recorded by Richard Bock on a portable reel-to-reel tape deck. Bock along with Roy Harte would soon after, start the Pacific Jazz label and release Mulligan&#x27;s records. Mulligan&#x27;s first recording sessions in Los Angeles were produced by Bock for Pacific Jazz. These three informal sessions took place in June, July, and August 1952 at the Hollywood Hills home studio of recording engineer Phil Turetsky. At these sessions, Mulligan, Chet Baker, and others recorded the material that was released as Pacific Jazz PJ LP-1 and later on PJ-8.

Baker&#x27;s melodic style fit well with Mulligan&#x27;s, leading them to create improvised contrapuntal textures free from the rigid confines of a piano-enforced chordal structure. While novel at the time in sound and style, this ethos of contrapuntal group improvisation hearkened back to the formative days of jazz. Despite their very different backgrounds–Mulligan, a classically trained New Yorker, and Baker, from Oklahoma and a much more instinctive player–they had an almost psychic rapport and Mulligan later remarked that: &quot;I had never experienced anything like that before and not really since.&quot; Their dates at the Haig became sell-outs and the recordings they made in late 1952 became major sellers, that led to significant acclaim for Mulligan and Baker. The recordings included singles such as &quot;Motel&quot; (1953) labelled as &#x27;The Gerry Mulligan Quartet Featuring Chet Baker&#x27;.

The fortuitous collaboration came to an abrupt end with Mulligan&#x27;s arrest on narcotics charges in mid-1953, leading to six months at Sheriff&#x27;s Honor Farm. Both Mulligan and Baker had, like many of their peers, become heroin addicts. However, while Mulligan was in prison, Baker transformed his lyrical trumpet style, gentle tenor voice and matinee-idol looks into independent stardom. Thus, when upon his release Mulligan attempted to rehire Baker, the trumpeter declined the offer for financial reasons. They did briefly reunite at the 1955 Newport Jazz Festival and would occasionally get together for performances and recordings up through a 1974 performance at Carnegie Hall. But in later years their relationship became strained as Mulligan, with considerable effort, would manage to kick his habit, while Baker&#x27;s addiction bedevilled him professionally and personally almost constantly until his death in 1988.

=== Middle career ===

Mulligan continued the quartet format with valve trombonist Bob Brookmeyer replacing Baker, although Mulligan and Brookmeyer both occasionally played piano. The quartet played at the third Paris Jazz Fair in 1954, with Red Mitchell on bass and Frank Isola on drums. This quartet structure remained the core of Mulligan&#x27;s groups throughout the rest of the 1950s, with sporadic personnel changes and expansions of the group with trumpeters Jon Eardley and Art Farmer; saxophonists Zoot Sims, Al Cohn and Lee Konitz; and vocalist Annie Ross. In 1957, Mulligan and his wife, Arlyne Brown Mulligan (daughter of composer Lew Brown), had a son, Reed Brown Mulligan.

Mulligan also studied piano with Suezenne Fordham, who was a member of the inner circle of jazz players in New York. She was sought out by jazz musicians of the era to coach them to improve their piano technique. She and Mulligan also had a personal relationship from 1966 through 1972.

Mulligan also performed as a soloist or sideman (often in festival settings) with a variety of late-1950s jazz artists: Paul Desmond, Duke Ellington, Ben Webster, Johnny Hodges, Jimmy Witherspoon, André Previn, Billie Holiday, Marian McPartland, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Stan Getz, Thelonious Monk, Fletcher Henderson, Manny Albam, Quincy Jones, Kai Winding, Miles Davis, and Dave Brubeck. Mulligan appeared in Art Kane&#x27;s A Great Day in Harlem portrait of 57 major jazz musicians taken in August 1958.

Mulligan formed his first &quot;Concert Jazz Band&quot; in the spring of 1960. Partly an attempt to revisit big band music in a smaller setting, the band varied in size and personnel, with the core group being six brass, five reeds (including Mulligan) and a pianoless two-piece rhythm section (though as in the earlier quartets Mulligan or Brookmeyer sometimes doubled on piano). The membership included (at various times, among others): trumpeters Conte Candoli, Nick Travis, Clark Terry, Don Ferrara, Al Derisi, Thad Jones and Doc Severinsen; saxophonists Zoot Sims, Jim Reider, Gene Allen, Bobby Donovan, Phil Woods, and Gene Quill; trombonists Willie Dennis; Alan Raph and Bob Brookmeyer; drummers Mel Lewis and Gus Johnson; and bassists Buddy Clark and Bill Crow. The band also recorded an album of songs sung by Mulligan&#x27;s girlfriend Judy Holliday in 1961. The band toured and recorded extensively through the end of 1964, eventually recording five albums for Verve Records.

Mulligan resumed work with small groups in 1962 and appeared with other groups sporadically (notably in festival situations). Mulligan continued to work intermittently in small group settings until the end of his life, although performing dates started to become more infrequent during the mid 1960s. After Dave Brubeck&#x27;s quartet broke up in 1967, Mulligan began appearing regularly with Brubeck as the &quot;Gerry Mulligan / Dave Brubeck Quartet&quot; through 1973. After that Mulligan and Brubeck worked together sporadically until the final year of Mulligan&#x27;s life.

In 1971, Mulligan created his most significant work for big band in over a decade, for the album &quot;The Age of Steam&quot;. At various times in the 1970s, he performed with Charles Mingus. The Concert Jazz Band was &quot;reformed&quot; with younger players, including a full-time pianist in Mitchel Forman, in 1978, and toured during the 1980s.

=== Orchestral work ===
Mulligan, like many jazz musicians of his era, occasionally recorded with strings. Dates included 1957 recordings with Vinnie Burke&#x27;s String Jazz Quartet, a 1959 orchestra album with André Previn and a 1965 album of the Gerry Mulligan Quintet and Strings. In 1974, Mulligan recorded in Italy the album &quot;Summit&quot; with Argentine tango musician Ástor Piazzolla. While in Milan for the recording sessions, Mulligan met his future wife, Countess Franca Rota Borghini Baldovinetti, a freelance photojournalist and reporter. In 1975, Mulligan recorded an album with Italian pianist / composer Enrico Intra, bassist/arranger Pino Presti, flutist Giancarlo Barigozzi, and drummer Tullio De Piscopo.
Mulligan&#x27;s more classical work with orchestras began in May 1970 with a performance of Dave Brubeck&#x27;s oratorio, &quot;The Light in the Wilderness&quot; with Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Symphony.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Mulligan worked to build and promote a repertoire of baritone saxophone music for orchestra. In 1973, Mulligan commissioned composer Frank Proto to write a &quot;Saxophone Concerto&quot; that was premiered with the Cincinnati Symphony. In 1977, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation commissioned Harry Freedman to write the saxophone concerto &quot;Celebration&quot;, which was performed by Mulligan with the CBC Symphony. In 1982, Zubin Mehta invited Mulligan to play soprano saxophone in a New York Philharmonic performance of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;.

In 1984, Mulligan commissioned Harry Freedman to write &quot;The Sax Chronicles&quot;, which was an arrangement of some of Mulligan&#x27;s melodies in pastiche styles. In April of that year, Mulligan was a soloist with the New American Orchestra in Los Angeles for the premiere of Patrick Williams&#x27; &quot;Spring Wings&quot;.

In June 1984, Mulligan completed and performed his first orchestral commission, &quot;Entente for Baritone Saxophone and Orchestra&quot;, with the Filarmonia Venetia. In October, Mulligan performed &quot;Entente&quot; and &quot;The Sax Chronicles&quot; with the London Symphony Orchestra.

In 1987, Mulligan adapted &quot;K-4 Pacific&quot; (from his 1971 &quot;Age of Steam&quot; big band recording) for quartet with orchestra and performed it beside &quot;Entente&quot; with the Israel Philharmonic in Tel Aviv with Zubin Mehta conducting. Mulligan&#x27;s orchestral appearances at the time also included the Houston Symphony, Stockholm Philharmonic and New York Philharmonic.

In 1988, Mulligan&#x27;s &quot;Octet for Sea Cliff&quot; was premiered. A chamber work, it was commissioned by the Sea Cliff Chamber Players. In 1991, the Concordia Orchestra premiered &quot;Momo&#x27;s Clock&quot;, a work for orchestra (without saxophone solo) that was inspired by a book by German author Michael Ende.

=== Last years ===

Throughout Mulligan&#x27;s orchestral work and until the end of his life, Mulligan maintained an active career performing and recording jazz – usually with a quartet that included a piano.

In June 1988, Mulligan was invited to be the first Composer-in-Residence at the Glasgow International Jazz Festival and was commissioned to write a work, which he titled &quot;The Flying Scotsman&quot;. In 1991, Mulligan contacted Miles Davis about revisiting the music from the seminal 1949 &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; album. Davis had recently performed some of his Gil Evans collaborations with Quincy Jones at the Montreux Jazz Festival and was enthusiastic. However, Davis died in September and Mulligan continued the recording project and tour with Wallace Roney and Art Farmer substituting for Davis. &quot;Re-Birth of the Cool&quot; (released in 1992) featured the charts from &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;, and a nonet which included Lewis and Barber from the original Davis band. Mulligan appeared at the Brecon Jazz Festival in 1991. Mulligan&#x27;s final recording was a quartet album (with guests), &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, recorded in the summer of 1995 and released on the Telarc label. Mulligan gave his final performance on the 13th Annual Floating Jazz Festival, Caribbean Cruise, November 9, 1995.

Mulligan died in Darien, Connecticut, on January 20, 1996, at the age of 68, following complications from knee surgery. His widow Franca–to whom he had been married since 1982–said he had also been suffering from liver cancer. Upon Mulligan&#x27;s death, his library and numerous personal effects (including a gold-plated Conn baritone saxophone) were given to the Library of Congress. &#x27;The Gerry Mulligan Collection&#x27; is open to registered public researchers in the library&#x27;s Performing Arts Research Center. The library placed Mulligan&#x27;s saxophone on permanent exhibit in early 2009.

==Theatre and film==
Mulligan&#x27;s first film appearance was probably with Krupa&#x27;s orchestra playing alto saxophone in the RKO short film &quot;Follow That Music&quot; (1946). Mulligan had small roles in the films &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; (1958), as a jazz combo member; &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot; (1960), featuring his performance at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival; &quot;The Rat Race&quot; (1960), in which he appears as a tenor saxophonist instead of his usual instrument; &quot;The Subterraneans&quot; (1960) and &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; (also 1960) with his then partner, Judy Holliday. Mulligan also performed numerous times on television programmes during his career.

As a film composer, Mulligan wrote music for &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot; (1965, the title theme), the film version of the Broadway comedy &quot;Luv&quot; (1967), the French films &quot;La Menace&quot; (1977) and &quot;Les Petites galères&quot; (1977, with Ástor Piazzolla) and &quot;I&#x27;m Not Rappaport&quot; (1996, the title theme).

In 1974, Mulligan collaborated on a musical version of Anita Loos&#x27; play &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;. Although the creative team had great hopes for the work, it never made it past a workshop production at the University of Alabama. In 1978, Mulligan wrote incidental music for Dale Wasserman&#x27;s Broadway play &quot;Play with Fire&quot;.

In 1995, the Hal Leonard Corporation released the video tape &quot;The Gerry Mulligan Workshop – A Master Class on Jazz and Its Legendary Players&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mulligan married Jeffie Lee Boyd in 1953, but the marriage was annulled. Later that same year he married Arlyne Brown, the daughter of songwriter Lew Brown. Their son, Reed Brown Mulligan, was born in 1957. The couple divorced in 1959. 

Mulligan spent the next six years with actress and singer Judy Holliday, with whom he recorded an album, &quot;Holliday With Mulligan&quot;. Holliday died of cancer in 1965. After Holliday’s death, Mulligan met actress Sandy Dennis. According to her manager, Bill Treusch, Dennis and Mulligan never officially married, but were together from 1965 to 1976. In 1974, Mulligan met Countess Franca Rota Borghini Baldovinetti, through their mutual friend Astor Piazzolla, although they didn’t marry until 1982. They remained together until his death.

<text>The ancient Hebrews identified poetical portions in their sacred texts, as shown by their entitling as &quot;psalms&quot; or as &quot;chants&quot; passages such as Exodus 15:1-19 and Numbers 21:17-20; a song or chant () is, according to the primary meaning of the term, poetry. The question as to whether the poetical passages of the Old Testament show signs of regular rhythm or meter remains unsolved. Many of the features of Biblical poetry are lost when the poems are translated to English.

== Characteristics of Ancient Hebrew poetry ==

=== Unusual forms ===
The employment of unusual forms of language cannot be considered as a sign of ancient Hebrew poetry. In and elsewhere the form occurs. But this form, which represents partly and partly , has many counterparts in Hebrew grammar, as, for example, instead of ; or = &quot;them&quot;; or = &quot;their&quot;; or = &quot;to them&quot;—forms found in passages for which no claim to poetical expressions is made. Then there are found = &quot;beast&quot;, = &quot;tying&quot;, and = &quot;salvation&quot;—three forms that probably retain remnants of the old endings of the nominative, genitive, and accusative: 

Again, in Lamech&#x27;s words, &quot;Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, harken unto my speech&quot;, the two words and attract attention, because they occur for the first time in this passage, although there had been an earlier opportunity of using them: in Genesis 3:8 and 3:10, = &quot;to harken&quot; could have been used just as well as its synonym = &quot;to hear&quot;.

Furthermore, = &quot;speech&quot; might have been used instead of the essentially identical in Genesis 9:1 and following, but its earliest use is, as stated above, in Genesis 4:23. In place of = &quot;man&quot; is employed. (compare the Aramaic ).

A systematic review of similar unusual forms of Hebrew grammar and Hebrew words occurring in certain portions of the Old Testament. Such forms have been called since the publication of Robert Lowth&#x27;s iii. (1753); but this designation is ambiguous and can be accepted only in agreement with the rule for some of these unusual forms and words are found elsewhere than in the &quot;songs&quot; of the Old Testament.

These unusual forms and expressions do not occur in all songs, and there are several Psalms that have none of these peculiarities.

=== Parallelism ===

Not even the is an absolutely certain indication of ancient Hebrew poetry. This &quot;parallelism&quot; occurs in the portions of the Hebrew Bible that are at the same time marked frequently by the so-called ; it consists in a remarkable correspondence in the ideas expressed in two successive units (hemistiches, verses, strophes, or larger units); for example, the above-cited words of Lamech, &quot;Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, harken unto my speech&quot;, in which are found and show a remarkable repetition of the same thought.

But this ideal corythmy is not always present in the songs of the Old Testament or in the Psalms, as the following passages will show:
* &quot;The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation&quot; ().
* &quot;Saul and Jonathan, the beloved and the lovely in life, and in death they were not divided&quot;.
* &quot;Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, and fine linen&quot;.
* &quot;And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season&quot;;
* &quot;I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord sustained me. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about&quot;.

Julius Ley says therefore correctly that

:&quot;the poets did not consider themselves bound by parallelism to such an extent as not to set it aside when the thought required it.&quot;

Though this restriction must be made to James Robertson&#x27;s view, it remains the case that: &quot;The distinguishing feature of the Hebrew poetry ... is the rhythmical balancing of parts, or parallelism of thought.&quot;

Various rhetorical forms appear in the parallelisms of Biblical poetry. These include:

* Synonymous parallelism; in this form, the second unit (hemistich or half line of verse, verse, strophe, or larger unit) says much the same thing as the first one, with variations. An example appears in Amos 5:24:

:&quot;But let judgment run down as waters,&quot;
::&quot;and righteousness as a mighty stream.&quot;

Another example of synonymous parallelism comes in Isaiah 2:4 or Micah 4:3:

:&quot;They will beat their swords into plowshares&quot;
::&quot;and their spears into pruning hooks.&quot;

* Antithesis is also found; here, the second unit directly contrasts with the first, often making the same point from the opposite perspective. From Proverbs 10:1:

:&quot;A wise son maketh a glad father,&quot;
::&quot;but a foolish son&quot; is &quot;the heaviness of his mother.&quot;

* Emblematic parallelism occurs where one unit renders figuratively the literal meaning of another.
* Synthetic parallelism occurs where the units balance, clause for clause, with one unit building upon or adding to the first. From Psalm 14:2:

:&quot;The looked down from heaven upon the children of men,&quot;
::&quot;to see if there were any that did understand&quot; and &quot;seek God.&quot;

* Climactic parallelism occurs where the second unit partially balances the first, but also adds a summative thought or completes the series. From Psalm 29:1:

:&quot;Give unto the , O ye mighty,&quot;
::&quot;give unto the glory and strength.&quot;

* External parallelism occurs when the syntactic units balance one another across multiple verses. Here, some of the permitted sorts of parallelisms are added not only within a single line of verse, but also between lines. From Isaiah 1:27-28:

:&quot;Zion shall be redeemed with judgment,&quot;
::&quot;and her converts with righteousness.&quot;
:&quot;And the destruction of the transgressors and the sinners&quot; shall be &quot;together,&quot;
::&quot;and they that forsake the shall be consumed.&quot;

External parallelism can also &quot;accumulate&quot; in a chiastic or &quot;ring&quot; structure that may include many verses. For example, Psalm 1 utilizes synonymous, synthetic, and emblematic parallelism before &quot;turning&quot; antithetically back to emblematic, synthetic, and then synonymous parallels.

=== Quantitative rhythm ===
The poetry of the ancient Hebrews is not distinguished from the other parts of the Old Testament by rhythm based on quantity, though in view of Greek and Roman poetry it was natural to seek such a rhythm in the songs and Psalms of the Old Testament. William Jones, for example, attempted to prove that there was a definite sequence of long and short syllables in the ancient Hebrew poems; but he could support this thesis only by changing the punctuation in many ways, and by allowing great license to the Hebrew poets. However, on reading the portions of the Old Testament marked by the so-called or by parallelism (e.g., Genesis 4:23 and following) no such sequence of long and short syllables can be discovered; and Sievers says: &quot;Hebrew prosody is not based on quantity as classical prosody is.&quot;

=== Accentual rhythm ===
Many scholars hold that the Hebrew poet considered only the syllables receiving the main accent, and did not count the intervening ones. Examples contrary to this are not found in passages where forms of the so-called are used, as Ley holds; and Israel Davidson has proved that the choice of instead of favors in only a few passages the opinion that the poet intended to cause an accented syllable to be followed by an unaccented one.

The rhythm of Hebrew poetry may be similar to that of the German — a view that is strongly supported by the nature of the songs sung by the populace of Palestine in the early 20th century. These songs have been described by L. Schneller in the following words:

:&quot;The rhythms are manifold; there may be eight accents in one line, and three syllables are often inserted between two accents, the symmetry and variation being determined by emotion and sentiment.&quot;

Also in Palestine, Gustaf Hermann Dalman observed:

:&quot;Lines with two, three, four, and five accented syllables may be distinguished, between which one to three, and even four, unaccented syllables may be inserted, the poet being bound by no definite number in his poem. Occasionally two accented syllables are joined&quot;.

Such free rhythms are, in Davidson&#x27;s opinion, found also in the poetry of the Old Testament. Under the stress of their thoughts and feelings the poets of Israel sought to achieve merely the material, not the formal symmetry of corresponding lines. This may be observed, for example, in the following lines of Psalm 2: &quot;Serve the with fear&quot; (, 2:11), &quot;rejoice with trembling&quot; (). This is shown more in detail by König; and Carl Heinrich Cornill has confirmed this view by saying:

:&quot;Equal length of the several stichoi was not the basic formal law of Jeremiah&#x27;s metric construction.&quot;

Sievers is inclined to restrict Hebrew rhythm by various rules, as he attacks Karl Budde&#x27;s view, that

:&quot;a foot which is lacking in one-half of a verse may find a substitute in the more ample thought of this shorter line&quot;.

Furthermore, the verse of the Old Testament poetry is naturally iambic or anapestic, as the words are accented on one of the final syllables.

=== The Dirges ===
A special kind of rhythm may be observed in the dirges, called kinnot in Hebrew. A whole book of these elegies is contained in the Hebrew Bible, the first of them beginning thus: &quot;How does the city sit solitary—that was full of people—how is she become as a widow—she that was great among the nations—and princess among the provinces—how is she become tributary!&quot; (Lamentations 1:1).

The rhythm of such lines lies in the fact that a longer line is always followed by a shorter one. As in the elegiac couplet of Greco-Roman poetry, this change was intended to symbolize the idea that a strenuous advance in life is followed by fatigue or reaction. This rhythm, which may be designated &quot;elegiac measure,&quot; occurs also in Amos 5:2, expressly designated as a ḳinah (often spelt qinah). The sad import of his prophecies induced Jeremiah also to employ the rhythm of the dirges several times in his utterances (Jeremiah 9:20, 13:18 and following). He refers here expressly to the (the mourning women) who in the East still chant the death-song to the trembling tone of the pipe (48:36 and following). are found also in Ezekiel 19:1, 26:17, 27:2, 32:2 and following, 32:16, 32:19 and following.

This elegiac measure, being naturally a well-known one, was used also elsewhere, as, for example, in . The rhythm of the ḳinah has been analyzed especially by Budde. Similar funeral songs of the modern Arabs are quoted by Wetzstein, as, e.g.: &quot;O, if he only could be ransomed! truly, I would pay the ransom!&quot;

=== Anadiplosis ===
A special kind of rhythm was produced by the frequent use of anadiplosis, in which the phrase at the end of one sentence is repeated at the beginning of the next. Examples include the passages &quot;they came not to the help of the Lord [i.e., to protect God&#x27;s people], to the help of the Lord against the mighty&quot; and &quot;From whence shall my help come? My help cometh from the Lord&quot;.

Many similar passages occur in Psalms 120-134, which also contain an unusual number of epanalepsis, or catch-words, for which Israel Davidson proposed the name Thus there is the repetition of in ; of in ; and the catch-word in . As the employment of such repetitions is somewhat suggestive of the mounting of stairs, the superscription found at the beginning of these fifteen psalms, may have a double meaning: it may indicate not only the purpose of these songs, to be sung on the pilgrimages to the festivals at Jerusalem, but also the peculiar construction of the songs, by which the reciter is led from one step of the inner life to the next. Such graduated rhythm may be observed elsewhere; for the peasants in modern Syria accompany their national dance by a song the verses of which are connected like the links of a chain, each verse beginning with the final words of the preceding one.

=== Acrostics ===
Alphabetical acrostics are used as an external embellishment of a few poems. The letters of the alphabet, generally in their ordinary sequence, stand at the beginning of smaller or larger sections of Psalms 9-10 (probably), 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119, 145; Proverbs 31:10-31; Lamentations 1-4; and also of Sirach 51:13-29, as the newly discovered (but poorly preserved) Hebrew text of this book has shown.

Alphabetical and other acrostics occur frequently in Neo-Hebraic poetry. The existence of acrostics in Babylonian literature has been definitely proved; and alphabetical poems are found also among the Samaritans, Syrians, and Arabs. Cicero says ( II.54) that the verse of the sibyl was in acrostics; and the so-called contain an acrostic.

A secondary phenomenon, which distinguishes a part of the poems of the Old Testament from the other parts, is the so-called ; it has been much slighted. Although not all the poetical portions of the Old Testament are marked by a special accentuation, the Book of Job in 3:3-42:6 and the books of Psalms and Proverbs throughout have received unusual accents. This point will be further discussed later on.

== Division of the poetical portions of the Hebrew Bible ==

=== Poems that deal with events ===
First may be mentioned poems that deal principally with events, being epic-lyric in character: the triumphal song of Israel delivered from Egypt, or the &quot;song of the sea&quot;; the mocking song on the burning of Heshbon; the so-called &quot;song of Moses&quot;; the song of Deborah; the derisive song of victory of the Israelite women; Hannah&#x27;s song of praise; David&#x27;s song of praise on being saved from his enemies; Hezekiah&#x27;s song of praise on his recovery; Jonah&#x27;s song of praise; and many of the Psalms, e.g., those on the creation of the world, and on the election of Israel. A subdivision is formed by poems that deal more with description and praise: the so-called Well song; the song of praise on the uniqueness of the god of Israel; and those on his eternity; his omnipresence and omniscience; and his omnipotence.

=== Didactic poems ===
Poems appealing more to reason, being essentially didactic in character. These include fables, like that of Jotham; parables, like those of Nathan and others, or in the form of a song; riddles, maxims, the monologues and dialogues in Job 3:3 and following; compare also the reflections in monologue in Ecclesiastes. A number of the Psalms also are didactic in character. A series of them impresses the fact that God&#x27;s law teaches one to abhor sin, and inculcates a true love for the Temple and the feasts of Yahweh. Another set of Psalms (&quot;theodicies&quot;) shows that God is just, although it may at times not seem this way to a short-sighted observer of the world and of history.

=== Lyrics ===
Poems that portray feelings based on individual experience. Many of these lyrics express joy, as, e.g., Lamech&#x27;s so-called &quot;Song of the sword&quot;; David&#x27;s &quot;last words&quot;; the words of praise of liberated Israel; songs of praise like Psalms 18, 24, 126, etc. Other lyrics express mourning. First among these are the dirges proper for the dead, as the ḳinah on the death of Saul and Jonathan; that on Abner&#x27;s death; and all psalms of mourning, as, e.g., the expressions of sorrow of sufferers, and the expressions of penitence of sinners.

=== Poems that urge action ===
Finally, a large group of poems of the Old Testament that urge action and are exhortatory. These may be divided into two sections:

# The poet wishes something for himself, as in the so-called &quot;signal words&quot; (Numbers 10:35 and following, &quot;Arise, &quot; etc.); at the beginning of the Well song (21:17 and following, ); in the daring request, &quot;Sun, stand thou still&quot; (Joshua 10:12); in Habakkuk&#x27;s prayer (; Habakkuk 3:1-19); or in psalms of request for help in time of war (44, 60, etc.) or for liberation from prison (122, 137, etc.).
# The poet pronounces blessings upon others, endeavoring to move God to grant these wishes. To this group belong the blessing of Noah (Genesis 9:25-27), of Isaac (27:28-29 and 39-40), and of Jacob (49:3-27); Jethro&#x27;s congratulation of Israel (Exodus 18:10); the blessing of Aaron (Numbers 6:24-26) and of Balaam (23:7-10, 18-24, 24:5-9, 24:17-24); Moses&#x27; farewell (Deuteronomy 33:1 and following); the psalms that begin with = &quot;Blessed is,&quot; etc., or contain this phrase, as Psalms 1, 41, 84:5 and following, 84:13, 112, 119, 128.

It was natural that in the drama, which is intended to portray a whole series of external and internal events, several of the foregoing kinds of poems should be combined. This combination occurs in Canticles, which, in Davidson&#x27;s opinion, is most correctly characterized as a kind of drama.

<text>The Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 77, was composed by Johannes Brahms in 1878 and dedicated to his friend, the violinist Joseph Joachim. It is Brahms&#x27;s only violin concerto, and, according to Joachim, one of the four great German violin concerti:

==Instrumentation==
The Violin Concerto is scored for solo violin and orchestra consisting of 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons; 2 natural horns crooked in D, and 2 natural horns crooked in E, 2 trumpets in D, timpani, and strings. Despite Brahms&#x27;s scoring for natural (non-valved) horns in his orchestral works, valved horns have always been used in actual performance, even in Brahms&#x27;s time.

==Structure==
The concerto follows the standard concerto form, with three movements in the pattern quick–slow–quick:
Originally, the work was planned in four movements like the second piano concerto. The middle movements, one of which was intended to be a scherzo—a mark that Brahms intended a symphonic concerto rather than a virtuoso showpiece—were discarded and replaced with what Brahms called a &quot;feeble Adagio.&quot; Some of the discarded material was reworked for the second piano concerto.

Brahms, who was impatient with the minutiae of slurs marking the bowing, rather than phrasing, as was his usual practice, asked Joachim&#x27;s advice on the writing of the solo violin part. Joachim, who had first been alerted when Brahms informed him in August that &quot;a few violin passages&quot; would be coming in the mail, was eager that the concerto should be playable and idiomatic, and collaborated willingly, but not all his advice was heeded in the final score. The most familiar cadenza, which appears in the first movement, is by Joachim, though a number of people have provided alternatives, including Leopold Auer, Henri Marteau, Max Reger, Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz, George Enescu, Nigel Kennedy, Augustin Hadelich, Joshua Bell, and Rachel Barton Pine. A recording of the concerto released by Ruggiero Ricci has been coupled with Ricci&#x27;s recordings of sixteen different cadenzas.
==Premiere==
The work was premiered in Leipzig on January 1, 1879, by Joachim, who insisted on opening the concert with the Beethoven Violin Concerto, written in the same key, and closing with the Brahms. Brahms complained that &quot;it was a lot of D major—and not much else on the program.&quot; Joachim was not presenting two established works, but one established one and a new, difficult one by a composer who had a reputation for being difficult. The two works also share some striking similarities. For instance, Brahms has the violin enter with the timpani after the orchestral introduction: this is a clear homage to Beethoven, whose violin concerto also makes unusual use of the timpani.

Brahms conducted the premiere. Various modifications were made between then and the work&#x27;s publication by Fritz Simrock later in the year.

Critical reaction to the work was mixed: the canard that the work was not so much for violin as &quot;against the violin&quot; is attributed equally to conductor Hans von Bülow and to Joseph Hellmesberger, to whom Brahms entrusted the Vienna premiere, which was rapturously received by the public.

Joachim gave the British premiere at London&#x27;s Crystal Palace on February 22, 1879, with August Manns conducting. The cooling of his friendship with Brahms, who took Joachim&#x27;s wife&#x27;s side when his marriage collapsed, seems to have put him off campaigning actively for the concerto. Most of his colleagues disliked it.

Henryk Wieniawski called the work &quot;unplayable&quot;, and the violin virtuoso Pablo de Sarasate refused to play it because he didn&#x27;t want to &quot;fall so low&quot; as to &quot;stand on the rostrum, violin in hand and listen to the oboe playing the only tune in the adagio&quot;, though conceding the work to be &quot;very good music&quot;.

Against these critics, modern listeners often feel that Brahms was not really trying to produce a conventional vehicle for virtuoso display; he had higher musical aims. Similar criticisms have been voiced against the string concerti of other great composers, such as Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto and Hector Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Harold in Italy&quot;, for making the soloist &quot;almost part of the orchestra&quot;.

Three of Joachim&#x27;s pupils, Marie Soldat, Gabriele Wietrowetz, and Leonora Jackson did as much as anyone to help the piece gain a foothold.

==In popular culture==
The third movement of the Mutter and Karajan&#x27;s version is used twice in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;, including the end credits.

In Smilla&#x27;s Sense of Snow by Peter Høeg, Smilla, the protagonist says &quot;I cry because in the universe there is something as beautiful as Kremer playing Brahms&#x27;s violin concerto&quot;.

The third movement is sampled extensively in rapper Kurupt&#x27;s 1999 song Trylogy.

The violin entrance in the first movement is sampled extensively in Alicia Keys&#x27;s 2004 song, &quot;Karma&quot;.
