<text>Slavic paganism, Slavic mythology, or Slavic religion is the religious beliefs, myths, and ritual practices of the Slavs before Christianisation, which occurred at various stages between the 8th and the 13th century. 

The South Slavs, who likely settled in the Balkans during the 6th–7th centuries AD, bordering with the Byzantine Empire to the south, came under the sphere of influence of Eastern Christianity relatively early, beginning with the creation of writing systems for Slavic languages (first Glagolitic, and then Cyrillic script) in 855 by the brothers Saints Cyril and Methodius and the adoption of Christianity in Bulgaria in 864 and 863 in Great Moravia. The East Slavs followed with the official adoption in 988 by Vladimir the Great of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

The process of Christianising the West Slavs was more gradual and complicated compared to their eastern counterparts. The Moravians accepted Christianity as early as 831, the Bohemian dukes followed in 845, and the Slovaks accepted Christianity somewhere between the years 828 and 863, but the first historical Polish ruler, Mieszko I, accepted it much later, in 966, around the same time as the Sorbs, while the Polabian Slavs only came under the significant influence of the Catholic Church from the 12th century onwards. For the Polabian Slavs and the Sorbs, Christianisation went hand in hand with full or partial Germanisation.

The Christianisation of the Slavic peoples was, however, a slow and—in many cases—superficial phenomenon, especially in what is today Russia. It was vigorous in western and central parts of what is today Ukraine, since they were closer to Kiev, the capital of Kievan Rus&#x27;. Even there, however, popular resistance led by &quot;volkhv&quot;s, pagan priests or shamans, recurred periodically for centuries. Popular resistance to Christianity was also widespread in early Poland, culminating in the pagan reaction.

The West Slavs of the Baltic tenaciously withstood Christianity until it was violently imposed on them through the Northern Crusades. Among Poles and East Slavs, rebellions broke out throughout the 11th century. Christian chroniclers reported that the Slavs regularly re-embraced their original religion (&quot;relapsi sunt denuo ad paganismus&quot;).

Many elements of the Slavic indigenous religion were officially incorporated into Slavic Christianity (which manifested itself in the architecture of the Russian Church, icon painting, etc.), and the worship of Slavic gods has persisted in unofficial folk religion into modern times. The Slavs&#x27; resistance to Christianity gave rise to a &quot;whimsical syncretism&quot;, which was called &quot;dvoeverie&quot;, &quot;double faith&quot;, in Old Church Slavonic. Since the early 20th century, Slavic folk religion has undergone an organised reinvention and reincorporation in the movement of Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery).

==Sources==
===Foreign sources===
One of the first written sources on the religion of the ancient Slavs is the description of the Byzantine historian Procopius of Caesarea (6th century), who mentioned sacrifices to the supreme god-the thunderer of the Slavs, river spirits (&quot;nymphs&quot;) and others:
Al-Masudi, an Arab historian, geographer and traveler, equates the paganism of the Slavs and the Rus&#x27; with reason:
Western European authors of the 11th and 12th centuries gave detailed descriptions of the sanctuaries and cults of Redigost (Radegast, Svarozhich) in Rethra, Svyatovit (Svetovid) in Arkon (Jaromarsburg), Triglav in Szczecin, Chernobog, the sanctuary in Volyně, etc. The identification of a number of Eastern European monuments with Slavic sanctuaries is a matter of dispute (Peryn, a complex near the site of the Zbruch idol).

===Slavic sources===
The main idea of paganism and mythology of the Slavs is given primarily by historical and documentary sources (letopises and chronicles). The Tale of Bygone Years under the year 980 contains a story about the sanctuary in Kiev, built by Vladimir Svyatoslavich, and the idols of pagan gods installed there are mentioned:

The text mentions the deities Svarog, Yarilo and Veles. It is known that the idol of Veles stood in Kiev &quot;under the mountain&quot;, probably on the Kiev Podol, in the lower part of the city, that is, in the trade and craft part of Kiev at the pier on the Pochain River. In the &quot;Life of Vladimir&quot; it is said that this idol was overthrown during the baptism of Kievan Rus in 988: &quot;And Veles idol ... ordered to throw off the river in Pochaina&quot;.

Ancient Russian teachings against paganism can also serve as sources. In this genre, three of the most famous monuments are known: &quot;The Word of St. Gregory about idols&quot;, &quot;The word of a certain Christ-lover and the punishment of the spiritual father (about submission and obedience)&quot; and &quot;The Walking of the Virgin in torment&quot;.

===Modern sources===
In the absence of original mythological texts, Slavic paganism can only be understood through secondary sources, such as archaeological findings and non-Slavic historical texts, which then have to be analyzed via the comparative method and subsequent reconstruction, a means used by many historians, including Evgeny Anichkov, Dmitry Zelenin, Lubor Niederle, Henryk Łowmiański, Aleksander Gieysztor, Stanisław Urbańczyk and others.

Reconstruction, however, only gained momentum at the beginning of the 20th century, with Slavic sources being compared to sources on other Indo-European cultural traditions (Baltic, Iranian, German, etc.), where the works of Vechaslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov are among the most prominent.

The richest sources for the study of Slavic paganism as a cultural model and the reconstruction of Ancient Slavic ideas remain the linguistic, ethnographic and folklore studies of Slavic traditions from the 19th and 20th century, although some of these studies are contested due to historical inaccuracies. Many traces of Slavic paganism are thought to be left in European toponymy, including the names of settlements, rivers, mountains, and villages, but ethnologists such as Vitomir Belaj warn against hasty assumptions that the toponyms truly originate in pre-Christian mythological beliefs, with some potentially being derived from common vocabulary instead.

Twentieth-century scholars who pursued the study of ancient Slavic religion include Vyacheslav Ivanov, Vladimir Toporov, Marija Gimbutas, Boris Rybakov, and Roman Jakobson, among others. Rybakov is noted for his effort to re-examine medieval ecclesiastical texts, synthesizing his findings with archaeological data, comparative mythology, ethnography, and nineteenth-century folk practices. He also elaborated one of the most coherent pictures of ancient Slavic religion in his &quot;Paganism of the Ancient Slavs&quot; and other works. Among earlier, nineteenth-century scholars there was Bernhard Severin Ingemann, known for his study of &quot;Fundamentals of a North Slavic and Wendish mythology&quot;.

Historical documents about Slavic religion include the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, compiled in Kiev around 1111, and the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; compiled in the Novgorod Republic. They contain detailed reports of the annihilation of the official Slavic religion of Kiev and Novgorod, and the subsequent &quot;double faith&quot;. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; also contains the authentic text of Rus&#x27;-Greek treatises (dated 945 and 971) with native pre-Christian oaths. From the eleventh century onwards, various Rus&#x27; writings were produced against the survival of Slavic religion, and Slavic gods were interpolated in the translations of foreign literary works, such as the &quot;Malalas Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Alexandreis&quot;.

The West Slavs who dwelt in the area between the Vistula and the Elbe stubbornly resisted the Northern Crusades, and the history of their resistance is written down in the eleventh- and twelfth-century &quot;Latin Chronicles&quot; by Thietmar of Merseburg, Adam of Bremen, and Helmold, three German clergymen, as well as in the twelfth-century biographies of Otto of Bamberg, and in Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; thirteenth-century &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. These documents, together with minor German writings and the Icelandic &quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot;, provide a detailed description of northwestern Slavic religion.

The religions of other Slavic populations are less well-documented as texts about them, such as the fifteenth-century &quot;Polish Chronicle&quot;, were only produced later, after Christianisation, and contain a lot of sheer inventions. In the times preceding Christianisation, however, some Greek and Roman chroniclers, such as Procopius and Jordanes in the sixth century, sparsely documented some Slavic concepts and practices.

==Overview and common features==
===Origins and other influences===

The linguistic unity and negligible dialectal differentiation of the Slavs until the end of the first millennium AD, as well as the lexical uniformity of religious vocabulary, witness a uniformity of early Slavic religion. It has been argued that the essence of early Slavdom was ethnoreligious before being ethnonational; that is to say, belonging to the Slavs was chiefly determined by conforming to certain beliefs and practices rather than by having a certain racial ancestry or being born in a certain place. Ivanov and Toporov identified the Slavic religion as an outgrowth of a purported common Proto-Indo-European religion, sharing strong similarities with other neighbouring belief systems such as those of the Balts, Thracians and Phrygians.

Local development of the ancient Slavic religion, especially in places like Russia, likely also included several influences from the neighbouring Finnic peoples, which contributed to local ethnogenesis. Slavic (and Baltic) religion and mythology is considered more conservative and closer to the purported original Proto-Indo-European religion than other Indo-European derived traditions, due to the fact that, throughout the history of the Slavs, it remained a popular religion rather than being reworked and sophisticated by intellectual elites, as had happened to other Indo-European derived religious cultures. For this reason, Slavic religion is invaluable for understanding other Indo-European beliefs.

The affinity to Proto-Indo-Iranian religion is evident in shared developments, including the elimination of the term for the supreme God of Heaven, *&quot;Dyeus&quot;, and its substitution by the term for &quot;sky&quot; (Slavic &quot;Nebo&quot;), the shift of the Indo-European descriptor of heavenly deities (Avestan &quot;daeva&quot;, Old Church Slavonic &quot;div&quot;; Proto-Indo-European *&quot;deiwos&quot;, &quot;celestial&quot;, similar to &quot;Dyeus&quot;) to the designation of evil entities, and the parallel designation of gods by the term meaning both &quot;wealth&quot; and its &quot;giver&quot; (Avestan &quot;baga&quot;, Slavic &quot;bog&quot;). Much of the religious vocabulary of the Slavs, including &quot;vera&quot; (loosely translated as &quot;faith&quot;, meaning &quot;radiation of knowledge&quot;), &quot;svet&quot; (&quot;light&quot;), &quot;mir&quot; (&quot;peace&quot;, &quot;agreement of parts&quot;, also meaning &quot;world&quot;) and &quot;rai&quot; (&quot;paradise&quot;), is shared with Iranian.

According to Adrian Ivakhiv, the Indo-European element of Slavic religion may have included what Georges Dumézil studied as the &quot;trifunctional hypothesis&quot;, that is to say a threefold conception of the social order, represented by the three castes of priests, warriors and farmers. According to Marija Gimbutas, Slavic religion represented an unmistakable overlap of any purported Indo-European-originated themes with ancient religious themes dating back to time immemorial. The latter were particularly hardwearing in Slavic religion, represented by the widespread devotion to &quot;Mat Syra Zemlya&quot;, the &quot;Damp Mother Earth&quot;. Rybakov said the continuity and gradual complexification of Slavic religion started from devotion to life-giving forces (&quot;bereginy&quot;), ancestors and the supreme God, &quot;Rod&quot; (&quot;Generation&quot; itself), and developed into the &quot;high mythology&quot; of the official religion of the early Kievan Rus&#x27;.

===God and spirits===
As attested by Helmold ( 1120–1177) in his &quot;Chronica Slavorum&quot;, the Slavs believed in a single heavenly God begetting all the lesser spirits governing nature, and worshipped it by their means. According to Helmold, &quot;obeying the duties assigned to them, [the deities] have sprung from his [the supreme God&#x27;s] blood and enjoy distinction in proportion to their nearness to the god of the gods&quot;. According to Rybakov&#x27;s studies, wheel symbols such as the &quot;thunder marks&quot; (&quot;gromovoi znak&quot;) and the &quot;six-petaled rose inside a circle&quot; (e.g. ), which are quite common in Slavic folk crafts and which were still carved on edges and peaks of roofs in northern Russia in the nineteenth century, were symbols of the supreme life-giver Rod. Before its conceptualisation as Rod, Rybakov claims, this supreme God was known as &quot;Deivos&quot; (cognate with Sanskrit &quot;Deva&quot;, Latin &quot;Deus&quot;, Old High German &quot;Ziu&quot; and Lithuanian &quot;Dievas&quot;). The Slavs believed that from this God was preceded by a cosmic duality, represented by &quot;Belobog&quot; (&quot;White God&quot;) and &quot;Chernobog&quot; (&quot;Black God&quot;, also named &quot;Tiarnoglofi&quot;, &quot;Black Head/Mind&quot;), representing the root of all the heavenly-masculine and the earthly-feminine deities, or the waxing light and waning light gods, respectively. In both categories, deities might be either &quot;Razi&quot;, &quot;rede-givers&quot;, or &quot;Zirnitra&quot;, &quot;wizards&quot;.

The Slavs perceived the world as inhabited by a variety of spirits, which they represented as persons and worshipped. These spirits included those of waters (&quot;mavka&quot; and &quot;rusalka&quot;), forests (&quot;lisovyk&quot;), fields (&quot;polyovyk&quot;), those of households (&quot;domovoy&quot;), those of illnesses, luck and human ancestors. For instance, &quot;Leshy&quot; is an important woodland spirit, believed to distribute food assigning preys to hunters, later regarded as a god of flocks and herds, and still worshipped in this function in early twentieth-century Russia. Many gods were regarded as the ancestors of individual kins (&quot;rod&quot; or &quot;pleme&quot;), and the idea of ancestrality was so important that Slavic religion may be epitomised as a &quot;manism&quot; (i.e. worship of ancestors), though the Slavs did not keep genealogical records.

The Slavs also worshipped star-gods, including the moon (Russian: &quot;Mesyats&quot;) and the sun (&quot;Solntse&quot;), the former regarded as male and the latter as female. The moon-god was particularly important, regarded as the dispenser of abundance and health, worshipped through round dances, and in some traditions considered the progenitor of humanity. The belief in the moon-god was still very much alive in the nineteenth century, and peasants in the Ukrainian Carpathians openly affirmed that the moon is their god.

Some Slavic deities are related to Baltic mythology: Perun/Perkūnas, Veles/Velnias, Rod/Dievas, Yarilo/Saulė. There was an evident continuity between the beliefs of the East Slavs, West Slavs and South Slavs. They shared the same traditional deities, as attested, for instance, by the worship of &quot;Zuarasiz&quot; among the West Slavs, corresponding to &quot;Svarožič&quot; among the East Slavs. All the bright male deities were regarded as the hypostases, forms or phases in the year, of the active and masculine divine force personified by &quot;Perun&quot; (&quot;Thunder&quot;).

Perun&#x27;s name, from the Indo-European root *&quot;per&quot; or *&quot;perkw&quot; (&quot;to strike&quot;, &quot;splinter&quot;), signified both the splintering thunder and the splintered tree (especially the oak; the Latin name of this tree, &quot;quercus&quot;, comes from the same root), regarded as symbols of the irradiation of the force. This root also gave rise to the Vedic &quot;Parjanya&quot;, the Baltic &quot;Perkūnas&quot;, the Albanian (now denoting &quot;God&quot; and &quot;sky&quot;), the Germanic &quot;Fjörgynn&quot; and the Greek &quot;Keraunós&quot; (&quot;thunderbolt&quot;, rhymic form of *&quot;Peraunós&quot;, used as an epithet of Zeus). From the exact same root comes the name of the Finnish deity Ukko, which has a Balto-Slavic origin. or , despite being rendered as or (from &quot;breg&quot;, &quot;bereg&quot;, meaning &quot;shore&quot;) and reinterpreted as female water spirits in modern Russian folklore, were rather spirits of trees and rivers related to Perun, as attested by various chronicles and highlighted by the root *&quot;per&quot;.

Slavic traditions preserved very ancient elements and intermingled with those of neighbouring European peoples. An exemplary case are the South Slavic still-living rain rituals of the couple &quot;Perun&quot;–&quot;Perperuna&quot;, Lord and Lady Thunder, shared with the neighbouring Albanians, Greeks and Arumanians.

The West Slavs, especially those of the Baltic, prominently worshipped &quot;Svetovid&quot; (&quot;Lord of Power&quot;), while the East Slavs prominently worshipped Perun himself, especially after Vladimir&#x27;s 970s–980s reforms. The various spirits were believed to manifest in certain places, which were revered as numinous and holy; they included springs, rivers, groves, rounded tops of hills and flat cliffs overlooking rivers. Calendrical rituals were attuned with the spirits, which were believed to have periods of waxing and waning throughout the year, determining the agrarian fertility cycle.

===Cosmology, iconography, temples and rites===


The cosmology of ancient Slavic religion, which is preserved in contemporary Slavic folk religion, is visualised as a three-tiered vertical structure, or &quot;world tree&quot;, as is common in other Indo-European religions. At the top there is the heavenly plane, symbolised by birds, the sun and the moon; the middle plane is that of earthly humanity, symbolised by bees and men; at the bottom of the structure there is the netherworld, symbolised by snakes and beavers, and by the chthonic god &quot;Veles&quot;. The Zbruch Idol found in western Ukraine (which was at first identified as a representation of Svetovid) represents this theo-cosmology: the three-layered effigy of the four major deities—&quot;Perun&quot;, &quot;Dazhbog&quot;, &quot;Mokosh&quot; and &quot;Lada&quot;—is constituted by a top level with four figures representing them, facing the four cardinal directions; a middle level with representations of a human ritual community (&quot;khorovod&quot;); and a bottom level with the representation of a three-headed chthonic god, Veles, who sustains the entire structure.

The scholar Jiří Dynda studied the figure of &quot;Triglav&quot; (literally &quot;the Three-Headed One&quot;) and Svetovid, which are widely attested in archaeological testimonies, as the respectively three-headed and four-headed representations of the same &quot;axis mundi&quot;, of the same supreme God. Triglav itself was connected to the symbols of the tree and the mountain, which are other common symbols of the &quot;axis mundi&quot;, and in this quality he was a &quot;summus deus&quot; (a sum of all things), as recorded by Ebbo ( 775–851).

Triglav represents the vertical interconnection of the three worlds, reflected by the three social functions studied by Dumézil: sacerdotal, martial and economic. Ebbo himself documented that the Triglav was seen as embodying the connection and mediation between Heaven, Earth and the underworld. Adam of Bremen ( 1040s–1080s) described the Triglav of Wolin as &quot;Neptunus triplicis naturae&quot; (that is to say, &quot;Neptune of the three natures/generations&quot;), attesting the colours that were attributed to the three worlds, also studied by Karel Jaromír Erben (1811–1870): white for Heaven, green for Earth and black for the underworld.

It also represents the three dimensions of time, mythologically rendered in the figure of a three-threaded rope. Triglav is Perun in the heavenly plane, Svetovid in the centre from which the horizontal four directions unfold, and Veles the psychopomp in the underworld. Svetovid is interpreted by Dynda as the incarnation of the &quot;axis mundi&quot; in the four dimensions of space. Helmold defined Svetovid as &quot;deus deorum&quot; (&quot;god of all gods&quot;).

Alongside Triglav and Svetovid, other deities were also represented with many heads. This is attested by chroniclers who wrote about West Slavs, including Saxo Grammaticus ( 1160–1220). According to him, &quot;Rugievit&quot; in Charenza was represented with seven faces, which converged at the top in a single crown. These three-, four- or many-headed images, wooden or carved in stone, some covered in metal, which held drinking horns and were decorated with solar symbols and horses, were kept in temples, of which numerous archaeological remains have been found.

They were built on upraised platforms, frequently on hills, but also at the confluences of rivers. The biographers of Otto of Bamberg (1060/1061–1139) inform that these temples were known as , &quot;dwellings&quot;, among West Slavs, testifying that they were regarded as the houses of the gods. They were wooden buildings with an inner cell with the god&#x27;s statue, located in wider walled enclosures or fortifications; such fortifications might contain up to four .

Different were owned by different kins, and used for the ritual banquets in honour of their own ancestor-gods. These ritual banquets are known variously, across Slavic countries, as &quot;bratchina&quot; (from &quot;brat&quot;, &quot;brother&quot;), &quot;mol&#x27;ba&quot; (&quot;entreaty&quot;, &quot;supplication&quot;) and &quot;kanun&quot; (short religious service) in Russia; &quot;slava&quot; (&quot;glorification&quot;) in Serbia; &quot;sobor&quot; (&quot;assembly&quot;) and &quot;kurban&quot; (&quot;sacrifice&quot;) in Bulgaria. With Christianisation, the ancestor-gods were replaced with Christian patron saints.

There also existed holy places with no buildings, where the deity was believed to manifest in nature itself. Such locations were characterised by the combined presence of trees and springs, according to the description of one such sites in Szczecin by Otto of Bamberg. A shrine of the same type in Kobarid, contemporary Slovenia, was stamped out in a &quot;crusade&quot; as recently as 1331.

Usually, common people were not allowed into the presence of the images of their gods, the sight of which was a privilege of the priests. Many of these images were seen and described only in the moment of their violent destruction at the hands of the Christian missionaries. The priests (&quot;volkhv&quot;s), who kept the temples and led rituals and festivals, enjoyed a great degree of prestige; they received tributes and shares of military booties by the kins&#x27; chiefs.

Some of the stone idols of the northeastern Slavs looked like mushrooms, without a face and with a clearly distinguished hat. Moreover, such idols were made by hand through turning a boulder upside-down and giving it the shape of a mushroom. The medieval manuscript of the 11th–14th centuries &quot;The Word of St. Gregory, Invented in Toltsekh&quot; contains a direct indication that the Slavs worshiped such phallic idols. According to some researchers, such idols were dedicated to Rod or Veles (according to local old folklore, stone mushrooms are dedicated to Veles).

Due to the fact that these idols had no face, they were not destroyed. According to the beliefs of the local population, such stone idols had healing properties, so they were regularly visited. On certain days, people brought gifts to them, and in order to receive healing from an illness, they had to sit on an idol. The stone mushroom was respected and protected. Disrespectful attitude towards this idol was not allowed. The keepers of traditions and rituals performed around the idol were elderly women, and the tradition was passed down through generations.

There are also beliefs that such stone mushrooms provided fertility for the soil and people. Therefore, in some places, the worship of these idols persisted for centuries until the end of the 20th century (and even after being transferred to a museum, elements of the rituals are still performed). The dating of stone mushrooms is only approximate, most dating back to about 1000 AD. The stone mushroom idols are very similar to two Slavic stone idols from the northeastern regions: Sheksna idol (in Novgorod museum, Novgorod region, Russia) and Sebej idol (Sebej museum, Pskov region, Russia). These Slavic idols have a face and a phallic shape. Their characteristic feature is a hat.

An ancient Slavic stone idol was discovered on the territory of the Nikolo-Babaevsky monastery (Nekrasovsky district) in 2020. An ancient pagan place that existed before the monastery and churches is mentioned in the ethnographic materials of Bogdanovich. In that place, on Babayki, the idol of the supreme heavenly god was worshiped. The discovered Babaevsky idol has a clear shape of a large mushroom, completely carved from a boulder. It is very similar to mushroom idols from the local cities of Ples and Myshkin. Based on morphological details, the multifaceted cult function of this idol is assumed—fertility not only for the land and forest, but also fertility for humans.

==History==
===Amongst the South Slavs===
A form of the ancient, Slavic polytheistic religion was practised by the South Slavs (including the Croats and Serbs) prior to Christianisation. They came into contact with Christianity during the reign of emperor Heraclius (610-641), continued by Rome, and baptization process ended during the rule of Basil I (867-886) by Byzantine missionaries of Constantinople Cyril and Methodius.

===Kievan Rus&#x27; official religion and popular cults===

In 980 CE, in Kievan Rus&#x27;, led by the Great Prince Vladimir, there was an attempt to unify the various beliefs and priestly practices of Slavic religion in order to bind together the Slavic peoples in the growing centralised state. Vladimir canonised a number of deities, to whom he erected a temple on the hills of the capital Kiev. These deities, recorded in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, were five: &quot;Perun&quot;, &quot;Xors Dazhbog&quot;, &quot;Stribog&quot;, &quot;Simargl&quot; and &quot;Mokosh&quot;. Various other deities were worshipped by the common people, notably Veles who had a temple in the merchant&#x27;s district of Podil of the capital itself. According to scholars, Vladimir&#x27;s project consisted of a number of reforms that he had already started by the 970s, and which were aimed at preserving the traditions of the kins and making Kiev the spiritual centre of East Slavdom.

Perun was the god of thunder, law and war, symbolised by the oak and the mallet (or throwing stones), and identified with the Baltic &quot;Perkunas&quot;, the Germanic &quot;Thor&quot; and the Vedic &quot;Indra&quot; among others; his cult was practised not so much by commoners but mainly by the aristocracy. Veles was the god of horned livestock (&quot;Skotibog&quot;), of wealth and of the underworld. Perun and Veles symbolised an oppositional and yet complementary duality similar to that of the Vedic &quot;Mitra&quot; and &quot;Varuna&quot;, an eternal struggle between heavenly and chthonic forces. Roman Jakobson himself identified Veles as the Vedic Varuna, god of oaths and of the world order. This belief in a cosmic duality was likely the reason that led to the exclusion of Veles from Vladimir&#x27;s official temple in Kiev. Xors Dazhbog (&quot;Radiant Giving-God&quot;) was the god of the life-bringing power of the sun. Stribog was identified by E. G. Kagarov as the god of wind, storm and dissension. Mokosh, the only female deity in Vladimir&#x27;s pantheon, is interpreted as meaning the &quot;Wet&quot; or &quot;Moist&quot; by Jakobson, identifying her with the Mat Syra Zemlya (&quot;Damp Mother Earth&quot;) of later folk religion.

According to Ivanits, written sources from the Middle Ages &quot;leave no doubt whatsoever&quot; that the common Slavic peoples continued to worship their indigenous deities and hold their rituals for centuries after Kievan Rus&#x27; official baptism into Christianity, and the lower clergy of the newly formed Orthodox Christian church often joined the celebrations. The high clergy repeatedly condemned, through official admonitions, the worship of &quot;Rod&quot; and the &quot;Rozhanitsy&quot; (&quot;God and the Goddesses&quot;, or &quot;Generation and the generatrixes&quot;) with offerings of bread, porridge, cheese and mead. Scholars of Russian religion define &quot;Rod&quot; as the &quot;general power of birth and reproduction&quot; and the &quot;Rozhanitsy&quot; as the &quot;mistresses of individual destiny&quot;. Kagarov identified the later &quot;Domovoi&quot;, the god of the household and kinship ancestry, as a specific manifestation of Rod. Other gods attested in medieval documents remain largely mysterious, for instance &quot;Lada&quot; and her sons &quot;Lel&quot; and &quot;Polel&quot;, who are often identified by scholars with the Greek gods &quot;Leda&quot; or &quot;Leto&quot; and her twin sons &quot;Castor&quot; and &quot;Pollux&quot;. Other figures who in medieval documents are often presented as deities, such as &quot;Kupala&quot; and &quot;Koliada&quot;, were rather the personifications of the spirits of agrarian holidays.

===Christianisation of the East Slavs===

====Vladimir&#x27;s baptism, popular resistance and syncretism====
In 988, Vladimir of Kievan Rus&#x27; rejected Slavic religion and he and his subjects were officially baptised into the Eastern Orthodox Church, then the state religion of the Byzantine Empire. According to legend, Vladimir sent delegates to foreign states to determine what was the most convincing religion to be adopted by Kiev. Joyfulness and beauty were the primary characteristics of pre-Christian Slavic ceremonies, and the delegates sought something capable of matching these qualities. They were crestfallen by the Islamic religion of Volga Bulgaria, where they found &quot;no joy ... but sorrow and great stench&quot;, and by Western Christianity (then the Catholic Church) where they found &quot;many worship services, but nowhere ... beauty&quot;. Those who visited Constantinople were instead impressed by the arts and rituals of Byzantine Christianity. According to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, after the choice was made Vladimir commanded that the Slavic temple on the Kiev hills be destroyed and the effigies of the gods be burned or thrown into the Dnieper. Slavic temples were destroyed throughout the lands of Kievan Rus&#x27; and Christian churches were built in their places.

According to Ivakhiv, Christianisation was stronger in what is today western and central Ukraine, lands close to the capital Kiev. Slavic religion persisted, however, especially in northernmost regions of Slavic settlement, in what is today the central part of European Russia, such as the areas of Novgorod, Suzdal and Belozersk. In the core regions of Christianisation themselves the common population remained attached to the &quot;volkhv&quot;s, the priests, who periodically, over centuries, led popular rebellions against the central power and the Christian church. Christianisation was a very slow process among the Slavs, and the official Christian church adopted a policy of co-opting pre-Christian elements into Slavic Christianity. Christian saints were identified with Slavic gods—for instance, the figure of Perun was overlapped with that of Saint Elias, Veles was identified with Saint Blasius, and Yarilo became Saint George—and Christian festivals were set on the same dates as pagan ones.

Another feature of early Slavic Christianity was the strong influence of apocryphal literature, which became evident by the thirteenth century with the rise of Bogomilism among the South Slavs. South Slavic Bogomilism produced a large amount of apocryphal texts and their teachings later penetrated into Russia, and would have influenced later Slavic folk religion. Bernshtam tells of a &quot;flood&quot; of apocryphal literature in eleventh- to fifteenth-century Russia, which might not have been controlled by the still-weak Russian Orthodox Church.

====Continuity of Slavic religion in Russia up to the 15th century====
Some scholars have highlighted how the &quot;conversion of Rus&quot; took place no more than eight years after Vladimir&#x27;s reform of Slavic religion in 980; according to them, Christianity in general did not have &quot;any deep influence ... in the formation of the ideology, culture and social psychology of archaic societies&quot; and the introduction of Christianity in Kiev &quot;did not bring about a radical change in the consciousness of the society during the entire course of early Russian history&quot;. It was portrayed as a mass and conscious conversion only by half a century later, by the scribes of the Christian establishment. According to some scholars, the replacement of Slavic temples with Christian churches and the &quot;baptism of Rus&quot; has to be understood in continuity with the foregoing chain of reforms of Slavic religion launched by Vladimir, rather than as a breaking point.

V. G. Vlasov quotes the respected scholar of Slavic religion E. V. Anichkov, who, regarding Russia&#x27;s Christianisation, said:
According to Vlasov the ritual of baptism and mass conversion undergone by Vladimir in 988 was never repeated in the centuries to follow, and mastery of Christian teachings was never accomplished on the popular level even by the start of the twentieth century. According to him, a nominal, superficial identification with Christianity was possible with the superimposition of a Christianised agrarian calendar (&quot;Christmas–Easter–Whitsunday&quot;) over the indigenous complex of festivals, &quot;Koliada–Yarilo–Kupala&quot;. The analysis of the Christianised agrarian and ritual calendar, combined with data from popular astronomy, leads to determine that the Julian calendar associated with the Orthodox Church was adopted by Russian peasants between the sixteenth and seventeenth century. It was by this period that much of the Russian population became officially part of the Orthodox Church and therefore nominally Christians. This occurred as an effect of a broader complex of phenomena which Russia underwent by the fifteenth century, that is to say radical changes towards a centralisation of state power, which involved urbanisation, bureaucratisation and the consolidation of serfdom of the peasantry.

That the vast majority of the Russian population was not Christian back in the fifteenth century may possibly be evidenced by archaeology: according to Vlasov, mound (&quot;kurgan&quot;) burials, which do not reflect Christian norms, were &quot;a universal phenomenon in Russia up to the fifteenth century&quot;, and persisted into the 1530s. Moreover, chronicles from that period, such as the &quot;Pskov Chronicles&quot;, and archaeological data collected by N. M. Nikolsky, testify that back in the fifteenth century there were still &quot;no rural churches for the general use of the populace; churches existed only at the courts of boyars and princes&quot;. It was only by the sixteenth century that the Russian Orthodox Church grew as a powerful, centralising institution taking the Catholic Church of Rome as a model, and the distinctiveness of a Slavic folk religion became evident. The church condemned &quot;heresies&quot; and tried to eradicate the &quot;false half-pagan&quot; folk religion of the common people, but these measures coming from the centres of church power were largely ineffective, and on the local level creative syntheses of folk religious rituals and holidays continued to thrive.

====Sunwise Slavic religion, withershins Christianity, and Old Belief====

When the incorporation of the Russian population into Christianity became substantial in the middle of the sixteenth century, the Russian Orthodox Church absorbed further elements of pre-Christian and popular tradition and underwent a transformation of its architecture, with the adoption of the hipped roof which was traditionally associated with pre-Christian Slavic temples. The most significant change, however, was the adoption of the sunwise—or clockwise—direction in Christian ritual procession.

Christianity is characterised by withershins ritual movement, that is to say, movement against the course of the sun. This was also the case in Slavic Christianity before the sixteenth century. Sunwise movements are instead characteristic of Slavic religion, evident in the &quot;khorovod&quot;, ritual circle-dance, which magically favours the development of things. Withershins movement was employed in popular rituals, too, though only in those occasions when it was considered worthwhile to act against the course of nature, in order to alter the state of affairs.

When Patriarch Nikon of Moscow launched his reform of the Orthodox Church in 1656, he restored the withershins ritual movement. This was among the changes that led to a schism (&quot;raskol&quot;) within Russian Orthodoxy, between those who accepted the reforms and the Old Believers, who preserved instead the &quot;ancient piety&quot; derived from indigenous Slavic religion. A large number of Russians and ethnic minorities converted to the movement of the Old Believers, in the broadest meaning of the term—including a variety of folk religions—pointed out by Bernshtam, and these Old Believers were a significant part of the settlers of broader European Russia and Siberia throughout the second half of the seventeenth century, which saw the expansion of the Russian state in these regions. Old Believers were distinguished by their cohesion, literacy and initiative, and constantly emerging new religious sects tended to identify themselves with the movement. This posed a great hitch to the Russian Orthodox Church&#x27;s project of thorough Christianisation of the masses. Veletskaya highlighted how the Old Believers have preserved early Slavic pagan ideas and practices such as the veneration of fire as a channel to the divine world, the symbolism of the colour red, the search for a &quot;glorious death&quot;, and more in general the holistic vision of a divine cosmos.

===Christianisation of the West Slavs===
In the opinion of Norman Davies, the Christianisation of Poland through the Czech–Polish alliance represented a conscious choice on the part of Polish rulers to ally themselves with the Czech state rather than the German one. The Moravian cultural influence played a significant role in the spread of Christianity onto the Polish lands and the subsequent adoption of that religion. Christianity arrived around the late 9th century, most likely around the time when the Vistulan tribe encountered the Christian rite in dealings with their neighbours, the Great Moravia (Bohemian) state. The &quot;Baptism of Poland&quot; refers to the ceremony when the first ruler of the Polish state, Mieszko I and much of his court, converted to Christianity on the Holy Saturday of 14 April 966.

In the eleventh century, Slavic pagan culture was &quot;still in full working order&quot; among the West Slavs. Christianity faced popular opposition, including an uprising in the 1030s (particularly intense in the years of 1035–1037). By the twelfth century, however, under the pressure of Germanisation, Catholicism was forcefully imposed through the Northern Crusades, and temples and images of Slavic religion were violently destroyed. West Slavic populations held out vigorously against Christianisation. One of the most famous instances of popular resistance occurred at the temple-stronghold of Svetovid at Cape Arkona, in Rugia. The temple at Arkona had a squared groundplan, with an inner hall sustained by four pillars which contained Svetovid&#x27;s statue. The latter had four heads, shown beardless and cleanshaven after the Rugian fashion. In its right hand the statue held a horn of precious metal, which was used for divination during the yearly great festival of the god. In 1168, Arkona surrendered to the Danish troops of King Valdemar I, and the bishop Absalon led the destruction of the temple of Svetovid.

===Slavic folk religion===
Ethnography in late-nineteenth-century Ukraine documented a &quot;thorough synthesis of pagan and Christian elements&quot; in Slavic folk religion, a system often called &quot;double belief&quot; (Russian: &quot;dvoeverie&quot;, Ukrainian: &quot;dvovirya&quot;). According to Bernshtam, &quot;dvoeverie&quot; is still used to this day in scholarly works to define Slavic folk religion, which is seen by certain scholars as having preserved much of pre-Christian Slavic religion, &quot;poorly and transparently&quot; covered by a Christianity that may be easily &quot;stripped away&quot; to reveal more or less &quot;pure&quot; patterns of the original faith. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union there has been a new wave of scholarly debate on the subjects of Slavic folk religion and &quot;dvoeverie&quot;. A. E. Musin, an academic and deacon of the Russian Orthodox Church, published an article about the &quot;problem of double belief&quot; as recently as 1991. In this article he divides scholars between those who say that Russian Orthodoxy adapted to entrenched indigenous faith, continuing the Soviet idea of an &quot;undefeated paganism&quot;, and those who say that Russian Orthodoxy is an out-and-out syncretic religion. Bernshtam challenges dualistic notions of &quot;dvoeverie&quot; and proposes interpreting broader Slavic religiosity as a &quot;mnogoverie&quot; (&quot;multifaith&quot;) continuum, in which a higher layer of Orthodox Christian officialdom is alternated with a variety of &quot;Old Beliefs&quot; among the various strata of the population.

According to Ivanits, nineteenth- and twentieth-century Slavic folk religion&#x27;s central concern was fertility, propitiated with rites celebrating death and resurrection. Scholars of Slavic religion who focused on nineteenth-century folk religion were often led to mistakes such as the interpretation of &quot;Rod&quot; and &quot;Rozhanitsy&quot; as figures of a merely ancestral cult; however, in medieval documents Rod is equated with the ancient Egyptian god Osiris, representing a broader concept of natural generativity. Belief in the holiness of &quot;Mat Syra Zemlya&quot; (&quot;Damp Mother Earth&quot;) is another feature that has persisted into modern Slavic folk religion; up to the twentieth century, Russian peasants practiced a variety of rituals devoted to her and confessed their sins to her in the absence of a priest. Ivanits also reports that in the region of Vladimir old people practiced a ritual asking Earth&#x27;s forgiveness before their death. A number of scholars attributed the Russians&#x27; particular devotion to the &quot;Theotokos&quot;, the &quot;Mother of God&quot;, to this still powerful pre-Christian substratum of devotion to a great mother goddess.

Ivanits attributes the tenacity of synthetic Slavic folk religion to an exceptionality of Slavs and of Russia in particular, compared to other European countries; &quot;the Russian case is extreme&quot;, she says, because Russia—especially the vastness of rural Russia—neither lived the intellectual upheavals of the Renaissance, nor the Reformation, nor the Age of Enlightenment, which severely weakened folk spirituality in the rest of Europe.

Slavic folk religious festivals and rites reflect the times of the ancient pagan calendar. For instance, the Christmas period is marked by the rites of &quot;Koliada&quot;, characterised by the element of fire, processions and ritual drama, offerings of food and drink to the ancestors. Spring and summer rites are characterised by fire- and water-related imagery spinning around the figures of the gods &quot;Yarilo&quot;, &quot;Kupala&quot; and &quot;Marzanna&quot;. The switching of seasonal spirits is celebrated through the interaction of effigies of these spirits and the elements which symbolise the coming season, such as by burning, drowning or setting the effigies onto water, and the &quot;rolling of burning wheels of straw down into rivers&quot;.

===Modern Rodnovery===
Since the early twentieth century there has been a reinvention and reinstitutionalisation of &quot;Slavic religion&quot; in the so-called movement of &quot;Rodnovery&quot;, literally &quot;Slavic Native Faith&quot;. The movement draws from ancient Slavic folk religion, often combining it with philosophical underpinnings taken from other religions, mainly Hinduism. Some Rodnover groups focus almost exclusively on folk religions and the worship of gods at the right times of the year, while others have developed a scriptural core, represented by writings purported to be centuries-old documents such as the &quot;Book of Veles&quot;; writings which elaborate powerful national mythologemes such as the &quot;Maha Vira&quot; of Sylenkoism; and esoteric writings such as the &quot;Slavo-Aryan Vedas&quot; of Ynglism.

==Reconstructed calendar of celebrations==

Linda J. Ivanits reconstructed a basic calendar of the celebrations of the most important Slavic gods among East Slavs, based on Boris Rybakov&#x27;s studies on ancient agricultural calendars, especially a fourth-century one from an area around Kiev.
==Influence on Christian art and architecture==

The Old Russian architecture of churches originates from the pre-Christian Slavic ( - construction/architecture). This pagan style had a great influence on the entire architecture of ancient Russia, including the structure and decoration of churches and the art of icon painting.

On this occasion, the researcher Boris Grekov wrote:

The peculiarity of ancient Russian architecture was also manifested in the appearance of the domes themselves, the most famous of which is the onion dome.

The historian Alexander Zamaleev suggests that the orientation of ancient Russian architects on pagan foundations is explained primarily by the difference in building materials: in Byzantium, the construction of temples was carried out from stone and marble, while in ancient Russia wooden architecture prevailed. This choice of material also led to the emergence of many architectural trends, including the so-called &quot;tent architecture&quot;. The earliest wooden churches in shape and plan were a square or oblong quadrangle with a tower-shaped dome planted on it, similar to those that were placed in ancient Russian fortresses. Above the dome, under the cross, another chapter was being built, resembling an onion.

Outside and inside the temples were decorated with various carvings, often in the traditions of the pagan style. Later, this tradition was transferred to the stone church architecture.

A distinctive feature of the Old Russian architectural thinking was the attraction to high-rise composition. This was manifested not only in the creation of tower-like churches (moreover, the &quot;polydoming&quot; and pyramidal composition, which was absent in the Byzantine culture, was highly appreciated), but also in the choice of a high place for religious buildings.

Most often, the vaults in the Old Russian churches are represented in the form of &quot;kokoshniks&quot; (semicircular vaults with a protruding sharp middle) and &quot;zakomara&quot; (semicircular protruding end of the outer section of the wall).

Meanwhile, Christianity had an impact on the Old Russian funeral rites: corpse-burning was replaced with burial. However, among the common population, there is a memory of triangular mounds piled up over the burned body of the deceased. Later, this custom developed into the construction of a &quot;roof&quot; over the cross, the so-called &quot;golubets&quot;.

This style gained immense popularity in the Russian Empire, thereby reviving in the form of Neo-Russian architecture.

<text>The South Manchuria Railway (; ), officially , Mantetsu () or Mantie () for short, was a large of the Empire of Japan whose primary function was the operation of railways on the Dalian–Fengtian (Mukden)–Changchun (called Xinjing from 1931 to 1945) corridor in northeastern China, as well as on several branch lines.

In 1905, after Russia&#x27;s defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, this area was taken over by Japan as the South Manchuria Railway Zone. Mantetsu was established in 1906 to operate the railways taken over from the Russians. Subsequently, Mantetsu expanded by building new lines for itself and for Chinese-owned undertakings, and after the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932, it was also entrusted with the management of the Manchukuo National Railway. Between 1917 and 1925, Mantetsu was also responsible for the management of the Chōsen Government Railway in Japanese-occupied Korea.

However, it was also involved in nearly every aspect of the economic, cultural and political life of Manchuria, from power generation to agricultural research, for which reason it was often referred to as &quot;Japan&#x27;s East India Company in China&quot;. Nisshō Inoue, the founder of the interwar Japanese far-right militant organization Ketsumeidan (血盟団, League of Blood), was employed by &quot;Mantetsu&quot; from 1909 to 1920.

In 1945, the Soviet Union invaded and overran Manchukuo, and following Japan&#x27;s defeat in the Pacific War, Mantetsu itself was dissolved by order of the American occupation authorities in occupied Japan. The railway was operated by the Soviets for a time, and handed over to China Railway after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. Fengtian has been called Shenyang since 1945, and the line from there to Dalian is today part of the Shenda Railway from Changchun to Dalian, whilst the Shenyang–Changchun section is now part of the Jingha Railway; the branch lines have also been part of China Railway since then.

==History==

The main line from Changchun to Port Arthur, as Luishun was called under Russian rule, was built between 1898 and 1903 by the Russians as the southern branch of their Chinese Eastern Railway according to the 1896 secret treaty and the 1898 lease convention between Qing China and Imperial Russia in the aftermath of the First Sino-Japanese War.
Following the Japanese victory over Imperial Russia in 1905 after the Russo-Japanese War and the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth, most of the southern branch (Harbin—Port Arthur) of the China Eastern Railway was transferred to Japanese control. The last station remaining in Russian hands was at Kuanchengzi () in modern-day Changchun. The northernmost Japanese-controlled station was the Changchun railway station.

Under the authorization of Emperor Meiji, Japan then established a new semi-privately held company, the South Manchurian Railway Company (a.k.a. &quot;Mantetsu&quot;), with a capitalization of 200 million yen to operate the railroad and to develop settlements and industries along its route. The organizing committee was headed by General Kodama Gentarō, and after his death, by General Terauchi Masatake. Count Gotō Shimpei, formerly the Japanese governor of Taiwan, was appointed the first president of the company, and the headquarters was established in Tokyo before relocated to Dalian in 1907.

One of the first tasks of the new company was to change the railway gauge. The rail line was originally built according to the gauge of , during the war it had been converted by the advancing Japanese troops to the Japanese gauge, in order to facilitate the use of rolling stock brought from Japan. But once the new Japanese South Manchuria Railway Company took possession of the line, it had the tracks re-gauged again, now to the gauge of , presumably with an eye to connecting the system to other railways of China.

In 1907, an agreement was reached between the Japanese and Russian authorities about connecting the Japanese South Manchuria Railway with the line to the north, which remained in the hands of Russian China Far East Railway. According to the agreement, Russian gauge tracks would continue from the &quot;Russian&quot; Kuanchengzi Station to the &quot;Japanese&quot; Changchun station, and vice versa, tracks on the &quot;gauge adapted by the South Manchuria Railway&quot; (i.e., the standard gauge) would continue from the Changchun Station to the Kuancheng Station.

By the end of 1907, the company employed 9,000 Japanese and 4,000 Chinese. By 1910, those numbers had increased to 35,000 and 25,000 respectively. The railway used a significant amount of U.S.-made rails and signaling equipment, as well as some steam locomotives built by the American Locomotive Company at Dunkirk, NY. A visiting executive from the Erie Railroad was quite impressed with the arrangement, and described South Manchurian Railway ca. 1913 as &quot;the only railroad in the whole world that is like our American railroads (and they are, fairly speaking, the best)&quot;.

&quot;Mantetsu&quot; quickly expanded the system inherited from Russia to staggering proportions, building coal mines at Fushun and Yantai, and harbor facilities at Andong, Yingkou, and Dalian. At each station, &quot;Mantetsu&quot; built hotels for travelers and warehouses for goods. Japanese settlers were encouraged through the construction of schools, libraries, hospitals and public utilities. The &quot;Mantetsu&quot; Research Wing was the centerpiece of Japan&#x27;s colonial program, and instigated agricultural research into development of soybean farming. Land under cultivation expanded 70% in 20 years.

From 1916, &quot;Mantestu&quot; began to spin off a number of subsidiary companies, including Showa Steel Works, Dalian Ceramics, Dalian Oil &amp; Fat, South Manchurian Glass, as well as flour mills, sugar mills, electrical power plants, shale oil plants and chemical plants.

On 31 July 1917, the management of the Chosen Government Railway (&quot;Sentetsu&quot;) in Japanese-occupied Korea was transferred from the Railway Bureau of the Government-General of Korea to Mantetsu, which established the Mantetsu Keijō/Gyeongseong Railway Administration (, ; , &quot;Mancheol Gyeongseong Gwalliguk&quot;), and under Mantetsu control Korea&#x27;s railway network was expanded rapidly. On 1 April 1925, management of Sentetsu was returned to the Railway Bureau, though Mantetsu retained control of the line along the Korea–Manchuria border from the port of Najin in Korea to Tumen in Manchuria and to Sangsambong in Korea. Mantetsu called this line the North Chosen Line, and it remained under Mantetsu control until 1945.

Company assets rose from 163 million yen in 1908 to over a billion yen in 1930. &quot;Mantetsu&quot; was by far the largest corporation in Japan, and also its most profitable, averaging rates of return from 25 to 45 percent per year. During the 1920s, Mantetsu provided for over a quarter of the Japanese government&#x27;s tax revenues.

Over 75% of &quot;Mantetsu&#x27;s&quot; income was generated by its freight business, with the key to profitability coming from soybean exports, both to Japan proper and to Europe. Soybean production increased exponentially with increasing demand for soy oil, and for soy meal for use in fertilizer and animal feed. By 1927, half of the world&#x27;s supply of soybean was from Manchuria and the efforts by &quot;Mantetsu&quot; to expand production and to ship to export ports was a classic example of an extractive colonial economy dependent on a single product.

In 1931, the Mukden Incident occurred, where the Japanese military faked an attack on the railway by Chinese partisans as a pretext for the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.
&quot;Mantetsu&quot; was also charged with a government-like role in managing the rail transportation system after the formation of Manchukuo in 1932, including management of the (theoretically independent) Manchukuo National Railway. By 1938, Mantetsu had 72 subsidiary companies, development projects in 25 urban areas and carried 17,515,000 passengers per year. Between 1930 and 1940, the Japanese population of Manchukuo rose by 800,000 making ethnic Japanese the majority in many of the towns and cities served by &quot;Mantetsu&quot;. &quot;Mantetsu&quot; prided itself on state-of-the-art urban planning, with modern sewer systems, public parks, and creative modern architecture far in advance of what could be found in Japan itself. These things were possible due to &quot;Mantetsu&#x27;s&quot; tremendous profitability, and its political power to seize property and silence opposition and dissent at will through its political connections to the military and totalitarian national leadership.

In 1932, the Kwantung Army requested that the South Manchuria Railway establish an Economic Research Team. This team drafted many of Manchukuo&#x27;s early economic policies and emphasized state control over the economy.

In 1934, &quot;Mantetsu&quot; inaugurated the &quot;Asia Express&quot;, a high speed train from Dalian to the Manchukuo capital of Xinjing (Changchun). Reaching a top speed of , the &quot;Asia Express&quot; was the fastest scheduled train in Asia at the time.

Changchun remained the break of gauge point between the Russian and standard gauges in the 1930s, until the Chinese Eastern railway itself was bought by Manchukuo and converted to the standard gauge in the mid-1930s.

In 1936, the company owned 466 locomotives, 554 coaches and 8134 goods wagons.

In 1945, the Soviet Union invaded and overran Manchukuo. Rolling stock and movable equipment was looted and taken back to the Soviet Union; some was returned when the Chinese Communist government came into power. &quot;Mantetsu&quot; itself was dissolved by order of the American occupation authorities in occupied Japan. The People&#x27;s Republic of China government later merged the northern half of the South Manchuria Railway&#x27;s mainline (the Renkyō Line) with other railway lines to form the present Beijing–Harbin railway.

===Railway dining car service===
In conjunction with magazine advertising by Japan Tourist Bureau (JTB), the railway attempted to create a unique food culture in Manchukuo. They offered a variety of special cuisine such as Yamato beef steak, Mongolian barbeque, and sorghum vulgare (kaoliang) confectionery in dining cars along the line and in the railway-operated Yamato Hotel. There was little uptake in the cuisine however after the fall of Manchukuo.

<text>Sean McKeown (January 1, 1944 - July 11, 2002) was an American herpetologist, writer, and advocate for Hawaiian wildlife preservation. He was the former curator of reptiles at the Honolulu Zoo and published frequently on reptiles and amphibians.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Sean McKeown was born January 1, 1944, in Los Angeles, California. As a child, he lived briefly in western Pennsylvania, then returned to California to attend elementary through high school. McKeown graduated from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1967 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science. He attended California State University for graduate school, receiving his master&#x27;s degree in biological sciences and anthropology in 1973.

===Career===
McKeown moved to Hawaii in 1975 and took a job at the Honolulu Zoo. He became supervising herpetologist at the zoo, where he expanded the zoo&#x27;s reptile population and developed a number of breeding programs for some lizard and tortoise species. 

In 1983, McKeown and his staff received the Edward Bean Award for conservation from the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums, for breeding the endangered Madagascar ploughshare tortoise. Later that year, McKeown returned to California, where he became curator of reptiles for Fresno&#x27;s Chaffee Zoological Gardens. He received another American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums award in 1986 for captive breeding of Madagascar ground boas.

McKeown did field work for the wildlife departments of Aruba, New Zealand, the Seychelles, Mauritius, Hawaii, and Guam. In the Seychelles, he oversaw the construction of an egg incubator for Aldabra giant tortoises, while in Aruba, he studied the Aruba Island rattlesnake. He was also an advocate for wildlife preservation in Hawaii, working with former Honolulu Zoo director Paul Breese to prevent the spread of brown tree snakes to the islands.

In 1990, McKeown became managing editor of &quot;The Vivarium&quot; magazine. He wrote more than 100 articles about breeding and caring for reptiles and amphibians.

===Later life===
McKeown was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in 1996 and received a heart transplant in April 2000 from Stanford Medical Center. On July 11, 2002, he died and was survived by his wife, Wendy, and children Dorie and Casey.

<text>A drive-in theater/theatre or drive-in cinema is a form of cinema structure consisting of a large outdoor movie screen, a projection booth, a concession stand, and a large parking area for automobiles. Within this enclosed area, customers can view movies from the privacy and comfort of their cars. Some drive-ins have small playgrounds for children and a few picnic tables or benches.

The screen can be as simple as a painted white wall, or it can be a steel truss structure with a complex finish. Originally, the movie&#x27;s sound was provided by speakers on the screen and later by individual speakers hung from the window of each car, which was attached to a small pole by a wire. These speaker systems were superseded by the more practical method of microbroadcasting the soundtrack to car radios. This also has two advantages: 1. the film soundtrack to be heard in stereo on car stereo systems, which are typically of much higher quality and fidelity than the basic small mono speakers used in the old systems; and 2. it prevents the driver from forgetting the speaker is attached to their window, and driving off, which breaks: the cord connecting the speaker to the sound system, the driver&#x27;s side window, or both.

== History ==

=== Early drive-ins (before WWII) ===
A partial drive-in theater—Theatre de Guadalupe—was opened in Las Cruces, New Mexico on April 23, 1915:
Seven hundred people may be comfortably seated in the auditorium. Automobile entrances and places for 40 or more cars within the theater grounds and in-line position to see the pictures and witness all performances on the stage is a feature of the place that will please car owners.

The first movie shown by the Theatre de Guadalupe was &quot;Bags of Gold&quot;, produced by Siegmund Lubin. Theatre de Guadalupe was soon renamed &quot;De Lux Theater&quot; before closing in July 1916.
In 1921, a drive-in was opened by Claude V. Caver in Comanche, Texas. Caver obtained a permit from the city to project films downtown. With cars parked bumper-to-bumper, patrons witnessed the screening of silent films from their vehicles. In the 1920s &quot;outdoor movies&quot; became a popular summer entertainment, but relatively few &quot;drive-in&quot; experiments were made due to logistical difficulties.

The drive-in theater was patented in Camden, New Jersey, by chemical company magnate Richard M. Hollingshead, Jr., whose family owned and operated the R.M. Hollingshead Corporation chemical plant in Camden. In 1932, Hollingshead conducted outdoor theater tests in his driveway at 212 Thomas Avenue in Riverton. After nailing a screen to trees in his backyard, he set a 1928 Kodak projector on the hood of his car and put a radio behind the screen, testing different sound levels with his car windows down and up. Blocks under vehicles in the driveway enabled him to determine the size and spacing of ramps so all automobiles could view the screen. Hollingshead applied for a patent of his invention on August 6, 1932, and he was given on May 16, 1933.

Hollingshead&#x27;s drive-in opened in New Jersey on June 6, 1933, at 2901 Admiral Wilson Boulevard in Pennsauken Township, a short distance from Cooper River Park where the first commercial airport to serve Philadelphia was located – Central Airport. Rosemont Avenue now runs through where the theater was and is currently the site of Zinman Furs. It offered 400 slots and a screen. He advertised his drive-in theater with the slogan, &quot;The whole family is welcome, regardless of how noisy the children are.&quot; The first film shown was the Adolphe Menjou film &quot;Wives Beware&quot;. Failing to make a profit, Hollingshead sold the theater after three years to a Union, New Jersey, theater owner who moved the infrastructure to that city, but the concept caught on nationwide.

The April 15, 1934, opening of Shankweiler&#x27;s Auto Park in Orefield, Pennsylvania, was followed by Galveston&#x27;s Drive-In Short Reel Theater (July 5, 1934), the Pico Drive-In Theater at Pico and Westwood boulevards in Los Angeles (September 9, 1934) and the Weymouth Drive-In Theatre in Weymouth, Massachusetts (May 6, 1936). In 1937, three more opened in Ohio, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, with another 12 during 1938 and 1939 in California, Florida, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Texas and Virginia.

Early drive-in theaters had to deal with sound issues. The original Hollingshead drive-in had speakers installed on the tower itself, which caused a sound delay affecting patrons at the rear of the drive-in&#x27;s field. In 1935, the Pico Drive-in Theater attempted to solve this problem by having a row of speakers in front of the cars. In 1941, RCA introduced in-car speakers with individual volume controls which solved the noise pollution issue and provided satisfactory sound to drive-in patrons. Just before World War II, 9 of the 15 drive-in movie theaters open in the United States were operated by Philip Smith, who promoted a family-friendly environment by allowing children to enter free and built playgrounds.

=== Peak (late 1940s–1960s) ===

After 1945, rising car ownership and suburban and rural population led to a boom in drive-in theaters, with hundreds being opened each year. More couples were reunited and having children, resulting in the Baby Boom, and more cars were being purchased following the end of wartime fuel rationing. By 1951, the number of drive-in movie theaters in the United States had increased from its 1947 total of 155 to 4,151.

The drive-in&#x27;s peak popularity came in the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly in rural areas, with over 4,000 drive-ins spread across the United States in 1958. They were a cheaper alternative to in-door cinema theaters because not only did they save the gas of driving out to the city and then back home, but the cost of building and maintaining a drive-in theater was cheaper than that of an indoor theater, resulting in the lower overall cost of attendance. Among its advantages was the fact that older adults with children could take care of their infant while watching a movie. At the same time, youth found drive-ins ideal for a first date. Unlike indoor cinema theaters, there was an air of informality that was appealing to people of all ages, but specifically to families. The drive-in&#x27;s success was rooted in its reputation of being a family-friendly place. Parents were able to bring their children to the theater, often in pajamas, without worrying about bothering other movie-goers and were also able to spend time together without paying the expenses of babysitters. Drive-ins catered to their known audience, offering luxuries such as bottle warmers and diaper vending machines, and later miniature golf courses, swimming pools, and even motels on the land with windows facing the screens so that viewers could watch the films from their beds. During the 1950s, the greater privacy afforded to patrons gave drive-ins a reputation as immoral, and they were labeled &quot;passion pits&quot; in the media. The 1978 movie &quot;Grease&quot; portrays the local drive-in as a preferred spot for trysts. This indicates that the drive-in theater experience was a part of North American pop culture during this time, coupled with people&#x27;s love for cars and movies. It was also popular among young people to meet up and have sex, smoke marijuana and drink alcohol. It was appealing to young people as it allowed them to express freedom and liberty they would otherwise lack at home.

At their height, some drive-ins used attention-grabbing gimmicks to boost attendance. They ranged from drawings for prizes and free admission, small airplane runways, helicopter or hot air balloon rides, unusual attractions such as a small petting zoo or cage of monkeys, personal appearances by actors to open their movies, or musical groups to play before the show. Some drive-ins held Sunday religious services or charged a flat price per car on slow nights like Wednesdays or Sundays. On &quot;buck&quot; or &quot;bargain&quot; nights during the 1950s and 1960s, the admission price was one dollar per car; during the 1970s and &#x27;80s, bargain night admission was generally five dollars.

As revenue was more limited than regular theaters since showings could only begin at twilight, there were abortive attempts to create suitable conditions for daylight viewing, such as large tent structures, but nothing viable was developed.
One of the largest drive-in theaters was the Johnny All-Weather Drive-In in Copiague, New York. Covering over 29 acres, it could park 2,500 vehicles. It had a full-service restaurant with seating on the roof and a trolley system to take children and adults to a playground and a large indoor theater for bad weather or for those who wanted to watch in air-conditioned comfort. The largest in the world was Loew&#x27;s Open Air in Lynn, Massachusetts which could hold 5,000 cars.

=== Decline (1970s–1990s) ===
Several factors contributed to the decline of the drive-in movie industry. Beginning in the late 1960s, drive-in attendance began to decline as the result of improvements and changes to home entertainment, from color television and cable TV to VCRs and video rental in the early 1980s. Additionally, the 1970s energy crisis led to the widespread adoption of daylight saving time (which caused drive-in movies to start an hour later) and lower use of automobiles, making it increasingly difficult for drive-ins to remain profitable.

Mainly following the advent of cable television and video cassette recorder (VCR), then with the arrival of DVD and streaming systems, families were able to enjoy movies in the comfort of their homes. The new entertainment technology increased the options and the movie watching experience.

While exploitation films had been a drive-in staple since the 1950s, helped by relatively limited oversight compared to downtown theaters, by the 1970s, several venues switched from showing family-friendly fare to R-rated and X-rated films as a way to offset declining patronage and revenue, while other venues that still catered to families, began to show R-rated or pornographic movies in late-night time slots to bring in extra income. This allowed censored materials to be viewed by a wider audience, including those for whom viewing was still illegal in some states, and it was also reliant upon varying local ordinances controlling such material. It also required a relatively remote location away from the heavier populated areas of towns and cities.

By the late 1970s, many drive-in theaters were showing mainly B movies, older second-run films and low-rated films from the movie industry. While movie rental fees were increasing, the film industry was also expecting drive-in theaters to maintain prolonged time to run the shows. A combination of these factors was creating difficulties for the drive-ins to compete with the growing indoor cinemas.

The runaway inflation and real estate interest rate hikes in the late 1970s and early 1980s made the large tracts of land used by drive-ins increasingly expensive and thus far too valuable for continued use as drive-ins. Many drive-ins operated solely on weekends, while some were open only during the spring and summer months; drive-ins were also frequently subject to poor attendance or cancellations due to adverse weather. By the late 1980s, the total number of drive-ins still operating in the United States and Canada fell to less than two hundred.

In addition to the large amount of land drive-in theaters occupy, older drive-ins were now showing their age and many required improvements or replacement of their infrastructure; many owners were not willing to make further investment in repairs and improvements and growing land prices were also making it difficult to invest in and maintain the expense of operating a drive-in theater business. As many of the drive-in theaters were set up in the outskirts, the expansion of towns was making the maintenance of large property more difficult and costly.

Many former drive-in movie sites remain, with several re-purposed as storage or flea market sites, often after residential housing or other higher-value uses came to rural or sparsely populated areas where the drive-ins were located. In Michigan, former drive-in properties have become industrial parks, shopping centers, indoor theaters, and even churches (as with the Former Woodland Drive-In in Grand Rapids, MI). In Philadelphia, the South City Drive-In became the location of the original Spectrum in the late 1960s, with a small portion of its old property line extending into what would become the (now-demolished) Veterans Stadium complex. (Today, that small portion, combined with the original Spectrum location, is part of Xfinity Live! Philadelphia). Another example of a drive in-turned-flea market is Spotlight 88 in North Sewickley Township, Pennsylvania, which ended business as a drive-in after an F3 tornado destroyed much of the property on May 31, 1985. As a joke, after the tornado hit, the owners put up the &quot;now-showing&quot; sign &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. It was most likely copied from a Taylor, Michigan Drive in called Ecorse Drive-In. On July 16, 1980, a freak derecho storm with 150 mph straight-line winds swept the Drive-In away leaving only the &quot;now-showing&quot; sign with the letters &quot;Now Playing Gone with the Wind&quot;. The screen was rebuilt, but the business never recovered; by 1989, it was sold and now is the site of a Kroger grocery store.

=== Revival and new drive-in formats (late 1990s–2000s) ===
Beginning in the late 1970s and extending through the mid-1990s, those drive-ins still operating acquired a quasi-novelty status, catering to the wave of &quot;boomer nostalgia&quot; and loyal patrons. This &quot;retro&quot; appeal eventually led to a revival of sorts by the end of the 1990s.

This resurgence of the drive-in industry led to the inception of the &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; drive-in beginning in 2001, which used contemporary tools such as LCD projectors and micro radio transmitters. The first was the Liberation Drive-In in Oakland, California, which sought to reclaim under-used urban spaces such as vacant parking lots in the downtown area. The following years have had a rise of the &quot;guerrilla drive-in&quot; movement, in which groups of dedicated individuals orchestrate similar outdoor film and video screenings. Showings are often organized online, and participants meet at specified locations to watch films projected on bridge pillars or warehouses. The content featured at these screenings has frequently been independent or experimental films, cult movies, or otherwise alternative programming. Aside from Oakland&#x27;s Liberation, the best-known &quot;guerrilla&quot; drive-ins include the Santa Cruz Guerilla Drive-In in Santa Cruz, California, North Bay Mobile Drive-In in Novato, California, MobMov in San Francisco, California and Hollywood, and more recently the Guerilla Drive-In Victoria in Victoria, British Columbia.

A similar, more recent concept is the &quot;boutique&quot; drive-in, which caters to a smaller audience, generally 30 to 50 vehicles (with some also offering seats in front of the screen). At the same time, food trucks are often used as concession stands. However, unlike the &quot;guerrilla&quot; format, this type of drive-in also generally presents mainstream fare, current releases, and popular classics. A key feature of this format is the focus on the &quot;vintage&quot; aesthetics of the drive-in.

Faced with the closure of Hull&#x27;s Drive-In in Lexington, Virginia in 1999, the nonprofit group Hull&#x27;s Angels formed to raise funds, buy the property, and operate the theater as a nonprofit venture specializing in family-friendly films. Hull&#x27;s continues to be the nation&#x27;s only nonprofit drive-in.

By 2006, around 500 drive-in theaters were open in the United States, counting regularly operating venues (about 400) and those that held showings sporadically, usually during summertime, the highest number since the mid-1970s. The industry also rebounded in Canada and Australia during the early 2000s.

=== Present and digital conversion (late 2000s onwards) ===
In the second half of the 2000s, drive-ins had another decline because of the oil crisis and a worsening economy. Reduced use of automobiles and more people moving out of suburban and rural areas during the 2010s have also put the drive-in&#x27;s future at risk, with numbers again on the decline. By 2013, drive-ins comprised only 1.5% of total movie screens in the United States, with 389 theaters in operation nationwide, mostly located in the South and the West Coast (at the industry&#x27;s height, about 25% of the nation&#x27;s movie screens were at drive-ins). A figure of 348 operating drive-ins was published for the United States in March 2014.

In the fall of 2014, retro-themed burger chain Johnny Rockets announced that it would team up with USA Drive-Ins to open 200 drive-ins by 2018, serving Johnny Rocket&#x27;s food at the concession stands, but the plan never came to fruition, as did a proposed &quot;Project Drive-In&quot; scheme by Honda, which would have donated digital projectors. By 2018, less than 300 drive-in theaters were reported to operate worldwide, with only a handful outside North America.

The ongoing conversion of film distribution from celluloid to digital also puts additional pressure on drive-in theaters. Most small drive-ins lack the finances (beginning at $70,000 per screen) needed to convert to digital projection. The low volume of ticket sales from the lack of multiple showings also makes justifying the cost of installing digital projection hard for many drive-ins. Conversion of the projection booth to digital is more complex for drive-in theaters. The projector needs a more powerful bulb due to increased screen size and light pollution. In addition, digital projection equipment may require an Internet connection, and the booth must be retrofitted with special glass, more vents, and stronger air conditioning, as well as heat in northern climates.

With installation of Jumbotrons or similar digital display equipment in drive-in theatres, restrictions of the projector booth can be avoided; that is, no projector is needed.

The move to digital conversion took its toll on the industry; by October 2019, figures for operating drive-in theaters rose to 305 because of increased numbers of smaller &#x27;boutique&#x27; operations that had never used traditional projectors, while several older drive-ins have closed.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, drive-in theaters reported an unexpected surge in attendance in several U.S. states, as unlike with indoor theaters unable to operate because of bans on mass gatherings, these were allowed to operate, with such events as graduations, because people are automatically separated from each other by their cars, and usually enough space remains to walk around and still practice proper physical distancing.

The largest drive-in theater in the world, the Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop (opened 1963), doubles as the world&#x27;s largest daily flea market.

=== Current drive-in theater experience (since 2020) ===
There is a renewed interest in drive-in theaters among North American moviegoers. This trend was more apparent in 2020 through 2022. In 2020 Drive-in theaters in North America accounted for 85 to 95 percent of the box office revenue according to a 2021 article from CNN. The article also claims that the new experience in drive-in cinemas is gaining popularity not just in North America but in other countries as well. After decades of inactivity drive-in theaters are slowly becoming part of the outdoor movie experience. One of the countries where drive-in theaters is returning is the United Kingdom. There are also new drive-in theaters that have opened recently in North America that intend on staying in business and expanding. Some of the owners believe that the drive-in theatre will renew the outdoor experience in the long run. Some are also projected to open in the coming years with newer designs using electronic screen system to stream the film, improving the set up, as well as concession and public facilities. In the past drive-in theaters were operating in the evening to provide clear picture. But with the new design, moviegoers can go to drive-in theaters at anytime. Just like the TV at home, the new drive-in theater does not have to depend on darkness. One of such newly designed drive-in theaters is LoCo Drive-In by Whitener Company and London Entertainment LLC. The drive-in will also be used for other social activities including car shows and other events. Another example of modern-day drive-in theater is the Drive-In Experience Ottawa that opened in 2020. Currently, the company has two locations in the Ottawa area. Apart from movie-nights, the drive-in also hosts live entertainment such as “comedy nights” and concerts as well events including graduations and weddings through site rental. It provides screen, wireless in-car FM transmission and stage facilities for the events. According to the company, such a community approach will keep the drive-in experience into the future. Ottawa Business Journal also wrote that local business communities and organizations can host their own private movie nights or shows. The drive-in can also be utilized for yoga activities and fitness training. The director of the company claims that the Drive-In Experience Ottawa’s goal is to provide opportunities for communities to reconnect while striving to host large weekly events and entertainment programs for the Ottawa residents. This new drive-in image is not just in Ottawa. According to CTV, there are also drive-ins in Ontario and other provinces that are expanding their entertainment hosting activities including live concerts while keeping the main core, i.e., to keep family movie experience. In Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, some of the drive-ins host community activities that also include religious events.

== Drive-in theaters around the world ==

=== Australia ===
The drive-in theater also became popular in Australia during the 1950s and 1960s. The Hoyts Skyline in Melbourne was the country&#x27;s first drive-in cinema, opening in 1954 with the film &quot;On the Riviera&quot;. The drive-in was successful, and four more opened within the year, including Mainline Drive-In in Gepps Cross, South Australia. The number of drive-ins increased across the country in the ensuing years. As these drive-ins were based on the American trend, many served American-style food at snack bars. At the height of their popularity in the mid-1960s, around 330 drive-in theaters were operating in Australia before quickly dropping off. , there were only 12 drive-ins in regular operation, with three more which sometimes opened for film screenings. Gepps Cross Drive-In closed at the end of February 2022, with the lengthy COVID-19 pandemic finally putting an end to its viability. , only 12 drive-in cinemas operate regularly, while an additional three sometimes open to screen films. Melbourne&#x27;s largest drive-in, the Lunar in Dandenong South, is set to close in the second half of 2023.

The world&#x27;s most remote drive-in may be at Coober Pedy, South Australia. It opened in 1965, but became less popular after 1980 with the arrival of television in the town, and ceased regular operation in 1984. It was reopened in 1996, and has been operated by volunteers since 2000. It is still in operation , and is the last drive-in theater in the state of South Australia (since February 2022). Due to the opal miners often carrying explosives in their vehicles, the drive-in has a ban on bringing explosives onto the site. On 15 November 2023, winds reaching almost destroyed the screen, resulting in the drive-in&#x27;s closure, but local volunteers hope they will be able to rebuild the screen and re-open the drive-in.

===Greece===
In 1919, Athens, Greece opened their first outdoor theater that eventually led to the popularity of drive-in theaters in the 1970s. Three years before then, two men displayed a short silent film on a wall of the city. Greece&#x27;s first drive-in theater began construction in 1960 near Varibobi, a suburb of Athens, and was planned to open in August 1961. Viewers today have the option to eat classic movie refreshments such as popcorn, or even native Greek snacks such as grilled calamari and souvlaki. 

=== Iran ===

<text>Thermoelectric cooling uses the Peltier effect to create a heat flux at the junction of two different types of materials. A Peltier cooler, heater, or thermoelectric heat pump is a solid-state active heat pump which transfers heat from one side of the device to the other, with consumption of electrical energy, depending on the direction of the current. Such an instrument is also called a Peltier device, Peltier heat pump, solid state refrigerator, or thermoelectric cooler (TEC) and occasionally a thermoelectric battery. It can be used either for heating or for cooling, although in practice the main application is cooling since heating can be achieved with simpler devices (with Joule heating). It can also be used as a temperature controller that either heats or cools.

This technology is far less commonly applied to refrigeration than vapor-compression refrigeration is. The primary advantages of a Peltier cooler compared to a vapor-compression refrigerator are its lack of moving parts or circulating liquid, very long life, invulnerability to leaks, small size, and flexible shape. Its main disadvantages are high cost for a given cooling capacity and poor power efficiency (a low coefficient of performance or COP). Many researchers and companies are trying to develop Peltier coolers that are cheap and efficient. (See Thermoelectric materials.)

A Peltier cooler can also be used as a thermoelectric generator. When operated as a cooler, a voltage applied across the device results in a temperature difference between the two sides. When operated as a generator, heating one side to a higher temperature than the other results in a voltage across the device (the Seebeck effect). However, a well-designed Peltier cooler will be a mediocre thermoelectric generator and vice versa, because of different design and packaging requirements.

== Operating principle ==


Thermoelectric coolers operate by the Peltier effect (one of three phenomena that make up the thermoelectric effect). A thermoelectric module is made from three components: the conductors, the legs, and the substrate. Many of these modules are connected electrically in series, but thermally in parallel. When a DC electric current flows through the device, it brings heat from one side to the other, so that one side gets colder while the other gets hotter.

The hot side is attached to a heat sink to limit its temperature increase, while the cold side goes below the ambient temperature. In special applications, multiple coolers can be cascaded or staged together for lower temperature, but overall efficiency (COP) drops significantly. The maximum COP of any refrigeration cycle is ultimately limited by the different in temperature between the hot and cold side. The higher the temperature difference, the lower the maximum theoretical COP. Both temperatures depend on the rate of heat transfer to or away from the device as well as heat movement driven within.

== Construction ==

=== Design ===
Two unique semiconductors, one n-type and one p-type, are used because they need to have different electron densities. The alternating p &amp; n-type semiconductor pillars are placed thermally in parallel to each other and electrically in series and then joined with a thermally conducting plate on each side, usually ceramic, removing the need for a separate insulator. When a voltage is applied to the free ends of the two semiconductors there is a flow of DC current across the junction of the semiconductors, causing a temperature difference. The side with the cooling plate absorbs heat which is then transported by the semiconductor to the other side of the device.

The cooling ability of the total unit is then proportional to the total cross section of all the pillars, which are often connected in series electrically to reduce the current needed to practical levels. The length of the pillars is a balance between longer pillars, which will have a greater thermal resistance between the sides and allow a lower temperature to be reached but produce more resistive heating, and shorter pillars, which will have a greater electrical efficiency but let more heat leak from the hot to cold side by thermal conduction. For large temperature differences, longer pillars are far less efficient than stacking separate, progressively larger modules; the modules get larger as each layer must remove both the heat moved by the above layer and the waste heat of the layer.

=== Materials ===
Requirements for thermoelectric materials:
* Narrow band-gap semiconductors because of room-temperature operation;
* High electrical conductivity (to reduce electrical resistance, a source of waste heat);
* Low thermal conductivity (so that heat doesn&#x27;t come back from the hot side to the cool side); this usually translates to heavy elements
* Large unit cell, complex structure;
* Highly anisotropic or highly symmetric;
* Complex compositions.

Materials suitable for high efficiency TEC systems must have a combination of low thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity. The combined effect of different material combinations is commonly compared using a figure of merit known as ZT, a measure of the system&#x27;s efficiency. The equation for ZT is given below, where formula_1 is the Seebeck coefficient, formula_2 is the electrical conductivity and formula_3 is the thermal conductivity.

formula_4

There are few materials that are suitable for TEC applications since the relationship between thermal and electrical conductivity is usually a positive correlation. Improvements in reduced thermal transport with increased electrical conductivity are an active area of material science research. Common thermoelectric materials used as semiconductors include bismuth telluride, lead telluride, silicon–germanium, and bismuth antimonide alloys. Of these, bismuth telluride is the most commonly used. New high-performance materials for thermoelectric cooling are being actively researched.

For decades, narrow bandgap semiconductors, such as bismuth, tellurium and their compounds, have been used as materials of thermocouples.

=== Identification and characteristics ===
The vast majority of thermoelectric coolers have an ID printed on the cooled side. These universal IDs indicate the size, number of stages, number of couples, and current rating in amps, as seen in the adjacent diagram.

For example, the common thermoelectric element TEC1-12706 has a square shape of 40 mm size and 3–4 mm high, and are found for a few dollars. It is able to move around 60 W or generate a 60 °C temperature difference with a 6 A current. Their electrical resistance is about 1–2 ohm.

== Strengths and weaknesses ==

There are many factors motivating further research on TEC including lower carbon emissions and ease of manufacturing. However, several challenges have arisen.

=== Benefits ===
A significant benefit of TEC systems is that they have no moving parts. This lack of mechanical wear and reduced instances of failure due to fatigue and fracture from mechanical vibration and stress increases the lifespan of the system and lowers the maintenance requirements. Current technologies show the mean time between failures (MTBF) to exceed 100,000 hours at ambient temperatures. The condition of a thermoelectric electric can be measured by the change of their AC resistance (ACR); as it wears out, the ACR will increase.

The fact that TEC systems are current-controlled leads to another series of benefits. Because the flow of heat is directly proportional to the applied DC current, heat may be added or removed with accurate control of the direction and amount of electric current. In contrast to methods that use resistive heating or cooling methods that involve gases, TEC allows for an equal degree of control over the flow of heat (both in and out of a system under control). Because of this precise bidirectional heat flow control, temperatures of controlled systems can be precise to fractions of a degree, often reaching precision of milli Kelvin (mK) in laboratory settings.

TEC devices are also more flexible in shape than their more traditional counterparts. They can be used in environments with less space or more severe conditions than a conventional refrigerator. The ability to tailor their geometry allows for the delivery of precise cooling to very small areas. These factors make them a common choice in scientific and engineering applications with demanding requirements where cost and absolute energy efficiency are not primary concerns.

Another benefit of TEC is that it does not use refrigerants in its operation. Prior to their phaseout some early refrigerants, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), contributed significantly to ozone depletion. Many refrigerants used today also have significant environmental impact with global warming potential or carry other safety risks with them.

=== Disadvantages ===
TEC systems have a number of notable disadvantages. Foremost is their limited energy efficiency compared to conventional vapor-compression systems and the constraints on both the temperature difference and the total heat flux (heat flow) that they are able to generate per unit area. This topic is further discussed in the performance section below. In practice, the mean working life of a low cost thermoelectric module is less than 10 years typically because gasses diffuse through the elastomeric perimeter seal of the module, or the seal bond line fails at the plate.

== Performance ==
Peltier (thermoelectric) performance is a function of ambient temperature, hot and cold side heat exchanger (heat sink) performance, thermal load, Peltier module (thermopile) geometry, and Peltier electrical parameters.

The amount of heat that can be moved is proportional to the current and time.
:formula_5, where &quot;P&quot; is the Peltier coefficient, &quot;I&quot; is the current, and &quot;t&quot; is the time. The Peltier coefficient depends on temperature and the materials the cooler is made of. Magnitude of 10 watt per ampere are common, but this is offset by two phenomena: 
* According to Ohm&#x27;s law, a Peltier module will produce waste heat itself,
:formula_6, where R is the resistance. 
* Heat will also move from the hot side to the cool side by thermal conduction inside the module itself, an effect which grows stronger as the temperature difference grows.

The result is that the heat effectively moved drops as the temperature difference grows, and the module becomes less efficient. There comes a temperature difference when the waste heat and heat moving back overcomes the moved heat, and the module starts to &quot;heat&quot; the cool side instead of cooling it further. A single-stage thermoelectric cooler will typically produce a maximal temperature difference of 70 °C between its hot and cold sides.

Another issue with performance is a direct consequence of one of their advantages: being small. This means that:

* the hot side and the cool side will be very close to each other (a few millimeters away), making it easier for the heat to go back to the cool side, and harder to insulate the hot and cool side from each other
* a common 40 mm × 40 mm can generate 60 W or more—that is, 4 W/cm2 or more—requiring a powerful radiator to move the heat away

In refrigeration applications, thermoelectric junctions have about 1/4 the efficiency compared to conventional means (vapor compression refrigeration): they offer around 10–15% efficiency (COP of 1.0–1.5) of the ideal Carnot cycle refrigerator, compared with 40–60% achieved by conventional compression-cycle systems (reverse Rankine systems using compression/expansion). Due to this lower efficiency, thermoelectric cooling is generally only used in environments where the solid-state nature (no moving parts), low maintenance, compact size, and orientation insensitivity outweighs pure efficiency.

While lower than conventional means, efficiency can be good enough, provided:

* temperature difference is kept as small as possible, and, 
* the current is kept low, because the ratio of moved heat over waste heat (for same temperature on the hot and cool side) will be formula_7. 
However, since low current also means a low amount of moved heat, for all practical purposes the coefficient of performance will be low.

== Uses ==

Thermoelectric coolers are used for applications that require heat removal ranging from milliwatts to several thousand watts. They can be made for applications as small as a beverage cooler or as large as a submarine or railroad car.

=== Consumer products ===
Peltier elements are commonly used in consumer products. For example, they are used in camping, portable coolers, cooling electronic components, mattress pad sleeping systems and small instruments. They can also be used to extract water from the air in dehumidifiers. A camping/car type (12 V) electric cooler can typically reduce the temperature by up to 20 °C (36 °F) below the ambient temperature, which is 25 °C if the car reaches 45 °C under the sun. Climate-controlled jackets are beginning to use Peltier elements.

Thermoelectric coolers can be used to cool computer components to keep temperatures within design limits or to maintain stable functioning when overclocking. A Peltier cooler with a heat sink or waterblock can cool a chip to well below ambient temperature. Some Intel Core CPUs from the 10th generation and onwards are capable of using the Intel Cryo technology, which uses a combination of thermoelectric cooling and a liquid heat exchanger to deliver a much greater cooling performance than normally possible with standard liquid cooling. Local environment conditions are electronically monitored to prevent shorting from condensation.

=== Industrial ===
Thermoelectric coolers are used in many fields of industrial manufacturing and require a thorough performance analysis as they face the test of running thousands of cycles before these industrial products are launched to the market. Some of the applications include laser equipment, thermoelectric air conditioners or coolers, industrial electronics and telecommunications, automotive, mini refrigerators or incubators, military cabinets, IT enclosures, and more.

In fiber-optic applications, where the wavelength of a laser or a component is highly dependent on temperature, Peltier coolers are used along with a thermistor in a feedback loop to maintain a constant temperature and thereby stabilize the wavelength of the device.

Some electronic equipment intended for military use in the field is thermoelectrically cooled.

=== Science and imaging ===
Peltier elements are used in scientific devices. They are a common component in thermal cyclers, used for the synthesis of DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a common molecular biological technique, which requires the rapid heating and cooling of the reaction mixture for denaturation, primer annealing, and enzymatic synthesis cycles.

With feedback circuitry, Peltier elements can be used to implement highly stable temperature controllers that keep desired temperature within ±0.01 °C. Such stability may be used in precise laser applications to avoid laser wavelength drifting as environment temperature changes.

The effect is used in satellites and spacecraft to reduce temperature differences caused by direct sunlight on one side of a craft by dissipating the heat over the cold shaded side, where it is dissipated as thermal radiation to space. Since 1961, some uncrewed spacecraft (including the &quot;Curiosity&quot; Mars rover) utilize radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) that convert thermal energy into electrical energy using the Seebeck effect. The devices can last several decades, as they are fueled by the decay of high-energy radioactive materials.

Peltier elements are also used to make cloud chambers to visualize ionizing radiation. Just by passing an electric current, they can cool vapors below −26 °C without dry ice or moving parts, making cloud chambers easy to make and use.

Photon detectors such as CCDs in astronomical telescopes, spectrometers, or very high-end digital cameras are often cooled by Peltier elements that may be arranged in a multi-stage, cascade refrigeration configuration.This reduces dark counts due to thermal noise. A dark count occurs when a pixel registers an electron caused by thermal fluctuation rather than a photon. On digital photos taken at low light these occur as speckles (or &quot;pixel noise&quot;).

They are also used in energy-dispersive spectrometers to cool the sensor crystals, eliminating the necessity of large liquid nitrogen dewars.

=== Experimental ===

Around 1955, RCA Laboratories built a refrigerator and a small room that was air conditioned using the Peltier effect. These were research demonstrations and did not result in products. The air conditioner was one of the &quot;birthday presents&quot; asked for by CEO David Sarnoff to challenge the researchers. One of the lead researchers was Nils E. Lindenblad.

<doc id="310599" wikidata="Q3307742" url="?curid=310599" title="Fitness landscape">
<text>In evolutionary biology, fitness landscapes or adaptive landscapes (types of evolutionary landscapes) are used to visualize the relationship between genotypes and reproductive success. It is assumed that every genotype has a well-defined replication rate (often referred to as fitness). This fitness is the &quot;height&quot; of the landscape. Genotypes which are similar are said to be &quot;close&quot; to each other, while those that are very different are &quot;far&quot; from each other. The set of all possible genotypes, their degree of similarity, and their related fitness values is then called a fitness landscape. The idea of a fitness landscape is a metaphor to help explain flawed forms in evolution by natural selection, including exploits and glitches in animals like their reactions to supernormal stimuli.

The idea of studying evolution by visualizing the distribution of fitness values as a kind of landscape was first introduced by Sewall Wright in 1932.

In evolutionary optimization problems, fitness landscapes are evaluations of a fitness function for all candidate solutions (see below).

==In biology==
In all fitness landscapes, height represents and is a visual metaphor for fitness. There are three distinct ways of characterizing the other dimensions, though in each case distance represents and is a metaphor for degree of dissimilarity.

Fitness landscapes are often conceived of as ranges of mountains. There exist local peaks (points from which all paths are downhill, i.e. to lower fitness) and valleys (regions from which many paths lead uphill). A fitness landscape with many local peaks surrounded by deep valleys is called rugged. If all genotypes have the same replication rate, on the other hand, a fitness landscape is said to be flat. An evolving population typically climbs uphill in the fitness landscape, by a series of small genetic changes, until – in the infinite time limit – a local optimum is reached.

Note that a local optimum cannot always be found even in evolutionary time: if the local optimum can be found in a reasonable amount of time then the fitness landscape is called &quot;easy&quot; and if the time required is exponential then the fitness landscape is called &quot;hard&quot;. Hard landscapes are characterized by the maze-like property by which an allele that was once beneficial becomes deleterious, forcing evolution to backtrack. However, the presence of the maze-like property in biophysically inspired fitness landscapes may not be sufficient to generate a hard landscape.

===Genotype to fitness landscapes===
Wright visualized a genotype space as a hypercube. No continuous genotype &quot;dimension&quot; is defined. Instead, a network of genotypes are connected via mutational paths.

Stuart Kauffman&#x27;s NK model falls into this category of fitness landscape. Newer network analysis techniques such as selection-weighted attraction graphing (SWAG) also use a dimensionless genotype space.

===Allele frequency to fitness landscapes===
Wright&#x27;s mathematical work described fitness as a function of allele frequencies. Here, each dimension describes an allele frequency at a different gene, and goes between 0 and 1.

===Phenotype to fitness landscapes===
In the third kind of fitness landscape, each dimension represents a different phenotypic trait. Under the assumptions of quantitative genetics, these phenotypic dimensions can be mapped onto genotypes. See the visualizations below for examples of phenotype to fitness landscapes.

==In evolutionary optimization==
Apart from the field of evolutionary biology, the concept of a fitness landscape has also gained importance in evolutionary optimization methods such as genetic algorithms or evolution strategies. In evolutionary optimization, one tries to solve real-world problems (e.g., engineering or logistics problems) by imitating the dynamics of biological evolution. For example, a delivery truck with a number of destination addresses can take a large variety of different routes, but only very few will result in a short driving time.

In order to use many common forms of evolutionary optimization, one has to define for every possible solution &quot;s&quot; to the problem of interest (i.e., every possible route in the case of the delivery truck) how &#x27;good&#x27; it is. This is done by introducing a scalar-valued function &quot;f(s)&quot; (scalar valued means that &quot;f(s)&quot; is a simple number, such as 0.3, while &quot;s&quot; can be a more complicated object, for example a list of destination addresses in the case of the delivery truck), which is called the fitness function.

A high &quot;f(s)&quot; implies that &quot;s&quot; is a good solution. In the case of the delivery truck, &quot;f(s)&quot; could be the number of deliveries per hour on route &quot;s&quot;. The best, or at least a very good, solution is then found in the following way: initially, a population of random solutions is created. Then, the solutions are mutated and selected for those with higher fitness, until a satisfying solution has been found.

Evolutionary optimization techniques are particularly useful in situations in which it is easy to determine the quality of a single solution, but hard to go through all possible solutions one by one (it is easy to determine the driving time for a particular route of the delivery truck, but it is almost impossible to check all possible routes once the number of destinations grows to more than a handful).

Even in cases where a fitness function is hard to define, the concept of a fitness landscape can be useful. For example, if fitness evaluation is by stochastic sampling, then sampling is from a (usually unknown) distribution at each point; nevertheless is can be useful to reason about the landscape formed by the expected fitness at each point. If fitness changes with time (dynamic optimisation) or with other species in the environment (co-evolution), it can still be useful to reason about the trajectories of the instantaneous fitness landscape. However, in some cases (for example, preference-based interactive evolutionary computation) the relevance is more limited, because there is no guarantee that human preferences are consistent with a single fitness assignment.

The concept of a scalar valued fitness function &quot;f(s)&quot; also corresponds to the concept of a potential or energy function in physics. The two concepts only differ in that physicists traditionally think in terms of minimizing the potential function, while biologists prefer the notion that fitness is being maximized. Therefore, taking the inverse of a potential function turns it into a fitness function, and vice versa.

==Caveats and limitations==
Several important caveats exist. Since the human mind struggles to think in greater than three dimensions, 3D topologies can mislead when discussing highly multi-dimensional fitness landscapes. In particular it is not clear whether peaks in natural biological fitness landscapes are ever truly separated by fitness valleys in such multidimensional landscapes, or whether they are connected by vastly long neutral ridges. Additionally, the fitness landscape is not static in time but dependent on the changing environment and evolution of other genes. It is hence more of a seascape, further affecting how separated adaptive peaks can actually be. Additionally, it is relevant to take into account that a landscape is in general not an absolute but a relative function. Finally, since it is common to use function as a proxy for fitness when discussing enzymes, any promiscuous activities exist as overlapping landscapes that together will determine the ultimate fitness of the organism, implying a gap between different coexisting relative landscapes.

With these limitations in mind, fitness landscapes can still be an instructive way of thinking about evolution. It is fundamentally possible to measure (even if not to visualise) some of the parameters of landscape ruggedness and of peak number, height, separation, and clustering. Simplified 3D landscapes can then be used relative to each other to visually represent the relevant features. Additionally, fitness landscapes of small subsets of evolutionary pathways may be experimentally constructed and visualized, potentially revealing features such as fitness peaks and valleys. Fitness landscapes of evolutionary pathways indicate the probable evolutionary steps and endpoints among sets of individual mutations.

<text>Parliamentary opposition is a form of political opposition to a designated government, particularly in a Westminster-based parliamentary system. This article uses the term &quot;government&quot; as it is used in Parliamentary systems, i.e. meaning &quot;the administration&quot; or &quot;the cabinet&quot; rather than &quot;the state&quot;. In some countries, the title of &quot;Official Opposition&quot; is conferred upon the largest political party sitting in opposition in the legislature, with said party&#x27;s leader being accorded the title &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot;.

In first-past-the-post assemblies, where the tendency to gravitate into two major parties or party groupings operates strongly, &quot;government&quot; and &quot;opposition&quot; roles can go to the two main groupings serially in alternation.

The more proportionally representative a system, the greater the likelihood of multiple political parties appearing in the parliamentary debating chamber. Such systems can foster multiple &quot;opposition&quot; parties which may have little in common and minimal desire to form a united bloc opposed to the government of the day.

Some well-organised democracies, dominated long-term by a single faction, reduce their parliamentary opposition to tokenism. In some cases, in more authoritarian countries, tame &quot;opposition&quot; parties are created by the governing groups in order to create an impression of democratic debate.

Some legislatures offer opposition parties particular powers. In Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand, 20 days each year are set aside as &quot;Opposition Days&quot; or &quot;Supply Days&quot;, during which the opposition gets to set the agenda. Canada also has a Question Period, during which the opposition (and the Parliament generally) can ask questions of government ministers.

<text>The Round Island day gecko (&quot;Phelsuma guentheri)&quot;, also known commonly as Günther&#x27;s gecko, is an endangered species of lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The species is endemic to the islet Round Island, Mauritius, and typically dwells on palm trees. The Round Island day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;guentheri&quot;, is in honor of German-born British herpetologist Albert Günther.

==Description==
&quot;P. guentheri&quot; is one of the largest living day geckos. Males can reach a total length (including tail) of about , but often are much smaller. Females of this species are generally very much smaller than males. The body color is grayish or grayish brown. A dark-brown stripe extends from the nostril to above the ear opening. On the back, dark spots may be present. In some individuals, the legs and toes have light-yellow bars. The ventral side is white or yellowish.

==Geographic range==
&quot;P. guentheri&quot; originally occurred on Mauritius before rats and cats were introduced. Now, it inhabits only Round Island, north-northeast of Mauritius.

==Habitat==
&quot;P. guentheri&quot; is often found on bottle palms, fan palms (&quot;Latania loddigesii)&quot;, and Pandanus. Since much of the original vegetation is destroyed, by tropical cyclones, &quot;P. guentheri&quot; is forced to live in rocky crevices.

==Diet==
The Round Island day gecko feeds on various insects and other invertebrates. It also licks soft, sweet fruit, pollen, and nectar.

==Reproduction==
Adult females of &quot;P. guentheri&quot; lay up to four pairs of eggs. The young will hatch after about 58–104 days. The juveniles measure . The eggs are laid normally in June, but can be laid from February to September.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
&quot;P. guentheri&quot; is endangered and was bred and kept by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust at Durrell Wildlife Park until 1999.

<doc id="310612" wikidata="Q1195412" url="?curid=310612" title="Drive-in">
<text>A drive-in is a facility (such as a restaurant or movie theater) where one can drive in with an automobile for service. At a drive-in restaurant, for example, customers park their vehicles and are usually served by staff who walk or rollerskate out to take orders and return with food, encouraging diners to remain parked while they eat. Drive-in theaters have a large screen and a car parking area for film-goers.

It is usually distinguished from a drive-through, in which drivers line up to make an order at a microphone set up at window height, and then drive to a window where they pay and receive their food. The drivers then take their meals elsewhere to eat. Notably however, during peak periods, patrons may be required to park in a designated parking spot and wait for their food to be directly served to them by an attendant walking to their car, resulting in the perceived relationship between the two service-types. In the German-speaking world, the term is now often used instead of &quot;drive-through&quot; for that kind of service. In Japan, the term refers to a rest area. In France, this term has become popular because of American movies showing that kind of service, and more recently due to the expansion of fast-food restaurants.

The first drive-in restaurant was Kirby&#x27;s Pig Stand, which opened in Dallas, Texas, in 1921. In North America, drive-in facilities of all types have become less popular since their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, with drive-throughs rising to prominence since the 1970s and 1980s.

The largest drive-in still in operation is The Varsity of Atlanta, Georgia.
== In popular culture ==
As a symbol of the 1950s, a drive-in is featured in many films and TV series about this period. The film &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973) has several scenes in or around Mels Drive-In, while in &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Arnold&#x27;s Drive-In&quot; is one of the main settings for much of the series.

<text>A V20 engine is a twenty-cylinder piston engine where two banks of ten cylinders are arranged in a V configuration around a common crankshaft. Large diesel V20 engines have been used in diesel locomotives, haul trucks, electric generators and marine applications.

== History ==
Beginning in the late-1930s, Mercedes-Benz produced several large V20 diesel engines for use in marine applications. The first engine was the &quot;MB 501&quot; which was based on the &quot;MB 500&quot; V12 engine and was installed in the 1937 class Schnellboot (fast attack boat) and several submarines. Later versions included the supercharged &quot;MB 511&quot; engine and the &quot;MB 518&quot;, which also added an intercooler. A copy of the MB 511 was produced by VEB Motorenwerk in Ludwigsfelde and called the &quot;VEB 20 KVD 25&quot;. Production of the MB 518 resumed in 1951, and a version of the engine was also manufactured by MTU, called the &quot;MB 20 V 672&quot;. 

The Electro-Motive Diesel EMD 645E3 two-stroke V20 turbo-diesel engine was used in 1960s diesel-electric locomotives such as the EMD SD45. The engine has a displacement of and produces a net traction of . The maximum gross power output is closer to 5,000 hp when operated in self-test mode (with the generated output being dissipated by resistors). Later versions of the EMD 645 engine were used in the EMD SD45-2 and EMD SD45T-2 locomotives. EMD also produces a V20 version of the EMD 710 diesel engine, which was used in the 1995 EMD SD80MAC locomotive. The EMD 710 remains in production to this day, and is mostly used in power generation and marine propulsion.

The Detroit Diesel Series 149 20V149 has an output of 2,936 hp (2,189 kW) from a capacity of 2,980 cu in (48.8 L). It was discontinued in 2000. 

Current production V20 diesel engines include the Fairbanks Morse FM | MAN 28/33D STC, FM | MAN 32/44CR, FM | MAN 175D, FM | COLT-PIELSTICK PA6B STC. Others are the &quot;Wärtsilä 20V32&quot; which produces up to , the &quot;MTU 20V1163&quot; 6 MW (8,045 hp)&quot;MTU 20V4000&quot; 2.8 MW (3,755 hp), &quot;MTU 20V8000&quot; 10 MW (13,410 hp), Cummins 120.0L QSK120 (5,000 hp). Caterpillar C175-20 4 MW (5,364 hp) and the G3520 series.

<doc id="310619" wikidata="Q4673641" url="?curid=310619" title="Achewood">
<text>Achewood is a webcomic created by Chris Onstad in 2001. It portrays the lives of a group of anthropomorphic stuffed toys, robots, and pets. Many of the characters live together in the home of their owner, Chris, at the fictional address of 62 Achewood Court. The events of the strip mostly take place in and around the house, as well as around the town of Achewood, a fictional suburb.

The comic&#x27;s humor is usually absurdist, typically lacking a traditional punchline, and sometimes surreal. The strip features many characters with detailed backstories. Many &quot;Achewood&quot; strips contain some reference to food or drink because the author is a food and cooking enthusiast.

Originally published regularly, the comic began to miss release dates in late 2010. In March 2011, Onstad announced that &quot;Achewood&quot; would be going on an indefinite hiatus. In November 2011, the comic returned, followed by an announcement in December that the hiatus was over. However, Onstad stated that no regular schedule will be in effect, and new strips have been released sporadically. Onstad indicated in 2013 that he had plans for pitching &quot;Achewood&quot; as an animated series. No further news came from this, and the comic itself was not updated between April 7, 2014, and December 24, 2015. When the strip returned, it was updated most subsequent Fridays. On December 25, 2016, Onstad announced that the strip would go on another hiatus. In 2023, Onstad resumed producing &quot;Achewood&quot;, making it available via Patreon.

==History==
The first &quot;Achewood&quot; strip was released on October 1, 2001. The location and the comic were named after an ingredient supposedly used by slaves during the United States&#x27;s antebellum era that would induce melancholia in the drinker, according to the comic&#x27;s website. 

Throughout &quot;Achewood&quot;, there is no distinguishable underlying storyline, only the general passing of time and development of the comic&#x27;s characters and their interrelationships. The characters are mainly developed through one-off strips and short story arcs. There were 46 story arcs from 2002 to 2010. These story arcs are often interrupted with cutaways to the activity of other &quot;Achewood&quot; characters, which may or may not tie in with the main storyline of the arc. The pages often rely upon strange humor as well as stereotypes, literary and historical references, and an in-depth knowledge of the characters and their interactions.

Most strips include an alt text, a one-sentence aside written in Onstad&#x27;s voice that appears when the reader hovers the cursor over the strip. The first alt-text was the word &quot;snif&quot; on Christmas, 2001. The first of the regular full-sentence alt-text appeared on January 2, 2002, apparently excusing a weak strip: &quot;whatever. it was late and a friend was over.&quot;

In October 2002, &quot;Achewood&quot; &quot;Sunday Edition&quot; became part of the online alternative comics anthology Serializer. In their review of serializer.net, &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a pleasure to see strips like Achewood&#x27;s &#x27;Sunday&#x27; strip ... use the newspaper format for far more daring, entertainingly perverse work ... would be perfectly at home at a good alternative weekly or a great college paper.&quot; &quot;Achewood&quot; is sometimes featured in the &quot;Chaparral&quot;, Stanford University&#x27;s humor publication, of which Onstad is a retired editor.

On April 30, 2003, Onstad introduced an advice column written by the character Ray called &quot;Ray&#x27;s Place&quot;. The column has developed characters, mainly as perceived by Ray, and allows for readers to interact with the character.

July 2004 saw the introduction of several in-character blogs hosted on Blogger. Onstad stated in an interview that he found the blogs easier to maintain than the strip, as they do not require as much refining.

In late 2004, it was announced that Checker Book Publishing Group was to release a collection of &quot;Achewood&quot; comics later that year. Checker had signed Chris Onstad to a three-book deal that was to begin in November 2004. However, the deal was cancelled soon after due to creative differences.

On September 10, 2008, Dark Horse Comics published a 104-page extended version of &quot;The Great Outdoor Fight&quot; story arc, with a deleted scene, background material on the fight, and other original content.

Dark Horse subsequently published in October 2009 the first several years of &quot;Achewood&quot; comics under the title of &quot;Achewood Volume Two: Worst Song, Played On Ugliest Guitar&quot;, including notes on each strip by Onstad. A third volume, &quot;Achewood Volume Three: A Home For Scared People&quot;, was published in December 2010 and contains strips up to the end of October 2002.

The arrival of new comics slowed down in late 2010. On March 20, 2011, Onstad posted on his blog that &quot;Achewood&quot; would be on an indefinite hiatus. Between November 2011, and June 2012, Onstad posted comics on an erratic basis, with up to four comics per month, then resumed regular, weekly new comics from August 2013 to April 7, 2014.

Onstad resumed posting comics on December 24, 2015, with the first new strip in 20 months, and continued to update the site on most subsequent Fridays throughout 2016. On December 25, 2016, Onstad announced that he was &quot;walking away&quot; from the strip and that it would be entering another extended hiatus period.

The webcomic was resumed in 2023, being made available over Patreon.

==Major characters==
=== Raymond Quentin Smuckles ===
Raymond Quentin &quot;Ray&quot; Smuckles is a somewhat overweight American Curl cat. In the comic, Ray is a financially successful musician after he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for success in pop music. The character is lucky and acquires money in various ways. He tends to throw lots of parties and is generous to his friends, but he has a weakness to gambling and is occasionally rude and insensitive. Ray made his first appearance on January 10, 2002, and has since become a major character in the comic along with Roast Beef. He can be identified by his outfit - designer glasses, a thong, the occasional fur coat, and a gold medallion.

An advice column called &quot;Ray&#x27;s Place&quot; is written in character by Ray on the &quot;Achewood&quot; site.
===&quot;Roast Beef&quot; Kazenzakis===
Roast Beef Kazenzakis is an intersex cat character. His birth name was &quot;Cassandra&quot; and it is unknown where his nickname, &quot;Roast Beef,&quot; came from. He serves as one of the main characters of &quot;Achewood&quot; along with Ray. Roast Beef often serves as a foil to Ray in the strips. He is interested in Unix computer programming, poetry, and he has a wife named Molly Sanders whom he met in Heaven but eventually she came down to Earth to marry him. Despite a difficult childhood marked by poverty and trauma, including his mother killing his father, Beef battles his constant depression and suicidal thoughts. His relationship with Molly has improved his mental state, aided by light therapy. He has been shot four times in the comic.

Roast Beef has written a number of poems, both in the strip and on his in-character blog. A recurrent theme in these involves weapons disguised as food.

===Philippe===
Philippe is an undyingly optimistic and naïve young otter who resides in the house with Cornelius Bear, Lyle and Téodor, as well as Chris and Chris&#x27;s family. His housemates collectively raised him with varied success, with Téodor acting as a nurturing motherly-type; Lyle as a neglectful big brother, and Mr. Bear as a stern but gentle father. He is separated from his mother, who lives in Ohio, but they talk on the phone frequently, and have a close relationship. His mother occasionally sends him unusual presents. Other than the fact that he is deceased, nothing is known about Philippe&#x27;s father. He is implied to be of French descent, and to have fought in a war as a youth.

Philippe seems to be perpetually five years old, and celebrates his fifth birthday every year. A strip which revealed the future of the &quot;Achewood&quot; characters showed that Philippe will still be the same age, even after the other characters grow old and die. He eventually ends up moving back in with this mother, further emphasizing his young age.

His character has inspired music such as a song by the synth-pop band Freezepop titled &quot;Here Comes a Special Boy&quot; and the Song Fight! Entries for &quot;What We Need More Of Is Science&quot; by Brody and Octothorpe are two different versions of the same song about Philippe.

===Cornelius Bear===
Often referred to in the comic as Mr. Bear (and &quot;Connie&quot; by Ray), he is a bear that is a scholarly and fatherly figure to much of the cast, being much older than most of them — he was married to his first (now deceased) wife, Iris Gambol, sometime before 1967. He is characterizied by his love of alcohol, literature, his British mannerisms, and his fine taste. It has also been implied that he has been imprisoned in the past. He is well regarded for having written many different children&#x27;s books. He wears pince-nez glasses and is usually seen in a dressing gown. The other members of the cast hold him in high regard except for a character named Lyle. He owns a pub named &quot;The Dude and Catastrophe&quot; and is dating a stripper that is half his age.

===Lyle Roscoe Gabriel===
Lyle is a belligerent stuffed tiger who enjoys playing pranks on his friends and drinking. He is a talented calligrapher, cosmetician, and is knowledgeable about cars. Lyle has a mysterious past which caused him to move from Gainesville, Florida, to Achewood. Lyle is often seen drunk due to being more comfortable that way, but is intelligent when sober. He is often seen wearing a t-shirt for the band Misfits in the comic strips. He was previously employed in every position in a kitchen at one point, but now films pornography, usually involving transgender women. Lyle is close friends with the character Todd T. Squirrel, who shares his love of alcohol.

===Téodor Orezscu===
Téodor is a teddy bear. He originates from Minsk, Belarus and is of Jewish descent. He is a skilled cook, musician, and graphic designer, and is also portrayed as being an all around friendly guy. His personality was originally quite crazy, exhibiting nudist tendencies in early &quot;Achewood&quot; strips, though he seems to have dropped those in later strips. He is also depicted using marijuana and mushrooms. While talented and intelligent, he is often portrayed as lacking motivation and direction except when exercising or cooking. He had an online relationship with a girl named Penny, and eventually it is shown how the relationship ended up. Penny made Téodor the T-emblazoned sweater he wears in the comic, leaving it as a gift for him. While the other stuffed animals of the house treat Philippe as a roommate, Téodor instead fills the role of Philippe&#x27;s guardian while the otter is separated from his mother. Téodor died in the April 28, 2005 comic strip due to choking on a bottle cap but was revived when Lyle kicked him in the gut. Onstad has claimed that Téodor is similar to him in real life.

===Patrick Reynolds===
Pat is one of the three original cat characters, along with Roast Beef and Ray. His role has receded into the background over the webcomic&#x27;s runtime, but his is still a notable presence. He is a generally an unpleasant character with a negative attitude and is often the antagonist in many strips. He has high standards for other characters and gets angry when they do not meet them. Pat also seems to look down on various occupations such as barbers and disabled people. He seems to suffer from OCD and anger issues, for which he attends a support group for. He is into Zen Buddhism and veganism to look superior to his friends, but he secretly prefers to eat meat. He was put in jail for shooting the character Roast Beef, but escaped and got off the hook due to Ray&#x27;s connections. He lives with a serial killer he met in jail named Peter &quot;Nice Pete&quot; Cropes. Pat disowned his father, Simon Reynolds, due to Simon coming out as gay. However, Pat later came out as gay as well due to a family curse and has been dating a gay porn star named Rod Huggins. 

===Molly Sanders===
Molly, a cat character, was born in 17th-century Wales. She died in a shipwreck in 1676 and went to Heaven, where she was able to keep up on developments in the living world and became interested in modern technology. Roast Beef first met her in Heaven after Pat shot him. Molly now resides on Earth, living in Ray&#x27;s pool shed with Roast Beef after her and Roast Beef got married. Roast Beef&#x27;s lack of social skills means their relationship is often strained, but Molly&#x27;s patience and tolerance often win out. Molly picked up programming in Heaven, but since she died long before computers and coding were invented she has no official qualifications and was forced to get a job in the service industry. She has held different jobs over the course of the comic, but now works at a Starbucks. She runs an in-universe show named the &quot;Achewood A-List.&quot;

==Early development of the series==
In the early months of &quot;Achewood&quot;, the strip takes place entirely at Chris Onstad&#x27;s house, and the four original characters, Philippe, Téodor, Lyle, and Cornelius Bear, are implied to be essentially trapped there. They are forced to hide from normal people due to being alive stuffed animals, and there is no mention of having jobs, money, or any real responsibilities. After Ray, Roast Beef and Pat are introduced, however, the characters begin to assume more complex personalities and exercise greater independence. The transition from a gag-a-day webcomic to a more involved one happened abruptly during an extended story arc called &quot;The Party,&quot; the first of the long-form storylines which would become a staple of &quot;Achewood&quot;. Subsequent chapters establish more clearly defined relationships between the characters, add additional depth to their personalities, and follow the main cast through other major story arcs.

At the beginning of &quot;Achewood&quot;, the two main characters, Ray and Roast Beef were background characters. They were a part of a trio of cats, along with Pat, who always appeared together and were known for their vulgar insults. Only Ray and Pat were given names originally. As time passed, Ray and Beef were given more and more panel time, eventually becoming the central characters of the strip, with the original four main characters taking on supporting roles.

==Other features==
Chris Onstad has also produced other material within the &quot;Achewood&quot; &#x27;universe&#x27;, including:
* Various blogs written by some of the comic&#x27;s characters.
* A zine, &quot;Man Why You Even Got to Do a Thing&quot;, purportedly written by Roast Beef (publication halted since Issue 7).
* Two novellas by the character Nice Pete.
* &quot;The Achewood Cookbook&quot;, aimed mainly at beginners, in which the characters provide recipes and cooking advice. Onstad was frustrated by &quot;The French Laundry Cookbook&quot;, finding it &quot;essentially useless to any home cook&quot;, and wrote his own cookbook aimed at &quot;guys who are just out of college and have one pan and one electric burner&quot;. Onstad believed that doing such a task would be entertaining and challenging. Onstad visited a supermarket chain store and bought eggs, ground beef, and mustard, and created around 50 recipes based around them. The book includes recipes for cocktails, Scotch eggs, hot dogs, chicken, orzo, and other foods and drinks. Ray Smuckles presents all of the cocktails. Danielle Maestretti of &quot;Utne Reader&quot; said that the recipes range in appeal and complexity.
* A former feature called &quot;Current Kid Status&quot;, in which Onstad documented the joys, travails and current events of raising his son. It ran from his son&#x27;s birth in March 2005, until 27 November 2007. A compendium of these bits has been packaged into a book and is available for purchase at The Achewood Store.
* The &quot;Achewood&quot; Store, which includes such items as clothing, cookbooks, aprons, glasses and other assorted goods.
* A Twitter page, once featuring tweets about the daily activities of the &quot;Achewood&quot; characters, but now focusing on the life of Onstad himself.

==Reception==
As of April 10, 2007, &quot;Achewood&quot; received about ten million page views monthly. James Norton of &quot;Salon.com&quot; said that the &quot;well-developed cast of characters, many of whom just happen to be seriously into good food&quot; get the attention of the audience.

===Awards===
On September 12, 2007, &quot;Achewood&quot; was named &quot;Funniest Webcomic&quot; by humour website Cracked.com.

&quot;Achewood&quot; received the Ignatz Award in 2007 and 2008 for Outstanding Online Comic.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Lev Grossman named it number one on its list of the top 10 graphic novels of 2007.

In November 2009, &quot;Achewood&quot; was named one of the best comics of the &#x27;00s by The A.V. Club.

In November 2019, &quot;Achewood&quot; ranked #14 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s list of &quot;The 50 Best Non-Superhero Graphic Novels&quot;.

&quot;Achewood&quot; has been nominated for multiple Web Cartoonists&#x27; Choice Awards:
* 2004: 
* 2005: 
* 2006: , , &amp;

==Author==
Chris Onstad was born June 14, 1975, in California and grew up in a small town near Sonora, in the Sierra foothills. Onstad attended Stanford University, where he edited the Stanford Chaparral humor magazine. Onstad has published several books: nine anthologies of &quot;Achewood&quot; comics; a humorous cookbook featuring recipes purportedly invented by the strip&#x27;s characters; &quot;A Wonderful Tale&quot;, a book written from the perspective of a character from the strip; and that same character&#x27;s second novel &quot;A Hilarious Comedy&quot;. He has also published six editions of &quot;Man Why You Even Got to Do a Thing,&quot; an &quot;Achewood&quot;-centric zine.

Onstad reveals little of his private life online, but it is known that he currently lives in Portland, Oregon. Chris and his first wife have a son, born in 2005. Onstad formerly had a section on his website about his son, titled &quot;current kid status,&quot; which he updated regularly with stories and happenings. These are collected in the self-published book &quot;Current Baby Status – The Collected Archive.&quot; In a February 23, 2012, interview with &quot;The Believer&quot; Onstad revealed that he had divorced from his wife.

Chris Onstad has self-published sixteen books: seven collections of &quot;Achewood&quot; comics, two books by character Nice Pete (&quot;A Wonderful Tale&quot; and &quot;A Hilarious Comedy&quot;), six &#x27;zines by another named Roast Beef, and &quot;Recipes for a Lady or a Man: The Achewood Cookbook&quot; with recipes from several of the main characters. A second cookbook, titled &quot;You Can&#x27;t Put Cream Sauce on the Truth, The Achewood Cookbook Vol 2&quot; was published in 2022.

In September 2013, Onstad launched a new business, Portland Soda Works.

In September 2024, Onstad remarried.

===Influences===
Onstad remarked in an interview that &quot;You can&#x27;t help but be affected by Mark Twain books, Lay&#x27;s Potato Chip ads, a fat lady who is yelling outside, David Letterman, etc.&quot; And elsewhere, to Brian M. Palmer, &quot;The reader would likely be a better judge.&quot; He has expressed admiration for Chris Ware and Tony Millionaire. He has also claimed to be influenced by &quot;Bryson, Barry, Twain, Elton, Wodehouse, Adams, Vonnegut, John Irving, Arthur Conan Doyle, Jack Handey, Al Franken, that sort of thing. Those sorts of guys. Tina Fey. Aaron Sorkin.&quot;

In another interview with Brian Palmer, he professed his admiration for the British comedy show &quot;Look Around You&quot; and also stated, &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen anything that tops &quot;Mr. Show&quot;.&quot;

In regards to the influence of the culinary culture, Onstad said that he always enjoyed eating food. Onstad said that when he met his first wife, she was &quot;a bit more of a cook&quot; than he was; she had traveled to Italy to study abroad. Since he was, in his words, &quot;mostly omnivorous&quot; and she is a vegetarian, the two have to find food that can appeal to both of them. Onstad added that he is &quot;competitive&quot; and aims to &quot;do a good job with these things and impress people.&quot; In addition, since Onstad&#x27;s wife was an employee of Williams Sonoma, the two received discounted high end cookware that they normally would not have bought. On January 27, 2012, it was announced that Onstad would be the new food critic for the Portland Mercury.

<doc id="310623" wikidata="Q1988417" url="?curid=310623" title="Chinatown, London">
<text>Chinatown is an ethnic enclave in the City of Westminster, London, bordering Soho to its north and west, Theatreland to the south and east. The enclave currently occupies the area in and around Gerrard Street. It contains a number of Chinese restaurants, bakeries, supermarkets, souvenir shops, and other Chinese-run businesses. The first Chinatown was located in Limehouse in the East End.

==History==
The first area in London known as Chinatown was located in the Limehouse area of the East End of London. At the start of the 20th century, the Chinese population of London was concentrated in that area, setting up businesses which catered to the Chinese sailors who frequented in Docklands. The area was known through exaggerated reports and tales of slum housing and (the then-legal) opium dens, rather than the Chinese restaurants and supermarkets of the current Chinatown. However, much of the area was damaged by aerial bombing during the Blitz in the Second World War, although a number of elderly Chinese still choose to live in this area. After the Second World War, however, the growing popularity of Chinese cuisine and an influx of immigrants from Hong Kong led to an increasing number of Chinese restaurants being opened elsewhere.

The present Chinatown, which is off Shaftesbury Avenue did not start to be established until the 1970s. Previously, it was a regular Soho area, run-down, with Gerrard Street the main thoroughfare. It was dominated by the Post Office, facing Macclesfield Street, and other major establishments were The Tailor &amp; Cutter House, at 43/44, now a Chinese supermarket and restaurant, the Boulogne Restaurant, near the Wardour Street end, and by Peter Mario&#x27;s Restaurant at the other end. Other businesses included a master baker&#x27;s, the Sari Centre, Lesgrain French Coffee House, Harrison Marks&#x27; Glamour Studio, an Indian restaurant and various brothels. Probably the first Chinese restaurants opened in Lisle Street, parallel to Gerrard Street, and more opened gradually; one of the first restaurants was Kowloon Restaurant. The Tailor &amp; Cutter did not close down until around 1974. The area now has more than 80 restaurants.

In 2005, the property developer Rosewheel proposed a plan to redevelop the eastern part of Chinatown. The plan was opposed by many of the existing retailers in Chinatown, as they believe that the redevelopment would drive out the traditional Chinese retail stores from the area and change the ethnic characteristic of Chinatown. In October 2013 and July 2018, the London Chinatown Community Centre (LCCC) organised a one-day shutdown in protest of violent tactics by immigration officers from the Home Office.

The London Chinatown Community Centre (LCCC) has been housed in the Chinatown area since it was founded in 1980 by Dr Abraham Lue. The Centre claims to have received 40,000 people for help and assistance since its foundation. Located since 1998 on the second floor of 28-29 Gerrard Street, the Centre relocated to 2 Leicester Court in 2012, above the Hippodrome Casino.

On 25 July 2016, a new Chinatown gate on Wardour Street was opened by Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. It was made by Chinese artisans and assembled in London. The gate is in the style of the Qing dynasty.

There was a Chinese-style pavilion at Newport Place from the 1980s which was a popular meeting point, but it was demolished in 2016 after more than thirty years, despite protests. The development authorities had plans to renovate and enlarge the square. The construction of a new pavilion at a different location was announced.

==Geography==
Chinatown has no officially defined size, but it has commonly been considered to approximately encompass Gerrard Street, the bottom half of Wardour Street, Rupert Street and Rupert Court, a section of Shaftesbury Avenue and Lisle Street, Macclesfield Street and Newport Place, Newport Court and Little Newport Street.

<text>TAM (Tovarna avtomobilov Maribor – English: Maribor Automobile Factory) is a Slovenian commercial vehicle manufacturer based in Maribor. It was established in 2011 as part of a multinational conglomerate, with CHTC China Hi-Tech Group Corporation as the majority owner, and integrated into the heritage brand TAM of Slovenia in 2012.

The company currently emphasises on producing city buses, airport buses and coaches.

==Product Line==
TAM has a longstanding history of producing vehicles. While the company used to produce different types of vehicles ranging from military trucks, light trucks, heavy trucks, fire trucks, buses and even vehicle components like engines, it now only focuses on buses.

Current line up of buses:

* airport buses called VIVAIR
* electric buses called VERO
* coaches called VIVE

==History==

In 1938, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia launched a competition to find a truck design that would be license produced in the country. The competing vehicles had to complete a journey across Yugoslav roads of poor quality. The RN won and in 1938, the &quot;Zavodi Aleksandar Ranković (ZAR)&quot;, ancestor of post WWII Industrija Motora Rakovica (IMR) plant near Belgrade, started to receive parts for assembly, the first Yugoslav manufactured vehicle rolling off the production line in 1940. Production was cut short by the invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941.

Production resumed in 1947 with the name Pionir, but by 1950 less than 1,200 had been made. Production was therefore moved from Serbia to Tovarna avtomobilov Maribor in Maribor. The origin of the Maribor factory lies with the German occupying forces. In 1942 a site outside the city was set up to manufacture aircraft parts. To maintain production under allied air attacks, some of the plant was in tunnels. Some 17,146 vehicles, known as TAM Pionir, were produced during the next fifteen years. The majority were flatbed trucks, but a number of fire engines, buses and other vehicles were also produced.

TAM&#x27;s first model, the TAM Pionir, was built under license from the Czechoslovak company Praga, and was manufactured until 1962, with a total of 17,416 produced in that period.

TAM quickly became Yugoslavia&#x27;s leading truck manufacturer. In 1958, it began manufacturing vehicles under license from the German company Magirus-Deutz. In 1961, the company was renamed to Tovarna Avtomobilov in Motorjev Maribor (&quot;Maribor Automobile and Engine Factory&quot;), however the TAM acronym and logo were retained. At its height, it employed more than 8,000 workers; however, the economic decline of the 1980s saw financial difficulties, and in 1996 the company was dissolved.

TAM was succeeded by TVM (Tovarna vozil Maribor – translated: Maribor Vehicle Factory) in 2001, producing MAN trucks under license primarily for the Slovenian Army. TVM became part of the Viator &amp; Vector group, and continued for some years until the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008. The company ended in bankruptcy in 2011 with debts totaling over €62 million.

The company was resuscitated in 2014 under the name TAM - Europe with Chinese investment from China Hi-Tech Group Corporation group. Its main product line is airside buses for airports, followed by coaches and electric buses called &quot;VERO&quot;.

==Past Product Line==
*TAM Pionir (License made Praga RN-RND)
*TAM 75
*TAM 80
*TAM 90
*TAM 100
*TAM 110 T7 B/BV (1976–1991)
*TAM 125
*TAM 130
*TAM 150 T11 B/BV (1979–1991)
*TAM 162
*TAM 170
*TAM 190
*TAM 260
*TAM 6500
*TAM 2001


==Logo==
The TAM logo resembles a three-leafed clover standing on point, with each lobe containing one letter of the acronym and a small five-pointed star occupying the center. When the company received the new investment in 2014, it also rebranded to a new logo.

==Past vehicle naming convention==
In the past, TAM used to have a special naming convention for its trucks. However, this naming convention is no longer used for its modern bus product lines.

TAM trucks were assigned a string of three variables, number-letter-number; for example, model 190 T 11.

*The first number represents engine power (in hp).
*The letter T stands for the Slovenian word &quot;&quot;tovornjak&quot; (truck).
*The second number (11) represents the Max. permissible total weight (in tons, payload and tare/dead weight combined).

TAM buses were assigned a string of four variables, number-letter-number-letter, for example: 260 A 116 M.
*The first number represents engine power.
*The letter A stands for the word &quot;avtobus&quot; (bus).
*The second number represents the length of the bus in decimetres (in this case it is 11,6 m).
*The second letter could be either M, P, or T, for &quot;mestni&quot; (city bus), &quot;&quot;primestni&quot; (suburban bus), or &quot;&quot;turistični&quot;&quot; (tourist bus).

<doc id="310637" wikidata="Q794547" url="?curid=310637" title="Bahamut">
<text>Bahamut, or Bahamoot ( ; ), according to Zakariya al-Qazwini, is a monster that lies deep below, underpinning the support structure that holds up the earth.

In this conception of the world, the earth is shouldered by an angel, who stands on a slab of gemstone, which is supported by the cosmic beast (ox) sometimes called Kuyutha&#x27;(/Kuyuthan)/Kiyuban/Kibuthan (plausibly a corruption or misrendering of Hebrew לִוְיָתָן &quot;Leviathan&quot;). Bahamut carries this bull on its back, and is suspended in water for its own stability.

Balhūt is a variant name found in some cosmographies. In the earliest sources, the name is Lutīyā, with Balhūt given as a byname and Bahamūt as a nickname.

==Orthography==
&quot;Bahamūt&quot; is the spelling given in al-Qazwini (d. 1283)&#x27;s cosmography. &quot;Bahamoot&quot; is Edward Lane&#x27;s transcribed spelling. &quot;Balhūt&quot; is the alternate spelling given in Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1229)&#x27;s geographic work and copies of Ibn al-Wardi (d. 1457)&#x27;s work.

The name is thought to derive from the biblical Behemoth (; cf. Job 40:15-24), and it was thus rendered in German as &quot;Behemot&quot; by Ethé. However, the original biblical Behemoth never appeared as a fish. A reshaping of its nature must have occurred in Arab storytelling, some time in the pre-Islamic period. One proposed scenario is that a pair of beasts from the Bible were confused with each other: the behemoth mis-assigned to the fish, and the aquatic leviathan to the bull.

==Lane&#x27;s summary==
Bahamut, according to Lane&#x27;s abstract of a particular Islamic work on cosmography, is a giant fish acting as one of the layers that supports the earth. It is so immense &quot;[all] the seas of the world, placed in one of the fish&#x27;s nostrils, would be like a mustard seed laid in the desert&quot;. Above the fish stands a bull called Kuyootà, on the bull, a &quot;ruby&quot; rock, on the rock an angel to shoulder the earth. Below the Bahamut (Leviathan) is the colossus serpentine Falak.

Lane&#x27;s primary Islamic source for his summary is unclear, as Lane merely refers to it ly as &quot;the work of one of the writers above quoted&quot;.

==Arabic sources==

There are a number of Islamic cosmographical treatises, of more or less similar content.

There can occur certain discrepancies in Western translations, even when there are no textual differences in the Arabic. The creature, named Bahamut or Balhut in these sources, can be described as a fish or whale according to translation, since the original Arabic word &quot;hūt&quot; (حوت) can mean either. Also, the gem comprising the slab beneath the angel&#x27;s feet, in Arabic &quot;yāqūt&quot; () is of ambiguous meaning, and can be rendered as &quot;ruby&quot;, or variously otherwise.

===Cosmography===

====Qazwini group====
Al-Damiri (d. 1405) on authority of Wahb ibn Munabbih was one of Lane&#x27;s sources, possibly the source of his main summary. His description of &quot;Bahmût&quot; (French translation) matches Lane&#x27;s summary down to certain key details. However, there seems to be discrepancies in using &quot;a heap of sand&quot; (instead of &quot;mustard&quot;) in the size analogy.

Al-Qazwini (d. 1283)&#x27;s cosmography &quot;The Wonders of Creation&quot; on the contrary agrees with Lane on these points. However, it disagrees somewhat with Lane&#x27;s description regarding what lies below the fish: water, air, then a region of darkness, and with respect to the bull&#x27;s appendages. It should be cautioned that Qazwini&#x27;s cosmography is known to exist in a variety of different manuscripts.

Both cosmographies provide the story as words spoken by Wahb ibn Munabbih, so the descriptions should be similar at the core. In fact, Al-Damiri&#x27;s version is considered to be mere redactions of Qazwini printed onto its margins.

====Yakut group====

Ibn al-Wardi (d. 1457) (&quot;Kharīdat al-ʿAjā&#x27;ib&quot;, &quot;The Pearl of Wonders&quot;) is another source used by Lane, to give variant readings. Its chapter that includes the cosmography has been deemed a copy of Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1229)&#x27;s &quot;Mu&#x27;jam al-Buldan&quot;, with similar wording, with some rearrangements, and very slight amounts of discrepant information.

&quot;Balhūt&quot; is the name of the great fish given in both Ibn al-Wardi and Yaqut.

Yakut and al-Wardi both say there is a layer of sandhill between the bull and the fish. They also describe what lies under the fish somewhat differently.

These texts connect the cosmic fish and bull with phenomena of nature, namely the waxing and ebbing of tides, maintenance of the sea-level, and earthquakes. The account which only connects concerns the bull states that its breathing causes the waxing and ebbing of the tides. And since the fish and the bull drink the water running off the earth into the sea, they counteract the tap-off causing sea-level to rise. But the beasts will eventually become engorged, when they will become agitated, or, it marks the advent of Judgment Day (Ibn al-Wardi, Yaqut).

===Lives of prophets===

There are two &quot;Qiṣaṣ al-anbīyāʾ&quot; (&quot;Lives of the Prophets&quot;), one by al-Tha&#x27;labi, known otherwise for his &quot;Tafsir al-Thalabi&quot;, the other by Muḥammad al-Kisāʾī which are considered the oldest authorities containing similar cosmographical descriptions concerning the big fish and bull. In al-Tha&#x27;labi&#x27;s text is an on the whale having several names, as follows: &quot;God created a large fish (nūn) which is a huge whale whose name (ism) is Lutīyā, by-name (kunyah) Balhūt, and nickname (laqab) Bahamūt&quot;.
==Earthquakes==
Yakut also gives the account that Iblis almost incited the whale Balhūt into causing a quake, but God distracted it by sending gnats to its eyes. Or alternatively, God had sent a sword-like fish that bedazzled and captivated the giant fish. This account is also found in al-Tha&#x27;labi&#x27;s &quot;Qiṣaṣ al-anbīyāʾ&quot;, but in that version God forces the whale (Lutīyā) into submission by sending a creature that invaded through its nose and reached its brain; it also claims to be an anecdote on authority of Kaʿb al-Aḥbār (d. 650s A.D.), a convert considered the earliest informant of Jewish-Muslim tradition to Arab writers.

Although this is an instance of an Arabic tale that ascribes the origins of earthquakes to the cosmic whale/fish supporting the earth, more familiar beliefs in medieval Arab associate the earthquake with the bull, or with Mount Qaf.

Jorge Luis Borges has drawn parallels between Bahamut and the mythical Japanese fish &quot;Jinshin-Uwo&quot;, although the correct term would be ; cf. &quot;Namazu-e&quot; or &#x27;catfish pictures&#x27;.

Japanese folklorist has explained that the traditional belief in the earthquake-causing bull is heavily concentrated in Arab regions (Saharan Africa, Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, Malay), whereas the motif of &quot;World-Fish&#x27;s movement causes earthquake&quot; is found mostly in parts of Indochina, China, and throughout Japan.

==Borges==
According to Jorge Luis Borges&#x27;s work, the &quot;Book of Imaginary Beings&quot; (1957), Bahamut is &quot;altered and magnified&quot; from Behemoth and described as so immense that a human cannot bear its sight.

Borges placed Bahamut as the identity of the unnamed giant fish which Isa (Jesus) witnessed in the story of the 496th night of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (Burton&#x27;s edition). This giant fish supports a bull, the bull a rock, and the rock an angel, exactly as in the traditional Perso-Arabic medieval model of the world. Borges appropriated the description of the Bahamut from Edward Lane&#x27;s &quot;Arabian Society in the Middle Ages&quot;.

==In popular culture==

* In the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; tabletop role-playing game, Bahamut is the dragon god of justice, and is the first instance of the name being used for a dragon.
* In the &quot;Rage of Bahamut&quot; collectible card game and its anime adaptation, Bahamut is an ancient dragon with the capability to destroy the world. In the anime, preventing or aiding Bahamut&#x27;s release is the goal of most of the story&#x27;s factions. This Bahamut later appears in &quot;Granblue Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Dragalia Lost&quot;.
* In the &quot;Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle&quot; light novel series, manga and anime adaptations, Bahamut is a divine drag-ride wielded by the main character Lux Arcadia with the ability to warp reality by compression and strengthening local laws of reality using its divine raiment Reload on Fire.
* In the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; video game series, Bahamut is one of the most prominent summons – monsters that can be brought into battle to fight for their summoner. It appears in almost all installments of the series, with the exception of &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;, where its name is used for the game&#x27;s final dungeon, Sky Fortress Bahamut.
* The album &quot;Bahamut&quot; by New York–based musical group Hazmat Modine features a song called &quot;Bahamut&quot; as its third track.
* Several characters from the anime series &quot;Beyblade Burst&quot; have used a Bahamut Bey, a defense type. It is most often depicted as a black and purple dragon with accents of teal and red.
* Bahamut is one of the nine guardians in La-Mulana.
* In author Brandon Mull&#x27;s YA fantasy novel Fablehaven, the demon Bahamut is imprisoned on the preserve, and freed by the witch Muriel Taggert during the events of book one.
* In &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage&quot;, “Al-Bahamut” is the cryptonym adopted by Qabiha, a member of the Persian branch of the Order of the Ancients based in the Abbasid Caliphate.

<doc id="310638" wikidata="Q5094624" url="?curid=310638" title="Cheyne Walk">
<text>Cheyne Walk is a historic road in Chelsea, London, England, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. It runs parallel with the River Thames. Before the construction of Chelsea Embankment reduced the width of the Thames here, it fronted the river along its whole length.

==Location==
At its western end, Cheyne Walk meets Cremorne Road end-on at the junction with Lots Road. The Walk runs alongside the River Thames until Battersea Bridge where, for a short distance, it is replaced by Chelsea Embankment with part of its former alignment being occupied by Ropers Gardens. East of Old Church Street and Chelsea Old Church, the Walk runs along the north side of Albert Bridge Gardens and Chelsea Embankment Gardens parallel with Chelsea Embankment. At the north end of Albert Bridge, the Walk merges with Chelsea Embankment. The Walk ends at Royal Hospital Road.

At the western end between Lots Road and Battersea Bridge is a collection of residential houseboats that have been &quot;in situ&quot; since the 1930s. At the eastern end is the Chelsea Physic Garden with its cedars. It marks the boundary of the, now withdrawn, extended London Congestion Charge Zone. The section west of Battersea Bridge forms part of the A3220 road.

==History==

Cheyne Walk takes its name from William Cheyne, Viscount Newhaven who owned the manor of Chelsea until 1712. Most of the houses were built in the early 18th century. Before the construction in the 19th century of the busy Chelsea Embankment, which now runs in front of it, the houses fronted the River Thames. The most prominent building is Carlyle Mansions. Chelsea Old Church dates from 1157 and Crosby Hall is a reconstructed medieval merchant&#x27;s house relocated from the City of London in 1910.

In 1951, the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea planned to construct a new river wall straightening the river bank west of Battersea Bridge. On the reclaimed land behind the wall a new arterial road and public gardens were to be constructed. Cheyne Walk was to remain unchanged to the north of the new public gardens. The works would have reduced the foreshore and required the removal of the house boat berths. The works did not take place. In the 1960s, plans for the Greater London Council&#x27;s London Motorway Box project would have seen the West Cross Route, a motorway standard elevated road, constructed from Battersea to Harlesden through Earl&#x27;s Court. A spur road would have been constructed from the motorway to the junction of Cheyne Walk and Lots Road. The plans were abandoned because of the cost and opposition from local communities.

Brunel House at 105-106 Cheyne Walk was designed by Frederick MacManus and Partners Architects in the 1950s and was awarded the RIBA London Architecture Bronze Medal for 1957.

In 1972, number 96 Cheyne Walk, the then home of Philip Woodfield, a British civil servant, was the site of a top secret meeting between the British government and the leadership of the Provisional IRA aimed at ending the violence in Northern Ireland. The talks were inconclusive and the violence soon started again.

<text>Twenty Years After () is a novel by Alexandre Dumas, first serialized from January to August 1845. A book of &quot;The d&#x27;Artagnan Romances&quot;, it is a sequel to &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1844) and precedes the 1847–1850 novel &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot; (which includes the sub-plot &quot;Man in the Iron Mask&quot;).

The novel follows events in France during the Fronde, during the childhood reign of Louis XIV, and in England near the end of the English Civil War, leading up to the victory of Oliver Cromwell and the execution of King Charles I. Through the words of the main characters, particularly Athos, Dumas comes out on the side of the monarchy in general, or at least the text often praises the &quot;idea&quot; of benevolent royalty. Setting aside their political differences, the musketeers are valiant and just in their efforts to save the doomed Charles I.

==Synopsis==
===D&#x27;Artagnan and Mazarin===
The action begins during the regency of Queen Anne of Austria (term 1643–1651), with Cardinal Mazarin as First Minister. D&#x27;Artagnan, who seemed to have a promising career ahead of him at the end of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, has for twenty years remained a lieutenant, and seems unlikely to progress despite his ambition and the debt the Queen owes to him. He is summoned by Mazarin, who requires an escort; the French people detest Mazarin, and are on the brink of rebellion (La Fronde). D&#x27;Artagnan is sent to the Bastille to retrieve a prisoner, who turns out to be his former adversary, and then a friend, the Comte de Rochefort.

Rochefort is brought to an audience with Mazarin, where he learns that the cause for his imprisonment was his refusal to serve Mazarin five years ago. When asked about reliable and resourceful men that Mazarin can employ, Rochefort tells Mazarin about the respect and awe d&#x27;Artagnan and his friends commanded in old times. Though Rochefort offers his services to Mazarin, he immediately refuses to watch over the imprisoned Duc de Beaufort, his personal friend. Mazarin orders the return of the prisoner to the Bastille, but on his way there Rochefort escapes. 

Having determined that d&#x27;Artagnan is the man he seeks, Mazarin enters the chambers of the Queen to let her know that he has enlisted the man who had served her so well twenty years earlier (in adventures covered in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;). The Queen, feeling guilty for having forgotten d&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s service, gives Mazarin a diamond ring to return to d&#x27;Artagnan, one which she had previously given him that d&#x27;Artagnan sold. The avaricious Mazarin merely uses the diamond to show d&#x27;Artagnan that he is once again to enter the Queen&#x27;s service. He commissions d&#x27;Artagnan to go in search of his friends.

===Reunion of the four musketeers===
D&#x27;Artagnan is at a loss; he has completely lost touch with his friends, who have resumed their real names. Athos, the Comte de la Fère, had returned to his estate near Blois; Porthos, Monsieur du Vallon, had married a rich lawyer&#x27;s widow; and Aramis became a priest, the Abbé d&#x27;Herblay. Fortune intervenes when Planchet, his old servant, enters d&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s chambers, attempting to escape arrest for aiding the escape of Rochefort. Through Planchet, he locates Bazin, Aramis&#x27; old servant, now beadle at Notre Dame. Though Bazin is unwilling to help, d&#x27;Artagnan is able to find out, through an altar boy, that Bazin makes frequent visits to Noisy. D&#x27;Artagnan and Planchet go there, where they are set upon by a group who think them Frondeurs while outside the house of Madame de Longueville. When this group is satisfied that d&#x27;Artagnan is not the man they seek, Aramis surprises Planchet by dropping onto his horse from the tree in which he had been hiding.

D&#x27;Artagnan finds that the former musketeer, who had thought of little other than being a priest, is now a priest who thinks of little other than being a soldier. Aramis is not willing to enter into Mazarin&#x27;s service, however. D&#x27;Artagnan leaves but waits in hiding, suspecting that Aramis is both the Frondeur who had been sought earlier and the lover of Madame de Longueville. His suspicions are confirmed.

The visit to Aramis was not fruitless, as it yielded the address of Porthos. When d&#x27;Artagnan arrives at Porthos&#x27; estate he finds Mousqueton, who is overjoyed to meet d&#x27;Artagnan and Planchet. He finds that Porthos, despite his wealth and life spent in pursuit of amusement, is not happy. Porthos who envies nobles of high origin desires to become a baron, and with this bait d&#x27;Artagnan lures him into Mazarin&#x27;s service.

D&#x27;Artagnan continues his search for Athos, whom he finds almost completely changed, set to live as an example to his ward, Raoul. Though Athos will not be enlisted into Mazarin&#x27;s service, and indeed reveals that his sympathies lie against Mazarin, the two arrange to meet again in Paris. Athos wishes to bring Raoul there to help him to become a gentleman, and also to separate him from Louise de la Vallière, a seven-years old girl living nearby, with whom Raoul is obsessively in love. In Paris, Athos visits Madame de Chevreuse, an influential court politician and a former mistress of Aramis, with whom, under the name Marie Michon, Aramis had much communication in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. Athos reveals, discreetly, that Raoul is the son born of a chance encounter that Athos had with her, and through her gets a letter of recommendation for Raoul to join the army.

===The Duc de Beaufort===
The scene then changes, to focus on the Duc de Beaufort, Mazarin&#x27;s prisoner at Vincennes, who finds a new jailer, Athos&#x27; servant, the silent Grimaud. Grimaud instantly makes himself disagreeable to the Duc, as part of an escape plot. Using messages passed to Rochefort using tennis balls, they arrange to have a meal on Whitsuntide, to which La Ramée, second in command of the prison, is invited. The escape is successful, but d&#x27;Artagnan and Porthos, on Mazarin&#x27;s orders, are in pursuit.

After a race against time, and having defeated several adversaries along the way, Porthos and d&#x27;Artagnan find themselves on a dark road, surrounded, with swords crossed against adversaries equal to them, who are revealed to be Athos and Aramis. The four arrange to meet in Paris at the Place Royale. In a dramatic scene, the four friends come close to fighting each other, yet stop, reconcile, and renew their vows of friendship, which they value higher than any political alliances.

===Mordaunt===

Raoul is travelling to join the army that wages a war again Spain under the command of Prince de Condé. On the road, he saves the life of a young nobleman, Comte de Guiche, and the two become friends. Two days later, de Guiche saves Raoul&#x27;s life in a skirmish with Spanish soldiers. After they defeat their enemies, they find a church servant close to death who requests the last rites. They help him to a nearby inn and find a traveling monk. When the monk does not seem inclined to perform this service, they have to force him to go to the inn. 

At the confession, the man reveals that he has been the official executioner in the town of Béthune for many years, yet his only regret is that he took part in the execution of some noble woman, Milady de Winter, twenty years ago. The monk reveals himself as her son, John Francis de Winter, who calls himself Mordaunt after Charles I stripped him of all his titles. Mordaunt stabs the executioner. Grimaud, who is travelling to join Raoul, arrives to the inn just in time to learn, from the dying man, about the Mordaunt&#x27;s existence and rushes back to warn Athos. 

After joining the army of Prince de Condé, Raoul proves himself by assisting the Prince in interrogating a prisoner. The information that Conde acquires from the prisoner helps him to a decisive victory in the Battle of Lens. In a short time, 15-years old Raoul earns a reputation of a valiant soldier and becomes a Prince de Condé favorite. 

d´Artagnan and Porthos help Queen Anne of Austria, the young Louis XIV and Mazarin escape Paris after its citizens finally start a rebellion. The champion of the French populace and parliament, Pierre Broussel, is arrested, but then released when it becomes clear that his imprisonment has only served to stir the crowd up worse. D´Artagnan meets the young king and watches over him as some Frondeurs - including Planchet, under a false name - who wanted to make sure that the king and queen were not about to escape, enter the king&#x27;s bedroom demanding to see him. Immediately after this, he contrives for all of the royal household to escape from Paris anyway, bluffing his way past Planchet at the gates (the two men retain their friendship despite their differing allegiances in this conflict). 

Cardinal Mazarin sends d&#x27;Artagnan and Porthos to England with a message for Oliver Cromwell, the leader of the British Parliament&#x27;s army fighting King Charles I&#x27;s, and orders them to stay there under Cromwell&#x27;s command. At the same time, Queen Henrietta of England meets the Musketeers&#x27; old English friend, Lord de Winter - a Royalist come to ask for French assistance for King Charles I of England, her husband, in the English Civil War and sends Athos and Aramis to England as well. So once again the two pairs of Musketeers find themselves on opposite sides. Departing for England, Mordaunt, who has been following Lord de Winter, sees him with Athos and Aramis and learns that they were participants of his mother&#x27;s makeshift trial and execution twenty years ago.

===In England===

King Charles I is betrayed by the leaders of the Scottish troops he commands and taken prisoner. Mordaunt, a favorite of Cromwell&#x27;s, murders his uncle, Lord de Winter, Milady&#x27;s brother-in-law, and attempts to lay hands on Athos and Aramis, when the duo are the last men to defend Charles I. However, Athos and Aramis are captured by d&#x27;Artagnan and Porthos who are fighting under Cromwell&#x27;s troops. As soon as they have a chance to converse, Athos talks d&#x27;Artagnan and Porthos into helping to save Charles I. D&#x27;Artagnan and Porthos free their friends and start plotting to save the imprisoned king.

In the end, all their plans fail and Mordaunt turns to regicide, executing King Charles I after d&#x27;Artagnan and the three former Musketeers have kidnapped London&#x27;s official executioner in order to prevent this. D&#x27;Artagnan and his friends later confront Mordaunt at Cromwell&#x27;s secret residence, but in the course of a duel with d&#x27;Artagnan he escapes through a secret passage.

The Frenchmen and their servants leave England by ship, but Mordaunt gets aboard and blows it up. Unfortunately for him, the Musketeers&#x27; servants had earlier discovered the explosives on board, roused their masters, and contrived to steal the only lifeboat before the ship can blow up, leaving Mordaunt aboard. Mordaunt escapes the blast, and pleads with the Musketeers to let him into their boat. With the exception of Athos, they contemptuously reject his appeals. Athos insists on saving him, but as he helps him into the boat, Mordaunt deliberately drags him under the water where they struggle and Mordaunt is killed.

Athos rejoins the others, stating: &quot;I had a son. I wanted to live.&quot; This seems to confirm what d&#x27;Artagnan has long suspected, that the reason Athos&#x27;s ward, Raoul de Bragelonne whom he adopted after he was abandoned by his mother, bears such a resemblance to him is because he is Athos&#x27;s natural son. Athos further states that &quot;It was not me who killed him. It was fate.&quot;

===Finale===
Once back in France, the four friends go separate ways. D&#x27;Artagnan and Porthos head to Paris through a different route from Athos and Aramis, knowing that Mazarin will not forgive their disobedience. Aramis and Athos reach Paris only to find out that their friends have not. After looking for D&#x27;Artagnan and Porthos, they learn the duo has been imprisoned by Mazarin in Rueil. Athos tries to persuade Queen Anne to free his friends, but is imprisoned as well. 

After this, d&#x27;Artagnan manages to escape with Porthos and capture Mazarin. Mazarin is taken to one of Porthos&#x27;s castles and he makes some concessions to the four friends in exchange for his freedom. These include making Porthos a baron and making d&#x27;Artagnan a captain of Musketeers. Athos asks for nothing: Aramis asks for concessions towards himself and his friends in the Fronde. These concessions are later accepted by Queen Anne, who finally realizes she has been rather ungrateful to d&#x27;Artagnan and his friends.

At the end of the novel, the first Fronde comes to an end and Mazarin, Queen Anne, and Louis XIV enter Paris. A riot takes place during which d&#x27;Artagnan accidentally kills Rochefort and Porthos kills Bonacieux (who in the earlier novel was d&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s landlord and an agent of Richelieu and is now a beggar and Frondist). At the end the four friends once again go their separate ways. D&#x27;Artagnan stays in Paris with Mazarin and Queen Anne; Athos returns to la Fère; Aramis returns to his abbey in Noisy le Sec; and Porthos returns to his castle to enjoy his baronage.

<text>Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove or NASJRB Willow Grove was a Naval Air Station owned by the U.S. Navy and located in Horsham Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States four miles (6 km) northwest of the central business district of Willow Grove, which is north of Philadelphia. The installation was transferred to the Pennsylvania Air National Guard and the name changed to the Horsham Air Guard Station after the U.S. Navy departed in 2011.

==History==

Flight activity began in 1926 when Harold Frederick Pitcairn constructed a hangar and a grass airstrip in Horsham, Pennsylvania. The airfield was named after the nearest town Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. At the time, Horsham was a rural township with little significance. From 1926 to 1942 Pitcairn used the airfield for design, construction and testing of a number of aircraft, including the Mailwing which was used by the United States Postal Service.

After the start of World War II, the United States purchased the property, under threat of eminent domain and launched a classified anti-submarine warfare program at the base. In January 1943, the base was commissioned Naval Air Station Willow Grove. Following WWII and into the Cold War, it became an operational and training base for aviation activities of the Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces such as United States Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, United States Army Reserve and Pennsylvania National Guard. In 1994, the base was renamed Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove to reflect these joint operations. As part of its joint recruitment efforts, the base was an annual host to one of the largest air shows on the East Coast until 2006.

==Units==
NASJRB Willow Grove was home to the following:
* 111th Fighter Wing (111 FW), Pennsylvania Air National Guard, which operated the A-10 Thunderbolt II. It lost its aircraft to other ANG Squadrons and active duty components under BRAC. As of 2013, the Wing, now renamed the 111th Attack Wing, was slated to acquire ground control stations to remotely fly the MQ-9 Reaper and became operational in 2016.
* 201st RED HORSE Squadron, Detachment 1 (201 RHS), Pennsylvania Air National Guard
* 270th Engineering Installation Squadron (270 EIS), Pennsylvania Air National Guard
*Group 3 Headquarters of Pennsylvania Wing Civil Air Patrol.
*902nd Search and Rescue Squadron of Pennsylvania Wing Civil Air Patrol.
* The Liberty Bell Squadron of the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps 
* Naval Air Maintenance Training Detachment (NAMTD) 1010

The base was home to the following military aviation units:
* U.S. Army Reserve Units - A/4/158th Aviation Regiment flying UH-1H (GhostRiders), A &amp; HHC/2/228th Avn flying UH-1H, OH-58, &amp; C-12R (Winged Warriors). Outside of the USAR building on the base grounds, a retired UH-1D, used in 1974 White House helicopter incident, is on static display.
* Marine Aircraft Group 49 headquarters and HMH-772 of the Marine Air Reserve&#x27;s 4th Marine Aircraft Wing, the latter operating the CH-53E Super Stallion. Both MAG-49 and HMH-772 relocated to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in 2011. Also Reserve Marine Attack Squadron VMA-131 flying McDonnell Douglas A4 aircraft from 1972 until their deactivation in 1998. VMA-131
* Patrol Squadrons 64 (VP-64) and 66 (VP-66) of the United States Naval Reserve operating the P-3 Orion. VP-64 was later re-designated Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 64 (VR-64) and traded in its P-3 Orions for the C-130T Hercules
*Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 11 (VQ-11 &quot;Bandits&quot;, established at Willow Grove, moved to NAS Brunswick, Maine in the middle of 1997 were establishment ceremony was held at). VQ-11 &quot;Bandits&quot; was formed from VP-66 Liberty Bell&#x27;s Detachment.66 (called VQ-66 &quot;Bandits&quot;) which received the Lockheed EP-3J Electronic Orion aircraft (BuNo 152745 &amp; BuNo 152719) from VAQ-33 Firebirds in March 1993. VQ-11 was the US Naval Air Reserve&#x27;s only Reconnaissance Squadron, but performed Electronic Aggressor roles during fleet exercises.
* Fleet Logistic Support Squadrons 52 (VR-52) and 64 (VR-64) of the Naval Air Reserve, operating the C-9 Skytrain II and C-130T Hercules, respectively. Both VR-52 and VR-64 relocated to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in March 2011.
* 913th Airlift Wing (913 AW) of the Air Force Reserve Command. The 913 AW was inactivated by BRAC action on 30 September 2007.

==Base Realignment and Closure==
On May 28, 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure commission recommended that the base be closed as part of the 2005 BRAC round, that the tenant Air Force Reserve Command airlift wing be inactivated and that Navy Reserve and Marine Corps Reserve flying units relocate to McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey as tenant units.

On September 30, 2007, the Air Force Reserve Command disestablished the 913th Airlift Wing at the collocated Willow Grove ARS, and redistributed its C-130 Hercules aircraft to other active duty Air Force and Air Force Reserve units.

On February 29, 2008, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania released a report detailing a plan for a joint interagency installation (JII), with a mission of national defense, homeland security and emergency preparedness. On November 13, 2009, Pennsylvania dropped the plan for the JII based on the gradual removal of the 111th Fighter Wing. Since then it is planned that a portion of the base will be used for the National Guard and other Reserve Component military personnel.
The airfield shut down on March 31, 2011; VP-64, VR-52, and a C-12 detachment were transferred to McGuire Air Force Base.

On September 15, 2011, the base was closed. The Pennsylvania Air National Guard took custody, and the facility was to be designated Willow Grove Air National Guard Base, or Horsham Air Guard Station per source. A handful of National Guard and Army Reserve soldiers remained, and the Air Force maintained administrative offices on the property. The surplus land with the runways was turned over to Horsham Township for redevelopment. Horsham and other adjoining townships in Montgomery and Bucks Counties were debating the nature of this redevelopment.
In September 2015, the Horsham Land Redevelopment Authority worked on an &quot;economic development conveyance&quot; (EDC) application to acquire the base. An EDC transfer is one way for the Navy to dispose of federal surplus property.

<text>A blue plaque is a permanent sign installed in a public place in the United Kingdom, and certain other countries and territories, to commemorate a link between that location and a famous person, event, or former building on the site, serving as a historical marker. 

The term is used in the United Kingdom in two senses. It may be used narrowly and specifically to refer to the &quot;official&quot; scheme administered by English Heritage, and for much of its history restricted to sites within Greater London; or it may be used less formally to encompass a number of similar schemes administered by organisations throughout the UK. The plaques erected are made in a variety of designs, shapes, materials and colours: some are blue, others are not. However, the term &quot;blue plaque&quot; is often used informally to encompass all such schemes.

== History ==
The &quot;official&quot; scheme traces its origins to that launched in 1866 in London, on the initiative of the politician William Ewart, to mark the homes and workplaces of famous people. The first such scheme in the world, it has directly or indirectly provided the inspiration and model for many others. The scheme has been administered successively by the Society of Arts (1866–1901), the London County Council (1901–1965), the Greater London Council (1965–1986) and English Heritage (1986 to date). It was initially focused on Greater London, although between 1998 and 2005, under a trial programme since discontinued, 34 plaques were erected elsewhere in England. The Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023 extended the scheme to the whole of England.

Many other plaque schemes have been initiated in the United Kingdom. Some are restricted to a specific geographical area, others to a particular theme of historical commemoration. They are administered by a range of bodies including local authorities, civic societies, residents&#x27; associations and other organisations such as the Transport Trust, the Royal Society of Chemistry, the Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America and the British Comic Society. 

There are also commemorative plaque schemes throughout the world such as those in Paris, Rome, Oslo, and Dublin; and in other cities in Australia, Canada, the Philippines, Russia, and the United States. These take various forms, and they are more likely to be known as commemorative plaques or historical markers.

== English Heritage scheme ==
The original blue plaque scheme was established by the Society of Arts in 1867, and since 1986 has been run by English Heritage. It is the oldest such scheme in the world.

After being conceived by politician William Ewart in 1863, the scheme was initiated in 1866 by Ewart, Henry Cole and the Society of Arts (now the Royal Society of Arts), which erected plaques in a variety of shapes and colours.

The first plaque was unveiled in 1867 to commemorate Lord Byron at his birthplace, 24 Holles Street, Cavendish Square. This house was demolished in 1889. The earliest blue plaque to survive, also put up in 1867, commemorates Napoleon III in King Street, St James&#x27;s. Byron&#x27;s plaque was blue, but the colour was changed by the manufacturer Minton, Hollins &amp; Co to chocolate brown to save money. The first woman to be honoured with a plaque was the actor Sarah Siddons in 1876. The plaque, placed on her house in Marylebone, London, was retrieved when the house was demolished in 1905 and is now held in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

In total, the Society of Arts put up 35 plaques, fewer than half of which survive today. The Society only erected one plaque within the square-mile of the City of London, that to Samuel Johnson on his house in Gough Square, in 1876. In 1879, it was agreed that the City of London Corporation would be responsible for erecting plaques within the City to recognise its jurisdictional independence. This demarcation has remained ever since.

In 1901, the Society of Arts scheme was taken over by the London County Council (LCC), which gave much thought to the future design of the plaques. It was eventually decided to keep the basic shape and design of the Society&#x27;s plaques, but to make them uniformly blue, with a laurel wreath and the LCC&#x27;s title. Though this design was used consistently from 1903 to 1938, some experimentation occurred in the 1920s, and plaques were made in bronze, stone and lead. Shape and colour also varied.
In 1921, the most common (blue) plaque design was revised, as it was discovered that glazed Royal Doulton stoneware was cheaper than the encaustic formerly used. In 1938, a new plaque design was prepared by an unnamed student at the LCC&#x27;s Central School of Arts and Crafts and was approved by the committee. It omitted the decorative elements of earlier plaque designs, and allowed for lettering to be better spaced and enlarged. A white border was added to the design shortly after, and this has remained the standard ever since. No plaques were erected between 1915 and 1919, or between 1940 and 1947, owing to the two world wars. The LCC formalised the selection criteria for the scheme in 1954.

When the LCC was abolished in 1965, the scheme was taken over by the Greater London Council (GLC). The principles of the scheme changed little, but now applied to the entire, much larger, administrative county of Greater London. The GLC was also keen to broaden the range of people commemorated. The GLC erected 252 plaques, the subjects including Sylvia Pankhurst, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, and Mary Seacole.

In 1986, the GLC was disbanded and the blue plaques scheme passed to English Heritage. English Heritage erected more than 300 plaques in London. In January 2013 English Heritage suspended proposals for plaques owing to funding cuts. The National Trust&#x27;s chairman stated that his organisation might step in to save the scheme. In the event the scheme was relaunched by English Heritage in June 2014 with private funding (including support from a new donors&#x27; club, the Blue Plaques Club, and from property developer David Pearl). Four members of the advisory panel resigned over this transmutation. Professor David Edgerton and author and critic Gillian Darley were concerned that the scheme had been &quot;reduced to a marketing tool for English Heritage&quot;. The vice chair Dr Celina Fox and Dr Margaret Pelling stated that the scheme was &quot;being dismantled and its previous achievements discredited&quot;.

In April 2015, English Heritage was divided into two parts, Historic England (a statutory body), and the new English Heritage Trust (a charity, which took over the English Heritage operating name and logo). Responsibility for the blue plaque scheme passed to the English Heritage Trust.

The 1,000th plaque, marking the offices of the Women&#x27;s Freedom League, 1908–1915, was unveiled in 2023.

=== Criteria ===
To be eligible for an English Heritage blue plaque in London, the famous person concerned must:
* Have been dead for 20 years or have passed the centenary of their birth. Fictional characters are not eligible;
* Be considered eminent by a majority of members of their own profession; have made an outstanding contribution to human welfare or happiness;
* Have lived or worked in that building in London (excluding the City of London and Whitehall) for a significant period, in time or importance, within their life and work; be recognisable to the well-informed passer-by, or deserve national recognition.

In cases of foreigners and overseas visitors, candidates should be of international reputation or significant standing in their own country.

With regards to the location of a plaque:
* Plaques can only be erected on the actual building inhabited by a figure, not the site where the building once stood, or on buildings that have been radically altered;
* Plaques are not placed onto boundary walls, gate piers, educational or ecclesiastic buildings, or the Inns of Court;
* Buildings marked with plaques should be visible from the public highway;
* A single person may not be commemorated with more than one blue plaque in London.

Other schemes have different criteria, which are often less restrictive: in particular, it is common under other schemes for plaques to be erected to mark the sites of demolished buildings.

=== Selection process ===

Almost all the proposals for English Heritage blue plaques are made by members of the public who write or email the organisation before submitting a formal proposal.

English Heritage&#x27;s in-house historian researches the proposal, and the Blue Plaques Panel advises on which suggestions should be successful. This is composed of 12 people from various disciplines from across the country. The panel is chaired by Professor William Whyte. Other members (as at September 2023) include Richard J. Aldrich, Mihir Bose, Andrew Graham-Dixon, Claire Harman, Gus Casely-Hayford and Amy Lame. The actor and broadcaster Stephen Fry was formerly a member of the panel, and wrote the foreword to the book &quot;Lived in London: Blue Plaques and the Stories Behind Them&quot; (2009).

Roughly a third of proposals are approved in principle, and are placed on a shortlist. Because the scheme is so popular, and because a lot of detailed research has to be carried out, it takes about three years for each case to reach the top of the shortlist. Proposals not taken forward can only be re-proposed once 10 years have elapsed.

===Manufacture===
From 1923, soon after the standardisation of the design in 1921, the plaques were manufactured by Royal Doulton which continued their production until 1955. From 1984 until 2015 they were made by Frank Ashworth at his studio in Cornwall, and were then inscribed by his wife. From 1955 to 1985 the lettering for the plaques was designed in the Roman lettering style by Henry Hooper. Since 2015, the plaques have been made by Ned Heywood, a potter, at his workshop in Chepstow, Wales. Each plaque is made entirely by hand.

=== Event plaques ===

A small minority of GLC and English Heritage plaques have been erected to commemorate events which took place at particular locations rather than the famous people who lived there.

=== Outside London ===
In 1998, English Heritage initiated a trial national plaques scheme, and over the following years erected 34 plaques in Birmingham, Merseyside, Southampton and Portsmouth. The scheme was discontinued in 2005, although English Heritage continued to provide advice and guidance to individuals and organisations outside of London wanting to develop local schemes.

In September 2023 the Department for Culture, Media and Sport announced the reintroduction of a national scheme, with Historic England as the lead developer. From mid 2024, the public will be invited to submit nominations, with eligibility criteria including a minimum of 20 years having passed since the death of the nominee, who must have made a significant contribution to human welfare or happiness. At least one surviving building must be associated with the nominee in a form that they would have recognised and the building must be visible from the public highway. The first plaque in the scheme was unveiled in Ilkley, West Yorkshire on 23 February 2024, commemorating Daphne Steele, first Black matron in the National Health Service in 1964. On 24 May 2024, a blue plaque commemorating the childhood home of musician George Harrison in Liverpool was unveiled, and was referred to in the press as &quot;Historic England&#x27;s first official non-London blue plaque&quot;.

The popularity of English Heritage&#x27;s London blue plaques scheme has meant that a number of comparable schemes have been established elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Many of these schemes also use blue plaques, often manufactured in metal or plastic rather than the ceramic used in London, but some feature plaques of different colours and shapes. In 2012, English Heritage published a register of plaque schemes run by other organisations across England.

The criteria for selection varies greatly. Many schemes treat plaques primarily as memorials and place them on the sites of former buildings, in contrast to the strict English Heritage policy of only installing a plaque on the actual building in which a famous person lived or an event took place.

=== London ===
The Corporation of London continues to run its own plaque scheme for the City of London, where English Heritage does not erect plaques. City of London plaques are blue and ceramic, but are rectangular in shape and carry the City of London coat of arms. Because of the rapidity of change in the built environment within the City, a high proportion of Corporation of London plaques mark the sites of former buildings.

Many of the 32 London boroughs also now have their own schemes, running alongside the English Heritage scheme. Westminster City Council runs a green plaque scheme, each plaque being sponsored by a group with a particular interest in its subject. The London Borough of Southwark started its own blue plaque scheme in 2003, under which the borough awards plaques through popular vote following public nomination: living people may be commemorated. The London Borough of Islington has a similar green heritage plaque scheme, initiated in 2010.

Other plaques may be erected by smaller groups, such as residents&#x27; associations. In 2007 the Hampstead Garden Suburb Residents Association erected a blue plaque in memory of Prime Minister Harold Wilson at 12 Southway as part of the suburb&#x27;s centenary celebrations.

=== Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland===
In Northern Ireland, Belfast City Council and the Ulster History Circle are among a small number of groups administering blue plaques. Established in 1983, the Ulster History Circle has erected around 260. Its scope extends into the Republic of Ireland, covering all nine counties of Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. Elsewhere in the Republic, schemes are operated through local authorities and civic societies.

=== Scotland ===
Historic Environment Scotland, the Scottish heritage agency, has previously operated a national commemorative plaques scheme but, as of 2023, this was inactive. Regional schemes are run by local authorities.

=== Wales ===
Wales does not operate a national blue plaque scheme, although in 2022 Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservative Group in the Senedd, called for the introduction of a country-wide approach. Regional schemes are operated by local authorities such as Swansea and civic societies. The Purple Plaques scheme is a national scheme (across Wales) that aims to commemorate women whose lives have had a significant and long-lasting impact.
===Individual examples===
=== Thematic schemes ===
There also exist several nationwide schemes sponsored by special-interest bodies, which erect plaques at sites or buildings with historical associations within their particular sphere of activity.
* The Transport Trust&#x27;s Red Wheel scheme erects red plaques on sites of significance in the evolution of transport.
* The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America erects blue plaques on sites associated with notable music hall and variety artistes, mainly in the London area.
* The British Comedy Society (previously known as the Dead Comics&#x27; Society) erects blue plaques on the former homes of well-known comedians, including those of Sid James and John Le Mesurier.
* The Royal Society of Chemistry&#x27;s Chemical Landmark Scheme erects hexagonal blue plaques to mark sites where the chemical sciences are considered to have made a significant contribution to health, wealth, or quality of life.
* The Institute of Physics installs circular blue plaques to celebrate physicists&#x27; lives or work at various locations in the Great Britain and Ireland. Plaques exist in Edinburgh for Thomas Henderson and Thomas David Anderson, at Glasgow for Alexander Wilson and William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, at Eskdalemuir Observatory for Lewis Fry Richardson, at the birthplace of Charles Thomson Rees Wilson in the Pentland Hills, at Leeds for William Henry Bragg and at Aberdeen for George Paget Thomson. In 2015, Peter Higgs unveiled his own plaque, installed on the building in which he had predicted the Higgs boson.
*Rainbow plaques commemorate LGBT people, events or sites. They have been erected by different bodies, but are distinguished by having rainbow colours around the circumference.

<doc id="310651" wikidata="Q259157" url="?curid=310651" title="Chehalis River (Washington)">
<text>The Chehalis River ( )
is a river in Washington in the United States. It originates in several forks in southwestern Washington, flows east, then north, then west, in a large curve, before emptying into Grays Harbor, an estuary of the Pacific Ocean. The river is the largest solely contained drainage basin in the state.

==History==

===Last Glacial Period===
The river was once much larger during the Ice Age when the tongue of the glacial ice sheet covering the Puget Sound terminated near Olympia and glacial runoff formed a large torrent of meltwater. This carved a large oversized valley that is much larger than the current river could have produced. The river&#x27;s mouth was out near current Westport until rising sea levels at the end of the ice age flooded the broad Chehalis Valley to form a ria, known today as Grays Harbor.

The glacial sheet tongue is known as the Puget Lobe which, when it began to melt, formed Glacial Lake Russell. The lake drained through the Chehalis River Valley and the slow deposits of glacial sediment raised the depressed valley.

===Native American history===
The Quinault Indian Nation and the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation are stakeholders of the river. Though the people ceded the lands surrounding the Chehalis River upon the signing of the 1856 Treaty of Olympia, the tribes have retained fishing and hatchery rights.

===Washington state history===
Plans were raised during the presidency of Franklin Pierce to use the river as part of a canal stretching from Olympia to Grays Harbor. The idea was reintroduced multiple times during the 19th century but no official acts, nor construction of the waterway, materialized. Versions of the canal project persisted after the build of the Panama Canal and during the Great Depression, with scaled-down plans lasting into the 1970s.

===Flooding===

====December 3, 2007, floods====
During the Great Coastal Gale of 2007, a stretch of Interstate 5 was closed between exits 68 and 88 because of flooding from the Chehalis River, causing the roadway to be under about of water. The recommended detour added about four hours and 280 miles (450 km). It was not expected to reopen for several days.
However, upon breaching a dike on Dec. 5, 2007, the water receded more quickly than anticipated. Amtrak train service between Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, British Columbia, was also disrupted. Washington governor Christine Gregoire declared a state of emergency on December 3.

====January 7, 2009, floods====
During the January 7, 2009, Pacific Northwest storms, a stretch of Interstate 5 was closed in and around the cities of Centralia and Chehalis because of flooding from the Chehalis River, causing the roadway to be under several feet of water. Since the main east–west mountain passes were also closed during this event, the flooding from the Chehalis River essentially cut off interstate traffic to the Puget Sound area from the south, and no detour was available.

===Water rights===
The Chehalis River, along with the Dungeness River, is part of only two river basins in Washington state that are granted protections and rights under &quot;in-stream flow regulation&quot;. Passed in 1976, the law allows the river the right to maintain its own water levels. Unfettered access to the river is granted to grandfathered &quot;senior&quot; rights holders as they existed before the 1976 rule went into effect; the senior holders mostly consist of tribal communities and farmers. , there are 93 recorded junior water rights holders, mostly homeowners, in the Chehalis basin.

==Course==

The Chehalis River is the largest drainage basin completely within the state. The basin covers approximately in Grays Harbor, Lewis, Mason, and Thurston counties. The waterway is an economic necessity, and a source for food, water, and recreation for several large cities, such as Aberdeen, Centralia, Chehalis, and Hoquiam. The river continues to be a cultural and economic staple for the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation and the Quinault Indian Nation. It begins at the confluence of the West Fork Chehalis River and East Fork Chehalis River, in southwestern Lewis County. From there the Chehalis flows north and east, collecting tributary streams that drain the Willapa Hills and other low mountains of southwestern Washington. The South Fork Chehalis River joins the main river a few miles west of the city of Chehalis. The Newaukum River joins the Chehalis River at Chehalis, after which the river turns north, flowing by the city of Centralia, where the Skookumchuck River joins. After Centralia, the Chehalis River flows north and west, collecting tributaries such as the Black River, which drains the Black Hills to the north, then in the Chehalis Gap collects the Satsop River and Wynoochee River, which drain the southern part of the Olympic Mountains.

The Wynoochee River joins the Chehalis near Montesano, after which the Chehalis River becomes increasingly affected by tides and widens into Grays Harbor estuary. The city of Aberdeen lies at the mouth of the Chehalis River. Just east of Aberdeen, the Wishkah River joins the Chehalis, and just west, between Aberdeen and Hoquiam, the Hoquiam River joins. At this point the river has become Grays Harbor. Before the estuary of Grays Harbor empties into the Pacific Ocean, the Humptulips River joins.

==Flood control==

Flood control and concerns for the Chehalis River and its watershed is managed by the Chehalis River Basin Flood Authority, which is overseen and funded by the Washington Department of Ecology Office of Chehalis Basin (OCB).

In 2010, the flood authority implemented the installation of an online flood warning system available to residents in the Chehalis basin. Known as the Chehalis Basin Flood Warning System, it expanded a sensor network already in place, providing information on rainfall and temperature, as well as additional gauges. Alert warnings are sent via email and provide information on 13 rivers in the area. The system won the 2023 National Hydrologic Warning Council (NHWC) Operational Excellence Award

===Chehalis Basin Strategy===
Counties within the Chehalis River basin, various other regional governments, and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), in association with Native American tribes, environmental groups, scientists, and local citizens, organized a partnership in 2014 named the Chehalis Basin Strategy to propose and research a combination of plans along the Chehalis River to mitigate flooding and to restore aquatic habitat, particularly for local Chinook salmon. The initial proposal outlined several flood control reduction measures, with downstream levee improvements particularly at the Chehalis–Centralia Airport, and a flood retention dam in Pe Ell which is planned to limit catastrophic damage from 100-year floods within the Chehalis River Basin.

==Wildlife==
The river is home to several salmon species, including chum, coho and Fall Chinook, and the basin is also a habitat for Steelhead trout. In 2018, the Chehalis was the only river basin in the state in which any classification of salmon was not listed as an endangered species, despite decreasing numbers of the fish. A petition was filed by conservation groups in 2023 to list the Chinook salmon as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.

<doc id="310656" wikidata="Q2265376" url="?curid=310656" title="Akuma (Street Fighter)">
<text>, known in Japan as , is a fictional character from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series of fighting games created by Capcom. Akuma made his debut in &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; as a secret character and an alternative boss to the villain M. Bison. In the storyline, he is the younger brother of Gouken, Ryu&#x27;s and Ken&#x27;s master. After defeating his brother, Akuma gains interest in several fighters, most notably Ryu as he senses that the protagonist has a similar power to him known as the Satsui no Hadou. In some games, he also has an alternate version named Shin Akuma or in Japanese and Oni Akuma in &quot;Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition&quot;. 

Born out of a request between developers from the franchise, Akuma was developed to contrast both M. Bison and Ryu. He often appeared as a guest character in other franchises, most notably as a guest in the Namco Bandai Games&#x27; &quot;Tekken 7&quot;. Akuma has also appeared in printed and animated adaptations of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series which explore his relationship with Ryu. Since his debut, Akuma has appeared in several subsequent titles and has been praised by both fans and critics. The character has often been praised for his dark personality contrasting the recurring M. Bison as well as how overpowered he is.

==Creation==
Akuma was created by request of Noritaka Funamizu to Akira Yasuda when creating a new &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character. Akuma was designed in order to please fans who were victims of April&#x27;s Fools in the claims from journalists that there was a hidden character named Sheng Long. Funamizu wanted the character, Akuma, to be based on Ryu&#x27;s design. While still being an evil character, Yasuda still wanted to create a major contrast between the regular boss, M. Bison, and Akuma. Akuma first appears in &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; defeating the final boss with his technique which acts in fast fashion. The same move has been shown in other games like in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; where Akuma is seen defeating Gouken in the intro whereas Ryu&#x27;s evil alter egos have performed it influeced by the Satsui no Hadou that Akuma controls and masters like Oni.

Akuma has dark red hair, dark skin tone, glowing red eyes with black sclera, wears prayer beads around his neck, a dark gray karate gi and a piece of twine around his waist in lieu of an obi. The kanji &quot;ten&quot; (天) — meaning &quot;Heaven&quot; — can be seen on his back when it appears during certain win animations. Shin Akuma&#x27;s appearance is very similar to Akuma&#x27;s; for example, in the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; series, Shin Akuma had a purple karate gi instead of a dark gray one and marginally darker skin tone. Akuma&#x27;s introduction in &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; stemmed from the development team&#x27;s desire to introduce a &quot;mysterious and really powerful&quot; character, with his status as a hidden character within the game resulting from later discussions. When asked regarding the presence of Akuma as a secret character in several of Capcom&#x27;s fighting games, Capcom&#x27;s Noritaka Funamizu stated that, while he did not personally support the concept, he said, &quot;Akuma is a character that can fit in any game design nicely&quot;.

Akuma&#x27;s appearance remained consistent until &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; where his hair reaches far longer and has grown around his face, like a lion&#x27;s mane. Takayuki Nakayama explained that the staff considered multiple designs that were scrapped such as a shirtless look, multiple scars within the body, one with a broken shirt and one where he carried a baby.

Akuma appears as a character in Namco&#x27;s &quot;Tekken 7&quot;. He was specifically chosen by staff member Katsuhiro Harada who believed he would easily fit into the &quot;Tekken&quot; world. In regards to his transition from &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character to &quot;Tekken&quot;, Namco worked properly to balance him with the rest. There was no model from Capcom so Akuma&#x27;s entire character in &quot;Tekken 7&quot; was completely created by Namco. However, they were careful with not making him authentic to his original persona. Kazuya Mishima fights Akuma during the end of story mode; explained that the outcome of the fight was intentionally ambiguous, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s still a work in progress.&quot; He joked that a scene with Akuma being killed could negatively affect Namco&#x27;s relationship with Capcom, particularly Capcom COO Kenzo Tsujimoto who would get back at Harada and Street Fighter producer Yoshinori Ono, after the latter had struck a close friendship with Harada leading to the collaboration of the two franchises.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Street Fighter&quot; game series===
Akuma made his debut in &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot;, the fifth arcade iteration of the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; games, where he appears as a hidden and unnamed character. After meeting certain requirements, Akuma appears prior to the player&#x27;s final match with M. Bison and obliterates M. Bison before challenging the player. In the Japanese arcade version of the game, Akuma would introduce himself to the player before the match, proclaiming himself to be the . He also has two endings in the game as well: one for defeating M. Bison and another against himself. While the dialogue in these endings was omitted from the international releases of the arcade game, they were edited into one ending and included in the English localization of &quot;Super Turbo Revival&quot; for the Game Boy Advance. Shin Akuma is, however, an unlockable playable character in the Game Boy Advance version of the game, &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival&quot;, as well as the Japan-only Dreamcast version of the game, &quot;Super Street Fighter II X for Matching Service&quot;. In the latter version, another version of Akuma referred to as &quot;Tien Gouki&quot; can also be selected.

Akuma appears in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors&#x27; Dreams&quot;, where he was given his name, once again as a hidden opponent and unlockable character. His backstory remains the same as in &quot;Super Turbo&quot;. Akuma was added to the immediate roster in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot;, with a powered-up version of the character named &quot;Shin Akuma&quot; appearing as a hidden opponent. The character&#x27;s relation with other &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters begins to be fleshed out, establishing rivalries with Guy, Adon, Gen and Ryu. Shin Akuma, rather than &quot;Final Bison&quot;, is Evil Ryu&#x27;s final boss in the console versions of &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot;.

Akuma and Shin Akuma are featured in &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot; as hidden boss characters, where he is one of the few characters able to move out of the 2D playing field, during his teleport. Akuma also appears in the arcade and home video game console adaption of &quot;Street Fighter: The Movie&quot; despite not appearing in the movie. In the game it is said that he is the brother of Sheng Long and not Gouken.

Akuma is featured in the &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; series beginning with &quot;Street Fighter III 2nd Impact: Giant Attack&quot;. Like in his debut in &quot;Super Turbo&quot;, Akuma is both a secret opponent who serves as an alternate final boss and an unlockable character, with the CPU-controlled version being the &quot;Shin Akuma&quot; incarnation introduced in &quot;Alpha 2&quot;. He is a regular character in &quot;Street Fighter III 3rd Strike&quot;. Akuma reappears in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, being one of the main antagonists and once again a secret boss in the Arcade Mode as well as an unlockable character in both
console versions. A new form of Akuma, known as , was confirmed in &quot; Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition&quot; by leaked videos. Akuma returns in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; as a downloadable character, and again appears as a downloadable character in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;.

===Other video games===
Akuma has appeared in some form or another through many Capcom games outside the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchise. The first of these appearances was in the fighting game &quot;X-Men: Children of the Atom&quot;, where Akuma (in his &quot;Super Turbo&quot; incarnation) appears as a nameless hidden character. He would appear in the later Marvel-licensed fighting games (see &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series). In &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;, he is a regular character but–in a nod to his hidden character status in other games–his select box is hidden. In &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot;, he appears both as a selectable character and as &quot;Cyber Akuma&quot; (&quot;Mech Gouki&quot; in Japan), a mechanized version enhanced by Apocalypse acting as the horseman of Death and the final boss. He is absent from &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot;; in his stead, Ryu has a Hyper Combo that changes his fighting style to incorporate Akuma&#x27;s moveset. He reappears as a playable character in the sequels: &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes&quot;, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot;.

In the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; series, Akuma appears in &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium&quot; as an unlockable character and in &quot;Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000&quot; as a Ratio 4 character. He also appears in &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2&quot; and &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot; as both regular Akuma and Shin Akuma. In &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2&quot;, a different form of Shin Akuma appears. This form of Akuma achieves a new level of power when a dying Rugal Bernstein pours his Orochi power into him. His name is spelled in Japanese as , with the &quot;Shin&quot; character meaning &quot;God&quot; instead of the usual &quot;True&quot;. Also, various version of Akuma have appeared in the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash&quot; series.

Akuma appears as a special guest character in &quot;Tekken 7&quot;. In the game&#x27;s story, he seeks to repay a debt to Kazumi Mishima for saving his life from an unknown critical situation, who asks him to kill her husband Heihachi and his son Kazuya for her if she dies. When Heihachi is finally dead for good at the hands of Kazuya, he is Akuma&#x27;s only target left. Similar to his appearances in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series, Akuma replaces Kazumi as a secret arcade mode final boss if certain conditions are met. 

He also appears in &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot;. He appears as both a playable character and one of the final boss characters in the crossover fighting game &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;. Akuma also appears in the fighting video game &quot;Street Fighter X Mega Man&quot;, as a hidden boss. Akuma also appears in &quot;Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo&quot; as the final boss, &quot;Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix&quot; (known as &quot;Pocket Fighter&quot; in Japan) as an unlockable character, and in the Japanese console version of &quot;&quot; as a mecha named &quot;Zero Gouki&quot;. He is featured in a DLC episode of the action video game &quot;Asura&#x27;s Wrath&quot;, alongside Ryu as an opponent. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, Akuma appears as a &quot;spirit&quot;; a type of collectible item that can be used to enhance the abilities of playable characters. Akuma also appears in Capcom&#x27;s collaboration in &quot;Monster Hunter Rise&quot;. Akuma also appears as a &quot;crossover&quot; character in &quot;Brawlhalla&quot; with mirrored abilities of Val.

==Other media==
Akuma made cameo appearances in &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot; and in the Japanese TV series &quot;Street Fighter II V&quot;. Actor and martial artist Joey Ansah played Akuma in the short film &quot;Street Fighter: Legacy&quot;. Akuma also appears in &quot;Street Fighter: Assassin&#x27;s Fist&quot;, an online series by Capcom and the creators of &quot;Street Fighter: Legacy&quot; with Ansah reprised his role from &quot;Legacy&quot; and Gaku Space as Young Gouki. In &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Fist&quot;, both of Akuma&#x27;s names are used; Akuma being the moniker Gouki had assumed after the Satsui no Hado took him over completely. Both Ansah and Space will return for the second season titled &quot;Street Fighter: World Warrior&quot;.

Akuma&#x27;s first speaking appearance in animation was in an episode of the American &quot;Street Fighter&quot; animated series titled &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot;. He reappears in another episode, &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Warrior&quot;, in which he defeats Ryu and Ken&#x27;s master Gouken and challenges Gouken&#x27;s two students to a duel.

Akuma also figures in the Japanese OVA &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation&quot;, where Ryu&#x27;s encounters with Akuma triggers the &quot;Dark Hadou&quot; in Ryu. Akuma is also the central focus in the OVA &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: Generations&quot;, which explores his past and ties the character&#x27;s past with Ryu&#x27;s. He appears in the beginning of the movie &quot;Street Fighter 4: The Ties That Bind&quot;, where he enters Ryu&#x27;s mind and torments him.

UDON Entertainment&#x27;s line of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; comics sets Akuma in his origin story on how he became a demon and murdering Goutetsu with the power of the Dark Hadou; he fights against Gouken ten years later, as they fight, Gouken eventually wins against Akuma as he falls off a cliff; Gouken tries to save him, but Akuma willingly drops himself into a river, only for him to survive the drop.

In 2012, band MegaDriver released a song about Akuma&#x27;s character, called &quot;Wrath of the Raging Demon&quot;. In 2014, band Skelator released a song about Akuma, called &quot;Raging Demon&quot;. In 2015, rapper Tauz released a tribute song to Akuma, called &quot;Rap do Akuma&quot;. In 2021, band RAVENOUS E.H. released a song about Akuma, called &quot;Die 1,000 Deaths&quot;.

Akuma forms a substantial part of the Rensuke Oshikiri manga and Netflix TV series &quot;Hi Score Girl&quot;; Akuma is discovered (as a hidden character) by the female lead Oono (who typically plays Zangief), and Akuma subsequently becomes the fighter and alter-ego of Hidaka, Oono&#x27;s rival. The animated show contains long sequences of actual gameplay (that is, recorded video of actual gameplay) intercut with the animation. The bulk of episode 20 is the long battle between Hidaka playing Akuma and Oono playing Zangief.

==Reception==
Akuma has received much critical acclaim from various gaming media outlets. &quot;Paste&quot; rated Akuma 23rd in their 2016 ranking of &quot;Street Fighter&#x27;s&quot; 97 total playable characters, describing him as &quot;a great anti-hero to offset Ryu and Ken.&quot; Japanese magazine &quot;Gamest&quot; named him one of their &quot;Top 50 Characters of 1996&quot;, in a three-way tie for 37th. Rich Knight of &quot;Complex&quot;, in 2012, placed Akuma&#x27;s &quot;SSFII Turbo&quot; appearance runner-up to Shao Kahn in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; as the &quot;coolest boss battle ever&quot;: &quot;Akuma rushed into our lives and onto the screen ... and then demolish[ed] you in seconds.&quot; He placed first in &quot;Game Informer&#x27;s&quot; 2009 list of their &quot;Top Ten Best Fighting Game Characters&quot;. Ryan Clements of IGN prefer him over the villain M. Bison thanks to his personality. Elton Jones of &quot;Complex&quot; deemed Akuma agreed while calling him the &quot;most dominant fighting game character&quot;. On a different note, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; claimed that Akuma is different from other antagonists seen in gaming as while cannot be called evil, his methods and actions are forbidden. On the other hand, Alex Eckman-Lawn of &quot;Topless Robot&quot; deemed him the &quot;most diabolical&quot; fighting-game boss citing the large impact of his debut where he defeats M. Bison while replacing him as the final boss of his video game. Such impact let to Bryan Dawson of Prima Games calling him &quot;irreplaceable&quot;. The character was also praised for his fighting techniques and has appeared in several polls. Ben Lee of &quot;Digital Spy&quot; named him the sixth-best series character on the grounds that he was &quot;truly exciting to fight against&quot; in &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot;, &quot;and his cold, emotionless personality was utterly terrifying.&quot; Nicholas Wave said that Akuma represents Ryu&#x27;s potential darkness as the protagonist struggles to become more unique with every installment.

Chad Hunter of &quot;Complex&quot; ranked Akuma&#x27;s &quot;Raging Demon&quot; among the &quot;25 Most Revolutionary Kill Moves in Video Games&quot; at third: &quot;Akuma radiates flames, grabs his opponent and the screen goes black and all you [hear] is a flurry of hits.&quot; Prima Games named it the seventh-&quot;greatest fighting move in video game history&quot; out of fifty in 2014, and &quot;Arcade Sushi&#x27;s&quot; Angelo Dargenio considered it &quot;one of the most well-known super moves in videogame history, spawning several parody moves in multiple fighting games over the years.&quot; Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, in 2016, named Akuma in &quot;X-Men: Children of the Atom&quot; as the top fighting-game guest character. While Jason Fanelli of &quot;Arcade Sushi&quot; considered it &quot;the best guest turn he&#x27;s ever done,&quot; he simultaneously criticized his cameo in &quot;&quot;: &quot;Akuma doesn&#x27;t need to be a giant mech for extra exposure.&quot; Chris Hoadley of VentureBeat labeled Akuma one of the &quot;best fighting game clones&quot; in 2014: &quot;Capcom is no stranger to reusing [character] models. Ryu has had Ken as a rival since the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, and over time he would meet more &#x27;shotos&#x27; who had an affinity for karate &quot;gis&quot;, fireballs, and uppercuts.&quot; &quot;GamesRadar&#x27;s&quot; David Houghton rated Akuma&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike&quot; stage among the &quot;27 most amazing fighting game backgrounds&quot;: &quot;Gloomily ethereal, black-skied woodland setting with subliminally oppressive fisheye-lens effect? You are definitely going to die.&quot; In &quot;Tekken 7&quot;, a bonus fight between Devil Kazuya and Akuma could be unlocked. Calling Devil Kazuya a difficult opponent, &quot;Shacknews&quot; and &quot;Hobby Consolas&quot; said that Akuma offered players a challenge; gamers needed to learn Devil Kazuya&#x27;s moves to defeat him, resulting in the game&#x27;s most difficult fight.

Despite the character&#x27;s popularity, Akuma has often been criticized for his perceived status as an excessively powerful character in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series. &quot;GamePro&quot; considered Akuma one of the &quot;Most Broken Characters in Videogame History&quot;, for his &quot;ridiculously powerful&quot; moves that were &quot;the bane of newbies and veterans alike,&quot; a sentiment that was echoed by Christopher Hooton of &quot;Metro&quot;. Lucas Sullivan of &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked Akuma eleventh in his list of &quot;12 unfair fighting game bosses that (almost) made us rage quit&quot; in 2014. &quot;Even if you ever do manage to finally defeat Akuma, it somehow doesn&#x27;t feel earned. It&#x27;s more like the computer felt sorry for you.&quot; Akuma&#x27;s Oni incarnation has received a mixed reception. Imran Khan of &quot;Paste&quot; rated Oni as one of the &quot;all-time worst&quot; series characters, lamenting the redesign that made Akuma interesting and instead making him look like a rejected &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; character. Randolph Ramsay of &quot;GameSpot&quot; considered Oni &quot;one of the least interesting additions&quot; to &quot;Super Street Fighter IV&quot;, as he utilized moves similar to those of other characters. Den of Geek had mixed feelings about Oni, having considered Akuma to sport a better design despite enjoying the concept of Oni being the original character having obtained more power at the cost of his own humanity.he website also praised such form for giving the origins of Ryu a major twist and having a major part in the narrative as Akuma is interested in the protagonist reaching this form.

Akuma artwork was featured on an officially licensed NubyTech/UDON joypad for the PlayStation 2, announced on September 27, 2004. It was also featured on a separate NubyTech/UDON joypad for the Xbox, announced on May 25, 2005.

<doc id="310660" wikidata="Q1131423" url="?curid=310660" title="Logan's Run">
<text>Logan&#x27;s Run is a science fiction novel by American writers William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson. Published in 1967, the novel depicts a dystopic Malthusian future society in which both population and the consumption of resources are maintained in equilibrium by requiring the death of everyone reaching the age of 21. The story follows the actions of Logan, a &quot;Sandman&quot; charged with enforcing the rule, as he tracks down and kills citizens who &quot;run&quot; from society&#x27;s lethal demand—only to end up &quot;running&quot; himself.

==Plot==
The introduction to the book says:

In the world of 2116, a person&#x27;s maximum age is strictly legislated: 21 years, to the day. When people reach this &quot;Lastday&quot; they report to a &quot;[CTF] Sleepshop&quot; in which they are willingly executed via a pleasure-inducing toxic gas. A person&#x27;s age is revealed by their &quot;palm flower&quot; crystal embedded in the palm of their right hand that changes color every seven years; yellow (age 0–6), then blue (age 7–13), then red (age 14–20), then blinks red and black on Lastday, and finally turns black at 21.

&quot;Runners&quot; are those who refuse to report to a Sleepshop and attempt to avoid their fate by escaping to Sanctuary—a place where they can live freely in defiance of society&#x27;s dictates. Logan 3 is a &quot;Deep Sleep Operative&quot; (also called a &quot;Sandman&quot;) whose job is to terminate Runners using a special weapon called simply &quot;the gun&quot;, a handgun with selectable ordnance keyed to self-destruct if touched by an individual who is not the proper owner. Runners are most terrified of a weapon called the &quot;Homer&quot;, which homes in on body heat and ignites every pain nerve in the body, killing the target.

Sandmen practice Omnite, a hybrid type of martial arts. On his own Lastday, Logan becomes a Runner himself in an attempt to infiltrate an apparent underground railroad for runners seeking Sanctuary.

For most of the book, Logan is an antihero; however, his character develops a sympathy towards Runners, and he becomes more of a traditional hero figure.

Despite her initial distrust of him, he is aided by Jessica 6, a contact that Logan made after he chased her Runner brother, Doyle 10, into Cathedral, where he was killed by the vicious pre-teens known as &quot;Cubs&quot;.

Francis, another Sandman and a friend of Logan, catches up with Logan and Jessica after they have managed to make it to the final staging area before Sanctuary. Francis reveals that his true identity is that of the legendary Ballard, who has been helping arrange their escape. Francis tells them he is actually aged 42, but due to his faulty palm flower, which does not change color, and through use of plastic-surgery shops, he has been able to disguise his true age and appearance. He is working from within the system, as he believes the computer controlling the global infrastructure, buried beneath Crazy Horse Mountain, is beginning to malfunction, and that society will die with it.

Sanctuary turns out to be Argos, a previously abandoned space colony near Mars.

Logan and Jessica escape to the colony on a rocket, which departs from a former space program launch site in Florida, while Ballard remains to help others escape.

==Sequels and spin-offs==
Nolan wrote two sequels, &quot;Logan&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Logan&#x27;s Search&quot;, published after the film&#x27;s release (respectively in 1977 and 1980). There is also a novelette, &quot;Logan&#x27;s Return&quot;, that was published as an e-book in 2001. Two other novels, &quot;Logan&#x27;s Journey&quot; and &quot;Logan Falls&quot;, have been co-written (respectively with Paul McComas and with Jason V Brock), but not yet published and were intended to be released simultaneously with a remake of the film adaptation.

&quot;Logan&#x27;s World&quot; deals with events following Logan&#x27;s return to Earth, amidst the survivors and ruins of the system he escaped in the first novel, while &quot;Logan&#x27;s Search&quot; deals with Logan going to an alternate reality (with the assistance of aliens) to once again stop the government system he escaped in the first novel, albeit with some minor changes.

George Clayton Johnson&#x27;s long-rumored personal sequel to &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, titled &quot;Jessica&#x27;s Run: A New Sequel for the Logan&#x27;s Run Universe&quot;, was said to be &quot;in development&quot;. It was still in development at the time of George Clayton Johnson&#x27;s death on Christmas Day 2015.

==Reception==
David Pringle gave &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; two stars out of four and praised the novel as &quot;a good SF thriller&quot;; he also stated it was superior to the film version.

==Adaptations==
===Film===

The novel was adapted in 1976 as a film, directed by Michael Anderson and starring Michael York as Logan 5 (not 3), Jenny Agutter as Jessica 6, and Richard Jordan as Francis 7. The film was produced by Saul David, a former MGM executive and well-known science fiction supporter (having produced and developed &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; in 1966 at Fox, and developed &quot;Westworld&quot; at MGM). The film uses a very limited set of premises and plot lines from the novel (everyone must die at a specific age, Logan runs with Jessica as his companion while being chased by Francis).

The film&#x27;s world is a post-apocalyptic, dystopian one, in which people now live inside a huge domed city and are oblivious of the world outside, believing it to be a barren, poisonous environment. The motivations of the characters are also quite differentin the film, the age of planned death is 30instead of reporting to a Sleepshop, citizens must take part in a ritual called in which they are incinerated with the chance of being &quot;renewed&quot;. Logan is a 26-year-old Sandman, sent by the computer to find and destroy Sanctuary. The computer alters his palm flower (here called a &quot;life clock&quot;) to show him as approaching Lastday, and he becomes a runner and escapes from the city.

Sanctuary turns out not to exist (it is revealed that Runners have actually been murdered by a malfunctioning food processing robot just outside the city). The only other person that Logan and Jessica encounter outside the city is an old man (Peter Ustinov) who lives with a large number of cats in the United States Senate chamber of the largely intact ruins of Washington, D.C. Logan kills Francis, who is simply a Sandman in the movie and not a rebel leader, and leads the old man back to remain just outside the domed city, returning to try to lead a revolt against the culling. No one believes or listens to him or Jessica, and instead he is captured by Sandmen. In his interrogation by the computer, his information of there being no Sanctuary causes the computer to malfunction and self-destruct. Logan and Jessica then flee.

As the young population leave the confines of the burning and exploding domed city, they meet the old man outsidethe first time they have seen anybody of that age.

====Possible remake====
In the mid-1990s, Warner Bros. began development of a remake of the movie. In April 2000, director Skip Woods entered negotiations with the studio and producer Joel Silver to write and direct the remake. The director planned to make it closer to the novel than the original film, restoring elements including Crazy Horse Mountain and sky gypsies. In March 2004, director Bryan Singer was brought in to develop and direct &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;. Singer had begun working with production designer Guy Dyas from his previous film &quot;X2&quot; (2003). Screenwriters Ethan Gross and Paul Todisco were hired to write the script with the director, with the film being slated for a 2005 release. In October, Singer said he had begun previsualization of &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, which would be completed by the time he finished production of his project at the time, &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006). The following December, screenwriter Dan Harris said that he and the director had turned in a first draft for &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;. The screenwriter said that the remake would contain more action than the original film, describing the premise to be &quot;a remake of the concept of the movie plus the book&quot;.

In February 2005, screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie was hired to rewrite the script, with filming to take place in Australia. One year later, &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; was announced to begin production later that year in Vancouver. The following May, Singer&#x27;s availability to direct &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; was rendered questionable by scheduling conflicts with filming a planned sequel to &quot;Superman Returns&quot;. By May, Singer confirmed that he would not direct &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, seeking a vacation from the demands of his job. Directors Robert Schwentke and James McTeigue were approached for the project, but neither signed on.

In April 2007, producer Joel Silver reiterated his plan to remake the original film. Later in August, Joseph Kosinski signed on to direct the film.

In May and June 2010, Carl Erik Rinsch was hired to direct, and Alex Garland and Michael Dougherty were set to write the script. Rinsch later pulled out of the project due to scheduling conflicts. In August 2011, Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn was attached to direct the remake, which would star Ryan Gosling and Rose Byrne, with a script by Andrew Baldwin. In June 2013, video game developer Ken Levine was attached to write the screenplay. The latest concept for the film was based on a female lead in April 2015. 

By July 2015, Levine had exited the project and was replaced by Simon Kinberg, who in addition to writing a new story and treatment, also planned to produce the film with Greg Berlanti. 
Ryan Condal was reportedly hired to write the screenplay, based on Kinberg&#x27;s treatment in June 2016. In March 2018, Kinberg was confirmed to be directing the film, from a screenplay by Peter Craig.

Silver resigned from his own production company in 2019, amid allegations of financial mismanagement; the blog &quot;Gizmodo&quot; later speculated that his resignation meant that the remake would &quot;most likely never happen&quot;.

===Television===

A television series spin-off from the film, starring Gregory Harrison as Logan 5 and Heather Menzies as Jessica 6, lasted one season of 14 episodes, from September 16, 1977, through January 16, 1978, on U.S. television (CBS-TV). D. C. Fontana served as story editor and employed several other writers from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, as well as the original novel&#x27;s authors. The series pilot was produced by Saul David, who was replaced by CBS with veteran television producers Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts.

===Other adaptations===
* Marvel Comics published a short-lived comic book series, which adapted the movie&#x27;s story and briefly continued beyond it until the book was cancelled at issue #7.
* A &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; play-by-mail game based on the novel started in 1983.
* From June 1990 to March 1992, Adventure Comics published mini-series comics adaptations of &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; and &quot;Logan&#x27;s World&quot;, six issues each, with art by Barry Blair. A promised adaption of &quot;Logan&#x27;s Search&quot; never materialized.
* A hardcover &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run Annual&quot; based on the TV series and featuring strip art by David Lloyd was published in the United Kingdom by publishers Brown Watson in late 1977, dated 1978. In addition, a &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; comic strip also based on the TV series, written by Angus P. Allan and drawn by Arthur Ranson, ran in the TV-based British weekly comic &quot;Look-In&quot; from April–September 1978.
* In 2000, Emperor Norton Records published &quot;Logan&#x27;s Sanctuary&quot;, an album of electronica music conceived as the soundtrack to an imagined &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; sequel, written and performed by Roger Joseph Manning Jr. and Brian Reitzell, and featuring contributions from Jason Falkner.
* &quot;City of Domes&quot;, an alternative reality game (ARG), was created by the web development group at VirtuQuest.com. The game was a recreation of the &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; city, some 30 years after Logan 6&#x27;s adventures.
* Beginning in 2010, Bluewater Productions began publishing various iterations of the original novel and continuations of the characters in comic book format, starting with &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run: Last Day&quot;.

<text>The Virginia rail (Rallus limicola) is a small waterbird, of the family Rallidae.
These birds remain fairly common despite continuing loss of habitat, but are secretive by nature and more often heard than seen. They are also considered a game species in some provinces and states, though rarely hunted. The Ecuadorian rail is often considered a subspecies, but some taxonomic authorities consider it distinct.

==Description==

Adults are mainly brown, darker on the back and crown, with orange-brown legs. To walk through dense vegetation, they have evolved a laterally compressed body and strong forehead feathers adapted to withstand wear from pushing through vegetation. Virginia rails have the highest ratio of leg-muscle to flight-muscle of all birds (25% - 15% of body weight respectively). They have long toes used to walk on floating vegetation. Their tail is short and they have a long slim reddish bill. Their cheeks are grey, with a light stripe over the eye and a whitish throat. Chicks are black. Juveniles are blackish brown on upperparts with rufous on the edge of feathers and brownish bill and legs. Their underparts are dark brown to black, while the face is grayish brown. Both sexes are very similar, with females being slightly smaller. Adults measure 20–27 cm, with a wingspan of 32–38 cm, and usually weigh 65–95 g.

==Taxonomy==
The Virginia rail is in the genus &quot;Rallus&quot;, a genus of other long-billed rails. It is thought to be closely related to &quot;R. semiplumbeus&quot; and &quot;R. antarcticus&quot;.
There are currently two recognized subspecies of Rallus limicola:
*&quot;R. l. limicola&quot; Vieillot, 1819
* &quot;R. l. friedmanni&quot; Dickerman, 1966

==Habitat and distribution==
The Virginia rail lives in freshwater and brackish marshes, sometimes salt marshes in winter. Northern populations migrate to the southern United States and Central America. On the Pacific coast, some are permanent residents. Its breeding habitat is marshes from Nova Scotia to Southern British Columbia, California and North Carolina, and in Central America. It often coexists with soras, another species of wetland rail.

==Behavior==
The Virginia rail often runs to escape predators, instead of flying. When it does fly, it is usually short distances or for migration. It can also swim and dive using its wings to propel itself.

===Vocalizations===
This bird has a number of calls, including a harsh &quot;kuk kuk kuk&quot;, usually heard at night. It also makes grunting noises. In spring, it will make &quot;tick-it&quot; or &quot;kid-ick&quot; calls.

===Diet===
The Virginia rail probes with its bill in mud or shallow water, also picking up food by sight. It mainly eat insects and other aquatic invertebrates, like beetles, flies, dragonflies, crayfish, snails and earthworms. It can also eat aquatic animals like frogs, fish and some small snakes, as well as seeds. Animal preys constitute the biggest part of this bird&#x27;s diet, but vegetation contributes to its diet in the fall and winter.

===Reproduction===
Courtship starts around May. The male will raise his wings and run back and forth next to the female. Both sexes bow, and the male feeds the female. Before copulation, the male approaches the female while grunting. Virginia rails are monogamous. Both parents build the nest and care for the young, whereas only the male defends the territory. The nest is built as the first egg is laid and consists of a basket of woven vegetation. The nest is made using plants like cattails, reeds and grasses. They also build dummy nests around the marsh. They nest near the base of emergent vegetation in areas with vegetation creating a canopy above the nest.

This birds lays a clutch of 4 to 13 white or buff eggs with sparse gray or brown spotting. The eggs generally measure . They are incubated by both parents for a period of 20 to 22 days, in which the parents continue to add nesting material to conceal the nest. When the eggs hatch, the parents feed the young for two to three weeks, when the chicks become independent. The young can fly in less than a month. The pair bond between the parents breaks after the young become independent.

<text>In engineering and computing, &quot;stovepipe system&quot; is a pejorative term for a system that has the potential to share data or functionality with other systems but which does not do so. The term evokes the image of stovepipes rising above buildings, each functioning individually. A simple example of a stovepipe system is one that implements its own user IDs and passwords, instead of relying on a common user ID and password shared with other systems.

A stovepipe system is generally considered an example of an anti-pattern, particularly found in legacy systems. This is due to the lack of code reuse, and resulting software brittleness due to potentially general functions only being used on limited input.

However, in certain cases stovepipe systems are considered appropriate, due to benefits from vertical integration and avoiding dependency hell. For example, the Microsoft Excel team has avoided dependencies and even maintained its own C compiler, which helped it to ship on time, have high-quality code, and generate small, cross-platform code.

<text>The Battle of the Yalu River (Amnok River) lasted from April 30 to May 1, 1904 and was the first major land battle during the Russo-Japanese War. It was fought near Wiju (modern village of Sinuiju, North Korea) on the lower reaches of the Yalu River, on the border between Korea and China. Also known as the Yalu River Crossing Operation.

==The Russian situation==

The Imperial Russian Army commander in the Far East, General Alexei Kuropatkin followed a strategy of stalling while waiting for enough reinforcements to come up to the front via the incomplete single-track Trans-Siberian Railway to take the offensive. He estimated that it would take at least 6 months to build his forces up to suitable levels. The Viceroy of the Russian Far East, Yevgeni Alekseyev, had given General Kuropatkin strict orders not to hinder the Japanese northward progress through Korea, but hold the line of the Yalu River to prevent the Japanese from crossing into Manchuria.

On April 22, 1904 Kuropatkin dispatched the &quot;Eastern Detachment&quot; under the command of Lieutenant-General Mikhail Zasulich with 16,000 infantry, 5,000 cavalry and some 62 artillery pieces to fight a static delaying action on the north bank of the river. However, Zasulich&#x27;s force was spread out piecemeal over a 170-mile front, whereas the Imperial Japanese Army could concentrate its efforts on any single point of its choosing. General Zasulich did not hold the Japanese in very high regard. Most of the Russian forces were deployed near Wiju, blocking the main road from Korea to Manchuria. Small detachments guarded the bank up and down the river.

==The Japanese situation==

After the success of the Imperial Japanese Navy at the Battle of Chemulp&#x27;o Bay on 9 February 1904, the way was clear for the Imperial Japanese Army to deploy the 2nd, the 12th, and the Guards Divisions of the Japanese 1st Army, commanded by Major-General Baron Tamemoto Kuroki, into Korea. The total strength of Japanese force was about 42,500 men. The Japanese 1st Army advanced quickly northwards from Chemulp&#x27;o (modern Incheon), with advance units entering Pyongyang on 21 February 1904 and Anju by 18 March 1904. Learning their lessons in logistics and transport from the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese army hired some 10,000 local laborers at wages well above the local norms, and paid also for any food and supplies procured locally. This contrasted greatly with the behavior of the Russian troops previously in northern Korea.

By seizing the port of Chinampo (modern Nampo, North Korea) at the mouth of the Taedong River outside of Pyongyang with the spring thaw, the Japanese were able to land the remaining components of the 1st Army by 29 March.
By 21 April 1904 the Japanese 1st Army was concentrated and hidden south of Wiju. The Japanese were in the same positions on the southern bank of the Yalu River that they had been in August 1894. The Japanese knew the exact locations of the Russians&#x27; deployment from intelligence by forward scouts disguised as Korean fishermen, the Russians made no effort to conceal their positions. By 23 April, the Japanese knew the layout of the Russian trench line and details of the defensive positions around the area of Antung. Intelligence was so effective that the Japanese estimate of the Russian troop strength was only exceeded by 1,000 and their estimate of the guns was only two less than the actual number. The Japanese made every effort to keep their positions hidden. Screens of trees, millet and bushes were used to conceal activity as well as roads, artillery and other equipment.

==Prelude==

The prelude to major action took place at 21:45 (9:45 pm) on the night of 25 April 1904, when two battalions of the Japanese 2nd Division seized Kintei, Kyuri, and Oseki Island in the Yalu River without opposition. After reinforcement at 0400 on 26 April by units from the Guards Division and a brief firefight, the forward Russian observation post withdrew to the main Russian lines on the north shore.

Japanese engineers determined that ten bridges 1,630 yards (1490.5m) would be required to span the river. A third of these were steel prefabricated pontoons which weighed 100 pounds each. The remainder were made from local resources. In full view of Russian positions, the Japanese began constructing a causeway across the Yalu River to Kintei Island with the intention of distracting and exposing enemy artillery fire. The ruse worked as the bridge was immediately targeted by two Russian batteries. With the Russians so engaged, the Japanese prepared ten other bridges that could quickly be moved into position for a rapid assault across the river at other locations. 

While the midstream islands were being secured, General Kuroki ordered a feint on the lower Yalu River when Japanese gunboats engaged Cossack detachments at the river mouth. This convinced General Zasulich that the main Japanese attack would fall on the vicinity of the town of Andong, and he concentrated his forces there.

The Russians observed these movements with trepidation, and General Kashtalinsky informed General Zasulich that the Japanese were about to assault the position in force and his position was in danger of being flanked. Zasulich chose to ignore the reports, thinking that the attack was only a feint, and redeployed a single battalion with four guns. Zasulitch remained convinced that the main Japanese attack would fall at Andong, and kept his main force as well as his reserves at that location.

==The main battle==
The Japanese main attack began in the early morning hours of 27 April 1904. By daybreak, the Guards Division was moving into position in the center. They launched a lightning assault against unprepared Russian troops at strategic Tiger Hill, which overlooked the confluence of the Ai and Yalu rivers. Two days later, Russian troops launched an attack on the Guards Division at Tiger Hill in an attempt to retake the position, but gruesomely failed. Following this, the elements of the Japanese Guards and 2nd Division were able to establish a number of German 4.7 inch howitzers from Krupp on Kintei Island, which they concealed with natural foliage. By April 30, the balance of the 12th Division had crossed the river at a town called Sukujin and was advancing in three columns. Japanese First Army continued its three-pronged advance and was across the Yalu by midnight with very little opposition. Limited visibility masked the Japanese movements from Russian observation. When the fog finally lifted about 0500, the Japanese artillery opened up on the Russian formations.

The 2nd Division took its position on the center, advancing on the newly erected causeways leading from the town of Wiju and thus catching the Russians in a pincer movement at the hamlet of Juliencheng, on the Manchurian-side of the Yalu River opposite Wiju. By 1000, the Russians were in full retreat, with a Japanese attempt to block their escape towards Fenghuangcheng to the north.

At this time, the Japanese once again used their battery on Kintei Island with devastating effect on the exposed Russians. In light of these developments, General Zasulitch was strongly encouraged by his staff to pull back to a more defensible position. However, the general stubbornly refused to concede, even sending a telegram to Tsar Nicholas II in Saint Petersburg informing that victory was soon certain. He chose to ignore General Kuropatkin&#x27;s phased withdrawal orders (as confirmed by Kuropatkin&#x27;s chief of staff, General V.V. Sakarov).

General Kuroki had planned to continue the advance of the 12th Division to envelop the Russian left. However, now that the enemy artillery had been neutralized, he decided to engage the Guards and the 2nd Division in a simultaneous assault. It was at this point the Japanese encountered the first serious resistance from the Russian lines. The advance of the 2nd Division was disrupted for a time, and had any of the Russian artillery survived, the outcome might have been different. The Russians were driven from their trenches with severe losses, and the survivors fell back to the tops of the hills, the position that Zasulitch&#x27;s advisors had unsuccessfully encouraged him to fall back to earlier. During the retreat, a counterattack was made by elements of the Russian 12th East Siberian Rifle Regiment, which was cut to pieces and opened further the breaks in the Russian lines.

The Russian position now became wholly untenable, and remaining formations now were in danger of being encircled. General Zasulich was ordered to retreat. The 11th East Siberian Rifle Regiment, which was covering a retreat, was cut off by the Japanese and suffered large casualties during its breakthrough back to the other Russian forces. At the appearance of the Japanese 12th Division, the Russian left flank panicked and collapsed.

At 17:30 on 1 May 1904, remnants of the Russian Eastern Detachment either surrendered or escaped towards Fenghuangcheng to the north and the Battle for the Yalu River came to an end.

==Outcome==
The Battle of the Yalu River ended in victory for Japan. The combat had cost the Japanese 1,036 dead and wounded out of the total 1st Army strength of 42,500. The Russian Eastern Detachment suffered some 2,700 casualties overall, including about 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, 600 prisoners and the loss of 21 of 24 field guns.

==Significance==
The Battle of the Yalu River was the first major land campaign of the Russo-Japanese War. With nothing preventing the Japanese from entering the poorly defended expanses of Manchuria, Kuroki and other generals involved in the campaign were ordered to launch a large offensive with a goal of crushing the massing Russian reinforcements at Liaoyang. Furthermore, the defeat of the Russian Eastern Detachment removed the perception that the Japanese would be an easy enemy, that the war would be short, and that Russia would be the overwhelming victor.

<text>Ingvar Even Ambjørnsen-Haefs (born 20 May 1956) is a Norwegian writer. He is best known for his &quot;Elling&quot; tetralogy: &quot;Utsikt til paradiset&quot; (1993), &quot;Fugledansen&quot; (1995), &quot;Brødre i blodet&quot; (1996), and &quot;Elsk meg i morgen&quot; (1999).

&quot;Brødre i blodet&quot; (&quot;Blood brothers&quot;) was turned into a successful movie, entitled &quot;Elling&quot;, which received an Oscar nomination in the Best Foreign Film category in 2001. The English translation of the novel is called &quot;Beyond the Great Indoors&quot;.

Born in Tønsberg and raised in Larvik, his semi-autobiographical debut novel &quot;23-salen&quot; (&quot;The 23rd Row&quot;), criticized mental health care in Norway. All of his novels take the side of the outsider, including his breakthrough novel &quot;Hvite Niggere&quot; (&quot;White Niggers&quot;, 1986). The novel is about a young man who leads a life somewhat on the edges of normal society.

He is also known for his series for young people &quot;Pelle og Proffen&quot; which focuses on two teenage detectives who get involved in many mysteries and crimes involving drugs, pollution and neo-Nazism among other things. He started this project after reading some of Franklin W. Dixon&#x27;s books about The Hardy Boys. The books &quot;Døden på Oslo S&quot;, &quot;Giftige Løgner&quot;, and &quot;De Blå Ulvene&quot; of this series were also turned into successful movies. In 2005 the book &quot;Drapene i Barkvik&quot; (&quot;The murders in Barkvik&quot;) appeared, about the teenager Fillip Moberg attempting to solve an axe murder in a small Norwegian village.

In 2010 Ambjørnsen stopped writing novels; &quot;Farvel til romanen. 24 timer i grenseland&quot;, published in 2014, is about that decision and about how he came to write his novels.

Ambjørnsen has received many prizes for his writing. Among them are the Norwegian Booksellers Association&#x27;s prize for the best book of the 1980s for children and young adults (Pelle and Proffen books), the Tabu prize in 2001, the Telenor Culture Award in 2002, and the Brage Prize in 1995.

His three &quot;Samson and Roberto&quot; books have become particularly popular in Russia, in part due to the illustrations by Nikolay Vorontsov, which also contribute carefully orchestrated local Russian-related colloquialisms to the stories.

Until 2014, Ambjørnsen frequently reviewed books for the Norwegian newspaper &quot;VG&quot;. Since 1985 he has lived in Hamburg with his German wife and translator, Gabriele Haefs. In 2009 he was made an honorary citizen of Larvik.

<doc id="310675" wikidata="Q641486" url="?curid=310675" title="Courage the Cowardly Dog">
<text>Courage the Cowardly Dog is an American animated comedy horror television series created by John R. Dilworth for Cartoon Network. It was produced by Dilworth&#x27;s animation studio, Stretch Films. The eponymous character is an anxious dog who lives with an elderly couple, Muriel and Eustace Bagge, in a farmhouse in the middle of Nowhere, a fictional town in Kansas. In each episode, the Bagges are repeatedly thrown into bizarre, frequently disturbing, and often paranormal or supernatural adventures, with Courage often having to rescue his owners. The series is known for its dark, surreal humor and atmosphere.

Dilworth pitched the series to Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s animated shorts showcase &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; and a pilot titled &quot;The Chicken from Outer Space&quot; aired on Cartoon Network on February 18, 1996. The segment was nominated for an Academy Award but lost to &quot;Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave&quot;. The short was greenlit to become a series, which premiered on November 12, 1999, and ended on November 22, 2002, with four seasons consisting of 13 episodes each. It was nominated for three Golden Reel Awards and won one Annie Award.

== Premise ==

&quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; follows Courage (Marty Grabstein), a kind but easily frightened dog. He was abandoned as a puppy after his parents were sent into outer space by a crazy veterinarian. Soon after, he was found in an alleyway by Muriel Bagge (Thea White), a caring woman who decided to take Courage in as her own; the nature of this first meeting inspired her to give him his name. In the present, Courage lives in an isolated farmhouse in Kansas with Muriel and her husband Eustace Bagge (Lionel Wilson in episodes 1–33, Arthur Anderson in episodes 34–52), a cranky and greedy man who is jealous of Courage, refers to him as &quot;stupid dog&quot;, and periodically uses the &quot;Ooga Booga&quot; mask to frighten him. The nearest town to the farmhouse is called Nowhere.

Courage and his owners frequently encounter monsters, aliens, zombies, and other paranormal or supernatural creatures that are attracted to Nowhere. Plots generally use conventions common to horror films. Although most of the creatures the three face are hostile, others suffer from distress, anger, and/or desperation, and sometimes are friendly. On occasion, some are even false antagonists.

The task of protecting Muriel and Eustace from such dangers falls on Courage, who endeavors to thwart or reconcile with the monster of the week and remedy or repair any damages done. Although Courage is occasionally aided with that task, the full extent of his efforts is usually performed unbeknownst to Muriel and Eustace. Ironically, given his name, Courage may be considered a genuine hero who often goes to great lengths to protect his owners, and a genuine coward who still expresses much of his distress with over-the-top, piercing shrieks.

Although episodic in nature, there are a handful of recurring characters in the show&#x27;s cast, including Courage&#x27;s sarcastic, sentient computer (Simon Prebble); the family physician Dr. Vindaloo (Paul Schoeffler); a fortune-telling chihuahua named Shirley the Medium (Mary Testa); Eustace&#x27;s mother &quot;Ma&quot; (Billie Lou Watt); some of the villains including Katz, Le Quack, Snowman (all three also voiced by Schoeffler), and the antagonistic Di Lung (Tim Chi Ly).

== Production ==
=== Creation ===
Originally, &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; was created as a seven-minute animated short, &quot;The Chicken from Outer Space&quot;. Dilworth started the animated short with Hanna-Barbera, sponsored by Cartoon Network and introduced Courage. Dilworth graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the School of Visual Arts in New York in 1985. He became an art director and founded his own animation studio, Stretch Films in 1991, and incorporated in 1994. The character of Courage grew out of an earlier character of Dilworth&#x27;s called Hamilton, who appeared in &quot;Smart Talk with Raisin&quot;, a pilot Dilworth created for MTV.

The animated short was shown as one of the episodes of Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;World Premiere Toons&quot; in 1996, a Hanna-Barbera Cartoons innovation by then-president Fred Seibert. The short served as a &quot;de facto&quot; pilot for the future series. The original animated short had no dialogue except for one line spoken by Courage, who had a more authoritative voice akin to Jackie Mason than in the series. It was uttered by voice actor Howard Hoffman who also provided all the other vocal sounds and effects for the short. An alien chicken was the villain in this short, who later reappears in the series to seek revenge. His sons also attempt to seek revenge in an even later episode. The short was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 68th Academy Awards, but lost to the &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; short film &quot;A Close Shave&quot;.

=== Sound design ===
When deciding on sound effects, Dilworth tried to avoid pre-made stock sounds. He contributed a substantial amount of new material to sound designer Michael Geisler and only looked for sounds that made him laugh. The composition of the series&#x27; music relied on what was being portrayed: suspense, comedy, or action. The production crew worked together to come up with new music for the series that had not previously been used. There were a few sections on one particular piece that Dilworth exceptionally liked. The production crew was able to isolate these sections and expand them into a usable theme.

Original music featured in &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; was composed by Jody Gray and Andy Ezrin. Classical music can be heard at times, which pays homage to classic Warner Bros. animation and the scores of Carl Stalling. In several episodes, Gray arranged various famous classical pieces, such as Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot;, and wrote up to 15 songs.

=== Broadcast history ===
&quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; originally was premiered as a short on February 18, 1996. The show premiered on November 12, 1999, and became the highest-rated premiere in Cartoon Network history at the time. Previews for &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; were shown in American movie theaters before &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot;. It ended on November 22, 2002, with 52 episodes produced in four seasons.

== Episodes ==

In total, there were 52 episodes in four seasons produced, plus a pilot episode and a special episode. The series ran from November 12, 1999, to November 22, 2002. 

== Reception ==
John G. Nettles of &quot;PopMatters&quot; reviewed the show and called it, &quot;a fascinating and textured mixture of cartoon and horror-movie conventions, and a joy to watch.&quot;

Alex Mastas of &quot;Lights Out Films&quot; reviewed the show, gave it a grade &quot;A−&quot; and described it: &quot;The backgrounds are rich and imaginative—they composite a lot of the show over real photos and occasionally integrate CGI into the cartoon. The look is weird and ethereal, just like the show itself.&quot;

KJ Dell Antonia of Common Sense Media gave the show three stars out of five with the summary, &quot;Cult fave &#x27;toon plays over-the-top violence for laughs.&quot; Antonia warned parents that the series contains graphic animated violence, including &quot;exploding organs, growing extra limbs, turning inside out, you name it&quot;. Randy Miller III of DVD Talk said that shows aimed at younger audiences &quot;usually don&#x27;t go for thrills and chills, so it&#x27;s good to see a genuinely surreal and slanted series develop a decent following.&quot;

Jeff Swindoll of &quot;Monsters and Critics&quot; reviewed the first season DVD and praised all the episodes featured in the first season and encouraged fans to buy the season&#x27;s DVD, but also noted the exclusion of the original Hanna-Barbera short &quot;The Chicken from Outer Space&quot; on the DVD. &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; was ranked number five in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s 2012 list of &quot;10 Best Cartoon Network Shows&quot;. In 2023, Indian entertainment journal &quot;Pinkvilla&quot; ranked the show no. 1 of their list of top 10 1990s cartoons and gave special praise to the episode &quot;Courage in the Big Stinkin&#x27; City&quot;, stating that the show remains enjoyable in present times.

== Possible revivals==
In February 2012, BuzzFeed reported that a CGI special of &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; was in development. The seven-minute special, titled &quot;The Fog of Courage&quot;, aired in 2014. Dilworth uploaded the special on his StretchFilms YouTube channel on March 14, 2024.

In October 2018, Dilworth commented on a Facebook post that he was in negotiations with Boomerang for a prequel to the series under the working title &quot;Before Courage.&quot; However, in May 2020, when asked about the project, Dilworth responded that it had been &quot;transformed into another thing&quot;. In June 2021, Dilworth revealed that the project was on turnaround as Cartoon Network&#x27;s management is prioritizing their focus on other projects. However, in January 2022, Dilworth revealed that the project has already been dropped and fell through for the same reason. On February 1, 2024, Dilworth uploaded the animatic pilot titled &quot;Goblins of Litter&quot; on his StretchFilms YouTube channel and on February 23, 2024, uploaded the same pilot with music and sound effects added.

== Crossover film ==

On June 22, 2021, Warner Bros. Animation announced an animated direct-to-video crossover film with &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; called &quot;Straight Outta Nowhere: Scooby-Doo! Meets Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;. The film follows Scooby-Doo and his friends finding a suspicious object in Nowhere, Kansas, where Courage and his owners reside.

Marty Grabstein and Thea White reprise their roles as Courage and Muriel, while Eustace is voiced by Jeff Bergman because of the deaths of the character&#x27;s former voice casts Lionel Wilson and Arthur Anderson in 2003 and 2016, respectively. The film was released on DVD and digital on September 14, 2021. The film also serves as a posthumous role for Thea White, who died in July 2021, around two months before the film&#x27;s release date. Series creator John R. Dilworth did not have any involvement in the crossover. According to animator and artist Tracy Mark Lee, the film&#x27;s original premise was originally pitched as an episode of &quot;Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?&quot;

It initially assembled DKW vans and cars, then developed and manufactured its own vans and went on to assemble Austin and Renault cars. In 1988 it formed a formal joint venture with Renault to form Revoz and it became wholly owned by Renault in 2004.

==History==


The company was established in 1954 to sell and then assemble DKW Schnellaster vans under the Moto Montana. It became IMV in 1959 and started to assemble DKW Cars in 1962.

build a van following sales success of selling and DKW vans. Initially the IMV van retained DKW engines and became a versatile commercial vehicle throughout Yugoslavia in van, minibus and pick up forms. Following the demise of DKW, IMV used British Motor Corporation 1600 engines.

Building on the engine link with BMC, IMVs started to assembled cars by license from Austin between 1967 and 1972. The cars built were the Austin 1300, the Mini 1000, and the Austin Maxi 1500/1750. 

Following supply issues of parts for the Austin, IMV signed an agreement in 1972 with Renault and assembled the Renault 4 initially. 

In 1989, Renault took the complete ownership of IMV&#x27;s car manufacturing division under the name Revoz, 

IMV also produced Adria caravans from 1965 and later developed a motor home division in the early 1980s. This was spun out as a separate business entity in 1995 under the name Adria Mobil after Renault increasing its share in IMV and the Revoz factory.

==Products==
The IMV van was built in two sizes, the regular two-axle model and a longer dual rear axles version. A small number were exported to Austria as the Donau 1000.

<text>The Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) is a carnivorous plant native to the temperate and subtropical wetlands of North Carolina and South Carolina, on the East Coast of the United States. Although various modern hybrids have been created in cultivation, &quot;D. muscipula&quot; is the only species of the monotypic genus Dionaea. It is closely related to the waterwheel plant (&quot;Aldrovanda vesiculosa&quot;) and the cosmopolitan sundews (&quot;Drosera&quot;), all of which belong to the family Droseraceae. &quot;Dionaea&quot; catches its prey—chiefly insects and arachnids—with a &quot;jaw&quot;-like clamping structure, which is formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant&#x27;s leaves; when an insect makes contact with the open leaves, vibrations from the prey&#x27;s movements ultimately trigger the &quot;jaws&quot; to shut via tiny hairs (called &quot;trigger hairs&quot; or &quot;sensitive hairs&quot;) on their inner surfaces. Additionally, when an insect or spider touches one of these hairs, the trap prepares to close, only fully enclosing the prey if a second hair is contacted within (approximately) twenty seconds of the first contact. Triggers may occur as quickly as of a second from initial contact.

The requirement of repeated, seemingly redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against energy loss and to avoid trapping objects with no nutritional value; the plant will only begin digestion after five more stimuli are activated, ensuring that it has caught a live prey animal worthy of consumption. These hairs also possess a heat sensor. A forest fire, for example, causes them to snap shut, making the plant more resilient to periods of summer fires.

Although widely cultivated for sale, the population of the Venus flytrap has been rapidly declining in its native range. As of 2017, the species was under Endangered Species Act review by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service.

==Etymology==
The plant&#x27;s common name (originally &quot;Venus&#x27;s flytrap&quot;) refers to Venus, the Roman goddess of love. The genus name, &quot;Dionaea&quot; (&quot;daughter of Dione&quot;), refers to the Greek goddess Aphrodite, while the species name, &quot;muscipula&quot;, is Latin for both &quot;mousetrap&quot; and &quot;flytrap&quot;. The Latin word (&quot;mousetrap&quot;) is derived from &quot;mus&quot; (&quot;mouse&quot;) and (&quot;trap&quot;), while the homonym word (&quot;flytrap&quot;) is derived from (&quot;fly&quot;) and .

Historically, the plant was also known by the slang term &quot;tipitiwitchet&quot; or &quot;tippity twitchet&quot;, possibly an oblique reference to the plant&#x27;s resemblance to human female genitalia. The term is similar to the term tippet-de-witchet which derives from tippet and witchet (archaic term for vagina). In contrast, the English botanist John Ellis, who gave the plant its scientific name in 1768, wrote that the plant name tippitywichit was an indigenous word from either Cherokee or Catawba. The plant name according to the &quot;Handbook of American Indians&quot; derives from the Renape word &quot;titipiwitshik&quot; (&quot;they (leaves) which wind around (or involve)&quot;).

==Discovery by Europeans==
On 2 April 1759, the North Carolina colonial governor, Arthur Dobbs, penned the first written description of the plant in a letter to English botanist Peter Collinson. In the letter he wrote: &quot;We have a kind of Catch Fly Sensitive which closes upon anything that touches it. It grows in Latitude 34 but not in 35. I will try to save the seed here.&quot; A year later, Dobbs went into greater detail about the plant in a letter to Collinson dated Brunswick, 24 January 1760.

This was the first detailed recorded notice of the plant by Europeans. The description was before John Ellis&#x27; letter to &quot;The London Magazine&quot; on 1 September 1768, and his letter to Carl Linnaeus on 23 September 1768, in which he described the plant and proposed its English name &quot;Venus&#x27;s Flytrap&quot; and scientific name &quot;Dionaea muscipula&quot;.

== Description ==
The Venus flytrap is a small plant whose structure can be described as a rosette of four to seven leaves, which arise from a short subterranean stem that is actually a bulb-like object. Each stem reaches a maximum size of about three to ten centimeters, depending on the time of year; longer leaves with robust traps are usually formed after flowering. Flytraps that have more than seven leaves are colonies formed by rosettes that have divided beneath the ground.
=== Fly trap leaves ===
The leaf blade is divided into two regions: a flat, heart-shaped photosynthesis-capable petiole, and a pair of terminal lobes hinged at the midrib, forming the trap which is the true leaf. The upper surface of these lobes contains red anthocyanin pigments and its edges secrete mucilage. The lobes exhibit rapid plant movements, snapping shut when stimulated by prey. The trapping mechanism is tripped when prey contacts one of the three hair-like trichomes that are found on the upper surface of each of the lobes. The mechanism is so highly specialized that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli, such as falling raindrops; two trigger hairs must be touched in succession within 20 seconds of each other or one hair touched twice in rapid succession, whereupon the lobes of the trap will snap shut, typically in about one-tenth of a second. The edges of the lobes are fringed by stiff hair-like protrusions or cilia, which mesh together and prevent large prey from escaping. These protrusions, and the trigger hairs (also known as sensitive hairs) are likely homologous with the tentacles found in this plant&#x27;s close relatives, the sundews. Scientists have concluded that the snap trap evolved from a fly-paper trap similar to that of &quot;Drosera&quot;.

The holes in the meshwork allow small prey to escape, presumably because the benefit that would be obtained from them would be less than the cost of digesting them. If the prey is too small and escapes, the trap will usually reopen within 12 hours. If the prey moves around in the trap, it tightens and digestion begins more quickly.

Speed of closing can vary depending on the amount of humidity, light, size of prey, and general growing conditions. The speed with which traps close can be used as an indicator of a plant&#x27;s general health. Venus flytraps are not as humidity-dependent as are some other carnivorous plants, such as &quot;Nepenthes&quot;, &quot;Cephalotus&quot;, most &quot;Heliamphora&quot;, and some &quot;Drosera&quot;.

The Venus flytrap exhibits variations in petiole shape and length and whether the leaf lies flat on the ground or extends up at an angle of about 40–60 degrees. The four major forms are: &#x27;typica&#x27;, the most common, with broad decumbent petioles; &#x27;erecta&#x27;, with leaves at a 45-degree angle; &#x27;linearis&#x27;, with narrow petioles and leaves at 45 degrees; and &#x27;filiformis&#x27;, with extremely narrow or linear petioles. Except for &#x27;filiformis&#x27;, all of these can be stages in leaf production of any plant depending on season (decumbent in summer versus short versus semi-erect in spring), length of photoperiod (long petioles in spring versus short in summer), and intensity of light (wide petioles in low light intensity versus narrow in brighter light).

=== Other parts ===
The plant also has a flower on top of a long stem, about long. The flower is pollinated from various flying insects such as sweat bees, longhorn beetles and checkered beetles.

==Habitat and distribution==

===Habitat===

The Venus flytrap is found in nitrogen- and phosphorus-poor environments, such as bogs, wet savannahs, and canebrakes. Small in stature and slow-growing, the Venus flytrap tolerates fire well and depends on periodic burning to suppress its competition. Fire suppression threatens its future in the wild. It survives in wet sandy and peaty soils. Although it has been successfully transplanted and grown in many locales around the world, it is native only to the coastal bogs of North and South Carolina in the United States, specifically within a 100-kilometer (60 mi) radius of Wilmington, North Carolina. One such place is North Carolina&#x27;s Green Swamp. There also appears to be a naturalized population of Venus flytraps in northern Florida as well as an introduced population in western Washington. The nutritional poverty of the soil is the reason it relies on such elaborate traps: insect prey provide the nitrogen for protein formation that the soil cannot. They tolerate mild winters, and require a period of winter dormancy to survive freezing temperatures and low photoperiods. It is a common misconception that Venus flytraps require dormancy if kept indoors under sufficient artificial light. However, most professional carnivorous plant growers recommend dormancy, and Venus fly traps grown without dormancy may require more light, water, and food to remain healthy.

They are full sun plants, usually found only in areas with less than 10% canopy cover. The habitats where it thrives are typically either too nutrient-poor for many noncarnivorous plants to survive, or frequently disturbed by fires which regularly clear vegetation and prevent a shady overstory from developing. It can be found living alongside herbaceous plants, grasses, sphagnum, and fire-dependent Arundinaria bamboos. Regular fire disturbance is an important part of its habitat, required every 3–5 years in most places for &quot;D. muscipula&quot; to thrive. After fire, &quot;D. muscipula&quot; seeds germinate well in ash and sandy soil, with seedlings growing well in the open post-fire conditions. The seeds germinate immediately without a dormant period.

=== Distribution ===
&quot;Dionaea muscipula&quot; occurs naturally only along the coastal plain of North and South Carolina in the U.S., with all known current sites within of Wilmington, North Carolina. A 1958 survey of herbaria specimens and old documents found 259 sites where the historical record documented the presence of &quot;D. muscipula&quot;, within 21 counties in North and South Carolina. As of 2019, it was considered extirpated in North Carolina in the inland counties of Moore, Robeson, and Lenoir, as well as the South Carolina coastal counties of Charleston and Georgetown. Remaining extant populations exist in North Carolina in Beaufort, Craven, Pamlico, Carteret, Jones, Onslow, Duplin, Pender, New Hanover, Brunswick, Columbus, Bladen, Sampson, Cumberland, and Hoke counties, and in South Carolina in Horry county.

=== Population ===
A large-scale survey in 2019, conducted by the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program, counted a total of 163,951 individual Venus flytraps in North Carolina and 4,876 in South Carolina, estimating a total of 302,000 individuals remaining in the wild in its native range. This represents a reduction of more than 93% from a 1979 estimate of approximately 4,500,000 individuals. A 1958 study found 259 confirmed extant or historic sites. As of 2016, there were 71 known sites where the plant could be found in the wild. Of these 71 sites, only 20 were classified as having excellent or good long-term viability.

==Carnivory==
===Prey selectivity===

Most carnivorous plants selectively feed on specific prey. This selection is due to the available prey and the type of trap used by the organism. With the Venus flytrap, prey is limited to beetles, spiders and other crawling arthropods. The &quot;Dionaea&quot; diet is 33% ants, 30% spiders, 10% beetles, and 10% grasshoppers, with fewer than 5% flying insects.

Given that &quot;Dionaea&quot; evolved from an ancestral form of &quot;Drosera&quot; (carnivorous plants that use a sticky trap instead of a snap trap) the reason for this evolutionary branching becomes clear. &quot;Drosera&quot; consume smaller, aerial insects, whereas &quot;Dionaea&quot; consume larger terrestrial bugs. &quot;Dionaea&quot; are able to extract more nutrients from these larger bugs. This gives &quot;Dionaea&quot; an evolutionary advantage over their ancestral sticky trap form.

===Mechanism of trapping===

The Venus flytrap is one of a very small group of plants capable of rapid movement, such as &quot;Mimosa pudica&quot;, the telegraph plant, starfruit, sundews and bladderworts.

The mechanism by which the trap snaps shut involves a complex interaction between elasticity, turgor and growth. The trap only shuts when there have been two stimulations of the trigger hairs; this is to avoid inadvertent triggering of the mechanism by dust and other wind-borne debris. In the open, untripped state, the lobes are (bent outwards), but in the closed state, the lobes are (forming a cavity). It is the rapid flipping of this bistable state that closes the trap, but the mechanism by which this occurs is still poorly understood. When the trigger hairs are stimulated, an action potential (mostly involving calcium ions—see calcium in biology) is generated, which propagates across the lobes and stimulates cells in the lobes and in the midrib between them.

It is hypothesized that there is a threshold of ion buildup for the Venus flytrap to react to stimulation. The acid growth theory states that individual cells in the outer layers of the lobes and midrib rapidly move 1H+ (hydrogen ions) into their cell walls, lowering the pH and loosening the extracellular components, which allows them to swell rapidly by osmosis, thus elongating and changing the shape of the trap lobe. Alternatively, cells in the inner layers of the lobes and midrib may rapidly secrete other ions, allowing water to follow by osmosis, and the cells to collapse. Both of these mechanisms may play a role and have some experimental evidence to support them.
Flytraps show an example of memory in plants; the plant knows if one of its trigger hairs have been touched, and remembers this for a few seconds. If a second touch occurs during that time frame, the flytrap closes. After closing, the flytrap counts additional stimulations of the trigger hairs, to five total, to start the production of digesting enzymes.


===Digestion===
If the prey is unable to escape, it will continue to stimulate the inner surface of the lobes, and this causes a further growth response that forces the edges of the lobes together, eventually sealing the trap hermetically and forming a &quot;stomach&quot; in which digestion occurs. Release of the digestive enzymes is controlled by the hormone jasmonic acid, the same hormone that triggers the release of toxins as an anti-herbivore defense mechanism in non-carnivorous plants. (See Evolution below) Once the digestive glands in the leaf lobes have been activated, digestion is catalysed by hydrolase enzymes secreted by the glands. One of these enzymes includes GH18 chitinase, which breaks down chitin-containing exoskeleton of trapped insects. Synthesis of this enzyme begins with at least five action potentials, which will stimulate transcription of chitinase.

Oxidative protein modification is likely to be a pre-digestive mechanism used by &quot;Dionaea muscipula&quot;. Aqueous leaf extracts have been found to contain quinones such as the naphthoquinone plumbagin that couples to different NADH-dependent diaphorases to produce superoxide and hydrogen peroxide upon autoxidation. Such oxidative modification could rupture animal cell membranes. Plumbagin is known to induce apoptosis, associated with the regulation of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. When the &quot;Dionaea&quot; extracts were pre-incubated with diaphorases and NADH in the presence of serum albumin (SA), subsequent tryptic digestion of SA was facilitated. Since the secretory glands of Droseraceae contain proteases and possibly other degradative enzymes, it may be that the presence of oxygen-activating redox cofactors function as extracellular pre-digestive oxidants to render membrane-bound proteins of the prey (insects) more susceptible to proteolytic attacks.

Digestion takes about ten days, after which the prey is reduced to a husk of chitin. The trap then reopens, and is ready for reuse.

==Evolution==

Carnivory in plants is a very specialized form of foliar feeding, and is an adaptation found in several plants that grow in nutrient-poor soil. Carnivorous traps were naturally selected to allow these organisms to compensate for the nutrient deficiencies of their harsh environments and compensate for the reduced photosynthetic benefit. Phylogenetic studies have shown that carnivory in plants is a common adaptation in habitats with abundant sunlight and water but scarce nutrients. Carnivory has evolved independently six times in the angiosperms based on extant species, with likely many more carnivorous plant lineages now extinct.

The &quot;snap trap&quot; mechanism characteristic of &quot;Dionaea&quot; is shared with only one other carnivorous plant genus, &quot;Aldrovanda&quot;. For most of the 20th century, this relationship was thought to be coincidental, more precisely an example of convergent evolution. Some phylogenetic studies even suggested that the closest living relatives of &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; were the sundews. It was not until 2002 that a molecular evolutionary study, by analyzing combined nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences, indicated that &quot;Dionaea&quot; and &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; were closely related and that the snap trap mechanism evolved only once in a common ancestor of the two genera.

A 2009 study presented evidence for the evolution of snap traps of &quot;Dionaea&quot; and &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; from a flypaper trap like &quot;Drosera regia&quot;, based on molecular data. The molecular and physiological data imply that &quot;Dionaea&quot; and &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; snap traps evolved from the flypaper traps of a common ancestor with &quot;Drosera&quot;. Pre-adaptations to the evolution of snap traps were identified in several species of &quot;Drosera&quot;, such as rapid leaf and tentacle movement. The model proposes that plant carnivory by snap trap evolved from the flypaper traps, driven by increasing prey size. Bigger prey provides greater nutritional value, but large insects can easily escape the sticky mucilage of flypaper traps; the evolution of snap traps would therefore prevent escape and kleptoparasitism (theft of prey captured by the plant before it can derive benefit from it), and would also permit a more complete digestion.

In 2016, a study of the expression of genes in the plant&#x27;s leaves as they captured and digested prey was published in the journal, &quot;Genome Research&quot;. The gene activation observed in the leaves of the plants gives support to the hypothesis that the carnivorous mechanisms present in the flytrap are a specially adapted version of mechanisms used by non-carnivorous plants to defend against herbivorous insects. In many non-carnivorous plants, jasmonic acid serves as a signaling molecule for the activation of defense mechanisms, such as the production of hydrolases, which can destroy chitin and other molecular components of insect and microbial pests. In the Venus flytrap, this same molecule has been found to be responsible for the activation of the plant&#x27;s digestive glands. A few hours after the capture of prey, another set of genes is activated inside the glands, the same set of genes that is active in the roots of other plants, allowing them to absorb nutrients. The use of similar biological pathways in the traps as non-carnivorous plants use for other purposes indicates that somewhere in its evolutionary history, the Venus flytrap repurposed these genes to facilitate carnivory.

===Proposed evolutionary history===
Carnivorous plants are generally herbaceous, and their traps the result of primary growth. They generally do not form readily fossilizable structures such as thick bark or wood. As a result, there is no fossil evidence of the steps that might link &quot;Dionaea&quot; and &quot;Aldrovanda&quot;, or either genus with their common ancestor, &quot;Drosera&quot;. Nevertheless, it is possible to infer an evolutionary history based on phylogenetic studies of both genera. Researchers have proposed a series of steps that would ultimately result in the complex snap-trap mechanism:

* Larger insects usually walk over the plant, instead of flying to it, and are more likely to break free from sticky glands alone. Therefore, a plant with wider leaves, like &quot;Drosera falconeri&quot;, must have adapted to move the trap and its stalks in directions that maximized its chance of capturing and retaining such prey—in this particular case, longitudinally. Once adequately &quot;wrapped&quot;, escape would be more difficult.
* Evolutionary pressure then selected for plants with shorter response time, in a manner similar to &quot;Drosera burmanni&quot; or &quot;Drosera glanduligera&quot;. The faster the closing, the less reliant on the flypaper model the plant would be.
* As the trap became more and more active, the energy required to &quot;wrap&quot; the prey increased. Plants that could somehow differentiate between actual insects and random detritus/rain droplets would have an advantage, thus explaining the specialization of inner tentacles into trigger hairs.
* Ultimately, as the plant relied more on closing around the insect rather than gluing them to the leaf surface, the tentacles so evident in &quot;Drosera&quot; would lose their original function altogether, becoming the &quot;teeth&quot; and trigger hairs—an example of natural selection utilizing pre-existing structures for new functions.
* Completing the transition, the plant eventually developed the depressed digestive glands found inside the trap, rather than using the dews in the stalks, further differentiating it from genus &quot;Drosera&quot;.

Phylogenetic studies using molecular characters place the emergence of carnivory in the ancestors of &quot;Dionaea muscipula&quot; to 85.6&quot; &quot;million years ago, and the development of the snap-trap in the ancestors of &quot;Dionaea&quot; and its sister genus &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; to approximately 48&quot; &quot;million years ago.

==Cultivation==

Plants can be propagated by seed, taking around four to five years to reach maturity. More commonly, they are propagated by clonal division in spring or summer. Venus flytraps can also be propagated &quot;in vitro&quot; using plant tissue culture. Most Venus flytraps found for sale in nurseries garden centers have been produced using this method, as this is the most cost-effective way to propagate them on a large scale. Regardless of the propagation method used, the plants will live for 20 to 30 years if cultivated in the right conditions.

===Cultivars===

Venus flytraps are by far the most commonly recognized and cultivated carnivorous plant, and they are frequently sold as houseplants. Various cultivars (cultivated varieties) have come into the market through tissue culture of selected genetic mutations, and these plants are raised in large quantities for commercial markets. The cultivars &#x27;Akai Ryu&#x27; and &#x27;South West Giant&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Conservation==
Although widely cultivated for sale as a houseplant, &quot;D. muscipula&quot; has suffered a significant decline in its population in the wild. The population in its native range is estimated to have decreased 93% since 1979.

=== Status ===
The species is under Endangered Species Act review by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. The current review commenced in 2018, after an initial &quot;90-day&quot; review found that action may be warranted. A previous review in 1993 resulted in a determination that the plant was a &quot;Potential candidate without sufficient data on vulnerability&quot;. The IUCN Red List classifies the species as &quot;vulnerable&quot;. The State of North Carolina lists &quot;Dionaea muscipula&quot; as a species of &quot;Special Concern–Vulnerable&quot;. The species is protected under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international trade (including in parts and derivatives) is regulated by the CITES permitting system. NatureServe classified it as &quot;Imperiled&quot; (G2) in a 2018 review.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has not indicated a timeline to conclude its current review of &quot;Dionaea muscipula&quot;. The Endangered Species Act specifies a two-year timeline for a species review. However, the species listing process takes 12.1 years on average.

=== Threats ===
The Venus flytrap is only found in the wild in a very particular set of conditions, requiring flat land with moist, acidic, nutrient-poor soils that receive full sun and burn frequently in forest fires, and is therefore sensitive to many types of disturbance. A 2011 review identified five categories of threats for the species: agriculture, road-building, biological resource use (poaching and lumber activities), natural systems modifications (drainage and fire suppression), and pollution (fertilizer).

Habitat loss is a major threat to the species. The human population of the coastal Carolinas is rapidly expanding. For example, Brunswick County, North Carolina, which has the largest number of Venus flytrap populations, has seen a 27% increase in its human population from 2010 to 2018. As the population grows, residential and commercial development and road building directly eliminate flytrap habitat, while site preparation that entails ditching and draining can dry out soil in surrounding areas, destroying the viability of the species. Additionally, increased recreational use of natural areas in populated areas directly destroys the plants by crushing or uprooting them.

Fire suppression is another threat to the Venus flytrap. In the absence of regular fires, shrubs and trees encroach, outcompeting the species and leading to local extirpations. &quot;D. muscipula&quot; requires fire every 3–5 years, and best thrives with annual brush fires. Although flytraps and their seeds are typically killed alongside their competition in fires, seeds from flytraps adjacent to the burnt zone propagate quickly in the ash and full sun conditions that occur after a fire disturbance. Because the mature plants and new seedlings are typically destroyed in the regular fires that are necessary to maintain their habitat, &quot;D. muscipula&quot;&#x27;s survival relies upon adequate seed production and dispersal from outside the burnt patches back into the burnt habitat, requiring a critical mass of populations, and exposing the success of any one population to metapopulation dynamics. These dynamics make small, isolated populations particularly vulnerable to extirpation, for if there are no mature plants adjacent to the fire zone, there is no source of seeds post-fire.

Poaching has been another cause of population decline. Harvesting Venus flytraps on public land became illegal in North Carolina in 1958, and since then a legal cultivation industry has formed, growing tens of thousands of flytraps in commercial greenhouses for sale as household plants. Yet in 2016, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that demand for wild plants still exists, which &quot;has led to a &#x27;Venus flytrap crime ring. In 2014, the state of North Carolina made Venus flytrap poaching a felony. Since then, several poachers have been charged, with one man receiving 17 months in prison for poaching 970 Venus flytraps, and another man charged with 73 felony counts in 2019. Poachers may do greater harm to the wild populations than a simple count of individuals taken would indicate, as they may selectively harvest the largest plants at a site, which have more flowers and fruit and therefore generate more seeds than smaller plants.

Additionally, the species is particularly vulnerable to catastrophic climate events. Most Venus flytrap sites are only 2–4 meters (6.5 –13 feet) above sea level and are located in a region prone to hurricanes, making storm surges and rising sea levels a long-term threat.

== Designations ==
In 2005, the Venus flytrap was designated as the state carnivorous plant of North Carolina.

==In alternative medicine==
Venus flytrap extract is available on the market as an herbal remedy, sometimes as the prime ingredient of a patent medicine named &quot;Carnivora&quot;. According to the American Cancer Society, these products are promoted in alternative medicine as a treatment for a variety of human ailments including HIV, Crohn&#x27;s disease and skin cancer, even though available scientific evidence does not support these health claims.

<text>Roverandom is a novella by J. R. R. Tolkien, originally told in 1925, about the adventures of a young dog, Rover. In the story, an irritable wizard turns Rover into a toy, and Rover goes to the Moon and under the sea in order to find the wizard again to turn him back into a normal-sized dog. The author wrote &quot;Roverandom&quot; for his son Michael to amuse him upon the loss of his favourite toy, a little leaden dog which he lost on a beach of grey shingle stones the same size and colour as the toy. The work is in tone a children&#x27;s story, but contains many allusions and references in the manner of &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;.

It was submitted for publication in 1937 after the success of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, but was not published for over sixty years, finally being released in 1998. &quot;Roverandom&quot; was included in the collection &quot;Tales from the Perilous Realm&quot; from its 2009 reprinting onwards.

== Characters ==
Major
* Rover(andom) - The main character. A young puppy that is white with black ears. He is rather rude and excitable when first introduced. This is what causes him to irritate Artaxerxes in the first place.
* Artaxerxes - The wizard who meets Roverandom while on holiday. Wears a green hat with a blue feather in it. Comes from Persia but got lost and now lives in Pershore.
* Psamathos Psamathides - The chief of all Psamathists (sand-sorcerers). He is described as being the size of a large dog and being very ugly, with long ears that stick up. Days and nights he hides closely under the surface of the cove&#x27;s sands, taking a nap - or two. He snuggles himself into the sand as into a warm blanket and only comes out when the sky begins to look like teatime or when some amusement is going on: a dance of the mermaids, for example. Otherwise one can hardly find him, tucked up amidst the endlessly stretching covesands. (This being somewhat resembles the Psammead from E. Nesbit&#x27;s &quot;Five Children and It&quot;.)
* Rover the Moon Dog - The Man in the Moon&#x27;s dog.
* Rover the Sea Dog - The Dog under the Sea.
Minor
* Tinker - The cat whom Rover lived with before becoming a toy.
* Little Boy Two - The boy who owned Rover as a toy. An allusion to Michael Tolkien, the author&#x27;s second son.
* the Great White Dragon - The chief of the Moon&#x27;s dragons.
* the Sea-serpent
* Uin - The right whale that takes Roverandom under the Sea.
* Grandmother - Roverandom&#x27;s first owner. It is revealed at the end that she is the grandmother of Little Boy Two.
* the mer-king - ruler of the mer-folk
* Mrs. Artaxerxes - Daughter of the mer-king and wife of Artaxerxes.

== Places ==
* The Moon - Rover goes to the Moon seeking the Man in the Moon&#x27;s help. The Moon is highly fantasized; envisioned by Tolkien as a place full of mythical creatures reminiscent of those found in the works of Lewis Carroll. Traits of the Moon&#x27;s trees foreshadow those of the mallorn trees of Lothlórien.
* The Cove - Where Psamathos lives and Roverandom is accidentally left by Boy Two. It is located on the north-east coast of England. Its description as a &quot;queer cove&quot;, an allusion to the English expression meaning &#x27;odd fellow, rogue&#x27;, is one of many plays-on-words in the book.
* The Isle of Dogs - An island Mew and Rover fly over on the way to the moon. Mew describes it as a place lucky or deserving lost dogs go. A place where they can make as much noise as they want, with bone trees growing everywhere. It is a fanciful allusion to the Isle of Dogs and the Dogger Bank.
* Under the Sea - The mer-king&#x27;s realm
* Faery: the tale&#x27;s brief glimpse of the Shadowy Seas and Elvenhome links it to Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth legendarium.

<text>Henry Raspe (; – 16 February 1247) was the Landgrave of Thuringia from 1231 until 1239 and again from 1241 until his death. In 1246, with the support of the Papacy, he was elected King of Germany in opposition to Conrad IV, but his contested reign lasted a mere nine months.

==Biography==
Henry Raspe was born to Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia and Sophia of Wittelsbach.
In 1226, Henry&#x27;s brother Louis IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, died en route to the Sixth Crusade, and Henry became regent for his under-age nephew Hermann II, Landgrave of Thuringia. He managed to expel his nephew and the boy&#x27;s young mother, St. Elisabeth of Hungary, from the line of succession and ca. 1231 formally succeeded his brother as landgrave.

In 1242 Henry, together with King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, he was selected by Emperor Frederick II to be administrator of Germany for Frederick&#x27;s under-age son Conrad.

After Pope Innocent IV imposed a ban on Frederick in 1245, Raspe changed sides, and on 22 May 1246 he was elected anti-king in opposition to Conrad. The strong papal prodding that led to his election earned Raspe the derogatory moniker of &quot;Pfaffenkönig&quot; (priests&#x27; king). The papal legate in Germany was Filippo da Pistoia. In August 1246 Henry defeated Conrad in the Battle of Nidda in southern Hesse, and laid siege to Ulm and Reutlingen. He suffered a mortal wound, and died 16 February 1247 in Wartburg Castle near Eisenach in Thuringia.

== Personal life ==

In 1228, Henry Raspe married Elisabeth (1206–1231), the daughter of Albert II, Margrave of Brandenburg. After her death, he married Gertrude ( – 1241), the daughter of Leopold VI, Duke of Austria. After Gertrude of Babenberg&#x27;s death, he married Beatrice of Brabant (1225–1288), the daughter of Henry II, Duke of Brabant.

All three of his marriages were childless. After his death, the Emperor enfeoffed Thuringia to Henry III, Margrave of Meissen, the son of his sister Jutta.

<text>Maryland is a neighbourhood in Stratford in London, United Kingdom. It is in the London Borough of Newham. The community centres around Maryland Station and borders Leytonstone to the north, Stratford New Town to the west and Forest Gate to the east, with Stratford town centre to the south-west.

==History==
Maryland&#x27;s earliest known recorded appearance is on a map of Essex published by J. Oliver in 1696, where it is marked as &#x27;Maryland Point&#x27;. The origin of the name is uncertain:

* One popular theory is that it originated with a rich local merchant who bought land and built in the area having returned from the then American colony of Maryland. If true, then London&#x27;s Maryland would be an unusual example of a place in Britain named after an American location. Various attempts have been made to identify such a merchant. Richard Lee (1617–1664, great-great-grandfather of Confederate General Robert E. Lee), who emigrated to Virginia around 1640 and became a tobacco planter, trader, an owner and trader of slaves, had an estate which included land on the Maryland side of the Potomac River, near a place known as Maryland Point (later to be the site of the Maryland Point Light). On returning to England in 1658, Lee bought land in Stratford, and in 1662 was recorded as owning a large house there. However, retired history professor Ged Martin has questioned the American name-origin theory, finding limited documentary support for the story, and noting that Lee&#x27;s interests were far more associated with Virginia than Maryland.
*Professor Martin has put forward an explanation that the name has an etymology related to similar names in the region and derives from Old English words for a boundary, cognate to the Anglo-Saxon words &quot;maere&quot; and &quot;mearc&quot;.

With the growth of Stratford in the mid-19th century the vicinity was built up as Stratford New Town, and Maryland gained a prosperous shopping thoroughfare. Maryland station opened in 1874.

By 2021, the population and distinctivness of the area was sufficient for it to be recognised for the first time as an electoral ward in Newham, with the first two councillors for Maryland elected in 2022.

== Notable people ==
*&#x27;The Birthplace of Iron Maiden&#x27;, Cart &amp; Horses, 1 Maryland Point
*Charles Edmund Clutterbuck (1806–1861), stained glass artist
*Charles Hitchcock, grandfather to Alfred Hitchcock, had a fishmongery business at 20 Leytonstone Road
*Dorothy Kilner (1755–1836), children&#x27;s writer
*Anna Kingsford (1846–1888), anti-vivisectionist, theosophist, suffragette and campaigner for women&#x27;s rights, née Bonus, was born at Maryland Point

==Transport==

*Maryland Station is served by Elizabeth line trains, with a frequency of 5 minutes in each direction. Trains towards central London run a stopping service terminating at London Paddington and Heathrow Airport. To the east, trains run a stopping service terminating at Shenfield. 
*Maryland is served by bus routes 69 (24hr), 257, 308, and night bus N8.

==Education==

Local primary schools include Maryland Primary School, St. Francis&#x27; Catholic Primary School, and Colegrave Primary School.

<text>Muhammad Ahmad bin Abdullah bin Fahal (; 12 August 1843 – 21 June 1885) was a Sudanese religious and political leader. In 1881, he claimed to be the Mahdi and led a war against Egyptian rule in Sudan, which culminated in a remarkable victory over them in the Siege of Khartoum. He created a vast Islamic state extending from the Red Sea to Central Africa and founded a movement that remained influential in Sudan a century later.

From his announcement of the Mahdist State in June 1881 until its end in 1898, the Mahdi&#x27;s supporters, the Ansār, established many of its theological and political doctrines. After Muhammad Ahmad&#x27;s unexpected death from typhus on 22 June 1885, his chief deputy, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad took over the administration of the nascent Mahdist State.

The Mahdist State, weakened by his successor&#x27;s autocratic rule and inability to unify the populace to resist the British blockade and subsequent war, was dissolved following the Anglo-Egyptian conquest of Sudan, in 1899. Despite that, the Mahdi remains a respected figure in the history of Sudan. In the late 20th century, one of his direct descendants, Sadiq al-Mahdi, twice served as prime minister of Sudan (1966–1967 and 1986–1989) and pursued pro-democracy policies.

==Early life==
Mohammed Ahmed bin Abdullah bin Fahal was born on 12 August 1843 in Labab Island, Dongola in northern Sudan. He was born into a notable religious Arabized Nubian family tracing their lineage from the Prophet of Islam Muhammad through the lineage of his grandson Hassan. When Mohammed Ahmed was still a child, his family moved to the town of Karari, north of Omdurman. There his father, Ahmad bin Abdullah, managed to find enough supplies of wood for his work in boat-building, but died shortly after they arrived. After the death of his father, his brothers Mohammed and Hamed, who continued to trade and built boats. Then the family moved to live in Khartoum for a short time, where their mother, Zainab bint Nasr, died and was buried. 

While his siblings joined his father&#x27;s trade, Muhammad Ahmad showed a proclivity for religious study. He studied first under Sheikh al-Amin al-Suwaylih in the Gezira region south of Khartoum, and subsequently under Sheikh Muhammad al-Dikayr &#x27;Abdallah Khujali near the town of Berber in northern Sudan. 

Determined to live a life of asceticism, mysticism and worship, in 1861 he sought out Sheikh Muhammad Sharif Nur al-Dai&#x27;m, the grandson of the founder of the Samaniyya Sufi sect in Sudan. Muhammad Ahmad stayed with Sheikh Muhammad Sharif for seven years, during which time he was recognized for his piety and asceticism. Near the end of this period, he was awarded the title of Sheikh, and began to travel around the country on religious missions. He was permitted to give tariqa and Uhūd to new followers.

In 1870, his family moved again in search for timber, returning to Aba Island. There, Muhammad Ahmad built a mosque and started to teach the Quran. He soon gained a notable reputation among the local population as an excellent speaker and mystic. The broad thrust of his teaching followed that of other reformers: his Islam was one devoted to the words of Muhammad and based on a return to the virtues of strict devotion, prayer, and simplicity as laid down in the Quran.

In 1872, Muhammad Ahmad invited Sheikh Sharif to move to al-Aradayb, an area on the White Nile neighboring Aba Island. Despite initially amicable relations, in 1878 the two religious leaders had a dispute motivated by Sheikh Sharif&#x27;s resentment of his former student&#x27;s growing popularity. As a result, Sheikh Sharif expelled his former student from the Samaniyya Order and, despite numerous attempts at reconciliation by Muhammad Ahmad, his mentor refused to make peace.

After recognizing that the split with Sheikh Sharif was irreconcilable, Muhammad Ahmad approached another respected leader of the Samaniyya Order named Sheikh al-Qurashi wad al-Zayn. Muhammad Ahmad resumed his life of piety and religious devotion at Aba Island. During this period, he also traveled to the province of Kordofan, west of Khartoum, where he visited with the notables of the capital, El-Obeid. They were enmeshed in a power struggle between two rival claimants to the governorship of the province.

On 25 July 1878, Sheikh al-Qurashi died and his followers recognized Muhammad Ahmad as their new leader. Around this time, Muhammad Ahmad first met Abdallahi bin Muhammad al-Ta&#x27;aishi, who was to become his chief deputy and successor in the years to come.

==Announcement of the Mahdiyya==
On 29 June 1881, Muhammad Ahmad claimed to be the Mahdi so as to prepare the way for the second coming of Jesus. In part, his claim was based on his status as a prominent Sufi sheikh with a large following in the Samaniyya Order and among the tribes in the area around Aba Island. 

Yet the idea of the Mahdiyya had been central to the belief of the Samaniyya prior to Muhammad Ahmad&#x27;s pronouncement. The previous Samaniyya leader, Sheikh al-Qurashi Wad al-Zayn, had asserted that the long-awaited-for redeemer would come from the Samaniyya line. According to Sheikh al-Qurashi, the Mahdi would make himself known through a number of signs, some established in the early period of Islam and recorded in the Hadith literature. Others had a more distinctly local origin, such as the prediction that the Mahdi would ride the sheikh&#x27;s pony and erect a dome over his grave after his death.

Drawing from aspects of the Sufi tradition that were intimately familiar to both his followers and his opponents, Muhammad Ahmad claimed that he had been appointed as the Mahdi by a prophetic assembly or &quot;hadra&quot; (Arabic: Al-Hadra Al-Nabawiyya, الحضرة النبوية). A hadra, in the Sufi tradition, is a gathering of all the prophets from the time of Adam to Muhammad, as well as many Sufi holy men who are believed to have reached the highest level of affinity with the divine during their lifetime. The hadra is chaired by Muhammad, known as Sayyid al-Wujud, and at his side are the seven Qutb, the most senior of whom is known as Ghawth az-Zaman. The hadra was also the source of a number of central beliefs about the Mahdi, including that he was created from the sacred light at the centre of Muhammad&#x27;s heart, and that all living creatures had acknowledged the Mahdi&#x27;s claim since his birth.

Muhammad Ahmad framed the Mahdiyya as a return to the early days of Islam, when the Muslim community, or Ummah, was unified under the guidance of Muhammad and his immediate successors. Later, in order to distinguish his followers from adherents of other Sufi sects, the Mahdi forbade the use of the word &quot;darwish&quot; (commonly known as &quot;dervish&quot; in English) to describe his followers, replacing it with the title Ansār, the term which Muhammad used for the people of Medina who welcomed him and his followers after their flight from Mecca.

==Response of the &#x27;Ulema==
Despite his popularity among the clerics of the Samaniyya and other sects, and among the tribes of western Sudan, some of the Ulema, or orthodox religious authorities, rejected Muhammad Ahmad&#x27;s claim as the Mahdi. Among his most prominent critics were the Sudanese Ulema loyal to the Ottoman Sultan and employed by the Turco-Egyptian government. Examples were the Mufti Shakir al-Ghazi, who sat on the Council of Appeal in Khartoum, and the Qadi Ahmad al-Azhari in Kordofan. These critics were careful not to deny the concept of the Mahdi as such, but rather to discredit Muhammad Ahmad&#x27;s claim to it. 

They pointed out that Muhammad Ahmad&#x27;s manifestation did not conform to the prophecies laid out in the Hadith literature. In particular, they argued for the political interests of the Turco-Egyptian government and its British rulers, that his manifestation did not conform with the &quot;time of troubles&quot; &quot;when the land is filled with oppression, tyranny, and enmity&quot;.

==Advance of the rebellion==

When Governor General Muhammad Rauf Pasha in Khartoum learned of the 29 June 1881 declaration by Muhammad Ahmad as the Mahdi, he believed that the man would be satisfied with a government pension, and he sent Ahmad a friendly letter. The Mahdi telegraphed an uncompromising reply, saying, &quot;He who does not believe in me will be purified by the sword.&quot;

Mohammed Rauf Pasha sent a small party to arrest the Mahdi on Aba Island, but on 11 August 1881 it was overwhelmed, and the insurrection in southern Sudan began to grow. Rauf Pasha downplayed the &quot;affray&quot; in his report to Cairo, and sent the governor of Kordofan to Aba Island with 1,000 soldiers to crush the Mahdi. When they arrived, they found the Mahdi had fled to the southwest. The soldiers marched after him, but gave up the pursuit when the September rains flooded the roads and riverbeds; they returned to El-Obeid. The Mahdi established a new base in the Nuba Mountains.

The Mahdi and a party of his followers, the &quot;Ansār&quot; (helpers, known in the West as &quot;the Dervishes&quot;), made a long march to Kurdufan. There he gained numerous recruits, especially from the Baqqara, and notable leaders such as Sheikh Madibbo ibn Ali of the Rizeigat and Abdallahi ibn Muhammad of the Ta&#x27;aisha tribes. They were also joined by the Hadendoa Beja, who were rallied to the Mahdi in 1883 by Osman Digna, an Ansār captain in eastern Sudan.
The Mahdist revolution was backed by the northern and western regions of Sudan. It also found great support from the Nuer, Shilluk and Anuak tribes of southern Sudan, in addition to the tribes of Bahr Alghazal. This widespread support affirmed that the Mahdist Revolution was a national rather than regional revolution. In addition to unifying different tribes, the revolution cut across religious divides, despite its religious origins. The Mahdi was supported by non-Muslims and Muslims alike. This had important implications for the slave trade. Going against traditional Islamic injunctions, the Mahdi allowed the enslavement of free Muslims, if they did not support him, and forbade the enslavement of traditional victims, non-Muslims, if they supported him.

Late in 1883, the Ansār, armed only with spears and swords, overwhelmed a 4,000-man Egyptian force not far from El-Obeid, and seized their rifles and ammunition. The Mahdi followed up this victory by laying siege to El-Obeid and starving it into submission after four months. The town remained the headquarters of the Ansār for much of the decade.

The Ansār, now 40,000 strong, defeated an 8,000-man Egyptian relief force led by British officer William Hicks near Kashgil, in the Battle of Shaykan. The defeat of Hicks also resulted in the fall of Darfur to the Ansār, which until then had been effectively defended by Rudolf Carl von Slatin. Jabal Qadir in the south was also taken. The western half of Sudan was now firmly in Ansārī hands.

Their success emboldened the Hadendoa, who under the generalship of Osman Digna wiped out a smaller force of Egyptians under the command of Colonel Valentine Baker near the Red Sea port of Suakin. Major General Gerald Graham was sent with a force of 4,000 British soldiers and defeated Digna at El Teb on 29 February. Two weeks later he suffered high casualties at Tamai, and Graham eventually withdrew his forces.

==Khartoum==

After much debate the British decided to abandon Sudan in December 1883, holding only several northern towns and Red Sea ports, such as Khartoum, Kassala, Sannar, and Sawakin. The evacuation of Egyptian troops and officials, and other foreigners from Sudan was assigned to General Charles George Gordon, who had been reappointed governor general with orders to return to Khartoum and organize a withdrawal of the Egyptian garrisons there.

===Arrival of Gordon===
Gordon reached Khartoum in February 1884. At first he was greeted with jubilation, as many of the tribes in the immediate area were at odds with the Mahdists. Transportation northward was still open and the telegraph lines intact. But the uprising of the Beja soon after his arrival changed things considerably, reducing communications to runners.

Gordon considered the routes northward to be too dangerous to extricate the garrisons and so pressed for reinforcements to be sent from Cairo to help with the withdrawal. He also suggested that his old enemy Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur, a fine military commander, be given tacit control of the Sudan in order to provide a counter to the Ansār. London rejected both proposals, and so Gordon prepared for a fight.

In March 1884, Gordon tried to stage an offensive to clear the road northward to Egypt, but a number of the officers in the Egyptian force went over to the enemy and their forces fled the field after firing a single salvo. This convinced him that he could carry out only defensive operations, and he returned to Khartoum to construct defensive works.

By April 1884, Gordon had managed to evacuate some 2,500 of the foreign population who had been able to make the trek northwards. His mobile force under Colonel Stewart returned to Khartoum after repeated incidents when the 200 or so Egyptian forces under his command would turn and run at the slightest provocation.

===Siege===
That month the Ansār besieged Khartoum, and Gordon was completely cut off. But his defensive works, consisting mainly of mines, proved so frightening to the Ansār that they were unable to penetrate the city. Once the waters rose, Stewart used gunboats on the Nile to conduct several small skirmishes and in August managed to recapture Berber for a short time. But Stewart was killed soon after in another foray from Berber to Dongola, a fact Gordon learned only in a letter from the Mahdi himself.

Under increasing pressure from the public to support Gordon, the British Government under Prime Minister Gladstone eventually had ordered Lord Garnet Joseph Wolseley to relieve Gordon. He was already deployed in Egypt due to the attempted coup there earlier, and organized a large force of infantry, but advanced at an extremely slow rate. Realizing they would take some time to arrive, Gordon pressed Wolseley to send forward a &quot;flying column&quot; of camel-borne troops across the Bayyudah Desert from Wadi Halfa under the command of Brigadier-General Sir Herbert Stewart. This force was attacked by the Hadendoa Beja, or &quot;Fuzzy Wuzzies&quot;, twice, first at the Battle of Abu Klea and two days later closer to Metemma. Twice the British square held and the Mahdists were repelled with high losses.

At Metemma, north of Khartoum, Wolseley&#x27;s advance guard met four of Gordon&#x27;s steamers, sent downriver to provide speedy transport for the first relieving troops. They gave Wolseley a dispatch from Gordon claiming that the city was about to fall. Moments later a runner brought in another message, claiming the city could hold out for a year. Deciding to believe the latter, the force stopped while they refit the steamers to hold more troops.

===Fall of Khartoum===
They finally reached Khartoum on 28 January 1885, to find the town had fallen two days earlier during the siege of Khartoum. After the Nile had receded from flood stage, one of Gordon&#x27;s pashas (officers), Faraz Pasha, had opened the river gates and let the Ansār in. The garrison was slaughtered, the male population massacred, and the women and children enslaved. Gordon was killed fighting the Mahdi&#x27;s warriors on the steps of the palace, where he was hacked to pieces and beheaded. When Gordon&#x27;s head was unwrapped at the Mahdi&#x27;s feet, he ordered the head to be fixed between the branches of a tree &quot;where all who passed it could look in disdain, children could throw stones at it and the hawks of the desert could sweep and circle above.&quot; When Wolseley&#x27;s force arrived in Khartoum, they retreated after attempting to force their way to the center of the town on ships, where they were met by a hail of gunfire.

The Mahdi Army continued its sweep of victories. Kassala and Sannar fell soon after and, by the end of 1885, the Ansār had begun to move into the southern regions of Sudan. In all of Sudan, only Suakin, reinforced by Indian troops, and Wadi Halfa on the northern frontier remained in Anglo-Egyptian hands.

===Death and succession===

Five months after the capture of Khartoum, Muhammad Ahmad died of typhus. He was buried in Omdurman near the ruins of Khartoum. The Mahdi had planned for this eventuality and had chosen three deputies to replace him.

After the final defeat of the Khalifa by the British under General Kitchener in 1898, Muhammad Ahmad&#x27;s tomb was destroyed to prevent it from becoming a rallying point for his supporters. His bones were thrown into the Nile. Kitchener was said to have retained his skull and, in the words of Winston Churchill, &quot;carried off the Mahdi&#x27;s head in a kerosene can as a trophy&quot;. Allegedly the skull was later buried at Wadi Halfa. The tomb was eventually rebuilt.

==Aftermath==

===Political heritage===
Muhammed Ahmad&#x27;s son, Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi, born after his father&#x27;s death, whom the British considered important as a popular leader of the Mahdists, became a leader of the neo-Mahdist movement in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Some Sudanese considered Abd al-Rahman to qualify as future King of Sudan, as the country gained independence, but he declined the title for spiritual reasons. &#x27;Abd al-Rahman sponsored the Umma (Nation) political Party in the period before and just after Sudan became independent in 1956.

In modern-day Sudan, Muhammad Ahmad is sometimes considered to be a precursor of Sudanese nationalism. The Umma party claim to be his political descendants. Their former leader, Imam Sadiq al-Mahdi, was the great-great-grandson of Muhammad Ahmad, and also the imam of the Ansār, the religious order that pledges allegiance to Muhammad Ahmad. Sadiq al-Mahdi was a democratic leader and Prime Minister of Sudan on two occasions: first briefly in 1966–1967, and then between 1986 and 1989. Further, the Mahdi is an ancestor of Sudanese-English actor Alexander Siddig, whose birth name was Siddig El Tahir El Fadil El Siddig Abdurrahman Mohammed Ahmed Abdel Karim El Mahdi.

<doc id="310696" wikidata="Q1111179" url="?curid=310696" title="The d'Artagnan Romances">
<text>The d&#x27;Artagnan Romances are a set of three novels by Alexandre Dumas (1802–1870), telling the story of the 17th-century musketeer d&#x27;Artagnan.

Dumas based the character and attributes of d&#x27;Artagnan on captain of musketeers Charles de Batz-Castelmore d&#x27;Artagnan (&quot;c.&quot; 1611–1673) and the portrayal was particularly indebted to d&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s semi-fictionalized memoirs as written 27 years after the hero&#x27;s death by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras (published 1700).

==Books in the series==

*&quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, set between 1625 and 1628; first published in serial form in the magazine &quot;Le Siècle&quot; between March and July 1844. Dumas claims in the foreword to have based it on manuscripts he had discovered in the Bibliothèque Nationale.
*&quot;Twenty Years After&quot;, set between 1648 and 1649; serialized from January to August 1845.
*&quot;The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later&quot;, set between 1660 and 1673; serialized from October 1847 to January 1850. This vast novel has been split into three, four, or five volumes at various points.
**In the three-volume edition, the novels are titled &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot;, &quot;Louise de la Vallière&quot; and &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot;.
**In the four-volume edition, the novels are titled &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot;, &quot;Ten Years Later&quot;, &quot;Louise de la Vallière&quot; and &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot;.
**The five-volume edition generally does not give titles to the smaller portions.

==Other connected books==
&quot;The Red Sphinx&quot; is a sequel to &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, written by Dumas but left incomplete after 75 chapters. It is a sequel in story terms, but none of the Musketeers appear; the story chiefly follows Cardinal Richelieu, Queen Anne, and King Louis XIII, and a new hero, the Count of Moret (based on the real-life Antoine de Moret). It was first published in France in 1946. A new English translation appeared in 2017 with a large chapter called &quot;Les Habitués de l’Hotel de Rambouillet&quot; omitted and left untranslated, in which the story was &quot;completed&quot; by the addition of Dumas&#x27;s novella &quot;The Dove&quot;.

==Unofficial sequels==
Several sequels have been written by other writers since Dumas&#x27;s death.

*&quot;The Son of Porthos&quot; (1883) — written by Paul Mahalin, but published under the pen name &quot;Alexandre Dumas&quot; and still sold as such. d&#x27;Artagnan does not appear in this book.
*&quot;D&#x27;Artagnan Kingmaker&quot; (1900) — supposedly based on one of Dumas&#x27;s plays.
*&quot;The King&#x27;s Passport&quot; (1925) — by H. Bedford-Jones.
*&quot;D&#x27;Artagnan, the sequel to the Three Musketeers&quot; (1928) — by H. Bedford-Jones.

==Other adaptations==
Fantasy novelist Steven Brust&#x27;s &quot;Khaavren Romances&quot; books have all used Dumas novels (particularly the &quot;d&#x27;Artagnan Romances&quot;) as their chief inspiration, recasting the plots of those novels to fit within Brust&#x27;s established world of Dragaera. His 2020 novel &quot;The Baron of Magister Valley&quot; follows suit, using &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; as a starting point.

Sarah Hoyt&#x27;s (nom de plume Sarah D&#x27;Almeida) &quot;Musketeers&quot; series begins with &quot;Death of a Musketeer&quot;, a Mystery Book Club selection, and includes four other titles from Berkley Prime Crime and Goldport Press.

<text>Stewart&#x27;s Fountain Classics is an American brand of premium soft drinks. Stewart&#x27;s are nostalgic &quot;old fashioned&quot; fountain sodas, having originated at the Stewart&#x27;s Restaurants, a chain of root beer stands started in 1924 by Frank Stewart in Mansfield, Ohio. In 1990, the bottling rights to Stewart&#x27;s were acquired by the Cable Car Beverage Corporation. Cream Soda and Ginger Beer flavors were introduced in 1992. Other flavors have been added since then. In November 1997 Cable Car Beverage Corporation was purchased by Triarc. Cadbury Schweppes PLC acquired the Stewart&#x27;s brands in 2000 along with Snapple and Mistic Brands for $1.45 billion.

Stewart&#x27;s drinks come in 12 fl. oz. (355 ml) glass bottles with twist-off tops. The bottles of some flavors are tinted amber, while the others are clear.

<doc id="310699" wikidata="Q1133893" url="?curid=310699" title="Yang di-Pertuan Negara">
<text>Yang di-Pertuan Negara (English: (he) who is Lord of the State) is a title for the head of state in certain Malay-speaking countries, and has been used as an official title at various times in Brunei and Singapore.

==Sabah==

The head of state of Sabah was once known as &quot;Yang Di-Pertua Negara&quot; and later known as &quot;Yang Di-Pertua Negeri&quot;.

==Sarawak==

The head of state of Sarawak was once known as &quot;Yang Di-Pertua Negara&quot; and later known as &quot;Yang Di-Pertua Negeri&quot;.

==Singapore==
===Background===
Following revisions to the Constitution in 1959, which granted Singapore self-governance from the United Kingdom, the ceremonial office of &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Negara&quot; replaced the colonial office of Governor as the representative of the British monarch in Singapore, though the term &#x27;governor&#x27; was also commonly used to refer to the office bearer.

Although the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Negara&quot; was the title for the head of state, constitutionally he is only a &quot;de jure&quot; chief executive, acting as a vice-regal representative in lieu of a typical Governor-General. 

Under a transitional arrangement, the last governor of Singapore, Sir William Goode, served as the first &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Negara&quot; from 3 June 1959 to 3 December 1959. He was succeeded by Yusof Ishak, who was sworn into office on the same day as the country&#x27;s state flag, coat of arms, and national anthem were adopted.

The title was retained on 31 August 1963 when Singapore declared independence from the United Kingdom and accession to Malaysia as a state on 16 September 1963 (not to be confused with the &quot;Yang di-Pertua Negeri&quot; of Sabah). The officeholder then acted as the vice-regal representative of the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot; of Malaysia.

On 9 August 1965, Singapore was separated from the federation to become an independent state within the Commonwealth of Nations. On 22 December of that year, the Constitution was amended to make the country a republic, and the title of Yang di-Pertuan Negara was changed to President with retroactive effect from the date of independence.

===List of officeholders===

==Brunei==
In Brunei, the Sultan of Brunei is also known as the &quot;Yang Di-Pertuan Negara Brunei Darussalam&quot;.

The full title for the head of state and head of government of Brunei is &quot;Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan dan Yang Di-Pertuan Negara Brunei Darussalam&quot;.

<text>Adria Airways [[List of legal entity types by country#Slovenia|d.o.o.]] (formerly &quot;Inex-Adria Aviopromet&quot; and later &quot;Inex-Adria Airways&quot;) was the flag carrier of Slovenia, operating scheduled and charter services to European destinations. The company&#x27;s head office was at Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport in Zgornji Brnik, Cerklje na Gorenjskem, near Ljubljana. On 30 September 2019, the airline declared bankruptcy and ceased all operations.

==History==
===1960s: Early years===

The airline was founded in March 1961 as Adria Aviopromet (Adria Airways). In August, the company purchased two DC-6B from KLM and flew their first commercial flight with a Dutch crew. At the same time, the first Adria crew and technical teams were trained by JAT Yugoslav Airlines and the air force. Adria carried out its first flight with a domestic crew in December 1961. At the same time all other activities necessary for the company were set up and organised, from the commercial to the accounting department.

During the following years, Adria gradually acquired a market with tourist flights from Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia to airports on the Adriatic coast. In 1964, flights to the United States and Canada were added in order to meet the needs of expatriate organisations. Adria also carried out a considerable number of flights for the United Nations.

With the opening of the new airport in Ljubljana in 1964, Adria relocated its base from its previous headquarters in Zagreb.

The DC-6B aircraft gradually became non-competitive on the market. The company fell into a serious crisis in 1967, which ended with a bankruptcy procedure at 1968. After a compulsory settlement, Adria continued its operations largely thanks to the efforts of the president of the Slovenian Chamber of the Commerce and Industry of the time.

In December 1968, Adria merged with the Serbian company InterExport based in Belgrade and changed its name from Adria Aviopromet to Inex-Adria Aviopromet (Inex-Adria Airways). The fleet renewal began.
===1970s: Jetliner introduction===
In 1969, the first jet aircraft was purchased, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 with 115 seats. Thus began a period of modernisation of the fleet, which allowed Adria to increase its share on the tourist flights market. In September 1969 the first scheduled service was established on the Ljubljana-Belgrade route. In March 1970, Adria had four Douglas DC-6B and a Douglas DC-9-30 with one more on order.
Business saw a considerable increase. Adria, in addition to expanding the number of its own aircraft, occasionally also leased aircraft (Sud Aviation Caravelle, Douglas DC-8, BAC One-Eleven).

In 1972, Adria renewed its transatlantic flights to the United States and Canada with Douglas DC-8-55 aircraft. However, it withdrew from that service next year.

In the late 1970s, Adria was awarded as most punctual carrier on the charter flight market. The greatest commercial successes of that period were achieved on the German market which was also the largest at that time, in a productive partnership with Grimex Company. The number of flights to Great Britain, France, Spain and Scandinavia also increased. During that period, Adria also introduced flights within Yugoslavia.

The company paid a great deal of attention to education. It founded a professional education centre and assisted in setting up an aviation course at the engineering faculty in Ljubljana. Special emphasis was given to the development of safety awareness, as three accidents occurred during the last decade.

===1980s: Modernisation===

Inex-Adria Aviopromet (Inex-Adria Airways) entered the 1980s as a respectable company with confirmed success on the tourist market and scheduled internal flights.
In May 1981, Adria purchased three new McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft. Unfortunately, one of them crashed into a mountain in Corsica in December, killing all aboard.

In 1982, Adria got a new leadership which focused on the education of the flight crews, technical staff and other professional personnel as well as on ensuring safety.

In that period, the business remained focused on charter flights to the Adriatic. Flights for guest workers in Germany and Switzerland, which were connected to internal flights, became an important part of the business. At the end of 1984, the first scheduled international flights were also established on the Ljubljana–Belgrade–Larnaca route.

Prospects for the development of air traffic were very good, so in 1984, Adria signed a contract for the purchase of five Airbus A320 aircraft. Also two new Dash 7 aircraft were bought for the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo.
In December 1985, Adria had four McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30, two McDonnell Douglas DC-9-50, one McDonnell Douglas MD-81, three McDonnell Douglas MD-82 and two de Havilland Canada Dash 7 aircraft. A year later another MD-82 joined the fleet.

Due to a commercial law restructuring programme, in 1986, Adria left the Inex group, becoming an independent company and changing its name to Adria Airways. Later, Adria became a member of IATA.

In 1989, the first new Airbus A320 arrived. It was 43rd A320 made by the Airbus and the first one to be powered by the new IAE Engines.

===1990s: Becoming a scheduled airline===
As Yugoslavia began to break up, the tourist industry on the Adriatic slumped, which was also felt by air carriers.

In 1991, Adria had 13 aircraft: three Airbus A320s (two were delivered in September 1990), four MD-82s, one MD-81, three DC-9-30s and two Dash 7s. Two A320s, expected to arrive in June 1991, were sold to other airlines.

Flights began in 1992, when Adria Airways re-established its activities on a truncated market. The majority of charter destinations from Western Europe to the Adriatic coast had become inaccessible as they were now situated on the territory of other countries. The fleet was too big, so many aircraft were leased out across the globe.

Adria Airways became Slovenia&#x27;s national air carrier and its operational structure changed. From being largely a charter airline it transformed itself into a scheduled operator. Adria began to set up a network of scheduled flights around Europe to serve the needs of an independent Slovenia. Later in 1992, the company joined the Amadeus global travel distribution system. A period of restructuring and rehabilitation of the company began.

In the next years, Adria&#x27;s A320s were mainly leased out, as well as MD-82s. An MD-81 and an MD-82 were sold in 1994. The other three MD-82 and a DC-9-30 were sold at the end of 1995. As part of an ownership restructuring, in February 1996, the Government of Slovenia obtained a 100% share in the company.

In 1996, in line with the administration&#x27;s rescue programme, a rehabilitation procedure was started the aim of which was to enable the company to run on market principles. The main emphasis was on the rationalization and modernization of the operations and the adaptation of the fleet to market requirements. The number of employees has been reduced from 931 to 618. In 1996, the fleet consisted of three Airbus A320 with 168 seats (at least two were leased out most of the time), two DC-9-30 with 105 seats and two Dash-7 with 46 seats. Adria started a corporation with Lufthansa later in 1996.

In April 1997, Adria ordered two new Bombardier CRJ200LR planes with an option for one more. Planes were delivered in 1998 when two Dash-7 and two DC-9-30 left the fleet. Another CRJ200LR arrived in late 1998. Bombardier CRJ200LR were chosen as the best option for flights operated from Ljubljana, which allowed for more flights to be flown directly and more frequent. CRJ200LR are in 48 seats configuration which give space for a larger baggage compartment needed for charters. In 1999, Adria&#x27;s fleet consisted of three Airbus A320, which were now operating back home, and three CRJ200LR.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the airline head office was in Ljubljana.

===2000s: Getting on the new markets===

Adria started to connect Balkan cities with Western Europe via its hub Ljubljana in the late 1990s. Cities like Sarajevo, Skopje, Ohrid, Tirana were connected with Scandinavia, United Kingdom, Germany and France. After the Kosovo War ended in 1999, Adria was the first airline fly to Pristina in the winter period of 1999. In March 2000, the 4th new 48 seats Bombardier CRJ200LR arrived.

Maribor, the second largest city in Slovenia was connected with Munich for a short period of time in the summer of 2000. There were 5 weekly flights around noon.

In 2001, Adria Airways recorded a large decrease in the number of annual passengers as a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks. In the winter of 2001, Adria started flying in the EU market, starting with the Vienna-Frankfurt route. In July 2002, Bombardier Aerospace selected Adria as the first authorised heavy maintenance facility for CRJ aircraft in Europe.

In the spring of 2003, Adria leased a Bombardier CRJ100LR with 50 seats from Bombardier; the lease lasted until January 2011. In August 2004, Adria was among the first airlines in the world to obtain an IOSA certificate. The 6th Bombardier CRJ200LR with 50 seats was leased from GECAS. On 18 November 2004, Adria Airways joined the Star Alliance.

In 2005, 7th brand new CRJ200LR with 50 seats was delivered to Adria. Adria ended with a loss of around €10 million and a new CEO was announced later in 2005. Tadej Tufek became the new CEO in 2006. Two Boeing 737-500 (112 seats) aircraft were leased from Ukraine International Airlines and Cirrus Airlines to fill the gap between the A320 (162 seats) and CRJ200 (48/50 seats). An A320 was leased to Afriqiyah Airways until late 2009 while another joined Afriqiyah in the winter of 2006 until the summer of 2008. In 2006, the company recorded a minimal profit and transported its first annual millionth passenger since the late 1980s.

In 2007, Adria ordered two Bombardier CRJ900 which were delivered in May. During the summer the fleet consisted of an Airbus A320 (162 seats), a Boeing 737-500 (112 seats) leased from Ukraine International Airlines, two Bombardier CRJ900LR (86 seats) and seven Bombardier CRJ200LR (48/50 seats) aircraft. In November 2007 Adria announced the purchase a new CRJ1000 NextGen and two new CRJ900 NextGen aircraft. Adria ended the year with a small profit.

In 2008, Adria converted its CRJ1000 NextGen order into a 5th CRJ900 and made a loss of €3 million again.

In March 2009, Adria Airways has signed a letter of intent with Airbus to purchase a new Airbus A319 aircraft. The management board planned to replace Airbus A320 fleet with new Airbus A319 aircraft. The seating configuration of the aircraft allows for 135 seats, which is economically efficient for the type of service operated by Adria Airways. Two Airbus A320 were sold to Myanmar Airways International in 2009, S5-AAC in October and S5-AAB in December. In November 2009 new headquarters at Ljubljana Airport were opened. A loss of €14 million was made in 2009.

===2010s: Solving the crisis===

Adria started a new decade with a huge accumulated loss. However, the future looked bright as two brand new Airbus A319s were planned to arrive in April 2010. In March 2010, Adria added Belgrade to its schedule, which was last operated prior to the disintegration of Yugoslavia. In April 2010, all operations were moved to Maribor, as Ljubljana airport was having its runway renovated. Later that month, Adria like many other airlines in Europe, was grounded due to the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland.

Adria took delivery of two new Airbus A319s with a slight delay due to the volcanic eruption in April/May 2010.

In June 2010, as a part of reorganisation of the company, Adria Tehnika and Adria Flight School were created as separate companies.

New flights to Banja Luka started in July, which were operated in co-operation with Sky Srpska. Flights ended a year later. Later that month, flights to Marseille were started, offering Turkish truck drivers a connection from Istanbul via Ljubljana. These flights were cancelled at the end of 2011. In the summer of 2010 Adria&#x27;s fleet consisted of an Airbus A320 (162 seats), two Airbus A319s (135 seats), four Bombardier CRJ900LR (86 seats) and seven Bombardier CRJ200LR (48/50 seats) aircraft. On 11 September 2010, Airbus A320-231 (S5-AAA), was retired and is stored at Ljubljana Airport. With the beginning of the winter timetable, flights from Marseille were moved to Toulon. From 10 December 2010, Adria started serving new routes from Pristina, Kosovo. Destinations during the winter were Düsseldorf, Frankfurt and Munich. During summer, Brussels, Copenhagen and Paris were added to those started in the winter season.

On 14 January 2011, CEO Tadej Tufek and Executive Director Marjan Ravnikar resigned because of bad results in their last years of leadership. Klemen Boštjančič became the new CEO, and a new executive director, Robert Vuga, was named. Adria sold its shares in Adria Tehnika to Ljubljana Airport and the Government to cover part of the loss.

In February 2011, CRJ100LR (S5-AAH) was retired and returned in August 2011 to Bombardier Capital. In March 2011, Adria celebrated its 50th anniversary. An exhibition in The National Museum of Contemporary History was made showing the history of Slovenian national carrier. As a part of immediate actions by the new management, two new Airbus aircraft were leased. An Airbus A320-231 (S5-AAS, ex EI-DOD) is leased from April 2011 for 3.5 years. It has 180 seats and is mostly operated on charter flights. At June, a second Airbus A320-211 (S5-AAT, ex CS-TNB) was supposed to be leased for 18 months but it was stored in October. It wore Adria retro colours from the 1960s. On 26 January 2012, S5-AAT was returned to the lessor GOAL which sold the aircraft.

In summer 2011, Adria operated with two Airbus A320s (180/162 seats), two Airbus A319s (135 seats), four Bombardier CRJ900 (86 seats) and 6 Bombardier CRJ200LR (50/48 seats). The 3rd Airbus A320 (S5-AAA) was still owned by Adria, but wasn&#x27;t operational and was stored at Ljubljana airport.

A total loss of €63,073,630 was made in 2010. The majority of the loss was due to a revaluation of the fleet, which showed a decrease of €45,443,441 mainly because of poor market value for the CRJ200LR. Due to revaluation and accumulated losses, a financial restructuring plan was made in August. It involved the Government of Slovenia and the banks from which Adria had taken loans in the past years. According to the plan, the Government would invest €50 million and the banks would convert 25%-50% of the loans into equity. On 21 September 2011, Adria finalised the deal with the banks and the government. Together Adria got €69,720,983– €50 million from the government, and the rest as converted through the loans-to-equity swap.

With the beginning of Winter 2011/12 timetable, Adria dropped flights to Banja Luka, London, Paris, Toulon and Warsaw. The Vienna-Frankfurt route was also cancelled.

For the 2012 summer season, Adria returned to three seasonal destinations: Barcelona, London Luton and Manchester.

In August 2012, Ljubljana Airport reported that it had a new airline to operate on a London-Luton route, and therefore Adria removed it from the winter and summer 2013 timetable.

On 24 September 2012, a leased Bombardier CRJ200LR registered S5-AAI was returned to lessor GECAS. Adria now operates five owned CRJ200LR planes and two owned CRJ900LR, two leased CRJ900LR (next gen) planes and two leased Airbus A319s along with a bigger leased Airbus A320 for a total of 12 planes.

For the 2012–13 winter season, the company operated nearly the same frequencies as in the last winter season and served the same destinations. The operational fleet was four CRJ900 and four CRJ200LR. The Airbus fleet operated on charters and would be leased out while the remaining CRJ200LR would be used on ad hoc charters (sport clubs, business/corporate, etc.) and as a back-up.

In spring of 2014, Adria began operating from Frankfurt to Tirana, Albania.

In summer of 2015, Adria began operating from Maribor to London Southend Airport, England. However, flights were terminated by the end of the season.

===2016: Privatization of Adria Airways===
In March 2016, 4K Invest, a Luxembourg-based restructuring fund, acquired 96% of Adria Airways&#x27; shares from the Slovene state. The new owner appointed Arno Schuster as the CEO of Adria.

On 1 July 2017, Adria suspended its base in the Polish city of Łódź, from which it held flights with its stationed CRJ700 aircraft, registered S5-AAZ, for the previous three years. During this time, Adria had also opened two other bases in Poland, one in Rzeszów and one in Olsztyn; however, both were terminated fairly quickly. Adria is now set to focus more on its main hub on Ljubljana Airport, which has already seen a boost in the frequencies of flights to a couple of destinations served by Adria. These destinations include Amsterdam, Podgorica, Pristina, Sarajevo and Skopje.

On 20 July 2017, Adria announced the purchase of Darwin Airline, which operated flights as Etihad Regional and was owned by Etihad Airways. The airline marketed itself as Adria Airways Switzerland, but continued its operations as Darwin Airline with the existing air operator&#x27;s certificate (AOC). Adria was responsible for the marketing and some administrative and operational tasks. However, this did not directly impact the airline&#x27;s operations as a whole, as the two bases remained in Geneva and Lugano.

In September 2017, it was revealed that Adria sold its brand for 8 million Euros to an undisclosed buyer in December of the previous year.

In November 2017, Adria announced new flights from the Swiss city of Bern, which came as a result of SkyWork Airlines, previously the largest operator out of Belp Airport, losing its AOC. The flights to Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Vienna were set to begin on 6 November 2017, and were to be operated by the subsidiary Adria Airways Switzerland, however these plans were cancelled only days after the announcement, as SkyWork managed to regain its AOC.

In recent years, Adria has focused on ad hoc flights, which are mainly operated for large automotive companies, such as Ford, Chrysler and Ferrari.

On 12 December 2017, Adria&#x27;s Swiss subsidiary Darwin Airline, which operated as &quot;Adria Airways Switzerland&quot;, was declared bankrupt and its AOC was revoked. The airline ended all operations.

===2019: Final years===
In January 2019, Adria Airways announced it would shut down its short-lived focus city operations at Paderborn Lippstadt Airport in Germany which consisted of three routes to London (which had already ceased in late 2018), Vienna and Zürich. At the same time, major cuts to the route network from the airline&#x27;s home base in Ljubljana were announced, with all services to Brač, Bucharest, Dubrovnik, Düsseldorf, Geneva, Hamburg, Kyiv, Moscow and Warsaw being terminated.

On 20 September 2019, it was made public that two of the airline&#x27;s Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft had been repossessed by their lessors over unpaid bills.

On 23 September 2019, Adria Airways announced on its web site that it would temporarily suspend flight operations for two days because it lacked the liquidity needed to maintain scheduled operations. The suspension was extended for two more days on 25 September. On the same day, it emerged that several of the carrier&#x27;s aircraft had been repossessed by lessors due to non-payment of leasing contracts. On 26 September, the airline announced it would continue to operate flights between Ljubljana and Frankfurt. In a third delay announcement, on 27 September, the company said that it would continue to suspend service to all destinations except Frankfurt until the afternoon of Monday the 30th. Also on the 27 September, all three of the airline&#x27;s Airbus A319-100s had been repossessed by their lessors.

On 30 September 2019, Adria Airways announced that it had officially filed for bankruptcy, ending 58 years of service. Accordingly, the company said that it would cancel all scheduled flights due to the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Slovenia&#x27;s economic development minister Zdravko Počivalšek said that an option to set up a new airline within a few months in order to maintain important air links was being studied.

===2020: Asset auction===

On 23 January 2020, Adria Airways assets were auctioned. The winner was Izet Rastoder, a Montenegrin businessman that is known as the largest banana importer in Europe. His winning bid was 45,000 Euros.

==Corporate affairs and identity==

===Headquarters===

Adria&#x27;s corporate headquarters were located on the grounds of Ljubljana Airport in Zgornji Brnik, Cerklje na Gorenjskem, Slovenia, near Ljubljana. In 2008 the first stone to the new Adria headquarters was laid. In November 2009 Adria moved in around 300 employees and all of its departments. The previous building, in the city of Ljubljana, was built in the 1980s. In the 1970s, Inex-Adria had its headquarters on the Ljubljana airport property like it did at the end of its operations.

===Brand history===
The Adria Airways visual identity was created in the late 1980s. The tail mark symbolized a linden tree leaf, a national symbol of Slovenia.

===Financial and operational results===
===Subsidiaries===
In addition to its main operation, Adria had several subsidiaries, including:
* Adria Airways Tehnika (not owned)
* Adria Flight Career Centre
* Amadeus Slovenia
* Adria Airways Kosovo

==== Adria Airways Tehnika ====
Adria Airways Tehnika is a maintenance organization based at Ljubljana Airport. It is the line and base maintenance provider for Adria Airways also base maintenance is provided to Air Berlin, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, Air Méditerranée, Brit Air and many others. Before September 2002 sporadic third party maintenance was provided for some aircraft at the site. It was the first recognized service facility for the CRJ100/200/700/900 in Europe. In mid-2005 a partnership was formed with Air France Industries to perform A &amp; C checks on aircraft of the A320 family. In 2010 Adria Airways Tehnika was established as a separate company, employing around 250 employees. With two hangars they can serve from two to five aircraft depending on their size. In 2015 Adria Airways Tehnika was privatized and sold to Czech-Polish Avia Prime Group, owner of Polish Linetech, and Serbian Jat Tehnika Maintenance Organisations. The name of the company was then rebranded to Adria Tehnika.

==== Adria Airways Switzerland ====
Adria Airways Switzerland was the marketing name of Darwin Airline, which operated all of its flights, and was a Swiss subsidiary of Adria Airways. It was owned by Etihad Airways and branded as Etihad Regional, with bases at Geneva and Lugano in Switzerland. All flights by this unit ceased operations on 12 December 2017.

==Destinations==
As of Summer 2017, Adria Airways operated a main hub at Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport, as well as the secondary hub at Pristina International Airport Adem Jashari and Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza. The majority of Adria Airways&#x27; business was in scheduled flights, but it also provided charter and ad hoc flights. As of July 2017, Adria operated to 24 scheduled and 22 charter destinations throughout Europe. Most of the flights were operated out of Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport, the airline&#x27;s primary hub, but it also operates both scheduled and charter flights out of Pristina Airport and Tirana Airport. It had been a Star Alliance member since 2004 and a Lufthansa partner since 1996. The airline&#x27;s scheduled charter flights were for the most part seasonal, and most frequently to holiday destinations in the Mediterranean region. Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada in Egypt were served all year round to a schedule.

<text>Dominical letters or Sunday letters are a method used to determine the day of the week for particular dates. When using this method, each year is assigned a letter (or pair of letters for leap years) depending on which day of the week the year starts with. The Dominical letter for the current year 2025 is E.

Dominical letters are derived from the Roman practice of marking the repeating sequence of eight letters A–H (commencing with A on January 1) on stone calendars to indicate each day&#x27;s position in the eight-day market week (&quot;nundinae&quot;). The word is derived from the number nine due to their practice of inclusive counting. After the introduction of Christianity a similar sequence of seven letters A–G was added alongside, again commencing with January 1. The dominical letter marks the Sundays. Nowadays they are used primarily as part of the computus, which is the method of calculating the date of Easter.

A common year is assigned a single dominical letter, indicating which lettered days are Sundays in that particular year (hence the name, from Latin &quot;dominica&quot; for Sunday). Thus, 2025 will be E, indicating that all E days will be Sunday, and by inference, January 5, 2025, will be a Sunday. Leap years are given two letters, the first valid for January 1 – February 28 (or February 24, see below), the second for the remainder of the year.

In leap years, the leap day may or may not have a letter. In the Catholic version it does, but in the 1662 and subsequent Anglican versions it does not. The Catholic version causes February to have 29 days by doubling the sixth day before March 1, inclusive, thus both halves of the doubled day have a dominical letter of F. The Anglican version adds a day to February that did not exist in common years, February 29, thus it does not have a dominical letter of its own. After the 1662 reform there was correspondence between the Archbishop of Canterbury and the printer of the Book of Common Prayer, in which it was explained that the feast day of St Matthias now fell on February 24 every year.

In either case, all other dates have the same dominical letter every year, but the days of the dominical letters change within a leap year before and after the intercalary day, February 24 or February 29.

== History and arrangement ==
According to dominical letters are:

Another one is &quot;Add G, beg C, fad F,&quot; and yet another is &quot;At Dover dwell George Brown, Esquire; Good Christopher Finch; and David Fryer.&quot;

== Dominical letter cycle ==

 continues: 

Of course, &quot;24 February&quot; is not &quot;counted twice&quot;. The 23rd is &quot;ante diem vii kalendas Martias&quot;, the next day in a leap year is &quot;a.d. bis sextum kal. Mart.&quot;, the next day is the regular &quot;a.d.vi kal. Mart.&quot;, and so to the end of the month. For example, in 2024 (=GF), all days preceding the leap day corresponded to a common-year G calendar, and all days afterward corresponded to a common-year F calendar. The same thing will happen in 2028 (=BA), for example all days preceding the leap day will correspond to a common-year B calendar, and all days afterward will correspond to a common-year A calendar. The relevant line of the &quot;Februarius&quot; page in the &quot;Kalendarium&quot; of a 1913 &quot;Breviarium Romanum&quot; reads:
:5 |f|vj|24|S. MATHIAE APOSTOLI, dupl. 2. class.
The first column is the epact, a replacement for the golden number, from which the age of the moon was computed and announced in some English cathedrals prior to the Reformation. The second column is the letter, the third the Roman date and the fourth the modern date. A note at the foot of the page reads:
In anno bissextili mensis Februarius est dierum 29. et Festum S. Mathiae celebratur die 25. Februarii et bis dicitur sexto Kalendas, id est die 24. et die 25. et littera Dominicalis, quae assumpta fuit in mense Januario, mutatur in praecedentem; ut si in Januario littera Dominicalis fuerit A, mutatur in praecedentem, quae est g. etc.; et littera f bis servit, 24. et 25. 
(In a bissextile year the month February is of 29 days and the Feast of St. Matthias is celebrated on 25 February, and twice is said on the sixth Kalends, that is on the 24th and 25th, and the Sunday letter, which was assumed in the month of January, is changed to the preceding; so if in January the Sunday letter may have been A, it is changed to the preceding, which is G. etc.; and letter F twice serves, 24th and 25th.)
==Dominical letters of the years==
The dominical letter of a year provides the link between the date and the day of the week on which it falls. The following are the correspondences between dominical letters and the day of the week on which their corresponding years is day and date:
* A: common year starting on Sunday
* B: common year starting on Saturday
* C: common year starting on Friday
* D: common year starting on Thursday
* E: common year starting on Wednesday
* F: common year starting on Tuesday
* G: common year starting on Monday
* AG: leap year starting on Sunday
* BA: leap year starting on Saturday
* CB: leap year starting on Friday
* DC: leap year starting on Thursday
* ED: leap year starting on Wednesday
* FE: leap year starting on Tuesday
* GF: leap year starting on Monday
The Gregorian calendar repeats every 400 years (i. e., every four centuries). Of the 400 years in one Gregorian cycle, there are:
* 44 common years for each single Dominical letter D and F;
* 43 common years for each single Dominical letter A, B, C, E, and G;
* 15 leap years for each double Dominical letter AG and CB;
* 14 leap years for each double Dominical letter ED and FE;
* 13 leap years for each double Dominical letter BA, DC, and GF.
Thus 58 out of 400 years begin as A, C, or F, while 57 begin as D or E and 56 begin as B or G. The end of a year preceding a given year has the next letter (meaning A years are preceded by years ending as B), so 58 of 400 years end as B, D or G, whereas 57 end as E or F and 56 end as C or A. This means, for example, that Christmas falls on a Saturday or Monday (C and A years, resp.) 56 times and Wednesday or Thursday (F and E years, resp.) 57 times, whereas they fall on Friday, Sunday or Tuesday (D, B and G years, resp.) 58 times in the span of four centuries.

The Julian calendar repeats every 28 years. Of the 28 years in one Julian cycle, there are:
* 3 common years for each single Dominical letter A, B, C, D, E, F, and G;
* 1 leap year for each double Dominical letter BA, CB, DC, ED, FE, GF, and AG.

==Calculation==

The dominical letter of a year can be calculated based on any method for calculating the day of the week, with letters in reverse order compared to numbers indicating the day of the week.

For example:
*ignore periods of 400 years
*considering the second letter in the case of a leap year:
**for one century within two multiples of 400, go forward two letters from BA for 2000, hence C, E, G.
**for remaining years, go back one letter every year, two for leap years (this corresponds to writing two letters, no letter is skipped).
**to avoid up to 99 steps within a century, the table below can be used.

Red for the first two months of leap years.

For example, to find the Dominical Letter of the year 1913:

*1900 is G and 13 corresponds to 5
*G + 5 = G − 2 = E, 1913 is E

Similarly, for 2007:
*2000 is BA and 7 corresponds to 6
*A + 6 = A − 1 = G, 2007 is G

For 2065:
*2000 is BA and 65 mod 28 = 9 corresponds to 3
*A + 3 = A − 4 = D, 2065 is D

===The odd plus 11 method===
A simpler method suitable for finding the year&#x27;s dominical letter was discovered in 2010. It is called the &quot;odd plus 11&quot; method.

The procedure accumulates a running total &quot;T&quot; as follows:
# Let &quot;T&quot; be the year&#x27;s last two digits.
#If &quot;T&quot; is odd, add 11. 
#Let &quot;T&quot; = .
#If &quot;T&quot; is odd, add 11.
#Let &quot;T&quot; = &quot;T&quot; mod 7.
#Count forward &quot;T&quot; letters from the century&#x27;s dominical letter (A, C, E or G see above) to get the year&#x27;s dominical letter.

The formula is
:formula_1

===De Morgan&#x27;s rule===
This rule was stated by Augustus De Morgan:
#Add 1 to the given year. 
#Take the quotient found by dividing the given year by 4 (neglecting the remainder). 
#Take 16 from the centurial figures of the given year if that can be done. 
#Take the quotient of III divided by 4 (neglecting the remainder). 
#From the sum of I, II and IV, subtract III. 
#Find the remainder of V divided by 7: this is the number of the Dominical Letter, supposing A, B, C, D, E, F, G to be equivalent respectively to 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.
So the formulae (using the floor function) for the Gregorian calendar is 
:formula_2
It is equivalent to
:formula_3
and
:formula_4     (where formula_5 = last two digits of the year, formula_6 = century part of the year).
For example, to find the Dominical Letter of the year 1913: 
:1. (1 + 1913 + 478 + 0 − 3) mod 7 = 2
:2. (1913 + 478 + 4 − 19 − 1) mod 7 = 2
:3. (13 + 3 + 15 -1) mod 7 = 2

:Hence, the Dominical Letter is E in the Gregorian calendar.

De Morgan&#x27;s rules no. 1 and 2 for the Julian calendar:

:formula_7 and formula_8

To find the Dominical Letter of the year 1913 in the Julian calendar:

:*(1913 + 478 − 3) mod 7 = 1

:Hence, the Dominical Letter is F in the Julian calendar.

In leap years the formulae above give the Dominical Letter for the last ten months of the year. To find the Dominical Letter for the first two months of the year to the leap day (inclusive) subtract 1 from the calculated number representing the original Dominical Letter; if the new number is less than 0, it must be changed to 6.

===Dominical letter in relation to the Doomsday Rule===

The &quot;doomsday&quot; concept in the doomsday algorithm is mathematically related to the Dominical letter. Because the letter of a date equals the dominical letter of a year (DL) plus the day of the week (DW), and the letter for the doomsday is C except for the portion of leap years before February 29 in which it is D, we have:
:formula_9
Note: G = 0 = Sunday, A = 1 = Monday, B = 2 = Tuesday, C = 3 = Wednesday, D = 4 = Thursday, E = 5 = Friday, and F = 6 = Saturday, i.e. in our context, C is mathematically identical to 3.

Hence, for instance, the doomsday of the year 2013 is Thursday, so DL = (3–4) mod 7 = 6 = F. The dominical letter of the year 1913 is E, so DW = (3–5) mod 7 = 5 = Friday.

===All in one table===
If the year of interest is not within the table, use a tabular year which gives the same remainder when divided by 400 (Gregorian calendar) or 700 (Julian calendar). In the case of the Revised Julian calendar, find the date of Easter Sunday (see the section &quot;Calculating Easter Sunday&quot;, subsection &quot;Revised Julian calendar&quot; below) and enter it into the &quot;Table of letters for the days of the year&quot; below. If the year is a leap year, the dominical letter for January and February is found by inputting the date of Easter Monday. Note the different rules for leap years:
*Gregorian calendar: every year which divides exactly by 4, but of century years only those which divide exactly by 400; therefore ignore the left-hand letter given for a century year which is not a leap year.
*Julian calendar: every year which divides exactly by 4.
*Revised Julian calendar: every year which divides exactly by 4, but of century years only those which give the remainder 200 or 600 when divided by 900.

===Years with special dominical letters===
When a country switched to the Gregorian calendar, there could be some unusual combinations of dominical letters.
==== Some examples ====
* 1582: Many Catholic countries switched to the Gregorian calendar Friday October 15. The table above indicates that year 1582 had the dominical letter G in the Julian calendar and C in the Gregorian one. So the dominical letters for 1582 in these Catholic countries became GC for mixing the two calendars used in this legal year, a special combination not seen before and after with a single calendar used in the same legal year.
* 1712: Sweden had a February 30 in 1712, and the Julian calendar dominical letters FE and in the Gregorian one dominical letters CB, but in Sweden started as GF, so the dominical letters for 1712 in Sweden were GE, a very special combination which also only applies to this legal year.
* 1752: The British Empire and its colonies switched to the Gregorian calendar Thursday September 14. 1752, a leap year, had in the Julian calendar dominical letters ED and in the Gregorian one dominical letters BA, so the dominical letters for 1752 in Britain were EDA, a very special combination which also only applies to this legal year.

== Calculating Easter Sunday ==

Enter the &quot;all in one table&quot; to find the date of the paschal full moon, then use the &quot;week table&quot; below to find the day of the week on which it falls. Easter is the following Sunday.

=== Week table: Julian and Gregorian calendars for AD years since March 1 AD 4 ===

Note that this table does not work for AD years at the early stage of the real Julian calendar before March 1 AD 4 or for any BC year, except when using the Julian calendar rules for proleptic dates (which are different from effective historic dates, whose effective calendar in use depended on the location of dated events or the location of the person using the calendar, sometimes differently between political/civil or religious purposes in places where both calendars still coexisted). The duration of months, and the number and placement of intercalated days also changed inconsistently before AD 42 in the early local Julian calendars which used native names for the months, depending on places and years, causing finally a lot of confusion in the population (so dating events precisely in that period is often difficult, unless they are correlated with observed lunar cycles, or with days of the week, or with another calendar).

In these early AD years and in all BC years, with the effective Julian calendars used locally to align the counting of years (but still with the tradition inherited from the earlier Roman calendar for noting days in each year), a variable number of days at end of the months (after the last day of its &quot;ides&quot; but before the last day of &quot;calends&quot; which started the next month) were also still counted relatively from the start of the next named month (on the last day of its &quot;calends&quot;), and years were theoretically starting on March 1 (but with the last days of the year in February also counted from the New Year&#x27;s Day in March). As well, all these early years were effectively counted inclusively and positively from a different, much earlier epoch in other eras, such as the supposed foundation of Rome, or the accession to power of a local ruler (and still not relatively to the &quot;supposed&quot; date of birth of Christ, which was fixed later arbitrarily by a Christian reform for the modern Julian calendar so that this epoch for the Christian era starts now on January 1 in &quot;proleptic&quot; year AD 1 of the modern Julian calendar, but the real date of birth of Christ is still not known precisely but certainly falls before, somewhere in the last few BC years).

Instructions

For Julian dates before 1300 and after 1999 the year in the table which differs by an exact multiple of 700 years should be used. For Gregorian dates after 2299, the year in the table which differs by an exact multiple of 400 years should be used. The values &quot;&quot; through &quot;&quot; indicate the remainder when the Hundreds value is divided by 7 (Julian) or 4 (Gregorian), indicating how the series extend in either direction. Both Julian and Gregorian values are shown for years 1500–1999 / 1500–2200 for convenience.

The corresponding numbers in the far right hand column on the same line as each component of the date (the hundreds, remaining digits and month) are added, then the day of the month. This total is divided by 7 and the remainder from this division located in the far right hand column. The day of the week is beside it. Bold figures (e.g., 04) denote leap year. If a year ends in 00 and its hundreds are in bold, it is a leap year. Thus 19 indicates that 1900 is not a Gregorian leap year, (but bold 19 in the Julian column indicates that it &quot;is&quot; a Julian leap year, as are all Julian &quot;x&quot;00 years). 20 indicates that 2000 is a leap year. Use bold Jan and Feb only in leap years.

For determination of the day of the week (January 1, 2000, Saturday)
*the day of the month: 1
*the month: 6
*the year: 0
*the century mod 4 for the Gregorian calendar and mod 7 for the Julian calendar 0
*adding . Dividing by 7 leaves a remainder of 0, so the day of the week is Saturday.

=== Revised Julian calendar ===

* Use the Julian portion of the table of paschal full moons. Use the &quot;week table&quot; (remembering to use the &quot;Julian&quot; side) to find the day of the week on which the paschal full moon falls. Easter is the following Sunday and it is a Julian date. Call this date &quot;JD&quot;. 
* Subtract 100 from the year.
* Divide the result by 100. Call the number obtained (omitting fractions) &quot;N&quot;.
* Evaluate . Call the result (omitting fractions) &quot;S&quot;.
* The Revised Julian calendar date of Easter is .

Example. What is the date of Easter in 2017?

. . Golden number is 4. Date of paschal full moon is April 2 (Julian). From &quot;week table&quot; April 2, 2017 (Julian) is Saturday. . . . . . . . Easter Sunday in the Revised Julian calendar is .

=== Calculate the day of the week in the Revised Julian calendar ===

Note that the date (and hence the day of the week) in the Revised Julian and Gregorian calendars is the same up until February 28, 2800, and that for large years it may be possible to subtract 6300 or a multiple thereof before starting so as to reach a year within or closer to the table.

To look up the weekday of any date for any year using the table, subtract 100 from the year, divide the number obtained by 100, multiply the resulting quotient (omitting fractions) by seven and divide the product by nine. Note the quotient (omitting fractions). Enter the table with the Julian year, and just before the final division add 50 and subtract the quotient noted above.

Example: What is the day of the week of 27 January 8315?

, , , , . 2015 is 700 years ahead of 1315, so 1315 is used. From the table: for hundreds (13): 6. For remaining digits (15): 4. For month (January): 0. For date (27): 27. . . Day of week = Tuesday.

===Dominical letter===
To find the dominical letter, calculate the day of the week for either January 1 or October 1. If it is Sunday, the Sunday Letter is A, if Saturday B, and similarly backward through the week and forward through the alphabet to Monday, which is G.

Leap years have two letters, so for January and February calculate the day of the week for January 1 and for March to December calculate the day of the week for October 1.

Leap years are all years that divide exactly by four, with the following exceptions:

Gregorian calendar – all years divisible by 100, except those that divide exactly by 400.

Revised Julian calendar – all years divisible by 100, except those with a remainder of 200 or 600 when divided by 900.

==Clerical utility==

The dominical letter had another practical utility in the period prior to the annual printing of the &quot;Ordo divini officii recitandi&quot;, in which period, therefore, Christian clergy were often required to determine the &quot;Ordo&quot; independently. Easter Sunday may be as early as March 22 or as late as April 25, and consequently there are 35 possible days on which it may occur; each dominical letter includes 5 potential dates of these 35, and thus there are 5 possible ecclesiastical calendars for each letter. The Pye or Directorium which preceded the present &quot;Ordo&quot; took advantage of this principle by delineating all 35 possible calendars and denoting them by the formula &quot;primum A&quot;, &quot;secundum A&quot;, &quot;tertium A&quot;, et cetera. Hence, based on the dominical letter of the year and the epact, the Pye identified the correct calendar to use. A similar table, adapted to the reformed calendar and in more convenient form, is included in the beginning of every breviary and missal under the heading &quot;Tabula Paschalis nova reformata&quot;.

Saint Bede does not seem to have been familiar with dominical letters, given his &quot;De temporum ratione&quot;; in its place he adopted a similar device of Greek origin consisting of seven numbers, which he denominated &quot;concurrentes&quot; (&quot;De Temp. Rat.&quot;, Chapter LIII). The &quot;concurrents&quot; are numbers that denote the days of the week on which March 24 occurs in the successive years of the solar cycle, 1 denoting Sunday, 2 (&quot;feria secunda&quot;) for Monday, 3 for Tuesday, et cetera; these correspond to dominical letters F, E, D, C, B, A, and G, respectively.

==Use for computer calculation==
Computers are able to calculate the Dominical letter for the first day of a given month in this way (function in C), where:

* m = month
* y = year
* s = &quot;style&quot;; 0 for Julian, otherwise Gregorian.
char dominical(int m, int y, int s) {
 int leap = y % 4 == 0 &amp;&amp; (s == 0 || y % 100 != 0 || y % 400 == 0),
 a = (y % 100) % 28,
 b = (s == 0) * ( (y%700)/100 + a/4 * 2 + 4 + ((a%4+1)*!leap + (m+9)/12*leap) * 6 ) % 7
 + (s != 0) * ( ((y%400)/100 + a/4 + 1) * 2 + ((a%4+1)*!leap + (m+9)/12*leap) * 6 ) % 7;
 b += (b == 0) * 7;
 return (char)(b + 64);


Years are also given a dominical letter or pair of dominical letters according to the first day in January and last day in December: when they are equal, only the first letter is given. The dominical letter of the last day of December just precedes in the ordered cycle (G,F,E,D,C,B,A), the dominical letter of the first day in January for the next year.

<text>Carolyn Merchant (born July 12, 1936 in Rochester, New York) is an American ecofeminist philosopher and historian of science most famous for her theory (and book of the same title) on &quot;The Death of Nature&quot;, whereby she identifies the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century as the period when science began to atomize, objectify, and dissect nature, foretelling its eventual conception as composed of inert atomic particles. Her works are important in the development of environmental history and the history of science. She is Distinguished Professor Emerita of Environmental History, Philosophy, and Ethics at UC Berkeley.

== Education and career ==
In 1954, as a high school senior, Merchant was among the Top Ten Finalists for the Westinghouse Science Talent Search. She received her A.B. in Chemistry from Vassar College in 1958.

She then went to the University of Wisconsin–Madison to earn an M.A. and Ph.D. in the History of Science. There, she was one of the first to be awarded the E. B. Fred Fellowship, to demonstrate that women could make significant contributions to professional fields. In 1963, Merchant, along with 13 other women out of a pool of 114 applicants, was awarded a three-year grant to fund field non-specific graduate research. Her thesis, titled &quot;The Controversy over Living Force: Leibniz to D&#x27;Alembert&quot;, was advised by Erwin N. Heibert.

She was a lecturer in the History of Science, Department of Physics and Natural Sciences Interdisciplinary Program at the University of San Francisco from 1969 to 1974, assistant professor from 1974–76, and associate professor from 1976–78. She was a visiting professor at Oregon State University in the History of Science Department and General Science Department in 1969.

Merchant has been a member of the History of Science Society since 1962. From 1971–1972, she was co-president of the West Coast History of Science Society. She was chair of the Committee on Women of Science from 1973–1974 and co-chair from 1992–1994. She has been a member of the American Society for Environmental History since 1980 and has held positions such as vice-president and president in addition to serving as associate Editor of the &quot;Environmental Review&quot; and as a member of the Rachel Carson Prize Committee for best dissertation.

In 1984, she was a Fulbright Senior Scholar at the University of Umeå in Umeå, Sweden, where she taught in the Department of History of Ideas.

In 1979, she became Assistant Professor of Environmental History, Philosophy, and Ethics, at the University of California, Berkeley, Associate Professor in 1980, and Full Professor in 1986. She retired in 2018 and since then has been Professor of the Graduate School at UC Berkeley.

Merchant has been a Guggenheim fellow; a Fulbright scholar; a two-time fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford; a fellow at the National Humanities Center, Research Triangle Park, NC; a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton; and an American Association for the Advancement of Science fellow. She has presented over 360 lectures in the United States, Canada, Europe, Brazil, and Australia. There are over 230 reviews and discussions of books written by Carolyn Merchant.

In 1971 Merchant was one of the first women to be invited to join the exclusive History of Science Dinner Club at Berkeley.

== &quot;The Death of Nature&quot; ==
&quot;The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology and the Scientific Revolution&quot; (1st edition, 1980; 2nd edition, 1990; 3rd edition, 2020) is Merchant&#x27;s most well-known book. In this book, she emphasizes the importance of gender in the historiography of modern science. Additionally, she focuses her book on &quot;the sexist assumptions that informed sixteenth- and seventeenth-century conceptions of the universe and human physiology.&quot; Merchant expresses the importance of gender in early modern writing on nature, and the use of environmental, social, and literary history as a context for the history of science.

The book has been translated into the following languages: Japanese (1985), German (1987, 1994, 2020), Italian (1988), Swedish (1994), Chinese (1999), Korean (2005), Spanish (2020), French (2020), and Portuguese (2021). There is also a CD collection read by Juliet Jones for HarperAudio (2020).

== Philosophy ==

Merchant argues that prior to the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century, nature was conceived of as the benevolent mother of all things, albeit sometimes wild. This metaphor was gradually replaced by the &quot;domination of nature&quot; model as the Scientific Revolution rationalized and dissected nature to show all her secrets. As nature revealed her secrets, so too she was able to be controlled. Both this intention and the metaphor of &quot;nature unveiled&quot; are still prevalent in scientific language. Conceptions of the Earth as a nurturing bringer of life began slowly to change to one of a resource to be exploited as science became more confident that human minds could know all there was about the natural world and thereby effect changes on it at will.

The female earth was central to organic cosmology that was undermined by the Scientific Revolution and the rise of a market-oriented culture ... for sixteenth-century Europeans the root metaphor binding together the self, society and the cosmos was that of an organism ... organismic theory emphasized interdependence among the parts of the human body, subordination of individual to communal purposes in family, community, and state, and vital life permeate the cosmos to the lowliest stone.

Merchant cites Francis Bacon&#x27;s use of female metaphors to describe the exploitation of nature at this time: &quot;she is either free, ... or driven out of her ordinary course by the perverseness, insolence and forwardness of matter and violence of impediments ... or she is put in constraint, molded and made as it were new by art and the hand of man; as in things artificial ... nature takes orders from man and works under his authority&quot;. Nature must be &quot;bound into service&quot; and made a slave to the human ends of regaining our dominion over nature lost in the &quot;fall from grace&quot; in Eden.

In combination with increasing industrialization and the rise of capitalism that simultaneously replaced women&#x27;s work such as weaving with machinery, and subsumed their roles as subsistence agriculturists, these changes also drove people to live in cities, further removing them from nature and the effects of industrialized production on it. The combined effects of industrialization, scientific exploration of nature, and the ascendancy of the dominion/domination metaphor over that of a nurturing Mother Earth, according to Merchant, can still be felt in social and political thought, as much as it was evident in the art, philosophy, and science of the seventeenth century.

== Legacy of &quot;The Death of Nature&quot; ==
Merchant&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Nature&quot; leaves a scholarly legacy in the fields of environmental history, philosophy, and feminism. The book is considered groundbreaking due to her connection between the feminization of nature and the naturalization of women. Along with this connection, she backs up her claim with historical evidence during the time of enlightenment. However, Merchant was not the first to present ecofeminist ideals and theories. Françoise d&#x27;Eaubonne coined the term &quot;ecofeminisme&quot; to portray the influence of women and their ability to generate an ecological revolution in her 1974 book &quot;Le Feminisme ou la Mort&quot;. Susan Griffin&#x27;s 1978 book &quot;Woman and Nature: The Roaring Inside Her&quot;, which also talks about women and ecology, was written just before the &quot;Death of Nature&quot;. &quot;The Death of Nature&quot; is influential despite these earlier works because it is the first interpretation of an ecofeminist perspective on the history of ecology.

== Additional books ==

=== Ecological Revolutions: Nature, Gender, and Science in New England (1989, 2010) ===
Carolyn Merchant&#x27;s &quot;Ecological Revolutions&quot; explores the stages of ecological transformation that took place in New England as European settlers took control of the land. The resulting “colonial ecological revolution” was to hold sway until roughly the time of American independence, when the onset of industrialization and increasing urbanization brought about the “capitalist ecological revolution.” By the late nineteenth century, Merchant argues, New England had become a society that viewed the whole ecosphere as an arena for human domination.

=== Radical Ecology: The Search for a Livable World (1992, 2005, 2007), Korean translation (2001) ===
In &quot;Radical Ecology&quot;, Merchant argues that laws, regulations, and scientific research alone cannot reverse the spread of pollution or restore dwindling resources. In order to maintain a livable world, we must formulate new social, economic, scientific, and spiritual approaches that will fundamentally transform human relationships with nature. She analyzes the revolutionary ideas of visionary ecologists and examines their efforts to bring environmental problems to the attention of the public. She explores the problems, ideas, and actions that will make society rethink, reconstruct, and reinvent its relationships with non-human nature in search of a livable world.

=== Earthcare: Women and the Environment (1996) ===
Merchant&#x27;s &quot;Earthcare&quot; challenges humanity to revise the ways the Western world has produced, reproduced, and conceptualized its past relations with nature, and suggests a new partnership ethic of environmentalism which men and women alike can embrace. It argues that a cooperative approach will help to create a habitable, sustainable world.

=== Reinventing Eden: The Fate of Nature in Western Culture (2003, 2013) ===
In &quot;Reinventing Eden&quot;, Carolyn Merchant traces the Garden of Eden myth from the Mesopotamian region, where agriculture—and the creation myth—first began, through the Greek and Roman empires, the Enlightenment, and the modern capitalist world. We must consider nature as an independent agent capable of autonomous action. We need to work with nature, balancing our needs and desires with those of the natural world, to include green political parties, sustainable development, and a partnership between humans and the earth.

=== American Environmental History: An Introduction (2007) ===
By studying the many ways diverse peoples have changed, shaped, and conserved the natural world over time, Carolyn Merchant&#x27;s &quot;American Environmental History&quot; provides insights into humanity&#x27;s unique relationship with nature and, more importantly, helps us to better understand the origins of our environmental crisis. It addresses issues such as the expulsion of native peoples from national parks, the preservation of the wilderness, and population growth in the light of gender, race, and class.

=== Autonomous Nature: Problems of Prediction and Control from Ancient Times to the Scientific Revolution (2015) ===
&quot;Autonomous Nature&quot; investigates the history of nature as an active, often unruly force in tension with nature as a rational, logical order from ancient times to the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century. Along with subsequent advances in mechanics, hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism, nature came to be perceived as an orderly, rational, physical world that could be engineered, controlled, and managed. This book focuses on the history of unpredictability, why it was a problem for the ancient world through the Scientific Revolution, and why it is a problem for today. &quot; &quot;

=== Spare the Birds! George Bird Grinnell and the First Audubon Society (2016) ===
In 1887, a year after founding the Audubon Society, explorer and conservationist George Bird Grinnell launched Audubon Magazine. The magazine constituted one of the first efforts to preserve bird species decimated by the women&#x27;s hat trade, hunting, and loss of habitat. Within two years, however, for practical reasons, Grinnell dissolved both the magazine and the society. Remarkably, Grinnell&#x27;s mission was soon revived by women and men who believed in it, and the work continues today. &quot;Spare the Birds!&quot; presents the exceptional story of George Bird Grinnell and his writings and legacy. It features Grinnell&#x27;s biographies of ornithologists John James Audubon and Alexander Wilson and his editorials and descriptions of Audubon&#x27;s bird paintings.

=== Science and Nature: Past, Present and Future (2018) ===
&quot;Science and Nature&quot; brings together the work and insights of Carolyn Merchant on the history of science, environmental history, and ethics. The book explores her ideas about the interconnections among science, women, nature, and history as they have emerged over her academic lifetime. Focusing on topics such as The Death of Nature, the Scientific Revolution, women in the history of science and environment, and partnership ethics, it synthesizes her writings and sets out a vision for the twenty-first century.

=== The Anthropocene and the Humanities (2020) ===
&quot;The Anthropocene and the Humanities&quot; focuses on the original concept of the Anthropocene first proposed by Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer in their foundational 2000 paper. Here they argued that the Anthropocene—The Age of Humanity—was launched in 1766 with the invention of James Watt&#x27;s version of the steam engine, making possible steam engines, steam boats, trains, and factories, and ultimately leading to automobiles and airplanes. Using history, art, literature, religion, philosophy, ethics, and justice as the focal points, Merchant traces key figures and developments in the humanities throughout the Anthropocene era and explores how these disciplines might influence sustainability in the next century.

== Edited books ==

=== Major Problems in American Environmental History (1993, 2004, 2012) ===
In this edited book, Carolyn Merchant introduces students to primary sources and analytical essays by well-known environmental historians on important topics in U.S. environmental history from native American times to the present. It asks students to evaluate primary sources, test the interpretations of distinguished historians and others, and draw their own conclusions. Each chapter of &quot;Major Problems in American Environmental History&quot; includes a map that situates the topic within a place and era, along with suggestions for further reading.

=== Key Concepts in Critical Theory: Ecology (1994, 2008) ===
Starting with an examination of the use of modernist thought as legitimation for the domination of nature, this collection of essays progresses on a broad front: it examines how First-World economies create Third-World dependency; the connections between poverty and population; how basic needs could be fulfilled in a green sustainable economy; the debate between deep, social, and socialist ecologists over the new ecological worldview; ecofeminism and the liberation of both women and nature; environmental justice for minorities and Third-World peoples; the need for new spiritual relations between people and nature; and a new postmodern science that offers people a partnership with nature. The conclusion of &quot;Key Concepts in Critical Theory: Ecology&quot; presents the “Principles of Environmental Justice,” adopted by the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit.

=== Green Versus Gold: Sources in California&#x27;s Environmental History (1998) ===
&quot;Green Versus Gold&quot; is an edited book that provides a compelling look at California&#x27;s environmental history from its Native American past to conflicts and movements of recent decades. It brings together a large storehouse of primary sources and interpretative essays to create a comprehensive picture of the history of ecological and human interactions in one of the nation&#x27;s most diverse and resource-rich states.

=== Encyclopedia of World Environmental History, 3 vols. (2004), co-edited with Shepherd Krech III, and John McNeill ===
While the relationship between humanity and nature has been a constant feature of the human situation, the human impact on the environment has only recently become a topic of general interest to students, as well as to scholars and professionals in disciplines across the board. This co-edited three-volume set provides not only broad historical coverage on how human beliefs and actions have altered the natural world, but also covers the latest developments in the field. The &quot;Encyclopedia of World Environmental History&quot; also includes an analysis of natural phenomena and events and their impact on human societies.

=== After the Death of Nature: Carolyn Merchant and the Future of Human-Nature Relations (2018) ===
A festschrift honoring Carolyn Merchant&#x27;s work, &quot;After the Death of Nature&quot;, edited by Kenneth Worthy, Elizabeth Allison, and Whitney A. Bauman, appeared in 2018. This book examines and builds on Carolyn Merchant&#x27;s legacy of environmental thought and her critical responses to modern mechanistic and patriarchal conceptions of nature and women, as well as her systematic taxonomies of environmental thought and action. Scholars featured in the book assess, praise, critique, and extend her work to arrive at a more extended understanding of the human place in nature today. The book examines and builds on Carolyn Merchant&#x27;s decades-long legacy of innovative environmental thought and her critical responses to modern mechanistic and patriarchal conceptions of nature and women, as well as her systematic taxonomies of environmental thought and action. The ideas hold the potential for healthier and more just relations with nature and among peoples in the future.

Carolyn Merchant has also written more than 100 single-authored research articles. A symposium honoring her work was held in 2018.

<text>Košice is the largest city in eastern Slovakia. It is situated on the river Hornád at the eastern reaches of the Slovak Ore Mountains, near the border with Hungary. With a population of approximately 230,000, Košice is the second-largest city in Slovakia, after the capital Bratislava.

Being the economic and cultural centre of eastern Slovakia, Košice is the seat of the Košice Region and Košice Self-governing Region, it belongs to the Košice-Prešov agglomeration, and is home to the Slovak Constitutional Court, three universities, various dioceses, and many museums, galleries, and theatres. In 2013 Košice was the European Capital of Culture, together with Marseille, France. Košice is an important industrial centre of Slovakia, and the U.S. Steel Košice steel mill is the largest employer in the city. The town has extensive railway connections and an international airport.

The city has a preserved historical centre which is the largest among Slovak towns. There are heritage protected buildings in Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and Art Nouveau styles with Slovakia&#x27;s largest church: the Cathedral of St. Elizabeth. The long main street, rimmed with aristocratic palaces, Catholic churches, and townsfolk&#x27;s houses, is a thriving pedestrian zone with boutiques, cafés, and restaurants. The city is known as the first settlement in Europe to be granted its own coat-of-arms.

==Etymology==
The first written mention of the city was in 1230 as &quot;Villa Cassa&quot;. The name probably comes from the Slavic personal name &quot;Koš&quot;, &quot;Koša&quot; → &quot;Košici&quot; (Koš&#x27;people) → &quot;Košice&quot; (13821383) with the patronymic Slavic suffix &quot;-ice&quot; through a natural development in Slovak (similar place names are also known from other Slavic countries). In Hungarian &quot;Koša&quot; → &quot;Kasa&quot;, &quot;Kassa&quot; with a vowel mutation typical for the borrowing of old Slavic names in the region (Vojkovce → Vajkócz, Sokoľ → Szakalya, Szakál, Hodkovce → Hatkóc, etc.). The Latinized form &quot;Cassovia&quot; became common in the 15th century.

Another theory is a derivation from Old Slovak &quot;kosa&quot;, &quot;clearing&quot;, related to modern Slovak &quot;kosiť&quot;, &quot;to reap&quot;. According to other sources the city name may derive from an old Hungarian first name which begins with &quot;Ko&quot;.

Historically, the city has been known as &quot;Kaschau&quot; (in German), &quot;Kassa&quot; (in Hungarian), &quot;Kaşa&quot; (in Turkish), &quot;Cassovia&quot; (in Latin), &quot;Cassovie&quot; (in French), &quot;Cașovia&quot; (in Romanian), &quot;Кошице&quot; (in Russian, Ukrainian and Rusyn), &quot;Koszyce&quot; (in Polish) and קאשוי (&quot;Kashoy)&quot; (in Yiddish) (see here for more names). Below is a chronology of the various names:
==History==


The first evidence of habitation can be traced back to the end of the Paleolithic era. The first written reference to the Hungarian town of Košice (as the royal village of &quot;Villa Cassa&quot;) comes from 1230. After the Mongol invasion in 1241, King Béla IV of Hungary invited German colonists (see Zipser Germans, Germans of Hungary) to fill the gaps in population. The city was in the historic Abauj County of the Kingdom of Hungary.

There were two independent settlements, Lower Kassa and Upper Kassa, which were amalgamated in the 13th century around the long lens-shaped &quot;ring&quot;, of today&#x27;s Main Street. The first known town privileges come from 1290. The town proliferated because of its strategic location on an international trade route from agriculturally rich central Hungary to central Poland, itself part of a longer route connecting the Balkans and the Adriatic and Aegean seas to the Baltic Sea. The privileges given by the king were helpful in developing crafts, business, increasing importance (seat of the royal chamber for Upper Hungary), and for building its strong fortifications. In 1307, the first guild regulations were registered here; they were the oldest in the Kingdom of Hungary.

As a Hungarian free royal town, Košice reinforced the king&#x27;s troops at the crucial moment of the bloody Battle of Rozgony in 1312 against the strong aristocratic &quot;Palatine Amadé&quot; Aba (family). In 1347, it became the second-placed city in the hierarchy of the Hungarian free royal towns, with the same rights as the capital Buda. In 1369, it was granted its own coat of arms by Louis I of Hungary. The Diet convened by Louis I in Košice decided that women could inherit the Hungarian throne.


The significance and wealth of the city at the end of the 14th century were mirrored by the decision to build an entirely new church on the grounds of the previously destroyed smaller St. Elisabeth Church. The construction of St. Elisabeth Cathedral, the biggest cathedral in the Kingdom of Hungary, was supported by Emperor Sigismund, and by the apostolic see itself. From the beginning of the 15th century, the city played a leading role in the Pentapolitana – the league of the five most important cities in Upper Hungary (Bardejov, Levoča, Košice, Prešov, and Sabinov). During the reign of King Matthias Corvinus the town reached its medieval population peak. With an estimated 10,000 inhabitants, it was among the largest medieval cities in Europe.

The history of Košice was heavily influenced by the dynastic disputes over the Hungarian throne which, together with the decline of the continental trade, brought the city into stagnation. Vladislaus III of Varna failed to capture the city in 1441. John Jiskra&#x27;s mercenaries from Bohemia defeated Tamás Székely&#x27;s Hungarian army in 1449. John I Albert, Prince of Poland, failed to capture the city during a six-month-long siege in 1491. In 1526, the city paid homage to the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I. John Zápolya captured the town in 1536, but Ferdinand I reconquered it in 1551. In 1554, the settlement became the seat of the Captaincy of Upper Hungary.

===17th century===
In 1604, Catholics seized the Lutheran church in Košice. The Calvinist Stephen Bocskay then occupied Košice during his Protestant insurrection against the Habsburg dynasty, with the backing of the Ottomans. The future George I Rákóczi joined him as a military commander there. Giorgio Basta, commander of the Habsburg forces, failed in his attempt to recapture the city. At the Treaty of Vienna (1606), in return for giving back territory that included Košice, the rebels won from the Habsburgs a concession of religious toleration for the Magyar nobility and brokered an Austrian-Turkish peace treaty. Stephen Bocskay died in Košice on December 29, 1606, and was interred there.

For some decades during the 17th century Košice was part of the Principality of Transylvania, and consequently a part of the Ottoman Empire and was referred to as &quot;Kaşa&quot; in Turkish. On September 5, 1619, the prince of Transylvania, Gabriel Bethlen captured Košice with the assistance of the future George I Rákóczi in another anti-Habsburg insurrection. By the Peace of Nikolsburg in 1621, the Habsburgs restored the religious toleration agreement of 1606 and recognized Transylvanian rule over the seven Partium counties: Ugocsa County, Bereg County, Zemplén County, Borsod County, Szabolcs County, Szatmár County and Abaúj County (including Košice). Bethlen married Catherine von Hohenzollern, of Johann Sigismund Kurfürst von Brandenburg, in Košice in 1626.

After Bethlen&#x27;s death in 1629, Košice and the rest of the Partium was returned to the Habsburgs.

On January 18, 1644, the Diet in Košice elected George I Rákóczi the prince of Hungary. He took the whole of Upper Hungary and joined the Swedish army besieging Brno for a projected march against Vienna. However, his nominal overlord, the Ottoman Sultan, ordered him to end the campaign, though he did so with gains. In the Treaty of Linz (1645), Košice returned to Transylvania again as the Habsburgs recognized George&#x27;s rule over the seven counties of the Partium. He died in 1648, and Košice was returned to the Habsburgs once more.
Subsequently, Košice became a centre of the Counter-Reformation. In 1657, a printing house and university were founded by the Jesuits, funded by Emperor Leopold I. The 1664 Peace of Vasvár at the end of the Austro-Turkish War (1663-1664) awarded Szabolcs and Szatmár counties to the Habsburgs, which put once more positioned Košice further inside the borders of Royal Hungary. In the 1670s the Habsburgs built a modern pentagonal fortress (citadel) south of the city. Also in the 1670s, the city was besieged by Kuruc armies several times, and it again rebelled against the Habsburgs. The rebel leaders were massacred by the Emperor&#x27;s soldiers on November 26, 1677.

Another rebel leader, Imre Thököly captured the city in 1682, making &quot;Kaşa&quot; once again a vassal territory of the Ottoman Empire under the Principality of Upper Hungary until 1686. The Austrian field marshal Aeneas de Caprara took Košice back from the Ottomans in late 1685. In 1704–1711 Prince of Transylvania Francis II Rákóczi made Košice the main base in his War for Independence. By 1713 the fortress had been demolished.

When not under Ottoman suzerainty, Košice was the seat of the Habsburg &quot;Captaincy of Upper Hungary&quot; and the seat of the Chamber of Szepes County (Spiš, Zips), which was a subsidiary of the supreme financial agency in Vienna responsible for Upper Hungary. Due to Ottoman occupation of Eger, Košice was the residence of Eger&#x27;s archbishop from 1596 to 1700.

From 1657, it was the seat of the historic Royal University of Kassa (Universitas Cassoviensis), founded by Bishop Benedict Kishdy. The university was transformed into a &quot;Royal Academy&quot; in 1777, then into a &quot;Law Academy&quot; in the 19th century. It was to cease to exist in the turbulent year 1921. After the end of the anti-Habsburg uprisings in 1711, the victorious Austrian armies drove the Ottoman Army back to the south, and this major territorial change created new trade routes which circumvented Košice. The city began to decline and from a rich medieval town became a provincial town known for its military base and mainly dependent on agriculture.

In 1723, the Immaculata statue was erected on the site of a former gallows at Hlavná ulica (&quot;Main Street&quot;) to commemorate the plague of 1710–1711. The city also became one of the centers of the Hungarian linguistic revival, including the publication of the first Hungarian-language periodical, called the Magyar Museum, in Hungary in 1788. The city&#x27;s walls were demolished step by step from the early 19th century to 1856; only the Executioner&#x27;s Bastion remained among limited parts of the wall. The city became the seat of its own bishopric in 1802. The city&#x27;s surroundings became a theater of war again during the Revolutions of 1848, when the Imperial cavalry general Franz Schlik defeated the Hungarian army on December 8, 1848, and January 4, 1849. The city was captured by the Hungarian army on February 15, 1849, but the Russian troops drove them back on June 24, 1849.

In 1828, there were three manufacturers and 460 workshops. The first factories were established in the 1840s (sugar and nail factories). The first telegram message arrived in 1856, and the railway connected the city to Miskolc in 1860. In 1873, there were already connections to Prešov, Žilina, and Chop, Ukraine (in today&#x27;s Ukraine). The city gained a public transit system in 1891 when the track was laid down for a horse-drawn tramway. The traction was electrified in 1914. In 1906, Francis II Rákóczi&#x27;s house of Rodostó was reproduced in Košice, and his remains were buried in the St. Elisabeth Cathedral.

After World War I and during the gradual break-up of Austria-Hungary, the city at first became a part of the transient &quot;Eastern Slovak Republic&quot;, declared on December 11, 1918, in Košice and earlier in Prešov under the protection of Hungary. On December 29, 1918, the Czechoslovak Legions entered the city, making it part of the newly established Czechoslovakia. However, in June 1919, Košice was occupied again, as part of the Slovak Soviet Republic, a proletarian puppet state of Hungary. The Czechoslovak troops secured the city for Czechoslovakia in July 1919, which was later upheld under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon in 1920.

=== Fate of Košice Jews ===

Jews had lived in Košice since the 16th century but were not allowed to settle permanently. There is a document identifying the local coiner in 1524 as a Jew and claiming that his predecessor was a Jew as well. Jews were allowed to enter the city during the town fair, but were forced to leave it by night, and lived mostly in nearby Rozunfaca. In 1840 the ban was removed, and, a few Jews were living in the town, among them a widow who ran a small Kosher restaurant for the Jewish merchants passing through the town.

Košice was ceded to Hungary, by the First Vienna Award, from 1938 until early 1945. The town was bombarded on June 26, 1941, by a still unidentified aircraft, in what became a pretext for the Hungarian government to declare war on the Soviet Union a day later.

The German occupation of Hungary led to the deportation and almost certain extermination of Košice&#x27;s entire Jewish population of 12,000 and an additional 2,000 from surrounding areas via cattle cars to the concentration camps.

In 1946, after the war, Košice was the site of an orthodox festival, with a Mizrachi convention and a Bnei Akiva Yeshiva (school) for Jews, which, later that year, moved with its students to Israel.

A memorial plaque in honor to the 12,000 deported and exterminated Jews from Košice and the surrounding areas in Slovakia was unveiled at the pre-war Košice Orthodox synagogue in 1992.

=== Soviet occupation ===
The Soviet Union captured the town in January 1945, and for a short time, it became a temporary capital of the restored Czechoslovak Republic until the Soviet&#x27;s Red Army reached Prague. Among other acts, the Košice Government Programme was declared on April 5, 1945.

A large population of ethnic Germans in the area was expelled and sent on foot to Germany or to the Soviet border.

After the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia seized power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, the city became part of the Eastern Bloc. Several cultural institutions that still exist were founded, and large residential areas around the city were built. The construction and expansion of the East Slovak Ironworks caused the population to grow from 60,700 in 1950 to 235,000 in 1991. Before the breakup of Czechoslovakia (1993), it was the fifth-largest city in the federation.

=== Under Slovakia ===
Following the Velvet Divorce and creation of the Slovak Republic, Košice became the second-largest city in the country and became a seat of a constitutional court. Since 1995, it has been the seat of the Archdiocese of Košice.

After 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Košice, as a regional metropolitan area, became a major hub for administration, transfer and housing of refugees fleeing from Ukraine.

==Geography==
Košice lies at an altitude of above sea level and covers an area of . It is located in eastern Slovakia, about from the Hungarian, from the Ukrainian, and from the Polish borders. It is about east of Slovakia&#x27;s capital Bratislava and a chain of villages connects it to Prešov which is about to the north.

Košice is on the Hornád River in the , at the easternmost reaches of the Slovak Ore Mountains. More precisely, it is a subdivision of the Čierna hora mountains in the northwest and Volovské vrchy mountains in the southwest. The basin is met on the east by the Slanské vrchy mountains.

==Climate==
Košice has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dcbo&quot;), as the city lies in the north temperate zone. The city has four distinct seasons with long, warm summers with cool nights and long, cold, and snowy winters. Precipitation varies little throughout the year with abundant precipitation that falls during summer and only few during winter. The coldest month is January, with an average temperature of , and the hottest month is July, with an average temperature of .

== Demographics ==

Košice has a population of 225,044 (2024). According to the 2021 census, 84% of inhabitants are of Slovak nationality, 2% are each Hungarians and additional 2% Roma. There are also modestly sized Czech, Ruthenian, Ukrainian and Vietnamese communities. In terms of religion, 51% of inhabitants are Catholic and 28% had no religious affiliation, with smaller Protestant denominations also present. The median age as of 2024 is 44 years.

===Historical demographics===
According to the researchers the town had a German majority until the mid-16th century, and by 1650, 72.5% of the population may have been Hungarians, 13.2% was German, 14.3% was Slovak or of uncertain origin. The Ottoman Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi mentioned that the city was inhabited by &quot;Hungarians, Germans, Upper Hungarians&quot; in 1661 when the city was under the suzerainty of Ottoman Empire and under Turkish control. But by 1850, the Slovaks gained a plurality of 46.5%, with Hungarians reduced to 28.5% and Germans at 15.6%.

The linguistic makeup of the town&#x27;s population underwent historical changes that alternated between the growth of the ratio of those who claimed Hungarian and those who claimed Slovak as their language. With a population of 28,884 in 1891, just under half (49.9%) of the inhabitants of Košice declared Hungarian, then the official language, as their main means of communication, 33.6% Slovak, and 13.5% German; 72.2% were Roman Catholics, 11.4% Jews, 7.3% Lutherans, 6.7% Greek Catholics, and 4.3% Calvinists. The results of that census are questioned by some historians by claims that they were manipulated, to increase the percentage of the Magyars during a period of Magyarization.

By the 1910 census, which is sometimes accused of being manipulated by the ruling Hungarian bureaucracy, 75.4% of the 44,211 inhabitants claimed Hungarian, 14.8% Slovak, 7.2% German and 1.8% Polish. The Jews were split among other groups by the 1910 census, as only the most frequently-used language, not ethnicity, was registered. The population around 1910 was multidenominational and multiethnic, and the differences in the level of education mirror the stratification of society. The town&#x27;s linguistic balance began to shift towards Slovak after World War I by Slovakization in the newly established Czechoslovakia.

According to the 1930 census, the city had 70,111, with 230 Gypsies (today Roma), 42 245 Czechoslovaks (today Czechs and Slovaks), 11 504 Hungarians, 3 354 Germans, 44 Poles, 14 Romanians, 801 Ruthenians, 27 Serbocroatians (today Serbs and Croatians) and 5 733 Jews.

As a consequence of the First and Second Vienna Awards, Košice was ceded to Hungary. Starting in 15 May 1944, during the German occupation of Hungary towards the end of World War II, approximately 10,000 Jews were deported by the Nazis, with the enthusiastic assistance of the Hungarian Interior Ministry and its gendarmerie (the csendőrség). The last transport to Auschwitz left the city in 2 June, three months before the Arrow Cross Party gained control over Hungary. The ethnic makeup of the town was dramatically changed by the persecution of the town&#x27;s large Hungarian majority, population exchanges between Hungary and Slovakia and Slovakization and by mass migration of Slovaks into newly built communist-block-microdistricts, which increased the population of Košice four times by 1989 and made it the fastest growing city in Czechoslovakia.

==Culture==
===Performing arts===
There are several theatres in Košice. The Košice State Theater was founded in 1945 (then under the name of the East Slovak National Theater). It consists of three ensembles: drama, opera, and ballet. Other theatres include the Marionette Theatre and the Old Town Theatre (&quot;Staromestské divadlo&quot;). The presence of Hungarian and Roma minorities makes it also host the Hungarian &quot;Thália&quot; theatre and the professional Roma theatre &quot;Romathan&quot;.

Košice is the home of the State Philharmonic Košice (&quot;Štátna filharmónia Košice&quot;), established in 1968 as the second professional symphonic orchestra in Slovakia. It organizes festivals such as the Košice Music Spring Festival, the International Organ Music Festival, and the Festival of Contemporary art.

===Museums and galleries===
Some of the museums and galleries based in the city include the East Slovak Museum (&quot;Vychodoslovenské múzeum&quot;), originally established in 1872 under the name of the Upper Hungarian Museum. The Slovak Technical Museum (&quot;Slovenské technické múzeum&quot;) with a planetarium, established in 1947, is the only museum in the technical category in Slovakia that specializes in the history and traditions of science and technology. The East Slovak Gallery (&quot;Východoslovenská galéria&quot;) was established in 1951 as the first regional gallery with the aim to document artistic life in present-day eastern Slovakia.

=== European Capital of Culture ===
In 2008 Košice won the competition among Slovak cities to hold the prestigious title European Capital of Culture 2013. Project Interface aims at the transformation of Košice from a centre of heavy industry to a postindustrial city with creative potential and new cultural infrastructure. Project authors bring Košice a concept of the creative economy – merging of economy and industry with arts, where transformed urban space encourages development of certain fields of creative industry (design, media, architecture, music and film production, IT technologies, creative tourism). The artistic and cultural program stems from a conception of sustained maintainable activities with long-lasting effects on cultural life in Košice and its region. The main project venues are:
*Kasárne Kulturpark – 19th-century military barracks turned into new urban space with a centre of contemporary art, exhibition and concert halls and workshops for the creative industry.
*Kunsthalle Košice – a 1960s disused swimming pool turned into the first Kunsthalle in Slovakia.
*SPOTs – the 1970s and 1980s disused heat exchangers turned into cultural &quot;spots&quot; in Communist-Era-block-of-flats districts.
*City park, Park Komenského and Mojzesova – revitalisation of urban spaces.
*Castle of Košice, Amfiteáter, Mansion of Krásna, Handicrafts Street – reconstruction.

<doc id="310719" wikidata="Q3089641" url="?curid=310719" title="Jellyfish (band)">
<text>Jellyfish was an American rock band that formed in San Francisco in 1989. Led by songwriters Andy Sturmer (drums, vocals) and Roger Manning (keyboards, vocals), the group was known for their blend of 1960s classic rock and XTC-style power pop. They released two albums, &quot;Bellybutton&quot; (1990) and &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; (1993), that proved influential to many subsequent acts in a similar vein.

Sturmer and Manning met in high school and shared an admiration for jazz, post-punk, and British pop music. Following a stint as members of Beatnik Beatch, they quit the group to continue songwriting with one another and formed Jellyfish. They were initially supported by Jason Falkner (guitar) and Roger&#x27;s brother Chris (bass). After the tour for &quot;Bellybutton&quot;, those musicians were replaced by Tim Smith (bass) and Eric Dover (guitar). The group viewed &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; as their &quot;masterpiece&quot; and the fulfillment of their original grandiose vision for the band, emphasizing bombasticity, vocal harmonies, orchestration, and studio experimentation.

During their five-year existence, Jellyfish attracted critical acclaim and a devoted cult following, but struggled against prevailing rock trends (hair metal and grunge). Their only charting single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 was &quot;Baby&#x27;s Coming Back&quot;. Three other songs were top-twenty hits on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock Tracks chart: &quot;The King Is Half-Undressed&quot;, &quot;That Is Why&quot;, and &quot;The Ghost at Number One&quot;. Elsewhere, they had six songs appear on the UK Singles Chart, although none reached higher than the top thirty.

Jellyfish broke up in 1994 due to poor record sales, Sturmer&#x27;s discomfort with his role as frontman, and artistic conflicts between the two songwriters. Manning subsequently formed Imperial Drag with Dover, and pursued careers as a solo artist and session musician. Sturmer worked with the Japanese pop duo Puffy AmiYumi and continues to compose music for animated television programs. From 2017 to 2022, the trio of Manning, Dover, and Smith recorded together as the Lickerish Quartet.

==Formation==
While attending Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton, California in the early 1980s, Andy Sturmer and Roger Manning met and bonded over their love for jazz. Later in the decade, they joined Beatnik Beatch, a group fronted by Chris Ketner. Sturmer was the group&#x27;s drummer, singer, and songwriter, while Manning was keyboardist. The duo soon began collaborating with one another, writing compositions that were stylistically different from the songs the band was producing at the time. As a side gig, the two also briefly wrote commercial jingles for companies such as Montana Hawk Shooting Range and Shutterbug Camera Store. In August 1989, a year after Atlantic Records released Beatnik Beatch&#x27;s eponymous debut album, Manning and Sturmer left the group to continue songwriting with one another. At this juncture, they were still signed with Atlantic Records, but grew dissatisfied with the label&#x27;s lack of interest for the new project. Virtually their only advocate at the label was A&amp;R man John S. Carter, who was soon dismissed from the company.

Sturmer was the group&#x27;s de facto leader and frontman. Although Sturmer and Manning were each credited for 50% of their writing collaborations, typically Sturmer&#x27;s contributions were musical and lyrical, while Manning&#x27;s were only musical. Manning commented: &quot;Andy was perfectly capable of writing completed, finished great songs on his own. I could write lyrics, but it was a painstaking process.&quot; In Sturmer&#x27;s summation: &quot;It&#x27;s not collaborative on every level. I write all the lyrics, but we write the music together. The way Roger and I write is that we embellish each other&#x27;s ideas, like painting a picture. We grew up together and had a lot of the same records in our collection, so we don&#x27;t have to explain our offbeat ideas to each other.&quot;

Jason Falkner was the lead guitarist for the Three O&#x27;Clock, a Los Angeles-based Paisley Underground band. He originally put a newspaper advertisement looking for &quot;like-minded musicians&quot; influenced by XTC, David Bowie, and the Blue Nile. Manning responded to Falkner&#x27;s ad and the two met to collaborate. Nothing initially came out of the meeting. However, once Manning and Sturmer left Beatnik Beatch, Manning reconnected with Falkner to see if he was interested in joining the new group. Falkner was persuaded by the prospect of a major-label deal. He joined with the understanding – promised by Manning without consulting Sturmer – that he would be a contributing songwriter. Tensions arose immediately, as Sturmer was not ready to accommodate this arrangement, while Falkner struggled to connect with Sturmer on a personal level. Manning later called Falkner &quot;the perfect part of the Jellyfish triangle during that period of our evolution&quot;.

The name &quot;Jellyfish&quot; came at the suggestion of an Atlantic executive, but was initially ignored by the group. Once they finished recording for their first album and had to pick a name for themselves, Sturmer decided to go with Jellyfish, for lack of any better alternative. According to journalist Paul Rees, the name was chosen to evoke the feeling of something graceful, yet amorphous and ephemeral.

==&quot;Bellybutton&quot;==
Jellyfish recorded their first album &quot;Bellybutton&quot; at Schnee Studios in Hollywood with producer Albhy Galuten, best known for his work with the Bee Gees on &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, and engineer Jack Joseph Puig. Unusually, the band&#x27;s demos were almost as fully realized as the studio recordings. Manning explained that the group took extra care in writing and arranging material due to the stresses of hourly studio costs, as they wanted to use the time to experiment musically, and because &quot;Andy and I had to believe 100 per cent, &#x27;Okay, this [song] is working. This is mostly going somewhere. We feel that this is now fleshed out enough that we’re &quot;confident&quot; to be in the studio environment.&#x27;&quot; No synthesizers or sequencers were used on the recording. Redd Kross bassist Steve McDonald, who played on the album, said that Manning intended the record to sound &quot;somewhere between Queen and Partridge Family&quot;.

Sessions lasted from September 1989 to March 1990 while the band were shopping around their demos to various labels and struggling to extricate themselves from Atlantic. Despite never playing live, they became subject to a bidding war among eight labels. Ultimately, they signed with Charisma Records, a newly-formed subsidiary of Virgin. &quot;Bellybutton&quot; was released on July 27, 1990 when the prevailing rock music trend was hair metal. Manning remembered that the band were &quot;very aware&quot; of that fact and believed that &quot;in being true to ourselves, we couldn&#x27;t have been more opposite to what was going on in music.&quot; The album peaked at number 124 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was well received by contemporary music critics with singles &quot;The King Is Half-Undressed&quot; and &quot;Baby&#x27;s Coming Back&quot; enjoying moderate radio play. However, album sales numbered at a then-underwhelming 100,000 units sold.

Reviews for &quot;Bellybutton&quot; ranged from favorable to mixed, with most critics focusing on the group&#x27;s resemblance to older acts. The band were sometimes dismissed as a revivalist nostalgia group, exacerbated by the flamboyant 1970s-era outfits they wore on stage and on promotional materials. They were also often tagged as alternative rock despite being out of step with any other act in the genre. Sturmer said that the group &quot;never tried to suck up to any genre of music. We just did what came naturally to us and didn&#x27;t worry about it.&quot; Falkner said that they &quot;uniformly loathed the whole lumberjack rock star thing that was starting to happen [...] We didn&#x27;t want to be an everyman band at all.&quot; He denied the assumption that the label forced the group into their Willy Wonka-style image: &quot;There is no record company on the planet that would make people dress like that. That was all down to us.&quot; Later, the band toned down their image as they tired of critics writing about their clothes rather than the music. 

Jellyfish recruited Roger&#x27;s younger brother Chris on bass guitar and spent 12 weeks rehearsing for their 50-minute live show. From August 1990 to September 1991, they toured in support of &quot;Bellybutton&quot;, opening for the bands World Party and the Black Crowes. Their stage show featured an assortment of props, including a white picket fence, a bubble machine, Lite-Brite, and an eight-foot tall standee of Gavin MacLeod. They played the biggest show of their career in front of 72,000 people at Wembley Stadium, as the first of five bands opening for INXS. A considerable cult following began to form around Jellyfish, although the heavy touring schedule fatigued the group substantially. Tensions also worsened among the band members. Frustrated by having his songwriting contributions ignored by Manning and Sturmer, Falkner left the group after the tour. He later said: “I was told that Jellyfish would be an equal three-piece, with us writing and playing everything. That turned out to be a total joke. I felt like I was duped.&quot; Chris also quit the band to become a chef.

==&quot;Spilt Milk&quot;==

As Jellyfish gathered prestige among industry insiders, many began soliciting the band for collaboration, including actress/singer Kim Basinger and Tears for Fears&#x27; Curt Smith. Following the &quot;Bellybutton&quot; tour, Sturmer and Manning worked with Ringo Starr for his 1992 solo album &quot;Time Takes Time&quot;. Five songs were written for Starr, but only one was used (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Believe You&quot;). Sturmer and Manning also appeared in the music video for Starr&#x27;s &quot;Weight of the World&quot;. They were then invited to work with Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. Wilson and Jellyfish had one songwriting session, but it was unproductive. One of the two songs they worked on, &quot;Wish it Would Rain&quot;, later appeared on Manning&#x27;s solo album &quot;Solid State Warrior&quot; (2005), albeit with Wilson&#x27;s contributions omitted. The band also contributed the &quot;Mario&quot;-inspired song &quot;Ignorance Is Bliss&quot; to the 1991 compilation &quot;&quot;. For the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, Sturmer and Manning backed William Shatner as he sang the Best Song nominees. 

After their sessions with Starr and Wilson, the band was dedicated to making their next album &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; &quot;their masterpiece&quot;. Manning and Sturmer spent about eight hours a day, six days a week writing songs together at Sturmer&#x27;s house in Cotati, CA between October 1991 and March 1992. Galuten and Puig returned as co-producers alongside Manning and Sturmer. Recorded from April to September 1992 on a budget of $300,000 (equivalent to $ in ), the album&#x27;s music was more aggressive, bombastic, and reliant on vocal harmonies and studio experimentation than &quot;Bellybutton&quot;. Manning reflected that &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; represented &quot;the total vision we had for Jellyfish. The grandeur that was in our hearts from day one was finally realised with that album.&quot; Bassist Tim Smith was recruited for the sessions and upcoming tour. Also featured on the album were guitarists Tom &quot;T-Bone&quot; Wolk, Lyle Workman, and Jon Brion (the latter soon formed the Grays with Falkner).

Released on February 9, 1993, &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; peaked at number 164 in the US. Its poor sales were attributed to being released during the height of the popularity of grunge. Like &quot;Bellybutton&quot;, critics generally received the album favorably, but focused on its resemblance to artists of the 1970s, particularly the Raspberries. Detractors bemoaned the group for seemingly choosing Supertramp and Queen as influences. In the UK, the album performed better, reaching number 21. Its fans included Queen&#x27;s Brian May, who praised the album in a contemporary interview. In late 1993, Jellyfish toured as the opening act for Tears for Fears. This tour included guitarist Eric Dover, who Sturmer said was &quot;not really a full-fledged member [of the group]&quot;, with stops in Australia, Europe and Japan (the latter&#x27;s dates were completely sold out). Jellyfish played their last show on November 20, 1993 at the Broward County Fair in Hallandale Beach, Florida. 

In 1994, Jellyfish contributed a cover of Harry Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;Think About Your Troubles&quot; to the tribute album &quot;For the Love of Harry: Everybody Sings Nilsson&quot; (1995). Their contribution was a personal request from Nilsson, who was a fan of the group. According to Manning, Nilsson met the band at a concert in Los Angeles, and &quot;we all agreed that we should hook up and do some writing soon. Six weeks later he passed away.&quot; The cover was the last song Sturmer and Manning recorded together.

==Breakup==

During the tour for &quot;Spilt Milk&quot;, Sturmer and Manning grew increasingly distant as friends. On their return home, the two songwriters independently wrote material for a third album, provisionally titled &quot;Nausea Trois&quot;. By then, they were drifting apart musically. Manning remembered that, prior, they would bond over albums such as Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Ram&quot; or the Zombies&#x27; &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot;; however, &quot;it was clear that none of that was happening anymore.&quot; He said that he was &quot;rediscovering my love of [...] high-energy, fun melodic pop with attitude. And Andy was Leonard Cohen. That was it.&quot; When Sturmer presented him a country ballad song, he accordingly &quot;left in tears because I had zero interest in recording it.&quot; Sturmer felt that Manning had outgrown the partnership, and for his part, was fearful that Manning&#x27;s new songs would likely inspire journalists to persistently compare the band to Alice Cooper.

Another reason the band broke up, in Manning&#x27;s words, was Sturmer&#x27;s discomfort with being &quot;in the spotlight&quot;. Sturmer resented his role as leader and frontman, especially when it came to business matters, and his wish for Manning to take more initiative in the band&#x27;s leadership had become a source of rancor. However, Sturmer rejected the idea of Tim Smith contributing as a third songwriter, as Smith recalled, &quot;I think that was enough for Roger, partially, among other things, to shut it all down at that point anyway. [...] I felt like I was the one that kind of tried to at least keep the band together in some way, and after that response, it was like, &#x27;Whatever, if it happens it happens, I&#x27;ve done all that I can do here.&#x27;&quot; Financial pressures also loomed over the band. 

On April 4, Manning phoned Sturmer and said &quot;I think we&#x27;re done&quot;, to which Sturmer responded: &quot;I&#x27;ve been thinking the same thing.&quot; One month later, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that the group had disintegrated due to &quot;creative differences&quot;. In a June &quot;Denver Post&quot; article, Falkner responded to the news: &quot;It&#x27;s ironic. Let&#x27;s just say that I didn&#x27;t have a moment of silence when I heard about it.&quot;

==Aftermath==
===1994–2000s===
Soon after Jellyfish broke up, Manning formed the Moog Cookbook and Imperial Drag, the latter group with Eric Dover. He has also released a few solo records and worked as a session musician. Some of his songs proposed for the potential third Jellyfish album were reworked for his solo records, but none made it into Imperial Drag. Tim Smith formed Umajets and recorded the album &quot;Demolotion&quot; with help from Manning and Dover. It was released in late 1995 to little critical notice.

Sturmer retreated from the public eye, but continued working as a songwriter for cartoons such as &quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot;, &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, and &quot;Ben 10&quot;. In 2004, Falkner unexpectedly reconnected with Sturmer at a Los Angeles studio: &quot;He said he&#x27;d had a premonition that he was going to see me that day. Then he told me he was sorry for never having given me a chance. I was floored. We exchanged phone numbers, but neither of us has ever used them.&quot;

&quot;Fan Club&quot;, a four-CD box set, was released in 2002 by power pop label Not Lame Recordings. The set consists of demos, rarities, interview excerpts, and live performances. By the end of the year, the label had sold out three pressings of the set (8,000 copies). The set went out of print within months due to the expiration of the label&#x27;s rights to the Jellyfish catalog, making it a collector&#x27;s item.

In 2004 or 2005, Coachella organizers invited Manning to reunite Jellyfish for a one-off performance at the festival. Manning advised the organizers to consult Sturmer first. Sturmer, through his lawyer, responded he would not accept the offer regardless of any amount of money involved. In a 2008 interview, Manning stated: &quot;Except for Andy, we all speak to one another. [...] nobody is interested in working with Andy in a personal or creative capacity. It would serve no purpose, but I don’t say that with any animosity or sadness.&quot;

Manning and Falkner reteamed for the albums &quot;Logan&#x27;s Sanctuary&quot; (2000) and &quot;TV Eyes&quot; (2006), but neither were commercially successful. On July 25, 2008, Falkner joined Manning onstage for a performance of &quot;That Is Why&quot; at the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan. In January 2010, they performed a few shows as the opening act for Cheap Trick, playing solo and Jellyfish songs, and as members of Cheap Trick&#x27;s supporting band.

===2010s–present===
In 2011, Manning reached out to Sturmer via e-mail. Manning later commented: &quot;[I] felt it was long overdue. In doing some personal growth, I felt I had some amends to make with him that were going to be healing for myself and for both of us, ideally. I&#x27;m very happy I did that, and I think Andy was happy as well. He didn’t talk much about it afterwards. Just said, &#x27;Thank you very much for this.&#x27;&quot;

In January 2012, Omnivore Recordings reissued &quot;Bellybutton&quot; and &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; on limited-edition colored vinyl; the pressings sold out within days. In June, they followed with &quot;Live At Bogart&#x27;s&quot;, a complete 1991 performance that originally aired on Westwood One, then the Record Store Day release &quot;Stack-a-Tracks&quot;, containing the backing tracks of &quot;Bellybutton&quot; and &quot;Spilt Milk&quot;. In 2013, Omnivore issued &quot;Radio Jellyfish&quot;, a collection of 1993 radio performances in which the band played acoustically. In 2015, the label reissued expanded editions of &quot;Bellybutton&quot; and &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; that included many of the tracks previously released on &quot;Fan Club&quot;.

In 2016, Not Lame Media published the band&#x27;s first biography, &quot;Brighter Day: A Jellyfish Story&quot;, written by Craig Dorfman. Reviewing the book for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, Eric Rovie wrote that it was a &quot;balanced&quot; and &quot;well-researched&quot; work that presents the principal members &quot;in conflicting but complementary lights: brilliant, driven, and talented on the one hand, but also selfish, overly-introspective, and obnoxiously perfectionist in others. The music speaks for itself.&quot;

According to a journalist in 2015, Sturmer refuses interviews about his past or current work. However, Sturmer participated in interviews for &quot;Brighter Day&quot;. In a 2014 interview, Manning said that he had not talked to Sturmer in two decades, and ruled out the idea that he would ever write songs with him again. In 2015, he said that they did communicate, but only regarding business matters. Asked about the prospect of a reunion, he said he was uncertain of the possibility and explained: &quot;In general, I think it is lack of enough interest on Andy’s part. I know many people that work with him in film and TV always tell me how happy and successful he is. Last I heard he had four or five shows on Disney that he was scoring.&quot;

In 2017, Manning, Smith, and Dover reunited for a new band called the Lickerish Quartet. The musicians had not played together since 1994 and are scheduled to release three EPs from early 2020 to mid 2021. Sturmer was not offered to participate in the project. In a 2020 interview, Manning commented that Sturmer remains uninterested &quot;in any kind of post-Jellyfish activity, and that’s fine.&quot;

==Influences==
Jellyfish distinguished themselves from their peers by incorporating a wider variety of sounds and musical styles. Most of their influences were British. Sturmer and Manning shared an admiration for punk, progressive rock, reggae, fusion and for artists that included the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Harry Nilsson, Talking Heads, Cheap Trick, Peter Gabriel, Queen, and the Damned, in addition to jazz musicians such as Art Blakey, John Coltrane, the Jazz Messengers, Miles Davis, Elvin Jones, and Bill Evans. In a 1991 article about the Beatles&#x27; influence on new power pop bands, Sturmer commented: &quot;I was much more influenced by ELO and Cheap Trick. After a while I heard a Beatles album and thought, &#x27;Wow, what&#x27;s up here with these guys?&#x27; I kinda went about it backwards.&quot; Falkner&#x27;s inspirations overlapped with his bandmates and included The Fall, Magazine, The Monochrome Set, Yes, and UK. He was originally contacted by Manning specifically because he listed XTC as an influence in his newspaper ad.

Asked about Jellyfish&#x27;s musical influences, Manning answered: &quot;Britpop and post-punk was happening at the time. My jazz schooling helped me analyze the vocal harmonies and arrangements of The Carpenters and Fleetwood Mac and Burt Bacharach. I then applied that to what we were doing in Jellyfish.&quot; He stated that, even though their music was not often associated with jazz, their shared enthusiasm for the genre was significant, as &quot;it opens your ear to so many different kinds of harmony and so many arrangers and composers. Anybody who&#x27;s just well-rounded and studied has had a jazz background, just as they&#x27;ve studied the great classical composers&quot; However, he noted, &quot;Andy was a mad [Bob] Dylan and Van Morrison fan, and while I have respect for those artists, the songwriting didn’t speak to me.&quot; Manning&#x27;s original concept for the group was akin to the early multimedia crossovers of bands that turned into TV shows or vice versa: the Monkees, the Archies, the Partridge Family, and the Banana Splits. 

In response to the band frequently being compared to past acts, Sturmer said: &quot;There are certainly bits of what we do that people could go, &#x27;This sounds to me like that,&#x27; but I think that&#x27;s just a bit of a wank, frankly. [...] I think when things are referenced to death, it&#x27;s like trying to describe the color blue to a blind person.&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot; contributor Eric Bruce opined in 1990: &quot;It&#x27;s impossible not to hear Beatles and Beach Boys, especially, in the band&#x27;s music, with nods to Supertramp, Cheap Trick, Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan, 10cc, the Hollies, the Monkees, the Raspberries, Crowded House -- heck, just about every pop purveyor of above-average intelligence in the past 25 years&quot;. Similarly, Andy Edelstein of &quot;Newsday&quot; felt that their &quot;greatest influence seems to be the &#x27;70s groups who themselves were derivative of the mid-&#x27;60s British Invasion bands&quot;.

==Legacy==
Nielsen SoundScan listed the combined US sales of &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; and &quot;Bellybutton&quot; with 269,000 copies sold, although the number was likely higher, as Soundscan was launched a year after the release of &quot;Bellybutton&quot;. Music journalists generally praised Jellyfish at the time, albeit a recurring criticism was that the band&#x27;s music appeared too derivative. Later, journalists often used the group as a point of comparison to subsequent artists.

Since the breakup, the group has influenced numerous other acts, especially within the power pop genre. Their following also grew significantly. AllMusic&#x27;s James Christopher Morgan wrote that their influence extends to the Merrymakers, the Hutchinsons, the Excentrics, and Ben Folds Five, and added that the band &quot;secure[d] for themselves the same kind of cult status bestowed upon so many of their heroes.&quot; Writing for &quot;Louder Sound&quot; in 2015, Dave Everley attributed Jellyfish to have &quot;bridged the world of power-pop and progressive rock like no one before or since&quot;.

<text>The Ur-Hamlet (the German prefix &quot;&quot; means &quot;original&quot;) is a play by an unknown author, thought to be either Thomas Kyd or William Shakespeare. No copy of the play, dated by scholars to the second half of 1587, survives today. The play was staged in London, more specifically at The Theatre in Shoreditch as recalled by Elizabethan author Thomas Lodge. It includes a character named Hamlet; the only other known character from the play is a ghost who, according to Thomas Lodge in his 1596 publication &quot;Wits Misery and the Worlds Madnesse&quot;, cries &quot;Hamlet, revenge!&quot;

== Related writings ==
What relation the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot; bears to Shakespeare&#x27;s more commonly known play &quot;Hamlet&quot; is unclear: it may contain events supposed to have occurred before Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy or it may be an early version of that play; the First Quarto in particular is thought perhaps to have been influenced by the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot;.

==Authorship theories==
Thomas Nashe, in his introduction to Robert Greene&#x27;s &quot;Menaphon&quot; (1589), writes in a riddling way that seems to leave clues regarding the identity of playwrights who have left the trade of noverint (lawyer&#x27;s clerk) to turn to writing, and who are being influenced by the Roman playwright Seneca, who &quot;if you entreat him fair in a frosty morning, he will afford you whole Hamlets...&quot; Nashe then writes that his followers are like the &quot;kid&quot; in Aesop. The reference to &quot;Hamlets&quot; vouches for the idea that a Hamlet-play existed as early as 1589. These references and similarities between Thomas Kyd&#x27;s &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; are interpreted by many scholars as an indication that Kyd, who was a noverint, a Seneca-influenced playwright, and whose name is a homophone of Aesop&#x27;s &quot;kid&quot;, might be the author of the &quot;Hamlet&quot; that Nashe mentions.

Some suggest that the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot; is an early version of Shakespeare&#x27;s own play, pointing to the survival of Shakespeare&#x27;s version in three quite different early texts, Q1 (1603), Q2 (1604) and F (1623), and offer the possibility that the play was revised by the author over a period of many years. While the exact relationship of the short and apparently primitive text of Q1 to the later published texts is not resolved, Hardin Craig has suggested that it may represent an earlier draft of the play and hence would confirm that the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot; is in fact merely an earlier draft of Shakespeare&#x27;s play. This view is held in some form or another by Harold Bloom, Peter Alexander, and Andrew Cairncross, who stated, &quot;It may be assumed, until a new case can be shown to the contrary, that Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and no other is the play mentioned by Nashe in 1589 and Henslowe in 1594&quot;. Harold Jenkins, in his 1982 Arden edition, disagrees with this position.

Eric Sams&#x27;s &quot;The Real Shakespeare&quot; argues that Shakespeare might steal phrases and rarely whole lines from other playwrights, but not entire theatrical treatments; and would not, at such length, have &quot;plagiarized a known and named colleague [i.e. Kyd], least of all without a word of comment, let alone censure, from any of his critics.&quot; Sams analyzes the most detailed account of the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot;, by Nashe in &quot;Menaphon&quot; in 1589, and sees Nashe&#x27;s remarks as part of a pattern of jealous attacks upon Shakespeare (and Kyd) by their university-educated rivals. Citing Nashe&#x27;s reference to &quot;if you entreat him fair in a frosty morning, he will afford you whole Hamlets, I should say handfuls, of tragical speeches,&quot; Sams argues that this &quot;manifestly defines the first scene of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (&#x27;tis bitter cold I.i.8),&quot; and evokes the touchy yet voluble Ghost of Hamlet Senior (a role that Shakespeare himself is said to have played). Similarly, Lodge&#x27;s 1596 reference to the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot;″s ghost &quot;who cried so miserably at the Theatre, like an oyster-wife, Hamlet, revenge!&quot; was &quot;surely intended as an affront to the author and actor of that role&quot;. Summing up, Sams offers a list of 18 reasons for his belief that the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot; was Shakespeare&#x27;s earliest version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

In questions regarding Shakespeare as a possible revisor of an earlier version (or versions) of the Hamlet myth – such as the French version of Belleforest, or the Latin version of Saxo Grammaticus – the idea of Shakespeare as translator is often neglected. Margrethe Jolly&#x27;s 2014 book &quot;The First Two Quartos of Hamlet&quot;, speaking of the first three printed texts of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, argued that &quot;the sequence and evidence that the three texts provide suggests that Shakespeare had access to the French source and Q1 when he redrafted&quot;.

In 2016, Professor Terri Bourus, one of three general editors of the New Oxford Shakespeare, in her paper &quot;Enter Shakespeare&#x27;s Young Hamlet, 1589&quot; suggests that Shakespeare was &quot;interested in sixteenth-century French literature, from the very beginning of his career&quot; and therefore &quot;did not need Thomas Kyd to pre-digest Belleforest&#x27;s histoire of Amleth and spoon-feed it to him&quot;. She considers that the hypothesized &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot; is Shakespeare&#x27;s Q1 text, and that this derived directly from Belleforest&#x27;s French version. Elsewhere Bourus, after referring to Goethe&#x27;s &quot;UrFaust&quot; or original version of &quot;Faust&quot;, argues that, &quot;Like &quot;Faust&quot;…&quot;Hamlet&quot; was repeatedly revised by its author. As &quot;Faust&quot; matured with Goethe, &quot;Hamlet&quot; matured with Shakespeare. It matters so much to us, in part, because it mattered so much to him.&quot;

In 2019, Jennifer E. Nicholson, in her University of Sydney PhD thesis, reinforced this view, offering independent evidence from each of the three printed &quot;Hamlet&quot;s, that Shakespeare was responding creatively to subtle hints in Belleforest&#x27;s French text, and deriving some of his more famous lines, including perhaps the famous &quot;arras&quot; in the stage directions of Act 3 Scene 4, from them. She too contends that, &quot;There is no need for a &#x27;middle man&#x27; author for &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot;, and no need for an &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot; separate from Shakespeare&#x27;s own play text.&quot;

<doc id="310722" wikidata="Q6411846" url="?curid=310722" title="King Leir">
<text>King Leir is an anonymous Elizabethan play about the life of the ancient Brythonic king Leir of Britain. It was published in 1605 but was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 15 May 1594. The play has attracted critical attention principally for its relationship with &quot;King Lear&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s version of the same story.

==Performance==
The records of theatre impresario Philip Henslowe show that &quot;King Leir&quot; was performed on 6 and 8 April 1594 at the Rose Theatre, by a cast that combined personnel from two acting companies, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Men and Sussex&#x27;s Men. Other records claim that the play was often acted, though these two are the only specific performances known. It has been suggested that Shakespeare, who might have been a player in the Queen&#x27;s company of the 1590s, may have performed in &quot;King Leir&quot;.

==Publication==
&quot;The moste famous Chronicle historye of Leire king of England and his Three Daughters&quot; was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 14 May 1594, by stationer Adam Islip; but Islip&#x27;s name is crossed out of the record and the name of fellow stationer Edward White is substituted. Perhaps this conflict between stationers prevented the play&#x27;s publication in 1594; certainly it did not appear in print until the next decade. It was registered again on 8 May 1605 (as &quot;the Tragecall historie of kinge Leir and his Three Daughters &amp;c&quot;) by stationer Simon Stafford. The first edition appeared later that year, printed by Stafford for the bookseller John Wright, with the title &quot;The true Chronicle History of King Leir and his three daughters, Gonorill, Ragan and Cordella&quot;. The title page states that the drama &quot;hath been diverse and sundry times lately acted&quot;. The 1605 quarto was the sole edition of the play during the 17th century.

==Authorship==
There is no consensus of scholarly opinion on the authorship of &quot;King Leir&quot;. The play has been variously attributed to Thomas Kyd, Robert Greene, George Peele, Thomas Lodge, Anthony Munday, and Shakespeare himself.

==Sources==
The author drew primarily on Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot; for the story of Leir and his daughters. Other sources and influences include Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, &quot;The Mirror for Magistrates&quot;, William Warner&#x27;s &quot;Albion&#x27;s England&quot;, and Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;.

In turn, critics widely agree that &quot;King Leir&quot; served as a primary source for Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;.

==Genre==
&quot;King Leir&quot; has been called a &quot;chronicle history&quot;, a &quot;tragical history&quot;, a &quot;tragicomedy&quot;, and even &quot;a tragedy with a happy ending&quot;. (Leir is alive and restored to his kingship at the end of his play.) &quot;Leir&quot; does not contain the subplot about Gloucester, Edgar, and Edmund that Shakespeare added to the story.

==The Annesley case==
Some commentators have argued that &quot;King Leir&quot; was printed in 1605 to take advantage of the attention drawn by Shakespeare&#x27;s similar play – which would mean that Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Lear&quot; was being acted in 1605. Yet &quot;a remarkable historical parallel&quot; provided &quot;a topical reason&quot; for the publication of &quot;Leir&quot;, and perhaps also for Shakespeare&#x27;s interest in the story c. 1605.

A true-life scandal with noteworthy parallels to the Leir/Lear story was in the news in 1603 and 1604, and may have helped to inspire both Shakespeare&#x27;s play and the publication of the old play &quot;King Leir&quot;. Brian Annesley (or Anslowe) was an elderly former follower of Queen Elizabeth, a wealthy Kentishman with three daughters: Grace (married to Sir John Wildgose), Christian (the wife of William Sandys, 3rd Baron Sandys), and the youngest, the unmarried Cordell, who had been a maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth. In 1603, Grace tried to have her father declared senile and incompetent to manage his estate. Cordell wrote to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, to protest her older sister&#x27;s action, and otherwise supported her father against his eldest daughter. Brian Annesley died in July 1604; Cordell successfully defended her father&#x27;s last will and testament, which left most of the family property to Cordell.

One of the executors of the will was Sir William Hervey; he was a veteran of the 1588 campaign against the Spanish Armada and the third husband of the Dowager Countess of Southampton, the mother of Shakespeare&#x27;s patron Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. (Hervey is also one of the many proposed candidates for the &quot;W. H.&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets.) Once the Dowager Countess died in 1607, Hervey married Cordell Annesley.

<doc id="310723" wikidata="Q275647" url="?curid=310723" title="Mannheim school">
<text>Mannheim school refers to both the orchestral techniques pioneered by the court orchestra of the Elector Palatine in Mannheim in the latter half of the 18th century and the group of composers of the early classical period, who composed for the orchestra of Mannheim. The father of the school is considered to be the Bohemian composer Johann Stamitz. Besides him, two generations of composers wrote compositions for the orchestra, whose reputation was due to its excellent discipline and the individual skill of its players; the English traveler Charles Burney called it &quot;an army of generals&quot;. Their performance style included new dynamic elements, crescendos and diminuendos. Composers of the Mannheim school played an important role in the development of the classical period&#x27;s genres and of the classical symphony form.

==History==
The origins of the Mannheim school go back to the court of the Elector Charles III Philip, who moved from Heidelberg to Mannheim in 1720, already employing an orchestra larger than those of any of the surrounding courts. The orchestra grew even further in the following decades and came to include some of the best virtuosi of the time. Under the guidance of Kapellmeister Carlo Grua, the court hired such talents as Johann Stamitz, who is generally considered to be the founder of the Mannheim school, in 1741/42, and he became its director in 1750.

The most notable of the revolutionary techniques of the Mannheim orchestra were its more independent treatment of the wind instruments, and its famous whole-orchestra &quot;crescendo&quot;. Contemporary musicians mentioned the high level of the orchestra, among them, Leopold Mozart in 1763, and W. A. Mozart in his letters in 1777/78, and the English music historian Charles Burney.

The role of the Mannheim school&#x27;s composers in the evolution of the classical symphony is thus significant, although most scholars now agree that these changes occurred nearly simultaneously at various other centers, e.g. in Berlin and Vienna. Their influence on the evolution of the classical music period is due to the reputation of the ensemble at one hand, and on the other hand to the fact that the compositions of the Mannheim school&#x27;s composers were published in Paris and London.

==Composers==

Members of the Mannheim school included Johann Stamitz, Franz Xaver Richter, Ignaz Holzbauer, Carl Stamitz, Franz Ignaz Beck, Ignaz Fränzl, and Christian Cannabich, and it had a very direct influence on many major symphonists of the time, including Joseph Haydn and Leopold Hofmann. (Cannabich, one of the directors of the orchestra after the death of J. Stamitz, was also a good friend of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart from the latter&#x27;s visit to Mannheim in 1777 onwards.)

Johann Stamitz visited Paris, and the Mannheim school had an influence on the Concert Spirituel Sacred Concert since 1754. When Joseph Legros took over the Parisian concert series Concert Spirituel, the relationship with the Mannheim School flourished and the music of Haydn became extremely popular in Paris. Prominent concerts in Paris during the 1770s were the Concert de la Loge Olympique (Concert of the Olympic Lodge) and the Concert des Amateurs (Concert for the Fans) which may have been part of the Concert Spirituel.

Claude-François-Marie Rigoley (the Comte d&#x27;Ogny) commissioned Joseph Haydn&#x27;s six &quot;Paris Symphonies&quot;, Nr. 82–87, for performance by Concert de la Loge Olympique. Chevalier de Saint-Georges conducted their world premiere. The influence of the Mannheim school is evident in these symphonies.

==Musical innovations==

Composers of the Mannheim school introduced a number of novel ideas into the orchestral music of their day: sudden crescendos – the &quot;Mannheim Crescendo&quot; (a crescendo developed via the whole orchestra) – and diminuendos; crescendos with piano releases; the &quot;Mannheim Rocket&quot; (a swiftly ascending passage typically having a rising arpeggiated melodic line together with a crescendo); the &quot;Mannheim Roller&quot; (an extended crescendo passage typically having a rising melodic line over an ostinato bass line); the &quot;Mannheim Sigh&quot; (a mannered treatment of the Baroque practice of putting more weight on the first of two notes in descending pairs of slurred notes); the &quot;Mannheim Birds&quot; (imitation of birds chirping in solo passages); the &quot;Mannheim Climax &quot;(a high-energy section of music where all instruments drop out except for the strings, usually preceded by a &quot;Mannheim Crescendo&quot;); and the &quot;Grand Pause&quot; where the playing stops for a moment, resulting in total silence, only to restart vigorously. The &quot;Mannheim Rocket&quot; can be a rapidly ascending broken chord from the lowest range of the bass line to the very top of the soprano line. Its influence can be found at the beginning of the fourth movement of Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 40 and the start of &quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot;, and the very start of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 1 in F minor, Op. 2, No. 1.

Members of the Mannheim school abandoned quickly the praxis of the basso continuo in their compositions, which was almost universal in the Baroque era, and they used the minimum of contrapuntal elaboration. One of their chief innovations is the four-movement symphony form, introducing the menuet as its third movement, which was originally one of the Baroque suite&#x27;s movements. The Mannheim school played an important role in the development of the sonata form, which is generally the form of the classical symphony&#x27;s first movement. In their orchestration practice, the clarinet appears both as part of the woodwind section and as a solo instrument.

<doc id="310724" wikidata="Q4761369" url="?curid=310724" title="Andy Sturmer">
<text>Marvin Andrew Sturmer (born March 11, 1965) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and composer who co-founded the rock band Jellyfish in 1989. He was the group&#x27;s lead vocalist, drummer, and primary songwriter. Following their break-up in 1994, Sturmer became involved with Tamio Okuda, as writer and producer for the Japanese pop duo Puffy AmiYumi. Although Sturmer maintains a low public profile, he continues working as a songwriter for cartoons produced by Disney and Cartoon Network.

== Jellyfish ==
Sturmer attended Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton, California in the 1970s. There, he was a drummer in the school&#x27;s jazz band, and met keyboardist Roger Manning. Manning recalled of Sturmer: &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen anyone of his age with that expertise and command of his instrument. Andy was one of the first kids in our town who took it seriously and had a goal. He was my hero.&quot; They later joined the group Beatnik Beatch. When the band dissolved in 1988, Sturmer and Manning formed Jellyfish.

Jellyfish released two albums, &quot;Bellybutton&quot; (1990) and &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; (1993). Sturmer wrote all of the lyrics, but composed the music with Manning. He had the rare distinction of not only being a drummer who regularly sang lead in a rock group, but also one who played a stand-up drum set at the front of the stage instead of sitting on a throne at the rear of the band. While their records earned critical praise and they toured the world several times, Jellyfish failed to meet commercial expectations, and intra-group friction led to Jellyfish&#x27;s dissolution in early 1994.

In a May 1994 article published in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, it was reported that Sturmer and Manning would form new bands in the aftermath of Jellyfish. Sturmer nearly released a solo album on Virgin Records before deciding against the proposal. Manning later said, &quot;It was a surprise to me that Andy chose the route he did. I felt sure he&#x27;d make solo albums of his own material, like [one unreleased] ballad he played me. That was a brilliant song and the world should hear it.&quot; Elsewhere, Manning attributed the break-up partly to Sturmer&#x27;s discomfort as frontman: &quot;Andy never wanted to be in the spotlight, but he was never honest with himself. With Jellyfish, he couldn&#x27;t have been in more foreign territory.&quot;

==Puffy AmiYumi and other work==

Sturmer subsequently devoted his career to producing and writing for other artists. Among his first projects was the Japanese pop duo Puffy (known as Puffy AmiYumi outside of Japan). He was already a friend of main Puffy composer and producer Tamio Okuda and was credited as &quot;godfather&quot; of the band for giving the group their name. Sturmer also worked with the Swedish pop band the Merrymakers, who tracked him down through the Internet. He ultimately played all the drums on their 1997 album &quot;Bubblegun&quot; and co-produced four tracks.

Puffy were approached by Cartoon Network to sing the theme song for the 2003 animated series &quot;Teen Titans&quot;. Originally suggested by the series&#x27; producer Sam Register, creator Glen Murakami was delighted when he learned Sturmer would be writing and producing the track. In 2004, Sturmer also became the consulting producer and theme song composer for the cartoon &quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot;. After composing and producing most of the songs on Puffy AmiYumi&#x27;s &quot;Nice.&quot; (2003) and &quot;59&quot; (2004), his involvement with the band lessened.

Following his work on &quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot;, Sturmer composed theme songs for other Cartoon Network series, including &quot;Ben 10&quot; (alongside its score composition), &quot;&quot;, and the third season of &quot;The Batman&quot; animated series. He also composed the score and wrote the songs for the Disney series &quot;My Friends Tigger &amp; Pooh&quot; and performed the theme song for &quot;Transformers Animated&quot;. In 2006, he worked with Mike Viola on the album &quot;Alpacas Orgling&quot; (credited to LEO).

In the liner notes for the 2002 Jellyfish box set &quot;Fan Club&quot;, it is stated that Sturmer had been planning &quot;an imminent solo record to be released over the Internet.&quot; In 2015, a journalist reported that Sturmer had refused all requests for interviews about his past or current work, although Sturmer agreed to be interviewed for the 2016 book &quot;Brighter Day: A Jellyfish Story&quot;. Also in 2015, Manning commented in an interview that the reason Jellyfish has never reunited was mostly due to Sturmer&#x27;s &quot;lack of interest&quot;. He added: &quot;I know many people that work with him in film and TV always tell me how happy and successful he is. Last I heard he had four or five shows on Disney that he was scoring.&quot;

<text>Sir Granville Ransome Bantock (7 August 186816 October 1946) was a British composer of classical music.

==Biography==

Granville Ransome Bantock was born in London. His father was an eminent Scottish surgeon. His younger brother was the dramatist and film director Leedham Bantock. Granville Bantock was intended by his parents for the Indian Civil Service but he suffered poor health and initially turned to chemical engineering. At the age of 20, when he began studying composers&#x27; manuscripts, at South Kensington Museum Library, he was drawn into the musical world. 

His first teacher was Gordon Saunders at Trinity College of Music. In 1888, he entered the Royal Academy of Music where he studied harmony and composition with Frederick Corder winning the Macfarren Prize in the first year it was awarded.

Early conducting engagements took him around the world with a musical comedy troupe. With his brother Leedham Bantock he wrote a couple of music hall songs which met with some success. He founded a music magazine, &quot;The New Quarterly Music Review&quot;, but this lasted only a few years. In 1897, he became conductor at the New Brighton Tower concerts, where he promoted the works of Joseph Holbrooke, Frederic Hymen Cowen, Charles Steggall, Edward German, Hubert Parry, Charles Villiers Stanford, Corder and others, frequently devoting whole concerts to a single composer. He was also conductor of the Liverpool Orchestral Society with which he premiered Delius&#x27;s &quot;Brigg Fair&quot; on 18 January 1908. He became the principal of the Birmingham and Midland Institute school of music in 1900. He was a close friend of fellow composer Havergal Brian. He was Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham from 1908 to 1934 (in which post he succeeded Sir Edward Elgar). In 1934, he was elected Chairman of the Corporation of Trinity College of Music in London. He was knighted in 1930. His students included Anthony Bernard, Lilian Elkington, Eric Fogg and Dorothy Howell.

He was influential in the founding of the City of Birmingham orchestra (later the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra), whose first performance in September 1920 was of his overture &quot;Saul&quot;. Bantock&#x27;s &quot;Hebridean Symphony&quot; was recorded by the CBO on 28 January 1925 at Riley Hall, Constitution Hill, Birmingham. This acoustic version, conducted by Adrian Boult, was never released.

His music was influenced by folk song of the Hebrides (as in his 1915 &quot;Hebridean Symphony&quot;) and the works of Richard Wagner. Many of his works have an &quot;exotic&quot; element, including the choral epic &quot;Omar Khayyám&quot; (1906–09). Among his other better-known works are the overture &quot;The Pierrot of the Minute&quot; (1908) and the &quot;Pagan Symphony&quot; (1928). Many of his works have been commercially recorded since the early 1990s.

From 1926 to 1933 his Birmingham home was Metchley Lodge (now Metchley Abbey; despite the name, the building has no religious connection), which a Birmingham Civic Society blue plaque on the building records.

Shortly after the composer&#x27;s death in London, in 1946, a Bantock Society was established. Its first president was Jean Sibelius, whose music Bantock championed during the early years of the century. Sibelius dedicated his Third Symphony to Bantock.

Edward Elgar dedicated the second of his &quot;Pomp and Circumstance Marches&quot; to Bantock.

In 1898 he married Helena von Schweitzer (1868–1961) who acted as a librettist for him.
Granville Bantock was also the father-in-law of the composer Margaret More (1903-1966) via her marriage to Granville&#x27;s son, Raymond Bantock. Their son, Granville Bantock&#x27;s grandson, is Gavin Bantock, a poet.

==Bibliography==
Four biographies have been published on Granville Bantock. The first was authored by his long-time friend and &#x27;secretary&#x27;, &#x27;Colonel&#x27; H. O. Anderton for the &quot;Living Masters of Music&quot; series in 1915. A brief pamphlet (with a portrait) by King Palmer, part of the Paxton Miniature Biographies series, appeared in 1947. A &#x27;personal portrait&#x27; of Bantock by his daughter was published by Dent in 1972. It is an engaging read and contains a number of photographs. &quot;An Introduction to the Life and Work of Sir Granville Bantock&quot; by Vincent Budd, was published in 2000 by Gnosis Press. It is also illustrated and contains a discographical guide. A larger volume is in progress. In addition to these there is a doctoral thesis by Trevor Bray - &quot;Granville Bantock: his life and music&quot; - submitted in 1972 to Cambridge University. An extract was published by the Triad Press the following year.

In 2020 J.C. Dressler published &quot;Granville Bantock (1868–1946): a Guide to Research&quot; (Clemson University Press/Liverpool University Press). This collects together all the primary and secondary sources, including an extensive worklist and discography.

== Discography ==
A broad selection of Bantock&#x27;s orchestral output, including all the symphonies, has been recorded in an edition by the Hyperion label in performances with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Vernon Handley, now available also as a box set. Handley also recorded a largely complete performance of &quot;Omar Khayyám&quot; with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus on the Chandos label. However, the only complete recording is available on the Lyrita Recorded Edition label. An alternative recording of the &quot;Hebridean Symphony&quot; (together with the &quot;Old English Suite&quot; and &quot;Russian Scenes&quot;) is available on the Naxos label, with the Czechoslovak Philharmonic Orchestra (Košice) conducted by Adrian Leaper. Historic recordings of miniatures and songs have appeared on the Dutton label. The Cameo Classics label has re-issued its Granville Bantock recordings made with conductor Geoffrey Heald-Smith from 1978 to 1982 on a double CD set, which includes the &quot;Hebridean Symphony&quot; (in the presence of Raymond Bantock), the &quot;Pagan Symphony&quot; and &quot;Witch of Atlas&quot; (the first digital recordings), and the &quot;Sapphic Poem&quot; (solo cello, Gillian Thoday).

<text>The Cangjie input method (Tsang-chieh input method, sometimes called Changjie, Cang Jie, Changjei or Chongkit) is a system for entering Chinese characters into a computer using a standard computer keyboard. In filenames and elsewhere, the name Cangjie is sometimes abbreviated as cj.

The input method was invented in 1976 by Chu Bong-Foo, and named after Cangjie (Tsang-chieh), the mythological inventor of the Chinese writing system, at the suggestion of Chiang Wei-kuo, the former Defense Minister of Taiwan. Chu Bong-Foo released the patent for Cangjie in 1982, as he thought that the method should belong to Chinese cultural heritage. Therefore, Cangjie has become open-source software and is on every computer system that supports traditional Chinese characters, and it has been extended so that Cangjie is compatible with the simplified Chinese character set.

Cangjie is the first Chinese input method to use the QWERTY keyboard. Chu saw that the QWERTY keyboard had become an international standard, and therefore believed that Chinese-language input had to be based on it. Other, earlier methods use large keyboards with 40 to 2400 keys, except the Four-Corner Method, which uses only number keys.

Unlike the Pinyin input method, Cangjie is based on the graphological aspect of the characters: each graphical unit, called a &quot;radical&quot; (not to be confused with Kangxi radicals), is re-parented by a basic character component, 24 in total, each mapped to a particular letter key on a standard QWERTY keyboard. An additional &quot;difficult character&quot; function is mapped to the X key. Keys are categorized into four groups, to facilitate learning and memorization. Assigning codes to Chinese characters is done by separating the constituent &quot;radicals&quot; of the characters.

==Overview==

===Keys and &quot;radicals&quot;===
The basic character components in Cangjie are called &quot;radicals&quot; () or &quot;letters&quot; (). There are 24 radicals but 26 keys; the 24 radicals (the basic shapes ) are associated with roughly 76 auxiliary shapes (), which in many cases are either rotated or transposed versions of components of the basic shapes. For instance, the letter A () can represent either itself, the slightly wider , or a 90° rotation of itself. (For a more complete account of the 76-odd transpositions and rotations than the ones listed below, see the .)

The 24 keys are placed in four groups:

* Philosophical Group — corresponds to the letters &#x27;A&#x27; to &#x27;G&#x27; and represents the sun, the moon, and the five elements
* Strokes Group — corresponds to the letters &#x27;H&#x27; to &#x27;N&#x27; and represents the brief and subtle strokes
* Body-Related Group — corresponds to the letters &#x27;O&#x27; to &#x27;R&#x27; and represents various parts of the human anatomy
* Shapes Group — corresponds to the letters &#x27;S&#x27; to &#x27;Y&#x27; and represents complex and enclosed character forms

The auxiliary shapes of each Cangjie radical have changed slightly across different versions of the Cangjie method. Thus, this is one reason that different versions of the Cangjie method are not completely compatible.

Chu Bong-Foo has provided alternate names for some letters according to their characteristics. For example, H () is also called , which means slant. The names form a rhyme to help learners memorize the letters, each group being in a line (the sounds of final characters are given in parentheses):

===Basic rules===
The typist must be familiar with several decomposition rules () that define how to analyze a character to arrive at a Cangjie code.
* Direction of decomposition: left to right, top to bottom, and outside to inside
* Geometrically connected forms: take four Cangjie codes, namely the first, second, third, and last codes
* Geometrically unconnected forms that can be broken into two subforms (e.g., ): identify the two geometrically connected subforms according to the direction of decomposition rules (i.e., and ), then take the first and last codes of the first subform and the first, second, and last code of the second subform.
* Geometrically unconnected forms that can be broken into multiple subforms (e.g., ): identify the first geometrically connected subform according to the direction of decomposition rules (i.e., ) and take the first and last codes of that form. Next, break the remainder (i.e., ) into subforms (i.e., and ) and take the first and last codes of the first subform and the last code of the last subform.

The rules are subject to various principles:
* Conciseness () – if multiple ways of decomposition are possible, the shorter decomposition is considered to be correct.
* Completeness () – if multiple ways of decomposition with the same length of code are possible, the one that identifies a more complex form first is the correct decomposition.
* Reflection of the form of the radical () – the decomposition should reflect the shape of the radical, meaning (a) using the same code twice or more should be avoided if possible, and (b) the shape of the character should not be &quot;cut&quot; at a corner in the form.
* Omission of codes ()
** Partial omission () – when the number of codes in a complete decomposition exceeds the permitted number of codes, the extra codes are ignored.
** Omission in enclosed forms () – when part of the character to be decomposed and the form is an enclosed form, only the shape of the enclosure is decomposed; the enclosed forms are omitted.

===Examples===
* 
** This character is geometrically connected, consisting of a single vertical structure, so we take the first, second, and last Cangjie codes from top to bottom.
** The Cangjie code is thus (JWJ), corresponding to the basic shapes of the codes in this example.
** This character consists of geometrically unconnected parts arranged horizontally. For the initial decomposition, we treat it as two parts, and .
** The first part, , is geometrically unconnected from top to bottom; we take the first (, auxiliary shape of Y) and last parts (, basic shape of R) and arrive at (YR).
** The second part is again geometrically unconnected, arranged horizontally. The two parts are and .
*** For the first part of this second part, , we take the first and last codes. Both are slants and therefore H; the first and last codes are thus (HH).
*** For the second part of the original second part, , we take only the last part. Because this is geometrically unconnected and consists of two parts, the first part is the outer form while the second part is the dot in the middle. The dot is I, and therefore the last code is (I).
** The Cangjie code is thus (YR) (HH) (I), or (YRHHI).
* (simplified version of )
** This example is identical to the example just above, except that the first part is ; the first and last codes are (I) and (V).
** Repeating the same steps as in the above example, we get (IV) (HH) (I), or (IVHHI).

===Exceptions===
Some forms are always decomposed in the same way, whether the rules say they should be decomposed this way or not. The number of such exceptions is small:
Some forms cannot be decomposed. They are represented by an X, which is the key on a Cangjie keyboard.
==Early development==
Initially, the Cangjie input method was not intended to produce a character in any character set. Instead, it was part of an integrated system consisting of the Cangjie input &quot;rules&quot; and a Cangjie &quot;controller board&quot;. This controller board contains character generator firmware, which dynamically generates Chinese characters from Cangjie codes when characters are &quot;output&quot;, using the hi-res graphics mode of the Apple II. In the preface of the Cangjie user&#x27;s manual, Chu Bong-Foo wrote in 1982:

In this early system, when the user types &quot;yk&quot;, for example, to get the Chinese character , the Cangjie codes do not get converted to any character encoding and the actual string &quot;yk&quot; is stored. The Cangjie code for each character (a string of 1 to 5 lowercase letters plus a space) the encoding of that particular character.

A particular &quot;feature&quot; of this early system is that, if one sends random lowercase words to it, the character generator will attempt to construct Chinese characters according to the Cangjie decomposition rules, sometimes causing strange, unknown characters to appear. This unintended feature, &quot;automatic generation of characters&quot;, is described in the manual and is responsible for producing more than 10,000 of the 15,000 characters that the system can handle. The name Cangjie, evocative of the creation of new characters, was indeed apt for this early version of Cangjie.

The presence of the integrated character generator also explains the historical necessity for the existence of the &quot;X&quot; key, which is used for the disambiguation of decomposition collisions: because characters are &quot;chosen&quot; when the codes are &quot;output&quot;, every character that can be displayed must in fact have a unique Cangjie decomposition. It would not make sense—nor would it be practical—for the system to provide a choice of candidate characters when a random text file is displayed, as the user would not know which of the candidates is correct.

==Issues==
Cangjie was designed to be an easy-to-use system to help promote the use of Chinese computing. However, many users find Cangjie is difficult to learn and use, with many difficulties caused by poor instruction.

===Perceived difficulties===
* In order to input using Cangjie, knowledge of both the names of the radicals as well as their auxiliary shapes is required. It is common to find tables of the Cangjie radicals with their auxiliary shapes taped onto the monitors of computer users.
* One must also be familiar with the decomposition rules, lack of knowledge of which results in increased difficulty in typing the intended characters.
* The user cannot type a character that they have forgotten how to write (a problem with all non-phonetic based input methods).
With enough practice, users can overcome the above problems. Typical touch-typists can type Chinese at 25 characters per minute (cpm), or better, using Cangjie, despite having difficulty remembering the list of auxiliary shapes or the decomposition rules. Experienced Cangjie typists can reportedly attain a typing speed from 60 cpm to over 200 cpm.

According to Chen Minzheng, his teaching experience at Longtian Elementary School in Taitung in 1990, the average typing speed of children was 90 words per minute, and some children even reached more than 130 words per minute.

=== Limitations in implementation ===
The decomposition of a character depends on a predefined set of &quot;standard shapes&quot; (). However, as many variations of Cangjie exist in different countries, the standard shape of a certain character in Cangjie is not always the one the user has learnt before. Learning Cangjie then entails learning not only Cangjie itself but also unfamiliar standard shapes for some characters. The Cangjie input method editor (IME) does not handle mistakes in decomposition except by informing the user (usually by beeping) that there is a mistake. However, Cangjie is originally designed to assign different codes to different variants of a character. For example, in the Cangjie provided on Windows, the code for is YHHQM, which corresponds not to the shape of this character but to another variant, . This is a problem resulting from the implementation of Cangjie on Windows. In the original Cangjie, should be YKMHM (the first part is ) while is YHHQM (the first part is ).

Punctuation marks are not geometrically decomposed, but rather given predefined codes that begin with ZX followed by a string of three letters related to the ordering of the characters in the Big5 code. (This set of codes was added to Cangjie on the traditional Chinese version of Windows 95. On Windows 3.1, Cangjie did not have a set of codes for punctuation marks.) Typing punctuation marks in Cangjie thus becomes a frustrating exercise involving either memorization or pick-and-peck. However, this is solved on modern systems through accessing a virtual keyboard on screen (On Windows, this is activated by pressing Ctrl + Alt + comma key).

Commonly-made errors include not considered as alternative codes. For example, if one does not decompose from top to bottom into YHS, but instead type YSH according to stroke order, Cangjie does not return the character as a choice.

Since Cangjie requires all 26 keys of the QWERTY keyboard, it cannot be used to input Chinese characters on feature phones, which have only a 12-key keypad. Alternative input methods, such as Zhuyin, 5-stroke (or 9-stroke by Motorola), and the Q9 input method, are used instead.

==Versions==
The Cangjie input method is commonly said to have gone through five generations (commonly referred to as &quot;versions&quot; in English), each of which is slightly incompatible with the others. Currently, version 3 () is the most common and supported natively by Microsoft Windows. Version 5 (), supported by the Free Cangjie IME and previously the only Cangjie supported by SCIM, represents a significant minority method and is supported by iOS.

The early Cangjie system supported by the Zero One card on the Apple II was Version 2; Version 1 was never released.

The Cangjie input method supported on the classic Mac OS resembles both Version 3 and Version 5.

Version 5, like the original Cangjie input method, was created directly by Chu. He had hoped that the release of Version 5, originally slated to be Version 6, would bring an end to the &quot;more than ten versions of Cangjie input method&quot; (slightly incompatible versions created by different vendors).

Version 6 has not yet been released to the public, but is being used to create a database which can accurately store every historical Chinese text.

==Variants==
Most modern implementations of Cangjie input method editors (IME) provide various convenient features:
* Some IMEs list all characters beginning with the code you have typed. For example, if you type A, the system gives you all characters whose Cangjie code begins with A, so that you can select the correct character if it is on the screen; if you type another A, the list is shortened to give all characters whose code begins with AA. Examples of such implementations include the IME in Mac OS X, and the Smart Common Input Method (SCIM).
* Some IMEs provide one or more wildcard keys, usually but not always * and/or ?, that allow the user to omit part(s) of the Cangjie code; the system will display a list of matching characters for the user to choose. Examples include the X window Chinese INput XIM server (xcin), the Smart Common Input Method (SCIM), and the IME of the Founder Group (University of Peking) typesetting systems. Microsoft Windows&#x27;s standard &quot;Changjie&quot; IME allows * to substitute for in-between characters (effectively reducing it to Simplified Cangjie entries), while the &quot;New Changjie&quot; IME allows * as a wildcard anywhere except for the first character.
* Some IMEs provide an &quot;abbreviation&quot; feature, where impossible Cangjie codes are interpreted as abbreviations for the Cangjie codes of more than one character. This allows more characters to be input with fewer keys. An example is the Smart Common Input Method (SCIM).
* Some IMEs provide an &quot;association&quot; ( lianxiang) feature, where the system anticipates what you are going to type next, and provides you with a list of characters or even phrases associated with what the user has typed. An example is the Microsoft &quot;Changjie&quot; IME.
* Some IMEs present the list of candidate characters differently, depending on the frequency of character use (how often that character has been typed by the user). An example is the Cangjie IME in the NJStar Chinese word processor.

Besides the wildcard key, many of these features are convenient for casual users but unsuitable for touch-typists because they make the Cangjie IME unpredictable.

There have also been various attempts to &quot;simplify&quot; Cangjie one way or another:
* Simplified Cangjie, also known as quick, or , has the same radicals, auxiliary shapes, decomposition rules, and short list of exceptions as Cangjie, but only the first and last codes are used if more than two codes are required in Cangjie.

== Applications ==
Many researchers have discussed ways to decompose Chinese characters into their major components, and tried to build applications based on the decomposition system. The idea can be referred to as the study of the . Cangjie codes offer a basis for such an endeavour. Academia Sinica in Taiwan and Jiaotong University in Shanghai have similar projects as well.

One direct application of the use of decomposed characters is the possibility of computing the similarities between different Chinese characters. The Cangjie input method offers a good starting point for this kind of application. By relaxing the limit of five codes for each Chinese character and adopting more detailed Cangjie codes, visually similar characters can be found by computation. Integrating this with pronunciation information enables computer-assisted learning of Chinese characters.

<text>Battlezone is a 1980 first-person shooter tank combat video game developed and published by Atari for arcades. The player controls a tank which is attacked by other tanks and missiles. Using a small radar scanner along with the terrain window, the player can locate enemies and obstacles around them in the barren landscape. Its innovative use of 3D graphics made it a huge hit, with approximately 15,000 cabinets sold.

With its use of three-dimensional vector graphics, the game is considered to be the first true 3D arcade game that has a first-person perspective, the &quot;first big 3D success&quot; in the video game industry, and the first successful first-person shooter video game in particular. This made it a milestone for first-person shooter games.

The game was primarily designed by Ed Rotberg, who was mainly inspired by Atari&#x27;s top-down shooter game &quot;Tank&quot; (1974). &quot;Battlezone&quot; was distributed in Japan by Sega and Taito in 1981. The system was based on vector hardware designed by Wendi Allen&quot;&quot; which was introduced in &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; and saw success with &quot;Asteroids&quot;. The 3D hardware which drove the program saw use in future games, including &quot;Red Baron&quot;, released in 1981. It is considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time.

==Gameplay==
The game uses wireframe vector graphics displayed on a black and white vector monitor. A colored overlay tints the display green for the bottom where the action takes place, and red for the top where the score and radar screen are displayed.

The player drives a tank using two joysticks, one controlling the right tread and the other the left. By moving the joysticks relative to each other, the tank can move forward or reverse (both moved in the same direction), turn on the spot to the left or right (one forward, one back) or move and turn at a slower rate (one forward or backward, one neutral). The right-side stick also has a fire button on top, which shoots the player&#x27;s gun in the direction the tank is currently facing.

Gameplay takes place on a flat plane with a mountainous horizon featuring an erupting volcano, a distant crescent moon, and various geometric solids (in vector outline) like pyramids and blocks. The geometric solid obstacles are indestructible and can obstruct the movement of a player&#x27;s tank while also blocking shots and can be used as shields. The action surrounds the player in all directions, including off-screen locations, forcing the player to locate the enemy using the radar display at the top of the screen.

There are three types of enemy craft that appear during play, one at a time. At the start of a game, the enemy is dominated by slow tanks that are not particularly difficult to hit even when moving. As the game continues, missiles begin to appear in place of the enemy tanks; these move much faster and are more difficult to hit. Finally, the much faster supertanks appear at higher levels, which are not only harder to hit, but also attack more aggressively.

Periodically saucer-shaped UFOs will appear while making a distinctive sound to announce their presence; these do not show up on the radar and do not attack the user, but can be shot for bonus points. This is the only object that may appear while other enemies are already present.

There is a gameplay modification at 100,000 points if the proper conditions are met. When executed properly, the next appearing supertank will not attack, but will instead retreat. A tank icon will then appear at right on qualified high score listings.

==Cabinet==

&quot;Battlezone&quot; is housed in an upright full-sized arcade cabinet with a &quot;periscope&quot; viewfinder. The viewfinder restricted the player&#x27;s view so that the display appeared to be naturally limited to resemble a scope. The game action can also be viewed from the sides of the viewfinder for spectators to watch. The game&#x27;s periscope viewfinder is similar to earlier submarine shooting arcade games, notably Midway&#x27;s arcade video game &quot;Sea Wolf&quot; (1976) and Sega&#x27;s electro-mechanical game &quot;Periscope&quot; (1966). A later version of the cabinet removed the periscope and raised the monitor to a more normal position to improve visibility to non-players and improve ergonomics for players who could not reach the periscope. A smaller, &quot;cabaret&quot; version of the cabinet has the screen angled upwards and no periscope.

The large controller handles were adapted from earlier gear-shift controllers used on racing games, modified with a new stick shape that has internal ribs to make them stronger and adding rubber centering bellows. The right stick has a raised and LED illuminated fire button on top, and the controls were completed with a similar LED illuminated start button on the cabinet. There were two speakers, one each above and below the 19-inch monitor.

==Development==
With the success of the Cinematronics vector graphics games, Atari&#x27;s Grass Valley engineering labs decided to build their own version of a vector display system known as &quot;QuadraScan&quot; that offered a resolution of 1024 x 768. Once it was up and running, they delivered the prototype unit to Atari headquarters where it was given to Wendi Allen and Rick Moncrief to develop it into a unit suitable for arcade video game use. Allen decided to reimplement the driver system using analog electronics instead of digital, simplifying it and lowering its cost.

While working on the system, Allen suggested they use it to implement a version of &quot;Lunar Lander&quot;. While Allen worked on the driver hardware and Moncrief on the display system, Rich Moore wrote the software for the game. &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; was released in August 1979, Atari&#x27;s first vector game, but was not a great success with only 4,830 units manufactured.

Another team at Atari consisting of Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Steve Callfee was working on a raster graphics game called &quot;Planet Grab&quot;. When they saw &quot;Lunar Lander&quot;, they asked about using the same system for their game, and the result was &quot;Asteroids&quot;. Released in November 1979, it went on to be Atari&#x27;s most successful game, with 55,000 units sold.

With the system now proving a huge success in the arcades, Morgan Hoff organized a brainstorming session at Atari to consider additional uses for the hardware. Around the same time, Atari had also been experimenting with early 3D displays using a custom math chip known simply as &quot;the math box&quot;, developed by Jed Margolin and Mike Albaugh. The idea of using the math box with the vector hardware seemed like a winner, and the idea of a tank game was raised at the meeting, although Hoff could not remember exactly who introduced the idea.

The game&#x27;s design was led by Ed Rotberg. He cited Atari&#x27;s top-down arcade shooter game &quot;Tank&quot; (1974) as the primary inspiration behind &quot;Battlezone&quot;, essentially a 3D version of that game. While &quot;Battlezone&quot; also has similarities to a first-person tank simulation for the PLATO system, &quot;Panther&quot;, Rotberg said he had never played that game before, but had heard of it; he stated that it &quot;may have inspired whoever originally suggested the idea at the brainstorming meeting where it was proposed, but I seriously doubt it&quot;.

Owen Rubin, who shared an office with Ed Rotberg, had the idea of making the volcano in the background erupt, and coded the animation for it.

==Ports==
In the 1980s, &quot;Battlezone&quot; was ported to the Apple II, Atari 2600, Commodore 64, VIC-20, IBM PC compatibles, ZX Spectrum, and later the Atari 8-bit computers and Atari ST. The ports to non-Atari systems were from Atarisoft. The ZX Spectrum version was published by Quicksilva.

The Atari 8-bit version was released on cartridge in 1987 in the styling of the then-new Atari XEGS. An Atari 5200 port was scheduled for release in November 1983, but was cancelled.

The Atari 2600 version uses raster graphics instead of vectors and has a third person view where the tank is visible.

The Atari ST port contains large parts of the original 6502 code which is emulated.

==Reception==
&quot;Battlezone&quot; was released in November 1980 and was a hit. Although not as successful as &quot;Asteroids&quot;, &quot;Battlezone&quot; eventually produced another 15,000 sales for Atari.

&quot;Battlezone&quot; was well received, earning an Honorable Mention for &quot;Best Commercial Arcade Game&quot; in 1982 at the Third Annual Arkie Awards. It was runner-up, behind &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. David and Sandy Small called it &quot;addictive&quot; and mentioned the Battlezone Tunnel Vision, which makes the players drive strangely during rush hour. In a more recent review, Eurogamer stated that &quot;Atari&#x27;s designers came up with some incredibly inventive and interesting games before their decline. &quot;Battlezone&quot; is one of the finer examples&quot; and rated it 8 out of 10. Fox gives it a 4 out of 5 rating in &quot;The Video Games Guide&quot;, although he admits this might perturb some readers. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the arcade version 97th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;.

Computer and Video Games magazine awarded the Spectrum version of Battlezone 30 out of 40 points, praising its technical achievements such as the implementation of hidden line removal. The reviewer compared the game to 3D Tank Duel, a similar game by Realtime Games Software, opining that the latter was marginally superior to the official port.

==&quot;The Bradley Trainer&quot;==

A version called &quot;The Bradley Trainer&quot; (also known as &quot;Army Battlezone&quot; or &quot;Military Battlezone&quot;) was designed for use by the U.S. Army as targeting training for gunners on the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. It was commissioned by a consultant group of retired generals.

Approaching Atari in December 1980, some developers within Atari refused to work on the project because of its association with the Army, most notably original &quot;Battlezone&quot; programmer Ed Rotberg. Rotberg only joined the project after he was promised by management that he would never be asked to do anything with the military in the future. According to Rotberg, it took him three months of constant work to develop the prototype version of &quot;The Bradley Trainer&quot;. Only two were produced; one was delivered to the Army and is presumed lost, and the other is in the private collection of Scott Evans, who found it by a dumpster in the rear parking lot at Midway Games.

The gunner yoke was based on the Bradley Fighting Vehicle control and was later re-used in the popular &quot;Star Wars&quot; game. &quot;The Bradley Trainer&quot; differs dramatically from the original &quot;Battlezone&quot; as it features helicopters, missiles, and machine guns; furthermore, the actual tank does not move, but the guns simply rotate.

==Legacy==
Due to its use of first-person pseudo 3D graphics combined with a &quot;viewing goggle&quot; that the player puts his or her face into, &quot;Battlezone&quot; is sometimes considered the first virtual reality arcade video game.

<text>Mateja Svet (); born 16 August 1968) is a Slovenian former alpine skier, who competed for Yugoslavia from 1984 to 1990.

==Biography==
Svet was born in Ljubljana, Socialist Republic of Slovenia, Yugoslavia. Making her first appearance in the 1983/1984 season, she won the first Yugoslav female skiing victory in February 1986.

Svet won the World Cup giant slalom title in the 1987/1988 season, won silver medal in giant slalom in the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, won three medals in 1987 World Championship in Crans-Montana (bronze in slalom and super-G, silver in giant slalom) and two medals in 1989 World Championship in Vail – gold in slalom, later when the bronze Christelle Guignard was disqualified due to doping, also bronze in giant slalom.
