<text>Hugh Clowers Thompson Jr. (April 15, 1943 – January 6, 2006) was a United States Army officer, serving as a warrant officer in the 123rd Aviation Battalion of the 23rd Infantry Division. He is credited with ending the Mỹ Lai Massacre of the South Vietnamese village known as Sơn Mỹ on March 16, 1968, alongside Glenn Andreotta and Lawrence Colburn.

During the massacre, Thompson and his Hiller OH-23 Raven crew, Andreotta and Colburn, stopped many killings by threatening and blocking American officers and enlisted soldiers of Company C, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 11th Brigade, 23rd Infantry Division. Additionally, Thompson and his crew saved a number of Vietnamese civilians by personally escorting them away from advancing United States Army ground units and assuring their evacuation by air. Thompson reported the atrocities by radio several times while at Sơn Mỹ. Although these reports reached Task Force Barker operational headquarters, nothing was done to stop the massacre. After evacuating a child to a Quảng Ngãi hospital, Thompson angrily reported to his superiors at Task Force Barker headquarters that a massacre was occurring at Sơn Mỹ. Immediately following Thompson&#x27;s report, Lieutenant Colonel Frank A. Barker ordered all ground units in Sơn Mỹ to cease search and destroy operations in the village.

In 1970, Thompson testified against those responsible for the Mỹ Lai massacre. Twenty-six officers and enlisted soldiers, including William Calley and Ernest Medina, were charged with criminal offenses; many were either acquitted or pardoned, notably excepting Calley, who was convicted and served a commuted sentence of three-and-a-half years under house arrest. Thompson was condemned and ostracized by many individuals in the United States military and government, as well as the public, for his role in the investigations and trials concerning the Mỹ Lai massacre. As a result of what he experienced, Thompson experienced post-traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, divorce, and severe nightmare disorder. Despite the adversity he faced, he remained in the Army until November 1, 1983, then continued to make a living as a helicopter pilot in the Southeastern United States.

In 1998, 30 years after the massacre, Thompson and the two other members of his crew, Andreotta and Colburn, were awarded the Soldier&#x27;s Medal (Andreotta posthumously), the United States Army&#x27;s highest award for bravery not involving direct contact with the enemy. Thompson and Colburn returned to Sơn Mỹ to meet with survivors of the massacre at the Sơn Mỹ Memorial in 1998. In 1999, Thompson and Colburn received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award.

==Early life==
Hugh Clowers Thompson Jr. was born on April 15, 1943, in Atlanta, Georgia, to Wessie and Hugh Clowers Thompson. His family was from the Province of Georgia and Great Britain. He identified his paternal grandmother as being of Cherokee descent.

Hugh Clowers Thompson Sr. was an electrician and served in the United States Navy during the Second World War.

In 1946, the Thompson family relocated from Atlanta to Stone Mountain, Georgia. Thompson&#x27;s brother and only sibling, Tommie Norman Thompson, was born in 1938 and served in the United States Air Force during the Vietnam War. Thompson was a member of the Boy Scouts of America and his family was actively involved in the Episcopal Church. Hugh Clowers Thompson Sr. educated his children to act with discipline and integrity. The Thompson family denounced racism and ethnic discrimination in the United States and assisted many ethnic minority families in their community. Coming from a working-class family, Hugh Clowers Thompson Jr. plowed fields and later worked as an assistant for a funeral mortuary to support his family during his adolescence.

Thompson graduated from Stone Mountain High School on June 5, 1961. Following graduation, Thompson enlisted in the United States Navy and served in a naval mobile construction battalion at Naval Air Station Atlanta, Georgia, as a heavy equipment operator. Thompson married Palma Baughman in 1963. In 1964, Thompson received an honorable discharge from the Navy and returned to Stone Mountain to live a quiet life and raise a family with his wife. He studied mortuary science and became a licensed funeral director.

When the Vietnam War began, Thompson felt obliged to return to military service. In 1966, Thompson enlisted in the United States Army and completed the Warrant Officer Flight Program training at Fort Wolters, Texas, and Fort Rucker, Alabama. In late-December 1967, at the age of 25, Thompson was ordered to Vietnam and assigned to Company B, 123rd Aviation Battalion of the 23rd Infantry Division.

== Mỹ Lai massacre intervention ==

On March 16, 1968, Thompson and his Hiller OH-23 Raven observation helicopter crew, Lawrence Colburn (gunner) and Glenn Andreotta (crew chief), were ordered to support Task Force Barker&#x27;s search and destroy operations in Sơn Mỹ, Quảng Ngãi Province, South Vietnam. Song My Village was composed of four hamlets, Mỹ Lai, Mỹ Khê, Cổ Lũy and Tư Cung, and was suspected by the United States Army Military Intelligence Corps to be a Viet Cong stronghold.

Army intelligence concerning the presence of Viet Cong in Sơn Mỹ was inaccurate, however, and the village&#x27;s population was predominately composed of neutral, unarmed rice-farming families. Reconnaissance aircraft, including Thompson&#x27;s OH-23 crew, flew over the Sơn Mỹ vicinity but received no enemy fire. At 07:30, following a short artillery and helicopter gunship barrage, Company C (Charlie Company), 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment of Task Force Barker, led by Captain Ernest Medina, was landed by helicopters and moved into Sơn Mỹ.

Upon entering Sơn Mỹ, officers and soldiers of Company C moved through the Song My Village and vicinity, murdering civilians, raping women, and setting fire to huts. 1st Platoon of Company C, commanded by Lieutenant William Calley, forced approximately 70–80 villagers, mostly women and children, into an irrigation ditch and murdered the civilians with knives, bayonets, grenades, and small arms fire.

Thompson recounted at an academic conference on Mỹ Lai held at Tulane University in December, 1994: &quot;We kept flying back and forth, reconning in front and in the rear, and it didn&#x27;t take very long until we started noticing the large number of bodies everywhere. Everywhere we&#x27;d look, we&#x27;d see bodies. These were infants, two-, three-, four-, five-year-olds, women, very old men, no draft-age people whatsoever.&quot;

Thompson and his crew, who at first thought the artillery bombardment caused all the civilian deaths on the ground, became aware that Americans were murdering the villagers after a wounded civilian woman they requested medical evacuation for, Nguyễn Thị Tẩu (chín Tẩu), was murdered right in front of them by Captain Medina, the commanding officer of the operation. According to Lawrence Colburn,

Immediately after the execution, Thompson discovered the irrigation ditch full of Calley&#x27;s victims. Thompson then radioed a message to accompanying gunships and Task Force Barker headquarters, &quot;It looks to me like there&#x27;s an awful lot of unnecessary killing going on down there. Something ain&#x27;t right about this. There&#x27;s bodies everywhere. There&#x27;s a ditch full of bodies that we saw. There&#x27;s something wrong here.&quot; Thompson spotted movement in the irrigation ditch, indicating that there were civilians alive in it. He immediately landed to assist the victims. Lieutenant Calley approached Thompson and the two exchanged an uneasy conversation.
Thompson: What&#x27;s going on here, Lieutenant?

Calley: This is my business.

Thompson: What is this? Who are these people?

Calley: Just following orders.

Thompson: Orders? Whose orders?

Calley: Just following...

Thompson: But, these are human beings, unarmed civilians, sir.

Calley: Look Thompson, this is my show. I&#x27;m in charge here. It ain&#x27;t your concern.

Thompson: Yeah, great job.

Calley: You better get back in that chopper and mind your own business.

Thompson: You ain&#x27;t heard the last of this!
As Thompson was speaking to Calley, Calley&#x27;s subordinate, Sergeant David Mitchell, fired into the irrigation ditch, killing any civilians still moving. Thompson and his crew, in disbelief and shock, returned to their helicopter and began searching for civilians they could save. They spotted a group of women, children, and old men in the northeast corner of the village fleeing from advancing soldiers from the 2nd Platoon, Company C. Immediately realizing that the soldiers intended to murder the Vietnamese civilians, Thompson landed his helicopter between the advancing ground unit and the villagers. He turned to Colburn and Andreotta and ordered them to shoot the men in the 2nd Platoon if they attempted to kill any of the fleeing civilians. While Colburn and Andreotta trained their guns on the 2nd Platoon, Thompson located as many civilians as he could, persuaded them to follow him to a safer location, and ensured their evacuation with the help of two UH-1 Huey pilots he was friends with.

Low on fuel, Thompson was forced to return to a supply airstrip miles outside the village. Before they departed the village, Andreotta spotted movement in the irrigation ditch full of bodies. According to Trent Angers in &quot;The Forgotten Hero of My Lai: The Hugh Thompson Story&quot; (2014),

The child, Do Ba, was pulled from the irrigation ditch and after failing to find any more survivors, Thompson&#x27;s crew transported the child to a hospital in Quảng Ngãi.

After transporting the child to the hospital, Thompson flew to the Task Force Barker headquarters (Landing Zone Dottie), and angrily reported the massacre to his superiors. His report quickly reached Lieutenant Colonel Frank Barker, the operation&#x27;s overall commander. Barker immediately radioed ground forces to cease the &quot;killings&quot;. After the helicopter was refueled, Thompson&#x27;s crew returned to the village to ensure that no more civilians were being murdered and that the wounded were evacuated.

===After the massacre===
Thompson made an official report of the killings and was interviewed by Colonel Oran Henderson, the commander of the 11th Infantry Brigade (the parent organization of the 20th Infantry). Concerned, senior American Division officers cancelled similar planned operations by Task Force Barker against other villages (Mỹ Lai 5, Mỹ Lai 1, etc.) in Quảng Ngãi Province, possibly preventing the additional massacre of further hundreds, if not thousands, of Vietnamese civilians.

Initially, commanders throughout the American chain of command were successful in covering up the Mỹ Lai massacre. Thompson quickly received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions at Mỹ Lai. The citation for the award fabricated events, for example praising Thompson for taking to a hospital a Vietnamese child &quot;...caught in intense crossfire&quot;. It also stated that his &quot;...sound judgment had greatly enhanced Vietnamese–American relations in the operational area&quot;. Thompson threw away the citation.

Thompson continued to fly observation missions in the OH-23 and was hit by enemy fire a total of eight times. In four of those instances, his aircraft was lost. In the last incident, his helicopter was brought down by enemy machine-gun fire, and he broke his back in the resulting crash landing. This ended his combat career in Vietnam. He was evacuated to a hospital in Japan and began a long period of rehabilitation.

When news of the massacre publicly broke, Thompson repeated his account to then-Colonel William Wilson and then-Lieutenant General William Peers during their official Pentagon investigations. In late-1969, Thompson was summoned to Washington, DC to appear before a special closed hearing of the House Armed Services Committee. There, he was sharply criticized by congressmen, in particular Chairman Mendel Rivers (D-S.C.), who were anxious to play down allegations of a massacre by American troops. Rivers publicly stated that he felt Thompson was the only soldier at Mỹ Lai who should be punished (for turning his weapons on fellow American troops) and unsuccessfully attempted to have him court-martialed.

Thompson was vilified by many Americans for his testimony against United States Army personnel. He recounted in a CBS &quot;60 Minutes&quot; television program in 2004, &quot;I&#x27;d received death threats over the phone...Dead animals on your porch, mutilated animals on your porch some mornings when you get up.&quot;

After his Vietnam service, Thompson was assigned to Fort Rucker to become an instructor pilot and later received a direct commission, attaining the rank of captain and retired as a major. His other military assignments included Fort Jackson, South Korea, Fort Ord, Fort Hood and bases in Hawaii. He retired from the army in 1983.

==Post-military life==
Thompson became a helicopter pilot for the oil industry, operating in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1988 an English documentary film producer, Michael Bilton, working for Yorkshire Television, managed to contact Thompson via his mother, who was then widowed and living in Texas. At that point Thompson had all but disappeared from public life. Bilton had contacted former crew member Colburn, and put Thompson and Colburn in touch with each other after a gap of nearly 16 years. Both Thompson and Colburn had been trying to find each other, but without success. Thompson was living in Lafayette, Louisiana, and Colburn near Atlanta, Georgia. They quickly arranged a reunion. Bilton spent a long weekend with Thompson discussing the events at Mỹ Lai. It proved the beginning of a long friendship which lasted until Thompson&#x27;s death.

Both Thompson and Colburn were interviewed for the film &quot;Four Hours in My Lai&quot; (1989) (&quot;Remember My Lai?&quot; on PBS) – which went on to win a British Academy Award and an international Emmy award. The interview showed Thompson relating what he had witnessed at Mỹ Lai: &quot;Here we were supposed to be the guys in the white hats. It upset me&quot;. Bilton and his colleague Kevin Sim then began researching a book and Bilton conducted further interviews with Thompson and Colburn. When the book &quot;Four Hours in My Lai&quot; (1992) was published, it prompted a campaign to have the heroism of Thompson and his helicopter crew recognized. Several senior figures in the U.S. military supported the campaign, as did President George H. W. Bush. Thompson and Colburn were invited to speak to a wide range of audiences about the ethics of warfare including at West Point, a conference in Norway, and at Connecticut College in New London, where they were each awarded an honorary doctorate.

In 1998, Thompson and Colburn returned to the village of Sơn Mỹ, where they met some of the people they saved during the killings, including Thi Nhung and Pham Thi Nhanh, two women who had been part of the group about to be killed by Brooks&#x27;s 2nd Platoon. Thompson said to the survivors, &quot;I just wish our crew that day could have helped more people than we did.&quot; He reported that one of the women they had helped out came up to him and asked, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t the people who committed these acts come back with you?&quot; He said that he was &quot;just devastated&quot; but that she finished her sentence: &quot;So we could forgive them.&quot; He later told a reporter, &quot;I&#x27;m not man enough to do that. I&#x27;m sorry. I wish I was, but I won&#x27;t lie to anybody. I&#x27;m not that much of a man.&quot; Thompson and Colburn lit incense sticks and placed them in an urn by a stone marker at the irrigation ditch where many were murdered. They also dedicated a new elementary school for the children of the village.

Thompson later served as a counselor in the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs, and gave a talk at the United States Naval Academy in 2003 and at West Point in 2005 on Professional Military Ethics. He also spoke at the United States Air Force Academy and to United States Marine Corps officers at Quantico. Thompson gave his first lecture to a U.S. Army audience, discussing physical and moral courage, at the U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School, Ft. Sam Houston, Texas, in 1998. Thompson and his crew&#x27;s actions have been used as an example in the ethics manuals of U.S. and European militaries. Thompson received an honorary degree from Emory University and The Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library at Emory University holds a collection relating to the life and careers of Hugh Thompson and Lawrence Colburn. In 2005, he retired from Louisiana Veterans Affairs.

==Recognition for actions at Mỹ Lai==
In 1998, exactly 30 years after the massacre, Thompson, Andreotta, and Colburn were awarded the Soldier&#x27;s Medal (Andreotta posthumously), the United States Army&#x27;s highest award for bravery not involving direct contact with the enemy. &quot;It was the ability to do the right thing even at the risk of their personal safety that guided these soldiers to do what they did&quot;, then-Major General Michael Ackerman said at the 1998 ceremony. The three &quot;set the standard for all soldiers to follow&quot;. Additionally on March 10, 1998, Senator Max Cleland (D-Ga.) entered a tribute to Thompson, Colburn and Andreotta into the record of the U.S. Senate. Cleland said the three men were &quot;true examples of American patriotism at its finest&quot;.

In 1999, Thompson and Colburn received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award. Later that year, both men served as co-chairs of STONEWALK, a group who pulled a one-ton rock engraved &quot;Unknown Civilians Killed in War&quot; from Boston to Arlington National Cemetery. In 2010, the Hugh Thompson Foundation was chartered in memory of Thompson&#x27;s courage in halting the massacre. His biography &quot;The Forgotten Hero of My Lai: The Hugh Thompson Story&quot; by Trent Angers was included on the U.S. Army Chief of Staff&#x27;s professional reading list.

Folk singer David Rovics wrote a song about the incident at Mỹ Lai titled &quot;Song for Hugh Thompson&quot;. Ryan Costello of The Oaks wrote a song commemorating Hugh Thompson&#x27;s heroism in &quot;For Hugh Thompson, Who Stood Alone&quot; on the album &quot;Our Fathers and the Things They Left Behind&quot;. Thom Parrott (also known as Tom Parrott) wrote the song &quot;Pinkville Helicopter&quot; about the massacre that is included on the Smithsonian Folkways CD collection &quot;Best of Broadside&quot;. Jonathan Berger composed a piano concerto dedicated to Hugh Thompson. Commissioned by the National Endowment for the Arts, it was premiered at the United Nations General Assembly on January 24, 2001. A subsequent solo piano work, &quot;Elegy for the Victims of My Lai&quot;, adapted from the concerto was recorded and performed by pianist Sasha Toperich. The Kronos Quartet used Berger&#x27;s music along with a libretto by Harriet Scott Chessman to compose a &quot;monodrama&quot; with tenor Rinde Eckert. Along with the strings of the quartet and various Vietnamese instruments played by the musician Van-Anh Vo, Eckert sang about Thompson&#x27;s encounter with the massacre and the effect of the encounter on himself. The composition was presented at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in September 2017.

==Death==
At the age of 62, after extensive treatment for cancer, Thompson was removed from life support and died on January 6, 2006, at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Pineville, Louisiana. Colburn came from Atlanta to be at his bedside. Thompson was buried in Lafayette, Louisiana, with full military honors, including a three-volley salute and a helicopter flyover. On February 8, Congressman Charles Boustany (R-La.) made a statement in Congress honoring Thompson, stating that the &quot;United States has lost a true hero, and the State of Louisiana has lost a devoted leader and dear friend.&quot;

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in [[Albania]]. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn&#x27;t necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

==History==
A form of radical liberalism was dominant shortly after independence, but became oppressed. After the restoration of democracy in the 1990s, liberalism was and is only a weak political factor. Two parties could be considered to embrace liberal values: the Democratic Alliance Party (&quot;Partia Aleanca Demokratike&quot;, member LI, ELDR) and the Unity for Human Rights Party (&quot;Partia Bashkimi për të Drejtat e Njeriut&quot;), which is the party of the ethnic minorities.

===Democratic Party===
*1924: The democratic faction of the &quot;Popular Party&quot; (Partia Popullore), led by Stylian Fan Noli seceded and established the liberal Democratic Party (&quot;Parti Demokratike&quot;).
*1924: The party is banned by the dictatorship

===Democratic Alliance Party===
1992: A liberal faction of the conservative Democratic Party of Albania (&quot;Partia Demokratike e Shqipërisë&quot;) seceded to form the present-day Democratic Alliance Party (&quot;Partia Aleanca Demokratike&quot;)

<doc id="874965" wikidata="Q2355282" url="?curid=874965" title="M-227 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-227 is a north–south state trunkline highway in the U.S. state of Michigan. It consists largely of a segment of old U.S. Highway 27 (US 27) along the south and west sides of Marshall. The highway passes the airport and serves an industrial section of town north of the Kalamazoo River. M-227 was created as a part of a program to add additional routes into the state&#x27;s highway system under the leadership of Governor John Engler.

==Route description==
M-227 starts at a diamond interchange with Interstate 69 (I-69) at exit 32 between Tekonsha and Marshall. From I-69, M-227 runs east on F Drive South north of Pine and Long lakes for approximately one mile (1.6 km). The highway runs through agricultural land and turns north to follow Old US 27/17 Mile Road. At Division Drive, M-227 passes into Marshall on Kalamazoo Avenue. The highway runs past the Brooks Field airport and the Alwin Downs Golf Course. Kalamazoo Avenue crosses the Kalamazoo River, and M-227 turns west along Industrial Road. This section of town is an industrial park, and M-227 curves north onto West Drive, crossing the Norfolk Southern Railroad. The northern terminus is BL I-94 (Michigan Avenue) on the west side of Marshall, near I-69. It lies only within Calhoun County and is entirely an undivided surface route.

Like other state highways in Michigan, M-227 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department&#x27;s traffic surveys showed that on average, 8.408 vehicles used the highway daily in Marshall south of Industrial Dive and 1,862 vehicles did so each day along F Drive, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. No section of M-227 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==
Before the completion of I-69 near Marshall in late 1967, US 27 followed 17 Mile Road and Kalamazoo Avenue into Marshall. That routing was turned back to local control after the completion of I-69 to I-94.
M-227 came into existence nearly 35 years after the completion of I-69 in southern Michigan and, except for the section of old US 27, was long a collection of unnumbered local surface roads. It was designated as a part of Governor John Engler&#x27;s Rationalization program on October 1, 1998 and first signed in 2001.

<doc id="874968" wikidata="Q3306394" url="?curid=874968" title="Ubon Ratchathani Candle Festival">
<text>The Ubon Ratchathani Candle Festival (), the most elaborate of the traditional parading of candles to wats (), is held in Ubon Ratchathani, Isan, Thailand, around the days of &quot;Asanha Puja&quot; (which commemorates Lord Buddha&#x27;s first sermon) and &quot;Wan Kao Pansa&quot; (which marks the beginning of vassa).

At the start of the Lenten period, it is traditional in preparation for the rainy season for the devout to donate to items for the personal use of monks, and of candles to dispel gloom in their quarters and elsewhere within the wat. The latter is often the core event of many village celebrations, but is at its most elaborate in the Ubon Ratchathani version, which nowadays is a major event both for residents and for tourists: giant candles are paraded through the town, each representing a local temple, district or other institution. The more elaborate versions are accompanied by scenes of Hindu and Buddhist mythology sculpted in wood or plaster and coated with wax. Of course, these candles are never burned.

 The candles are carved a couple of days before the procession.
On Asanha Bucha day, the candles are taken to Thung Si Mueang, a park in the middle of the city, where they are decorated and then exhibited in the evening. On the same evening, there are small processions with lighted candles at several temples.

The procession takes place on the morning of &quot;Wan Kao Pansa&quot;. The candles are paraded through the city centre on floats, accompanied by representatives of the respective institutions. These are normally dancers or musicians in traditional dress.

In addition to the above, the festival is accompanied by the usual paraphernalia of feasting and games which attend any Thai festival.

<doc id="874986" wikidata="Q13589668" url="?curid=874986" title="Commendation ceremony">
<text>A commendation ceremony (&quot;commendatio&quot;) is a formal ceremony that evolved during the Early Medieval period to create a bond between a lord and his fighting man, called his vassal. The first recorded ceremony of &quot;commendatio&quot; was in 7th century France, but the relationship of &quot;vassalage&quot; was older, and predated even the medieval formulations of a noble class. The lord&#x27;s &quot;man&quot;, might be born unfree, but the &quot;commendatio&quot; freed him.

When two men entered into a feudal relationship, they underwent the ceremony. The purpose of the commendation was to make a chosen person a vassal of a lord. The commendation ceremony is composed of two elements, one to perform the act of homage and the other an oath of fealty. In some countries, such as the Kingdom of Sicily, the commendation ceremony came to be referred to as investiture.

==Etymology==
The word vassal ultimately comes from the PIE root *upo &quot;under&quot;. Becoming in the Proto-Celtic language *wasso- &quot;young man, squire,&quot; literally &quot;one who stands under,&quot; thence into: Welsh &quot;gwas&quot; &quot;youth, servant,&quot; Breton &quot;goaz&quot; &quot;servant, vassal, man,&quot; and Irish &quot;foss&quot; &quot;servant&quot;. The Celtic word was taken into medieval Latin &quot;vassallus&quot; &quot;man-servant, domestic, retainer.&quot; In Old French it became &quot;vassal&quot; &quot;subject, subordinate, servant&quot; (12c.), and thus into English with this sense.

==Act of homage==

The would-be vassal appeared bareheaded and weaponless as a sign of his submission to the will of the lord and knelt before him. The vassal would clasp his hands before him in the ultimate sign of submission, the typical Christian prayer pose, and would stretch his clasped hands outward to his lord.

The lord in turn grasped the vassal&#x27;s hands between his own, showing he was the superior in the relationship, a symbolic act known variously as the (Latin), (German), or (Norwegian). The vassal would announce he wished to become &quot;the man&quot;, and the lord would announce his acceptance. The act of homage was complete.

The physical position for Western Christian prayer that is thought of as typical today—kneeling, with hands clasped—may originate from the commendation ceremony. Before this time, European Christians prayed in the &quot;orans&quot;, which is the Latin, or &quot;praying&quot; position that people had used in antiquity: standing, with hands outstretched, a gesture still used today in many Christian rituals.

The gesture of homage (though without any feudal significance) survives in the ceremony for conferring degrees at the University of Cambridge.

Eginhard records the solemn commendation ceremony made to Pippin by Tassilo, duke of Bavaria in 757, (&quot;commending himself in vassalage between the hands&quot; (&quot;in vasatico se commendans per manus&quot;), he swore—and the word used is &quot;sacramenta&quot;—, placing his hands on the relics of the saints, which had apparently been assembled at Compiègne for the solemn occasion, and promised fidelity to the king and to his sons: the relics touched were those of Saint Denis, Saint Rusticus and Saint Éleuthère, Saint Martin and Saint Germain, a daunting array of witnesses. And the men of high birth who accompanied him swore likewise &quot;...and numerous others&quot;, Eginhard adds.

==Oath of fealty ceremony==
The vassal would then place his hands on a Bible, or a saint&#x27;s relic, and swear he would never injure the lord in any way and to remain faithful.

An example of an oath of fealty (German &quot;Lehneid&quot;, Dutch &quot;leenpligt&quot;): &quot;I promise on my faith that I will in the future be faithful to the lord, never cause him harm and will observe my homage to him completely against all persons in good faith and without deceit.&quot;

==Significance of commendation==
Once the vassal had sworn the oath of fealty, the lord and vassal had a feudal relationship.

<text>The glaucous macaw (Anodorhynchus glaucus) is a critically endangered or possibly extinct species of large, blue and grey South American parrot, a member of a large group of neotropical parrots known as macaws. This macaw is closely related to Lear&#x27;s macaw (&quot;A. leari&quot;) and the hyacinth macaw (&quot;A. hyacinthinus&quot;). In Guaraní, it is called &quot;&quot; after its vocalizations.

==Description==
 
The glaucous macaw is long. It is mostly pale turquoise-blue with a large, greyish head. The term glaucous describes its colouration. It has a long tail and a large bill. It has a yellow, bare eye ring and half moon-shaped lappets bordering the mandible.

==Range and decline==
This bird was native to north Argentina, south Paraguay, the chaco and llano region of Bolivia near the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, northeast Uruguay, and Brazil. It became rare during the 19th century due to trapping and loss of habitat, and only two possible reports of wild birds were received in the 20th century. Expeditions by ornithologists to southwestern Paraguay during the 1990s failed to turn up any evidence of the species. Furthermore, only the oldest residents of the region had knowledge of the macaw, with the species last recorded in the 1870s. The bird&#x27;s disappearance probably is linked to trapping of live adults for the wild bird trade and the wholesale felling of the yatay palm, &quot;Butia yatay&quot;, the nuts of which appear to have constituted its main food. Although suitable habitat remains in El Palmar National Park, in the Argentine province of Entre Ríos, as well as southern Brazil, no rumours of the bird&#x27;s continued existence in the past several decades have proven credible. A search conducted by Joe Cuddy and Tony Pittman in 1992 concluded that the birds were extinct in their former range. Rumours persisted that blue macaws were seen in Argentina and Bolivia with a dealer in Rosario, Argentina, offering live specimens. The late George Smith gave many talks rich in conservation information on macaws, including this species, which he stated was not extinct in the wild, but existed in remote areas of Bolivia where he had encountered trappers who could identify this species. Moreover, he stated that stands of pure palm existed &quot;as far as the eye could see&quot; when he flew over the area which is yet to be investigated.

A 2018 study citing bird extinction patterns, the heavy destruction of its habitat, and the lack of any confirmed sightings since the 1980s recommended uplisting the species to Critically Endangered - Possibly Extinct.

<doc id="874989" wikidata="Q1397809" url="?curid=874989" title="Svyatoslav Fyodorov">
<text>Svyatoslav Nikolayevich Fyodorov (; 8 August 1927 – 2 June 2000) was a Russian ophthalmologist, politician, professor, full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. He is considered to be a pioneer of refractive surgery. He was also one of the candidates in the 1996 Russian presidential election, running as a member of the Party of Workers&#x27; Self-Government.

== Life and career ==

Fyodorov was born in &quot;Proskurov&quot;, Ukrainian SSR (now Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine), to ethnic Russian parents. 
Fyodorov graduated from Rostov Medical Institute in Rostov on Don, then worked as a practicing ophthalmologist in a small town in Rostov Oblast.

===Cataract surgery===
In the 1960s he studied the pioneering work of the English ophthalmic surgeon Sir Harold Ridley, the inventor of the intraocular lens (IOL). Fyodorov began to use Ridley&#x27;s intraocular lenses in his treatment of cataract. At first he used lenses manufactured by the Rayner company in England but he quickly moved to have his lenses manufactured inside the Soviet Union.

===Refractive surgery===
In the 1970s he developed the surgical technique he is most famous for, the radial keratotomy, to change the shape of the cornea and cure myopia. In 1986, Fyodorov designed the first posterior chamber phakic IOL in the &quot;collar-button&quot; or &quot;mushroom&quot; configuration and manufactured the pIOL from silicone. In 1980 he became the head of the Moscow Research Institute of Eye Microsurgery. In 1988 he founded the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex.
In 1994 he endorsed and wrote the foreword to the American textbook (Radial and Astigmatic Keratotomy) by Dr. Spencer Thornton in which Thornton taught a surgical technique derived from but markedly different from the Fyorodov technique.

==Politics==
In the 1980s through the early 1990s, Fyodorov called for repeal of the Soviet Union&#x27;s one-party system while still a member of the Communist Party.

Fyodorov was a member of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies from 1989 to 1991.

In 1991 he rejected an offer by Boris Yeltsin to become Russia&#x27;s premier.

Considered one of the Soviet Union&#x27;s first highly successful practicing capitalists, he was a proponent for the denationalization of the economy. On June 12, 1991, the day of Russia&#x27;s inaugural presidential election, Fyodorov told state media that he believed that Russia&#x27;s revival hinged on the &quot;de-statization&quot; of property. Fyodorov argued that, &quot;If in the US the main means of production are concentrated in the hands of 13% of the population&quot;, then Russia should distribute ownership of those resources among 50-60% of its population through the creation of &quot;people&#x27;s enterprises&quot; and joint-stock companies. &quot;We have the biggest scientific community in the world, where the intellectual component constitutes 90% of industrial costs. This factor plus our natural resources and territory give us a chance, in the course of one generation, to leave behind the US and, perhaps, Japan,&quot; he said.

In 1992 he became the co-chairman of the Party of Economic Freedom, an early liberal party.

Fyodorov was elected to the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma, in 1995, the chairman of his own small party.

Considered to be on the center-left of the Russian political spectrum, Fyodorov was the founder and leader of the Party of Workers&#x27; Self-Government, which was one of the most influential social-democratic movements in Russia during the 1990s.

In 1994 Fyodorov had described his political objective by stating, &quot;I want peasants to own farms, workers to own factories, physicians to own clinics, and everyone to pay a 30% tax, and the rest is theirs.&quot;

===Presidential campaign===
Fyodorov ran as the candidate of the Party of Workers&#x27; Self-Government in the 1996 Russian presidential election

As a presidential candidate, Fyodorov advocated for the mass creation of joint stock companies to guarantee workers a share of profits and allow them to actively participate in management of their companies. He dubbed this concept &quot;democratic capitalism&quot; or &quot;popular socialism&quot;. Fyodorov advocated for economic freedom, simple and moderate taxation, stimulation of production, and a ban on exports of most raw materials. Fyodorov promised that his policies would double the nation&#x27;s GDP within five years. Fyodorov proclaimed to draw inspiration in his politics from both Ross Perot and Deng Xiaoping.

Up until early May, Fyodorov unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate the creation of a third force coalition, with negotiations largely centering on a coalition between him and fellow candidates Yavlinsky and Lebed.

== Death ==
Returning from an academic conference in 2000, Fyodorov died in a crash of his clinic&#x27;s four-seater helicopter on the outskirts of Moscow.

==Reception and legacy==
In 2013, a profile of Dr. Fyodorov was included in a book called &quot;Saving Sight: An eye surgeon&#x27;s look at life behind the mask and the heroes who changed the way we see&quot;, by Andrew Lam, M.D.

<text>The Jinan incident (; ; formerly romanised Tsinan) or 3 May Tragedy () began as a 3 May 1928 dispute between Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army (NRA) and Japanese soldiers and civilians in Jinan, the capital of Shandong province in China, which then escalated into an armed conflict between the NRA and the Imperial Japanese Army.

Japanese soldiers had been deployed to Shandong province to protect Japanese commercial interests in the province, which were threatened by the advance of Chiang&#x27;s Northern Expedition to reunite China under a Kuomintang government. When the NRA approached Jinan, the Beiyang government-aligned army of Sun Chuanfang withdrew from the area, allowing for the peaceful capture of the city by the NRA. NRA forces initially managed to coexist with Japanese troops stationed around the Japanese consulate and businesses, and Chiang Kai-shek arrived to negotiate their withdrawal on 2 May. This peace was broken the following morning, however, when a dispute between the Chinese and Japanese resulted in the deaths of 13–16 Japanese civilians. The resulting conflict resulted in thousands of casualties on the NRA side, which fled the area to continue northwards toward Beijing, and left the city under Japanese occupation until March 1929.

==Background==

During the Northern Expedition to reunite China under a Kuomintang (KMT) government, foreign concessions and consulates in Nanjing in March 1927 and Hankou in April 1927 were attacked by the KMT&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army (NRA) soldiers and Chinese civilians respectively in what came to be called the Nanking and Hankou incidents. Following these incidents, NRA commander Chiang Kai-shek made repeated statements to the effect that he would not tolerate anti-foreign attacks by his soldiers, and the KMT foreign minister Huang Fu said that they would &quot;protect to their fullest ability the lives and property of foreigners in China in accordance with international law and usage&quot;. Despite these assurances, foreign powers, including the Japanese, remained concerned about the safety of their economic and political interests in China, and resolved that the Nanking incident would not be repeated. 

When the NRA forced back the Beiyang government-aligned &quot;National Pacification Army&quot; warlord coalition to Shandong province in May–June 1927, the Japanese, who considered the province within their sphere of influence, deployed four-thousand troops of the Kwantung Army to the cities of Qingdao and Jinan in what they called the , ostensibly to protect Japanese civilians in anticipation of an NRA advance. NRA commander Chiang Kai-shek wanted to keep his troops away from Jinan, avoiding what he viewed as a useless and potentially costly clash with the Japanese. Similarly, Japanese prime minister Baron Tanaka Giichi knew that the deployment of troops could result in a conflict with the Chinese, which, rather than protecting Japanese citizens and economic interests, could further endanger them. As it happened, in an attempt to resolve the split between the Wuhan and Nanjing factions of the KMT, Chiang was forced to resign from his post of commander of the NRA and halt the Northern Expedition in August 1927, avoiding conflict. With the threat of the NRA advance gone, the Japanese withdrew their troops from Jinan in September 1927.

Chiang sought to avoid repetition of such conflicts and further Japanese interference, and on 5 November 1927, while he was nominally retired from leading the Northern Expedition, he met with Japanese prime minister Tanaka. During the meeting, Tanaka suggested that the Japanese would support only Chiang in China, and not interfere in Chinese domestic affairs. Chiang responded by saying he &quot;understood&quot; Japanese interest in China. When Tanaka said that Chiang should focus on consolidating his power in the territories under KMT control, rather than advance northward toward the Japanese sphere of influence in Fengtian clique-controlled Shandong and Manchuria, Chiang replied that this was not possible. The discussion, therefore, ended without a clear conclusion, though Tanaka was said to be hopeful for future meetings. Chiang, for his part, considered the meeting a failure, but maintained his approach of attempting to work with the Japanese to reach a solution that was amenable to both parties. Despite this, Chiang had only a tenuous hold on power in China, and relied in large measure on the promise to end foreign domination and re-unify the country to buttress his legitimacy.

==Events==
===NRA troops arrive in Jinan===

By April 1928, Chiang Kai-shek had once again consolidated power, at which time he resumed the Northern Expedition. The NRA was able to quickly push back the forces of Beiyang-aligned warlord Sun Chuanfang, and advanced into Shandong. Sun retreated to Jinan by railway on 17–18 April, leaving the path to Jinan open to the NRA. When the Japanese learned of Sun&#x27;s failure to defend Shandong, Prime Minister Tanaka, on the counsel of his military advisors, decided to deploy the 6th Division to Jinan on 19 April, in what was called the . Whilst Tanaka had misgivings about whether it was prudent to launch the expedition, his party, the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot;, had run on a platform of &quot;protecting nationals on the spot&quot; in the February 1928 election, limiting his ability to moderate the Japanese response. Even before Tanaka had given the order, troops under the command of General Fukuda Hikosuke had begun arriving in Jinan via the Qingdao–Jinan railway, possibly as early as 10 April. This was the first serious case of unilateral action by the post-Meiji Restoration Japanese military. The first substantial group of 475 troops, however, arrived in Jinan from Qingdao on 20 April. They were followed by over 4,000 more troops over the coming days. The arrival of the Japanese troops in Jinan, just as the Beiyang-aligned forces had retreated there, prompted suspicions about whether the Beiyang warlords had asked for a Japanese intervention. This was used as propaganda by the Kuomintang, though Beiyang government leader Zhang Zuolin denied doing any such thing. Both the Beiyang government and the KMT government in Nanjing protested against the Japanese action, deeming it a violation of Chinese sovereignty.

As the NRA launched a pincer attack on Jinan, the railways to Qingdao and Beijing were damaged, preventing warlord-aligned troops from receiving reinforcements. This also brought the NRA in conflict with the Japanese, who were guarding the Qingdao–Jinan railway, though no violence broke out at this stage. On 29 April, chaos erupted as the warlord troops began to flee northwards across the Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge, abandoning Jinan. As they left the city, the warlord forces were reported to have engaged in looting, though Japanese-inhabited areas continued to be protected by Japanese troops. Public dissatisfaction with the presence of the Imperial Japanese Army in Shandong became increasingly evident, their presence viewed as a new attempt by the Japanese to seize control of the region, as they had in 1914 during the First World War. NRA troops marched into Jinan over the course of 30 April and 1 May, and took control without trouble. On 2 May, Chiang Kai-shek began negotiations with the Japanese to withdraw their troops, gave assurances to Japanese Major General Ryū Saitō that there would be no disruption in Jinan, and ordered his troops to proceed northward from Jinan with haste, so as to avoid any potential conflict. Following the negotiations, Saitō decided to begin preparations to withdraw the Japanese troops, and said that all security matters in Jinan would then be entrusted to Chiang. General Fukuda later gave his approval to this decision, and the Japanese troops began withdrawal during the night of 2–3 May.

===3 May dispute between NRA and Japanese soldiers===

The area remained quiet, though tense, until a clash erupted between Japanese and NRA soldiers during the morning of 3 May. The exact details of what instigated the clash are contested between the Japanese and Chinese sides. As the Japanese immediately destroyed the Chinese wireless station after the clash began, they were left in control of the only working line of communication out of Jinan, forcing foreign media reports to rely entirely on the Japanese version of the events. According to the official Japanese narrative, as reported by General Fukuda, a group of Chinese soldiers under the command of General , reputed to have been responsible for the Nanjing incident, broke into an office of the Japanese &quot;Manshū Nippō&quot; newspaper, and assaulted its proprietor at 09:30. A group of Japanese soldiers commanded by Captain Yoshiharu Kumekawa patrolling in the area rushed to the scene, and attempted to stop the Chinese soldiers. The Chinese soldiers then opened fire on the Japanese troops, causing the Japanese to return fire. In the Chinese version of events, as recorded by Chiang Kai-shek, a sick Chinese soldier who had attempted to seek treatment at a local Christian hospital with the help of a local labourer was blocked from proceeding down the street to the hospital by Japanese soldiers, sparking a verbal argument. The Japanese then shot and killed the soldier and the labourer. Different Chinese sources, however, reported different versions of the events, and this gave the impression that the Chinese were inventing stories to justify their behaviour. The Japanese version, however, is marked by its own association with the later use of disinformation tactics by the Kwantung Army in the Huanggutun and Mukden incidents.

===Initial fighting and truce===
Regardless of who started the clash, it quickly resulted in a full-scale conflict between the NRA and the Japanese Army. The Japanese reported that NRA soldiers had &quot;run amok&quot;, causing mass destruction and a massacre of Japanese civilians, and the British Acting Consul-General reported that he had seen corpses of Japanese males that had been emasculated. In an incident that would provoke Chinese outrage, Japanese soldiers entered a building that the Chinese later said was their negotiation headquarters, and killed Chinese diplomat Cai Gongshi, eight members of his staff, seven NRA soldiers, and one cook. The exact nature of the killing is contested between the Japanese and Chinese sides, with the Japanese claiming they were attacked from the upper floors, and did not know that the building was a government office or that Cai held the position of negotiator. The Chinese, on the other hand, said that the building was clearly marked, and that Cai&#x27;s nose, ears, and tongue were cut off, and his eyes gouged out, before he was executed. The other members of his staff were reported by the Chinese to have been stripped naked, whipped, dragged out to the back lawn and killed with machine guns. In response to these reports, Major General Ryū Saitō wrote that the Chinese account was &quot;propaganda&quot;, that Cai was simply shot dead during ongoing fighting between the Japanese and Chinese, and that one cannot cut off ears or noses with a bayonet.

Negotiations to halt the escalating violence quickly began, with Chiang and Fukuda agreeing to a truce. Chiang, who was not interested in conflict with the Japanese, and wanted to continue the Northern Expedition, agreed to withdraw his troops from the city, leaving only a small number to keep order. On 4 May, however, the Japanese reported that their chief negotiator, Colonel Sasaki Tōichi, was robbed and nearly beaten to death, and only saved by intervention of one of Chiang&#x27;s officers. In addition, they claimed that Chiang&#x27;s promise to remove all Chinese soldiers from the Japanese-inhabited commercial area of the city had not been implemented. Speaking after the Sasaki incident, Major General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu said that it was &quot;necessary for Japan to chastise the lawless Chinese soldiers in order to maintain Japan&#x27;s national and military prestige&quot;. Responding to a request from General Fukuda, Prime Minister Tanaka ordered the despatch of reinforcements from Korea and Manchuria in the , which began arriving in Jinan on 7 May.

===Japanese reprisal on Jinan===
With his forces bolstered, General Fukuda issued a set of demands to the Chinese, to be met within twelve hours. These were: punishment of responsible Chinese officers, the disarming of responsible Chinese troops before the Japanese army, evacuation of two military barracks near Jinan, prohibition of all anti-Japanese propaganda, and withdrawal of all Chinese troops beyond 20 &quot;li&quot; on both sides of the Qingdao–Jinan railway. The Japanese knew that the Chinese would not be able to fulfil their demands within the stated timeframe. Instead, their issuance was designed to raise the morale of Japanese troops, cow the Chinese, and demonstrate the &quot;determination&quot; of the Japanese military to foreigners. As expected, the demands were viewed as humiliating and unacceptable by the Chinese. In response, Chiang, who had left the area, sent a courier to the Japanese garrison, stating that he would meet some, but not all of the stated demands. Fukuda, who deemed that his demands had not been met, launched a full-scale attack on the Chinese in Jinan in the afternoon of 8 May. Fighting was fiercest on the night of 9–10 May, with the Japanese using artillery to bombard the old walled city, where the remaining NRA troops had holed up. The civilian population of the old city were not warned in advance of the Japanese bombardment, which is thought to have resulted in many casualties. The final group of Chinese soldiers escaped under the cover of night on 10–11 May. By morning, the Japanese had gained full control of Jinan, and took up positions in the walled city. The city would remain under Japanese occupation until March 1929, when an agreement to settle the dispute over Jinan was reached. The period of occupation was defined by oppression, with freedom of the press and assembly proscribed, postal correspondence censored, and residents killed for alleged sympathies with the KMT.

==Aftermath==

Chiang apologised to the Japanese on 10 May and removed He Yaozu from his post. After the incident, Chiang decided he would write one &quot;way to kill the Japanese&quot; each day in his journal, and also wrote that he now thought the Japanese were China&#x27;s greatest enemy. Justifying his backing down from conflict in Jinan, he added that &quot;before one can settle scores, one must be strong&quot;. When Chiang lectured a group of Chinese army cadets on the subject, he urged them to turn their energies to washing away the shame of Jinan, but to conceal their hatred until the last moment. Japanese prime minister Tanaka, who also had hoped to avoid conflict, opened negotiations with Chiang, and close to a year later, in March 1929, an agreement was reached to share responsibility for the Jinan incident, settle the dispute, and withdraw all Japanese troops from Shandong.

If the incident had been an isolated example of Japanese assertion and Chinese resistance, a broader understanding might have been reached. Chiang&#x27;s troops, however, continued to expand their control in northern China and the Japanese army&#x27;s distrust of the forces of Chinese nationalism would only grow. According to historian Akira Iriye, the Jinan incident demonstrated the weak nature of the Japanese chain of command, and the powerlessness of civilian government officials to stop unilateral aggression by the military. Japanese army leaders, increasingly outside civilian control, feared that Chiang would respond to patriotic agitation and threaten their interests in southern Manchuria. Following the precedent of General Fukuda&#x27;s unilateral action in Jinan, a group of officers of the Kwantung Army assassinated the leader of the Beiyang government and ruler of Manchuria Zhang Zuolin on 4 June 1928, setting off a chain of events that created the pretext for the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria.

According to cables sent from Kobe to Hong Kong, in May 1928, 11 or 7 Japanese were shot to death by a Chinese man in Kobe, Japan in revenge for the Jinan incident and then he committed suicide.

== Misuse of photographs of victims ==
Pictures of the corpses of massacred Japanese citizens undergoing autopsy in a Jinan hospital have been used by Chinese publishers such as the Xinhua News Agency as photographs of Japanese Unit 731 conducting biological weapons experiments on Chinese people. They have also appeared in the Jilin provincial museum, and in middle school textbooks. The same pictures have also been mistakenly used in Japan, such as in Kuriya Kentarō&#x27;s book &quot;The Road to the Tokyo Trials&quot; (&quot;Tokyo Saiban e no michi&quot;) and in a TV Asahi program about the horrors of war. Some of these pictures can be viewed below.

<text>The Peter and Paul Fortress () is the original citadel of Saint Petersburg, Russia, founded by Peter the Great in 1703 and built to Domenico Trezzini&#x27;s designs from 1706 to 1740 as a star fortress. Between the first half of the 1700s and early 1920s it served as a prison for political criminals. It has been a museum since 1924.

==History==
===From foundation until 1917===

The fortress was established by Peter the Great on May 16 (Old Style; henceforth &quot;(O.S.)&quot;; May 27 by the Gregorian calendar) 1703 on small Hare Island by the north bank of the Neva river. From around 1720, the fort served as a base for the city garrison and also as a prison for high-ranking or political prisoners.

===Russian Revolution and beyond===
During the February Revolution of 1917, it was attacked by mutinous soldiers of the Pavlovsky Life Guards Regiment on February 27 (O.S.) and the prisoners were freed. Under the Provisional Government, hundreds of Tsarist officials were held in the Fortress.

The tsar was threatened with being incarcerated at the fortress on his return from Mogilev to Tsarskoye Selo on March 8 (O.S.); but he was placed under house arrest. On July 4 (O.S.) during the July Days demonstrations, the fortress garrison of 8,000 men declared for the Bolsheviks. They surrendered to government forces without a struggle on July 6 (O.S.).

On October 25 (O.S.), the fortress quickly fell into Bolshevik hands. Following the ultimatum from the Petrograd Soviet to the Provisional Government ministers in the Winter Palace, after the blank salvo of the cruiser &quot;Aurora&quot; at 21.00, the guns of the fortress fired 30 or so shells at the Winter Palace. Just two hit, inflicting only minor damage, and the defenders refused to surrender at that time. At 02.10 on the morning of October 26 (O.S.), the Winter Palace was taken by forces under Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko; the captured ministers were taken to the fortress as prisoners. On 28 January 1919, four grand dukes from the House of Romanov were shot within the walls of the fortress on the orders of the Presidium of the Cheka under Felix Dzerzhinsky, Yakov Peters, Martin Latsis, and Ivan Ksenofontov.

The structure suffered heavy damage during the bombardment of the city during World War II by the Luftwaffe who were laying siege to the city. It has been restored post-war and is a tourist attraction.

===Public perception===

In the years before and after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the Peter and Paul Fortress was portrayed by Bolshevik propaganda as a hellish, torturous place, where thousands of prisoners suffered endlessly in filthy, cramped, and grossly overcrowded dungeons amid frequent torture and malnutrition. Such legends had the effect of turning the prison into a symbol of government oppression in the minds of the common folk. In reality, conditions in the fortress were far less brutal than believed; no more than one hundred prisoners were ever kept in the prison at a time, and most prisoners had access to such luxuries as tobacco, writing paper, and literature (including subversive books such as Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;&quot;).

Despite their ultimate falsehood, stories about the prison were vital to the spread of Bolshevik revolutionary sentiment. The legends served to portray the government as cruel and indiscriminate in the administration of justice, helping to turn the common mind against Tsarist rule. Many inmates, after being released, wrote chilling and increasingly exaggerated accounts of life there that solidified the structure&#x27;s horrible image in the public mind and pushed the people further towards dissent. Writers often purposely exaggerated their experiences to garner more hatred for the government; as writer and former Peter and Paul inmate Maksim Gorky would later state, &quot;Every Russian who had ever sat in jail as a &#x27;political&#x27; prisoner considered it his holy duty to bestow on Russia his memoirs of how he had suffered.&quot;

==Sights==
The fortress contains several buildings clustered around the Peter and Paul Cathedral (1712–1733), which has a bell-tower and a gilded angel-topped cupola.

Other structures inside the fortress include the still functioning Saint Petersburg Mint building (constructed to Antonio Porta&#x27;s designs under Emperor Paul I), the Trubetskoy Bastion with its grim prison cells, and the city museum.
To the north of the fortress across the Kronverksky Strait lies the Kronverk, formerly the fortress&#x27; outer defence and now home to the Military Historical Museum of Artillery, Engineers and Signal Corps.

===Midday Cannon Shot===

During the time of Peter the Great, a shot from the cannon of the Peter and Paul Fortress was heard in honor of military victories, on holidays, and also to warn residents about the rise in the water level of the Neva.

Since 1873, the cannon is fired at noon. Residents of the city even checked their watches by the shot. The gun was silent only in times of revolutions and wars. However, nowadays the gunshot can be heard every day at 12 noon.

<text>Viti Levu (pronounced ; ) is the largest island in Fiji. It is the site of the country&#x27;s capital and largest city, Suva, and home to a large majority of Fiji&#x27;s population.

== Geology ==
Fiji lies in a tectonically complex area between the Australian plate and the Pacific plate. The Fiji Platform lies in a zone bordered by active extension fault lines, around which most of the shallow earthquakes in the area have been centred. These fault lines are: the Fiji Fracture Zone (FFZ) to the north; the 176° Extension Zone (176°E EZ) to the west; and the Hunter fracture zone (HFZ) and Lau Ridge to the east.

The oldest rocks on the island are those formed during the Eocene and Early Miocene epochs that belong to the Wainimala group. The lower portion of the group
is made up of volcanic flows and volcaniclastics, which grade from basalt to trachyte and rhyolite. Geographically, this group is found south of Nadi, including on the peaks of Koromba (at 3528 feet high) and Natambumgguto (at 1242 feet high), and down to Sigatoka. From Sigatoka, the group extends almost all the way to Lodoni, and includes the peaks of Tuvutau (at 3060 feet) and Tikituru (at 3071 feet). Along the southern coast it extends almost to Nausori. The group is intruded by the Tholo Plutonics, which consist of similar-age stocks of tonalite, granodiorite, gabbro and diorite. Mio-Pliocene sandstones, and marl, grading into epiclastics and andesitic Volcanic rocks of the Suva group are found mainly in the river valleys, such as those formed by the Nadi River and Navua River. The Plio-Pleistocene Mba group is found in the northern portion of the island. It consists of porphyritic basalt flows and volcaniclastics, grading into greywacke. Geographically, it includes the peaks of Koroyanitu (at 3921 feet), Malua (at 3294 feet), Monavatu (at 3708 feet), Mount Tomanivi (at 4341 feet), and Ndelamendamu (at 2540 feet). It extends along the eastern coast, almost to Nausori, and includes the Emperor Mine near Vatukoula.

== Geography, economy and ecology ==

Viti Levu is the largest island in the Republic of Fiji – home to 70% of the population (about 600,000 people) – and is the hub of the entire Fijian archipelago. It measures long and wide, and has an area of . Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions account for the somewhat rugged terrain of the island, which is divided into roughly equal halves by a mountain range that runs north to south. The centre of the island is forested and includes the nation&#x27;s highest peak Mount Tomanivi (otherwise known as Mount Victoria), which rises to .

The eastern side of the island experiences heavy rainfall, particularly in the mountains, and is home to Fiji&#x27;s tropical moist forests. The western side (colloquially called the &quot;burning west&quot;) is in the mountain range&#x27;s rain shadow and is noticeably drier; it is home to Fiji&#x27;s tropical dry forests. Accordingly, sugar cane production thrives in the west, while a dairy industry is being developed in the east. Fiji&#x27;s largest cattle ranch, with 7000 head of cattle on , is in Yaqara, midway between Tavua and Rakiraki. The island of Viti Levu is the only known home of one of the world&#x27;s largest insects, the Giant Fijian long-horned beetle.

The island is susceptible to the effects of climate change. It is estimated that the compound effects of sea level rise and storm surge may result in a temporary relocation of a relatively high numbers of the inhabitants of Viti Levu, predominantly the northern and western parts, with an exposure of up to 6.75% of the islands&#x27; population in the future.

== Localities ==

Viti Levu is home to the capital city of Suva, and to nearly three quarters of the population of the Republic of Fiji (about 580,000 people). Other important towns and cities, which are spread out all along the coast, include Ba, Lautoka, Nadi, Nausori, Rakiraki, and Sigatoka. Two other well-known localities are Natadola Beach in Natadola (a luxurious Intercontinental Fiji Golf Resort and Spa &amp; boutique accommodation at Natadola Beach Resort &amp; Yatule Beach Resort), and Pacific Harbour (a resort centre about 50 kilometers from Suva). A single major road runs around the perimeter of Viti Levu.

== Politics ==
Eight of Fiji&#x27;s fourteen Provinces are in Viti Levu. The Provinces of Ba, Nadroga-Navosa, and Ra comprise the Western Division, while Naitasiri, Namosi, Rewa, Serua, and Tailevu form the Central Division. The political dynamics of western Viti Levu are somewhat different from those of eastern Viti Levu, in part because western Vitu Levu has a high concentration of Indo-Fijians (many of whose ancestors came to the island from India as indentured workers between 1879 and 1916), whereas eastern Viti Levu has a high concentration of indigenous Fijians (except in its urban areas, which are more racially diverse).

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
Viti Levu is believed to have been inhabited longer than the island of Vanua Levu, which lies to its north. According to oral tradition, the first Melanesian settlers landed at Vuda Point and established Viseisei as Fiji&#x27;s first oldest settlement. There is archaeological evidence contradicting this account.

== Transportation ==
Ferry service, provided by the Patterson Brothers Shipping Company, connects Viti Levu to the rest of the islands.

Nausori International Airport is on the main island. It has service on 3 domestic commercial passenger airlines.

<doc id="874996" wikidata="Q2293137" url="?curid=874996" title="Jay North">
<text>Jay Waverly North Jr. (born August 3, 1951) is an American former actor. His career as a child actor began in the late 1950s with roles in eight TV series, two variety shows, and three feature films. At age 7 he became a household name for his role as the good-natured but mischievous Dennis Mitchell on the CBS situation comedy &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (1959–1963), based on the comic strip created by Hank Ketcham.

As a teen, North had roles in two Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer feature films: &quot;Zebra in the Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Maya&quot;. He also starred in the NBC television series adaptation of the latter film. As an adult, he turned to voice acting for animated television series, voicing the roles of Prince Turhan in the &quot;Arabian Knights&quot; segment of &quot;The Banana Splits Adventure Hour&quot;, and a teenaged Bamm-Bamm Rubble on &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot;.

After leaving show business, he began working with fellow former child star Paul Petersen and the organization A Minor Consideration, using his experiences as a child performer to counsel other children working in the entertainment industry.

==Early life==
North was born in Hollywood, the only child of Jay and Dorothy (née Cotton) North. North&#x27;s father was an alcoholic, and his parents&#x27; marriage was turbulent. When he was four, his parents separated, and North never saw his father again. He briefly resided happily in Birmingham, Alabama. His mother worked as the secretary to the West Coast director of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA).

From a young age, North was a fan of television. When he was six, his mother used her connections at AFTRA to arrange for him to appear on his favorite television program, local Los Angeles children&#x27;s show &quot;Cartoon Express&quot;, hosted by Engineer Bill. Prominent Hollywood talent agent Hazel MacMillan was impressed with the photogenic boy, contacting his mother the following day offering to represent him. His mother was aware of the stories of troubled former child stars, and had reservations but eventually gave her approval.

==Career==

===Early years===

North&#x27;s first professional acting job was a live appearance on the gameshow &quot;Queen for a Day&quot;, hosted by Jack Bailey. He continued to work as a child model and actor in commercials, and landed small parts on a number of popular NBC variety shows of the 1950s, such as &quot;The George Gobel Show&quot;, &quot;The Eddie Fisher Show&quot;, and &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot;, before auditioning for the role that made him a star.

In June 1958, Columbia Pictures&#x27;s television division Screen Gems was holding a nationwide search for a boy to play the title character in their television adaptation of the popular &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; comic strip by Hank Ketcham, and 6-year-old North auditioned. After receiving news that his first audition had not gone well, agent Hazel MacMillan pressed the studio to see him again. The studio agreed and was impressed with his second audition. After hundreds of other boys&#x27; auditions, North was asked back to screen test with Herbert Anderson, Gloria Henry, and Joseph Kearns. A pilot was filmed later that summer.

The season passed, and North heard nothing more from Screen Gems, but continued to work, appearing in a Christmas-themed episode of the CBS Western series &quot;&quot; titled &quot;Eight Cent Reward&quot;. In the episode, he portrayed Laddie Stone, a young boy who pays bounty hunter Josh Randall (Steve McQueen) eight cents to find Santa Claus. Over the next several months, North made television appearances on such shows as &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Rescue 8&quot;, &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, &quot;Bronco&quot;, &quot;Colt .45&quot;, and &quot;Sugarfoot&quot;, and broke into feature films with roles in &quot;The Miracle of the Hills&quot; and &quot;The Big Operator.&quot; In early 1959, North was confirmed to play Dennis.

=== &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; ===

&quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; premiered on CBS on Sunday, October 4, 1959, and quickly became a hit with audiences. North was paid per episode, his strawberry red hair was bleached platinum blonde for the role, and the 8-year-old was instructed to &quot;shave&quot; a year off his age when speaking with the press. His mother continued to work at AFTRA full-time, and hired business managers to invest his earnings. In a 1993 interview with &quot;Filmfax&quot; magazine, North spoke highly of his mother, saying: &quot;I want to make it very clear about one thing. I never supported my mother during [&quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;]. She earned her own money from AFTRA. She never lived off my earnings. I know that sometimes happens with child actors, but it was not true in my situation.&quot;

While his mother worked, her sister Marie Hopper and brother-in-law actor-composer Hal Hopper served as his on-set guardians during filming for &quot;Dennis The Menace&quot;. In addition to filming the series, he appeared as Dennis in commercials for the show&#x27;s sponsors, Kellogg&#x27;s cereals, Best Foods mayonnaise, Skippy peanut butter, and Bosco chocolate milk, and regularly traveled around the country with his aunt and uncle on the weekends to promote the show. These obligations, combined with the required three hours a day of school, took their toll on him, and by the end of the first season, the 8-year-old had begun to feel the pressures of being the lead star of a popular show.

In late 1960, the second season of the series was ranked among TV&#x27;s top 20 shows, and his portrayal of Dennis had become a beloved pop culture icon. He made crossover guest appearances as Dennis on such television shows as &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; and &quot;The Red Skelton Hour,&quot; and in the feature film &quot;Pépé&quot;. That year, North recorded &quot;The Misadventures of Dennis the Menace&quot; soundtrack stories on LP, and an LP album of songs titled &quot;Jay North - Look who&#x27;s singing!&quot;. With the success of the series, the Hoppers became strict taskmasters and stern disciplinarians. He was not allowed to socialize with other cast members on the set and missed being around children his own age. He ate alone in his dressing room. His only opportunity to relax was the occasional &quot;free day&quot; when he could play baseball with other children or when his uncle would take him to see horror films. His favorite films at that time were &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; and &quot;Village of the Damned&quot;.
By late 1961, the series was in its third season, and North was earning per episode. The show remained in the top 20, but North had grown tired and frustrated with the pressures of carrying a hit show and the long work hours. Complicating matters was his relationship with his aunt Marie. Many years later, North revealed that his aunt physically and verbally abused him when he made mistakes on the set or did not perform to her standards. He said if he failed a line, she would take him behind the set and beat him. For years, it was too painful for him to watch reruns. His mother and the rest of the &quot;Dennis The Menace&quot; cast were unaware of the abuse, and he concealed his unhappiness due to threatened retribution from his aunt. In a 1993 interview, North&#x27;s childhood co-star, Jeannie Russell, said, &quot;If Jay says she abused him in private, then I&#x27;m inclined to believe it. The sheer demands of being in every scene all by itself had to be extremely stressful. Any extra pressure from [his aunt] would have made it unbearable.&quot; In 2007, she said: &quot;&#x27;The show comes first.&#x27; This was the ethic that we were raised in. Had I seen any abuse or any horrible upset on Jay&#x27;s part, I would have noticed. It would have impacted me. It would have upset me terribly.&quot;

By the fourth season, North was earning an episode; but by 1962, the 11-year-old had begun to outgrow the character&#x27;s childish antics. This, combined with the unexpected death of the actor who played Dennis&#x27; foil, Mr. Wilson (Joseph Kearns), near the end of season three, had changed the dynamic of the show. During his interview with &quot;Filmfax&quot;, North recalled: &quot;Between the pressures of the business and Joe&#x27;s dying, I became very serious, very morbid, and very withdrawn from the world. I was the antithesis of the little kid that I played on the television show.&quot; By the end of the fourth season, ratings were down, and in early 1963, to his relief, &quot;Dennis The Menace&quot; was canceled.

===Teen years===

In late 1963, North&#x27;s mother enrolled him in prep school, but due to his part-time education while filming &quot;Dennis The Menace&quot;, combined with not having been allowed to socialize with other children, he struggled to keep up with his studies at his new school and was nervous interacting with the other students. North continued to audition, and in 1964, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, but found himself typecast as the impish Dennis Mitchell and had trouble finding steady work. In 1999, North told the E! network, &quot;I had to fight the ghost of Dennis the Menace, and I was typecast. I still had the face, and that&#x27;s what casting directors, producers and directors saw when I would go in to read for a role.&quot;

In 1965, he landed the lead role in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer family comedy film &quot;Zebra in the Kitchen&quot; as Chris Carlyle, a boy who, unhappy with the living conditions he finds at his local zoo, decides to set the animals free, causing chaos throughout the town. Over the next year, he continued to appear in small television roles, guest-starring on the MGM TV series &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; and reuniting with his former &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; co-star Gale Gordon on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. In 1966, North landed the starring role in another MGM family adventure film, &quot;Maya&quot;. In the movie, which was filmed on location in India, North played Terry Bowen, a boy who navigates the Indian jungle with a Hindu boy and an elephant and her baby calf, the latter a sacred white elephant. He continued to appear in small guest-starring roles on television shows such as &quot;My Three Sons&quot; and &quot;Jericho&quot;, and in 1967, NBC decided to make a television series adaptation of &quot;Maya&quot;. North agreed to reprise his role and was soon back filming on location in India.

The feature film &quot;Maya&quot; and subsequent television series made North a popular teen idol of the era, featured in numerous teen magazines such as &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;, &quot;16 Magazine&quot;, &quot;Teen Datebook&quot;, and &quot;Flip&quot;. While &quot;Maya&quot; proved popular with teen audiences, the NBC series struggled in its time slot against popular shows of the time, CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Dating Game&quot; and &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, and was cancelled after one season. Years later, North spoke fondly of his experience on the series, saying, &quot;I can say that I&#x27;m really proud of my work on &quot;Maya&quot;, from a professional standpoint. I got to play an adult role and it was a challenge.&quot; North had missed a full year of school while filming &quot;Maya&quot; in India, and after returning home to Hollywood, began a normal life in high school, graduating from Rexford Senior High School in Beverly Hills in 1969.
North narrated the surf film, &quot;The Fantastic Plastic Machine&quot;, in 1969 

===Adult years===

After completing filming on the &quot;Maya&quot; television series, North found work as a voice actor for animated television series, providing the voices of Prince Turhan in the &quot;Arabian Knights&quot; segment of &quot;The Banana Splits Adventure Hour&quot;, Terry Dexter in &quot;Here Comes the Grump&quot;, and a teenaged Bamm-Bamm Rubble on &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot;. In 1971, he left Hollywood for Chicago to perform in dinner theater, appearing in several stage productions, including principal roles in &quot;Norman, Is That You?&quot; and &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot;. In January 1972, while appearing in &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot;, 20-year-old North met actress Kathleen Brucher, who had a four-year-old son from a previous marriage. After touring with the production for over a year, the two returned to Los Angeles and were married on July 20, 1973, but the marriage lasted less than a year. The young couple separated in April 1974, and their divorce was final on October 21, 1974.

In 1974, North appeared in his last starring role in the R-rated coming-of-age suspense thriller &quot;The Teacher&quot;, opposite Angel Tompkins. Though the film&#x27;s adult themes were branded &quot;vulgar&quot; and &quot;lurid&quot; by some who still thought of North as his Dennis performance 10 years prior, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Kevin Thomas appreciated North&#x27;s work in the film, writing,
The plot of &quot;The Teacher&quot; isn&#x27;t worth outlining, yet it develops a relationship between a 28-year-old woman and an 18-year-old high school boy with sensitivity and credibility unusual for an exploitation film. [...] Avedis displays much concern for his people and allows Miss Tompkins and North plenty of room to give fresh, spontaneous performances.&quot;

Over the next several years, North held onto the hope of being rediscovered by Hollywood and continued to take acting classes, but by early 1977, disillusioned with his career in show business, he left acting and enlisted in the US Navy. In January 1977, he reported to Navy boot camp at NTC Orlando. He was assigned to the , stationed in Norfolk, Virginia, as a seaman recruit boatswain&#x27;s mate, the Navy&#x27;s lowest rank. He received good evaluations for his work, but was unprepared for the harsh treatment he received from his shipmates and superiors for being a former child star. Within a year, he wanted out of the Navy. He then began his administrative process and was temporarily assigned on board the destroyer tender stationed in Long Beach, California. On August 10, 1979, he left the &quot;Dixie&quot; and the Navy with an honorable discharge and returned to Los Angeles.

In 1980, he appeared in a cameo role in the television movie &quot;Scout&#x27;s Honor&quot;, with other former child stars Angela Cartwright from &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;, Lauren Chapin from &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, and Paul Petersen from &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;. In 1982, he landed a week-long stint on the daytime soap &quot;General Hospital&quot;, but steady work in show business continued to elude him. Financially secure from real estate investments his mother had made with his earnings from &quot;Dennis The Menace&quot; and frustrated by the direction his career had taken, he retreated from public life for the next several years and worked in the health food industry. In 1984, he optioned the book &quot;Burn Judy, Burn&quot; for $5,000, hoping to play the lead role of executed killer Steven Judy. In his 1999 interview with E!, North spoke of his desire to play darker roles: &quot;I was ready to play very dramatic, scary type characters. I thought maybe if I played some villains and scared the pants off of people, maybe Hollywood might take me seriously.&quot; However, the Steven Judy story never made it to the screen.

In January 1986, North landed a small role in the Yugoslavian feature film &quot;Divlji Vetar&quot; (&quot;Wild Wind&quot;). Later that year, he read for the role of serial killer Ted Bundy in the television miniseries &quot;The Deliberate Stranger&quot;, but lost the part to Mark Harmon. Still interested in stories about serial killers, North decided to try his hand at screenwriting. His first script was about a 1984 prison break by six death-row inmates from Virginia&#x27;s Mecklenburg Correctional Center, but the screenplay was never completed. Throughout the rest of the 1980s, he appeared with other former television stars on news and talk shows such as &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Donahue&quot;, and &quot;Oprah&quot;. In October 1988, he acted out his frustrations toward Hollywood in a comedy sketch on an episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Not Necessarily the News&quot;, spoofing his role as Dennis the Menace. Dressed in overalls, striped t-shirt, and cowlick, 37-year-old North portrayed an angry adult Dennis, taking revenge on &quot;Hollywood pigs&quot; with a telescopic rifle.

==After acting==

===Hoaxes===
On the morning of December 8, 1988, North was at the center of a widely reported hoax. His mother received the news that he had died in a doctor&#x27;s office that morning. According to a story from United Press International, his body had been found at 12:35 that morning. The article quoted an alleged doctor, Robert Tobias, whom North had actually never met. Around this same time, he also dealt with several impostors. One man, who resembled North in his youth, rented limousines and attended Hollywood parties impersonating him. At the time, North told Knight-Ridder news agency, &quot;I&#x27;m not on the &#x27;A&#x27; party list. I&#x27;m not a hot item, so they don&#x27;t know what I look like. I really haven&#x27;t worked a lot in a long time.&quot;

===A Minor Consideration===
On January 18, 1990, North received a phone call from Paul Petersen telling him that former child star Rusty Hamer from &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; had died by suicide. Hamer&#x27;s death was a turning point for North when childhood friends Petersen (Jeff Stone on &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;) and Jeannie Russell (Margaret Wade on &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;), concerned with North&#x27;s similarities, put him in contact with therapist Stan W. Ziegler, who specialized in troubled former child actors. North later joined Petersen&#x27;s organization, A Minor Consideration, using his experiences to counsel child stars dealing with the same pressures and difficulties he had faced growing up.

==Personal life==
On March 2, 1991, North married his second wife, Rositia. The couple had met on a blind date and separated only 3 months after their wedding. On April 14, 1992, he met caterer Cindy Hackney at a party after a charity event for pediatric AIDS in Gainesville, Florida. On March 3, 1993, they were married, and three months later, still financially well-off as a result of his mother&#x27;s investments of his earnings as a child star, North left Los Angeles and moved to Hackney&#x27;s hometown of Lake Butler, Florida, becoming stepfather to her three daughters. This move was a permanent break from the Hollywood area that had troubled him. That year, with the release of the 1993 feature film &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, the media sought what had become of the &quot;original&quot; Dennis. This renewed interest prompted him to publicly disclose the abuse he had experienced as a child star.

In May 1997, having come to terms with the physical and emotional abuse he had suffered at the hands of his aunt and uncle, North began attending memorabilia shows to meet with fans. After moving to Florida, he began working as a correctional officer, reportedly working with troubled youth within Florida&#x27;s juvenile justice system and as of 2011, continued to work for the Florida Department of Corrections.

Since the early 1990s, North has made occasional appearances on talk shows, documentaries, cameo appearances as &quot;himself&quot; on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and in the comedy feature film &quot;Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star&quot;. In 1999, he concluded his E! interview by saying, &quot;I am so happy that I was able to have such a positive impact on people&#x27;s lives. I&#x27;m going to write my autobiography and then I&#x27;m just going to live a contented, happy life here in Lake Butler with the people I love, and kind of just vanish into the mists of time.&quot;

<doc id="875001" wikidata="Q352434" url="?curid=875001" title="Ferdinand Cheval">
<text>Ferdinand Cheval (; 19 April 1836 – 19 August 1924), often nicknamed Facteur Cheval (&quot;Mail Carrier Cheval&quot;) was a French mail carrier who spent 33 years building Le Palais idéal (the &quot;Ideal Palace&quot;) in Hauterives, in southeastern France. It is regarded as an extraordinary example of naïve art architecture.

== Origins ==
Cheval was born in Charmes-sur-l&#x27;Herbasse to a poor farming family. He left school at age 13 to become a baker&#x27;s apprentice, but eventually became a mail carrier.

In 1858, he married his first wife, Rosaline Revol. They had two sons, Victorin Joseph Fernand (1864) and Ferdinand Cyril (1867). Victorin died after only a year, in 1865. Rosaline herself died in 1873. Five years later, Cheval met and married Claire-Philomène Richaud. Her dowry included the land on which the &quot;Palais Idéal&quot; stands today. In 1878, she gave birth to their daughter, Alice-Marie-Philomène, who died in 1894 at the age of 15. Alice&#x27;s death hit Cheval the hardest and she was the last child he would have. 18 years later, his son Cyril and second wife Claire died within two years of each other, in 1912 and 1914, respectively.

== Palais idéal ==
Cheval began building the &quot;Palais Idéal&quot; in 1879 when he was 43. He reported:

&quot;I was walking very fast when my foot caught on something that sent me stumbling a few metres away, I wanted to know the cause. [Previously, in] a dream, I had built a palace, a castle or caves, I cannot express it well [...] I told no one about it for fear of being ridiculed and I felt ridiculous myself.

&quot;Then fifteen years later, when I had almost forgotten my dream, when I wasn&#x27;t thinking of it at all, my foot reminded me of it. My foot tripped on a stone that almost made me fall. I wanted to know what it was [...] It was a stone of such a strange shape that I put it in my pocket to admire it at my leisure.

&quot;The next day, I went back to the same place. I found more stones, even more beautiful, I gathered them together on the spot and was overcome with delight [...] It&#x27;s a sandstone shaped by water and hardened by the power of time. It becomes as hard as pebbles. It represents a sculpture so strange that it is impossible for man to imitate, it represents any kind of animal, any kind of caricature.

&quot;I said to myself: since Nature is willing to do the sculpture, I will do the masonry and the architecture.&quot;

For the next 33 years, Cheval picked up stones during his daily mail rounds and carried them home to build the &quot;Palais idéal&quot;. At first, he carried the stones in his pockets, then switched to a basket. Eventually, he used a wheelbarrow. He often worked at night, by the light of an oil lamp. He spent the first 20 years building the outer walls.

The palace materials mainly consist of stones (river washed), pebbles, porous tufa and fossils of different shapes and sizes. When visitors arrive at the palace, the first thing they see is the southern facade, approximately long and up to high. The decoration resembles aspects of both the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, England and Antoni Gaudí&#x27;s Sagrada Família. Cheval did not travel and had even given himself the title of peasant, so even though some qualities of his work resemble those pieces of art, he had never seen them.

In his essay on the achievement, John Berger writes: “Cheval himself called his Palace a temple to nature. Not a temple to the nature of travellers, landscapists, or even Jean-Jacques Rousseau, but to nature as dreamt by a genius expressing the vision of a class of cunning, hardened survivors.”

Three giant stones, each with doll-like faces, standing about 10.5 metres high, serve not only as decoration but as a support system for the Barbary Tower, with a line of cement swans leading up to a spiral staircase. The three giant stones were named after Vercingétorix, Archimedes and Julius Caesar, the names of each hand-carved by Cheval into each individual figure.

The north facade exhibits a long path dotted with large openings to provide plentiful light leading into the heart of the palace itself. This facade is strikingly forest-like: walls are coated in moss and massive seaweed. The ceiling&#x27;s swirling patterns of pebbles and shells outline the chandeliers. Upper walls are lined with horizontal bands that have animals carved into them, Egyptian style. Other animals on the north facade include two ostriches (presumably mother and father) and an ostrich chick, a tall camel, flamingos, octopuses, lions, dragons, and a polar bear.

The east facade took the longest to build, 20 years. It includes the Temple of Nature, an Egyptian style temple-like structure supported by large, thick sandstone columns. It includes two waterfalls called the Source of Life and the Source of Wisdom.

The &quot;Palais&quot; is a mix of different styles, with inspirations from Christianity to Hinduism. Cheval bound the stones together with lime, mortar and cement.

The palace is sprinkled with short quotes and poems, hand-carved by Cheval himself. Some examples being &quot;If you look for gold you will find it in elbow grease.&quot;, &quot;The Pantheon of an obscure hero.&quot; &quot;The work of one man&quot;, &quot;Out of a dream I have brought forth the Queen of the World&quot;, &quot;This is of art, and of energy&quot;, &quot;The ecstasy of a beautiful dream and the prize of effort&quot;, &quot;Dream of a peasant&quot;, &quot;Temple of Life&quot;, and &quot;Palace of the Imagination&quot;. Perhaps the most iconic phrase he inscribed on the wall reads &quot;1879–1912 days, hours, 33 years of struggle. Let those who think they can do better try.&quot;

== Burial ==

Cheval also wanted to be buried in his palace. When, however, the French authorities prohibited that, he spent eight more years building a mausoleum for himself in the Hauterives cemetery. He died on 19 August 1924, about a year after he had finished building it, and is buried there.

== Recognition ==
Just before his death, Cheval received recognition from figures including André Breton, Bernard Buffet, Robert Doisneau, and Pablo Picasso. His work is commemorated in an essay by Anaïs Nin. In 1932, the German artist Max Ernst created a collage titled &quot;The Postman Cheval&quot;. The collage belongs to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection and is on display there. In 1958, Ado Kyrou produced &quot;Le Palais idéal&quot;, a short film about Cheval&#x27;s palace.

After admiring Cheval&#x27;s work, Picasso created a series of drawings telling a narrative, in a cartoon fashion, which is now recognized as Facteur Cheval sketchbook in 1937. Picasso drew him as a twisted, hybrid-like creature (or beast), carved with the initials of the French postal service (P.T.T.) on his skin, dressed in typical postman&#x27;s attire, holding masonry tools and a letter. The creature was standing in front of his creation. In the drawing, Picasso took a humorous route, sketching Cheval&#x27;s body in the shape of a horse and his head that of a bird. Picasso did this in an effort to make a sort of pun about Cheval&#x27;s name and career, given birds are messengers (as Cheval was a postman) and the meaning of Cheval is horse.

In 1969, André Malraux, the minister of Culture, declared the &quot;Palais&quot; a cultural landmark and had it officially protected. In 1986, Cheval was put on a French postage stamp.

In 2018, French director Nils Tavernier released the feature film (English: &quot;The Ideal Palace&quot;) about Cheval&#x27;s life and work, with Jacques Gamblin starring as Cheval.

In 2018 Will Varley included the song &quot;The Postman&quot; about Cheval and the Palais Idéal on his studio album &quot;Spirit of Minnie&quot;.

<text>Louis Enricht (c. 1844–1923) was a US inventor who claimed that he had invented a substitute for gasoline.
==Claimed gasoline substitute==
In 1916, during World War I, Enricht announced that he had invented a cheap substance that, added to ordinary tap water, would be a substitute for gasoline.

Henry Ford visited Enrich at Farmington along with Fords&#x27; New York manager in 1918.

In a press conference in Farmingdale, Long Island, he first asked the reporters to check that there was no supplementary tank in the car he had brought. Then he asked one of the reporters to fetch him a bucket of water. He poured greenish liquid into water and filled a gas tank of the car with it. When the car started, it also emitted a strong smell of almonds. Enricht invited the witnesses to use it in their own vehicles.

Enricht admitted that the smell of almonds came from cyanide, but until his lawyer could patent the formula, he kept silent about it. He received millions of dollars - including $100,000 from Hiram Maxim who said he would pay the rest when Enricht would reveal his formula.

Maxim reputedly later dropped the offer, but a banker named Yoakum offered Enricht the same amount. Yoakum received a sealed envelope that supposedly contained the formula. When he heard a - probably unfounded - rumor that Enricht was suspected of being a German spy, he opened the envelope - breaking his part of the agreement - and found only a couple of liberty bonds. He failed to get Enricht tried for treason.

Miller Reese Hutchison observed a demonstration given by Enricht and concluded that an acetylene solution had been used. His own tests with such a solution showed corrosion and other damage to the engine from using an acetylene solution.

Hudson Maxim said the Hudson Munitions Company only had an option on the supposed fuel and wouldn&#x27;t buy all rights unless tests confirmed claims. Hudson Maxim personally expressed doubts about Enrichts&#x27; claims.
==Claim to distill gasoline from peat==
In 1920, Enricht announced that he had a way to distill gasoline from peat. Again he received a number of would-be-investors. However, district attorney of the Nassau County had decided to investigate. He examined Enricht&#x27;s bank account and found out that he had spent the money for gambling, instead of benefiting other investors. A demonstration of a machine to produce naphtha from peat in court failed. Louis Enricht blamed the failure on the machine having been dismantled and reassembled, however, the judge refused to allow further demonstrations in court. Enricht was tried for grand larceny and sentenced for seven years.

==Death==
Enricht was paroled a couple of years later for health reasons and died a year later at the age of 79.

Enricht never revealed the secret formula to anyone nor what the &quot;greenish liquid&quot; was he used in every demonstration to anyone. However, it is a fact that a mixture of acetone, liquid acetylene, and water will run a gasoline car motor and the exhaust gas smells like cyanide. However, it will also prematurely corrode the engine and is much more expensive than gasoline.

<text>Elmyr de Hory (born Elemér Albert Hoffmann; April 14, 1906 – December 11, 1976) was a famed Hungarian-born painter and art forger. It is claimed he was responsible for producing over a thousand forgeries that were sold to reputable art galleries all over the world. His activities garnered celebrity from a Clifford Irving book, &quot;Fake&quot; (1969), and a documentary essay film by Orson Welles, &quot;F for Fake&quot; (1974).

== Early life ==
De Hory claimed that he was born into an aristocratic family, that his father was an Austro-Hungarian ambassador and that his mother came from a family of bankers. However, subsequent investigation has suggested that de Hory more likely had a middle-class childhood; he was born Elemér Albert Hoffmann on April 14, 1906. (An acquaintance, Fernand Legros, said that de Hory was born in Budapest (Hungary) 14 April 1905, but that de Hory would change the date to 1914 to appear younger.) Both his parents were Jewish. His father&#x27;s occupation was listed as &quot;wholesaler of handcrafted goods.&quot; His parents did not divorce when he was sixteen, as he had asserted in the Clifford Irving biography.

At the age of 16, he began his formal art training in the Nagybánya artists&#x27; colony (now in Romania). At 18, he joined the Akademie Heinmann art school in Munich, Germany, to study classical painting. In 1926 he moved to Paris and enrolled in the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, where he studied under Fernand Léger. By the time he concluded his traditional education in Paris in 1928, the focus of his studies in figurative art had been eclipsed by Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism and other nontraditional movements, all of which made his art appear passé, out of step with new trends and public tastes. This harsh reality and the economic shock waves of the Great Depression dimmed any prospects of his making a living from his art. New evidence (Geneva police records) indicates charges and arrests for minor crimes during the late 1920s and &#x27;30s.

He returned to Hungary at the outbreak of the Second World War. Shortly after, he became involved with a British journalist and suspected spy. This friendship landed him in a Transylvanian prison for political dissidents in the Carpathian Mountains. During this time, de Hory befriended the prison camp officer by painting his portrait. Later, during the Second World War, de Hory was released.

Within a year, de Hory was imprisoned in a German concentration camp for being both a Jew and a homosexual. (His homosexuality was proven over time, and while investigation into his past has shown the likelihood that he was at one time christened as a Calvinist, such an ostensible religious affiliation did not stop the Nazi government from targeting a Jew for extermination.) He was severely beaten and was transferred to a Berlin prison hospital, from which he escaped. He returned to Hungary, and it was there, he said, that he learned that his parents had been killed and their estate confiscated. However, according to Mark Forgy&#x27;s account, both de Hory&#x27;s mother and brother were listed as Holocaust survivors.

== First forgeries ==
On arriving in Paris after the war, de Hory attempted to make an honest living as an artist, but soon discovered that he had an uncanny ability to copy the styles of noted painters. In 1946, he sold a pen-and-ink drawing to a British woman who mistook it for an original work by Picasso. His financial desperation trumped his scruples, as was most often the case for the next two decades. To his mind, it offered redemption from the starving artist scenario, buttressed by the comfortable rationalization that his buyers were getting something beautiful at &quot;friendly&quot; prices. He began to sell his Picasso pastiches to art galleries around Paris, claiming that he was a displaced Hungarian aristocrat and his offerings were what remained from his family&#x27;s art collection or else that he had acquired them directly from the artist, whom he had known during his years in Paris.

That same year, de Hory formed a partnership with Jacques Chamberlin, who became his art dealer. They toured Europe together, selling the forgeries until de Hory discovered that, although they were supposed to share the profits equally, Chamberlin had kept most of the money. De Hory ended the relationship and resumed selling his fakes on his own.

After a successful sale of drawings in Sweden, he bought a one-way ticket for Rio de Janeiro in 1947. There, living from the sales of his fakes, he resumed creating his own art, though the sales of his portraits, landscapes, and still lifes in his own avant-garde style did not bring in the kind of money he had become accustomed to from his newly created master works.

In August 1947 he visited the United States on a three-month visa and successfully sold Picasso forgeries to the art dealer Klaus Perls. He decided to stay there, moving between New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, and Chicago for the next twelve years. De Hory expanded his forgeries to include works in the manner of Henri Matisse, Amedeo Modigliani and Renoir. When some of the galleries de Hory had sold his forgeries to were becoming suspicious, he began to use pseudonyms and to sell his work by mail order. Some of de Hory&#x27;s many pseudonyms included &quot;Louis Cassou, Joseph Dory, Joseph Dory-Boutin, Elmyr Herzog, Elmyr Hoffman&quot; and &quot;E. Raynal&quot;. (Fernand Legros listed de Hory&#x27;s pseudonyms; &quot;Elmyr de Hory, Elmer Hoffman, Elementer alias Hofman, baron de Hory, Haury, Hury or Hurry, Hory, baron Raynal, Raynor, Raynol or Rainol, comte de Herzog, baron de Boughady, von Bonhyday, Boundjy, Elmyr Lazlo, Dauray, Dory, Boutin, Dory-Boutin, Cassou Robert or Cassou Charles, Louis Curiel or Curiel Charles.)

His success came to a halt in Boston after he sold one of his &quot;Matisse&quot; drawings to the Fogg Museum at Harvard University in the mid-1950s. Shortly after its sale, he offered a &quot;Modigliani&quot; and a &quot;Renoir&quot; drawing from his collection. An alert curator noticed a stylistic similarity among the three drawings and refused to buy his subsequent offerings. She then began contacting other institutions and galleries, asking if they knew or had purchased artworks from the debonair &quot;E. Raynal&quot;. The American art network thereby learned of the suave collector and seller of dubious works by modern masters.

== Forgery as a business ==

In 1955, de Hory sold several forgeries to Chicago art dealer Joseph W. Faulkner, who later discovered they were fakes. Faulkner pressed charges against de Hory and initiated a federal lawsuit against him, alleging mail and telephone fraud. De Hory later moved to Mexico City, where he was briefly detained and questioned by the police, not for his artistic endeavors but regarding his connection to a suspect in the murder of a British man, whom de Hory claimed he had never met. When the Mexican police attempted to extort money from him, de Hory hired a lawyer, who also attempted to extort money from him by charging exorbitant legal fees. De Hory paid the lawyer with one of his forgeries and returned to the United States.

On his return, de Hory discovered that his paintings were fetching high prices at several art galleries, and he was incensed that the galleries had only paid him a fraction of what they thought the works were worth. It is estimated that all de Hory forgeries were sold for more than $50 million in today&#x27;s value. Further compounding de Hory&#x27;s plight was that the manner of his forgeries had become recognizable, and he was now a person of interest to the FBI. This unwanted attention may have prompted de Hory to temporarily abandon his fakery and resume creating his own artwork once more. This led him to an ascetic existence in a low-rent apartment near Pershing Square in Los Angeles. Here, he had limited success, mostly selling paintings of pink poodles to interior decorators. However, his self-imposed exile was not to his liking. He decided to return to the East Coast return to producing art forgeries, for which he always found an eager buyer—eventually. In Washington, D.C., de Hory began an ill-fated association with a picture dealer that ended in disaster.

In 1959, suffering from depression, he attempted suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills. A friend rescued him and called an ambulance. His stomach was pumped, and after a stay in the hospital de Hory convalesced in New York City, helped by an enterprising young man, Fernand Legros. Legros&#x27;s account of his dealings with de Hory differs substantially from de Hory&#x27;s own. He portrays de Hory as an aggressive and persistent con man, who suckers Legros into the belief that he is a needy impoverished aristocrat deserving of Legros&#x27;s charity, whereas in reality he is a person wanted by Interpol under a multitude of different aliases and convicted of a variety of crimes, forgery and fraud being not the least of them; de Horys is the object of pursuits, convictions and expulsions from France, Switzerland, Italy, Federal Germany, Great Britain, Mexico, the United States, and Canada, for false check writing without funds, check forgery, committing forgery while carrying a false name, theft, receiving and purveying of stolen goods, and embezzlement.

In de Hory&#x27;s account, Legros accompanied de Hory back to Miami where he continued to regain his health. When he imprudently took Legros into his confidence, the other man quickly recognized an opportunity and importuned the artist to let him sell his work in exchange for a 40% cut of the profits, with Legros assuming all the risks inherent in the sale of forgeries. With Legros, de Hory again toured the United States. In time, Legros demanded his cut be increased to 50%, when in reality Legros was already keeping much of the profit. On one of these trips Legros met Réal Lessard, a French-Canadian who later became his lover. The two had a volatile relationship, and in late 1959 de Hory decided to leave the two and return to Europe.

In Paris, de Hory unexpectedly ran into Legros. De Hory revealed to him that some of his forgeries were still back in New York. According to de Hory, Legros devised a plan to steal the paintings and sell them, making a name for himself and his art gallery in the process. Later that year, de Hory&#x27;s account continues, Legros persuaded de Hory to resume their partnership. Legros and Lessard would continue to sell de Hory&#x27;s work and agreed to pay him a flat fee of $400 a month, enough to guarantee de Hory a comfortable and risk-free life in his newfound home, the Spanish Mediterranean island of Ibiza.

De Hory always denied that he had ever signed any of his forgeries with the name of the artist whom he was imitating. This is an important legal matter, since painting in the style of an artist is not a crime—only signing a painting with another artist&#x27;s name makes it a forgery. This may be true, as Legros may have signed the paintings with the false names.

== Unmasking ==

In 1964, then 58 years old, de Hory began to tire of the forgery business, and soon his work began to suffer. Consequently, many art experts began noticing that the paintings they were receiving were forgeries. Some of the galleries examining de Hory&#x27;s work alerted Interpol, and the police were soon on the trail of Legros and Lessard. Legros sent de Hory to Australia for a year to keep him out of the eye of the investigation.

By 1966, more of de Hory&#x27;s paintings were being revealed as forgeries; one man in particular, Texas oil magnate Algur H. Meadows, to whom Legros had sold 56 forged paintings, was so outraged to learn that most of his collection was forged that he demanded the arrest and prosecution of Legros. Alarmed, Legros decided to hide from the police at de Hory&#x27;s house on Ibiza, where he asserted ownership and threatened to evict de Hory. Coupled with this and with Legros&#x27;s increasingly violent mood swings, de Hory decided to leave Ibiza. Legros and Lessard were apprehended soon thereafter and imprisoned on charges of check fraud.

De Hory continued to elude the police for some time but, tired of life in exile, decided to move back to Ibiza to accept his fate. In August 1968, a Spanish court convicted him of the crimes of homosexuality, showing no visible means of support, and consorting with criminals (Legros), sentencing him to two months in prison in Ibiza. He was never directly charged with forgery because the court could not prove that he had ever created any forgeries on Spanish soil. He was released in October 1968 and expelled from Ibiza for one year. During that time, he resided in Torremolinos, Spain.

One year following his release, de Hory, by then a celebrity, returned to Ibiza. He told his story to Clifford Irving, who wrote the biography &quot;Fake! The Story of Elmyr de Hory the Greatest Art Forger of Our Time&quot;. De Hory appeared in several television interviews and was featured with Irving in the Orson Welles documentary &quot;F for Fake&quot; (1973). In Welles&#x27;s film, de Hory questioned what it was that made his forgeries inferior to the actual paintings created by the artists he imitated, particularly since they had fooled so many experts and were always appreciated when it was believed that they were genuine. In &quot;F for Fake&quot;, Welles also poses questions about the nature of the creative process, how trickery, illusion, and duplicity often prevail in the art world, and thus, in some respects, downplays the culpability of the art forger de Hory and outliers like him.

== Death ==
During the early 1970s, de Hory again decided to resume painting, hoping to exploit his newfound fame: this time, he would sell his own, original work. While he had gained some recognition in the art world, he made little profit, and he soon learned that French authorities were attempting to extradite him to stand trial on fraud charges. This took quite some time, as Spain and France had no extradition treaty at that time.

On December 11, 1976, de Hory&#x27;s live-in bodyguard and companion Mark Forgy informed him that the Spanish government had agreed to extradite de Hory to France. Shortly thereafter, de Hory took an overdose of sleeping pills, and asked Forgy to accept his decision and not intervene or prevent him from taking his life. However, Forgy later went for help to take de Hory to a local hospital, though en route he died in Forgy&#x27;s arms. Clifford Irving has expressed doubts about de Hory&#x27;s death, claiming that he may have faked his own suicide in order to escape extradition, but Forgy has dismissed this theory.

<text>Haydée Tamara Bunke Bider (November 19, 1937 – August 31, 1967) was an Argentine-born East German revolutionary known for her involvement in feminism, leftist politics, and liberation movements.

Born to communist parents, Bunke joined the Free German Youth at fifteen and later studied philosophy at university. She was recruited as an interpreter for the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, where she met Che Guevara during his 1960 visit to Leipzig. In 1961, she moved to Cuba and participated in the Cuban literacy campaign and Federation of Cuban Women.

Bunke was recruited for Bolivian Campaign, Che Guevara&#x27;s guerrilla expedition in Bolivia aimed at sparking revolution across Latin America. Using the alias Tania, she infiltrated Bolivian high society and developed ties with Bolivian President René Barrientos.

In 1966, her cover was blown, leading her to join Guevara&#x27;s armed guerrilla campaign in Bolivia. During this time, she was responsible for the food and monitoring radio communications. Bunke was killed in 1967 during an ambush by Bolivian Army Rangers while attempting to escape with a leg injury and fever.

==Early life==
Born in November 1937 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Tamara Bunke was the daughter of Erich Bunke and Nadia Bider. Nadia Bider Bunke, born in 1912, was a Russian communist who hailed from a Jewish family within the Russian Empire. Tamara&#x27;s father, Erich Bunke, relocated to Berlin at the age of 18 to pursue studies in architecture. Both Nadia and Erich took part in left-wing politics; however due to Nazi persecution, they were forced to flee to Argentina in 1935. Erich faced persecution for his involvement with the Communist Party of Germany, while Nadia, being of Jewish descent, also became a target of persecution.

Erich Bunke and Nadia Bider secured positions as teachers upon their arrival in Argentina. Shortly thereafter, they became members of the Communist Party of Argentina, ensuring that Tamara and her brother Olaf would both grow up in a Marxist-Leninist political atmosphere. Their family home in Buenos Aires was often used for meetings, helping communist refugees, hiding publications and occasionally stashing weapons. In 1952, after the end of World War II, the family came back to the newly created East Germany, specifically the town of Eisenhüttenstadt. 

Tamara played multiple musical instruments, including the piano, guitar, and accordion, with special interest in Latin American&#x27;s folk music. By the age of fourteen, she joined the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany&#x27;s (SUPG) youth organization, the Free German Youth (FGY), and by eighteen she joined the SUPG. In addition, she also joined the World Federation of Democratic Youth, allowing her to attend the World Festival of Youth and Students in Vienna, Prague, Moscow and Havana.

Bunke commenced her studies in philosophy or political science, depending on the source, at Humboldt University in East Berlin, where she distinguished herself due to her linguistic skills; she was fluent in English, Spanish, French and German. Bunke soon began working as a translator of several Latin American leaders during their visits to East Germany, particularly those associated with the FGY&#x27;s International Relations Department.

==Cuba==
After the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro dispatched emissaries to various socialist countries to garner support. In this capacity, in 1960, Che Guevara was sent to Leipzig, East Germany, as part of a Cuban trade delegation. Bunke was assigned to accompany him as his interpreter. Subsequently, in 1961, she received an invitation from Alicia Alonso to travel to Cuba.

She first worked as an interpreter for the Cuban National Ballet. She also involved herself in voluntary work, namely teaching and participating in the construction of homes and schools in rural areas. As a result, she participated in work brigades, the militia, and the Cuban Literacy Campaign. She also worked in the Ministry of Education, the Cuban Institute for Friendship Among People, and the Federation of Cuban Women, where she made close ties with Vilma Espín. Additionally, she registered for a journalism degree at the University of Havana. 

Tamara worked for the Asociación de Jóvenes Rebeldes, later known as the . She assisted in organizing an international student union conference in Havana. Tamara also joined the People&#x27;s Defense Militia and collaborated with various Latin American individuals who sought solidarity with their struggles, including Nicaraguan revolutionary Carlos Fonseca. She actively participated in the insurgency in Nicaragua, establishing connections with members of the Sandinista National Liberation Front.

Dámaso Tabares was entrusted with the task of selecting a &quot;compañera&quot; for &quot;Operation Fantasma&quot; in Bolivia. Three candidates were considered, and Tamara was eventually chosen for training to participate in Che Guevara&#x27;s guerrilla expedition. Guevara&#x27;s goal was to spark a continent-wide revolutionary uprising into neighboring Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil, Peru, and Chile.

In preparation, Guevara assigned Bunke to be trained by . It was during this period that she took the name &quot;Tania&quot; as her &quot;nom de guerre&quot; in honor of Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, a Soviet partisan who also used this alias. Between 1963 and 1964, she underwent training, culminating in a period of instruction in Prague, where she received training from the StB. It was during this training that she formed a romantic relationship with Dámaso Tabares.

==Bolivian insurgency==

In October 1964, Tamara Bunke, using the alias Laura Gutiérrez Bauer, arrived in Bolivia as an undercover agent in Che Guevara&#x27;s final revolutionary campaign. Her mission was to infiltrate Bolivia’s political and military elite to gather intelligence on the country&#x27;s power structures. Posing as a right-wing Argentine folklore expert, Bunke quickly gained access to high society in La Paz. She befriended high-ranking officials, including General Alfredo Ovando Candía, head of the Bolivian Army, and ultimately won the admiration of President René Barrientos, even accompanying him on a holiday to Peru.

To solidify her cover, Bunke pursued her interest in Bolivian folk music, resulting in one of the most comprehensive collections of Bolivian music. She also married a young Bolivian man in a marriage of convenience, securing citizenship and blending further into Bolivian society. Through her connections, Bunke gathered valuable intelligence on the Bolivian military and reported back to Guevara and Cuban intelligence.

In late 1966, Bunke&#x27;s role shifted as preparations began for the arrival of Guevara’s guerrilla forces in Bolivia. She was tasked with organizing safe houses that could also serve as storage sites for supplies and ammunition. However, her frequent cross-border travels to secure resources and accommodations for the incoming fighters raised suspicions and gradually put her cover at risk.

Originally, Bunke was meant to focus solely on intelligence gathering. But with limited personnel on the ground, she found herself actively involved in receiving the guerrillas upon their arrival and transporting them to the Ñancahuazú camp. Guevara himself, under a false identity, arrived at the camp in late 1966, and by March 23, 1967, the guerrilla group, known as the Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Bolivia, had officially launched its operations. Days later, Guevara handed Bunke an M-1 rifle, formally enlisting her in the guerrilla column led by Cuban commander Juan Vitalio Acuña Núñez. In one of her journeys to the Ñancahuazú base, Bunke left her jeep parked at a safe house, where a captured Bolivian communist later revealed its location to authorities. Inside the jeep, her address book was discovered, blowing her cover and forcing her to remain with Guevara’s forces.

As the campaign wore on, Bunke faced harsh conditions in the rugged Bolivian terrain. She began suffering from a high fever, a leg injury, and painful effects from a Chigoe flea infestation. Seeing her deteriorating health, Guevara decided to attempt an evacuation of 16 ailing guerrilla fighters from the mountains in hopes they could recover.

===Death===

Following Tania&#x27;s rise to prominence in Bolivia she became too easily identifiable, so Che initiated arrangements for her departure. On April 17, a detachment led by Juan Vitalio Acuña Núñez departed from the main guerrilla force due to injuries and illness, which included Tania. Guided by Honorato Rojas, a Bolivian peasant, the group was led to the location where Bolivian soldiers were strategically positioned and concealed.

At 5:20 pm on August 31, 1967, the lead guerrilla column was ambushed while crossing the Río Grande at Vado del Yeso. Tania was in the water, when she was shot in the arm and lung and killed along with eight of the insurgents. Her body was then carried downstream and only recovered by the Bolivian Army seven days later on September 6. Her corpse was supposedly transferred by helicopter to Vallegrande. Days later when her corpse was presented to Barrientos, it was decided that it would be buried in an unmarked grave with the rest of the guerrillas. However, the local campesino women said she be given a proper Christian burial.

On September 7, when her death was announced over the radio, Guevara, still struggling through the jungles close by, refused to believe the news; suspecting it was army propaganda to demoralize him. Later, when Fidel Castro learned of her demise, he declared &quot;Tania the guerrilla&quot; a hero of the Cuban Revolution.

After the research of biographer Jon Lee Anderson led to the discovery of Che Guevara&#x27;s remains in 1997, Bunke&#x27;s remains were also tracked down to an unmarked grave in a small pit on the periphery of the Vallegrande army base on October 13, 1998. They were transferred to Cuba and were interred in the Che Guevara Mausoleum in the city of Santa Clara, alongside those of Guevara himself and several other guerrillas killed during the Bolivian insurgency.

==Controversies==
Since her death, Bunke has been the subject of claims suggesting she was a triple agent for the Soviet KGB, East German Stasi, and Cuban intelligence, and that she had a romantic relationship with Che Guevara in Bolivia, possibly even carrying his child at the time of her death. However, in 2017, Dr. Abraham Baptista, who conducted autopsies on both Guevara and Bunke, refuted this. Additionally, in 2003, Bunke’s mother, Nadia, successfully had the book &quot;Tania, the Woman Che Guevara Loved&quot; by José A. Friedl removed from sale in Germany, as German courts deemed the allegations defamatory. The book repeated a debunked rumor that Bunke had an affair with Guevara while training in Prague, though records show they were never there at the same time.

==Popular culture==
Following Bunke&#x27;s death, the media swiftly sought to reduce her to merely Che Guevara&#x27;s romantic partner, thus diminishing her contributions to the Bolivian Campaign. Certain intellectuals associated her as a &quot;femme fatale&quot;, whose death was due to her extramarital affair with Che. Soviet-Ukrainian astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravleva named a minor planet discovered in 1974, 2283 Bunke, in her honour. Bunke has been depicted in numerous films, songs, and theatrical productions, most notably, portrayed by Franka Potente in the film &quot;Che&quot;. In fiction literature and games, Tamara&#x27;s presence is equally notable. Additionally, during Patty Hearst&#x27;s involvement with the Symbionese Liberation Army in 1974, she adopted the alias &quot;Tania.&quot;

<text>Charles Mallory Hatfield (July 15, 1875January 12, 1958) was an American &quot;rainmaker&quot;.

==Early life==
Hatfield was born in Fort Scott, Kansas, on July 15, 1875. His father, Stephen, a property speculator, moved the family to Southern California in 1886, settling first in San Diego, where Hatfield Sr built three houses. He later built a home on a forty acre ranch and olive grove at Gopher Canyon near Bonsall, forty miles north of the city. As an adult, Charles became a salesman for the New Home Sewing Machine Company. In 1904, he moved to Glendale, California.

== Career ==
As a young man growing up in Bonsall, Hatfield studied pluviculture and began to develop his own methods for producing rain, inspired by the way a boiling kettle attracted the water vapour rising from an adjacent, steaming pan on his mother&#x27;s stove. By 1902 he had created a secret mixture of 23 chemicals in large galvanized evaporating tanks that, he claimed, attracted rain. Hatfield called himself a &quot;moisture accelerator&quot;.

In 1904, promoter Fred Binney began a public relations campaign for Hatfield. A number of Los Angeles ranchers saw his ads in newspapers and promised Hatfield $50 to produce rain. In February, Hatfield and his brother Paul built an evaporating tower at La Crescenta where Hatfield released his mixture into the air. Hatfield&#x27;s attempt was apparently successful, so the ranchers paid him $100. Contemporary weather bureau reports described the rain as a small part of a storm that was already coming, but Hatfield&#x27;s supporters disregarded this.

Hatfield began to receive more job offers. He promised Los Angeles of rain, apparently succeeded, and collected a fee of $1000. For this effort, Hatfield had built his tower on the grounds of the Esperanza Sanitarium in Altadena, near Rubio Canyon.

In 1906, Hatfield was invited to the Yukon Territory, where he agreed to create rain for the water-dependent mines of the Klondike goldfields. The Klondike contract was for $10,000, but after unsuccessful efforts, Hatfield slipped away, collecting only $1,100 for expenses. This failure did not deter his supporters.

In 1915, the San Diego City Council, pressured by the San Diego Wide Awake Improvement Club, approached Hatfield to produce rain to fill the reservoir of Morena Dam. Hatfield offered to produce rain for free, then charge $1,000 per inch ($393.7 per centimetre) for between forty and fifty inches (1.02 to 1.27 m) and free again over fifty inches (1.27 m). The council voted four to one for a $10,000 fee, payable when the reservoir was filled. A formal agreement was never drawn up, though Hatfield continued based on verbal understanding. Hatfield, with his brother, built a tower beside Lake Morena and was ready early in the New Year.

On January 5, 1916, heavy rain began—and grew gradually heavier day by day. Dry riverbeds filled to the point of flooding. Worsening floods destroyed bridges, marooned trains and cut phone cables - not to mention flooding homes and farms. Two dams, Sweetwater Dam and one at Lower Otay Lake, overflowed. Rain stopped on 20 January but resumed two days later. On January 27 Lower Otay Dam broke, increasing the devastation and reportedly causing about 20 deaths (accounts vary on the exact number).

Hatfield talked to the press on February 4 and said that the damage was not his fault and that the city should have taken adequate precautions. Hatfield had fulfilled the requirements of his contract—filling the reservoir—but the city council refused to pay the money unless Hatfield would accept liability for damages; there were already claims worth $3.5 million. Besides, there was no written contract. Hatfield tried to settle for $4000 and then sued the council. The suit continued until 1938 when two courts decided that the rain was an act of God, which absolved him of any wrongdoing, but also meant Hatfield did not get his fee.

Hatfield&#x27;s fame only grew and he received more contracts for rainmaking. Among other things, in 1929 he was hired by the Standard Steamship and Fruit Company of New Orleans to stop a fire on a 100,000 acre banana plantation in Honduras Later the Bear Valley Mutual Water Company wanted to fill Big Bear Lake. However, during the Great Depression he had to return to his work as a sewing machine salesman. His wife Mable divorced him in 1931, claiming in the divorce settlement that Hatfield had hidden some of his earnings from her.

Charles Hatfield died January 12, 1958, and took his chemical formula with him to his grave in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

Hatfield claimed at least 500 successes. According to later commentators and those who encountered him, Hatfield&#x27;s successes were mainly due to his meteorological skill, detailed study of rainfall statistics and innate sense of timing, selecting periods where there was a high probability of rain anyway. John L. Bacon, a mayor of San Diego who studied Hatfield&#x27;s so-called successes, regarded him as nothing more than &quot;a darned good weather prophet.&quot;

== References in popular culture ==
Charles Hatfield and the 1916 flooding at Lake Morena is the subject of the song &quot;Hatfield&quot; by the band Widespread Panic. Singer/guitarist John Bell wrote the song after reading the story of the rainmaker in a &quot;Farmers&#x27; Almanac&quot;. The song was released on the album &quot;Everyday&quot; in 1993.

Charles Hatfield and the San Diego flood is credited as the inspiration for the instrumental musical piece &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; from the album &quot;Innovators&quot; released in 1993 by Sam Cordon and Kurt Bestor. 

Hatfield&#x27;s story inspired the 1956 Burt Lancaster film &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, based on the play of the same name. Hollywood invited Hatfield to the premiere. The play also became the basis of a Broadway Musical, &quot;110 in the Shade&quot;.

In T. Jefferson Parker&#x27;s 2007 novel &quot;Storm Runners&quot;, Charles Hatfield&#x27;s fictional great-great-granddaughter takes up his research. 

Charles Hatfield and the San Diego flood was featured in a 2016 episode of the &quot;White Rabbit Project&quot; on Netflix.

Charles Hatfield and his rainmaking endeavors are mentioned in Chapter One of Mark Arax&#x27;s 2019 book, &quot;The Dreamt Land.&quot;

Charles Hatfield and the San Diego flood is the subject of The Wizard of Sun City: The Strange, True Story of Charles Hatfield, The Rainmaker Who Drowned a City&#x27;s Dreams by Garry Jenkins.

<text>Alan Irwin Abel (August 2, 1924 – September 14, 2018) was an American hoaxer, writer, and mockumentary filmmaker famous for several hoaxes that became media circuses.

== Education and early career ==
Abel was born to a Jewish family in Zanesville, Ohio, on August 2, 1924, and grew up in nearby Coshocton, Ohio. He graduated from the Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Science in education. One of Abel&#x27;s earliest pranks took place in the late 1950s; he posed as a golf professional who taught Westinghouse executives how to use ballet positions to improve their games.

Beginning May 27, 1959, with a story on the &quot;Today Show&quot;, the Society for Indecency to Naked Animals (SINA), was Abel&#x27;s most elaborate hoax. SINA&#x27;s mission was to clothe naked animals throughout the world. They are best known today for their tagline: &quot;A nude horse is a rude horse&quot;. As a spokesman for the group, Buck Henry appeared as &quot;G. Clifford Prout&quot; on television and radio several times, including the&quot; CBS Evening News&quot; on August 21, 1962. Abel himself appeared on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; to discuss the SINA mission. The hoax began as a satire of media censorship, but took on a life of its own with sympathizers offering unsolicited contributions (always returned), citizen summonses for walking naked dogs, and sewing patterns for pet clothes. He orchestrated protests, such as picketing the White House in 1963 to demand Jackie Kennedy&#x27;s horses wear pants.

He invented a fictional housewife named Yetta Bronstein who ran as a write-in candidate for president of the United States in both 1964 and 1968. A member of &quot;The Best Party&quot;, Bronstein ran with the slogan &quot;Vote for Yetta and things will get betta&quot; and a platform which included National Bingo and a suggestion box in front of the White House. Alan Abel and his wife Jeanne both performed as Bronstein for phone interviews, and a photo of his mother was used as the face on campaign posters.

From 1966 to 1967, Abel wrote a weekly syndicated humor column &quot;The Private World of Prof. Bunker C. Hill&quot; that appeared in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and several other newspapers.

==1970s–1980s ==
Following the Watergate scandal, Abel hired an actor to pose as Deep Throat for a press conference in New York City before 150 reporters. Literary agent Scott Meredith offered $100,000 to buy the rights to his story. At the news conference, the Deep Throat impostor quarreled with his purported wife, then fainted and was whisked away in a waiting ambulance.

In the early 1970s, Abel appeared on the game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; with his head wrapped in bandages. This was not so that he would not be recognized, but so the panel would not identify his two imposters: well-known actors Larry Blyden and Tom Poston.

Abel wrote, produced, and directed two mockumentaries: &quot;Is There Sex After Death?&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Faking of the President&quot; (1976).

Amid the economic recession of the 1970s, he announced Omar&#x27;s School for Beggars to train professional panhandlers. As Omar, Abel was invited to numerous television talk shows, including the &quot;Tomorrow Show&quot; hosted by Tom Snyder and the shows of Morton Downey Jr., Sally Jessy Raphael, Mike Douglas, and Sonya Friedman, who was especially upset because Omar ate his lunch on camera. The hoax was a satirical commentary on the rise of unemployment and homelessness in the U.S. Omar&#x27;s TV appearances spanned from 1975 to 1988, though he had been exposed several times.

In 1980, Abel staged his own death from a heart attack near the Sundance Ski Lodge. A fake funeral director collected his belongings, and a woman posing as his widow notified &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The paper published an obituary on January 2, 1980, asserting he had died the day before. On January 3, Abel held a news conference to announce, &quot;[the] reports of my demise have been grossly exaggerated&quot;, a reference to the similar statement by Mark Twain. It was the first retracted obituary in &quot;New York Times&quot; history.

=== Mass fainting hoax ===

On January 21, 1985, on the first program that &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot; aired live and in New York, seven members of the audience appeared to faint. Donahue, worried the studio was overheated or that the setting was inducing excessive anxiety, cleared the studio and resumed the show without an audience. The fainting &quot;spell&quot; was orchestrated by Abel, who later said that Phil Donahue enjoyed high ratings after the incident and sent Abel a Christmas card with the message, &quot;Hope nothing causes you to feel faint in the next year.&quot;

== Parodies ==
In 1993, when euthanasia and Jack Kevorkian were common topics in the news, Abel set up the bogus Florida company &quot;Euthanasia Cruises, Ltd.&quot;, which would offer cruises allowing terminally ill participants to jump into the ocean after three days of partying. He revived this hoax in a column in 2006.

In 1997, Abel launched CGS Productions to promote gift-wrapped pint jars of Jenny McCarthy&#x27;s urine. (A parody of McCarthy&#x27;s role in a shoe commercial where she appeared sitting on a toilet.) The name of the communications director for CGS Productions was Stoidi Puekaw – &quot;wake up idiots&quot; backwards. 
Abel once ran for Congress on a platform that included paying congressmen based on commission; selling ambassadorships to the highest bidder; installing a lie detector in the White House and truth serum in the Senate drinking fountain; requiring all doctors to publish their medical-school grade point average in the telephone book after their names; and removing Wednesday to establish a four-day workweek.

== Later years ==
In 1994 he appeared on &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; to tell a fabricated story about his wife gluing his penis to his butt while he was asleep. 

In 1999, Abel appeared in the documentary &quot;Private Dicks: Men Exposed&quot;, in which he claimed to be the current holder of the Guinness World Record for the smallest penis. Abel, who initially appeared in the video as &quot;Bruce the musician&quot; (later versions of the documentary changed this to reflect that Abel was a prankster), did not disrobe for the documentary crew, and said that he would only do so if they were to have group sex afterwards. Abel stated, &quot;They said no. So I didn&#x27;t have to take off my shorts.&quot; 

At the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Abel introduced a Citizens Against Breastfeeding campaign to ban all breastfeeding because &quot;it is an incestuous relationship between mother and baby that manifests an oral addiction leading youngsters to smoke, drink, and even becoming antisocial.&quot; He said in an interview that he attracted supporters, including one woman from Santa Barbara mailed him a $40,000 check, which he returned. After 200 interviews over two years, Abel confessed the hoax in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

In 2006, an &quot;Esquire&quot; profile by Joshua Foer described a &quot;fat tax&quot; campaign spearheaded by Abel (under the name Irwin Leba). He proposed heavy taxes on the obese in order to balance the federal budget, and was described in &quot;Esquire&quot; as a reclusive and surprisingly heavy Texas multi-millionaire who earned his wealth by working his way up the New York City hot dog stand ladder, moving to Texas, and investing his savings into McDonald&#x27;s stock. In the interview, Abel devoured French fries and extolled deep-fried Twinkies. 

Abel died on September 14, 2018, at his home in Southbury, Connecticut, from complications of cancer and heart failure; he was 94. Owing to Abel&#x27;s previous death hoax, &quot;The New York Times&quot; sought independent confirmation of his death from his family, a hospice organization, and a local funeral home before publishing an obituary.

==Documentary==
In 2004, his daughter Jenny Abel, along with Jeff Hockett, made a documentary film of Abel&#x27;s life called &quot;Abel Raises Cain&quot;, which played at the Boston Independent Film Festival and the 2005 Slamdance Film Festival, where it won first prize for Best Documentary. It has been released on DVD.

Alves Reis was a child of a humble family; his father was a financially troubled undertaker who ended up being declared insolvent. Reis wanted to study engineering. He started his degree but quit in the first year to marry Maria Luísa Jacobetti de Azevedo, sister of Octávio Jacobetti de Azevedo and daughter of de Azevedo and Beatriz, in August 1916. In 1916, he decided to emigrate to Portuguese Angola, at the time a Portuguese colony, to try to make a fortune and escape the humiliations from his wife&#x27;s family, due to their differences in social status. Before departing to Angola, Reis forged himself a diploma from Oxford University&#x27;s &quot;Polytechnic School of Engineering&quot;, a department that did not exist. He supposedly studied engineering sciences, geology, geometry, physics, metallurgy, pure mathematics, paleography, electric and mechanical engineering and applied mechanics. He started as a public employee in the public sewers constructions and repairs.

== The Ambaca affair ==
In 1922, Ambaca, a railway company operating in Angola, was in financial crisis. Debt and shareholders were uneasy and the company&#x27;s shares had fallen to a few escudos each. Alves realized that the Portuguese government had lent the company&#x27;s treasury $100,000 in an attempt to bail it out. He quickly forged checks from his bank account in New York and bought the company with them. While the checks were travelling by sea (a voyage that took weeks) he transferred the money in the company&#x27;s treasury to his bank account and thus the checks were cleared even though he did not have sufficient liquidity at the beginning. He used the remaining money in an attempt to take over the Angola Mining Company, though he was found out before he could take total control of the company and was arrested in July 1924 in Porto for embezzling the Ambaca money. He was arrested for 54 days and was released on 27 August 1924 because of a technicality; he blamed a criminal conspiracy for his arrest.

== Banco de Portugal plot ==

During his time in jail, Reis conceived of what became known as the &quot;Portugal Bank Note Affair&quot;. It consisted of forging a contract in the name of Banco de Portugal (Bank of Portugal)—the central bank, responsible for issuing banknotes and partly private at the time—authorizing him to print banknotes in return for an alleged loan from a consortium to develop Angola. His plan was to use the contract to convince a legitimate banknote printing contractor to make the notes, thereby obtaining notes that would be indistinguishable from those legitimately authorized by the bank.

In 1924, Reis reached out to business contacts of his to assist him in his &quot;confidential mission&quot; for the Governors of the Bank of Portugal. Reis wrote up the fraudulent contract and had it officially notarized by an assistant notary who was too casual and trusting to read it. Taking advantage of a similarly lazy approach among diplomatic staffs, he acquired three certifications for the notarization in the embassies of Britain, Germany (Weimar Republic) and France (French Third Republic). Then he rewrote the contract with a French translation, forged the signatures of Bank of Portugal officials (he traced them from the currency in his pocket) and affixed the notarizations, and two new bills as samples, to the contract.

The key to Reis&#x27;s plan was that only he knew that the contract was forged; trading on the period&#x27;s widespread cynicism about the monetary policies of governments and on Portugal&#x27;s reputation for corruption and self-dealing, he convinced the others who assisted in his operation that what they were doing had the clandestine support of the Bank. Reis&#x27; key associates, Dutch trader Karel Marang van IJsselveere, German trader Adolph Hennies, and José Bandeira (brother of António Bandeira, the Portuguese Ambassador to the Netherlands) later claimed to have believed the project was legitimate throughout. Reis had been lucky or fortunate in his selection of associates; although currently legitimate, each man had checkered pasts and had no objections to engaging in an enterprise that was technically legal even if shady, especially if it involved such major insiders. Reis alone knew unquestionably that there were no insiders and his various documents were worthless, though prosecutors and journalists later suggested that the continuing credulity of his associates as the scheme progressed strained belief.

On the pretext that the supposed loan and issuance would be politically unpopular, and with the implication that it was a bit of sharp practice by bank insiders, the entire operation was conducted in an atmosphere of deep secrecy. It was vital, Reis emphasized to his contractors from Lisbon, that the matter be kept quite confidential to avoid embarrassing their prominent silent partners and risking the whole deal being scotched in the face of political opposition.

Karel Marang approached Joh. Enschedé, an old and respected Dutch printing firm for the job. Reviewing the attached sample notes, they said they were the work of Waterlow and Sons Limited of London, a British printer almost as old and eminent. Since the contract insisted that the new notes be identical to the existing issue, the Dutch firm suggested that Marang take the job to Waterlow since they already had the plates and it was almost impossible to reproduce plates exactly. On 4 December 1924, Marang approached Sir William Waterlow with a letter of introduction from the Joh. Enschedé company. Marang explained that for political reasons the contract required utmost discretion and promised that Waterlow would shortly receive appropriate documentation from Lisbon.

When Waterlow received letters that authorized the printing—more of Reis&#x27;s forgeries—, he accepted the contract. Reis had managed to work out the sequence of bank governor names and serial numbers used by the Portuguese central bank, but had neglected to eliminate numbers already ordered. When Waterlow realized that the bills had the same numbers as some they had previously printed, they alerted the &quot;bank&quot; (actually Reis). He also wrote a letter to the governor of the Bank of Portugal, Inocêncio Camacho Rodrigues, in which he talked about the contracts with Marang, but the letter was lost in the mail. Since the contract had specified that the word &quot;Angola&quot; would be overprinted on the new notes when they reached Lisbon and before transport to Angola (they were allegedly for colonial circulation only), it was not difficult for Reis to convince the London firm that the reuse of existing serial numbers was not a cause for alarm.

===Result and impact===

Waterlow and Sons Limited printed 200,000 banknotes of 500 Portuguese escudos with an image of Vasco da Gama, with the date of 17 November 1922, to a total face value of 100 million escudos (which was equivalent to 0.88% of Portugal&#x27;s nominal GDP at the time). There were almost as many false 500 escudos banknotes as real ones. The first delivery was made in February 1925, one year after the real 500 escudo banknotes with the image of Vasco da Gama began to circulate. The notes were transported from England to Portugal with the help of Reis&#x27;s accomplices, José Bandeira, who would use the diplomatic advantages of his brother, and Karel Marang, who held a diplomatic passport issued by Liberia. Reis then proceeded to launder the bills into gold-backed foreign currencies and smaller denominations of Portuguese currency.

Reis himself received 25% of the proceeds of his scheme, which made him very wealthy. Maintaining always the internal fiction that they were acting for the government, he reminded his partners of their moral obligations to Angola. Together they created the &quot;Bank of Angola &amp; Metropole&quot; in June 1925, with Bandeira at the helm, both to aid in circulation of their bills and to invest in projects in both Portugal and Angola. By illegally increasing the monetary base and investing heavily in currency, land, building, and businesses, he and Bandeira created a boom in the Portuguese economy. Reis bought the &quot;Palace of the Golden Boy&quot; (Palácio do Menino de Ouro, nowadays the building of the British Council in Lisbon), three farms, a taxi fleet, and spent an enormous quantity of money on jewellery and expensive clothing for his wife. José Bandeira bought retail shops and invested in all manner of enterprise; he also sought, unsuccessfully, to purchase the newspaper Diário de Notícias. In the fall of 1925 Reis and Hennies made a tour of Angola, buying properties, investing in corporations, and making development plans. He was hailed there as a savior and as &quot;Portugal&#x27;s own Cecil Rhodes&quot;.

The final phase of Reis&#x27; scheme was to buy controlling interest in the Bank of Portugal, a step which would allow him to retroactively make his fiction about Bank approval true. With control of the bank, the entire counterfeiting could be swept under the rug, ensuring that there would never be any evidence of the fraud. During the summer and fall of 1925, while he and Hennies toured Angola, he had Bandeira and his own assistant Francisco Ferreira, Jr. ferreting out the ownership of the Bank shares (it was secret) and buying them under the complicated rules that the Bank&#x27;s charter allowed. Eventually they controlled 10,000 of the 45,000 shares needed for controlling interest in the bank, but publicity led Bandeira to ease off the purchases even as he sent Reis ever more inflated false reports of the number of shares they had acquired.

=== Discovery and arrest ===
Throughout 1925 rumours of fake banknotes arose, but they could not be detected: the notes Reis had released were not counterfeit as such, but real—although unauthorized—Bank of Portugal bills.

Although the issuing of unauthorised banknotes went undetected, the attempts by Reis and his partners to make good their fictitious obligations to Angola attracted attention for other reasons. The Portuguese had long suspected the German government of coveting their Angola colony. The prominent role of Hennies in the bank and Reis&#x27; triumphal return to Angola caused suspicion because of Hennies&#x27;s well-established relationship with Germany&#x27;s espionage apparatus during World War I. The acquisition of large tracts of plantation land by Angola and Metropole alarmed Alfredo de Silva, who controlled Portugal&#x27;s market in vegetable oils. De Silva&#x27;s friend and business associate Pereira da Rosa (who himself sat on the boards of banks that had been losing business to the Angola &amp; Metropole) owned &quot;O Século&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;The Century&quot;), the most important daily newspaper at the time and one that was concerned at the prospect of a deep-pocketed owner for the competing &quot;Diário de Notícias&quot;. The newspaper assigned its top reporters to dig into the bank and Reis, beginning a campaign of aspersion and innuendo.

Journalists asked how it was possible that Reis&#x27;s bank, Banco de Angola e Metrópole, gave loans with low interest rates without the need of receiving deposits. It was implied that the bank was a German front aimed at infiltrating the country and gaining control of the Angolan colony. The campaign, filled with insinuation and calls for investigation, made public the fact that the Inspector of Banking Commerce had opened an investigation shortly before the newspaper&#x27;s crusade began. The inspector&#x27;s inquiry was into the attempts by people associated with the Angola &amp; Metropole to buy up shares of the Bank of Portugal. The revelation of the effort added fuel to the dark suspicions that then hung around the Angola &amp; Metropole and its backers.

On 4 December 1925, a teller for a money-changer in Porto who had been following all the allegations and revelations in the press suddenly had a flash of insight and became convinced that the Angola &amp; Metropole must be counterfeiting. The teller had an advantage on other observers; his employer was one of Reis&#x27; half-unwitting launderers. The Angola &amp; Metropole illegally bought foreign exchange from him at a premium (money exchange was illegal in Portugal at the time, but in fact widespread and tolerated). The ledgers of these transactions were then torn out and destroyed. Although neither the teller nor the officials at the Porto branch of the Bank of Portugal could find any evidence that the bills from the Angola &amp; Metropole were counterfeit, the circumstances were suspicious enough that the allegation was reported to Lisbon.

&quot;O Século&quot; publicly revealed the fraud on 5 December 1925. The day before, the Bank of Portugal had sent the inspector João Teixeira Direito, to Porto, to investigate the huge deposits by the Banco de Angola e Metrópole in banknotes of 500 escudos at the cambist firm Pinto da Cunha. After exhaustive and frustrating investigation, they finally noticed, by chance, banknotes with duplicate serial numbers. Authorities ordered all bank agencies to store their notes by order of serial number to detect duplicates; many more were found. The Bank of Portugal contacted Waterlow and Sons, and Reis&#x27;s scheme fell apart.
On 6 December, Reis&#x27;s bank&#x27;s wealth was confiscated and arrest warrants were issued for him and most of his associates. Reis and Hennies were on board the &quot;Adolph Woerman&quot; en route to Portugal from Angola and were tipped off that they were to be arrested when they made harbour. Hennies slipped away and managed to elude capture; he changed his identity and was able to keep most of his share. Despite Hennies&#x27;s pleading, Reis refused to run and insisted on returning to Lisbon to defend himself. He was arrested a few days later. He was 28 years old.

In the following trial, Reis&#x27;s forged documents, and widespread cynicism about the nation&#x27;s elites, were convincing enough for judges to suspect that Bank of Portugal officials and others in the government and establishment might really be involved. This delayed the sentence for five years, but Reis was finally tried in May 1930. He was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. In prison, Reis converted to Protestantism and converted other prisoners. He was released in May 1945, and was offered, but refused, a job as a bank employee. Reis died of a heart attack in 1955.

=== Fate of principal accomplices ===
Bandeira received a sentence of 15 years, served it, and upon release, briefly went into the nightclub business. He died in late March 1960 in Lisbon, a well-liked man of modest means.

Marang was tried in the Netherlands and sentenced to 11 months. He left the country rather than serve prison time. He later purchased a small electrical manufacturer in France, eventually becoming a respected manufacturer, family man, and French citizen. He turned over management of the prosperous firm to his sons and died at his vacation home in Cannes on February 13, 1960.

Hennies fled to Germany and reappeared later under his real name, Hans Döring. He lived high for some time but eventually lost much of his wealth on poor investments. Turning over all his assets to a trusted friend, he later found it impossible to reclaim them and lived in near poverty. On August 29, 1936, he died in disputed circumstances while in a Berlin hospital.

=== Repercussions ===
Reis&#x27;s fraud had enormous repercussions on the economy and politics of Portugal. By the end of 1925, Reis had managed to introduce escudo banknotes worth £1,007,963 (at 1925 exchange rates: £ in modern pounds) into the Portuguese economy. The exchange rate of the Portuguese escudo fell and it lost much of its credibility. After the scheme was found out, the Bank of Portugal ordered the withdrawal of all 500 escudo banknotes within 20 days; by 26 December 115,000 counterfeit notes were withdrawn.

When Reis&#x27;s fraud became public knowledge in December 1925 it brought about a crisis of confidence in the Portuguese government. Although events of this period are still little understood, this crisis had a strong effect on the nationalist military 28th May 1926 coup d&#x27;état against the Portuguese First Republic government and President Bernardino Machado that brought the &quot;Ditadura Nacional&quot; (National Dictatorship) to power, heralding the Estado Novo dictatorship from 1926 to 1974, with António de Oliveira Salazar ruling from 1932 to 1968.

Banco de Portugal sued Waterlow &amp; Sons in the High Court in London. In one of the most complex trials in English legal history, the case was finally settled in the House of Lords on 28 April 1932 in favour of the Banco de Portugal, which was awarded £610,392 in damages.

Waterlow &amp; Sons&#x27; business never completely recovered; it was finally acquired by De La Rue in 1961. Sir William Waterlow had been dismissed as president of the printing house and was elected Lord Mayor of London in 1929. He died of peritonitis on 6 July 1931 before the final judgment of the House of Lords.

==In popular culture==

The fraud was the subject of the 1974 Italian TV miniseries &quot;Accadde a Lisbona&quot; (&quot;It happened in Lisbon&quot;); Reis was played by Paolo Stoppa.

It was also the subject of the 1991 episode &quot;Duplikát&quot; of the Czechoslovak-West German TV series &quot;Dobrodružství kriminalistiky&quot; (&quot;Adventures in Criminology&quot;). Reis was portrayed by Jan Teplý.

In 2000, Alves dos Reis&#x27; life was depicted in a 50-episode Portuguese television series written by former Polícia Judiciária investigator Francisco Moita Flores, with the full title &quot;Alves Reis, Um Seu Criado&quot; (&quot;Alves Reis, Your Servant&quot;) and broadcast by RTP1.

<text>The Thunderbolts are an antihero/supervillain/superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team consists mostly of reformed supervillains. Created by Kurt Busiek and Mark Bagley, the team first appeared in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #449 (January 1997).

==Publication history==
The Thunderbolts were first presented, both to readers and to the Marvel Universe, in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #449 (January 1997), written by Peter David with art by Mike Deodato Jr., as a group of super-powered figures who became heroes to help protect the world when the Avengers were declared dead after the events of the 1996 &quot;Onslaught&quot; crossover. The final page of &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; #1 (April 1997), however, written by Kurt Busiek with art by Mark Bagley, revealed that the Thunderbolts were actually the Masters of Evil in disguise, a surprise twist carefully guarded by Marvel Comics.

In subsequent storylines, the group rejects their leader Baron Helmut Zemo and attempts to become heroes in their own right, eventually under the leadership of the Avenger Hawkeye.

Despite critical acclaim, the book was reformatted with &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; #76 (March 2003), removing the entire cast and creative team and replacing it with a brand new set of characters, along with a new writer, John Arcudi.

The Thunderbolts also feature in the Spider-Man storyline &quot;New Ways to Die&quot;, which is the first proper showdown between him and the team.

The Heroic Age team debuted in &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; #144.

The &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; comic book was renamed &quot;Dark Avengers&quot; beginning with issue #175. Dark Avengers ended with issue #190.

As part of Marvel NOW!, a new Thunderbolts series was launched featuring a new team composed of Red Hulk, Deadpool, Elektra, Venom, and Punisher. This series ended in October 2014 with issue #32.

In July 2023, a new &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; series was announced and the team&#x27;s new lineup will be led by the Winter Soldier and Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine and will consist of espionage themed superheroes, including Black Widow, Sharon Carter, White Widow, Red Guardian, and U.S. Agent.

==Fictional team biography==
===Baron Helmut Zemo&#x27;s Thunderbolts===

Baron Helmut Zemo summoned several of his former allies from the prior incarnations of the Masters of Evil during a rescue attempt of Goliath (the former bodyguard to Baron Heinrich Zemo). The summoned members included Beetle, Fixer, Moonstone and Screaming Mimi. Zemo took the accidental gathering as an omen, and decided to reform the Masters of Evil and attack the Avengers. Before they could strike, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four were apparently killed by the villain Onslaught.

The death of the Avengers and Fantastic Four created an opportunity for Zemo and the Masters of Evil. Zemo realized that the world needed superpowered champions, and that his team could fill that need. By posing as superheroes, the Masters of Evil could gain the public trust and build a position of power that rivaled the status of the Avengers. Once they had gained the public&#x27;s faith, Zemo believed they could gain access to all the secrets of the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D. once they were in ultimate power. Zemo then planned to sell the secrets they found to the criminal underworld.

The villains adopted new heroic costumes and codenames. Baron Zemo became the patriotic American Citizen V, patterned after a WWII hero his father killed. Former Human Torch and Spider-Man foe Beetle became MACH-1, using a new high-tech suit designed by Fixer. Fixer became the gadget-wielding Techno. Long time Avengers enemy Goliath became the powerhouse Atlas. Screaming Mimi became Songbird, her damaged abilities aided by technology Zemo had adapted from ex-Master Klaw. Moonstone was secretly freed from the Vault and added to the team by Zemo, who extracted a promise of loyalty from her. She was to be Zemo&#x27;s personal enforcer against any betrayal committed by the others. She took the alias Meteorite. Calling themselves the Thunderbolts, the six new &#x27;heroes&#x27; were ready for action.

The team found tremendous success as superheroic champions. The public began to think of the Thunderbolts as heroes. After several adventures, some of the villains began to think of themselves the same way. Dallas Riordan, an aide to the Mayor of New York, befriended the new heroes.

Jolt, an Asian American teenage girl whose entire family was killed by Onslaught and was experimented on by Arnim Zola, soon joined the team after she came to the Baxter Building seeking the help of the FF. Jolt, however, was not a supervillain, with the young girl honestly believing that her new friends were heroes (Zemo used the opportunity to create the team&#x27;s new history). Soon after the addition of Jolt, Techno&#x27;s neck was broken in battle with the Elements of Doom. Techno then seemingly transferred his mind into an android body built from his tech-pack.

Just as Zemo&#x27;s plans were about to come to fruition, everything unravelled. To the astonishment of the entire world, the Fantastic Four and the Avengers returned. Faced with the return of the lost heroes, Zemo revealed the true nature of the Thunderbolts to the world. Ostensibly, he did this to ensure the loyalty of the team by ruining their chances of becoming heroes.

The Thunderbolts (minus the android Techno) turned on Zemo for his betrayal. In the ensuing battle, Zemo and Techno used a mind control device to turn the Avengers and Fantastic Four against the remaining Thunderbolts, who, with the help of the size-changing Atlas- as well as Iron Man who had designed his armour to make himself more resistant to mind control- ultimately rallied and freed the other heroes. Together, they defeated Zemo and Techno. Unbeknownst to his teammates, Atlas helped the wounded Zemo escape, while Techno fled under his own power.

Amidst this chaos, Meteorite decided to return to her old identity. She altered her costume and changed her codename back to Moonstone. After a brief stop-over in an alternate dimension, the team learned that Moonstone had no intention of reforming and becoming a superhero. She told them she only turned against Zemo out of self-preservation.

Upon their return to Earth, the team set up shop in Colorado and pondered their next move.

====Marvel&#x27;s Most Wanted====
Now fugitives, new members soon joined the Thunderbolts. These members included the former Avenger Hawkeye, and later a young African American hero named Charcoal who had previously fought the team, having been created by a &quot;Create a character&quot; contest in &quot;Wizard Magazine&quot;. Hawkeye convinced his new teammates they would be pardoned if MACH-1, who had murdered someone as the Beetle (as the only member of the team who had ever actually &quot;killed&quot; anyone), turned himself in to authorities. The team considered joining the mysterious Crimson Cowl&#x27;s new Masters of Evil instead. Ultimately, the Thunderbolts followed Hawkeye&#x27;s advice. MACH-1 turned himself in and pleaded guilty to murder. Even with MACH-1&#x27;s surrender, the U.S. Government refused to pardon the group.

The Thunderbolts then defeated the Crimson Cowl&#x27;s Masters of Evil and took over their headquarters. After unmasking the Crimson Cowl, the team discovered that she was Riordan. In truth, Riordan was not the Crimson Cowl. The real Crimson Cowl, Justine Hammer, had framed Riordan to take the fall for her crimes. Riordan actually did have her own secret identity as the new Citizen V, leader of the secret V-Battalion. Riordan decided to keep her secret to avoid exposure of the group. She was sent to jail for the Crimson Cowl&#x27;s crimes, but was later rescued by the V-Battalion.

====Changes====
While exploring their new headquarters, the Thunderbolts discovered Ogre. Ogre was a former member of the villainous Factor Three, the original owners of the base. Factor Three made Ogre the new base caretaker after they disbanded. This also left him with custody of Humus Sapien, a dangerous mutant teenager that Factor Three had kidnapped and placed in suspended animation.

Ogre was accepted as a member of the Thunderbolts. Soon after, Techno attacked him, placed him in stasis, and assumed his identity. At the same time, MACH-1 was freed from prison in exchange for stealing some top secret weapons technology from evil industrialist Justin Hammer. MACH-1 returned to the Thunderbolts after gaining his freedom thanks to Hawkeye making a deal with the Commission that had released him that he would continue officially serving his sentence while returning to the team. Upon his return, Techno upgraded MACH-1&#x27;s armor, and used another device to change his features so that others wouldn&#x27;t realize he was the same person as the original identity. MACH-1 was now MACH-2.

During this time, the Thunderbolts joined forces with the Avengers against the latest plan of Count Nefaria, as he intended to detonate an ionic bomb, which would transform millions of people into an ionic state which he could then control, perceiving this to be the best way to guarantee that he received the respect that he felt he deserved. The two teams were drawn into this plan when Nefaria used his new control of ionic energy to take control of the heroes Wonder Man and Atlas, intending to use them to kill the Avengers. Despite his power, he was stopped by the combined efforts of the Avengers, the Thunderbolts, and Madame Masque. Mademe Masque used a weapon she had developed to disrupt Nefaria&#x27;s own ionic energy so that the heroes could defeat him.

Meanwhile, Moonstone found herself going through changes. She fell in love with Hawkeye. Soon after, she learned that the spirit of the Kree Moonstone that powered her tried to make her a more honest person. This conflicted with her naturally amoral personality, and slowly made her insane.

The Thunderbolts faced many more challenges. Henry Gyrich sought to destroy the team and Hawkeye. Gyrich changed a brainwashed Jack Monroe into the new Scourge. The Scourge then attempted to assassinate the Thunderbolts one by one. First he killed Jolt. He then traveled to South America and apparently killed Baron Zemo. After this, Scourge broke into the Thunderbolts headquarters and destroyed the robotic Techno. He then killed Atlas by allowing the giant to implode into a storm of ionic energy.

====The Redeemers====
All four characters apparently killed by Scourge had survived in some form: the robotic Techno had recovered Jolt&#x27;s body and used her electrical powers to resurrect her from the dead, even while he &quot;died&quot;, imbuing her with the knowledge that Hawkeye had failed to get the team pardoned in the process. The Thunderbolts were upset with Hawkeye, but, on unmasking Monroe, decided that confronting Gyrich was more important.

While all this happened, Val Cooper had gathered her own army of heroes she named the Redeemers. This team included a new Citizen V, Atlas&#x27; brother Smuggler, and Fixer, who had only copied his mind into his tech-pack as a contingency. The original Norbert P. Ebersol survived his injuries and recovered in secret while the robotic Techno continued on as a Thunderbolt in his place. Leila Davis, the wife of the Ringer, used an updated version of the Beetle armour.

The Redeemers helped the Thunderbolts battle Gyrich, who had acquired experimental nanite technology. Gyrich wanted to use the nanites to kill off all heroes and villains on Earth. Gyrich&#x27;s scheme was foiled. It was soon revealed that he had been infected with nanites, and had been secretly manipulated by Baron Strucker of the terrorist group HYDRA. Hawkeye tried to use this information as blackmail to get the Thunderbolts pardoned. Gyrich countered that he would tell the public himself about HYDRA&#x27;s scheme. Ultimately, Gyrich agreed to stay quiet and give the Thunderbolts their pardon. In return, Hawkeye turned himself in for aiding the fugitive heroes. Hawkeye went to prison and the team disbanded.

Eventually, all the others murdered by Jack Monroe returned from the dead. Baron Zemo&#x27;s mind had been transferred into the comatose body of the man whose role as Citizen V he had usurped in the first place.

Later, after a teleportation accident, Zemo&#x27;s mind was transferred into Techno&#x27;s mechanical &quot;Tech-Pack&quot;, which had also cybernetically replaced the broken segment of Techno&#x27;s real body&#x27;s spine. Atlas was later raised from the dead after a merger with Riordan, who had been crippled in battle with the Crimson Cowl.

Jolt and Charcoal, the only Thunderbolts without criminal records, were assimilated into the Redeemers under the leadership of Captain America and the Zemo-possessed Citizen V. The Redeemers were promptly slaughtered by the Thunderbolts&#x27; deadliest foe, the powerful supervillain Graviton with Citizen V, Fixer (who ran away), and Jolt (who re-formed her electric form) as the only survivors of the massacre, although Smuggler and Screamer have since resurfaced.

====Rebirth and endings====
The Thunderbolts reformed to defeat Graviton. During the fight, several of the team members present (Fixer, Jolt, Moonstone, Jenkins as MACH-3 and the merged Atlas/Dallas Riordan, along with Zemo&#x27;s mind — accidentally transferred into Fixer&#x27;s tech-pack by the teleportation) were transported to Counter-Earth, the same parallel Earth the Avengers and Fantastic Four were sent to after their final battle with Onslaught. The Thunderbolts met Counter-Earth versions of Heinrich Zemo, Helmut Zemo and the first Moonstone, the last of which was known as Phantom Eagle.

Under duress — Zemo being able to disable his ability to walk at will — Fixer transferred Zemo&#x27;s mind from &quot;Tech-Pack&quot; into the body of Zemo&#x27;s counterpart. Zemo then killed the Counter-Earth version of his father. Soon after, the Thunderbolts stopped the Nazi Germany of Counter-Earth from taking control of all of Counter-Earth&#x27;s computers. Zemo convinced the team to remain and help rebuild Counter-Earth. The team reluctantly agreed and based themselves in the mobile Counter-Earth Attilan. Then, Moonstone stole the mentally unstable Phantom Eagle&#x27;s moonstone for herself, boosting her powers to godlike levels.

Back on Earth-616, many things happened. Hawkeye escaped from prison alongside several supervillains just as S.H.I.E.L.D. contacted him with an offer to be freed from prison. Justin died so Justine (the Crimson Cowl) discovered her father had exposed every supervillain he ever employed to a poison that enslaved their minds. This included members of the Crimson Cowl&#x27;s Masters of Evil. However, the villain Plantman had helped create the poison and was the only one who could activate it.

With the telepathic terrorist Mentallo serving as a middleman, Hawkeye tried to help Plantman in order to give him to the Crimson Cowl. During the escape, Hawkeye watched helplessly as Plantman murdered a prison guard. Before the Crimson Cowl could kill Hawkeye or take Plantman, they were rescued by Songbird.

Hawkeye and Songbird then formed a second group of Thunderbolts. He explained to the Crimson Cowl&#x27;s Masters of Evil that if the Crimson Cowl was not stopped, they would all become her slaves. Plantman, using the codename Blackheath, was their first new member. Most of the members of the Crimson Cowl&#x27;s Masters of Evil also joined, including: Cardinal (now Harrier); Gypsy Moth (now Skein); Man-Killer (now Amazon); and Cyclone, who did not change his codename.

These new Thunderbolts were eventually captured by the Crimson Cowl (who was helped by Cyclone). The Crimson Cowl vivisected Plantman. Soon after, Plantman mutated into a plant creature that neutralized the mind-control poison. The group was then sent to the V-Battalion&#x27;s base. The Counter-Earth group returned to Earth at the V-Battalion base through a rift in space. The new and old teammates were reunited. Jolt stayed on Counter-Earth and joined the Young Allies. Closing the rift between Earth and Counter-Earth destroyed the V-Battalion&#x27;s base.

In the aftermath, Atlas and Dallas were split into separate bodies, with Dallas retaining the remainder of Atlas&#x27; ionic power, allowing her to walk again with enhanced agility and strength. Zemo convinced Hawkeye that he wanted to reform and help the world instead of ruling it. Hawkeye, Amazon and Skein left the team. MACH-3 and Harrier returned to prison. Zemo then revealed to the team that he had lied to Hawkeye and that he still wanted to conquer the world, only to save it from itself. The &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; comic then shifted focus for six issues.

====Avengers/Thunderbolts: The Best Intentions====
In 2004, the six issue &quot;Avengers/Thunderbolts&quot; limited series was launched, picking up a year after the events of &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; #75. Zemo led the Thunderbolts (now including Dallas Riordan, under the codename Vantage) in an attempt to drain the powers of all superhumans on Earth, using Moonstone. They fought the Avengers, including former Thunderbolt Hawkeye. Iron Man infiltrated the Thunderbolts disguised as Cobalt Man. Eventually, all the power absorbed by Moonstone caused her to snap. Jolt returned from Counter-Earth to help stop Moonstone. Finally, Iron Man convinced Hawkeye to lobotomize Moonstone to save the planet.

Zemo vowed revenge against the Thunderbolts and the Avengers for putting Moonstone into a coma. Jolt returned to Counter-Earth. The depowered Blackheath returned to prison. The Fixer fled. Vantage retired to a government job. Songbird was offered reserve membership in the Avengers but turned it down. MACH-3 was paroled from prison and decided to form a new team of Thunderbolts.

===The New Thunderbolts===
Marvel subsequently launched &quot;New Thunderbolts&quot; #1. MACH-3 (now called MACH-IV), Atlas and Songbird were now a part of the new Thunderbolts. The team&#x27;s new recruits included Photon, Speed Demon, Joystick, Blizzard II and the Radioactive Man. The new team has battled Atlantean superhuman terrorist group the Fathom Five and Baron Strucker&#x27;s HYDRA organization, which funded the team&#x27;s return.

In &quot;Purple Reign&quot;, Swordsman, along with his master, the Purple Man, plotted to enslave New York City by drugging the water supply with the Purple Man&#x27;s pheromones, which allowed him to control his victims. While the Thunderbolts eventually defeated the Purple Man, before they could interrogate him he was teleported away by his boss, Baron Zemo, who tortured him by inducing rigor mortis in his body and sent him back to prison where his powers would be nullified.

Later, Hank Pym and Warbird offered to pardon the members of the Thunderbolts (who still had outstanding legal problems), if the Thunderbolts would attack and humiliate the New Avengers in public. However, it was later revealed that Pym and Warbird had been blackmailed into doing so.

Only Spider-Woman survived unscathed from the Thunderbolts&#x27; sneak attack, beating Joystick senseless. The rest of the team was beaten back before the Thunderbolts left. Songbird told Captain America that the Thunderbolts could beat the New Avengers senseless anytime they wished. In the end, it was revealed that Baron Zemo spearheaded the attack. He did this to humiliate Captain America but also to see how far the Thunderbolts would go for the chance at being pardoned.

Meanwhile, new threats were rising as Fixer resurfaced and recruited both MACH-IV and Blizzard to work with him on a top secret project, which was also run by Zemo. Meanwhile, Speed Demon was confronted by the new female Doctor Spectrum, who was out to reform the Squadron Sinister and take over the world. In the end, Speed Demon quit the Thunderbolts to join Dr. Spectrum while Nighthawk, the former Defender and member of the original Squadron Sinister, was offered membership on the Thunderbolts by Songbird.

====Right of Power====
Soon after Nighthawk joined the team, the Thunderbolts discovered that Photon&#x27;s awareness of all space and time brought with it a vision of the destruction of the universe at his hands. As they tried to come to terms with this, they were attacked by a Moonstone puppeteered by Zemo to kill Genis-Vell. When the initial strike failed, the remainder of Zemo&#x27;s team revealed themselves to the Thunderbolts. Zemo explained that he had used the Moonstones to accelerate Genis&#x27; return from death, and in the process made the mistake of siphoning energy from the beginning and end of time itself, caused by inexperience with his Moonstones, creating a link between Genis and the universe that threatened to end existence. Unable to find a way to save both Genis and the universe, he concluded that the only solution was Genis&#x27;s death.

Unwilling to accept this Songbird led the team in combat against Zemo&#x27;s group. To prevent the other Thunderbolts from intervening, Zemo revealed that Atlas&#x27; brother Smuggler had survived Graviton&#x27;s massacre of the Redeemers, trapped in the Darkforce dimension. Using the prospect of his release to make Atlas stop the other Thunderbolts from interfering, Zemo bested Genis in battle and, apologizing for both his mistake and the necessary solution, sliced Genis&#x27; body into pieces and scattered them through both time and the Darkforce dimension to prevent Genis returning from the dead a third time. He then fully released Smuggler. In the aftermath, Zemo—his face apparently fully healed from Moonstone&#x27;s attack—and Songbird became allies and lovers.

====Civil War: Hero Hunters====

The new Thunderbolts engaged and defeated Quicksand in a battle in Denver during the early days of the superhero Civil War. After this, they were summoned to Washington where they met with Iron Man, Mister Fantastic, and Yellowjacket. The three heroes, all supporting the Superhuman Registration Act, informed Zemo that they wanted the Thunderbolts to hunt down supervillains and recruit them to the Pro-Registration cause, which would be their chance at redemption. Unknown to Iron Man, the Thunderbolts had been doing this in secret for three weeks.

Zemo&#x27;s &quot;Thunderbolt Army&quot; grew rapidly, the team vastly expanding. It now included dozens of other supervillains, including most notably Doctor Octopus, the Wrecker, and Ox. The new team dispersed to battle super-villains, capture them and offer them a choice: join the Thunderbolts or go to prison. Of course, they all chose to join the Thunderbolts. Baron Zemo convinced Captain America not to stop him from battling the Grandmaster, while Nighthawk was revealed as being a spy for the Squadron Sinister inside Captain America&#x27;s Secret Avengers. Zemo then informed Songbird that in the coming battle, he knew that she would betray him, which she had been planning to do all along, in revenge for his killing of Photon, and he would sacrifice himself to save the world.

Zemo then saved the Wellspring of Power from the Grandmaster, who planned to use it for his own ends. Believing that all of his visions were subject to the flow of time, and that nothing was set in stone, Zemo defeated the Grandmaster, and boasted to his teammates that the power was now all his and theirs. He insisted that he would use it to help the world, despite the consequences for doing so. Songbird, who had temporarily lost her powers during the final battle, was told by Zemo, &quot;now is when your betrayal would have come.&quot; The vision of her betrayal turned out to be somewhat correct after all, though. Although she could not use her super-sound, Songbird used a simple opera note to crack the moonstones, sending Zemo into a whirlwind of cosmic time/space. In his final words before he was completely sucked into the vacuum, he screamed out that he would never have hurt a world he worked so hard to save.

Some of the Army of Thunderbolts, consisting of Venom, Lady Deathstrike, Taskmaster, Bullseye, Jester, Jack O&#x27;Lantern join Songbird assembled as the Pro-Registration side&#x27;s task force to hunt down Anti-Registration heroes at the end of &quot;Civil War&quot; #4, but never officially saw any real combat. The Jester and Jack O&#x27;Lantern were later killed by the Punisher. The two were sent to hunt down and capture Spider-Man when he attempted to leave Iron Man&#x27;s Pro-Registration army.

Bullseye, Taskmaster, and Lady Deathstrike were part of the final battle of Civil War fighting alongside the Pro-Registration side, with Taskmaster wounding Mr. Fantastic when he sought to kill Invisible Woman (a member of the Anti-Registration forces). At the end of the fight, Taskmaster, Bullseye, and Deathstrike were sent to the Negative Zone prison; but Bullseye escaped before he could be sent, and Taskmaster was freed by Deadpool en route to the portal. Deathstrike was either released or somehow escaped on her own. She would go on to battle the X-Men during the events of &quot;Messiah CompleX&quot;, a story arc in the X-Men related books.

After the events surrounding the Wellspring, the current team disbanded. MACH-IV and the Fixer were offered jobs from the Commission on Superhuman Activities. Blizzard was released from jail and left the team. Atlas was de-ionized after his encounter with the Wellspring but left catatonic and trapped in his enlarged state while Smuggler, his suit destroyed, took care of him. Joystick was imprisoned for her traitorous actions during the Wellspring debacle and Speed Demon ran away to avoid arrest. Only Songbird, Moonstone, Swordsman and the Radioactive Man, remained on the team.

====Zemo: Born Better====
In the events of &quot;Thunderbolts: Zemo - Born Better&quot; mini-series, Baron Zemo found himself lost in time and in Europe, forced to witness the lives and deaths of the previous generations of &quot;Baron Zemos&quot;, while being violently thrust forward in time at random points of his adventures. The journey forward in time was a prolonged &quot;moment of clarity&quot; experience for Zemo, who saw his family&#x27;s true history and not the rose-colored version his father and grandfather had taught him. When he ultimately returned to the present day, Zemo discovered that a distant cousin had been responsible for his return to the present, though at a horrific cost of causing Zemo to jump forward from era to era every time his cousin murdered a family member who shared the same blood as Helmut. When Helmut discovered that his cousin rescued Zemo just so he could kill his infamous relative, Helmut refused to resist, a move that caused his cousin to attempt to take his own life before Zemo convinced him to put down his gun and stop the cycle of violence.

===Norman Osborn&#x27;s Thunderbolts===
&quot;Thunderbolts&quot; #110 featured a new creative team (writer Warren Ellis and artist Mike Deodato) and a new roster and direction for the team. The team was formed under the control of Norman Osborn, and the majority of the roster was made up of villains wishing to redeem themselves.

The new Thunderbolts roster was as follows:
* Norman Osborn (Leader)
* Moonstone (Field leader)
* Bullseye
* Penance
* Radioactive Man
* Songbird
* Swordsman
* Venom

After the Marvel Comics &quot;Civil War&quot; event, the new Thunderbolts were tasked with tracking down and arresting individuals avoiding the Superhuman Registration Act. Despite the new line-up, many of the themes of the original series continued; in particular, Songbird&#x27;s decision to cripple Bullseye in retaliation for the villain crippling the super-hero Jack Flag, Osborn&#x27;s own struggle for redemption as he claimed, and the growing friendship between Songbird and Radioactive Man. Moonstone was made team leader, a move that proved to be disastrous and ultimately led to Songbird resuming control over the team and expanding the group&#x27;s missions to involve regular super-hero missions besides hunting down unregistered super-heroes.

Due to lengthy delays towards the end of Ellis&#x27;s run, several one-shot specials and a &quot;Penance&quot; limited series were launched to fill in the gap. The &quot;Penance&quot; limited series saw the hero formerly known as Speedball carrying out a complex scheme hatched to gain revenge against Nitro, the man who murdered his teammates the New Warriors, which put him at odds with his new teammates on the Thunderbolts. Several specials advanced other plotlines, such as the mysterious death of Songbird&#x27;s mother and Swordsman betraying the Thunderbolts by allying himself with Arnim Zola to resurrect his sister, after realizing that Osborn would not use his cloning technology to resurrect Andrea.

Following the events of &quot;Caged Angels&quot; (written by Christos Gage), and the Penance limited series, and guest appearances in &quot;Moon Knight&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, the group was thrust into the events of &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, when Thunderbolt Mountain was attacked by the Skrull Khn&#x27;nr, also known as Skrull sleeper agent Captain Marvel. This happened just as Zola dropped off the newly resurrected (via cloning technology) Andrea Strucker.

Barely surviving the fight due to Khn&#x27;ner&#x27;s inability to deal with the implanted memories inside of him belonging to Mar-Vell, the group went on the offensive against the Skrull armada as they invaded Washington DC. During the fight, Andrea teamed with her brother Swordsman. Moonstone and Bullseye feared that she was a Skrull spy sent to infiltrate the group. Moonstone then betrayed Swordsman by joining forces with the Skrulls in order to bait Andrea into revealing herself to be a Skrull. During this, Andrea was shocked to realize that she was a clone, culminating in Bullseye murdering her in order to save Moonstone. With Osborn&#x27;s help, Moonstone blamed the Skrulls for Andrea&#x27;s murder. After the Thunderbolts defeated the Skrull armada attacking Washington, D.C., which included two Super-Skrulls, Osborne begins to play up he and his team&#x27;s role as superheroes to the media, making them appear to be the force that is saving the Earth from Tony Stark&#x27;s bungling. The Thunderbolts then journey to New York where they reluctantly aided Earth&#x27;s heroes in their battle against the Skrulls.

===H.A.M.M.E.R.&#x27;s Thunderbolts===
After Songbird gets mad at Osborn for leaving her to deal with a dangerous Skrull who nearly killed her, Osborn and Moonstone come to the agreement to get rid of Songbird and the other Thunderbolts whose morals do not match their own. Their plan comes into effect while Norman is in Washington during the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, preparing to assume control over S.H.I.E.L.D. The group deports Radioactive Man back to China after Norman has his work visa revoked, and Moonstone has Penance sent to a corrupt maximum security mental institution where he would be held prisoner for the rest of his natural life. Moonstone then aids Bullseye and Venom in attempting to kill Songbird, with Bullseye and Moonstone inadvertently and indirectly revealing to Songbird that Norman has given them permission to kill her. Though she neutralizes Moonstone and Bullseye, Venom attacks Songbird on the &quot;Zeus&quot; minijet; she barely survives the crash. Bullseye recovers and sneaks up on her after the wreck, but the Swordsman saves her and tells her to run away, while blowing up the downed craft to forge her death in the explosion.

Swordsman confronts Norman with the revelation that he is not being offered a position on the &quot;Dark Avengers&quot; team and that Norman had never planned on fulfilling his vow to resurrect the Thunderbolt&#x27;s deceased sister or to give him a full presidential pardon after his contract with the Thunderbolts ended. Norman ends the confrontation by stabbing and defenestrating him.

With Bullseye, Moonstone, and Venom being transferred to Norman&#x27;s new team the Dark Avengers, Osborn decided to create a new Thunderbolts roster, one that would provide themselves as assassins for H.A.M.M.E.R.

The new roster consisted of:
* Black Widow
* Ghost
* Paladin
* Headsman
* Ant-Man
* Grizzly
* Scourge (Field leader)
* Mister X

One of their first missions is an attempt to kill Deadpool after he tries to blackmail Osborn for Norman&#x27;s theft of Skrull data. After Deadpool and Taskmaster thwart the hit, the Thunderbolts then travel to Madripoor to recruit Mister X as a team member. Osborn then adds a new incarnation of Scourge, who Norman seems to know. Songbird eventually returns, and he has his team try to kill her. Yelena abandons the team after Scourge takes over, and reveals to Songbird that she is, in fact, the original Natasha Romanoff working for Nick Fury. The two escape, only to end up leading Osborn to Nick Fury. Osborn orders the Thunderbolts to kill Black Widow and Songbird, and shoots Fury himself; however, &quot;Fury&quot; is revealed to be a Life Model Decoy. After Black Widow and Songbird escape, Scourge is revealed to be the former Super-Soldier Nuke.

Osborn later places Grizzly on the Thunderbolts team at the time they fight the Agents of Atlas. The fight between the Thunderbolts and the Agents of Atlas rages on as the deadly chemicals causes both teams to retreat. During the battle Scourge is brainwashed into shooting when he sees Norman Osborn. As the Thunderbolts return to the Cube on Zeus, their pilots informs that there is an important message from Osborn, Displayed holographically, Osborn informs the Thunderbolts that there is an important assignment he needs them to do in Broxton, Oklahoma, but does not disclose the details. Upon seeing Osborn&#x27;s face, &quot;Scourge&#x27;s&quot; programming kicks him and attempts to shoot. The bullet goes right through the hologram and hits Headsman right in the head, horrifying his teammates.

During the &quot;Siege&quot; storyline, Osborn sends his Thunderbolts to infiltrate Asgard and steal a weapon from the Asgardian armory that will turn the tide in his favor.

The weapon that the Thunderbolts stole from the Asgardian armory was actually Odin&#x27;s spear. They were stopped by the Mighty Avengers but not before Scourge used the spear to sever U.S. Agent&#x27;s left limbs. Most of the team is apprehended by authorities while Paladin and Ant-Man escape.

===Luke Cage&#x27;s Thunderbolts===
A brand new team of Thunderbolts appears in the aftermath of &quot;Siege&quot; as seen during the &quot;Heroic Age&quot; storyline.
Captain Steve Rogers brings Luke Cage to the Raft to assemble a new team of Thunderbolts that will not be related to the ones that Norman Osborn previously assembled and rather be criminals who work towards redemption again. They recruit Ghost (who betrayed Osborn), Moonstone (despite objections by long-standing member Songbird), Juggernaut (who is vouched for by Professor X), Crossbones (who is supposed to gravitate the rest of the Thunderbolts to Cage), and Man-Thing (who serves as the Thunderbolts&#x27; mode of transportation). No longer wearing a costume and now stuck in a wheelchair, U.S. Agent is appointed the new warden of the Raft. During their first training session, Luke Cage is attacked by Baron Helmut Zemo, who declares that he will take leadership of the Thunderbolts. He tells the Thunderbolts that they can serve him if they can escape from the Raft. Though Crossbones is more than willing to oblige, the rest are suspicious. As it turns out, it was a setup to test the team and the Raft&#x27;s security measures. They are then deployed to deal with a group of Asgardian trolls.

After killing two of the trolls and capturing the third (who turned out to be a girl named Gunna who was raised by trolls), the group is reprimanded by Cage for the death of the two trolls. The Thunderbolts are sent out to search for a group of missing S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, who turn out to be mutated by the Terrigen Mist.

After slaying the mutated S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and sealing off the cave, the Thunderbolts return to the Raft for a check-up. The check-up reveals that Crossbones has not been mutated by the Terrigen Mist and that MACH-V will be out for weeks. The facility is soon visited by the staff and students of Avengers Academy. After getting Thunderbolts introduced to the students, the prison&#x27;s power grid suddenly shut down due to an EMP, allowing the Raft&#x27;s inmates to escape. Together with Warden Walker (U.S. Agent) and the staff of Avengers Academy, the Thunderbolts manage to detain all escaped prisoners. Some of Hank Pym&#x27;s students attempted to get to Norman Osborn, so Luke Cage reprimands them.

During the &quot;Shadowland&quot; storyline, the Thunderbolts are assigned with rescuing a young boy who is held prisoner by the Hand, and bringing down their stronghold. While fighting the ninjas, Fixer is stabbed, while Songbird is taken down, giving Moonstone the opportunity to do things her way.

Following the dischargement of Crossbones, the Thunderbolts end up getting Hyperion as a new member when it comes to fighting giant monsters. He betrays the Thunderbolts while they are split up, destroying Man-Thing&#x27;s lower body and legs with his atomic vision and leaving Moonstone and Songbird to drown while he takes the com device which controls the nanites in each Thunderbolts member. Hyperion activates it on Juggernaut to test it after the latter had saved the two drowning members, and Juggernaut responds by fighting back. Moonstone and Ghost join in to help Juggernaut upon which they take down Hyperion. They let Man-Thing touch him after a fallen Hyperion shows fear in front of them. The Thunderbolts next recruit Satana as his replacement when Luke Cage and Doctor Strange discover that the Raft is susceptible to magic.

With recent events involving the Thunderbolts, the team&#x27;s advisory committee approve the creation of a Beta team, the Underbolts. As the Thunderbolts head toward a new mission in Eastern Europe, Songbird, Mach V, and Fixer select candidates of Raft inmates, with the chosen candidates being Troll, Shocker, Centurius, Boomerang and Mister Hyde.

After the mission in Europe as seen during the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Juggernaut gets infected with nanites by Cage, who erroneously thought that he will attack the others. Juggernaut is left at the Raft while the alpha and beta team went on to a mission in Iraq, as zombies emerge from the area. In that moment, a Worthy hammer falls inside the prison and is taken immediately by Juggernaut (who feels also the calling of Cytorak). The hammer ends up transforming Kuurth: Breaker of Stone who ends up destroying the Raft, which led to most of its inmates escaping. The alpha and beta teams are called back to the raft to capture and control inmates, and work to clear the rubble. During the process, Centurius manages to find the controls for the beta team&#x27;s nanites and disable them. The beta team decides to wait for a better time to escape, as they reason that more heroes may be on the way to help the raft. Meanwhile, Moonstone restores order to the partially collapsed women&#x27;s wing of the prison, as Ghost helps the warden avert a crisis in a section of the prison where a malfunctioning failsafe is suffocating inmates. Crossbones, an ex-member of the Thunderbolts, with the help of another inmate, escapes the raft in the chaos. After order is restored, the alpha team, including Songbird and Mach V, is sent to subdue Juggernaut/Kuurth, with the beta team and Fixer held in reserve. To the team&#x27;s surprise, Man-Thing becomes uncontrollable, and teleports away before they fight Juggernaut. Satana explains that he has reached the &quot;next stage&quot; of his evolution, but before she can finish explaining, Juggernaut arrives. The team tries to free Juggernaut from the hammer&#x27;s influence, but fail and he escapes.

====Thunderbolts Throughout Time====
Upon being sent back in time to the World War II era, the Thunderbolts members end up passing themselves off as the American Thunderbolts when they end up helping the World War II era&#x27;s versions of Captain America and Namor. As Centurius adapts the name of Doc Century for this time period, the American Thunderbolts continue their fight with the Nazis and the Human Torch androids that were created by Baron Heinrich Zemo.

From then on the book focuses on the team in the present (Luke Cage, MACH-V, Songbird, Ghost) versus the Underbolts team in the past (Centurius, Satana, Troll, Boomerang, Moonstone, Fixer). Eventually, jumping around in time, the team encounter themselves as the original Thunderbolts (1997) and ends with the renaming of the title into &quot;Dark Avengers&quot; although the storyline carries through.

===Red Hulk&#x27;s Thunderbolts===
A new team composed of Red Hulk, Deadpool, Elektra, Agent Venom, and Punisher debuted as a part of Marvel NOW! major relaunch. Written by Daniel Way with drawings by Steve Dillon. This incarnation is not a government-sponsored team.

Red Hulk assembles his incarnation of the Thunderbolts to be a strike team that is close to &quot;Code Red.&quot; He has gathered Deadpool, Elektra, Punisher, and Agent Venom because &quot;their conditions cannot be cured.&quot; Red Hulk has his Thunderbolts do things that are similar to X-Force. Red Hulk has obtained Samuel Sterns&#x27; body and hooks it up to a machine that emits Red Gamma Radiation onto Samuel Sterns. Deadpool later finds Samuel Sterns&#x27; as a Red Leader with no apparent powers as he expresses his view that the Punisher won&#x27;t be pleased. Punisher finds Red Leader&#x27;s body and shoots him between the eyes disrupting whatever plans Red Hulk has for Red Leader.

Red Hulk brings the Thunderbolts along to deal with gamma technology on the island of Kata Jaya where the technology was supplied by Madman. During the fight against Madman, Red Hulk took the Leader to a pipe line that feeds Gamma energy to Madman&#x27;s lab. Red Hulk then absorbed the energy himself and then forced fed it to the Leader, bringing him back to life. Red Leader is revived, but doesn&#x27;t possess his prior intellect. They do get into the Madman&#x27;s bunker to find out that The Leader hid his intellect on the internet. Madman confronts them and Leader promises to unlock his intellect to his brother, but after whispering one secret word his brother drops dead—his brain not being able to handle all of the information.

The team then follows leads for the supplies of the gamma radiation technology to Kabul to discover Elektra&#x27;s brother Orestez Natchios is creating an army of Crimson Dynamos powered by gamma radiation. Elektra runs off with her brother and claims to have killed him, but Punisher realizes she was lying and kills him himself. During this fiasco, the Red Leader secretly gains access to the internet and downloads his intellect off the internet despite his body not being able to physically contain it (he suffers from profuse nose bleeds).

The Team decides that they can&#x27;t do only missions for Red Hulk, as none truly trust him, so a system of give and take missions is developed, in which the team does a mission for General Ross, then a mission for a random member. The first random name pulled for a member is Punisher, who chooses a mission to take out a crime family in New York. The story arc takes place during the crossover event Infinity. It turns out the Leader purposefully tricked the team into letting him pick the next mission, since he had no skin in the game, so he can escape. He wasn&#x27;t expecting an alien invasion. While trying to escape the team&#x27;s submarine, Red Leader begins to get his brain siphoned by Supergiant of Thanos&#x27; Black Order, but is saved by Red Hulk. He reluctantly releases Mercy and is forced by Red Hulk to trick her into destroying the Black Order&#x27;s flag ship. Afterwards, Red Leader starts having visions of how to kill every member of the Team, but determines that something is wrong with his plan, there was an unseen variable that stopped him from succeeding. That variable presents itself mainly in the form of Abigail Mercy, who joined Ross&#x27;s Thunderbolts team as a condition for her release.

Ghost Rider joins the team in order to stop Mercy, who is getting too powerful to control, but inadvertently drags the team to hell. Leader negotiates a contract with Mephisto to put him back in power of the Underworld by overthrowing the current leader of hell, Strong Guy, who gave up his soul to save his love. Strong Guy throws the fight, so the Thunderbolts escape and Mercy is dragged to hell.

Deadpool&#x27;s name gets pulled next for a mission and he wants to kidnap actor Ryan Reynolds, but Venom asks to be given the mission, as he is leaving the team. He wants to let the symbiote take over and have the team fight it, which they do, to reassure him that if he would lose control of the symbiote, there would be someone that could stop him.

The team then travels to a haunted swamp in Honduras to find an ancient artifact. Leader is the only one who can translate the ancient language. During the boat ride, Leader whispers something cryptic from an ancient language and Johnny Blaze loses his powers and is killed by a tentacled monster. Leader then betrays the team by promising their river guide to help ambush the team, but then doubles crosses him and alerts the team, who them quickly dispose of the ambushers. Leader then tricks the team into entering the secret temple via booby trapped entrance. Ross survives and finds the power of the temple, an infant celestial head. Leader attempts to drink the Celestial&#x27;s blood, but this causes his brain to explode. One of Ross&#x27; former squadmates, Mancuso, is waiting for him and powered by the Celestial. Mancuso warns him that if Ross continues his selfish ways he will be forced to use his cosmic powers to kill him. Ross realizes that he pushes his team too hard and constantly endangers them, so Mansuco teleports them back to before the briefing. Ross decides not to travel to Honduras.

Much later, the team tracked down Doctor Faustus. The Punisher wanted to kill him for murdering all the children in a high school. Red Hulk stopped him and wanted to recruit Faustus, but the Punisher does not like the idea and quits the team. While going to the refrigerator at his safe house, the Punisher found a bomb with a note saying &quot;You don&#x27;t quit on us. You&#x27;re fired.&quot; Angered, the Punisher believes Red Hulk set the bomb and began hunting down his former teammates. He snipers Leader and Faustus. He decapitates Deadpool, who is not angry and actually flattered that Frank found him a threat. He steals magic regalia from Bloodstone and depowers Ghost Rider, but Johnny Blaze is actually glad to be freed of the demon. Punisher can&#x27;t bring himself to kill Elektra, but does confess that he killed her brother. She then admits she knew he would kill her brother. Punisher then uses a customized Hulkbuster armor with a special gun that depowers Red Hulk temporarily. During a gruesome hand-to-hand combat between Ross and Castle, Hawkeye and his new team of Avengers arrest both of them. It is later revealed that Red Leader was alive and set the bomb knowing the Punisher will come after each member of the Thunderbolts and set a Life Model Decoy to fool the other Thunderbolts. The Avengers and Thunderbolts return to Kata Jaya and arrest Leader who is their new dictator. Ross then decides to disband the team.

The annual takes place before the team disbands and follow the team as they work up with W.A.N.D., S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s paranormal research department, in order to take down an out of control Doctor Strange.

===Winter Soldier&#x27;s Thunderbolts===
The Winter Soldier formed his own Thunderbolts team following the events of the &quot;&quot; storyline. Besides Winter Soldier, the membership consisted of Fixer, Atlas, Moonstone, MACH-X, and Kobik. Winter Soldier, Kobik, and MACH-X helped Fixer, Atlas, and Moonstone evade S.H.I.E.L.D. In exchange, they agree to form the Thunderbolts with the mission to make sure that S.H.I.E.L.D. never uses the Kobik Project again.

Over the course of this 12-issue run, Bucky&#x27;s Thunderbolts team clashes with the All-New Inhumans, Squadron Supreme, mysterious alien invaders and others. They also frequently test the limits of Kobik&#x27;s terrifying, reality-bending cosmic powers. The girl is the one who magically manifests the team&#x27;s arctic headquarters and even resolves Fixer&#x27;s time travel-loop conundrum that has lingered since the &quot;Thunderbolts Throughout Time&quot; storyline.

Following the &quot;Civil War II&quot; event, the team reunites with Songbird as they rescue Bucky from an altered, secretly fascist Captain America. She remains with the team, briefly reuniting her romance with Abe Jenkins (MACH-X). In the lead up to the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; event, Zemo attacks the Thunderbolts&#x27; base with the latest incarnation of the Masters of Evil. As that confrontation begins to unfold, Jolt is transported back from Counter Earth just in time to save Atlas from arctic exposure.

Later, Zemo makes a nefarious offer the original Thunderbolts members: give in to their darker natures and join the new rise of Hydra... or die. Abe and Melissa reject the offer, but Fixer, Moonstone, and Atlas ultimately leave the ruins of the HQ with Zemo&#x27;s Masters of Evil. In the aftermath of the destruction, Songbird scours the snowy horizon for Abe, who is presumed dead, while Ghost—who has been spying on the Thunderbolts for some time—rescues a pocket-sized Jolt, who has shrunk due to her power exertion during the battle with the Masters of Evil.

===Punisher: War on the Streets===
After losing custody of Frank Castle in the fledgling country of Bagalia, Baron Zemo and Jigsaw flee to New York City. There, Zemo approaches the Mayor Wilson Fisk, in hopes of joining forces and finally taking on revenge on the Punisher. Fearing a public relations disaster, Mayor Fisk reluctantly agrees—and is promptly dismayed when Zemo reveals a new team of Thunderbolts at a mayoral press conference.

Zemo&#x27;s new Thunderbolts team includes:

* Citizen V (Baron Zemo in disguise)
* Moonstone
* Ghost
* Fixer
* Radioactive Man
* Jigsaw (in disguise)

Mayor Fisk and Citizen V announce to a cheering crowd that the Thunderbolts will work with newly arrived U.N. forces (who are, in fact, Zemo&#x27;s disguised Hydra soldiers) and a covert team of NYPD officers to rid the city of Punisher.

Zemo and his team are able to surprise Frank Castle once, but are thwarted by Black Widow. Moonstone and Mayor Fisk ultimately goad an over-confident Zemo into confronting Punisher again and &quot;Citizen V&quot; musters a rousing speech to rally spooked Hydra agents. The Thunderbolts then clash with Castle again—but discover that the vigilante has reluctantly partnered with a team of other street-level operatives, including Black Widow, Moon Knight, Rachel Cole-Alves, and even Frank&#x27;s old Thunderbolts teammate, Ghost Rider. The battle is fierce and even though Frank shoots down Fixer (or possibly a robotic copy) and corners &quot;Citizen V,&quot; Jigsaw intervenes... and the Thunderbolts escape with Rachel as a hostage. As they flee, Zemo challenges Frank to come retrieve her... alone.

The ploy doesn&#x27;t work. Punisher and Zemo battle at Fisk Tower. Before Frank can kill Zemo, Ghost intervenes. Calling Zemo &quot;a third-rate fascist with an inherited army,&quot; Ghost tells the defeated Zemo to return to Bagalia and wire him his money. Punisher wards Ghost off and Zemo is able to meet Mayor Fisk on the roof, hoping to rally a comeback. Instead, Mayor Fisk tells Zemo that he&#x27;s in over his head. At the touch of Ghost&#x27;s hand, Zemo is seemingly vaporized. Fisk thanks Ghost and tells him that they&#x27;ll discuss &quot;the details of their arrangement&quot; later.

===Mayor Wilson Fisk&#x27;s Thunderbolts===
When the symbiote god Knull encircles the planet in symbiote goo and sets out to destroy every living thing on Earth, Mayor Wilson Fisk decides to put together his own team of superpowered operatives to beat back Knull&#x27;s creatures and save the city. He secretly meets with eight of these operatives, all known criminals who have been working in the city without Kingpin&#x27;s blessing:

* Taskmaster
* Mister Fear
* Batroc the Leaper
* Rhino
* Star (Ripley Ryan)
* Ampere
* Snakehead

To pay Kingpin back, these criminals must escort Star (current keeper of one of the Infinity Gems) into battle to kill Knull, but to do that they&#x27;ll first need to make contact with a man Kingpin believes can help turn the tide against the god. Only one of the criminals, Incendiary, opts to take his chances in jail instead, but when he&#x27;s taken out of the boardroom by Kingpin&#x27;s guards, he&#x27;s immediately shot. The remaining seven criminals then promptly agree to Kingpin&#x27;s plan. Despite objections, this team will be called &quot;The Thunderbolts&quot; (because Kingpin owns the copyright). The team sets out into the city and is promptly attacked by a giant Symbiote Dragon. Snakehead is devoured, but Mister Fear and Star are able to fell the Symbiote Dragon. The team learns that there&#x27;s a limit to Star&#x27;s cosmic powers (she&#x27;s woozy after battle) and when Ampere exclaims that the team is doomed and he&#x27;s leaving, Mister Fear murders him. Taskmaster, de facto team leader, scolds Mister Fear, but the team helps themselves to Ampere&#x27;s electric gauntlets, giving Taskmaster and Batroc&#x27;s abilities an extra kick. Taskmaster can&#x27;t keep Rhino from walking away from the team. Then he shortly makes the call not to help the Manhattan Defenders battle more symbiote creatures. As the dwindled team slinks away from the scene, they&#x27;re attacked by symbiote creature that&#x27;s possessed Ampere&#x27;s corpse and, before they know it, are being chased by a hoard of ravenous symbiotes. The team escapes to a fishing boat—nearly leaving Batroc behind—and finally reach their destination: The Ravencroft Institute. Inside they find the man Kingpin believes can defeat Knull: notorious supervillain and former Thunderbolts leader Norman Osborn. Norman Osborn and the Thunderbolts make their way through Ravencroft amidst the Symbiote attacks where they joined up by Figment, Foolkiller, Grizzly, Man-Bull, and Mister Hyde. While noting that Sentry would&#x27;ve been able to fight Knull, it was noted that Knull defeated him and absorbed Void. Osborn then leads the Thunderbolts into retrieving Sentry&#x27;s corpse so that it can be used as a nuke to destroy Knull&#x27;s lair on top of the Empire State Building with it being a suicide mission. Foolkiller was taken over by one of the Symbiotes and was killed. Taskmaster used Figment&#x27;s abilities to make it look like the Thunderbolts sacrificed their lives to pull off the mission. After Mayor Fisk broadcasts the Thunderbolts&#x27; sacrifice during the fight against the Symbiote invasion, the Thunderbolts arrive and blackmail him into raising their pay and giving them further missions once Knull is defeated.

====Devil&#x27;s Reign====
During the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot; storyline, Mayor Wilson Fisk sets up the expanded Thunderbolts units to help crack down on superhuman vigilantism while partnering up with Senator Arthur Krane of the Friends of Humanity and other benefactors. These Thunderbolts units are tasked to assist the NYPD and take down the superheroes. Moon Knight is the first to be apprehended by Agony, Electro II, Rhino, and U.S. Agent. Doctor Octopus accompanied the NYPD and Homeland Security to the Baxter Building to do a full investigation on the weapons of mass destruction that might be located there. Reed Richards and Susan Storm are apprehended, but Susan manages to get a Code X7 off to Human Torch and Thing who evacuate Franklin Richards and Valeria Richards. Shocker apprehends Darkhawk, but is subdued by Luke Cage and Jessica Jones when he tries to get them to surrender. At the Rand Corporation, Danny Rand is attacked by the NYPD with Crossbones leading them. Rand was later mentioned to have been apprehended. At the Daily Bugle, Taskmaster and Whiplash do a hostage sitatution to draw out Spider-Man. They badly beat him up and leave him for the NYPD on the streets below. After a confrontation with Mayor Fisk, Elektra in her Daredevil appearance is hunted by Kraven the Hunter. Serpent Society members Coachwhip and Puff Adder appear as members of the Thunderbolts when they were targeting Spider-Woman. At the time when the Thunderbolts managed to apprehend most of the Purple Children, Jessica Jones and the Champions tried to rescue them only to be repelled by the Thunderbolts&#x27; latest member Abomination. The recruitment of Abomination was the result of Rhino leaving the group as he believed hunting children crossed the line.

Following Kingpin&#x27;s defeat, Mayor Luke Cage deals with the remainder of the Thunderbolts units that were loyal to Kingpin with help from Spectrum. A public relations specialist named Helen Astrantia has been tasked to re-frame the Thunderbolts. She and Mayor Cage plan to ask Hawkeye to lead the Thunderbolts since Black Knight, Falcon, Mockingbird, Spectrum, and Wasp don&#x27;t want the job.

===Hawkeye&#x27;s Thunderbolts===
Hawkeye is eventually chosen to lead the Thunderbolts with America Chavez, Power Man, Persuasion, and a new character named Gutsen Glory whose background and how Helen Astrantia obtained his services are classified. Their first mission has them apprehending Abomination, Agony, Electro II, Taskmaster, and Whiplash who broke out of a prison transport and were holding hostages. Hawkeye takes on U.S. Agent who claims that he is still working for the government. Most of its members are defeated as Spectrum shows up to defeat Electro II. In a discussion with Mayor Luke Cage on if she wants to stick around and help the Thunderbolts, Spectrum states that she&#x27;ll think about it. After Mayor Luke Cage and Hawkeye&#x27;s press conference regarding the fight with the escaped prisoners and U.S. Agent, Hawkeye and the Thunderbolts are dispatched by Helen Astrantia to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to deal with a creature inside it. The Thunderbolts have difficulty with the creature until Spectrum joins the fight. The creature surrenders and introduces itself as Eegro the Unbreakable from Monster Isle. Later that day, Helen persuades Hawkeye to take Eegro the Unbreakable in as the latest member of the Thunderbolts as Spectrum decides to join the group. After spending a night with Blue Marvel, Spectrum joins the Thunderbolts in a training mission in Central Park as Helen Astrantia arrives straight from a perfume photo shoot with Persuasion and Eergo the Unbreakable as she states to Hawkeye that he will not need to wear his mask. Then she dispatches the Thunderbolts to the Central Park Zoo which has been taken over by the Super-Apes who have declared themselves free from Red Ghost. They are now led by a powered-up chimpanzee named Yaroslavi. The Super-Apes give the Thunderbolts difficulty until the police unleashing knockout gas in the area. As Mayor Cage and Helen talk about the latest bad press about the Thunderbolts, Gutsen Glory mentions the flaws that Hawkeye and Spectrum have while America Chavez and Power Man ride the subway until America collapses. Later that night, Hawkeye makes a call to Mockingbird. Persuasion and Eergo the Unbreakable are interviewed on a talk show about Persuasion&#x27;s perfume and the Thunderbolts as Hawkeye has spent the night with Mockingbird as a guest. Later that day, the Thunderbolts face off against Melter and Whirlwind who are holding hostages until the Thunderbolts defeated them. Hawkeye is later interviewed where Black Widow, Mockingbird, and Helen Astrania are present. The Thunderbolts then respond to an attack caused by Terminus as Hawkeye hears a voice in his head taunting him. Meanwhile, the EMTs respond to America Chavez&#x27; collapse as Power Man has been doing some CPR. When Helen goes to Hawkeye&#x27;s apartment to check up on him, she finds Hawkeye floating above his bed with his eyes glowing. As Hawkeye has a vision of him and the Thunderbolts being zapped by Terminus, it is shown that Nightmare is responsible as he plans to use America Chavez&#x27; powers to access the Multiverse and take over its respectful waking worlds. While noting that he wanted to torment Hawkeye again, he changed his plans and started tormenting the Thunderbolts while planning to take advantage of America Chavez. Following nightmares about Dormammu and the Mindless Ones, Thanos, the Marvel Zombies, and Galactus, America Chavez breaks free and frees the other Thunderbolts members from their nightmares. As the Thunderbolts fight Nightmare, Eergo the Unbreakable unleashes his ultimate attack that involves him growing as he smashes Nightmare. As Nightmare gets back up, Persuasion uses her powers to mind-control Nightmare into going to sleep. After the fight, Helen Astrania is told by America Chavez that Nightmare was dropped into a dimension where he&#x27;ll be asleep for a long time. Though she does mention the budget problems when it comes to shrinking Eergo the Unbreakable back to his normal size much to his dismay. The next morning, Hawkeye is doing some archery when he is visited by Mayor Luke Cage who states that Hawkeye is on probation and expects more from the Thunderbolts. Mayor Cage then takes his leave stating that he&#x27;ll see Hawkeye on Monday. Then Hawkeye calls up Mockingbird and asks if she wants to go out for coffee since she is in town. He gets a positive response and states that he will see her soon.

===The Revolution&#x27;s Thunderbolts===
Following the events of the &quot;Captain America: Cold War&quot; storyline, Bucky Barnes becomes the Outer Circle&#x27;s New Revolution and inherits the shadowy organization&#x27;s decades of valuable intel after dissolving it. With these resources at his disposal, the Revolution meets with Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (later revealed to be a Life Model Decoy of the original) to form a new Thunderbolts team to eliminate the Red Skull and his enterprises. The two recruit the Destroyer and Red Guardian to raid the Red Skull&#x27;s base in Argentina, where they succeed in killing his host body and propagandist mouthpiece Aleksander Lukin. When the Red Skull&#x27;s fortune is acquired by Wilson Fisk, Revolution, and new recruits Black Widow and White Widow infiltrate a party hosted by the Hellfire Club and leave the Skull&#x27;s Nazi gold trapped in an inaccessible pocket dimension. Afterwards, Fontaine discovers that in response to the Red Skull&#x27;s setbacks, Nazi spies in the U.S. Government plan to destroy the Red Skull&#x27;s remaining secret base in Latveria to cover to his escape; the preemptive strike could potentially start a World War while giving the Red Skull a chance to come back stronger than ever. Revolution recruits Shang-Chi to intercept U.S. Agent and American Kaiju in Hong Kong, both of whom were tricked by the Red Skull&#x27;s agents in the United States Army into destroying his Latverian hideout. Red Skull remotely forces American Kaiju to go on a rampage in the city, but he is subdued by Revolution with assistance from U.S. Agent, who joins the Thunderbolts to enact revenge on the Red Skull. After Doctor Doom dismisses Barnes&#x27; warning of the Red Skull&#x27;s plans and denies him entry into Latveria, the Thunderbolts infiltrate the country and attack Red Skull in his secret bunker. The Thunderbolts fight the Skull and his forces long enough for Doom to arrive and attack them with a powerful energy blast for trespassing into his territory. The Thunderbolts teleport at the last minute, resulting in Red Skull getting killed by the blast instead. Infuriated for being proven wrong and more so for being used by the Thunderbolts, Doom angrily contacts Barnes, but ultimately lets the team go after Barnes calls him a Thunderbolt.

During the &quot;One World Under Doom&quot; storyline, Doctor Doom attempts to recruit Bucky&#x27;s Thunderbolts to his side. After Doctor Doom destroyed Bucky&#x27;s hometown of Shelbyville in retaliation and framing Bucky for the attack, Doctor Doom reveals his plans to form his version of the Thunderbolts called the Fulgar Victoris.

==Members==
==Slogan==
:&quot;Justice, like lightning, ever should appear to few men&#x27;s ruin, but to all men&#x27;s fear.&quot;

The series&#x27; slogan, &quot;Justice, Like Lightning...&quot; was attributed to a poem by Thomas Randolph in &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; #1. However, upon further investigation, Kurt Busiek could not find any evidence that this phrase had actually appeared in Thomas Randolph&#x27;s writings. Busiek himself had originally taken the slogan from the Roy Thomas-penned issues of &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, where the quote was similarly attributed to Randolph.

The quote is frequently attributed to Joseph Swetnam, but this was not Swetnam himself, but rather a character based on him in the 1620 play &quot;Swetnam the Woman-Hater Arraigned by Women&quot;, which was written by an unknown author. Busiek reports that one &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; fan located a version of the couplet attributed to Irish archbishop Milo Sweetman, who died in 1380.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Contest of Champions&quot;===
The 2015 &quot;&quot; comic series features a universe where Iron Man and the Pro-Registration won Civil War with everything going in Tony&#x27;s favor for five years. The Thunderbolts in this universe are members of Captain America&#x27;s Anti-Registration team who buy time off their sentence with suicide missions from the government, similar to DC&#x27;s Suicide Squad. This version of the team is led by Steve Rogers and is composed of Spider-Man, Invisible Woman, Goliath, and the Punisher. When President Stark and his Mighty Avengers are kidnapped by Maestro and sent to Battleworld, the government sends the Thunderbolts to retrieve them. After a fight breaks out between them, the Mighty Avengers, and the Renegade Champions, Tony kills Steve and reveals that he used the Reality Gem to rig the war in his favor. Tony attempts to use the Gem on Battleworld to achieve a similar feat, but since he is no longer in his universe, the Gem is powerless, and he and the Punisher are swiftly killed by the Maestro. The surviving Mighty Avengers and Thunderbolts stay behind on Battleworld after the fight and dub themselves the Civil Warriors.

===&quot;Fightbolts&quot;===
From &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; #76-81, the Thunderbolts were no longer featured. The focus of the comic shifted to Daniel Axum, a former supervillain known as the Battler. Axum joined an underground fighting circuit that employed other supervillains, including the Armadillo. Axum, along with fellow combatant Man-Killer, turned on his criminal manager Rey Trueno, and refused to return to the supervillain lifestyle. Despite continuing the title and numbering, this incarnation had no connection to the better-known team listed above, and the title was cancelled six issues into this direction.

===Marvel Zombies===
In &quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot;, zombified Thunderbolts appear, rampaging across New York. The undead Thunderbolts are killed by the combined forces of Nova, Thor, and the Fantastic Four.

===MC2===
While the majority of the Thunderbolts have yet to appear in the MC2 Universe, Jolt appeared as an Avenger before the current team assembled in &quot;A-Next&quot; #1.

&quot;Spider-Girl&quot; introduces a government team for reformed villains, similar to the Thunderbolts, consisting of:

===&quot;Millennial Visions&quot;===
In the story &quot;Thunderbolts: Give a Guy a Break&quot;, in the &quot;Marvel Universe: Millennial Visions&quot; one-shot (set in Earth-22000), the Thunderbolts revolt against Zemo, and Hawkeye leads them on to be true heroes, bringing in and converting other villains.

===&quot;Spider-Verse&quot;===
A version of the Thunderbolts (Earth-138) appear as the police and fire department of the regime of President Norman &quot;Ozzy&quot; Osborn featured in &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;. Known as the &quot;Thunderbolt Department&quot;, they are equipped with the universe&#x27;s version of the Venom Symbiote, Variable Engagement Neuro-sensitive Organic Mesh, or V.E.N.O.M, and join President Osborn&#x27;s campaign against Spider-Punk and his Spider-Army.

===&quot;Wolverine: Days of Future Past&quot;===
In the limited series, &quot;Wolverine: Days of Future Past&quot;, the Thunderbolts are the private security force of the ruling Sentinels, under the command of Baron Zemo. However, Zemo is also secretly working with Shinobi Shaw and Psylocke as part of a new Hellfire Club to bring about the Sentinels&#x27; downfall.

===&quot;Old Man Logan&quot;===
In &quot;Old Man Hawkeye&quot;, a prequel to &quot;Old Man Logan&quot;, it is revealed that Baron Zemo coerced the Thunderbolts into betraying the Avengers and allying with the villains, killing nearly every hero except for Hawkeye, whom they left out of spite. The plot of the prequel comic revolves around an older Hawkeye hunting down the former Thunderbolts to avenge his fallen comrades.

==In other media==
===Television===
* A loose depiction of Norman Osborn&#x27;s Thunderbolts appears in the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; episode &quot;New Warriors&quot;. This version of the group is a team of young superhumans established by Taskmaster and consists of Cloak and Dagger and the Vulture, with the Green Goblin as a silent benefactor. The Thunderbolts raid the S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier to break the Goblin out of their custody, though they and the Sinister Six end up fighting Spider-Man and the New Warriors. In the aftermath, Cloak and Dagger defect to Spider-Man&#x27;s side and Taskmaster is apprehended, though the Vulture and the Goblin escape.
* Baron Helmut Zemo&#x27;s Thunderbolts appear in &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot;, consisting of Citizen V, MACH-IV, Songbird, Atlas, Meteorite, and Techno. Similarly to the comics, this version of the group are the Masters of Evil, who use an inversion stabilizer to disguise themselves and masquerade as superheroes. Throughout their self-titled episode and &quot;Thunderbolts Revealed&quot;, the Thunderbolts work with the Avengers until a suspicious Hawkeye discovers the Thunderbolts&#x27; true identities. In the ensuing fight, Captain America inspires Songbird to legitimately become a hero and convince her teammates to expose Zemo and turn on him. Though Zemo escapes, Hawkeye advises the remaining Thunderbolts to turn themselves in and work towards becoming official heroes once they serve their time.
* A band inspired by the Thunderbolts called &quot;Screaming Mimi and the Thunderbolts&quot; appear in the &quot;Marvel Rising&quot; short &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot;, led by Melissa Gold and consisting of Atlas, Jolt and Moonstone look-a-likes.

<text>Giacomo Inaudi (13 October 1867 – 10 November 1950), also known as Jacques Inaudi in France, was an Italian calculating prodigy.

He was born in Roccabruna, Piedmont, Italy. As a child he was a shepherd but showed aptitude for mental calculation. Inaudi&#x27;s abilities attracted the interest of showmen and he toured around the world.

French scientists like Jean-Martin Charcot investigated his abilities, French astronomer Camille Flammarion praised him in strong terms, and Alfred Binet wrote a book on him. Inaudi would repeat the numbers he was given before he began his mental calculations.

Inaudi was referred to by the Nobel-prize-winning immunologist, Élie Metchnikoff (Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov), in his book &quot;The Nature of Man: Studies in Optimistic Philosophy&quot; (1905). Metchnikoff regarded Inaudi as an example of a mutation, in the sense announced by the Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries (&quot;Die Mutationstheorie&quot;, Vol. 1, Leipzig, 1901), i.e., a sudden leap to a distinct new type that might be regarded as a new species. Metchnikoff argued that this kind of abrupt leap in evolution might explain how humans had emerged from apes and that Inaudi was proof that such a mutation was possible.

==Biography==
Giacomo Inaudi was perhaps the most Mental calculator prodigy in history. Born very poor, as a child he was initiated into his father&#x27;s trade, shepherding. But he soon showed aptitude for Mental calculation and was taken to Marseilles where, at the age of 12, he met Bénédit Jules Dombey, a sales representative, who was to become his impresario and whose daughter he married. The latter would guide him around the world in a series of performances as well as meetings with the scientific community. He was, among other things, introduced to the Académie Française, which commissioned Jean-Martin Charcot and Alfred Binet to thoroughly examine Inaudi&#x27;s abilities. In particular, Binet delved into the matter, making it the subject of several publications. Other French scientists took an interest in his abilities: some, such as Camille Flammarion, enthusiastically; others, especially mathematicians, emphasized the fact that Inaudi&#x27;s methods were based mainly on his personal talents (such as prodigious memory) or &quot;tricks,&quot; and therefore could not be proposed for widespread use. Among his abilities, he could add or subtract numbers of even 20 digits or more together, or extract square and cube roots, in a matter of minutes; and he could readily indicate the day of the week of any date from the 17th century onward.

<text>An official script is a writing system that is specifically designated to be official in the constitutions or other applicable laws of countries, states, and other jurisdictions. Akin to an official language, an official script is much rarer. It is used primarily where an official language is in practice written with two or more scripts. As, in these languages, use of script often has cultural or political connotations, proclamation of an official script is sometimes criticized as having a goal of influencing culture or politics or both. Desired effects also may include easing education, communication and some other aspects of life.

<text>SCOsource is a business division of The SCO Group that managed its (now legally voided) Unix intellectual property. The term SCOsource is often used for SCO&#x27;s licensing program that allowed corporate users of Linux to buy licenses to proprietary Unix technology that SCO claimed exists in the Linux operating system. A single CPU license costs $699 (USD).

On July 21, 2003, SCO announced that it intended to sell binary-only licences to use the free Linux operating system which would remove the threat of litigation from licence-holders. Linux advocates reacted by stating that SCO had no basis for this action, as their claims were still disputed in court, and that the terms of the GPL seemed to indicate that doing this may cause SCO to forfeit their rights to distribute Linux or Linux-derived code in any form.

== EV1Servers.net ==
On March 1, 2004, SCO announced it had reached a license agreement with EV1Servers.net, which allowed EV1Servers to use some of SCO&#x27;s &quot;intellectual property&quot;. SCO&#x27;s Blake Stowell claimed the deal was worth upward of &quot;seven figures&quot; ($1,000,000) while a few days later EV1Servers CEO Robert Marsh claimed the amount was much lower. The exact amount was required to remain secret under terms of the agreement.

== Computer Associates ==
During discovery of the SCO v. IBM case, SCO attorney Mark J. Heise wrote a letter answering some questions raised by IBM&#x27;s attorneys. In this letter, sent on February 4, 2004 and published on Groklaw on February 10, 2004, Heise revealed that Computer Associates bought a Linux intellectual property license from SCO.

On March 6, 2004 Network Computing likewise published an article in which it said: &quot;Computer Associates, a major corporate backer and user of Linux, signed a SCOsource license last August as part of a $40 million settlement between CA, the Canopy Group and Center 7&quot;. Sam Greenblatt, senior vice president and chief architect of the Linux technology group at CA, further added that &quot;CA&#x27;s license for Linux technology is part of a larger settlement with the Canopy Group. It has nothing to do with SCO&#x27;s strategy of intimidation.&quot;

Computer Associates later denied buying licenses from SCO :

:&quot;CA senior VP of product development Mark Barrenechea says that Bench&#x27;s claim is nonsense. CA has not paid SCO any Linux taxes, he said. Drawing up short of calling SCO a liar, Barrenechea claims that SCO has twisted a $40 million breach-of-contract settlement that CA paid last summer to the Canopy Group, SCO&#x27;s biggest stockholder, and Center 7, another Canopy company, and has turned it into a purported Linux license.&quot;

:&quot;As a &#x27;small part&#x27; of that settlement, Barrenechea said, CA got a bunch of UnixWare licenses that it needed to support its UnixWare customers. SCO, he said, had just attached a transparent Linux indemnification to all UnixWare licenses and that is how SCO comes off calling CA a Linux licensee.&quot;

== SCOsource revenue ==

In October 2004 SCO Group Inc&#x27;s CEO Darl McBride would admit that, after initial deals with Microsoft Corp and Sun Microsystems Inc brought in $8.3m in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, revenue from SCOsource would drop to $7.3 million in the third quarter and $10.3 million in the fourth. Revenue from SCOsource then plummeted to $20,000 in the first quarter of 2004, followed by $11,000 in the second quarter and $678,000 in the third quarter.

In June 2007 SCO revealed that quarterly revenue from SCOsource in the 2004-2005 period averaged $20,000 to $35,000. The company’s financial results indicate that SCOsource has generated a total of $27.5m between 2003 - 2007, at a cost of $55.2m.

<text>Oscar Merril Hartzell (1876–1943) was an American con man who ran a confidence scam by claiming rightful ownership of the estate of Sir Francis Drake. In total, Hartzell swindled at least $2 million , from 70,000 to 80,000 people.

==Early life==

Hartzell was born in 1876 in Monmouth, Illinois. He worked on his family&#x27;s farm, eventually inheriting it from his father in 1905. Due to difficulties running the farm, Hartzell fell into financial trouble. He moved to Des Moines, Iowa, where he worked as a realtor, and then as a deputy sheriff. According to Hartzell, in 1915 he met con artists Sudie Whiteaker and Milo Lewis, who promised to turn his mother&#x27;s $6,000 into $6 million by giving him a share of the held fortune of Sir Francis Drake. When Hartzell realized the deal was a confidence game, he decided to use it to his own advantage, and joined in.

==Sir Francis Drake estate scam==

Hartzell contacted many Iowans who had the surname Drake. He claimed he was a distant relative and had discovered that the estate of Sir Francis Drake had never been paid to his heirs, that it had gathered interest for the last 300 years and was now worth $100 billion. Hartzell invited all these families to invest in his campaign to sue the British government for the money and assured them that everyone would make $500 for every dollar they invested. The inheritance would include the whole city of Plymouth in England.

Tens of thousands of Americans sponsored him, sometimes with all the money they had. Hartzell later expanded his con to people without the surname Drake and outside of Iowa.

Around 1917, Hartzell travelled to London in order to meet with the heir of the Drake estate. He ended up staying, and lived an opulent lifestyle. He continued to tell the families who had invested in the &quot;campaign&quot; that he was negotiating with the British government and needed even more money for expenses. His agents in the Midwest, some of whom believed in the scheme themselves, collected the money.

On August 9, 1922, the British Home Office informed the American embassy that there was no unclaimed Sir Francis Drake estate. Hartzell explained that the estate was not unclaimed because it belonged to Drexel Drake (a nonexistent colonel) and therefore to Hartzell.

Since Hartzell had not broken any British laws the British police could not arrest him. The FBI investigated and announced that Drake&#x27;s wife had duly inherited his estate in 1597. That information did not stop the donations. When Ed Smith, Iowa Secretary of State, tried to convince the state legislature to act, the public and Hartzell&#x27;s supporters protested, saying they could donate to whomever they wanted so the legislature did nothing.

After the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and during the Great Depression, Hartzell&#x27;s followers seemed to become even more desperate and continued to send him money.

On October 11, 1930, John Maynard Keynes, arguing in an article for deficit spending to alleviate the Depression, mentioned that Queen Elizabeth had invested Drake&#x27;s loot—which Drake had given to the crown—for the benefit of the country. Hartzell seized this as a proof of his claims and his agents in the USA spread copies of the article to his followers.

Eventually United States Postal Service inspector John Sparks, with help from the British police, seized some of Hartzell&#x27;s agents and forced them to reveal the scam. At the same time, Scotland Yard arrested some of Hartzell&#x27;s British associates. Britain deported Hartzell to USA and he was sent to Iowa for trial in 1933. By this time, according to U.S. officials, Hartzell had collected $800,000 from the scam.

Hartzell was tried in Sioux City, Iowa in 1933. His followers sent him a total of $68,000 for his defence. He was convicted of fraud in November 1933, sentenced to ten years in prison, and fined $2,000. By that time, he had run his scam for over 15 years. He was sent to Leavenworth Penitentiary. Even after his sentencing, some of his agents collected more donations—$500,000 for the next year.

Hartzell was eventually judged to be insane, and was transferred to the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners. He died there in 1943.

<doc id="875035" wikidata="Q1432769" url="?curid=875035" title="Corrugated galvanised iron">
<text>Corrugated galvanised iron (CGI) or steel, colloquially corrugated iron (near universal), wriggly tin (taken from UK military slang), pailing (in Caribbean English), corrugated sheet metal (in North America), zinc (in Cyprus and Nigeria) or custom orb / corro sheet (Australia), is a building material composed of sheets of hot-dip galvanised mild steel, cold-rolled to produce a linear ridged pattern in them. Although it is still popularly called &quot;iron&quot; in the UK, the material used is actually steel (which is iron alloyed with carbon for strength, commonly 0.3% carbon), and only the surviving vintage sheets may actually be made up of 100% iron. The corrugations increase the bending strength of the sheet in the direction perpendicular to the corrugations, but not parallel to them, because the steel must be stretched to bend perpendicular to the corrugations. Normally each sheet is manufactured longer in its strong direction.

CGI is lightweight and easily transported. It was and still is widely used especially in rural and military buildings such as sheds and water tanks. Its unique properties were used in the development of countries such as Australia from the 1840s, and it is still helping developing countries today.

== History ==
Henry Robinson Palmer, architect and engineer to the London Dock Company, was granted a patent in 1829 for &quot;indented or corrugated metallic sheets&quot;. It was originally made from wrought iron produced by puddling. It proved to be light, strong, corrosion-resistant, and easily transported, and particularly lent itself to prefabricated structures and improvisation by semi-skilled workers. It soon became a common construction material in rural areas in the United States, Argentina, Spain, New Zealand and Australia and later India, and in Australia and Argentina also became (and remains) a common roofing material even in urban areas. In Australia and New Zealand particularly it has become part of the cultural identity, and fashionable architectural use has become common. CGI is also widely used as building material in African slums and informal settlements.

For roofing purposes, the sheets are laid somewhat like tiles, with a lateral overlap of one and half corrugations, and a vertical overlap of about , to provide for waterproofing. CGI is also a common construction material for industrial buildings throughout the world.

Wrought iron CGI was gradually replaced by mild steel from around the 1890s, and iron CGI is no longer obtainable, but the common name has not been changed. Galvanised sheets with simple corrugations are also being gradually displaced by 55% Al-Zn coated steel or coil-painted sheets with complex profiles. CGI remains common.

== Corrugation today ==
Today the corrugation process is carried out using the process of roll forming. This modern process is highly automated to achieve high productivity and low costs associated with labour. In the corrugation process sheet metal is pulled off huge rolls and through rolling dies that form the corrugation. After the sheet metal passes through the rollers it is automatically sheared off at a desired length. The traditional shape of corrugated material is the round wavy style, but different dies form a variety of shapes and sizes. Industrial buildings are often built with and covered by trapezoidal sheet metal.

Many materials today undergo the corrugation process. The most common materials for corrugated iron are ferrous alloys (e.g. stainless steels), aluminium and copper. Regular ferrous alloys are the most common due to price and availability. Common sizes of corrugated material can range from a very thin 30 gauge () to a relatively thick 6 gauge (). Thicker or thinner gauges may also be produced.

Other materials such as thermoplastic and fiberglass-reinforced plastic sheets are also produced with corrugations. Clear or translucent products can allow light to penetrate below.

== Pitch and depth ==

The corrugations are described in terms of pitch (the distance between two crests) and depth (the height from the top of a crest to the bottom of a trough). It is important for the pitch and depth to be quite uniform, in order for the sheets to be easily stackable for transport, and to overlap neatly when joining two sheets. Pitches have ranged from 25 mm (1 inch) to 125 mm (5 inches).

It was once common for CGI used for vertical walls to have a shorter pitch and depth than roofing CGI. This shorter pitched material was sometimes called &quot;rippled&quot; instead of &quot;corrugated&quot;. 
However nowadays, nearly all CGI produced has the same pitch of 3 inches (76 mm).

A design of corrugated galvanised steel sheets &quot;Proster 21&quot;, used as formwork, has 21 millimetre deep V-shaped pits.

==Corrosion==

Although galvanising inhibits the corrosion of steel, rusting is inevitable, especially in marine areas–where the salt water encourages rust–and areas where the local rainfall is acidic. Corroded corrugated steel roofs can nevertheless last for many years, particularly if the sheets are protected by a layer of paint.

<text>The Striezelmarkt in Dresden is one of the first genuine Christmas markets in the world. Founded as a one-day market in 1434, it celebrated its 585th anniversary in 2019. Its 240 stands attract about 3 million visitors from all over the world. The annual market lasts throughout the Advent season until Christmas Eve.

==History and naming==
This market event was first mentioned in 1434, under Friedrich II, Elector of Saxony, when it was held the Monday before Christmas on the Altmarkt square. Originally, it was a one-day market to provide the citizens of Dresden with the sale of meat for the Christmas meal after the traditional Advent period of fasting.

In the 21st century, the Striezelmarkt has developed into a huge event with 240 stands. It takes up a large part of Dresden city centre and lasts throughout the Advent period until Christmas Eve.

The word &quot;Striezelmarkt&quot; comes from &quot;Strüzel&quot; or &quot;Stroczel&quot;, which was the name of a type of cake sold at the market; it is now widely known as &quot;Stollen&quot; or &quot;Christstollen&quot;. &quot;Stollen&quot; is a light airy fruitcake that is quite low in sugar, and today is available in many parts of the world. The true Dresden &quot;Stollen&quot;, however, is produced in the city and distinguished by a special seal depicting Augustus II, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland. The shape of the cake is meant to be reminiscent of the entrance to a mine tunnel (the literal meaning of &quot;Stollen&quot;), reflecting the area&#x27;s silver and tin mining history.

==Features of today&#x27;s Striezelmarkt==

Today the most famous features of Dresden Striezelmarkt are the world&#x27;s largest usable Christmas arch with a breadth of and a height of more than and the high Erzgebirge Christmas pyramid. Situated on the Dresden Striezelmarkt is a children&#x27;s adventure world. Here, the prune chimney sweep’s cottage and the bakery are open for kneading and arts and crafts. A puppet theatre, merry-go-round, and a children&#x27;s railway are also operating. On the Dresden Striezelmarkt, a daily stage programme takes place. During Advent weekends, special events such as Dresden Stollen Festival and Pyramid and Christmas Arch Festival take place.

At the centre of the Striezelmarkt stands a high spruce, brought from the nearby Tharandt woods and decorated with lights. At the back of the market square there is a painted wooden fairy-tale castle, designed to operate as a giant Advent calendar. Children&#x27;s entertainers open a door each day and present a puppet show. On Fridays, Father Christmas himself visits.

* Wooden ornaments
:Many of the stands at the Striezelmarkt sell carved wooden ornaments of a huge variety of shapes and sizes. This practice dates to the period of the area&#x27;s mining history. Dresden is the largest city near the &quot;Erzgebirge&quot;, or Ore Mountains, where silver and tin were discovered in around 1168. The discovery brought many miners to the area, but they lost their jobs as a result of the German Peasants&#x27; War and competition from abroad. Needing a new way to earn money, the miners took up woodcarving, incorporating mining symbols and religious elements into their designs. These symbols can still be found in the Christmas ornaments sold at the Striezelmarkt.

* Candle pyramids (Christmas pyramid)
:In many parts of Germany, the candle pyramid (lightstock) is brought out every year to light up the room at Christmas. Two to five round wooden tiers, gradually smaller towards the top, are built onto a central rod. The tiers rotate, driven by the heat of candles rising up into a rotor at the top. On each tier there are figures connected with Christmas. The whole ornament is usually about high. The tallest pyramid in the world dominates the Striezelmarkt, towering a full in the air. Originally, the pyramid was a much simpler affair, simply a frame to hang sprigs of fir upon. The modern-day pyramid was not developed until the early 19th century.

* Schwibbogen
:Literally, the word &quot;Schwibbogen&quot; means an arch &quot;hanging&quot; (&quot;schweben&quot;) above you, between two walls. This candle-holder is arch-shaped, representing the arched entrance to a mine hung with guiding lights; it is another connection to the area&#x27;s mining past. Today the &quot;candles&quot; are often lit with electricity. The scenes cut from the wooden centre of the arch are not only on mining themes. At night during Advent, nearly every single window in Dresden is lit with these ornaments, traditionally bought at the Striezelmarkt.

* Räuchermann (smoking man)
:Another ornament always present at Christmas-time in Germany, the smoking man is hollowed out with a hole leading to his mouth, hung with a pipe. An incense candle is placed inside him so that he appears to smoke as it burns. Variations on the smoking man include old ladies in rocking chairs, Father Christmases, and figures representing nearly every occupation. Smoking men first appeared in the Striezelmarkt in the 19th century.

* Nutcrackers
:The type of nutcracker traditionally sold at the Striezelmarkt, carved and painted with a red coat like a soldier, probably became popular world-wide thanks to Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot; and related ballets. The first wood turner to carve the ornaments in this form, Wilhelm Friedrich Füchtner from the Ore Mountains, is said to have been inspired by the nutcracker in the story book Tchaikovsky drew from for his ballet.

==Food and drinks==
Apart from the famous &quot;Stollen&quot;, other specialities originate from Dresden and were originally sold at the Striezelmarkt.

* &quot;Pflaumentoffel&quot;
:Although they are made of prunes, these little figures are really decorations, although they can be eaten after Christmas. &quot;Pflaumentoffel&quot; means &quot;plum devil&quot;; (also called &quot;Feuerrüpel&quot; or &quot;Fiery Santa&quot;), although they are not meant to be devils or Santas, but chimney sweeps, all dressed in black (the prunes) with a top hat and a brush. Until the 20th century, &quot;Pflaumentoffel&quot; were sold at the Striezelmarkt on trays carried by children trying to earn some Christmas money. The artist Ludwig Richter famously portrayed these &quot;Striezelkinder&quot; in 1853 in his woodcut &quot;Ausverkauft wegen Geschäftsaufgabe&quot; (&quot;Sold out as giving up business&quot;). In 1910, however, sale by children was banned at the Striezelmarkt.

* &quot;Pulsnitzer Pfefferkuchen&quot; (Pulsnitz gingerbread)

:The Christmas market at Nuremberg (Christkindlmarkt) is more famous for its gingerbread known as Lebkuchen, but the Striezelmarkt&#x27;s gingerbread has nearly as long a history. &quot;Pfefferkuchen&quot; literally means &quot;pepper cake&quot;: the word &quot;pepper&quot; was used to mean any new foreign spice. The gingerbread sold at the Striezelmarkt comes from Pulsnitz, a town about 50 km from Dresden; it was first mentioned as a speciality from Pulsnitz in a decree issued in 1558 allowing bakers to produce it there. &quot;Pfefferkuchen&quot; are usually filled with marmalade or jam and covered with chocolate. Unlike gingerbread from other countries, the dough does not usually contain any fat, or indeed ginger, but instead nutmeg, cinnamon, ground cloves and allspice, which are added after the dough has been left up to 6 months to mature. In 1780 eight master bakers came personally from Pulsnitz to sell their wares at the Striezelmarkt; today there are many more Pfefferkuchen stands, but the gingerbread is usually sold by hired staff.

* &quot;Glühwein&quot; (mulled wine)

:One very well-loved tradition on a cold December night in Dresden is drinking steaming mugs of mulled wine at the Striezelmarkt. The hot red wine spiced with cloves and cinnamon is served in specially decorated mugs.

<text>Aurichalcite is a carbonate mineral, usually found as a secondary mineral in copper and zinc deposits. Its chemical formula is . The zinc to copper ratio is about 5:4. Copper (Cu2+) gives aurichalcite its green-blue colors.

==Occurrence==
Aurichalcite typically occurs in the oxidized zone of copper and zinc deposits.
Associated minerals include: rosasite, smithsonite, hemimorphite, hydrozincite, malachite and azurite.

It was first described in 1839 by Bottger who named the mineral for its zinc and copper content after the Greek &quot;όρειχαλκος&quot;, for &quot;mountain brass&quot; or &quot;mountain copper&quot;, the name of &quot;orichalcum&quot;, a fabulous metal, mentioned in the legend of the mythic lost continent Atlantis. The type locality is the Loktevskoye Mine, Upper Loktevka River, , Altai Krai, Western Siberia, Russia.

==Crystallography==
Aurichalcite displays prismatic crystals often in the form of encrustations and sometimes columnar structures. The crystal system is monoclinic.

<text>Truman Henry Safford (6 January 1836 – 13 June 1901) was an American calculating prodigy. In later life he was an observatory director.

==Biography==

Safford was born in Royalton, Vermont, on 6 January 1836. At an early age he attracted public attention by his remarkable calculation powers. At the age of nine, a local priest asked him to multiply 365,365,365,365,365,365 by itself. In less than a minute, Truman gave the correct answer of 133,491,850,208,566,925,016,658,299,941,583,225 with no paper. At around this age he also developed a new rule for calculating the moon&#x27;s risings and settings, taking one-quarter of the time of the existing method.

Unlike many other calculating prodigies, Safford did not give public exhibitions. He went to Harvard College where he studied astronomy. During his time at Harvard, he was part of the founding class of the Rho chapter of the Zeta Psi fraternity. He became the second director of the Hopkins Observatory at Williams College, the oldest extant astronomical observatory in the United States. Safford served as director of the Observatory until his death.

In 1894, Safford had a stroke. He died on 13 June 1901 at 112 Broad Street in Newark, New Jersey where he was living with his son.

==Legacy==

The Safford Fund for Williams College student researchers was created by his descendants to honor him. A portrait of him as a child prodigy hangs in the Hopkins Observatory&#x27;s Mehlin Museum of Astronomy, adjacent to the Milham Planetarium. His natural calculating abilities seemed to wane with age.

<doc id="875040" wikidata="Q407345" url="?curid=875040" title="Autunite">
<text>Autunite (hydrated calcium uranyl phosphate), with formula Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2·10–12H2O, is a yellow-greenish fluorescent phosphate mineral with a hardness of 2–. Autunite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system and often occurs as tabular square crystals, commonly in small crusts or in fan-like masses. Due to the moderate uranium content of 48.27% it is radioactive and also used as uranium ore. Autunite fluoresces bright green to lime green under UV light. The mineral is also called calco-uranite, but this name is rarely used and effectively outdated.

Autunite was discovered in 1852 near Autun, France, which is also autunite&#x27;s namesake. It occurs as an oxidation product of uranium minerals in granite pegmatites and hydrothermal deposits. Associate minerals include metaautunite, torbernite, phosphuranylite, saleeite, uranophane and sabugalite.

== Etymology ==
Autunite was named after the town of Autun, France, where the mineral was initially found. The mineral was named by Henry J. Brooke and William H. Miller in 1854. The archaic name &quot;calco-uranite&quot; pairs with the similarly composed mineral, torbernite, which was named &quot;cupro-uranite&quot;. Both minerals are named due to their uranium content, with autunite&#x27;s name referring to its calcium (&quot;calco&quot;), and torbernite&#x27;s copper (&quot;cupro&quot;) quantity.

== Locations and mining ==

=== Mount Kit Carson, Washington ===

Researchers found autunite inside the Daybreak Mine on Mount Kit Carson, Spokane, Washington (or sometimes referred to as &quot;near Mount Spokane&quot;), in &quot;vugs, fractures, and shear zones in granitic rock&quot;. These areas showed signs of another phosphate, apatite, which may have helped lead to the formation of autunite, by providing a source of phosphate and lime. The formation may have occurred with the interaction of uranium leached from a separate deposit.

90,000 lbs of U3O8 were produced from nine properties, although most of the ore came from the Daybreak Mine.

=== Other locations ===
One of the other locations of autunite includes Autun, France, the type locality and namesake of the mineral. The mineral was formed there as an alteration of uraninite and other uranium bearing minerals. Autunite is also found in Cornwall, Saxony, and North and South Dakota.

== Meta-autunite ==
If the mineral dries out, it can lose its water content and convert to meta-autunite-I, which can turn into meta-autunite-II after heating. These two subsequent minerals are very rare in nature. For scientific studies it is recommended to store the mineral in a sealed container to minimize the water loss. Museums are known to have covered the mineral with lacquer to avoid drying of the mineral.

<text>Brígido Lara (born 1939/40) is a Mexican artist and ex-forger of pre-Columbian antiques. Lara claims to have created perhaps as many as 40,000 pieces of forged pre-Columbian pottery.

Brígido Lara began to create forgeries in the 1950s and 1960s. He created many items in the style of the Mayans, Aztecs, and especially the lesser-known Totonacs — in fact, to such an extent that the majority of purported Totonac artifacts may actually be of his creation. He worked in a museum, where he was acquainted with both original artifacts and potential customers.

Lara sold his work as genuine Mexican antiquities; buyers did not ask many questions since they were buying contraband — taking antiquities out of Mexico is illegal. Some of the works were sold to the Morton D. May collection and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, dated AD 400–700 and attributed to the Remojadas culture in Veracruz. In 1971, the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History presented a large exhibition entitled &quot;Ancient Art of Veracruz.&quot; Lara later recognized many of the exhibits as his work.

In July 1974, Mexican police arrested a group of what appeared to be antique smugglers, with Brígido Lara among them. An antiquities expert declared Lara&#x27;s forgeries genuine. While serving his prison sentence, Lara requested fresh clay, and to prove his innocence, he created just the items he was accused of smuggling. The same antique expert declared them genuine as well. Lara was released in January 1975.

The Xalapa Museum of Anthropology later hired Lara as a restorer and to recognize forgeries.

In 1987, Brígido Lara told his story to two journalists from &quot;Connoisseur&quot; magazine. Through them, the St. Louis Art Museum heard that their Morton D. May collection contained his forgeries. The Dallas Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art also realized they had Lara forgeries in their collections, though they initially claimed that there was no proof. In 1999, he was featured in the documentary film &quot;Ruins,&quot; directed by Jesse Lerner. The film screened at the Sundance Film Festival and in many museums around the world, giving him further exposure.

Lara continues to sculpt in ancient styles but now signs his work and is a licensed maker of replicas. He calls his previous forgeries &quot;his originals&quot; or &quot;original interpretations&quot;.

<text>The University of Puerto Rico at Ponce (UPRP or UPR-Ponce) is a public college in Ponce, Puerto Rico. It is the only campus of the University of Puerto Rico on the southern region of the island.

==History==
The school opened on 23 August 1970 as Colegio Regional de Ponce de la Universidad de Puerto Rico (often shortened to Colegio Regional de Ponce). In 1982, the school starts offering four-year degrees and its name is changed Colegio Universitario Tecnológico de Ponce (CUTPO) to reflect this. 
In 1998 the school is given administrative independence from the University of Puerto Rico flagship school at Rio Piedras and its name is once again changed to become Colegio Universitario de Ponce. In 2000, in light of the expansion and diversity of the school academic offering, the &quot;Consejo de Educación Superior de Puerto Rico&quot; (Puerto Rico Higher Education Council) authorized a name change to Universidad de Puerto Rico en Ponce (University of Puerto Rico at Ponce).

In 2010 the campus went on strike as part of the 2010–2011 University of Puerto Rico strikes. In 2017 in response to budget cuts to the university system by the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico the campus students voted to join the University of Puerto Rico strikes, 2017.

==Academics==
The school offers associate degrees and bachelor degrees.

<doc id="875053" wikidata="Q463443" url="?curid=875053" title="American Ballet Theatre">
<text>American Ballet Theatre (ABT) is a classical ballet company based in New York City. Founded in 1939 by Lucia Chase and Richard Pleasant. Through 2019, it had an annual eight-week season at the Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center) in the spring and a shorter season at the David H. Koch Theater in the fall; the company tours around the world the rest of the year. The company was scheduled to have a 5-week spring season at the MET preceded by a 2-week season at the Koch Theater beginning in 2020. ABT is the parent company of the American Ballet Theatre Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School, and was recognized as &quot;America&#x27;s National Ballet Company&quot; in 2006 by the United States Congress.

== History ==
In 1939 Pleasant and Chase committed to the creation of &quot;a large scale company with an eclectic repertory&quot;. The pair and a small group from Mordkin Ballet formed Ballet Theatre. Their new company&#x27;s first performance was on 11 January 1940. Chase began developing the company&#x27;s repertoire of well-known full-length ballets, as well as original works, amidst financial issues. In 1945 Oliver Smith joined Ballet Theatre and became co-director with Chase.

In 1957 the company changed its name to American Ballet Theatre. It continued to emphasize ballet classics, yet remained challenged by financial issues. During the 1960s and 1970s, the company&#x27;s prospects brightened due to more favorable private funding. During this period, American Ballet Theatre shifted its ballet focus to the recruitment of star performers. In 1977, the company began its spring season at the Metropolitan Opera House, its new official venue.

Mikhail Baryshnikov in 1980 became artistic director for American Ballet Theatre. Baryshnikov staged, restaged, and refurbished numerous classical ballets and, according to the company, strengthened their classical tradition. Baryshnikov was replaced in 1989 by Jane Hermann and Oliver Smith, who remained as artistic directors until 1992, when Kevin McKenzie received the appointment. McKenzie satisfied the demands of the traditional ballet audience by prioritizing full-length narrative ballets. He also succeeded in keeping the company afloat during financially unstable times. In 2004 he established an official associate ballet school, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School. After a long period of no in-house choreographer, McKenzie appointed Alexei Ratmansky as &quot;Artist in Residence&quot; in January 2009.

McKenzie stepped down from the company in late 2022, as announced in 2021. Susan Jaffe took over the company at the end of 2022. Ratmansky departed the troupe in June 2023.

== Repertoire ==
Perhaps no other choreographer was as closely associated with ABT as the great British choreographer Antony Tudor, who made his American debut with the company. The other continuous creative force was the legendary Agnes de Mille. She staged the majority of her ballet works with them. Many choreographers have mounted works especially for ABT, including George Balanchine, Adolph Bolm, Michel Fokine, Léonide Massine, and Bronislava Nijinska. Other renowned choreographers who have worked at ABT include Jerome Robbins, Twyla Tharp, and Alvin Ailey.

ABT&#x27;s 1976 production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; starring Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gelsey Kirkland was televised the following year and has become a broadcast classic.

The main season is held during the spring at New York City&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera House, with shorter seasons in the fall previously held at New York City Center, now held at the David H. Koch Theater. Performances of Alexei Ratmansky&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; during the holiday season are held at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts. The company tours extensively throughout United States and the world.

== Schools and programs ==

=== Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School ===
The Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School at American Ballet Theatre (ABT/JKO School) is the associate school of American Ballet Theatre located within the Flatiron District of Manhattan, New York City. The school comprises a Children&#x27;s Division for ages 4 to 12, a Pre-Professional Division for ages 12 to 18, and the preparatory program Studio Company for ages 16 to 20. Cynthia Harvey, a former dancer with ABT, serves as the school&#x27;s artistic director.

=== Studio Company ===
ABT Studio Company, formerly known as ABT II, is a small company of 12 young dancers, ranging from ages 16 to 20, handpicked by ABT. It is the top level of the American Ballet Theatre training ladder and is currently an extension of the ABT JKO school. These dancers are trained in the program to join ABT&#x27;s main company or other leading professional companies, and the program is described by ABT as &quot;a bridge between ballet training and professional performance&quot;.

=== Project Plié ===
Project Plié is a diversity initiative launched in 2013 by Rachel Moore, who was then ABT&#x27;s executive director and CEO. Following her departure, the project was overseen by artistic director Kevin McKenzie and Mary Jo Ziesel, ABT director of education and training. The program was inspired by ABT principal dancer Misty Copeland, and aims to &quot;increase racial and ethnic representation in ballet and diversify America&#x27;s ballet companies&quot;. The initiative is made up of a combination of partnerships within the community and within the industry in addition to scholarships and opportunities for exposure for children of color. Annually, as of 2013, Project Plié has awarded scholarships to young people ranging from ages 9 to 18 including to the ABT/JKO School, ABT&#x27;s summer intensive programs and ABT&#x27;s Young Dancer Workshop.

<text>Raymond of Aguilers was a participant in and chronicler of the First Crusade (1096–1099). During the campaign he became the chaplain of Count Raymond IV of Toulouse, the leader of the Provençal army of crusaders. His chronicle, entitled &quot;Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem&quot;, which he co-wrote with Pons of Balazun, ends with the events immediately following the capture of Jerusalem in 1099.

==Biography==

Raymond was probably born second half of the 11th century in the vicinity of Toulouse. &quot;Aguilers&quot; is probably a reference to the village of Aiguilhe. Before the crusade, Raymond was a lay canon (deacon) of the cathedral of Le Puy. He probably travelled originally in the entourage of Bishop Adhemar of Le Puy, the papal legate. There is a purported charter of Bishop Adhemar that refers to his chancellor as Raymond of Aguilhes, but the existence of this charter and the identification of the chancellor and the canon are doubtful. Raymond was ordained a priest during the Siege of Antioch in 1098 and was made a chaplain to Count Raymond and thus a member of his household after the death of Raymond&#x27;s previous confessor, Bishop William of Orange. After the successful conquest of Jerusalem he was the likely author of the letter the crusaders wrote to Pope Urban II in 1099.

Raymond reports that he was among the first to believe Peter Bartholomew&#x27;s claim to have seen in a vision the location of the Holy Lance and that he participated in the digging that led to its discovery in the Church of Saint Peter. The authenticity of the Holy Lance and of Peter&#x27;s visions is a major theme of his work, although he admits that Peter did not unambiguously pass the ordeal by fire in April 1099. 

==Author of the Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem==

Everything we know about Raymond is derived from the &quot;Historia&quot;, the idea for which he credits to Pons. Raymond must have been the main author and finisher, however, since Pons died before the capture of Jerusalem. The &quot;Historia&quot; was probably started as the crusade progressed, possibly just after the discovery of the Holy Lance, and the preface added later. It was completed before the death of Count Raymond in 1105.

His account is partial to the Peasants&#x27; Crusade and takes a dim view of those who deserted or abandoned the expedition (and their vows). He had access to the &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot;, of which he made some use, and his &quot;Historia&quot; was used as a source by Fulcher of Chartres for the work he completed in 1101. He was further influenced by his time at the Le Puy Cathedral whose library, including the famous Le Puy Bible, was comparable to some of the best of the late tenth and early eleventh century. 

Compared to other authors of works on the First Crusade, Raymond has a preference for references to the Old instead of the New Testament, using twice as many as his fellow Provencal Peter Tudebode. There are references to several eschatological elements in his account such as the Olivet Discourse, the Last Emperor or Apocalypse of Daniel.

<text>The University of Puerto Rico at Utuado (UPRU or UPR-Utuado) is a public college in Utuado, Puerto Rico. Founded in 1979, it is the youngest of the campuses that compose the University of Puerto Rico system. UPR-Utuado is also known by its previous name &quot;Colegio Regional de la Montaña&quot; (Regional College of the Mountain) and its acronym &quot;CORMO&quot;.

The University of Puerto Rico at Utuado is the only university campus in Puerto Rico in a rural setting. The campus specializes in agricultural technological studies; it is located in the center of the island, about an hour and a half from San Juan, in a region of archaeological value where the first inhabitants of Puerto Rico, the Taino Indians, lived.

==History ==
In 2010 the campus went on strike as part of the 2010–2011 University of Puerto Rico strikes. In 2017 in response to budget cuts to the university system by the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico the campus students voted to join the University of Puerto Rico strikes, 2017.

Over a period of twelve years the campus student population has declined by 83% from 1,917 in 2010 to 331 in 2022.

==Academics==
UPRU awards associate&#x27;s degrees and bachelor&#x27;s degrees. Many of the academic programs also offer access to four baccalaureate programs by articulated transfer to other campuses of the University of Puerto Rico.

The college has established four study projects that promote integrated technical and human issues related to agriculture and rural life in the local and international environment. These are: Research and Documentation Center of Mountain Affairs, Project for Rural Life assessment, Contemporary Articulation Learning Communities, and Sustainability First Year Infrastructure. In 2017 the campus began a bachelor&#x27;s program in sustainable agriculture.

<text>Beinn Dearg is the fourth highest of the Torridon Hills in the highlands of Scotland. Beinn Dearg offers all the typical features of a Torridon hill, with steeply rocky sides dissected by near vertical gullies. The summit ridge is an airy crest that offers some easy scrambling; alternatively this can be avoided by following a path that traverses the terraces on the southern side.

Unlike its higher neighbours, the hill just misses out on the height of 3,000 ft, and therefore lacks any peaks of Munro status. For this reason, if no other, it is climbed far less than the three major mountains surrounding it. In 2007, the Munro Society commissioned CMCR Ltd to survey Beinn Dearg in order to ascertain the precise height of the summit, and determine whether it might in fact be correctly categorised as a Munro. The summit was found to be 2.42 ft short.

==Ascent==
The most normal starting point for climbing Beinn Dearg is the car park at the foot of the Abhainn Coire Mhic Nobuil, which is also the normal start point for an ascent of Beinn Alligin. From here the river is followed until the confluence with the Allt à Bhealaich. This burn may be followed up to the low bealach or saddle between Beinn Dearg and Beinn Alligin, at which point the walker can strike upwards for the western end of the summit ridge.

Alternative routes of ascent may be made by continuing to follow the Abhainn Coire Mhic Nobuil under the south side of the hill. Two gullies offer routes to the summit ridge, either side of the subsidiary peak of Carn na Feòla at the eastern end of the 4 km long ridge. By combining two of the three routes described above one may complete a traverse of Beinn Dearg.

The summit offers excellent views of the well known surrounding peaks of Torridon.

<text>Hwair (also , , ) is the name of , the Gothic letter expressing the or sound (reflected in English by the inverted &quot;wh&quot;-spelling for ). Hwair is also the name of the Latin ligature (capital ) used to transcribe Gothic.

==Name==
The name of the Gothic letter is recorded by Alcuin in Codex Vindobonensis 795 as &quot;uuaer&quot;. The meaning of the name &#x27; was probably &quot;cauldron, pot&quot;
(cf. &#x27; &quot;skull&quot;); comparative reconstruction shows &quot;*kʷer&quot;- (“a kind of dish or pot”) in Proto-Indo-European.

There was no Elder Futhark rune for the phoneme, so that unlike those of most Gothic letters, the name does not continue the name of a rune (but see &quot;qairþra&quot;).

==Sound==
Gothic &#x27; is the reflex of Common Germanic &#x27;, which in turn continues the Indo-European labiovelar &quot;*&quot; after it underwent Grimm&#x27;s law. The same phoneme in Old English and Old High German is spelled &quot;hw&quot;.

==Transliteration==
The Gothic letter is transliterated with the Latin ligature of the same name, , which was introduced by Wilhelm Braune in the 1882 edition of &quot;&quot;, as suggested in a review of the 1880 edition by Hermann Collitz, to replace the digraph &quot;hv&quot; which was formerly used to express the phoneme, e.g. by Migne (vol. 18) in the 1860s. It is used, for example, in Dania transcription. It was also used to represent the voiceless labial–velar fricative in a 1921 edition of the International Phonetic Alphabet.

<text>Over the centuries of Islamic history, Muslim rulers, Islamic scholars, and ordinary Muslims have held many different attitudes towards other religions. Attitudes have varied according to time, place and circumstance.

==Al-Baqara 256==
== Non-Muslims and Islam ==
The Qur&#x27;an distinguishes between the monotheistic People of the Book (), i.e. Jews, Christians, Sabians and others on the one hand and polytheists or idolaters on the other hand. There are certain kinds of restrictions that apply to polytheists but not to &quot;People of the Book&quot; in classical Islamic law. One example is that Muslim males are allowed to marry a Christian or Jew, but not a polytheist. Muslim women, however, may not marry non-Muslim men.

The Quran told Muslims to discuss the common points between Muslims and non-Muslims. It directs Muslims not to fight with people of the Book.

The idea of Islamic infallibility is encapsulated in the formula, &quot;Islam is exalted and nothing is exalted above it.&quot;

Abraham, Moses, Hebrew prophets, and Jesus were all prophets of Islam, but according to Muslim tradition their message and the texts of the Torah and the Gospels were corrupted.

Apostasy in Islam can be punishable by death and/or imprisonment according to some interpretations but they are only found in hadiths and there is nothing in the Quran that commands death penalty for apostate so the issue of apostasy is controversial. W. Heffening states that Shafi&#x27;is interpret verse as adducing the main evidence for the death penalty in Qur&#x27;an. Wael Hallaq states the death penalty was a new element added later and &quot;reflects a later reality and does not stand in accord with the deeds of the Prophet.&quot; He further states that &quot;nothing in the law governing apostate and apostasy derives from the letter of the holy text.&quot; There are also interpretations according to which apostates are not executed nor punished, and there is freedom of religion.

In the 7th century text &quot;Concerning Heresy&quot;, the Christian scholar John of Damascus named Islam as Christological heresy, referring to it as the &quot;heresy of the Ishmaelites&quot;. The position has remained popular in Christian circles well into the 20th century, by theologians such as the Congregationalist cleric Frank Hugh Foster and the Roman Catholic historian Hilaire Belloc, the latter of who described it as &quot;the great and enduring heresy of Mohammed.&quot;

== Early Muslim practice ==
During the thirteen years that Muhammad led his followers against Mecca and then against the other Arab tribes, Christian and Jewish communities who had submitted to Muslim rule were allowed to worship in their own way and follow their own family law, and were given a degree of self-government.

However, the non-Muslim were subject to taxation (known as ) at a different rate to the Muslim . also faced economic impediments, restrictions on political participation and/or social advancement based on their non-Muslim status.

Some Jews generally rejected Muhammad&#x27;s status as a prophet. According to Watt, &quot;Jews would normally be unwilling to admit that a non-Jew could be a prophet.&quot; In the Constitution of Medina, Muhammad demanded the Jews&#x27; political loyalty in return for religious and cultural autonomy. In every major battle with the Medinans, two local Jewish tribes were found to be treacherous (see ). After Badr and Uhud, the Banu Qainuqa and Banu Nadir (the latter being an ethnic Arab tribe who converted to Judaism, according to the Muslim historian al-Yaqubi), respectively, took up arms against the ummah and were subsequently expelled &quot;with their families and possessions&quot; from Medina.

However, this incident does not imply that Jews in general rejected Muhammad&#x27;s constitution. One Yemenite Jewish document, found in the Cairo Genizah, claims that many Jews had not only accepted Muhammad as a prophet, but even desecrated Sabbath in order to join Muhammad in his struggle; historians suggest that this document, called (Muhammad&#x27;s Writ of Protection), may have been fabricated by Yemenite Jews for the purpose of self-defence. Still, some Yemeni Jews considered Muhammad a true prophet, including Natan&#x27;el al-Fayyumi, a major 12th century rabbi who incorporated various Shia doctrines into his view of Judaism.

The Syriac Patriarch Ishôyahb III wrote in his correspondence to Simeon of Rewardashir, &quot;As for the Arabs, to whom God has at this time given rule (shultãnâ) over the world, you know well how they act toward us. Not only do they not oppose Christianity, but they praise our faith, honour the priests and saints of our Lord, and give aid to the churches and monasteries.&quot;

After Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632, Islamic rule grew rapidly, encompassing what is now the Middle East, Egypt, North Africa, and Iran. Most of the new subjects were Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian, the first two being considered People of the Book. (After some argument, the Zoroastrians were considered People of the Book as well.) Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians were called , protected persons. As noted above, they could worship, follow their own family law, and own property. People of the Book were not subject to certain Islamic rules, such as the prohibitions on alcohol and pork, but were subject to other restrictions. Under the Islamic state, they were exempt from military service, but were required to pay a poll tax known as . (They were, however, exempt from the required of Muslims.) They could be bureaucrats and advisors, but they could never be rulers.

== Later Islamic practices ==
Under the Ummayads and Abbasids, the Islamic community was increasingly fragmented into various sects and kingdoms, each of which had its own evolving policy towards and towards conquered polytheists.

===Later Islamic conquests===
From historical evidence, it appears Tokharistan was the only area of Iran heavily colonized by Arabs, where Buddhism flourished when they arrived and the only area incorporated into the Arab empire where Sanskrit studies were pursued up to the conquest. The grandson of Barmak was the &quot;vizier&quot; of the empire and took personal interest in Sanskrit works and Indian religions. When the Barmakids were removed from power and their influence disappeared, no further translations of Sanskrit works into Arabic is known until that of Al-Biruni.

With the Ghaznavids and later the Mughals, Islam also expanded further into northern India. Will Durant, in &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot;, described this as &quot;probably the bloodiest story in history.&quot; This approach was not uniform, and different rulers adopted different strategies. The Ghurid dynasty converted to Sunni Islam from Buddhism after the conquest of Ghor by the Ghaznavid ruler Mahmud of Ghazni in 1011. The Mughal emperor Akbar, for example, was relatively tolerant towards Hindus, while his great-grandson Aurangzeb was heavily intolerant. Hindus were ultimately given the tolerated religious minority status of .

The Buddhists of India were not as fortunate; although Buddhism had been in decline prior to the Muslim invasions, the destruction of monastic universities in the invasions such as Nalanda and Vikramashila were a calamity from which it never recovered. According to one Buddhist scholar, the monasteries were destroyed because they were large, fortified edifices considered threats by Muslim Turk invaders.

The Almohad rulers of Muslim Spain were initially intolerant, and engaged in forced conversions; Maimonides, for example, was forced to masquerade as a Muslim and eventually flee Spain after the initial Almohad conquest.

===Comparative religion and anthropology of religion===
After the Arab conquest of the Buddhist center of Balkh, a Quranic commentator was denounced for anthropomorphism, a standard attack on those sympathetic to Buddhism. Hiwi al-Balkhi had attacked the authority of Quran and revealed religions, reciting the claims of Zoroastrianism, Christianity and Judaism.

In the early 11th century, the Islamic scholar Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī wrote detailed comparative studies on the anthropology of religions across the Middle East, Mediterranean and especially the Indian subcontinent. Biruni&#x27;s anthropology of religion was only possible for a scholar deeply immersed in the lore of other nations. He carried out extensive, personal investigations of the peoples, customs, and religions of the Indian subcontinent, and was a pioneer in comparative religion and the anthropology of religion.

According to Arthur Jeffery, &quot;It is rare until modern times to find so fair and unprejudiced a statement of the views of other religions, so earnest an attempt to study them in the best sources, and such care to find a method which for this branch of study would be both rigorous and just.&quot; Biruni compared Islam with pre-Islamic religions, and was willing to accept certain elements of pre-Islamic wisdom which would conform with his understanding of the Islamic spirit.

In the introduction to his &quot;Indica&quot;, Biruni himself writes that his intent behind the work was to engage dialogue between Islam and the Indian religions, particularly Hinduism as well as Buddhism. Biruni was aware that statements about a religion would be open to criticism by its adherents, and insisted that a scholar should follow the requirements of a strictly scientific method. According to William Montgomery Watt, Biruni &quot;is admirably objective and unprejudiced in his presentation of facts&quot; but &quot;selects facts in such a way that he makes a strong case for holding that there is a certain unity in the religious experience of the peoples he considers, even though he does not appear to formulate this view explicitly.&quot; Biruni argued that Hinduism was a monotheistic faith like Islam, and in order to justify this assertion, he quotes Hindu texts and argues that the worship of idols is &quot;exclusively a characteristic of the common people, with which the educated have nothing to do.&quot;

Biruni argued that the worship of idols &quot;is due to a kind of confusion or corruption.&quot; According to Watt, Biruni &quot;goes on to maintain that in the course of generations the origin of the veneration of the images is forgotten, and further that the ancient legislators, seeing that the Veneration of images is advantageous, made it obligatory for the ordinary. He mentions the view of some people that, before God sent prophets, all mankind were idol-worshippers, but he apparently does not presumably held that, apart from the messages transmitted by prophets, men could know the existence and unity of God by rational methods of philosophy.&quot; Biruni argued that &quot;the Hindus, no less than the Greeks, have philosophers who are believers in monotheism.&quot; Al-Biruni also compared Islam and Christianity, citing passages from the Qur&#x27;an and Bible which state that their followers should always speak the truth.

== Contemporary Islam ==
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, most Islamic states fell under the sway of European colonialists. The colonialists enforced tolerance, especially of European Christian missionaries. After World War II, there was a general retreat from colonialism, and predominantly Muslim countries were again able to set their own policies regarding non-Muslims. This period also saw the beginning of increased migration from Muslim countries into the First World countries of Europe, the UK, Canada, the US, etc. This has completely reshaped relations between Islam and other religions.
===In predominantly Muslim countries===
Some predominantly Muslim countries allow the practice of all religions. Of these, some limit this freedom with bans on proselytizing or conversion, or restrictions on the building of places of worship; others (such as Mali) have no such restrictions. In practice, the situation of non-Muslim minorities depends not only on the law, but on local practices, which may vary.

Some countries are predominantly Muslim and allow freedom of religion adhering to democratic principles. Of particular note are the following countries:
*Indonesia and Malaysia have a significant population from the Hindu, Christian and Buddhist religions. They are allowed to practice their religions, build places of worship and even have missionary schools and organizations but with limitation of such practice. 
*In Syria, there are about 2.2 million Christians (10–12% of the population) from about 15 different religious and ethnic sects (Greek Orthodox, Syrian Orthodox, Church of the East, Protestants, Armenians Apostolic and various Catholics, Greek, Syrian, Aremenian, Chaldean, Maronite, Latin), as well as a few dozen Jews, and they have many hundreds of independent privately owned churches and some 15 synagogues. The freedom of religion is well observed by the state law as well as the historical long record of tolerance since the Ummayde caliph days. Christmas and Easter days are official holidays for both the Catholic or Orthodox calendar.
* Pakistan has different electorates for Muslims and non-Muslims, and also two chief justices of Supreme Court of Pakistan were Hindu and Christian after the formation of the country.

Other Islamic nations are not so tolerant of minority religions:

* Saudi Arabia limits religious freedom to a high degree, prohibiting public worship by other religions.
* The Taliban regime in Afghanistan is considered intolerant by many observers. Some ancient Buddhist monuments, like the Buddhas of Bamyan, were destroyed as idolatrous.
* The constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran recognizes Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism as &quot;People of the Book&quot; and official religions, and they are granted the right to exercise religious freedom in Iran. Five of the 270 seats in parliament are reserved for these three religions. However, the situation of the followers of the Bahá&#x27;í Faith, the largest religious minority in the country, is far worse. State sanctioned persecution of Bahá&#x27;ís allows them to be attacked and dehumanized on political, religious, and social grounds to separate Bahá&#x27;ís from the rest of society. According to Eliz Sanasarian &quot;Of all non-Muslim religious minorities the persecution of the Bahá&#x27;ís has been the most widespread, systematic, and uninterrupted.&quot; See Religion in Iran and Persecution of Bahá&#x27;ís. Also, senior government posts are reserved for Muslims. All minority religious groups, are barred from being elected president. Jewish, Christian and Zoroastrian schools must be run by Muslim principals. Compensation for death paid to the family of a non-Muslim was (by law) less than if the victim was a Muslim. Conversion to Islam is encouraged by entitling converts to inherit the entire share of their parents (or even uncle&#x27;s) estate if their siblings (or cousins) remain non-Muslim. Iran&#x27;s non-Muslim population has fallen dramatically. For example, the Jewish population in Iran dropped from 80,000 to 30,000 in the first two decades of the revolution.
* In Egypt, a 16 December 2006 judgement of the Supreme Administrative Council created a clear demarcation between &quot;recognized religions&quot;—Islam, Christianity and Judaism—and all other religious beliefs; the ruling effectively delegitimatizes and forbids the practice of all but these aforementioned religions. The ruling leaves members of other religious communities, including Bahá&#x27;ís, without the ability to obtain the necessary government documents to have rights in their country, essentially denying them of all rights of citizenship. They cannot obtain ID cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, and passports; they also cannot be employed, educated, treated in public hospitals or vote among other things. See Egyptian identification card controversy.

According to Islamic law, (poll tax) is to be paid by all non-Muslims living in a Muslim state, excluding the weak and the poor, to the general welfare of the state. Also, in his book &quot;Al-Kharaj,&quot; Abu Yusuf says, &quot;No is due on females or young infants.&quot; In exchange for the tax, the non-Muslims are required to be given security, provided compensation from the Muslim Exchequer when they are in need, treated on equality with Muslims, and enjoy rights as nationals of the state. Al-Balathiri comments on this saying, &quot;Khaled Ibn Al-Walid, on entering Damascus as a conqueror, offered a guarantee of security to its people and their properties and churches, and promised that the wall of the city would not be pulled down, and none of their houses be demolished. It was a guarantee of God, he said, and of the Caliph and all believers to keep them safe and secure on condition they paid the dues of the .&quot; This poll tax is different from the alms tax () paid by the Muslim subjects of a Muslim state. Whereas is compulsory and paid by the tolerated community per head count, was paid only if one can afford it. Muslims and non-Muslims who hold property, especially land, were required however to pay .

===Territorial disputes===

One of the open issues in the relation between Islamic states and non-Islamic states is the claim from hardline Muslims that once a certain land, state or territory has been under &quot;Muslim&quot; rule, it can never be relinquished anymore, and that such rule, somewhere in history would give the Muslims a kind of an eternal right on the claimed territory. This claim is particularly controversial with regard to Israel and to a lesser degree Spain and parts of the Balkan and it applies to parts of Kashmir as well.

== Islamic views on religious pluralism ==

Reference to Islamic views on religious pluralism is found in the Quran. The following verses are generally interpreted as an evidence of religious pluralism:

Surah Al-Ma&#x27;idah verse 48 states:

Surah Al-Ankabut verse 46 states:

The Quran criticizes Christians and Jews who believed that their own religions are the only source of truth:

Surah Al-Baqara verse 113 states:

Many Muslims agree that cooperation with the Christian and Jewish community is important but some Muslims believe that theological debate is often unnecessary:

Islam&#x27;s fundamental theological concept is the belief in one God. Muslims are not expected to visualize God but to worship and adore him as a protector. Any kind of idolatry is condemned in Islam. () As a result, Muslims hold that for someone to worship any other gods or deities other than Allah ( (polytheism)) is a sin that will lead to separation from Allah.

Muslims believe that Allah sent the Qur&#x27;an to bring peace and harmony to humanity through Islam (submission to Allah). Muhammad&#x27;s worldwide mission was to establish universal peace under the . The ensured security of the lives and property of non-Muslims under the system. This status was originally only made available to non-Muslims who were &quot;People of the Book&quot; (Christians, Jews, and Sabians (commonly identified with the Mandaeans)), but was later extended to include Zoroastrians, Sikhs, Hindus, and Buddhists.
 had more rights than other non-Muslim religious subjects, but often fewer legal and social rights than Muslims. Some Muslims, however, disagree, and hold that adherents of these faiths cannot be .

 enjoyed some freedoms under the state founded by Muhammad and could practice their religious rituals according to their faith and beliefs. Non-Muslims who were not classified as &quot;people of the book,&quot; for example practitioners of the pre-Muslim indigenous Arabian religions, had few or no rights in Muslim society.

Muslims and Muslim theologians attend at many interfaith dialogues, for example at the Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions with whom in 1993 also Muslim theologians signed the Declaration Toward a Global Ethic.
Religious persecution is also prohibited, although religious persecution in Muslim majority states has occurred, especially during periods of cruel rulers and general economic hardships. Pre-Islamic religious minorities continue to exist in some of their native countries, although only as marginal percentages of the overall population.

Over the centuries, several known religious debates, and polemical works did exist in various Muslim countries between various Muslim sects, as well as between Muslims and non-Muslims. Many of these works survive today, and make for some very interesting reading in the apologetics genre. Only when such debates spilled over to the unlearned masses, and thus causing scandals and civil strife, did rulers intervene to restore order and pacify the public outcry on the perceived attack on their beliefs.

As for sects within Islam, history shows a variable pattern. Various sects became intolerant when gaining favour with the rulers, and often work to oppress or eliminate rival sects, for example, the contemporary persecution of Muslim minorities in Saudi Arabia. Sectarian strife between Shia and Sunni inhabitants of Baghdad is well known through history.

===Views on forms of worship in other religions===
The 14th century Sufi saint Abd al-Karim al-Jili stated that all principal religions actually worship Allah in their own way:

# The Infidels; they disbelieve in a lord, because they worship the essence of God which reflects there is no lord over him.
# The Physicists; worshipping the natural properties, which are actually attributes of God.
# The Philosophers; worshipping the seven planets, which represents further names of God.
# The Dualists; worshipping God as the Creator and the One.
# The Magians; worship God in the names of Unity in which all names and attributes past just as fire destroys and transmutes them in their nature.
# The Materialists; denying a creator and instead believe in the eternity of Time. Thus they just believe in his He-ness, in which God is just potentially but not actually creative.
# The Jews.
# The Sabians (Mandaeans).
# The Christians.
# The Muslims.

Although there are different ways to worship God, those who do not worship like it was ordinated by a prophet will suffer in the afterlife. This suffering causes pleasure, because they feel spiritual delight in the way of their worship until they repent and take refuge in God.

The Sunni scholar and mystic Mahmoud Shabestari holds that every religion is in some way worshipping Allah. Even idol-worshippers actually would unconsciously worship him, but they do not recognise, that in reality, there is no other entity than Allah to worship, thus unnecessarily limiting him.

== Forced conversion ==
The Quran Al-Baqara 256 says &quot;Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error&quot; ( and ).

Quranic translator M. A. S. Abdel Haleem wrote of the Sword Verse, verse 9:5 of At-Tawba 5: &quot;In this context, this definitely refers to the ones who broke the treaty&quot; between Muslims and a group of idolaters during the time of Muhammad. According to Sahih Al-Bukhari although clear orders were given to kill everyone who broke the treaty, Muhammad made a second treaty before entering Mecca and spared even Amar who was responsible for his daughter Rukayya&#x27;s death and the person who killed his uncle Hamza.

According to historian Bernard Lewis, forced conversions played a role especially in the 12th century under the Almohad dynasty of North Africa and Andalusia. He is also of the opinion that other incidents of forced conversions have been rare in Islamic history. He adds that &quot;In the early centuries of Islamic rule there was little or no attempt at forcible conversion, the spread of the faith being effected rather by persuasion and inducement.&quot; A few well-known examples of forced conversion are:
* Anusim of Meshhad, Jewish community forced on pain of death to convert in 1839 under Qajar rule. Most continued Jewish practices in secret and many of their descendants returned to Judaism in the early 20th century.
* Francis Bok—Sudanese-American activist, from Christianity; later returned to his Christian faith.
* Steve Centanni and Olaf Wiig—forced to convert at gunpoint by terrorists of the Holy Jihad Brigades.
* Sabbatai Zevi—convert from Judaism, 17th century mystic, pseudo-Messiah and the self-proclaimed &quot;King of Jews.&quot; Converted ostensibly of his own free will, while in prison. Although, some speculate that he may have been executed for treason had he not converted. Muslim authorities were opposed to his death.

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in [[Belgium]]. Liberalism was a dominant force since the Belgian independence from the Netherlands. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

==History==
Since 1972 the traditional liberal current is divided in parties for each language. In Flanders the liberal Flemish Liberals and Democrats (&quot;Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten&quot;, member LI, ELDR), comprising both market and left of center liberals, is one of the dominant parties. Smaller liberal parties are Spirit, allied with the social democrats, and Vivant, allied to the VLD. In the French-speaking part of the country the nowadays center liberal Reformist Movement (&quot;Mouvement Réformateur&quot;, member LI, ELDR) is one of the major parties. Affiliated with this party is the German-speaking Party for Freedom and Progress (&quot;Partei für Freiheit und Fortschritt&quot;).

<doc id="875094" wikidata="Q275408" url="?curid=875094" title="Henry of Bohemia">
<text>Henry of Gorizia (, ; – 2 April 1335), a member of the House of Gorizia, was Duke of Carinthia and Landgrave of Carniola (as Henry VI) and Count of Tyrol from 1295 until his death, as well as King of Bohemia, Margrave of Moravia and titular King of Poland in 1306 and again from 1307 until 1310. After his death, the Habsburgs took over Carinthia and Carniola and held them almost without interruption until 1918.

==Life==

Henry was a younger son of Count Meinhard II of Görz-Tyrol and Elizabeth of Bavaria, widow of King Conrad IV of Germany. Upon the partition of the Meinhardiner estates in 1271, his father maintained the Tyrolean lands, while Henry&#x27;s uncle Albert received the County of Gorizia. In 1276 Count Meinhard married his eldest daughter, Henry&#x27;s sister Elizabeth, to Albert, son of King Rudolph I of Germany, and in turn was enfeoffed with the Duchy of Carinthia in 1286.

After his father&#x27;s death in late October 1295, Henry inherited the Tyrolean and Carinthian estates. At first, he ruled jointly with his brothers Otto (d. 1310) and Louis (d. 1305), until he outlived them. He secured his position by supporting his brother-in-law Albert I of Habsburg, who thereby was able to defeat rivalling Adolf of Nassau at the 1298 Battle of Göllheim and was elected King of the Romans in the same year. He also helped King Albert and his Wittelsbach ally Louis IV to lay siege against Louis&#x27; revolting brother Rudolf I of the Palatinate at his Heidelberg residence in 1301.

===King of Bohemia===
Tensions with the House of Habsburg arose when Henry married the Přemyslid princess Anne, the elder sister of King Wenceslaus III of Bohemia, in 1306. In the same year, the Bohemian ruler prepared for a military campaign against Poland and appointed his brother-in-law regent. Upon Wenceslaus&#x27; assassination on 4 August, the Přemyslids became extinct in the male line and Henry was elected his successor by the Bohemian nobility—against the will of his former ally King Albert I of Germany, who intended to install his eldest son Rudolf of Habsburg on the Bohemian throne.

King Albert&#x27;s troops invaded Bohemia, besieged Prague Castle and deposed Henry, who had to yield to their superior forces. Nevertheless, Rudolf of Habsburg (mocked as &quot;král kaše&quot;, &quot;King Porridge&quot;) was never accepted by the Bohemian nobles, and after his sudden death on 4 July 1307, Henry was re-elected King of Bohemia on 15 August. Another attack by King Albert was repelled, and the Habsburg threat was finally ended with Albert&#x27;s assassination by his nephew John in 1308.

Although Henry was now one of the most powerful rulers in the Holy Roman Empire, his reign marked a period of instability in Bohemia. He was considered weak and wasteful by the Bohemian nobility, who began to look for a more capable successor. Meanwhile, the new German king Henry VII, a member of the House of Luxembourg, had also cast a covetous eye on the Bohemian kingdom. In 1310, Henry VII arranged the marriage of his eldest son John with Elizabeth, the younger sister of the late King Wenceslaus II.

Backed by local nobles and his father, John&#x27;s troops invaded Bohemia in October of 1310. He captured Prague on 3 December and deposed Henry for the second time. The German king seized the Bohemian fief and ceded it to his son John, who was crowned king the next year. Henry was forced to retire to Carinthia, where his wife Anna died without children in 1313.

===Retirement===
Henry managed to retain Carinthia and Tyrol through reconciliation with the Habsburgs, ceding the March on the Sann (Savinja Valley in today Slovenia) to the Habsburg Duchy of Styria. He also kept &quot;de facto&quot; control over Carniola. He nevertheless was not able to acquire the Carinthian estates that were held by the prince-bishops of Bamberg with the consent of Emperor Henry VII. Centred in a compact territory between Villach and Tarvis, these possessions enjoyed the status of a virtually sovereign principality, and had a crucial geostrategic position on the only major route from Carinthia to Friuli and Italy. On the other hand, Henry could reinforce his overlordship in Tyrol against the resistance of the Trent and Brixen prince-bishops.

Despite his deposition, Henry continued to claim the title of king of Bohemia and the accompanying electoral dignity, voting for Habsburg candidate Frederick the Fair during the 1314 double election of the Holy Roman Emperor at Frankfurt. His contested right to vote was one of the reasons for the ambiguous result, as Henry&#x27;s rival, the Luxembourg king John, gave his Bohemian vote to Louis IV of Bavaria. After Louis&#x27; victory in the 1322 Battle of Mühldorf, Henry helped to arrange an amicable settlement between the competitors.

Henry also reconciled with the Luxembourgs and in 1330 married his daughter Margaret off to King John&#x27;s son John Henry. Since he was the last male heir of the Tyrolean branch of the Meinhardiner dynasty, he attempted to maintain their possessions, but ultimately failed. Even though Emperor Louis IV, in return for Henry&#x27;s mediation in the dispute with Frederick the Fair, had assured him in 1330 that his daughter could succeed him, Louis reneged on his promise in a secret treaty with the House of Habsburg in the same year. 

After Henry&#x27;s death in 1335, the Habsburg duke Albert II of Austria and his brother Otto took control of Carinthia and Carniola. Henry&#x27;s daughter Margaret could only succeed him in Tyrol with the support of the local nobles; however, in 1363 she ultimately had to bequeath her lands to Albert&#x27;s II son Duke Rudolf IV of Austria as well. The Gorizia branch of the Meinhardiner dynasty ruled their county until the extinction of the line in 1500, after which the estates likewise fell to the Habsburgs.

==Marriage and issue==
Henry was married three times:

In 1306, he married Anna Přemyslovna (1290–1313). This marriage produced no children.

In 1313, he wed Adelaide of Brunswick (1285 – 16 August 1324), daughter of the Welf duke Henry I of Brunswick-Grubenhagen. This marriage produced two daughters:
# Adelaide (1317–25 May 1325).
# Margaret &quot;Maultasch&quot; (1318 – 3 October 1369, Vienna), Countess of Tyrol from 1335 to 1363.

In 1327, he married Beatrice (1310–1331), daughter of Count Amadeus V of Savoy. This marriage produced no children.

<doc id="875098" wikidata="Q2496484" url="?curid=875098" title="Univocalic">
<text>A univocalic is a type of antilipogrammatic constrained writing that uses only consonants and a single vowel, in English &quot;A&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, or &quot;U&quot;, and no others.

==Examples==
*One of the best-known univocalic poems was written by C.C. Bombaugh in 1890 using &quot;O&quot;. Bombaugh&#x27;s work is still in print. An example couplet:
::No cool monsoons blow soft on Oxford dons,
::Orthodox, jog-trot, book-worm Solomons
*The Austrian poet Ernst Jandl composed his univocalic poem &quot;ottos mops&quot; (&quot;Otto&#x27;s Pug&quot;) from German words with only the vowel &quot;O&quot;.
*A contemporary example of English-language univocalic poems is Canadian poet Christian Bök&#x27;s text &quot;Eunoia&quot;, published by Coach House Press in 2001. Each chapter is restricted to a single vowel, missing four of the five vowels. For example the fourth chapter contains only &quot;O&quot;. A typical sentence from this chapter is &quot;Profs from Oxford show frosh who do post-docs how to gloss works of Wordsworth.&quot;
*An example of a univocalic novella is Georges Perec&#x27;s &quot;Les Revenentes&quot; (sic), in which the vowel &quot;E&quot; is used exclusively. The sentence &quot;Je cherche en même temps l&#x27;éternel et l&#x27;éphémère&quot; (which means &quot;I seek the eternal and the ephemeral at the same time&quot;) from this book has appeared as the epigraph for the last chapter of &quot;Life: A User&#x27;s Manual&quot;. &quot;Les Revenentes&quot; has also been translated into English, titled &quot;The Exeter Text: Jewels, Secrets, Sex&quot; (included in the collection &quot;Three&quot; by Ian Monk), also using the vowel &quot;E&quot; exclusively.
* Georges Perec has also written a univocalic in A (&quot;What a man !&quot;) and one in O (&quot;Morton&#x27;s ob&quot;).
* Höpöhöpö Böks by Icelandic poet Eiríkur Örn Norðdahl is a univocal lipogram using only the vowel Ö. It is composed as a tribute to Christian Bök&#x27;s Eunoia.
* &quot;Eszperente&quot; is a univocalic form of Hungarian in which no vowels can be used other than &quot;E&quot;. This task is eased somewhat as &quot;E&quot; is a common vowel in Hungarian. In fact the letter &quot;e&quot; can denote two similar but distinct vowels. There are poems and even some books written in Eszperente, mostly for children.
* Argentinean folk singer Leon Gieco released a novelty song in 1997 called &quot;Ojo con los Orozco&quot; (&quot;Be Aware of the Orozco Brothers&quot;); only the vowel O is featured in the song&#x27;s lyrics; no other vowels are used. Its describes the personalities and proclivities of eight fictional corrupt politicians, all brothers within the same family. The rap song is in Spanish, with a heavy dose of Lunfardo, some English words, and a few pop culture references (among others, Don Johnson, Bon Scott, John Lennon and Yoko Ono are mentioned). The song&#x27;s video makes heavy use of surrealistic images.
* Cornish poet Trelawney wrote the univocalic piece, Wych Nymph, in Y.
* &quot;Ioueay Oiseaux - Hoʻoponopono&quot; is a 300-line univocalic poem in O (using &quot;Y&quot; exclusively when it&#x27;s phonetically a consonant) written by an anonymous writer Satisfire. An extract from the work, being a univocalic reinterpretation of the Ten Commandments:
::«10 most common protocols of God: 1. God controls world solo; 2. Do not concoct own dolls, nor do bow to wrong gods of gold; 3. God’s honor’s worth lot, do not mock God; 4. Yom of God’s yom of God, son; 5. Honor own mom, mom’s consort too; 6. Do not knock off folks; 7. Do not bonk wrong nooks; 8. Do not prowl on folks’ lot; 9. Do not concoct bollocks; 10. Hold off for good from good folks’ lot or consorts.»
* dolphin.town is a social media service using Mastodon (software) on which users can only post status updates using only the letter &quot;E&quot;. Darius Kazemi, the maintainer of the site, created a bot which &quot;Posts all the E&#x27;s in Moby Dick&quot;.

<text>Mackay () is a city in the Mackay Region on the eastern or Coral Sea coast of Queensland, Australia. It is located about north of Brisbane, on the Pioneer River. Mackay is described as being in either Central Queensland or North Queensland, as these regions are not precisely defined. More generally, the area is known as the Mackay–Whitsunday Region. Nicknames of Mackay include the Sugar capital, Alexandra and Macktown. The demonym of Mackay residents is Mackayites.

Founded in 1862 the settlement was originally known as Alexandra, in honour of Princess Alexandra of Denmark, and was later renamed Mackay after John Mackay. Sugar became the economic foundation of the city, with plantations using South Sea Islanders that had been blackbirded as indentured labourers or slaves. The trades ending in 1904 roughly coincided with the immigration of Mediterranean migrants from Italy and Malta beginning in 1891 to work the sugarcane plantations, and by the 1930s one third of Australia’s Italian migrants lived in North Queensland. The city was nearly destroyed in the 1918 cyclone, and the following reconstruction used primarily Art Deco and Spanish Mission architectural styles for which the city is famous.

Mackay has a rich history and culture, known for its architecture, food, and as a cultural-melting pot. It has long established cross-cultural communities that have influenced the city; including Yuwi, South Sea Islanders, Italians, Maltese, and more recently Filipinos. Mackay is considered the capital of South Sea Islander culture, being home to the largest population in the nation. The city is noted for its seafood, tropical produce, public art and laneways, jazz scene, and festivals including the Mackay Festival of Arts and Jazz in the Park. 

Major landmarks in Mackay include, Bluewater Quay and river markets, Mackay Harbour, the Leichhardt Tree, the Bluewater Sculpture trail and the Kommo Toera trail through the Mackay Wetlands. The city&#x27;s hinterland includes, Mount Blackwood, Eungella National Park including Finch Hatton Gorge, along with the expansive mountain bike trails between Eungella and Finch Hatton. Mackay&#x27;s coastal highlights include, Cape Hillsborough, the national parks of Round Top and Flat Top islands and the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Great Barrier Reef.

==Name==
The city was named after John Mackay. In 1860, he was the leader of an expedition into the Pioneer Valley. John Mackay&#x27;s journal as his expedition party entered the Pioneer Valley on 20 May 1860 describes &quot;a large river about one hundred yards broad, with good provision of water. McCrossan proposed it should be called the Mackay River, and the party agreed to it.&quot; He returned in 1862 with a herd of cattle and established the first settlement at Greenmount. By October 1862 a settlement was established on the banks of the &quot;Mackay&quot; river close to the mouth. But the unregistered name of the Mackay River didn&#x27;t last long. Commodore Burnett of HMS &quot;Pioneer&quot; was surveying the Queensland coastline and as there was already a &quot;Mackay&quot; River in Rockingham Bay, he decided on 27 December 1862 to rename the river &quot;Pioneer&quot;. In May 1863 Thomas Henry Fitzgerald completed the first survey of the township and proposed it would be called Alexandra after Princess Alexandra of Denmark, who married Prince Edward (later King Edward VII). Fitzgerald finally used the name Alexandra for his sugar cane plantation in 1866. It is also the name of a Mackay suburb of Alexandra today.

There has always been much contention over the pronunciation of the name Mackay. Correspondence received by Mackay City Library in 2007, from descendants of John Mackay, confirms that the correct pronunciation is , from the Gaelic name , which is pronounced &quot; not &quot;.

==History==
The area which is now Mackay City was originally inhabited by the local Yuibera people.
&quot;Yuwibara (&quot;also known as &quot;Yuibera, Yuri, Juipera, Yuwiburra)&quot; is an Australian Indigenous language spoken on Yuwibara country. It is closely related to the Biri languages/dialects. The Yuwibara language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Mackay Region.&quot;&quot;

Captain James Cook, sailed past the Mackay coast on 1 June 1770 and named several local landmarks, including Cape Palmerston, Slade Point and Cape Hillsborough. It was during this trip that the &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s botanist, Sir Joseph Banks, briefly recorded seeing Indigenous Australians.

In 1860, John Mackay led an overland expedition to the region to obtain land. Finding most of the inland areas already having been selected by other British colonists, Mackay turned toward the coast and entered what he called the &quot;May Plains&quot; but is now known as the Pioneer Valley. Mackay was the first European to visit the region that is now named after him. He selected three large areas of land which he named Greenmount, Cape Palmerston and Shamrock Vale. In 1862 he returned with James Starr and 1200 head of livestock to establish these cattle stations but soon got into financial difficulty and sold them off.

In 1863, Mackay was declared a port of entry for settlers. Amongst the first boatload of arrivals was hotelier and future mayor Korah Halcomb Wills. Mackay was initially named Alexandra but the government soon changed it to Mackay to honour its founder. The first sale of town allotments was in 1864.

During the 1860s, the local Aboriginal population, as Henry Ling Roth puts it, &quot;did what they could to defend their country and their lives.&quot; The local detachment of the Native Police under Robert Arthur Johnstone started patrolling the area in 1867, and encountered several Aboriginal camps on the north side of the Pioneer River, one of which contained more than 200 people. A newspaper report of the time says that Johnstone dealt with these people &quot;in the usual and only effectual mode for restraining their savage propensities.&quot; The usual mode of the Native Police was terror, violence and massacre. In 1868 a large group of Aboriginal people killed 7 cattle at Greenmount. Johnstone and his troopers were sent out after them but it is unclear if he succeeded in &quot;administering a lesson to the blackskins.&quot; Colonist, George Bridgman, provided some sanctuary to the remnants of the tribes and in 1871 an Aboriginal Reserve was gazetted near Rosella. This reserve shut in 1885.
In 1865, John Spiller, an Englishman who was connected with sugar plantations in colonial Java, planted the first sugarcane crop in the Mackay region. John Ewen Davidson and T. H. Fitzgerald built the first production sugar mill in 1868. Most of the labour on the sugar plantations was provided by South Sea Islanders. The first 70 of these workers arrived in Mackay on 12 May 1867 aboard the &quot;Prima Donna&quot;. and were sent to work at Fitzgerald&#x27;s Alexandra Plantation.
By the mid-1880s there were over 30 sugar plantations and 26 sugar mills in the Mackay region. Over one third of the 6000 inhabitants were South Sea Islander labourers. On Boxing Day 1883, a race riot occurred between members of these workers and some of the European population at the Mackay racecourse. Hundreds of people on both sides threw bottles at each other until around 50 Anglo-Australian horsemen wielding stirrup irons galloped into the group of Islanders, knocking them down with their improvised weapons and riding over them. Officially two Islanders were killed but it was believed a greater number later died of injuries. One white man involved, George Goyner, was found guilty of assault and sentenced to two months in prison. Around thirty Islanders were also imprisoned.

In 1918, Mackay was hit by a major tropical cyclone causing severe damage and loss of life with hurricane-force winds and a large storm surge. The resulting death toll was further increased by an outbreak of bubonic plague. Communication links into Mackay were destroyed. The outside world did not learn of the Mackay cyclone until five days after impact, leading to some speculation the city had been completely destroyed. The disaster remains one of the most destructive cyclones to strike a populated centre in Australia.
The foundation stone of the Mackay War Memorial was laid on the river bank on 18 November 1928 by the mayor George Albert Milton. It was unveiled on 1 May 1929 by the mayor. Due to flooding, the memorial was relocated to Jubilee Park in 1945. Due to the construction of the Civic Centre, it was relocated to another part of the park in March 1973.

The largest loss of life in an Australian aircraft accident was a B17 aircraft, with 40 of 41 people on board perishing, on 14 June 1943, after departing from Mackay Aerodrome, and crashing in the Bakers Creek area.
The Rats of Tobruk Memorial commemorates those who died at and since the Battle of Tobruk. The memorial was dedicated on 4 March 2001.

On 18 February 1958, Mackay was hit with massive flooding caused by heavy rainfall upstream with 878 mm of rain falling at Finch Hatton in 24 hours. The flood peaked at . The water flowed down the valley and flooded Mackay within hours. Residents were rescued off rooftops by boats and taken to emergency accommodation. The flood broke Australian records.

In 1970 Queen Elizabeth II, the Duke of Edinburgh, and Princess Anne toured Australia including Queensland. The Queensland tour began on Sunday 12 April when the royal yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; entered Moreton Bay at Caloundra, sailing into Newstead Wharf. After visiting Brisbane, Longreach and Mount Isa the Royal Family travelled to Mackay. The visit to Mackay in the evening followed a late afternoon flight from Mount Isa on 16 April. The Royal Family were taken to the Anglican Parish Hall at the intersection of Sydney and Gordon Streets for a civic reception, held in honour of their arrival.

On 15 February 2008, almost exactly 50 years from the last major flood, Mackay was devastated by severe flooding caused by over 600 mm of rain in 6 hours with around 2000 homes affected.

Mackay was battered by Tropical Cyclone Ului, a category three cyclone which crossed the coast at nearby Airlie Beach, around 1:30 am on Sunday 21 March 2010. Over 60,000 homes lost power and some phone services also failed during the storm, but no deaths were reported.

The Dudley Denny City Library opened in 2016.

In , the city of Mackay had a population of 78,685.

==Geography==

Mackay is situated on the 21st parallel south adjacent to the Coral Sea coast and about both banks of the Pioneer River. The Clarke Range lies to the west of the city. The city is expanding to accommodate for growth with most of the expansion happening in the Beachside, Southern, Central and Pioneer Valley suburbs. Suburbs to the north of the city such as Midge Point are also fast growing with residential estates in demand. 
There is disagreement about how to describe the location of Mackay, with debate ongoing as to whether the city is located in North Queensland or Central Queensland. 
There is no uniform agreement among either state or federal government agencies on the definition of North Queensland, with government services for Mackay being provided through both Townsville (North Queensland) and Rockhampton (Central Queensland).
In its news coverage, the national Australian Broadcasting Corporation consistently describes Mackay as being in North Queensland. The ABC&#x27;s local radio station in Mackay is also called ABC Tropical North.
However, Queensland Health designates Mackay as a health district distinct from both Central Queensland and Townsville health districts and the Mackay-based rescue helicopter, part of the Queensland Health Aeromedical Retrieval Service, is called CQ Rescue.
===Climate===
Mackay has a dry-winter humid subtropical climate (Koppen: Cwa), closely bordering a tropical savanna climate (Koppen: Aw) with hot, very rainy summers and very mild, dry winters. Warm to hot weather predominates throughout the year, with mean maximums averaging from in January to in July, while minimums range from in July to in February.

The wet season, lasting from December to March, is characterised by hot weather, high humidity and intense rainfall, with occasional monsoonal low pressure systems and tropical cyclones. Meanwhile, the dry season, from June to October, are cooler and less humid. The majority of the 110.0 clear days are recorded during these months; which are sunny and relatively dry. While frost is extremely rare in Mackay, it has been recorded to the west of the city during some winters. April and November are transitional months- moderately rainy and humid.

Extreme temperatures in Mackay have ranged from on 26 November 1918 to on 22 July 1951. The highest rainfall recorded in one day was on 22 January 1918.
==Economy==
As of the 2007–08, Mackay contributed $15.4 billion to the Australian economy, or 7.1% of Queensland&#x27;s gross state product (GSP). This is largely on the back of its export-oriented industries of sugar and mining.

Mackay is famous for its history as one of Australia&#x27;s largest sugarcane farming regions. However, in recent years, the mining industry has become the mainstay of the local economy.

===Mining===
 Mackay is widely recognised as the gateway to the Bowen Basin coal mining reserves of Central Queensland. It is the single largest coal reserve in Australia, with 34 operational coal mines extracting more than 100 million tonnes annually. While much of this is used in Australia, Japan and China are the largest export recipients.

===Sugar===
Mackay was known as the &quot;sugar capital&quot; of Australia, producing a sizeable portion of Australia&#x27;s domestic supplies and exports. However, the industry experienced a decline in the 2000s.

The industry in Mackay has its roots back in the 19th century. Historically, plantations were small and had their own mills to crush the cane during harvest. Over the years as the industry grew and developed, &quot;co-operatives&quot; were formed to consolidate the harvesting, crushing and distribution of the sugar in selected zones. Throughout the 20th century, the privately owned mills in the Mackay district closed one by one until only three remained – Marian, Racecourse Mill,
and Farleigh. Today, Pleystowe is the oldest surviving mill in the district (but closed in 2008).

The Marian Sugar Cane Mill is situated in Marian, 25 km west of Mackay. At the Farleigh Mill, there are mill tours accessed via the internet. Racecourse Mill also does tours, and therefore accessible via the internet. Mackay Sugar operates three of these remaining mills, including Racecourse, which became site of the region&#x27;s first sugar refinery (which is owned by CSR Limited) in the 1990s. Growers in the region have a total cane production area of approximately 86,000 hectares. The growers are capable (in good seasons) of supplying up to 6.5 million tonnes of cane to the factories for processing. On average, Mackay Sugar produces about 850,000 tonnes of raw sugar and 180,000 tonnes of the by-product molasses annually.

The sugar industry in Mackay has faced steep challenges since 2000, since it is largely dependent on high world sugar prices to remain viable. However, efforts are going into diversifying the use of sugar cane for different purposes.

===Tourism===
Compared to many of its neighbouring cities and regions in Queensland, Mackay&#x27;s tourism industry is small and still developing. This is despite being close to notable attractions including Eungella National Park, the Great Barrier Reef, and the Whitsunday Islands.

Data published in 2010 indicate about 685,000 domestic and international visitors come to the region annually. Domestic and international visitor night stays have increased to 2.7 million annually, an increase of nearly 1 million since 2000. 

===Marine===
Mackay is well situated to become a major service centre for the marine industry, being in immediate proximity to the Whitsundays, and located halfway between Brisbane and Cairns.

Currently the Mackay Marina is the largest base in the district for the maintenance, refit and related services for all marine craft, particularly Super Yachts. The Mackay Whitsunday Super Yacht Cluster, a group of regional companies focusing on providing integrated repair, refit and provisioning for the increasing number of visiting super yachts, was established in 2001 to support and promote the development of this sector.

===Retail===

 Mackay has three main shopping centres. Caneland Central is the largest of these, with more than 130 speciality stores. Myer is among the new anchor tenants. This expansion was opened on 13 October 2011.

Mount Pleasant Shopping Centre is the second major shopping centre in the Mackay region. It hosts department stores, supermarkets and other speciality outlets. Outside the main centre, a number of bulky-good outlets also operate, along with a six-screen Birch Carroll and Coyle cinema complex.

===Bluewater Trail===


The Bluewater Trail project, managed by the Mackay Regional Council, covers more than of dedicated pedestrian paths and bikeways. The primary purpose of the Bluewater trail is to facilitate pedestrian and cyclist-friendly activities that can be enjoyed anytime during the day or night. Now completed the track links several new attractions and tourism infrastructure pieces around the city including the Bluewater Lagoon, the Bluewater Quay and the Mackay Regional Botanic Gardens. It also incorporates the Sandfly Creek walkway through East Mackay, and the Catherine Freeman Walk which connects West Mackay to the city under the Ron Camm Bridge.

Located in the south of Mackay, the Mackay Regional Botanic Gardens are the start of the Bluewater Trail. The gardens opened and replaced Queen&#x27;s Park as Mackay&#x27;s botanic gardens in 2003 containing an array of rare plants native to the Mackay area and Central Queensland. Before 2003, the area was commonly called The Lagoons, and is centred on the shores of a billabong that years ago formed part of the Pioneer River further to the north. 

Heading east past the Mackay Base Hospital and along the Catherine Freeman Walk, the Bluewater Lagoon emerges. Comprising three tiered lagoons, the lagoon is a free family-friendly leisure facility overlooking the Pioneer River in the heart of Mackay&#x27;s city centre. A waterfall connects the two main lagoon areas, which vary in depth up to . Similar to the well-known Streets Beach at the South Bank Parklands in Brisbane, the lagoon is a popular summertime attraction for locals and visitors.
Further east along the trail is Bluewater Quay. As part of Queensland&#x27;s 150th anniversary celebrations, $12 million has been invested into the transformation of River Street, to the immediate east of the Forgan Bridge. The street now has various public amenities including access to a new viewing platform, upgraded fishing jetty, stage areas, cafes and space for weekend markets. Being long, the quay is built around the historic Leichhardt Tree (which falls under the Nauclea evergreen variety), a common meeting point for new migrants to Mackay who arrived at the old Port district along River Street.

The Bluewater Trail project has been very successful, gained significant recognition and received several awards:

* In 2010, it received national recognition, collecting two awards at the National Heart Foundation Local Government Awards. The Bluewater Trail was named the National overall winner and won its category (Planning for Active Living) at the Heart Foundation Local Government Awards.
*In 2010 and 2011, the trail was recognised in the Community Champions Award by the Queensland Spinal Injuries Association (QSIA). It was awarded for providing equitable and accessible facilities in the category of Best Recreation/Leisure Venue or Precinct.
* The Bluewater Trail has also gained considerable interest from other organisations and programs and has been used as an ‘inspirational example’ as part of the following two case studies in 2011:

# ‘Active Healthy Communities’ - a resource package for local government to create supportive environments for physical activity and healthy eating coordinated by Queensland Government (Queensland Health) in partnership with the Heart Foundation and Local Government Association of Queensland Ltd (LGAQ).
# ‘Healthy Community / Healthy Workplace projects or initiatives’ – case studies aiming to build the capacity of Queensland councils by raising awareness of the relevance, role and opportunities for creating healthy communities coordinated by Local Government Association of Queensland Ltd (LGAQ).

* In 2012 Mackay Regional Council Manager Recreation Services Mr Onno Van Es won the 2012 Local Government Association Queensland (LGAQ) Healthy Leaders Award (Senior Manager Category). &quot;Onno was the visionary and leader behind two award winning council projects, the Bluewater Lagoon and the Bluewater Trail, that offer residents the chance to get outdoors and live a healthy lifestyle.&quot; He was recognised for &quot;nurturing healthy partnerships across government jurisdictions and securing significant resources for healthy community infrastructure, shaping the environment through the creation of the award winning $30 million Bluewater Trail and $12.7 million Bluewater Lagoon projects and their activation through the delivery of healthy lifestyle programs.&quot;

===Festival of Arts===
The Mackay region is home to the Mackay Festival of Arts held annually throughout July. Now more than 20 years old, it is the largest regional arts festival in Queensland. The festival features wine and cheese tasting sessions, live jazz and other music, stand-up routines, art exhibitions, dance and other performances.

===Artspace Mackay===
Artspace Mackay, which opened in a new award-winning building designed by Cox Rayner Architects in February 2003, contains the Mackay Regional Council (MRC) Art Collection. This includes more than 1,200 artworks, and &quot;one of the biggest holdings of artists&#x27; books in Australia outside of the capital cities&quot;.

===City Centre===


The City Centre is noted for its art-deco inspired architecture, with many buildings throughout the main streets of the central business district featuring distinctive designs from the early 20th century. Some of the most famous buildings are the former Main Post Office dating from 1940 with its clock tower, the Masonic Temple built in 1936, the Pioneer Shia Council built in 1935, Taylors Hotel (1936) and the Ambassador Hotel (1937). The Commonwealth Bank which was built as early as 1880 and the Old Court house dating from 1885 are two of the oldest buildings in town. The Technical College which was built 1911-12 is a part of the University. One of the most famous houses built in an art-deco style is Chaseley House in Sydney Street. The Town Hall dating from 1916 is one of the buildings which survived the cyclone of 1918 undamaged. St. Paul&#x27;s Uniting Church which was completed in 1898 is the oldest church in town. One of the largest churches is St. Patrick Church whose parsonage built in 1915 is one of the oldest residential buildings in Mackay. The precinct was upgraded in the 1990s through a unique community arts project. The overall theme depicts the environmental beauty of the Mackay region and consists of bronzed plaques, sculptures and terrazzo/mosaic tiles. Of particular interest is a sculptured free-form seat in the shape of a bommie, or bombora, and covered in myriad colours depicting the Great Barrier Reef through to the rainforests of Eungella National Park. 

===Mackay Marina Village===
Mackay Marina Village is a coastal precinct located adjacent to the Mackay Harbour. The marina itself has nearly 500 berths.

===Gateway to the Pioneer Valley===
Among the natural assets of the Pioneer Valley are the walking tracks and swimming holes of Finch Hatton Gorge. The Eungella National Park, located at the very top of the range, is the longest and oldest stretch of subtropical rainforest in Australia, covering more than 51,700 hectares. It is one of the few places where platypus can be seen swimming in the wild, while more than 225 species of bird have been recorded in the surrounding forests.

===Islands and beaches===
Mackay has 31 beaches within driving distance. Closest to the city are Illawong, Far and Town beaches. The patrolled Harbour Beach, adjacent to the Mackay Marina, is the most popular, being suitable for swimming. Lambert&#x27;s Beach is also close to the city. Further north of the city are popular beaches at Bucasia, Dolphin Heads, Blacks Beach, Shoal Point and Eimeo – collectively these areas are known as the Northern Beaches. The Northern Beaches are popular with visitors, but are increasingly being developed as residential areas for Mackay&#x27;s growing population.

===River Sessions Festival===
Held annually in June, River Sessions is Mackay and Central Queensland&#x27;s premier youth and contemporary music festival. The festival features the best rock, hip-hop, alternative, folk, pop and dance music acts from around Australia.

==Transport==
Two major highways, the A1 (Bruce Highway), and State Route 70 (Peak Downs Highway), pass through Mackay. The A1 connects the city to Townsville, Proserpine and Cairns in the north, and Rockhampton and Brisbane in the south. The Peak Downs Highway connects it to Moranbah, Clermont and Emerald in the south-west. In September 2020 the city was fully bypassed with users of the Bruce Highway able to use the new Mackay Ring Road to avoid the city.

The North Coast railway line meets the western line in the city&#x27;s south. Trains from Brisbane pass through Mackay railway station and continue through to Proserpine, Townsville and Cairns, including the regular &quot;Spirit of Queensland&quot; service between Brisbane and Cairns. Minerals from the western line (Moranbah and other coal mining centres) are transported to Hay Point and Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminals for trans-shipment to other destinations. Mackay Harbour deals mainly with sugar exports and visiting cruise ships.

The city is served by Mackay Airport, from which QantasLink, Virgin Australia, and Jetstar offer flights to Brisbane and Melbourne, as well as to regional destinations such as Geelong, Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton and Gladstone. MacAir Airlines previously provided a limited service into and out of Mackay for mining companies before it went into receivership in 2009.

Mackay Transit Coaches operates from North Mackay to South Mackay. The area with the best service coverage is Mackay&#x27;s central business district.

==Health and education==
The Mackay Base Hospital in West Mackay, about from the city centre, is the main hospital for Central Queensland and has recently undergone extensive upgrades. The Mater Hospital, and the Mackay Specialist Day Hospital are in the city&#x27;s north. The Pioneer Valley Hospital, which had initially ceased operating, has been converted into an injury rehabilitation centre.

The Queensland Department of Education has 11 primary schools and 5 high schools in Mackay. The high schools are Pioneer State High School, Mackay State High School, Mackay North State High School, Mackay Northern Beaches State High School and Mirani State High School. One of the primary schools, Eungella State School was opened on 31 January 1928. Another, Mackay North State School, opened on 23 March 1915. The school celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2015.

The private system encompasses six and a half primary schools, Whitsunday Anglican School, two P–12 colleges, one P–10 college, one 7–10 college and St Patrick&#x27;s College, which is the state&#x27;s only 11–12 college.

The Mackay campus of Central Queensland University is in the outer suburb of Ooralea, while the local campus of James Cook University is in South Mackay. The city is also home to a TAFE (a technical/vocational college), which is in the south of the inner city.

The Mackay Regional Council operates the Dudley Denny City Library at 134 Victoria Street, and the Gordon White Library in the outer suburb of Mount Pleasant.

==Government==
Mackay is governed locally by the Mackay Regional Council. The original Mackay City Council was formed in 1869. In 1994 the surrounding Pioneer Shire Council was amalgamated into the Mackay City Council. A further amalgamation in 2008 of the Sarina Shire Council and the Mirani Shire Council formed the present Mackay Regional Council The mayor is Greg Williamson. There are three State Government seats in the Mackay Regional Council footprint. Nigel Dalton is the member for the electoral district of Mackay, Glen Kelly represents Mirani and Amanda Camm represents Whitsunday. Andrew Willcox is the Federal Member for the Division of Dawson, which includes most of Mackay.

<text>The Svecoman (, , ) movement was a Suecophile or pro-Swedish nationalist movement that arose in the Grand Duchy of Finland at the end of the 19th century chiefly as a reaction to the demands for increased use of Finnish vigorously presented by the Fennoman movement. The Fennoman nationalist movement had demanded that Swedish be replaced by Finnish in public administration, courts, and schools. At the time, Finnish and Swedish were spoken by about 85 and 15 percent respectively of the duchy&#x27;s population.

The ideas of the &quot;Svecomans&quot; were an important part of the public debate of the 1870s and 1880s that was evoked by the reinstatement of the Diet of Finland, which now convened every third year.

== History ==

Finland had been a part of Sweden from the early Middle Ages until the Finnish War of 1808–1809, when it was ceded to Russia and made a Grand Duchy within the Russian Empire. Although Finnish was the language of the majority of the new Grand Duchy, a significant minority was Swedish-speaking. Swedish had been the language of administration and in educational institutions when Finland was part of the Swedish realm.

The Svecomans promoted the idea that Finland harbours two peoples, or nations, speaking different languages, with different cultures, and originating from separate parts of the country. In accordance with contemporary science, these two peoples were consequently denoted as members of different &quot;races&quot;. This idea was radically new. Until then, the Swedish-speaking rural population had been mostly ignored, but now this minority was considered important and directly associated with the elite of Finland.

The language strife between Fennomans and Svecomans in these decades also mirrored more general political divisions:
* The Fennomans were favoured by the Russian authorities, while the Svecomans channeled the remaining fear of the Russians and the cultural attachment to their old enemy Sweden.
* After the Crimean War, when the Swedish-speaking towns on Finland&#x27;s south coast and the merchant fleet had been severely damaged, neutralist views received strong support among educated Eastern-Swedish.
* The Fennomans were chiefly dominated by the clergy, the Svecomans by industrialists and academics from other faculties besides the theological one. The spiritual leader of the Svecomans was the linguist Axel Olof Freudenthal, who also had claims of racial supremacy.

The feeling of unity between the Swedish-speaking rural population and the (remains of the) Swedish-speaking elite is the lasting legacy of the Svecoman movement, and this became the core idea of the Swedish People&#x27;s Party, which was founded after the introduction of equal and common suffrage in 1906.

<text>Korhogo (N&#x27;Ko: ߞߙߐߞߐ߫, &quot;Krokо̄&quot;) is a city in northern Ivory Coast. It is the seat of both Savanes District and Poro Region. It is also a commune and the seat of and a sub-prefecture of Korhogo Department. In the 2014 census, the city had a population of 243,048, making it the fourth-largest city in the country and the largest in northern Ivory Coast.

Korhogo produces goods such as cotton, kapok fibre, rice, millet, peanuts, corn, yams, sheep, goats and diamonds. The settlement was on an important pre-colonial trade route to the Atlantic coast. It is said to have been founded by Nangui, a 14th-century Senufo patriarch and still is the capital of the Senufo people.

Sights in Korhogo include the Péléforo Gbon Coulibaly Regional Museum and the woodcarvers&#x27; quarter. Korhogo is also home to an airport, a large market, a cinema, and a mosque.

Korhogo&#x27;s average annual rainfall is 1,243 mm, with the rainiest months being May to October. Its average year-round temperature is 26.6 degrees Celsius, with the hottest months being February to April. Korhogo&#x27;s airport (Korhogo Airport) has the International Air Transport Association code HGO and the International Civil Aviation Organization code DIKO. Its one runway is 2,100 metres (6,900 ft) long, and receives domestic flights only.

The southwest quarter of the city is dominated by Mont-Korhogo.

==Civil War history==
On 19 September 2002, Korhogo and Bouaké were seized by disaffected former soldiers, calling themselves &quot;Patriotic Movement of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot; (Mouvement Patriotique de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire - MPCI),
rebelling against the rule of President Laurent Gbagbo. The coup was allegedly led by Robert Guéï, the former military dictator overthrown in a popular uprising in 2000. Despite the formal cessation of hostilities between the government and rebels in 2003, Korhogo remains unstable, with continued fighting between rival factions. In June 2004, forces loyal to rebel leader Guillaume Soro claimed that his Paris-based rival Ibrahim Coulibaly had attempted to assassinate Soro, leading to gun battles which left 22 dead in Korhogo. In August 2004, the United Nations&#x27; Ivorian mission announced that three mass graves, containing at least 99 bodies, had been discovered in the town.

On 29 November 2011, the Associated Press reported that Gbagbo had been placed under house arrest in Korhogo, awaiting extradition to The Hague to face charges at the International Criminal Court.

In 2014, the population of the sub-prefecture of Korhogo was 286,071.

<text>The Progress Party (, FrP) is a right-wing populist political party in Denmark which was founded in 1972.

The party&#x27;s founder, the former lawyer Mogens Glistrup, gained widespread popularity as well as notoriety in the country after he appeared on Danish television, stating that he paid 0% in income tax. The party was placed on the right of the political spectrum as it believed in radical tax cuts (including removing the income tax altogether) and vowed to cut government spending. In the late 1970s, its agenda was &quot;the gradual abolition of income tax, the disbandment of most of the civil service, the abolition of the diplomatic service and the scrapping of 90% of all legislation&quot;. From the 1980s, the party also adopted anti-immigration as a key issue.

The party entered the Danish parliament after the 1973 landslide election and immediately became the second largest party in Denmark. After this the party gradually decreased in voter support, and when some of its leading members broke out and established the Danish People&#x27;s Party in 1995, the party soon lost its representation in parliament. It last won members of the Folketing in 1998, and has since become a minor party. In the 2019 general election, it supported the New Right.

== History ==

The Progress Party was founded by tax lawyer Mogens Glistrup in 1972 as a tax protest. The party&#x27;s initial issues were less bureaucracy, abolition of the income tax and simpler law paragraphs. The party entered the Danish Parliament after the &quot;electoral earthquake&quot; of the 1973 Danish parliamentary election. It won 15.9% of the vote and 28 seats, making it the second-largest party in parliament. However, it did not form a part of the ruling coalition because the other parties refused to cooperate with it. The party also became well-known for Gilstrup&#x27;s unique sense of humour such as the proposal for the entire Ministry of Defence to be replaced by an answering machine with the recorded message &quot;We surrender&quot; in Russian.

The Progress Party&#x27;s seats in parliament fell to 20 in 1979, partly due to internal splits between &quot;pragmatists&quot; (&quot;slappere&quot;) who wanted to pursue cooperation with mainstream parties; and &quot;fundamentalists&quot; (&quot;strammere&quot;) who wanted the party to stand alone. The party started to turn its attention on immigration by 1979, although immigration did not become important before the late 1980s. Having added a &quot;Mohammedan-free Denmark&quot; as one of its declared goals in 1980, Glistrup increasingly made comments about Muslims and used the slogan to &quot;Make Denmark a Muslim Free Zone&quot;. In 1983, Glistrup was sentenced to three years in prison for tax fraud. While Glistrup was in prison, the pragmatists led by Pia Kjærsgaard took over the leadership of the party. Returning to the party after his release in 1987, Glistrup was no longer in control of it and internal strife broke out again. Glistrup refused to vote in favour of a proposition which had been agreed with the government in 1988 and was stripped of his position as a representative for the party. He was expelled from the national executive of the party in 1991 and went on to found his own party, called Prosperity Party (&quot;Trivselspartiet&quot;).

The Progress Party won twelve seats in the 1990 Danish parliamentary election. Internal disputes were still far from resolved, and eventually led the party to be split when the Danish People&#x27;s Party (DF) was founded by Kjærsgaard and the pragmatists in 1995. While liberals remained in the tax-focused Progress Party, the new DF included those who were concerned with immigration as their main issue.

When the party&#x27;s new leader Kirsten Jacobsen decided to leave politics in 1999, Mogens Glistrup was allowed back in the party again in lack of any leading figures. Because of this, the Progress Party&#x27;s remaining four member in parliament left and founded Freedom 2000. Despite their own positions against immigration, Glistrup&#x27;s comments in the media had become so extreme that they felt forced to leave the party (comments included &quot;either one is a racist or else one is a traitor&quot; and demanding all &quot;Mohammedans&quot; in Denmark to be interned in camps and expelled from the country). Glistrup led the party for the 2001 Danish parliamentary election, but it had lost almost all its support and received less than one percent of the vote. The party did not run in the 2005 Danish parliamentary election nor in the 2007 Danish parliamentary election. However, it did run for the local and regional elections in November 2005. The party generally received less than one percent of the votes (though with several local exceptions), and got one member elected in the municipality of Morsø serving as the last elected representative of the party until the end of 2009. In the 2019 Danish general election, the Progress Party supported The New Right.

== Ideology ==

=== Main issues ===
The party&#x27;s political issues were:
# Abolishing income tax.
# Cleaning up the law jungle.
# Reducing bureaucracy.
# Putting a stop to immigration from Islamic countries and researching its consequences.

Glistrup added the fourth point in the 1980s.

=== Political positions ===
By 2010, its entire political program consisted of the following points, with the headline &quot;Stop the immigration&quot;:
# Abolishment of the income tax.
# Drastic reduction of bureaucracy.
# Drastic reduction of the &quot;law jungle&quot;.
# Restoration of borders and border control product.

<doc id="875125" wikidata="Q245319" url="?curid=875125" title="Midday Meal Scheme">
<text>The Mid Day Meal Scheme is a school meal programme in India designed to better the nutritional status of school-age children nationwide. The scheme has been renamed as PM-POSHAN Scheme. The programme supplies free lunches on working days for children in government primary and upper primary schools, government aided Anganwadis, &quot;Madarsa&quot; and &quot;Maqtabs&quot;. Serving 120 million children in over 1.27 million schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centres, the Midday Meal Scheme is the largest of its kind in the world.

The Midday Meal Scheme has been implemented in the Union Territory of Puducherry under the French Administration since 1930. In post-independent India, the Midday Meal Scheme was first launched in Tamil Nadu, pioneered by the former Chief minister K. Kamaraj in the early 1960s. By 2002, the scheme was implemented in all of the states under the orders of the Supreme Court of India.

Ajay Kumar Director of Poshan Abhiyaan shared &#x27;The name of the scheme has been changed to PM-POSHAN (&quot;Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman&quot;) Scheme, in September 2021, by MoE (Ministry of Education), which is the ministry responsible for the scheme&#x27;. The Central Government also announced that an additional 24 lakh students receiving pre-primary education at government &amp; government-aided schools would also be included under the scheme by 2022.

Under article 24, paragraph 2c of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which India is a party, India has committed to yielding &quot;adequate nutritious food&quot; for children. The programme has undergone many changes since its launch in 1995. The Midday Meal Scheme is covered by the National Food Security Act, 2013. The legal backing to the Indian school meal programme is akin to the legal backing provided in the US through the National School Lunch Act.

== History ==
The Midday Meal Scheme refers to the government of India programme introduced in all government elementary schools to provide children with cooked lunches. Tamil Nadu was the first state in India to introduce this scheme. The first school which had the scheme was the Sourashtra Boys Higher Secondary School, Madurai, which implemented it in 1955. On 28 November 2001 the Supreme Court asked all state governments to begin this programme in their schools within 6 months. The programme has shown many positive effects. Many parents who couldn&#x27;t send their children to schools due to poverty, were eager to get their children free nutritious food and this incentivized them to send their children to school. The Midday Meal Scheme increased the number of school-going children.

=== Roots of the programme ===
The roots of the programme can be traced back to the pre-independence era, when a midday meal programme was introduced in 1925 in Tamil Nadu. Initiatives by state governments began in the 1962–63 school year.

The Indian state Tamil Nadu was a pioneer in introducing midday meal programmes in India to increase the number of children enrolling in school; K. Kamaraj, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu at the time, introduced it first in Chennai and later extended it to all districts of Tamil Nadu. During 1982, 1 July onwards, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. G. Ramachandran upgraded the existing midday meal scheme in the state to &#x27;Nutritious noon-meal scheme&#x27; keeping in mind that around 68 lakh children were malnourished. Gujarat was the second state to introduce an MDM scheme in 1984, but it was later discontinued.

A midday meal scheme was introduced in Kerala in 1984, and was gradually expanded to include more schools and grades. By 1990–91, twelve states were funding the scheme to all or most of the students in their area: Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh. Karnataka, Odisha and West Bengal received international aid to help with the implementation of the programme, while in AP and Rajasthan the programme was completely funded by foreign aid.

In Karnataka, the Children&#x27;s LoveCastles Trust started providing midday meals in 1997. A total of eight schools were adopted and a food bank programme and an Angganwasi milk Programme were started. The food-bank programme was replaced by the State Government midday meal scheme.

===Initiatives by the central government===

The government of India initiated the National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education (NP-NSPE) on 15 August 1995. The objective of the scheme is to help improve the effectiveness of primary education by improving the nutritional status of primary school children. Initially, the scheme was implemented in 2,408 blocks of the country to provide food to students in classes one through five of government, government-aided and local body run schools. By 1997–98, the scheme had been implemented across the country. Under this programme, a cooked midday meal with 300 calories and 12 grams of protein is provided to all children enrolled in classes one to five. In October 2007, the scheme included students in upper primary classes of six to eight in 3,479 educationally backward blocks, and the name was changed from National Programme for Nutrition Support to Primary Education to National Programme of Mid Day Meals in Schools. Though cooked food was to be provided, most states (apart from those already providing cooked food) chose to provide &quot;dry rations&quot; to students. &quot;Dry rations&quot; refers to the provision of uncooked 3 kg of wheat or rice to children with 80% attendance.

=== Supreme court order ===
In April 2001, the People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) initiated the Public Interest Litigation (Civil) No. 196/2001, People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India &amp; Others – popularly known as the &quot;right to food&quot; case. The PUCL argued that – &quot;right to life&quot; of the Indian constitution when read together with articles (a) and , makes the right to food a derived fundamental right which is enforceable by virtue of the constitutional remedy provided under of the constitution. The PUCL argued that excess food stocks with the Food Corporation of India should be fed to hungry citizens. This included providing midday meals in primary schools. The scheme came into force with the supreme court order dated 28 November 2001, which requires all government and government-assisted primary schools to provide cooked midday meals.

==== Interim orders ====
The Supreme Court occasionally issues interim orders regarding midday meals. Some examples are:
=== Entitlements ===
The nutritional guidelines for the minimum amount of food and calorie content per child per day are:

In the case of micronutrients (vitamin A, iron, and folate) tablets and de-worming medicines, the student is entitled to receive the amount provided for in the school health programme of the National Rural Health Mission.

=== Finances ===
The central and state governments share the cost of the Midday Meal Scheme, with the centre providing 60 percent and the states 40 percent. The central government provides grains and financing for other food. Costs for facilities, transportation, and labour is shared by the federal and state governments. The participating states/territories contribute different amounts of money, depending on whether they are Himalayan states, Northeastern Region (NER) states, union territories without legislature, or the residual (Non-NER states and union territories with legislature). The share contributed by states is often larger than what is stipulated. While the eleventh five-year plan allocated for the scheme, the twelfth five-year plan has allocated , a 134 percent rise. The public expenditure for the Mid Day Meal Programme has gone up from in 2007–08 to in 2013–14. In 2020–21, the Midday Meal Scheme budget comprised 11% of the total budget for the Ministry of Education. The per day cooking cost per child at the primary level has been fixed to while at the upper primary level is .

=== Implementation models ===

==== Decentralised model ====
This is the most widespread practice. In the decentralised model, meals are cooked on-site by local cooks and helpers or self-help groups. This system has the advantage of being able to serve local cuisine, providing jobs in the area, and minimising waste. It also allows for better monitoring (e.g., by parents and teachers). In total, the MDM Scheme employs over 2.5 million cooks/food preparers (referred to as cooks-cum-helpers), usually providing a small honorarium for their work (equal to approximately US$14 per month).

In the absence of adequate infrastructure (such as kitchen sheds, utensils etc.), it can lead to accidents and maintaining hygiene can be difficult. In 2004, 87 children died when the thatched roof of a classroom was ignited by sparks from a cooking fire. In 2011, a child died after succumbing to burn injuries she sustained after accidentally falling into a cooking vessel.

==== Centralised model ====
In the centralised model, an external organisation cooks and delivers the meal to schools, mostly through public-private partnerships. Centralised kitchens are seen more in urban areas, where density of schools is high so that transporting food is a financially viable option. Advantages of centralised kitchens include ensuring better hygienic as large scale cooking is done through largely automated processes. Various NGOs such as the Nalabothu Foundation, Akshaya Patra Foundation, Ekta Shakti Foundation, Naandi Foundation, and Jay Gee Humanitarian Society provide midday meals.

A study of centralised kitchens in Delhi in 2007 found that even with centralised kitchens, the quality of food needed to be improved. The study also found that when the food arrives and is of inadequate quality, even teachers feel helpless and do not know whom to complain to.

The Ministry of Human Resource Development reported that 95% of tested meal samples prepared by NGOs in Delhi did not meet nutritional standards in 2010–12. In response, the ministry withheld 50% of the payment for the deficient meals.

==== International assistance ====
International voluntary and charity organisations have assisted. Church World Service has provided milk powder to Delhi and Madras Municipal Corporation; CARE has provided corn soya meal, Bulgar wheat, and vegetable oils; and UNICEF has provided high proteins foods and educational support. In 1982, &#x27;Food for Learning&#x27; was launched with assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Initially the programme was aimed at scheduled caste and scheduled tribe girls. In 1983, the federal Department of Education prepared a scheme under the auspices of the World Food Programme to supply meals to 13.6 million scheduled caste girls and 10.09 million scheduled tribe girls in classes one to five in 15 states and three union territories. The value of the food itself was $163.27 million per year. Labour, facilities, and transportation costs were to be paid by the state governments. The reaction among the states and union territories was mixed. Many states were interested, but some were concerned about their ability to afford it if the FAO support were to be withdrawn.

===Tithi Bhojan===
Tithi Bhojan is a concept designed to ensure greater public participation under the Midday Meal Programme, that started out in the state of Gujarat. In order to generate greater community participation, local members were encouraged to celebrate social events like birth of a child and homewarming by donating to the midday meals served in the local schools. It is voluntarily served by the community/family among school children in several forms such as sweets and savoury snacks, along with regular MDM, full meals, supplementary nutritive items like sprouted beans, and contributions in kind such as cookware, utensils, dinner sets or glasses for drinking water. The concept has been adopted by 10 other states, some with local nomenclatures like &quot;Sampriti Bhojan&quot; in Assam, &quot;Dham&quot; in Himachal Pradesh, &quot;Sneh Bhojan&quot; in Maharashtra, &quot;Shalegagi Naavu Neevu&quot; in Karnataka, &quot;Anna Dhanam&quot; in Puducherry, &quot;Priti Bhoj&quot; in Punjab and &quot;Utsav Bhoj&quot; in Rajasthan. In the North Indian states of Uttarakhand, Haryana and the Union territory of Chandigarh, the scheme retains its original name of Tithi Bhojan.

== Monitoring and implementation ==

=== Monitoring mechanism ===

The government of India Review Missions on Mid Day Meal Scheme, comprising members from the central government, state governments, UNICEF, and the office of the supreme court commissioner was created in 2010 to review the programme and offer suggestions for improvement. The scheme is independently monitored twice a year.

== Evaluation of the scheme ==
The MDM Scheme has many potential benefits: attracting children from disadvantaged sections (especially girls, Dalits and Adivasis) to school, improving regularity, nutritional benefits, socialisation benefits and benefits to women are some that have been highlighted.
Studies by economists show that some of these benefits have indeed been realised. The positive effect on enrollment of disadvantaged children (Dreze and Kingdon), on attendance (by Chakraborty, Jayaraman, Pande), on learning effort (by Booruah, Afridi and Somanathan), on improving nutritional inputs (Afridi), and on improving nutritional outcomes (by Singh, Dercon and Parker). However, policy inputs by Dr Edmond Fernandes suggested that it would be wise to address the problem through a cross sectoral perspective as cascading risks globally is affecting food security &amp; healthy nutrition.

Caste based discrimination continues to occur in the serving of food, though the government seems unwilling to acknowledge this.

Sukhdeo Thorat and Joel Lee found in their 2005 study that caste discrimination was occurring in conjunction with the Mid Day Meals programme.

Media reports also document the positive effect of the programme for women, especially working women and its popularity among parents, children and teachers alike. Media reports have also highlighted several implementation issues, including irregularity, corruption, hygiene, caste discrimination, etc. A few such incidents are listed below:

* In December 2005, Delhi police seized eight trucks laden with 2,760 sacks of rice meant for primary school children. The rice was being transported from Food Corporation of India godowns Bulandshahr district to North Delhi. The police stopped the trucks and investigators later discovered that the rice was being stolen by an NGO.
* In November 2006, the residents of Pembong village (30 km from Darjeeling) accused a group of teachers of embezzling midday meals. In a written complaint, the residents claimed that students at the primary school had not received their midday meal for the past year and a half. 
* In December 2006, &quot;The Times of India&quot; reported that school staff were inflating attendance in order to obtain food grains.
* Twenty-three children died in Dharma Sati village in Saran District on 16 July 2013 after eating pesticide-contaminated mid day meals. On 31 July 2013, 55 students at a government middle school fell ill at Kalyuga village in Jamui district after their midday meal provided by an NGO. On the same day, 95 students at Chamandi primary school in Arwal district were ill after their meal.
* Over the past 20 years, the amount allocated per student under the Midday Meal Scheme (Prime Minister&#x27;s Poshan Shakti Nirman) has increased by Rs. 3.45. In the year 2004-05, Rs. 2 per child was provided for classes one to five, which has now increased to Rs. 5.45, and Rs. 8.17 for classes six to eight, including the cost of cooking ingredients like rice, lentils, vegetables, spices, oil, and salt, as well as the cost of cooking gas. The Midday Meal Scheme is jointly operated by the central and state governments, with 60% of the funds provided by the central government and 40% by the state government.

== Criticism ==
Despite the success of the programme, child hunger as a problem persists in India. According to current statistics, 42.5% of the children under 5 are underweight. Some simple health measures such as using iodised salt and getting vaccinations are uncommon in India. &quot;India is home to the world&#x27;s largest food insecure population, with more than 500 million people who are hungry&quot;, India State Hunger Index (ISHI) said. Many children don&#x27;t get enough to eat, which has far-reaching implications for the performance of the country as a whole. &quot;Its rates of child malnutrition is higher than most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa,&quot; it noted. The 2009 Global Hunger Index ranked India at 65 out of 84 countries. More than 200 million went hungry in India that year, more than any other country in the world. The report states that &quot;improving child nutrition is of utmost urgency in most Indian states&quot;.

As the MDM Scheme operates only in government/government-aided schools, it does not serve the large share of children in India who attend private schools. From 2015 to 2018, the number of children receiving food through the MDM scheme declined in many states, a pattern that may at least partly reflect the rising popularity of private schools in the country.

<doc id="875130" wikidata="Q185346" url="?curid=875130" title="Ceyhan">
<text>Ceyhan () is a municipality and district of Adana Province, Turkey. Its area is 1,426 km2, and its population is 158,922 (2022). It is the most populous district of the province, outside the city of Adana. Ceyhan is the transportation hub for Middle Eastern and Central Asian oil and natural gas. The city is situated on the Ceyhan River that flows through Çukurova plain. The Ceyhan River is dammed at Aslantas to provide flood control and irrigation for the lower river basin around Ceyhan.

==Climate==
Ceyhan has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with very hot, muggy summers with low precipitation, and mild, rainy winters.

==Economy==
Ceyhan&#x27;s marine transport terminal is the Mediterranean terminus of the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline (the &quot;BTC&quot;) which brings crude oil from the landlocked Caspian Sea across Azerbaijan and Georgia, and entering Turkey in the northeast. The pipeline was completed in May 2005. The terminal contains seven storage tanks, a jetty capable of loading two tankers of up to simultaneously, metering facilities, a waste water treatment plant and vapor incineration (&quot;burn-off&quot;) facilities.

Ceyhan Terminal is also the destination of Kirkuk–Ceyhan Oil Pipeline but this was closed in 2024 due to a payment dispute.

==Contemporary Life==
Ceyhan is the second most developed and populated district of Adana Province after the center of Adana. The river runs through the district.

==Transport==
Adana Şakirpaşa Airport is the closest airport to Ceyhan west of the city. There are domestic and international flights to numerous destinations from the airport. There was a plane crash here in 1999. A Saudi bound plane carrying Hajj pilgrims crashed a few minutes after take off. There were many deaths.

Ceyhan railway station was opened in 1912 as part of the Berlin–Baghdad railway. The station is currently served by two regional lines and one long-distance line. Regional lines run from Mersin to İskenderun and Mersin to İslahiye; long-distance line runs from Adana to Elazığ. There are three services daily to Adana Central Station to connect to the western destinations; Mersin, Ankara, Karaman and Kayseri.

<text>A galactic halo is an extended, roughly spherical component of a galaxy which extends beyond the main, visible component. Several distinct components of a galaxy comprise its halo:

* the stellar halo
* the galactic corona (hot gas, i.e. a plasma)
* the dark matter halo

The distinction between the halo and the main body of the galaxy is clearest in spiral galaxies, where the spherical shape of the halo contrasts with the flat disc. In an elliptical galaxy, there is no sharp transition between the other components of the galaxy and the halo.

A halo can be studied by observing its effect on the passage of light from distant bright objects like quasars that are in line of sight beyond the galaxy in question.

== Components of the galactic halo ==

=== Stellar halo ===
The stellar halo is a nearly spherical population of field stars and globular clusters. It surrounds most disk galaxies as well as some elliptical galaxies of type cD. A low amount (about one percent) of a galaxy&#x27;s stellar mass resides in the stellar halo, meaning its luminosity is much lower than other components of the galaxy.

The Milky Way&#x27;s stellar halo contains globular clusters, RR Lyrae stars with low metallicity, and subdwarfs. In our stellar halo, stars tend to be old (most are greater than 12 billion years old) and metal-poor, but there are also halo star clusters with observed metal content similar to disk stars. The halo stars of the Milky Way have an observed radial velocity dispersion of about 200 kilometres per second and a low average velocity of rotation of about . Star formation in the stellar halo of the Milky Way ceased long ago.

=== Galactic corona ===
A galactic corona is a distribution of gas extending far away from the center of the galaxy. It can be detected by the distinct emission spectrum it gives off, showing the presence of atomic neutral hydrogen (the H I region, pronounced &quot;H-one&quot;) and other features detectable by X-ray spectroscopy.

=== Dark matter halo ===
The dark matter halo is a theorized distribution of dark matter which extends throughout the galaxy extending far beyond its visible components. The mass of the dark matter halo is far greater than the mass of the other components of the galaxy. Its existence is hypothesized in order to account for the gravitational potential that determines the dynamics of bodies within galaxies. The nature of dark matter halos is an important area in current research in cosmology, in particular its relation to galactic formation and evolution.

The Navarro–Frenk–White profile is a widely accepted density profile of the dark matter halo determined through numerical simulations. It represents the mass density of the dark matter halo as a function of formula_1, the distance from the galactic center:

formula_2

where formula_3 is a characteristic radius for the model, formula_4 is the critical density (with formula_5 being the Hubble constant), and formula_6 is a dimensionless constant. The invisible halo component cannot extend with this density profile indefinitely, however; this would lead to a diverging integral when calculating mass. It does, however, provide a finite gravitational potential for all formula_1. Most measurements that can be made are relatively insensitive to the outer halo&#x27;s mass distribution. This is a consequence of Newton&#x27;s laws, which state that if the shape of the halo is spheroidal or elliptical there will be no net gravitational effect from halo mass a distance formula_1 from the galactic center on an object that is closer to the galactic center than formula_1. The only dynamical variable related to the extent of the halo that can be constrained is the escape velocity: the fastest-moving stellar objects still gravitationally bound to the Galaxy can give a lower bound on the mass profile of the outer edges of the dark halo.

== Formation of galactic halos ==
The formation of stellar halos occurs naturally in a cold dark matter model of the universe in which the evolution of systems such as halos occurs from the bottom-up, meaning the large scale structure of galaxies is formed starting with small objects. Halos, which are composed of both baryonic and dark matter, form by merging with each other. Evidence suggests that the formation of galactic halos may also be due to the effects of increased gravity and the presence of primordial black holes. The gas from halo mergers goes toward the formation of the central galactic components, while stars and dark matter remain in the galactic halo.

On the other hand, the halo of the Milky Way Galaxy is thought to derive from the Gaia Sausage.

<text>Deathbird (Cal&#x27;syee Neramani) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Chris Claremont and Keith Pollard, the character first appeared in &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; #9 (September 1977). Cal&#x27;syee Neraman is part of a segment of the extraterrestrial Shi&#x27;ar race with a mutation.

Deathbird was born into the noble family of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire. She is the banished sister of the Shi&#x27;ar empress Lilandra Neramani. Deathbird seeks to overthrow her sister to gain access to the throne. She is a recurring antagonist of the superhero Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel as well as the X-Men.

==Publication history==
Deathbird debuted in &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; #9 (September 1977), created by writer Chris Claremont and penciler Keith Pollard. She later appeared in the 1981 &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; series. She appeared in the 2020 &quot;New Mutant&quot; series. She appeared in the 2022 &quot;Secret X-Men&quot; one-shot.

==Fictional character biography==

Deathbird was born Cal&#x27;syee Neramani to the ruling house of the Shi&#x27;ar Imperium on the Aerie (now known as Chandilar), native world of the Shi&#x27;ar. Her name was stripped from her after it was prophesied that she was destined to commit great evil. She was exiled after brutally murdering both her mother and an unnamed sister.

During this exile, she traveled on Earth and became an associate of MODOK and A.I.M. at some point. Following AIM&#x27;s orders, she battled Ms. Marvel in New York one evening after Carol Danver&#x27;s Park Avenue penthouse was destroyed by a bomb. The skirmish was interrupted after Deathbird severely injured the superhero, who became distracted trying to save the lives of two small children. It later resumed when Carol, going undercover, discovered that AIM had a secret headquarters underneath Alden&#x27;s Department Store. The battle between the two seemingly ended with Deathbird&#x27;s demise and MODOK&#x27;s escape after betraying her. Whether Deathbird sought revenge on AIM remains unknown. She did battle Hawkeye while still on Earth. She later battles Ms. Marvel again.

Some time later, her younger sister Lilandra became Majestrix of the Empire following the events that left their brother, D&#x27;Ken, comatose. Deathbird decided to take the throne for herself, and allied with the councilman Samedar, alien parasites called the Brood, and renegade members of the Imperial Guard in an attempted coup. The X-Men defeated her and her allies, but not before being infected by the Brood (although they were ultimately cured thanks to the efforts of Danvers and the Acanti Soulsinger). She later succeeded in deposing Lilandra with the aid of the Brood, and took the throne for herself. As ruler of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire, she contended with the Starjammers and Excalibur, and sought to capture Rachel Summers, but was nearly killed by Lilandra in combat.

Some time later War Skrulls impersonating Charles Xavier and the Starjammers aided Lilandra in deposing Deathbird and restoring her to the throne. With Lila Cheney&#x27;s help, she and the X-Men defeated the War Skrulls, but Deathbird ceded the empire back to Lilandra, since she had grown bored of the bureaucracy.

Deathbird later came to her sister&#x27;s aid during the short Kree-Shi&#x27;ar War, assassinating Kree leaders Ael-Dann and Dar-Benn. She was captured by Hawkeye in his guise as Goliath. She was later released and granted dominion over the conquered Kree Empire as viceroy, and also made praetor (leader) of the Kree Starforce by Lilandra. She led the Starforce in a confrontation with Quasar. The Kree seem to have since become independent once more.

===Romance with Bishop===
When the Shi&#x27;ar asked for the X-Men&#x27;s help against the invading Phalanx, who had already reached their throne-world Chandilar, the X-Men allied themselves with Deathbird. They managed to fend off a Phalanx assault on the Shi&#x27;ar Empire, and during the conflict, Deathbird and the X-Man Bishop forged a warrior&#x27;s respect for each other. Deathbird was amazed that the Earth mutant showed no fear and stood up to her, and they also seemed physically attracted to each other.

As a gesture of honor, Deathbird escorted the mutants back to Earth, but their ship was inexplicably destroyed in transit. Deathbird and an injured Bishop escaped using a private ship. She initially convinced Bishop that he was paralyzed due to his injuries and that, of all the X-Men, only he survived. However, not before long, Bishop realized that he was not injured but that Deathbird was using the lab equipment to hold him in stasis. The craft was soon attacked, and Bishop convinced her to release him so that they could deal with the matter together. Eventually, they bonded and soon became romantically involved.

During their journeys, the two were accidentally transported to an alternate future Earth that was ruled by the evil daughter of Shi&#x27;ar Empress Lilandra and Charles Xavier. Bishop and Deathbird helped the rebels in opposing her and Deathbird defeated her niece in a duel. She could have slain her, and every instinct told her to do so, but she let her live. The heroes of the liberated Earth helped Bishop and Deathbird return to their own time, and they continued their quest to get home.

===Betrayal and theorized heritage===

Eventually, Bishop and Deathbird return to the Sol System and encountered the inert planetary mass of the Living Monolith on their way to Terra Firma. Curious, the two land their craft and investigate the man-shaped planet. Suddenly Deathbird betrayed Bishop to a cadre of Skrulls and he was returned to Earth to implement the ultimate plans of the Skrulls&#x27; ally, Apocalypse. Deathbird was herself betrayed and transformed by Apocalypse into one of his Horsemen. With the title of War, Deathbird helped Apocalypse assemble the X-Men he referred to as &quot;the Twelve.&quot; Apocalypse was defeated, however, and Deathbird and the Horsemen scattered.

Deathbird and Bishop later run into each other during the Maximum Security event. Earth had been made a prison planet, with an energy barrier around the solar system, and Deathbird had the key to unlocking it. Bishop confronts her, and the two fight. Deathbird dares Bishop to kill her, before opening an airlock and getting sucked out into space. Bishop was able to close the airlock, and admits to himself that he hates her.

Some time later a globetrotting X-Men team led by Storm exile themselves from their home and teammates to find Destiny&#x27;s thirteen diaries since none like the idea of having their destinies defined. This team would recruits new members Heather Cameron and her brother Davis. During a mission to infiltrate the ship of the intergalactic warlord Khan, Heather&#x27;s appearance changes to resemble the alien Shi&#x27;ar race, and it was theorized that she and Davis had some Shi&#x27;ar heritage, Jean Grey noting that the cranial markings on her head and the crest of feathers she had manifested indicated Heather is of Shi&#x27;ar royal ancestry. An entry from Destiny&#x27;s diary seems to imply that at least Heather was &quot;Mothered by War,&quot; which happened to be Deathbird&#x27;s Horseman moniker while she was serving Apocalypse. The entry shows a picture of Deathbird facing off some of the X-Treme team members (Storm, Bishop, Thunderbird and Lifeguard in her Shi&#x27;ar appearance).

===The Rise and Fall of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire===
Deathbird was rescued by the Imperial Guard; Lilandra imprisoned her because she posed a threat to her rule. Vulcan is captured by the palace guard as he enters Shi&#x27;ar territory on his quest for vengeance against the entire Shi&#x27;ar race. He is incarcerated in the same maximum security installation that houses Deathbird. Vulcan is released by a member of a secret order that wishes D&#x27;Ken to lead the Shi&#x27;ar once more; Vulcan releases Deathbird.

Vulcan is enthralled by Deathbird, and they become romantically involved. He promises to put his quest for vengeance on hold. Deathbird convinces Vulcan to finish the healing process that the Shi&#x27;ar members of the secret order had begun on D&#x27;Ken, who remained in a coma since the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal incident. When D&#x27;Ken discerns Vulcan&#x27;s feelings for Deathbird, he invokes an ancient Shi&#x27;ar custom and invites Vulcan to marry Deathbird and become part of Shi&#x27;ar royalty.

Vulcan and Deathbird are married in front of the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal just as the X-Men, Lilandra, The Starjammers, and the Shi&#x27;ar loyal to Lilandra attack. During the chaos that ensues Vulcan kills D&#x27;Ken (never having promised not to kill him) and assumes the throne of Emperor of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire, with Deathbird as his Empress. During the fight Polaris crushes the ribs of Deathbird&#x27;s husband and she instructs the Imperial Guard, still loyal to the ruling family, to protect them as they flee.

===The Providian Order===
At some point after Vulcan&#x27;s death she was captured by a top secret organization, however they were not interested in Deathbird, but in her child - a hybrid of an atavistic Shi&#x27;ar and a Human Mutant. The Providian Order, as the organization calls itself, was created to bring equality and uniformity to the universe, by creating a new perfect race. Sharada Darthri, the geneticist of the Providian Order, experimented on the baby and infused it with Kree geneline, thought the influx was stopped by the awakening of Deathbird, who rampaged through the laboratory.

==Powers and abilities==
Deathbird is a genetic mutant who belongs to the Shi&#x27;ar species. She possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, flexibility, reflexes, coordination, balance, and endurance well beyond the average limits of her race. She shares the same avian-like physiology typical of her race, such as having hollow bones, but in her case the avian characteristics are more pronounced. This is because she is a &quot;genetic throwback&quot;, meaning that she resembles the more primitive Shi&#x27;ar who were birds of prey. She has inherited atavistic characteristics such as fully functioning wings, which most Shi&#x27;ar lack, and is capable of self-propelled flight at a natural winged flight limit velocity. Her wings are also very strong, as she could flex her wing to throw Ms. Marvel off the building or to the wall. Her fingernails are essentially talons which can score steel and tear through substances such as bone and tissue easily.

Aside from her natural physical advantages, Deathbird is a formidably trained warrior of great skill and cunning, having trained the likes of Gladiator. She is also skilled at hurling javelins. She uses a variety of javelins, some of which are designed for specific offensive effects. She carries the javelins as eight-inch (203 mm) quills on twin wrist-bands; when removed from its sheath, a quill will telescope to about four times its original length. Her standard javelin can be used as a spear-like projectile to wound or kill her foes. She has also used a javelin that emits noxious, acrid fumes upon impact. Some of Deathbird&#x27;s javelins are so designed that when their tips touch they emit a powerful, repeating 35,000 volt electrical charge. Deathbird has also used other equipment of Shi&#x27;ar design, including battle armor, and a large, advanced, one-woman energy cannon.

==Reception==
C. M. Edwards of &quot;Game Rant&quot; named Deathbird one of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;most iconic female villains,&quot; describing her as a &quot;prominent threat to both the X-Men and Captain Marvel.&quot; Liz Wyatt of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; referred to Deathbird as an &quot;iconic villain&quot; of Captain Marvel. Darby Hart of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; called Deathbird one of the &quot;best female villains&quot; of the X-Men and a &quot;major cosmic antagonist&quot; of the superhero team.&quot;

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
An alternate version of Deathbird appears in the Age of Apocalypse storyline. She is the leader of the Starjammers. It is also revealed that she took over the Shi&#x27;ar throne when she and D&#x27;ken murdered their father. Deathbird was later betrayed by D&#x27;ken who forcibly took the throne for himself before murdering Lilandra. With nowhere else to go, she joined the Starjammers to oppose D&#x27;ken&#x27;s rule. 

=== &quot;Star Trek/X-Men&quot; ===
An alternate version of Deathbird appears in &quot;Star Trek/X-Men&quot;. Deathbird defies the will of her sister and leads a Shi&#x27;ar force into the &quot;Star Trek&quot; reality. She attempts to partner with the reality-controlling Gary Mitchell.

<doc id="875140" wikidata="Q3180992" url="?curid=875140" title="John Bannon">
<text>John Charles Bannon (7 May 1943 – 13 December 2015) was an Australian politician and academic. He was the 39th Premier of South Australia, leading the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party from a single term in opposition back to government at the 1982 election.

At the 1985 election Bannon&#x27;s government was re-elected with an increased majority, but it was reduced to minority government status at the 1989 election. In 1992 Bannon became Labor&#x27;s longest-serving and South Australia&#x27;s second longest-serving Premier. As a result of the State Bank collapse, he resigned as Premier in 1992, and from parliament at the 1993 election landslide. He was also an academic and the Head of St Mark&#x27;s College.

==Early life==
Bannon was born in Bendigo. His father was prize-winning artist Charles Bannon. He attended East Adelaide Primary School and St Peter&#x27;s College in Adelaide, where his father taught art, and was awarded the Tennyson Medal in 1961. He completed degrees in Arts and Law at the University of Adelaide. While at university, he was co-editor of the student newspaper &quot;On Dit&quot; along with Ken Scott and Jacqui Dibden in 1964. He was president of the Adelaide University Student Representative Council in 1966–67, president of the Adelaide University Union in 1969–1971 and president of the National Union of Australian University Students in 1968. Following the completion of his studies, he was an advisor to various governments, including Whitlam&#x27;s.

==Political career==
He was elected to Ross Smith in the South Australian House of Assembly at the 1977 election and promoted to cabinet within a year. Following the resignation of Premier Don Dunstan and Labor&#x27;s loss in the 1979 election, Bannon was elected to the Labor leadership. Despite factional struggles within Labor, the Tonkin Liberal government oversaw the economy suffer through the early 1980s recession. After just one term, Bannon managed to return Labor to government at the 1982 election with a 5.9 percent two-party swing but only a one-seat majority.

While there had been a stream of social reform during Don Dunstan&#x27;s 1970-79 premiership, Bannon&#x27;s priorities were oriented in economics. Bannon government achievements include the Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine, the submarine project, the defence industry, the Hyatt and Adelaide Casino complex, conversion of part of the Adelaide railway station into the Adelaide Convention Centre, construction of the O-Bahn Busway from 1983 to the 1986 to 1989 planning and construction of the Tea Tree Gully O-Bahn extension, and the Formula One Grand Prix. The government also sold land reserved for freeways under the MATS plan. Poker machines were introduced in South Australia, a decision Bannon would come to regret decades later. Other measures were introduced such as action to prevent destruction of vegetation and urban renewal programmes to invigorate some of the declining inner suburbs in Adelaide.

The economic situation, very difficult in the early 80s, improved substantially in 1983–84. Bannon&#x27;s government was easily re-elected at the 1985 election, achieving a 2.2 percent two-party swing towards them from the Liberal opposition and a four-seat majority. However, the economy experienced another downturn in the late 80s/early 90s recession, and Bannon paid the price at the 1989 election, when the ALP won only 48 percent of the two-party vote: a swing of 5.2 percent against it. Both major parties won 22 seats each in the hung parliament, two short of a majority. Labor was able to form minority government with the confidence and supply support of the two Labor independent MPs, Martyn Evans and Norm Peterson. Peterson became Speaker of the South Australian House of Assembly following the election. Shortly thereafter, electoral legislation was passed with the objective that the party which receives over 50 percent of the statewide two-party vote at the forthcoming election should win the two-party vote in a majority of seats, through a compulsory strategic redrawing of electoral boundaries before each election, making South Australia the only state to do so. One element of the Playmander remains to this day which contributes to the above: the change from multi-member to single-member seats. It was only the second time that a Labor government in South Australia had been re-elected for a third term (the first time was when Dunstan won in 1977). In April 1988, Bannon was elected Federal President of the Labor Party. He held that position until June 1991.

===State Bank and resignation===
Bad lending decisions made by the State Bank of South Australia&#x27;s board and managing director Tim Marcus Clark were exposed. As the bank&#x27;s owner, the government was the guarantor of $3 billion worth of loans. Bannon remained as Premier during three inquiries, the last two of which cleared him of any deliberate wrongdoing. Upon resigning as head of government, he announced that he would not contest his seat of Ross Smith in the coming election. Lynn Arnold replaced Bannon as Premier but was unable to stave off a landslide defeat at the 1993 election. Labor achieved just 39.1 percent of the two-party vote, and suffered a swing of 8.9 percent against it. As a result, it retained only 10 seats in a house of 47.
Ross Smith was among the seats Labor retained despite suffering a 16% swing against it in its primary vote and an almost 11% swing against it in the two-party preferred vote.

==Later life==
In 1994, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation offered Bannon a directorial position, which he accepted. With an interest in South Australian history, he researched at Flinders University. He later studied and obtained a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Australian political history at Flinders University, where he was a professor. He was also an adjunct professor at the University of Adelaide Law School and in 2014 he received an honorary doctorate from the university. He was Master of St Mark&#x27;s College in Adelaide, from 2000 to 2007. On Australia Day 2007, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia. He wrote &quot;Supreme Federalist: The political life of Sir John Downer&quot;, which was released in 2009.

==Personal life==
Bannon&#x27;s first wife was Supreme Court Justice Robyn Layton, with whom he had a daughter, Victoria. His second wife, Angela, is the mother of musician and television personality Dylan Lewis. Bannon&#x27;s younger brother Nicholas died in Wilpena Pound in 1959.

Bannon was a good runner, completing the Adelaide Marathon 28 times, 11 of them in less than 3 hours. His best performance was the 1983 Adelaide Marathon, which he ran in a time of 2:44:34. He was premier at the time.

==Death==

Bannon died of cancer on 13 December 2015, aged 72, and was active right up until his death. He was given a state funeral on 21 December 2015.

<text>Dolma (Turkish for &quot;stuffed&quot;) is a family of stuffed dishes associated with Ottoman cuisine, typically made with a filling of rice, minced meat, offal, seafood, fruit, or any combination of these inside a vegetable or a leaf wrapping. Wrapped dolma, specifically, are known as sarma, made by rolling grape, cabbage, or other leaves around the filling. Dolma can be served warm or at room temperature and are common in modern cuisines of regions and nations that once were part of the Ottoman Empire.

==History==

Stuffed vegetable dishes have been a part of West Asian Cuisine for centuries. Recipes for stuffed eggplant have been found in Medieval Arabic cookbooks and, in Ancient Greek cuisine, fig leaves stuffed with sweetened cheese were called . The word dolma, of Turkish origin, means &quot;something stuffed&quot; or &quot;filled&quot;. (A Turkish share taxi is called a &quot;dolmuş&quot; for similar reasons). In some of the former Ottoman countries, native names have been retained or have blended with Turkish language terms, for example, in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and Damascus, stuffed leaves are called &quot;mahshi yabraq&quot; or &quot;mahshi brag&quot;, a combination of the Turkish word for leaf (&quot;yaprak&quot;) and the Arabic term for stuffed (&quot;mahshi&quot;). The origins of dolma, as suggested by &quot;The Oxford Companion to Food&quot;, likely stem from Armenian culinary traditions before becoming integrated into Turkish cuisine. William Pokhlebkin, a specialist on culinary history and cookbook author, contends that the dish&#x27;s inception traces back to Armenian culinary heritage:&quot;From the 17th to the early 19th century, Armenia was divided between Turkey and Iran. During this period, Armenia&#x27;s economy, its human and material resources declined, but its spiritual and material culture remained unchanged, and Armenian cuisine did not perish. On the contrary, Armenians contributed to the cuisine of the Seljuk Turks, so many truly Armenian dishes later became known in Europe through the Turks as, allegedly, Turkish cuisine (for example, dolma).&quot;

Several dolma recipes were recorded in 19th-century Iran by Naser al-Din Shah Qajar&#x27;s chef, including stuffed vine leaves, cabbage leaves, cucumbers, eggplants, apples, and quinces, with varied fillings prepared with ground meat, sauteed mint leaves, rice and saffron. Iraqi Jewish families have a version of dolma with sweet and sour flavors that were not found in other versions. Dolma are part of cuisine of the Sephardic Jews as well. Jews in the Ottoman Empire used locally grown grape leaves and adopted the Turkish name of the dish.

During winter months cabbage was a staple food for peasants in Persia and the Ottoman Empire, and it spread to the Balkans as well. Jews in Eastern Europe prepared variations of stuffed cabbage rolls with kosher meat—this dish is called holishkes. As meat was expensive, rice was sometimes mixed in with the meat. Jews in Europe would sometimes substitute barley, bread or kasha (barley porridge) for the rice. There are similar Slavic cabbage rolls: &quot;golubtsy&quot; in Russian, &quot;holubtsi&quot; in Ukrainian, &quot;gołąbki&quot; in Polish.

In the Persian Gulf, basmati rice is preferred, and the flavor of the stuffing may be enhanced using tomatoes, onions and cumin. Cabbage rolls entered Swedish cuisine (where they are known as &quot;kåldolmar&quot;) after Charles XII, defeated by the Russians at the battle of Poltava, returned to Sweden in 1715 with his Turkish creditors and their cooks.

==Distribution==
Dolma dishes are found in Turkish, Balkan, Southern Caucasian, Levantine cuisine, Palestinian, Mesopotamian, Persian, Israeli, Maghrebi and Central Asian cuisine.

In the cuisine of the Crimean Tatars, &quot;dolma&quot; refers to peppers stuffed with minced lamb or beef, rice, onion, salt, pepper. Carrots, greens, tomato paste, and spices can be added to the filling. When grape leaves are stuffed with the same filling, however, they are called &quot;sarma&quot;. 

In 2017, dolma making in Azerbaijan was included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.


==Variants==
There are many varieties of the &quot;zeytinyağlı&quot; (with olive oil) and &quot;sağyağlı&quot; (with clarified butter) &quot;dolmas&quot;. The &quot;zeytinyağlı&quot; dolmas are usually stuffed with rice and served cold with a garlic-yogurt sauce, but variations with meat based fillings are served warm, often with tahini or avgolemono sauce. 

===Stuffed vine leaves===
The origins of stuffed vine leaves are unknown. They can be made with meat or grain fillings, and served with garlic yogurt, &quot;tarbiya&quot; or sweet and sour sauces made with pomegranate syrup and sour cherries. They are known as &quot;dolmeh&quot; in Iran, &quot;dolmades&quot; in Greece, &quot;koupepia&quot; in Cyprus, &quot;tolma&quot; in Armenia and Georgia, &quot;yarpaq dolması&quot; in Azerbaijan and &quot;yebra&quot; in Syria. Egyptians call this main course &quot;mahshi&quot; (also spelled &quot;mashi&quot; or &quot;mashy&quot;), but traditionally cabbage is used in the winter and vine leaves are used in the summer. Stuffed vine leaves without any meat, called &quot;yalancı dolma&quot; in Turkish, are served at room temperature.

===Cabbage rolls===

In several countries, cabbage rolls are stuffed with beans and tart fruits. It is wrapped with cabbage leaves, and stuffed with red beans, garbanzo beans, lentils, cracked wheat, tomato paste, onion and many spices and flavorings. Cabbage rolls are called Pasuts tolma (պասուց տոլմա) (Lenten dolma) in Armenian where they are of seven different grains – chickpea, bean, lentil, cracked wheat, pea, rice and maize. Armenian cooks sometimes use rose hip syrup to flavor stuffed cabbage rolls. Cabbage rolls also known as &quot;kələm dolması&quot; in Azerbaijan

===Vegetables===
&quot;Mülebbes dolma&quot; is a historic recipe from the Ottoman era. &quot;Halep dolması&quot;—named for Aleppo—is a dish of eggplants stuffed with a meat and rice filling that is flavored with spices and either sour plum flavoring syrup or lemon juice. &quot;Şalgam dolma&quot; are stuffed Russian turnips.

 &quot;Soğan dolması&quot; (&quot;soğan&quot; means &quot;onion&quot; in Turkish), or stuffed onions, are a traditional dish in Bosnia, considered the specialty of Mostar. Ingredients include onions, minced beef, rice, oil, tomato purée, paprika, vinegar or sour cream, strained yogurt (locally known as &quot;kiselo mlijeko&quot;, literally &quot;sour milk&quot;), black pepper, salt and spices. After the onion&#x27;s skin is removed, the larger, external, layers (leaves) of onion bulbs are used as containers, so-called &quot;shirts&quot; (Old Turk. &quot;&quot; for a special kind of Ottoman robe) for the meat stuffing. The remaining part of the onion is also used, mixed with the meat and fried on oil for a couple of minutes, to obtain the base of the stuffing. To extract the separate &quot;shirts&quot;, the entire bulbs are cut on the top and then boiled until soft enough to be pried off, layer by layer. In order to prevent a further softening and crumbling, the bulbs should be blanched. The &quot;shirts&quot; are removed from the bulbs by slow and gentle finger pressure. Filled &quot;shirts&quot; (&quot;dolme&quot;) are boiled slowly at low heat in broth. The level of liquid should be sufficient to cover the dolmas entirely. Sogan-dolma are usually served with dense natural yogurt.

&quot;Enginar dolması&quot; is stuffed whole artichoke hearts. They may be stuffed with seasoned rice or ground meat cooked in fresh tomato sauce with aleppo pepper. Celery root may be substituted for the artichoke.

A regional specialty from Mardin is a mixed dolma platter. The sumac and Urfa pepper seasoned rice filling is first wrapped with onion layers, vine leaves, and cabbage. The remainder of the rice is used to fill eggplant, zucchini, and stuffing peppers. The wrapped onion dolma are added on the bottom of a deep cooking pot and the stuffed vegetables, cabbage rolls, and stuffed vine leaves are layered on top of the onion dolmas. The entire pot of dolmas are cooked in sumac flavored water.

===Seafood===

There are also seafood variants of dolma. Stuffed mussels or Midye dolma may be filled with rice, onion, black pepper and pimento spice.

The filling for &quot;kalamar dolma&quot; (stuffed calamari) is made from Halloumi cheese, onion, fresh breadcrumbs, garlic and parsley. The whole tentacle is stuffed with the mixture and fried in a butter, olive oil and tomato sauce. For another variation a whole small squid may be stuffed with a bulgur and fresh herb mixture and baked in the oven.

&quot;Uskumru dolma&quot; (stuffed mackerel) is a staple of Istanbul cuisine. The version that was traditionally prepared by Armenian cooks is particularly well-regarded. After the fish is prepared by carefully separating the skin from the meat, the meat is sauteed with onions, currants, dried apricots, almonds, hazelnuts, pine nuts, walnuts, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, ginger, fresh herbs and lemon juice. The entire mixture is stuffed into the whole, intact skin. The stuffed mackerel is then either baked or preferably grilled long enough to brown the skin.

Sardines (&quot;sardalya&quot;) may be stuffed with a filling of kashar cheese, tomato, onion, dill and parsley. In Turkey, stuffed sardines may be served as a mezze platter at traditional taverns called &quot;meyhane&quot;.

===Offal===
There are several varieties of dolma made with offal. &quot;Dalak dolması&quot;, widely considered a delicacy of Armenian origin, is spleen stuffed with rice that has been seasoned with allspice, salt, pepper, mint, parsley and onion. It may be served an accompaniment with anise-flavored liquor like arak, rakı, ouzo or oghi.

&quot;Mumbar dolma&quot; is intestine stuffed with a moist mixture of ground meat, rice, pepper, cumin and salt. The stuffed intestine is then boiled in water until it is cooked thoroughly, after which it may be sliced and fried in butter before serving.

===Fruit-based dolmas===
There are some fruit-based dolmas as well like &quot;şekerli ayva dolması&quot; (stuffed quinces with a rice and currant filling, flavored with coriander, cinnamon and sugar) and &quot;pekmezli ayva dolması&quot; (meat and bulgur stuffed quince flavored with a traditional Turkish syrup, similar to molasses, called &quot;pekmez&quot;). &quot;Pekmez&quot; is also an ingredient in the meat-based variants of &quot;elma dolması&quot; (stuffed apples) and &quot;sarı erık dolması&quot; (stuffed yellow plums). Iranian Azerbaijanis and Persian Jews may serve stuffed quince, called &quot;dolma bay&quot;, as a Sabbath meal or during Sukkot.

One filling for stuffed apples is made from a high-quality cubed lamb shoulder called &quot;kuşbaşı&quot;, ground lamb, and rice. First black grapes are boiled together with sumac—the resulting sumac flavored grape juice is drained and reserved. The &quot;kuşbaşı&quot; lamb is cooked in this sumac flavored grape juice. The apples are stuffed with a mixture of ground lamb combined with rice, salt, pepper and layered in a pot on top of the cooked chunks of &quot;kuşbaşı&quot;. The apples are cooked in the remaining sumac flavored grape juice. Dried apricots and blanched almonds are added to the pot near the end of the cooking process. A meatless variant of the filling is made from a sauteed mixture of diced apples, diced pears, walnuts, hazelnut, currants, cinnamon, cloves, and star anise. The hollowed out apples are stuffed with the mixture and baked in the oven. This version may be garnished with powdered sugar.

Stuffed melons were part of the Ottoman palace cuisine. The recipe survives in modern Yemenite and Armenian cooking.

==Religious celebrations and customs==

It is customary for Jewish families to eat stuffed cabbage on &quot;Simchat Torah&quot;.

Assyrians prepare meatless dolmas for Lent. When traditional ingredients are not available, the Armenian Christian community in West Bengal, India celebrates Christmas with &quot;potoler dorma&quot;, a local variation from Anglo-Indian cuisine. Stuffed vegetables called &quot;gemista&quot; or &quot;tsounidis&quot; are also common in Greek cuisine.

Muslim families often serve dolma as part of the &quot;iftar&quot; meal during Ramadan and during the Eid al-Fitr celebrations that mark the end of the holy month. Large pots of dolma are prepared during the Novruz festival.

<doc id="875142" wikidata="Q28129953" url="?curid=875142" title="Liberalism in Austria">
<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in [[Austria]]. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had representation in parliament. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

==History until 1945==
In the Austrian Empire a national liberal current evolved in the 19th century. Liberalism in Austria reached its peak at the time of the 1848 revolution, when civil liberty and a written constitution for the Austrian Empire were key demands of the revolutionary movement. At some time afterwards, Liberals gained some influence on the policy of the government; for example, Anton von Schmerling became Minister for Justice. The liberal Constitutional Party, also known as the &quot;German-Liberal Party&quot;, had a majority in the Austrian parliament from 1867 to 1879. It supported the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 which transformed the Empire of Austria into the Austro-Hungarian Dual monarchy and the 1867 December Constitution. The panic of 1873 and the Long Depression led to strongly anti-capitalist and anti-liberal sentiments and the liberal movement in Austria began to decline, with pan-German nationalistic ideas and parties gaining strength at the same time. Later attempts to reorganize liberalism were unsuccessful, with its remnants mostly joining forces with pan-German nationalists. 

This traditional association with Pan-Germanism was inherited from Austria-Hungary into the Austrian Republic; the Greater German People&#x27;s Party and the Landbund represented national liberal, anti-clerical and pan-German voters. Both parties lost ground with the rise of Nazism in the 1930s and were later dissolved by the regime of Engelbert Dollfuss.

==History from 1945==
With the foundation of the Federation of Independents in 1949, a predominantly liberal party once again existed in Austria, but it was soon overtaken by nationalist elements and later merged into the Freedom Party of Austria, which was founded in 1955 by former Nazis. The attraction of the party to some of its voters lay in its opposition to both the Catholic clericalism of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party and to the Marxism of the Social Democratic Party of Austria. Liberal politicians gained control over the Freedom Party during the years from 1980 to 1986, when it was led by Norbert Steger. However, its participation in a coalition under socialist Chancellor Fred Sinowatz brought it to the verge of extinction, which allowed Jörg Haider to take control of the party in 1986.

With the support of the remaining Pan-Germans (the appeal of whose own views has an equally small appeal to the Austrian electorate today), he transformed it into a right-wing populist, frequently immigration-sceptic party. The Freedom Party was subsequently expelled from the Liberal International, and the remaining liberals seceded to found the Liberal Forum (Liberales Forum, member LI, ELDR) in 1993. However, when the Liberal Forum lost its seats in parliament in 1999 and became a micro-party, liberalism effectively ceased to exist as a political force in Austria.
In 2012 the social-liberal media, especially Der Standard, states that the Pirate Party Austria could become the new Liberal Forum.

== Today ==
The conservative Austrian People&#x27;s Party labels itself the party of open society in its manifesto. The Austrian Green Party, however, holds the most liberal views on social issues. The Alliance for the Future of Austria which was founded in 2005 as a split-off from the Freedom Party, sometimes considered itself right-libertarian (&quot;rechtsliberal&quot;). 

Other small parties on the liberal spectrum include the Democrats and the Social Liberals.

However, liberalism today is best represented by NEOS – The New Austria. The party calls itself &quot;a movement from the center of the people&quot;. It has been founded in October 2012 and moved into the national parliament less than one year later. In early 2014 – right before starting the election campaigns – they unified with the Liberal Forum and JuLis (Junge Liberale, &quot;Young Liberals&quot;) and form &quot;NEOS – The New Austria and Liberal Forum&quot;.

==Liberal political parties in Austria==

=== Habsburg monarchy and Austro-Hungarian Empire ===
*1861: Liberals from various parliamentary factions united in the Constitutional Party (&quot;Verfassungspartei&quot;), also known as the German-Liberal Party &quot;(Deutschliberale Partei)&quot;.
*1860s: The large landowners&#x27; party split into a feudally conservative wing and a relatively liberal and constitutionalist one, the latter was called the &quot;Constitutionally Loyal Large Landowners&quot; or &quot;Constitutional Landowners&quot; (&quot;Verfassungstreuer Großgrundbesitz&quot;) group.
*1873: A radical faction of the Constitutional Party formed the liberal-nationalist Progressive Club (&quot;Fortschrittsklub&quot;).
*1881: Pro-government members led by Franz Coronini von Cronberg (the speaker of the House of Representatives) left the Constitutional Party to form the Liberal Center &quot;(Liberales Zentrum)&quot;.
*1881: The Constitutional Party merged with the Progressive Club to form the United Left (&quot;Vereinigte Linke&quot;).
*1885: The United Left fractured into a liberal German-Austrian Club (&quot;Deutsch-Österreichischer Klub&quot;) and a nationalist German Club (&quot;Deutscher Klub&quot;).
*1888: The remnants of the United Left merged with the moderate parts of the German Club into the United German Left (&quot;Vereinigte Deutsche Linke&quot;); a little later the Constitutional Landowners joined the group, too.
*1896/97: The United German Left broke apart, its Bohemian members left, the Constitutional Landowners re-established their own parliamentary group. The remainder formed the German Progressive Party (&quot;Deutsche Fortschrittspartei&quot;).
*1911: Various liberal and nationalist elements merged into the German National League (&quot;Deutscher Nationalverband&quot;).
*1917: The German National League broke into many small factions.

=== First Austrian Republic ===
*1919/20–1934 The agrarian Landbund and the German-nationalist Greater German People&#x27;s Party each comprised national-liberal factions and ideas.
*1920: The minor liberal Civic Workers&#x27; Party (led by Ottokar Czernin) won a single parliamentary seat. It merged with the equally tiny &quot;Democrats&quot; to form the Civic-Democratic Workers&#x27; Party, but remained electorally unsuccessful until it vanished around 1927.

=== Second Austrian Republic ===
*1949: With the formation of the Federation of Independents, many liberals became active in this party, but were soon marginalized by the nationalist factions. 
*1955: The Federation of Independents merged into the Freedom Party of Austria (&quot;Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs&quot;, FPÖ) in which the dominance of a larger nationalist over a smaller liberal faction continued. However, the liberal wing (organized in the &quot;Attersee circle&quot;) grew and the FPÖ was admitted to the Liberal International in 1979. After 1986, the FPÖ leadership shifted to right-wing populism and the liberals were marginalized again.
*1991: Some liberal members split from the FPÖ to form The Democrats (initially called &quot;FDP Austria&quot;, modelled on the Free Democratic Party of Germany).
*1993: Liberal dissidents from the Freedom Party of Austria formed the Liberal Forum (&quot;Liberales Forum&quot;). The FPÖ was pressured to leave the Liberal International and the Liberal Forum &quot;inherited&quot; its membership.
*2009: The Young Liberals, previously the Liberal Forum&#x27;s youth organisation, separated from the mother party and ran in the European Parliament election on their own.
*2012: A group of disappointed voters of different parties formed a new party called the NEOS – The New Austria, taking a broadly liberal platform. Less than one year later they entered the national parliament.
*2014: The Liberal Forum and NEOS – The New Austria merged to form NEOS – The New Austria and Liberal Forum. Also the Young Liberals joined the party and renamed to JUNOS – Young liberal NEOS.

<text>The evolution of cetaceans is thought to have begun in the Indian subcontinent from even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla) 50 million years ago (mya) and to have proceeded over a period of at least 15 million years. Cetaceans are fully aquatic mammals belonging to the order Artiodactyla and branched off from other artiodactyls around 50 mya. Cetaceans are thought to have evolved during the Eocene (56-34 mya), the second epoch of the present-extending Cenozoic Era. Molecular and morphological analyses suggest Cetacea share a relatively recent closest common ancestor with hippopotami and that they are sister groups. Being mammals, they surface to breathe air; they have five finger bones (even-toed) in their fins; they nurse their young; and, despite their fully aquatic life style, they retain many skeletal features from their terrestrial ancestors. Research conducted in the late 1970s in Pakistan revealed several stages in the transition of cetaceans from land to sea.

The two modern parvorders of cetaceans – Mysticeti (baleen whales) and Odontoceti (toothed whales) – are thought to have separated from each other around 28–33 mya in a second cetacean radiation, the first occurring with the archaeocetes. The adaptation of animal echolocation in toothed whales distinguishes them from fully aquatic archaeocetes and early baleen whales. The presence of baleen in baleen whales occurred gradually, with earlier varieties having very little baleen, and their size is linked to baleen dependence (and subsequent increase in filter feeding).

==Early evolution==

The aquatic lifestyle of cetaceans first began in the Indian subcontinent from even-toed ungulates 50 million years ago, with this initial stage lasting approximately 4-15 million years. Archaeoceti is an extinct parvorder of Cetacea containing ancient whales. The traditional hypothesis of cetacean evolution, first proposed by Van Valen in 1966, was that whales were related to the mesonychians, an extinct order of carnivorous ungulates (hoofed animals) that resembled wolves with hooves and were a sister group of the artiodactyls (even-toed ungulates). This hypothesis was proposed due to similarities between the unusual triangular teeth of the mesonychians and those of early whales. However, molecular phylogeny data indicates that whales are very closely related to the artiodactyls, with hippopotamuses as their closest living relative. Because of this observation, cetaceans and hippopotamuses are placed in the same suborder, Whippomorpha. Cetartiodactyla (formed from the words Cetacea and Artiodactyla) is a proposed name for an order that includes both cetaceans and artiodactyls. However, the earliest anthracotheres, the ancestors of hippos, do not appear in the fossil record until the Middle Eocene, millions of years after &quot;Pakicetus&quot;, whereas the first known whale ancestor appeared during the Early Eocene; this difference in timing implies that the two groups diverged well before the Eocene. Molecular analysis identifies artiodactyls as being very closely related to cetaceans, so mesonychians are probably an offshoot from Artiodactyla, and cetaceans did not derive directly from mesonychians, but the two groups may share a common ancestor.

The molecular data are supported by the discovery of &quot;Pakicetus&quot;, the earliest archaeocete. The skeletons of &quot;Pakicetus&quot; show that whales did not derive directly from mesonychians. Instead, they are artiodactyls that began to take to the water soon after artiodactyls split from mesonychians. Archaeocetes retained aspects of their mesonychian ancestry (such as the triangular teeth) which modern artiodactyls, and modern whales, have lost. The earliest ancestors of all hoofed mammals were probably at least partly carnivorous or scavengers, and today&#x27;s artiodactyls and perissodactyls became herbivores later in their evolution. Whales, however, retained their carnivorous diet because prey was more available and they needed higher caloric content in order to live as marine endotherms (warm-blooded). Mesonychians also became specialized carnivores, but this was likely a disadvantage because large prey was uncommon. This may be why they were out-competed by better-adapted animals like the hyaenodontids and later Carnivora.

===&quot;Indohyus&quot;===

&quot;Indohyus&quot; was a small chevrotain-like animal that lived about 48 million years ago in what is now Kashmir. It belongs to the artiodactyl family Raoellidae, which is believed to be the closest sister group of Cetacea. &quot;Indohyus&quot; is identified as an artiodactyl because it has two trochlea hinges, a trait unique to artiodactyls. Approximately the size of a raccoon or domestic cat, this omnivorous creature shared some traits of modern whales, most notably the involucrum, a bone growth pattern which is the diagnostic characteristic of any cetacean; this is not found in any other species. It also showed signs of adaptations to aquatic life, including dense limb bones that reduce buoyancy so that they could stay underwater, which are similar to the adaptations found in modern aquatic mammals such as the hippopotamus. This suggests a similar survival strategy to the African chevrotain or water chevrotain which, when threatened by a bird of prey, dives into water and hides beneath the surface for up to four minutes.

The first fossils of the Indohyus were unearthed by Indian geologist A. Ranga Rao. He discovered a few teeth and a jawbone amongst rocks that he had collected. After his death, his widow Leelavathi Rao donated the rocks to professor Hans Thewissen. His technician accidentally broke open a couple of the donated rocks and discovered additional &quot;Indohyus&quot; fossils.

===Pakicetidae===

The pakicetids were digitigrade hoofed mammals that are thought to be the earliest known cetaceans, with &quot;Indohyus&quot; being the closest sister group. They lived in the early Eocene, around 50 million years ago. Their fossils were first discovered in North Pakistan in 1979, located at a river not far from the shores of the former Tethys Sea. After the initial discovery, more fossils were found, mainly in the early Eocene fluvial deposits in northern Pakistan and northwestern India. Based on this discovery, pakicetids most likely lived in an arid environment with ephemeral streams and moderately developed floodplains millions of years ago. By using stable oxygen isotopes analysis, they were shown to drink fresh water, implying that they lived around freshwater bodies. Their diet probably included land animals that approached water for drinking or some freshwater aquatic organisms that lived in the river. The elongated cervical vertebrae and the four, fused sacral vertebrae are consistent with artiodactyls, making &quot;Pakicetus&quot; one of the earliest fossils to be recovered from the period following the Cetacea/Artiodactyla divergence event.

Pakicetids are classified as cetaceans mainly due to the structure of the auditory bulla (ear bone), which is formed only from the ectotympanic bone. The shape of the ear region in pakicetids is highly unusual and the skull is cetacean-like, although a blowhole is still absent at this stage. The jawbone of pakicetids also lacks the enlarged space (mandibular foramen) that is filled with fat or oil, which is used in receiving underwater sound in modern cetaceans. They have dorsal orbits (eye sockets facing up), which are similar to crocodiles. This eye placement helps submerged predators observe potential prey above the water. According to a 2009 study, the teeth of pakicetids also resemble the teeth of fossil whales, being less like a dog&#x27;s incisors, and having serrated triangular teeth, which is another link to more modern cetaceans.
It was initially thought that the ears of pakicetids were adapted for underwater hearing, but, as would be expected from the anatomy of the rest of this creature, the ears of pakicetids are specialized for hearing on land. However, pakicetids were able to listen underwater by using enhanced bone conduction, rather than depending on the tympanic membrane like other land mammals. This method of hearing did not give directional hearing underwater.

Pakicetids have long thin legs, with relatively short hands and feet which suggest that they were poor swimmers. To compensate for that, their bones are unusually thick (osteosclerotic), which is probably an adaptation to make the animal heavier to counteract the buoyancy of the water. According to a 2001 morphological analysis by Thewissen et al., pakicetids display no aquatic skeletal adaptation; instead they display adaptations for running and jumping. Hence pakicetids were most likely aquatic waders.

===Ambulocetidae===

&quot;Ambulocetus&quot;, which lived about 49 million years ago, was discovered in Pakistan in 1994. They were vaguely crocodile-like mammals, possessing large brevirostrine jaws. In the Eocene, ambulocetids inhabited the bays and estuaries of the Tethys Sea in northern Pakistan. The fossils of ambulocetids are always found in near-shore shallow marine deposits associated with abundant marine plant fossils and littoral mollusks. Although they are found only in marine deposits, their oxygen isotope values indicate that they consumed a range of water with different degrees of salinity, with some specimens having no evidence of sea water consumption and others that did not ingest fresh water at the time when their teeth were fossilized. It is clear that ambulocetids tolerated a wide range of salt concentrations. Hence, ambulocetids represent a transition phase of cetacean ancestors between fresh water and marine habitat.

The mandibular foramen in ambulocetids had increased in size, which indicates that a fat pad was likely to be housed in the lower jaw. In modern toothed whales, this fat pad in the mandibular foramen extends posteriorly to the middle ear. This allows sounds to be received in the lower jaw, and then transmitted through the fat pad to the middle ear. Similar to pakicetids, the orbits of ambulocetids are on the top of the skull, but they face more laterally than in pakicetids.

Ambulocetids had relatively long limbs with particularly strong hind legs, and they retained a tail with no sign of a fluke. The hindlimb structure of Ambulocetids shows that their ability to engage in terrestrial locomotion was significantly limited compared to that of contemporary terrestrial mammals, and likely did not come to land at all. The skeletal structures of the knee and ankle indicates that the motion of the hindlimbs was restricted into one plane. This suggests that, on land, propulsion of the hindlimbs was powered by the extension of dorsal muscles. They probably swam by pelvic paddling (a way of swimming which mainly utilizes their hind limbs to generate propulsion in water) and caudal undulation (a way of swimming which uses the undulations of the vertebral column to generate force for movements), as otters, seals and modern cetaceans do. This is an intermediate stage in the evolution of cetacean locomotion, as modern cetaceans swim by caudal oscillation (a way of swimming similar to caudal undulation, but is more energy efficient).

A recent study suggests that ambulocetids were fully aquatic like modern cetaceans, possessing a similar thoracic morphology and being unable to support their weight on land. This suggests that complete abandonment of the land evolved much earlier among cetaceans than previously thought. However the scientists involved in the study cautioned that the study was limited by a lack of information on the exact density of the bone, the location of the centre of mass, and the reliance of false ribs for thoracic support.

===Remingtonocetidae===

Remingtonocetids lived in the Middle-Eocene in South Asia, about 49 to 43 million years ago. Compared to family Pakicetidae and Ambulocetidae, Remingtonocetidae was a diverse family found in north and central Pakistan and western India. Remingtonocetids were also found in shallow marine deposits, but they were obviously more aquatic than ambulocetidae. This is demonstrated by the recovery of their fossils from a variety of coastal marine environments, including near-shore and lagoonal deposits. According to stable oxygen isotopes analysis, most remingtonocetids did not ingest fresh water, and had hence lost their dependency on fresh water relatively soon after their origin.

The orbits of remingtonocetids faced laterally and were small. This suggests that vision was not an important sense for them. The nasal opening, which eventually becomes the blowhole in modern cetaceans, was located near the tip of the snout. The position of the nasal opening had remained unchanged since pakicetids. One of the notable features in remingtonocetids is that the semicircular canals, which are important for balancing in land mammals, had decreased in size. This reduction in size had closely accompanied the cetacean radiation into marine environments. According to a 2002 study done by Spoor et al., this modification of the semicircular canal system may represent a crucial &#x27;point of no return&#x27; event in early cetacean evolution, which excluded a prolonged semi-aquatic phase.

Compared to ambulocetids, remingtonocetids had relatively short limbs. Based on their skeletal remains, remingtonocetids were probably amphibious cetaceans that were well adapted to swimming, and likely to swim by caudal undulation only.

===Protocetidae===

The protocetids form a diverse and heterogeneous group known from Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America. They lived in the Eocene, approximately 48 to 35 million years ago. The fossil remains of protocetids were uncovered from coastal and lagoonal facies in South Asia; unlike previous cetacean families, their fossils uncovered from Africa (e.g., &quot;Phiomicetus&quot;, &quot;Protocetus&quot;, &quot;Aegyptocetus&quot;, &quot;Togocetus&quot;) and North America (e.g., &quot;Georgiacetus&quot;) also include open marine forms. They were probably amphibious, but more aquatic compared to remingtonocetids. Protocetids were the first cetaceans to leave the Indian subcontinent and disperse to all shallow subtropical oceans of the world.
There were many genera among the family Protocetidae. There were different degrees of aquatic adaptations in this group, with some able to support their weight on land, and others not. The discovery of the southeastern Pacific &quot;Peregocetus&quot; indicates they crossed the Atlantic and achieved circumstances-equatorial distribution by 40 mya. Their amphibious nature is supported by the discovery of a pregnant &quot;Maiacetus&quot;, in which the fossilised fetus was positioned for a head-first delivery, suggesting that &quot;Maiacetus&quot; gave birth on land. If they gave birth in the water, the fetus would be positioned for a tail-first delivery to avoid drowning during birth.

Unlike remingtonocetids and ambulocetids, protocetids have large orbits which are oriented laterally. Increasingly lateral-facing eyes might be used to observe underwater prey, and are similar to the eyes of modern cetaceans. Furthermore, the nasal openings were large and were halfway up the snout. The great variety of teeth suggests diverse feeding modes in protocetids.
In both remingtonocetids and protocetids, the size of the mandibular foramen had increased. The large mandibular foramen indicates that the mandibular fat pad was present. However the air-filled sinuses that are present in modern cetaceans, which function to isolate the ear acoustically to enable better underwater hearing, were still not present. The external auditory meatus (ear canal), which is absent in modern cetaceans, was also present. Hence, the method of sound transmission that were present in them combines aspects of pakicetids and modern odontocetes (toothed whales). At this intermediate stage of hearing development, the transmission of airborne sound was poor due to the modifications of the ear for underwater hearing while directional underwater hearing was also poor compared to modern cetaceans.

Some protocetids had short, wide fore- and hindlimbs that were likely to have been used in swimming, but the limbs gave a slow and cumbersome locomotion on land. It is possible that some protocetids had flukes. However, it is clear that they were adapted even further to an aquatic life-style. In &quot;Rodhocetus&quot;, for example, the sacrum (a bone that, in land-mammals, is a fusion of five vertebrae that connects the pelvis with the rest of the vertebral column) was divided into loose vertebrae. However, the pelvis was still connected to one of the sacral vertebrae. The ungulate ancestry of these archaeocetes is still underlined by characteristics like the presence of hooves at the ends of the toes in &quot;Rodhocetus&quot;.

The foot structure of &quot;Rodhocetus&quot; shows that protocetids were predominantly aquatic. A 2001 study done by Gingerich et al. hypothesized that &quot;Rodhocetus&quot; locomoted in the oceanic environment similarly to how ambulocetids pelvic paddling, which was supplemented by caudal undulation. Terrestrial locomotion of Rodhocetus was very limited due to their hindlimb structure. It is thought that they moved in a way similar to how eared seals move on land, by rotating their hind flippers forward and underneath their body.

===Basilosauridae===
Basilosaurids and dorudontines lived together in the late Eocene around 41 to 33.9 million years ago, and are the oldest known obligate aquatic cetaceans. They were fully recognizable whales which lived entirely in the ocean. This is supported by their fossils usually found in deposits indicative of fully marine environments, lacking any freshwater influx. They were probably distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical seas of the world. Basilosaurids are commonly found in association with dorudontines, and were closely related to one another. The fossilised stomach contents in one basilosaurid indicates that it ate fish.

Although they look very much like modern cetaceans, basilosaurids lacked the &#x27;melon organ&#x27; that allows toothed whales to use echolocation. They had small brains; this suggests they were solitary and did not have the complex social structures of some modern cetaceans. The mandibular foramen of basilosaurids covered the entire depth of the lower jaw as in modern cetaceans. Their orbits faced laterally, and the nasal opening had moved even higher up the snout, closer to the position of the blowhole in modern cetaceans. Furthermore, their ear structures were functionally modern, with the insertion of air-filled sinuses between ear and skull. Unlike modern cetaceans, basilosaurids retained a large external auditory meatus.

Both basilosaurids have skeletons that are immediately recognizable as cetaceans. A basilosaurid was as big as the larger modern whales, with genera like &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; reaching lengths of up to long; dorudontines were smaller, with genera like &quot;Dorudon&quot; reaching about long. The smallest basilosaurid whale is &quot;Tutcetus&quot; and measures long. The large size of basilosaurids is due to the extreme elongation of their lumbar vertebrae. They had a tail fluke, but their body proportions suggest that they swam by caudal undulation and that the fluke was not used for propulsion. In contrast, dorudontines had a shorter but powerful vertebral column. They too had a fluke and, unlike basilosaurids, they probably swam similarly to modern cetaceans, by using caudal oscillations. The forelimbs of basilosaurids were probably flipper-shaped, and the external hind limbs were tiny and were certainly not involved in locomotion. Their fingers, however, retained the mobile joints of their ambulocetid relatives. The two tiny but well-formed hind legs of basilosaurids were probably used as claspers when mating. The pelvic bones associated with these hind limbs were not connected to the vertebral column as they were in protocetids. Essentially, any sacral vertebrae can no longer be clearly distinguished from the other vertebrae.

Both basilosaurids and dorudontines are relatively closely related to modern cetaceans, which belong to parvorders Odontoceti and Mysticeti. However, according to a 1994 study done by Fordyce and Barnes, the large size and elongated vertebral body of basilosaurids preclude them from being ancestral to extant forms. As for dorudontines, there are some species within the family that do not have elongated vertebral bodies, which might be the immediate ancestors of Odontoceti and Mysticeti. The other basilosaurids became extinct.

==Evolution of modern cetaceans==

===Baleen whales===
All modern baleen whales or mysticetes are filter-feeders which have baleen in place of teeth, though the exact means by which baleen is used differs among species (gulp-feeding within balaenopterids, skim-feeding within balaenids, and bottom plowing within eschrichtiids). The first members of both groups appeared during the middle Miocene. Filter feeding is very beneficial as it allows baleen whales to efficiently gain huge energy resources, which makes the large body size in modern varieties possible. The development of filter feeding may have been a result of worldwide environmental change and physical changes in the oceans. A large-scale change in ocean current and temperature could have contributed to the radiation of modern mysticetes. The earlier varieties of baleen whales, or &quot;archaeomysticetes&quot;, such as &quot;Janjucetus&quot; and &quot;Mammalodon&quot; had very little baleen and relied mainly on their teeth.

There is also evidence of a genetic component of the evolution of toothless whales. Multiple mutations have been identified in genes related to the production of enamel in modern baleen whales. These are primarily insertion/deletion mutations that result in premature stop codons. It is hypothesized that these mutations occurred in cetaceans already possessing preliminary baleen structures, leading to the pseudogenization of a &quot;genetic toolkit&quot; for enamel production. Recent research has also indicated that the development of baleen and the loss of enamel-capped teeth both occurred once, and both occurred on the mysticete stem branch.

Generally it is speculated the four modern mysticete families have separate origins among the cetotheres. Modern baleen whales, Balaenopteridae (rorquals and humpback whale, &quot;Megaptera novaengliae&quot;), Balaenidae (right whales), Eschrichtiidae (gray whale, &quot;Eschrictius robustus&quot;), and Neobalaenidae (pygmy right whale, &quot;Caperea marginata&quot;) all have derived characteristics presently unknown in any cetothere and vice versa (such as a sagittal crest). Mysticetes are also known for their gigantism, as baleen whales are among the largest organisms to ever have lived; they reach lengths greater than 20 m and weigh more than 100,000 kg. This gigantism is directly related to their feeding mechanism – mysticete size has been found to be dependent on the amount of baleen a mysticete can use to filter its prey. Additionally, size is a positively selected trait that gives mysticetes a boost in fitness. Mysticete populations will therefore slowly become even more gigantic as whales with larger amounts of baleen are selected.

===Toothed whales===

The adaptation of echolocation occurred when toothed whales (Odontoceti) split apart from baleen whales, and distinguishes modern toothed whales from fully aquatic archaeocetes. This happened around 34 million years ago in a second cetacean radiation. Modern toothed whales do not rely on their sense of sight, but rather on their sonar to hunt prey. Echolocation also allowed toothed whales to dive deeper in search of food, with light no longer necessary for navigation, which opened up new food sources. Toothed whales echolocate by creating a series of clicks emitted at various frequencies. Sound pulses are emitted, reflected off objects, and retrieved through the lower jaw. Skulls of &quot;Squalodon&quot; show evidence for the first hypothesized appearance of echolocation. &quot;Squalodon&quot; lived from the early to middle Oligocene to the middle Miocene, around 33–14 million years ago. &quot;Squalodon&quot; featured several commonalities with modern toothed whales: the cranium was well compressed (to make room for the melon, a part of the nose), the rostrum telescoped outward into a beak, a characteristic of the modern toothed whales that gave &quot;Squalodon&quot; an appearance similar to them. However, it is thought unlikely that squalodontids are direct ancestors of modern toothed whales.

The first oceanic dolphins such as kentriodonts, evolved in the late Oligocene and diversified greatly during the mid-Miocene. The first fossil cetaceans near shallow seas (where porpoises inhabit) were found around the North Pacific; species like &quot;Semirostrum&quot; were found along California (in what were then estuaries). These animals spread to the European coasts and Southern Hemisphere only much later, during the Pliocene. The earliest known ancestor of arctic whales is &quot;Denebola brachycephala&quot; from the late Miocene around 9–10 million years ago. A single fossil from Baja California indicates the family once inhabited warmer waters.
Ancient sperm whales differ from modern sperm whales in tooth count and the shape of the face and jaws. For example, &quot;Scaldicetus&quot; had a tapered rostrum. Genera from the Oligocene and Miocene had teeth in their upper jaws. These anatomical differences suggest that these ancient species may not have necessarily been deep-sea squid hunters like the modern sperm whale, but that some genera mainly ate fish. Contrary to modern sperm whales, most ancient sperm whales were built to hunt whales. &quot;Livyatan&quot; had a short and wide rostrum measuring across, which gave the whale the ability to inflict major damage on large struggling prey, such as other early whales. Species like these are collectively known as killer sperm whales or macroraptorial sperm whales.

Beaked whales consist of over 20 genera. Earlier variety were probably preyed upon by killer sperm whales and large sharks such as megalodon. In 2008, a large number of fossil ziphiids were discovered off the coast of South Africa, confirming the remaining ziphiid species might just be a remnant of a higher diversity that has since gone extinct. After studying numerous fossil skulls, researchers discovered the absence of functional maxillary teeth in all South African ziphiids, which is evidence that suction feeding had already developed in several beaked whale lineages during the Miocene. Extinct ziphiids also had robust skulls, suggesting that tusks were used for male-male interactions.

==Skeletal evolution==
Modern cetaceans have internal, rudimentary hind limbs, such as reduced femurs, fibulas, and tibias, and a pelvic girdle. &quot;Indohyus&quot; has a thickened ectotympanic internal lip of the ear bone. This feature compares directly to that of modern cetaceans. Another similar feature was the composition of the teeth, which contained mostly calcium phosphate which is needed for eating and drinking by aquatic animals, though, unlike modern day toothed whales, they had a heterodont (more than one tooth morphology) dentition as opposed to a homodont (one tooth morphology present) dentition. Although they somewhat resembled a wolf, the fossils of pakicetids showed the eye sockets were much closer to the top of their head than that of other terrestrial mammals, but similar to the structure of the eyes in cetaceans. Their transition from land to water led to reshaping of the skull and food processing equipment because the eating habits were changing. The change in position of the eyes and limb bones is associated with the pakicetids becoming waders. The ambulocetids also began to develop long snouts, which is seen in current cetaceans. Their limbs (and hypothesized movement) were very similar to otters.
Limblessness in cetaceans does not represent a regression of fully formed limbs nor the absence of limb bud initiation, but rather arrest of limb bud development. Limb buds develop normally in cetacean embryos. Limb buds progress to the condensation phase of early skeletogenesis, where nerves grow into the limb bud and the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), a structure that ensures proper limb development, appears functional. Occasionally, the genes that code for longer extremities cause a modern whale to develop miniature legs (atavism).
&quot;Pakicetus&quot; had a pelvic bone most similar to that of terrestrial mammals. In later species, such as &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;, the pelvic bone, no longer attached to the vertebrae and the ilium, was reduced. Certain genes are believed to be responsible for the changes that occurred to the cetacean pelvic structure, such as BMP7, PBX1, PBX2, PRRX1, and PRRX2. The pelvic girdle in modern cetaceans were once thought to be vestigial structures that served no purpose at all. The pelvic girdle in male cetaceans is different in size compared to females, and the size is thought to be a result of sexual dimorphism. The pelvic bones of modern male cetaceans are more massive, longer, and larger than those of females. Due to the sexual dimorphism displayed, they were most likely involved in supporting male genitalia that remain hidden behind abdominal walls until sexual reproduction occurs.
Early archaeocetes such as &quot;Pakicetus&quot; had the nasal openings at the end of the snout, but in later species such as &quot;Rodhocetus&quot;, the openings had begun to drift toward the top of the skull. This is known as nasal drift. The nostrils of modern cetaceans have become modified into blowholes that allow them to break to the surface, inhale, and submerge with convenience. The ears began to move inward as well, and, in the case of &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;, the middle ears began to receive vibrations from the lower jaw. Today&#x27;s modern toothed whales use their melon organ, a pad of fat, for echolocation.

== Radiation events ==
There are three major radiation events that mark diversification and speciation in the evolutionary history of Cetacea. The first occurred around the middle Eocene (40 Mya) when these early cetaceans abandoned riverine and shallow coastal habitats, setting the scene for Protocetidae – the first fully marine cetacean. With the oceans and its nutrients at their disposal, rapidly diversifying protocetids were also responsible for the first major geographic expansion, dispersing throughout North Africa, Europe, and North America. The second of three major radiation events occurred near the start of the Oligocene (~34 Mya) when Neoceti diverged from Basilosauridae. This radiation event concurrently occurs with the breakup of Gondwana and the opening of the Southern Ocean, wildly changing ocean ecosystems, productivity, and temperature gradients. The timing of this second radiation event is not coincidental, as the following diversification of cetaceans was likely due to new ecological opportunities the change in oceans gave them. The final major radiation event, occurring throughout the middle Miocene and into the Pliocene (12 Mya to 2 Mya), was not due to a specific event but is associated with widespread generic expansion of odontocetes and mysticetes. Some modern genera of cetaceans began to emerge, including &quot;Balaenoptera&quot;, a genus of rorquals that includes the blue whale. Delphinidae, ocean dolphins, also arose during this radiation event in the late Miocene.

== Ongoing evolution ==

=== Culture ===
Culture is group-specific behavior transferred by social learning. Tool use to aid with foraging is one example. Whether or not a dolphin uses a tool affects its eating behavior, which causes differences in diet. Also, using a tool allows a new niche and new prey to open up for that particular dolphin. Due to these differences, fitness levels change within the dolphins of a population, which further causes evolution to occur in the long run. Culture and social networks have played a large role in the evolution of modern cetaceans, as concluded in studies showing dolphins preferring mates with the same socially learned behaviors, and humpback whales using songs between breeding areas. For dolphins particularly, the largest non-genetic effects on their evolution are due to culture and social structure.

Based on a 2014 study, the population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (&quot;Tursiops&quot; sp.) around Shark Bay of Western Australia can be divided into spongers and nonspongers. Spongers put sea sponges on their snouts as protection against abrasions from sharp objects, stingray barbs, or toxic organisms. The sponges also help the dolphins target fish without swim bladders, since echolocation cannot detect these fish easily against a complex background. Spongers also specifically forage in deep channels, but nonspongers are found foraging in both deep and shallow channels. This foraging behavior is mainly passed on from mother to child. Therefore, since this is a group behavior being passed down by social learning, this tool use is considered a cultural trait.

Researchers in a 2014 study in Shark Bay found the fatty acid analyses between the West and East Gulf populations to differ, which is due to the two areas having different food sources. However, when comparing data from within the West Gulf, the spongers vs. the nonspongers in the deep channels had very different fatty acid results even though they are in the same habitat. Nonspongers from deep and shallow channels had similar data. This suggests that sponging was the cause of the different data and not the deep vs. shallow channels. Sponging opened up a new niche for the dolphins and allowed them access to new prey, which caused long-term dietary changes. By producing different food sources within a population, there is less intrapopulation competition for resources, showing character displacement. As a result, the carrying capacity increases since the entire population does not depend on one food source. The fitness levels within the population also change, thus allowing this culture to evolve.

==== Social structure ====

Social structure forms groups with individuals that interact with one another, and this allows for cultural traits to emerge, exchange, and evolve. This relationship is especially seen in the bottlenose dolphin populations in southwestern Australia, which have been known to beg for food from fishermen. This begging behavior was spread through the population due to individual (dolphins spending time around boats) and social (dolphins spending time with other dolphins who express begging behavior) learning.

Culture can, however, impact social structure by causing behavior matching and assortive mating. Individuals within a certain culture are more likely to mate with individuals using the same behaviors rather than a random individual, thus influencing social groups and structure. For example, the spongers of Shark Bay preferentially stick with other spongers. Also, some bottlenose dolphins in Moreton Bay, Australia followed prawn trawlers to feed on their debris, while other dolphins in the same population did not. The dolphins preferentially associated with individuals with same behavior even though they all lived in the same habitat. Later on, prawn trawlers were no longer present, and the dolphins integrated into one social network after a couple of years.

Social networks can still affect and cause evolution on their own by impending fitness differences on individuals. According to a 2012 study, male calves had a lower survival rate if they had stronger bonds with juvenile males. However, when other age and sex classes were tested, their survival rate did not significantly change. This suggests that juvenile males impose a social stress on their younger counterparts. In fact, it has been documented that juvenile males commonly perform acts of aggression, dominance, and intimidation against the male calves. According to a 2010 study, certain populations of Shark Bay dolphins had varying levels of fitness and calf success. This is either due to social learning (whether or not the mother passed on her knowledge of reproductive ability to the calves), or due to the strong association between mother dolphins in the population; by sticking in a group, an individual mother does not need to be as vigilant all the time for predators.

Genetic studies conducted on Clymene dolphins (&quot;Stenella clymene&quot;) focused on their natural histories, and the results show that the origin of the species was actually an outcome of hybrid speciation. Hybridization between spinner dolphins (&quot;Stenella longirostris&quot;) and striped dolphins (&quot;Stenella coeruleoalba&quot;) in the North Atlantic was caused by constant habitat sharing of the two species. Relationships between these three species had been speculated according to notable resemblances between anatomies of the Clymene and the spinner dolphins, resulting in the former being regarded as subspecies of the latter until 1981, and the possibility of the Clymene dolphin as a hybrid between the spinner and the striped dolphins have come to question based on anatomical and behavioral similarities between these two species.

=== Environmental factors ===

Genome sequences done in 2013 revealed that the Yangtze river dolphin, or &quot;baiji&quot; (&quot;Lipotes vexillifer&quot;), lacks single nucleotide polymorphisms in their genome. After reconstructing the history of the baiji genome for this dolphin species, researchers found that the major decrease in genetic diversity occurred most likely due to a bottleneck event during the last deglaciation event. During this time period, sea levels were rising while global temperatures were increasing. Other historical climate events can be correlated and matched with the genome history of the Yangtze river dolphin as well. This shows how global and local climate change can drastically affect a genome, leading to changes in fitness, survival, and evolution of a species.

The European population of common dolphins (&quot;Delphinus delphis&quot;) in the Mediterranean have differentiated into two types: eastern and western. According to a 2012 study, this seems to be due to a recent bottleneck as well, which drastically decreased the size of the eastern Mediterranean population. Also, the lack of population structure between the western and eastern regions seems contradictory of the distinct population structures between other regions of dolphins. Even though the dolphins in the Mediterranean area had no physical barrier between their regions, they still differentiated into two types due to ecology and biology. Therefore, the differences between the eastern and western dolphins most likely stems from highly specialized niche choice rather than just physical barriers. Through this, environment plays a large role in the differentiation and evolution of this dolphin species.

The divergence and speciation within bottlenose dolphins has been largely due to climate and environmental changes over history. According to research, the divisions within the genus correlate with periods of rapid climate change. For example, the changing temperatures could cause the coast landscape to change, niches to empty up, and opportunities for separation to appear. In the Northeast Atlantic, specifically, genetic evidence suggests that the bottlenose dolphins have differentiated into coastal and pelagic types. Divergence seems most likely due to a founding event where a large group separated. Following this event, the separate groups adapted accordingly and formed their own niche specializations and social structures. These differences caused the two groups to diverge and to remain separated.

Two endemic, distinctive types of short-finned pilot whale, &quot;Tappanaga&quot; (or &quot;Shiogondou&quot;) the larger, northern type and &quot;Magondou&quot; the smaller, southern type, can be found along the Japanese archipelago where distributions of these two types mostly do not overlap by the oceanic front border around the easternmost point of Honshu. It is thought that the local extinction of long-finned pilot whales in the North Pacific in the 12th century could have triggered the appearance of &quot;Tappanaga&quot;, causing short-finned pilot whales to colonize the colder ranges of the long-finned variant. Whales with similar characteristics to the &quot;Tappanaga&quot; can be found along Vancouver Island and northern US coasts as well.

<text>Lynn Maurice Ferguson Arnold, (born 27 January 1949) is an Anglican priest and a former Australian politician, who represented the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party, serving as Premier of South Australia between 4 September 1992 and 14 December 1993, during the 11 years of Labor government which ended in a landslide defeat of his government at the 1993 election.

After leaving politics, Arnold worked for World Vision from 1997 to 2007, and for Anglicare SA after March 2008. In November 2013, he was ordained as a deacon in the Anglican Church. In December 2014, he was ordained a priest in St Peter&#x27;s Cathedral, Adelaide.

== Political career ==

Entering in Parliament as member for Salisbury on 15 September 1979, Arnold became a Minister after the election of the John Bannon Labor Government in 1982. He served as Minister of Education, Tertiary Education, Agriculture and State Development. He held the seat of Salisbury until it was abolished on 6 December 1985, and then represented Ramsay from 7 December 1985 to 11 December 1993.

Arnold was elected Labor leader and Premier of South Australia in September 1992, following the resignation of John Bannon after the $3.1 billion collapse of the State Bank of South Australia. However, the change of leader did not appease the simmering voter anger against Labor ahead of a statutory general election due for 1993. A warning sign came at the March 1993 federal election, which saw two of Labor&#x27;s longest-standing federal strongholds fall to the Liberals. Hindmarsh was won by a non-Labor member for the first time since 1919 and only the second time ever, while Grey was won by the conservatives for only the second time in 50 years.

Arnold waited as long as he could, finally calling an election for 11 December. That resulted in the 11-year Labor government being swept out of office in a massive swing to the Liberal Party led by Dean Brown. Labor suffered an 8.9%, 14-seat swing, and its share of the two-party-preferred vote was reduced to 39.1%. That was mainly because Labor was decimated in its long-time stronghold in Adelaide, losing all but nine seats in the capital. Arnold was elected in the newly created seat of Taylor.

Most commentators did not blame Arnold for the landslide defeat and believed Labor would have been heavily defeated regardless of who was leading the party. Almost a year after the election, Arnold resigned as Labor leader, and left politics. He was succeeded as Labor leader by his deputy, Mike Rann, who had earlier succeeded him in Ramsay. Arnold&#x27;s resignation led to a by-election for Taylor on 5 November 1994, at which Trish White retained the seat for Labor.

== Life after politics ==
In August 2003, Arnold received a Ph.D. in sociolinguistics from the University of Adelaide (Graduate School of Education). In his doctoral thesis, he drew a number of conclusions that were based on the study of the language of Asturianu (also known as Bable), spoken in the northern Spanish province known as the Principau d’Asturies.

Arnold was Chief Executive of the humanitarian organisation World Vision Australia from 1997 until 2003. In 2003, he was appointed Regional Vice President of World Vision International for the Asia Pacific Region, based in Bangkok, Thailand. In October 2006, he was appointed Senior Director (Board Development &amp; Peer Review) for World Vision International, heading a team assisting World Vision boards and advisory councils in the development of their governance capacity, and also for administering peer review programs in World Vision partnerships.

On 8 December 2007, the Anglican Archbishop of Adelaide, the Most Revd Jeffrey Driver, announced Arnold&#x27;s appointment as Chief Executive of Anglicare SA, and he served in that role from 18 March 2008 to 30 June 2012. He left to explore ordination to the Anglican priesthood, and was succeeded by the Reverend Peter Sandeman.

Arnold was ordained as a deacon in Adelaide in November 2013. In December 2014, he was ordained a priest by the Archbishop of Adelaide, and is currently serving as Assistant Priest at St Peter&#x27;s Cathedral, Adelaide.

He was chair of the Don Dunstan Foundation from 2010 to June 2020, when Jane Lomax-Smith was announced as the new chair. Arnold remains on the Board as Director and Patron.

<text>The &quot;Altmark&quot; incident (Norwegian: &quot;Altmark&quot;-affæren; German: &quot;Altmark-Zwischenfall&quot;) was a naval incident of World War II between British destroyers and the German tanker &quot;Altmark&quot;, which happened on 16–17 February 1940. It took place in what were neutral Norwegian waters. On board the &quot;Altmark&quot; were roughly 300 Allied prisoners (officially internees), whose ships had been sunk by the pocket battleship &quot;Graf Spee&quot; in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. 

British naval forces cornered the tanker, and later the destroyer HMS &quot;Cossack&quot; boarded the &quot;Altmark&quot; near the Jøssingfjord and liberated all the prisoners. Eight German sailors were killed and ten wounded during hand-to-hand fighting, which took place during the boarding. A British sailor was also wounded during the fighting. The German government claimed that the boarding had been a violation of international law and of Norwegian neutrality and later used the incident in the propaganda broadcasts of &quot;Lord Haw-Haw&quot;.

==Background==

In February 1940, the German tanker was returning to Germany with 299 captured British sailors on board. These were prisoners of war who had been picked up from ships sunk by the pocket battleship .

On its way from the southern Atlantic to Germany, the &quot;Altmark&quot; passed through Norwegian waters. International law did not ban the transfer of prisoners of war through neutral waters. On the insistence of British contacts who had been pursuing the vessel, it was investigated three times on 15 February by the Royal Norwegian Navy. First, the tanker was boarded by officers from the torpedo boat HNoMS &quot;Trygg&quot;, off Linesøya, then by officers from the torpedo boat HNoMS &quot;Snøgg&quot; in the Sognefjord, and finally personally by Admiral Carsten Tank-Nielsen and naval personnel from the destroyer HNoMS &quot;Garm&quot; in the Hjeltefjord. In each instance, the men who boarded the ship carried out cursory searches and took the Germans&#x27; word that the vessel was conducting purely commercial business. The British prisoners held in the ship&#x27;s hold reportedly made strenuous efforts to signal their presence, but the Norwegian search parties did not inspect the hold, and allowed the ship to continue on its way.

Following the third boarding, &quot;Altmark&quot; was escorted southwards by the torpedo boats HNoMS &quot;Skarv&quot; and HNoMS &quot;Kjell&quot; and the guard boat HNoMS &quot;Firern&quot;.

==Incident==

&quot;Altmark&quot; was then spotted off Egersund later that same day by British aircraft, which raised the alarm in the Royal Navy. The aircraft were stationed at RAF Thornaby, in the North East of England. After being intercepted by the destroyer , captained by Philip Vian, &quot;Altmark&quot; sought refuge in the Jøssingfjord, but &quot;Cossack&quot; followed her in the next day. The &quot;Altmark&quot;&#x27;s Norwegian naval escorts blocked initial attempts to board the ship, and aimed their torpedo tubes at the &quot;Cossack&quot;. Captain Vian then asked the British Admiralty for instructions, and received the following orders directly from the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill:

The British government made no particular objection to the fact of a prison ship traversing neutral waters. In fact, in official papers regarding the incident, they noted the fact that the Royal Navy had done the same, for example in December 1939, when the cruiser passed through the Panama Canal, which was neutral waters, with German prisoners aboard from the freighter &quot;Düsseldorf&quot;. But the crew of the &quot;Altmark&quot; had gone hundreds of miles out of their way to make the long run through Norwegian waters to Germany. Besides, the Norwegian government had not permitted the Germans to transport prisoners through Norwegian waters (the &quot;Altmark&quot; having falsely claimed to be carrying none), and the crew had been truthful regarding the nature of their cargo and voyage. 

The Norwegian naval forces refused to take part in a joint escort and reiterated that their earlier searches of &quot;Altmark&quot; had found nothing. Vian then stated that he intended to board &quot;Altmark&quot; and invited the Norwegians to take part, but that was also refused. In the ensuing action, &quot;Altmark&quot; ran aground. The British then boarded her at 22:20 on 16 February and, after some hand-to-hand fighting with bayonet, overwhelmed the ship&#x27;s crew and went down to the hold. One of the released prisoners stated that the first they knew of the operation was when they heard the shout &quot;any Englishmen here?&quot; from the boarding party. When the prisoners shouted back &quot;yes! We are all British!&quot;, the response was &quot;well, the Navy&#x27;s here!&quot;, which brought cheers.

This incident is frequently cited as the last Royal Navy action with cutlasses. However, the HMS &quot;Cossack&quot; Association do not believe this to be true. Barton and McGrath, the authors of &quot;British Naval Swords and Swordsmanship&quot;, also think that is dubious and point out that Frischauer and Jackson, the authors of &quot;The Altmark Affair&quot;, interviewed a large number of the crew, none of whom verified the use of cutlasses. Barton and McGrath suggest that idea may have originated from German accusations that the British were &quot;sea-pirates&quot;. However, Jim Rhodes, a former crew member of &quot;Cossack&quot;, wrote in the April 2002 newsletter of the Association that he had witnessed a cutlass being carried by one of the boarding party. Rhodes had not taken part in the action, had watched from B Gun deck and had been too far to identify the cutlass holder. Rhodes stated that four cutlasses had been kept on board for ceremonial purposes.

Seven German sailors were killed, and eleven wounded during the fighting, six seriously. The German dead were buried in Sogndal Cemetery above Jøssingfjord. HMS &quot;Cossack&quot; left the Jøssingfjord just after midnight on 17 February. The Norwegian escorts protested but did not intervene. The official explanation later given by the Norwegian government was that according to international treaty, a neutral country was not obliged to resist a vastly-superior force.

==Aftermath==
The Norwegians were angered that their neutrality had been infringed, as they did not want to be dragged into the war. Nonetheless, the &quot;Altmark&quot; incident sowed doubts about Norwegian neutrality among the Allies and in Germany. Adolf Hitler, who earlier had decided on 14 December 1939 on the invasion of Norway after discussions with Admiral Erich Raeder and Vidkun Quisling, ordered intensified planning on 19 February 1940 for attacks on Norway and Denmark, which eventually took place on 9 April 1940 under the code name Operation Weserübung. However, as noted by the British politician Maurice Hankey, the incident &quot;does not seem to have given Hitler the pretext he was seeking for launching an invasion of Norway&quot;.

The &quot;Altmark&quot; incident gave the British a short-lived but sorely-needed morale boost during the Phoney War. The incident also had a lasting propaganda effect in German-occupied Norway during the war, when the Norwegian collaborationist government tried to neutralise its nickname &quot;quislings&quot; by using the location of the skirmish, Jøssingfjord, to coin the derogatory term &quot;&quot;jøssing&quot;, referring to pro-Allies and anti-Nazis. The efforts backfired, as &quot;jøssing&quot;&quot; was immediately adopted as a positive term by the general public, and it was banned from official use by 1943.

The phrase &quot;the Navy&#x27;s here&quot; became well known in Britain and was used as the title of a book about the incident; the publisher referred to &quot;the simple statement which stirred the imagination of the world&quot;. A popular song was written by Ross Parker and Hughie Charles and saluted the incident by comparing it with those of Drake, Nelson, Beatty and Fisher.

<doc id="875160" wikidata="Q3020626" url="?curid=875160" title="Dean Brown">
<text>Dean Craig Brown, AO (born 5 April 1943) is a politician who served as the Premier of South Australia between 14 December 1993 and 28 November 1996, and also served as 10th Deputy Premier of South Australia between 22 October 2001 and 5 March 2002, representing the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia. He became premier when he led the party to a landslide win at the 1993 state election, and lost the office when he lost a leadership challenge to John Olsen in November 1996.

==Early life==
Prior to entering politics Brown was a research scientist. Brown holds a Bachelor of Rural Science, Diploma in Business Administration, and he earned a Master of Rural Science at the University of New England.

==Political career==
Dean Brown&#x27;s political career was marked by his rivalry with John Olsen, the two representing the moderate and conservative wings of the South Australian Liberal Party respectively. He was first elected to the House of Assembly for the safe Liberal seat of Davenport in east Adelaide on 10 March 1973, and joined the Liberal Movement faction of the party. He served in the ministry of David Tonkin from 1979 to 1982. After Tonkin lost the 1982 election and retired from politics, Brown ran in the ensuing leadership contest, losing to Olsen. For the 1985 election, an electoral redistribution left both Brown and Stan Evans, the member for Fisher, vying for Liberal preselection in Davenport. In the ensuing factional battle (Evans is a member of the conservative wing), Brown won preselection, but Evans remained in the race as an &quot;Independent Liberal.&quot; At the election, Brown suffered a swing of 30 percent on the primary vote and 24 percent on the two-party vote, enough to lose the seat to Evans.

Dean Brown returned to politics in 1992. The Labor government of John Bannon was embarrassed by the losses of the State Bank of South Australia, but incumbent Opposition Leader Dale Baker was unable to capitalize. Baker resigned and called a spill for all leadership positions. It initially appeared that Olsen, who had been appointed to the Australian Senate after losing the 1989 state election, would return to his old post with little difficulty. The Liberal Party&#x27;s conservative faction persuaded former Deputy Premier Roger Goldsworthy to resign his safe seat of Kavel and hand it to Olsen, and Baker intended to hand the leadership back to Olsen as soon as he was securely back in the legislature. However, a number of moderate Liberals were unwilling to let Olsen take the leadership unopposed. They persuaded leading party moderate Ted Chapman to stand down from his equally safe seat of Alexandra on the Fleurieu Peninsula and hand it to Brown so he could challenge Olsen for the leadership. This allowed both Brown and Olsen to re-enter parliament at by-elections on the same day, the 1992 Kavel by-election and 1992 Alexandra by-election respectively. In the ensuing ballot, Brown narrowly defeated Olsen.

Bannon retired in late 1992 and was succeeded by Lynn Arnold. However, Arnold was unable to change Labor&#x27;s fortunes, and Brown went into the 1993 election as an unbackable favorite to be the state&#x27;s next premier. At that election, Brown led the Liberals to one of the biggest landslides ever recorded at the state level in Australia. They took 14 seats from Labor and won a record 60.9 percent of the two-party vote. They also won all but nine seats in Adelaide, Labor&#x27;s power base for more than half a century—in some cases, taking seats where Labor had not been seriously threatened in decades. At this election, Brown was elected for Finniss, a reconfigured version of Alexandra. With a 14-seat majority—the largest in South Australia&#x27;s history—Brown seemed to be in a formidable position. Indeed, there was talk that the Liberals would be in power for a generation.

However, he had considerable difficulty reining in his large party room, which was torn by the factional battles that have long plagued the SA Liberals. He didn&#x27;t seem to project an image of confident leadership. By late 1996, the Liberals&#x27; poll numbers were in clear decline. Well aware that the Liberals had a year at most to recover before the next election, two prominent moderate backbenchers, Joan Hall and Graham Ingerson, the latter having briefly served as Brown&#x27;s deputy in Opposition, threw their support to Olsen. With Hall and Ingerson&#x27;s backing, Olsen launched a successful party-room coup against Brown in November.
Hall had been a staffer to then Opposition Leader Brown prior to the 1993 election which saw Hall being elected to Parliament. However despite Hall having previously worked on his staff, Brown as Premier did not promote Hall to his ministry and as a retaliation Hall switched her support to Olsen. 

Brown became the first premier to leave office without facing an election since Crawford Vaughan.

As a concession to Brown, Olsen named Brown as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in his government. After the Liberals were narrowly returned at the 1997 election, Brown became Minister for Human Services.

After Olsen was forced to resign as premier in 2001, Brown sought to regain the premiership but lost out to Deputy Premier Rob Kerin. As a concession to Brown, Kerin named Brown deputy leader of the Liberal Party, and hence Deputy Premier. He took on the added portfolios of Disability Services and Ageing. After the Liberal Party lost government at the 2002 election, Brown became Deputy Opposition Leader until 2005 when he announced that he would leave politics at the 2006 election, and resigned the deputy leadership.

In October 2007, Brown was appointed special drought adviser to South Australian Premier Mike Rann.

<doc id="875165" wikidata="Q6540887" url="?curid=875165" title="Liberalism in Armenia">
<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in [[Armenia]]. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had representation in the National Assembly of Armenia.

==Background==
Prior to Armenia&#x27;s independence, a national liberal movement arose in the country. Armenia officially gained its independence in 1991 from the Soviet Union. Following which, there were some attempts to establish a national liberal movement, however, these initial attempts were largely unsuccessful.

==History==
Below is a list of Liberal parties which sought to gain support during the turn of the nineteenth to the twentieth century:

===From Armenakan Party to Democratic Liberal Party===

* 1885: National liberals formed the Armenakan Party.
* 1908: The Armenakan Party merged with a faction of the Reorganised Hunchak Party into the Ramgavar Party.
* 1918: A liberal anti-violence faction of the Reorganised Hunchak Party&#x27; formed the Liberal Party (&quot;Azadagan Party&quot;).
* 1921: The Ramgavar Party merged in exile with the Liberal Party into the Democratic Liberal Party (Ramgavar Azadagan Party). This party continued operating in exile and is said to be represented in the first parliament after Armenian independence in the 1990s.

==Recent developments==
* The 2018 Armenian revolution sparked a wave of protests calling for an end to political corruption and to strengthen democratic values in Armenia. The protests brought an end to the rule of the Republican Party of Armenia, which had been in power from 1995 to 2017.
* During the revolution, the Way Out Alliance had emerged as a liberal political alliance. The alliance had a Pro-European orientation and believed that Armenia should have closer relations with the European Union. Nikol Pashinyan was the main figurehead and leader of the Way Out Alliance.
* Prior to the 2018 Armenian parliamentary election, Pashinyan formed a new liberal democrat alliance called the My Step Alliance. Following the election, the alliance won 88 seats in the National Assembly and Pashinyan was appointed Prime Minister of Armenia on 9 May 2018.
* Meanwhile, Bright Armenia, another liberal party, became the third largest party in the National Assembly following the elections. The party maintained a Classical Liberal ideology. The party opposed Armenia&#x27;s membership in the Eurasian Union and supported Armenia&#x27;s full membership in the EU and wished to begin the first steps of accession negotiations without delay. It is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party. The party is also an affiliated member of the European Liberal Forum through their education program, the Institute of Liberal Politics.
* Following the 2021 Armenian parliamentary election, Nikol Pashinyan&#x27;s centrist liberal Civil Contract party, retained a majority in the National Assembly.
* The Liberal Party was founded in March 2021 and also participated in the elections, winning just 1.17% of the vote.

==European orientation==

* Armenia is a full member of the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights, the EU&#x27;s Eastern Partnership and the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly; all of which support the development and maintenance of democratic values in Armenia. 
* Some other political parties, which do not have current representation in the National Assembly, also advocate for closer European integration of Armenia and strengthening of liberal democratic values in the country. This includes the European Party of Armenia, For The Republic Party, Free Democrats, Heritage, Republic Party, Liberal Democratic Union of Armenia and the Rule of Law Party.
* In November 2017, a new Armenia-EU Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement was signed by Armenia and the EU. The agreement includes provisions to further improve human rights and strengthening democratic reforms in Armenia. The agreement was ratified and entered into force on 1 March 2021.

<doc id="875167" wikidata="Q242027" url="?curid=875167" title="Susanthika Jayasinghe">
<text>Deshabandu Kameradin Susanthika Jayasinghe (; Tamil: சுசந்திகா ஜயசிங்ஹ, born December 17, 1975) is a Sri Lankan retired sprinter, who specialised in the 100 and 200 metres. She won the Olympic silver medal for the 200m event in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, the second Sri Lankan to win an Olympic medal after Duncan White and the first Asian woman to win an Olympic or World Championship medal in a sprint event. She is also the only Asian athlete to have claimed an Olympic medal in sprint events. She is also the first and only Sri Lankan to win a medal at the World Athletics Championships. Her silver medal achievement at the 2000 Sydney Olympics also stood as the only Olympic medal for a South Asian in athletics event for 21 years before Neeraj Chopra&#x27;s gold medal achievement at the 2020 Summer Olympics. She is fondly nicknamed as the Asian Black Mare. She has represented Sri Lanka at the Olympics on three occasions in 1996, 2000 and 2008. She is considered one of the most decorated sprinters in Sri Lanka. However, she is also a deemed as a controversial figure in Sri Lanka.

She became a victim of politics during the peak of her career as many politicians and sports officials attempted to take credit for her medal achievements despite not supporting her prior to competing at the events. She was embroiled in political controversies including a series of false doping allegations, standoff with politicians, seven year old murder trials against her former spouse and sexual harassment. She was also sidelined for major part of her career due to injury concerns and also endured a troubled marriage life.

== Early years==
Jayasinghe was born in Ethnawala, Warakapola, Uduwaka, Sri Lanka. She was born as the fifth and youngest child in her family. She was brought up in a poor family in a small village 60 kilometres north of Colombo, where running spikes cost more than the average month&#x27;s wage, she had no access to proper sports equipment or coaches.

Her father who served as a bus driver at the Ceylon Transport Board had eventually lost his job by the time she was born. The burden fell on the shoulders of her mother who cut rubber trees to run the family. Later on Susanthika too lent a helping hand to her family by rolling beedi. She earned around Rs. 22.50 by selling about 15000 beedis within four days. Despite the financial tussles, she pursued her primary education at the Uduwaka Junior School. She later switched to Athnawala Maha Vidyalaya to continue her studies.

She was encouraged to take up athletics by an army officer who watched her closely when she was running in an inter-school competition at the age of 16. The army officer who watched her event as a spectator recommended her to join Sri Lanka Army soon after completing the school education. She agreed his offer and signed up as a volunteer recruit and also trained hard in athletics while being attached with the army.

She enlisted in the Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force to pursue her athletic career, and was attached to the 3rd Battalion, Sri Lanka Army Women&#x27;s Corps (SLAWC) as a Private. In 1994, she competed in the All Island Athletic Championship from a team from the SLAWC and won the best player trophy.

== Professional athletics career ==
She rose to prominence at the age of 18 after claiming a gold in 200m and a silver in 100m events during the 1994 Asian Junior Championships which was held in Jakarta.

She thereafter joined the Sri Lankan national athletic squad competing in the 1994 Asian Games. She made her South Asian Games debut at the age of 15 during the 1995 edition and claimed gold medals in 100m and 200m sprint events. She also got due recognition for her silver medal performances in 100m events at the Australian Open and Taipei Open in 1995.

She made her maiden Olympic appearance at the age of 20 representing Sri Lanka at the 1996 Summer Olympics and competed in the women&#x27;s 100m event. She clinched silver medal in the women&#x27;s 200m race at the 1997 World Championships. She also became the first Sri Lankan to win a medal at the World Athletics Championships.

With no support from her national athletics association, she had to go heavily into debt to reach the Olympics. She faced severe financial constraints and mental challenges before her journey to the 2000 Sydney Olympics. She even auctioned and sold out all her trophies in order to raise adequate funds to buy tickets with the intention of training in the USA prior to the Sydney Olympics.

She qualified to take part at the 2000 Summer Olympics after winning the 100m sprint event at the National Athletics Championships. Notably, she competed in her first track event at the home soil after a gap of 2 years as she was sidelined for several months after sustaining a hamstring injury.

Just a month prior to the scheduled Olympic event, she bettered her own national record in 200m sprint event twice within just 2 days at the 25th National Sports Festival in August 2000. She also went onto claim gold medals in both 100m and 200m events at the 2000 National Sports Festival in her comeback return to the field after successfully recovering from a hamstring injury which ruled her out for several months.

In the women&#x27;s 200 meters at the 2000 Summer Olympics, she finished behind Marion Jones and Pauline Davis-Thompson to win the bronze medal and became Sri Lanka&#x27;s first Olympic medalist since 1948. On October 5, 2007, Jones admitted to having taken performance-enhancing drugs prior to the Olympics, and Jayasinghe was later awarded the silver medal.

Jayasinghe was suspended from competition in April 1998 for failing a drug test that she claimed was rigged because of her political beliefs and a falling out with a Sports Ministry official. She was later cleared of the offense. During a press conference for the women&#x27;s 200m medalists at the 2000 Olympics, when asked whether her country would be proud of her, she said in a quiet voice:
&quot;I can&#x27;t explain. You wouldn&#x27;t understand. They give me, trouble, trouble, trouble. I give them bronze medal. It&#x27;ll make them sad... It was trouble with me. Doping and sexual harassment.&quot;
She alleged during a live segment on Lasantha Wickrematunge&#x27;s show that the minister S. B. Dissanayake had attempted to sexually harass her. Later, Jayasinghe claimed that she did not specifically accuse Minister Dissanayaka. The television program where Susie made her allegations against S. B. Dissanayake which was aired on TNL TV was suspended after the involvement of powerful politicians.

She then went on to speak of officials coming to her house, giving her a drug test and refusing to seal the urine specimen with her watching. She refused to sign the release. Later they told her she had tested positive for nandrolone. By the time she was cleared, she was no longer welcome by her country&#x27;s sporting establishment.

After returning home with her Olympic medal she was attacked by a male athlete because, she believed, she had been supporting former government members in an election campaign. It was believed that she reportedly wore a yellow ribbon around her wrist during the 2000 Summer Olympics women&#x27;s 200m final and also during the medal ceremony in a show of support for a political movement. The Government of Sri Lanka failed to deliver an hero&#x27;s welcome when she returned from Sydney with her bronze medal and instead the politicians of the government made scathing attack on her.

However, after her medal achievement she was supported by a national fundraising drive in her homeland. She visited Los Angeles to train with Nagalingam Ethirveerasingam (Asian Games Gold Medalist in the high jump in 1958, and two time Olympian in the high jump, in 1952 and 1956). In May 2001, she also underwent a four-month training stint from American coach Tony Campbell before competing at the 2001 World Athletics Championships.

She was the flag bearer for Sri Lanka during the opening ceremony of the 2004 Summer Olympics. She was slated to be on the entry list for the women&#x27;s 100 metres but a fracture in her right leg caused her to pull out from the competition. She continued to struggle with injury concerns throughout 2005 and returned to action in 2006. On her comeback return she claimed gold medal in women&#x27;s 200m event at the 2006 South Asian Games.

Shortly thereafter, she won gold medals in the 100 m and 200 m at the 2007 Asian Athletics Championships in Jordan and a bronze medal in the 200 m race at the 2007 IAAF World Championships. It was her first World Championship medal in 10 years. On 13 August 2007 she was ranked by the IAAF as 18th in the world for the 100 m sprint and 20th in the world for the 200 m sprint.

She also appeared as the flagbearer for Sri Lanka in both the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics. She became the first and only Sri Lankan athlete to have appeared as a flagbearer in two Olympic events.

On February 5, 2009, Jayasinghe announced her retirement from sports in order to focus on becoming a mother. On March 31, 2009, she gave birth to a baby boy.

In November 2010, she announced her plan to return to competition.

== Honours ==
She was awarded the Most Outstanding Sportswoman of the Year in 2008 by the then Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse.

She was conferred with the prestigious Deshabandu title during the 2017 Sri Lankan national honours by the then President Maithripala Sirisena.

== Post-sports career ==
Jayasinghe contested the 2010 general election from the Kegalle district from the United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance, however failed to secure a seat. In 2016, she was appointed as a paid adviser in the Ministry of Sports for selecting and training prospective track athletes. In June 2017, she attempted to sell her silver medal due to suspension of her Sports Ministry pay. She accused the state and government officials of continuously neglecting her despite her Olympic achievement. She has also been a vocal critic of Sri Lanka Athletics Federation administrators over the years for the lackluster performances by Sri Lanka in athletics.

She accompanied the Sri Lankan Athletics contingent for the 2019 South Asian Games where unexpectedly Sri Lanka eclipsed the medal tally of India in athletics events during the Kathmandu South Asian Games and it also marked the first instance of Sri Lanka with a higher medal achievement than India in athletics at a South Asian Games competition after a gap of 15 years.

== Personal life ==
She married her sports trainer Dhammika Nandakumara on 17 November 2000 at the Ambepussa Rest House. Susanthika was engaged to him in 1994 and the official wedding was arranged for them after a gap of six years following the silver medal achievement for her.

In 2016, she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the Diyatalawa Hospital after being diagnosed with dengue. In 2016, her husband was arrested for assaulting her. She was hospitalised and was discharged soon after. She has one son and one daughter.

On 14 September 2021, she along with her two children were tested positive for COVID-19 after undergoing a PCR test.

<doc id="875168" wikidata="Q3182215" url="?curid=875168" title="John Olsen">
<text>John Wayne Olsen AO (born 7 June 1945) is an Australian politician, diplomat and football commissioner. He was Premier of South Australia between 28 November 1996 and 22 October 2001. He is now President of the Federal Liberal Party, Chairman of the Australian American Association, Chairman of the Adelaide Football Club and Deputy Chairman of the Adelaide Oval Stadium Management Authority.

Olsen was twice the parliamentary leader of the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia in the South Australian House of Assembly, from 1982 to 1990 and again from 1996 to 2001. He unsuccessfully led the party to both the 1985 election and 1989 election. After the 1989 election he left South Australian parliament to fill a casual vacancy in the Australian Senate. He returned to the South Australian parliament in 1992, but was defeated for the Liberal party leadership by Dean Brown.

However, in 1996, Olsen successfully challenged Brown for the Liberal leadership, and hence became Premier. He led the party to a narrow victory at the 1997 election, and remained Premier until 2001. He resigned in 2001, after he was found to have misled parliament during the Motorola affair. Olsen is the longest-serving Liberal Party of Australia Premier of South Australia and the fourth-longest-serving Leader of the Opposition.

After politics Olsen worked as a diplomat and political lobbyist. He became the State President of the South Australian Liberal Party in June 2017. He previously held that position from 1976 to 1979. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in January 2007.

==Early life==
Olsen was born on 7 June 1945 in Kadina, South Australia, the son of Joyce Rosalind (née Heath) and Stanley John Olsen, and the nephew of South Australian Politician Leslie Heath. He is of Scottish and Swedish descent. When he was 18, his father suffered a fatal heart attack while driving the family speedboat. He attended Kadina Memorial High School, later completing a certificate in business studies at the University of Adelaide and becoming a fellow of the National Institute of Accountants.

Olsen began his working career in 1962 as a clerk with the Savings Bank of South Australia. He later became managing director of the family business J. R. Olsen &amp; Sons Pty Ltd, a car and machinery dealer. He served as president of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of South Australia from 1974 to 1976.

==Political career==
Olsen was elected to the Kadina Town Council in 1971. He served as mayor from 1974 to 1977, reputedly &quot;South Australia&#x27;s youngest ever mayor&quot;. He was the final mayor before the town was merged into the District Council of Kadina.

In 1976, Olsen was elected president of the Liberal Party of Australia (South Australian Division), serving until 1979. He was first elected to the South Australian House of Assembly at the 1979 election as a Liberal in the Barossa Valley seat of Rocky River. He represented this seat, renamed Custance at the 1985 election, until 1990.

Olsen&#x27;s political career was marked by a bitter rivalry with Dean Brown, the two representing the conservative and moderate wings of the South Australian Liberal Party respectively. After the 1982 election and the electoral defeat and retirement of David Tonkin, Olsen defeated Brown for the state Liberal Party leadership and became Leader of the Opposition. Up against the Labor premier John Bannon, Olsen lost both the 1985 election and 1989 election. In the latter election, the Liberals won a majority of the two-party vote (52 percent) with a five-seat swing. However, most of that majority was wasted on landslides in the Liberals&#x27; rural heartland. Even with the likely support of the one National Party MP, the Liberals were still one seat short of making Olsen Premier.

Olsen resigned as state Liberal leader soon after the election and returned to the backbench. He was appointed to the Australian Senate in 1990 to fill a casual vacancy caused by the resignation of Tony Messner.

However, in 1992, after less than two years in the Senate, he resigned to return to state politics. The Bannon government was under pressure from the collapse of the State Bank of South Australia. However, Olsen&#x27;s successor as state Liberal leader, Dale Baker, was unable to gain significant ground. Baker resigned as state Liberal leader in 1992 and called a spill for all leadership positions, intending to hand the leadership back to Olsen as soon as he was securely back in the legislature. To facilitate this, former Deputy Premier Roger Goldsworthy, a leading member of the Liberals&#x27; right wing, resigned his seat of Kavel, based on Mount Barker, and handed it to Olsen. However, several members of the party&#x27;s moderate wing were unwilling to see Olsen take the leadership uncontested. They arranged for leading party moderate Ted Chapman to give up &quot;his&quot; seat of Alexandra and hand it to Brown so Brown could challenge for the leadership. Olsen returned to the House of Assembly at the 1992 Kavel by-election, on the same day as Brown at the 1992 Alexandra by-election. This time, Brown narrowly defeated Olsen in the leadership ballot, and thus became premier when the Liberals won the 1993 election in a landslide where the Liberals won 37 of the 47 seats available, the most that any party has won since the abolition of the Playmander. Olsen became Minister for Industry and Minister for Infrastructure until 1997, when a cabinet reshuffle saw him become Minister for Information Technology and Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs.

Soon after taking office, Olsen led negotiations with Motorola to build a software centre in Adelaide. Motorola decided to open the centre in April after winning a number of incentives, including becoming the supplier for a government radio network, and a contract was signed in June. During a September Question Time, Olsen stated that there had been no discussions with Motorola about the radio contract. This statement would ultimately prove to be his undoing.

===Premier (1996-2001)===
By late 1996, however, the Liberals&#x27; poll numbers under Brown were stagnating in the face of factional battles and concerns about the slow pace of reform. With a statutory general election due in 1997, two prominent Liberal moderate backbenchers, Joan Hall (wife of former Premier Steele Hall) and Graham Ingerson (who had briefly served as Brown&#x27;s deputy in Opposition), threw their support to Olsen. With Hall and Ingerson&#x27;s support, Olsen challenged Brown for the party leadership in November 1996. This time, he succeeded and was sworn in as Premier, with Ingerson as his deputy.

During the ensuing 1997 election campaign, most commentators agreed that Olsen lost the leaders&#x27; debate against Labor&#x27;s Mike Rann. The election was extremely close; on election night many Liberals feared that Labor had managed the 12-seat swing it needed to take back government (Labor had taken two Liberal seats at by-elections). Ultimately, the Liberals suffered a 9.4% swing and lost 11 seats, one short of making Rann Premier. Olsen was forced into a minority government supported by National and independent MPs. It was the first time that the main non-Labor party in South Australia had won a second term since adopting the Liberal Party label in 1974. After one of those crossbenchers, former Liberal Mitch Williams, returned to the party in December 1999, Olsen held a one-seat majority for eight months until he expelled longtime Liberal maverick Peter Lewis in July 2000.

====Policies====
Among a number of controversial policies, Olsen&#x27;s government undertook the privatisation of the state-owned electricity industry (ETSA), partly to improve the government&#x27;s parlous financial situation due to the State Bank disaster and partly in response to the introduction of the Australian National Electricity Market, despite promising not to do so at the 1997 election. The fiscal arguments for privatisation were vigorously criticised by a number of economists. Sharp increases in the retail price of electricity, a consequence of the working of the National Electricity Market, contributed to the growing unpopularity of the government.
The management of the state&#x27;s water supply was privatised in 1996 with a $1.5bn 15-year contract being awarded to United Water, a subsidiary of Veolia.

Olsen steered water management and conservation projects, including the recycling of water from Adelaide&#x27;s Bolivar Water Treatment Plant to the Northern Adelaide Plains. He also endorsed and facilitated the Barossa Water Project, a water distribution scheme from the River Murray to the Barossa Valley floor, alleviating the Barossa Valley winegrowers&#x27; water irrigation problems and boosting annual production by $30 million.

While in office, he negotiated a $850 million ‘smart-city&#x27; redevelopment of Adelaide&#x27;s northern suburban area (Mawson Lakes) and facilitated the contract negotiations and construction of the Adelaide-Darwin Rail line.

The Olsen Government also secured major sporting events including the Tour Down Under and V8 Supercar Series. The Tour Down Under has become an economic plus for South Australia generating almost 40,000 visitors and $50million in economic benefit during the annual 5 day event. The V8 Supercar series attracts more than 270,000 attendees most years

He pursued a vigorous program of economic reform through the corporatisation and privatisation of government services which included the single largest public outsourcing project of its kind at the time in the world – the outsourcing of the State&#x27;s water industry, a contract which included the establishment of a private sector water industry.

====Resignation====

In 1998, an inquiry was established into the process of bringing the technology company Motorola to South Australia. The first report prepared by former chief magistrate Jim Cramond cleared Olsen of any wrongdoing. A second report prepared by Dean Clayton, QC, found Olsen had misled parliament, and also found that Olsen had made representations to Cramond that were labelled &quot;misleading and inaccurate&quot;, &quot;dishonest&quot; and had &quot;no factual basis&quot;.

Olsen denied any wrongdoing, saying &quot;...I absolutely refute Mr Clayton&#x27;s assertion. The report clearly indicates there are no criminal activities, no illegal activities.&quot; Nonetheless, amid speculation that he would face a leadership challenge, he resigned as Premier on 10 October 2001. He did not stand for re-election in 2002.

Following the Clayton report, the matter was referred to the then Director of Public Prosecutions, the late Paul Rofe, QC. The Director of Public Prosecutions found no illegal activity and disagreed with some of the findings from the Clayton report. Olsen claimed he was vindicated, noting that two out of three reports had cleared him of any wrongdoing. In 2018 Olsen stated that &quot;I note that the standard I applied to myself at the time seems to have disappeared from modern politics.” 

===Liberal Party presidency===

On 24 May 2017 Olsen announced that he had been asked to stand for the position of State President of the SA Liberals at a party vote on 16 June with cross-factional support, after incumbent Steve Murray stood down from the position on 23 May to contest Davenport at the 2018 state election. Olsen was successful. He had previously served as state president in 1979, before giving up the post to enter parliament. Olsen stepped down from this role in September 2020. Prior to becoming Liberal Party President, Olsen was a registered political lobbyist and had worked with Bespoke Approach as a Special Advisor.

In 2020, Olsen was elected President of the Federal Liberal Party. He was elected unopposed with the support of Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

==Consul-General in Los Angeles &amp; New York==

Since leaving South Australian politics, Olsen was appointed by the Howard federal Liberal government as Australian Consul-General to Los Angeles. On 7 December 2005, his Liberal Party colleague and fellow South Australian, Australian Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer announced that Olsen would become the new Australian Consul-General in New York.

Olsen started G’Day USA in 2004, a week-long program showcasing the best of Australia. The program expanded to New York in 2007 and has become the largest annual foreign country promotion in the United States.

==Football administration==
Olsen was appointed chairman of the South Australian Football Commission in 2010. He played a role in the negotiations to move football from Football Park to Adelaide Oval. He served as president of the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) from 2014 to 2020. He is a life member of the West Adelaide Football Club with whom he was the number-one ticket holder for 17 years.

Olsen is presently the Deputy Chairman of the Adelaide Oval Stadium Management Authority.

On 13 October 2020 Olsen was announced as the Chairman of the board of directors of the Adelaide Football Club, one of two Adelaide-based professional Australian rules football clubs participating in the Australian Football League (AFL).

==Personal life==
Olsen married Julie Abbott in 1968, with whom he had two sons and a daughter.

<doc id="875172" wikidata="Q3434193" url="?curid=875172" title="Rob Kerin">
<text>Robert Gerard Kerin (born 4 January 1954) is a former South Australian politician who was the Premier of South Australia from 22 October 2001 to 5 March 2002, representing the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia. He was also Deputy Premier of South Australia from 7 July 1998 until he became Premier and, after losing government, leader of the opposition until after the 2006 election.

==Early life==
Born to parents Maurice and Molly Kerin in Crystal Brook, Kerin attended the Adelaide Catholic secondary school, Sacred Heart College Senior.

==Parliament==
Kerin was elected to parliament in 1993 as the member for the mid-north rural electoral district of Frome. Between 1995 and 2001 he held various ministries in the Brown and Olsen governments: Primary Industries, Natural Resources and Regional Development, Minerals and Energy, State Development, Tourism and Multicultural Affairs. Following the resignation of Deputy Premier Graham Ingerson in 1998, Kerin succeeded him.

===Premier===
Olsen was forced to resign from the premiership after misleading parliament which would come to be known as the Motorola affair. Kerin narrowly defeated former premier Dean Brown to become Liberal leader and premier. Brown was given the role of deputy premier.

Kerin took office less than six months before the 2002 election. At that election, Labor took two seats from the Liberals, one seat short of victory. The result was another hung parliament. While Labor was now only one seat short of a majority as opposed to the Liberals now four seats short of a majority, the Liberals won 50.9 percent of the two-party vote. The balance of power rested with four conservative crossbenchers—one National and three independents. They were initially expected to support the Liberals, allowing Kerin to stay in office with a minority government.

However, in a surprise move, Peter Lewis, who had since been elected as an independent after being expelled from the Liberals in 2000, announced that he and his fellow crossbenchers would support the ALP and its leader Mike Rann to form minority government; in return, Lewis himself wanted to be made Speaker of the House of Assembly. When Kerin learned this, he argued that the Liberals still had a mandate to govern since they had won a majority of the two-party vote. He intended to stay in office unless Rann demonstrated he had a working majority on the floor of the Assembly. On paper, Kerin was well within his rights to take this course of action; convention in the Westminster system gives the incumbent first minister the first opportunity to form a government when no party has a clear majority.

Three weeks of political limbo ended on 5 March. At Kerin&#x27;s request, the House of Assembly was called into session earlier than is normally the case after an election. With Lewis in the speaker&#x27;s chair, Kerin moved a confidence motion in his own government. The motion was defeated, leaving Kerin with no choice but to resign in favour of Rann.

===Opposition leader===
Kerin remained Liberal leader, and hence became Leader of the Opposition. His approach to leadership and parliamentary tactics was more congenial than usual; this led to both praise from those who saw him as a &#x27;nice guy&#x27; and criticism from those who believed his style was ineffective compared to the so-called &quot;media savvy and aggressive&quot; parliamentary tactics of the Rann Labor government.

At the 2006 election the Liberals were soundly defeated, suffering a statewide swing against them of about 7.7 percent. Following that loss, Kerin stood down as Liberal leader, but remained in parliament. He was succeeded as Liberal leader by Iain Evans.

Kerin was the last former head of a main government in Australia to have served as leader of the opposition until Steven Miles became Opposition Leader in Queensland after losing the premiership in 2024.

===Parliamentary resignation===
In 2007, Kerin announced he would not be seeking re-election at the 2010 election. Kerin announced on 11 November 2008 that he would resign from parliament immediately rather than at the next election. This triggered the 2009 Frome by-election. Independent Geoff Brock won the seat in a very close contest, with his presence to later deny the Liberals government at the 2014 election.

<text>Colemanite (Ca2B6O11·5H2O) or (CaB3O4(OH)3·H2O) is a borate mineral found in evaporite deposits of alkaline lacustrine environments. Colemanite is a secondary mineral that forms by alteration of borax and ulexite.

It was first described in 1884 for an occurrence near Furnace Creek in Death Valley and was named after William Tell Coleman (1824–1893), owner of the mine &quot;Harmony Borax Works&quot; where it was first found. At the time, Coleman had alternatively proposed the name &quot;smithite&quot; instead after his business associate Francis Marion Smith.

==Uses==
Colemanite is an important ore of boron, and was the most important boron ore until the discovery of kernite in 1926. It has many industrial uses, like the manufacturing of heat resistant glass.

==Occurrence==
About 40% of the world&#x27;s known colemanite reserves are at the Emet mine in western Turkey. Other important sources in Turkey are found at Bigadiç and Kestelek.

<doc id="875186" wikidata="Q382754" url="?curid=875186" title="Creedite">
<text>Creedite is a calcium aluminium sulfate fluoro hydroxide mineral with formula: Ca3Al2SO4(F,OH)10·2(H2O). Creedite forms colorless to white to purple monoclinic prismatic crystals. It often occurs as acicular radiating sprays of fine prisms. It is translucent to transparent with indices of refraction of nα = 1.461 nβ = 1.478 nγ = 1.485. It has a Mohs hardness of 3.5 to 4 and a specific gravity of 2.7.

Creedite was first described in 1916 from the Creede Quadrangle in Mineral County, Colorado. It is a product of intense oxidation of ore deposits.

==Occurrence==

Creedite is a rare hydroxylhalide mineral. Creedite usually forms from the oxidation of fluorite ore deposits. Creedite was named after the location where it was discovered in 1916 in the Colorado Fluorspar Co. Mine at Wagon Wheel Gap, located at Creede Quadrangle, Mineral County, Colorado.

It was later found in other fluorite veins near Tonopah, Nye County, Nevada; in the Grand Reef mine, Graham County, Arizona; in the Darwin district, Inyo County, California. It also occurs in the Potosi and other mines of Santa Eulalia, Chihuahua, Mexico. It is also found in La Paz, Bolivia; Pamir Mountains, Tajikistan and Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan.

==Geologic association==
Creedite typically occurs with low-grade metamorphic rocks on a fluorite – calcite – quartz matrix or on a sulfide-matrix with its oxidized products. Creedite most commonly found in the form of creedite – carbonate – cyanotrichite – woodwardite – spangolite – kaolinite association. The other less common creedite association is creedite – limonite – kaolinite – hemimorphite – smithsonite – hydrozincite – aurichalcite. Creedite also occurs in skarn formation which usually has association with sulfides, spangolite, brochantite, linarite, limonite, cuprite, wad and kaolinite. In general, creedite usually found as two to three millimeters radial aggregates and less commonly as a single prismatic crystals up to one millimeters long.

==Structure==
Creedite structural composition study was conducted by utilizing 1390 Philips diffractometer with Fe – filtered CoK radiation (λ=1.79021Å), 10–90° 2θ range, peak-height relative intensities. It was concluded that the creedite falls into monoclinic crystal system (2/m) that has space group of C2/c. It was also found that creedite has basal reflections of (2 0 0) and (4 0 0) that are enhanced due to preferred orientation which concur with Michael Fleischer&#x27;s orientation.

<doc id="875187" wikidata="Q2674298" url="?curid=875187" title="Deer Lake, Newfoundland and Labrador">
<text>Deer Lake is a town in the western part of the island of Newfoundland in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.

The town derives its name from Deer Lake and is situated at the outlet of the upper Humber River at the northeastern end of the lake. It is contiguous with two smaller hamlets, Nicholsville and Spillway.

==History==
The first settlers in the area arrived from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia in 1864. Originally loggers and trappers, the settlers later took up farming.

In 1922, a work camp was set up to support the pulp and paper industry in the form of the International Pulp and Paper Company. The camp would later become the town of Deer Lake. A formal townsite was constructed in 1925 and included a railway terminal, churches and a small hospital. The town was incorporated in 1950 with Phil Hodder as its first mayor.

Deer Lake Regional Airport, one of the busiest airports in the province, was built in 1955 and is one of the town&#x27;s major employers. In 2004, the airport terminal was redesign was started, and completed in June 2007. The primary population that the airport serves is approximately 55,000. The airport serves people from Rocky Harbour to Corner Brook, as well as around Deer Lake.

An air raid siren, brought over from England during the construction of the hydro plant in the 1920s, is located at the plant and heard around town. The whistle blows at 7 and 8 AM, at noon and 1 PM, and at 5 and 6 PM. It is heard throughout the community from Monday to Saturday but not on Sunday.

==Name==

The town was named by early settlers of the area. Caribou could be seen crossing the lake in huge quantities. The first Europeans who came to this area, having never before seen caribou called them &#x27;deer&#x27;. However, &#x27;deer&#x27; in older times could simply mean animal. The town was then named accordingly.

==Economy==
The town is located in Division No. 5 and is the gateway to the Great Northern Peninsula, owing to an important highway interchange on the Trans-Canada Highway. It is the closest major community to Gros Morne National Park and is home to the Deer Lake Regional Airport.

A hydroelectric plant was established on the Humber River in 1925 to provide electricity to a pulp and paper mill in Corner Brook. 

==Sights and tourism==
Deer Lake offers accommodation for tourists as well as restaurants, supermarkets, convenience stores and gas stations. There is a stadium, swimming pool and a bowling alley in the Hodder Memorial Recreational Complex. St. Paul&#x27;s United Church, a wooden church dating from 1955 and the modern Salvation Army building are worth a visit.

The town has two major trail systems: namely, the &quot;Deer Lake Beach Trail,&quot; which extends to the north end of Deer Lake, and the Humber River Nature Trail that extends from Nicholsville Bridge to Deer Lake Airport.
The town is often referred to as the Snowmobile Hub of Newfoundland and Labrador because it has the advantage of being located at the center of a network of groomed trails that lead to the deep powder and untouched vistas of the province

The town is home to a number of festivals and events throughout the year, including the Annual Deer Lake Strawberry Festival, Thomas Amusements Fair, and The Deer Lake Winterfest.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Deer Lake had a population of 4,864 living in 2,139 of its 2,309 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 5,249. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Climate==
Deer Lake has a humid continental climate (Dfb) with moderately warm summers that are on the short side, with winters that are moderated by its proximity to a large body of water. With precipitation high year-round, Deer Lake receives plenty of snowfall in winters.

==Transport==
The community is served by Deer Lake Regional Airport, which offers direct flights to St. John&#x27;s, Labrador City, Halifax, Montreal and Toronto. The town is also located on the Trans-Canada Highway, which connects it to the rest of Canada.

<doc id="875188" wikidata="Q605290" url="?curid=875188" title="Ostrya">
<text>Ostrya is a genus of eight to 10 small deciduous trees belonging to the birch family Betulaceae. Common names include hop-hornbeam and hophornbeam. It may also be called ironwood, a name shared with a number of other plants.

The genus is native in southern Europe, southwest and eastern Asia, and North and Central America. They have a conical or irregular crown and a scaly, rough bark. They have alternate and double-toothed birch-like leaves 3–10 cm long. The flowers are produced in spring, with male catkins 5–10 cm long and female aments 2–5 cm long. The fruit form in pendulous clusters 3–8 cm long with 6–20 seeds; each seed is a small nut 2–4 mm long, fully enclosed in a bladder-like involucre.

The wood is very hard and heavy. The genus name &quot;Ostrya&quot; is derived from the Greek word (), which may be related to () &quot;shell (of an animal)&quot;. Regarded as a weed tree by some foresters, this hard and stable wood was historically used to fashion plane soles.

&quot;Ostrya&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including winter moth, walnut sphinx, and &quot;Coleophora ostryae&quot;.

==Species==
&quot;Ostrya&quot; has the following species:

<text>Steve Stevaert (; born Robert Stevaert ; 12 April 1954 – 2 April 2015) was a Belgian politician of the Flemish Socialist Party: the SP.A.

==Biography==
Stevaert was born on 12 April 1954, in Rijkhoven. After his studies at the &quot;Hoger Rijksinstituut voor Toerisme, Hotelwezen en Voedingsbedrijven&quot;, Stevaert started as a bar owner in 1972.

Stevaert became politically active in 1982 under the wings of his mentor Willy Claes. Stevaert was elected to the Provincial Council of Limburg from 1985 to 1995. He became mayor and member of the city council of Hasselt in 1995. There he became famous for his policy of free public transport in 1997, which gave him his nickname &quot;Steve Stunt&quot;.

Stevaert was also elected to the Flemish parliament in 1995 and was re-elected in 1999 and 2004. Stevaert served as Flemish minister of Public Works, Transport and Spatial planning from 1998 to 1999 and as Flemish minister of Mobility, Transport and Public Works from 1999 to 2003, when he resigned having become chairman of his party, succeeding Patrick Janssens.

He was chairman from 2003 until he resigned on 25 May 2005, having been appointed governor of the province Limburg, in which function he succeeded governor Hilde Houben-Bertrand. He became the 15th governor, and also the first &#x27;socialist&#x27; governor of this province. Caroline Gennez succeeded him as temporary chairman, until Johan Vande Lanotte was officially elected as the new chairman in October 2005. On 9 June 2009, the day of the Flemish regional elections, Stevaert announced he would step down as governor. He was succeeded by his fellow socialist Herman Reynders.

Stevaert was given the honorary title of Minister of State on 26 January 2004.

In early April 2015, allegations of rape were made public in the Belgian media. Subsequently, on 2 April 2015, the public prosecutor of Hasselt confirmed that Stevaert had gone missing. His body was found that same day around 6:00 p.m. by divers in the Albert Canal near Hasselt.
