<text>A double-decker bus or double-deck bus is a bus that has two storeys or decks. Double-deckers are used primarily for commuter transport, but open-top models are used as sightseeing buses for tourists, and there are coaches too for long-distance travel. They appear in many places around the world but are presently most commonly used as mass transport in cities of Britain, and in Ireland, Hong Kong, Berlin and Singapore.

The earliest double-decker horse-drawn omnibus appeared in Paris in 1853 and such vehicles were motorised in the 1900s. Double-decker buses were popularised in Great Britain at the start of the 20th century and today the best-known example is the red London bus, namely the AEC Routemaster. Double-deckers in urban transport were also in common use in other places, such as major cities of India, but were mostly diminished or phased out by the end of the 20th century. However they remain common in Britain as well as Ireland and Hong Kong, while in Singapore and Dhaka they have been introduced and expanded into large numbers after British colonial rule.

== Overview ==
There are several types of double-decker buses as shown in the imagebox below:
Early double-deckers put the driver in a separate cab. Passenger access was via an open platform at the rear and a bus conductor collected fares. Modern double-deckers have a main entrance door at the front and the driver takes fares, thus halving the number of workers aboard, but slowing the boarding process. The rear open platform, popular with passengers, was abandoned for safety reasons, as there was a risk of passengers falling when running and jumping onto the bus.

==By country==
Cities listed here have double-decker buses as part of their regular mass transit fleet. Cities with only tourist and sightseeing double-decker buses are excluded.

===Europe===
In the European Union, the maximum height for any vehicle is 4 metres, for motor vehicles in categories M2 and M3 and their trailers in category 0 and motor vehicles in categories N2 and N3 and their trailers in categories 03 and 04, in national and international traffic according to Council directive 96/53/EC of 25 July 1996 and in continuity of council directive 85/3/CEE.

The United Kingdom has a triple standard for the double-decker bus: highbridge bus (urban Britain), lowbridge bus (countryside Britain) and 4 metres height coach such as the Neoplan Skyliner that can traverse Europe.

Outside the British Isles in Europe double-decker buses are most prominent in Skopje and Berlin.

====United Kingdom====


The first commercial horse-drawn double-decker omnibuses were introduced in England in 1847 by Adams &amp; Co. of Fairfield, Bow; it was then improved by John Greenwood, who introduced a new double-decker in 1852. William Gladstone, speaking of London&#x27;s double-deck horse-drawn omnibuses, once observed that &quot;...the best way to see London is from the top of a bus&quot;.

Double-decker buses are in common use throughout the United Kingdom and have been favoured over articulated buses by many operators because of the shorter length of double-deckers and larger seating capacity; they also may be safer to operate through narrow streets and round tight corners. The majority of double-decker buses in the UK are between and long, the latter being more common since the mid-1990s, though there are three-axle models in service with some operators. Double-decker coaches in the UK have traditionally been in length, though many newer models are about .

The red double-decker buses in London have become a national symbol of England. Most buses in London, as in the rest of the UK, are double-deckers. A particular example was the AEC Routemaster bus, which had been a staple of the public transport network in London for nearly half a century following its introduction in 1956. The remaining Routemasters were finally retired from general service in 2005 because of the difficulty of accommodating disabled passengers. Transport for London kept these vintage buses in operation on heritage route 15H until 2020, when it was discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The contract expired in November 2020 and was not renewed; in 2021 it was announced that the service would no longer continue. There was formerly a second heritage route (9H) but this ceased operation in 2014 due to low patronage and increased operation costs.

In 2007, a hybrid-powered double-decker entered service on London Buses route 141. By late 2008, more hybrid double-deckers from three manufacturers had entered service in London. A New Routemaster was developed that year and entered service on 20 February 2012. In October 2015, London added five all-electric double-decker buses - the world&#x27;s first - made by Chinese firm BYD.

The maximum permissible length of a rigid double-decker bus and coach in the UK is with 3 axles and metres with two. However, the total maximum dimensions, including trailer or articulated section, in normal circumstances are:

Coaches are normally built to high, while &#x27;highbridge&#x27; buses are normally about taller. Articulated double-deckers are also allowed at a maximum length of .

===== Channel Islands =====
Double-deckers operate in Jersey.

===== Gibraltar =====
In the territory of Gibraltar, Calypso Transport operates using double deckers in red livery. Notably, this is the only British territory in Europe that drives on the right and hence the buses are left-hand drive.

===== Isle of Man =====
Bus Vannin operates about 24 double-deckers on routes all across the island.

====Republic of Ireland====
In the Republic of Ireland, the majority of the buses operated in and around the Greater Dublin area are double-deckers, operated by Dublin Bus. There are 1,000 double-decker buses (second largest in Europe after London) in the company&#x27;s fleet of 1,008 (October 2019). The private operator Go-Ahead Ireland also operate a mixed fleet consisting of both double and single deck vehicles.

Bus Éireann also utilises double-decker buses on some of its commuter routes, such as the Dublin to Wicklow service. Double-deckers are also common on some of the company&#x27;s city routes in Cork, Galway and Limerick. More luxurious double-deckers are used on inter-city routes, such as the X1 Dublin-Belfast or X3/X4 Dublin-Derry routes.

====Austria====
Double decker buses were in use on city services in Vienna between 1960 and 1991. They are used on services between Vienna and its airport, and also operated by Ötztaler Verkehrsgesellschaft (ÖVG) under contract to ÖBB-Postbus on service 4420 between Innsbruck and Lienz.

====Czech Republic====
Since 2020, two Scania UNVI Urbis DD CNG buses have been running on public transport lines in Ostrava. During working days on line 78. Over the weekend and holidays during the summer season on line 88.

====Denmark====
Since 1970, various operators of Copenhagen city transport were using double-deckers—originally Leyland, in the 1980s–1990s MAN and in the 2000s Volvo, derivates of model B7.

====Finland====
Double-decker buses are relatively rare in Finland, but there are known to be at least four Routemasters in Finland: one in Helsinki, one in Heinola, one in summer tourist charter in Espoo and one in summer tourist traffic in Kuopio. In the autumn of 2019, Public Transport of Turku, also known as &quot;Föli&quot;, was the first city to officially incorporate double-decker buses into local traffic.

====France====
The first French double-decker bus was brought into service in Paris in 1853; it was a horse-drawn omnibus. The upper floor was cheaper and often uncovered.

The first double-decker motor bus in Paris, the Schneider Brillié P2, appeared in 1906. It was designed to carry more passengers and to replace the horse-drawn double-decker omnibus. Like trams and omnibuses, double-decker motor buses included two classes of travel: first class inside the car and second class outdoors on top. But this type of vehicle was withdrawn in 1911 because one of them overturned at place de l&#x27;Étoile; following this incident the P2s lost their upper deck and were renamed P3s.

It was not until 1966 that the RATP re-tried double-deckers on two lines in Paris. A prototype built by Berliet (type E-PCMR), was put into service in 1966, with an order being placed for 25 vehicles. The first production car was commissioned on 19 June 1968 for line 94, Gare Montparnasse - Levallois. On 17 February 1969, line 53, Opera - Porte d&#x27;Asnieres was in turn equipped with this model. But traffic problems caused RATP to definitively abandon this vehicle in 1977, because this type of bus was found to be poorly suited to the structure of the Paris network, the stops being too close to each other, preventing people from going upstairs. Consequently, there are no Parisian bus routes using double-deckers.

SITAC operates a service 5 between Calais and Sangatte using a double decker bus.

====Germany====

In Germany, double-decker buses in Berlin are operated by Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG). Berlin has had the largest double-decker fleet on continental Europe with 197 vehicles operating as of 2023 (compared to 484 single-deckers and 928 articulated buses). However it used to be higher: 1,000 in 1992, reduced to 450 in 2002. The city originally had double-decker buses at least since the 1920s.

The models in operation in 2004 were long and held around 95 passengers. The replacements, which are supplied by Neoman Bus, are longer. The new buses are able to hold 128 passengers.

====Italy====
During the 1960s and 1970s, major cities like Turin, Milan, Rome, Florence, Verona, Bologna, Rimini, Naples, Bari and Palermo adopted Fiat double decker buses.

The most common model was the Fiat 412 Aerfer, and in 1961 it was replaced by Fiat 413 Viberti Monotral CV61.

====Liechtenstein====
Liemobil operates four double decker MAN A39 buses on service 11 between Sargans, Switzerland and Feldkirch, Vorarlberg, Austria and on other services 12, 13 and 14 in the country.

====Netherlands====
It is only very recently that double-decker buses have started to be used in the Netherlands. On 10 December 2017 Connexxion put 18 three-axle double-deckers into service on route 346 between Haarlem and Amsterdam Zuid, a heavily used commuter route not served by rail. They are Futura FDD2s built by VDL Bus &amp; Coach in Valkenswaard, are long, and carry 86 seated passengers. Their introduction was not entirely without issues since their route initially had to be diverted to avoid passing under a dangerously low tram overhead wire near the VU Medical Centre stop.

Also in December 2017, Qbuzz introduced five double-deckers on its route 300 between Groningen and Emmen. These are Van Hool TDX27 Astromegas, also long and carrying 85 passengers.

====North Macedonia====
The Macedonian government bought 217 Yutong City Master double-decker city buses for local transport in Skopje, the capital, built in China&#x27;s Zhengzhou Yutong factory. The buses were put into operation on 8 September 2011, coinciding with the day of Macedonian independence. This model of bus has capacity for 80 passengers. They represent most of the 312 buses currently in operation by the Skopje public transport company.

====Norway====
In June 2008 Boreal Transport on contract with Kolumbus introduced three double-decker buses to provide more seating for certain high-traffic departures in Stavanger.

====Poland====
PKS Szczecin since 2021.

====Portugal====
Double-decker buses were introduced in Portugal during the 1950s when buses in general started to be used in the main cities such as Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra and Setúbal. The types used were the AEC Regent and later the Daimler Fleetline and the Leyland Atlantean, with Portuguese-built bodies. There was also one Leyland Olympian as a demonstration vehicle in Lisbon. In Porto, there were double-decker trolleybuses, produced by Lancia and with Dalfa bodywork, in use from the mid-1960s until the mid-1990s. Double-decker buses were not in widespread use for normal service but were mainly used for sightseeing purposes. 
They were most commonly Portuguese-produced vehicles, including rebodies of regular service buses (for example, the Volvo B10R from Carristur), as well as some from former companies, such as the MAN SD202 from BVG Berlin, many of them still in circulation.

The absence of double-decker buses on regular service lasted until 2011, when STCP acquired 15 double-decker buses, of the type MAN A39 (as used in Berlin). They were introduced at an event by the company, named &quot;Duplex Tour&quot;, on 26 February 2011 and put into normal service on the 28th of that month. These buses can be seen usually on route 500.

====Russia====
Until 2011 double-decker buses were operating in the city of Barnaul. The double-decker fleet consisted of seven MAN SD200 and MAN SD202 second hand buses imported from Berlin. Those buses were used on routes 3, 10 and 17.

In the mid-1990s, some double-deckers were operated briefly in Saint Petersburg.

====Spain====

Double-decker buses were introduced in 2014 in Bilbao by the city bus operator Bilbobus. They are not the first double deck vehicles in the city as ex-London Transport Q1 trolleybuses were sold to Bilbao after the end of London trolleybus operations in 1962 and were operated until the system&#x27;s closure in 1978. Initially, six vehicles are operating on Bilbobus route 56. They have a capacity of 132 passengers - 80 seated and fifty standing.

====Sweden====
Sweden bought in 1965 50 Leyland Atlantean double-decker buses with Park Royal bodies. Leyland claimed they were the first double-decker buses with one man operation. They had two staircases and two pairs of doors. The Atlanteans were not replaced at the end of their revenue service life in 1974. However, in 2011 double-deckers returned to Sweden on revenue duties with VDL Synergy on in the SL 676 Stockholm Östra - Norrtälje line. Norrtälje is located around 70 km north of Stockholm.

====Switzerland====
In Switzerland Postauto operate double decker buses on a route between Engelburg–St Gallen–Heiden routes and in the Obertoggenburg region and in the regions of Rorschach and Goldach. 19 Alexander Dennis Enviro500 have been ordered to operate on these services, which seat 80 passengers and can carry 48 standing. Four double deckers are also operated in Graubünden which are due to be replaced within the next two years.

====Turkey====
In Turkey, the Istanbul public transit system (IETT) runs 89 double-decker buses on longer-distance routes, most notably commuter buses crossing the Bosphorus Bridge linking the European and the Asiatic sides of the city. Double-decker buses are also used on routes to and from Taksim Square to far-flung western suburbs such as Büyükçekmece and Bahçeşehir.

===Africa===
====Egypt====
Several cities in Egypt use double-decker buses as part of their public transportation systems, including Cairo. The MAN Lion&#x27;s City buses, manufactured in Egypt in 2018, were introduced in Cairo to address provide greater capacity on its bus network. Red double-decker buses are also a feature of Alexandria&#x27;s bus network.

====Ethiopia====
In 2017, as part of a larger order of 850 new buses, the city of Addis Ababa purchased a fleet of 50 double-decker buses to operate routes on its public transportation system. Of these, 25 are operated by the Anbessa City Bus Service Enterprise and 25 are part of the Sheger bus company&#x27;s fleet; both are government-owned.

====Kenya====
A fleet of double-decker buses operate in Mombasa, running a route aimed at tourists. The buses are open top, and run on a hop-on hop-off sightseein route around the city; they are manufactured by Yaxing Coach. Since 2014, a double-decker bus owned by the City Shguttle Bus Company also provides public transportation in Nairobi.

====Malawi====
In Malawi, multiple companies utilize fleets of double-decker buses for intercity bus services. Modern Marcopolo buses run direct routes between the nation&#x27;s two largest cities, Lilongwe and Blantyre. New double-decker buses are also in use on more regional routes, including those connecting cities like Mangochi, Mzimba, and Mzuzu.
====South Africa====
Double-decker buses are a feature of a number of transportation systems in South Africa. Johannesburg&#x27;s public bus system, known as Metrobus and operated by the city, has 550 buses that run on 84 routes throughout the city. Of these, 150 are modern double-decker buses manufactured by Volvo, Scania, and Marcopolo. The City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality in Gauteng Province boasts 113 double-decker buses among its public transportation fleet. Golden Arrow Bus Services, the main operator of bus services in Cape Town, is the owner of recently acquired double-decker MAN Lion&#x27;s City buses.

Like in other countries across Southern Africa, double-decker buses are often utilized by private companies for intercity transport connecting major population centers, as well as linking South African cities with hubs in Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. A number of tourism companies offer open top, double-decker bus sightseeing tours of major cities in South Africa.

====Zambia====
Double-decker buses are used by a number of private companies in Zambia for intercity bus services, both domestically connecting Lusaka and other cities across the country and internationally to cities like Johannesburg.

===East Asia===
====Mainland China====
Several cities in continental China have double-deckers in regular use on certain crowded lines, while some have a few double-deck buses in use on lines which also use single-deck vehicles, e.g. Nanning on line 704 in peak hours. Guilin is leading city that operate double-deckers regularly in major routes; in its main street the double-deckers prevails and run one-by-one almost every minute. Besides Guilin and Nanning, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Dalian, Foshan and Kunming also have those buses in service, particularly on routes during rush hours. Larger towns in the developed coastal provinces, including Shaoxing, Zhejiang province, use double-decker buses.

====Hong Kong====

The former British colony of Hong Kong introduced its first double-decker buses in 1949 by Kowloon Motor Bus. They have become very popular since then, and they are found in large numbers among the fleets of the territory&#x27;s major bus operators. By law, double-decker buses in Hong Kong are limited to a length of . , the majority of buses running in Hong Kong are double-decker buses, and all of them are air-conditioned.

Kowloon Motor Bus, which is the largest bus operator in Hong Kong, operates a fleet of 3,752 double-deckers as of 2017, representing 96% of its total fleet. , Citybus operates a total of 950 double-deckers which is also almost all of its fleet.

Hong Kong also has a double-decker tram system, the Hong Kong Tramways, one of only three in the world and the only fleet which is all double-decker.

Discovery Bay Buses, operates MAN Lions City A95s and Volvo B9TLs, for routes such as Discovery Bay to Disneyland MTR Station. The Volvo Olympian was previously used

New Lantao Bus, utilizes a fleet of 59 double decker buses, mainly from the MAN Lions city A95 and the Alexander Dennis Enviro400

Sunbus uses wright streetdecks on routes around Lantao Island and Ma Wan Island

====Macau====
In the former Portuguese territory of Macau, Fok Lei and its successor Transmac used second-hand double-deckers
widely from the early 1970s until the late 1980s.

====Taiwan====
In early 1990s two tri-axle Leyland Olympians were evaluated in Taipei and Taichung. The evaluation was unsuccessful and the buses were sold to Hong Kong for spares.
====Japan====

By Japanese law, vehicles are confined to maximum height and length. Japanese double-decker buses are mainly used for inter-city highway buses (i.e., motor coaches), city tours, and charter buses. In 1960, Kinki Sharyo and Hino Motors manufactured the first original double-decker bus &quot;Vista Coach&quot; for Kinki Nippon Railway (Kintetsu).

In 1979, Chuo Kotsu, a chartered bus operator in Osaka, imported the Neoplan Skyliner. Skyliner, and the other imported buses: Van Hool Astromega TD824, Drögmöller E440 Meteor, and a few MAN coaches inspired Japanese bus manufactures, who developed three domestic models in the mid-1980s: &quot;Nissan Diesel Space Dream&quot;, &quot;Hino Grand View&quot; and &quot;Mitsubishi Fuso Aero King&quot;. They did not, however, sell very well as the ceiling was only high. Nevertheless, Aero King was sold for 22 years, but, being unable to meet exhaust gas emission and safety levels, production stopped in 2005.

In 1982, Toei Bus operated Neoplan Skyliners in Tokyo, between Asakusa and Ueno to 2001. Joban Kotsu operated Skyliners in a trans-Fukushima route: between Iwaki and Aizu-Wakamatsu via Koriyama from 1983 to 1996.

Since the 1990s, JR Buses started to use Aero King for an overnight inter-city highway bus service named &quot;Dream-go&quot;. The first Aero King in Dream-go, operated to &quot;Fuku Fuku Tokyo&quot; between Tokyo and Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi with Sanden Kotsu, which was replaced with a &quot;super high-decker&quot; coach in middle of the 1990s, &quot;Fuku Fuku Tokyo,&quot; and finally stopped in 2006.

Japanese overnight highway buses are mainly equipped with a three-line, two-aisle (1+1+1) seat configuration with reclining seats. When this configuration is used on an ordinary coach, it has 28, 29 or 31 seats. When this configuration is used on a double-decker bus, it has 36 or 40 seats: the vehicle&#x27;s price and capacity increase while operating cost decreases.

JR Bus group mainly uses Aero King, Skyliner, and a few Jonckheere Monaco (equipped with Nissan Diesel engine) for inter-city highway bus operations between Kanto (near Tokyo) and Kansai (near Osaka), which is named &quot;Dream-go&quot; (overnight express) and &quot;Hiru-tokkyu&quot; (Daytime Express). The other bus operators, inspired by &quot;Dream-go&quot;, increased use of the Aero King for overnight inter-city bus service.

JR Bus Kanto imported four Neoplan Megaliner N128/4, leasing two to an operating partner (from 2003 to 2006, Kanto Railway, since 2006 Nishinihon JR Bus). The Megaliner is long, and has 84 seats (with 2+2 configuration), and is operated on an inter-city highway route between Tokyo and Tsukuba, Ibaraki from 2002 to 2005. The Megaliner has also been converted for a low-price overnight highway bus service between Tokyo and Osaka called &quot;Seishun Mega Dream-go,&quot; with special authorisation.

====South Korea====

In 2015, a fleet of 20 double-decker buses was introduced for commuters making the journey between the capital Seoul and its surrounding Gyeonggi Province and nearby Incheon city in 2015 as a pilot project.

====North Korea====
Double deckers started running on Pyongyang streets in the latter half of 2000s.

===South Asia===
====Bangladesh====
The Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation operates a fleet of Ashok Leyland buses on the streets of Dhaka and Chittagong. The majority of buses running in Dhaka are double-deckers, numbering about 445 buses as of 2022.

In 2002, 50 Volvo B10M/Alexander buses were procured to operate in Dhaka and quickly making up most of the fleet, but due to a lack of maintenance and unavailability of spare parts, they were slowly taken off the roads before being completely phased out in 2010. The BRTC has tried unsuccessfully to have them repaired and brought back to service. The company instead purchased 290 double-decker vehicles from Ashok Leyland of India as a replacement.

BRTC had about 399 double-deckers as of 2012. In 2018, the BRTC acquired 300 buses from Ashok Leyland.

In 2020, Indonesian bus manufacturer CV Laksana exported 10 luxury double decker coaches to Bangladesh. These buses were built atop a Scania chassis.

====India====
In India, cities such as Hyderabad, Bangalore, Lucknow, Delhi, and Kolkata had double deckers for a while before discontinuing them. In Delhi, double-deckers were discontinued from service around 1986. Hyderabad operated them until 2003, until it was revived for strictly touristic purposes in 2023. Chennai&#x27;s Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) had a small fleet of double-decker buses, mostly in the high-density, longer distance routes. They operated from 1975 before being wound up. They were briefly reintroduced in 1997 and were operated till 2008.

Mumbai has had double-decker buses since 1937, being the first Indian city to have had it during British colonial period, and it has since become an iconic symbol of the city. About 900 double-deckers were in operation in (then called) Bombay during the 1960s and these buses were modelled like London&#x27;s, but the numbers went into decline in the 1990s. The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST), which operates the city&#x27;s buses, phased out the legacy double deckers in 2023 in favour of modern ones.

Kerala State Road Transport Corporation is operating double deckers in Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi cities. They are modelled on the London buses. Ashok Leyland Titan double decker buses are used in all cities. Articulated double-decker buses from Ashok Leyland were used till they were phased out in the early 1990s as they were thought to be unsuitable for city traffic.
In 2020, West Bengal Transport Corporation reintroduced double decker buses in Kolkata after an absence of 30 years, on routes where wide road space was available, i.e. no over-head cables, low bridges or flyovers.

In 2022, Ashok Leyland subsidiary Switch Mobility introduced its electric double decker, the EiV22 in India. The bus was subsequently inducted into the fleets of BEST in Mumbai, TSRTC in Hyderabad, TMC in Tirupati and Mo Bus in Bhubaneswar. As of end 2023, BEST has 49 of these vehicles in its fleet in Mumbai.

==== Pakistan ====
Certain cities of Pakistan including Karachi and Peshawar had double-deckers in operation from the 1950s until the late 1970s. In Lahore these were Leyland buses operated by the Lahore Omnibus Service. In November 2015, double-deckers were reintroduced to Pakistan but only in the form of a sightseeing service for tourists, operated by Tourism Development Corporation of the Punjab (TDCP), under the name Sightseeing Lahore. The vehicles were imported from China. TDCP started a sightseeing tour in Islamabad and Rawalpindi in 2020 using the same double-decker vehicles.

====Sri Lanka====
In the 1950s, double-decker buses of the South Western Bus Company plied on the Galle Road in Colombo, Sri Lanka. These were taken over by the Ceylon Transport Board (CTB) when all bus services were nationalised in 1958. Beginning around 1959, large numbers of second-hand double-decker buses of the RT, RTL and RTW classes were imported by the CTB from London Transport, and ran in their original red livery with the oval CTB logo painted on the sides. These buses were phased out beginning in the mid-1970s, and none remain in service. Later, around 1985, 40 ex-London Routemaster entered service. One Routemaster bus is run by the &quot;Sirasa&quot; TV and radio station.

Today&#x27;s buses in Sri Lanka include AEC Routemaster (Currently phased out in order to make way for Volvo B9TL/East Lancs Nordic and incoming First Western Dennis Trident 2/Plaxton President - 2001/02), MCW Metrobus (including 12m parts), Leyland Atlantean, and Dennis Trident 2 (1999/2000), plus some of the Volvo B7TL/East Lancs Vyking and Volvo B9TL/East Lancs Nordic buses.

===Southeast Asia===
====Indonesia====
Indonesia first operated its double-decker bus fleet in 1968, with Leyland Titan double-decker bus first operated in Jakarta. The double-decker bus service linked Salemba in Central Jakarta with Blok M area in South Jakarta from 1968 to 1982. Between 1984 and 1996, the Jakarta municipal bus service, Perusahaan Umum Pengangkutan Penumpang Djakarta (Perum PPD) operated a fleet of 180 Volvo B55 double-decker buses, connecting various corners in the city.

The double-decker bus service ceased to operate in 1996 due to aging fleet, lack of spare parts, and there are no plan to renew the double-decker fleet in Jakarta. By that time, the remnant of double-decker bus body were sold and repurposed as bus-themed clothing store in Blok M and restaurant in Senayan (now SCBD) area, but now the establishment has been demolished.

By the early 2000s, the PPD has shifted their bus fleet from European built double-decker buses to cheaper second-hand Japanese buses and imported articulated buses from China. By that time, the double-decker seems to be lost in favour of articulated bus, which provides more exit and entry points to accommodate faster embarkment. By 2004 the TransJakarta bus rapid transit began its service in Jakarta, but uses no double-decker bus and chosen conventional and articulated buses instead.

Since February 2014, the Jakarta Government provides free double-decker bus tours that offers sightseeing in Central Jakarta. The buses&#x27; route covers tourist attractions, such as Monas, Istiqlal Mosque, the Cathedral, National Museum, Sarinah, and Plaza Indonesia, as well as Grand Indonesia shopping centres. As 2016 there are 18 double-decker buses in Jakarta, and the service is expanded to include Kota Tua and Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Senayan area via Sudirman avenue.

Other than the capital Jakarta, there are some cities in Indonesia that have operated double-decker buses, mostly as city sightseeing tour service. They are Bandung, Semarang and Surakarta. The Bandros is a double-decker tourist bus operating in Bandung since 2014.

After the completion of Trans-Java highway section connecting Jakarta and Surabaya in 2018, some intercity bus services began operating fleet of double decker buses. This choice was due to a larger capacity and the available seat space for a more comfortable journey across Java. Previously, the problem with operating intercity double-decker buses was the steep and narrow roads of mountainous interior on Java island. The Trans-Java highway enables a rather straight an even road terrain for smooth travel between major cities in Java.

====Malaysia====
Malaysia has historically seen the use of double-decker buses in mass transit to varying degrees, but were significantly limited in use due operational costs and driving spaces needed for such buses. Early double-decker municipal buses primarily existed in Malaya within the Kuala Lumpur area of Selangor and George Town, Penang between the late 1940s and the early 1960s, when double-deckers were eventually withdrawn in favour of cheaper and more agile single-deck buses.

The earliest recorded use of double-deckers by Malayan bus companies was in Selangor in 1948 when the Toong Fong Omnibus Company acquired two Park Royal-built Guy Arab IIIs at a cost of M$40,000 each; the General Transport Company (GTC) followed by acquiring Park Royal-built AEC Regent IIIs. While the buses saw service for over a decade, all of them were taken out of service for a variety of reasons and were never replaced with new double-deckers; the buses were often obstructed by narrow streets, trees, low bridges, and increasing overhead wires, while passengers eventually favoured staying on the lower deck of the bus; the cost of operating the buses was also higher due to a local vehicle tax calculated based on the number of seats of a taxed vehicle. One Toong Fong double-decker was burned in the late-1950s by communist insurgents, while the remaining double-deckers were ultimately disused by the mid-1960s due to age. The successor of the GTC, Sri Jaya, experimented with a reintroduction of double-deckers in 1989 by leasing a Singapore-assembled, 102-seat Leyland Olympian for use within Kuala Lumpur for 6 months, but found that street conditions were problematic as before and discontinued the use of the bus after the trial.

In George Town, Penang, five retired AEC C1-class double-decker trolleybuses were procured in 1956 by the George Town Municipal Tramways from London Transport as an experiment for the possible use of double-decker buses in George Town. Poor performance results and the advancing ages of the buses, coupled with efforts to replace the entire trolleybus fleet with single-deck diesel-powered buses in the 1960s, led to the withdrawal of the only double-deck buses in early Penangite public transport.

Following increasing public bus ridership, more open roadways and the feasibility of operating double-deck Hop-On Hop-Off tourist buses within Kuala Lumpur, Prasarana Malaysia purchased 40 (revised from an earlier 111) Alexander Dennis Enviro500 double-decker buses in 2014 to serve high volume Rapid KL Rapid Bus routes; with a capacity of 108 passengers each, it is double that of a contemporary single-deck bus in the fleet. The first five buses of the batch entered service in September 2015; with the rest of the fleet gradually added into service in the following months. In November 2019, Prasarana ordered a further 90 Gemilang Coachworks-bodied Volvo B8Ls as part of Rapid KL&#x27;s bus fleet replacement programme, with the first batch of buses entering service in June 2020. Feasibility studies were also conducted by Prasarana in 2015 on the reintroduction of double-deckers in Penang through Rapid Penang&#x27;s bus service. By August 2016, a fleet of three Rapid Penang Enviro500s were officially launched into service, with a total of 33 buses planned. Although plans were reaffirmed in 2017 to expand the double-decker fleet by 30, the existing three Enviro500s were quietly withdrawn from service by 2018 due to operational issues and were subsequently transferred to the Rapid KL fleet.

Beyond mass transit, double-deckers have seen widespread use as long-distance coaches since the late-2000s in response to growing demand for intercity travel, as expressways and outlying bus stops lack physical obstacles that plagued urban bus services.

====Singapore====
There are currently over 2,000 double-deckers in operation in Singapore.

In October 1953, a single AEC Regent III double-decker from the fleet of the Kuala Lumpur-based General Transport Company was sent to Singapore for demonstration. It was used on service by the Singapore Traction Company for two weeks. After that, it was inspected by two Chinese-owned bus companies, and then sent back to Kuala Lumpur. No orders for double deckers were followed all the way until the 1970s.

Sentosa was already operating several ex-London double decker buses such as the AEC Regent III RT, Leyland Titan RTL from 1975 to the early 1980s and subsequently Leyland Olympian from Bexleybus from 1991 to 2007. They were followed by Volvo B7R Open Top double deckers from 2006 to 2015 until they were modified and converted back to single-deck. The first bus route to Sentosa, service 123 also had used double decker buses from 30 July 2017.

Normal double-decker buses were re-introduced into the Singapore&#x27;s public bus system on 13 June 1977 when Singapore Bus Service (SBS, present-day SBS Transit), introduced 20 Leyland Atlantean AN68 buses on route 86 which was launched by then-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Communications Ong Teng Cheong that day, with the success, SBS had purchased 500 Leyland Atlantean AN68, 200 Mercedes-Benz O305 and 200 Leyland Olympian double decker buses until 1986 with the Alexander R-type body, while also trialing several demonstrators such as the Volvo B55, Dennis Dominator, Scania BR112DH and Volvo B10MD Citybus concurrently. The next batch of double-deck buses was introduced from 1984 to 1986 and consists of the Mercedes-Benz O305 and the Leyland Olympian, both of which were bodied by Walter Alexander Coachbuilders with an R-type body.

In 1993, the first air-conditioned (as opposed to the average length then) double-decker bus, the Leyland Olympian 3-axle was launched as the &quot;Superbus&quot;. The original 200 &quot;Superbuses&quot; were followed by an additional 471 Volvo Olympian 3-axle &quot;Superbuses&quot; and 100 non air-conditioned Volvo Olympian buses from 1994 to 2000. The Volvo B10TL, the first stepless, ultra-low-floor &quot;Superbus&quot;, was launched in 1999 while 20 low-floor Dennis Trident 3 buses followed in 2001. The first wheelchair-accessible double-decker buses, the Volvo B9TL, were introduced in 2006; SBS Transit&#x27;s monopoly on double-decker buses in Singapore ended in 2014 when rival SMRT Buses ordered 201 Alexander Dennis Enviro500 buses and were succeeded by 15 more buses. It was followed up with 16 MAN ND323F A95 buses in 2015, and as of 2023, 542 double deckers are in service. Those are being ordered by LTA, and newer units introduced from 2018 onwards are also Euro VI-compliant and are equipped with USB charging ports and Visual Passenger Information Displays.

Some of the existing double-deckers owned by SMRT Buses and SBS Transit were transferred to new operators Tower Transit and Go-Ahead under the Bus Contracting Model. Subsequent orders of B9TL and A95 buses are being made by the Land Transport Authority, are painted in a lush green livery (rather than the operator-specific liveries of SMRT and SBS Transit), and are used by all operators. Double deckers are prohibited on certain services due to height restrictions, narrow roads and width restrictions.

In March 2017, the first three-door, two-staircase 12.8m long double-decker bus in Singapore was introduced by Tower Transit with the registration plate SG5999Z for a six-month trial period. After the trial, the bus was transferred to SBS Transit. The trial was successful and the Land Transport Authority purchased another 100 3-door double decker buses of the Alexander Dennis Enviro500 and MAN A95 builds in April 2019. In April 2018, SBS Transit introduced into service a single Volvo B8L registered as SG4003D. Fully electric Yutong E12DD double-decker buses were introduced in 2020.

Outside public bus operations, open-top buses are also operated by Big Bus Tours. The New Routemaster from London also visited Singapore twice; once in 2014 and another in 2016.

====Philippines====
Presently double-decker buses are used by the Mall of Asia Arena (Higer KLQ6119GSE3 B91H-series) and the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (King Long XMQ6110GS). Former operators were Manila Motor Company (Matorco), which introduced such buses to the Philippines, and the Metro Manila Transit Corporation (Leyland Atlantean). The first double-decker bus in decades to serve the riding public in the capital region debuted in January 2016, serving the SM City North EDSA-Ayala Center route. It also sports PWD and elderly sitting, a national first. Those were technically the Premium Point To Point buses

In the entirety of Visayas and Mindanao region, Pabama Transport based in Bukidnon province in northern Mindanao was the first bus line to deploy double decker buses (Zhongtong LCK6148H Navigator) which started servicing the riding public in June 2018. It was also the first in the country to field double-decker buses for provincial operations.

====Thailand====
Double deckers are also commonly found in Thailand nowadays. Previously there are Volvo B10M with Alexander bodies available.

====Vietnam====
The first two double decker buses were used for route 06 of Ho Chi Minh City since 3 December 2005 in green color, like many HCMC buses at that time. There were rumors in May 2019 that these two buses will cease their operation, but Head of HCMC Department of Transportation confirmed that the buses will remain in service.

===West Asia===
====Iraq====
First used in 1938 and continued until 2003. They became an icon of the city of Baghdad, and were brought back in 2012 with modern buses. A fare cannot reach more than 45 U.S. cents or 500 Iraqi Dinars. The double-decker buses in Baghdad were the first to enter the Middle East and the Arab world.

====Iran====
The first double-decker bus in Iran was assembled in 1959. One of the most popular double-decker buses in Iran was Leyland Atlantean. There are other examples, tourist double-decker buses being one, in metropolitan cities such as Tehran, Mashhad, Tabriz, the Island of Kish, and more.

====Israel====
In Israel, Egged operated double-decker buses from 1984 to 2013.

First double-decker (built by Neoplan) arrived to Israel on 26 August 1984, and during the trial period it performed 434 test drives on four different lines, passed 195583 kilometers and gathered public attention and interest. Double-deckers were found commercially attractive, and in 1988 an agreement between Egged and Neoplan was signed, ordering first 20 buses, with additional 30 buses ordered in the following year. The double-deckers started to arrive in 1989, and they worked on lines Tel-Aviv—Jerusalem, Tel-Aviv—Haifa, Tel-Aviv—Be&#x27;er Sheba and on Eilat lines.

However, both technical issues (in connection between the engine and the transmission) and religious issues (Haredi Jews had issues with women sitting above and in front of them) led to gradual decline in use of these double-deckers. They were removed from the last major line operating them, the Tel-Aviv—Jerusalem line (480), in the end of the 1990s, worked for some time on local lines in the Shfela region, and in the beginning of 2000s were finally removed from service. Some of the buses were sold to an auto dealer from Jordan, who in turn sold them to Iraq and other countries of the Persian gulf.

In August 2005, three double-deckers returned to service on line 99 &quot;Scenic route&quot; in Jerusalem. These 3 buses were assembled from parts of 7 double-deckers that were still in storage. The operational cost for double-deckers gradually grew beyond the limit when repairs were still attractive, which led to their final removal from service in 2013.

In June 2021, Egged began operating a double-decker bus on route 190 between Rishon Lezion and Tel Aviv. The bus is based on a Mann chassis and a chassis from the Spanish UNVI company, can transport about 90 passengers (73 seated) and is also accessible with a ramp for the disabled. Egged purchased 4 buses of this model.

====Kuwait====
In the 1980s, KPTC took a number of Leyland Atlantean&#x27;s. Since Deregulation one of the other main bus operators Kuwait Citybus re-introduced 56 double deckers built by King Long in 2017.

====United Arab Emirates====
170 Neoplan double deckers are in operation in Dubai.

===North America===
====Canada====
In 2000, the cities of Victoria and Kelowna, British Columbia, placed an order for 10 Dennis Trident 3 buses imported from the United Kingdom, becoming the first cities in North America to use modern double-decker buses in their public transit systems. Several more orders have been placed since then, and as of 2017 BC Transit operates 69 double-decker buses, including Trident 3s and the newer Alexander Dennis Enviro500s, of which 62 operate on the Victoria Regional Transit System and the remaining 7 with the Kelowna Regional Transit System. In Victoria, the buses are mainly used on routes that go from downtown to the suburbs, and to the Swartz Bay Ferry Terminal near Sidney, B.C. They can also be found on routes that head to the University of Victoria and the Western Communities, and have proven to be very popular amongst both locals and tourists.

TransLink, the transit authority of Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, tested 2 Enviro500 buses on lines 301, 311, 351, 354, 555, 601 and 620 between November 2017 and March 2018. It was announced soon after that 32 double-deckers will be purchased, arriving in 2019. On 30 October 2019, TransLink&#x27;s first double-decker bus made its first ever run along route 620 from the Bridgeport station in Richmond to the Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal.

From March 2009 to June 2012, three imported Alexander Dennis Enviro500 double-decker buses similar to those in Victoria were used on OC Transpo express routes on the Transitway in Ottawa, Ontario. Delivered in November 2008, these buses proved to be efficient in reducing costs, but their height prohibited their use on many routes. Consequently, these three buses were withdrawn and sold to Victoria in late 2012 after a new series of 75 Enviro500 buses with a lower height that met MTO regulations entered service earlier that year. As of 2018 OC Transpo has 133 of these buses.

GO Transit, a regional transit system serving the Greater Toronto Area in Ontario is the largest user of double-decker buses in Canada, with over 150 such vehicles in service as of 2017. Its fleet comprises Alexander Dennis Enviro500s in a single-door, commuter-type configuration similar to its fleet of highway coaches. The first 22 entered service between 2008 and 2009, with its roof height limiting usage to the Highway 407 corridor. 105 additional buses were delivered between 2012 and 2015 and feature a lower roof height of . The latest series of 253 buses, which is currently built in a local factory in Vaughan, has a roof height of and is expected to replace most of the single-decker coach fleet by 2020, at which point 75% of the active fleet is expected to be composed of double-deckers.

Strathcona County Transit of Strathcona County, Alberta, started a pilot project in September 2010 which explored using different high-capacity bus types to carry more passengers on high-demand commuter routes between Strathcona County and Edmonton. This involved a one-year lease of an Alexander Dennis Enviro500 from the manufacturer. After completing a year of testing between September 2010 and October 2011, a firm order of 14 Enviro500s was placed in 2013 for their service between Sherwood Park and downtown Edmonton, with the first arriving in late August. Five more buses were ordered in 2016, bringing the fleet of double-deckers to 19 as of 2017. Strathcona County Transit currently has 24 Enviro500s in their fleet.

====Mexico====
The Mexico City Metrobús bus rapid transit system started operating a fleet of 90 Alexander Dennis Enviro500s on its new line 7, along the city&#x27;s boulevard, Paseo de la Reforma, in February 2018.

====Panama====
At least one double-decker bus.

====United States====
With the exception of coaches, double-decker buses are uncommon in the United States. Several private operators, such as Megabus, run by Coach USA, employ double-decker buses on busier intercity routes.

For publicly run transport, articulated buses are generally preferred. Nonetheless, a handful of municipal operators use double-decker buses, primarily on the West Coast.

In Davis, California, Unitrans, the student-run bus company of University of California, Davis, operates six double-decker buses imported from London. One of these buses has been converted to run on compressed natural gas (CNG). There was also the prototype GX-1 Scenicruiser of Greyhound Lines, which enters from the first floor: the second floor contains the driver&#x27;s compartment and more seats.

Citizens Area Transit, the transit authority in the Las Vegas area, introduced a fleet of double-deckers to serve the Las Vegas Strip route in October 2005. The route is branded as &quot;The Deuce&quot;. As of 2009 it serviced eight lines.

In Snohomish County, Washington, Community Transit operates 45 Alexander Dennis Enviro500 double-decker buses, which are used on commuter routes between Snohomish County and Seattle. An initial order of 23 buses went into service in 2011, and a second order of 17 went into service in 2015. Sound Transit, another operator in the Seattle area, bought five double-decker buses through a Community Transit order and began operating their own fleet in 2015. In 2016, a joint procurement between three transit agencies in Washington state ordered additional double-decker buses from Alexander Dennis. Community Transit would order 17 buses, with an option for 40, Sound Transit would receive 32 with an option for 43, and Kitsap Transit would buy 11 of their own.
As of 1 January 2020, Community Transit owns 52 and Sound Transit owns 37. Community transit purchased 23 in 2010 (10800-10822), 22 in 2015(15800-15821), and 8 in 2019(19850-19857). Sound transit purchased 5 in 2015(91501-91505) and another 32 in 2017(91701-91732). One of the 10800s has been retired, bringing the total for Community Transit from 53 to 52.

In San Luis Obispo, California, SLO Transit tested a double-decker bus in late 2008 to see if it would alleviate the over-crowdedness of Route 4. The borrowed bus has been returned, and SLO Transit has purchased one double-decker bus of its own using a combination of Federal, State and local funding. The bus went into operation on 8 September 2010.

In Los Angeles County, California, Foothill Transit uses double-decker battery electric buses as part of its commuter service to the Los Angeles area.

Also in Los Angeles, SCRTD used Neoplan AN 122/3 Skyliners double-decker buses from the late 1970s until 1993.

New York City phased out double-decker buses in 1960. They briefly returned from 1976 to 1978, although they only ran in Manhattan. In 2008 the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) briefly ran a Van Hool double-decker bus on several express routes. However, that year&#x27;s financial crisis meant the end of the trial period. In 2018, the MTA tested another double decker bus, an Alexander Dennis Enviro500 SuperLo, on the X17J express bus route between Manhattan and Staten Island. However, the MTA has no current plans to purchase double decker buses.

In San Francisco, California, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency operated one Alexander Dennis double-decker bus as a demonstrator between 12 December 2007 and 8 January 2008. The bus was running on some high capacity routes as trial.

In California, AC Transit began experimental use of a double-decker bus on the commuter route between Fremont, California, and Stanford University in 2015. On 3 December 2018 the company introduced double-deckers on its FS and J routes from Berkeley to San Francisco, and later added routes L and LA serving Richmond, El Sobrante, San Pablo and Albany.

===Oceania===
====Australia====

Double-decker buses plied route services in Sydney from the 1920s until 1986. Popular makers included AEC, Albion and Leyland. Disputes over one-man operation of double-deckers led to the phasing-out of this configuration. Double-deckers were thereafter limited to charter and tourist services.

Double-decker buses were reintroduced to the Sydney area in 2012, with Busways operating regular services from Blacktown to Rouse Hill, in Sydney&#x27;s north-west. These were expanded in 2013, to traverse routes from Castle Hill and the Northern Beaches to Sydney&#x27;s CBD. Forest Coach Lines and Hillsbus also purchased some. The B-Line service uses an exclusive fleet of 42 MAN Lions City A95s.Forrest Coachlines also ordered 3 Gemaling-Bodied MAN A95s, and the Bustech CDI. Hillsbus operates 26 Bustech CDIs, and Transport Systems NSW took delivery of 3 Gemaling bodied Volvo B8l, in 2022

CDC Melbourne bought 1 volgren Australia bodied Volvo B9TL Melbourne by CDC Melbourne to operate between Werribee, Wyndham Vale and Tarneit railway stations in 2015. this bus was briefly transferred to Sydney, and painted in Hillsbus colours, but was never driven due to axel weight restrictions, and was returned to Melbourne, and is often used on the route 190

Double deck coaches were built by Denning between 1988 and 1992 with AAT Kings, Australian Pacific Touring and Deluxe Coachlines the main customers. The concept was revived in 2011 by Denning Manufacturing. Volgren fitted double deck coach bodies to Volvo B10Ms in the 1980s for Greyhound.

Transperth used to operate an unknown quantity of Denning double decker bus coaches, on a route between Elizabeth Quay Busport and Mandurah, but were phased out with the introduction of the Mandurah line

====New Zealand====
Until 2013–14, double decker buses were used only by tour operators and for long-distance coach services operated by Intercity Coachlines and Manabus. They were not used for public transport on urban routes.

In the 1970s a number of former London double decker buses were imported for museums, such as the Museum of Transport and Technology who used AEC Regent Low Height (RLH) buses to connect museum sites and for charters. Sydney double decker and more London buses of various models (AEC Regent III RT, AEC Routemasters etc.) were imported by charter and tourist operators and slowly became more commonplace. Bridge heights and shop verandas restricted the use of double deckers around New Zealand until congestion and high public transport use required some innovative solutions.

A single double-decker bus arrived in Auckland in early March 2013 for a trial, with more planned to arrive in 2014 if the trial proved successful. The Scania K320UD bus, operated by Ritchies Transport, began revenue service on 11 March 2013 on the well-patronised Northern Express services on the Northern Busway between Albany and Britomart in downtown Auckland. In addition, NZ Bus and Howick &amp; Eastern investigated the use of double-decker buses on the Dominion Road, Mount Eden Road, and Botany to downtown routes. By May 2016, double deckers were running on the busway and on many other Auckland urban routes, operated by several companies, with more to be introduced.

Four 87-seat DesignLine double deckers started on Waikato services in 2018. Since 15 July 2018, double deckers, including some fully electric models, have been operating in Wellington. There are currently 51 diesel double deckers running and 10 electric ones. 34 of the diesel double deckers are euro 6, while the remaining 17 are euro 5.

===South America===
====Argentina====
In Argentina, double-decker buses are the second most widely used means of transport for long-distance trips, surpassed only by aeroplanes. Double-decker buses are also used by tourists in Buenos Aires where they&#x27;re used in city-tours.

====Bolivia====
In Bolivia, double-deck buses are a common means of transportation for long-distance trips between large cities such as department capitals. These buses also connect Bolivia with different countries. The double deck buses travel to Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Chile. The buses are equipped with toilets, and several companies offer buses with large seats called Leito (Bus Cama) that can be pulled back and be shaped into a bed.

====Brazil====
Double-decker buses, built mainly by Comil or Marcopolo, are common in long-distance services interstate and international connecting whole South America. It is possible to see VIP double-decker buses also connecting cities in the same state, such as São Paulo City, São José do Rio Preto and Ribeirão Preto. Inside these buses there are one TV for each person and boarding service for example. Open double-decker are used for city tours (such as Rio de Janeiro and Bahia). In São Paulo, there was an experience of use for urban services in the 1980s, built by Thamco, but without success due to issues with the height of the vehicle. These buses are fabricated in Brazil and exported to many countries.

====Ecuador====
Double-decker buses are used in city-tours in Quito, Cuenca and parts of the coast. They are very popular in the touristic district of the Historic District in Quito. Double-decker buses are common on long distance interurban trips.

====Chile====
The first double-decker intercity buses arrived from Germany at the end of the 1970s to serve national long-distance routes and international services, mainly to Argentina, for the Varmontt, Flota L, Chile Bus and Tas Choapa lines. Since the end of the 1990s, they have become the standard for interurban transport, due to the advantageous cost-benefit ratio for transport companies.

During the decades of 2000 and 2010, the heyday of this means of transport was experienced, which has meant that practically all Chilean intercity bus companies have these buses, this time not of European origin but with bodies in Brazil, Peru, Argentina and some of Chinese Origin. However, on several occasions, the safety and low comfort provided by these vehicles have been a strong subject of discussion; however, the increase in passenger capacity makes them quite profitable for interurban companies.

On 9 March 2017, the British Embassy in Chile reached an agreement with the Ministry of Public Transport in Santiago to test double-decker buses for public transport. That day the first bus, an Alexander Dennis Enviro500 was tested on the streets of Santiago for six weeks.

On 26 February 2019, it was announced that another double-decker bus, a Wrightbus Streetdeck will start to be used in a particular route in Central Santiago. On that day the first bus was tested on Santiago roads.

On 17 August 2023, the first fleet of 10 BYD electric double-decker buses disembarked for public transport that will travel the streets of Santiago de Chile, they are the first double-decker electric buses that currently operate in America and in October 2023 they will be operational to integrate into the public transport network of the Chilean capital.
====Peru====
Double-decker buses are common on long distance interurban trips to main cities of the country. Open top double-deckers are used in city tours in downtown Lima and in the tourist district of Miraflores. Pio Delgado Arguedas bought 300 Greyhound buses and was the distributor of the buses in South America and Mexico. He also created TEPSA, and was the owner for years until he sold his company.

====Uruguay====
Since the 1990s, Uruguay long-distance bus service operators have operated Brazilian double-deckers. Two AEC Routemasters were imported in the 1970s for urban tourism services – one is now held by the transport heritage group ERHITRAN. In the 2010s Montevideo had an urban tourism circuit using open roof Argentinian double-deckers (suspended with the COVID-19 lockdowns).

==Triple-decker buses==
There have been attempts to build a triple-decker bus. However such vehicles are problematic in that the high centre of gravity leads to instability and there is the risk of hitting trees or bridges. In almost all models the third level was a small compartment in the rear part of the bus, such as a triple-decker capable of carrying eighty-eight people from Rome to Tivoli in 1932 or the General American Aerocoach 3 Decker Bus of 1952. The only three-decker with a full-length third level ever built is the Knight Bus that John Richardson created for &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; by combining two AEC Regent III RTs. Although the AEC was merely a film prop, a British built ECW bodied Bristol VR double-decker bus imitation of the Knight bus was a functioning bus, which even went on tour. Some buses in Pakistan have a partial bottom level that uses a separate cabin from the upper two levels.

==Comparison with articulated buses==
Operators worldwide must often decide between articulated and double-decker buses on popular routes. Articulated buses, entirely on one level, offer more room for disabled passengers, luggage and pushchairs; they may also be needed on routes going under low bridges or weak bridges that cannot take high axle loads. Double-decker buses, however, have a smaller road footprint and as such disrupt traffic, or block turning lanes, less than articulated buses.

Double-decker buses may be more popular with passengers because of the better view, and with cyclists, who may be at less risk than they are with the unpredictable swing of an articulated bus&#x27;s tail. Articulated buses normally offer more standing room while double-decker buses may sometimes (not always) offer more seats. Articulated buses have less dwell time because of the extra doors, and double-decker buses offer fewer chances for fare dodgers since there are fewer or no unmanned doors.

==Collisions with bridges==
There have been a significant number of incidents in which a double-decker bus has collided with a low bridge, often a railway bridge. This is often caused by the driver making a wrong turn, driving a route they are unfamiliar with, or being used to driving single-decker buses and forgetting to allow for their vehicle&#x27;s extra height when driving a double-decker.

A collision with a railroad bridge by a Megabus in September 2010 at Syracuse, New York, killed four passengers and injured 17.

In recent years in the United Kingdom, six people had minor injuries after their bus hit a railway bridge at Stockport in July 2013. An empty bus had its roof removed after hitting a railway bridge in Birkenhead in December 2014.

In March 2015, a bus carrying 76 children hit a bridge at Staines-upon-Thames. Eleven passengers were taken to hospital but none were seriously injured. In the same month, an empty bus had its roof removed after hitting a railway bridge in Isleworth West London. A Stagecoach Highlands bus collided with a railway bridge at Balloch, Highland, Scotland in April 2015. There were no casualties, one top-deck passenger narrowly escaped injury by throwing himself to the floor.

A bus operated by Bluestar had its roof removed after colliding with a railway bridge at Romsey in May 2015. An incident in July 2015 in Norwood, London also resulted in the removal of the bus&#x27; roof; seven people were injured. Similar incidents occurred in September 2015 in Rochdale, Greater Manchester (seventeen were injured) and in Bournemouth in April 2016, with all thirty passengers escaping without injury.

On 11 September 2020, a bus carrying 72 children hit a bridge, taking the complete roof off, in Winchester, Hampshire, on the way to school. Three children were seriously injured and required surgery whilst a further 12 suffered minor injuries. The bus was operated by Stagecoach South.

In May 2023, ten people were taken to hospital after a bus crashed into a railway bridge on Cook Street, Glasgow. The same bridge was involved in another crash in December 2024. Again, the roof of a bus was torn off, this time after the driver reportedly took a wrong turn into the one-way street. Numerous injuries were caused and eight people went to hospital. Days later, in a separate incident, another double decker bus hit another railway bridge in Scotland, in Kilmarnock.

==In popular culture==
*In the film &quot;Summer Holiday&quot;, Cliff Richard and friends drive a double-decker bus fitted out as a caravan across Europe.
*In &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;, Rick O&#x27;Connell (Brendan Fraser), Evelyn O&#x27;Connell (Rachel Weisz), Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr), Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah) and Alex O&#x27;Connell (Freddie Boath) are chased by mummies whilst they ride on a AEC Regent III RT in London. 
*In &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, Roger Moore as James Bond, drives one being chased. The chase involving the double-decker bus was filmed with a former London bus adapted by having the top sliced off, then put back in place running on ball bearings to allow it to slide away from the undercarriage on impact with a low bridge. The stunts involving the bus were performed by Maurice Patchett, a London Transport bus driving instructor.
*A double deck bus also featured at the end of the final episode of the sitcom &quot;The Young Ones&quot;.
*The British sitcom &quot;On the Buses&quot; featured double deckers, driven by Stan Butler (portrayed by Reg Varney).
*In &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, the aforementioned Knight Bus is a triple-decker bus which can fit under bridges due to magic.
*During the 2012 Summer Olympics, Czech artist David Černý presented his moving sculpture named &quot;London Booster&quot;, a full-sized &quot;London double-decker bus&quot; (actually ex-Southern Vectis from the Isle of Wight) permanently doing push-ups with hydraulic-powered human-like arms. This was an accompanying installation outside temporarily Czech Olympic House in London borough of Islington.
*The double decker bus was also a star in a Saturday morning TV series titled &quot;Here Come the Double Deckers&quot; in the 1970s.
*A double decker bus was featured on the 2009 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode ‘Planet of the Dead’, where it transported its passengers through a wormhole to the alien planet of San Helios.
*The British television series &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; features an anthropomorphic AEC Bridgemaster named Bulgy, a character infamous for his dislike for railways. He deems roads superior to rail traffic, and often tells lies or sabotages the railways to make the roads flourish. He always gets his comeuppance in the end, though he refuses to give up his beliefs.

<text>Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat (; 5 September 1788 – 2 June 1832) was a French sinologist best known as the first Chair of Sinology at the Collège de France. Rémusat studied medicine as a young man, but his discovery of a Chinese herbal treatise enamored him with the Chinese language, and he spent five years teaching himself to read it. After publishing several well-received articles on Chinese topics, a chair in Chinese was created at the Collège de France in 1814 and Rémusat was placed in it.

==Life==
Rémusat was born in Paris on 5 September 1788 and was educated for the medical profession, earning a doctorate in medicine in 1813. While studying medicine, Rémusat discovered a Chinese herbal treatise in the collection of the Abbé Tersan and was immediately fascinated by it. He taught himself to read it by tirelessly studying the traditional Chinese dictionary &quot;Zhengzitong&quot;. In 1811, at the end of five years of study, he produced the work &quot;Essai sur la langue et la littérature chinoises (Essay on Chinese language and literature)&quot;, and a paper on foreign languages among the Chinese, which procured him the patronage of Silvestre de Sacy. In 1813, Rémusat published an essay in Latin on the nature of Chinese characters and Classical Chinese entitled &quot;Utrum Lingua Sinica sit vere monosyllabica? Disputatio philologica, in qua de Grammatica Sinica obiter agiture; autore Abelo de Remusat&quot;.

Rémusat&#x27;s early publications established his reputation in the academic community, and on November 29, 1814, a chair in Chinese was created for him at the Collège de France. This date, or, alternatively, the date of his inaugural lecture (January 16, 1815), has been termed &quot;the birth-year of [academic] sinology.&quot; Rémusat&#x27;s course in Chinese at the Collège de France focused on lectures on grammar and the study of classical texts such as the &quot;Hallowed Documents (Shàngshū)&quot;, the &quot;Laozi (Dao De Jing)&quot;, the Nestorian Stele, and both Chinese and Manchu editions of the accounts of the life of Confucius. His lecture notes were eventually edited into book form, modeled on Joseph de Prémare&#x27;s earlier grammar, and published in 1822 as &quot;Élémens de la grammaire chinoise, ou Principes généraux du Kou-wen ou style antique, et du Kouan-hou, c&#x27;est-à-dire, de la language commune généralement usitée dans l&#x27;empire chinois (Elements of Chinese Grammar, or General Principles of Gǔwén or Ancient Style, and of Guānhuà, that is to say, the Common Language Generally Used in the Chinese Empire)&quot;. This work was the first scientific exposition of the Chinese language in Europe, and was later praised by Henri Maspero as &quot;the first [work] in which the grammar was isolated to take account of the proper spirit of the Chinese language, and not just as a translation exercise where all the grammatical forms of the European languages [...] imposed their individual patterns.&quot;

Rémusat became an editor of the &quot;Journal des savants&quot; in 1818. Amid other misunderstanding of his sources, his self-assured misreading of the Japanese &quot;mujintō&quot; (, &quot;desert island[s]&quot;) in an 1817 article for the journal was responsible for the name of the Bonin Islands. He was the founder and first secretary of the Société asiatique at Paris in 1822; he also held various Government appointments.

In 1826, Rémusat published &quot;Iu-kiao-li, ou les deux cousines, roman chinois&quot; (&quot;Yu Jiao Li&quot;, titled in English as &quot;Iu-kiao-li: or, the Two Fair Cousins&quot;), one of the first Chinese novels known in Europe (the Chinese original is a minor work, though). It was read by Thomas Carlyle, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Goethe and Stendhal. A list of his works is given in Quérard&#x27;s &quot;France littéraire&quot; s.v. Rémusat. His letters to Wilhelm von Humboldt are also of interest. In 1829, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

Around 1830 Rémusat was commissioned to inventory the Chinese items held in the French Royal Library, which inspired him to begin a translation of the bibliographical sections of the &quot;Wenxian tongkao&quot; to assist European scholars in studying Chinese scholarship. He completed the first volume, &quot;Classics&quot;, in 1832, but contracted cholera and died before it was printed. Rémusat is buried along with his wife Jenny Lecamus – the daughter of Jean Lecamus, a former mayor of Paris – near the church of St. Fargeau in Saint-Fargeau-Ponthierry, Seine-et-Marne.

Rémusat was notably a lifelong &quot;armchair Sinologist&quot; who never actually set foot in China. This can in part be explained by him living during the time of China&#x27;s isolationist Canton System (1757-1842), when Western traders were permitted only the barest minimum of contact with Chinese persons. A symbolic visit to Guangzhou might therefore have been less helpful for language and culture acquisition than it might initially appear.

<text>Josef Schneider Sr. (29 May 1840 – 14 March 1927) was the first producer of electricity in Germany and founded the Elektrizitätswerk Horb. He was born in Bühlertann and died at the age of 87 in his hometown Horb am Neckar, Baden-Württemberg.

In 1890 Josef Schneider was granted a patent by royal warrant from the King of Württemberg to become the first German electricity producer. The next year, together with Ernst Werner von Siemens, he made significant improvements to the dynamo. In 1892 Germany saw its first electric light with the help of a steam turbine developed by Josef Schneider Sr. The first electricity was sold to the Hohenzollern royal family. Two years later (1894), a fire destroyed the original generating plant, motivating construction of the first private hydro-electric power plant in Horb am Neckar (Black Forest). By 1912, he and Oskar von Miller were the first to connect eleven cities in the Stuttgart-Munich region to an electric grid using high-voltage lines. In 1922, he assisted in the development of the Voith-Francis Turbine.

==1970s==
In 1975, the family firm, Elektrizitätswerk Horb KG, was incorporated and granted an electricity monopoly for generation, transmission, and sale of electricity to southwestern Baden-Württemberg. It continued to be owned by the Schneider family. In 1980 Josef Schneider Jr. helped to develop the Ossberg-Streamturbine.

==Schneider Power==

The Elektrizitätswerk Horb am Neckar KG was sold to EnBW (formerly, Energie Versorgung Schwaben) in 1985. 
In 2004 Thomas Schneider, the great great grandson of Josef Schneider, founded Schneider Power Inc. (TSXV:SNE), a publicly listed Company on the TSX Venture Exchange and one of Canada&#x27;s largest wind power producers, with wind turbines operating in Germany, the United States, and Canada.

In 2009 Schneider Power was acquired by Irvine California-based, Quantum Fuel Systems Technologies Worldwide Inc. (NASDAQ:QTWW). As of 2016 Quantum Fuel Systems LLC is wholly owned by K&amp;M Douglas Trust, a family-owned $1 billion private equity firm run by Kevin Douglas.

<doc id="902194" wikidata="Q1779484" url="?curid=902194" title="Coluthus">
<text>Coluthus or Colluthus of [[Lycopolis]] (; ) was a Greek epic poet of the late Roman Empire who flourished during the reign of Anastasius I in the Thebaid.

==&quot;Calydoniaca&quot; and &quot;The Abduction of Helen&quot;==
According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, Colothus was the author of a &quot;Calydoniaca&quot; in six books, doubtless an account of the Calydonian boar hunt, &quot;Persica&quot;, probably an encomium on emperor Anastasius composed at the end of the Persian wars, and &quot;Encomia&quot;, or laudatory poems. The Suda does not mention &quot;The Abduction of Helen&quot;.

All works mentioned in the &quot;Suda&quot; are lost, but his poem in 392 hexameters on &quot;The Abduction of Helen&quot; (Ἁρπαγὴ Ἑλένης) is still extant, having been discovered by Cardinal Bessarion in Calabria. The Abduction opens with an invocation to the nymphs of the Troad whom the poet asks for information about Paris as the originator of the Trojan conflict (1–16), followed by the account of how the gods attended the wedding of Thetis and Peleus, how they forgot to invite Eris, who searched for retaliation throwing a golden apple amongst the gods (17–63); Hera, Athena and Aphrodite all want to have it and Zeus orders Hermes to take the three goddesses to visit the handsome shepherd Paris, who should award the apple to one of them (64–79); the goddesses enhance their appearances before meeting up the shepherd, with Aphrodite launching a speech on her court of Erotes (80–100). Paris, more interested in playing the pipes than in taking care of his sheep, receives from Hermes the assignment to award the apple to the most beautiful goddess (101–30); submitting to his eyes, Athena offers him courage and victory in war, Hera to make him lord of all Asia, and Aphrodite, baring her breasts, the hand of Helen (131–65); Paris awards the apple to Aphrodite, who scorns Hera and Athena, and prepares his trip to Sparta to seduce Helen (166–200). The trip to Sparta begins with bad presages, but his fleet reaches Sparta without hazards and he sets towards the town on foot (201–46). Helen opens the door to him and, instantly attracted towards him, initiates a dialogue with him: Paris tells her that he is the son of Priam, king of Troy, and that Aphrodite promised him to make him Helen’s spouse (247–302). Helen agrees to elope with Paris and they do so during the night (303–25). Hermione wakes up the following morning and searches for her mother, considering the possibilities that she got lost in the mountains or was drowned in the river (326–62). She falls asleep exhausted and sees her mother in her dreams telling her that she was abducted by the foreigner who visited them the previous day (363–79). Hermione calls her father to return, while on seeing the arrival of the couple from the walls of Troy, Cassandra sheds her veil and tears her hair (380–92).

The anonymous writer in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition described the poem as &quot;dull and tasteless, devoid of imagination, a poor imitation of Homer, and [having] little to recommend it except its harmonious versification, based upon the technical rules of Nonnus&quot;, It has been more recently evaluated as a &quot;short and charming miniature epic&quot;.

==Printed editions==
The first printed edition was by Aldus Manutius, Venice, possibly in 1505.

Early editions by John Daniel van Lennep (1747, the first critical edition, collating six mss.), G.F. Schafer (1825), E. Abel (1880) and W. Weinberger (Teubner, 1896), have been superseded by that of Enrico Livrea (1968).

The best manuscript of this difficult and corrupt text is the so-called &quot;Codex Mutinensis&quot; (Bibliothèque nationale suppl. graec. 388) which Hall, &quot;Companion to Classical Texts&quot;, p. 278, says &quot;was never at Modena but was brought by the French in the Napoleonic wars at the beginning of the 19th century from somewhere in North Italy&quot;.

He attended Joseph Wheeler High School, located in Marietta, Georgia. He graduated as a member of the class of 2001.

==Career==
===2005===
Ginepri was the first player to be beaten by Novak Djokovic in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, at the 2005 French Open.

In August, he reached the semifinals of an ATP Masters Series tournament for the first time in his career, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He beat 2005 French Open runner-up Mariano Puerta in the first round, David Ferrer in the second round, 1998 French Open champion Carlos Moyá in the third round, and two-time Grand Slam singles titlist Marat Safin in the quarterfinals. He then lost to world no. 1 Roger Federer in the semifinals.

His summer hardcourt record was 14–3 when he arrived two weeks later at the US Open as an unseeded player. After defeating Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in the first round, and Andy Roddick&#x27;s conqueror, Gilles Müller, in the second round, both in straight sets, Ginepri then put together three consecutive five-set wins, defeating Tommy Haas in the third round, Richard Gasquet in the fourth round, and Guillermo Coria in the quarterfinals. He then lost to Andre Agassi in the semifinals in five sets. Ginepri thus became the first player in the open era to play four consecutive five-set matches at the US Open.

In November at the Madrid Masters, Ginepri made it to another ATP Masters Series semifinal, before losing to eventual champion Rafael Nadal. He also won the inaugural Superset Tennis tournament, a groundbreaking one-set, one-day tournament, earning him prize money of $250,000. He finished 2005 at world no. 15 in the ATP rankings, the highest ranking of his career.

===2006–2007===
Ginepri&#x27;s results in 2006 did not match his successes in 2005. He lost in the second round of the Australian Open and the first round of both the French Open and Wimbledon. At the US Open, he lost in the third round to German Tommy Haas in a fifth-set tiebreaker. He finished the year ranked world no. 51 with a 24–26 record. Ginepri lost in the third round of both the Australian Open and the US Open and the first round of both the French Open and Wimbledon. He finished the year ranked world no. 134.

===2008===
At the tournament in Delray Beach, Florida, Ginepri lost in the semifinals to James Blake. In his next tournament, the SAP Open in San Jose, California, Ginepri was able to defeat Blake in the quarterfinals, but lost in the semifinals to Radek Štěpánek.

At the Tennis Channel Open in Las Vegas, Nevada, Ginepri reached the semifinals for his third consecutive tournament. Ginepri defeated Xavier Malisse in the first round, world no. 17 Marcos Baghdatis in the second round, and Ernests Gulbis in the quarterfinals, before falling to Kevin Anderson. Ginepri then played the Tennis Masters Series Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, California, losing in the second round to Carlos Moyá.

At the Hypo Group Tennis International in Pörtschach, Austria, Ginepri lost in the quarterfinals to Juan Mónaco. He then made it to the fourth round of the French Open, before losing to 24th-seeded Fernando González. On grass, Ginepri lost in the second round of The Artois Championships in London to Andy Roddick and the first round of Wimbledon to Gonzalez.

On June 23, 2008, Ginepri&#x27;s ranking was world no. 59, a rise of 112 places since January 28, 2008. Ginepri then made his Olympic debut tennis at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, losing in the first round. In July, Ginepri made his debut in the World Team Tennis league, playing for the new Washington Kastles team.

At the 2009 US Open, Ginepri advanced to the second round, before losing to Nicolás Almagro in five sets.

===2010===
Ginepri lost in the first round of the Australian Open. He beat Sam Querrey in four sets in the first round of the French Open and Potito Starace in the second round. He beat no. 16 Juan Carlos Ferrero in five sets, advancing to play in the fourth round, where he lost against Novak Djokovic in four sets. He was the only unseeded player left in the competition, along with qualifier Gabashvili, and the last American in the men&#x27;s field.

He lost to Robin Söderling in straight sets in the first round of Wimbledon.

In October, Ginepri was involved in a biking accident causing him to have surgery on his arm. He didn&#x27;t return to the pro tour until July 2011.

===2011–2014===
Ginepri participated in the Atlanta Tennis Championships as a wildcard. His first match was against fellow wildcard Tommy Haas. He received a wildcard to the US Open, where he defeated Brazilian João Souza in the first round in a four-set match. He then lost to John Isner in the second round.

In the early part of 2013, Ginepri won a Futures event and made the final of a Challenger tournament. Ginepri made it to the quarterfinals of the US Clay Court Championship in Houston before losing to Juan Mónaco. He failed to qualify for the French Open and did not participate in Wimbledon. In 2014, having competed in futures tournaments throughout the start of the season, Ginepri participated in his first Challenger at the 2014 Sarasota Open, retiring after one match in the first round of qualifying. After winning the USTA wildcard position for the 2014 French Open, he lost to Rafael Nadal in the first round, 6–0, 6–3, 6–0.

<doc id="902209" wikidata="Q3476332" url="?curid=902209" title="Horror of Fang Rock">
<text>Horror of Fang Rock is the first serial of the 15th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 3 to 24 September 1977.

The serial is set on the fictional English island of Fang Rock in the early 20th century, where a shapeshifting alien scout called a Rutan arrives on Earth intending to use the planet as a strategic base in the Rutans&#x27; war against the Sontarans.

==Plot==

The TARDIS lands on the island of Fang Rock, off the south coast of England in the early 20th century. Noticing that the lighthouse isn&#x27;t functioning properly, the Doctor decides to investigate, and to ask for directions, as the TARDIS seems to have gotten &#x27;lost in the fog&#x27;. Arriving at the lighthouse, and after introducing themselves, the Doctor and Leela discover the dead body of one of the keepers, Ben. The other two keepers, Reuben and Vince Hawkins, report that a light fell from the sky near the island. They also explain the electricity flow to the lamp on the lighthouse has become erratic and the Doctor deduces something is feeding on the flow. As the Doctor and Leela explore, something moves Ben&#x27;s body onto the island, and they witness an electric crackling nearby.

The lack of light causes a luxury yacht to crash onto Fang Rock. The four survivors are brought to the lighthouse: the bosun Harker; Colonel James Skinsale MP; the owner, Lord Palmerdale; and his secretary Adelaide Lessage. Sometime later, Harker and the Doctor retrieve Ben&#x27;s body, and the Doctor deduces it has been used as an anatomy lesson by an alien life form, determining they should therefore secure the lighthouse. Reuben disappears for a time, reappearing a changed man, apparently due to shock. Palmerdale and Harker are killed; and an alien light emanates from Reuben. The Doctor finds Harker&#x27;s body and then Reuben&#x27;s – the latter cold.

The creature attempts to kills the others in the lighthouse, and with its presence now revealed, sheds its disguise, revealing it to be a Rutan, whose ship crash-landed in the sea and who is trying to summon its mother ship. The Rutans, losing a long war against their hereditary enemies, the Sontarans, plan to turn the strategically-located Earth into a base; however this will certainly make the Sontarans bombard the Earth with photonic missiles, taking countless human lives in the process. The Doctor uses a flashbomb to disorient the Rutan, forcing it to retreat. The Doctor and Skinsale retrieve diamonds from Palmerdale&#x27;s body belt, but Skinsale is killed by the Rutan in the process. The Doctor then modifies a flare mortar to destroy the alien, and uses the diamonds to focus the lighthouse beam, converting it into a high-energy laser, and destroying the Rutan mothership. The Doctor quotes Wilfrid Wilson Gibson&#x27;s poem &quot;Flannan Isle&quot; as they leave.

==Production==
The serial was the first to be broadcast under new producer Graham Williams, who succeeded Philip Hinchcliffe.

Working titles for this story included &quot;The Monster of Fang Rock&quot; and &quot;The Beast of Fang Rock&quot;. &quot;Horror of Fang Rock&quot; was a late replacement for the scripts Terrance Dicks had originally submitted, a vampire-based tale entitled &quot;The Vampire Mutations&quot;, which was cancelled close to production as it was feared it could detract from the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Count Dracula&quot;, a high-profile adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s classic novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, which was due for transmission close to when the serial would have aired. A re-written version did, however, eventually see production in 1980 as &quot;State of Decay&quot;, part of the eighteenth season of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

The serial is the only one of the original series to have been produced at BBC studios outside London. Engineering work at those studios meant that it was made at the Pebble Mill Studios of BBC Birmingham instead. According to the DVD commentary supplied by Louise Jameson, John Abbott and Terrance Dicks, a scene in part three was crucial to the behind-the-scenes relationship between Jameson and co-star Tom Baker. In one scene, he consistently came in ahead of his cue, thereby upstaging her. On the grounds that this move was &quot;not what they had rehearsed&quot; she insisted on three successive retakes until he came in at the rehearsed time. This eventually won his respect. From that point forward, she claims their working relationship was much smoother.

Louise Jameson stops wearing her brown contact lenses at the end of this serial, with the sudden change in colour being explained as a pigment dispersal caused by looking directly into a bright explosion. As mentioned in more than one DVD commentary Jameson had found the lenses painful to wear, and made their removal a condition for her agreeing to play Leela for another season.

===&quot;The Ballad of Flannan Isle&quot;===
Many elements of the episode were based on a poem, &quot;Flannan Isle&quot; by Wilfrid Wilson Gibson, which the Doctor quotes from at the end of the story; the poem itself was inspired by the mysterious disappearance of three lighthouse keepers from the Flannan Isles in 1900.

===Cast notes===
Alan Rowe had previously played Dr. Evans and provided the voice from Space Control in &quot;The Moonbase&quot; (1967) as well as Edward of Wessex in &quot;The Time Warrior&quot; (1973–74) and later appeared as Garif in the serial &quot;Full Circle&quot; (1980). Ralph Watson had previously played Captain Knight in &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; (1968) as well as Ettis in &quot;The Monster of Peladon&quot; (1974). Colin Douglas had previously played Donald Bruce in &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot; (1967–68).

==Broadcast and reception==

Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), &quot;A masterpiece, designed to do nothing more than scare kids, which it does very efficiently. It&#x27;s a very good Leela story, too.&quot; In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker were also positive, describing it as &quot;a tightly constructed drama that succeeds because of, rather than in spite of, its confined setting and limited cast&quot;. They praised the sets, atmosphere, and most of the acting. In &quot;Doctor Who: The Complete Guide&quot;, Mark Campbell awarded it ten out of ten, considering it &quot;strong on atmosphere&quot; and &quot;a tense, scary tale that makes a virtue of its small cast and claustrophobic locale.&quot; He concluded that it was &quot;superlative in every way&quot;.

In 2010, Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded it four stars out of five, calling the serial &quot;classy, cosy, autumnal &quot;Who&quot;&quot;, with many positives, including the good characterisation of Leela, the shock of the Doctor admitting he had done something wrong, and the characterisation of the lighthouse crew. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;&#x27;s Christopher Bahn was critical of the pacing of the end of the story and the &quot;often unconvincing&quot; special effects, but considered the serial to be, despite some flaws, &quot;a classic base-under-siege chiller&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2019, Toby Hadoke described it as &quot;a claustrophobic masterpiece dripping with mordant humour and suspense&quot;. For Den of Geek, Andrew Blair wrote that Leela&#x27;s line &quot;you will do as the Doctor says or I will cut out your heart&quot; was his favourite Leela moment, adding that &quot;what makes this scene even funnier is that the camera immediately cuts to the Doctor, who bursts into a massive grin.&quot; 

===Max Headroom intrusion===

On the night of 22 November 1987, a broadcast of the first part of &quot;Horror of Fang Rock&quot; by Chicago television station WTTW was interrupted for around 90 seconds by a pirate broadcast featuring an unknown individual, who was disguised as the television character Max Headroom. The incident made national headlines, however the people responsible were never identified.

<text>Alexander Ivanovich Marinesko (, , ; – 25 November 1963) was a Soviet career naval officer. During the last year of World War II, he became known as the captain of the submarine &quot;S-13&quot;, which sank the German military transport ship &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; in the Baltic Sea in January 1945. Passengers included civilians and women and children being evacuated from East Prussia, in addition to military and related personnel. More than 9,300 of the more than 10,000 passengers and crew died. 

Marinesko was the most successful Soviet submarine commander in terms of gross register tonnage (GRT) sunk, with 42,000 GRT to his name, but at the time the government considered him personally unsuitable for the highest award. In 1990 he was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union by President Mikhail Gorbachev.

==Early life==
Born in Odessa, Marinesko was the son of Ion Marinescu, a Romanian sailor, and Tatiana Mihailovna Koval, a Ukrainian from Kherson Governorate. His father had fled to the Russian Empire after beating an officer, and he settled in Odessa. There he modified his name according to Russian/Ukrainian language conventions, adopting Ivan as his first name and changing the last letter &quot;u&quot; of his surname to &quot;o&quot;.

As a young man, Marinesko trained in the Soviet Merchant Navy and the Soviet Navy&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet. Later he was assigned to a command position in the Baltic Fleet. He was promoted to lieutenant (ensign) in March 1936 and advanced to senior lieutenant (sub-lieutenant) in November 1938. In the summer of 1939 he was appointed commander of the new submarine M-96. When it entered service in mid-1940, it was declared to be the best submarine of the Baltic Fleet. Marinesko was awarded a golden watch and in 1940 promoted to captain-lieutenant (капитан-лейтенант, equivalent to Lieutenant Commander (LCDR/O-4) in the United States Navy).

== World War II ==
Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, in June 1941. The Soviet high command of the Baltic Fleet decided that the M-96 should be sent to the Caspian Sea to serve as a training boat. But this could not be realized because of the German blockade of Leningrad. On 12 February 1942, a German artillery shell hit M-96, causing considerable damage.

In the beginning of 1943, Marinesko was appointed commander of the modernized submarine S-13. Of the 13 units of the Type S (Stalinets), Series IX and IXbis, only this boat survived the war.

=== &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; and &quot;Steuben&quot; ===
Marinesko left the Soviet Porkkala Naval Base in Finland on 11 January 1945 and took position near Kolberg on January 13. During the next few days his submarine was attacked several times by German torpedo boats. On 30 January 1945, S-13 attacked and sank the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;, which was evacuating civilians, mostly families with children, and military personnel from East Prussia. There were an estimated 9,400 casualties.

Days later, on 10 February, Marinesko sank a second German ship with two torpedoes, the &quot;Steuben&quot;, carrying mostly wounded military personnel, and more than 800 civilians, who were evacuating East Prussia and Memel (now Klaipėda). The total number of casualties is estimated at 4,267. Marinesko was ranked as the most successful Soviet submarine commander in terms of gross register tonnage (GRT) sunk, with 42,000 GRT to his name.

Before sinking the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;, Alexander Marinesko had been facing a court martial due to his problems with alcohol. Despite his success with the sinkings, he was deemed &quot;not suitable to be a hero&quot;. He was instead awarded the Order of the Red Banner. He was downgraded in rank to lieutenant and dishonorably discharged from the navy in October 1945, following war&#x27;s end. 

In 1960 Marinesko was reinstated as captain third class and granted a full pension. In 1963 he was given the traditional ceremony due a captain upon his successful return from a mission, which he had not received in 1945. He died from cancer three weeks later on 25 November 1963 he was buried at the Bogoslovskoe Cemetery in St. Petersburg. In 1990 Marinesko was posthumously awarded Hero of the Soviet Union by President Mikhail Gorbachev, after rehabilitation of the late submarine commander by the newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot;.

==Legacy==
*In 1990, the year of the posthumous award, Ulitsa Stroitelei (Builders&#x27; Street) in St. Petersburg was renamed in his honor to Ulitsa Marinesko. It is that portion located in Kirovskiy District, connecting Avtovskaya and Zaitseva streets. 
*The Museum of Russian Submarine Forces in St. Petersburg was named after him, 
*Monuments dedicated to him were erected in Kaliningrad, Kronstadt, Moldova, and Odessa.
*Marinesko is an historic figure and prominent character in Günter Grass&#x27;s novel &quot;Crabwalk&quot; (2002), which describes in detail the sinking of the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;.

== Honours and awards ==

*Hero of the Soviet Union, 1990
*Two Orders of Lenin
*Two Orders of the Red Banner
*Medal &quot;For Military Merit&quot;
*Medal &quot;For the Defence of Leningrad&quot;
*Medal &quot;For the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945&quot;

<text>Foots Cray is an area of South East London, England, within the London Borough of Bexley. Prior to 1965 it was in the historic county of Kent. It is located south-east of Sidcup, north of Orpington and north west of Swanley.

==History==
It took its name from Godwin Fot, a local Saxon landowner recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, and from the River Cray that passes through the village. It lay on the old Maidstone Road (now bypassed by the A20 road) leading from London to north Kent. Until the 20th century, Foots Cray dominated the nearby, less ancient hill-top hamlet of Sidcup. The combined area was designated as the Urban District of Foots Cray in 1902. Soon, however, the two settlements&#x27; fortunes were reversed, as Foots Cray&#x27;s traditional industries declined after the First World War, and Sidcup grew rapidly as a commuter town after a railway was built linking it to central London. In 1921 this change was reflected in the renaming of Foots Cray Urban District to Sidcup Urban District. In 1965 both areas became part of the London Borough of Bexley.

William Walsingham (died 1534), of Foots Cray, second son of James Walsingham, lord of the Manor of Scadbury in Chislehurst, Kent, was the father of Sir Francis Walsingham (c.1532-1590), Principal Secretary to Queen Elizabeth I, popularly remembered as her &quot;spymaster&quot;.

The estate of Foots Cray Place was rebuilt about 1754 for Bourchier Cleeve, on the site of the manor, as a Palladian mansion that was attributed to Isaac Ware; it was illustrated in this form in &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot; iv (1777, pls. 8-10). Foots Cray Place was remodelled for Benjamin Harenc (1792) by the minor London architect Henry Hakewill, who further remodelled it in 1823 for Nicholas Vansittart, 1st Baron Bexley, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Further works were carried out for Lord Bexley by another London architect of equally modest reputation, John William Hiort, who also built Bexley&#x27;s London house in Great George Street, Westminster. After a fire in 1949, it was demolished in 1950. Now only the stable block remains, but the grounds, known as Foots Cray Meadows, provide a valuable public green space in this south-eastern suburb of London. This 89-hectare park was formed in the early 19th century from two mid-18th-century landscaped parks. It is listed by English Heritage as a Grade II historic park and is a Local Nature Reserve. The &quot;London LOOP&quot; walk passes through Foots Cray Meadows on its way from Old Bexley to Sidcup Place and Petts Wood. There is some industry in an area next to the meadows and bordering the river.

The naval wireless engineer and short-story writer F. G. Loring died at the Old House, Foot&#x27;s Cray on 7 September 1951, aged eighty-two.

Foots Cray stable block and adjacent walled garden were placed on the English Heritage &#x27;at risk&#x27; register but have now been rescued following redevelopment to form a luxury home that was for sale in 2008 at £3.5 million.

The town gave its name to Footscray, a major suburb in the inner west of the metropolitan area of Melbourne, Australia.

==Geography==

Foots Cray borders North Cray to the north and north east, Ruxley to the east and south east, St Paul&#x27;s Cray to the south and south west and Sidcup to the west and north west.

==Church==
Just to the north of the main crossroads, All Saints Church, Foots Cray, is situated in Rectory Lane on the edge of Foots Cray Meadows near the River Cray. The church was built in the 1330s but is believed to stand on the site of an earlier (possibly Saxon) church evidenced by the late 12th century Norman font. The church includes a mid 14th century effigy, two 14th century windows on the south side of the nave and in the chapel, and a brass plate recording the death of Thomas Myton, Rector of Foots Cray, in 1489. The west door-case and porch date from about 1500. In 1638 the church owned eight acres of land which included an orchard, garden and cowyard, a dwelling house, hovel, barn and stable.

In 1863 extensive alterations took place, including the removal of the old box pews, with the church being substantially rebuilt. The nave was extended westwards with the bell tower at the west end of the church left standing on four oak posts so that the bells are now rung from the centre of the aisle. During the enlargement and remodelling of the chancel, the remains of twenty burials were found, as was a brass plate engraved with the date 1440 which still had a bunch of lavender placed underneath it. The stained glass windows date from the second half of the 19th century as do the three bells, although the bells were recast in 1987. In 1995-97 major roof repairs took place to the nave, chancel, chapel and vestry at a cost of nearly £70,000.

The original parish registers dating back to 1559 were stolen in 1948 when vandals broke into the church and threw the church records into the River Cray, but copies of the register from 1559 to 1832 had been made.

The original churchyard was extended in 1876 courtesy of a donation of one acre of land by Robert Arnold Vansittart, and again in 1885. The churchyard includes an unusual iron stone grave slab which marked the burial of Martin Manning &#x27;Yeoman&#x27; in 1656 (although the inscription is no longer legible). The granite Sir John Pender monument was blown over in the hurricane of October 1987 despite its great weight and later re-erected by the Pender family and Sir John&#x27;s old company Cable &amp; Wireless plc.

In 1996 when contractors were cleaning out the void just above the walls around the nave, they found a Daily Express newspaper dated 29 October 1957 in an envelope signed by the seven workmen who had been installing a gas-fired boiler.

==Industry and commerce==

The Coca-Cola Company has a large manufacturing and bottling plant in Foots Cray which opened in 1961 and employs 361 people. This plant was where Dasani water was produced.

Kolster-Brandes was a manufacturer of radio and television sets that moved to Foots Cray in 1928. The company was later acquired by ITT. The Kolster-Brandes company rugby team, which was formed in 1967, is now called Foots Cray RUFC and competes to this day. The team&#x27;s badge incorporates the STC letters which represent Standard Telephones and Cables, the company which took over the Kolster Brands business.

Fujitsu had a call centre and software development offices on the site of the former Kolster-Brandes factory which closed in 2009.

Richard Klinger Group, an Austrian company which made engine gaskets, hydraulic pipelines and water level gauges and valves, had a factory built in 1937 fronting Edgington Way in a Modernist architectural style. This Klinger factory, later bought by French company Trouvey Cauvin, closed in the 1990s and was severely damaged by fire in 2013. The main and flank facades were retained when the building was converted for self-storage use during 2018/19 when the exterior clock was restored.

The Robert Greig foodstore near the village centre was modified as a Lidl supermarket in the early 1990s and traded until 16th January 2022, when it was superseded by a purpose-built supermarket on Sevenoaks Way, in St. Mary Cray to the south.

==Sport==
A small short lived greyhound racing track was opened during the mid-1930s in the area. The exact location is unknown but according to the 1934 Kelly&#x27;s Directory was located on the Sidcup Hill side of Foots Cray. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body, the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks.

In 1977, Foots Cray Lions football club was established, with one team entering the local league. The club&#x27;s matches are played at Baugh Road in Foots Cray. The club has male and female adult and junior teams. In 2016 Foots Cray Lions were voted Charter Standard Development Club of the Year by the Football Association.

<doc id="902218" wikidata="Q1624064" url="?curid=902218" title="Detection Club">
<text>The Detection Club was formed in 1930 by a group of British mystery writers, including Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ronald Knox, Freeman Wills Crofts, Arthur Morrison, Hugh Walpole, John Rhode, Jessie Louisa Rickard, Baroness Orczy, R. Austin Freeman, G. D. H. Cole, Margaret Cole, E. C. Bentley, Henry Wade, Constance Lindsay Taylor and H. C. Bailey. Anthony Berkeley Cox was instrumental in setting up the club, and the first president was G. K. Chesterton. There is a fanciful initiation ritual with an oath written by Sayers, and the club holds regular dinner meetings in London.

==Guidelines==
In addition to meeting for dinners and helping each other with technical aspects in their individual writings, the members of the club agreed to adhere to Knox&#x27;s Commandments in their writing to give the reader a fair chance at guessing the guilty party. These fair-play &quot;rules&quot; were summarised by one of the members, Ronald Knox, in an introduction to an anthology of detective stories. They were never intended as more than guidelines, and not all the members took them seriously. The first American member (though then living in the UK) was John Dickson Carr, elected in 1936.

The club continues to exist, although the fair-play rules have been considerably relaxed.

A number of works were published under the club&#x27;s sponsorship; most of these were written by multiple members of the club, each contributing one or more chapters in turn. In the case of &quot;The Floating Admiral&quot;, each author also provided a sealed &quot;solution&quot; to the mystery as he or she had written it, including the previous chapters. This was done to prevent a writer from adding impossible complications with no reasonable solution in mind. The various partial solutions were published as part of the final book.

==Initial membership==
The founding members of the club in 1930 were H. C. Bailey, E. C. Bentley, Anthony Berkeley, G. K. Chesterton, Agatha Christie, G. D. H. Cole, Margaret Cole, J.J. Connington Freeman Wills Crofts, Clemence Dane, Robert Eustace, R. Austin Freeman, Lord Gorell, Edgar Jepson, Ianthe Jerrold, Milward Kennedy, Ronald Knox, A. E. W. Mason, A. A. Milne, Arthur Morrison, Baroness Orczy, John Rhode, Jessie Rickard, Dorothy L. Sayers, Helen Simpson, Constance Lindsay Taylor, Henry Wade, Victor Whitechurch and Hugh Walpole.

Over the following two decades further members were elected to the club: Anthony Gilbert (1933), E. R. Punshon (1933), Gladys Mitchell (1933), Margery Allingham (1934), Norman Kendal (1935), R.C. Woodthorpe (1935), John Dickson Carr (1936), Cecil Day-Lewis (1937), Muna Lee (1937), Maurice Guinness (1937), E.C.R. Lorac (1937), Christopher Bush (1937), Cyril Hare (1946), Christianna Brand (1946), Richard Hull (1946), Alice Campbell (1946), Val Gielgud (1947), Edmund Crispin (1947), Dorothy Bowers (1948), Douglas G. Browne (1949), Michael Innes (1949), Michael Gilbert (1949) and Mary Fitt (1950).

Membership was initially limited to those considered to be writing pure detective novels, rather than mystery thrillers. This began to change when Eric Ambler, known for his thrillers and spy novels, was elected in 1952. Several notable detective writers including Philip MacDonald and Josephine Tey were never invited to join the club, while Georgette Heyer who wrote detective stories alongside her better-known regency novels turned down an invitation. &quot;Daily Express&quot; columnist Nancy Spain was considered for membership but was rejected. Future president Julian Symons was initially rejected before eventually being admitted in 1951. Ngaio Marsh, a major figure in detective writing, only joined later in life.

Subsequent members of the Club included Andrew Garve, H. R. F. Keating and John Bingham. Martin Edwards charted the early history of the Club in his 2015 book &quot;The Golden Age of Murder&quot;.

== The oath ==
Do you promise that your detectives shall well and truly detect the crimes presented to them using those wits which it may please you to bestow upon them and not placing reliance on nor making use of Divine Revelation, Feminine Intuition , Mumbo Jumbo, Jiggery-Pokery, Coincidence or Act of God?

== Presidents ==
*G. K. Chesterton (1930–1936)
*E. C. Bentley (1936–1949)
*Dorothy L. Sayers (1949–1957)
*Agatha Christie (1957–1976)
*Lord Gorell (1957–1963)
*Julian Symons (1976–1985)
*H. R. F. Keating (1985–2000)
*Simon Brett (2000–2015)
*Martin Edwards (2015–)

Lord Gorell shared the presidency with Agatha Christie, who only agreed to accept the role if a co-president was appointed to conduct the club&#x27;s proceedings.

<doc id="902220" wikidata="Q2804315" url="?curid=902220" title="The Littles">
<text>The Littles is a series of children&#x27;s novels by American author John Peterson, the first of which was published in 1967. Sixteen years later, Peterson&#x27;s books were adapted into &quot;The Littles&quot;, an animated series by DIC Entertainment. The television show formerly ran on ABC Saturday mornings from September 10, 1983 to November 2, 1985 for three seasons and 29 episodes. In 1985, DiC released an animated feature film spun off the series titled &quot;Here Come the Littles&quot;.

Similar to Mary Norton&#x27;s earlier novel &quot;The Borrowers&quot;, &quot;The Littles&quot; features a family of tiny, intelligent humanoid creatures with mouse-like features (the Littles) who live in a house owned by the Bigg family. The mouse-like features include a long, furry tail, long teeth and mouse-like ears (in the books the Littles have a tail but not the long teeth and mouse-like ears). Their height is .

==Characters==
===The Little Family===
The Littles are a family of tiny people living in the walls of human houses. The Little family consists of William T. Little and Wilma Little (Frank and Helen in the TV series), their children Tom and Lucy, and Uncle Pete (Grandpa Little in the TV series). In the books, Uncle Nick, Uncle Pete, Granny and Grandpa (Amos), and Baby Betsy live with the family. Relatives who don&#x27;t live with them include Cousin Dinky, his wife Della, his mother Lily the nurse, Granny&#x27;s sister Littlebit, and her cousins Tracy and Gracie.

====Tom and Lucy Little====
Tom and Lucy Little both insist on doing good deeds for big people, including a blind woman. One time they tried to find a Grandma Little for Grandpa. They can make mischief around the place.

====Dinky====
An older cousin of the other Littles, he is a pilot and serves as the mail service and occasional transport for all tiny people in the area. In the books he flies a glider (competently) and is responsible and adventurous; in the TV series he flies a propeller plane (poorly) and he is clumsy and frequently gets into trouble. Usually these troubles remit directly into Grandpa Little, who loses his temper and charges into &quot;disciplining&quot; the unfortunate Dinky. In the books he marries Della, who learns to fly. While he lives with his mother Lilly the nurse in the books, in the TV series he lives with the family.

====Ashley====
Another younger cousin of Tom and Lucy. Portrayed as a tantrum-prone and rebellious spoiled brat, he often sabotages whatever his older cousins accomplish, only to feel bad about it when Tom and Lucy are put in danger as a result. He appears only in the TV series during seasons two and three.

===Henry Bigg===
Henry Bigg is the boy who lives in a house with The Littles. He never discovers the Littles in the book series, but in the cartoon he is one of the few people who knows of the Littles&#x27; existence.

The first season of the TV series never revealed how Henry learned about the Littles, as it opened with Henry telling the audience that he has &quot;a very special secret&quot; and is the only one who knows about the Littles. During the second season, the opening says that Tom and Lucy fell inside Henry&#x27;s suitcase when he moved; he discovered them when he opened his suitcase afterward. In the final season, Henry traveled to other parts of the world with his parents, using a specially designed carrier (a hollowed-out camera case) to take the Littles with him.

The movie &quot;Here Come the Littles&quot; follows the second season opening in that Tom and Lucy get trapped in Henry&#x27;s suitcase. However, Henry doesn&#x27;t discover them until much later, first seeing Grandpa and Dinky while mowing his Uncle Augustus&#x27; yard. Augustus takes them away from Henry, believing them to be toys. To rescue Grandpa and Dinky, Tom and Lucy decide to reveal themselves to Henry, befriending him and asking him for help.

Henry takes great care to keep other people, including his own parents, from learning about the Littles. In one episode, however (&quot;Dinky&#x27;s Doomsday Pizzas&quot;), Henry betrayed the Littles when he learned that if he did, he would be on TV. The incident, and its resulting fallout, turned out to be only a dream, specifically Dinky&#x27;s dream.

===Slick===
Slick is Henry&#x27;s pet turtle who is usually seen hanging with The Littles. In emergencies when Tom and Lucy must contact Henry, they tie messages on Slick&#x27;s back and send them to him. Slick wears roller skates to move more quickly but often comically slips and slides around.

===Glory===
Glory becomes Tom&#x27;s friend in &quot;The Littles and their Amazing new Friend&quot; after she saves Tom and Uncle nick from a haystack fire.

<text>The B, formerly and commonly known as the Broad Street Line (BSL), is a rapid transit line in the SEPTA Metro network in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The line runs primarily north-south from the Fern Rock Transportation Center in North Philadelphia through Center City Philadelphia to NRG station at Pattison Avenue in South Philadelphia; the latter station provides access to the stadiums and arenas for the city&#x27;s major professional sports teams at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, about a quarter mile away. It is named for Broad Street, under which the line runs for almost its entire length.

The line, which is entirely underground except for the northern terminus at Fern Rock, has four tracks in a local/express configuration from Fern Rock to Walnut-Locust and two tracks from Lombard-South to the southern terminus at NRG station. It is one of only two rapid transit lines in the SEPTA Metro system overall alongside the Market–Frankford Line, though Center City Philadelphia is also served by four stations of the PATCO Speedline rapid transit line which runs from Center City Philadelphia through Camden, New Jersey to Lindenwold, New Jersey. With about 115,000 boardings on an average weekday in 2019, it is the second busiest route in the SEPTA system.

The line and its trains were leased to SEPTA in 1968 after it assumed operation of the city transit systems from the former Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC). Broad Street Line subway cars bear both the SEPTA logo and the seal of the City of Philadelphia to reflect the split ownership-operation arrangement.

==History==

Service on the northern half of the Broad Street Line, between City Hall and Olney Avenue, opened on September1, 1928. While the original subway tunnel had been finished to just north of the present-day Lombard-South station, service to the Walnut-Locust station did not begin until 1930, and the Lombard-South station entered service in 1932. Service from that point south to Snyder Avenue began on September18, 1938. Service to a new park-and-ride station built next to the Fern Rock shops began in 1956, and the line was extended further south to Pattison Avenue in 1973 to serve the recently completed Sports Complex.

The total cost of the original segment, &quot;Olney Avenue to South Street,&quot; was stated at $102 million.

Although the Broad Street Line was originally planned in the 1920s to be a 4-track facility for its entire length (Fern Rock portal to Snyder), the tunnel was built with provision for 4 tracks only from the portal to just north of Lombard-South. At the time of opening, the outer 2 tracks were built along this length, whereas the inner 2 express tracks were built only in two sections, from the Fern Rock portal/shops to just south of Olney, and from Girard to their terminus just north of Lombard South. To close the gaps, the two inner express tracks were laid from Erie to Girard in 1959, and again from Olney to Erie in 1991.

From Lombard-South station south to Snyder, the tunnel was constructed differently – only the eastern half of the line was built. The track currently used for southbound trains is actually the northbound express track. The extension in 1973 to Pattison station (now called NRG station) continued this arrangement. Space exists under the western half of Broad Street for the construction of the western half of the tunnel, which would include the remaining 2 tracks and additional island platforms for southbound local and express trains. The resulting infrastructure would match the configuration built in the northern half of the line.

Provisions for flying junctions exist in the tunnels at three locations: north of Olney station, north of Erie station, and between Tasker-Morris and Snyder stations. These were to connect to planned but never built extensions to the north, northeast, northwest and southwest. Tracks were laid in the upper levels of the flying junctions north of Olney and Erie; these have been used over the years to store out-of-service trains and as layover points for express and Ridge Spur trains.

The NRG Station contains a lower level platform (very narrow compared to the very wide upper level platform), built to accommodate additional trains for large crowds at sporting events. Seldom used for passenger service in recent years, these tracks are most often used to store rolling stock and work trains.

Two of the Broad Street subway system&#x27;s stations have been closed. The Spring Garden station on the Ridge Avenue spur line was closed in 1989. The Franklin Square station on the PATCO route was closed in 1953, reopened in 1976 for the US Bicentennial, then closed again in 1979. It is scheduled to reopen (after a major renovation) in 2024.

The Broad Street Line is one of only two rapid transit lines in the United States outside of New York City to use separate local and express tracks for a significant length, the other being Chicago&#x27;s North Side Main Line from Armitage north, used by Purple Line express trains.

During early 2020, the line operated &quot;Lifeline Service&quot; due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Pennsylvania. From April 2020, trains bypassed the , , , , , , , and stations. All stations were reopened by July 2020.

In September 2021, SEPTA proposed updating wayfinding across the SEPTA Rail Transit network. Part of the proposal, SEPTA proposed rebranding their rail transit service as &quot;SEPTA Metro&quot;, in order to make the system easier to navigate. Under this proposal, services along the Broad Street Line will be rebranded as the &quot;B&quot; lines with an orange color. Each service utilizing the trunk would receive a numeric suffix. Local service would be known as the B1 Broad Street Local, the express and special service as the B2 Broad Street Express and B2 Express Sport Special, and the Broad–Ridge Spur as the B3 Broad–Ridge Express.

Following public feedback, SEPTA revised the Wayfinding Master Plan. Rather than being referred to as the B Lines, the current Broad Street Line would become the B Line. Express and special services would be consolidated into the B2 Broad Street Express, with signage letting riders know whether a train terminates at Walnut–Locust or NRG station. Additionally, SEPTA stated they would pilot neighborhood maps in stations and prioritize the deployment of real-time information signage and on mobile apps.
===Proposed extensions===

====Roosevelt Boulevard====

Both the City of Philadelphia and SEPTA have studied extending the Broad Street Line along Roosevelt Boulevard, in order to serve a growing population in the northeast section of the city. The city government&#x27;s archives contain a survey report, prepared in 1948, discussing a need for an extension of the Broad Street line from Erie Avenue to the vicinity of Pennypack Circle (see Roosevelt Boulevard). Subway car destination signage even included station and terminus names for major streets along Roosevelt Boulevard such as Rhawn Street, in the newer &quot;South Broad&quot; cars. An expansion into another part of the City could better use the capacity of the four-track trunk line.

In 1964, the city proposed a , $94million extension of the Broad Street line along Roosevelt Blvd. in conjunction with a new Northeast Expressway to be built by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Development was limited to the building of one subway station by Sears, Roebuck and Company in 1967, at its complex on Roosevelt Boulevard at Adams Avenue, at the cost of $1million, in anticipation of future service. This station was destroyed when the facility was demolished in October 1994. Ultimately the Northeast Expressway was never built, due to lack of funds, and the subway extension remained a paper concept.

On September10, 1999, SEPTA filed a Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Northeast Extension with the EPA. In December 2001, the Philadelphia City Planning Commission supported extending the Broad Street Line along Roosevelt Blvd. to Bustleton Avenue, where it would be joined by the Market–Frankford Line, extended from its Frankford terminal (now the rebuilt Frankford Transportation Center). The estimated cost had ballooned to $3.4billion.

====Philadelphia Naval Yard====
Currently, the Broad Street Line terminates southbound at NRG station at Pattison Avenue and three major stadiums. With the redevelopment of the Philadelphia Naval Yard directly to the south, a Health Impact Assessment report was issued in March of 2012 to determine if extending the line to the Naval Yard would be a viable option for commuters. It determined that extending the line to the Naval Yard would more than halve the number of private cars commuting back and forth, with the remainder taking the proposed subway line and/or using a bicycle sidepath. The HIA recommends making an extension of the Broad Street Line a priority, and recently, the extension has garnered much support.

====West and Southwest Philadelphia====

In 1916, The director of the Philadelphia department of city transit, William S. Twinning Proposed scrapping the initial plan of Building an elevated line along Woodland Avenue in Southwest Philadelphia that would’ve connect onto the existing Market Street Subway-Elevated at 32nd Street and planned to replace it with a branch of the Broad Street Subway that would have split off at Broad and Federal Streets, continued along Federal Street before merging onto Greys Ferry Avenue until the Schuylkill river. Then crossing the Schuylkill to merge with Woodland Avenue then continuing down Woodland and Island Avenues where the line would have ended. Twinning had an alternate plan which would’ve split off from the Broad Street subway at Broad and Ridge and continued down Ridge avenue before merging southwards onto 8th Street then, turning west on Walnut Street where it would have continued under the Schuylkill River into West Philadelphia before turning southward on 42nd Street then finally turning onto Woodland Avenue where it would have continued to Island Avenue. This alternate plan would officially be adopted by the city and authorized the construction of the subway-elevated line to southwest Philadelphia in 1922.

Ground broke along Ridge, 8th and Locust in 1930 and in 1932 Fairmount, Spring Garden, Vine(now Chinatown) and 8th and Market opened. Due to the worsening effects of The Great Depression, construction on Locust Street was paused indefinitely leaving an unfinished tunnel from 8th and Market to 18th and Locust. The city was able to gather limited funds from president Roosevelt&#x27;s new deal program for other subway projects but none for the Woodland line. In a report from the mid 40’s by the Department of city transit started to seriously consider finishing the subway to at least 49th and Woodland knowing that traffic from Camden and North Philadelphia alone couldn&#x27;t justify service under Locust Street. But in the end nothing came from these reports. By the ‘50s 9th/10th and Locust, 12th/13th and Locust and 15th/16th and Locust were furnished for passenger service and opened in 1953 servicing trains running on the Bridge line from Camden, New Jersey. Majority of passengers on the bridge line did not continue south of 8th-Market, Transferring the Market-Frankford or Ridge Avenue lines instead. In 1969 the Bridge line was extended to Lindenwold, New Jersey and ownership and operation were handed over to Delaware River Port Authority as the service was renamed to PATCO.

====Northwest====
The same report also proposed a northwest extension. This would have branched off at the North Philadelphia station and would have taken over the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Chestnut Hill Branch which is still operated today as part of the SEPTA Regional Rail system as the Chestnut Hill West Line.

==Operation==

===Rolling stock===

The first set of rail cars for the Broad Street subway was the B-1 cars built in 1926–27 by the J.G. Brill Company. The Pressed Steel Car Company supplied an additional set in 1938 collectively known as the B-2&#x27;s. The JG Brill Company also built and delivered 26 deluxe art-deco streamlined subway cars to the Delaware River Joint Commission in early 1936 for use on its Bridge Line from 8th and Market into Camden, NJ via the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. These cars were designed to be compatible with the other Broad Street cars, and could run in multiple with them. After the Bridge Line became part of the PATCO Lindenwold Hi-Speedline in late 1968, 23 of these former &quot;Bridge Line&quot; cars were sold to the City of Philadelphia in 1969 to be used on the Broad Street subway, and were designated as the B-3&#x27;s, until they were retired by early 1984.

The first set has had the second longest lifespan of any subway car in Philadelphia, after that of the Market Street cars built for what ultimately became the Market–Frankford Line. Although the line was a host for the UMTA&#x27;s State of the Art Car program, real replacements for the Broad Street cars did not come until late 1982, when SEPTA introduced new &quot;B-IV&quot; cars built by Kawasaki, which are currently the only cars operating the line. The cars are 67ft 6in long, 10ft 1.5in wide, and 12ft 3in tall.

==== Preservation ====

* A small number of B-1, B-2, and B-3 historic cars remain stored in derelict condition within Fern Rock yard.
* One B-1 car was sent and sold to the Trackside Brick Oven Pizzeria in Wallingford, Connecticut.
* One B-1 car (#55) is present at the Illinois Railway Museum.
* One B-3 car (#1009) is partially restored at the Rockhill Trolley Museum.
* Two B-3 cars (#1018, #1023) are at the Seashore Trolley Museum.

===Operating times and headways===
A local trip along the entire line takes about 35 minutes. Trains run from approximately 5:00am to 1:00am, with a timed transfer at 12:30am at City Hall station to connect with the Market Frankford Line based on final trains. The Broad Street Owl bus service replaces the subway throughout the night Monday through Friday mornings, stopping at the same locations as the subway trains. The line itself ran 24 hours a day until it was eliminated in 1991; it was reinstated on June20, 2014, for Friday and Saturday overnights only on a trial basis. It was made permanent on October8, 2014, due to the line successfully carrying an extra 10,000 riders on the Broad Street Line during the weekend overnight periods. This was eliminated again in 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

The local portion of the Broad Street Line carries a headway of 8 minutes or less during the daytime all day weekdays, 10–12 minutes all day on weekends and major holidays, and 12 minutes in the evenings. Weekend night service consists of a 20-minute frequency, while owl bus service early weekday mornings utilize a 15-minute frequency. The express portion of the line ranges from seven minutes during peak hours to 12 minutes off-peak, while the Broad Ridge Spur ranges from 7 minutes during peak hours to 20 minutes off-peak.

==Broad–Ridge Spur==

A two-track spur of the Broad Street Line, known as the Broad–Ridge Spur, diverges from the main line at Fairmount. Originally known as the Ridge–8th Street subway, the line follows Ridge Avenue, southeastward from the intersection of Broad Street, Ridge and Fairmount Avenues to a two-level junction beneath 8th and Race Streets, where tunnels leading to and from the Benjamin Franklin Bridge to Camden connect to it, then proceeds south under 8th Street. At its southern terminus at 8th and Market streets, passengers may transfer to the Market–Frankford Line and the PATCO Speedline. The spur operates Mondays through Saturdays from 6am to 9pm, running two-car trains (though platforms can fit five cars).

Ridge Spur service to 8th and Market streets began on December21, 1932. As part of that project, a tunnel shell running south under 8th Street then west under Locust Street to 18th Street (reusing parts of the never-completed Center City loop constructed in 1917) was completed in 1933 but not outfitted for service. Bridge Line service from 8th and Market to Camden began on June7, 1936, sharing the Ridge Spur platforms at 8th and Market and splitting off from the Ridge Spur just south of Chinatown station.

Beginning in June 1949, Ridge Spur and Bridge Line trains were through-routed at 8th and Market. The unused Locust Street tunnel was completed on February15, 1953; Bridge Line trains were extended to a new terminus at 15th–16th Street station with two intermediate stops, while Ridge Spur trains reverted to running between 8th Street and Girard. In January 1954, due to low ridership, off-peak service and Saturday again began operating between Girard and Camden, with a shuttle train operating between 8th and 16th stations. Sunday service was suspended at that time due to minimal usage. Ridge Spur service was suspended from August23 to 27, 1968, as tracks were switched to a new upper-level terminal platform at 8th Street station to allow conversion of the 8th–Locust Street subway into the Lindenwold High-Speed Line (PATCO Speedline).

The Ridge Spur was closed from February 1981 to September6, 1983, during construction of the Center City Commuter Connection. Spring Garden station, by then exit-only, was closed on September10, 1989, due to safety concerns. Never drawing high ridership, the spur has been proposed for closure on several occasions. The 2014 closure of the Gallery Mall, adjacent to 8th and Market station, caused ridership on the spur to drop by 25%.
==Stations==
All stations are located in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Stations on the Broad–Ridge Spur are shaded in gold. Stations served by special extended B2 service (for sports and entertainment events) are indicated with ○.

<doc id="902225" wikidata="Q5737016" url="?curid=902225" title="Here Come the Littles">
<text>Here Come the Littles is a 1985 animated fantasy film produced in France by DIC Enterprises, Inc. and distributed by Atlantic Releasing. It was directed by Bernard Deyriès and adapted by Woody Kling from John Peterson&#x27;s series of books, &quot;The Littles&quot;, and also based on the ABC television show of the same name.

&quot;Here Come the Littles&quot; follows a boy named Henry Bigg as he meets a family of miniature people that lives in his home. While his abusive uncle Augustus plans to build a shopping center at the site of his home, Henry teams up with the Littles to prevent this scheme.

&quot;Here Come the Littles&quot; was screened at weekend matinees during its original U.S. release, and made over US$6.5 million. It was not a critical success; reviewers found fault with the story and animation style. The film was released on VHS in late 1985, and on DVD in early 2004. Another &quot;Littles&quot; film, &quot;Liberty and the Littles&quot;, premiered on television in late 1986.

==Plot==
Henry Bigg learns that his parents have been lost during an archaeological trip to Africa, although the remains of their aircraft have been found. His housekeeper Mrs. Evans says his Uncle Augustus is his next of kin and therefore his legal guardian. Meanwhile, Tom and Lucy Little (two of the tiny people inside the walls of Henry&#x27;s house) snag an apple that Mrs. Evans had left for Henry. They repay the boy by finding his lucky rabbit&#x27;s foot and sneaking it in his suitcase. They are carried away to Augustus&#x27; house, trapped inside the luggage. Another two of the tiny creatures named Grandpa and Dinky soon find them as Grandpa is familiar with Augustus&#x27; nature.

Henry moves to Augustus&#x27; residence where Mrs. Evans states that she can&#x27;t join him because Augustus doesn&#x27;t need to have a housekeeper. While appearing friendly in the eyes of Mrs. Evans, he drops the routine when Mrs. Evans leaves and tells Henry that he will not have him shedding tears here as Augustus escorts him to his room.

The Littles see that Augustus treats Henry more like a slave and is planning on replacing his nephew&#x27;s house with a shopping mall. While the creatures try to escape, Henry discovers Grandpa and Dinky, not knowing who—or what—they are. Augustus also sees them, but mistaking them for toys, grabs them from Henry and locks them in the desk drawer in his study. Here, Dinky and Grandpa discover that Augustus forged the documents in order to become Henry&#x27;s legal guardian, as well as to steal and redevelop the Biggs&#x27; property.

To rescue those two, Lucy persuades Tom to talk to Henry—a bold move, considering that humans never knew about the creatures until recently. Grandpa and Dinky, whom Henry finds inside the study, both prove the evidence of Augustus&#x27; fraud. Before Augustus locks him inside his room, Henry soon creates a diversion allowing Tom and Lucy to save them.

Eventually, Lucy and Tom are hungry, and begin to search for food. Tom gets trapped in a jar of honey, and a change of plans ensues: the Littles must rescue Henry before they can save Tom. At first Grandpa resists, but consents since Henry have already met them.

After several attempts to escape, the Littles finally flee away aboard their gas-powered toy plane but cause a garage fire that wakes up Augustus. Henry attempts to go to the police station but gets lost and is eventually caught by his uncle. The Littles distract Augustus long enough for Henry to run down there. Meanwhile, Augustus orders the demolition crew by phone to start tearing down the Biggs&#x27; place.

When the Littles get to Henry&#x27;s house, they split up. Grandpa looks for Mr. and Mrs. Little while the others try to sabotage the bulldozer. Both plans succeed just in the nick of time. The moment Augustus arrives and learns what happened, Henry and a police officer arrive. As Augustus tries to flee in his car, the police officer arrests him for proposed illegal destruction to private property, forgery and child abuse.

Henry is reunited with Mrs. Evans and prepares to meet his rediscovered parents at the airport. He casts a knowing wink at the gate as the Littles watch on.

* Wally Burr - Recording director

==Release==
Along with &quot;The Smurfs and the Magic Flute&quot; and &quot;The Secret of the Sword&quot;, &quot;Here Come the Littles&quot; was among the first animated films handled by U.S. distributor Atlantic Releasing. The film was based on the ABC TV series of the same name, and produced in France by DIC Entertainment in conjunction with ABC.

&quot;Here Come the Littles&quot; was released theatrically in early 1985, and was released on the VHS format in late 1985 by CBS/Fox&#x27;s Playhouse Video label, under license from ABC Video Enterprises.

The VHS was re-released by BMG Kidz in late 1992 under the DIC Toon-Time Video label.

It was re-released on VHS and released on DVD by Sterling Entertainment on February 24, 2004. The DVD was re-issued by NCircle Entertainment on August 21, 2007.

In 1984, Scholastic Books published a 64-page tie-in adaptation of &quot;Here Come the Littles&quot; by Lorentz Carlson and John Lawrence Peterson.

==Reception==
===Box office===
During its run in the North American market, &quot;Here Come the Littles&quot; grossed over US$6.5 million through weekend matinee showings.

===Critical response===
&quot;Here Come the Littles&quot; was not well-received with critics, receiving generally mixed reviews. Candice Russell of the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot; wrote: &quot;[It] has all the panache of a Saturday morning cartoon and just about as much heart. It&#x27;s even in the same mode of repetitive crises every third minute.&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ film reviewer Charles Solomon in assessing &quot;Here Come the Littles&quot;, said: &quot;[It] boasts an international pedigree more complicated—and interesting—than its storyline.&quot; In his &quot;Movie Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin gave it 1½ stars out of four and called it a &quot;silly, boring animated effort&quot;. Likewise, the &quot;Blockbuster Entertainment Guide to Videos and Movies&quot; (1999) gave it two stars, and recommended it &quot;for fans of the &quot;Littles&quot; book series only&quot;. Jerry Beck, in his &quot;Animated Movie Guide&quot;, gave it only one star and commented: &quot;The film raises issues of homelessness, the loss of parents, and the importance of family and friends, in a mild, one-dimensional way.&quot; Along with Russell, he criticized the &quot;bland style&quot; of the animation, which was outsourced in Japan.

A review in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; stated that &quot;Here Come the Littles&quot; &quot;is an OK, though hardly memorable, entertainment for small children. Come to think of it, pity the runts of today who get nothing but mediocre big screen fare—when they get it at all&quot;.

==Sequel==
A made-for-television follow-up, &quot;Liberty and the Littles&quot;, aired on the ABC network in 1986 as part of its &quot;Weekend Special&quot; anthology series. It first aired in three parts of 30 minutes, on October 18, October 25, and November 1. In the film, the Littles fly to the Statue of Liberty, and come across a group of French relatives who are under a tyrant&#x27;s control.

According to one crew member, &quot;Liberty&quot; was planned for a theatrical release, but ended up on television because of a change in management during production.

<doc id="902229" wikidata="Q61121" url="?curid=902229" title="Hydra–Centaurus Supercluster">
<text>The Hydra–Centaurus Supercluster (SCl 128), or the Hydra and Centaurus Superclusters, was a previously defined supercluster in two parts, which prior to the identification of Laniakea Supercluster in 2014 is the closest neighbour of the former Virgo Supercluster. Its center is located about away, with it extending to a maximum distance of around .

== Physical characteristics ==
The supercluster includes four large galaxy clusters in the Centaurus part, also known as the &quot;4 clusters&quot; filament, or &quot;4 clusters strand&quot;:
*Abell 3526 (Centaurus Cluster)
*Abell 3565
*Abell 3574
*Abell 3581

The filament which also includes the major cluster Abell S753 and exends up to around to reach the rich galaxy cluster Abell 3581.

=== Antlia Wall ===
The Antlia Wall, also known as the Antlia Strand, Hydra Wall, Hydra-Antlia wall, Hydra-Antlia extension, and the Hydra-Antlia filament, is a filament that emeges from the Centaurus Cluster, passes under the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA) as the &quot;Puppis filament&quot;, to link up the Lepus Cloud. This filament then passes though a region containing the NGC 1600 Group before crossing the boundary where the gravitional flows of galaxies between the Laniakea and Perseus–Pisces superclusters diverge to link up with the Perseus–Pisces supercluster at a distance of around from the Centaurus Cluster. The filament contains two major clusters:
*Hydra Cluster (A1060) 
*Antlia Cluster (AS0636)
In 2014, it was revealed that the Antlia Wall along with the rest of the Hydra–Centaurus supercluster is connected to the Perseus–Pisces Supercluster. Later in 2017, Pomarède et.al identified based on the flow of galaxies that the Antlia Wall along with the Lepus Cloud are part of a substantial filament known as the Centaurus–Puppis–PP Filament that extends around from the Centaurus Cluster all the way to the Perseus–Pisces supercluster. The Centaurus–Puppis–PP Filament along with the Southern Supercluster Strand which contains the Eridanus-Fornax-Dorado Filament and the Telescopium−Grus Cloud, are part of wall that makes up the front boundary of the Sculptor Void.

Before 2017, it was not known that the Antlia Wall and the Lepus Cloud were part of the same structure, the Centaurus–Puppis–PP Filament. This is because the Centaurus–Puppis–PP Filament goes under the ZOA of the Milky Way, which caused parts of the filament to be obscured by the disk of the galaxy on the sky, resulting in the naming of the different visible pieces of filament.

==== Other clusters ====
Apart from the central clusters, which are 150 to 200 million light years away, several smaller clusters belong to the group.

Within the proximity of this supercluster lies the Great Attractor, dominated by the Norma Cluster (Abell 3627). This massive cluster of galaxies exerts a large gravitational force, causing all matter within 50 Mpc to experience a bulk flow of 600 km/s toward the Norma Cluster.

==Laniakea==
A 2014 announcement says that the Centaurus Supercluster (Hydra–Centaurus) is just a lobe in a greater supercluster, Laniakea, that is centered on the Great Attractor. That supercluster would include the Virgo Supercluster, therefore including the Milky Way where Earth resides.

<doc id="902233" wikidata="Q13076" url="?curid=902233" title="Alnitak">
<text>Alnitak is a triple star system in the constellation of Orion. It has the designations ζ Orionis, which is Latinised to Zeta Orionis and abbreviated Zeta Ori or ζ Ori, and 50 Orionis, abbreviated 50 Ori. The system is located at a distance of several hundred parsecs from the Sun and is one of the three main stars of Orion&#x27;s Belt along with Alnilam and Mintaka.

The primary star, Alnitak Aa, is a hot blue supergiant with an absolute magnitude of −6.0 and is the brightest class O star in the night sky with a visual magnitude of +2.0. It has two companions—Ab and B, the latter known for the longest time and the former discovered recently, producing a combined magnitude for the trio of +1.77. The stars are members of the Orion OB1 association and the association.

==Observational history==

Alnitak has been known since antiquity and, as a component of Orion&#x27;s Belt, has been of widespread cultural significance. It was reported to be a double star by amateur German astronomer George K. Kunowsky in 1819. Much more recently, in 1998, the bright primary was found by a team from the Lowell Observatory to have a close companion; this had been suspected from observations made with the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer in the 1970s.

The stellar parallax derived from observations by the &quot;Hipparcos&quot; satellite imply a distance around , but this does not take into account distortions caused by the multiple nature of the system. Larger distances, typically closer to , have been derived by many authors based on the orbit of the pair or the assumed properties of the components. This distance is comparable to the Orion molecular cloud complex, including the nearby Flame and Horsehead Nebulae.

==Stellar system==

Alnitak is a triple star system at the eastern end of Orion&#x27;s Belt, the second-magnitude primary having a 4th-magnitude companion nearly 3 arcseconds distant, in an orbit taking over 1,500 years.

The part called Alnitak A is itself a close binary, comprising the stars Alnitak Aa and Alnitak Ab.

Alnitak Aa is a blue supergiant of spectral type O9.5Iab with an absolute magnitude of −6.0 and an apparent magnitude of 2.0. It is estimated as being up to 33 times as massive as the Sun and a diameter 20 times greater. It is some 21,000 times brighter than the Sun, with a surface brightness (luminance) some 500 times greater. It is the brightest star of class O in the night sky. In about a million years, it will expand into a red supergiant wider than the orbit of Jupiter before ending its life in a supernova explosion, likely leaving behind a black hole.

Alnitak Ab is a blue subgiant of spectral type B1IV with an absolute magnitude of −3.9 and an apparent magnitude of 4.3, discovered in 1998.

A fourth star, 9th-magnitude Alnitak C, has not been confirmed to be part of the Aa–Ab–B group, and may simply lie along the line of sight.

The Alnitak system is bathed in the nebulosity of IC 434.

==Etymology and cultural significance==
ζ Orionis (Latinised as &quot;Zeta Orionis&quot;) is the star system&#x27;s Bayer designation and &quot;50 Orionis&quot; its Flamsteed designation.

The traditional name &quot;Alnitak&quot;, alternately spelled Al Nitak or Alnitah, is taken from the Arabic النطاق &quot;an-niṭāq&quot;, &quot;the girdle&quot;. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Alnitak&quot; for the star ζ Orionis Aa. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

===Orion&#x27;s Belt===
The three belt stars were collectively known by many names in many cultures. Arabic terms include النجاد &quot;Al Nijād&quot; &#x27;the Belt&#x27;, النسك &quot;Al Nasak&quot; &#x27;the Line&#x27;, العلقات &quot;Al Alkāt&quot; &#x27;the Golden Grains or Nuts&#x27; and, in modern Arabic, ميزان الحق &quot;Al Mīzān al Ḥaqq&quot; &#x27;the Scale of Justice&#x27;. In Chinese mythology they were known as The Weighing Beam.

The belt was also the Three Stars mansion (), one of the twenty-eight mansions of the Chinese constellations. It is one of the western mansions of the White Tiger.

In Chinese, (), meaning Three Stars (asterism), refers to an asterism consisting of Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka (Orion&#x27;s Belt), with Betelgeuse, Bellatrix, Saiph and Rigel later added. Consequently, the Chinese name for Alnitak is (, ). It is one of the western mansions of the White Tiger.

==Namesakes==
The USS &quot;Alnitah&quot; was a U.S. Navy &quot;Crater&quot;-class cargo ship named after the star.

<doc id="902251" wikidata="Q1059919" url="?curid=902251" title="Jason Bourne">
<text>Jason Bourne () is the titular character and the protagonist in a series of novels and subsequent film adaptations. The character was created by novelist Robert Ludlum. He first appeared in the novel &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (1980), which was adapted for television in 1988. The novel was adapted into a feature film of the same name in 2002 and starred Matt Damon in the lead role.

The character originally featured in three novels by Ludlum, released between 1980 and 1990, followed by eleven novels written by Eric Van Lustbader between 2004 and 2019, and five novels by Brian Freeman since 2020, with his sixth novel being released in early 2025. Along with the first feature film, Jason Bourne also appears in three sequel films &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; (2004), &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (2007), and &quot;Jason Bourne&quot; (2016), with Damon again in the lead role. Jeremy Renner stars in the fourth film of the franchise, &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot;, released in August 2012. Damon stated in interviews that he would not do another &quot;Bourne&quot; film without Paul Greengrass, who had directed the second and third installments. Greengrass agreed to direct Damon in the fifth installment in the franchise. Greengrass jointly wrote the screenplay with editor Christopher Rouse.

== Literary backstory ==
Jason Bourne is one of many aliases used by David Webb, a career Foreign Service Officer, and a specialist in Far Eastern affairs. Before the events in &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, Webb had a Thai wife named Dao and two children named Joshua and Alyssa in Phnom Penh. Webb&#x27;s wife and children were killed during the Vietnam War when a fighter plane strayed into Cambodia, dropped two bombs, and strafed a spot near the Mekong River. However, unknown to Webb, Joshua survived. Due to Cambodia&#x27;s neutrality in the war, every nation disclaimed the plane, and, therefore, no one took responsibility for the incident. Enraged by both the injustice and randomness of his loss, Webb went to Saigon and, under the careful guidance of friend and CIA officer Alexander Conklin, ended up training for an elite top secret Special Forces unit called &quot;Medusa&quot;. Within that select organization Webb was known only by his code name, &quot;Delta One&quot;.

=== Medusa ===
An assassination team or death squad, Medusa, was created to infiltrate Northern Vietnam and assassinate members of the Viet Cong and its collaborators. Its members were criminals; its leader, a man called Delta, ran Medusa with an iron fist. He became well known for his ruthlessness, his disregard for orders, and his disturbing success rate on missions, resulting in the kidnapping of Webb&#x27;s brother, U.S. Army Lieutenant Gordon Webb, during his tour of duty in Saigon.

During the mission to save Gordon Webb, an original &quot;Medusa&quot; team member named Jason Charles Bourne was discovered to be a double agent who alerted a large number of North Vietnamese soldiers to their whereabouts. When Delta found Bourne after killing his way through the North Vietnamese, he simply killed Bourne in the jungles of Tam Quan. Bourne&#x27;s execution was never exposed due to the top secret status of Medusa.

=== Operation Treadstone ===
Years later, a black ops arm of the CIA, called &quot;Treadstone Seventy-One&quot; after a building on New York&#x27;s Seventy-First Street, was formed to eliminate the notorious Carlos the Jackal. Webb was called up by David Abbott, nicknamed &quot;The Monk&quot;, to be its principal agent. At this point, Webb (Delta) took the identity of Jason Bourne, due to the actual Bourne&#x27;s status as MIA in the war, as well as the fact that Bourne was in reality a brutal killer with a long criminal record. The point was to turn &quot;Jason Bourne&quot; into an elite, ruthlessly efficient assassin who would be feared by terrorists and criminals worldwide. The assassin&#x27;s alias was &quot;Cain&quot;. The reasoning for creating such a myth was to create competition for the well-known assassin named &quot;Carlos&quot;, or &quot;Carlos the Jackal&quot; (real name Ilich Ramírez Sánchez) who at that time was considered the world&#x27;s best and most famous assassin. By creating this myth, Cain was to drive the reclusive Carlos out into the open &quot;long enough to put a bullet in his head&quot;.

== Film backstory ==
In the film series, Jason Bourne is revealed to have been born David Webb on September 13, 1970 (or June 4, 1978 in &quot;Jason Bourne&quot;; but, that could have been the birth-date of the actual Bourne) in Nixa, Missouri (although in &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, he is given a false date of April 15, 1971, as a coded reference to a specific site). In flashbacks, he joins the United States Army Delta Force and is eventually selected for the CIA Treadstone program in 1997. His father, Richard Webb, a senior CIA analyst, is responsible for creating Treadstone, a black ops project intended to train and deploy elite assassins. The CIA murders his father with a false flag car bomb in Beirut in a bid to recruit Webb.

The ploy worked; Webb approaches the CIA and is brought into the program by Neal Daniels, a supervisor in the Treadstone program, while being monitored by Dr. Albert Hirsch, who supervises the medical assessment of Treadstone agents. He is brought into a secret recruitment center in New York City, where Hirsch orders him tortured for days — via waterboarding and sleep deprivation — to break his spirit and allow him to be molded into an assassin. He is officially accepted when he murders an unidentified man (implied to be the real Jason Bourne) without question. After that, he is given a new identity as Jason Bourne, and his true identity becomes a classified secret.

After heavy training, in which he learns several languages and masters a wide array of martial arts skills, Bourne is placed in the Treadstone program, whose missions are run by Conklin. His first assignment, an unofficial one, is revealed to have happened in Berlin, Germany: the assassination of Vladimir Neski, a Russian politician who was intending to expose the theft of $20 million in secret funds stolen from the CIA by Treadstone&#x27;s Director, Ward Abbott, and a Russian oligarch, Yuri Gretkov. Under Conklin&#x27;s orders, Bourne murders Neski and his wife and makes it look like a murder-suicide.

Bourne works in the program as its top agent for three years, stationed in Paris, France, maintaining a secluded life while performing assassinations, mostly around Europe. His official handler is logistics agent Nicky Parsons, also stationed in Paris, who is implied to have feelings for Bourne that she keeps hidden from Treadstone employers.

The turning point in his life comes after an order to murder Nykwana Wombosi, an exiled African warlord who was blackmailing the CIA into reinstating him as head of state, lest he expose several CIA secrets. Using an alias, John Michael Kane, Bourne gathers information on Wombosi. He infiltrates the warlord&#x27;s yacht and hides inside it for five days, surfacing on a cold night in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, intending to arrange the murder to look like Wombosi was killed by a crew member. However, Wombosi is surrounded by his children, and Bourne is unable to bring himself to kill him. He tries to abandon the mission by leaving the boat, but an unknown person shoots him twice in the back, sending him off the yacht into the sea and triggering amnesia, causing Webb / Bourne to forget his identity.

== Appearances ==
=== Novels ===
The series has included nineteen novels which have been written by three authors, Robert Ludlum, Eric Van Lustbader and Brian Freeman. Ludlum&#x27;s series include the first three books, dubbed the Bourne trilogy. After Ludlum&#x27;s death in 2001, Lustbader took over the character in his own series of novels, which span eleven books through 2017. A twelfth novel, &quot;The Bourne Nemesis&quot;, was scheduled to be released in 2019, but as of July 2020 is no longer expected to be published. Freeman picked up the series and published the next five books. And book twenty, The Bourne Vendetta, is scheduled to be released in early 2025.

==== Written by Robert Ludlum ====

As he tries to reclaim his memory, Bourne attracts the attention of hostile people for reasons unknown to him. At a hotel, while cornered, Bourne takes a young woman, Marie St. Jacques, hostage to escape. Marie is an employee of the Government of Canada. Bourne and Marie discover that &quot;Jason Bourne&quot; is the cover identity of a contract assassin, and that both the CIA and another contract killer known as Carlos the Jackal have an interest in him. Marie is convinced that this man she has come to know cannot be the ruthless killer that all their discoveries seem to imply. She compels Bourne to continue searching for his true identity and, in the end, he finds the truth. Through this time, Bourne has the phrase &quot;Cain is for Charlie, and Delta is for Cain&quot; continually flash through his mind, propelling him in the direction of his mission.

===== &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; (1986) =====

Having recovered his memory and retired from the CIA, David Webb now teaches Asian Studies at a university in Maine and lives with Marie. She is taken captive seemingly by a powerful Chinese drug lord, but in reality, by the United States government using the fictitious drug lord as cover. The scheme is an attempt to turn Webb back into his former self, the mythical Jason Bourne, to go after a Bourne impostor in China. The phony Bourne has been credited with a Far East political assassination that could, in a worst-case scenario, cause a Chinese civil war over the ownership of Hong Kong.

===== &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (1990) =====

As an aging Carlos the Jackal&#x27;s infamy fades, he decides that he will do two things before he dies: kill Jason Bourne and destroy the KGB facility of Novgorod, where the Jackal was trained and later turned away. Webb&#x27;s family is forced to hide in the Caribbean while Webb himself works with Conklin to hunt down and kill the Jackal. Webb poses as an important member of Medusa, now a nearly omnipotent economic force that controls the commander of NATO, leading figures in the Defense Department, and large NYSE firms. The plan is to use Medusa&#x27;s resources to contact the Jackal. Webb just misses the Jackal several times before Webb fakes his own death to draw him out. Following this, the Jackal turns to his second goal. Webb tracks the Jackal down with the help of Conklin and a KGB agent as the Jackal begins destroying the KGB compound. In a final confrontation, the Jackal is led into a dam lock in which he drowns, and Webb returns to his family.

==== Written by Eric Van Lustbader ====
===== &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot; (2004) =====

Following the events of &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot;, Jason Bourne has returned to his life as David Webb, a professor of linguistics at Georgetown University. However, his peace is soon disrupted. A silenced gunshot narrowly misses Webb, triggering the reemergence of the Bourne persona. His first priority is to find Conklin. Unbeknownst to Bourne, a Hungarian named Stepan Spalko has set a trap for him—one that proves difficult to escape. Meanwhile, the assassin who targeted him at Georgetown remains in pursuit, intent on continuing the hunt.

===== &quot;The Bourne Betrayal&quot; (2007) =====

Jason Bourne takes a mission to rescue his only friend in the CIA, Martin Lindros, who disappeared in Africa while tracking shipments of uranium. Once safely back in America, Lindros persuades Bourne to help track the money trail of terrorists buying the nuclear material in Odessa. But once there, Bourne is hampered by confusing flashbacks of unfamiliar places and events and he wonders if someone is brainwashing him in order to throw him off the trail, or worse, if the man he saved in Africa is really Martin Lindros. Now, Bourne must gather evidence while trying to stay one step ahead of the terrorists who won&#x27;t let anyone stand in their way.

===== &quot;The Bourne Sanction&quot; (2008) =====

Jason Bourne returns to Georgetown University, and the world of his mild alter ego, David Webb, hoping for normality. But, after so many adrenaline-soaked years of risking his life, Bourne finds himself chafing in the quiet life of a linguistics professor. Aware of his frustrations, his academic mentor, Professor Specter, asks for help investigating the murder of a former student. The young man died carrying information about a group&#x27;s terrorist activities, including an immediate plan to attack the United States. The organization, the Black Legion, and its plot have also popped up on the radar of the Central Intelligence Agency, whose new director Veronica Hart is struggling to assert her authority. Sensing an opportunity to take control of the CIA by showing Hart&#x27;s incompetence, National Security Agency operatives attempt to accomplish what the CIA never could do, hunt down and kill Jason Bourne. In Europe, Bourne&#x27;s investigation into the Black Legion turns into one of the deadliest and most tangled operations of his double life—while an assassin is getting closer by the minute.

===== &quot;The Bourne Deception&quot; (2009) =====

Bourne&#x27;s nemesis, Arkadin, is still hot on his trail, and the two continue their struggle, reversing roles of hunter and hunted. When Bourne is ambushed and badly wounded, he fakes his death and goes into hiding. In safety, he takes on a new identity, and begins a mission to find out who tried to assassinate him. Jason begins to question who he really is, how much of him is tied up in the Bourne identity, and what he would become if that was suddenly taken away from him. Meanwhile, an American passenger airliner is shot down over Egypt by what seems to be an Iranian missile. A massive global investigative team is assembled to get at the truth of the situation before it can escalate into an international scandal. Bourne&#x27;s search for the man who shot him intersects with the search for the people who brought down the airliner, leading Bourne into one of the most deadly and challenging situations he has ever encountered. With the threat of a new world war brewing, Bourne finds himself in a race against time to uncover the truth and find the person behind his assault, all the while being stalked by his unknown nemesis.

===== &quot;The Bourne Objective&quot; (2010) =====

&quot;The Bourne Objective&quot; is the eighth novel in the Bourne series, and the fifth written by Eric Van Lustbader. The book was released in 2010, sequel to &quot;The Bourne Deception&quot;.

The killing of an art dealer dredges up snatches of Jason Bourne&#x27;s impaired memory, in particular the murder of a young woman who entrusted him with a strangely engraved ring. Now he&#x27;s determined to find its owner and purpose. But Bourne never knows what terrible acts he&#x27;ll discover he committed when he digs into the past. The trail will lead him to a vicious Russian mercenary, Leonid Arkadin, also a graduate of the Central Intelligence training program Treadstone. The covert course was shuttered by Congress for corruption, but not before it produced Bourne and Arkadin, giving them equal skills, equal force, and equal cunning. As Bourne&#x27;s destiny circles closer to Arkadin&#x27;s, it becomes clear that someone else has been watching and manipulating them.

===== &quot;The Bourne Dominion&quot; (2011) =====

Jason Bourne is searching for an elusive cadre of terrorists planning to destroy America&#x27;s most strategic natural resources—and needs the help of his longtime friend, General Boris Karpov. Karpov, the newly appointed head of Russia&#x27;s most feared spy agency, FSB-2, is one of the most determined, honorable, and justice-hungry men that Bourne knows. But Karpov has made a deal with the devil. In order to remain the head of FSB-2, he must hunt down and kill Bourne. Now, these two trusted friends are on a deadly collision course. From the Colombian highlands to Munich, Cádiz, and Damascus, the clock is counting down to a disaster that will cripple America&#x27;s economic and military future. Only Bourne and Karpov have a chance to avert the catastrophe—but if they destroy each other first, that chance will be gone forever.

===== &quot;The Bourne Imperative&quot; (2012) =====

The tenth book in the series was published on June 5, 2012. The man Jason Bourne fished out of the freezing sea is near death, half-drowned and bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound. He awakens with no memory of who he is or why he was shot, and Bourne is eerily reminded of his own amnesia. Then Bourne discovers that the Mossad agent named Rebeka is so determined to find this injured man that she has gone off the grid, cut her ties to her agency, and is now being stalked by Mossad&#x27;s most feared killer. The answers to these mysteries may lie back in southeast Lebanon, in a secret encampment to which Bourne and Rebeka escaped following a firefight weeks ago. The complex trail links to the mission given to Treadstone directors Peter Marks and Soraya Moore: find the semi-mythic terrorist assassin known as Nicodemo. In the course of Bourne&#x27;s desperate, deadly search for a secret that will alter the future of the entire world, he will experience both triumph and loss, and his life will never be the same. Now everything turns on the amnesiac. Bourne must learn his identity and purpose before both he and Rebeka are killed. From Stockholm to Washington, D.C., from Mexico City to Beijing, the web of lies and betrayals extends into a worldwide conspiracy of monumental proportions.

===== &quot;The Bourne Retribution&quot; (2013) =====

The eleventh book in the series was published on December 3, 2013. Bourne&#x27;s friend Eli Yadin, head of Mossad, learns that Ouyang Jidan, a senior member of China&#x27;s Politburo, and a major Mexican drug lord may have been trafficking in more than drugs. Yadin needs Bourne to investigate. Bourne agrees, but only because he has a personal agenda: Ouyang Jidan is the man who ordered Rebeka—one of the very few people Bourne has ever truly cared about—murdered. Bourne is determined to avenge her death, but in the process he becomes enmeshed in a monstrous worldwide scheme involving the Chinese, Mexicans, and Russians. Bourne&#x27;s desperate search for Ouyang takes him from Tel Aviv to Shanghai, Mexico City, and, ultimately, a village on China&#x27;s coast where a clever trap has been laid for him. Bourne finds himself pursued on all sides and unsure whom he can trust.

===== &quot;The Bourne Ascendancy&quot; (2014) =====

The twelfth book in the Bourne series was published on June 10, 2014. Bourne has been hired to impersonate a high-level government minister at a political summit meeting in Qatar, shielding the minister from any assassination attempts. Suddenly, armed gunmen storm the room, killing everyone but Bourne. Their target, however, isn&#x27;t the minister Bourne impersonates...it is Bourne himself.

Kidnapped and transported to an underground bunker, Bourne finds himself face-to-face with an infamous terrorist named El Ghadan (&quot;Tomorrow&quot;). El Ghadan holds as his captive Soraya Moore, former co-director of Treadstone, and a close friend to Bourne, along with her two-year-old daughter.

Meanwhile, the President of the United States is in the midst of brokering a historic peace treaty between the Israelis and the Palestinians—an event that El Ghadan is desperate to prevent. He demands that Bourne carry out a special mission: kill the President. If Bourne refuses, Soraya and her daughter will die. Bourne must make a monstrous choice: save Soraya and her daughter, or save the President.

===== &quot;The Bourne Enigma&quot; (2016) =====

The Bourne Enigma is the thirteenth novel in the Bourne series, published on June 21, 2016. On the eve of Russian general Boris Karpov&#x27;s wedding, Jason Bourne receives an enigmatic message from his old friend and fellow spymaster. In Moscow, what should be a joyous occasion turns bloody and lethal. Now Bourne is the only one who can decipher Karpov&#x27;s cryptogram. He discovers that Karpov has betrayed his sovereign to warn Bourne of a crippling disaster about to be visited on the world. Bourne has only four days to discover the nature of the disaster and stop it.

The trail Karpov has been following leads Bourne to Cairo and the doorstep of Ivan Borz, the elusive international arms dealer infamous for hiding behind a never-ending series of false identities, a man Bourne has been hunting ever since he abducted former Treadstone director Soraya Moore and her two-year-old daughter and brutally murdered Soraya&#x27;s husband.

Bourne must travel to war-torn Syria and then Cyprus as he chases the astonishing truth. The clock is ticking, and Bourne has less than four days to solve Karpov&#x27;s riddle—and hunt down Borz—if he hopes to prevent a cataclysmic international war.

===== &quot;The Bourne Initiative&quot; (2017) =====

&quot;The Bourne Initiative&quot; is the fourteenth novel in the Bourne series, and was published in June 2017. Gen. Boris Karpov, head of the feared Russian FSB, is dead. But Karpov has reached out from the grave with an unstoppable cyber operation he conceived in the months before his murder, aimed at the heart of the United States—a way to steal the president&#x27;s nuclear launch codes. Who has taken over the operation? Karpov trusted only one man: Jason Bourne. But can Bourne be working against his own country? Gen. Arthur MacQuerrie, chief of the Dreadnaught Section of NSA and Morgana Broussard, head of the mysterious Meme, LLC, are convinced of Bourne&#x27;s treasonous act, and will do everything in their power to kill him.

Flushed from cover, hunted by the best assassins in the business, wounded and nearly killed, Bourne&#x27;s only hope is to join forces with his bitterest enemy, a Somali magus named Keyre, whose terrorist forces Bourne once decimated. Now Keyre is more powerful than ever, with a burgeoning international network—a man who can help Bourne, but to what end? Lying in wait is the young woman Bourne saved from Keyre&#x27;s torture, who now calls herself the Angelmaker. Both seductive and deadly, the Angelmaker loves Bourne, watches over him, but from whom does she take her orders? Is she ally or adversary?

These are questions Bourne must answer before he can unravel the mystery of Boris Karpov&#x27;s last legacy, a weaponized code that may very well bring about the unthinkable: a violent end to America.

===== &quot;The Bourne Nemesis&quot; (2019) =====

&quot;The Bourne Nemesis&quot; is the fifteenth novel in the Bourne series, and had been scheduled to be published in 2019, but missed its publication date and no future publication date was given.
Jason Bourne returns. He&#x27;s fought against the NSA, Black off-site cyber operations, a Somali terrorist organisation and been accused of treason against the US. Now the Russians have planted a mole to uncover Bourne&#x27;s secrets and launch cyber-warfare against the United States. 
Meanwhile, Bourne&#x27;s former colleague, Soraya Moore, needs his help. Six highly skilled field agents have disappeared, the body parts of three found in a national park in Georgia. Facing death and destruction in the shadows of civilisation, Bourne will battle his deadliest nemesis yet.

==== Written by Brian Freeman ====
===== &quot;The Bourne Evolution&quot; (2020) =====
But when a congresswoman is assassinated in New York, Bourne is framed for the crime, and he finds himself alone and on the run, hunted by both Treadstone and the tech cabal that had hired him. In his quest to stay one step ahead of his enemies, Bourne teams up with a journalist, Abbey Laurent, to figure out who was behind the frame-up and to learn as much as he can about the ever-growing threat of the mysterious Medusa group. As more and more enemies begin to hunt Bourne, it&#x27;s a race against the clock to discover who led him into a trap...and what their next move may be.

===== The Bourne Treachery (2021) =====

===== The Bourne Sacrifice (2022) =====

===== The Bourne Defiance (2023) =====

===== The Bourne Shadow (2024) =====
The Bourne Vendetta (2025)

A hacked database known as the Files—a treasure trove of secrets capable of upending the world&#x27;s balance of power -- a digital Pandora’s box containing incriminating information on the world&#x27;s most powerful individuals, making it the ultimate tool for blackmail or protection of the deep state. Governments and shadowy operatives alike are in a desperate race to seize control of it. 

Jason Bourne is drawn into the chaos when he discovers the Files have fallen into the hands of Cody, a ruthless Russian criminal operating out of Estonia. Cody has his own designs for the Files, aiming to leverage them to reshape international power dynamics. But he’s not the only player in the game. Rogue ex-Treadstone agent Johanna, whose shadowy motives intertwine with Bourne’s past, is also after the laptop holding the Files. Meanwhile, intelligence agencies like the FBI, CIA, NSA, and foreign adversaries all have their sights set on the prize, creating a deadly landscape where no one can be trusted.

As Bourne navigates the labyrinth of intrigue, betrayal, and violence, he must outwit enemies on all sides, including some who were once allies. Shadow, a formidable force with ties to the Files, enters the fray, threatening to upend Bourne&#x27;s mission and force him to confront buried truths about Treadstone, his own identity, and the legacy of the assassin he once was.

=== Television ===
In 1988, a two-part made-for-television movie of &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; aired on ABC. It starred Richard Chamberlain as Jason Bourne and Jaclyn Smith as Marie St. Jacques. The TV movie was largely faithful to Robert Ludlum&#x27;s novel, both in plot as well as in the portrayal of the character of Jason Bourne.

A spin-off of the Universal-produced film franchise entitled &quot;Treadstone&quot; began airing in October 2019 on USA Network. It explores the origins of the Treadstone program and operatives other than Bourne. Producer Ben Smith, who worked on the recent two &quot;Bourne&quot; films, said the show will tie into the next film in the franchise.

=== Film ===
The Jason Bourne novels were adapted into a series of films – &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (2002), &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; (2004), &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (2007), &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot; (2012), and &quot;Jason Bourne&quot; (2016). The films retain the titles and some base elements but otherwise feature different plots independent of the novels. In these films, Bourne is portrayed by Matt Damon.

Bourne does not appear in &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot;, with the exception of his picture being featured in the film as well as brief discussions of how he&#x27;s caused problems to the organization he worked for. As a result, the film focuses on the fallout in the intelligence community from Bourne&#x27;s actions in &quot;Ultimatum&quot;. &quot;Legacy&quot; features Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, an operative in a different clandestine program evolved from Treadstone.

In 2019, Damon reprised his role as the fallen angel Loki from the View Askewniverse film &quot;Dogma&quot; (1999) in &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot; in a cameo appearance; in the film, Loki indicates that he was Jason Bourne, having lived Bourne&#x27;s life and that of Damon&#x27;s in the films&#x27; fictional universe.

=== Video games ===
A video game titled &quot;Robert Ludlum&#x27;s The Bourne Conspiracy&quot; was released in 2008 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

The Ludlum estate obtained the rights to the video game franchise and sold it to Electronic Arts in 2009. EA planned to make several &quot;Bourne&quot; games. Their first game was to have been developed by Starbreeze Studios, but has since been shelved.

Radical Entertainment were reportedly developing a Bourne game titled &quot;Treadstone&quot; after a former animator of the now-defunct developer released a rough test reel, but it has since been canceled.

<text>Ecorse Township is a defunct civil township in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan.

==Description==
The township consisted of 54 mi2 (140 km2), which included two small islands in the Detroit River. It was bordered to the north by Springwells Township with the boundary being the River Rouge. To the west it was bordered by Dearborn and Taylor Townships, with the primary boundary being Pelham Road. To the south it was bordered by Monguagon Township, and a small part of Brownstown Township, with the primary boundary being Pennsylvania Road. Finally, to the east, it was bordered by the Detroit River.

Organized in 1827, the entire township has since been incorporated, and includes the cities of Melvindale, Allen Park, Lincoln Park, River Rouge, Ecorse, Southgate, Wyandotte, and the Boynton and Oakwood Heights neighborhoods of Detroit.

==History==
Although French explorers, missionaries, and traders frequented the area, the first existing record of a white settler owning land dates to 1776, when the Pottawatomi ceded a large tract of land to Pierre St. Cosme. One boundary of the ceded land came to be known as &quot;St. Cosme Line&quot; and later became part of the route of Southfield Road. In the late 18th century, many land grants in the area were awarded by the French crown. 

The first known permanent settler in what would become Ecorse Township was Pierre Michel Campau, who arrived in 1795. He settle in Southgate, which subsequently became a farming community. Other people from the Detroit area at the Rouge and Detroit Rivers followed him to Southgate. Some records indicate settlers near the mouth of the Ecorse River as early as 1764.

The township was established on April 12, 1827 along with eight other townships by the Michigan Territorial Legislature in a major reorganization of Wayne County.

<text>Nicolas Mesnager (or Le Mesnager or Ménager) (1658–1714) was a French diplomat.

Le Mesnager belonged to a wealthy merchant family, forsaking a commercial career, to become a parliamentary lawyer for Rouen under the Ancient régime. In 1700 he was sent as Rouen&#x27;s Advocate-Deputy to the Council of Commerce held in Paris convened to promote trade agreements for France. At Versailles he made his mark, thereafter being nominated to go on three missions to Spain, between the years 1704 and 1705, to negotiate financial arrangements. In Spain he was appointed Harbor Master of Cadiz and he helped improve trade with the Spanish colonies.

In August 1711 he was sent on a secret mission to London to detach Great Britain from its alliance against France, and succeeded in securing the adoption of eight articles which formed the base of the later Treaty of Utrecht.

His negotiating and diplomacy skills were rewarded by his being one of the three French Plenipotentiaries deputed to Utrecht in January 1712, having the honour of signing the Treaty in the following year. His appointment as &quot;Ambassadeur&quot; was a form of recompense by King Louis XIV for Ménager&#x27;s spending a fortune in diplomatic efforts; he was also awarded a Crown pension and created a Count (for life).

As a further show of recognition, he was offered a granddaughter of the Sun-King as wife; he married Louise-Emilie de Vautédard (1694–1719), an illegitimate daughter of Louis, Grand Dauphin of France (1661–1711).

A portrait of him by Hyacinthe Rigaud hangs at the Palace of Versailles.

Both Queen Anne of Great Britain and King Philip V of Spain granted Nicolas Ménager (&quot;comte de Saint-Jean&quot;) coats of arms.

<doc id="902267" wikidata="Q13468119" url="?curid=902267" title="Brewster's Millions">
<text>Brewster&#x27;s Millions is a comedic novel written by George Barr McCutcheon in 1902, originally under the pseudonym of Richard Greaves.

The plot concerns a young man whose grandfather leaves him $1 million in a will, but a competing will from another relative requires he must spend the $1 million in the first year or forfeit a $7 million inheritance from the other relative.

It was adapted into a play in 1906, which opened at the New Amsterdam Theatre on Broadway, and the novel or play has been adapted into films thirteen times.

==Plot summary==
The novel revolves around Montgomery Brewster, a young man who inherits one million dollars from his rich grandfather. Shortly after, a rich uncle also dies. This uncle hated Brewster&#x27;s grandfather, a long-held grudge stemming from the grandfather&#x27;s disapproval of the marriage of Brewster&#x27;s parents. The uncle will leave Brewster seven million dollars, but only under the condition that he keeps none of the grandfather&#x27;s money. Brewster is required to spend every penny of his grandfather&#x27;s million within one year, resulting in no assets or property held from the wealth at the end of that time. If Brewster meets these terms, he will gain the full seven million; if he fails, he remains penniless.

Brewster finds that spending so much money within the course of a year is incredibly difficult under the strict conditions imposed by his uncle&#x27;s will. Brewster is required to demonstrate business sense by obtaining good value for the money he spends, limiting his donations to charity, his losses to gambling, and the value of his tips to waiters and cab drivers. Moreover, Brewster is sworn to secrecy, and cannot tell anyone why he is living to excess. Working against him are his well-meaning friends, who try repeatedly to limit his losses and extravagance even as they share in his luxurious lifestyle.

Brewster&#x27;s challenge is compounded by the fact that his attempts to lose money through stock speculation and roulette prove to increase his funds rather than decrease them. He throws large parties and balls, and charters a cruise lasting several months to Europe and Egypt for his large circle of friends and employees; the press lampoons him as a spendthrift. Despite his loose purse strings, Brewster repeatedly demonstrates a strong moral character. At one point, he uses his funds to bail out a bank to save his landlady&#x27;s account, despite risking his eligibility for the will. At another, he jumps overboard to save a drowning sailor from his cruise even as his rich friends choose not to.

Brewster&#x27;s would-be wife Barbara Drew turns down his marriage proposal early in the year, believing him to be financially irresponsible and bound to a life of poverty, and his attempts to win her back repeatedly fail as his attention is entirely absorbed by the requirement to spend so much money. At the conclusion of the year, he succeeds in spending the last of his funds, which he has meticulously documented, and confesses his love to another woman, Peggy Gray, who has been sympathetic to his lifestyle despite knowing nothing about his challenge. Disaster strikes the night before the deadline, as his lawyers informed him that the executor of his uncle&#x27;s will has vanished after liquidating all of the assets. Brewster convinces himself that he is doomed to poverty, but marries Peggy Gray, who accepts him despite the lack of wealth. Shortly after the wedding, the executor of his uncle&#x27;s will arrives to inform him that he has successfully met the challenge and that he has come to deliver the money to Brewster in person.

==Film, theatrical, television, and radio adaptations==

===Film versions===
The novel &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; has been adapted into many films:

===Television adaptation===
In the TV episode &quot;Punky&#x27;s Millions&quot;, from the animated version of &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;, Punky and her father Henry appear on a TV show trying to win the $40 million prize. In order to claim the grand prize, they must spend one million dollars in 48 hours. To make sure that the money would not be spent all at once on something very expensive (e.g., a villa as suggested by one of Punky&#x27;s friends), a rule states the money cannot be used to buy any single item for more than $10,000. Also, every single item purchased must be donated. When the deadline passes, Punky and Henry seem to have won, but one of Punky&#x27;s friends, Allen, forgot to spend the 98 cents he got as change when he bought chocolate, so they lose the game. Fortunately, they had been donating their purchases to a local orphanage, and one of the dollars they spent was on a lottery ticket, which wins $100,000 for the orphanage.

===Radio adaptation===

On February 15, 1937, the &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; presented a one-hour version of the play starring Jack Benny. The show was modified for Benny: the title character in this version is named Jack Benjamin Brewster; and the character opens the play&#x27;s first scene by playing Benny&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Love in Bloom&quot;, on the violin.

Playing opposite Benny is his real-life wife and the co-star of his long-running radio show, Mary Livingstone. Livingstone plays Brewster&#x27;s girlfriend, here called Mary Gray.

The casting of Benny as a character who must spend money was considered humorous in itself, as it contrasted sharply with Benny&#x27;s well-known radio persona as a miser.

<text>The Exclusive Brethren are a subset of the Christian evangelical movement generally described as the Plymouth Brethren. They are distinguished from the Open Brethren from whom they separated in 1848.

The Exclusive Brethren are now divided into a number of groups, most of which differ on minor points of doctrine or practice. Perhaps the best-known of these, mainly through media attention, is the Raven-Taylor-Hales group, now known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, which maintains the doctrine of uncompromising separation from the world based on their interpretation of 2 Corinthians 6 and 2 Timothy 2, believing that attendance at the Communion Service, the &#x27;Lord&#x27;s Supper&#x27;, governs and strictly limits their relationship with others, even other Brethren groups.

The Brethren groups have one fellowship in some 19 countries – including France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Argentina, Jamaica, Barbados, St Vincent and the Grenadines, but they are more numerous in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and North America, where they are referred to as the &quot;Exclusive Brethren&quot; or just the &quot;Brethren&quot;.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===
The Plymouth Brethren split into Exclusive and Open Brethren in 1848 when George Müller refused to accept John Nelson Darby&#x27;s view of the relationship between local assemblies following difficulties in the Plymouth meeting. Brethren that held Muller&#x27;s congregational view became known as &quot;Open&quot;, those holding Darby&#x27;s &#x27;connexional&#x27; view, became known as &quot;Exclusive&quot; or &quot;Darbyite&quot; Brethren.

Darby&#x27;s circular on 26 August 1848, cutting off not only Bethesda but all assemblies who received anyone who had ever attended Bethesda, was to define the essential characteristic of &quot;exclusivism&quot; that he was to pursue for the rest of his life. He set it out in detail in a pamphlet he issued in 1853 entitled &quot;Separation from Evil – God&#x27;s Principle of Unity&quot;. But a tension had existed since the earliest times, as set out in a letter from Anthony Norris Groves in 1836 to Darby (who was not a believer in adult baptism):

Some will not have me hold communion with the Scotts, because their views are not satisfactory about the Lord&#x27;s Supper; others with you, because of your views about baptism; others with the Church of England, because of her thoughts about ministry. On my principles, I receive them all; but on the principle of witnessing against evil, I should reject them all.
For most of his life, Darby was able to hold the exclusives together, although several longtime members had seceded after accusing him of similar errors about the nature of Christ&#x27;s humanity of which he had accused Benjamin Wills Newton. The Central Meeting in London (London Bridge) would communicate with the other assemblies and most difficulties were eventually smoothed over.

But shortly before he died in 1882, things started to fall apart. It all started from an initiative in 1879 of Edward Cronin, one of the Dublin founding members, that paralleled Darby&#x27;s initiation of a new assembly at Plymouth thirty years before. Some members had left a failing assembly in Ryde and Cronin travelled down to break bread with them. When he reported back to London, different assemblies took differing views of his action. Though Darby was sympathetic in private he attacked him fiercely in public. By 1881 an assembly in Ramsgate had itself split over the issue and the division, over an issue not of doctrine or principle but church governance, became irrevocable.

The excluded party became known as the &quot;Kelly Brethren&quot;, although William Kelly remained devoted to the memory of Darby and edited his collected papers. But after another division in 1885, three years after Darby&#x27;s death, when a London assembly excommunicated a brother in Reading over the &quot;standing&quot; of a Christian, the minority in the resultant split (Stuarts) adopted a more &quot;open&quot; approach to fellowship, as did those who followed Grant in America.

A more serious split occurred in 1890 around the teaching of F. E. Raven of Greenwich. &quot;The seceders from his communion falsely accused him of denying the orthodox doctrine of the union of the Divine and the human natures in the Man Christ Jesus – not indeed in a Unitarian, but in a Gnostic sense.&quot; After furious strife in which the leading opponent was William Lowe, many of the remaining assemblies in Britain stayed with Raven but those on the continent separated whilst the American assemblies were split.

=== 20th century ===
Not all of the people remaining in fellowship with Raven agreed with him and this led in 1908–9 to further splits, initiated by actions of the Glanton assembly in Northumberland over dissensions in the neighbouring Alnwick assembly. Once more assemblies had to decide which side to support and this included those as far away as Melbourne, Australia. Thus the &quot;Ravens&quot; and the &quot;Glantons&quot; were established. In the same year a festering disagreement in Tunbridge Wells led to a minor breakaway from the &quot;Lowe&quot; group by a number of assemblies.

A further division took place in 1970. By this time, James Taylor, Jr. had come to control what had been the Raven group. At a meeting in Aberdeen, Scotland, on 25 July, it was alleged Taylor&#x27;s behaviour was improper. His host published a long letter of protest which was sent to the New York assembly. Taylor immediately rejected these accusations as lies and the incident definitively divided the Brethren membership worldwide. Very few based near the scene of the events stayed in fellowship with Taylor – only two families in Aberdeen and 200 out of 3,000 members in Scotland remained. Altogether, over 200 such assemblies in England, Scotland and Ireland seceded from the Taylor group, according to a 1971 listing.

Others, especially those further afield, believed Taylor&#x27;s line that he was a &quot;pure man&quot; and that this incident was used by God to expose his enemies. Following this incident, those who separated from Taylor &quot;rolled back&quot; the changes in doctrine and practice that he had introduced, reverting to the teachings that had been followed in the time of his father, James Taylor, Sr., who had led the movement from 1905 till his death in 1953. This fellowship further fragmented in 1972, and the party which broke away has since further sub-divided.

However, the history of Exclusive Brethren is not only one of division. Eventually several of the groups realised that the divisions caused by personalities clashes or ecclesiastical issues were no longer relevant and reunions occurred. The Kelly and Lowe groups reunited in 1926 to form the &quot;Lowe-Kelly&quot; group, in 1940 with most of Tunbridge Wells and in 1974 with the Glantons and are sometimes known as &quot;Reunited Brethren&quot;. There was a further split in 2000, catalysed by tensions concerning Willem Ouweneel, one of the &#x27;Dutch Five&#x27; in 1995. Their ageing congregations have often not been replenished, and are dwindling. Most of the Grant party merged with the Open Brethren in 1932.

Most Exclusive Brethren have traditionally been described as &quot;Darbyite&quot; as they adhere in the main to the original doctrines and teachings of John Darby, and do not accept the concept of a doctrine that evolves through the teachings of successive leaders. Neither do they accept the concept that teachings of church leaders are authoritative, divinely sanctioned, and binding on those in fellowship, as is the belief of the Raven/Taylor/Hales Brethren.

== Characteristics of the Exclusive Brethren ==
=== Overview ===
At one time, all Exclusive Brethren groups believed that there was a necessary unity of the local church or assembly, but some who once were in fellowship with the Raven/Taylor/Hales group have become independent companies modifying their requirements for receiving members to suit individual conscience. Amongst such groups views concerning their way of life and relationships are frequently affected by the varying standards in the general community.

This is expressed practically in different ways by the different groups, but matters of fellowship and church discipline used to be generally not merely questions of local responsibility; such decisions would have been accepted in all meetings. Exclusive Brethren were therefore sometimes described as Connexional Brethren, as they recognised an obligation to accept and adhere to the disciplinary actions of other associated assemblies. For example, where one of their branches had excluded a person from Christian fellowship, that person remained excluded from all other branches, who must then treat the excluded person as a leper (according to the book of Leviticus ). This is still the practice amongst the Brethren and no doubt would be claimed by other independent assemblies.

There are common threads throughout all Plymouth Brethren groups, most notably the centrality of the Lord&#x27;s Supper (Holy Communion) in the weekly calendar as well as the format of meetings and worship: the distinctions between the many groups are generally not well understood by non-members. The adjective &quot;exclusive&quot; has been applied to the groups by others, partially due to their determination to separate from and exclude what they believe to be evil. Exclusive Brethren usually disown any name and simply refer to themselves as &quot;Christians&quot;, &quot;brethren&quot;, &quot;those with whom we walk&quot;, &quot;those in fellowship with us&quot;, or &quot;the saints&quot;. However, the Raven/Taylor/Hales group being the most universally identifiable has attracted the term &quot;Exclusive Brethren&quot; and accepted its application to themselves as meaning, the exclusion of, or withdrawal from, evil.

Dissecting the history and branches of the Exclusive Brethren, particularly in the 20th century, can be a challenge as there has been no formal mechanism for documenting their movement&#x27;s history.

=== Beliefs and structure ===
With the exception of the hardline Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC), Exclusive Brethren differ very little from the Open Brethren on theological issues, both holding the Bible as their sole authority in regard to matters of doctrine and practice. Like the Exclusives, Open Brethren have traditionally based much of their doctrine on the teachings of John Nelson Darby. With few exceptions, particularly in regards to whom to accept into fellowship, exclusive brethren have continued to hold the same beliefs that inspired the early Plymouth Brethren.

Exclusive Brethren reject evolution, and if their children attend state schools they are withdrawn from lessons on this. They do not believe that women should have authority over men. They hold to the concept of the Rapture and the End Times. In the 1960s, the group&#x27;s teachings were that members could not join trade unions or professional associations, as this was mixing too much with the world.

The centrality of the Lord&#x27;s Supper (Holy Communion) is one of the primary linking threads between the different Brethren groups; however, it is also one of the primary differentiators between the various Exclusive Brethren sub-groups: there are exclusive groups which receive all professing Christians to communion, and there are exclusive groups which restrict access to communion to those who are known to be in their fellowship. The PBCC are generally regarded as having the most stringent and uncompromising views on this. However, only two of their services are closed to those who are not members in good standing, the Lord&#x27;s Supper and the monthly Care Meeting, with well-disposed members of the public free to come into Gospel Preachings and other meetings.

Most Exclusive Brethren groups have no formal leadership structure. In many assemblies, matters up for debate may be discussed at special meetings attended solely by adult males called, in some groups, &quot;Brothers Meetings&quot;. As a result, schisms can occur in the Brethren over disagreements about church discipline and whether other sister groups in other locations have authority to intervene in these disagreements. There are often global family connections due to the emphasis among members to marry within the Exclusive Brethren, and family connections often influence which side of the issue members will take. The PBCC avoid this trend by having a structured leadership with a central authority figure which has maintained unity through the upholding of a universal standard.

Some Exclusive Brethren assemblies &quot;commend&quot; men who are dedicated to the work of preaching. Although they usually do not receive a salary, gifts are often given to them by the separate assemblies where they preach and teach.

Exclusive Brethren do not generally name their meeting rooms or Halls except by reference perhaps to the road, e.g. Galpins Road Meeting Room, Mallow Street Hall. The meeting room or Hall is often referred to as &quot;The Room&quot; or &quot;The Hall&quot;. Notice boards give the times of Gospel Preachings with a formula such as &quot;If the Lord will, the Gospel will be preached in this room Lord&#x27;s Day at 6.30.&quot; Meeting rooms of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, perhaps the most hardline of the Exclusive Brethren groups, have notice boards indicating that the building is a place registered for public worship and give a contact number for further information.

Unlike the Open Brethren, whose assemblies usually do not have an official membership, Exclusive Brethren are more particular about affiliation, as people who wish to break bread must be affiliated with a &quot;local assembly&quot; to which they are responsible in terms of lifestyle choices.

=== Worship ===
Hymns are a vital part of the worship of Exclusive Brethren. One of the unifying features in each of the different branches of the Brethren is a common hymnbook. The first collection used among the united assemblies was, &quot;Hymns for the Poor of the Flock,&quot; from 1838 and again in 1840. Another such hymnbook, used by Exclusive Brethren (Tunbridge-Wells and Ames) dating back to 1856 is called, &quot;Hymns and Spiritual Songs for the Little Flock,&quot; the first edition of which was compiled by G.V. Wigram.

A revision was made in 1881 by J.N. Darby. The Little Flock hymnbook has gone through many different editions in different languages. In modern times one of the more commonly used English hymn books in British and North American assemblies is &quot;The Believers&#x27; Hymn Book&quot;. Most branches of Exclusive Brethren use one of the many editions of the Little Flock Hymn Book. All editions come from the same source: J.N.Darby&#x27;s hymnbook of 1881 which drew on earlier work by George V. Wigram.

Some Exclusive meetings seat accepted men (men who are &quot;in fellowship&quot;) in the front rows toward the table bearing the emblems, with accepted women behind the men, and unaccepted men and women toward the rear. Other Exclusive meetings seat accepted men and women together (so spouses can be seated together), and unaccepted men and women towards the rear in the &quot;Seat of the Unlearned&quot; or &quot;Seat of the Observer&quot;.

Women in Exclusive Brethren gatherings wear a headcovering, which is often a headscarf, shawl or mantilla, in keeping with .

=== Numbers ===
It is difficult to number the Exclusive Brethren, with the exception of the Raven/Taylor/Hales group, of which there are approximately 46,000 meeting in 300 church assemblies in 19 countries, with strongest representation in Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, and North America. Other Exclusive groups now number only 2–3,000 in the UK, but there are larger numbers on the European continent and also in North America.

== Film portrayal ==
The Exclusive Hales branch of the Plymouth Brethren are portrayed in the film &quot;Son of Rambow&quot; as trying to restrict the creativity and freedom of the film&#x27;s main character. The Plymouth Brethren are also featured in the book &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot; by Peter Carey, and in the film adaptation. Oscar is raised by a strict Plymouth Brethren father and rebels by becoming an Anglican priest.

== Criticism ==
Some have criticised the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC), the subgroup of the Exclusive Brethren that has attracted the most media coverage, for its policy of separating itself from other orthodox Christian denominations, and because it prohibits radio and television, limits the use of computers and discourages socialising with people outside the movement.

Critics of the PBCC have accused it of using cult-like techniques by controlling all aspects of its members&#x27; lives. The group uses a technique of &quot;withdrawing from&quot; or shunning members who are believed to have offended. The group&#x27;s control over its members is such that many who have left the group have had trouble adjusting to everyday life outside. In some cases people have killed themselves in distress. To help with this problem, several websites have been set up by ex-members to assist people who have left the church to adjust into mainstream society.
Involvement of members of the Exclusive Brethren Church in New Zealand in electioneering led to criticism in the context of the 2005 New Zealand election funding controversy. The church distributed political material criticising the New Zealand Labour Party government, and the leader of the opposition party admitted knowledge of the church&#x27;s activities. More recently, the church also hired private investigators to conduct surveillance on ex-members who had criticised the church. There has also been criticism of the church&#x27;s practice of &quot;shutting up.&quot;

<text>Breckin Meyer (born May 7, 1974) is an American actor, writer, and producer. He is best known for his work on the Adult Swim animated sketch series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, which has earned him two Annie Awards and five Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

Meyer gained traction with main roles on the ABC sitcom &quot;The Jackie Thomas Show&quot; (1992–1993) and the NBC sitcom &quot;The Home Court&quot; (1995–1996), alongside supporting roles in the films &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot; (1991), &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995), and &quot;The Craft&quot; (1996). He had his breakout with the lead role in the sex comedy film &quot;Road Trip&quot; (2000). Meyer followed this with starring roles in the films &quot;Rat Race&quot; (2001), &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot; (2001), and &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (2002). He received further recognition for his role as Jon Arbuckle in &quot;&quot; (2004) and &quot;&quot; (2006). Meyer has also had starring roles in the films &quot;&quot; (2005), &quot;Ghosts of Girlfriends Past&quot; (2009), &quot;Changeland&quot; (2019), and &quot;Unpregnant&quot; (2020).

Meyer had lead roles as Tom Wagner on the ABC sitcom &quot;Married to the Kellys&quot; (2003–2004) and Jared Franklin on the TNT legal comedy-drama series &quot;Franklin &amp; Bash&quot; (2011–2014), as well as a main role on the ABC series &quot;The Fix&quot; (2019). He created the TBS sitcom &quot;Men at Work&quot; (2012–2014). Meyer had a main voice role as Joseph Gribble on the Fox animated sitcom &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (2000–2010).

==Early life==
Meyer was born on May 7, 1974, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Dorothy Ann (née Vial), a travel agent and former microbiologist, and Christopher William Meyer, a management consultant. He has lived in California, Texas, West Virginia, and New Jersey. He has an older brother, Frank, and a younger brother, Adam. Meyer attended elementary school with Drew Barrymore (and was apparently her first kiss) and also attended Beverly Hills High School. Through his elementary school, he came into contact with Barrymore&#x27;s agent, who signed Meyer. As a little boy, he was mostly seen in television advertisements, and also appeared as a child participant in the game show &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;. He also claims to have slept in a closed coffin for several years in high school.

==Career==
Meyer played several roles as a druggie, starting with his debut in &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot; (1991), in which he was dispatched in a video game. His breakthrough screen role was in the teen hit &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995) as the skateboarding stoner. Meyer offered similar characterizations in &quot;The Craft&quot; and John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; (both 1996). He played the best friend of an Olympic hopeful in the biopic &quot;Prefontaine&quot; (1997) and a high-school student yearning to leave his hometown in &quot;Dancer, Texas Pop. 81&quot; (1998).

In &quot;54&quot; (also 1998), a look at life in the famous &#x27;70s nightspot Studio 54, the actor was cast as a busboy married to the coat check girl (Salma Hayek) and pursued by a bartender (Ryan Phillippe). Meyer is close friends with Phillippe, with whom he and Seth Green share a production company.

Meyer would subsequently appear in films including &quot;Go&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Insider&quot; (1999) before graduating to a full-fledged leading role in the DreamWorks hit &quot;Road Trip&quot; (2000), in which he again played a character traveling cross country, a college student hoping desperately to retrieve a videotape of himself having sex with another girl, which was accidentally mailed to his long-distance girlfriend.
He re-teamed with Amy Smart in yet another racing cross country film, this time as part of the multi-plot ensemble of &quot;Rat Race&quot; (2001), a sort-of homage to the all-star screwball chase films of the 1960s, such as &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;. Meyer put in a supporting turn as Meg Ryan&#x27;s character&#x27;s brother in the whimsical fantasy-comedy &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot; (2001). Meyer also took on the role of Jon Arbuckle, the hapless owner of the famed comic strip cat in the film adaptation of &quot;&quot; (2004).

Meyer also starred in &quot;Blue State&quot; (2007) with Anna Paquin in which he plays a passionately liberal guy on the campaign trail for John Kerry in the 2004 elections. He drunkenly pledges to move to Canada if Bush wins the election, and on his journey meets a mysterious young woman, played by Paquin. He co-starred with Matthew McConaughey in &quot;Ghosts of Girlfriends Past&quot; (2009). Meyer starred opposite Emily Kinney and Giselle Eisenberg in the independent dark comedy &quot;The Enormity of Life&quot; (2021) about a suicidal man struggling with life and love.

Meyer regularly does writing and voice work on &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, and was nominated for an Emmy for his writing on the &quot;Robot Chicken: Star Wars&quot; specials. He also voiced the adolescent Joseph Gribble on the animated series &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and starred on the Adult Swim series &quot;Titan Maximum&quot;.

Meyer is also a musician, playing drums in the punk band The Street Walkin&#x27; Cheetahs as well as with artists including The Nightwatchman, Ben Harper, Cypress Hill, Slash and Perry Farrell at L.A.&#x27;s Hotel Café.

Meyer is the former drummer for Tom Morello&#x27;s side project The Nightwatchman&#x27;s back-up band The Freedom Fighter Orchestra. He toured with Morello on The Nightwatchman&#x27;s 2008 Justice Tour. He appears in Street Sweeper Social Club&#x27;s video for &quot;100 Little Curses&quot; and &quot;Promenade&quot;.

==Personal life==
Meyer married screenwriter and film director Deborah Kaplan on October 14, 2001, and has two daughters with her. They divorced in 2014.

<doc id="902278" wikidata="Q3087464" url="?curid=902278" title="The Sleepy Jackson">
<text>The Sleepy Jackson are an Australian alternative rock band formed in Perth, Western Australia. The band&#x27;s name was inspired by a former drummer who was narcoleptic. The band revolves around the distinctive vocal style of multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Luke Steele. Stemming from a musical family, Luke&#x27;s father Rick Steele is a local blues musician, and two of Luke&#x27;s siblings are also musicians, with brother Jesse a former member of The Sleepy Jackson (and currently performing with father Rick in The Hot Biscuit Band), and sister Katy, who fronts another Perth rock band, Little Birdy. While a series of acclaimed EPs brought The Sleepy Jackson to a broader musical attention of Australia, it was the release of their 2003 album &quot;Lovers&quot; and 2006 second album &quot;Personality – One Was a Spider, One Was a Bird&quot; that directed significant international focus upon the band.

==History==
===1998–2002 : Formation and early EP===
The Sleepy Jackson formed in 1998 with the original lineup featuring Luke Steele (vocals and guitars), Jesse Steele (drums), and Matthew O&#x27;Connor (bass). This lineup recorded a self-titled debut EP and a subsequent single titled &quot;Miniskirt.&quot; Both recordings were independently released. Dan Bull joined the lineup in 1999 as the band&#x27;s first live keyboard player (who later played keys with Eskimo Joe at their live performances).

In 2000, as a result of non-musical commitments, Luke suggested that his brother should redirect his attentions and concentrate on other happenings in his life which ultimately resulted in Jesse following his advice and departing the band.

The void created by Jesse Steele&#x27;s departure was filled by Paul Keenan (who later drummed with Eskimo Joe at their live performances). Along with numerous shows in their hometown of Perth, in late 2000 The Sleepy Jackson toured nationally with Jebediah. In March 2001, on the eve of the band&#x27;s signing with EMI Records, the band toured with Magic Dirt and Motor Ace with Ronan Charles on keyboards joining Steele, O&#x27;Connor and Keenan. Five weeks into the tour, with the band broke, exhausted, and sleeping in caravan parks rather than enjoying the luxuries their touring partners were enjoying, O&#x27;Connor, Keenan and Charles quit, leaving Luke Steele to complete the tour solo.

Upon signing to EMI in 2000, pressure was soon placed on Steele to produce a recording. The result was the 2001 EP titled &quot;Caffeine in the Morning Sun&quot;, which Steele recorded in Sydney with a collection of session musicians. In addition to playing solo, Steele recruited drummer Malcolm Clark into The Sleepy Jackson fold and, when some serious touring was required in support of the release, the services of Justin Burford (guitar) and Rodney Aravena (bass) were enlisted. In addition to The Sleepy Jackson, Steele&#x27;s three colleagues were also playing around their hometown with Jonathon Dudman under the name End of Fashion.

The Sleepy Jackson relocated to Sydney, where they recorded another EP, &quot;Let Your Love Be Love&quot;, in late 2002. Songs from this EP and &quot;Caffeine in the Morning Sun&quot; were compiled together to form a self-titled mini-album for release in the UK market in February 2003. A period of extensive touring quickly followed, which saw the band playing in Australia, the United States, and Europe. The latter brought the band some very enthusiastic attention from UK music magazine &quot;NME&quot;.

===2003–2005: &quot;Lovers&quot;===
In between live appearances, The Sleepy Jackson worked on recordings that were to become their debut album &quot;Lovers&quot;, which was released in June 2003. During a series of UK appearances in 2003, Burford and Aravena left the band. With a support slot for Silverchair&#x27;s &quot;Diorama&quot; tour looming back in Australia, replacements were quickly sought. Clarke called upon the only other End of Fashion member not previously part of The Sleepy Jackson, Jonathon Dudman.

Dudman joined the band in Sydney, where he took over bass duties, and the second guitarist position was filled by session musician Ben Nightingale. The Sleepy Jackson&#x27;s revolving door continued when Nightingale was ultimately replaced by Jonathon Dudman&#x27;s brother, Julian Dudman. But the Dudmans subsequently left the band, leaving Luke Steele and Malcolm Clark as the only official members of The Sleepy Jackson.

In 2005, singer-songwriter Ben Lee referenced The Sleepy Jackson in his hit song &quot;Catch My Disease&quot;.

===2006–2007: &quot;Personality – One Was a Spider, One Was a Bird&quot;===
The Sleepy Jackson released their second studio album &quot;Personality – One Was a Spider, One Was a Bird&quot; in Australia on 1 July 2006, where it debuted at number 10 on the Australian Albums Chart the following week. Later that July, the album was nominated for a J Awards. 
The band supported the new album&#x27;s worldwide release with a series of live appearances in select markets. Joining Steele and Clark were Dave Symes and Felix Bloxsom, who both worked on the album, and Lee Jones who was formerly in the Perth band Spencer Tracy. Bloxsom has since been replaced by Luke&#x27;s brother Jake and Luke&#x27;s wife Jodi, a.k.a. &quot;Snappy Dolphin,&quot; which also brought a change from organic percussion instruments to computer samples backing the band.

In 2007, The Sleepy Jackson performed at the 2007 Big Day Out, the Southbound festival, the Falls Festival and the St. Jerome&#x27;s Laneway festivals in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. Also in 2007, Steele provided slide guitar to the song &quot;Waiting All Day&quot; by Silverchair on their fifth album &quot;Young Modern&quot;. Steele also appeared on the Pnau single &quot;With You Forever,&quot; leading Nick Littlemore to state on Pnau&#x27;s website &quot;...working with Luke Steele... it was amazing, that inspired [me] to work on a separate project with him all together. It&#x27;s another album we&#x27;re doing.&quot;

The Sleepy Jackson contributed to Yoko Ono&#x27;s album &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m a Witch&quot;, in 2007 with a remix of the song &quot;I&#x27;m Moving On&quot;.

===2008 onwards===
The status of the band following the completion of touring for the second album is uncertain, with the band&#x27;s official website no longer active. 

In late May 2013, as part of an interview for the second Empire of the Sun album &quot;Ice on the Dune&quot;, Steele revealed that a third Sleepy Jackson album was heard by the band&#x27;s record label but a lack of subsequent interest meant that it was never released. As of 22 May 2013, Steele is focused on completing a collaboration with fellow Australian musician Daniel Johns and promotion for &quot;Ice on the Dune&quot;, with the latter released on 14 June 2013. Steele stated that he intends to release the third album prior to 2023 and that a release date during 2013 was highly unlikely. Meanwhile, Clark completed a tour as the drummer of Australian artist Bob Evans&#x27;s backing band in mid-May 2013.

==Side projects==
In late 2007, Steele formed the electropop duo Empire of the Sun with Littlemore. Empire of the Sun released its debut album &quot;Walking on a Dream&quot;, in addition to two single releases, &quot;Walking on a Dream&quot; and &quot;We Are the People&quot;. The project gained success in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom (UK), Ireland and some parts of Europe in 2008. At the 2009 Australian Recording Industry Association Music (ARIA) Awards, Empire of the Sun received four awards: &quot;Best Group&quot;, &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, &quot;Single of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Pop Release&quot;.

As of May 2013, Steele stated that he is completing a recording project that he commenced with Johns at his Newcastle, Australia studio in 2008. In a 2013 interview, Steele explained: &quot;Me and Daniel Johns have been in the studio working on our record, and we’re just about ready to try and finish that off. The sessions we did lately sound a bit like The Clash, Talking Heads … inspired by African music. So it&#x27;s going to be good to do some tougher, hard-edged kind of stuff.” In 2008 the name of the project was &quot;Hathaway and Palmer&quot;, according to a radio interview that Steele conducted, but this has not been confirmed since.

In early 2009, Clark joined The Exploders, a Melbourne-based band, whose members include former Sleepy Jackson bassist Jonathon Dudman (aka J. Cortez). In 2010, Clark and Dudman joined Jeff Martin of The Tea Party in a new band, &quot;Jeff Martin 777&quot;—the band released its debut album &quot;The Ground Cries Out&quot; in early 2011.

Clark has undertaken the role of drummer in the touring band of Australian singer-songwriter Kevin Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Bob Evans&quot; moniker. Clark has joined Mitchell during the tours for the albums &quot;Goodnight Bull Creek!&quot; and &quot;Familiar Stranger&quot;.

<text>&quot;Istrian scale&quot; refers both to a &quot;unique&quot; musical scale and to the folk music genres from Istria and Kvarner which use that scale. It is named for the Istrian peninsula. Istrian folk music is based on a distinctive six-tone musical scale (the so-called Istrian scale), and the peninsula&#x27;s two-part, slightly nasal singing. The two-part singing and playing in the Istrian scale, a traditional singing practice characteristic of the Istrian region and the north Adriatic coastal area and islands, was inscribed in UNESCO&#x27;s &quot;List of Intangible Cultural Heritage&quot; in 2009.

Genres include &quot;kanat&quot; and &quot;tarankanje&quot;; techniques include nasal tone, variation and improvisation, and resolution to the unison or octave; and instruments include double reeds such as &quot;sopele&quot;, shawms, bagpipes, and other instruments such as flutes and &quot;tambura&quot; lutes. It was first named by Ivan Matetić Ronjgov early in the twentieth century, assisting his study and notation of Croatian music.

==Description==
Non-equal-tempered, the scale could approximately be notated as: E-F-G-A-B-C [hexatonic] (see: enharmonic), the first six notes of an octatonic scale on E. It may be thought of in various ways, such as the Gregorian Phrygian mode with lowered 4th, 5th, and 6th degrees (on E: E-F-G-A-B-C-D [heptatonic]). Performances feature diaphony and the Phrygian cadence (in E: F and D moving to E).
Though, &quot;relative intonation var[ies] considerably from example to example [and between instruments],&quot; the scale has also been described as derived from just intonation: subharmonics seven to fourteen (approximately D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D&#x27;)( and ).

In Haydn&#x27;s String Quartet in F minor, Op. 20 No. 5, something like the Istrian mode, but without its top note, is found. Uroš Krek&#x27;s &quot;Inventiones ferales&quot; (1962) uses the scale, &quot;in a disguised manner&quot;. Tartini may have studied the scale, and Bartók took note of the scale. Karol Pahor&#x27;s cycle of 15 pieces, &quot;Istrijanka&quot; (1950), was the result of study of the Istrian mode, as was Danilo Švara&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia da camera in modo istriano&quot; (1957). The Istrian mode occurs in Josip Štolcer-Slavenski&#x27;s &quot;Balkanofonija&quot; (1927).

Throughout the areas of Istria and the Kvarner Gulf the distinctive vocal singing has spread, consisting of alternating half and whole steps, which, particularly in older singers&#x27; and instrumentalists&#x27; renditions, are untempered. The songs are sung by pairs of singers (male, female, or mixed) in a characteristic two-part polyphony in minor thirds (or major sixths) with a cadence to a unison or an octave. Singers distinguish the higher (&quot;na tanko&quot; &quot;thin&quot;) part from the lower (&quot;na debelo&quot; &quot;fat&quot;).

<text>Alexander Nikolayevich Shelepin (; 18 August 1918 – 24 October 1994) was a Soviet politician and intelligence officer. A long-time member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, he served as First Deputy Prime Minister, as a full member of the Politburo and as the chairman of the KGB from December 1958 to November 1961. He continued to maintain decisive influence in the KGB until 1967; his successor as chairman of the KGB, Vladimir Semichastny, was his client and protégé.

Intelligent, ambitious, and well-educated, Shelepin was the leader of a hard-line faction within the Communist Party that played a decisive role in overthrowing Nikita Khrushchev in 1964. Opposed to the policy of détente, he was eventually outmaneuvered by Leonid Brezhnev and gradually stripped of his power, thus failing in his ambition to lead the Soviet Union.

==Early life==
Alexander Shelepin was born in Voronezh on 18 August 1918 to a middle-class family, the son of Nikolai Shelepin, a railway official. A talented student, he graduated from the Moscow Institute of Philosophy and then obtained a master&#x27;s degree from the Moscow Institute of History. He started his political career in the Communist Youth League (Komsomol) while still a student, and already in his teens he had expressed his desire to become a party leader.

==World War II and service under Stalin==
Shelepin briefly served in the Red Army in 1940, during the last stages of the Winter War against Finland, and after the Nazi invasion in 1941, he helped organize the guerrilla partisan movement in the Moscow region; after the notorious execution by the Nazis of Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya (whom Shelepin had personally selected), he caught the eye of Joseph Stalin himself, and his political fortune was made. He became a senior official of the Komsomol, working in the All-Union Secretariat in Moscow, and was then named General Secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, an international youth organization recognized by the United Nations and granted general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. In 1952, in one of Stalin&#x27;s last personnel reshuffles, Shelepin became First Secretary of the All-Union Komsomol.

==Service under Khrushchev==
Though closely identified with Stalin (and being somewhat of a favorite of his), Shelepin was not affected by De-Stalinization and the gradual consolidation of power by Nikita Khrushchev after Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953. Indeed, Khrushchev personally liked Shelepin and, because of his rise through the Communist Youth League, saw him as an ally against the secret police and security agencies that had been all-powerful under Stalin. Shelepin accompanied Khrushchev on the Soviet leader&#x27;s trip to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1954, and met with Mao Zedong. Following this, he mobilized thousands of young communists in support of Khrushchev&#x27;s ‘Virgin Lands’ program.

In early 1958, Khrushchev appointed Shelepin as Central Committee Secretary in charge of the Party Organs Department, and, in December 1958, Shelepin became the Chairman of the Soviet central intelligence and security service, the KGB, replacing Army General Ivan Serov. Khrushchev saw Shelepin as a very good choice for KGB chief, for several reasons; Shelepin&#x27;s background completely outside state security, his higher education and intellectual approach greatly distinguished him from his predecessors, and his appointment was intended to improve the public image of the KGB.

Shelepin attempted to return state security and intelligence to its position of importance during the Stalinist era. However, the people he favored were completely different from those preferred by his predecessors. With Khrushchev&#x27;s full backing, Shelepin recruited many young university graduates to the KGB (especially favoring those with a background in law and the social sciences) and he demoted or fired many career state security officers, replacing them with officials from Communist Party organizations, and, especially, from the Communist Youth League. As a result of Shelepin&#x27;s ambitious policy, the KGB became a substantially different organization from the Stalin-era security services, with a more sophisticated and intellectual approach, that would be further encouraged by future Chairman Yuri Andropov.

Shelepin proposed and carried out the destruction of many documents related to the Katyn massacre of Polish officers to minimize the chance that the truth would be revealed. His 3 March 1959 note to Nikita Khrushchev, with information about the execution of 21,857 Poles and with the proposal to destroy their personal files, became one of the documents that were preserved and eventually made public.

The policy of providing KGB support to left-wing nationalist liberation movements in wars of national liberation in Latin America, Asia and Africa was another important innovation of Shelepin&#x27;s new approach as KGB Chairman, adopted during the summer of 1961 by Khrushchev and the Central Committee following a detailed proposal by Shelepin. Fidel Castro and Cuba strongly supported an aggressive policy of military assistance to national liberation movements with Che Guevara, in co-operation with Ben Bella of Algeria, also playing a leading role.

==Coup against Khrushchev==
Shelepin left the KGB in November 1961 on being promoted to a position as Secretary of the Central Committee, from where he still exercised control over the KGB, which was taken over by his client and protégé Vladimir Semichastny. He also had powers of supervision over justice and transport. In 1962, Khrushchev also made him chairman of the powerful new Committee of Party and State Control, and First Deputy Prime Minister.

He was a principal player in the coup against Khrushchev in October 1964, obviously influencing the KGB to support the conspirators.

Shelepin&#x27;s reward was to be made a full member of the most important political body, the Politburo, in November 1964, following the successful overthrow of Khrushchev —by a significant margin its youngest member, at the age of 46. He was also the only Politburo member who was simultaneously a member of the secretariat, and of the Council of Ministers.

Shelepin probably expected to become First Secretary and &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the USSR. He controlled the KGB and led a large hard-line faction within the Party. Alexander Solzhenitsyn suggested that Shelepin had been the choice of the surviving Stalinists, who asked &quot;what had been the point of overthrowing Khrushchev if not to revert to Stalinism?&quot;

As far as his own views on the role of Soviet policy went, Shelepin opposed the relaxation of tensions with the United States in foreign affairs, and favored a return to domestic policies that promoted discipline and centralization within the wider Union.

However, he lacked influence in the military, and was viewed very suspiciously by most Central Committee and Government officials outside his faction, who were well-aware of his ambitions.

==Fall from power==
Shelepin&#x27;s colleagues on the Politburo watched him carefully, seeking to halt his ambitions. The first blow was the abolition of the Party-State Control Committee in December 1965, as a result of which he lost his status as Deputy prime minister. From 1965 to 1970 witnessed the systematic dismissal of his most powerful allies within the Party and Government.

In May 1967, Shelepin underwent an emergency operation on his appendix, which kept him in hospital for eight days. In his absence, the Politburo decided, after a discussion lasting ten minutes, to sack his ally, Semichastny, and appointed Yuri Andropov Chairman of the KGB. In July 1967, Shelepin was ousted from his position as a party secretary, and demoted to the chairmanship of All-Union Trade Union Council, though he survived as a full member of the Politburo.

In April 1975, he visited Great Britain at the invitation of the TUC, but cut short his visit after two days, instead of the planned four days, because of hostile demonstrations that he blamed on &#x27;Zionists&#x27;, though it is unlikely that many of the protestors were Jews, because it was Passover. He was removed from the Politburo upon his return, on 16 April. On 22 May 1975, it was announced that he had resigned from his position as Chairman of the Trade Union council. He was deputy chairman of the USSR State Committee for Vocational Education until he retired in 1984.

Brezhnev was able to outmaneuver Shelepin, as his approach was more nuanced and more acceptable to the average Party official. Shelepin wanted centralization, discipline and strict oversight of officials domestically, and confrontation on all fronts with the United States abroad; whereas Brezhnev was happy to offer predictability, stability and job security to the party officials, and pursue a balanced foreign policy, combining détente with proxy wars.

Shelepin died in Moscow on 24 October 1994, at the age of 76, and was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery.

The line follows the path of former Metro Transit bus route 16 along University Avenue and Washington Avenue (which runs from downtown Minneapolis through the University of Minnesota main campus). It is the second light-rail line in the region, after the Blue Line, which opened in 2004 and connects Minneapolis with the southern suburb of Bloomington.

Construction on the Green Line began in late 2010. It opened to the public on June 14, 2014. The travel time between the downtown Minneapolis and downtown St. Paul stops is about 46 minutes. The entire line originally operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but as of 2019 trains are replaced by buses from 2 am to 4 am on weekdays. In 2018, the line carried a total of 13.8 million passengers.

== History ==

===Former streetcar and bus lines===
The route is a descendant of the Twin City Rapid Transit Company&#x27;s St. Paul–Minneapolis streetcar line, also referred to as the Interurban line. Streetcars became practical along the route with the advent of electrification, and full service began along the route on December 9, 1890. In the 1950s, a decision was made to convert the streetcar system to buses. Streetcar service along the Interurban line ended in Saint Paul on October 31, 1953, and the route was the last to carry passengers in the city. Service continued a short while longer in Minneapolis, until November 28. However, due to fragmentary service elsewhere in Minneapolis, streetcars continued to use the tracks along University Avenue to reach the shops at Snelling Avenue in Saint Paul until June 1954.

The route 16 bus was developed to replace the streetcar, and followed the route of the modern-day Green Line. Other parallel service included freeway express service on route 94 and limited-stop service to the University of Minnesota on route 50. Twin City Lines continued to privately operate buses until 1970, when the company was taken over by the Metropolitan Transit Commission, a precursor to Metro Transit.

===Proposals===
In 1972, the Regional Fixed Guideway Study for the Metropolitan Transit Commission (the forerunner of today&#x27;s Metro Transit) proposed a $1.3 billion 37- or 57-mile (sources differ) heavy-rail rapid transit system, but the then-separate Metropolitan Council disagreed with that idea – refusing to even look at the plan – and continuing political battles meant that it was never implemented. The Met Council had its own plans for bus rapid transit in the metropolitan region. Another system using smaller people movers was proposed in the 1975 Small Vehicle Fixed Guideway Study and gained the most traction with the Saint Paul city council, but was eventually dropped in 1980.

In the 1980s, light rail was proposed as an alternative and several possible corridors were identified, including the Central Corridor line which had a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) drawn up in 1982. It took another two decades before the Blue Line light rail line began operation. It began service on June 26, 2004, just over 50 years since the last regular-service streetcar ran on June 19, 1954.

===Central Corridor Coordinating Committee===
The &quot;Central Corridor Coordinating Committee&quot; was a workgroup in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area set up to explore transit options for the Central Corridor, the interurban corridor roughly following University Avenue in the Twin Cities area. After a long period of examination, this committee narrowed transit options for the corridor from a broad universe of choices to just three: a no-build option where services are only incrementally improved, a bus rapid transit (BRT) option, wherein buses run on semi-dedicated transitway, and a light rail transit (LRT) option using light rail vehicles (LRVs). In May 2006 the CCCC concluded its study by publishing a Draft Environmental Impact Study, which concluded that LRT was the best option for the corridor. After a period of public meetings and public comment, the CCCC recommended on June 6, 2006, that the Metropolitan Council select LRT as the locally preferred alternative for the corridor and apply for preliminary engineering to begin. On June 28, 2006, the Metropolitan Council concurred with the CCCC&#x27;s decision and officially selected LRT as the locally preferred alternative.

Metropolitan Council manages all transit, waterway, and other public resources for the seven-county area surrounding the Twin Cities, and as such, the Central Corridor project will now transition to Metropolitan Council. The work of the Central Corridor Coordinating Committee is now complete.

===Funding===
A 2003 study commissioned by the Central Corridor Coordinating Committee placed the cost at US$840 million. Cost estimates placed the cost of the light rail line in 2003, at about US$957 million, with the increase primarily due to inflation over the following decade. On June 6, 2006, the light rail option was endorsed by the Central Corridor Coordinating Committee. The Metropolitan Council gave final approval to this decision on June 28, 2006.

The existing Blue Line has exceeded ridership predictions, as is the case with many other light rail lines constructed in the U.S. during the last decade. This led to some delays for the Central Corridor project because local transit officials were forced to retool ridership models before submitting projections to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). The Metropolitan Council, which operates Metro Transit, submitted numbers showing that a light rail line would carry 43,000 passengers daily by the year 2030. The FTA agreed that the line would be cost-effective at this level, a key requirement for obtaining federal funding.

In April 2008, Governor Tim Pawlenty initially vetoed $70 million in funding for the Central Corridor project, along with other items, from the state budget. The funding was part of a state-local package of $227 million necessary to get federal transportation funds, and the future of the project was in doubt until May 18, 2008, when a revised bonding bill including the $70 million for the Central Corridor was passed in the Legislature and signed into law by the governor. In August 2009 the Central Corridor project received a Record of Decision from the Federal Transit Administration. The FTA found the project to have fully and accurately completed its environmental documentation with the publication of the Final Environmental Impact statement earlier in the summer, thus clearing the project for final design.

===Construction===

The first construction began in late 2010, including work in downtown St. Paul and near the University of Minnesota campus. By November 2011, construction was about 32% complete, including most heavy construction such as the installation of track segments, a new bridge, partial completion of stations, a rebuilt skyway in St. Paul and the construction of Green Line facilities at St. Paul Union Station.

Due to scope of project, a venture was created by C.S. McCrossan and Ames to complete an area known as The Civil West Project. This area extended from the west side of the 35W abutment, over the Mississippi River, through the UofM campus and ending at Bedford St. From Bedford to Saint Paul, Walsh Construction served as the general contractor.

In July 2011, the Metropolitan Council officially named the Central Corridor as the Green Line. As of August 2013, construction was completed and test trains began running over the line which opened to the public on June 14, 2014.

An interesting component of the Green Line project was the complexities in design layout. Land surveyors worked directly with over twelve subcontractors to complete the work. A particular area required exclusive attention and support, that being outside the University of Minnesota&#x27;s biology department. Between Pleasant and Harvard streets there was 1/8&quot; of tolerance between design and as-builds. Control factors used in the biology labs would be impacted by the electromagnetic radiation emitted from the nearby light rail. The 1/8&quot; tolerance is said to cancel out any EMR that the light rail may produce.

=== Additional stations ===

Some in favor of the line have expressed concern with the number of stations. The neighborhoods along University have demanded that the line have stations every half-mile, from Snelling to Rice Street, which would mean stations at Hamline Avenue, Victoria Street and Western Avenue. In February 2008, the Central Corridor Management Committee passed a resolution to include below-ground infrastructure for the Hamline, Victoria and Western stations &quot;with the understanding that, if the CEI increases or other dollars are made available by mid-summer 2008, the first claim on those dollars would be one of the infill stations.&quot; The Metropolitan Council has included this infrastructure work in their Draft Environmental Impact Statement and has also committed to building one station if any funds become available.

As of 2009, the Federal Transit Administration has increased the Cost Effectiveness Index such that buildout of one station is now feasible. On January 25, 2010, the FTA announced that the three &quot;infill&quot; stations will be built. Upon opening, all five stations between Snelling and Rice Street were built - Hamline Ave, Lexington Pkwy, Victoria St, Dale St, and Western Ave.

==Route==
== Opposition ==

Many businesses along the line were opposed to its development because of reduced access for automobiles. Under the final plans, 87% of on-street parking disappeared along University Avenue between Raymond Avenue and Rice Street. At least one restaurant has cited light rail construction as a reason for closing.

The corridor contains working-class residents and immigrant populations from Laos and Vietnam. Although the Green Line construction is mostly on an existing roadway and no land will be condemned, the disruption to existing transit and pedestrian ways was a concern to some groups. There is also concern that stops for light rail will be placed too far apart and along with reductions in bus service, transportation options for people will be reduced. Others are concerned about gentrification, where rising property values and taxes could force out lower-income residents.

Others have opposed using Washington Avenue for a pedestrian transit mall and have opposed using the Washington Avenue bridge, citing traffic concerns, along with the age of the bridge, when other bridges upriver could be used to cross the Mississippi River: the 10th Avenue Bridge, the new I-35W bridge or the Northern Pacific Bridge Number 9. This last option was preferred by the University of Minnesota, which feared traffic disruption and vibration at some of their research facilities from use of the Washington Avenue route. In late summer 2008, preliminary engineering reports showed that mitigation work could negate the effects of vibrations on university laboratory equipment. The University of Minnesota renewed its objections over vibration concerns along Washington Avenue in late 2009. Negotiations between the Metropolitan Council and the university continued into early 2010. A compromise was reached between the university and the Metropolitan Council and the Washington Avenue bridge was selected for use. As of Summer 2011, work had begun on the Washington Avenue bridge.

In January 2009, Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) raised concerns over the effects of the light-rail trains on their recording studios on Cedar Street in downtown St. Paul. MPR presented the results of an engineering study which they sponsored that conflicted with that performed by the Metropolitan Council. A settlement between MPR and other involved parties will keep the light rail trains on Cedar Street and will also compensate MPR for the addition of sound-proof upgrades to their studios.

== Extension ==

Construction is in progress for an extension to the Green Line. The line is to be extended to Southwest Station in Eden Prairie along the Southwest LRT. The extension will add 16 additional stations and of trackage to the line, extending through St. Louis Park, Hopkins and Minnetonka. The estimated one-way travel time from Southwest Station in Eden Prairie to Target Field Station in Minneapolis is 32 minutes. Delays including neighborhood opposition from the Kenwood neighborhood and additional studies on the environmental effects of the Southwest Corridor have pushed back the planned opening to 2027.

== Transit links ==

The Northstar Line commuter rail line connects downtown Minneapolis with northwestern suburbs, with a station at the north/western terminus of the Blue and Green Lines. The two light rail lines share trackage through downtown.

The eastern terminus of the Green Line is a street level station in front of the Saint Paul Union Depot, considered one of the great architectural achievements in the city and formerly one of the main points of departure for area train riders up until passenger rail service in the United States was restructured in the 1960s and 1970s. The concourse of the Union Depot is planned to become a transfer point for people coming into St. Paul along the proposed Rush Line and Gold Line bus rapid transit lines. As of June 2014, Union Depot is a transit center for Metro Transit, MVTA, Jefferson Lines, Megabus, Greyhound buses, and Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Builder&quot; and &quot;Borealis&quot; trains.

== Bus service ==

Metro Transit Route 16 parallels the Green Line between St. Paul and Fairview Ave Station. Route 50 formerly operated alongside Route 16 during weekdays, but with stops generally spaced about one-half mile apart. It was discontinued when the Green Line entered service. After the Green Line opened, Route 16 service was cut back from 1 AM to 5 AM, frequency was reduced to every 20 minutes and the route was truncated at the University of Minnesota. In 2010, route 16 had an operating budget of $10 million and generated $3.7 million in revenue (a farebox recovery ratio of 37%), while Route 50 had a 2010 budget of $3.5 million and generated $1.3 million in revenue (37% farebox recovery ratio). Route 16 carried about 5 million passengers, with weekday ridership averaging 16,880 and Saturday and Sunday ridership averaging 12,082 and 7,110, respectively. Route 50 carried about 1.5 million riders over the course of the year, with weekday ridership averaging 6,886.

Metro Transit also provides weekday express bus service along Interstate 94 between the St. Paul and Minneapolis downtown areas.

== Vehicles ==
Siemens Industry Incorporated built 47 S70 Light Rail Vehicles for the Green Line, at a per-LRV cost of $3,297,714 and a total contract value of $154,992,558. The LRVs were built in Florin, California, and the first vehicle was delivered on October 10, 2012.

==Safety== 
During testing of the Green line before it opened, there were four accidents recorded. One accident was at Portland Avenue and 5th Street in Downtown Minneapolis. This intersection was already in use by Blue Line and is now being shared by the Blue and Green Lines. 

The first death occurred in August 2014, when Shana Buchanan, former attorney, was struck by a train as she attempted to cross the tracks at Westgate Station. 

On April 30, 2015, Lynne Thomas, the Minnesota Senate&#x27;s office of counsel and research receptionist, was the second pedestrian killed by a Green Line train. 

On December 10, 2015, pedestrian Nurto Abdi Aden was struck and killed as she crossed the Green Line tracks near Hamline Avenue Station. 

On July 15, 2017, Nicholas Westlake, 29, died after a train struck his car near University and Highway 280. Westlake&#x27;s girlfriend and ballroom dance partner Neli Petkova was in the passenger seat at the time of the collision and was subsequently treated for injuries and released from the hospital. In response to the Westlake crash, in which the train operator illegally ran a red light, Minnesota legislators changed a law that had previously prevented light-rail train operators from being charged in fatal collisions. 

On January 28, 2018, a female pedestrian was struck and killed, near the intersection of University Avenue and Pascal Street in St. Paul. 

A sixth fatality, a male runner, was struck and killed on October 8, 2018, around 4:30 p.m., near Hamline Avenue; he died at the hospital. 

A seventh person, a male pedestrian at the Stadium Village station near the University of Minnesota, was run over and killed by a departing train early on April 20, 2019, after he fell between two of its cars. 

On August 30, 2019, the eighth fatality, a female pedestrian, was struck just after 3 p.m. at the Dale Street Station. She was walking north in a crosswalk on University Ave. when she was struck by a westbound train. 

An eastbound train struck a car near the Rice Street station in the afternoon of July 4, 2021, marking the line&#x27;s ninth fatality. Another occupant of the car was hospitalized in critical condition, and the train&#x27;s operator was taken for medical evaluation. 

Around 10:30 a.m. on June 8, 2022, a bicyclist was stuck and killed by a light rail train at the Raymond Avenue Station, the tenth fatality since the line opened. 

The 11th fatality occurred on May 29, 2024, when a bicyclist was struck and killed by a Green Line train near the Minnesota State Capitol and the Rice Street station during the afternoon rush hour around 4:15PM.

The 12th death happened shortly after 3:30 p.m. on July 23rd, 2024, when a pedestrian was struck and killed near the intersection of University Avenue and Syndicate Street.

==Health Impacts==

The Minnesota Metro Green Line had a causal impact of improving people&#x27;s access to health care by providing reliable public transportation. Researchers from the University of Minnesota, Harvard Medical School, and the Urban Institute conducted a Difference in differences study and found that the opening of the light rail line had a causal impact on reducing the rate of missed doctors appointments.

<text>William Timothy Mantlo (born November 9, 1951) is an American comic book writer, primarily at Marvel Comics. He is best known for his work on two licensed toy properties whose adventures occurred in the Marvel Universe: &quot;Micronauts&quot; and &quot;Rom&quot;, as well as co-creating the characters Rocket Raccoon and Cloak and Dagger. An attorney who worked as a public defender, Mantlo was the victim of a hit-and-run accident in 1992 and has been in institutional care ever since.

==Early life==
Bill Mantlo was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the oldest of three sons of William W. and Nancy Mantlo. Growing up as a comics fan, Mantlo attended Manhattan&#x27;s High School of Art &amp; Design. In college at the Cooper Union School of Art, he focused on painting and photography. Following his graduation, Mantlo held various civil service positions and worked as a portrait photographer.

==Career==
===Comics===
A connection with a college friend in 1974 led Mantlo to a job as an assistant to Marvel Comics production manager John Verpoorten. Mantlo&#x27;s first credits were as a colorist, on several comics cover-dated from October 1974 to April 1975. Soon afterward, Mantlo wrote a fill-in script for a Sons of the Tiger story in &quot;Deadly Hands of Kung Fu&quot;, which led to a permanent writing position on that title. While scripting &quot;Deadly Hands&quot;, Mantlo and artist George Pérez created White Tiger, comics&#x27; first superhero of Hispanic descent.

Around this time, Marvel&#x27;s then editor-in-chief Marv Wolfman instituted a policy to avoid the many missed deadlines plaguing the company. The policy was to have fill-in stories at the ready, should a title be in danger of missing its deadline. Mantlo quickly became the &quot;fill-in king&quot;, creating stories under very tight deadlines, many of which did find their way into print. Wolfman explained that Mantlo &quot;was both good and fast and at that point didn&#x27;t have a lot of regular assignments.&quot; By the mid to late 1970s he had written issues of nearly every Marvel title.

Later, he became a regular writer at Marvel, notably for the licensed properties Micronauts and Rom, also known as &quot;Rom: Spaceknight&quot;. Mantlo recalled how one Christmas, he examined some action figures from Mego Corporation&#x27;s Micronauts line, given to his son Adam. He said he began to envision the characters &quot;as small, microscopic even, inhabiting an other-verse apart from, but conjunctive with ours,&quot; and specified that,
Mantlo convinced then-editor-in-chief Jim Shooter to obtain the comics license for these toys; Shooter then hired Mantlo to script their series. Mantlo and artist Michael Golden created the Micronauts&#x27; backstory of history, mythology, personalities, and an alphabet. &quot;Micronauts&quot;, along with &quot;Moon Knight&quot; and &quot;Ka-Zar the Savage&quot;, became one of Marvel&#x27;s first ongoing series to be distributed exclusively to comic book stores beginning with issue #38 (Feb. 1982).

Mantlo&#x27;s first run on &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; featured frequent appearances by the White Tiger. He used the series to wrap up unresolved plot elements from &quot;The Champions&quot; series and wrote a multiple-issue storyline that included the first work by artist Frank Miller on the Daredevil character. Mantlo concluded his first run on the series with a crossover with the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #218 (May 1980). Mantlo, Mark Gruenwald, and Steven Grant co-wrote &quot;Marvel Treasury Edition&quot; #25 (1980) which featured a new story starring Spider-Man vs. the Hulk set at the 1980 Winter Olympics.

While writing &quot;The Champions&quot; he collaborated with artist Bob Hall, who said in 2013, &quot;Bill was a peach — very helpful to me as I got started [in the comics profession] ... I think we were both as enthusiastic as we could get about this particular comic, but more because we were working at Marvel than because of the book itself.&quot;

Mantlo began writing &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; with issue #245 (March 1980). His five-year run on the series was noted for his depiction of the Hulk as highly emotional and humanized, rather than bestial and savage. Among the adversaries he created for the series were the U-Foes and the Soviet Super-Soldiers. Summarizing his early years with the Hulk, Mantlo remarked, &quot;I did retreads of old Hulk stories to try and find a new direction, and just kept doing more and more repetition of what had already happened. Then [editor] Al Milgrom said, ‘Well, don’t accept this. If you want to make changes, make them. Take some risks.’ That’s when we decided to give Hulk Bruce Banner’s intelligence. From that point on I felt as if I had finally had a direction and control over the character. So I guess I took a year and half or maybe two years to get to the point.&quot; Mantlo and artist Ed Hannigan co-created the superhero pair Cloak and Dagger in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #64 (March 1982). Mantlo, Gruenwald, and Grant reunited to co-write &quot;Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions&quot;, the first limited series published by Marvel Comics. Other work by Mantlo includes runs as the regular writer on &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;Alpha Flight&quot;.

===Public defender===
By the mid-1980s, he was enrolled in law school. Though he continued writing for Marvel, his workload began to decrease due to disputes with management. He wrote briefly for DC Comics in 1988, scripting the &quot;Invasion!&quot; miniseries. By this time he had passed the bar exam, and in 1987 began working as a Legal Aid Society public defender in The Bronx.

==Personal life==
Mantlo was married to Karen Mantlo (née Pocock), for some years a letterer in the comics industry. They have a son, Adam, and a daughter, Corinna (born 1980).

On July 17, 1992, Mantlo was struck by a car while rollerblading. The driver of the car fled the scene and was never identified. Mantlo suffered severe head trauma. According to his biographer, cartoonist David Yurkovich, in 2006, &quot;For a while Bill was comatose. Although no longer in a coma, the brain damage he suffered in the accident is irreparable. His activities of daily living are severely curtailed and he resides in a healthcare facility where he receives full-time care.&quot;

In 2007 and again in 2010, the Portland, Oregon-based retailer Floating World Comics held fundraisers for Mantlo, featuring work by cartoonists celebrating Mantlo&#x27;s work on Rom the Space Knight.

When Marvel Studios produced &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, they negotiated a compensation package for the rights to Rocket Raccoon. Mantlo&#x27;s brother credited this arrangement for ensuring he would have care for the rest of his life. They also arranged for Mantlo to have private screenings of that film and its sequel.

==Awards==
&quot;Micronauts&quot; won the 1979 Eagle Award for Favourite New Comic Title.

In 2014, Mantlo received the Bill Finger Award.

<text>Double parking refers to parking parallel to a car already parked at the curb or double parking in attended car parks and garages.

==Parking parallel to a car already parked at the curb==
&quot;Double parking&quot; means standing or parking a vehicle on the roadway side of a vehicle already stopped, standing or parked at the curb. This often prevents some of the vehicles in the first row from departing and always obstructs a traffic lane or bike lane (to the extent of often making the street impassable in one-way single-lane situations). In some areas, people double parking their cars leave the hand brake off, allowing the drivers of the cars next to the curb to push the double parked car a little forward or backward, in order to allow departing from the parking spot. Double parking in this fashion, where illegal, is often punished by ticketing or towing the offending vehicle.

In some urban areas where parking is extremely hard to obtain, courier and delivery services will instruct their drivers that if necessary they may double park anyway, and if ticketed to simply turn it in at the end of their shift. The practice is so common that Washington, D.C. permits companies to establish a monthly billing account for all of their vehicles that receive any parking tickets.

==Double parking in attended car parks and garages==
Attended car parks and garages frequently use double parking to maximize vehicle storage density. A driver who double-parks in an attended car park leaves the vehicle&#x27;s keys with the attendant. If the driver of the blocked car returns first, then the attendant can move the blocking car so that the blocked car can leave. This practice is especially common for valet car parks, in which attendants have the keys to all vehicles.

<doc id="902349" wikidata="Q1336939" url="?curid=902349" title="Alfred D. Chandler Jr.">
<text>Alfred DuPont Chandler Jr. (September 15, 1918 – May 9, 2007) was a professor of business history at Harvard Business School and Johns Hopkins University, who wrote extensively about the scale and the management structures of modern corporations. His works redefined business and economic history of industrialization. He received the Pulitzer Prize for History for &quot;The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business&quot; (1977). He was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He has been called &quot;the doyen of American business historians&quot;.

==Family and life==
Chandler was the great-grandson of Henry Varnum Poor. &quot;Du Pont&quot; was apparently a family name given to his grandfather because his great-grandmother was raised by the Du Pont family, and there are other connections as well.

Chandler graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1936 and Harvard College in 1940. After World War II, he returned to Harvard, finished his M.A. in 1946, and earned his doctorate in 1952 under the direction of Frederick Merk. He taught at M.I.T. and Johns Hopkins University before arriving at Harvard Business School in 1970.

==Publications==
Chandler used the papers of his ancestor Henry Varnum Poor, a leading analyst of the railroad industry, the publisher of the &quot;American Railroad Journal&quot;, and a founder of Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, as a basis for his Ph.D. thesis. Chandler began looking at large-scale enterprises in the early 1950s when he assisted a team of researchers that supported Alfred P. Sloan&#x27;s production of his long delayed book &quot;My Years with General Motors&quot; (1964). 
Chandler&#x27;s book &quot;Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the Industrial Enterprise&quot; (1962) examined the organization of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Standard Oil of New Jersey, General Motors, and Sears, Roebuck and Co. He found that managerial organization developed in response to the corporation&#x27;s business strategy. The book was voted the eleventh most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the Academy of Management.

Chandler, with Stephen Salsbury, his co-author, provided a detailed study of re-organisation of top-level management at Du Pont and General Motors in their biography of its instigator, &quot;Pierre S. Du Pont and the making of the Modern Industrial Corporation&quot; (1971). Chandler and Salsbury explained how the inventory crises of 1920–21 at both companies prompted radical structural change that resulted in the pioneering reformation of both companies that later would be identify them as America&#x27;s first multi-divisional corporations.

This emphasis on the importance of a cadre of managers to organize and run large corporations was expanded into a &quot;managerial revolution&quot; in &quot;The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business&quot; (1977), for which he received a Pulitzer Prize. He pursued that book&#x27;s themes further in &quot;Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism&quot;, (1990) and co-edited an anthology on the same themes, with Franco Amatori and Takashi Hikino, &quot;Big Business and the Wealth of Nations&quot; (1997).

==&quot;The Visible Hand&quot;==

Chandler&#x27;s most highly regarded work was &quot;The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business&quot; (1977). When he wrote it, the American business world was under the assumption that the economy followed a laissez-faire model, meaning the market was controlled by larger economic forces and did not require governmental intervention but that businesses and consumers would operate out of self-interest. Whenever there was a need, Adam Smith believed that an entrepreneur would both identify this need and seek to fulfill it at a price reasonable to the consumer. While some business professionals interpreted Smith&#x27;s logic to understand the economy from a wholistic point of view, many others understood it quite literally as they saw it as a need for several entrepreneurs to create businesses of their own in order to fulfill different needs presented by the market. This ultimately prompted the beginning of the small business era which consisted of a multitude of &quot;mom-and-pop&quot; shops opening up nationwide, each meeting a different need presented by society.

Instead of replacing this economic analysis, Chandler sought to extend it -- arguing that managerial firms evolved to take advantage of productive techniques available after the rail network was in place. As a result of the 2nd Industrial Revolution, technology was causing business processes to increase in efficiency which allowed firms to expand into several functional areas at a time. For example, railroad companies used to primarily fulfill the need of transportation by laying down tracks in specific regions of the country. Once inventions such as the assembly line, steam power, and the telegraph emerged, the supply for railroads finally met its demand and the industry boomed financially as operations were optimized. This led to a surge in both horizontal and vertical integration as railroad companies were granted the ability to expand both on a financial and operational level. Instead of a need that revolved around goods and services from the consumer&#x27;s end, there was a massive need for coordination and systemization from the corporation&#x27;s end now that the complexity of these larger firms began to increase. The &quot;managerial class&quot; in America emerged as firms learned to coordinate the increasingly complex and interdependent system. According to Steven Usselman, this ability to achieve efficiency through coordination explained the high levels of concentration in modern American industry. In a similar fashion to laissez-faire, businesses saw a need and sought to fulfill it, thus creating the modern corporation. While this ended up driving many &quot;mom-and-pop&quot; storefronts to bankruptcy, it ultimately grew the economy of the United States by creating greater wealth and opportunity for millions of Americans today. Chandler has never argued that the management evolution brought the storm of multifunctional corporations to existence (that was technology); however, it did open the floodgates as it optimized the integrations that were necessary in order for America to grow.

==Influence==
Alfred Chandler has drawn many fans over the past century due to his accomplished work that eventually led to the genesis of the topic of business history. Along with the thousands of business historians that would not be employed without his work, there are several critics who seek to extend Chandler&#x27;s arguments, and some who would rather than replace it. 

Much like Chandler himself, historians such as Wallace Williams and Milorad Novicevic are noticing another case of evolution that is taking place in modern business America, (refs required) one that is founded upon a need for systemization that results in globalization. Due to recent information technological advances such as the internet and cloud networking, corporations have the capacity to expand even further into regions and areas unknown, thus concentrating the economy more than before. As a result of Chandler&#x27;s findings, we are in a much better situation now that we possess knowledge and documentation of what used to be the business realm, in order to predict what is yet to come.

In sociology, prior to Chandler&#x27;s research, some sociologists assumed there were no differences between governmental, corporate, and non-profit organizations. Chandler&#x27;s focus on corporations clearly demonstrated that there were differences, and this thesis has influenced organizational sociologists&#x27; work since the late 1970s. It also motivated sociologists to investigate and critique Chandler&#x27;s work more closely, turning up instances in which Chandler assumed American corporations acted for reasons of efficiency, when they actually operated in a context of politics or conflict.

<text>Carl Milles (; 23 June 1875 – 19 September 1955) was a Swedish sculptor. He was married to artist Olga Milles (née Granner) and brother to Ruth Milles and half-brother to the architect Evert Milles. Carl Milles sculpted the Gustaf Vasa statue at the Stockholm Nordic Museum, the Poseidon statue in Gothenburg, the Orpheus group outside the Stockholm Concert Hall, and the Fountain of Faith in Falls Church, Virginia. His home near Stockholm, Millesgården, became his resting place and is now a museum.

== Biography ==
He was born as Carl Wilhelm Emil Andersson, son of lieutenant August Emil Sebastian &quot;Mille&quot; Andersson (1843–1910) and his wife Walborg Alfhild Maria Tisell (1846–1879), at Lagga outside Uppsala in 1875. In 1897 he made what he thought would be a temporary stop in Paris on his way to Chile, where he was due to manage a school of gymnastics. However, he remained in Paris, where he studied art, working in Auguste Rodin&#x27;s studio and slowly gaining recognition as a sculptor. In 1904 he and Olga moved to Munich. 

Two years later they settled in Sweden, buying property on Herserud Cliff on Lidingö, a large island near Stockholm. Millesgården was built there between 1906 and 1908 as the sculptor&#x27;s private residence and workspace. It was turned into a foundation and donated to the Swedish people in 1936.

In 1931, American publisher George Gough Booth brought Milles to Cranbrook Educational Community, in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, to serve as his sculptor in residence. Part of Booth&#x27;s arrangement with his principal artists was that they were expected to create major commissions outside the Cranbrook environment.

In 1938, for the 300th anniversary of the founding of New Sweden, the country commissioned a sculpture by Milles featuring a replica of the &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot;, the ship which originally brought the Swedish colonists to America. The sculpture is located at Fort Christina in Wilmington, Delaware, near the landing site where the colonists arrived in 1638.

=== American works===
In America he is best known for his fountains. Milles&#x27; fountain group &quot;The Wedding of the Waters&quot; in St. Louis symbolizes the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers merging just upstream. Commissioned in 1936 and unveiled in May 1940 to a crowd of about 3000 people, the fountain caused a local uproar because of its playful, irreverent, naked, and nearly cartoonish figures, and because Milles had conceived the group as a wedding party. Local officials insisted that the name be changed to &quot;The Meeting of the Waters&quot;.

Outside Detroit&#x27;s Frank Murphy Hall of Justice is a Carl Milles statue, &quot;The Hand of God&quot;, which was sculpted in honor of Frank Murphy, Detroit Mayor, Michigan Governor, and United States Supreme Court Associate Justice. The statue was placed on a pedestal with the help of sculptor Marshall Fredericks. The statue was commissioned by the United Automobile Workers, and paid for by individual donations from UAW members. The Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research, an annual award for research on entrepreneurship, consists of a replica statuette of &quot;The Hand of God&quot; and a prize of 100,000 euros.
Milles&#x27; sculptures sometimes offended American sensibilities, and he had a &#x27;fig leaf&#x27; maker on retainer.
Photographs of his sculptures, taken for a monograph on Milles, are now held in the Carl Milles Photograph Collection, c. 1938–1939, in the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago.

=== Return to Sweden ===
Milles and his wife returned to Sweden in 1951, and lived in Millesgården every summer until Milles&#x27; death in 1955. They spent winters in Rome, where the American Academy had supplied them with a studio. Milles and his wife, Olga, who died in 1967 in Graz, Austria, are buried in a small stone chapel, designed by Milles, at Millesgården. Because Swedish law requires burial on sacred ground, it took the assistance of the then reigning Gustaf VI Adolf to allow this resting place.

== Milles support for fascism ==
Carl Milles expressed admiration for Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler during the 1920s and 1930s, as well as for Benito Mussolini and Francisco Franco. Carl Milles feared the growing communism and was impressed by the rhetoric of Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco. To his friend Frances Rich, he exclaimed, &quot;I love people who clean up their homes and have Sunday finesse. I don&#x27;t care what they&#x27;re called, but I hate disorder...&quot;. To Olga Milles, who remained in Graz for a while after the annexation (Anschluss) of Austria to the German Reich, Carl enthusiastically sent &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; greetings. However, Milles was hesitant about the methods &quot;to clean up.&quot; In 1938, he wrote to his sister Ruth: &quot;... but no matter how skillful he (Hitler) is in managing Germany, he rattles too much, but maybe it&#x27;s the only way to make others understand...&quot;.

Like many intellectuals in Sweden at that time, Milles was also involved in the appeal to the National Association Sweden-Germany. The association was formed in 1937 to show its support for Germany and as a reaction to the Swedish journalism, which mostly took a negative stance towards the growing Nazi Germany. Milles believed that the Swedish press risked dragging Sweden into the war and argued: &quot;The press&#x27;s ignorant writers, who have fantasized their small brains to disgusting mockery of a great people striving for independence from hunger and communism...&quot;.

Milles had a complex attitude towards Nazi Germany. Many letters are ambiguous, and there are also examples where he opposed German methods. But when he visited Germany, which he did annually throughout the 1930s, the criticism often subsided, and he was swept away by the general pro-Nazi &quot;fighting spirit&quot;.

===South Carolina===

US 501 in South Carolina is a north–south United States highway that traverses ; it is one of main routes to the Grand Strand. US501 begins at US 17 Bus. in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. From Myrtle Beach to Marion, US 501 is a multilane highway, some sections divided, some undivided, mostly with at-grade intersections but having a number of interchanges along the length. The first of these interchanges is with US 17, which is a cloverleaf interchanges that includes railroad crossings at the ramps along the east side. After the bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway it has two more interchanges with local roads. Next there is an unusual hybrid interchange with South Carolina Highway 31, similar to a cloverstack, with elements of a trumpet interchange, in which two flyover ramps from SC 31 to US 501 exit left from SC 31 and wrap around the interchange&#x27;s loop ramps. After this interchange, this limited-access portion comes to an end. US501 passes through the city of Conway where it has a short overlap with U.S. Route 701. South of Aynor it serves as the western terminus of SC 22, which has another unconventional interchange, and various interchanges can also be found along the road before reaching Marion, where US 501 bypasses the town to the east. North of Marion, US 501 meets SC 38, a connector to Interstate 95. From SC 38, US 501 heads to the northeast, meeting US 301 in Latta. US 301 merges with US 501, forming a concurrency through Dillon to the North Carolina border, where it passes South of the Border prior to simultaneously exiting South Carolina and interchanging with Interstate 95 near Hamer in Dillon County.

===North Carolina===

US 501 is a north–south United States highway that traverses the majority of North Carolina in concurrency with US 15, known as &quot;15-501&quot; (&quot;Fifteen Five-o-one&quot;). It enters North Carolina at the South Carolina state line with an intersection of Interstate 95 (I-95) while overlapping US 301, near South of the Border. It goes northwest through Rowland where the overlap with US 301 terminates, and then travels through Raemon to Laurinburg. Once at Laurinburg, it overlaps briefly with I-74/US 74 before connecting with US 15. The majority of the route, to this point, is a two-lane rural road.

Merging with US 15, it becomes what is known by local residents as &quot;15-501&quot; (&quot;Fifteen Five-o-one&quot;), a concurrency that extends for across central North Carolina. After Laurinburg it goes north to Aberdeen, linking briefly with US 1 before continuing to Pinehurst. In Pinehurst, 15-501 goes through a roundabout then continues north through Carthage, then back to US 1. After traveling through Sanford on another brief concurrency with US 1, it exits off the freeway and goes due north to Pittsboro. After Pittsboro, 15-501 goes through Chapel Hill and then into Durham. NCDOT has been trying to remedy traffic problems by making the route a superstreet for better traffic flow. In Durham, 15-501 upgrades to an urban freeway, allowing for quick access to Interstate 85, and from south Durham to north; the freeway ends merging into I-85. At exit 176B on I-85, US 501 splits off towards Roxboro, while US 15 continues with I-85 towards Oxford.

After Durham, US 501 goes north to Roxboro, then into South Boston, Virginia after crossing the state line; the majority of this section is a four-lane expressway.

===Virginia===
====North Carolina to Lynchburg====

US 501 enters Halifax County, Virginia south of Cluster Springs. The U.S. Highway is a two-lane road at the North Carolina state line but immediately expands to a four-lane divided highway named Huell Matthews Highway. US 501 parallels the Mayo River north to the hamlet of Mayo, where the highway meets the western end of SR 96 (Virgilina Road) and crosses the Hyco River. The U.S. Highway passes through Cluster Springs to the community of Riverdale just south of South Boston. US 501 becomes an undivided highway and intersects US 58 and US 360, which together head west as Philpott Road and east as Bill Tuck Highway. US 501 crosses the Dan River into the town of South Boston. Just north of the river, the highway has a grade crossing of Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Clover Spur, which follows the former Danville–Richmond rail line, and splits into a one-way pair: Broad Street northbound and Main Street southbound. Both directions intersect SR 304 (Seymour Drive). When Main Street veers northeast as two-way SR 129, southbound US 501 continues on two-way Wilborn Avenue to the northern end of the one-way pair.

US 501 continues through South Boston on Wilborn Avenue, a five-lane road with center turn lane. The U.S. Highway becomes four-lane divided Halifax Road at Hamilton Boulevard. US 501 receives the northern end of SR 129 (Old Halifax Road) shortly before leaving the town of South Boston. The U.S. Highway enters the town of Halifax and becomes Main Street, a three-lane road with center turn lane, at its grade crossing of Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Durham District. US 501 continues to the county courthouse, where the highway intersects the very short SR 349 (Edmunds Boulevard) and SR 360 (Mountain Road), which runs concurrently with the U.S. Highway through the northern part of the town. The two highways diverge: SR 360 heads northeast as Bethel Road and US 501 heads northwest as two-lane L.P. Bailey Memorial Highway. which crosses Banister Lake, an impoundment of the Banister River, as it leaves the town of Halifax.

US 501 passes through Volens and Acorn on its way to the hamlet of North Halifax, where the highway begins to run concurrently with SR 40 (Stage Coach Road). The highways cross the Roanoke River into the town of Brookneal in Campbell County and pass under Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Altavista District rail line. The highways continue as Lusardi Drive to Lynchburg Avenue in the center of town; SR 40 turns southeast while US 501 turns north west onto the street just north of the highways&#x27; grade crossing of the Durham District rail line. US 501 leaves the town as Brookneal Highway, which parallels the rail line through the communities of Naruna and Gladys on its way to Rustburg, the county seat of Campbell County. The U.S. Highway intersects SR 24 (Colonial Highway) at the southern edge of the village. The highways have a short concurrency before SR 24 continues east as Village Highway and US 501 heads northwest as Campbell Highway. North of Rustburg, US 501 expands to a four-lane divided highway into the independent city of Lynchburg, where the highway meets US 29 and US 460 (Richmond Highway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. US 501 Business and US 460 Business head straight on Campbell Avenue while US 501 joins the freeway heading southwest.

====Lynchburg to Buena Vista====

US 501 runs concurrently with US 29 and US 460 southwest along the northern slope of Candlers Mountain to a full Y interchange where US 501 heads northwest from the freeway. The U.S. Highway has an intersection with SR 128 (Mayflower Drive) and Candlers Mountain Road just east of the highway&#x27;s crossing of Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Danville District. SR 128 joins US 501 on Candlers Mountain Road between the intersection and the highway&#x27;s cloverleaf interchange with US 29 Business (Lynchburg Expressway). US 501 exits onto the expressway while SR 128 continues west to its terminus. US 501 and US 29 Business head southwest along the freeway until the business route exits onto Wards Road to head toward Danville. US 501 curves northwest and has a cloverleaf interchange with US 460 Business (Timberlake Road), crosses Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Blue Ridge District, and has a diamond interchange with Graves Mill Road. The freeway ends at US 221 (Lakeside Drive). US 501 heads north along Old Forest Road as a five-lane road with center turn lane before turning onto a two-lane segment of the Lynchburg Expressway. This segment has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Wiggington Road before ending at US 501 Business (Boonsboro Road).

US 501 heads northwest on two-lane Boonsboro Road, which becomes Lee Jackson Highway when it exits the city of Lynchburg into Bedford County. The U.S. Highway curvaceously crosses Fleming Mountain and descends into the James River Gorge at Coleman Falls. US 501 follows the south bank of the river through Big Island, where the highway meets the northern end of SR 122 (Big Island Highway) and has an interchange with the Blue Ridge Parkway. North of Big Island, the U.S. Highway crosses the river and immediately intersects SR 130 (Elon Road) on the Amherst County side. The two highways have a curvaceous crossing of the spine of the Blue Ridge Mountains before descending to the town of Glasgow at the mouth of the Maury River. The two routes follow the river upstream a short distance before SR 130 (Wert Faulkner Highway) crosses the river into the town. US 501, now named Glasgow Highway, parallels the river and Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Roanoke District rail line north to the city of Buena Vista, which the highway enters as Magnolia Avenue. South of the downtown area, US 501 veers onto Sycamore Street while US 501 Business continues along Magnolia Avenue. At 22nd Street, the U.S. Highway veers onto Beech Avenue, which receives the northern end of US 501 Business (Park Avenue) west of Southern Virginia University. Two blocks to the north, US 501 reaches its northern terminus at US 60 (29th Street).

==Special routes==
==History==
===South Carolina===
Established in 1935 as an extension from North Carolina. US 501 replaced part of US 117 between Myrtle Beach and Socastee, then from there through Conway, Marion, and Latta on what was SC 38. North of Latta, it overlapped with US 301, through Dillon, and into North Carolina.

During the 1940s, because of the need for a more direct route to Myrtle Beach Air Force Base from Conway, 2-lane US 501 was built through the Buist Tract owned by Southern Kraft Company (later part of International Paper), replacing SC 503, its old alignment was renumbered to SC 544. In 1950, US 501 was moved onto new construction between Conway and Aynor, its old alignment renumbered to SC 319. By 1964, US 501 was moved to its current southern bypass from downtown Conway, creating US 501 Bus. By 1990, US 501 was moved to its current eastern bypass from downtown Marion, creating another US 501 Bus.

In 2021, the South Carolina Department of Transportation and Horry County announced plans to spend tens of millions of dollars expanding U.S. 501 into four lanes each way near Myrtle Beach.

===North Carolina===
When US 501 was established in 1927, it was aligned along North Carolina Highway 13 (NC 13) from Durham north through Roxboro to the Virginia state line.

In 1934, it was overlapped with US 15 from Durham south to Laurinburg. From there, it went southeast to Rowland and then to the South Carolina border. This extension south replaced NC 22, NC 71, and NC 241.

In 1953, US 501 was bypassed around Chapel Hill. In 1956 or 1957, US 501 was bypassed west of Sanford. Between 1960 and 1962, US 501 was bypassed around Laurinburg.

====North Carolina Highway 13 (1921-1930)====

North Carolina Highway 13 was an original state highway running from Durham, north through Rougemont and Roxboro ending at SR 18 at the Virginia State Line. The highway&#x27;s routing appeared on the 1916 Highway Map by the North Carolina State Highway Commission for the five year federal aid program. However NC 13 was not officially marked on any state highway maps until 1924; where it was routed from NC 10/NC 75 in Durham north through Rougemont and Timberlake to NC 57 east of Roxboro. NC 13 turned toward the west into Roxboro, before intersecting NC 144 and turning north. The highway had its northern terminus at the Virginia State Line near South Boston. By 1926 the routing of NC 13 was shifted slightly to the west between Timberlake and Roxboro, providing a direct link between the cities. The route was deleted in 1930, with US 501/NC 55 taking over the entirety of the routing.

<text>U.S. Route 601 (US 601) is a north–south United States highway that runs for from U.S. Route 321, near Tarboro, South Carolina, to U.S. Route 52, in Mount Airy, North Carolina. In North Carolina, it is one of the main north-south corridors connecting the cities of Salisbury, Mocksville, and Mount Airy.

==Route description==
===South Carolina===
US 601 begins at US 321 near Tarboro, SC and intersects with such highways as US 278 in Hampton. Beginning in Bamberg US 601 has an overlap with US 301, then intersects US 78. Within the vicinity of Orangeburg, the overlap with US 301 ends at US 21, then it encounters Interstate 26 at Exit 145. In the vicinity of Lugoff, US 601 encounters Interstate 20 at exit 92 near then begins another short overlap with its parent, US 1, which lasts until Camden where that concurrency is replaced by US 521 which last slightly longer than the previous one, ending in Kershaw. The route joins SC 9 three miles west of Pageland, then leaves SC 9 when it arrives in downtown Pageland before eventually crossing the North Carolina border.

===North Carolina===
After crossing the north–South Carolina border, US 601 intersects with such highways as US 74 in Monroe, which it shares a short concurrency with until the interchange with the northern terminus of NC 207. At the northern city limits of Monroe, it interchanges with the Monroe Expressway. Traveling north along what is now known as &quot;Concord Highway&quot; it encounters another intersection with the NC 24/NC 27 overlap in Midland and later an interchange with NC 49 south of Concord. Also in Concord, it joins US 29 which it overlaps until Interstate 85 at Exit 58 and runs along the interstate until it reaches Salisbury, at exit 75, then joins a brief concurrency with US 70. In Mocksville, the road has a short concurrency with US 64 beginning at the western terminus of US 158, and after leaving that overlap encounters Interstate 40 at exit 170. Further north it has an interchange with US 421 in Yadkinville, Interstate 74 at exit 11 near White Plains, and finally terminates at US 52 in Mount Airy.

==History==
Established in 1927 as an original US Highway; the original routing was from US 1, in Cheraw, to US 17/US 76, in Florence.

In 1932, US 601 was extended north into North Carolina, replacing SC 96. In North Carolina US 601 was placed on concurrency with almost all of NC 80, from the South Carolina state line, near McFarlan, to downtown Mount Airy. In 1934, NC 80 was expunged from US 601.

In 1935, most of US 601 was replaced by the arrival of US 52. From Salisbury, North Carolina to Florence, South Carolina, the route was converted to US 52; which marked its departure from South Carolina.

Around 1952, US 601 was extended south from Salisbury. Starting with a concurrency with US 29 to Kannapolis, from there it followed US 29A to downtown Concord. Replacing NC 151, it continues south through Monroe and to the state line. In South Carolina, US 601 returns by replacing SC 151 from the border to Pageland. From there it replaced SC 902 and part of SC 265 to Kershaw. Between Kershaw and Camden, it overlaps with US 521, replacing SC 26 (SC 52 before 1935) from Camden to Orangeburg, then in concurrency with US 301 to Bamberg. Then finally replacing SC 36 to US 321, where it continues and ends with US 321 in Hardeeville.

In 1965, US 601 was realigned on new road bypassing west of downtown Concord, leaving a business loop. In 1970, US 601 was realigned on new road bypassing east of Dobson, leaving a business loop. In 1974, US 601 was extended to Interstate 95 in Hardeeville; however, by 1977, US 601 was truncated to its current southern terminus at US 321, near Tarboro. In 1979, US 601 was rerouted west of Salisbury, with concurrency with US 70; Innis Street was downgraded to secondary status. In the late 1980s, US 601 was rerouted onto Interstate 85, in Salisbury from exit 68 to exit 74; which was extended in the late 1990s, going south to exit 58 in Concord.

In 1999, US 601 was truncated to its current northern terminus at US 52 in Mount Airy.

===South Carolina Highway 26===

South Carolina Highway 26 (SC 26) was an original state highway that was established in 1935 as a renumbering of SC 52 from U.S. Route 21 (US 21; now US 21/US 176) in St. Matthews to US 76 near the Wateree River. In July 1936, it was extended north to the Kershaw County line, east of Fort Jackson. In May 1937, SC 26 was extended again to US 1 in Lugoff. In November of that year, its path from the Eastover area to Lugoff was re-routed on new roadway. Its former path through Eastover was redesignated as SC 26 Alternate (US 26 Alt.) In 1940, its path in Richland County was straightened instead of a zigzag shape. Approximately 1948, its crossing of the Congaree River was shifted slightly to the east. In 1950, it was extended south to replace US 21 and ended at US 301 (now SC 33 in Orangeburg. The next year, SC 26 was decommissioned and redesignated as part of US 601.

====Eastover alternate route====

South Carolina Highway 26 Alternate (SC 26 Alt.) was an alternate route that was established in November 1937 as a renumbering of SC 26 through Eastover. Around 1942, it was decommissioned. It was redesignated as SC 764 east outside of the town and SC 263 north outside of it.

===South Carolina Highway 52===

South Carolina Highway 52 (SC 52) was a state highway that was established around 1926 from SC 31 / SC 45 (now US 601 and SC 6) in St. Matthews, through Wateree and Eastover, to SC 3 (now US 76/US 378) northwest of Eastover. In 1935, it was decommissioned and redesignated as SC 26. Today, most of its path is known as US 601 and SC 764.

===South Carolina Highway 96===

South Carolina Highway 96 (SC 96) was a state highway that was established in 1926 on a path from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) and SC 9 in Cheraw to the North Carolina state line, where the roadway continued as North Carolina Highway 80. In 1933, it was decommissioned, and its entire length became part of the original routing of US 601. Today, most of its path is part of US 52.

<text>Frederick Terrell Jones (born March 11, 1979) is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for the Oregon Ducks and was the winner of the NBA Slam Dunk Contest at the 2004 NBA All-Star Game.

==Early career==
Born in Malvern, Arkansas, Fred Jones moved to Portland, Oregon, in middle school and became the Oregon High School Player of the Year in both his Junior and Senior years for Sam Barlow High School in Gresham, a suburb of Portland. He then went on to play four seasons at the University of Oregon, where, during his senior year, he led the Ducks to the Elite Eight, with the help of Luke Ridnour and Luke Jackson. While widely considered to be an underachiever during his first three years at Oregon, Jones jumped onto the national radar screen as a senior, becoming a candidate for Pac-10 Player of the Year and averaging 18.6 points per game.

== Professional career==

=== NBA ===
Jones was the 14th pick in the 2002 NBA draft by the Indiana Pacers. He was drafted by Isiah Thomas. He played sparingly as a rookie, averaging only 1.2 points per game in 19 appearances while playing behind Reggie Miller. That scoring average increased to nearly 5 points per game in his second year while appearing in 81 games. He more than doubled his averages during the 2004–05 season (to 10.6 ppg), partly due to teammate and small forward Ron Artest being suspended for the season for his involvement in The Malice at The Palace incident. In his first start after the incident, Jones scored a career-high 31 points against the Orlando Magic, establishing himself as one of the team&#x27;s primary scoring weapons.

In 2004, he won the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, beating out two-time champion Jason Richardson, but did not compete in the contest again.

On November 23, 2004, against the Boston Celtics, Jones recorded his first double double, with 16 points and a career-high 10 rebounds.

In the 2006 off-season, the Toronto Raptors signed Jones. On February 22, 2007, the Raptors traded Jones to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for guard Juan Dixon.

Jones, along with Zach Randolph and Dan Dickau, was traded to the New York Knicks on June 28, 2007, for Channing Frye and Steve Francis. The trade reunited Jones with New York Knicks head coach Isiah Thomas, the man who drafted him. The Knicks did not re-sign him after the year.

On December 28, 2008, Jones signed with the Los Angeles Clippers as a free agent. He was waived on January 5, 2009, however three days later he was again signed by the Clippers to a 10-day contract. On January 28, 2009, Jones received news that the Clippers would re-sign him for the rest of the season, which they did the following day.

Jones&#x27; final NBA game was on April 15, 2009, in an 85–126 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder where he recorded eight points and five assists.

=== Italy ===
In August 2009 Jones signed with Italian team Pallacanestro Biella.

===China===
On November 3, 2010, it was announced that Fred Jones had signed a contract to play for the Guangdong Southern Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association. He was waived in January 2011.

==Coaching career==
Jones returned to Oregon to complete his degree and was an undergraduate assistant coach for the Ducks in 2015–16.

<text>U.S. Route 701 (US 701) is an auxiliary route of US 1 in the U.S. states of South Carolina and North Carolina. The U.S. Highway runs from US 17 and US 17 Alternate in Georgetown, South Carolina north to US 301, North Carolina Highway 96 (NC 96), and Interstate 95 (I-95) near Four Oaks, North Carolina. US 701 serves the Pee Dee region of South Carolina and the southern and central portions of Eastern North Carolina. The highway connects Georgetown and Conway in South Carolina with the North Carolina cities of Whiteville, Elizabethtown, Clinton, and a short distance north of its terminus, Smithfield. US 701 has four business routes in North Carolina, including those through Tabor City, Whiteville, Clarkton, and Clinton.

==Route description==
US 701 has a length of in South Carolina and spans in North Carolina. The U.S. Highway is a part of the National Highway System for one short stretches during its concurrency with NC 24 in Clinton.

===South Carolina===
US 701 begins at an intersection with US 17 and US 17 Alternate, which has its northern terminus, in the city of Georgetown. US 17 follows Fraser Street south and Church Street east from the intersection; US 17 Alternate follows Exchange Street west toward Highmarket Street, on which US 521 also runs and has its southern terminus at US 17 one block to the south. US 701 heads north as a four-lane road with center turn lane along Fraser Street. Shortly after leaving the city, the highway meets the southern end of SC 51 (Browns Ferry Road) and reduces to two lanes. US 701 passes the entrances to several former plantations, including Mansfield Plantation, before crossing the Black River at the hamlet of Campfield. The highway passes along the eastern edge of the Carvers Bay Preserve, which protects the namesake swamp area and Carolina Bay. US 701 passes through Plantersville and meets the eastern end of SC 261 (Pleasant Hill Drive) at Yauhannah before crossing the Georgetown–Horry county line at the Pee Dee River.

US 701 passes by the villages of Bucksport, Bucksville—the site of Hebron Church and Buck&#x27;s Upper Mill Farm— and Toddville as the highway roughly parallels the Waccamaw River north to Conway. On entering the city limits, the U.S. Highway follows 4th Avenue and expands to a four-lane road with center turn lane. US 701 meets US 501 (Church Street), US 378 (Wright Boulevard), and SC 905 (4th Avenue) at a triangular junction southwest of downtown. US 701 has ramps to and from southbound US 501 just before passing under the highway; southbound US 701 uses the exit ramp from US 501 while northbound US 701 continues to its intersection with US 378. SC 905 begins and heads into the Conway Downtown Historic District while US 701 makes a sharp turn west to join US 378 for a short concurrency to the latter highway&#x27;s junction with US 501, where northbound US 701 joins the southbound direction and US 501 on Church Street.

US 701 and US 501 head north on Church Street, a four-lane road with center turn lane, to 16th Avenue, a four-lane street onto which US 701 turns east and runs concurrently with US 501 Business. The concurrency ends at Main Street, where the business route turns south onto Main Street toward downtown and US 701 turns north onto the street, which expands from two to four lanes north of the intersection, to head out of the city. The U.S. Highway parallels the Waccamaw Coast Line Railroad north through the village of Homewood, where the highway meets the eastern end of SC 319 and reduces to two lanes, then gradually splits away from the railroad on its way to a partial cloverleaf interchange with SC 22 (Veterans Highway). At its intersection with SC 410 (Green Sea Road), US 701 veers northeast, has an oblique grade crossing of the railroad, and parallels the rail line to the city of Loris. The U.S. Highway passes through Loris as Broad Street, which intersects SC 9 Business (Main Street). US 701 leaves Loris and parallels the railroad north through a partial cloverleaf interchange with SC 9 to just south of the South Carolina–North Carolina state line.

===North Carolina===
Just south of the northwest–southeast state line, US 701 veers northeast to bypass Tabor City while US 701 Business follows Hickman Road parallel to the railroad toward the center of the town in Columbus County immediately to the north of the state line. The bypass intersects NC 904 (Pireway Road) before meeting the north end of the business route and NC 410 (5th Avenue) on the eastern edge of town. US 701 has a short concurrency with NC 410 before that highway splits north as Joe Brown Highway. The U.S. Highway heads northeast as James B. White Highway through the hamlet of Sydney before reaching the south end of the city of Whiteville. There, US 701 Business splits to the east as Madison Street while the mainline continues as J.K. Powell Boulevard. Just north of the business route split, US 701 meets NC 130 (Love Mill Road) and runs concurrently with the highway along a two-lane road with center turn lane. The highways cross Soules Swamp and intersects the Carolina Southern Railroad at grade, then pass through Whiteville&#x27;s main street grid. West of the city center, US 701 and NC 130 intersect US 74 Business and US 76 Business (Washington Street), which NC 130 joins heading west toward Chadbourn. North of downtown, US 701 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 74 and US 76 (Andrew Jackson Highway), a freeway that will carry I-74 in the future.

North of Whiteville, two-lane US 701 collects the northern end of US 701 Business and continues the business route&#x27;s name of James B. White Highway. The highway veers northeast as its junction with NC 131 (Bladenboro Road) at Western Prong. US 701 Business splits to the northeast just before both highways enter Bladen County. US 701 follows W.R. Latham Street through the town of Clarkton, where the highway intersects NC 211 (Green Street) and CSX&#x27;s Wilmington Subdivision. North of town, US 701 collects the northern end of its business route, College Street, crosses Brown Marsh Swamp, and passes to the west of the historic Brown Marsh Presbyterian Church. The highway continues north to Elizabethtown, on the southern edge of which US 701 intersects and becomes concurrent with NC 242 and has a junction with NC 87, which bypasses the town to the south. The U.S. Highway passes through town as Poplar Street, which intersects NC 87 Business in the center of town; there, NC 41 joins US 701 and NC 242 as they exit the town on a four-lane divided highway that crosses the Cape Fear River. North–south NC 242 splits from US 701 and NC 41 at the same three-way intersection east–west NC 53 joins the highways to pass through Bladen Lakes State Forest, which is named for several Carolina Bays known collectively as the Bladen Lake Group. US 701, NC 41, and NC 53 head east as a two-lane road to the town of White Lake, which surrounds the namesake lake. The two state highways separate from the U.S. Highway at separate intersections in the town.

US 701 heads north and intersects NC 210 before crossing the South River into Sampson County. The highway&#x27;s name becomes Garland Highway with local variation through the town of Garland, where it follows Ingold Street and intersects NC 411 (2nd Street). US 701 crosses Great Coharie Creek, passes along the edge of the unincorporated community of Ingold, and through the hamlet of Butlers Crossroads. On the southern edge of Clinton, US 701 meets US 421 at a partial cloverleaf interchange; US 701 Business heads straight on Southeast Boulevard while the U.S. Highways head northwest together on the four-lane Faircloth Freeway. The freeway has a three-ramp diamond interchange with Tram Road—the missing ramp is from Tram Road to northbound US 701—just east of a partial interchange with NC 24 where the state highway joins the freeway. Access from northbound US 701 and US 421 to eastbound NC 24 and from westbound NC 24 to southbound US 701 and US 421 is provided via Tram Road. NC 24 splits from the U.S. Highways at the diamond interchange with Sunset Avenue, which the state highway follows west out of the city. US 421 splits from US 701 from a partial interchange where US 421 exits onto Northwest Boulevard to head toward Dunn. Access from southbound US 701 to northbound US 421 and from southbound US 421 to northbound US 701 via North Boulevard, which US 701 meets at the next diamond interchange. The freeway ends where US 701 meets the northern end of US 701 Business and takes over two-lane Hobbton Highway.

US 701 continues through the villages of Keener and Hobbton and meets I-40 at a partial cloverleaf interchange between Monks Crossroads and the town of Newton Grove. In the center of town, the U.S. Highway meets US 13, NC 50, and NC 55 at a six-legged roundabout known as Weeks Circle. US 701 follows Clinton Street south of the circle and Main Street to the north. US 13 uses Fayetteville Street on the southwest leg of the roundabout and Goldsboro Highway to the northeast. NC 50 and NC 55 together use Raleigh Street on the northwest branch of the circle and Mount Olive Drive on the southeast leg. Just after leaving the town limits, US 701 enters Johnston County. The highway passes to the west of the Bentonville Battlefield and through the hamlets of Overshot and Strickland Crossroads before reaching its northern terminus on the eastern edge of Four Oaks. US 701 has a four-way intersection with NC 96, which receives the northbound I-95 exit ramp, and Devils Racetrack Road, which leads to the northbound entrance ramp. US 701 and NC 96 cross over I-95 together at Exit 90 and US 701 has its terminus at their intersection with US 301. NC 96 continues north with US 301 toward Smithfield and US 301 heads southwest on its own toward the center of Four Oaks, providing access to the southbound I-95 interchange ramps just west of US 701.

==History==
Established in 1932, US 701 began in Charleston, at the intersection with US 17 (King Street) then proceeded east over the John P. Grace Memorial Bridge into Mount Pleasant. Continuing north, it went through Georgetown, Conway before entering North Carolina. Its routing in South Carolina was in complete concurrency with SC 40, which was removed in 1933. In North Carolina, also in a complete concurrency with NC 23, it traversed through Tabor City, Whiteville, Elizabethtown, Clinton, Newton Grove and ending south of Smithfield.

In 1935, US 17 was rerouted to overlap with US 701 between Charleston and Georgetown. Between Clinton and Newton Grove, US 701 was straightened, leaving behind various secondary roads in the area. By 1948, US 701 was placed on a new routing along Southeast and Northeast Boulevards, leaving behind US 701A. In 1950, US 701 was rerouted from Conway to Tabor City, leaving behind today&#x27;s SC 410. In 1956, US 701 was placed on new bypass west of Whiteville, its old route eventually became US 701 Bus. In 1957, US 701 was placed on a new bypass east of Tabor City, leaving behind what became US 701 Bus; also same year a new bypass was constructed west of Clarkton, its old route also becoming US 701 Bus.

Around 1965, US 701 was placed on new bypass south of Ingold, its old alignment becoming secondary road. In 1967, US 17/US 701 was bypassed north of Mount Pleasant, leaving behind US 17 Bus/US 701 Bus. In March 1973, US 701 was placed on US 421&#x27;s western bypass of Clinton, leaving behind US 701 Bus. In 1992, US 701&#x27;s southern terminus was truncated in Georgetown, leaving behind a solo US 17 to Charleston.
===North Carolina Highway 23===

NC 23 was an original state highway. In 1922 it was routed from the South Carolina Border to NC 22 in Dublin. In 1924 NC 70 was given the part of NC 23 from Lumberton to the South Carolina Border. In 1925 NC 23 was extended north along NC 21 to Elizabethtown. It then was placed on new routing from Elizabethtown to NC 60 south of Clinton. In 1928 NC 23 was removed from its routing from Elizabethtown to Lumberton. Instead NC 23 replaced NC 21 to Whiteville then was placed on new routing to Tabor City where it met up with South Carolina Highway 40. In 1930 NC 23 was extended through Clinton along NC 60 then went north on new road to Newton Grove. NC 23 then replaced NC 220 through both Smithfield and Selma before the road ended at NC 91 near Zebulon. In 1932 US 701 was assigned the routing from the South Carolina State Line to US 301 near Smithfield. In 1933 NC 23 was extended through Zebulon to Louisburg. In 1934 NC 23 was dropped from the routing that US 701 was also along. The rest was renumbered NC 39.
===South Carolina Highway 40===
South Carolina Highway 40 (SC 40) was an original South Carolina highway that began in Mount Pleasant and traversed north through McClellanville, Georgetown, Conway, and Green Sea before heading into North Carolina at Tabor City. By 1926, a ferry was put in service connecting Mount Pleasant to Charleston, near the Custom House. In 1929, SC 40 was placed on the John P. Grace Memorial Bridge into Charleston, ending at SC 2 (King Street). In 1932, US 701 was assigned to the entirety of SC 40; which was decommissioned a year later.
==Major intersections==


















==Special routes==
Six special routes currently exist for US 701. There are business loops of US 701 serving the North Carolina municipalities of Tabor City, Whiteville, Clarkton, and Clinton. In South Carolina, a short truck route exists north of the city of Conway. There is also another truck route in the southeastern part of Conway and points east of the city. An alternate route once existed in Clinton, North Carolina and a business loop once served Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.

<doc id="902387" wikidata="Q3030694" url="?curid=902387" title="Tailgating">
<text>Tailgating is the action of a driver driving behind another vehicle while not leaving sufficient distance to stop without causing a collision if the vehicle in front stops suddenly.

The safe distance for following another vehicle varies depending on various factors including vehicle speed, weather, visibility and other road conditions. Some jurisdictions may require a minimal gap of a specified distance or time interval. When following heavy vehicles or in less than ideal conditions (e.g. low light or rain), a longer distance is recommended, due to increased reaction times and stopping distances or because fatigue is most prevalent in long distance lorry driving.

==Causes==
There can be several reasons for tailgating.

===Preventing cut ins===
Tailgating can occur when a vehicle attempts to prevent another vehicle on the right or left from cutting in front of them. The tailgating (or preventing) vehicle will drive as close as possible to another leading vehicle to prevent the side vehicle from cutting in. Like all forms, this practice of tailgating is illegal and attempts to force the side vehicle to slow down and get into the line of traffic behind the tailgating vehicle. This practice may provoke road rage where one vehicle is blocking and another attempts to defy the block.

===Negligence===
Tailgating can occur because of a lack of perceived risk in so doing. Thus, it is done unconsciously or negligently, very often by people who consider themselves safe drivers and generally obey some other rules of the road. Evidence shows that more experienced drivers are more likely to be involved in rear-end collisions, possibly because they overestimate their skill and become complacent about allowing sufficient distance to avoid an accident.

===Coercion===
In its most uncivil form, it can be a case of road rage or intimidation. An example would be where the tailgating driver (the driver in the following vehicle) threatens damage to the leading vehicle and its occupants by driving aggressivelyperhaps also with use of headlights and hornto coerce the leading vehicle&#x27;s driver into getting out of the way. The driver being tailgated might not wish to comply, especially if doing so would involve breaking the law, such as by increasing speed beyond the speed limit or changing lanes without due regard for safety.

===Aerodynamics===
A form of deliberate tailgating known as slipstreaming, &quot;draft-assisted forced stop&quot;, or &quot;draft-assisted forced auto stop&quot; (D-FAS) is a technique used by some hypermilers to achieve greater fuel economy. D-FAS involves turning off the engine and gliding in neutral while tailgating a larger vehicle in order to take advantage of the reduced wind resistance in its immediate wake. Note that this practice is extremely dangerous: while tailgating itself is inherently risky, the danger of collision is increased with D-FAS as power for power brakes can be lost after a few applications of the brake pedal and, with older cars, the pressure that causes power steering to function can be lost as well.

===Trailing and columns===
Tailgating may occur when the drivers of two vehicles do not want to be separated, the vehicles are in a procession (e.g. funeral), or the vehicles are maintaining a formation for security purposes (e.g. escorting a dignitary or a dangerous prisoner). Another sphere wherein tailgating has been observed is among drivers who are in a hurry, or other public road activity whose prerequisite is urgency or agitation.

==Hazards of tailgating==
Tailgating can be dangerous to the tailgater, especially if they are driving closely behind a large vehicle (such as a tractor-trailer, or gas tanker). By tailgating, the driver has a shorter distance to stop, decreases the margin of error and blocks the awareness of surroundings.

If the leading vehicle decelerates suddenly (such as when encountering a traffic jam, traffic lights, avoiding pedestrians, etc.), the tailgater has a high risk of causing a rear-end collision, for which in insurance terms, they would always be held responsible. Brake checking is an exception to this, in which case the leading vehicle is generally the one held liable for damages.

In many jurisdictions, a two second gap is recommended between any two successive moving vehicles, characterised in many countries by the slogan, &quot;only a fool breaks the two second rule.&quot;

==Prevention==
Tailgating causes most rear-end crashes in South Australia. Some motorways in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia feature certain road markings which can help resolve this problem. Consisting of an arrangement of chevrons, these remind the driver not to tailgate, and assist in the two second rule. Public goods vehicle license training in Britain states that lorries should increase the 2 second gap to the vehicle in front to 3 seconds when being tailgated to ensure that emergency braking can be a little gentler, to compensate for the tailgating vehicle behind having eaten up its own reaction time to almost nothing.

In Germany, tailgating is punishable with a fine of up to €400. In case of gross negligence, one or more penalty points are given and the driver&#x27;s license may additionally be immediately suspended for up to 3 months.

<doc id="902388" wikidata="Q1902446" url="?curid=902388" title="Plate glass university">
<text>A plate glass university or plateglass university is one of a group of universities in the United Kingdom established or promoted to university status in the 1960s. The original plate glass universities were established following decisions by the University Grants Committee (UGC) in the late 1950s and early 1960s, prior to the Robbins Report in 1963. However, the term has since expanded to encompass the institutions that became universities as a result of Robbins&#x27; recommendations.

==Origin of terminology==
The term &quot;plateglass&quot; was coined by Michael Beloff for a book he wrote about these universities, to reflect their modern architectural design which often contains wide expanses of plate glass in steel or concrete frames. This contrasted with the (largely Victorian) red brick universities and the very much older ancient universities.

Beloff applied the term specifically to the new creations of the 1960s, not including the institutions promoted from university colleges or colleges of advanced technology, or created by division of existing universities &quot;as Durham shed Newcastle&quot;. All of the original plateglass universities were created &quot;de novo&quot; as universities.

== Beloff&#x27;s plateglass universities ==
Beloff listed seven universities in his book. These were the seven universities approved by the UGC prior to the Robbins Report.

*University of East Anglia (1963)
*University of Essex (1964/5)
*University of Kent at Canterbury (now known as the University of Kent) (1965)
*University of Lancaster (now known as Lancaster University) (1964)
*University of Sussex (1961)
*University of Warwick (1965)
*University of York (1963)

===Naming===
Unlike earlier universities in the United Kingdom, which were typically named after the city in which they were located (e.g., the University of Cambridge in Cambridge), several newer universities were named after the counties or wider regions they served. For example, universities founded in Colchester and Brighton were named after the counties of Essex and Sussex, respectively. The university in Canterbury initially adopted the name &quot;University of Kent at Canterbury&quot;, combining the county name (Kent) with the city name, although this was later simplified to the University of Kent. The university on the outskirts of Coventry, Warwickshire was named after the county town of Warwick. The university in Norwich, which is in the county of Norfolk, was instead named for the wider area of East Anglia which also includes Suffolk and Essex. The universities in Lancashire and Yorkshire were located in the county towns of Lancaster and York respectively. There were already universities within those counties (Manchester and Liverpool in Lancashire; Sheffield, Leeds and Hull in Yorkshire).

Since the passage of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 several new universities and university colleges have been created within the same city as a plate-glass university and have been named after the city: Brighton, Canterbury Christ Church, Coventry, Norwich University of the Arts, Writtle and York St John.

===Common references===
Certain aspects of the design of these universities acknowledges the formation of the group; for example, at Sussex the first batches of student residences to be built were named after some of the other new universities, i.e. &quot;Essex House&quot;, &quot;Kent House&quot;, &quot;Lancaster House&quot;, &quot;Norwich House&quot; (for UEA), and &quot;York House&quot;.

==Other universities, sometimes referred to as plate glass universities==

Research at the Department for Education in 2016 categorised universities into four age groups: ancient (pre-1800), red brick (1800–1960), plate glass (1960–1992), and post-1992.

The institutions that gained university status in the 1960–1992 plate glass period are listed below. Almost all of these were promoted to university status, rather than created as universities like the institutions in Beloff&#x27;s original list; ten were previously colleges of advanced technology (CATs).

(Dates refer to the granting of university status, not to founding of the institution.)

*Aston University (1966) – formerly Birmingham CAT
*University of Bath (1966) – formerly Bristol College of Science and Technology
*University of Bradford (1966) – formerly Bradford Institute of Technology
*Brunel University (1966) – formerly Brunel CAT; became a member institution of the University of London in 2024 and now operates as &quot;Brunel University of London&quot; 
*University of Buckingham (1983) – formerly University College at Buckingham (from 1973)
*City University, London (1966) – formerly Northampton CAT; became a college of the University of London and renamed &quot;City, University of London&quot; in 2016
*Heriot-Watt University (1966) – formerly School of Arts of Edinburgh
*Keele University (1962) – formerly North Staffordshire University College
*Loughborough University (1966) – formerly Loughborough CAT
*Newcastle University (1963) – formerly King&#x27;s College, University of Durham
*Open University (1969) – &quot;de novo&quot; creation as a distance-learning university
*University of Salford (1967) – formerly Salford CAT
*University of Dundee (1969) – formerly Queen&#x27;s College Dundee, part of the University of St Andrews
*University of Stirling (1967) – &quot;de novo&quot; creation as a university
*University of Strathclyde (1964) – formerly the Royal College of Science and Technology
*University of Surrey (1966) – formerly Battersea CAT
*New University of Ulster (1968) – &quot;de novo&quot; creation as a university; merged with the older Magee University College in 1969; merged with Ulster Polytechnic and renamed &quot;University of Ulster&quot; in 1984

The DfE study classified higher education institutions (HEIs) according to &quot;the length of time an HEI had been established&quot;, without a detailed definition of how this was determined Keele might thus be considered &quot;Red Brick&quot; under this classification as it entered the university sector (as a university college) prior to 1960), as might Newcastle and Dundee, which were colleges of the universities of Durham and St Andrews respectively. The definition might also include institutions and colleges of the University of London that became part of the university sector in that period but did not receive university status:
*Cranfield Institute of Technology (1969) – formerly the College of Aeronautics; granted university status and renamed &quot;Cranfield University&quot; in 1993
* London Business School (1965) – established 1964, joined University of London 1965
* Royal College of Art (1967)

The Scottish universities from the 1960s (Heriot-Watt, Stirling, Strathclyde, Dundee and the Open University in Scotland) are also known as &quot;chartered universities&quot; as they were established, and are governed, by their royal charters.

==Popular culture==
Malcolm Bradbury&#x27;s 1975 campus novel &quot;The History Man&quot; is set in the fictional plate glass University of Watermouth. External scenes of the television series were filmed at Lancaster University.

<text>U.S. Route 301 (US 301) is a spur of U.S. Route 1 running through the South Atlantic states. It runs from Biddles Corner, Delaware, at Delaware Route 1 to Sarasota, Florida, at U.S. Route 41. It passes through the states of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. It goes through the cities of Middletown, Delaware; Annapolis, Maryland; Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia; Rocky Mount, Wilson, and Fayetteville, North Carolina; Florence, South Carolina; Statesboro and Jesup, Georgia; and Jacksonville, Ocala, Zephyrhills, and Sarasota, Florida.

US 301 is paralleled by Interstate 95 for much of its routing through The Carolinas and Virginia including short concurrencies in Santee, South Carolina, and Lumberton, North Carolina. It has a number of other concurrencies along its route.

As originally commissioned, US 301&#x27;s northern terminus was at US 1 in Petersburg, Virginia. The original southern end was at a junction with then-US 17 between Florence and Marion, South Carolina.

===Florida===

Concurrencies in Florida include US 1/23 between Folkston (Georgia) and Callahan, US 441 between Sparr and Belleview, US 27 between Ocala and Belleview, US 98 between Moss Town and Clinton Heights (near Dade City), and US 41 between Palmetto and South Bradenton. The road is also shared by the DeSoto Trail south of Bushnell.

===Georgia===
In Georgia, US 301 is signed concurrently with various state routes. It uses SR 4/SR 15 from Florida to Folkston, SR 23 from Folkston to Glennville, and SR 73 from Glennville to South Carolina. Large portions of US 301 in Georgia are concurrent with US 25.

US 301 enters Georgia from Florida concurrent with US 1/US 23, also designated as SR 4/SR 15, on a bridge over the St. Marys River. In Folkston, SR 23/SR 121 join. US 1/US 23/SR 4/SR 15/SR 121 split to the northwest at a junction north of Folkston, leaving only US 301 and SR 23 to head north across US 82/SR 520 at Nahunta to Jesup.

At Jesup, US 301 crosses US 341/SR 27, where US 25 turns from US 341 onto US 301, and then merges with US 84/SR 38. The combined routes (US 25/US 84/US 301/SR 23/SR 38) cross the Altamaha River to the junction with SR 57 in Ludowici. There US 84 and SR 38 continue northeast, while US 25/US 301/SR 23 turn northwest with SR 57.

SR 23 and SR 57 split off to the northwest at Glennville. SR 73 begins there, taking US 25 and US 301 north from Glenville across US 280/SR 30 at Claxton and I-16/SR 404 to Statesboro.

US 25 and US 301 meet US 80/SR 26 and SR 67 in Statesboro. SR 67 joins south of the US 80/SR 26 crossing and then turns west with US 80/SR 26, as does US 25; US 25 and SR 67 split from US 80/SR 26 about to the west. US 301 and SR 73 continue north from Statesboro through Sylvania to the Savannah River and the border with South Carolina.

===South Carolina===

US 301 enters South Carolina over the Savannah River southwest of Allendale. Concurrencies include U.S. 321 in and around Ulmer, U.S. 601 between Bamberg and Orangeburg, then I-95/U.S. 15 Santee, at Exit 97 before all three move across Lake Marion. The U.S. 15-301 multiplex leaves I-95 at Exit 102, running in close proximity to I-95, but U.S. 15 breaks away at Summerton. Other concurrencies include U.S. 521 in Manning, U.S. 52 between Effingham and just south of Florence, U.S. 76 eastbound from east of Florence until Pee Dee, and finally joins U.S. 501 in Latta, where they both approach the South of the Border roadside attraction complex at the interchange with I-95 on the North Carolina-South Carolina border.

===North Carolina===

US 301-501 enters North Carolina at the interchange with I-95 where it passes the South of the Border roadside attraction complex, then is closely paralleled by I-95 throughout North Carolina. Concurrencies include US 501 between Latta (South Carolina) and Rowland, I-95 between exit 10 and exit 22 in Lumberton, I-95 BL in Fayetteville, and US 158 between Weldon and Garysburg.

===Virginia===
Entering Virginia just south of the community of Skippers, the route is paralleled by I-95 though much of the Southside region of Virginia, often times serving as the frontage road for I-95, deviating from it only in the city of Emporia, where it takes a more direct route through the center of the city. In the Richmond metro area, it passes through the historic centers of the cities of Petersburg (where it meets its parent route, U.S. 1) and Colonial Heights. Passing east of Chester, the two conjoined routes enter Richmond and pass through the Manchester portion of the city along a major boulevard, crossing the James River along the Robert E. Lee Memorial Bridge over Belle Isle Park, and following Belvidere Street and Chamberlayne Avenue through central Richmond. At the extreme northern border of Richmond, the two routes split again, with U.S. 301 veering to the northeast past the community of Mechanicsville, Virginia and turning back to the north.

Traveling through numerous rural areas and small communities of central Virginia, the route turns northeast along a bypass around Bowling Green and passing close to Fort Walker as it turns to a more east-northeasterly direction, leaving the state in Dahlgren on the Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge across the Potomac River.

===Maryland===

U.S. Route 301 enters Maryland along the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge across the Potomac River from Virginia. A four-lane highway through most of the state, it is known locally as the Crain Highway and it connects several rural communities and small exurbs at the outer edges of the Washington metropolitan area, connecting communities such as La Plata, St. Charles, Waldorf and Upper Marlboro. The route follows a generally northeast-southwest alignment until Bowie, where it leaves the Crain Highway (which continues on as Maryland Route 3) and joins the John Hanson Highway/U.S. Route 50, which also carries the hidden designation of I-595.

The John Hanson Highway is a freeway that travels roughly due east-west and carries both U.S. 50 and U.S. 301 into and through Annapolis, where the name changes to Blue Star Memorial Highway. The freeway continues onto Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore via the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, passing across Kent Island. At the end of the freeway, the two routes split, each following a four-lane divided road through the eastern shore, with U.S. 50 going generally south and U.S. 301 going generally north.

The four lane divided road continues generally northeast through the rural Eastern Shore region before crossing into Delaware and becoming a freeway.

===Delaware===

US 301 in Delaware is a four-lane tolled freeway that enters the state from Maryland and heads northeast past Middletown before coming to its northern terminus at an interchange with Delaware Route 1 in Biddles Corner, south of the Senator William V. Roth Jr. Bridge over the Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal in St. Georges. The new alignment opened in January 2019 and replaces the former routing that ended at U.S. Route 40 in Glasgow.
==History==
US 301 was established in 1932 as a replacement of the piece of US 17-1 north of Wilson and the whole of US 217. Thus US 301 initially ran from US 17 (now US 76) at Pee Dee, South Carolina northeast through Dillon, Lumberton, Fayetteville, Dunn, Smithfield, Wilson, Rocky Mount, and Emporia, ending at US 1 in Petersburg, Virginia. This entire route is now paralleled by Interstate 95. US 301 was at one time alternately referred to as Federal Route No. 301 early in its existence.
In 1935, US 301 was extended southwest to US 15 at Summerton. This extension took it west on US 76 (formerly US 17) to Florence and south on US 52 (also formerly US 17) to Effingham. There it split to the southwest, running along what had been SC 4 via Manning to Summerton. This again runs parallel to Interstate 95.

The next extension was to the north in late 1940, coinciding with the opening of the Potomac River Bridge. US 301 was extended north along US 1 from Petersburg to Richmond, then north on SR 2 to Bowling Green, and northeast on SR 207 to the bridge. In Maryland it continued along the new alignment off the bridge to Newburg, Maryland, and then replaced MD 3 all the way to US 1 in Baltimore, Maryland.
In the late 1940s, US 301 was extended again, south all the way to Tampa, Florida. In South Carolina it ran along US 15 southwest to Santee, South Carolina and replaced SC 4 west to Orangeburg, South Carolina. From Orangeburg, US 301 ran southwest with US 601 to Bamberg, South Carolina, replaced SC 33 to Ulmer, South Carolina, replaced SC 508 to Allendale, South Carolina, and replaced SC 73 to the Georgia state line. In Georgia, US 301 was marked along SR 73 to Glennville, Georgia, SR 23 to Folkston, and SR 4 to the border with Florida, numbers that it still has today. In Florida it ran along SR 15 to Callahan, SR 200 to Ocala, SR 25/SR 500 to Belleview, SR 35 to Dade City, SR 39 to Zephyrhills, and State Road 41 to Tampa, Florida. As with Georgia, these State Road numbers still exist.

The final extension to the south was made in the early 1950s. US 301 was realigned to turn east on U.S. Route 92/SR 600 in northern Tampa and south on SR 43; SR 43 was later extended north to meet SR 41 at Thonotosassa. This was done at the same time as US 541 was eliminated and US 41 was moved onto the former US 541 south of Tampa; US 301 ran along what had been US 41. This extension took US 301 south to Palmetto along SR 43/former US 41, south on SR 45/US 41 over the Manatee River into Bradenton, Florida (replaced 1957 by a new bridge to the east on SR 55), and south on SR 683 to end at SR 45/US 41 in Sarasota.

In 1960, US 301 was extended to its greatest extent, Sarasota to Farnhurst. The part from near Bowie north to Baltimore reverted to MD 3, and US 301 was extended east along US 50 from near Bowie over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge to Queenstown. There it split to the northeast, replacing MD 71 to the Delaware state line. In Delaware, it continued concurrent with DE 71 to Middletown. There it split into a one-way pair on two two-way roads. US 301 northbound turned east at Middletown along DE 299, then running north on US 13 to its end at Farnhurst at I-295 - the Delaware Memorial Bridge approach. Southbound US 301 began at the same place, but only used US 13 to the DE 71 junction near Red Lion. From there it followed DE 71 all the way to Maryland, rejoining northbound at Middletown. In the early 1970s, the northbound alignment was modified, continuing north on Middletown with DE 71 across the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal on the Summit Bridge. After crossing the canal it continued north on DE 896 to Glasgow, where it turned east with US 40 to its merge with US 13 at State Road. In the mid-1980s, both directions were moved to run east from Mount Pleasant to US 13. Then in 1992, AASHTO approved relocating both directions to the path northbound had followed, joining US 40 at Glasgow. Signage currently now indicates that US 301 ends there, but on November 14, 2006, the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) announced that a new four-lane US 301 bypass will be built. The bypass, which had been proposed since the 1950s, would go west of Middletown, alleviating traffic conditions in state&#x27;s fourth most populous town, and then travel in a northeasterly direction, intersecting the current DE 896 near Boyds Corner and then terminate at DE 1 near the highway&#x27;s Biddles Corner toll plaza. A spur route, also following the old 1960s highway route, will connect US 301 with the four-lane Summit Bridge just south of Glasgow. When built, the road, like Delaware Route 1 and I-95, will charge a toll to cover the costs of building the new bypass, which is heavily used by trucks between Philadelphia and the Washington, D.C. metro areas. This bypass opened to traffic on January 10, 2019.

According to one source, US 301 had been known as &quot;Tobacco Trail&quot; prior to its renaming in 1960 to &quot;The Miss Universe Highway&quot;.
Prior to 2019, US 301 in Delaware started at the intersection of U.S. 40 and Delaware Route 896 in Glasgow. The highway was cosigned with DE 896, picking up Delaware Route 71 only three miles south of U.S. 40. Running parallel to US 13 and Delaware Route 1, the highway crossed the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal on the four-lane Summit Bridge. At Mount Pleasant, DE 896 headed east to intersect U.S. 13 at Boyd&#x27;s Corner, while DE 71 continued to be cosigned with U.S. 301 until the road reached Middletown. U.S. 301 continued alone until it picked up two other roads, Delaware Route 15 and Delaware Route 299, which followed the highway to near the Maryland state line. On November 14, 2006, DelDOT announced that a new four-lane bypass around Middletown will reroute US 301 west of Middletown, with the road directly connecting to DE 1 in Biddles Corner. This bypass opened to traffic on January 10, 2019.

===U.S. Route 217===
U.S. Route 217 (US 217) was an original US highway, established in 1926. It traversed from US 17, in Pee Dee, South Carolina, to US 17-1/NC 40, south of Wilson, North Carolina. Its routing connected the cities of Dillon, Lumberton, Fayetteville, Dunn, and Smithfield. In 1932, the entire route was renumbered as part of US 301.

<text>Río Bec is a pre-Columbian Maya archaeological site located in what is now southern portion of the Mexican state of Campeche. The name also refers to an architectural style (Río Bec Style) that first appeared at Río Bec and subsequently spread to other nearby sites. The Río Bec Style is closely related to the Chenes architectural style found northwest of the Río Bec region.

== The archaeological site ==
The Río Bec site was first mentioned by Austrian explorer Teoberto Maler at the end of the 19th century, though he never visited the site. The French explorer Maurice de Perigny was the first European to visit and report on the Río Bec. The site is now being excavated and restored by a group of French archaeologists from the CNRS headed by Dominique Michelet. They have located several architectural groups and their surveys and maps of several square kilometers give us a better understanding of the ancient settlement. Excavation of the principal building at Río Bec A, a building with three towers and several rooms was underway in 2006.

== The Rio Bec architectural style ==
Río Bec temple pyramids are located in the central Maya lowlands. The temple-pyramids are characterized by a unique architectural style that began to appear during the seventh century A.D. and continued into the early twelfth century A.D. The temple-pyramids consist of a range-type building with typically two nonfunctional solid masonry towers on both ends of the range-type building.
The twin-towers narrow with ascension in order to give an illusion of greater height. The twin-towers appear to have stairs along their faces leading to the temple that rests atop them. However, the steps are only a design motif that creates the illusion of functional stairs. Even if the steps were functional, the towers rise at steep vertical angles that would make ascending them difficult.

The temples, which are located on the platform at the top of the Río Bec towers are inoperative as well. The temples are solid masses with no interior rooms. Pseudo-doorways, which have been built into niches in the fronts of the temples, give the appearance of a functional door.

Despite their nonfunctional components, the Río Bec towers hold the typical decorations of a pyramid and its upper temple and at first glance are taken as functional pyramids. The purpose of the Río Bec temple-pyramids is unknown, but they do resemble the twin-tower complexes of Tikal.

<text>The River Cray is the largest tributary of the River Darent. It is the prime river of outer, south-east Greater London, rising in Priory Gardens, Orpington, where rainwater percolates through the chalk bedrock of the Downs to form a pond where the eroded ground elevation gives way to impermeable clay. Initially it flows true to form northwards, past industrial and residential St Mary Cray, through St Paul&#x27;s Cray (where it once powered a paper mill) and through Foots Cray, where it enters the parkland Foots Cray Meadows, flowing under by Five Arches bridge (built in 1781 as part of their designs by Capability Brown). It then flows by restored Loring Hall (c.1760), home of the Lord Castlereagh who killed himself there in 1822. It continues through North Cray and Bexley. It neighbours a restored Gothic (architecture) cold plunge bath house, built around 1766 as part of Vale Mascal Estate. It is then joined by the River Shuttle (a small brook) and then continues through the parkland of Hall Place, which was built for John Champneys in 1540. The Cray turns eastward through Crayford and Barnes Cray to join the Darent in Dartford Creek. The Creek is a well-watered partly tidal inlet (of the Tideway) between Crayford Marshes and Dartford Marshes by a slight projection of land, Crayford Ness. The villages through which the Cray flows are collectively known as &quot;The Crays&quot;.

== Overview ==
Clean-ups on the (non-tidal) river and campaigns for responsible angling are organised by the Cray Anglers Conservation Group. The tidal section is effectively monitored and maintained by The Dartford and Crayford Restoration Trust, who also organise Lengthsman duties for the banks. There is a signposted public footpath called the Cray Riverway alongside the river, beginning at Foots Cray Meadows and continuing for 10 miles (about 16 km) northwards to the Thames. It is part of the London LOOP. The river is a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation.

==Settlements==
From south to north, settlements and features along the river include:
*Orpington
*St Mary Cray
*St Paul&#x27;s Cray
*A20 road
*Foots Cray
*Bexley village
*A2 road
*Crayford

==Watermills==
The River Cray powered fourteen watermills. From source to mouth they were:

===Orpington Mill===

A Domesday site, Orpington Mill stood almost at the source of the River Cray. The mill building dated from the 18th century and was of traditional construction, with a timber frame clad with weatherboards under a peg tile roof. The mill was powered by an by cast iron waterwheel carried on a cast iron axle which had replaced an earlier wooden one. Much of the machinery was of cast iron, including the wallower, great spur wheel and crown wheel. The upright shaft was of wood. The mill drove three pairs of millstones. Miller John Colgate had introduced steam power by the 1870s, and the tall chimney for the steam engine was known locally as &quot;Colgate&#x27;s Folly&quot;, as it did not function as well as intended. The mill was used as a store in its final years before its demolition in 1934 or 1935.

===Snelling&#x27;s Mill, St Mary Cray===

A weir near the Temple URC Church marked the site of a Domesday mill. The mill was demolished in 1872 and the area landscaped as part of the grounds of a public park. William Joynson bought the mill for £8,000 to enable the creation of the park.

The by cast iron waterwheel survived. It was used to drive a beam pump which supplied water to fountains and conservatories at &quot;The Rookery&quot;. The wheel was intact until 1962, when the shed it was in was stripped of ivy and exposed. The wheel was then vandalised and had been cleared away by March 1964.

===Upper Paper Mill, St Mary Cray===

This mill stood opposite the Black Boy public house; it had an undershot waterwheel. Nicholas Townsend was mentioned in insurance records in 1757, and William Sims in 1771. In 1784 William Townsend was first mentioned as a paper maker in St Mary Cray. In 1786 Samuel Lay of Sittingbourne was the paper maker; he was described as a master papermaker in 1801. Martha Lay ordered two moulds in 1806. Martha Lay was running the mill in 1816; paper from this mill bore the watermark &quot;Martha Lay 1804&quot;. The mill ceased working in 1834.

===Joynson&#x27;s Mill, St Mary Cray===

This was a corn mill which stood near St Mary Cray church. It was replaced by a paper mill, then a paper factory and in recent years by a warehouse complex.

In 1787 this mill was being run by Henry Brightly. John Hall was the owner in 1816. Charles Cowan was working at the mill in 1819, when the mill had two vats and was producing an estimated of paper a week. William Joynson took over in 1834. He had previously been at a paper mill in Snodland. Paper produced here bore the watermarks &quot;&quot;Joynson Superfine&quot; or &quot;WJ&amp;S&quot; over &quot;St Mary Cray Kent&quot;&quot;. In 1839, Joynson was granted a patent for watermarking paper produced by machine. The waterwheel was of cast iron construction and may have been overshot, as the head was some to . The mill was expanded in 1853, when a second machine was installed, enabling the steam driven mills to produce 25 to 30 tons of paper a week. William Joynson died in 1874 and the mills were left in trust to his two grandsons. One of them, William, drowned in 1875 leaving Edmund Hamborough Joynson as sole heir. Cowan mentions that the mill was producing an estimated of paper a week in 1878. Some 700 people were employed at the mill in 1881 and E. H. Joynson took over the mill in September 1882, expanding it the following year with a new steam engine and machinery. An engraving of the mill in 1891 can be seen here. Joynson produced only high quality writing papers. In the late 1890s, a dryer was sold to Nash&#x27;s and installed in their mill at St Pauls Cray. Edmund Joynson took his son into partnership shortly before World War One. The firm became William Joynson &amp; Son. In 1914, Joynson&#x27;s paper was used in the first £1 and 10/- banknotes issued by the Bank of England. Edmund H Joynson retired in 1930 and the mills were taken over by Messrs Wiggins Teape &amp; Co. who promptly closed the mills in order to rebuild them. 350 people were made redundant, and only 200 were employed in the reopened factory. The paper factory made greaseproof and vegetable parchment paper. The mill reopened in April 1933 as the Vegetable Parchment Mills (Delcroix) Ltd. The production of &quot;vulcanised fibre&quot; began around 1943. In 1963 the mill was the home of the National Paper Museum The mill closed in 1967 and the paper museum collection was transferred to the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester.

===St Paul&#x27;s Cray Mill===

In 1718 this mill had two waterwheels driving machinery for dressing leather in oil, and a third for corn milling. The mill was replaced by a paper mill, powered by a turbine.

===St Paul&#x27;s Cray (Nash&#x27;s) Paper Mill===

This paper mill replaced the earlier corn mill. Papermaking had been established by 1742. A steam engine had been installed by around 1820. It was used in the 1830s as a meeting place for Baptists. In 1845, Mary Ann Nash inherited the profits and rents of the mill until her sons came of age under the terms of her husband&#x27;s will. Mary Ann Nash died on 7 June 1852. Thomas Nash enlarged the mill in 1853. After his death at the age of 21, his brother William was manager under the trustees until he came of age in 1857. William Nash was married twice, and had five children. In 1870 they moved from the Mill House to a new house called Crayfield House. It is recorded that the axle of the waterwheel protruded into the kitchen of the Mill House. William Nash died on 11 September 1879 and the mill was in the hands of trustees again. In 1898 a 250 horsepower (about 190 kW) double-expansion condensing steam engine by Pollitt &amp; Wigzell was installed, along with a second paper machine. Shortly after this a secondhand dryer was purchased from Joynson&#x27;s mill to replace one that had proved unsuitable. By 1954 the site was a factory complex. It had been demolished by 1986.

===Foot&#x27;s Cray Mill===

Foot&#x27;s Cray mill was a paper mill. By the 1870s it was used as a fabric printing works. In 1900 the mill was being used as a factory making photographic film. Its final function was the processing of silk. The paper mill had two cast iron overshot waterwheels in parallel. Each was diameter. One was wide and the other was wide. The mill was demolished in 1929.

===Old Mill, Bexley===

A Domesday site, one of three in Bexley. This was a corn mill. In 1255, the miller, Auxellus, was censured for allowing the escape of a suspected murderer. A millstone was bought for 55s.6d. in 1300. The last building on the site dated from 1779, when the low breast shot waterwheel of by powered four pairs of millstones. It was owned by the Cannon family from 1839 to 1907. Stephen Cannon was the first of the Cannon family, also running mills on the River Darent. The miller in 1872 was Stephen Cannon (son), who concentrated the business at Bexley, the mills on the Darent being sold. A steam engine was installed in 1884, the tall chimney was built by a Mr Hart from Lancashire, who fell from the top whilst doing repairs and lived to tell the tale as his fall was broken by the roof of the engine house. The Cannon family sold Bexley mill in 1907. The mill was used in its latter days for making sacks. A picture of the mill can be seen here. The mill was burnt down on 12 May 1966 and was replaced by the Old Mill PH, a pub with a mill theme. In 2007, the pub/restaurant was converted into residential accommodation in the form of flats. Archaeological work carried out by Wessex Archaeology that took place prior to the redevelopment found that &quot;Aside from the levelling deposits no archaeological deposits or remains were observed&quot; and that &quot;No traces of the medieval / post-medieval mill or of the wing shown on the 1873 Ordnance Survey maps of the area were observed&quot; either.

===Hall Place Mill, Bexley===

A Domesday site, this mill stood behind the mansion of Hall Place. The mill was run by the Cannon family at one time. It was a corn mill until 1882, and was then converted to a silk printing and flagmaking factory. It was demolished by a traction engine in 1925, with some of the main beams being sold to an American millionaire, Mr Brady. He used them in the construction of a mansion. The low breast shot waterwheel was by and powered at least two pairs of millstones.

===Swaisland&#x27;s Printing Works, Crayford===

A print works was established by Charles Swaisland in 1812. Two waterwheel symbols were marked on Greenwood&#x27;s 1821 map. A cast iron and wood low breast shot waterwheel of about by was removed around 1948. It drove wooden drums for fabric washing. A second waterwheel was in existence in 1893.

===Calico Mill===

This mill stood where Watling Street crossed the Cray. In the 18th century it processed calico. It was marked on Greenwood&#x27;s 1821 map as &quot;Calico Mills&quot;.

===Lower (Iron) Mill, Crayford===

This was the site of a plating mill built in the 16th century. It was in existence by 1570. It was still used as a flatting mill in the early 18th century, when it was owned by Lady Shovell. It was known as &quot;Crayford Iron Mill&quot; in 1800. It had a breastshot waterwheel. In 1817, it was replaced by Crayford Flour Mills.

===Crayford Saw Mill===

This was a saw mill powered by a breast shot waterwheel. It partnered Crayford Iron Mill from 1765. The timber for the floor of Buckingham Palace was produced here. The saw mill stood alongside Crayford flour Mill; it was standing in 1854.

===Crayford Flour Mills===

Crayford Flour Mills were built in 1817. They were powered by a cast iron low breast shot waterwheel by and drove five pairs of French Burr millstones. The upright shaft was wooden, with a cast iron wallower. The waterwheel and machinery were scrapped in 1914, when roller milling plant was installed, driven by gas engines.

<text>Victor Witter Turner (28 May 1920 – 18 December 1983) was a British cultural anthropologist best known for his work on symbols, rituals, and rites of passage. His work, along with that of Clifford Geertz and others, is often referred to as symbolic and interpretive anthropology.

==Early life==
Victor Turner was born in Glasgow, Scotland, son of Norman and Violet Turner. His father was an electrical engineer and his mother was a repertory actress, who founded the Scottish National Players. Turner initially studied poetry and classics at University College London.

In 1941, Turner was drafted into World War II and served as a noncombatant until 1944. During his three years of service, he met and married Edith Brocklesby Davis, who was serving during the war as a &quot;land girl&quot;. Their five children include scientist Robert Turner, poet Frederick Turner, and Rory Turner, an anthropology professor at Goucher College.

Turner returned to University College in 1946 with a new focus on anthropology. Turner completed his undergraduate degree with distinction in 1949. He later pursued graduate studies in anthropology at Manchester University. He became a member of the Communist Party, aligning himself with Marxist ideas like conflict, social justice, process-oriented analysis, and comprehensive case studies, which were key elements of Gluckman’s &quot;Manchester School&quot; in British social anthropology.

==Career==
Turner worked in Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) as research officer for the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute. It was through this position that Turner started his lifelong study of the Ndembu people of Zambia. He completed his PhD at University of Manchester in 1955. Like many of the Manchester anthropologists of his time, he also became concerned with conflict. He developed the new concept of social drama in order to account for the symbolism of conflict and crisis resolution among Ndembu villagers.

Turner spent his career exploring rituals. As a professor at the University of Chicago in the late 1950s, Turner began to apply his study of rituals and rites of passage to world religions and the lives of religious heroes. He and his wife converted to Catholicism in 1958.

Turner explored Arnold van Gennep&#x27;s threefold structure of rites of passage and expanding theories on the liminal phase. Van Gennep&#x27;s structure consisted of a pre-liminal phase (separation), a liminal phase (transition), and a post-liminal phase (reincorporation). Turner noted that in liminality, the transitional state between two phases, individuals were &quot;betwixt and between&quot;: they did not belong to the society that they previously were a part of and they were not yet reincorporated into that society. Liminality is a limbo, an ambiguous period characterized by humility, seclusion, tests, sexual ambiguity, and communitas. During liminal phases, established social classifications and cultural norms often break down. Social hierarchies tend to dissolve, and in their place emerges a sense of equality, unity, and solidarity within the group, which Turner described as &quot;communitas.&quot; Turner suggested that societies experience a cyclical movement between stable periods of order and chaotic intervals of disorder. He particularly highlighted events like carnivals and rituals as key examples of liminal experiences.

Turner was also a committed ethnographer and produced work on ritual. He and his wife Edith L. B. Turner co-authored &quot;Image and Pilgrimage in Christian Culture&quot; (1978).

==Death==
Turner died on 18 December 1983 in Charlottesville, Virginia. After his death, his widow Edith Turner embarked on her own career as an anthropologist. She developed upon Victor&#x27;s &quot;anthropology of experience&quot; with a publication on communitas.

==Influence==
Author Chuck Palahniuk was quoted in &quot;The Believer&quot; as saying, &quot;So often what I’m doing is dramatizing the writings of Victor Turner, who wrote a lot about liminal and liminoid events.&quot; Turner&#x27;s work on liminality and performance has strongly influenced developments in the field of Performance Studies, particularly due to his friendship and professional collaboration with Richard Schechner with whom he explored the relationship between ritual and theater.

==Victor Turner Prize==

The Victor Turner Prize in Ethnographic Writing is awarded annually by The Society for Humanistic Anthropology (SHA). Eligible works are &quot;published books in various genres including ethnographic monographs, narratives, essays, biographies, memoirs, poetry, and drama.&quot; Kirin Narayan&#x27;s &quot;Storytellers, Saints and Scoundrels: Folk Narrative in Hindu Religious Teaching&quot; (1989) was the first Victor Turner Prize winner in 1990.

<text>U.S. Route 401 (US 401) is a north–south United States highway, a spur of U.S. Route 1, that travels along the Fall Line from Sumter, South Carolina to Interstate 85 near Wise, North Carolina.

==Route description==
Starting in Sumter, South Carolina, US 401 goes northeast through mostly swamp and farmland, as it connects the cities of Darlington and Bennettsville before crossing the state line into North Carolina. Traversing the state for , it is mostly a two-lane rural road, which is likely to only have local traffic along it due to nearby Interstate 95.

In North Carolina, the highway becomes more utilized, as it connects several mid-size and large cities in the state. In the sandhills region, it connects the cities of Laurinburg, Raeford, and Fayetteville, all three of which have business routes connecting the downtown areas. The road is typically two-lane still, but expands to four-lane (or more) in each city. The road then runs somewhat parallel to nearby Interstate 95 from Fayetteville through Lillington to Fuquay-Varina.

In Wake County, US 401 is center-stage again as a major north–south corridor, connecting bedroom communities to downtown Raleigh. Once it leaves the county, it reverts to a rural road connecting the small cities of Louisburg and Warrenton. US 401 finally ends at Interstate 85, just north of the community of Wise; completing a through the state.

==History==
US 401 was established in 1957 as a renumbering of US 15A, from Sumter to Raleigh, and NC 59, from Raleigh to Norlina; it is the third and current route to bear the name.

In 1967, northbound US 401 was rerouted along South Street west onto McDowell Street, formally using Lenoir Street, in Raleigh. That same year, US 401 was rerouted onto a bypass route northwest of downtown Fayetteville, replacing part of NC 59; its old alignment became US 401 Business. In 1971, US 52/US 401 was placed on a new bypass northwest of Darlington; its old alignment became US 52 Business. In 1984, US 401 was rerouted along the eastern half of the Raleigh Beltline (Tom Bradshaw Freeway and Cliff Benson Beltline); its former alignment through downtown Raleigh was downgraded to secondary roads. In 1991, US 401 was rerouted back through downtown Raleigh after I-440 was established along the entire Raleigh Beltline. In 2001, US 401 was extended north, in concurrency with US 1, to its current northern terminus to I-85, north of Norlina. On July 16, 2015, US 401 was placed onto new four-lane superstreet alignment bypassing east of Rolesville; its former alignment through downtown Rolesville became US 401 Business.

The first US 401 existed between 1926 and 1931, solely in Virginia, it was replaced by US 52. The second US 401 existed between 1932 and 1934, in North Carolina and South Carolina, it was replaced by US 15 and US 15A.

==Future==
Considered an important link between Fayetteville, Lillington and Raleigh, NCDOT has set up the US 401 Corridor Study. The purpose of the study is to identify deficiencies in the existing corridor and develop alternatives for accommodating future growth in traffic volumes (i.e. widen to multi-lanes). The corridor study also includes NC 55 and NC 210. Estimated costs for all road improvements along the corridor is around $193–222.6 million. Property acquisition and construction is unfunded at this time.

<text>The IPW:UK All-England Championship (formerly the FWA All-England Championship) was a professional wrestling championship which was originally contested for in Frontier Wrestling Alliance (FWA) and subsequently in International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom (IPW:UK) after FWA&#x27;s closure. The title was established in 2001 and existed for eight years until it was unified with the IPW:UK Championship in September 2009. The IPW:UK Championship and the All-England Championship were de-unified in 2012 through until the company closing in 2017.

==History==

===FWA===
The genesis of the All-England title had its roots in the weekly FWA TV show on Portsmouth&#x27;s MyTV channel in the summer of 2001. With the main FWA title held by Doug Williams, and Williams in a storyline dispute with the promotion&#x27;s commissioner, Victoria De Montfort, a decision was made to focus on a secondary belt as a TV championship. At the time, the FWA had been using the FWA European Union Championship as a secondary title, and with the company&#x27;s ownership keen on promoting a particularly English flavour to the show, the title was renamed the All-England championship, a nod to the organisation running the Wimbledon tennis championships.

Scottie Rock, the last-recognised EU Champion, had been coming to the ring wearing the belt, which at that point was not recognised on the TV show. This was explained away as being a &quot;gypsy fighting championship&quot; belt by the commentary team. Nevertheless, Rock and Johnny Storm were chosen to compete for the initial championship, won by Storm in Portsmouth in July 2001.

The championship was initially envisaged as being a Brits-only competition. However, Ahmed Chaer, a Turkish-German wrestler from the German Stampede Wrestling promotion, was given the title to cement a short-lived alliance between the two promotions, though he lost it on his first defence a week later, to Paul Travell. Although the belt would then revert to its homegrown roots, the American Chris Hamrick would also later hold the title.

=== IPW:UK ===
Former champion Leroy Kincade, who defeated Hade Vansen on 19 October 2005, was stripped of the title on 19 November 2006 after siding with International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom in an inter-promotional feud with FWA. Kincade first put his title reign in jeopardy on October 7 of that year by competing in an unsanctioned All-England Title defence at an IPW:UK show. Even though FWA had a working relationship with the promotion, and Kincade in fact retained the title, FWA refused to recognise the result of the match as the FWA management team did not agree for IPW:UK to use the All-England Title name and belt on their show. This continued with Kincade repeatedly siding with IPW:UK and scheduling his own title defences before finally being stripped of the FWA All-England Championship.

Kincade continued to defend the belt even though not officially being champion. However the next official champion would be FWA loyalist Iceman who defeated Kincade at an IPW show. Prior to the match, the FWA announced it would sanction the Title match only if Iceman won.

During the Final Frontiers show, IPW:UK wrestler Sam Slam won the title from Iceman. However, this show also saw IPW:UK win the inter-promotional feud and put FWA out of business, leaving the titles status unclear. FWA would also revive itself as XWA but would sever all ties with the All-England Championship. The title would continue to operate in IPW:UK for just under two years, being part of the British National Championship tournament in 2008, until it was unified into the IPW:UK Championship.

On 15 September 2012, Sha Samuels, holder of the IPW:UK Championship, un-unified the IPW:UK World and IPW:UK All-England belts, putting the All-England title back into active duty through until the company&#x27;s closure in September 2017.

== Title history ==

The title was declared vacant and retired on 24 September 2017.

<text>U.S. Route 302 (US 302) is an east–west spur of U.S. Route 2 in northern New England in the United States. It currently runs from Montpelier, Vermont, beginning at US 2, to Portland, Maine, at U.S. Route 1. It passes through the states of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.

==Route description==

===Vermont===

US 302 begins as River Street in the southeastern part of Montpelier, the state capital, at a junction with US 2. It heads southeastward up the valley of the Stevens Branch of the Winooski River, passing through the northeastern corner of the town of Berlin and entering Barre, where it becomes North Main Street. In the center of Barre, US 302 becomes Washington Street at the junction with Vermont Route 14 south, and continues southeastward up the valley of the Jail Branch River. In East Barre, US 302 has an intersection with Vermont Route 110 at a roundabout. US 302 climbs into the hills of eastern Vermont, passing through the rural town of Orange, where it crosses a height of land and crosses the valley of the Waits River, a tributary of the Connecticut River. The highway turns northeastward, passing through a corner of Topsham, crosses another height of land, and enters the valley of the Wells River in the rural town of Groton. The highway turns southeastward again, following the Wells River and passing through the village of South Ryegate, before intersecting Interstate 91 in the northern part of the town of Newbury. US 302 continues east and enters the village of Wells River, where it crosses US 5 and reaches the Connecticut River and the New Hampshire border.

US 302 is named the William Scott Memorial Highway and was part of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway in Vermont.

===New Hampshire===
US 302 enters the state of New Hampshire at a two-lane arch bridge over the Connecticut River beginning in Wells River, Vermont. It follows Central Street on a two-lane alignment, passing through Woodsville until it reaches NH 10 (Dartmouth College Highway), where it turns eastward.

US 302 follows the Ammonoosuc River through a mix of fields and forested land, passing through Bath as Lisbon Road and Lisbon as its Main Street. As it approaches Littleton, the road&#x27;s name changes to Meadow Street and becomes a shopping strip just before crossing the river and interchanging with I-93. After a short stretch, the road meets Main Street (NH18) at a skewed intersection, defaulting onto Main Street and passing through the town&#x27;s downtown.

The route intersects NH 116 and turns southward onto Cottage Street, immediately bridging the Ammonoosuc River once again, and passes through a residential area before turning eastward onto Bethlehem Road. The route passes under Interstate 93 again and passes through woodland, where it crosses I-93 for a third time at a second interchange, where NH 18 and NH 116 also depart to the south. US 302 then travels eastward through largely forested land, passing through Bethlehem and Twin Mountain (where it crosses U.S. Route 3), then turns southward as it passes through Crawford Notch State Park, bearing Crawford Notch Road as its name and paralleling the Saco River.

After turning eastward again, passing through Bartlett and intersecting NH 16, the road becomes White Mountain Highway and turns southward once more, passing Lower Bartlett and entering North Conway. The route follows Eastman Road south of North Conway, which it follows to its end at NH 113 (Main Street) after bridging the Saco River once again. US 302 turns east, passing through more forested land as it crosses the Maine state border, bound for Fryeburg a short stretch east of there.

===Maine===

US 302 is known as the Roosevelt Trail through southern Maine because it was the beginning of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway to Portland, Oregon. It is a two-lane highway for almost all of its length, but there are multi-lane sections within the Portland area, as well as short four-lane sections in and around North Windham in commercial areas. Some of the hilly sections also feature a third passing lane.

The highway enters Maine at Fryeburg, in the Saco River valley as it leaves the White Mountains. The road bridges the Saco near milepost 56 in eastern Fryeburg, Moose Pond near milepost 46 in Bridgton, Long Lake near milepost 31 in Naples, and the Crooked River in Casco near a boyhood home of Nathaniel Hawthorne. The highway passes the north end of Jordan Bay on Sebago Lake in the town of Raymond, and crosses the Pleasant River at milepost 13.4 in Windham. US 302 bridges the Presumpscot River from Westbrook into Portland at Riverton, then (via Forest Avenue) reaches its eastern terminus at I-295/US 1 at the south end of Back Cove via Forest Avenue.

==History==
The eastern end of US 302 was formerly at Longfellow Square in Portland, Maine. The highway follows a 19th-century stagecoach road from Portland through Windham to Bridgton. The portion from Windham to Bridgton was built about 1785. Stagecoach service began in 1803, and the route became a post road for the United States Postal Service in 1814. Transportation over this route was augmented by the Cumberland and Oxford Canal from 1832 to 1932, and by the Bridgton and Saco River Railroad from 1883 to 1941. The highway through Crawford Notch follows the Tenth New Hampshire Turnpike built in 1803 and parallels the Maine Central Railroad Mountain Division built in 1877. The highway eliminated railway passenger travel over the route from Portland by 1958, and railroad freight service through Crawford Notch was discontinued in 1983.

From 1922 until 1935, much of what is now US 302 was a part of the New England road marking system, designated as Route 18, from Portland, Maine, northwest to Littleton, New Hampshire, roughly . From Littleton west to Montpelier in Vermont, US 302 and Route 18 took different paths. NE-18 took a more northerly route, along present-day New Hampshire Route 18 and Vermont Route 18 to St. Johnsbury, Vermont (closely paralleling I-93), then along present-day US 2 up to Montpelier.

Current US 302 runs along a more southerly route using other former sections of New England Interstate Routes. From Littleton, it went along former Route 10 to Woodsville, New Hampshire, then along former Route 25 to Montpelier.

The entire Maine segment of US 302 was formerly designated State Route 18, a route that was established in 1926 until being deleted in 1935 by US 302.

<text>The Frontier Wrestling Alliance (FWA) Tag Team Championship was a professional wrestling championship contested for in the British Frontier Wrestling Alliance promotion. The title was only contestable by male tag teams and in tag team matches. Being a professional wrestling championship, it was not won legitimately; it was instead won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. The title was active between March 2000 and December 2006, just before the company folded in March 2007.

*FWA Tag Team Championship (March 2000 – October 2002)
*FWA British Tag Team Championship (October 2002 – December 2006)

==History==

After the promotion&#x27;s national expansion in 1999, there was some interest in tag team matches including large-teamed elimination tag team matches as well as traditional two-on-two contests. At March 2000&#x27;s Urban Legends a two-round tournament was held to inaugurate the FWA Tag Team Championship with The New Breed (Ashe and Curve) defeating Jorge Castano and Scottie Rock in the finals. The final champions, Stixx &amp; Stone (Stixx and Martin Stone), defended their titles less regularly than previous champions resulting in them being stripped of their titles. Before new champions could be crowned, the FWA lost in an interpromotional rivalry with International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom (IPW:UK) and had to close as a result. FWA&#x27;s spiritual successor, XWA, originally promised to revive the Tag Team Championship but presently the belts remain inactive.

As well as being the first champions, The New Breed were also the first team to win the belt twice while member Ashe would later join The Family, a large faction that defended the title under the Freebird Rule which allowed any two members to defend the belts. The Family won the titles more than any other team with three wins, giving Ashe, who also won the championship twice with The New Breed, a total of five reigns individually. The Family, in their rivalry with Alex Shane and Ulf Herman, had a number of matches where the championship was contested under a variety of hardcore rules.

<text>An airhead is a designated area in a hostile or threatened territory which, when seized and held, allows the air landing of further teams and materiel via an airbridge, and provides the maneuver and preparation space necessary for projected operations. Normally, it is the area seized in the assault phase of an airborne operation. It may also be used as a staging or refueling point for less permanent operations.

Typically, an airhead is established by helicopter-landed or paratrooper forces, and often will take place at an airport (to allow conventional transport to land later on) or at a helicopter or glider-accessible area.

Notable airhead operations include Battle of Crete and Operation Market Garden during World War II, and Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989. Operation Castor was intended to establish an offensive airhead, but quickly degenerated into the Siege of Dien Bien Phu. Another recent example includes the Battle of Hostomel Airport.

<text>The River Shuttle is a small tributary of the River Cray in London, United Kingdom.

The river rises at two or more springs between Avery Hill and Eltham in the Royal Borough of Greenwich at the junction of the permeable Blackheath Beds and the denser Woolwich Beds. It flows east through the parkland of Avery Hill, then crosses into the London Borough of Bexley and continues through Parish Wood Park and Hollyoak Wood Park, Willersley Park, Marlborough Park and Sidcup Golf Course, where it feeds a lake in the grounds of Lamorbey Mansion (c. 1750) a house now within the Rose Bruford College campus. Continuing east, it flows through Bexley Woods and then follows the south side of the major A2 London-to-Dover road and through the grounds of Beths Grammar School until it flows into the River Cray just south of Hall Place.
A walk called the Shuttle Riverway follows the river for its entire length of five miles (about 8 km). This was created following a persistent campaign by Donald Stringer of Brookdale Road. The walk follows the river where possible but also uses woods, parks, alleyways and some linking roads.

A tributary, the Wyncham Stream, flows into the Shuttle in Hollyoak Wood Park. Its route from the Sports Grounds on the A20 to Holly Oak Park, takes it past Dulverton Primary School, under the Dartford to London via Sidcup railway line, the Old Farm Avenue allotments and under Halfway Street.

<text>U.S. Route 310 (US 310) is a spur of historic U.S. Route 10, now Interstate 90. It runs for from Laurel, Montana, to Greybull, Wyoming. It passes through the states of Montana and Wyoming. Near the town of Lovell, Wyoming, US 310 is concurrent with US 14A for approximately .

==Route description==
US 310 starts at a junction with US 14, US 16, and US 20 west of Greybull; Highway 789 continues north along US 310 through the desert. Near the town of Lovell, US 310 passes by Lovell Lakes before turning west through a brief stretch of farmland that extends into Cowley. From Cowley, the highway runs west to Deaver, then due north to Frannie, where it straddles the boundary between Big Horn County and Park County. Just to the north of Frannie, US 310 bends slightly to the west, so that the road is actually inside Park County by about 400 feet before reaching the Montana state line. At the state line, Wyoming Highway 789 ends and US 310 continues northwest into the desert. At the junction with Montana Highway 72, US 310 turns north, passing through farmland and the towns of Bridger and Fromberg before running concurrently with US 212. The highway enters the city of Laurel, where US 212 continues onto I-90, and US 310 ends at Main Street.

==History==
Historically, US 310 intersected with US 10 at Laurel. After 1986, when US 10 was decommissioned west of West Fargo, North Dakota, US 310 no longer connected to its &quot;parent&quot; route.

The rainfall in the northern regions closer to the Tropic of Cancer receives around of annual rainfall compared to the southern portions that receives around . The average temperature is , while during the night it reaches . 

Due to the geography, the inhabitants historically, have been nomadic. In modern times, people have migrated to urban centres during the drought in the 1970s and the early 1980s. There are a few sedentary cultivators, who are located only in the Southern regions of the country. Research has indicated that the Saharan movement has resulted in reduction of rains in the region from the 1960s, when it received close to of rainfall.

The local administration is adopted from French local administration framework with a Ministry of Internal Control governing the local bodies. The original administration was held by Governors of each district, but after the municipal elections in 1994, the powers has been decentralized from the district bodies. Mauritania has been divided into 13 &quot;wilayas&quot; (regions), including the Nouakchott Capital District. The smallest administrative division in the country is the commune and the country has 216 of them. A group of communes form a &quot;moughataa&quot; (department) and the group of &quot;moughataa&quot; form a district. There are total of 53 &quot;moughataa&quot; for the 13 districts in the country. The executive power of the district is vested on a district chief, while it is on &quot;hakem&quot; for &quot;moughataa&quot;. Out of the 216 communes, 53 classified as urban and rest 163 are rural. 

The communes are responsible for overseeing and coordinating development activities and are financed by the state. The Local Governments have their own legal jurisdiction, financial autonomy, an annual budget, staff, and an office. The elections for the local government are conducted every five years along with Regional and Parliamentary elections. On account of the political instability, the last elections were held in 2023. 

Hodh El Gharbi Region is divided into four departments, listed below with their area and populations at the 2013 census.

<doc id="902433" wikidata="Q105893254" url="?curid=902433" title="Pamukkale">
<text>Pamukkale, () meaning &quot;cotton castle&quot; in Turkish, is a natural site in Denizli Province in southwestern Turkey. The area is famous for a carbonate mineral left by the flowing of thermal spring water. It is located in Turkey&#x27;s Inner Aegean region, in the River Menderes valley, which has a temperate climate for most of the year.

The ancient Greek city of Hierapolis was built on top of the travertine formation which is in total about long, wide and high. It can be seen from the hills on the opposite side of the valley in the town of Denizli, 20 km away. This area has been drawing visitors to its thermal springs since the time of classical antiquity. The Turkish name refers to the surface of the shimmering, snow-white limestone, shaped over millennia by calcite-rich springs. Dripping slowly down the mountainside, mineral-rich waters collect in and cascade down the mineral terraces, into pools below.
It was added as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988 along with Hierapolis.

==Geology==

Pamukkale&#x27;s terraces are made of travertine, a sedimentary rock deposited by mineral water from the hot springs. In this area, there are 17 hot springs with temperatures ranging from to . The water that emerges from the spring is transported to the head of the travertine terraces and deposits calcium carbonate on a section long covering an expanse of to . When the water, supersaturated with calcium carbonate, reaches the surface, carbon dioxide de-gasses from it, and calcium carbonate is deposited. Calcium carbonate is deposited by the water as a soft gel which eventually crystallizes into travertine.
==Archaeology==

There are only a few historical facts known about the origin of the city. No traces of the presence of Hittites or Persians have been found. The Phrygians built a temple, probably in the first half of the 7th century BC. This temple, originally used by the citizens of the nearby town of Laodicea, would later form the centre of Hierapolis.

Hierapolis was founded as a thermal spa early in the 2nd century BC within the sphere of the Seleucid Empire. Antiochus the Great sent 2,000 Jewish families to Lydia and Phrygia from Babylon and Mesopotamia, later joined by more from Judea. The Jewish congregation grew in Hierapolis and has been estimated as high as 50,000 in 62 BC. Hierapolis became a healing centre where doctors used the thermal springs as a treatment for their patients. The city began minting bronze coins in the 2nd century BC. These coins give the name &quot;Hieropolis&quot;. It remains unclear whether this name referred to the original temple (, &quot;hieron&quot;) or honoured Hiera, the wife of Telephus, son of Heracles and the Mysian princess Auge. This name eventually changed into Hierapolis (&quot;holy city&quot;). In 133 BC, when Attalus III died, he bequeathed his kingdom to Rome. Hierapolis thus became part of the Roman province of Asia. In AD 17, during the rule of Emperor Tiberius, a major earthquake destroyed the city.

Through the influence of the Christian Apostle Paul, a church was founded here while he was at Ephesus. The Christian Apostle Philip spent the last years of his life here. The town&#x27;s Martyrium was alleged to have been built upon the spot where Philip was crucified in AD 80. His daughters were also said to have acted as prophetesses in the region. During the 4th century, the Christians filled Pluto&#x27;s Gate (a ploutonion) with stones, suggesting that Christianity had become the dominant religion and had begun displacing other faiths in the area. Originally a see of Phrygia Pacatiana, the Byzantine Emperor Justinian raised the bishop of Hierapolis to the rank of metropolitan in 531. The Roman baths were transformed to a Christian basilica. During the Byzantine period, the city continued to flourish and also remained an important centre for Christianity.

===Museum===
The museum contains historical artifacts from Hierapolis, as well as those from Laodiceia, Colossae, Tripolis, Attuda and other towns of the Lycos (Çürüksu) valley. The museum also has a section devoted to artifacts found at Beycesultan Hüyük that includes examples of Bronze Age craft. Artifacts from the Caria, Pisidia and Lydia regions are also on display. The museum&#x27;s exhibition space consists of three halls of the vaulted Hierapolis Bath buildings and the open-air areas in the eastern side which are known to have been used as the library and gymnasium. The artifacts in open exhibition space are mostly marble and stone.

==World Heritage Site==

<text>U.S. Route 211 (US 211) is a spur of US 11 in the U.S. state of Virginia. Known for most of its length as Lee Highway, the U.S. Highway runs from Interstate 81 (I-81) and Virginia State Route 211 (SR 211) in New Market east to US 15 Business, US 29 Business, and US 211 Business in Warrenton. US 211 connects the Shenandoah Valley with the Piedmont town of Warrenton via Luray and Sperryville, where the highway runs concurrently with US 340 and US 522, respectively.

==Route description==

US 211 begins at a diamond interchange with I-81 just west of the town of New Market. Old Cross Road continues west as SR 211, a state-numbered extension of the U.S. Highway that runs west to Timberville. US 211 heads into the town as a four-lane divided highway that reduces to a two-lane undivided road prior to turning north onto US 11 (Congress Street). The highway runs concurrently with US 11 north to two-lane Lee Highway, onto which US 211 turns east. The U.S. Highway expands to a four-lane divided highway after leaving the town of New Market. US 211 becomes a three-lane road, with two lanes in the ascending direction and one on the descending side, for its curvaceous path over Massanutten Mountain, which summits at New Market Gap at the Shenandoah–Page county line.

US 211 expands to a four-lane divided highway again just west of its junction with US 340 at the hamlet of Intersections. The two highways pass through the hamlets of Salem, Whitehouse Landing—where the highways cross the South Fork Shenandoah River—and pass Luray Caverns at the west end of the town of Luray. US 211 Business (Main Street) passes through the center of town while US 211 and US 340 bypass the town to the north. US 340 splits north at a diamond interchange with Broad Street, which heads south into town as US 340 Business. US 211 crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Hagerstown District line just west of its intersection with the east end of US 211 Business (Main Street).
US 211 reduces to three lanes (two ascending, one descending) for its crossing of the Blue Ridge Mountains within Shenandoah National Park. The U.S. Highway reaches its summit at Thornton Gap, where the highway has an interchange with Skyline Drive and enters Rappahannock County. US 211 follows the Thornton River as a two-lane road east to Sperryville, where the highway becomes concurrent with US 522 (Sperryville Pike). The U.S. Highways follow a four-lane divided highway past Rediviva to the Rappahannock County seat of Washington. US 211 Business heads north onto town as Main Street and rejoins US 211 and US 522 as Warren Street adjacent to the historic Calvert Mill/Washington Mill. Just east of Rose Hill, US 522 splits north as Zachary Taylor Highway. US 211 passes through Amissville and briefly through Culpeper County, where the highway meets the northern end of SR 229 (Rixeyville Road).
US 211 crosses the Rappahannock River at Waterloo and enters Fauquier County. The highway enters the town of Warrenton as Frost Street south of Fauquier High School. At its intersection with US 17 Business and US 29 Business (Broadview Avenue), US 211 Business continues straight toward downtown Warrenton as Waterloo Street while the mainline U.S. Highway turns north concurrent with the business routes, which pass through a commercial area. The highway curves east at its northern junction with US 17 Business (Broadview Avenue) and continues as Lee Highway. US 211 reaches its eastern terminus at Blackwell Road, which heads south as US 15 Business and north as SR 672. US 15 Business and US 29 Business continue east along Lee Highway a short distance to their northern termini at an interchange with US 15, US 17, and US 29.

==History==
===Precursor: Virginia State Route 21===
Virginia State Route 21 was an original state route defined by the Virginia General Assembly as part of a state highway system in January 1918. Running from Warrenton through Manassas and Fairfax to the Highway Bridge over the Potomac River at Washington, D.C. In 1921, VA 21 was rerouted around Manassas and also rerouted at Fairfax eastward through Falls Church along Lee Highway to a terminus at the Aqueduct Bridge (replaced by the nearby Key Bridge in 1923). This new route was roughly that of present-day US 29 from Warrenton to Washington, D.C.

Also in December 1921, VA 21 was extended westward from Warrenton to what was then VA 7 at Massies Corner. It was then continued concurrently with VA 7 to Washington, Virginia. The following year, VA 21 was extended yet further west, first to Sperryville concurrent with VA 7, and then west through Luray to a terminus at VA 3 (now US 11) New Market, replacing VA 16.

In 1926 following the creation of U.S. Numbered Highway System, US 211 and US 50 designations were added to VA 21 (US 211 from New Market to Fairfax and US 50 from Fairfax to Washington, D.C.). In July 1933, VA 21 was removed from the state highway system as part of a commonwealth-wide renumbering scheme.

===US 211===

US 211 was an original US Highway, debuting in late 1926. It ran concurrently with the portion of what was then Virginia State Route 21 from New Market to Fairfax. US 211 begins on Old Cross Road. In 1928, US 211 was extended eastward to Washington, D.C., along the remainder of VA 21, replacing what had been US 50. (US 50 was relocated to the south along the route of what is now VA 236 from Fairfax to Alexandria.)

In 1934, US 29 was added to the route of US 211 from Warrenton to Washington, D.C. When it was extended to Washington, D.C. it was about 101 miles long.

In July 1980, the US 29/US 211 concurrency was eliminated. The eastern terminus of US 211 was truncated from Washington, D.C., to its current end in Warrenton, leaving US 29 on that route.

==Special routes==

===Luray business route===
U.S. Route 211 Business (US 211 Business) is a business route of US 211 in Page County. The highway runs between from US 211 and US 340 west of Luray to US 211 east of Luray. US 211 Business follows Main Street through the downtown area, where the business route crosses Hawksbill Creek and intersects US 340 Business, which heads south as Virginia Avenue and north as Broad Street to reconnect with US 340. At the east edge of downtown, US 211 Business has an at-grade intersection with Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Hagerstown District, which the highway parallels to its eastern terminus at US 211 east of the town.
===Washington business route===
U.S. Route 211 Business (US 211 Business) is a business route of US 211 in Rappahannock County. The highway runs between junctions with US 211 and US 522 on the south and east sides, respectively, of Washington. US 211 Business, which is coexistent with unsigned US 522 Business for its entire length, follows Main Street to the center of town and turns east onto Warren Avenue to return to US 211. The business route serves many art galleries and inns, including The Inn at Little Washington.
===Warrenton business route===
U.S. Route 211 Business (US 211 Business) is a business route of US 211 in Fauquier County. The highway runs from US 211, US 17 Business, and US 29 Business on the west side of Warrenton east to US 211, US 15 Business, and US 29 Business on the north side of Warrenton. The latter intersection also serves as the eastern terminus of US 211. US 211 Business heads east as Waterloo Street into the center of Warrenton. At US 15 Business (Main Street), the business route veers north onto Alexandria Pike. When Alexandria Pike veers east, US 211 Business and US 15 Business continue north on Blackwell Road to the former business route&#x27;s northern terminus at Lee Highway.

Mauritania has been divided into 13 &quot;wilayas&quot; (regions), including the Nouakchott Capital District. The smallest administrative division in the country is the commune and the country has 216 of them. A group of communes form a &quot;moughataa&quot; (department) and the group of &quot;moughataa&quot; form a district. There are total of 53 &quot;moughataa&quot; for the 13 districts in the country. The executive power of the district is vested on a district chief, while it is on &quot;hakem&quot; for &quot;moughataa&quot;. Out of the 216 communes, 53 classified as urban and rest 163 are rural. 

The communes are responsible for overseeing and coordinating development activities and are financed by the state. The Local Governments have their own legal jurisdiction, financial autonomy, an annual budget, staff, and an office. The elections for the local government are conducted every five years along with Regional and Parliamentary elections. On account of the political instability, the last elections were held in 2023.

<text>U.S. Route 311 is a United States highway that runs for from Winston-Salem, North Carolina to near Danville, Virginia. It connects the cities of Winston-Salem, Madison, and Eden. The route runs northeast from Winston-Salem to Danville. By the numbering convention, it is an auxiliary route of US 11, however except for a brief period shortly after the route was established, it has not connected to its parent route.

US 311 begins in Winston-Salem, at US 52/NC 8 (exit 110B) in the downtown area and proceeds northeast of the city. Starting in the vicinity of Madison, US 311 follows a number of different North Carolina state highways in short succession along with another major US Highway, US 220 before crossing the Virginia line. In Virginia, the route terminates shortly after crossing the border at the western end of the Danville Expressway (US 58).

In May 2018, North Carolina applied for, and received, permission from AASHTO to remove US 311 from the southernmost of the route, being mostly redundant to I-74, bringing it to its current routing from Winston-Salem to Danville. However, some US 311 signage remains on its former southernmost segment near Randleman.

==Route description==

US 311 begins at exit 110B from the US 52/NC 8 freeway in Winston-Salem, NC and leads into the downtown area. It follows N Martin Luther King Jr Dr for a short time before continuing northeast along New Walkertown Road. It travels northeast and intersects NC 66 at the edge of Walkertown, which motorists can use to connect to nearby shopping centers situated along US 158 (Reidsville Road). Shortly after, US 311 then turns to follow Harley Drive and turns again to follow Main Street through town. North of Walkertown, the road takes the local name of Walnut Cove Road. At the southern edge of the town of Walnut Cove NC 65 joins for a short concurrency. At the northern boundary of Walnut Cove, NC 89 has its terminus at US 311, and the highway turns northeast. North Carolina Highway 772 terminates at US 311 near Pine Hall and entering the town of Madison, US 311 takes an easterly route as Academy Street, meeting up with NC 704 along the way. East of Madison, it leaves NC 704 and joins with the Future Interstate 73/US 220 by-pass, both routes traveling due north in a short concurrency to Mayodan. In Mayodan, US 311 then leaves the US 220 freeway, and proceeds easterly again, along NC 135 towards Eden. Three other NC routes join with 311 in Eden in short succession: NC 770, NC 87 and NC 14, then the 4 joined routes cross the Dan River along Van Buren Street in Eden. NC 14/NC 87 continue north on Van Buren, while US 311 exits Van Buren Street on a grade-separated interchange onto Meadow Road near the Eden Mall, heading northeast into a rural area before crossing into Virginia.

After the passing through the small communities of Berry Hill and Buford, it turns due west joining US 58 Business before the northern terminus of US 311 occurs at US 58, west of Danville at the western end of the Danville Expressway.

The J.J. Webster Highway is the official North Carolina name of US 311/NC 135 from Mayodan to Eden.

==History==

Established as an original U.S. Route in 1927, it originally traversed from West End, through Asheboro, High Point, Winston-Salem, Madison, and Stoneville, before entering Virginia and continuing to Roanoke, where it reached its parent route, U.S. 11. The alignment followed part of what was NC 70 and all of NC 77, both of which were decommissioned in 1934.

In 1933, US 311 was extended south through Pinehurst, Aberdeen, and Laurinburg, to Rowland, overlapping NC 241. A year later, US 220 was established and replaced US 311 south of Asheboro and north of Madison, severing the connection with its parent route. Sections further south were replaced by NC 2 (today&#x27;s NC 211) and US 501. Later in 1966, US 311 was truncated in Randleman; by 1973, US 311 southern terminus was moved to US 220 Bypass, in Randleman.

By 1952, US 311 was rerouted west of downtown Winston-Salem, following Waughtown Road, Stadium Drive, Claremont Avenue and 7th Street, to New Walkertown Road. In the mid-1980s, US 311 was moved onto new freeway through southeast Forsyth County. Part of the freeway shortly became a stretch of Interstate 40, eventually running concurrent with the interstate . In 1996, the route through Winston-Salem changed again, this time also going north along US 52/NC 8 to Martin Luther King Jr. Drive then east onto New Walkertown Road.

In 1997, the first section of the East Belt was opened in High Point, rerouting US 311 onto the new freeway to Eastchester Drive then back into downtown High Point with concurrency with North Carolina Highway 68. The old alignment along North Main Street became US 311 Business. On November 20, 2004, the second section of the &quot;East Belt&quot; was opened, rerouting US 311 to I-85 Bus./US 29/US 70. On November 22, 2010, the third and final section of the &quot;East Belt&quot; was completed, linking Interstate 85; Also Interstate 74 was established as a concurrency of US 311 from Cedar Square Road to North Main Street.

In September 2003, US 311 was extended north from Madison to NC 14/NC 87/NC 770 in Eden, via US 220 and NC 135. The extension was finally signed in August 2011. The route was approved by American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in November 2012, after an initial request by officials in Eden, to be extended to US 58 in Virginia; which in January 2013, NCDOT signed off on extending the route and replacing parts of NC 700 and NC 770. US 311 was signed in the field in Virginia, from Danville south to the state line (replacing secondary State Route 863) in September 2013.

Since 2003, a project called the &quot;US 311 Connector&quot; has been planned by NCDOT and the city of Winston-Salem. Estimated at $23.5 million (2003 dollars), the four-lane partial controlled-access highway would connect between I-40 (exit 196) and I-40 Business (exit 8) (now US 421, exit 230), linking US 311 with US 158 (Reidsville Road); it also included a landscaped medium with walking/bicycle trails parallel to it. By 2016, the project has ceased appearing in the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), though still part of the Winston-Salem 2035 Transportation Plan.

In May 2018, AASHTO approved a request by NCDOT to eliminate between Randleman and Winston-Salem, moving the southern terminus from I-73/US 220 in Randleman to Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard in Winston-Salem, as all but of this section is freeway which already has other primary designations; those non-redundant sections would be reassigned secondary North Carolina routes. In January 2019, NCDOT officially eliminated the section. Despite this, signage for US 311 from along I-74 southeast of High Point to its former southern terminus at I-73/US 220 in Randleman remains as of June 2023.

===North Carolina Highway 897===

North Carolina Highway 897 (NC 897) was an original state highway that traversed from NC 60/NC 65, in Winston-Salem, to SR 33 at the Virginia state line. Going north on Liberty Street, from 4th Street, in Winston-Salem, it went at a northeasterly route along Old Walkertown Road and Pine Hall Road to Pine Hall. Continuing northeasterly, it connects Madison, Mayodan, Stoneville and Price, North Carolina before reaching the Virginia state line. In 1925, it was renumbered as part of NC 77. Today, all of the Forsyth and Stokes section of NC 897 have been downgraded to secondary roads; while the Pine Hall to Madison section is part of US 311 and the Madison to Stoneville is part of US 220 Business.

===High Point business loop===

Established in 1997, when mainline US 311 was placed on new freeway east of High Point, it was long following North Main Street from US 311 to Eastchester Drive. In December 2005, US 311 Business was extended south, through the downtown area, to I-85 Bus./US 29/US 70. However, on November 23, 2009, US 311 Business was decommissioned, a couple of years before the completion of the &quot;East Belt.&quot;

The rainfall in the northern regions closer to the Tropic of Cancer receives around of annual rainfall compared to the southern portions that receives around . The average temperature is , while during the night it reaches . 

Due to the geography, the inhabitants historically, have been nomadic. In modern times, people have migrated to urban centres during the drought in the 1970s and the early 1980s. There are a few sedentary cultivators, who are located only in the Southern regions of the country. Research has indicated that the Saharan movement has resulted in reduction of rains in the region from the 1960s, when it received close to of rainfall.

The local administration is adopted from French local administration framework with a Ministry of Internal Control governing the local bodies. The original administration was held by Governors of each district, but after the municipal elections in 1994, the powers has been decentralized from the district bodies. Mauritania has been divided into 13 &quot;wilayas&quot; (regions), including the Nouakchott Capital District. The smallest administrative division in the country is the commune and the country has 216 of them. A group of communes form a &quot;moughataa&quot; (department) and the group of &quot;moughataa&quot; form a district. There are total of 53 &quot;moughataa&quot; for the 13 districts in the country. The executive power of the district is vested on a district chief, while it is on &quot;hakem&quot; for &quot;moughataa&quot;. Out of the 216 communes, 53 classified as urban and rest 163 are rural. 

The communes are responsible for overseeing and coordinating development activities and are financed by the state. The Local Governments have their own legal jurisdiction, financial autonomy, an annual budget, staff, and an office. The elections for the local government are conducted every five years along with Regional and Parliamentary elections. On account of the political instability, the last elections were held in 2023. 

Guidimaka is divided into two departments, namely, Ould Yenge and Selibaby.

<text>U.S. Route 411 (US 411) is an alternate parallel-highway associated with US 11. It extends for about from US 78 in Leeds, Alabama, to US 25W/US 70 in Newport, Tennessee. US 411 travels through northeastern Alabama, northwestern Georgia, and southeastern Tennessee. It is signed north-south, as with most highways that have odd numbers, but the route runs primarily in a northeast-southwest direction, and covers a more east-west mileage than it does north-south. Notable towns and cities along its route include Gadsden, Alabama; Rome, Georgia; Cartersville, Georgia; Maryville, Tennessee; Sevierville, Tennessee, and Newport, Tennessee.

US 411 and US 11 never intersect with one another, though they come very close in various places including Leeds, Alabama, Gadsden, Alabama, and Maryville, Tennessee. US 411 also spends much of its route close to the Interstate Highway System: Interstate 20 (I-20), I-40, I-75, and I-59, though it never has an interchange with I-59.

Most of the terrain through which US 411 passes is rural countryside, with no major metropolitan areas directly along its route. However, it does pass relatively near the major cities of Birmingham, Alabama, Chattanooga, Tennessee and Knoxville, Tennessee. In Sevier County, Tennessee, south of Knoxville, US 411 is used by many tourists as a route to the northern side of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. US 411 passes approximately north of the national park, but intersects with US 441, which actually goes through this park. Although US 411 has a south–north designation, it contains long stretches that are west–east, and its overall direction is actually southwest–northeast.

US 411 is generally a two-lane highway through the countryside. However, it has long been a four-lane, divided highway connecting Rome and Cartersville, Georgia, and it is a multi-lane highway connecting Cartersville with I-75. Also, for part of its route in the Cartersville area, US 411 shares a four-lane, divided highway with US 41. Furthermore, the Tennessee Department of Transportation completed a project to widen the highway to four lanes between Maryville and Ocoee, Tennessee, and between Chestnut Hill and Newport, Tennessee.

===Alabama===
US 411 begins at US 78 (Parkway Drive) in the city of Leeds in far eastern Jefferson County. SR 25, the U.S. Highway&#x27;s companion route, continues south as a signed highway that briefly follows US 78 east before splitting south toward Harpersville; however, mileposts along US 411 in Alabama generally reflect SR 25. US 411 heads north along two-lane 9th Street, which has a pair of at-grade crossings of Norfolk Southern Railway rail lines. The street&#x27;s name changes to Whitmire Street, which the U.S. Highway follows to Ashville Road. US 411 follows Ashville Road, a two-lane road with center turn lane, northeast into St. Clair County, where the highway expands to four lanes. The U.S. Highway meets I-20 at a partial cloverleaf interchange as it leaves the city of Leeds. US 411 continues as two-lane Moody Parkway northeast through the Cahaba Valley formed by the Little Cahaba River between Pine Ridge to the west and Oak Ridge to the east. The highway has a brief concurrency with SR 174 through Odenville, where the highways pass under a CSX rail line.

US 411 continues northeast through the Beaver Creek Valley between Pine Ridge and the Beaver Creek Mountains. The highway leaves the valley after it joins US 231 (Heart of Dixie Highway) to pass through Pine Ridge to the city of Ashville. The U.S. Highways enter town along 5th Street and proceed to the county courthouse, where they meet the eastern end of SR 23 (6th Avenue). Both highways turn east onto 6th Avenue, then US-231 turns north onto Court Street East. US 411 leaves Ashville along Rainbow Drive, which heads northeast between Big Canoe Creek and Canoe Creek Mountain to the south. The U.S. Highway crosses the mountain and enters Etowah County where it crosses the Big Canoe Creek branch of Neely Henry Lake. US 411 follows the western flank of Dunaway mountain to Rainbow City, where the route intersects SR 77 (Grand Avenue).
US 411 expands to a four-lane divided highway as it enters the city of Gadsden. The highway crosses the Big Wills Creek branch of Neely Henry Lake and meets the eastern end of I-759 at a partial cloverleaf interchange; that freeway continues east as SR 759. US 411 veers onto Albert Rains Boulevard, which follows the right bank of the Coosa River through downtown Gadsden. The highway passes by the Spirit of American Citizenship Monument and under Broad Street, an Omnitrax rail line, and US 278 and US 431 (Meighan Boulevard), which access US 411 via a partial cloverleaf interchange. US 411 leaves (or will soon exit) Gadsden along a newly constructed four-lane divided highway that passes between Shinbone Ridge to the west and several loops of the Coosa River. The U.S. Highway drops to two lanes before it enters Cherokee County, then expands again to a four-lane divided highway, Weiss Lake Boulevard.

US 411 curves east along the northern edge of Weiss Lake and intersects SR 68 (Industrial Boulevard) in the town of Leesburg, east of which US 411 and SR 68 cross the lake, an impoundment of the Coosa River. Shortly after entering the city of Centre, the U.S. Highway and state highway turn onto the Clarence E. Chestnut Jr. Bypass, a four-lane road with center turn lane; US 411 Business and SR 25 continue along Main Street into the center of town. SR 68 diverges from the U.S. Highway at Cedar Bluff Road, which carries SR 283 southwest toward downtown. SR 283 becomes US 411&#x27;s companion route on the bypass, which next intersects SR 9 (Armory Road), which intersects SR 68 immediately to the north. US 411 drops to two lanes east of SR 9 and curves south to collect the east end of US 411 Business (Main Street) and SR 25 on the eastern edge of Centre. US 411 continues east and crosses Cowan Creek before reaching the Alabama–Georgia state line and the northern terminus of SR 25 east of the hamlet of Forney.

===Georgia===

US 411 enters Georgia at the western terminus of its companion SR 53 in the southwestern corner of Floyd County. The two-lane highway, which is named Gadsden Road, has a brief concurrency with SR 100, which heads north as Fosters Mill Road and south as Mill Street, on the west side of the town of Cave Spring. US 411 enters town along Alabama Street and leaves to the northeast along Rome Street. The U.S. Highway continues as Cave Spring Road, which crosses Cedar Creek and passes through Vans Valley. US 411 passes under the West Rome Bypass and intersects US 27 and SR 1 (Cedartown Highway), which US 411 joins heading north. The four-lane road with center turn lane passes along the west side of Lindale and between Walker Mountain and Booze Mountain on the west and east, respectively.

US 411 and US 27 expand to a divided highway as they enter the city of Rome and then a four-lane freeway as they cross over a Norfolk Southern rail line. The freeway has a diamond interchange with Darlington Drive and Old Lindale Road and a half-diamond interchange with Maple Road. Immediately to the east of the second interchange, US 411 passes through a directional T interchange; US 27, SR 1, SR 20, and SR 53 head north toward downtown Rome and US 411 and SR 20 head east. Immediately to the east of the split, the U.S. Highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 101 (Dean Avenue); there is no ramp from SR 101 to westbound US 411. The freeway ends east of SR 101. US 411 has an intersection with the southern end of SR 1 Loop (East Rome Bypass) before leaving the city limits.

US 411 heads east along Cartersville Highway into Bartow County. The four-lane divided highway parallels and then crosses the Etowah River. US 411 crosses over an east–west CSX rail line immediately before its trumpet interchange with US 41 and SR 3 (Joe Frank Harris Parkway). The two U.S. Highways head southeast into the city of Cartersville then diverge immediately to the east of a north–south CSX rail line at the boulevard&#x27;s partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 61 (Tennessee Street). Immediately to the north of the interchange, SR 20 (Canton Highway) splits east and SR 61 becomes US 411&#x27;s companion highway toward Tennessee. The U.S. Highway heads north as a four-lane undivided highway that becomes divided temporarily through the highway&#x27;s partial cloverleaf interchange with I-75 (Larry McDonald Memorial Highway).

US 411 drops to two lanes south of the town of White, where the highway begins to closely parallel the north–south CSX rail line. The U.S. Highway intersects SR 140 (Henry Mack Hill Road) in the hamlet of Rydal before entering Gordon County. US 411 passes through the town of Fairmount as Salacoa Street; the U.S. Highway runs concurrently with SR 53 between Calhoun Street and Fairmount Highway. North of the town of Ranger, through which the route is named Tennessee Highway, the highway meets the eastern end of SR 156 (Red Bud Road). US 411 passes through the town of Oakman, then diverges from a road called Old Highway 411, crosses to the west side of the railroad, intersects SR 136 (Nicklesville Road), and enters Murray County. The U.S. Highway passes to the west of Reregulation Reservoir and Carters Lake, both impoundments of the Coosawattee River, which the highway crosses to the west of the lakes.

US 411 intersects US 76 and SR 282 at Ramhurst, which follow part of Old Highway 411 before heading east through the Cohutta Mountains, and begins to follow the path of the Old Federal Road through Cherokee country, widening to four undivided lanes along the west flank of Fort Mountain. US 411 and US 76 continue as 3rd Avenue through the city of Chatsworth. In the center of town, the highways intersect Fort Street, which carries SR 2 and SR 52 east toward Fort Mountain and State Route 52 Alternate to the west. At the north end of town, US 76 and SR 52 leave US 411 along G.I. Maddox Boulevard. The U.S. Highway passes along the west flank of Camp Ground Mountain and is named Hill Street through the town of Eton, where the route meets the eastern end of SR 286 (Coffey Road) and drops to two lanes. US 411 passes through the town of Crandall, crosses to the east side of the railroad, and follows the Fairy Valley to the hamlet of Cisco, where SR 2 splits to the west. US 411 crosses over to the west side of the rail line in the hamlet of Tennga immediately before reaching the Georgia–Tennessee state line, where SR 61 has its northern terminus.

===Tennessee===
US 411 enters Tennessee at the southern terminus of its companion SR 33 in the southwestern corner of Polk County. The highway crosses the Conasauga River in the hamlet of Conasauga and meets the eastern end of SR 313 (Ladd Springs Road) in Oldfort. US 411 parallels the CSX rail line through the hamlet of Ocoee, where the highway expands to four lanes plus a center turn lane and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 64 and US 74 (SR 40). North of Ocoee, US 411 crosses over the railroad and the Ocoee River and passes through the town of Benton, where the route meets the northern end of SR 314 (Parksville Road). The U.S. Highway expands to a divided highway north of the town. US 411 intersects and begins to run concurrently with SR 30, crosses the Hiwassee River, passes by Hiwassee/Ocoee Scenic River State Park, and meets the eastern end of SR 163 in the village of Delano.

US 411 becomes undivided and crosses over the CSX rail line shortly after entering McMinn County. In the town of Etowah, the highway follows Tennessee Avenue, meets the western end of SR 310 (Mecca Pike), and SR 30 splits west along David M. Lilliard Memorial Highway. The highway becomes divided once again north of town and continues through farmland and countryside before becoming undivided once again before entering the town of Englewood and goes through town passing just east of the downtown area and intersecting and having a short concurrency with SR 39 (Athens Pike; Tellico Street). US 411 then becomes a divided highway again as it leaves Englewood and enters countryside once again before crossing into Monroe County.

US 411 continues through countryside before entering the city of Madisonville and becomes undivided for a short distance before having an intersection with its former alignment, which travels through downtown (Old US Highway 411), before becoming divided and having a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 68 (New Highway 68), which provides access to Sweetwater, The Lost Sea, Tellico Plains, Cherohala Skyway and the Cherokee National Forest, before going along a bypass of downtown as a divided highway passing through a major business district. US 411 then has a grade-separated interchange with its former alignment (Warren Street) before becoming undivided before leaving Madisonville and continuing north as a 4-lane divided highway through farmland and countryside. US 411 then comes to an intersection and becomes concurrent with SR 72 (Loudon Highway) just before entering the town of Vonore (the northern terminus of the Old Federal Road) and becoming undivided once again as this time it passes straight through downtown. It intersects SR 360, which provides access to Fort Loudoun and Fort Loudoun State Park and then divides before it crosses the bridge over the Little Tennessee River/Tellico Lake into Loudon County, where SR 72 turns toward the mountains. Along the southeast edge of Greenback the road becomes undivided again and is known as Greenback Road, passing SR 95 which provides access to downtown Greenback. US 411 then continues through countryside and farmland to cross into Blount County.

US 411 continues through farmland as an undivided 4-lane highway and has an intersection with SR 336 northeast of the community of Lanier. It then continues through farmland before entering the city of Maryville and becoming concurrent with US 129 (SR 115) (Calderwood Highway; provides access to Calderwood, Tallassee, and Deals Gap) and pass by a few businesses before really entering the business district at the intersection with SR 335 (William Blount Drive). They continue through a major business district before coming to grade-separated interchange where US 411 and US 129 split with US 129 bypassing downtown to enter Alcoa and provide access to McGhee Tyson Airport and Knoxville and US 411 continues north into downtown next to Foothills Mall. US 411 continues into downtown, as Broadway Avenue, and comes to an intersection with US 321 (SR 73) (Lamar Alexander Parkway; provides access to Walland, Townsend, Wears Valley, and Great Smoky Mountains National Park). It then has another intersection with SR 336 before traveling through the center and most historic part of the city before coming to an intersection with SR 35 (Hall Road/Washington Street), with SR 33 continuing north to Knoxville and US 411 turning right to become concurrent with SR 35 (its new companion route). It follows Washington Street for a short distance before turning left onto Sevierville Road, at an intersection with SR 447 (Washington Street), and leaves downtown. It then passes by Blount Memorial Hospital before going through some neighborhoods before leaving Maryville and continues as a narrow 2-lane highway through countryside and farmland and crosses the Little River in the community of Wildwood. It then continues through countryside and farmland, passing by 411 Speedway, before entering the city of Seymour and Sevier County.

US 411 goes through some Seymour neighborhoods for about a mile and a half before coming to an intersection with US 441 (SR 71; Chapman Highway; provides access to Knoxville) and SR 338 (Boyds Creek Highway; provides access to Kodak and Douglas Dam), with US 411/SR 35 turning right to become concurrent with US 441/SR 71 and continue as an undivided 4-lane highway through Seymour before leaving Seymour and traversing the Slate Knobs, the eastern foothills of Chilhowee Mountain, and becoming narrow and curvy while maintaining 4 lanes throughout. After several miles it widens to a 4-lane divided highway and stays that until it enters the city of Sevierville where it becomes undivided once again. From Seymour to Sevierville, US 411 is northbound and US 441 is southbound as the road runs east. (Highway route signs once gave the conflicting directions.) The route crosses the Pigeon River and enters downtown at the intersection with SR 66 (Winfield Dunn Parkway; provides access to I-40), where US 441/SR 71 splits southward, as Forks of the River Parkway, to go to Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. US 411/SR 35 continue through downtown as Main Street and has an intersection with SR 448 (North Parkway/Parkway) before leaving downtown at the crossing of Middle Creek, where it transitions to Dolly Parton Parkway. It continues through a major business district and has an intersection with SR 449 (Veterans Boulevard; provides access to Dollywood and Pigeon Forge). It then passes by some more businesses before leaving Sevierville and entering the community of Cherokee Hills, near the intersection with SR 416 (Pittman Center Road; provides access to Pittman Center and Gatlinburg). It then has an intersection with SR 339 (Long Springs Road; provides access to Cosby) before leaving Cherokee Hills and narrowing to an improved 2-lane Highway. It then passes through the community of New Center before having a sharp switchback and becoming narrow before crossing into Jefferson County.

After crossing the county line, US 411 immediately enters the community of Chestnut Hill and has an intersection with SR 92 next to the Bush Bean Museum, which also right across the road from the Bush Brothers and Company Cannery plant and corporate headquarters. US 411 then enters some mountains and becomes curvy for a short distance before widening to a new 4-lane divided highway just before crossing into Cocke County.

It continues along the new 4-lane highway into the city of Newport and ends at its national northern terminus at an intersection with US 25W/US 70 (SR 9) just a short distance away from that route&#x27;s interchange with I-40 (Exit 432 A-B; though exit 432 A is only signed as US 411 on the interstate in both directions), with SR 35 turning right to become concurrent with, though unsigned, that route towards downtown.

===National Highway System===
The following portions of US 411 are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation&#x27;s economy, mobility, and defense:
*From the southern part of Rainbow City, Alabama, through Gadsden, to a point southwest of Turkey Town
*From the southern end of the US 27/SR 1 concurrency in Six Mile, Georgia, through Rome and Cartersville, to McCallie
*The entire length of the US 76 concurrency, from south-southeast of Chatsworth, into the city
*From the Georgia–Tennessee state line, in Tennga, to the bridge over the Little River, northeast of Maryville, Tennessee

<text>Baker University is a private university in Baldwin City, Kansas, United States. Founded in 1858, it was the first four-year university in Kansas and is affiliated with the United Methodist Church. Baker University is made up of four schools. The College of Arts and Sciences and the undergraduate courses in the School of Education (SOE) are located on the campus in Baldwin City. The School of Professional and Graduate Studies (SPGS) and the graduate branch of the SOE serve nontraditional students on campuses in Overland Park, Kansas, and online.

Enrollment in all four schools has grown to a student population more than 3,000, with about 900 students on the Baldwin City campus.

==History==

Baker University was founded in 1858 and named for Osman Cleander Baker, a Methodist Episcopal biblical scholar and bishop. The schoolwhich is the oldest, continually operating institution of higher learning in the statewas the first four-year university in Kansas and funds were raised by local donations and donors from the East. Baker&#x27;s first president, Werter R. Davis, a minister and Civil War officer, served from 1858 to 1862. The original campus building, now known as Old Castle Museum, houses a museum of the university and Baldwin City.

== Athletics ==
The Baker athletic teams are called the Wildcats. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing as a founding member of the Heart of America Athletic Conference (HAAC) since its inception in the 1971–72 academic year. The Wildcats previously competed in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC) from 1902–03 to 1970–71.

<text>Magdalena &quot;Magda&quot; Forsberg (née Wallin; born 25 July 1967) is a Swedish former cross-country skier and biathlete. She was the dominant female biathlete from 1997 to 2002, when she retired, winning the Biathlon World Cup for six years straight. She is also a six-time world champion, a two-time Olympic bronze medalist, and holds the record for the most World Cup victories in women&#x27;s biathlon.

She has been married to Henrik Forsberg, also a biathlete and cross-country skier, since mid-1996.

==Cross-country skiing==
Forsberg competed as a cross country skier from 1988 to 1996, participating in the World Cup. Her best results at the Winter Olympics were in Albertville in 1992 where she finished seventh in the 4 × 5 km relay and 26th in the 15 km event.

Forsberg&#x27;s best individual finish at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships was tenth in the 30 km event at Lahti in 1989. In 1987 she was in the Swedish team that finished third in the 4 × 5 km relay. Her best World Cup finish was second in a 10 km event in Finland in 1988.

She also won six gold medals in the World Championships, was runner-up once, and placed third five times. At the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, Forsberg won two bronze medals. In her career she managed a total of 42 individual Biathlon World Cup wins, which is more than any other female biathlete to date.

Magdalena Forsberg retired from active sports after the 2001–02 season. After being retired for four years she made a temporary comeback in April 2006 due to losing a bet. The bet said Forsberg would enter the Swedish Championship in Women&#x27;s Relay with fellow biathlon skier Anna Carin Olofsson-Zidek if the latter won an Olympic gold in Turin. The duo went on to win the competition, Forsberg outrunning her competitors in the first leg and Olofsson extending their lead in the second.

During large parts of her career, Forsberg was trained by Wolfgang Pichler, who later took over as coach of the Swedish national biathlon team.

== Post retirement ==
After retirement, Forsberg, along with Peter Forsberg, footballer Mathias Jönsson, and golfer Per-Ulrik Johansson enrolled in a business class at the Johan Cruyff Institute in Stockholm. She received additional education in the field of tax legislation.

==Other honours==
Forsberg competed at the 1998 Winter Olympics both as a biathlete and as a cross country skier. She is the only Swedish athlete to have been awarded the Jerring Award four times.

<text>Whiskas (formerly known as Kal Kan) is a brand of cat food sold internationally. It is owned by the American company Mars Inc.. It is available either as small meaty pieces in sauce, gravy or jelly packaged in tins, foil trays or pouches, as well as in the form of small biscuits sold in cartons or pouches and milk sold in small bottles. Its packaging has a recognizable purple colour, and its logo consists of a stylized silhouette of a cat&#x27;s head.

==History==
Whiskas, originally known as Kal Kan, started manufacturing pet foods in 1936 from its headquarters near Los Angeles, California. It eventually grew its operations across the United States. In 1958, it entered the UK market under the Whiskas brand, which was later expanded throughout Europe.

The company was bought by Mars Inc. in 1968, and became a subsidiary of Petfoods Ltd (later re‐named Pedigree Petfoods).

In 1989, Kal Kan changed its name in the U.S. to Whiskas, to bring it under a single international brand (in line with their European operations) and to help unify advertising campaigns globally. Prior to 1989, Kal Kan&#x27;s dry cat food had been sold under the Crave brand. Although Kal Kan had more brand equity in the United States, &quot;Whiskas&quot; was also found to be perceived by consumers a more likeable and &quot;feline-sounding&quot; name.

In the United States, Whiskas is made in McLean, Virginia, by Pedigree Petfoods.

==Marketing and slogan==
In the United Kingdom, a well-known advertising slogan for Whiskas was &quot;8 out of 10 cats prefer Whiskas&quot;, which later became &quot;eight out of 10 owners said their cat prefers it&quot;. After a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority, this was changed to &quot;eight out of 10 owners who expressed a preference said their cat prefers it&quot;. The British panel show &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot; takes its name from the slogan. The slogan has been much imitated – in the 1980s, Red Stripe Lager was advertised with the slogan &quot;9 out of 10 cats prefer it&quot;, a play on &quot;cat&quot; meaning &quot;a trendy person&quot;. Similarly, a 1987 TV advertisement for Pretty Polly in which a nylon stocking was used to replace the fan belt in a Jaguar car used the slogan &quot;So smooth, 9 out of 10 cats prefer them&quot;; &quot;cat&quot; this time is a reference to the make of car featured.

In 1999, Australian rules footballer Garry Hocking changed his name by deed poll to &quot;Whiskas&quot; as part of the Geelong Football Club promotion with the company. It was the first such publicity stunt of its kind.

On June 3, 1999, Whiskas singles aired &quot;the very first commercial for cats&quot; on American television. The VHS release featured a small segment on how the advert worked and showed several cats&#x27; &quot;reactions&quot;. The advert was a collection of clips with contrasting colours, fish and video captured from underwater. The end of the video (before fading out and then running again) claimed that &quot;In our tests, 8 out of 10 preferred it&quot;.

In Hungary, the Whiskas advertising slogan is &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;Cats would buy Whiskas (if they could)&quot;. Slogans with the same meaning are used in Serbia, Germany, Austria, Finland, Estonia, France, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Russia, Romania, Poland, the Netherlands, and Slovenia. In Denmark, there once was an advertising slogan &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;Cats would choose Whiskas.&quot; In Sweden, a similar slogan is used: &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;Whiskas – If the cat itself gets to choose&quot;. In Russia, the slogan was &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;Your kitty would buy Whiskas&quot;, where the phrase is rhymed, since one of the words for &quot;kitty&quot; and &quot;Whiskas&quot; rhyme in Russian. In Italian-speaking countries, the slogan &quot;i gatti comprerebbero Whiskas&quot; - &quot;cats would buy Whiskas&quot; has long been in use.

In Autumn of 2009, Whiskas handed out feeding dishes to the earliest 1000 registrations to their menu planner.

==Geography==
The region is named after the Dakhlet Nouadhibou Bay and contains Mauritania&#x27;s part of the Cabo Blanco peninsula. It is the westernmost region of the country. It borders Western Sahara to the north, the Mauritanian region of Inchiri to the east and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The Bay of Arguin dominates the west of the region, the Banc d&#x27;Arguin National Park dominates the south and includes much of the bay&#x27;s islands, the southernmost of the bay and the southeasternmost parts of the park are not in the region, about a third of the region is a national park area. Nearly all of the country&#x27;s islands and islets lies in this region and they include Echakcher, Kiaones, Niroumi, Nair, Arel, Tidra, the country&#x27;s largest island, Kijji, Touffat, Cheddid and sometimes Serenni. 

Mauritania is mostly covered with desert, with only its western regions around the coast of Atlantic Ocean having some vegetation, along with the southern regions on the Senegal river. There are some oasis in the desert regions. Since it is a desert, there are large shifting dunes forming temporary ranges. The average elevation is around above the mean sea level. The rainfall in the northern regions closer to the Tropic of Cancer receives around of annual rainfall compared to the southern portions that receives around . The average temperature is , while during the night it reaches . 

Due to the geography, the inhabitants historically, have been nomadic. In modern times, people have migrated to urban centres during the drought in the 1970s and the early 1980s. There are a few sedentary cultivators, who are located only in the Southern regions of the country. Research has indicated that the Saharan movement has resulted in reduction of rains in the region from the 1960s, when it received close to of rainfall. 

==Local administration==

The local administration is adopted from French local administration framework with the Ministry of Internal Control governing the local bodies. The original administration was held by Governors of each district, but after the municipal elections in 1994, the powers have been decentralized from the district bodies.

Nouadhibou is one of 15 &quot;wilayas&quot; (regions). The smallest administrative division in the region is the commune. A group of communes form a &quot;moughataa&quot; (department) and a group of &quot;moughataa&quot; form a district. The executive power of the district is vested on a district chief, while it is on the &quot;hakem&quot; in the &quot;moughataa&quot;. 

The communes are responsible for overseeing and coordinating development activities and are financed by the state. The Local Governments have their own legal jurisdiction, financial autonomy, an annual budget, staff, and an office. The elections for the local government are conducted every five years along with regional and parliamentary elections. On account of the political instability, the last elections were held in 2023. 

Settlements outside the regional capital includes Agadir or Arguin, Arkeiss, R&#x27;Geiba, Chami, Iouik (or Iwik), Tanoudert, Teichott, Ten-Alloul and Tessot.
