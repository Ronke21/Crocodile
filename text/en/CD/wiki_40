<text>Fosco Maraini (; 15 November 1912 – 8 June 2004) was an Italian photographer, anthropologist, ethnologist, writer, mountaineer and academic.

==Biography==
He was born in Florence from the Italian sculptor Antonio Maraini (1886–1963) and Cornelia Edith &quot;Yoï&quot; Crosse also known as Yoï Crosse-Pawlowska (1877–1944), a model and writer of English and Polish descent who was born in Tállya, Hungary. As a photographer, Fosco Maraini is perhaps best known for his work in Tibet and Japan. The visual record Maraini captured in images of Tibet and on the Ainu people of Hokkaidō has gained significance as historical documentation of two disappearing cultures. His work was recognized with a 2002 award from the Photographic Society of Japan, citing his fine-art photos—and especially his impressions of Hokkaido&#x27;s Ainu. The society also acknowledged his efforts to strengthen ties between Japan and Italy over 60 years. Maraini also photographed extensively in the Karakoram and Hindu Kush mountain ranges of Central Asia, in Southeast Asia and in the southern regions of his native Italy.

As an anthropologist and ethnographer, he is known for his published observations and accounts of his travels with Tibetologist Giuseppe Tucci during two expeditions to Tibet, first in 1937 and again in 1948.

As a mountaineer, he is perhaps best known for the 1959 ascent of Saraghrar and for his published accounts of this and other Himalayan climbs. As a climber in the Himalayas, he was moved to describe it as &quot;the greatest museum of shape and form on earth.&quot;

From 1938 to 1943, Maraini&#x27;s academic career progressed in Japan, teaching first in Hokkaido (1938–1941) and then in Kyoto (1941–1943); but what he himself observed and learned during those years may be more important than what he may have taught. Dacia, his eldest daughter, would decades later recall that &quot;the first trip I took was on the sea from Brindisi to Kobe.&quot; Two of his three daughters were born in Japan: Yuki (registered as Luisa in Italy) was born in Sapporo in 1939, Antonella (Toni) in Tokyo in 1941. After the Italians signed an armistice with the allies in World War II, the Japanese authorities asked Maraini and his wife Topazia Alliata to sign an act of allegiance to Mussolini&#x27;s puppet Republic of Salò. They were both asked separately and separately they refused, and were interned with their three daughters of six, four and two years old in a concentration camp at Nagoya for two years. Those memories of 1943 through 1946 evolved into some chapters of the book &quot;Meeting with Japan&quot; by Fosco Maraini. Dacia Maraini&#x27;s collection of poetry drawn from those difficult years, &quot;Mangiami pure,&quot; was published in 1978.

The Maraini family retreated to Italy after the Allies occupied Japan. This period became the core of another book by Dacia Maraini who remembers that they left Asia &quot;without either money or possessions, stripped bare, with nothing on our backs except the clothes handed out by the American military.&quot; The years in Italy are described in the book, &quot;Bagheria,&quot; named after the Sicilian town not far from Palermo where the family lived.

In time, Maraini did return to his &quot;adopted homeland&quot; of Japan; and in 1955, this journey of rediscovery became the basis for his book, &quot;Meeting with Japan.&quot;

In an interview, one of his daughters explained that one of her earliest memories of her father speaking is when he claimed: 
The head of the Tuscany regional government publicly explained that Maraini had &quot;honored Florence and the Tuscany by teaching us to be tolerant of other cultures.&quot;

Fosco Maraini was, with Giuliana Stramigioli among others, a founding member of the AISTUGIA – the Italian Association for the Japanese Studies.

The 1963 film &quot;Violated Paradise&quot;, directed by Marion Gering was based on Maraini&#x27;s work &quot;&quot; (1960). A few images shot by Maraini&#x27;s crew were used in the production.

<text>Wairoa is the largest town in the Wairoa District and the northernmost town in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is located on the northern shore of Hawke Bay at the mouth of the Wairoa River and to the west of Māhia Peninsula. It is northeast of Napier, and southwest of Gisborne, on State Highway 2. It is the nearest town to the Te Urewera protected area and former national park, which is accessible from Wairoa via State Highway 38. It is one of three towns in New Zealand where Māori outnumber other ethnicities (the other towns being Kawerau and Ōpōtiki), with 62.29% of the population identifying as Māori.

==History==

===Early history===

Te Wairoa was originally a Māori settlement. The ancestral waka (canoe) &quot;Tākitimu&quot; travelled up the Wairoa river (full name: Te Wairoa Hōpūpū Hōnengenenge Matangirau) and landed at Mākeakea, near where Tākitimu meeting house stands today. Te Reinga Falls is the starting point of the Wairoa river and said to be linked with the taniwha Hinekorako and Ruamano, who guided &quot;Takitimu&quot; to Aotearoa. The Wairoa River mouth is associated with two taniwha, Tapuwae and Te Maaha, who are engaged in an ongoing struggle. There were a number of pā in close vicinity to the river, and the river was a major route for transport and trading. The river was an important source of food and still is to this day, including whitebait, flounder, mullet and eel.

Early European settlement in the area included a whaling station and trading post established by William Rhodes in 1839, dealing largely in flax. These establishments offered sufficient income and attraction. Wairoa&#x27;s initial name was Clyde, but this was changed, largely to avoid confusion with Clive near Napier and Clyde in the South Island. The north part of the town is called North Clyde. The town rose to prominence during the New Zealand Wars, during which time it was a garrison town.

The New Zealand government bought the land on which the town is built in 1864. This land was divided up and then sold as sections in 1866. The Wairoa Harbour Board was established in 1872. The Wairoa lighthouse was built between 1877 and 1878 and its beacon was first lit in 1878. The tower was reinforced in 1879 to provide greater stability after a storm damaged it. The first bridge across the Wairoa river was built in 1888.

===20th century===
The Wairoa Borough Council was established in 1909. The Napier to Wairoa railway line was started in 1911. Progress was intermittent with the Wairoa river railway bridge being built in 1930. The railway line was completed in 1937. In April 1938, flooding hit the area, causing hundreds of slips which damaged the railway line. Work to restore the railway took place and it was opened again for trains by the end of 1938 and fully utilised by 1939. This led to a decline in the use of the port at Wairoa, with the port used for the last time in 1942. The Wairoa Harbour Board was abolished in 1946. The road bridge across the Wairoa river was damaged in the 1931 Hawke&#x27;s Bay earthquake and a replacement bridge was completed in 1933.

Annie and Rosamond Smyth were murdered in their home in the Salvation Army hall in 1942. The killer was not identified at the time. Herbert Brunton was murdered in 1948, and this also went unsolved. Leo Silvester Hannan made a death bed confession to the three killings in 1962 while in prison for a 1950 murder in Wellington.

In early March 1988, much of the North Island was severely affected by storm damage from Cyclone Bola. In Wairoa, three days of heavy rain in the catchment areas caused severe flooding and damage including the loss of a 60-metre section of town&#x27;s main bridge, cutting the town in half, and interrupting phone lines and the town&#x27;s water supply. There was severe flood damage to farms, businesses, homes and the showgrounds. A new bridge, the third at the location, was completed and officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990.

In 1990 Wairoa won the last New Zealand Top Town Final in the original Top Town series and were the reigning champs until the series started again in 2009. Due to some confusion with a claim by Greymouth to be the last champions, Wairoa was not eligible for the new top town series and unable to defend their title.

===Gang conflict===
There have long been tensions between the rival Mongrel Mob and Black Power gangs in Wairoa. In 1988, Wairoa&#x27;s main street: Marine Parade was the scene of a fatal shooting of two Black Power associates. In 2003, a Mongrel Mob member was killed in February and a sniper shot a Black Power gang member dead in a van following an incident near the Wairoa Courthouse in November. In 2010, a Black Power gang member was shot in the face. Two Black Power members retaliated later that year and shot a Mongrel Mob member several times at a Wairoa petrol station. In 2021, gang related violence flared again with five separate incidents of guns being fired at homes in Wairoa. The police launched Operation Atlas to reduce tensions and stop the ongoing violence in Wairoa. In 2022, a shotgun blast hit the window of a child&#x27;s bedroom (though the child was not present in the room) and a person received serious leg injuries. This was due to gang-crossfire where two homes were shot at in a drive-by shooting. 

===21st century===
In 2017, Rocket Lab built their rocket launch site on the Mahia Peninsula with Wairoa being the closet town to the site (83 kilometres away). This has led to a number of employment opportunities for Wairoa.

The Wairoa branch of the ANZ bank closed in 2018, and the BNZ and Westpac banks closed in 2021. Wairoa also lost its only dentist in 2020 forcing locals to visit Gisborne or Napier for dental treatment.

In February 2023, Wairoa was hit by Cyclone Gabrielle with it being described as &quot;the most catastrophic weather event Wairoa has experienced in living memory&quot;. State Highway 2 between Napier and Wairoa was closed until May 2023 because of the damage it suffered. in May 2023, plans were progressing to prevent flooding affecting Wairoa again with the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Regional Council saying that they wish to invest in a flood protection scheme. The risk of flooding &quot;in some areas as high as 5 percent. This means, for example, that a dwelling designed for a 50-year life has a 93 percent chance of being flooded in its lifetime.&quot; It was noted by the mayor Craig Little, &quot;There is actually zero flood protection at the moment&quot; for Wairoa.

In late June 2024, Wairoa experienced torrential rain and high tides, which led to 118 homes being flooded. The flooding was compounded by a blockage at the mouth of the Wairoa River, which caused the river to burst its banks and significant flooding three blocks inland. In response to flooding, the New Zealand Government allocated NZ$3 million to disaster relief efforts in Wairoa. Following the Wairoa flooding, both the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Regional Council and the Government commissioned investigations into local flood mitigation efforts.

==Demographics==
Wairoa covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Wairoa had a population of 4,527 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 438 people (10.7%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 213 people (4.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,548 households, comprising 2,223 males and 2,304 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.96 males per female. The median age was 36.4 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 1,116 people (24.7%) aged under 15 years, 861 (19.0%) aged 15 to 29, 1,782 (39.4%) aged 30 to 64, and 768 (17.0%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 43.0% European/Pākehā, 69.5% Māori, 4.4% Pacific peoples, 3.5% Asian, and 1.1% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 8.3, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 34.7% had no religion, 39.4% were Christian, 14.6% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.2% were Hindu, 0.9% were Muslim, 0.5% were Buddhist and 1.3% had other religions.

==Climate==

== Economy ==

The meat processing plant in Wairoa was first established in 1916. Originally owned by the Wairoa Co-operative Meat Company, the building was destroyed by a fire on 5 February 1931. The AFFCO group bought it in 1990. The meat processing plant employs around 650 people in their peak season. They process mutton, lamb, goat and beef and export much of the product. There is also a rendering plant onsite producing bone meal and tallow. In 2015 the Employment Court deemed a lockout of 170 workers at the plant illegal. Management had locked workers out for five months who refused to sign individual contracts. In 2018, the Court of Appeal ruled that those workers locked out should be paid lost wages. In February 2020, a worker at the plant was killed on the job, crushed by pallets. Worksafe closed the plant briefly and investigated the incident.

Forestry is playing an increasing role in the economy of Wairoa. Many farms are being converted to forests which earn carbon credits. There are concerns that the loss of farming will shrink the size of the town&#x27;s economy and lead to depopulation.

In January 2020, the Government announced funding of $6.1 million to support rebuilding in the central business district. The funding will support a Wairoa Integrated Business and Tourism Facility, a Wairoa Digital Employment Programme and a Wairoa Regional Digital Hub.

== Amenities and events ==

Since 2005, Wairoa has been host to the annual Wairoa Māori Film Festival, New Zealand&#x27;s premiere Māori and indigenous film festival, which has hosted film makers from across the nation and around the world. In 2015, the festival began to be hosted in part at the newly revitalised Gaiety Cinema and Theatre, which had recently been fitted out with one of the world&#x27;s most advanced theatre sound systems.

The Wairoa Agricultural &amp; Pastoral Society was established in 1899 and held its first show next to the Frasertown Domain. A variety of events are run at the annual show including rodeo, dog trials, competition sheep shearing, show jumping and other equestrian events. The 2022 edition, due to be held in January was cancelled due to Covid-19 restrictions.

The Wairoa museum, located at 142 Marine Parade, is housed since 2001, in what was the ANZ bank building. The collection focusses on local and Māori history and includes a Māori flag from the Māori land wars in 1865. In 2016, the museum expanded its exhibition space and refurbished the galleries and developed a new interactive &quot;discovery space&quot;.

The Wairoa Centennial Library was built in 1960. It was designed by the Wellington Architectural firm Porker &amp; Martin. The Wairoa Rotary Club raised $20,000 to built an extension to the library in 1974 to house a museum. Further work to the library was completed in 1988 and 2003. The library is located at 212 Marine Parade.

Wairoa is home to two golf courses. The Wairoa Golf Club is located 5 kilometres to the north of central Wairoa. The Mahia Golf Club is located on the Mahia Peninsula and has a nine-hole course.

The Wairoa community centre is home to an indoor stadium. Indoor soccer, netball, cricket, badminton, volleyball and basketball can be played. There is also a gym and a 25-metre indoor swimming pool. It is located at 33 Marine Parade.

==Marae==

The township includes a number of marae (meeting grounds) and wharenui (meeting houses) for the local iwi (tribe) of Ngāti Kahungunu and its hapū (sub-tribes).

In October 2020, the Government committed $1,949,075 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Ruataniwha, Hinemihi, Hurumua, Iwitea, Kihitu, Taihoa, Tākitimu-Waihirere, Tawhiti A Maru, Te Mira and Whakakī, and 14 other Ngāti Kahungunu marae, creating 164 jobs.

== Infrastructure ==

=== The three waters ===
In 2020, the Wairoa District Council applied to the Regional Council for resource consents for the Wairoa town wastewater scheme. Wastewater is discharged to an estuary in the lower reaches of the Wairoa River, through an outfall about 100 metres from the shore. A panel of independent commissioners reviewing the application noted that the discharge to water is not culturally acceptable to the community, but that land-based discharge is currently unaffordable and the council has not secured suitable land. The review concluded that the town &quot;had a very significant problem&quot; and urged the council to get help from central government.

During 2021, the Government consulted with regional and district councils about proposed major reforms for the three waters sector nationwide, involving the proposed transfer of assets from 67 local authorities to four new large entities. The mayor of Wairoa, Craig Little criticised the proposed reforms and expressed concerns about the loss of local representation and control.

=== Hospital ===
Wairoa Hospital (Te Hauora o te Wairoa / Wairoa Health) is a 12-bed hospital that provides both maternity and acute medical inpatient beds. It is run by the Hawke&#x27;s Bay District Health Board. Also located at Te Hauora o te Wairoa / Wairoa Health is a general practice, an emergency department (level 2), radiology and laboratory services, mental health and addiction services and a number of outpatient clinics. it is located at 36 Kitchener Street, Wairoa.

=== Transport ===
The Wairoa airport is located on Airport Road on the northern side of Wairoa. The runway is 914 metres long. The airport is home to the Wairoa Aero Club.

Wairoa is connected south west to Napier and north east to Gisborne by State Highway 2. Connecting Wairoa to the northwest is State Highway 38 which travels past Lake Waikaremoana where it joins State Highway 5.

The Napier to Gisborne section of the Palmerston North-Gisborne railway line was mothballed in 2012 after being damaged by a storm. It was repaired and reopened between Napier and Wairoa in January 2020 with funding of $6.2 million from the Provincial Growth Fund. Freight services ran to transport logs to Napier Port. The service was suspended after six return trips as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on the forestry sector. It reopened in November 2020.

<text>Sergey Mikhaylovich Darkin (; born December 9, 1963) is a Russian businessman, ex-governor of Primorsky Krai (from 2001 to 2012) and former deputy minister of Regional Development of Russia.

== Biography ==

Sergey Darkin was born on December 9, 1963, in Bolshoy Kamen, Primorsky Krai. He attended schools in Artyom and Vesyoly Yar. He graduated with honors as a specialist in marine transportation from the Far Eastern Naval College (1985) and continued with post-graduate education on the economics of marine transportation. He also received a degree in Finance from the Far Eastern Academy of Business (1999).

In the 1980s, Darkin worked in the Port of Vladivostok as a dockworker. In 1989, he became the deputy manager of the &quot;Dallizing&quot; leasing company. In 1991, he founded the &quot;Roliz&quot; company, which focused on shipbuilding and fishing. In the late 1990s, he founded or controlled a number of companies in Primorsky Krai. In 1998, he became the president of &quot;Primorye bank&quot;.

== Politics ==

In 2001, Darkin was elected the governor of Primorsky Krai. In 2005, the president Vladimir Putin reassigned him to this position.

<text>The Po Leung Kuk, founded as the Society for the Protection of Women and Children, is a charitable organisation in Hong Kong that provides support for orphaned children, education and other services.

== History ==

In the late 19th century, abduction and trafficking of women and children were widespread in Hong Kong, under the &quot;mui tsai&quot; system. On 8 November 1878, a group of local Chinese (Lo Lai-ping, Shi Shang-kai, Fung Ming-shan and Tse Tat-shing) presented a petition to the governor of Hong Kong, John Pope Hennessy, to set up the Po Leung Kuk to rescue the kidnapped victims, and the society was officially opened in August 1882.

The stated objective of the Kuk, as it is informally known, is to care for the young and protect the innocent. In the early days, it was primarily engaged in suppressing abduction of women and children and providing shelters and education for such victims. There were some difficulties with the colonial government, as a result of cultural differences, but the overall intention of improving the lot of unfortunates was earnestly pursued. However, it has been suggested that the arrangements the Kuk provided had the convenient effect of maintaining a supply of servants and potential concubines for the wealthy Chinese families of Hong Kong, in a &quot;peculiarly Chinese form of patriarchy&quot;.

Today the Po Leung Kuk has over 300 units providing a wide spectrum of services, including social services (including medical services), educational services, recycling centers, recreational services and cultural services.

==Services==
The Kuk currently runs more than 300 units throughout Hong Kong, providing welfare, educational, cultural and recreational services.

<doc id="885330" wikidata="Q1967726" url="?curid=885330" title="Charles Caldwell Ryrie">
<text>Charles Caldwell Ryrie (March 2, 1925 – February 16, 2016) was an American Bible scholar and Christian theologian. He served as professor of systematic theology and dean of doctoral studies at Dallas Theological Seminary and as president and professor at what is now Cairn University. After his retirement from Dallas Theological Seminary he also taught courses for Tyndale Theological Seminary. He is considered one of the most influential American theologians of the 20th century. He was the editor of &quot;The Ryrie Study Bible&quot; by Moody Publishers, containing more than 10,000 of Ryrie&#x27;s explanatory notes. First published in 1978, it has sold more than 2 million copies. He was a notable proponent of classic dispensationalism.

==Early life, education, and family==
Ryrie was born to John Alexander and Elizabeth Caldwell Ryrie in St. Louis, Missouri, and grew up in Alton, Illinois. His paternal grandfather, John Alexander Ryrie Sr. (1827-1904), served as a correspondent in the late 1870&#x27;s of the earliest known Plymouth Brethren meeting in the United States, which was started in Alton by Scottish settlers in 1849. After graduating from high school in 1942, Charles attended The Stony Brook School on Long Island for one semester, where he became acquainted with headmaster Frank E. Gaebelein.

Ryrie attended Haverford College, intending on following his father into a banking career. However, during his junior year, while meeting with Dallas Theological Seminary founder Lewis Sperry Chafer, Ryrie dedicated his life to Christian ministry, and left Haverford to study theology at Dallas Theological Seminary. Haverford conferred his BA (1946) on the basis of his studies at Dallas. A year later, he earned his Th.M. (1947), and two years following that his Th.D. (1949). He went on to complete his Doctor of Philosophy (1954) at the University of Edinburgh. He also earned a Litt.D. from Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary, now Liberty University School of Divinity.

In 1987, Ryrie&#x27;s wife divorced him. Believing that the Bible did not allow divorced persons to remarry, he determined to live the rest of his life as a single man, despite his wife&#x27;s subsequent remarriage.

Dr. Ryrie was the father of three children and grandfather of three grandchildren.

==Academic career==
Ryrie began his academic career by teaching one summer for Midwest Bible and Missionary Institute (which would eventually become a part of Calvary Bible College). Ryrie joined the faculty of Westmont College in 1948 and eventually became dean of men and chairman of the Department of Biblical Studies and Philosophy. He returned to Dallas Theological Seminary in 1953 to teach systematic theology, but left for several years to serve as president of Philadelphia College of the Bible (now Cairn University), from 1958 to 1962. He was also an adjunct faculty member from Fall 1991 through Fall 2001. Upon returning to Dallas once again, he became dean of doctoral studies until his retirement in 1983. Ryrie has written 32 books which have sold more than 1.5 million copies. Additionally, his study bible has sold more than 2.6 million copies.

Ryrie was an avid collector of quality rare Bibles and Bible manuscripts. On December 5, 2016, his collection was sold by Sothebys for 7.3 Million USD. A 15th century copy of a Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible New Testament sold for $1,620,500 at auction.

== Theology ==
Charles Ryrie taught Free Grace theology, the belief that only fiduciary faith in Jesus Christ is needed for salvation. Ryrie wrote a book &quot;So Great Salvation: What It Means to Believe in Jesus Christ&quot;, in which he criticized the Lordship salvation view of salvation. Ryrie defended the view that the word &quot;metanoia&quot; (repentance) refers to a change of mind, being a synonym for faith instead of a turning from sin. Charles Ryrie agreed with some of the points in Calvinism, holding to total depravity and unconditional election, though he taught that the atonement was universal. Ryrie was a dispensationalist, holding to a pretribulation rapture. 

Ryrie agreed with the doctrine of divine simplicity, saying it underscores God&#x27;s self-existence. Ryrie rejected Monothelitism, Apollinarianism and held to Trinitarian theology. 

Charles Caldwell Ryrie taught that when attending church, men should remove their caps and that women should wear a headcovering (veil), as he said that Saint Paul&#x27;s command in was &quot;based on theology (headship v.3), the order of creation (v.7-9), and the presence of angels in the meeting (v.10).&quot;

==Death==
Ryrie died on February 16, 2016, in Dallas, Texas.

<text>Linux Software Map (LSM) is a standard text file format for describing Linux software. It also refers to the database constructed from these files. LSM is one of the standard methods for announcing a new software release for Linux.

== File format ==
If a Linux program is to be distributed widely, an LSM file may be created to describe the program, normally in a file called &quot;software_package_name&quot;.lsm. This file begins with and ends with . It has one field on each line. The field name is separated from the value by a colon (:). Mandatory fields are Title, Version, Entered-date, Description, Author and Primary-site.

== Database ==
The collective database of LSM entries can be searched in order to locate software of a particular type. This database has passed through various owners. It was created by Jeff Kopmanis, Lars Wirzenius maintained it for a while, and now the current maintainer is Aaron Schrab (with help from volunteers).

The database can be downloaded in its entirety, or one can perform limited queries using a web interface.

As of August 2022, the LSM index is still automatically updated by a e-mail robot. However, the maintainer of man-db eventually decided to stop maintaining its LSM data due to the perceived obsolescence of LSM.

<text>A cotton mill is a building that houses spinning or weaving machinery for the production of yarn or cloth from cotton, an important product during the Industrial Revolution in the development of the factory system.

Although some were driven by animal power, most early mills were built in rural areas at fast-flowing rivers and streams, and used water wheels for power. The development of viable steam engines by Boulton and Watt from 1781 led to the growth of larger, steam-powered mills. They were built in a concentrated way in urban mill towns, such as Manchester. Together with neighbouring Salford, it had more than 50 mills by 1802.

The mechanisation of the spinning process in the early factories was instrumental in the growth of the machine tool industry, enabling the construction of larger cotton mills. Limited companies were developed to construct mills, and together with the business of the trading floors of the cotton exchange in Manchester, a vast commercial city developed. Mills generated employment demand, drawing workers from largely rural areas and expanding urban populations. They provided incomes for girls and women. Child labour was used in the mills, and the factory system led to organised labour. Poor conditions became the subject of exposés. In England, the Factory Acts were written to regulate them.

The cotton mill, originally a Lancashire phenomenon, was copied in New England and New York, and later in the southern states of America. In the 20th century, North West England lost its supremacy to the United States. In the postwar years, Japan, other Asian countries and ultimately China became dominant in cotton manufacturing.

==History==
In the mid-16th century Manchester was an important manufacturing centre for wool and Leigh and south towards Manchester, used flax and raw cotton imported along the Mersey and Irwell Navigation.

===Key inventions===
During the Industrial Revolution cotton manufacture changed from a domestic to a mechanised industry, made possible by inventions and advances in technology. The weaving process was the first to be mechanised by the invention of John Kay&#x27;s flying shuttle in 1733. The manually-operated spinning jenny was developed by James Hargreaves in about 1764, and speeded up the spinning process. The roller spinning principle of Paul and Bourne became the basis of Richard Arkwright&#x27;s spinning frame and water frame, patented in 1769. The principles of the spinning jenny and water frame were combined by Samuel Crompton in his spinning mule of 1779, but water power was not applied to it until 1792. 

Many mills were built after Arkwright&#x27;s patent expired in 1783 and, by 1788, there were about 210 mills in Great Britain. The development of cotton mills was linked to the development of the machinery they contained. 

By 1774, 30,000 people in Manchester were employed using the domestic system in cotton manufacture. Handloom weaving lingered into the mid-19th century but cotton spinning in mills relying on water power and subsequently steam power using fuel from the Lancashire Coalfield began to develop before 1800. Many more people were employed by the mills. 

===Successful modern first mills===

====Paul-Wyatt mills====
The first cotton mills were established in the 1740s to house roller spinning machinery invented by Lewis Paul and John Wyatt. The machines were the first to spin cotton mechanically &quot;without the intervention of human fingers&quot;. They were driven by a single non-human power source which allowed the use of larger machinery and made it possible to concentrate production into organised factories. Four mills were set up to house Paul and Wyatt&#x27;s machinery in the decade following its patent in 1738: the short-lived, animal-powered Upper Priory Cotton Mill in Birmingham in 1741; Marvel&#x27;s Mill in Northampton operated from 1742 until 1764 and was the first to be powered by a water wheel; Pinsley Mill in Leominster probably opened in 1744 and operated until it burned down in 1754; and a second mill in Birmingham set up by Samuel Touchet in 1744, about which little is known, but which was sufficiently successful for Touchet later to seek the lease on the mill in Northampton. The Paul-Wyatt mills spun cotton for several decades but were not very profitable, becoming the ancestors of the cotton mills that followed.

====Arkwright-type mills====
Richard Arkwright obtained a patent for his water frame spinning machinery in 1769. Although its technology was similar to that of Lewis Paul, John Wyatt, James Hargreaves and Thomas Highs, Arkwright&#x27;s powers of organisation, business acumen and ambition established the cotton mill as a successful business model and revolutionary example of the factory system. Arkwright&#x27;s first mill – powered by horses in Nottingham in 1768 – was similar to Paul and Wyatt&#x27;s first Birmingham mill although by 1772 it had expanded to four storeys and employed 300 workers. In 1771, while the Nottingham mill was at an experimental stage, Arkwright and his partners started work on Cromford Mill in Derbyshire, which &quot;was to prove a major turning point in the history of the factory system&quot;. It resembled the Paul-Wyatt water-powered mill at Northampton in many respects, but was built on a different scale, influenced by John Lombe&#x27;s Old Silk Mill in Derby and Matthew Boulton&#x27;s Soho Manufactory in Birmingham. Constructed as a five-storey masonry box; high, long and narrow, with ranges of windows along each side and large relatively unbroken internal spaces, it provided the basic architectural prototype that was followed by cotton mills and English industrial architecture through to the end of the 19th century.

Arkwright recruited large, highly disciplined workforces for his mills, managed credit and supplies and cultivated mass consumer markets for his products. By 1782 his annual profits exceeded £40,000, and by 1784 he had opened 10 more mills. He licensed his technology to other entrepreneurs and in 1782 boasted that his machinery was being used by &quot;numbers of adventurers residing in the different counties of Derby, Leicester, Nottingham, Worcester, Stafford, York, Hertford and Lancashire&quot; and by 1788 there were 143 Arkwright-type mills nationwide. The early mills were of light construction, narrow – about wide – and low in height, with ceiling heights of only 6–8 ft. The mills were powered by water wheels and lit by daylight. Mills were made by millwrights, builders and iron founders. By the end of the 18th century there were about 900 cotton mills in Britain, of which approximately 300 were large Arkwright-type factories employing 300 to 400 workers, the rest, smaller mills using jennies or mules, were hand- or horse-driven and employed as few as 10 workers.

====Early steam mills====

Before 1780, only water power was available to drive large mills, but they were dependent on a constant flow of water and built in rural locations, causing problems of labour supply, transportation of materials and access to urban merchants for large mill-owners. Steam engines had been used to pump water since the invention of the atmospheric engine by Thomas Newcomen in 1712 and, starting with the engine installed at Arkwright&#x27;s Haarlem Mill in Wirksworth, Derbyshire in 1780, were used to supplement the supply of water to the water wheels of cotton mills.

In 1781 James Watt registered a patent for the first rotative steam engine designed to &quot;give motion to the wheels of mills or other machines&quot;. Concerns remained over the smoothness of the power supplied by a steam engine to cotton mills, where the regularity of the yarn produced was dependent on the regularity of the power supply, and it was not until 1785 at Papplewick, in Robinson&#x27;s Mill near Nottingham that a steam engine was successfully used to drive a cotton mill directly. Boulton and Watt&#x27;s engines enabled mills to be built in urban contexts and transformed the economy of Manchester, whose importance had previously been as a centre of pre-industrial spinning and weaving based on the domestic system. Manchester had no cotton mills until the opening of Arkwright&#x27;s Shudehill Mill in 1783 and in 1789 Peter Drinkwater opened the Piccadilly Mill – the town&#x27;s first mill to be directly powered by steam – and by 1800 Manchester had 42 mills, having eclipsed all rival textile centres to become the heart of the cotton manufacturing trade.

Water continued to be used to drive rural mills but mills, driven by steam, were built in towns alongside streams or canals to provide water for the engine. Murrays&#x27; Mills alongside the Rochdale Canal, in Ancoats were powered by 40 hp Boulton and Watt beam engines. Some were built as room and power mills, which let space to entrepreneurs. The mills, often &#x27;L&#x27; or U-shaped, were narrow and multi-storeyed. The engine house, warehousing and the office were inside the mill, although stair towers were external. Windows were square and smaller than in later mills. The walls were of unadorned rough brick. Construction was sometimes to fireproof designs. The mills are distinguished from warehouses in that warehouses had taking-in doors on each storey with an external hoist beam. Only the larger mills have survived.

Mills of this period were from 25 to 68 m long and 11.5 m to 14 m wide. They could be eight stories high and had basements and attics. Floor height varied from 3.3 to 2.75 m on the upper stories.

Boilers were of the wagon type; chimneys were square or rectangular, attached to the mill, and in some cases part of the stair column. The steam engines were typically low-pressure single-cylinder condensing beam engines. The average power in 1835 was 48 hp. Power was transmitted by a main vertical shaft with bevel gears to the horizontal shafts. The later mills had gas lighting using gas produced on site. The mules with 250–350 spindles were placed transversely to get as much light as possible.

====Early weaving mills====
The development of mills to mechanise the weaving process was more gradual partly because of the success of John Kay&#x27;s 1733 invention of the flying shuttle, which increased the productivity of domestic hand loom weavers. Kay took out a patent for the application of water power to a Dutch loom in 1745 and opened a weaving factory in Keighley in 1750, but nothing is known of its success. A further attempt to mechanise the weaving process took place at Garrett Hall in Manchester in 1750 but was unsuccessful in enabling one worker to operate more than a single loom. The first feasible power loom was patented by Edmund Cartwright in 1785, although it was initially a primitive device it established the basic principle that would be used in powered weaving until the 20th century. In 1788 Cartwright opened Revolution Mill in Doncaster which was powered by a Boulton and Watt steam engine and had 108 power looms on three floors as well as spinning machinery, but it was not a commercial success and closed in 1790. A second mill using Cartwright&#x27;s machinery, opened in Manchester in 1790 but was burned to the ground by hand loom weavers within two years. By 1803 there were only 2,400 power looms operating in Britain.

====Early American mills====

In the United States, the early horse-powered Beverly Cotton Manufactory was designed by Thomas Somers, who started construction and testing of the facility in 1787, finishing the factory&#x27;s equipment in 1788. Experience from this factory led Moses Brown of Providence to request the assistance of a person skilled in water-powered spinning. Samuel Slater, an immigrant and trained textile worker from England, accepted Brown&#x27;s proposal, and assisted with the design and construction of Slater Mill, built in 1790 on the Blackstone River in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Slater evaded restrictions on emigration put in place to allow England to maintain its monopoly on cotton mills. Slater Mill resembled the Beverly Cotton Manufactory and a mill in Derbyshire in which he had worked.

===Remodelling and expansion (1815–1855)===

====United Kingdom====
From 1825 the steam engine was able to power larger machines constructed from iron using improved machine tools. Mills from 1825 to 1865 were generally constructed with wooden beamed floors and lath and plaster ceilings. William Fairbairn experimented with cast iron beams and concrete floors. Mills were of red brick or sometimes local stone with a greater attention to decoration and the main gate was often highlighted with stone decoration. The stair columns were exterior to the main floors. During this period the mules got wider and the width of the bays increased. Specialised mill architects appeared. 
Mills of this period were tall, narrow, and wide. They were commonly built with one or two wings to form an &#x27;L&#x27; or &#x27;U&#x27; shape. Brunswick Mill was a 28-bay mill, 6 storeys of 16 m by 92 m. Each self-acting spinning mule had 500 spindles. Single-storey north light weaving sheds were sometimes added to the mills. The looms caused vibrations that damaged the structure of multi-storey buildings, and specialised weaving mills became common. They were single-storey sheds with an engine house and offices, and preparation and warehousing in a two-storey ancillary building.

Large mills remained the exception during this period. In 1833 the largest mill was that of McConnel and Company in Ancoats, Manchester with 1,545 workers, but in 1841 there were still only 25 mills in Lancashire with 1,000 workers or more, and the number of workers in the average mill was 193.

The Lancashire boiler was patented in 1844, and the economiser in 1845. This can be seen as a square brick structure between the boiler house and the chimney. The engines were double compound upright beam engines of the type patented by McNaught in 1845. Each room in the mill would have line shafts suitable for the type of frame, connected by belt drives or gearing.

In 1860, there were 2650 cotton mills in the Lancashire region, employing 440,000 people. The workers, 90 per cent of whom were adults and 56 per cent females, were paid a total of £11.5 million per annum. The mills used 300,000 hp of power, of which 18,500 was generated by waterpower. The mills had 30,387,467 spindles and 350,000 power looms. The industry imported 1,390,938,752 lb of raw cotton a year. It exported 2,776,218,427 yards of cotton cloth and of twist and yarn. The total value of its exports was £32,012,380. 

1860 saw the end of this period of rapid growth. The Cotton Famine of 1861–1865 was a period when American long staple cotton became unavailable due to an American Civil War. After the war, the economics of the industry had changed, and a new larger mill was required.

====United States====
In 1814 the Boston Manufacturing Company of New England established a &quot;fully integrated&quot; mill on the Charles River at Waltham, Massachusetts. Despite the ban on exporting technology from the UK, one of its proprietors, Francis Cabot Lowell, had travelled to Manchester to study the mill system and memorised some of its details. In the same year, Paul Moody built the first successful power loom in the US. Moody used a system of overhead pulleys and leather belting, rather than bevel gearing, to power his machines. The group devised the Waltham System of working, which was duplicated at Lowell, Massachusetts and several other new cities throughout the state. Mill girls, some as young as ten, were paid less than men, but received a fixed wage for their 73-hour week. They lived in company-owned boarding houses, and attended churches supported by the companies.

In the 1840s George Henry Corliss of Providence, Rhode Island improved the reliability of stationary steam engines. He replaced slide valves with valves that used cams. These Corliss valves were more efficient and more reliable than their predecessors. Initially, steam engines pumped water into a nearby reservoir that powered the water wheel, but were later used as the mill&#x27;s primary power source. The Corliss valve was adopted in the UK, where in 1868 more than 60 mill engines were fitted with them.

====India====
The large steam-powered Bowreath Cotton Mills opened at Fort Gloster near Calcutta by British interests in the 1820s, using British women to impart machine-spinning skills to the local workforce. They closed down in 1837 but reopened with Dwarkanath Tagore as a major shareholder, and by 1840 lay at the centre of a major industrial complex powered by five steam engines, that included a twist mill, foundry and a rum distillery.

===Golden Age (1855–1898)===
====United Kingdom====
Just before 1870, a mill was built by a joint-stock spinning company and this financial structure led to a new wave of mill construction. The phrase Oldham Limiteds describes these companies. Family-run firms continued to build, but grouped into associations such as the Fine Spinners&#x27; and Doublers&#x27; Association. Joseph Stott of Oldham perfected a method of fireproof floor construction using steel beams supporting brick vaults that in turn supported concrete floors that would support heavier equipment. Ring frames replaced mule frames; they were heavier and larger and were placed transversely, the floors became larger (up to wide) and higher to provide light. The bay size in a mill was defined by the positioning of machines. In an 1870 mill the bay was typically , and the brick vaults though there were variations.

Engines were run at higher pressures and from 1875, powered horizontal shafts on each floor by means of ropes. This was a prominent change as a rope race had to be built running the height of the mill. The engine needed more space and the engine house, boiler house and economiser were external to the main mill. Mills continued to get bigger, and were sometimes paired; two mills being driven by one engine. Another change was the trend of having carding on one floor. To achieve this, the ground floor was extended outwards behind the mill often a full mill width. In a single mill, the crosswall divided the blowing room from the rest, as it was here that there was greatest risk of fire.

Mills became wider, Houldsworth Mill, Reddish (1865) was 35 m wide and accommodated 1200 spindle mules. It was of four storeys and had sixteen bays on each side of a central engine house; a double mill. The central block provided offices and warehousing. A mill had a range of ancillary buildings. Stair columns often extending above the mill and housed a water tank for the sprinkler system. The floors were higher allowing for taller windows. Accrington brick was used from 1890, decorated with yellow sandstone with moulded brick and terracotta features. Etched and stained glass was used in the offices. Mills were designed by specialist architects and architectural quality became a major consideration.

The power needed and provided to drive these mills was increasing. Beam engines were installed until the 1870s when horizontal engines took over. Abbey Mill Oldham (1876) needed 700 hp, Nile Mill (1896) needed 2500 hp. By the 1890, boilers produced 160 psi, and the triple expansion horizontals became standard. Chimneys were octagonal.

====United States====

Following the American Civil War, cotton mills were built in the southern states of South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi. These mills grew larger as cheap labour and plentiful water power made operations profitable, which meant that the cotton could be processed into fabric where it grew, saving transportation costs. The mills were usually combination mills (spinning and weaving), that were water powered and used a slow burn design technique. They used a belt and pulley drive system, and heavier ring frames rather than mules. At this point they only spun and wove coarse counts. The mills were mainly in open country and mill towns were formed to support them. New England mills found it increasingly difficult to compete, and as in Lancashire, went into gradual decline until bankrupted during the Great Depression. Cotton mills and their owners dominated the economy and politics of the Piedmont well into the 20th century.

====Asia====

The modern Indian mechanised textile industry was born in 1854, when a steam-powered mill was opened in Bombay by Cowasjee N. Davar. More followed: there were 10 by 1865 and 47 by 1875. By 1880 there were 58 mills in India employing 40,000 workers, with over 80% of them in the cities of Bombay and Ahmedabad. From the 1870&#x27;s India&#x27;s own markets for finished yarn and cloth ceased to be dominated by imports from Lancashire, and during the 1870&#x27;s and 1880 s the Bombay cotton industry began to replace exports of yarn from Britain to China.

===Edwardian mills (1898–1914)===
The cotton industry was subject to cycles of boom and slump, which caused waves of mill building. There was an optimism that dictated that slumps had to be endured and then there would be a period of even greater prosperity. The limited companies took control of spinning, while the room and power system was the norm for the weaving sheds. One point of view in the 1880s was that vertically integrating the weaving sheds into new mills would reduce costs and lead to greater profits. This route had been followed in New England, where it was successful, but not in Lancashire. The industry peaked in 1907. There was a severe slump in 1908, which endured until 1918, but the years 1919 and 1920 were more profitable than the peak year of 1907 had been.

====United Kingdom====

Production peaked in 1912. The First World War of 1914–1918 put the Lancashire industry into reverse. The British government, starved of raw cotton, established mills in south Asia exporting the spinning technology – which was copied, and became a low-labour cost competitor. In Germany, Flanders and Brazil, mills were built to the designs of the Oldham architects. The only new mills were very large to benefit from the economies of scale. Older mills were re-equipped with rings, and machines were powered by individual electric motors.

Mills of this period were large, their decoration was lavish reflecting Edwardian taste and prosperity. Most mills were built for mules. Kent Mill Chadderton (1908) was a five-storey, 11 bay mill, 84.6m x 43.9m. It had 90,000 spindles. Ring frames were smaller and heavier than mules so the mills were narrower with fewer storeys. Pear Mill Bredbury (1912) was planned to be a 210,000 spindle double mill. Only the first mill was completed, it had 137,000 spindles. They had more stair columns than earlier mills, it had dust flues often built into the rope race. There were two or three windows per bay. Decoration was often in terracotta and the mill name displayed in white brick on the stair tower or chimney. Stott and Sons employed Byzantine styling in Broadstone Mill, Reddish.
Specialist architects built new mills and then created extensions. The last steam-powered mill, Elk Mill, was built by Arthur Turner

Mules were built with 1,300 spindles, but were gradually replaced by rings.

The increasingly powerful engines required more boilers with economisers and superheaters. Mills needed reservoirs to supply the boilers and condense the steam. The chimneys were round and taller. Three types of engines were used: triple expansion horizontal cross compound engines, Inverted marine type compounds which were more compact, and Manhattans with vertical and horizontal cylinders such as the 3500 hp engine at New Pear Mill. Rope drives were used exclusively. Electricity was gradually introduced firstly on group drives driving a shaft (Little Mill, 1908), and then later on individual machines.

====United States====

Mills constructed in South Carolina increased in size. At Rutledge Ford the Saluda River was dammed and a power plant constructed. It was completed in 1904 before the construction of a state-of-the-art textile mill in 1906. That power plant provided for 4,800 horse power. The mill contained 30,000 spindles. By 1916 a new mill was constructed, containing 70,200 spindles and 1,300 looms. The town was named Ware Shoals. Between 1904 and 1916, the population of Ware Shoals grew from 2 men employed to maintain the newly constructed power plant, to 2,000. By the 1960s the mill employed 5,000 people. It closed in 1985, due to a surge of textile imports that caused a steep decline in the company&#x27;s output and earnings. 

===Consolidation (1918–50)===

Though business revived in 1919, a shortage of building materials restricted the building of new mills, and activity was financial with the mills seeking recapitalisation. There is no clear concession on the reason for the final decline. Some say that the cotton men concentrated on making easy money ignoring the possibility of foreign competition best countered by larger mills by re-equipping the mills with more modern ring frames. Daniels and Jewkes argued the fundamental cause of the depression was a change in demand for cotton goods. J. M. Keynes suggested that there was over capacity, and the industry should be reorganised into larger units that would scrap the excess capacity.

The Lancashire Cotton Corporation was a company set up by the Bank of England in 1929, to rescue the Lancashire spinning industry by means of consolidation. In merged 105 companies, ending up in 1950 with 53 operating mills. These were the later larger mills. It was bought up by Courtaulds in August 1964.

The later mills were on the fringe of the spinning area in Wigan and Stockport, Availability of labour was cited as a reason. The last mills were completed in 1927, these were Holden Mill (Astley Bridge Mill) and Elk Mill.

In 1929, for the first time there were more spindles in the USA than in the UK. In 1972, India had greater spindleage than the US, and it was in turn surpassed by China in 1977.

===Cotton mills in the late 20th century (1950–2000)===

====Decline of spinning in England====
Though there was a slight revival after 1945, mills closed. The most efficient mills had abandoned their steam engines, and were working the frames with individual electric motors. Broadstone Mills Stockport, was built as a double mill with 265,000 mule spindles, but by 1959 it was running 37,500 mule spindles and 70,000 ring spindles. It closed in 1959 taking advantage of the Cotton Industry Act 1959 and was then used by the John Myers mail order company. One mill was later demolished leaving the other to be used as a Shopping Outlet Centre and Craft Village.
The reduction of capacity led to a legacy of redundant mills, which were readily reused for other industrial purposes.

Ring spinning technology had successfully replaced the spinning mule, with mills having been converted mules to rings. However, in the 1970s, the depleted industry was challenged by a new technology open-end or break spinning. In 1978 Carrington Viyella opened a factory to do open-end spinning in Atherton. This was the first new textile production facility in Lancashire since 1929. Immediately Pear Mill, Stockport and Alder Mill, Leigh were closed. These were both Edwardian mills designed by Stott and Sons.
The mill built in 1978 was built on the Howe Bridge mills site and was named Unit One. It was not an open end mill but a combed cotton ring mill.

===Modern cotton mills===
Modern spinning mills are mainly built around open end spinning techniques using rotors or ring spinning techniques using spindles. In 2009 there were 202,979,000 ring spinning spindles installed worldwide, with 82% of these being in Asia or Oceania and 44% being within China. In the same year there were 7,975,000 open end spinning rotors installed, with 44% of these being within Asia or Oceania and 29% within Eastern Europe. The average age of installed rotors is much lower than that of spindles and as rotors are between 7 and 10 times more productive they are responsible for 20% of the cotton spun worldwide.

Modern cotton mills are increasingly automated. One large mill in Virginia in the United States employs 140 workers in 2013 to produce an output that would have required more than 2,000 workers in 1980.

==Locations==
Cotton mills were not confined to Lancashire but were built in northeast Cheshire, Derbyshire, Nottingham, the West Riding of Yorkshire, Bristol, Durham and the west of Scotland. The availability of streams or rivers to provide power determined the location of the early mills some of which were in isolated areas. In Lancashire they were built on the rivers and streams descending from the Pennines and Rossendale moorland. In some places quite small streams powered a string of small mills such as in the Cheesden Valley between Ramsbottom and Heywood. where 14 mills and their associated leats and ponds were concentrated along a four-mile stretch of the brook. Mills were built around Rochdale and Littleborough. North of Bury, ten mills occupied a mile long stretch of a stream in the Shuttleworth Valley. Other mills were built north of the River Ribble and a cluster of five mills in Caton near the port at Lancaster, one of which belonged to Samuel Greg who built Quarry Bank Mill at Styal in Cheshire. Not all water-powered mills were in rural areas, after 1780 mills were built in Blackburn and Burnley.

In Scotland, four cotton mills were built in Rothsay on the Isle of Bute using labour that had experience of the linen industry. By 1800 there were two water-powered mills at Gatehouse of Fleet employing 200 children and 100 adults. Robert Owen who had worked for Peter Drinkwater in Manchester, developed the mills at New Lanark built by his father-in-law, David Dale under licence from Arkwright.

==Architecture==

===Fireproof construction===

Cotton mills were huge fire risks, since cotton fibres in the air could form an explosive mixture in their gas-lit interiors. The first mills using fireproof construction were built in Shropshire and Derbyshire in the 1790s and Philips &amp; Lee&#x27;s mill built in Salford in 1801–2. Fireproofing took the form of cast iron columns and beams from which sprang jack arches that were infilled with ash or sand and covered with stone flags or floorboards. In some mills timber was also eliminated from the roof structure which was supported by cast or wrought iron trusses. Until the properties of cast iron were properly understood some mills constructed using the early technology collapsed. In Manchester extensive testing of cast iron as a structural material was carried out by Eaton Hodgkinson and William Fairbairn in the early 1820s. Fireproof construction was expensive and timber, sometimes clad in plaster or metal continued to be used throughout the 19th century. Rolled steel beams and reinforced concrete flooring was introduced in a limited way in the 1880s but not widely adopted in Lancashire mills until the 20th century.

===Other factors===
Cotton is sensitive to temperature and humidity. Heating systems used wrought iron pipes suspended at a height of to carry steam under pressure. In summer the system was barely used but in winter the boilers would be fired up two hours before the shift started to warm up the mill. As heat was applied the humidity dropped and system of humidifiers, either atomisers which played an air jet against a jet of water or ones that injected a stream/air mixture into the room.

Early fire fighting systems used sprinklers supplied by water captured on flat roofs in shallow tanks. Later mills had a water tank at the top of the stair tower. Water for the sprinklers had to be protected from freezing and evaporation. Water pressure needed to be above 7 psi, and the header tank at least above the highest sprinkler. The provision of light, water tanks and heating system defined the structure and shape of the mill.

==Machinery==

===Power===

The earliest cotton mills were driven by water, so needed to be situated on fast flowing streams. From about 1820, the stationary steam engine became the normal form of power for a cotton mill, water was still needed to produce the steam and to condense it, to maintain the humidity, for many of the finishing processes and for firefighting. Water was extracted from rivers and canals, then later mills requiring ever more water, built and maintained their own reservoirs.
In 1781 James Watt marketed a rotary-motion steam engine that could be adapted to drive all sorts of machinery, Richard Arkwright pioneered its use in his cotton mills. Possibly the first steam engine to be used in a cotton mill was a Newcomen engine which was used at Shudehill Mill in 1783 to raise water between storage ponds so it could drive a water wheel. By 1795 most similar engines around Manchester had been replaced by Boulton and Watt or Bateman and Sherratt engines.

Electricity was introduced in 1877. Steam engines drove generators to provide electric lighting. By the 1890s this was common. Electricity was used to drive the mills machinery by 1906. It was generated in the engine house, and one group-drive electric motor was placed on each floor to drive the shafts. Generators were placed exterior to the mill as it was thought that they were a fire risk. Mains driven mills started about 1907. Later mills used individual electric motors to power the machinery.

===Transmission ===

The early mills had a vertical shaft to take the power from the flywheel. On each floor horizontal shafts engaged with the main shaft using bevel gearing. American mills used thick leather belts instead of shafts. A new approach was to use thick cotton ropes. A rope drum was attached to the flywheel with a channel cut for each rope. The profile was such to give maximum adherence.

===Spinning===
A spinning mill opened raw cotton bales and cleaned the cotton in the blowing room. The cotton staples are carded into lap and straightened and drawn into roving which is spun using either a mule or ring frame. The yarn can be doubled and processed into thread, or prepared for weaving.

Minerva Mill, Ashton-under-Lyne was designed by P. S. Stott and equipped by John Hetherington and Son, it produced 40&#x27;s twists and 65 wefts. It was typical of a mill of the 1890s.
 

Self acting mule frame (Roberts 1830) was an improvement on Crompton&#x27;s Mule (1779) which derived from earlier inventions. Mules were used in the 19th century mills for the finest counts, these needed skilled workers to operate them.

Ring frame (1929) developed out of the Throstle frame (19th century) an improvement on the Arkwright&#x27;s Water frame. Originally rings were only suitable for coarse counts, they were lower and heavier than mules so needed stronger floors but lower rooms. Over time, rings became suitable for finer counts and because of cheaper labour costs they replaced mules. By 1950 all mills had converted to the Ring frame. The Hawk mill in Shaw near Oldham was still operating cotton mule frames in 1964/65.
===Weaving===
A weaving mill needed yarn suitable for the warp and the weft. The warp had to delivered on the beam, or was wound on the beam from cheeses by a beamer. To obtain the extra strength needed, the yarn was sized on a sizer. The weft was wound onto the pirns for the shuttle on a pirner. These preparatory processes completed the yarn was woven on a loom. One weaver would operate 4 or six looms. A self-acting loom would stop when any thread broke, and the thread had to be retied or pieced. The process required greater levels of light than spinning, and weaving sheds would often be single storey, with overhead north facing lights. Placing a loom onto the ground also reduced the problems caused by the vibrations of operation.

The Cartwright&#x27;s powerloom (1785) was made reliable by Robert&#x27;s cast iron power loom (1822) and became perfected by the Kenworthy and Bullough Lancashire Loom (1854). The Northrop or Draper Loom (1895) replaced these older designs.

==Labour conditions==

The mills were notable in employing women, giving them an independent income. In Lancashire and Piedmont, South Carolina child labour is well documented.

===Child labour in the United Kingdom===
The Lancashire and Derbyshire mills needed a pool of cheap labour. Pauper children were boys and girls between the ages of 7 and 21, who were dependent on the Poor Law guardians. Mill owners made contracts with the guardians in London and the southern counties to supply them paupers, in batches of 50 or more, to be apprenticed. Living condition were poor in &#x27;Prentice Houses&#x27;, and the children who were paid 2d a day worked 15-hour shifts, hot bedding with children on the other shift.

Robert Owen was a millowner in New Lanark. He never employed children under the age of ten, and opposed physical punishment in schools and factories. He lobbied for parliamentary action, resulting in the Health and Morals of Apprentices Act 1802.

:* Hours of work limited to twelve a day
:* Boys and girls to sleep in separate dormitories with no more than two to each bed
:* Compulsory education to be provided in the arts of reading writing and arithmetic
:* Each apprentice to be provided with two suits of clothes
:* On Sunday children to be instructed in Christian worship
:* Sanitation to be improved

Regulation was ineffective until the mills were subject to inspection in 1833 with the establishment of a factory inspectorate consisting of four factory inspectors who had the power of magistrates. This did not reduce the number of children, half-timers worked mornings in the mill and spend the afternoon in the school room. While the number of children working in spinning as tenters did decline, more were employed in weaving because weavers were expected to tenter extra looms.

From the Factories Act 1844, until 1878 records do not distinguish between full-time and half-times.
In 1851 a sizeable number of children were working the mills. For Example, In Glossop, there were 931 children (out of 3562) between 5 and thirteen working in cotton mills. In one mill in 1859, 50.2% of the workforce were women, 24.2% were girls, 19% were men and 6.6% were boys.

===Child labor in the United States===

The Carolinas mills developed from 1880, and would employ children in preference to adults. At Newton Mill, North Carolina, in 1909, twenty of the 150 workers observed, appeared to be twelve years old or less. As well as the usual report of hands and fingers getting severed by the machinery and insufferable heat, the dust inhaled caused a fatal condition known as brown lung. Laws were rarely enforced, and the presence of small children in the factory was explained away to the inspectors saying they were visiting the mill to bring meals to their parents (meal totters), or helping but not on the payroll (helpers). Wages were good for the workers who could earn $2 a day in the mill against $0.75 on a farm. In the segregated south, &#x27;Blacks&#x27; were not allowed to work inside a mill; had they been the need for child labour would have been eliminated. Child labour stopped here not only because of new laws but the change in the type of machinery caused by the Great Depression, which required greater height and skill.

===Women===
In 1926 when it was at its peak, the Lancashire cotton industry worked 57.3 million spindles and 767,500 looms. It imported 3.3 million bales and exported 80% of its production. 61% of the 575,000 cotton operatives in Lancashire were women, of which 61% were unionised in 167 different unions

===Unions===
The 18th-century woollen industry of small producers in southern England was far different from the Yorkshire-based worsted industry where the clothier imported and owned the raw material and sold the cloth. He put out work to small weavers, in effect, employing them. Worsted was more capital intensive. The small weavers banded together to form self-help guilds. When Lancashire adopted cotton, the same process occurred. But in Lancashire cotton mills, spinning became a male occupation, and the tradition of unions passed into the factory. As spinners were &#x27;assisted&#x27; by several &#x27;piecers&#x27; there was a pool of trained labour to replace any spinner the owner cared to dismiss. The well paid mule spinners were the &#x27;barefoot aristocrats&#x27; of labour and became organised in the 19th century. They paid union dues, and were well placed to finance themselves should a strike be needed. The Yorkshire worsted industry, adopted the ring frame which required less skill. Worsted spinning was an occupation for young girls. Unionism did not develop in Yorkshire until 1914. In, 1913 figures show 50% of cotton operatives were unionised while only 10% of wool and worsted workers.

In Lancashire there were:

The spinners union, the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners had a federal structure with strong central leadership where control was in the hands of a small group of paid officials. Their dues were high, so the fighting fund was large and the officials were skilled in defending the complex wage structures.

==Health of the workers==
A cotton mill was not a healthy place to work. The air in the mill had to be hot and humid to prevent the thread from breaking: 18 °C to 26 °C and 85% humidity was normal. The air in the mill was thick with cotton dust, which could lead to byssinosis – a lung disease.

Protective masks were introduced after the war, but few workers wore them as they made them uncomfortable in the stifling conditions. The same applied to ear protectors. The air led to skin infections, eye infections, bronchitis and tuberculosis. The noise levels in a weaving shop, where the shuttles in 500 plus looms were being thumped 200 times a minute led to levels of deafness in all who worked there. The lubrication was carcinogenic and led to cancers of the mouth and cancer of the scrotum; known as mule-spinners cancer.

A mill worker could expect to work a thirteen-hour day, six days a week with two weeks off for the wakes week holidays in summer. Unsurprisingly, a series of Factory Acts were passed to attempt to ameliorate these conditions.

In the early days when the cotton towns were expanding rapidly, living conditions for the workers were poor. Badly planned housing was seriously overcrowded. Open sewers and shared privies led to diseases such as cholera; Manchester was hit by an epidemic in 1831 that claimed hundreds of lives.

<text>Sir Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield ( ; 28 August 1919 – 12 August 2004) was a British electrical engineer who shared the 1979 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Allan MacLeod Cormack for his part in developing the diagnostic technique of X-ray computed tomography (CT).

His name is immortalised in the Hounsfield scale, a quantitative measure of radiodensity used in evaluating CT scans. The scale is defined in Hounsfield units (symbol HU), running from air at −1000 HU, through water at 0 HU, and up to dense cortical bone at +1000 HU and more.

==Early life==
Hounsfield was born in Sutton-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, England on 28 August 1919. He was the youngest of five children (he has two brothers and two sisters). His father, Thomas Hounsfield was a farmer from Beighton, and was linked to the prominent Hounsfield and Newbold families of Hackenthorpe Hall, his mother was Blanche Dilcock.

As a child he was fascinated by the electrical gadgets and machinery found all over his parents&#x27; farm. Between the ages of eleven and eighteen, he tinkered with his own electrical recording machines, launched himself off haystacks with his own home-made glider, and almost killed himself by using water-filled tar barrels and acetylene to see how high they could be waterjet propelled. He attended the Magnus Grammar School in Newark-on-Trent, but was not academic.

== Military service and education ==
Shortly before World War II, he joined the Royal Air Force as a volunteer reservist where he learned the basics of electronics and radar. After the war, he attended Faraday House Electrical Engineering College in London, graduating with the DFH (Diploma of Faraday House). Before the advent of most university engineering departments, Faraday House was a specialist Electrical Engineering college that provided university level education that combined practical experience with theoretical study.

==Career==
In 1949, Hounsfield began work at EMI, Ltd. in Hayes, Middlesex, where he researched guided weapon systems and radar. Hounsfield incorrectly gave this date as 1951 when he wrote his autobiography which is available on the Nobel Prize website. The correct date is 10 October 1949 as stated in a biography of Hounsfield. At EMI, he became interested in computers and in 1958, he helped design the first commercially available all-transistor computer made in Great Britain: the EMIDEC 1100. Shortly afterwards, he began work on the CT scanner at EMI. He continued to improve CT scanning, introducing a whole-body scanner in 1975, and was senior researcher (and after his retirement in 1984, consultant) to the laboratories.

While on an outing in the country, Hounsfield came up with the idea that one could determine what was inside a box by taking X-ray readings at all angles around the object. He then set to work constructing a computer that could take input from X-rays at various angles to create an image of the object in &quot;slices&quot;. Applying this idea to the medical field led him to propose what is now known as computed tomography. At the time, Hounsfield was not aware of the work that Cormack had done on the theoretical mathematics for such a device. Hounsfield built a prototype head scanner and tested it first on a preserved human brain, then on a fresh cow brain from a butcher’s shop, and later on himself. On 1 October 1971, CT scanning was introduced into medical practice with a successful scan on a cerebral cyst patient at Atkinson Morley Hospital in Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom. In 1975, Hounsfield built a whole-body scanner. The principles of computed tomography developed by Hounsfield remain in use today (2022). 

==Awards and honours==
In 1979, Hounsfield and Cormack received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Hounsfield received numerous awards in addition to the Nobel Prize. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1976 and knighted in 1981.

In 1974, he received the Wilhelm Exner Medal. Hounsfield was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1975. In 1976, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was awarded the Howard N. Potts Medal in 1977. In 1994 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

The Hounsfield Facility for 3-D CT imaging at the University of Nottingham, opened in 2014, was named after him. It was designed to apply CT scanning to biomaterials, especially within soil, and thus to the exploring the environment.

==Personal life and death==
Hounsfield enjoyed hiking and skiing. He had resolved to develop what came to be CT scanning while on a country ramble.

He retired from EMI in 1986 and used the prize money from his Nobel to build a personal laboratory in his home. Hounsfield died at Kingston upon Thames, Greater London, in 2004, at the age of 84.

<text>The Kemijoki or Kemi River (, ), with its length, is the longest river in Finland. It runs south through the towns of Kemijärvi and Rovaniemi before reaching the Gulf of Bothnia at Kemi.

At Rovaniemi the Ounasjoki river merges with the Kemijoki.

The first hydroelectric plant on the Kemijoki was constructed in 1949 at Isohaara. A total of 15 power plants have been constructed so far. The plants are owned by Kemijoki Oy and Pohjolan Voima Oy. In 2003, the plants produced a total of 4.3 TWh, which was about 34.5% of Finland&#x27;s total hydroelectric production.

<text>Peter Darvill-Evans (born 1954) is an English writer and editor.

==Early life==
He was born and lived in Buckinghamshire until he went to university, graduating in 1975 from University College, London with a degree in History.

==Career==
In 1976 Darvill-Evans joined the staff of Games Centre, a specialist games shop in London. He became the manager of a branch of the shop, then manager of wholesale sales, selling board games and eventually role-playing games.

In 1979 he became employed by Games Workshop, becoming first its Trade Sales Manager, then General Manager, responsible for purchases, sales, distribution and magazine publishing. When Games Workshop relocated to Nottingham, Darvill-Evans left the company, preferring to stay in London. He then wrote his first of three Fighting Fantasy gamebooks for Puffin Books.

In 1989, he became a junior editor at W. H. Allen Ltd, initially overseeing the Target Books imprint. He also oversaw the Nexus imprint of erotic fiction for men, redesigning its logo and cover style as well as changing its editorial direction.

Target&#x27;s main output was novelisations of the popular science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and when Darvill-Evans arrived he immediately realised that there were very few &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories left to novelise. This problem was exacerbated by the cancellation of the television series at the end of 1989. When WH Allen sold the Nexus and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; lines to Virgin Publishing, Darvill-Evans went with them. Deciding to go freelance, he was made redundant at his own request, and entered negotiations with the BBC to license Virgin to produce full-length, original novels carrying on the story of the series from the point where the television programme had left off.

Launched in 1991, this successful line of novels were known as the &quot;New Adventures&quot;. Darvill-Evans set down guidelines for the writers, and even wrote one novel himself, Deceit. Other output from the Virgin fiction department during his time there included another series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels (the &quot;Missing Adventures&quot;, featuring previous Doctors and companions); a series of novels following the character of Bernice Summerfield; the &quot;Virgin Worlds&quot; imprint of new mainstream science-fiction and fantasy novels. Non-science fiction lines included Black Lace, the first mainstream erotic fiction imprint targeted at women; the Crime and Passion imprint; Idol, a homoerotic fiction imprint for men; and Sapphire, a lesbian erotica line.

Other successes included media-tie in books such as the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; Programme Guide, which served as the template for guides about other cult television series, and a series of novelisations based on the Jimmy McGovern-scripted series &quot;Cracker&quot; starring Robbie Coltrane.

By 1997, however, Virgin Publishing decided to emphasise more non-fiction books by and about celebrities. Their &quot;Doctor Who&quot; licence renewal negotiations fell in 1996, a year in which the BBC was seeking to bring all the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; licences back in house. Consequently, Virgin&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; licence was not renewed and instead the BBC opted to launch their own series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels. In 1998, Darvill-Evans managed among other projects the editing and production of Virgin&#x27;s Guide to British Universities, and personally supervised the copy-editing and proofreading of Richard Branson&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Losing My Virginity&quot;.

Virgin closed its fiction department in 1999, with Darvill-Evans departing the company and moving to Southampton. He continued to freelance, writing several &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels for BBC Books, amongst various other editing and writing work.

In 2001 he began working for the Inland Revenue, subsequently renamed HM Revenue and Customs, and became an Inspector of Taxes.

Working full time for HMRC has left little time for writing, but Darvill-Evans has maintained his interest in the worlds of cult fiction, in particular Doctor Who and Fighting Fantasy. He has contributed to the following:
* 2005 - a contributory interviewee for a documentary about author Terrance Dicks included in the BBC&#x27;s remastered DVD edition of the Doctor Who TV series &quot;The Horror of Fang Rock&quot;
* 2007 - short story &quot;Home&quot; published in the book &quot;Bernice Summerfield - Missing Adventures&quot;, published by Big Finish Productions and edited by Rebecca Levene

Published by Telos Publishing, ISBN 978-1-84583-185-1.
* 2022 - panel guest at a commemorative event for the Doctor Who author Terrance Dicks.
* 2022 - contributed text and photographs to &quot;Dice Men: The Origin Story Of Games Workshop&quot; by Ian Livingstone, published by Unbound, ISBN 978-1-80018-052-9.
* 2023 - panellist and speaker at Novel Experiences, a gathering of authors and readers of the Doctor Who New Adventures.
* 2024 - the main contributing interviewee for the DVD documentary &quot;Novel Experiences - the Virgin Books Adventures&quot;, published by Reeltime Pictures; appointed to the committee of the Southampton Archaeological Society.

Having retired from HMRC at the end of March 2022, Darvill-Evans has resumed writing - very slowly. In November 2022 and March 2023 he performed his first (and so far only) solo gigs as a singer/guitarist.

<doc id="885369" wikidata="Q1442604" url="?curid=885369" title="Vehicle registration plates of Japan">
<text>In Japan, the national government issues [[vehicle registration plate]]s for motor vehicles through the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Land Transportation Offices nationwide. However, the local municipality rather than the national government registers certain vehicles with small engine displacements.

The number on the top line is a vehicle class code which begins with a 0 through 9 to indicate specific vehicle classification. This is signified by the length, width and height of the vehicle as well as engine displacement. Broadly speaking, passenger automobiles with engine displacements at or smaller than 2000 cc receive 5-series plates, while passenger automobiles with engine displacements larger than or more receive 3-series license plates.


Official vehicles of the Imperial household are exempt from the requirement to display such plates. Official vehicles of the Self-Defense Forces and the foreign diplomats are required to display other plates.
The plates are installed on both the front and rear of the vehicle, with the rear plate permanently attached to the vehicle with a prefecture seal completely covering one of the attaching plate bolts. The plate is only removed when the vehicle is sold secondhand to someone from a different prefecture, has reached the end of service and has been sold for scrap, or exported. New vehicles are not delivered to the purchaser until the plates have been attached at the dealership.

Since November 1, 1970, a &quot;jikō-shiki&quot; (字光式) plate has been offered for private vehicles at the owner&#x27;s request. The green characters on this type of plate are replaced with molded green plastic that can be illuminated from behind the plate. From May 19, 1998, specific numbers can also be requested if the numbers are not already in use. From 2010, these are also available in blue version of vehicle registration plates started in 1973.

The international vehicle registration code for Japan is J.

==Appearance==
Ordinary private vehicles have white plates with green text, while commercial vehicles have green plates with white text.

Lightweight private vehicles (kei cars) have yellow plates with black text, while lightweight commercial vehicles have black plates with yellow text.

Private, two-wheeled vehicles with engine displacements exceeding 250 cc have white plates with green text;

commercial two-wheeled vehicles with engine displacements exceeding 2000 cc have green plates with white text.

Private, lightweight two-wheeled vehicles with engine displacements of 250 cc or less have white plates with green text;

commercial, lightweight two-wheeled vehicles with engine displacements of 250 cc or less have green plates with white text.
* These plates are issued by municipal governments.

Until 31 December 1974, kei cars had small green and white license plates. After this date, they received medium plates, now in black and yellow to distinguish them from regular cars.

The illustration shows what a plate might look like. The top line contains the name of the issuing office (Tama, shown, is in Tokyo) and a vehicle class code. The bottom line contains a hiragana character and a four-digit serial number divided into two groups of two digits separated by a hyphen. Any leading zeroes are replaced by centered dots.

White plates can have the following hiragana (bold indicates rental vehicle characters):

さすせそたちつてとなにぬねのはひふほまみむめもやゆよらりるろれわ

Green plates can have the following hiragana:

あいうえかきくけこを

Some characters, including ones with a dakuten or a handakuten, be used on any plates, including the yellow and black ones:

おばだがぱざびぢぎぴしじぶづぐぷずへべでげペぜぼどごぽぞゑゐん

A license plate in Japan thus follows this format: KK?*H##-## (e.g., 足立500き21-41), where KK is the name of the issuing office in kanji, H is a hiragana, ? is a 5 for vehicles less than 2000 cc and a 3 for vehicles greater than 2000 cc (other numbers are less common—1 for large trucks, 2 for buses, etc.), * is a number from 0 to 99 (pre-1971 license plates will omit this), and # is a number from 0* to 9 (*leading zeroes are replaced by centered dots).

===Special use plates===

Vehicles owned by personnel with the United States military in Japan under the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) have a &quot;Y&quot; on white plates, or an &quot;A&quot; on yellow plates, where the hiragana character is normally displayed. Earlier versions of the SOFA license plate displayed the letters &quot;K&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot; and &quot;E&quot;. These letters indicated the car was imported into Japan under SOFA and was left-hand drive. Today, cars with an &quot;E&quot; indicate that Japanese sales tax has not been paid and the vehicle will not remain in Japan when the military member departs. Since the 1980s, military commands have discouraged servicemembers assigned to Japan from shipping their vehicles from the U.S. into the country, so this is rarely seen. Military members who retire in Japan use the hiragana &quot;よ&quot;. Many opt to purchase second-hand domestic vehicles through used car dealers off-base, and from other servicemembers departing Japan at on-base &quot;lemon lots&quot;.

The official imperial cars have a special number plate with the kanji 皇 and a one-digit number below.

===Out of country plates===


Because the Japanese writing system, particularly the &quot;kana&quot;, is unique to Japan, standard-issue Japanese license plates are considered unacceptable for international travel. If motorists wish to take their vehicles abroad with them, the Ministry of Transport will issue them with plates with the hiragana and kanji scripts replaced by Roman letters. The hiragana prefix is replaced by a Kunrei-shiki romanization of that character. The kanji prefecture/office code is replaced by a two- or three-letter abbreviation, the first two letters representing the prefecture, the third (if present) representing the office within the prefecture. All the numerical portions of the plate remain the same.

Using the example given above, the plate (足立50Kき21-41) would then read TKA 50K 21-41 (TKA for Tokyo Adachi).

== Vehicle class code system ==

In addition to plate size and color, Japanese plates since 1962 have identified the vehicle type (signified by length, width and height as well as engine displacement) by use of a &quot;vehicle class code&quot; signified by a number on the top line of the plate for all vehicles with three or more wheels. 
The vehicle class code system is not widely understood outside of Japan, and as a result, Japanese vehicles displaying &quot;vanity&quot; Japanese license plates at overseas shows and events are often unwittingly misrepresented.

Motorbikes and other two wheeled vehicles do not use this system.

In 1967, double digit vehicle codes were introduced for the first time, once all previous possible combinations were used. For example, 3 would become 33, and then 34, 35, etc. This began in October 1967 in the more populous prefectures initially for the most common vehicle classes such as 3 and 5. In April 1971 all vehicle codes become double digit across the country. Double digit codes finally stopped being issued in 1999.

By the early 1970s, three wheeled passenger cars were no longer in production and some prefectures began to issue the double digit codes 77, 78 and 79 as an &#x27;overflow series&#x27; for passenger cars 2000cc and under. This practice stopped in 1999.

By May 1998, some prefectures were beginning to run out of all possible combinations of double digit vehicle codes for the most common classes (notably 599 and 799) and began issuing triple digit vehicle codes.

==Transportation offices and markings==
In 2006, several new location names, known as numbers, were approved by the MLIT for places that wanted to increase their recognition for purposes such as tourism. Criteria included the need for 100,000 vehicles in the area and the avoidance of an imbalance in the prefecture. The new locations began appearing in 2006 on plates for vehicles registered in certain specific cities, towns and villages in or near the places marked below in green.

<doc id="885370" wikidata="Q938529" url="?curid=885370" title="Nicomachus of Thebes">
<text>Nicomachus of Thebes (; fl. 4th century BC) was an ancient Greek painter, a native of Thebes, and a contemporary of the great painters of the Classical period. He trained under his father Aristides, also a painter.

Pliny gives a list of his works; among them a &quot;Rape of Proserpina&quot;, &quot;Victory in a Quadriga&quot;, &quot;Apollo and Diana&quot;, and &quot;Cybele seated on a Lion&quot;. Many of his works were taken to Rome. Pliny tells us that he was a very rapid worker and claims that he was one of the painters who used only four colors. Plutarch mentions his paintings as possessing the Homeric merit of ease and absence of effort. Cicero equally praises his works. Vitruvius observes that if his fame was less than his contemporaries, it was the fault of fortune rather than a lack of talent.

Nicomachus was taught by his father, Aristodemus, who was also a painter. Among Nicomachus&#x27;s students were his young brother Ariston, his son Aristides of Thebes, and Philoxenus of Eretria.

== List of works ==

* &quot;Rape of Proserpina&quot; (located in the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, in the cella of Minerva)
* &quot;Victory in a Quadriga&quot; (located in the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus)
* &quot;Ulysses&quot;
* &quot;Apollo and Diana&quot;
* &quot;Cybele seated on a Lion&quot;

Having to import most of its foodstuffs, being positioned along important trade routes, and having to cater for the resident foreign powers who ruled the islands opened Maltese cuisine to outside influences. The traditional Maltese stewed rabbit (&quot;stuffat tal-fenek&quot;) is often identified as the national dish.

==History==

Malta&#x27;s history and geography had an important influence on its cuisine. Having to import most of its foodstuffs, being positioned along important trade routes, and having to cater for the resident foreign powers who ruled the islands, opened Maltese cuisine to outside influences from very early on. Foreign dishes and tastes were absorbed, transformed and adapted. Italian (specifically Sicilian), Middle Eastern and Arabic foods exerted a strong influence, but the presence in Malta of the Knights of St John and, more recently, the British brought elements from further afield.

The Knights hailed from many European countries, particularly France, Italy and Spain. They brought influences from these countries. &quot;Aljotta&quot;, for example, a fish broth with plenty of garlic, herbs, and tomatoes, is the Maltese adaptation of bouillabaisse. The Knights&#x27; contacts and wealth brought also food from the New World; it has been suggested that Malta may have been one of the first countries in Europe (after Spain) where chocolate was first tasted.

The British military presence meant a market of a garrison and their families and, later, mass tourism from the UK. British food products, condiments and sauces like English mustard, Bovril, HP Sauce and Worcestershire sauce are still a subtle but pervasive presence in Maltese cooking. Other imports were only nominal. The Maltese word &quot;aljoli&quot; is one of the variations on aioli across the Mediterranean; the Maltese version of the sauce is based on herbs, olives, anchovies and olive oil. Similarly, while the Maltese word &quot;taġen&quot; is related to &quot;tajine&quot;, in Maltese the word refers exclusively to a metal frying pan.

==Cuisine and identity==


There are a number of junctures in which development in Maltese cuisine related to issues of identity. The most significant example is the traditional Maltese &quot;stuffat tal-fenek&quot; (rabbit stew), often identified as the national dish, quite possibly started off as a form of symbolic resistance to the hunting restrictions imposed by the Knights of St John. The dish was to become popular after the lifting of restrictions in the late 18th century (and by which time the indigenous breed, the Tax-Xiber rabbit, had multiplied and prices dropped) and the domestication of rabbits, a technique which could have been imported from France thanks to the French Knights.

The popularity of pork and its presence in various dishes could be attributed to Malta being on the edge of the Christian world. Consuming a food which is prohibited in the Muslim culinary culture could have been a way of self-identification by distinguishing oneself from the other. In addition to pork dishes (such as grilled pork cuts or stuffed flank) and the exclusive predominance of pork in indigenous Maltese sausages, adding some pork to dishes such as &quot;kawlata&quot; (a vegetable soup) and &quot;ross il-forn&quot; (baked rice) has been common practice in the Maltese vernacular cuisine for centuries.

For the Café Europe event held during the Austrian Presidency of the EU in 2006 the &quot;representative&quot; Maltese pastry chosen was the &quot;maqrut&quot;.

==Variations==

===Regional===

Despite Malta&#x27;s small size there are some regional variations. This is especially the case with Gozo. This is evidenced in some names such as the Gozitan cheeselet (&quot;ġbejna t&#x27;Għawdex&quot;) and &quot;ftira Għawdxija&quot;, flatbread topped or filled with potatoes or ġbejniet with eggs, grated cheese, tomatoes, anchovies, olives, ricotta and Maltese sausage as other possible ingredients.

Other Gozitan variants include the use of ingredients. Gozitan cheeselets, for example, are used as filling for ravioli instead of the usual ricotta.

===Seasonal===

The strongest seasonal variations are seen in desserts and sweets. &quot;Prinjolata&quot;, &quot;kwareżimal&quot;, &quot;karamelli tal-ħarrub&quot;, &quot;ftira tar-Randan&quot;, &quot;figolla&quot; and &quot;qagħaq tal-għasel&quot; are all examples of sweets associated with a particular season.

Because Catholic fasting during Lent involved mostly meats and dairy products, fish such as Lampuki were a popular dish during this period as were stewed snails (), stuffed artichokes () and fritters () of ġbejna, vegetables or fish (particularly whitebait and salted cod).

During the Holy Week bakers also bake a large bagel typically studded with some almonds on top called &quot;qagħqa tal-appostli&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot; apostles&#x27; bagel). Usually coinciding with the spring, there are also seasonal variations to certain dishes at the time of Lent as in, for example, adding fresh broad beans to dishes such as &quot;kusksu&quot; (a vegetable and pasta dish).

During the month of November &quot;għadam tal-mejtin&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot; bones of the dead, in ) are prepared. These are a layer of marzipan sandwiched between sweet pastry and topped with white icing (normal icing and not buttercream icing).

Qaghaq tal-Ghasel, in English, honey rings, are a traditional Maltese sweet. They consist of a pastry with a stuffing of sorts inside, made into a ring shape, with slits along the ring for the filling to dark filling to ooze out. The filling is traditionally a mixture of honey, molasses, aniseed, cinnamon and cloves; however, some people add cocoa powder for a hint of chocolate. Although traditionally made for Christmas, it became so popular that people started making it all year round, and nowadays many are unaware that it was originally made for Christmas. The cake has a meaning behind it too. The fact that it is a ring means &quot;eternal happiness&quot; and because the filling oozes out, the phrase continues as &quot;overflowing with goodness&quot;.

<text>The Vasco da Gama Bridge () is a cable-stayed bridge flanked by viaducts that spans the Tagus River in Parque das Nações in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal.

It is the second longest bridge in Europe, after the Crimean Bridge, and the longest one in the European Union. It was built to alleviate the congestion on Lisbon&#x27;s 25 de Abril Bridge, and eliminate the need for traffic between the country&#x27;s northern and southern regions to pass through the capital city.

Construction began in February 1995; the bridge was opened to traffic on 29 March 1998, just in time for Expo 98, the World&#x27;s Fair that celebrated the 500th anniversary of the discovery by Vasco da Gama of the sea route from Europe to India.

Along with the 25 de Abril Bridge, the Vasco da Gama is one of two bridges that span the Tagus River in Lisbon.

==Description==

The bridge carries six road lanes, with a speed limit of , the same as that on motorways, except on one section which is limited to . On windy, rainy, and foggy days, the speed limit is reduced to . The number of road lanes will be enlarged to eight when traffic reaches a daily average of 52,000.

;Bridge and access road sections
#North access roads: 
#North viaduct: 
#Expo viaduct: ; 12 sections
#Main bridge: main span: ; side spans: each (total length: ); cement pillars: -high; free height for navigation in high tides: ;
#Central viaduct: ; 80 pre-fabricated sections -long; 81 pillars up to -deep; height from to 
#South viaduct: ; sections; 84 sections; 85 pillars
#South access roads: ; includes the toll plaza (18 gates) and two service areas

==Construction and cost==
The $1.1 billion project was split into four parts, each built by a different company, and supervised by an independent consortium. There were up to 3,300 workers simultaneously on the project, which took 18 months of preparation and 18 months of construction. The financing is via a build-operate-transfer system by Lusoponte, a private consortium that receives the first 40 years of tolls for both Lisbon bridges. Lusoponte&#x27;s capital is 50.4% from Portuguese companies, 24.8% from French, and 24.8% from British.

The bridge has a life expectancy of 120 years, having been designed to withstand wind speeds of and hold up to an earthquake 4.5 times greater than the standards of building resistance in Lisbon. The deepest foundation piles, up to in diameter, were driven down to under mean sea level. Environmental pressure throughout the project resulted in the left-bank viaducts being extended inland to preserve the marshes underneath, as well as the lamp posts throughout the bridge being tilted inwards so as not to cast light on the river below.

==Toll==
Northbound traffic (to Lisbon) is charged a toll while travelling southbound is free. Tolls are collected through a toll plaza located on the south bank of Tagus, near Montijo. As of 2024, bridge tolls range from €3.20 (passenger cars) to €13.55 (trucks).

<doc id="885375" wikidata="Q765814" url="?curid=885375" title="Lost-wax casting">
<text>Lost-wax castingalso called [[investment casting]], precision casting, or cire perdue (; borrowed from French)is the process by which a duplicate sculpture (often a metal, such as silver, gold, brass, or bronze) is cast from an original sculpture. Intricate works can be achieved by this method.

The oldest known examples of this technique are approximately 6,500 years old (4550–4450 BC) and attributed to gold artefacts found at Bulgaria&#x27;s Varna Necropolis. A copper amulet from Mehrgarh, Indus Valley civilization, in present-day Pakistan, is dated to circa 4,000 BC. Cast copper objects, found in the Nahal Mishmar hoard in southern Israel, which belong to the Chalcolithic period (4500–3500 BC), are estimated, from carbon-14 dating, to date to circa 3500 BC. Other examples from somewhat later periods are from Mesopotamia in the third millennium BC. Lost-wax casting was widespread in Europe until the 18th century, when a piece-moulding process came to predominate.

The steps used in casting small bronze sculptures are fairly standardized, though the process today varies from foundry to foundry (in modern industrial use, the process is called investment casting). Variations of the process include: &quot;lost mould&quot;, which recognizes that materials other than wax can be used (such as tallow, resin, tar, and textile); and &quot;waste wax process&quot; (or &quot;waste mould casting&quot;), because the mould is destroyed to remove the cast item.

==Process==
Casts can be made of the wax model itself, the direct method, or of a wax copy of a model that need not be of wax, the indirect method. These are the steps for the indirect process (the direct method starts at step 7):

#Model-making. An artist or mould-maker creates an original model from wax, clay, or another material. Wax and oil-based clay are often preferred because these materials retain their softness.
#Mouldmaking. A mould is made of the original model or sculpture. The rigid outer moulds contain the softer inner mould, which is the exact negative of the original model. Inner moulds are usually made of latex, polyurethane rubber or silicone, which is supported by the outer mould. The outer mould can be made from plaster, but can also be made of fiberglass or other materials. Most moulds are made of at least two pieces, and a shim with keys is placed between the parts during construction so that the mould can be put back together accurately. If there are long, thin pieces extending out of the model, they are often cut off of the original and moulded separately. Sometimes many moulds are needed to recreate the original model, especially for large models.
#Wax. Once the mould is finished, molten wax is poured into it and swished around until an even coating, usually about 3 mm ( inch) thick, covers the inner surface of the mould. This is repeated until the desired thickness is reached. Another method is to fill the entire mould with molten wax and let it cool until a desired thickness has set on the surface of the mould. After this the rest of the wax is poured out again, the mould is turned upside down and the wax layer is left to cool and harden. With this method it is more difficult to control the overall thickness of the wax layer.
#Removal of wax. This hollow wax copy of the original model is removed from the mould. The model-maker may reuse the mould to make multiple copies, limited only by the durability of the mould.
#Chasing. Each hollow wax copy is then &quot;chased&quot;: a heated metal tool is used to rub out the marks that show the parting line or flashing where the pieces of the mould came together. The wax is dressed to hide any imperfections. The wax now looks like the finished piece. Wax pieces that were moulded separately can now be heated and attached; foundries often use registration marks to indicate exactly where they go.
#Spruing. The wax copy is sprued with a treelike structure of wax that will eventually provide paths for the molten casting material to flow and for air to escape. The carefully planned spruing usually begins at the top with a wax &quot;cup,&quot; which is attached by wax cylinders to various points on the wax copy. The spruing does not have to be hollow, as it will be melted out later in the process.
#Slurry. A sprued wax copy is dipped into a slurry of silica, then into a sand-like stucco, or dry crystalline silica of a controlled grain size. The slurry and grit combination is called ceramic shell mould material, although it is not literally made of ceramic. This shell is allowed to dry, and the process is repeated until at least a half-inch coating covers the entire piece. The bigger the piece, the thicker the shell needs to be. Only the inside of the cup is not coated, and the cup&#x27;s flat top serves as the base upon which the piece stands during this process. The core is also filled with fire-proof material. 
#Burnout. The ceramic shell-coated piece is placed cup-down in a kiln, whose heat hardens the silica coatings into a shell, and the wax melts and runs out. The melted wax can be recovered and reused, although it is often simply burned up. Now all that remains of the original artwork is the negative space formerly occupied by the wax, inside the hardened ceramic shell. The feeder, vent tubes and cup are also now hollow.
#Testing. The ceramic shell is allowed to cool, then is tested to see if water will flow freely through the feeder and vent tubes. Cracks or leaks can be patched with thick refractory paste. To test the thickness, holes can be drilled into the shell, then patched.
#Pouring. The shell is reheated in the kiln to harden the patches and remove all traces of moisture, then placed cup-upward into a tub filled with sand. Metal is melted in a crucible in a furnace, then poured carefully into the shell. The shell has to be hot because otherwise the temperature difference would shatter it. The filled shells are then allowed to cool.
#Release. The shell is hammered or sand-blasted away, releasing the rough casting. The sprues, which are also faithfully recreated in metal, are cut off, the material to be reused in another casting.
#Metal-chasing. Just as the wax copies were chased, the casting is worked until the telltale signs of the casting process are removed, so that the casting now looks like the original model. Pits left by air bubbles in the casting and the stubs of the spruing are filed down and polished.

Prior to silica-based casting moulds, these moulds were made of a variety of other fire-proof materials, the most common being plaster based, with added grout, and clay based. Prior to rubber moulds gelatine was used.

== Jewellery and small parts ==
The methods used for small parts and jewellery vary somewhat from those used for sculpture. A wax model is obtained either from injection into a rubber mould or by being custom-made by carving. The wax or waxes are sprued and fused onto a rubber base, called a &quot;sprue base&quot;. Then a metal flask, which resembles a short length of steel pipe that ranges roughly from 3.5 to 15 centimeters tall and wide, is put over the sprue base and the waxes. Most sprue bases have a circular rim which grips the standard-sized flask, holding it in place. Investment (refractory plaster) is mixed and poured into the flask, filling it. It hardens, then is burned out as outlined above. Casting is usually done straight from the kiln either by centrifugal casting or vacuum casting.

The lost-wax process can be used with any material that can burn, melt, or evaporate to leave a mould cavity. Some automobile manufacturers use a lost-foam technique to make engine blocks. The model is made of polystyrene foam, which is placed into a casting flask, consisting of a cope and drag, which is then filled with casting sand. The foam supports the sand, allowing shapes that would be impossible if the process had to rely on the sand alone. The metal is poured in, vaporizing the foam with its heat.

In dentistry, gold crowns, inlays and onlays are made by the lost-wax technique. Application of Lost Wax technique for the fabrication of cast inlay was first reported by Taggart. A typical gold alloy is about 60% gold and 28% silver with copper and other metals making up the rest. Careful attention to tooth preparation, impression taking and laboratory technique are required to make this type of restoration a success. Dental laboratories make other items this way as well.

==Textiles==
In this process, the wax and the textile are both replaced by the metal during the casting process, whereby the fabric reinforcement allows for a thinner model, and thus reduces the amount of metal expended in the mould. Evidence of this process is seen by the textile relief on the reverse side of objects and is sometimes referred to as &quot;lost-wax, lost textile&quot;. This textile relief is visible on gold ornaments from burial mounds in southern Siberia of the ancient horse riding tribes, such as the distinctive group of openwork gold plaques housed in the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg. The technique may have its origins in the Far East, as indicated by the few Han examples, and the bronze buckle and gold plaques found at the cemetery at Xigou. Such a technique may also have been used to manufacture some Viking Age oval brooches, indicated by numerous examples with fabric imprints such as those of Castletown (Scotland).

==Glass sculptures==

The lost-wax casting process may also be used in the production of cast glass sculptures. The original sculpture is made from wax. The sculpture is then covered with mold material (e.g., plaster), except for the bottom of the mold which must remain open. When the mold has hardened, the encased sculpture is removed by applying heat to the bottom of the mold. This melts out the wax (the wax is &#x27;lost&#x27;) and destroys the original sculpture. The mold is then placed in a kiln upside down with a funnel-like cup on top that holds small chunks of glass. When the kiln is brought up to temperature (1450-1530 degrees Fahrenheit), the glass chunks melt and flow down into the mold. Annealing time is usually 3–5 days, and total kiln time is 5 or more days. After the mold is removed from the kiln, the mold material is removed to reveal the sculpture inside.

==Archaeological history==

===Black Sea===

Cast gold knucklebones, beads, and bracelets, found in graves at Bulgaria&#x27;s Varna Necropolis, have been dated to approximately 6500 years BP. They are believed to be both some of the oldest known manufactured golden objects, and the oldest objects known to have been made using lost wax casting.

===Middle East===

Some of the oldest known examples of the lost-wax technique are the objects discovered in the Nahal Mishmar hoard in southern Land of Israel, and which belong to the Chalcolithic period (4500–3500 BC). Conservative Carbon-14 estimates date the items to around 3700 BC, making them more than 5700 years old.

===Near East===
In Mesopotamia, from –2750 BC, the lost-wax technique was used for small-scale, and then later large-scale copper and bronze statues. One of the earliest surviving lost-wax castings is a small lion pendant from Uruk IV. Sumerian metalworkers were practicing lost-wax casting from approximately –3200 BC. Much later examples from northeastern Mesopotamia/Anatolia include the Great Tumulus at Gordion (late 8th century BC), as well as other types of Urartian cauldron attachments.

===South Asia===

The oldest known example of applying the lost-wax technique to copper casting comes from a 6,000-year-old () copper, wheel-shaped amulet found at Mehrgarh, Pakistan.

Metal casting, by the Indus Valley civilization, produced some of the earliest known examples of lost-wax casting applied to the casting of copper alloys, a bronze figurine, found at Mohenjo-daro, and named the &quot;dancing girl&quot;, is dated to 2300-1750 . Other examples include the buffalo, bull and dog found at Mohenjodaro and Harappa, two copper figures found at the Harappan site Lothal in the district of Ahmedabad of Gujarat, and likely a covered cart with wheels missing and a complete cart with a driver found at Chanhudaro.

During the post-Harappan period, hoards of copper and bronze implements made by the lost-wax process are known from Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. Gold and copper ornaments, apparently Hellenistic in style, made by &quot;cire perdue&quot; were found at the ruins at Sirkap. One example of this Indo-Greek art dates to the the juvenile figure of Harpocrates excavated at Taxila. Bronze icons were produced during the 3rd and 4th centuries, such as the Buddha image at Amaravati, and the images of Rama and Kartikeya in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. A further two bronze images of Parsvanatha and a small hollow-cast bull came from Sahribahlol, Gandhara, and a standing Tirthankara () from Chausa in Bihar should be mentioned here as well. Other notable bronze figures and images have been found in Rupar, Mathura (in Uttar Pradesh) and Brahmapura, Maharashtra.
Gupta and post-Gupta period bronze figures have been recovered from the following sites: Saranath, Mirpur-Khas (in Pakistan), Sirpur (District of Raipur), Balaighat (near Mahasthan now in Bangladesh), Akota (near Vadodara, Gujarat), Vasantagadh, Chhatarhi, Barmer and Chambi (in Rajesthan). The bronze casting technique and making of bronze images of traditional icons reached a high stage of development in South India during the medieval period. Although bronze images were modelled and cast during the Pallava Period in the eighth and ninth centuries, some of the most beautiful and exquisite statues were produced during the Chola Period in Tamil Nadu from the tenth to the twelfth century. The technique and art of fashioning bronze images is still skillfully practised in South India, particularly in Kumbakonam. The distinguished patron during the tenth century was the widowed Chola queen, Sembiyan Maha Devi. Chola bronzes are the most soughtafter collectors’ items by art lovers all over the world. The technique was used throughout India, as well as in the neighbouring countries Nepal, Tibet, Ceylon, Burma and Siam.

===Southeast Asia===

The inhabitants of Ban Na Di were casting bronze from to 200 AD, using the lost-wax technique to manufacture bangles. Bangles made by the lost-wax process are characteristic of northeast Thailand. Some of the bangles from Ban Na Di revealed a dark grey substance between the central clay core and the metal, which on analysis was identified as an unrefined form of insect wax. It is likely that decorative items, like bracelets and rings, were made by &quot;cire perdue&quot; at Non Nok Tha and Ban Chiang. There are technological and material parallels between northeast Thailand and Vietnam concerning the lost-wax technique. The sites exhibiting artifacts made by the lost-mould process in Vietnam, such as the Dong Son drums, come from the Dong Son, and Phung Nguyen cultures, such as one sickle and the figure of a seated individual from Go Mun (near Phung Nguyen, the Bac Bo Region), dating to the Go Mun phase (end of the General B period, up until the 7th century BC).

===West Africa===
Cast bronzes are known to have been produced in Africa by the 9th century AD in Igboland (Igbo-Ukwu) in Nigeria, the 12th century AD in Yorubaland (Ife) and the 15th century AD in the kingdom of Benin. Some portrait heads remain.
Benin mastered bronze during the 16th century, produced portraiture and reliefs in the metal using the lost wax process.

===Egypt===
The Egyptians were practicing &quot;cire perdue&quot; from the mid 3rd millennium BC, shown by Early Dynastic bracelets and gold jewellery. Inserted spouts for ewers (copper water vessels) from the Fourth Dynasty (Old Kingdom) were made by the lost-wax method. Hollow castings, such as the Louvre statuette from the Fayum find appeared during the Middle Kingdom, followed by solid cast statuettes (like the squatting, nursing mother, in Brooklyn) of the Second Intermediate/Early New Kingdom. The hollow casting of statues is represented in the New Kingdom by the kneeling statue of Tuthmosis IV (British Museum, London) and the head fragment of Ramesses V (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). Hollow castings become more detailed and continue into the Eighteenth Dynasty, shown by the black bronze kneeling figure of Tutankhamun (Museum of the University of Pennsylvania). &quot;Cire Perdue&quot; is used in mass-production during the Late Period to Graeco-Roman times when figures of deities were cast for personal devotion and votive temple offerings. Nude female-shaped handles on bronze mirrors were cast by the lost-wax process.

===Mediterranean===
The lost-wax technique came to be known in the Mediterranean during the Bronze Age. It was a major metalworking technique utilized in the ancient Mediterranean world, notably during the Classical period of Greece for large-scale bronze statuary and in the Roman world.
Direct imitations and local derivations of Oriental, Syro-Palestinian and Cypriot figurines are found in Late Bronze Age Sardinia, with a local production of figurines from the 11th to 10th century BC. The cremation graves (mainly 8th-7th centuries BC, but continuing until the beginning of the 4th century) from the necropolis of Paularo (Italian Oriental Alps) contained fibulae, pendants and other copper-based objects that were made by the lost-wax process. Etruscan examples, such as the bronze anthropomorphic handle from the Bocchi collection (National Archaeological Museum of Adria), dating back to the 6th to 5th centuries BC, were made by &quot;cire perdue&quot;. Most of the handles in the Bocchi collection, as well as some bronze vessels found in Adria (Rovigo, Italy) were made using the lost-wax technique. The better known lost-wax produced items from the classical world include the &quot;Praying Boy&quot; (in the Berlin Museum), the statue of Hera from Vulci (Etruria), which, like most statues, was cast in several parts which were then joined. Geometric bronzes such as the four copper horses of San Marco (Venice, probably 2nd century) are other prime examples of statues cast in many parts.
Examples of works made using the lost-wax casting process in Ancient Greece largely are unavailable due to the common practice in later periods of melting down pieces to reuse their materials. Much of the evidence for these products come from shipwrecks. As underwater archaeology became feasible, artifacts lost to the sea became more accessible. Statues like the Artemision Bronze Zeus or Poseidon (found near Cape Artemision), as well as the Victorious Youth (found near Fano), are two such examples of Greek lost-wax bronze statuary that were discovered underwater.

Some Late Bronze Age sites in Cyprus have produced cast bronze figures of humans and animals. One example is the male figure found at Enkomi. Three objects from Cyprus (held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York) were cast by the lost-wax technique from the 13th and 12th centuries BC, namely, the amphorae rim, the rod tripod, and the cast tripod. 

Other, earlier examples that show this assembly of lost-wax cast pieces include the bronze head of the Chatsworth Apollo and the bronze head of Aphrodite from Satala (Turkey) from the British Museum.

===East Asia===

There is great variability in the use of the lost-wax method in East Asia. The casting method to make bronzes till the early phase of Eastern Zhou (770-256 ) was almost invariably section-mold process. Starting from around 600 , there was an unmistakable rise of lost-wax casting in the central plains of China, first witnessed in the Chu cultural sphere.
Further investigations have revealed this not to be the case as it is clear that the piece-mould casting method was the principal technique used to manufacture bronze vessels in China. The lost-wax technique did not appear in northern China until the 6th century BC. Lost-wax casting is known as &quot;rōgata&quot; in Japanese, and dates back to the Yayoi period, . The most famous piece made by &quot;cire perdue&quot; is the bronze image of Buddha in the temple of the Todaiji monastery at Nara. It was made in sections between 743 and 749, allegedly using seven tons of wax.

===Northern Europe===

The Dunaverney (1050–910 BC) and Little Thetford (1000–701 BC) flesh-hooks have been shown to be made using a lost-wax process. The Little Thetford flesh-hook, in particular, employed distinctly inventive construction methods. The intricate Gloucester Candlestick (1104–1113 AD) was made as a single-piece wax model, then given a complex system of gates and vents before being invested in a mould.

===Americas===
The lost-wax casting tradition was developed by the peoples of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, northwest Venezuela, Andean America, and the western portion of South America. Lost-wax casting produced some of the region&#x27;s typical gold wire and delicate wire ornament, such as fine ear ornaments. The process was employed in prehispanic times in Colombia&#x27;s Muisca and Sinú cultural areas. Two lost-wax moulds, one complete and one partially broken, were found in a shaft and chamber tomb in the vereda of Pueblo Tapado in the municipio of Montenegro (Department of Quindío), dated roughly to the pre-Columbian period. The lost-wax method did not appear in Mexico until the 10th century, and was thereafter used in western Mexico to make a wide range of bell forms.

==Literary history==

=== Indirect evidence ===
Some early literary works allude to lost-wax casting. Columella, a Roman writer of the 1st century AD, mentions the processing of wax from beehives in &quot;De Re Rustica&quot;, perhaps for casting, as does Pliny the Elder, who details a sophisticated procedure for making Punic wax. One Greek inscription refers to the payment of craftsmen for their work on the Erechtheum in Athens (408/7–407/6 BC). Clay-modellers may use clay moulds to make terracotta negatives for casting or to produce wax positives. Pliny portrays as a well-reputed ancient artist producing bronze statues, and describes Lysistratos of Sikyon, who takes plaster casts from living faces to create wax casts using the indirect process.

Many bronze statues or parts of statues in antiquity were cast using the lost wax process. Theodorus of Samos is commonly associated with bronze casting. Pliny also mentions the use of lead, which is known to help molten bronze flow into all areas and parts of complex moulds. Quintilian documents the casting of statues in parts, whose moulds may have been produced by the lost wax process. Scenes on the early-5th century BC Berlin Foundry Cup depict the creation of bronze statuary working, probably by the indirect method of lost-wax casting.

=== Direct evidence ===

====India====
The lost-wax method is well documented in ancient Indian literary sources. The &quot;Shilpa Shastras&quot;, a text from the Gupta Period (–550 AD), contains detailed information about casting images in metal. The 5th-century AD &quot;Vishnusamhita&quot;, an appendix to the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, refers directly to the modeling of wax for making metal objects in chapter XIV: &quot;if an image is to be made of metal, it must first be made of wax.&quot; Chapter 68 of the ancient Sanskrit text &quot;Mānasāra Silpa&quot; details casting idols in wax and is entitled &quot;Maduchchhista Vidhānam&quot;, or the &quot;lost wax method&quot;. The 12th century text &quot;Mānasollāsa&quot;, allegedly written by King Someshvara III of the Western Chalukya Empire, also provides detail about lost-wax and other casting processes.

In a 16th-century treatise, the &quot;Uttarabhaga&quot; of the Śilparatna written by Srïkumāra, verses 32 to 52 of Chapter 2 (&quot;Linga Lakshanam&quot;), give detailed instructions on making a hollow casting.

====Theophilus====
An early medieval writer Theophilus Presbyter, believed to be the Benedictine monk and metalworker Roger of Helmarshausen, wrote a treatise in the early-to-mid-12th century that includes original work and copied information from other sources, such as the &quot;Mappae clavicula&quot; and Eraclius, &quot;De dolorous et artibus Romanorum&quot;. It provides step-by-step procedures for making various articles, some by lost-wax casting: &quot;The Copper Wind Chest and Its Conductor&quot; (Chapter 84); &quot;Tin Cruets&quot; (Chapter 88), and &quot;Casting Bells&quot; (Chapter 85), which call for using &quot;tallow&quot; instead of wax; and &quot;The Cast Censer&quot;. In Chapters 86 and 87 Theophilus details how to divide the wax into differing ratios before moulding and casting to achieve accurately tuned small musical bells. The 16th-century Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini may have used Theophilus&#x27; writings when he cast his bronze &quot;Perseus with the Head of Medusa&quot;.

====America====
The Spanish writer Releigh (1596) in brief account refers to Aztec casting.

<text>The flying shuttle is a type of weaving shuttle. It was a pivotal advancement in the mechanisation of weaving during the initial stages of the Industrial Revolution, and facilitated the weaving of considerably broader fabrics, enabling the production of wider textiles. Moreover, its mechanical implementation paved the way for the introduction of automatic machine looms.

The brainchild of John Kay, the flying shuttle received a patent in the year 1733 during the Industrial Revolution. Its implementation brought about an acceleration of the previously manual weaving process and resulted in a significant reduction in the required labour force. Formerly, a broad-cloth loom necessitated the presence of a weaver on each side, but with the advent of the flying shuttle, a solitary operator could handle the task proficiently. Prior to this breakthrough, the textile industry relied upon the coordination of four spinners to support a single weaver.

The widespread adoption of the flying shuttle by the 1750s dramatically exacerbated this labour imbalance, marking a notable shift in textile production dynamics.

==History==
The history of this device is difficult to accurately ascertain due to poor documentation at the time. Nonetheless, there are two general schools of thought around this: first those that believe that it appears to have been invented in the region of Languedoc of southern France (one year before its introduction in England), but was destroyed by state cloth inspectors of the rent-seeking Ancien Regime; second, those that believe it simply originated where it was industrialized, that is in England.

==Operation==

In a typical frame loom, as used previous to the invention of the flying shuttle, the operator sat with the newly woven cloth before them, using treadles or some other mechanism to raise and lower the heddles, which opened the shed in the warp threads. They then had to reach forward while holding the shuttle in one hand and pass this through the shed; the shuttle carried a bobbin for the weft. The shuttle then had to be caught in the other hand, the shed closed, and the beater pulled in against the fell to push the weft into place. This action (called a &quot;pick&quot;) required regularly bending forward over the fabric. 

More importantly, the coordination between the throwing and catching of the shuttle required that the weaver was weaving narrow cloth (typically or less). If the loom was for weaving broad cloth multiple weavers were needed: one on the left side at the shed, and one on the right side at the shed (and sometimes, one to operate the treadles). These two reached across the loom, passing the shuttle back and forth through the shed.

The flying shuttle employs a smooth board, called the &quot;race,&quot; which runs, side to side, along the front of the beater, forming a track on which the shuttle runs. The lower threads of the shed rest on the track and the shuttle slides over them. At each end of the race, there is a box which catches the shuttle at the end of its journey, and which contains a mechanism for propelling the shuttle on its return trip (which may be yanked into action by the cord from the handheld picking-stick, or fully automated) 

The shuttle itself has some subtle differences from the older form, especially for automated and powered looms. The ends of the shuttle are often bullet-shaped and metal-capped, and the shuttle generally has rollers to reduce friction. The weft thread is made to exit from the end rather than the side, and the thread is stored on a pirn (a long, conical, one-ended, non-turning bobbin) to allow it to feed more easily. Finally, the flying shuttle is generally somewhat heavier, so as to have sufficient momentum to carry it all the way through the shed.


==Social effects==
The increase in production due to the flying shuttle exceeded the capacity of the spinning industry of the day and prompted the development of powered spinning machines. Beginning with the spinning jenny and the waterframe until ultimately culminating in the spinning mule, which could produce strong, fine thread in the quantities needed these innovations transformed the textile industry in Great Britain. The innovation was seen as a threat to the livelihood of spinners &amp; weavers, which resulted in an uprising that had Kay&#x27;s patent largely ignored. It is often incorrectly written that Kay was attacked and fled to France, but in fact he simply moved there to attempt to rent out his looms, a business model that had failed him in England.

The flying shuttle produced a new source of injuries to the weaving process; if deflected from its path, it could be shot clear of the machine, potentially striking and injuring workers. Turn-of-the-century injury reports abound with instances in which eyes were lost or other injuries sustained and, in several instances (for example, an extended exchange in 1901), the British House of Commons was moved to take up the issue of installing guards and other contrivances to reduce these injuries.

==Obsolescence==

The flying shuttle dominated commercial weaving through the middle of the twentieth century. However, by that time, other systems had begun to replace it. The heavy shuttle was noisy and energy-inefficient (since the energy used to throw it was largely lost in the catching); also, its inertia limited the speed of the loom. Projectile and rapier looms eliminated the need to take the bobbin/pirn of thread through the shed; later, air- and water-jet looms reduced the weight of moving parts further. Flying shuttle looms are still used for some purposes, and old models remain in use.

<doc id="885382" wikidata="Q444789" url="?curid=885382" title="Acoustic mirror">
<text>An acoustic mirror is a passive device used to reflect and focus (concentrate) sound waves. Parabolic acoustic mirrors are widely used in parabolic microphones to pick up sound from great distances, employed in surveillance and reporting of outdoor sporting events. Pairs of large parabolic acoustic mirrors which function as &quot;whisper galleries&quot; are displayed in science museums to demonstrate sound focusing.

Between the World Wars, before the invention of radar, parabolic sound mirrors were used experimentally as early-warning devices by military air defence forces to detect incoming enemy aircraft by listening for the sound of their engines. 

During World War II on the coast of southern England, a network of large concrete acoustic mirrors was in the process of being built when the project was cancelled owing to the development of the Chain Home radar system. Some of these mirrors are still standing today.

== Acoustic aircraft detection ==

Before World War II and the invention of radar, acoustic mirrors were built as early warning devices around the coasts of Great Britain, with the aim of detecting incoming enemy aircraft by the sound of their engines. The most famous of these devices still stand at Denge on the Dungeness peninsula and at Hythe in Kent. Other examples exist in other parts of Britain (including Sunderland, Redcar, Boulby, Kilnsea and Selsey Bill), and Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq in Malta. The Maltese sound mirror is known locally as &quot;the ear&quot; (il-Widna).

The Dungeness mirrors, known colloquially as the &quot;listening ears&quot;, consist of three large concrete reflectors built in the 1920s–1930s. Their experimental nature can be discerned by the different shapes of each of the three reflectors: one is a long curved wall about high by long, while the other two are dish-shaped constructions approximately in diameter. Microphones placed at the foci of the reflectors enabled a listener to detect the sound of aircraft far out over the English Channel. The reflectors are not parabolic, but are actually spherical mirrors. 
Spherical mirrors can be used for direction finding by moving the sensor rather than the mirror; another unusual example was the Arecibo Observatory.

Acoustic mirrors had a limited effectiveness, and the increasing speed of aircraft in the 1930s meant that they would already be too close to engage by the time they had been detected. The development of radar put an end to further experimentation with the technique. Nevertheless, there were long-lasting benefits. The acoustic mirror programme, led by Dr William Sansome Tucker, had given Britain the methodology to use interconnected stations to pinpoint the position of an enemy in the sky. 

The system they developed for linking the stations and plotting aircraft movements was given to the early radar team and contributed to their success in World War II.

==Modern uses==
Parabolic acoustic mirrors called &quot;whisper dishes&quot; are used as participatory exhibits in science museums to demonstrate focusing of sound. Examples are located at Bristol&#x27;s We The Curious, Ontario Science Centre, Albuquerque&#x27;s ¡Explora!, Baltimore&#x27;s Maryland Science Center, Oklahoma City&#x27;s Science Museum Oklahoma, San Francisco&#x27;s Exploratorium, the Science Museum of Minnesota, the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Pacific Science Center in Seattle, Jodrell Bank Observatory, St. Louis Science Center, Parkes Observatory in Australia and on the north campus lawn of North Carolina State University. 

A pair of dishes, typically in diameter, is installed facing each other, separated by around a hundred metres (yards). A person standing at the focus of one can hear another person speaking in a whisper at the focus of the other, despite the wide separation between them.

Parabolic microphones depend on a parabolic dish to reflect sound coming from a specific direction into the microphone placed at the focus. They are extremely directional: sensitive to sounds coming from a specific direction. However, they generally have poor bass response because a dish small enough to be portable cannot focus long wavelengths (= low frequencies). 

Small portable parabolic microphones are used to record wildlife sounds such as bird song, in televised sports events to pick up the conversations of players, such as in the huddle during American Football games, or to record the sounds of the sport, and in audio surveillance to record speech without the knowledge of the speaker.

<text>The Yakovlev Yak-36, also known as &quot;Izdeliye V&quot;, (NATO reporting name &quot;Freehand&quot;) is a Soviet technology demonstrator for a VTOL combat aircraft.

==Design and development==
From 1960, the Yakovlev Design Bureau began work on a VTOL system, using the compact and lightweight Tumansky RU-19-300 turbojet engine, drafting a proposal for the Yak-104, a converted Yak-30 jet trainer with two vertically mounted Ru-19 engines between the inlet ducts of the standard Yak-30 powerplant. Work on the Yak-104 was terminated in favour of an aircraft with a single lift/cruise engine with rotating nozzles, similar to the Hawker Siddeley P.1127, which was nearing completion in England. Unable to find a suitable engine or convince the government to order the development of one, the Yakovlev bureau was forced to follow a different course.

In response to a contract for the development of a single-seat V/STOL fighter in 1961, Yakovlev proposed a twin-engined aircraft with a large nose air intake, engines in the forward fuselage and swivelling exhaust nozzles, one for each engine on either side of the lower fuselage near the centre of gravity of the aircraft. The fighter version was not proceeded with but four technology demonstrators, (initially designated &quot;Izdeliye V&quot;) based on the fighter studies were ordered.

Four prototypes were completed, one of which was used only for static testing. The second was used for takeoff and landing tests, including free hovering. The third incorporated improvements found in testing, including an improved autopilot which automatically selected optimal air flow for hover stability. This prototype crashed, but was later rebuilt. The fourth prototype crashed in February 1971 and was not rebuilt.

===Construction===
The airframe had a semi-monocoque fuselage with bicycle-type landing gear, short cropped delta wings of 37° leading edge sweep, with 5° anhedral, attached to the fuselage in a mid position. The fuselage was substantial forward of the wing trailing edges, due to accommodating the engines, cockpit, fuel tanks and equipment bays as close to the centre of gravity as possible, tapering sharply to the swept tail surfaces with a high-set tailplane. Control of the aircraft was by conventional rudder, ailerons and elevators in normal flight and by compressed engine bleed air blown from control nozzles at the wingtips, rear fuselage tip and at the end of a long boom extending forwards from the top lip of the air intakes.

Two underwing hard points could carry bombs, podded machine guns or rocket pods, but the Yak-36 had insufficient excess thrust and range for effective use as a combat aircraft.

==Operational history==
The first tethered hover flight took place on 9 January 1963. There were initial problems with hot gas reingestion where hot exhaust gasses are sucked back into the intakes causing poor airflow through the engines and loss of thrust. The suction effect of the exhaust on the ground (which made a higher engine power needed) and problems with control systems caused further difficulties. After modifications, the first untethered vertical flight was made on 23 June 1963, followed by the first full transition to horizontal flight on 16 September 1963.

On 24 March 1966, the first complete flight was made from vertical takeoff transition to horizontal flight deceleration to vertical flight and vertical landing. After much testing and practice the first public presentation of the Yak-36 was made on 9 July 1967 at an air show at Moscow-Domodedovo airport, marking the 50th Anniversary of the October Revolution. After the promising results obtained from the flight test programme of the Yak-36, the next development step was the Yakovlev Yak-36M which flew for the first time on 27 September 1970.

<text>Jenny Eugenia Nyström (13 or 15 June 1854 in Kalmar, Sweden – 17 January 1946 in Stockholm) was a painter and illustrator mainly known as the creator of the Swedish image of the &quot;jultomte&quot; on Christmas cards and magazine covers, thus linking the Swedish version of Santa Claus to the gnomes and tomtar of Scandinavian folklore.

== Background ==
Her father was a school teacher and piano teacher, and also the cantor of the Kalmar Castle Church. When Jenny Nyström was eight years old, the family moved to Gothenburg, where her father had found a better paying teaching job.

She studied at the &quot;Kjellbergska flickskolan&quot;. In 1865 she started in the Gothenburg art school Göteborgs Musei-, Rit- och Målarskola, today known as Konsthögskolan Valand, and in 1873 she was admitted to the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm, where she studied for eight years. Thanks to a scholarship, this was followed by studies in Paris 1882–1886, at Académie Colarossi and Académie Julian.

==Career==
While in Paris, Nyström discovered the booming postcard market, and tried to persuade the Swedish publishing house Bonnier to start producing postcards, but they declined. &quot;Lille Viggs äventyr på julafton&quot; (&quot;Little Vigg&#x27;s Adventures on Christmas Eve&quot;), written by the author Viktor Rydberg inspired Nyström. She made drawings accompanying this tale. Viktor Rydberg saw them and suggested the Bonniers publishing company to release the book. After they declined, publisher S. A. Hedlund released it in 1871. The short Christmas tale for all ages was widely printed and has since become a Christmas classic in Sweden. Jenny Nyström eventually became Sweden&#x27;s most productive painter and illustrator. For many years, her illustrations were distributed by Strålin &amp; Persson AB in Falun.

In 1887, at the age of 33, she married medical student Daniel Stoopendaal (1853-1927), brother of fellow artists Henrik Wilhelm Johan Stoopendaal (1846 - 1906), Ferdinand Jacob Stoopendaal (1850-), and Georg Vilhelm Stoopendaal (1866-1953). Due to tuberculosis Daniel was never able to finish his studies and take up his intended profession. It was instead up to Jenny to support herself, her husband and their son through her artistry, while Daniel handled her business affairs. He died in 1927.

In 1933 her son, Curt Nyström Stoopendahl (1893-1965), followed in her footsteps and also became a popular postcard and poster artist, staying very close to his mother&#x27;s artistic style. Even his signature, &quot;Curt Nyström&quot;, looked like his mother&#x27;s. Likewise, her brother-in-law, Georg Stoopendaal, already in the beginning of the 19th century found postcards to be a good source of income, unlike his more serious paintings, and his Christmas cards are also clearly inspired by Jenny Nyström&#x27;s.

==Santa Claus and Christmas==
Nyström created the Swedish image of the &quot;jultomte&quot; on numerous Christmas cards and magazine covers, thus linking the Swedish version of Santa Claus to the gnomes of Scandinavian folklore.

<doc id="885386" wikidata="Q591865" url="?curid=885386" title="Mackensen-class battlecruiser">
<text>The class was the last class of battlecruisers to be built by Germany in World War I. The design initially called for seven ships, but three of them were redesigned as the . Of the four ships of the class, , , and were launched, and was not—but none were completed, after wartime shipbuilding priorities were redirected towards U-boats—and the ships were broken up in the early 1920s. The lead ship of the class was named for August von Mackensen, a prominent military commander during the war. In response to the -class ships, the British Royal Navy laid down the s, all but one of which would eventually be cancelled; the sole survivor, , was completed after the end of the war.

The design of the s was a much improved version of the previous . The most significant improvement was a new, more powerful gun, compared to the gun of the earlier ships. The -class ships also featured more powerful engines that gave the ships a higher top speed and a significantly greater cruising range. The design provided the basis for the subsequent class, armed with main-battery guns, after the Battle of Jutland in 1916 made the need for the larger guns clear.

== Design ==
The fourth and final Naval Law, passed in 1912, governed the building program of the German navy during World War I. The Imperial Naval Office () decided the Navy should construct one battleship and one battlecruiser every year between 1913 and 1917, with an additional unit of both types in 1913 and 1916. Design work on the new class began in 1912, with construction intended to begin in the 1914 budget year. The question about the main battery for the new battlecruisers was the most pressing; the previous was armed with guns, though some consideration had been given to redesigning the last two ships— and —with guns.

The 35 cm guns were heavier than the 30.5 cm guns, and there were problems with enlarging the new ships to accommodate the heavier armament. The Imperial dry docks were deep enough only for ships with a draft of , and simply accepting an increased displacement on the same hull as the class would entail a reduction in speed. This meant that an increase in displacement would necessitate a longer and wider hull to keep any increases in draft minimal and avoid reducing the speed. The constraints on enlarging the hull were compounded by restrictions on width imposed by the locks of the canal in Wilhelmshaven. As a result, (Grand Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz, the head of the RMA, prohibited a design displacement greater than .

The initial design was approved on 30 September 1912, though the heads of the General Navy Department— (Vice Admiral) Günther von Krosigk and (Rear Admiral) Reinhard Scheer—and the Weapons Department head, Gerhard Gerdes, had to submit any revisions they deemed were necessary. The design staff suggested using triple or even quadruple gun turrets to keep the displacement under the 30,000-ton limit. Another suggested alternative was to use six 38 cm (15 in) guns in twin turrets, one forward and two aft; Wilhelm II accepted that design on 2 May 1913, though Friedrich von Ingenohl, the commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet, preferred the 30.5 cm gun of the -class ships. As a compromise, the new battlecruisers were to be armed with eight 35 cm (13.8 inch) guns.

The question of whether the new ships should be powered entirely by oil-fired boilers was less controversial. The design staff was generally in agreement with the standard practice of using coal-fired boilers for two-thirds of the power plant, with the remainder being oil-fired boilers. Coal-fired boilers were preferred because the coal, stored in the sides of the ship, provided additional protection, particularly for the battlecruisers, which carried less armor than their battleship counterparts. The finalized design was approved on 23 May 1914.

=== General characteristics ===
The -class ships were long and had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. The ships were designed to displace on a standard load, and up to fully laden. The s″ hulls were composed of longitudinal steel frames, over which the outer hull plates were riveted. This was the same type of construction as in the preceding -class battlecruisers, and was intended to save weight compared to the traditional method of construction, which incorporated both longitudinal and transverse frames. The ships&#x27; hulls contained 18 watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 92 percent of the length of the hull. This was significantly greater than the older -class ships, which had a double bottom for only 65 percent of the length of the hull.

Experience with previous battlecruiser designs led to the adoption of a continuous upper deck, which raised the level of the deck aft. This was necessary because the aft decks of earlier designs were usually awash when steaming at high speed, even in calm seas. The ships were also equipped with a bulbous bow to reduce drag on the hull, the first time the feature was used in the German Navy. The ships as designed required a crew of 46 officers and 1,140 enlisted sailors. Service as a squadron flagship would increase that number by an additional 14 officers and 62 sailors. The vessels carried a number of small boats, including two picket boats, one barge, two launches, two cutters, and three yawls.

=== Machinery ===
The ships of the class were equipped with four sets of marine-type turbine engines, each of which drove a three-bladed screw propeller that was in diameter. The turbines mounted in were equipped with Föttinger fluid transmission, while those on the other three ships were two sets of direct-coupled turbines with geared transmissions. The ships had 24 coal-fired marine-type single ended boilers and eight oil-fired marine-type boilers. The power plants were designed to provide and 295 revolutions per minute. Maximum speed was rated at . The ships were equipped with a pair of rudders mounted side by side, as opposed to the tandem rudders used on the -class ships.

The ships&#x27; turbines were equipped with Föttinger gears, which significantly improved performance at cruising speeds and provided a corresponding increase in range of about 20 percent. The vessels were designed to store of coal and of oil in purpose-built storage spaces; the hull areas between the torpedo bulkhead and the outer wall of the ship were used to store additional fuel. Maximum fuel capacity was of coal and of oil. This was estimated to give a range of up to about at a cruising speed of . Electrical power on the vessels was provided by eight diesel generators that put out 2,320 kilowatts at 220 volts.

=== Armament ===
The s were equipped with a main battery of eight new 35 cm SK L/45 guns in four twin gun turrets. The turrets were mounted in superfiring pairs fore and aft of the main superstructure. The guns were placed in Drh LC/1914 mountings, which could elevate to 20 degrees and depress to −5 degrees. The guns were supplied with a total of 720 armor-piercing shells, or 90 per gun. The weapons were designed to fire 600 kg (1,323 lb) shells at a rate of fire of around 2.5 shots per minute. The shells were fired with a muzzle velocity of . As with other heavy German guns, these weapons used a fore propellant charge in a silk bag with a main charge in a brass case. These guns could hit targets out to a maximum distance of .

The ships&#x27; secondary battery consisted of fourteen 15 cm (5.9 in) SK L/45 quick-firing guns mounted in armored casemates along the central superstructure. Each gun was supplied with 160 rounds, and had a maximum range of , though this was later extended to . The guns had a sustained rate of fire of 7 rounds per minute. The shells were 45.3 kg (99.8 lb), and were loaded with a 13.7 kg (31.2 lb) RPC/12 propellant charge in a brass cartridge. The guns fired at a muzzle velocity of 835 meters per second (2,740 ft/s). The guns were expected to fire around 1,400 shells before they needed to be replaced.

The ships were also armed with eight 8.8 cm (3.45 in) L/45 Flak guns in single pedestal mounts. Four were arranged around the rear superfiring main battery turret and the other four around the forward conning tower. The Flak guns were emplaced in MPL C/13 mountings, which allowed depression to −10 degrees and elevation to 70 degrees. These guns fired 9 kg (19.8 lb) shells, and had an effective ceiling of at 70 degrees.

As was standard for warships of the period, the s were equipped with submerged torpedo tubes. There were five tubes: one in the bow, and two on each flank of the ship. The torpedoes were the H8 type, which were long and carried a 210 kg (463 lb) Hexanite warhead. The torpedoes had a range of when set at a speed of ; at a reduced speed of , the range increased significantly to .

=== Armor ===
The -class ships were protected with Krupp cemented steel armor, as was the standard for German warships of the period. Specific figures for the arrangement of the armor layout have not survived, but according to naval historian Erich Gröner &quot;The outfit of Krupp armour was similar to that of the [preceding] class&quot;. The figures listed here are those for the class. They had an armor belt of thickness in the central citadel of the ship, where the most important parts of the vessel were located. This included the ammunition magazines and the machinery spaces. The belt was reduced in less critical areas, to forward and aft. The belt tapered down to at the bow, though the stern was not protected by armor at all. A torpedo bulkhead ran the length of the hull, several meters behind the main belt. The main armored deck ranged in thickness from 30 mm in less important areas to in the sections that covered the more critical areas of the ship.

The forward conning tower was protected with heavy armor: the sides were 300 mm thick and the roof was . The rear conning tower was less well armored; its sides were only , and the roof was covered with of armor plate. The main battery gun turrets were also heavily armored: the turret sides were and the roofs were . The 15 cm guns had 150 mm worth of armor plating in the casemates; the guns themselves had shields to protect their crews from shell splinters.

== Construction and cancellation ==
Seven ships were originally planned in the class: , , , &quot;A&quot;/, and three other vessels. The last three ships were redesigned as the , leaving four ships to be built to the design. The first two ships were ordered on 14 August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I. was funded through the 1914 budget, while funding for came from the war budget. —ordered under the provisional name , as a replacement for the old protected cruiser —was named after (Field Marshal) August von Mackensen. The ship was laid down on 30 January 1915 at Blohm &amp; Voss in Hamburg, under construction number 240. She was launched on 21 April 1917; at the small launching ceremony, (Colonel General) Josias von Heeringen gave the speech and the ship was christened by Mackensen&#x27;s wife. Construction was halted about 15 months before she would have been completed. The British mistakenly believed the ship to have been completed, and so they included the ship on the list of vessels to be interned at Scapa Flow instead of the fleet flagship . was stricken from the German navy, according to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, on 17 November 1919. She was sold for scrap and eventually broken up in 1922 at Kiel-Nordmole.

 was named for Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, the commander of the East Asia Squadron; he was killed when his squadron was annihilated at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in 1914. was laid down on 30 November 1915 in the Schichau yards in Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland), under the provisional name , to replace the large armored cruiser that had been sunk at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915. She was launched on 15 September 1917. At the launching ceremony, Prince Heinrich gave the speech and Spee&#x27;s widow Margarete christened the ship. Construction stopped about 12 months away from completion; was the furthest along of all four ships when work was halted. She too was struck on 17 November 1919; on 28 October 1921 the unfinished hull was sold for 4.4 million Marks and broken up in Kiel-Nordmole.

, ordered as (a replacement for ) was named for one of Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s sons, Eitel Friedrich. She was laid down in 1915 at Blohm &amp; Voss under construction number 241. She was 21 months away from completion when she was launched to clear the slip on 13 March 1920 and was broken up at Hamburg in 1921. At the launching ceremony, dockyard workers named the ship , after &quot;Reichswehr&quot; Minister Gustav Noske. &quot;A&quot;/, which was to have been named for the famous German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, and ordered as a replacement for , was also laid down 1915 at the Wilhelmshaven Imperial Shipyard under construction number 25. She was about 26 months from completion when work ended. She was never launched; instead, the vessel was broken up on the slip in 1922.

Experience at the Battle of Jutland led the RMA to conclude that ships with 38 cm guns, heavier armor, and a higher top speed were necessary. The design was used as the basis for the class, which incorporated the larger guns and more armor for the main battery turrets and barbettes. More powerful engines were unavailable to compensate for the extra weight, so the designers were forced to accept a reduced speed. Nevertheless, like the s, the three ships ordered under the design were never completed. In response, the British ordered the four s, though the British designed the class under the mistaken impression that the class would be armed with guns and would be capable of . Three of the four Admiral-class ships were cancelled; only was completed after the end of the war.

The primary reason construction halted on the four ships was the shifting of construction materials and manpower from capital ships to U-boats in the last two years of the war. The RMA filed a report dated 1 February 1918 stating that capital ship construction had ground to a halt primarily for this reason. Some thought was given to convert all four of the ships into dry grain carriers after the war, but the proposals ultimately came to nothing.

<doc id="885394" wikidata="Q5153465" url="?curid=885394" title="Common Rotation">
<text>Common Rotation is an American indie folk rock band consisting of Eric Kufs, (vocals, guitar), Adam Busch (vocals, saxophone, harmonica, glockenspiel), and Jordan Katz (vocals, trumpet, banjo). The three are childhood friends from New York City and have been making music together for almost 20 years.

==History==
The band was formed by Kufs and Busch while they were in high school in East Meadow, New York in the early 1990s with two other members, and was originally known as &quot;28 Orange Street&quot;. They debuted at the Nassau County Folk Festival, and soon began performing hundreds of gigs each year throughout the northeastern United States. As 28 Orange Street, the quartet released their first album, titled &quot;Common Rotation&quot;.

The band recorded its first record as Common Rotation with the help of They Might Be Giants, who subsequently backed them on the recording and allowed them to open on their first major tour across the United States. In 2007 they toured the United Kingdom, albeit without Jordan Katz, alongside David Berkeley.

Common Rotation have self-released five full length records and &#x27;A Song A Day&#x27; for over ten years online at the website &quot;The Union Maid&quot;.

==Collaborations==
Common Rotation can be heard on Dan Bern&#x27;s two albums, &quot;Live in Los Angeles&quot; and &quot;Live in New York&quot; and provided the soundtrack to the film &quot;Drones&quot;. 
&quot;True Hollywood Romance&quot; from &quot;The ClearChannel EP&quot; is featured as theme music in Kevin Pollak&#x27;s comedy special, &quot;The Littlest Suspect&quot;.
Common Rotation recorded Twisted Sister&#x27;s, &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; with Mike Viola for the latest installment of Engine Room Recordings Guilt by Association series, Guilt by Association Vol. 3.

The band recorded &quot;Salty South&quot; with the Indigo Girls for their live record, &quot;Staring Down The Brilliant Dream&quot;.

==In other media==
Peter Stass&#x27;s documentary film &quot;How to Lose&quot; chronicled the band&#x27;s efforts to protest Clear Channel&#x27;s monopoly on the musical touring market by playing in fan&#x27;s homes from Alaska to Europe.
Amber Benson&#x27;s music video for &quot;Wasted Words&quot; follows the band while performing for the Yupik peoples in the remote fishing villages of Kotlik and Russian Mission, Alaska.

Their song &quot;Clear Channel&quot; was featured in British Indie filmmaker Evan Richards&#x27; 2006 film, &quot;In a Day.&quot;

==Personnel==
Busch is also known for his work as an actor (&quot;The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Professional, Grey&#x27;s Anatomy, House, American Dreamz&quot;).
Katz has worked with hip hop groups (De La Soul, Big Daddy Kane, Ghostface Killah, Neon Trees, Lucinda Williams, Jennifer Nettles, The Rhythm Roots Allstars).
Kufs is a singer-songwriter who has completed his first solo collection of songs, &quot;A Dust Bowl Full O&#x27; Cherries.&quot;

<text>Steve Jackson (born 20 May 1951) is a British game designer, writer, game reviewer and co-founder of UK game publisher Games Workshop.

==History==
Steve Jackson began his career in games in 1974 as a freelance journalist with &quot;Games &amp; Puzzles&quot; magazine. In early 1975, Jackson co-founded the company Games Workshop with school friends John Peake and Ian Livingstone. They started publishing with the monthly newsletter, &quot;Owl and Weasel&quot;, on which Jackson did most of the writing, and they sent copies of the first issue to subscribers of the &quot;Albion&quot; fanzine; Brian Blume, co-partner of American publisher TSR, received one of these copies and in return sent back a copy of TSR&#x27;s new game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Jackson and Livingstone felt that this game was more imaginative than any other contemporary games being produced in the UK, and so worked out an arrangement with Blume for an exclusive deal to sell &quot;D&amp;D&quot; in Europe. In late 1975, Jackson and Livingstone organized their first convention, the initial Games Day. While selling game products directly from their flat, their landlord evicted them in summer 1976 after people kept going there looking for a physical store. By 1978 the first Games Workshop store had opened, in London.

At a Games Day convention in 1980 Jackson and Livingstone met Geraldine Cooke, an editor at Penguin Books. They persuaded her to consider publication of a book about the role-playing hobby. This was originally intended to be an introductory guide, but the idea of an interactive gamebook seemed more appealing. After several months Cooke decided that this was viable and commissioned Jackson and Livingstone to develop it. In 1980, Jackson and Livingstone began to develop the concept of the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; gamebook series, the first volume of which (&quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot;) was published in 1982 by Puffin Books (a subsidiary imprint of Penguin). Jackson and Livingstone would go on to individually write many volumes each, with further authors adding even more. Steve Jackson notably wrote &quot;Sorcery!&quot;, a four-part series utilizing the same system as &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; but where &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; mainly targeted children, &quot;Steve Jackson&#x27;s Sorcery!&quot; was marketed to an older audience. Jackson and Livingstone attributed the gamebooks&#x27; popularity to their difficulty.

After the success of the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series, Jackson designed the first interactive telephone role-playing game, &quot;FIST&quot;, which was based loosely on the concepts of the gamebooks. Jackson and Livingstone sold their Games Workshop stake in 1991. In the mid-1990s Jackson spent 2.5 years as a games journalist with the &quot;London Daily Telegraph&quot;. He then set up computer games developer Lionhead Studios with Peter Molyneux. Jackson left Lionhead in 2006 when Microsoft bought the company. He is an honorary professor at Brunel University in London, where he teaches the Digital Games Theory and Design MA.

He is often mistaken for the American game designer with the same name. The American Jackson wrote three books in the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series, which adds to the confusion, especially as these books were simply credited to &quot;Steve Jackson&quot; without any acknowledgement that it was a different person.

<text>Steve Jackson (born 1953) is an American game designer whose creations include the role-playing game &quot;GURPS&quot; and the card game &quot;Munchkin&quot;.

==Education==
Steve Jackson was born in 1953, and is a 1974 graduate of Rice University, where he was a resident of Sid Richardson College. Jackson briefly attended the University of Texas School of Law, but left to start a game design career.

==Career==
===1970s: Metagaming Concepts===
While working at Metagaming Concepts, Jackson developed &quot;Monsters! Monsters!&quot; (&quot;ca.&quot; 1976) based on a design by Ken St. Andre connected to his &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; role-playing game, and &quot;Godsfire&quot; (1976), a space conquest game by Lynn Willis. Jackson got his first design for the company published as &quot;Ogre&quot; (1977), followed by &quot;G.E.V.&quot; (1978), which were both set in a futuristic universe that Jackson created.

Jackson became interested in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, but did not like the various-sized dice or the combat rules, and bemoaned the lack of tactics, so he designed &quot;Melee&quot; in response. Jackson joined the SCA to gain a better understanding of combat, but as his interest grew he started fighting in SCA live-action combat as Vargskol, the Viking-Celt. Metagaming also published his game &quot;Wizard&quot;.

Jackson realized that &quot;Melee&quot; could be expanded into a complete fantasy role-playing game, and started working on &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot; before &quot;Melee&quot; was even published. &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot; was initially scheduled for release in February 1978, but the design and development required more work than Jackson had anticipated and the game was not released until March 1980. Howard Thompson, owner of Metagaming, decided to release &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot; as four separate books instead of a more expensive boxed set, and changed his production methods so that Jackson would be unable to check the final proofs of the game. As a result of these actions, Jackson left Metagaming and founded Steve Jackson Games later that year.

===1980s: Steve Jackson Games===
His game &quot;Raid on Iran&quot; was an immediate success. Jackson bought &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; from Metagaming, and sold the rights to &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot; to Metagaming. However, Thompson sought legal action against SJG for the rights to the short wargame &quot;One-Page Bulge&quot;, and the lawsuit was settled with an agreement that was reached on November 26, 1981, leaving Jackson with the full rights to &quot;One-Page Bulge&quot;, and to &quot;Ogre&quot; and &quot;G.E.V.&quot; (whose ownership was questioned during the legal proceedings). Jackson wanted to purchase &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot; from back Thompson after Metagaming closed down in April 1983, but Thompson declined the offered price of $250,000.

Jackson designed or co-designed many of the games published by SJ Games, including minigames such as &quot;Car Wars&quot; (1981) and &quot;Illuminati&quot; (1983), &quot;Undead&quot; (1981), and a published version of an informal game played on college campuses, called &quot;&quot;. Jackson wanted to get into computer gaming software in the early 1980s, but wound up licensing the rights to Origin Systems instead, which produced games such as &quot;Autoduel&quot; (1985) and &quot;Ogre&quot; (1986).

Jackson had an idea in the middle of 1981 for designing and publishing a new detailed and realistic roleplaying system, intending it to be logical and organized well, and wanted it to adaptable for any kind of setting and play level. Jackson announced &quot;GURPS&quot; in 1983, although his time spent managing magazines delayed development of &quot;GURPS&quot; until 1984, making the combat system book &quot;Man to Man: Fantasy Combat from GURPS&quot; (1985) available for Origins 1985, and the full &quot;GURPS Basic Set&quot; appeared the next year in 1986. Sean Punch replaced Jackson in 1995 as the line editor for &quot;GURPS&quot;.

===Recent years===
Jackson also designed the strategy card games &quot;Munchkin&quot; (2001) and &quot;Ninja Burger&quot; (2003), and the dice games &quot;Zombie Dice&quot; (2010) and &quot;Cthulhu Dice&quot; (2010), as well as Zombie Dice variants &quot;Trophy Buck&quot; (2011) and &quot;Dino Hunt Dice&quot; (2013).

Jackson has exhibited his elaborate Chaos Machine at several science fiction or wargaming conventions, including the 2006 Worldcon.

On May 11, 2012, Steve Jackson&#x27;s Kickstarter funding project for the 6th Edition of his &quot;Ogre&quot; game became the highest grossing boardgame project at Kickstarter, with 5,512 backers pledging a total of $923,680. The success of the &quot;Ogre Designer&#x27;s Edition&quot; project prompted the launch of a second successful project - running from Nov 29, 2019, through Jan 6, 2020 - to help re-launch the popular &quot;Car Wars&quot; franchise as well.

===The two &quot;Steve Jacksons&quot;===
Jackson is often mistaken for Steve Jackson, a British gamebook and video game writer who co-founded Games Workshop. The confusion is exacerbated by the fact that while the UK Jackson was co-creator of the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; gamebook series, the US Jackson also wrote three books in this series (&quot;Scorpion Swamp&quot;, &quot;Demons of the Deep&quot;, and &quot;Robot Commando&quot;), and the books did not acknowledge that this was a different &#x27;Steve Jackson&#x27;.

== 1990 Secret Service incident and legal actions ==

The United States Secret Service raided the offices of Steve Jackson Games on March 1, 1990 based on suspicion of illegal hacker activity by game designer Loyd Blankenship, and seized (among other materials and media) his manuscript for &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot;; when Jackson went to Secret Service headquarters the next day to ask them to return his book drafts, the Secret Service agents told him that they believed &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot; was a &quot;handbook for computer crime&quot;, despite his protestations that it was just a game. Through the newly created civil-rights organization Electronic Frontier Foundation, SJG filed a lawsuit against the government, which went to trial in early 1993 as &quot;Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service&quot;. SJG won the lawsuit, receiving $50,000 in damages.

== Personal interests ==

Jackson is an avid collector of Lego (especially pirate-themed) sets. He has written a miniatures game that uses Pirate sets, &quot;Evil Stevie&#x27;s Pirate Game&quot;, and has run it at several conventions.

Jackson has combined his fondness for model trains and LEGO through the LEGO train community and has been an active member of several LEGO users groups including TBRR (Texas Brick Railroad) and the Texas LEGO Users Group.

==Honors==
*Jackson has received over a dozen Origins Awards. 
*In 1982, he became the youngest game designer to be inducted into the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame. 
*His role-playing game &quot;GURPS&quot; and card game &quot;Munchkin&quot; were named to the Origins Hall of Fame for 1999 and 2012 respectively.
*He was honored as a &quot;famous game designer&quot; by being featured as the king of clubs in Flying Buffalo&#x27;s 2011 Famous Game Designers Playing Card Deck.

<doc id="885410" wikidata="Q957053" url="?curid=885410" title="Caesar Cardini">
<text>Cesare Cardini (also known as Caesar Cardini and César Cardini, February 24, 1896 – November 3, 1956) was an Italian restaurateur, chef, and hotel owner who, along with his brother Alex Cardini (November 23, 1899 – December 22, 1974), is credited with creating Caesar salad at his Tijuana restaurant, Caesar&#x27;s.

==Biography==
Caesar Cardini was born as Cesare Cardini in Baveno, a &quot;comune&quot; on the shore of Lago Maggiore in Northwest Italy, and had seven siblings: Bonifacio, Annibale, Nereo, Alessandro, Carlotta, Gaudenzio and Maria. While the sisters, Bonifacio, and Annibale stayed in Italy, the other three brothers emigrated to America; Nereo opened a small hotel near the casino in Santa Cruz, California; Alessandro and Gaudenzio eventually were in the restaurant business in Mexico City. Alessandro, called Alex in the US, is reported to have been Caesar&#x27;s partner in Tijuana, Mexico. Cesare sailed as a steerage passenger on board the RMS &quot;Olympic&quot; which arrived at the Port of New York on May 1, 1913. After inspection at Ellis Island, he boarded a train bound for Montreal.

Cesare eventually returned to Italy but came back to the United States in 1919. With his partner William Brown, he ran Brown&#x27;s Restaurant in Sacramento, then moved to San Diego. At that time, he established the first of several restaurants in Tijuana, where he could avoid the restrictions of Prohibition. He married the musician Camille D. Stump on August 27, 1924, in Santa Ana, California. The couple had one daughter, Rosa Maria Cardini (1928–2003).

Cardini is credited with creating Caesar salad in 1924. Guests regularly crossed the California border to Tijuana for alcohol, not legally available in the U.S. during prohibition, and came to dine at Caesar&#x27;s restaurant. According to a 1987 interview with his daughter Rosa, on July 4, 1924, they came in such numbers that Caesar &quot;simply wasn&#x27;t prepared for that many people&quot; and he improvised by making the salad &quot;to give the dinner guests a show as well as a meal&quot;, putting together the ingredients in the middle of the dining room. It soon became fashionable among Hollywood celebrities, especially after he had moved his restaurant a few blocks to the hotel, which was built around 1929 (nowadays called Hotel Caesar&#x27;s).

After the repeal of the Volstead Act and the Mexican government&#x27;s enactment of a ban on gambling, business from tourism to Tijuana drastically fell off. Cardini quit his Mexican businesses in 1936 and moved back to San Diego to establish the &quot;Caesar Cardini Cafe&quot;. For several years, he operated &quot;Tavern Hacienda&quot; in San Diego, the &quot;Beacon Inn&quot; in Cardiff-by-the-Sea and his own &quot;Caesar Cardini Villa&quot; in Chula Vista.

The family moved to Los Angeles about 1938 and Cardini focused on the production and marketing of his salad dressing which he trademarked in 1948. He died in Good Samaritan Hospital on November 3, 1956, in Los Angeles following a stroke at his home at 8738 Bonner Drive and was buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery. His daughter took control of Caesar Cardini Foods Inc. Later, the &quot;Cardini&#x27;s&quot; brand was sold, and is now owned by the T. Marzetti specialty salad dressing company. It is still popular and offers more than a dozen varieties of the original recipe.

==Legacy==

In Tijuana, Caesar&#x27;s Restaurant and Bar on Avenida Revolución, now under Baja Med celebrity chef Javier Plascencia, serves the &quot;original Caesar&#x27;s salad&quot;.

<text>The Noble M12 is a two-door, two-seat sports car designed and engineered by English automobile manufacturer Noble Automotive with production outsourced to Hi-Tech Automotive of South Africa.

== Variants ==

The car evolved through many variations, culminating with the M400. Only 220 Noble GTO-3Rs and M400s were imported to the U.S.; they are the only Nobles to have been officially available in the American market. The U.S. production rights to the M12s and M400s were sold in February 2007 to 1G Racing from Ohio. Due to the high demand for these cars, 1G Racing (now Rossion Automotive) released its improved variation based on the M400, Rossion Q1. Salica Cars planned to build variants based on the Noble M12 but they appear to have remained a project.

Like the Noble M10, the Noble M12 is a two-door, two-seat model, originally planned both as a coupé and as a convertible but the production cars were only produced in the coupé bodystyle. All cars have been powered by modified bi-turbocharged Ford Duratec V6 engines. The M12 has a full steel roll cage, steel frame, and G.R.P. (fiberglass) composite clam shell body parts. Although looking to be track derived, the M12 is a street-legal vehicle, ready for both road and track. 

The Noble M12 GTO-3R is equipped with Garrett T25 twin-turbochargers. Weight is . Acceleration from 0- in 3.7 seconds was published in the official brochure of the M12 GTO-3R, Road &amp; Track indicated a 0- performance of 3.3 seconds, but subsequently listed it as 3.5 seconds. Top speed is listed as and lateral Gs are reported in excess of 1.2.

The Noble M400 is equipped with higher-flow, Garrett T28 twin-turbochargers. Weight is .

The Rossion Q1 has a weight of and can accelerate from 0- in 3.4 seconds (company spec).

==In popular media==
The M12 was reviewed briefly in the show Top Gear for Season 1 Episode 2, and can be driven in the Forza video game franchise.

<doc id="885422" wikidata="Q312637" url="?curid=885422" title="Curzio Malaparte">
<text>Curzio Malaparte (; born Kurt Erich Suckert; 9 June 1898 – 19 July 1957) was an Italian writer, filmmaker, war correspondent and diplomat. Malaparte is best known outside Italy due to his works &quot;Kaputt&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Skin&quot; (1949). The former is a semi-fictionalised account of the Eastern Front during the Second World War and the latter is an account focusing on morality in the immediate post-war period of Naples (it was placed on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot;).

During the 1920s, Malaparte was one of the intellectuals who supported the rise of Italian fascism and Benito Mussolini, through the magazine &quot;900&quot;. Despite this, Malaparte had a complex relationship with the National Fascist Party and was stripped of membership in 1933 for his independent streak. Arrested numerous times, he had Casa Malaparte created in Capri where he lived under house arrest. After the Second World War, he became a filmmaker and moved closer to both Togliatti&#x27;s Italian Communist Party and the Catholic Church (though once a staunch atheist), reputedly becoming a member of both before his death.

==Biography==
===Background===
Born Kurt Erich Suckert in Prato, Tuscany, Malaparte was a son of a German father, Erwin Suckert, a textile-manufacturing executive, and his Lombard wife, née Evelina Perelli. He was educated at Collegio Cicognini in Prato and at La Sapienza University of Rome. In 1918 he started his career as a journalist. Malaparte fought in the First World War, earning a captaincy in the Fifth Alpine Regiment and several decorations for valor.

His chosen surname Malaparte, which he used from 1925 onward, means &quot;evil/wrong side&quot; and is a play on Napoleon&#x27;s family name &quot;Bonaparte&quot; which means, in Italian, &quot;good side&quot;.

===National Fascist Party===
In 1922, he took part in Benito Mussolini&#x27;s March on Rome. In 1924, he founded the Roman periodical &quot;La Conquista dello Stato&quot; (&quot;The Conquest of the State&quot;, a title that would inspire Ramiro Ledesma Ramos&#x27; &quot;La Conquista del Estado&quot;). As a member of the Partito Nazionale Fascista, he founded several periodicals and contributed essays and articles to others, as well as writing numerous books, starting from the early 1920s, and directing two metropolitan newspapers.

In 1926, he founded with Massimo Bontempelli the literary quarterly &quot;900&quot;. He later became a co-editor of &quot;Fiera Letteraria&quot; (1928–31), and an editor of &quot;La Stampa&quot; in Turin. His polemical war novel-essay, &quot;Viva Caporetto!&quot; (1921), criticized corrupt Rome and the Italian upper classes as the real enemy (the book was forbidden because it offended the Royal Italian Army).

===&quot;Coup d&#x27;État: The Technique of Revolution&quot;===
In &quot;Coup d&#x27;État: The Technique of Revolution&quot;, first published in French in 1931 as &quot;Technique du coup d`Etat&quot;, Malaparte set out a study of the tactics of &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, particularly focusing on the Bolshevik Revolution and that of Italian fascism. Here he stated that &quot;the problem of the conquest and defense of the State is not a political one ... it is a technical problem&quot;, a way of knowing when and how to occupy the vital state resources: the telephone exchanges, the water reserves and the electricity generators, etc. He taught a hard lesson that a revolution can wear itself out in strategy. He emphasizes Leon Trotsky&#x27;s role in organising the October Revolution technically, while Lenin was more interested in strategy. The book emphasizes that Joseph Stalin thoroughly comprehended the technical aspects employed by Trotsky and so was able to avert Left Opposition coup attempts better than Kerensky.

For Malaparte, Mussolini&#x27;s revolutionary outlook was very much born of his time as a Marxist. On the topic of Adolf Hitler, the book was far more doubtful and critical. He considered Hitler to be a reactionary. In the same book, first published in French by Grasset, he entitled chapter VIII: &quot;A Woman: Hitler&quot;. This led to Malaparte being stripped of his National Fascist Party membership and sent to internal exile from 1933 to 1938 on the island of Lipari.

===Arrests and Casa Malaparte===
He was freed on the personal intervention of Mussolini&#x27;s son-in-law and heir apparent Galeazzo Ciano. Mussolini&#x27;s regime arrested Malaparte again in 1938, 1939, 1941, and 1943, imprisoning him in Rome&#x27;s jail Regina Coeli. During that time (1938–41) he built a house with the architect Adalberto Libera, known as the Casa Malaparte, on Capo Massullo, on the Isle of Capri. It was later used as a location in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s film &quot;Le Mépris&quot;.

Shortly after his time in jail he published books of magical realist autobiographical short stories, which culminated in the stylistic prose of &quot;Donna come me&quot; (&quot;Woman Like Me&quot;, 1940).

===Second World War and &quot;Kaputt&quot;===
His knowledge of Europe and its leaders is based upon his experience as a correspondent and in the Italian diplomatic service. In 1941 he was sent to cover the Eastern Front as a correspondent for &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;. The articles he sent back from the Ukrainian Fronts, many of which were suppressed, were collected in 1943 and brought out under the title &quot;The Volga Rises in Europe&quot;. The experience provided the basis for his two most famous books, &quot;Kaputt&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Skin&quot; (1949).

The book includes an interview with Hans Frank, Governor General. Malaparte stayed in Warsaw, a place of which he bad strong memories as a correspondent 1919-1920.

&quot;Kaputt&quot;, his novelistic account of the war, surreptitiously written at a time when the loss of the war Germany became increasingly seen to be inevitable. Malaparte&#x27;s account is marked by lyrical wording in observations, as when he encounters a detachment of Wehrmacht soldiers fleeing a Ukrainian battlefield,

In the foreword to &quot;Kaputt&quot;, Malaparte describes in detail the convoluted process of writing. He had started writing it in the autumn of 1941, while staying in the home of Roman Souchena in the Ukrainian village of Pestchianka, located near the local &quot;House of the Soviets&quot; which was requisitioned by the SS; the village was then just two miles behind the front. Souchena was an educated peasant, whose small home library included the complete works of Pushkin and Gogol. Souchena&#x27;s young wife, absorbed in &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; after a hard day&#x27;s work, reminded Malaparte of Elena and Alda, the two daughters of Benedetto Croce. The Souchena couple helped Malaparte&#x27;s writing project, he keeping the manuscript well hidden in his house against German searches and she sewing it into the lining of Malaparte&#x27;s clothing when he was expelled from the Ukrainian front because of the scandal of his articles in &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;. He continued the writing in January and February 1942, which he spent in Nazi-occupied Poland and at the Smolensk Front. From there he went to Finland, where he spent two years - during which he completed all but the final chapter of the book. Having contracted a serious illness at the Petsamo Front in Lapland, he was granted a convalescence leave in Italy. En route, the Gestapo boarded his plane at the Tempelhof Airport in Berlin and the belongings of all passengers were thoroughly searched. Fortunately, no page of &quot;Kaputt&quot; was in his luggage. Before leaving Helsinki, he had taken the precaution of entrusting the manuscript to several Helsinki-based diplomats: Count , Minister at the Spanish Legation; Prince Dina Cantemir, Secretary of the Romanian Legation; and Titu Michai, the Romanian press attaché. With the help of these diplomats, the manuscript finally reached Malaparte in Italy, where he was able to publish it.

One of the most well-known and often quoted episodes of &quot;Kaputt&quot; concerns the interview which Malaparte - as an Italian reporter, supposedly on the Axis side - had with Ante Pavelić, who headed the Croat puppet state set up by the Nazis.

Milan Kundera&#x27;s view of the &quot;Kaputt&quot; is summarized in his essay &quot;The Tragedy of Central Europe&quot;:
According to D. Moore&#x27;s editorial note, in &quot;The Skin&quot;,

The book was condemned by the Roman Catholic Church, and placed on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot;. &quot;The Skin&quot; was adapted for the cinema in 1981.

From November 1943 to March 1946 he was attached to the American High Command in Italy as an Italian Liaison Officer. Articles by Curzio Malaparte have appeared in many literary periodicals of note in France, the United Kingdom, Italy and the United States

===Film directing and later life===

After the war, Malaparte&#x27;s political sympathies veered to the left and he became a member of the Italian Communist Party. In 1947, Malaparte settled in Paris and wrote dramas without much success. His play &quot;Du Côté de chez Proust&quot; was based on the life of Marcel Proust and &quot;Das Kapital&quot; was a portrait of Karl Marx. &quot;Cristo Proibito&quot; (&quot;Forbidden Christ&quot;) was Malaparte&#x27;s moderately successful film—which he wrote, directed and scored in 1950. It won the &quot;City of Berlin&quot; special prize at the 1st Berlin International Film Festival in 1951. In the story, a war veteran returns to his village to avenge the death of his brother, shot by the Germans. It was released in the United States in 1953 as &quot;Strange Deception&quot; and voted among the five best foreign films by the National Board of Review. He also produced the variety show &quot;Sexophone&quot; and planned to cross the United States on bicycle. Just before his death, Malaparte completed the treatment of another film, &quot;Il Compagno P&quot;.

After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Malaparte became interested in the Maoist version of Communism. Malaparte visited China in 1956 to commemorate the death of the Chinese essay and fiction writer, Lu Xun. He was moved and excited by what he saw, but his journey was cut short by illness, and he was flown back to Rome. &quot;Io in Russia e in Cina&quot;, his journal of the events, was published posthumously in 1958. He willed his house in Capri to the Chinese Writers Association as a study and residence center for Chinese writers. But at the time of his death in 1957 there were no diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic, so the transfer could not take place, and the family succeeded in changing the will.

Malaparte&#x27;s final book, &quot;Maledetti toscani&quot;, his attack on middle and upper-class culture, appeared in 1956. In the collection of writings &quot;Mamma marcia&quot;, published posthumously in 1959, Malaparte writes about the youth of the post-Second World War era with homophobic tones, describing it as effeminate and tending to homosexuality and communism; the same content is expressed in the chapters &quot;The pink meat&quot; and &quot;Children of Adam&quot; of &quot;The Skin&quot;. He died in Rome from lung cancer on 19 July 1957.

=== Cultural representations of Malaparte ===
Malaparte&#x27;s colorful life has made him an object of fascination for writers. An American journalist, Percy Winner, wrote about their relationship during the fascist &quot;ventennio&quot; (twenty year period) and the Allied Occupation of Italy, in the lightly fictionalized novel, &quot;Dario&quot; (1947) (where the main character&#x27;s last name is Duvolti, or a play on &quot;two faces&quot;). In 2016, the Italian authors Rita Monaldi and Francesco Sorti published &quot;Malaparte. Morte come me&quot; (). Set on Capri in 1939, it gives a fictionalized account of a mysterious death in which Malaparte was implicated.

<text>Sanlúcar de Barrameda (), or simply Sanlúcar, is a city in the northwest of Cádiz province, part of the autonomous community of Andalucía in southern Spain. Sanlúcar is located on the left bank at the mouth of the Guadalquivir River opposite the Doñana National Park, 52 km from the provincial capital Cádiz and 119 km from Sevilla capital of the autonomous region Andalucía. Its population is 68,656 inhabitants (National Institute of Statistics 2019).

Sanlúcar has been inhabited since ancient times, and is assumed to have belonged to the realm of the Tartessian civilization. The town of San Lucar was granted to the Spanish nobleman Alonso Pérez de Guzmán in 1297.

Its strategic location made the city a starting point for the exploration, colonization and evangelization of America between the 15th and 17th centuries. Sanlúcar lost much of its strategic value after 1645 because of the disgrace of the House of Medina Sidonia, the general decline of Spain under Charles II, the relocation of the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; to the town of Cadiz in 1717, and the Lisbon earthquake of 1755.

In the 19th century the economy of the city was converted to viticulture and summer tourism. The 20th century brought destruction and political upheaval as it did elsewhere in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Sanlúcar was declared a Cultural Historical-artistic site in 1973. Since the restoration of democracy (1975–1982) its town council has borrowed heavily, making Sanlúcar the city with the lowest per capita income in Spain.

Currently (2010) Sanlúcar is a summer tourist destination famous for its cuisine, especially manzanilla (a variety of fino sherry) and prawns. It is internationally renowned for beach horse racing and flamenco music. Less well known but equally important are the historical archives of the House of Medina Sidonia &quot;(Archivo de la Casa de Medina Sidonia)&quot;; the major part of the patrimony of the House of Medina Sidonia is located in the palace of the same name. The patron saint of the city is &quot;Our Lady of Charity&quot;, to whom it was dedicated in 1917.

==Etymology==
Concerning the etymology of both names, there is no consensus among scholars, but several hypotheses have been advanced:

* Sanlúcar&#x27;s name may have derived from the Arab šurūq (Arabic: شروق), the Arabic name for the Levant wind called &quot;sirocco&quot; or &quot;jaloque&quot;.
* According to the National Statistics Institute of Spain, the Sanlúcar toponym does not exist. However, there is historical mention of Brother Alfonso Sanlúcar de Barrameda, a Franciscan who was bishop of the Canaries-Rubicon in the period 1404–1417, and Fray Juan de Sanlúcar, a Franciscan who served in the same office from 1470–1474. As for the name &quot;Barrameda&quot;, it is unique to people born in the Canary Islands, according to census data from 1 January 2006. The historical relations between the House of Medina Sidonia, Sanlúcar, and the Canaries may explain the presence of these surnames in the Canaries. &quot;Barrameda&quot; was derived from &quot;bar-am-ma&#x27;ida&quot;, an Arabic phrase for &quot;water well of the plateau&quot;.

==Geography==
Sanlúcar de Barrameda is located on the Atlantic coast of the autonomous community of Andalusia, in the province of Cadiz, specifically on the left side of the mouth of the Guadalquivir River, which separates the provinces of Huelva and Seville. The municipality covers an area of 174.3 km2 with 6 km of beaches.

The city is part of the tourist area known as the Costa de la Luz (Coast of the Light), about 44 km from the provincial capital of Cádiz. This includes the marshes of the Pinar de la Bonanza Algaida and the marshes of the Guadalquivir, part of the Doñana Natural Park.

Sanlúcar de Barrameda borders the municipalities of Trebujena, Jerez de la Frontera, Rota, Puerto de Santa María, and Chipiona. Its topography is shown in the MTN50 sheet (scale 1:50,000) No. 1047 of the National Topographic Map.

==History==

In 1264, after Sanlúcar de Barrameda was seized from the Moors by King Alfonso X of Castile, it was reconstituted as the capital of the Señorío de Sanlúcar, and became during the 15th and 16th centuries one of the most important ports for trade connecting the Atlantic coast with the Mediterranean.

After the discovery of the New World, Sanlúcar developed as a port for refitting ships, and was the point of departure for various Spanish conquistadors. On 30 May 1498 Christopher Columbus left for his third voyage from Sanlúcar (See Voyages of Christopher Columbus). Another historical departure was that of Ferdinand Magellan on 10 August 1519, who with a fleet of five ships under his command left Seville and traveled down the Guadalquivir to Sanlúcar de Barrameda at its mouth, where they remained more than five weeks. Sanlúcar also witnessed the arrival in 1522 of the last surviving ship of Magellan&#x27;s expedition, the &quot;&#x27;Nao Victoria&quot; commanded by Juan Sebastián Elcano, which was the first ship to circumnavigate the world.

Alonso Fernández de Lugo, conqueror of the Canary Islands, of La Palma (1492) and Tenerife (1495), and subsequently the governor of the islands, was born in Sanlúcar.

The ill-fated expedition to Florida led by Pánfilo de Narváez left from Sanlúcar on 17 June 1527. Only four members survived including Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca who described the expedition in his work &quot;Naufragios&quot;.

==Culture==
Sanlúcar de Barrameda is one of the three original towns forming the &quot;triangle of xérès&quot;, or sherry-producing towns. (The other two are Jerez de la Frontera, for which sherry is named, and El Puerto de Santa María.)

Although a seaside town, Sanlúcar de Barrameda is also home to the oldest horse races in Spain and some of the oldest in Europe. The races take place just before sunset along the beach at the mouth of the river Guadalquivir every August before thousands of spectators. Contested at distances of 1500 m and 1800 m, these were the first regulated horse races in Spain; the riders wear distinctive colours and caps.

Other annual events include the Sanlúcar Tapas Fair, a local gastronomy competition; the Feria de la Manzanilla in late May, which is held at the beginning of the Noches de Bajo de Guía flamenco season; classical and jazz festivals; and the occasional concert by a major act. The city is also known for the Romería de El Rocío pilgrimage, one of the more popular expressions of the Roman Catholic faith; it can be compared to the pilgrimages to Santiago or Lourdes.

Sanlúcar has had since ancient times a popular taste for bullfighting and has given the world of bullfighting several well-known bullfighters including Manuel Hermosilla y Llanera, José Martínez Ahumada (&quot;Limeño&quot;), Francisco Ojeda González (&quot;Paco&quot; Ojeda), Julio Vega Rodríguez (&quot;Marismeño&quot;), José Luis Parada, and Manuel Rodríguez Blanco (&quot;El Manguin&quot;).

==People==

People in Sanlúcar historically worked primarily in agriculture (mainly viticulture) and fishing (especially for the famous Sanlúcar prawn). These two occupations were naturally concentrated in different parts of the town, and until the modernizing trends of the last few decades, there were marked distinctions between the people living in each area. People living near the sea, in the area known as Bajo de Guía, were almost exclusively dedicated to fishing. Now these same people combine fishing with managing restaurants that rely on fresh fish and shellfish for their menus. People living in the higher elevations away from the sea, in a part of the town known as the &quot;Barrio Alto&quot;, formerly dedicated themselves exclusively to agriculture. However, with the advent of mechanisation this sector requires less manpower throughout the year, and most farm workers now work only seasonally during the grape harvest, in the so-called &quot;sherry triangle&quot;.

The centre of Sanlúcar developed as a commercial hub, with a cityscape of intermixed historic buildings (monasteries, churches, etc.) and more modern ones. This part of the city developed at the beginning of the 20th century as the neighbourhood of the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy. Sanlúcar was then a popular beach resort; presently the people living in this area are generally linked to local wine-making interests and the tourist industry.

==Doñana National Park==
Because of its position at the mouth of the Guadalquivir, Sanlúcar is a convenient home base for exploring the nearby Doñana National Park &quot;(Parque Nacional de Doñana)&quot; and its natural features. Within the park lies the Marisma de Hinojos (Salt Marsh of Fennel Plants); also within its precincts is the possible site of the legendary lost city of Tartessos, the capital of an ancient civilization that predated the Phoenicians in Iberia.

<text>John Merriman Reynolds (March 5, 1848 – September 14, 1933) was an American lawyer, publisher, and politician from the state of Pennsylvania.

==Early life==
Reynolds was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, near Quarryville, about twelve miles south of the city of Lancaster, to parents Patrick Hewitt and Ann (née Barnett) Reynolds. His father, Patrick, was one of the well-to-do farmers of this locality and an influential citizen. He dealt quite extensively in livestock, and he also operated a grist-mill. Patrick, a native of Ireland, was eight years old when he arrived in Lancaster County with his parents.

==Education==
John Reynolds attended the public schools in Lancaster and graduated from the First Pennsylvania State Normal School, Millersville, Pennsylvania, (now Millersville University of Pennsylvania) in 1867, and from Columbian College (now George Washington University) in Washington, D.C., in 1895.

He was principal of public schools of Bedford, Pennsylvania, 1867–1868.

He studied law, was admitted to the bar February 15, 1870, and commenced practice in Bedford. He became publisher and half-owner of the &quot;Bedford Gazette&quot; in 1872, which he edited until August 1, 1880, when he devoted full attention to his growing law practice.

==Political activities==

===Pennsylvania offices===
Reynolds was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in October 1872, taking his seat in January 1873 as the youngest member of the body at age 24. He was re-elected in 1873 and was actively concerned in framing much of the legislation necessary to put in force the new constitution of the state adopted in 1873. He declined to be a candidate for re-election but was elected prosecuting attorney of Bedford County, serving from 1875 to 1879, at which time he declined renomination. In 1882, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Pennsylvania Senate. He was president of the board of education of Bedford 1884-1900. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1888 and 1892. He engaged in the banking business in 1893.

===National offices===
President Grover Cleveland appointed Reynolds Assistant Secretary of the Interior, serving from April 15, 1893, to June 1, 1897. In 1896, unable to support the policies of the Democratic presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan, Reynolds left the party and actively campaigned for the Republican candidate, William McKinley. In 1897, Reynolds was admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States.

====House of Representatives====
In November 1904, Reynolds was elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives for the 59th, 60th, and 61st Congresses.

===Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor===
He resigned in 1911 to become the tenth lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania, which he held from January 17, 1911 to January 19, 1915. He resumed the practice of law and again engaged in banking in Bedford. He was a member of the commission to revise the banking laws of the State of Pennsylvania 1917–1925.

==Death and burial==
Reynolds died on September 14, 1933, in Bedford and is interred in Bedford Cemetery. He was an active member of the Episcopal church, having served as vestryman, warden and superintendent of the Sunday-school. He was also a Royal Arch Mason and a Knight Templar.

<text>The water frame is a spinning frame that is powered by a water-wheel.

== History ==
Richard Arkwright, who patented the technology in 1769, designed a model for the production of cotton thread, which was first used in 1765. The Arkwright water frame was able to spin 96 threads at a time, which was an easier and faster method than ever before. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas Highs by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright. Being run on water power, it produced stronger and harder yarn than the &quot;spinning jenny&quot;, and propelled the adoption of the modern factory system.

Another water-powered frame for the production of textiles was developed in 1760 in the early industrialized town of Elberfeld, Prussia (now in Wuppertal, Germany), by German bleach plant owner Johann Heinrich Bockmühl.

The name &quot;water frame&quot; is derived from the use of a water wheel to drive a number of spinning frames. The water wheel provided more power to the spinning frame than human operators, reducing the amount of human labor needed and increasing the spindle count dramatically. However, unlike the spinning jenny, the water frame could spin only one thread at a time until 1779, when Samuel Crompton combined the two inventions into his spinning mule, which was more effective.

The water frame was originally powered by horses at a factory built by Arkwright and partners in Nottingham. In 1770, Arkwright and his partners built a water-powered mill in Cromford, Derbyshire.

==Cromford==
In 1771, Arkwright installed the water frame in his cotton mill at Cromford, Derbyshire, on the River Derwent, creating one of the first factories that was specifically built to house machinery rather than just bring workers together. It was one of the first instances of the working day being determined by the clock instead of the daylight hours and of people being employed rather than just contracted. In its final form, combined with his carding machine, it was the first factory to use a continuous process from raw material to finished product in a series of operations.

Arkwright played a significant role in the development of the factory system as he combined water power, the water frame, and continuous production with modern employment practices.

== International success ==
The water frame played a significant role in the development of the Industrial Revolution – first in England, but soon also in continental Europe after German entrepreneur Johann Gottfried Brügelmann managed to find out details of the technology, which had been kept very secret; disclosure of details was punishable by the death penalty. Brügelmann managed to build working water frames and used them to open the first spinning factory on the continent, built in 1783 in Ratingen and also named &quot;Cromford&quot;, from where the technology spread over the world. The factory building today hosts a museum, which is the world&#x27;s only place to see a functioning water frame.

Samuel Slater brought the water frame to America, circumventing the 1774 English ban on textile workers leaving and memorizing details of its construction; he left for New York in 1789. Moses Brown and Slater partnered to create the Slater Mill in Pawtucket in 1793, the first water-powered machine to make thread in America.

<doc id="885448" wikidata="Q739917" url="?curid=885448" title="Joe Mauer">
<text>Joseph Patrick Mauer (born April 19, 1983) is an American former professional baseball catcher and first baseman who spent his entire 15-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the Minnesota Twins. Regarded as one of the greatest contact hitters at the catcher position in his prime, Mauer is the only catcher in MLB history to win three batting titles, and the only catcher to ever win a batting title in the American League (AL).

Selected by the Twins with the first overall pick of the 2001 MLB draft, Mauer received six All-Star selections, won three consecutive Gold Glove Awards (2008–2010), five Silver Slugger Awards (including three in a row) and the 2009 AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. , he is the most recent catcher to win the MVP award in the American League, and one of only two catchers to win an MVP in the 21st century, along with Buster Posey. In 2024, Mauer was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.

==High school career==
Mauer played football, basketball, and baseball for St. Paul&#x27;s Cretin-Derham Hall Raiders. In his senior year, he became the only athlete ever to be selected as the &quot;USA Today&quot; High School Player of the Year in football (quarterback, 2000) and baseball (catcher, 2001).

In December 2009, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine included Mauer in its article on ten &quot;signature&quot; moments in U.S. high school sports in the 2000–2009 decade, referring to his selection by the Minnesota Twins as the first pick in the 2001 Major League Baseball draft.

===Baseball===
Mauer attended the same high school as Baseball Hall of Famer and former Milwaukee Brewer Paul Molitor who later became his major league manager with the Twins. Molitor has said that Mauer &quot;has the best swing he had ever seen&quot;. Jim O&#x27;Neill, Mauer&#x27;s baseball coach at Cretin-Derham Hall, said his former student &quot;has been groomed for this job since he was a little boy. Mauer&#x27;s dad, Jake, created a contraption for Joe he later named the &#x27;Quickswing.&#x27; The device dropped balls down a tube from eye level and released them at waist level.&quot; Mauer had been asked to leave his T-ball league at the age of four, because he was hitting the ball too hard for the other players. &quot;Another guy that came from Cretin-Derham Hall, Paul Molitor, was very similar, [and] had a good short swing,&quot; O&#x27;Neill said. &quot;And they&#x27;re both able to wait on the ball so long because they don&#x27;t have the big swing. Like anything, you keep simple and keep it small or short, there&#x27;s not a lot of holes in it and not a lot of room for errors.&quot;

A stand-out in baseball, Mauer struck out only once during his four-year high school career (though he did strike out in the All-Star game his senior year which isn’t included in his overall stats). He hit .605 during his senior season. Years later, Mauer laughingly told an interviewer: &quot;I can remember the time I did strike out. It was junior year, and it was in the state tournament. I came back to the bench and everybody thought something was wrong with me.&quot; Mauer&#x27;s high school batting average exceeded .500 every year. He also set a Minnesota high school record and tied the national preps mark by hitting a home run in seven consecutive games. Mauer caught for the Team USA Junior National team from 1998 to 2000 and hit .595 during his final year on the team. He was voted best hitter at the World Junior Baseball Championship in Canada in . In , Mauer was voted the United States District V Player of the Year.

===Basketball===
Mauer averaged more than 20 points a game as a point guard for Cretin-Derham Hall. He was also named to the All-State team during his final two years on Cretin-Derham&#x27;s basketball team.

===Football===
Mauer had an accomplished high school football career. In 2000, he appeared in the Faces in the Crowd section in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. During his senior season as the Raiders&#x27; quarterback, Mauer completed 178 of 269 passes (66% completion percentage), for 3,022 yards, 41 touchdowns and five interceptions. He finished his two-year career as a starter with 5,528 yards and 73 touchdowns, leading the Raiders to two consecutive Class 5A State Championship Game appearances and winning the title in 1999, the Raiders&#x27; first.

Mauer was honored as the 2001 Gatorade National Player of the Year, was named to the USA Today All-USA high school football team, was honored as USA Today&#x27;s Player of the Year, was a Reebok/ESPN High School All-American, and was awarded Player of the Year for the game that would go on to be known as the U.S. Army All-American Bowl. Mauer was also named National High School Quarterback of the Year in 2000 by The National Quarterback Club.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
After committing to play football at Florida State University, Mauer ultimately decided instead to enter the Major League Baseball Draft. Mauer was selected by the Twins as the first overall pick of the 2001 draft, ahead of college pitcher Mark Prior, who was taken second overall by the Chicago Cubs. Mauer was part of the United States&#x27; roster at the All-Star Futures Game at U.S. Cellular Field before being promoted to the Twins&#x27; roster in after his predecessor, A. J. Pierzynski, was traded to the San Francisco Giants, in the 2003 offseason.

===2004–2005===
Mauer made his major league debut on April 5, 2004, and finished the game 2-for-3, hitting a single off Rafael Betancourt of the Cleveland Indians for his first major-league hit. A knee injury to his left medial meniscus on April 7, 2004, required surgery and sidelined Mauer for more than a month. After a rehabilitation stint with the Twins&#x27; Triple-A affiliate, the Rochester Red Wings, Mauer returned to the Twins&#x27; lineup in June. In July, pain and swelling in his knee forced an early end to Mauer&#x27;s 2004 season. Following his injury-shortened 2004, Mauer signed a contract for under a million with the Twins on January 24, 2005. In 2005, Mauer returned to the Twins&#x27; lineup for his first full major league season, and batted .294 with 144 hits, nine home runs and 55 RBI in 131 games.

===2006–2008===

In his 2006 season, Mauer became the first catcher in American League history to lead the American League in batting average, finishing with an average of .347. Mauer&#x27;s performance during the months of May and June garnered attention from the national media. He recorded a .528 batting average over the first ten days of June and hit .452 over the course of the month. He was also the first player since Mike Piazza in 1997 to reach base four or more times for five consecutive games. On June 12, Mauer was named the American League Player of the Week by Major League Baseball for his performance the week of June 4–11, during which he hit .625 (15-for-24) with five doubles, 4 RBI and two stolen bases.

Mauer recorded his first five RBI game June 26, against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Mauer followed that up with his first career five-hit game on June 27, also against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was also named MLB Player of the Month for June after batting .452 with a .624 slugging percentage and .528 on-base percentage, 11 doubles, 14 RBI and 18 runs. Along with Johan Santana (Pitcher of the Month) and Francisco Liriano (Rookie of the Month), Mauer was part of the first-ever single-team sweep of MLB&#x27;s three monthly awards. On July 2, Mauer was selected by the players to his first All-Star Game. Mauer appeared on the cover of the August 7, 2006 issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.
Mauer finished the 2006 regular season with a .347 batting average, edging the New York Yankees&#x27; Derek Jeter and Robinson Canó to win the American League batting title and become the first-ever American League catcher to win the crown and the first catcher to claim the title since Ernie Lombardi in 1942 with the Boston Braves. His .347 average was the highest in the Major Leagues, a feat not achieved by the previous three catchers to win NL batting titles. He was the youngest player to win a batting title since Alex Rodriguez in 1996. After going 2-for-4 in the last game of the 2006 regular season, Mauer confessed to reporters, &quot;When I told you I wasn&#x27;t thinking about the batting title? I was lying. I&#x27;ve never been that nervous in my life. I haven&#x27;t felt anything like that since Opening Day as a rookie.&quot; Mauer won his first Silver Slugger Award in 2006, along with teammate Justin Morneau.

On February 11, 2007, Mauer agreed to a four-year, $34 million contract with the Twins to avoid arbitration. The deal ensured that Mauer would remain in Minnesota long enough to play in the Twins&#x27; Target Field in 2010. On July 21, Mauer hit his first career inside-the-park home run against Angels pitcher Scot Shields. It was his fifth home run of the season, and there were two players on base when he hit the homer. It was the first inside-the-park home run by a catcher since Kelly Stinnett did it for the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2005. Mauer finished the 2007 season batting .293 with seven home runs and 60 RBI in 109 games.

In 2008, Mauer became the first American League catcher to win the batting title twice when he led the AL with an average of .328. He also recorded nine home runs and 85 RBI in 146 games. On July 6, Mauer was announced as the starting catcher for the American League in the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Mauer underwent surgery for kidney obstruction on December 22. Mauer won his first Gold Glove award in 2008, announced on November 6. He finished fourth in the balloting for American League Most Valuable Player, behind Dustin Pedroia, Justin Morneau, and Kevin Youkilis.

===2009: MVP season===
In 2009, Mauer became the first catcher to lead the majors in batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage in a single year, and the first player to lead the American League in all three since George Brett did so in 1980. Mauer&#x27;s .365 average, which is the highest mark among catchers (with at least 3.1 plate appearances per game) since 1901, and the highest by a Twin since Rod Carew&#x27;s .388 in 1977, led Major League Baseball. Mauer also won his second consecutive Gold Glove in 2009. Mauer was named the American League&#x27;s 2009 MVP by a near-unanimous decision (27 out of 28 first place votes).

On March 11, Mauer was diagnosed with inflammation in the sacroiliac joint by team doctors following a magnetic resonance arthrogram. He was unable to take part in team workouts during spring training due to the pain in his lower back, which he first began experiencing late in the 2008 season. Mauer missed the start of the 2009 regular season and returned on May 1. He went 2-for-3 with an RBI and three runs scored in his first game back, hitting a home run on his first swing of the season.
After his return on May 1, Mauer had the best month of his career, batting .414 with 11 home runs and drove in 32 RBI in 28 May games, becoming the first-ever Twins player to reach that mark in a single month. During the week of May 18–24, Mauer led the major leagues in batting average at .458 (11-for-24), RBI with 13, and runs scored with 12, also hitting four home runs and accumulating 25 total bases. On May 26, he was named MLB Player of the Week for his performance. Through the month of May, Mauer led the major leagues in average at .414, on-base percentage at .500, and slugging percentage at .838, in addition to his home run and RBI totals, earning him his second Player of the Month Award honors. Mauer appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; for a second time on June 24. An additional 25,000 copies of the magazine were sent to Minnesota for the occasion. He was selected to the 2009 MLB All-Star Game as the starting catcher and participated in the Home Run Derby, losing a tiebreaker to Albert Pujols in the first round.

The Twins trailed the Detroit Tigers by seven games in the American League Central division at the start of September, but rallied, winning 17 of their last 21 games to finish the season tied atop the division. On October 6, the Twins beat the Tigers 6–5 in Game 163, a 12-inning one-game playoff, to secure the division title. In 2009, Mauer led the American League in batting average (.365), on-base percentage (.444), slugging percentage (.587), and OPS (1.031), all of which were career-highs. Mauer became the first catcher to lead the league in all four offensive categories in a single season, and the first catcher to win three batting titles. At the time, he had won as many batting championships in a span of four years as all other Major League catchers in the history of baseball combined. Two National League catchers had won a total of three batting titles: Eugene &quot;Bubbles&quot; Hargrave in 1926, and Hall of Famer Ernie Lombardi in 1938 and 1942 (Buster Posey won his NL batting title in 2012). Mauer also established career-highs in hits (191), home runs (28), RBIs (96), extra-base hits (59), total bases (307), bWAR (7.8, including 7.7 oWAR), and fWAR (8.4), as well as near-personal bests in every other offensive category across 138 games.

Facing the Yankees in the ALDS, Mauer continued to swing the bat well, recording five hits in 12 at-bats plus two walks, but the Twins were swept by the eventual World Series champions in three games. On October 29, &quot;Baseball America&quot; named Mauer its 2009 Major League Player of the Year. On November 23, Mauer was named the 2009 American League Most Valuable Player by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America over Yankees teammates Mark Teixeira and Derek Jeter, earning 27 of the 28 first-place votes. This made Mauer the second catcher in 33 years to win the AL MVP. He also received both a Gold Glove and Silver Slugger award for the second year in a row.

===2010–2012===
On March 21, 2010, Mauer agreed to an eight-year contract extension with the Twins worth $184 million which took effect in the 2011 and ran through the 2018 season. It was the richest contract paid to a catcher in the history of Major League Baseball. On July 26, 2010, Mauer hit a home run and drove in a career-high seven runs in the Twins&#x27; 19–1 win over the rival Kansas City Royals. He hit his 1,000th career Major League hit on September 14, 2010 against the Chicago White Sox at U.S. Cellular Field.

Mauer underwent arthroscopic knee surgery after the 2010 season, and missed most of spring training due to a difficult recovery from the operation. After further difficulties during the first days of the season, he was placed on the disabled list immediately after the Twins&#x27; game on April 15. Team doctors believed his problem, termed a &quot;bilateral leg weakness&quot;, was due to too light a workload during spring training. Mauer returned to game action as a designated hitter in extended spring training on May 25, and made his first post-DL appearance as a catcher in another extended spring training game on June 2. The following week, he went on a further rehabilitation assignment to the Twins&#x27; Class A affiliate, the Fort Myers Miracle, a team managed by his older brother Jake. After Mauer caught several games with the Miracle, it was speculated he could return to the Twins as early as June 16 or 17, but Twins manager Ron Gardenhire did not commit to a return date. Mauer returned to play with the Twins on June 17, 2011 and received a standing ovation from the fans.

Mauer made his first Major League start at first base on July 7, 2011, in Chicago, where he turned the first ball hit to him into an unassisted double play. In all, he had 13 putouts and two assists and went 3-for-5 at the plate with 2 RBI in a 6–2 victory over the White Sox. On August 18, 2011, Mauer played his first game in right field. He had three putouts and went 1-for-3 with an RBI in an 8–4 Twins loss against the New York Yankees.

Mauer struggled the entire summer with various ailments, from complications due to surgery at the beginning of the season to a bout of pneumonia at the end of the season, and had undoubtedly the worst season of his career. He played in only 82 games all year (career 126 average per season, not counting the 35 games he played in 2004), batted only .287 (career .323), and caught only 52 games. He hoped to return to form in 2012.

At the start of spring training, Mauer expressed strong dissatisfaction with the previous season, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve kind of been answering...questions [about last season] all winter, and it left a bad taste in a lot of people&#x27;s mouths, and mine included, but it&#x27;s a new year, and as soon as we can forget about 2011, the better, and focus on not letting it happen again.&quot; On July 1, it was announced that he would be headed for his fifth All-Star Game. Mauer&#x27;s batting average was .325 in the first half of the season, including four homers and 36 RBI. By mid-July, Mauer had the second-highest batting average in the American League. On August 27, Mauer played his 832nd game at catcher for the Twins, breaking a franchise record set by Earl Battey.

===2013–2018===

Mauer was the Twins&#x27; Opening Day catcher, with Ryan Doumit as his backup, and also saw time at first base and designated hitter. Through the first half, he hit .320 with eight home runs, 32 RBI and 50 runs including consecutive four-hit games against the Angels in April and a 15-game hitting streak from April 30 to May 18. He was named to his sixth All-Star Game as the starting catcher. On August 20, Mauer went on the 7-day disabled list with concussion-like symptoms. In his absence, Doumit, Chris Herrmann and Josmil Pinto started at catcher. Mauer never returned to the line-up and his season ended after 113 games. For the season, he hit .324/.404/.476 with 11 home runs, 47 RBI, 62 runs, 35 doubles and 61 walks in 113 games, while earning the 2013 AL Silver Slugger Award at catcher. He and former Yankee Horace Clarke are the only hitters ever to break up three no-hitter bids in the ninth inning.

After the 2013 season, the Twins announced that Mauer would permanently move to first base in order to protect their star player from further concussions and the day-to-day physical wear of being a major league catcher. In 2014, Mauer played in 120 games, compiling a slash line of .277/.361/.371 with four home runs, 55 RBI, 60 runs, and 27 doubles.

Mauer struck out over 100 times for the first time in his career in 2015. He set career marks in games played (158), plate appearances (666) and at bats (592), while batting a career-low .261 with 10 home runs and 66 RBI in 134 games. However, his defense at first base improved, as he committed only two errors all season at first base.

Mauer started his 13th Opening Day in 2017, tying with Harmon Killebrew for the franchise record. For the season, Mauer batted .305 with seven home runs, 71 RBI and an .801 OPS in 141 games.

On April 12, 2018, Mauer became the 287th player in the history of Major League Baseball to collect 2,000 hits with a two-run seventh inning single off White Sox pitcher Aaron Bummer.

In the ninth inning of the last game of the 2018 MLB season on September 30, 2018, at Target Field, amidst speculation that he would retire at the end of the year, Mauer made an appearance as catcher for the first time since his concussion in 2013, before being removed for backup Chris Gimenez after one pitch. He exited to a standing ovation from the crowd and both dugouts. In his last season, he batted .282/.351/.379 with six home runs and 48 RBI in 127 games, and led all major league hitters with a batting average of .407 with runners in scoring position, and saw the highest percentage of fastballs of all MLB hitters (63.6%).
On November 9, 2018, Mauer officially retired from baseball in an open letter to Twins fans. The Twins announced they would retire Mauer&#x27;s No. 7 during the 2019 season, eventually setting the date as June 15.

===MLB records===
Mauer holds the MLB single-season records for the highest single-season batting average for catchers (.365), which he set in 2009 and the highest single-season on-base percentage for a catcher (.444), which he also set in 2009. His career on-base percentage is the highest among major league catchers with a minimum of 500 games played. Mauer is also the first AL catcher to win a batting title and holds the record for the most batting titles by a catcher in a career (3).

===Career statistics===
In 1,858 games over 15 seasons, Mauer posted a .306 batting average (2,123-for-6,930) with 1,018 runs, 428 doubles, 30 triples, 143 home runs, 923 RBIs, 939 bases on balls, .388 on-base percentage and .439 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .995 fielding percentage at catcher and .996 fielding percentage at first base. Mauer had five career five-hit games and 23 four-hit games in his MLB career.

===National Baseball Hall of Fame===
Mauer became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2024. He received 293 votes, 76.1% of the total, enough to be enshrined on his first ballot. He was just the third catcher to be elected on his first ballot, after Johnny Bench and Iván Rodríguez. Additionally, he became the fourth first overall draft pick to be inducted, after Ken Griffey Jr., Chipper Jones, and Harold Baines. Mauer was also the first Hall of Famer to play his entire career in the 21st century and the first to be drafted in that century.

==International career==
Mauer was selected as a catcher and first baseman for Team USA in the 2013 World Baseball Classic.

==Other work==

Mauer modeled for Perry Ellis in the 2004–05 off-season, and is featured in television commercials for Head &amp; Shoulders, Pepsi, ESPN, Fox Sports Net, PlayStation 3, Gatorade and my29.

Mauer&#x27;s family manufactured and sold a product called Joe Mauer&#x27;s Quickswing. Invented by Mauer&#x27;s father, the device allows kids to practice hitting on their own.

Mauer&#x27;s Quickswing Camp is held annually in the winter at a St. Paul area college. The camp teaches youth the basics of batting skills. Mauer taped an episode of &quot;Homecoming with Rick Reilly&quot; for ESPN on January 27, 2010, at Cretin-Derham Hall High School, his alma mater, in St. Paul, Minnesota. The episode aired on April 12, 2010.

Mauer appeared in a TV commercial for Explore Minnesota, the state tourism agency, in March 2011.

==Video games==
Mauer was the cover athlete for Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;MLB 10: The Show&quot; and &quot;MLB 11: The Show&quot; game for the PlayStation platform.

The game&#x27;s tagline, &quot;Well played, Mauer&quot;, used by actor Jerry Lambert (playing the role of fictional vice president Kevin Butler) in television commercials promoting the game (in the ad, Mauer and Butler were playing MLB 11 and Mauer hits a home run to deep right field), was mimicked by Twins announcer Dick Bremer during a game versus the visiting Kansas City Royals on June 10, 2010. Royals outfielder Mitch Maier fouled back a pitch from Twins pitcher Brian Duensing. The ball traveled over the protective net behind the home plate area. Mauer tracked the ball, reached around the screen, and caught it, leading Bremer to exclaim, &quot;Did he catch that? Oh, well played, Mauer!&quot; The catch is featured in &quot;MLB 11: The Show&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Joe Mauer&quot; introductory vignette.

Mauer appeared as a playable pro in &quot;Backyard Baseball 2009&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mauer shared a house with former Twins teammate Justin Morneau in Saint Paul, Minnesota, during the 2006 season. 
 Mauer wore long sideburns throughout his big league career, and on August 10, 2006, the Twins held &quot;Joe Mauer Sideburns Night&quot; in his honor. The first 10,000 fans were given synthetic sideburns with double-sided tape to share in Mauer&#x27;s trademark look.

On December 11, 2011, Mauer announced his engagement to Saint Paul nurse Maddie Bisanz, his girlfriend of about 18 months and a fellow graduate of Cretin-Derham Hall High School. The couple was married on December 1, 2012, at Nativity of Our Lord Catholic Church in Saint Paul. Justin Morneau was a groomsman. The Mauers&#x27; twin daughters were born on July 24, 2013. On November 14, 2018, they welcomed a son.

In 2012, Mauer bought a house in Sunfish Lake, Minnesota, a Saint Paul suburb.

===Relatives===
In the 2001 draft, the Twins also selected Joe&#x27;s older brother Jake in the 23rd round (677th overall). Jake played at the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul. Some observers concluded that this was an attempt to induce Joe to sign a contract, but Mike Radcliff, the scouting director of the Twins, denied this. Jake Mauer ended his playing career after the 2005 season but went on to manage the Gulf Coast League Twins (Rookie-level). After winning the GCL South with the Twins in 2009, Jake moved up to the High-A Fort Myers Miracle and managed the team for two seasons. Following the Twins&#x27; agreement to add the Cedar Rapids Kernels as the team&#x27;s Low-A affiliate in November 2012, Mauer was named the team&#x27;s manager.

Mauer&#x27;s other brother, Billy, signed with the Twins as an undrafted free agent in 2003 and pitched in the organization for three seasons before chronic shoulder problems forced him to retire from the game. He ended his minor league career with a 3–4 record and 3.66 earned run average (ERA) in 43 games. Billy now owns Mauer Chevrolet and Mauer Buick GMC, auto dealerships in the Twin Cities suburb of Inver Grove Heights.

Joe&#x27;s father, Jake Mauer II developed the Mauer Quickswing, a hitting aid for players. Along with his brothers Billy and Jake and Baseball Hall of Fame player Paul Molitor (who would eventually become manager of the Twins for Joe&#x27;s final four seasons before retirement) Joe appeared in promotional videos for the equipment. In January 2023, Jake Mauer II died from lung cancer and Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome.

Joe&#x27;s cousin, Ken Mauer, is a former referee in the NBA. Another cousin, Mark Mauer, is a former college football coach and player.

<doc id="885454" wikidata="Q862376" url="?curid=885454" title="Shooting brake">
<text>Shooting-brake (alternately spelled shooting break) is a car body style which originated in the 1890s from horse-drawn carriage origins. The first automotive shooting brakes were manufactured in the early 1900s in the United Kingdom. The vehicle style became popular in England during the 1920s and 1930s, and was produced by vehicle manufacturers or as conversions by coachbuilders. The term was used in Britain interchangeably with &quot;estate car&quot; from the 1930s but has not been in general use for many years and has been more or less superseded by the latter term.

Since the 1960s, the term has evolved, describing cars combining elements of both station wagon and coupé body stylesgenerally a two door station wagon, with or without reference to the historical usage for shooting parties. During the 1960s and early 1970s, several high-end European manufacturers produced two-door shooting brake versions of their sports cars. Following a hiatus from the mid 1970s until the early 2010s, the shooting-brake body style entered a resurgence.

== Horse-drawn origins ==

A horse-drawn shooting brake was a variation of the break (also spelled &quot;brake&quot;). Originally built as a simple but heavy frame for breaking in young horses to drive, over time it became a gentleman-driven vehicle and was popular for such aristocratic sports as shooting parties. Taking the design from the rear-loading horse-drawn sporting vehicle, the station wagon was born, retaining the term &quot;shooting brake&quot;.

==Definition==
There is no universally agreed definition of a shooting brake as an autobody style; however the common themes are the coupé and station wagon, and the historical usage of the vehicle for hunting trips. Descriptions of the body style and usage of the term include:
* &quot;A sleek wagon with two doors and sports-car panache, its image entangled with European aristocracy, fox hunts, and baying hounds&quot;.
* &quot;A cross between an estate and a coupé&quot;.
* &quot;Essentially a two-door station wagon&quot;.
* An interchangeable term for estate car (station wagon). In France, a station wagon is marketed as a &quot;break&quot;, once having been called a &quot;break de chasse&quot;, which translates as &quot;hunting break&quot;.
* A body style with &quot;a very interesting profile. It makes use of the road space it covers a little better than a normal coupé, and also helps the rear person with headroom. ... The occasional use of the rear seat means you can do one of these cars, even if such a wagon lacks the everyday practicality of four doors.&quot;
* A vehicle conceived &quot;to take gentlemen on the hunt with their firearms and dogs. ... Although [its] glory days came before World War II, and it has faded from the scene in recent decades, the body style is showing signs of a renaissance [as of 2006]. ... The most famous shooting brakes had custom two-door bodies fitted to the chassis of pedigreed cars.&quot;

===1900s to 1950s===

In the early 1900s, the Scottish Albion Motors began producing shooting brake models, described in the weekly magazine &quot;The Commercial Motor&quot; as having &quot;seats for eight persons as well as the driver, whilst four guns and a large supply of cartridges, provisions baskets and a good &#x27;bag&#x27; can be carried.&quot; The 1912 Hudson Model 33 was described in England as a shooting brake, on the basis that &quot;it was also used to carry the beaters to and from the location of the shoot, and for bringing back the game shot&quot;.

Early motorized safari vehicles were described as shooting brakes with no windows or doors. One such description read: &quot;Instead roll-down canvas curtains were buttoned to the roof in the case of bad weather. These cars were heavy and comfortable in good weather and allowed quick and silent exit as no shooting was permitted from the vehicles.&quot; During the 1920s and 1930s, shooting brake vehicles were popular in England and were produced as shooting brakes from the factory or converted by coachbuilders. The term &quot;estate car&quot; began to be used instead of shooting brake, as the use of the vehicle expanded from just shooting parties to other domestic uses including ferrying guests and their luggage to and from railway stations.

===1960s to 1990s===
During the 1960s and early 1970s, several high-end European manufacturers produced two-door shooting brake versions of their sports cars, including the 1960 Sunbeam Alpine Shooting Brake and 1965 Aston Martin DB5 Shooting Brake. The 1966 Sunbeam Alpine was a limited-production three-door variant of its two-door open sports car with leather interior and walnut trim, selling at a price double its open counterpart and marketed as a shooting brake. The Aston Martin DB5, DB6, and DBS shooting brakes were custom manufactured by coachbuilder Harold Radford from 1965 until 1967.

A prototype DB5 shooting-brake was custom produced by the factory for David Brown, an avid hunter and dog owner, and a further 11–12 coupés were custom modified for Aston Martin by independent coachbuilder Harold Radford. In August 2019 a DB5 sold for a record $1.765m (£1.456m), making it the most valuable Shooting Brake bodied-car of any marque sold at auction. In 1992, Aston Martin manufactured in-house a limited production shooting brake variant of its Virage/Vantage, including a four-door shooting brake.

Other cars combining elements of a wagon and coupé have been described but were never formally marketed as shooting brakes, including the Reliant Scimitar GTE (1968–1975), the Volvo P1800 ES (1972–1973), and the later 480 (1986–1995) – marketed as a coupé, and with a sporty, low nose featuring pop-up headlights, but with a distinctly estate-like rear body. The 1998 BMW Z3 Coupé (plus associated M Coupé model) is also typically referred to as a shooting brake.

===2000s to present===
Mostly dormant since the mid-1970s, the shooting brake term was used in 2004 to describe the Chevrolet Nomad concept car. The following year, the Audi Shooting Brake concept car debuted at the Tokyo Motor Show. Several other cars have been described by journalists as shooting brakes, including 2005 Dodge Magnum Station Wagon, 2006 Renault Altica concept car, 2008 Mini Clubman, 2011 Fisker Surf concept car, and the 2011 Ferrari FF. The first production model of the 21st century marketed as a shooting brake was the 2012 Mercedes Benz CLS-Class Shooting Brake (X218), which was previewed as the Shooting Brake concept car at Auto China. This model has four passenger doors, which is at odds with some definitions of a shooting brake as having two doors. In 2015, Mercedes-Benz added the smaller CLA-Class four-door shooting brake to the model range.

The 2018 Porsche Panamera Sport Turismo, along with the Volkswagen Arteon despite the Arteon having five doors, are both described by their manufacturer as shooting brakes. The trend is to associate the shooting brake body style with &quot;performance&quot; and also making the cars &quot;more practical&quot; than a coupé. The marketing descriptions have been further blurred between variations of the terms with names such as sports tourer, sportback, or &quot;shooting break&quot; as a way to differentiate from SUVs and reposition ordinary body styles with &quot;sleeker lines&quot; in the minds of consumers to &quot;ooze sex appeal&quot;. BMW unveiled the &quot;Concept Touring Coupé&quot; based on the Z4 at the Concorso d&#x27;Eleganza Villa d&#x27;Este in 2023. The Chinese electric vehicle brand Zeekr also describe their Zeekr 001 and Zeekr 001 FR models as shooting brakes, although unlike other shooting brake cars both models have five doors.

<text>Chrząszcz (&quot;beetle, chafer&quot;) by Jan Brzechwa is a tongue-twister poem famous for being considered one of the hardest-to-pronounce texts in Polish literature. It may cause problems even for adult, native Polish speakers.

The first few lines of the poem:

The first line &quot;W Szczebrzeszynie chrząszcz brzmi w trzcinie&quot;
(&quot;In Szczebrzeszyn a beetle buzzes in the reed&quot;) is a well-known Polish tongue-twister and dates to at least the 19th century.

Thanks to the poem, the town of Szczebrzeszyn is widely known in Poland. Two monuments to the beetle were erected there, and a yearly sculpture festival has been held there ever since.

&quot;Chrząszcz&quot; was translated into English by Walter Whipple as &quot;Cricket&quot; (whose Polish equivalent, &quot;świerszcz&quot;, is also considered difficult to pronounce for non-Polish speakers).

<doc id="885462" wikidata="Q1751632" url="?curid=885462" title="Rendering (animal products)">
<text>Rendering is a process that converts waste animal tissue into stable, usable materials. Rendering can refer to any processing of animal products into more useful materials, or, more narrowly, to the rendering of whole animal fatty tissue into purified fats like lard or tallow. Rendering can be carried out on an industrial, farm, or kitchen scale. It can also be applied to non-animal products that are rendered down to pulp. The rendering process simultaneously dries the material and separates the fat from the bone and protein, yielding a fat commodity and a protein meal.

== Input sources ==
In animal products, the majority of tissue processed comes from slaughterhouses, but also includes restaurant grease, butcher shop trimmings, and expired meat from grocery stores. This material can include the fatty tissue, bones, and offal, as well as entire carcasses of animals condemned at slaughterhouses and those that have died on farms, in transit, etc. The most common animal sources are beef, pork, mutton, and poultry.

== Process variations ==
The rendering process varies in a number of ways:
* Whether the end products are used as human or animal food depends on the quality of input material and the processing methods and equipment.
* The material may be processed by wet or dry means.
**In wet processing, either boiling water or steam is added to the material, separating fat into a floating phase.
**In dry processing, fat is released by dehydrating the raw material.
* The temperature range used may be high or low.
* Rendering may be done either in discrete batches or in a continuous process.
* The processing plant may be operated by an independent company that buys input material from suppliers, or by a packing plant that produces the material in-house.

=== Edible products ===
Edible rendering processes are basically meat processing operations and produce lard or edible tallow for use in food products. Edible rendering is generally carried out in a continuous process at low temperature (less than the boiling point of water). The process usually consists of finely chopping the edible fat materials (generally fat trimmings from meat cuts), heating them with or without added steam, and then carrying out two or more stages of centrifugal separation. The first stage separates the liquid water and fat mixture from the solids. The second stage further separates the fat from the water. The solids may be used in food products, pet foods, etc., depending on the original materials. The separated fat may be used in food products, or if in surplus, may be diverted to soap making operations. Most edible rendering is done by meat packing or processing companies.

=== Inedible products ===
Materials that for aesthetic or sanitary reasons are not suitable for human food are the feedstocks for inedible rendering processes. Much of the inedible raw material is rendered using the &quot;dry&quot; method. This may be a batch or a continuous process in which the material is heated in a steam-jacketed vessel to drive off the moisture and simultaneously release the fat from the fat cells. The material is first ground, then heated to release the fat and drive off the moisture, percolated to drain off the free fat, and then more fat is pressed out of the solids, which at this stage are called &quot;cracklings&quot; or &quot;dry-rendered tankage&quot;. The cracklings are further ground to make meat and bone meal.

A variation on a dry process involves finely chopping the material, fluidizing it with hot fat, and then evaporating the mixture in one or more evaporator stages. Some inedible rendering is done using a wet process, which is generally a continuous process similar in some ways to that used for edible materials. The material is heated with added steam and then pressed to remove a water-fat mixture that is then separated into fat, water, and fine solids by stages of centrifuging and/or evaporation. The solids from the press are dried and then ground into meat and bone meal. Most independent renderers process only inedible material.

=== Kitchen scale ===
Rendering of fats is also carried out on a kitchen scale by chefs and home cooks. In the kitchen, rendering is used to transform butter into clarified butter, suet into tallow, pork fat into lard, and chicken fat into schmaltz.

==History==
The development of rendering was primarily responsible for the profitable utilization of meat industry by-products, which in turn allowed the development of a massive industrial-scale meat industry that made food more economical for the consumer.
Rendering has been carried out for many centuries, primarily for soap and candle making. The earliest rendering was done in a kettle over an open fire. This type of rendering is still done on farms to make lard (pork fat) for food purposes. With the development of steam boilers, it was possible to use steam-jacketed kettles to make a higher grade product, and reduce fire danger. From at least 1896, &quot;yellow grease&quot; has referred to lower-quality grades of tallow (cow or sheep fat) from animal rendering plants.

A further development came in the 19th century with the use of steam digesters: a tank used as a pressure cooker where steam was injected into the material being rendered. This process is a wet rendering process called &quot;tanking&quot; and was used for edible and inedible products, although better grades of edible products were made using the open kettle process. After the material is tanked, the free fat is run off, the remaining water (&quot;tank water&quot;) run into a separate vat, and the solids removed and dried by pressing and steam-drying in a jacketed vessel. The tank water was either run into a sewer or it was evaporated to make glue or protein concentrate to add to fertilizer. The solids were used for fertilizer.

The pressure tank made possible the development of the Chicago meat industry in the United States—with its concentration in one geographic area—because it allowed the economic disposal of byproducts which would otherwise overwhelm the environment in that area. At first, small companies that sprang up near the packers did the rendering. Later the packers entered the rendering industry. Gustavus Swift, Nelson Morris, and Lucius Darling were among the early pioneers of the U.S. rendering industry, with their personal backing and/or direct participation in the rendering industry.

Upton Sinclair wrote &quot;The Jungle&quot; (1906), an exposé on the Chicago meat processing industry which created public outrage. His work helped the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1907 which paved the way for the creation of the FDA. In 2012, the occupation of renderer appeared in a list of &quot;dirtiest jobs&quot;.

Innovations came rapidly in the 20th century. Some of these were the uses for rendered products, and others were the rendering methods. In the 1920s, a batch dry rendering process was invented; the material was cooked in horizontal steam-jacketed cylinders (similar to the fertilizer dryers of the day). Advantages claimed for the dry process were economy of energy, better protein yield, faster processing, and fewer noxious odors. Over the years, the wet &quot;tanking&quot; process was replaced with the dry process. By the end of World War II, most rendering installations used the dry process. In the 1960s, continuous dry processes were introduced, one using a variation of the conventional dry cooker and the other making use of a mincing and evaporation process to dry the material and yield the fat. In the 1980s, high energy costs popularized the various &quot;wet&quot; continuous processes. These processes were more energy efficient and allowed the re-use of process vapours to pre-heat or dry the materials during the process.

After WWII, synthetic detergents arrived, which displaced soaps in domestic and industrial washing. In the early 1950s, over half of the inedible fat market vanished. Diversion in these materials into animal feeds soon replaced the lost soap market and eventually became the single largest use for inedible fats.

The widespread use of &quot;boxed beef&quot;, where the beef was cut into consumer portions at packing plants rather than local butcher shops and markets, meant that fat and meat scraps for renderers stayed at the packing plants and were rendered there by packer renderers, rather than by the independent rendering companies.

The rejection of animal fats by diet-conscious consumers led to a surplus of edible fats, and the resultant diversion into soapmaking and oleochemicals, displacing inedible fats and contributing to the market volatility of this commodity.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The rendering industry is one of the oldest recycling industries, and made possible the development of a large food industry. The industry takes what would otherwise be waste materials and makes useful products such as fuels, soaps, rubber, plastics, etc. At the same time, rendering reduces what would otherwise be a major disposal problem. As an example, the United States annually recycles more than 21 million metric tons of highly perishable and noxious organic matter. In 2004, U.S. industry produced over 8 million metric tons of products, of which 1.6 million metric tons were exported.

Usually, raw materials are susceptible to spoilage. After rendering, they are much more resistant. This is due to the application of heat either through cooking in the wet rendering process or the extraction of fluid in the dry rendering process. The fat obtained can be used as low-cost raw material in making grease, animal feed, soap, candles, biodiesel, and as a feed-stock for the chemical industry. Tallow, derived from beef waste, is an important raw material in the steel rolling industry, providing lubrication when compressing steel sheets.

Meat and bone meal in animal feed was one route for the late-20th century spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad-cow disease, BSE), which is also fatal to humans. Early in the 21st century, most countries tightened regulations to prevent this.

<text>The Paya Lebar Air Base is a military airbase of the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) in Singapore located at Airport Road in Paya Lebar, in the eastern region of Singapore. The airbase goes by the motto of &quot;Strength Through Readiness&quot;.

It was originally built in 1954 as &quot;Singapore International Airport&quot; to replace Kallang Airport; control of the airport was transferred to RSAF in 1980 when it was renamed Paya Lebar Air Base, following the relocation of the civilian airport to Changi Airport.

Under the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)&#x27;s Master Plan, Paya Lebar Air Base is scheduled to be decommissioned by around 2030 to make way for residential and commercial developments as a new town, with the RSAF relocating to other airbases throughout the country such as at Changi and Tengah, which will be expanded throughout the 2020s.

==History==
The airport was built from 1952 to 1955, and opened on 20 August that year by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Alan Lennox-Boyd. The architect for the project was J. J. Bryan, a public works engineer with experience constructing airports in other parts of Asia.

It was one of the two hubs for Malayan Airways at this time, and the airline had its first flight outside Southeast Asia in 1958, using a DC-4 plane leased from Qantas, flying to Hong Kong. Turboprops were introduced over the next few years, and the name was changed to Malaysian Airways.

In 1962, a joint RAF/Singapore civil Air Traffic Control service was formed to provide Military cover for Air Defence. During that time Britannia aircraft of British Eagle provided transport for the British military. Comet 4C&#x27;s were common traffic and the new VC10 arrived reducing flight time, rather than the 24hrs-with stops- of the Britannia.

In 1966, the company focused more on Singapore, buying Boeing 707s, headquartering itself in that country, and renaming itself Malaysia-Singapore Airlines – with a notable fluorescent yellow livery. Its primary hub became Paya Lebar, and services began to reach out further into North Asia.

From 1979 to 1980, British Airways, in conjunction with Singapore Airlines, began supersonic Concorde services from London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport, to Paya Lebar Singapore.

Malaysia-Singapore Airlines was dissolved in 1972, with the airline splitting into two; Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines were formed – the latter keeping all the 707s; and Singapore Airlines remaining at Paya Lebar. Passenger numbers rose from 1.7 million to 4 million between 1970 and 1975. The airport was constrained by housing estates and although some work was done to keep it operational in the meantime, construction began on the new airport in 1975 and opened in 1981. Paya Lebar then closed to civil traffic, the IATA airport code of SIN and the ICAO airport code of WSSS were transferred to Changi Airport.

===Conversion to military use===
Singapore International Airport began to be gradually converted into a military air-force base from late 1967 onwards. During that year, an &quot;Air Movement Centre&quot; was constructed to handle passengers and cargo arriving on Republic of Singapore Air Force, and Ministry of Defence charter flights and foreign military aircraft. The original terminal building (painted green), maintenance hangar and control tower are retained. Access to terminal and hangars are off-limits closed off by a wired fence. It became a complete military airbase in 1981 when Singapore Changi Airport was opened and was subsequently renamed as Paya Lebar Air Base (PLAB) in the same year.

====Paya Lebar Air Base====
The air base currently houses aircraft such as the C-130 Hercules and two squadrons of F-15SG Strike Eagles.

The flying squadrons are:
*122 Squadron with 10 C-130 Hercules,
*142 Squadron with 15 F-15SG Strike Eagles,
*149 Squadron with &gt;24 F-15SG Strike Eagles

The support squadrons are:
*Air Logistics Squadron (ALS)
*Airfield Maintenance Squadron (AMS)
*Field Defence Squadron (FDS)
*Flying Support Squadron (FSS)

Former squadrons based here are:
*141 Squadron with F-5S/T, RF-5S
*144 Squadron with F-5S/T

====Use by the United States Air Force====
Under Singapore&#x27;s permission, the Paya Lebar Airbase is also used by various flying units of United States Air Force and United States Navy (including United States Marine Corps Aviation) as a strategic refuelling stopover and staging post/transit point; the base is also used permanently by the 497th Combat Training Squadron for other flight operations since 31 October 1991.

Paya Lebar Air Base also plays host to USAF VIP aircraft as well, with regular visits by Air Force One, such as during President George W. Bush&#x27;s two visits to Singapore in October 2003 and November 2006.

Air Force Two carrying Vice-President Dick Cheney also made a refuelling stop and underwent minor repairs en route from Australia in 2007.

The USAF Boeing 747-200 E-4B regularly lands at the base when the U.S. Secretary of Defense visits Singapore, as does the Boeing 757 C-32A that carries the Secretary of State.

On 14 November 2009, Air Force One carrying President Barack Obama landed at Paya Lebar Air Base to attend the APEC Singapore 2009 Summit.

On 10 June 2018, President Donald Trump landed at the airbase in the Boeing VC-25A for the 2018 North Korea–United States summit. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un landed at Changi Airport instead, on a chartered Air China Boeing 747.

On 22 August 2021, Air Force Two carrying Vice-President Kamala Harris arrived at the airbase for an official visit.

====2018 North Korea–United States summit====
PLAB was chosen to host Air Force One for the 12 June 2018 North Korea–United States summit between President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un. Although early media reports speculated that Kim&#x27;s Ilyushin Il-62 would land at PLAB, his plane landed at Singapore Changi Airport instead.

On 6 June 2018, Singapore&#x27;s aviation authorities announced temporary airspace restrictions that were put in place for parts of 11–13 June. Aircraft arriving at Singapore Changi Airport were required to reduce speed with some restrictions on runway use. Aviators were also informed to keep a distance from Paya Lebar Air Base. After the summit, Trump and Air Force One left Singapore via PLAB at 6:30 pm Singapore Time.

===Decommissioning===
The airbase is expected to be decommissioned from 2030. Throughout the 2020s, expansion works are currently ongoing at Tengah Air Base and Changi Air Base to prepare for the eventual relocation of RSAF&#x27;s assets after the closure of the airbase.

With the closure of the airbase, height restrictions imposed at Singapore&#x27;s central business district (CBD) which limits buildings to a maximum height of 280 meters unless special permissions are granted will be lifted, and the airbase&#x27;s area will be redeveloped into a new town with residential housing projects, offices, factories, and parks. Parts of the old airbase (e.g. runway) will also be integrated to this new town to conserve its heritage, with parks and museums.

==Legacy==
Being Singapore&#x27;s first major international airport, the old passenger terminal building and control tower still stands, though they now house air force units and are off-limits to the public. Nevertheless, much of the interior still remains intact and is almost completely preserved from the time it was first built. The road which used to lead to the old passenger terminal is also still known as Airport Road.

===Air Force Museum===

The RSAF maintains the Air Force Museum, which is open to the public and showcases the air force&#x27;s history and capabilities. The museum is located at 400 Airport Road, Singapore 534234 beside the airbase. It went through an upgrade and update of the exhibits in 2015.

<doc id="885480" wikidata="Q1992811" url="?curid=885480" title="The Adventures of Bayou Billy">
<text>The Adventures of Bayou Billy is an action game released by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1989 and in the PAL region in 1991. It is a revised version of the 1988 Family Computer game , which has been modified with many graphical changes and an increase in the game&#x27;s difficulty level. The game employs three play styles that were popular at the time: beat &#x27;em up, light gun shooting and racing.

==Plot==
Billy West, otherwise known as Bayou Billy, is a Crocodile Dundee-like vigilante from the bayous of Louisiana, who has fought against a local crime boss, known as Godfather Gordon. In retaliation for interfering with his smuggling operations, Gordon kidnaps Billy&#x27;s girlfriend Annabelle Lane in order to lure Billy into one final battle. Billy&#x27;s quest to save Annabelle consists of nine stages that takes him from the swamplands to Bourbon Street, as he battles Gordon&#x27;s henchmen and eventually arrives at Gordon&#x27;s estate to come face-to-face with the big boss himself.

==Gameplay==

The majority of the game follows a side-scrolling beat-&#x27;em-up format in which the player character (Billy) must engage in hand-to-hand combat against every enemy he encounters in order to proceed from one area to the next until reaching the end of each stage before his health runs out. Billy&#x27;s basic attacks consists of a punch, a kick and a jump kick performed by pressing the A and B buttons simultaneously. The player can also arm Billy with one of three melee weapons dropped by certain enemies: a throwing knife, a club and a whip. If the player picks up a new weapon while Billy is still in possession of a previous one, the new weapon will overwrite the previous one. Billy can also pick up guns, which the player can draw or withdraw at any time by pressing the Select button (when Billy is using a gun, the number next to the &quot;bullet&quot; indicator on the top portion of the screen will start flashing). Other power-ups in these stages include a chicken drumstick that refills Billy&#x27;s health and a body armor that protects Billy from enemy bullets and reduces the damage he takes from other attacks. While the majority of the enemies in the beat-&#x27;em-up stages are human bad guys, the player will occasionally fight animals as well such as crocodiles, eagles and guard dogs.

In Stages 2 and 7, the game adopts a rail shooting format viewed from a first-person perspective, which can be played with a standard controller or with an NES Zapper, depending on the mode chosen by the player before the start of the game. In these stages, the player must shoot as many gunmen as possible and then destroy the boss at the end of the stage without running out of health or ammunition. Certain enemies will drop additional ammo and health kits, as well as other power-ups such as an hourglass that gives Billy unlimited ammo for a limited period, a bulletproof vest that leaves him invulnerable for a while as well, and a star that destroys all present enemies.

In Stages 4 and 5, the player must drive Billy&#x27;s jeep through the freeway from the grasslands to the suburbs before time runs out. In these two stages, the player steers and accelerates the jeep with the d-pad, while the A and B buttons are used to launch grenades at airborne enemy vehicles and shoot at other cars in front of Billy&#x27;s jeep. These are the only stages where the player does not have a health gauge and as a result, a single collision with an enemy vehicle, bomb explosion or any other road hazard will result in a lost life. The player can pick up gasoline cans along the way to extend the time limit.

In addition to the main game mode, there&#x27;s also a practice mode featuring shorter versions of select stages in order to help players familiarize themselves with the controls for each gameplay style. Completing a practice stage will award the player with a power-up that can be used in the main game.

==Regional differences==
The game was originally released for the Famicom in Japan under the title of &quot;Mad City&quot; and was retitled &quot;The Adventures of Bayou Billy&quot; when it was converted to the NES for the international market, undergoing many extensive changes during the localization process. The NES version is harder than the Famicom version; enemies in the beat-&#x27;em-up stages are more aggressive and have more health, the player starts the shooting stages with less ammunition, and the driving stages have narrower roads. The driving stages in the Famicom version also give Billy&#x27;s jeep a health gauge, allowing it to withstand collision from enemy vehicles and road hazards, a benefit not available in the NES version. The Famicom version has four possible endings, whereas the NES version only has one.

The NES version also features many audio and visual changes. Enemy characters and backgrounds are colored differently and the game&#x27;s heroine, Annabelle, wears more revealing clothing in the NES version (having been changed from a v-neck dress to denim shorts and a midriff-revealing T-shirt). DPCM-coded voice samples were added, such as an announcer declaring the game&#x27;s title when the player starts the game and Gordon laughing between stages.
In the Japanese version, 4 different endings can be achieved by using certain operations. If played in Easy mode, Billy will save Annabelle but also comments on &quot;something lost&quot;, the game then proceeds with a notice of playing the game in a harder mode; beating the game normally results in the usual ending; beating the game but not coming to Annabelle after rescuing her will end up in a &quot;bad ending&quot; in which Annabelle leaves Billy; a fourth ending can be achieved by certain operations and in this ending, Billy and Annabelle will speak in Kansai dialect.

==Related media==
===Comic===
Archie Comics published a comic book series based on &quot;The Adventures of Bayou Billy&quot; written by Rich Margopoulos and illustrated by Amanda Conner, which lasted five bi-monthly issues dated from September 1989 to June 1990. The comic takes liberties with the plot and characterizations of the game and introduces an additional cast of supporting characters. Bayou Billy (whose full name is William Jackson West in the comic) is a bounty hunter assisted by his former military companions of Broadside, Sureshot and Tracker, as they protect the innocent from a local mob led by Giles Gordon and his two sons Rocky and Rocco (who were originally Gordon&#x27;s bodyguards in the game). Annabelle Lane (who is renamed Annabel Lee) also appears in the comic as an assistant district attorney who becomes romantically involved with Billy after being rescued from Gordon&#x27;s lackeys. The fourth issue reveals that Billy is a widower whose first wife was killed in an ordered hit by Gordon meant for him.

===Television===
&quot;Bayou Billy&quot; appears in Nintendo-themed animated TV series &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;, where the character appears in an episode titled &quot;How&#x27;s Bayou&quot;, voiced by Garry Chalk. Playing on the difficulty of its real world counterpart, &quot;Bayou Billy&quot; was said to be the one game even Captain N was unable to conquer yet. Mother Brain had Dr. Wily build a robot cat to have Duke lead Captain N to Bayou Billy&#x27;s world. Captain N ended up meeting Bayou Billy where he learned some tricks from him.

<text>We the Media is a book written by Dan Gillmor, published in 2004 by O&#x27;Reilly ().

Gillmor discusses how the proliferation of grassroots internet journalists (bloggers) has changed the way news is handled. One of the book&#x27;s main points is that a few big media corporations cannot control the news we get any longer, now that news is being published in real-time, available to everybody, via the Internet. The book received widespread praise from the demographic it covered, and mixed reviews elsewhere.

== Background ==

&quot;We the Media&quot; details how media and its consumption has changed with the introduction of online platforms. Big corporations are no longer able to control what is being published about themselves, while the &quot;former audience,&quot; as Gillmor calls it, is no longer passive. The former audience has a larger role in the consumption and production of media.

Gillmor believes the aggressive use of copyrighting in America is a cause for the lack of creativity and innovation in the states. For this reason, he has his book published for free under a creative commons. The book will be released into the public domain 14 years after publication.

== Ch. 1: From Tom Paine to Blogs and Beyond ==

&quot;Big Media&quot; has increased availability of news reception. Major broadcasting companies no longer have the mass influence over users it once had. News is now more of a conversation. News has more choices, voices, perspectives, and options. &quot;Big Media&#x27;s&quot; only strength is its depleting stocks of financial resources and their powerful presence during copyright investigations.

Early social innovators, like Thomas Paine and other early American pamphleteers and muckrakers, set the stage for successive media revolutions. The most significant being worldwide, low-cost access to internet and having their own say about what is happening in the world.

== Ch. 2: The Read-Write Web ==

David Winer developed user friendly software that would allow most people with a computer to be able to write on the web. People no longer needed an ISP account or be an expert with HTML to create web pages. With this new technology anyone could subscribe to the content of others. In the past 150 years there were two major means of communication: one to many, and one to one. Winer&#x27;s software changed this.

Today there is the addition of many to many or few to few. We use SMS for time sensitive alerts, text messages, and information. Publishing is easy with RSS. It allows the public to both blog about and keep up with current events, commentary, personals, and businesses. The internet makes the amateur the professional. There is no reliance on limited sources because the public can access information and receive events in real time.

== Ch. 3: The Gates Come Down ==

The power of big Media’s ability to advertise and conceal news or information with the rest of the world is dwindling on the brink of a new era. This grassroots media era is what’s essentially in effect here. The power of the common people united in a “truth squad&quot; is at an all-time high. They are able to gather and release information through blogs, e-mails, and journals. The public can keep a watch on corporate offices and political affairs. In the past, big media had a controlled grip on what the public had access to.

There are a number of ways for writers to get their story out others in their online communities. Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Medium and WordPress are a few of these online platforms. The days of big media are numbered due to this expanding movement of writing individually for the people.

== Ch. 4: Newsmakers Turn the Tables ==

Politicians of the future will not be able to use the media to its highest effect. In his discussion of Phil Gomes, Gillmor mentions that a large part of the success of Gomes’ strategy was the IBM AS/400. Computers made the instant transfer of materials possible. This helped Gomes achieve his marketing penetration.

The largest part of Gillmor’s focus lies in the way the current political community has yet to embrace the notion of social media. His main advice for the community at large is to make use of the media as a tool. The community can use the untapped masses connected to the other end of those networks.

== Ch. 5: The Consent of the Governed ==

The introduction of the Internet is a medium both for politicians and citizens to actively contribute to campaigns. The chapter focuses on the usage of microblogging as a more personal form of democratic interaction between the electors and the elected. Both Howard Dean and John McCain are both credited with pioneering and perfecting this grassroots medium utilization.

Ironically, the chapter predicts microblogging reaching its apex during the 2008 elections, which would feature none other than John McCain. While McCain used microblogging effectively; his opponent Barack Obama brilliantly carried out the most effective internet medium based campaign to date. Obama&#x27;s successful implementation of strategic targeted microblogging resulted in his election to the presidency over McCain.

== Ch. 6: Professional Journalist Join the Conversation ==

BBC launched iCan to get the interaction of the audience. It gives the audience a chance to be in charge of what is reported. In South Korea, OhmyNews is an example of the system where the audience can report on the news. It gives a glimpse at the future of systems like BBC’s iCan idea. The audience’s interaction is where everyone can be a reporter. They cover the issues that are not covered by the mainstream media. They also can force mainstream media to make a local issue national or global. OhmyNews “capture[s] the power of average people”.

Gillmor discusses the importance of feedback from readers. He feels as though reporters do not engage their readers if they do not acknowledge their readers&#x27; thoughts. His example is an article called the &quot;Jane’s Intelligence Review.&quot; The article details an organization wanting to know if their computer security article was on the right track. The organization posted the article on their site for users and readers to comment on. The readers responded with harsh and honest feedback, much to their surprise. They found that readers know more than the professionals.

== Ch. 7: The Former Audience Joins the Party ==

This chapter speaks on the effect that bloggers and many others have had over the years and how they have developed. Hossein Derakhshan made what Gillmor considers the first the Persian-language weblogger. Derakhshan launched his site in December 2000. His site encourages other Iranians to set up their own blogs. The blogs are a cross-section of Iranian society.

Many big companies have been trying to hide their information behind “intellectual property” rights. This has the ability to threaten Americans right to free speech. Wikipedia, which uses wiki software, allows anyone to post anything and edit any page. Being an open resource has helped it escape most vandalism and become a credible source of information.

== Ch. 8: Next Steps ==

Gillmor discusses Moore&#x27;s Law, which he mentions will have a large influence on changing new media for the better. The Pew Internet &amp; American Life found that in mid-2003, less than half of adult Internet users had used the internet to “publish their thoughts, respond to others, post pictures, share files and otherwise contribute to the explosion of content available online.” Gillmor writes how this has to change for &quot;future inventions&quot; to take hold in the upcoming digital age.

During this time, the ability to get the news you want was a hallmark of the networked world. &quot;RSS&quot; affected how individuals collected information from many different sites. It was a pioneering aspect in how new media became organized, which only increased the change of new media in the early 1990s. Another program, Technorati, was created by Dave Sifry in 2002. The Technorati API (&quot;applications programming interface&quot;) hooks one piece of software to another. Gillmor believes this program&#x27;s influence can control new media, rather than erode businesses.

== Ch. 9: Trolls, Spin, and the Boundaries of Trust ==

In this chapter, Gillmor exposes various modes of deception in the modern media. He uses eight subtopics to illustrate the concepts. These explain the distortions of perception, discuss the misleading practice of image manipulations, and the effect of anonymity on the credibility of sourcing in internet-based media.

Gillmor goes on to define and explain the effects of trolls on the media, discuss the effects of information provided by biased and motivated groups, and expresses the correcting influence of fact-checking on digital media by non-traditional media contributors. He poses the question of whether the media, influenced by the weight of the prevalent false information, will implode from the effect of lost credibility.

== Ch. 10: Here Come the Judges (and Lawyers) ==

In a society where &quot;anything goes,&quot; Gillmor warns of legal ramifications that may befall bloggers and online journalists. Legal ramifications include libel, defamation, plagiarism, forbidden links, and copyright infringement.

Even if one retracts an incorrect statement, one can still get sued for defamation and libel. Gillmor makes the point that a writer cannot libel a public figure unless he publishes with &quot;malice.&quot;

Whether or not the elements of defamation are met depends on jurisdiction as one country&#x27;s laws may differ from another&#x27;s. If a blogger writes an opinion piece about someone who resides in another country, the person in the piece can sue the blogger in their own country, regardless of the blogger&#x27;s home country. A blog&#x27;s community comments are protected under the Free-speech Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

== Ch. 11: The Empires Strike Back ==
The web&#x27;s new freedom was at first thought to create a true customer. However, as technology advanced, governments, telecommunication companies and big businesses would try to stop progress. All information sent and received had the capability of being tracked and filtered. In the mid-1990s HTTP Cookies, developed by Netscape, created privacy issues. Additionally with the expansion of the web, copyright laws no longer had a clear creator/user line.
Phone and cable companies monopolized pipe lines, not wanting to provide inter-communications to competitors. Another issue became the regulation of the airways. The U.S. licensed specific parts of the airways in the 1930s to certain government agencies and companies. The FCC Spectrum Policy Task Force. was then created.

== Ch. 12: Making Our Own News ==

In Chapter 12, Gillmor examines the power and influence that the Internet has over journalism. He states that his goal for writing the book was to persuade his audience of the consequences that journalists, newsmakers, and the news audience are suffering from in the age of technology.

Gillmor reveals that he released &quot;We the Media&quot; under a Creative Commons license. He had print copies in store and free versions on the Internet available for download. He released the book with a 14-year copyright; far less than the standard copyright, which lasts for “the life of the author, plus 75 years.”

==Epilogue==

On March 10, 2004, Dan Gillmor posted a draft of &quot;We the Media&quot; on his weblog. Together with his readers, they edited the book using the ideas contained within it to assist in the writing. In spring of 2003, the larger outline of the book was posted online with mixed reviews.

That same year, disaster struck as Gillmor’s inbox containing the myriad of edits had vanished overnight, leaving his editing in shambles. He attempted to reconstruct them using local backups, but many edits and comments were lost in doing so. Gillmor called the project afterwards &quot;in a sense, a test of the next version of journalism.&quot;

<text>The Mariner Moose is the team mascot of the Seattle Mariners, a Major League Baseball team. He is an anthropomorphic moose who mainly appears and performs during Mariners home games at T-Mobile Park; he additionally makes several hundred appearances in the community each year, at everything from hospitals to wedding receptions. His appearance has remained relatively unchanged since his introduction in 1990, making him one of the most recognizable and popular mascots throughout all of Major League Baseball.

== History ==
While the Mariner Moose was the Mariners&#x27; first full-time mascot, the team previously held a mascot competition in 1979 in response to the popularity of the San Diego Chicken. The winner of the competition was &quot;Spacey the Needle,&quot; which was a man that wore a hat resembling the top of the Space Needle while on stilts; a man in a diaper took second place. However, Spacey was plagued with mobility issues due to his stilts; the mascot was retired after only a few games. The San Diego Chicken itself was a temporary Mariners mascot for six straight games before the All-Star Game that year; his actions in one game prompted future Mariners manager Lou Piniella, then a New York Yankees player, to throw his glove at him.

In 1990, a contest for children 14 and under was held to select a mascot for the team under then-owner Jeff Smulyan, who had purchased the team from George Argyros the previous year. Out of 2,500 entries received, the club chose the &quot;Mariner Moose,&quot; originally submitted by Ammon Spiller of Bellingham, Washington, then a fifth-grader at Central Elementary School in nearby Ferndale; he and his school were each rewarded with a $1,000 check. The runner-up was &quot;Seaward the Sea Monster,&quot; proposed by Grant Weaver of Ben Franklin Elementary in Redmond; he received a $500 check as a consolation prize. Spiller and Weaver, along with their families, also received tickets for a Mariners game, as did three other finalists and their families.

The Moose made his debut during the Mariners&#x27; home opener on April 13, 1990, dancing on the field in front of a sell-out crowd at the Kingdome to the tune of &quot;The Future&#x27;s So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades&quot; by Timbuk 3. However, his introduction was not warmly received; Mariners fans repeatedly chanted, &quot;Kill the Moose,&quot; during the game. The reception remained very negative throughout the first two months of the season; not even a world record attempt on May 6 for the longest indoor flight could improve the Moose&#x27;s reputation. As a result, the team reportedly sent him to Philadelphia to take lessons from the Phillie Phanatic, the official mascot for the Philadelphia Phillies Major League Baseball team.

Rollerblading behind an ATV was commonplace for the Moose during his tenure at the Kingdome, though this performance on the stadium&#x27;s AstroTurf resulted in a notorious incident in 1995 (see below). It was a fan favorite until the Mariners moved to T-Mobile Park (then Safeco Field) in 1999 with a natural grass playing surface accompanying the place. Since then, the Moose has become quite adept at driving his own ATV around T-Mobile Park&#x27;s warning track while performing various tricks, such as performing backflips off his ATV or having water coolers emptied on him by bullpen pitchers.

In light of the 1996 United States presidential election, Nike developed a television ad campaign that year entitled &quot;Griffey in &#x27;96&quot; wherein Mariners outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. was running for President, with the Mariner Moose as his running mate.

The Mariner Moose was featured on the ballot for the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2006 and 2007.

=== Incidents ===
During the 1995 American League Division Series between the Mariners and the New York Yankees, the Moose gained national attention when, in the middle of the fifth inning in Game 4, he crashed into the outfield wall at the Kingdome while being towed on inline skates behind an ATV in the outfield. The person portraying the Moose, Brett Rhinehardt, suffered a compound fracture of his right ankle as well as a dislocated fibula. Incidentally, the Mariners&#x27; subsequent opponent in the Championship Series, the Cleveland Indians, also had their mascot, Slider, suffer an injury with torn knee ligaments in that series.

During a Mariners home game at then-Safeco Field versus the Boston Red Sox on August 5, 2007, the Mariner Moose was riding his ATV in the middle of the fifth inning when he collided with Coco Crisp, who did not notice him as he was leaving the Red Sox dugout. Crisp was clipped on the knee by the ATV and stumbled briefly, but was not angered by the incident despite the ire of some of his teammates; he even played along by feigning retaliation with a fake throw of his glove at the Moose. Despite Mariners general manager Bill Bavasi quickly apologizing to Red Sox counterpart Terry Francona, the Mariner Moose portrayer was not punished for the incident.

== Portrayers ==
The Mariner Moose was originally portrayed by Tiger Budbill, who continued to do so until the 1994 season ended with the players&#x27; strike. He subsequently worked as a singer and waiter at a restaurant in the nearby city of Kirkland, and he would go on to compete in season one of the U.S. version of The X Factor as a resident of the city of Bothell. However, he temporarily resumed the role after the ATV incident in 1995, holding it until the start of the 1996 season.

Brett Rhinehardt took over the portrayal of the Mariner Moose at the beginning of the 1995 season; after sustaining the ankle injury in the ATV crash that season, he attempted to quickly resume his duty by fashioning an old Mariner Moose costume with a cutout for his cast despite the team encouraging him not to rush his recovery. He held the role until the conclusion of the 1998 season, after which he assumed the portrayal of Gnash, the mascot of the then-new Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League.

<text>Newbury Castle is the name of an English adulterine castle built by John Marshal during The Anarchy. It is located west of the town of Newbury in the English county of Berkshire. The Castle is mentioned in L&#x27;Histoire de Guillaume le Marechal (&#x27;History of William the Marshal&#x27;) wherein it describes King Stephen as besieging the castle in 1152 and holding Marshal&#x27;s son, William Marshal, as a hostage against Newbury&#x27;s surrender. When the elder Marshal refused to comply, Stephen threatened to have the young boy catapulted over the walls. John, (&quot;that child of hell and root of all evil&quot; according to Henry of Huntingdon) responded defiantly, &quot;I have the anvils and the hammer to forge still better sons.&quot; King Stephen wasn&#x27;t so heartless though—he relented and the boy survived.

Despite appearing proudly on the town&#x27;s coat of arms, Newbury Castle does not appear to have been built in Newbury at all, but four miles away in the village of Hamstead Marshall. There, the mottes of three castles can be found, which would be consistent with the general tactics of siege warfare during this medieval period.

<doc id="885492" wikidata="Q979831" url="?curid=885492" title="Batman Returns (video games)">
<text>Batman Returns is the name of several video games for various platforms based on the 1992 film of the same name.

The Sega console versions (i.e. Sega Genesis, Sega CD, Master System and Game Gear) were published by Sega while the MS-DOS and Amiga versions were published by Konami and developed by Spirit of Discovery and Denton Designs respectively. An Atari ST version by Konami was also advertised, but never released.

== Sega ==
The Sega Genesis version of the game is a two-dimensional platforming game similar in design to Sunsoft&#x27;s 1990 game based on the previous Batman film. The Genesis version of the game was released on December 29, 1992. The Sega CD version is an expanded version of the Genesis game, and adds a number of 3D racing levels that took advantage of the graphics hardware provided by the Sega CD unit, plus improved music in the form of CD audio with a number of animations featuring original artwork instead of still photos. Both versions feature a plot based on the events of the movie starting after The Penguin kills the Ice Princess and frames Batman for the murder, as shown in the game&#x27;s introductions.

The Master System and Game Gear versions of the game are essentially identical side-scrolling platform games, but the titles were created independently of the 16-bit versions and share no design elements. This version featured a unique branched level system, allowing players to choose from an easy and difficult route. The latter typically forced players to use rope swinging to navigate over large floorless areas. The music was composed by Motohiro Kawashima under the supervision of Yuzo Koshiro, and was one of his first soundtracks for a game; he utilized Music Macro Language to program the music, with assistance from Koshiro.

== Konami ==

The DOS version of the game, published by Konami, differs considerably from the other versions, in that it was not primarily an action game, rather an adventure game.

The Amiga version of the game was a subject of considerable controversy. GameTek had, prior to the game&#x27;s release, sent a number of screenshots derived from the PC title to market the game. As such, a number of computer magazines previewed the game as direct conversion of the PC adventure. The reality, however, was very different. The game was, contrary to expectations, not a conversion of the PC title, but a side-scrolling platform game akin to the console games. It was plagued with bugs, including very inaccurate collision detection.

== Reception ==
In his review of the Genesis version, Boy Blunder of &quot;GamePro&quot; described the controls as &quot;a tad cumbersome at first, but playable after practice&quot;, and felt that they were &quot;a step down from Sunsoft&#x27;s cart&quot;. He remarked that the visuals were &quot;too muted to win an award&quot;, though said that the backgrounds were &quot;well-drawn&quot; and admired the occasional effects, particularly the &quot;bizarre diagonal scrolling in Act I&#x27;s cutaway building&quot;. He was apathetic toward the music and had a mixed response to the sound effects, explaining that &quot;some of the effects, such as the thunderstorm, are hot, but others are not. The death bleep for the enemies is particularly grating&quot;.

Sister Sinister appreciated the Game Gear version&#x27;s &quot;wonderfully elaborate and colorful&quot; graphics and varied soundtrack, though noted that Batman is &quot;small and a little hard on the eyes&quot;.

The Sega CD version received middling reviews. The Tummynator of &quot;GamePro&quot; described the graphics as &quot;unimpressive&quot;, elaborating that the backgrounds and sprites were colored with similar dark palettes, which made the game &quot;muddy and hard to see&quot;. He further described the music as &quot;average Bat bebop&quot; and the sound effects as &quot;below CD quality&quot;, and said that the three Batmobile-centered levels were the only bonus for those who have already played the Genesis version. The reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; commended the Sega CD version&#x27;s driving levels and soundtrack, but derided the side-scrolling sections as weak. The Mega-CD version was a bestseller in the UK.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the game an A and wrote: &quot;Forget about the tortured dualities of good and evil – this is a rousing, jump and-shoot-action game, whose main links with the movie are in its dark backgrounds and Tim Burton-inspired character design&quot;.

The 1992 titles together were awarded Best License of the Year by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;.

<text>Tajuan Edward &quot;Ty&quot; Law (born February 10, 1974) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback for 15 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), primarily with the New England Patriots. He played college football for the Michigan Wolverines, where he was a first-team All-American, and was selected by the Patriots in the first round of the 1995 NFL draft. During his 10 seasons in New England, he received four Pro Bowl selections and two first-team All-Pro honors. A three-time Super Bowl winner with the Patriots, Law also holds the franchise record for interceptions. Law spent his final five seasons as a member of the New York Jets, Kansas City Chiefs, and Denver Broncos, earning a fifth Pro Bowl selection with the first. Ranking 24th in NFL career interceptions, he twice led the league in interceptions during the 1998 and 2005 seasons. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2019.

==Early life==
Law attended Aliquippa High School in Aliquippa, in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, where he played football and basketball, and ran track. He played in football as a cornerback, safety, wide receiver, and running back. He was named MVP of the school&#x27;s basketball team. In 1991, he led Aliquippa to victory in the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association A-level high school football championship.

Tony Dorsett, a Hall of Fame running back, is Law&#x27;s uncle. Law spent summers in Dallas with Dorsett while he was growing up.

==College career==
Law had a three-year stint at the University of Michigan, where he lettered three years in a row (1992–94), earned first-team All-American honors from the Walter Camp Football Foundation as a junior, and was a two-time unanimous All-Big Ten Conference selection. He was on the cover of the October 3, 1994, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, though it was an ignominious honor; he is the defender over whom Colorado Buffaloes receiver Michael Westbrook is leaping on the famous Miracle at Michigan play. Following his junior year, he left Michigan to enter the 1995 NFL Draft due to financial hardship after his grandfather declared bankruptcy.

He finished his college career with 154 tackles [120 solo, 34 assist], six interceptions, and 17 passes defended.

==Professional career==
===New England Patriots===
====1995====
The New England Patriots selected Law in the first round (23rd overall) of the 1995 NFL draft. Law was the second cornerback drafted in 1995 after Fort Valley State&#x27;s Tyrone Poole. Poole later joined Law on the Patriots in 2003.

On July 20, 1995, the New England Patriots signed Law to a five-year, $5.50 million contract. Throughout training camp, Law competed to be a starting cornerback against Maurice Hurst. Head coach Bill Parcells named Law the third cornerback on the Patriots’ depth chart, behind Ricky Reynolds and Hurst.

He made his professional regular-season debut in the New England Patriots’ season-opener against the Cleveland Browns, ironically against Bill Belichick. On October 1, 1995, Law earned his first career start and made four combined tackles during a 30–17 loss at the Atlanta Falcons in week 4. He missed two games (weeks 8–9) due to an injury. Law became a starting cornerback in week 12 after the Patriots released Maurice Hurst. On November 26, 1995, Law made six combined tackles, deflected a pass, and made his first career interception against the Buffalo Bills off of Jim Kelly. In week 15, he collected a season-high eight combined tackles, broke up a pass deflection, and intercepted a pass attempt by Jets’ quarterback Boomer Esiason during a 31–28 win against the New York Jets. He made an interception in three consecutive games since taking over the starting role. In week 17, he collected a season-high eight solo tackles and made his first career sack during a 10–7 loss at the Indianapolis Colts. Law sacked Colts’ quarterback Jim Harbaugh for a six-yard loss during the first quarter. He finished his rookie season in 1995 with 47 combined tackles (40 solo), nine pass deflections, three interceptions, and one sack in 14 games and seven starts.

====1996====
Former Cleveland Browns head coach Bill Belichick became the assistant head coach for the New England Patriots in 1996. Law and Rickey Reynolds retained their roles as starting cornerbacks. On October 20, 1996, Law collected a season-high 12 combined tackles (10 solo) and deflected two passes during a 27–9 victory at the Indianapolis Colts in week 8. Law was inactive for three games (weeks 11–13) due to an injury. On December 8, 1996, Law recorded one tackle, deflected a pass, and returned an interception for his first career touchdown as the Patriots defeated the New York Jets 34–10 in week 15. Law intercepted a pass by Jets’ quarterback Glenn Foley that was intended for wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, and returned it for a 38-yard touchdown during the third quarter. In week 16, Law made seven solo tackles, a season-high three pass deflections, and intercepted two pass attempts by Troy Aikman during a 12–6 loss at the Dallas Cowboys. He finished the 1996 NFL season with 62 combined tackles (56 solo), nine pass deflections, three interceptions, and one touchdown in 13 games and 12 starts.

The New England Patriots finished first in the AFC East with an 11–5 record and earned a first-round bye. On January 5, 1997, Law started in his first career playoff game and made three combined tackles during a 28–3 victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Divisional Round. The following week, he recorded four tackles as the Patriots defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 20–6 during the AFC Championship game. On January 26, 1997, Law started in Super Bowl XXXI and made three combined tackles during a 35–21 loss against the Green Bay Packers.

====1997====
On January 31, 1997, New England Patriots’ head coach Bill Parcells resigned five days after their loss in Super Bowl XXXI. On February 3, 1997, the New England Patriots announced their decision to hire San Francisco 49ers’ defensive coordinator Pete Carroll as their new head coach.

Law returned as the number-one cornerback in 1997 and started alongside Jimmy Hitchcock. In week 15, he collected a season-high nine solo tackles during a 26–20 victory at the Jacksonville Jaguars. He started in all 16 games in 1997 and made 77 combined tackles (69 solo), 11 pass deflections, and three interceptions, and was credited with half a sack.

====1998====
Patriots’ head coach Pete Carroll named Law and Chris Canty the starting cornerbacks to begin the regular season. On September 13, 1998, Law recorded two solo tackles, three pass deflections, intercepted two passes, and returned one for a touchdown during a 29–6 win against the Indianapolis Colts in week 2. Law intercepted a pass by Colts’ quarterback Peyton Manning that was intended for tight end Marcus Pollard, and returned it for a 59-yard touchdown during the first quarter. In week 8, Law collected a season-high seven solo tackles, deflected two passes, and made one interception during a 12–9 overtime loss at the Miami Dolphins. On November 8, 1998, Law made four combined tackles and two pass deflections, and intercepted two passes by Chris Chandler as the Patriots lost 41–10 against the Atlanta Falcons in week 10. Law started in all 16 games in 1998 and recorded 70 combined tackles (60 solo), 32 pass deflections, nine interceptions, and one touchdown. Law became the first member of the New England Patriots to lead the league in interceptions and was also voted to the 1999 Pro Bowl to mark the first of his career.

====1999====
On August 21, 1999, the Patriots signed Law to a six-year, $50 million contract extension that includes a signing bonus of $14 million. On October 17, 1999, Law collected a season-high nine combined tackles and two pass deflections, and returned an interception by Dolphins’ quarterback Dan Marino for a 27-yard touchdown during the first quarter of the Patriots’ 31–30 loss against the Miami Dolphins in week 6. Law missed two games (weeks 15–16) due to a broken hand. On December 29, 1999, the New England Patriots placed Law on injured reserve due to his broken hand. He finished the season with 57 combined tackles (48 solo), nine pass deflections, two forced fumbles, two interceptions, and one touchdown.

====2000====
On January 3, 2000, New England fired head coach Pete Carroll after they finished the season with an 8–8 record. On January 27, 2000, they announced former New York Jets’ defensive coordinator Bill Belichick as their new head coach. Belichick named Law and Antonio Langham as the starting cornerback tandem to begin 2000. In week 3, he collected a season-high nine combined tackles during a 21–13 loss against the Kansas City Chiefs. On December 18, 2000, Law was stopped by U.S. Customs officials in Niagara Falls, New York, while crossing the Rainbow Bridge. During the routine inspection, officials found three whole ecstasy pills and four that were partially crushed. Law and teammates Terry Glenn and Troy Brown were returning from visiting an adult nightclub in Canada. Federal prosecutors declined to prosecute Law due to the small amount. U.S. Customs seized the drug and fined Law $700. On December 20, 2000, New England Patriots’ head coach Bill Belichick announced his decision to suspend Law for the final game of the season. He finished the season with 74 combined tackles (58 solo), 11 pass deflections, and two interceptions in 15 games and 15 starts.

====2001–2002====
The New England Patriots hired Romeo Crennel as their new defensive coordinator. Law returned as the number-one starting cornerback and started alongside Otis Smith.

Law earned his first Super Bowl ring with the Patriots in 2001. In Super Bowl XXXVI, he intercepted a Kurt Warner pass and returned it 47 yards for a touchdown, the first points of the game for the Patriots, who eventually won the game 20–17.

====2003====
Law was voted to the Pro Bowl for the second consecutive year and for the fourth time in his career after the 2003 season. In 2003, he was part of a record-breaking Patriots defense that led the NFL in four key categories - opponents’ points per game (14.9), opponents’ passer rating (56.2), interceptions (29), and passing touchdowns surrendered (11). His physical play against some of the game&#x27;s best receivers prompted the NFL to more strictly enforce the five-yard illegal contact rule on defensive backs after the 2003 season. In the AFC Championship Game against the Colts, Law intercepted three passes from Colts quarterback Peyton Manning, assisting his team to a 24–14 win and their second Super Bowl appearance in three years, where they defeated the Carolina Panthers 32–29.

====2004====
Law earned his third Super Bowl ring with the Patriots in 2004, but missed the final nine games of the season and all three of the Patriots&#x27; playoff games due to a foot injury.

On February 25, 2005, Law was released by the Patriots due to his $12.551 million cap salary. Since then, he has represented the Patriots in a few games as an honorary team captain. In 2014, he was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame.

===New York Jets (first stint)===
On August 8, 2005, the New York Jets signed Law to a three-year contract as an unrestricted free agent. The contract had incentives that could pay Law $28 million over the first three years and also has options that total $50 million over seven years. He then went on to have one of his best years there, gaining a career-high 10 interceptions. He was also the only Jet voted into the Pro Bowl (Jonathan Vilma was named to the Pro Bowl as an injury replacement to Miami&#x27;s Zach Thomas, not by means of popular vote by the fans). Law was released by the New York Jets on February 22, 2006 as the Jets were a projected $26 million over the salary cap for 2006. He was due to make $7.6 million in 2006.

===Kansas City Chiefs===

On July 25, 2006, Law signed a five-year contract worth $30 million. He reunited with coach Herman Edwards, under whom Law had played in the 2005 season hoping to strengthen the Chiefs&#x27; defense.

===New York Jets (second stint) ===
On November 10, 2008, Law agreed to terms on a one-year contract with the New York Jets. Following the end of season, the Jets once again released him on February 24, 2009.

===Denver Broncos===
Law signed with the Denver Broncos on November 7, 2009. This added to a defensive backfield that had five members over 30 years of age, with 20 Pro Bowl selections combined. His final game with the Broncos came on January 3, 2010. He finished the season with 10 tackles and one interception run back for 37 yards. He was released by the Broncos on February 24, 2010.

His time in Denver was short and uneventful, only lasting a season. It was his second choice, as he would have preferred to play in New England, but signed with Denver. Even though his last season was in Denver, Law stated, &quot;I am a Patriot for life.&quot;

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Retirement==
After retiring from the NFL, Law founded Launch Trampoline Park, a chain of entertainment facilities based around large areas of connected trampolines. Launch currently has franchised locations across New England, with one park open in Delaware. The website of its Rhode Island location reports that Law makes frequent appearances there, where he participates in games of trampoline dodgeball with customers.

On May 19, 2014, Law was announced as the 2014 Patriots Hall of Fame Inductee. He was inducted on August 1. On February 2, 2019, he was selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2019; he was inducted on August 3, 2019, in Canton, Ohio.

<doc id="885498" wikidata="Q1062492" url="?curid=885498" title="Independent circuit">
<text>In professional wrestling, the independent circuit (often shortened to the indie circuit or the indies) is the collective name of independently owned promotions which are deemed to be smaller and more regionalized than major national promotions. 

Independent promotions are essentially viewed as a minor league or farm system for the larger national promotions, as wrestlers in &quot;indie&quot; companies (especially young wrestlers just starting their careers) are usually honing their craft with the goal of being noticed and signed by a major national promotion such as WWE, All Elite Wrestling (AEW) (which also owns Ring of Honor (ROH)), or Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in the United States, Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide or Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre in Mexico, or New Japan Pro-Wrestling, Dragongate, All Japan Pro Wrestling, World Wonder Ring Stardom or the CyberFight promotions in Japan. It is also not uncommon for veteran wrestlers who have had past tenures with major promotions to appear on independent shows, either as special attractions or as a way to prolong their careers.

==Origins==
The &quot;indie&quot; scene in the United States dates back to the days of regional territories. When a promoter ran opposition in even one town controlled by a National Wrestling Alliance sanctioned territory, they were often called an &quot;outlaw&quot; territory. This is considered by some to be a forerunner to indies since some stars of the past got their start in these low quality local rivals to the big regional territories.

The modern definition of the independent circuit came about in the middle to late 1980s and fully formed and flourished after 1990. These promotions initially sought to revive the feel of old school territorial wrestling after former territories either went national, such as WWF, went out of business, or eventually did both, such as WCW. Several indies did in fact manage to tour different towns within a region and maintain a consistent schedule.

After Vince McMahon, seeking regulatory relief, gave in 1989 testimony in front of the New Jersey State Athletic Commission where he publicly admitted pro wrestling was in fact a sports-based entertainment, rather than a true athletic competition, many state athletic commissions stopped regulating wrestling. This obviated the need for complying with many expensive requirements, such as the need for an on-site ambulance and trained emergency medical personnel at each bout. After the business was thus exposed and deregulated, just about anyone could be a promoter or a wrestler since no licensing beyond a business license was then required. Many thought they could save money by holding shows in lesser towns and smaller arenas with little to no televised exposure, leading to many shows being held only once a week or once a month in local towns.
==By country==

===United States===

Independent promotions are usually local in focus and, lacking national TV contracts, are much more dependent on revenue from house show attendance. Due to their lower budgets, most independent promotions offer low salaries (it is not unusual for a wrestler to work for free due to the fact most promoters can only afford to pay well-known talent). Most cannot afford to regularly rent large venues, and would not be able to attract a large enough crowd to fill such a venue were they able to do so. Instead, they make use of any almost open space (such as fields, ballrooms, or gymnasiums) to put on their performances. Some independent promotions are attached to professional wrestling schools, serving as a venue for students to gain experience in front of an audience. As independent matches are seldom televised, indie wrestlers who have not already gained recognition in other promotions tend to remain in obscurity. However, scouts from major promotions attend indie shows, and an indie wrestler who makes a good impression may be offered a developmental or even a full-professional contract.

The advent of the Internet has allowed independent wrestlers and promotions to reach a wider audience, and it is possible for wrestlers regularly working the indie circuit to gain some measure of fame among wrestling fans online. Additionally, some of the more successful indies have video distribution deals, giving them an additional source of income and allowing them to reach a larger audience outside of their local areas.

===Canada===


===Australia===

Unlike the North American or Japanese products which have large, globally renowned organisations such as WWE and New Japan Pro-Wrestling with several hundred smaller promotions, Australia only has approximately 30 smaller independent circuit promotions which exist in all but one of the states and territories, that being the Northern Territory. Tours from the North American product are regularly sold out in capital cities such as Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Brisbane.

===Mexico===

Lucha libre has many more independent wrestlers in proportion to the rest of North America, because of the weight classes prevalent in the Mexican league system as well as its emphasis on multiple person tag matches; just about anyone with ability can emerge from an independent promotion into either AAA or Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre and be a champion there. Independent Mexican wrestlers may use a lot of gimmicks, including some that may be based on copyrighted characters from American television shows, such as &quot;Thundercats&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot;. (These gimmicks are often changed if the wrestler playing them makes it into AAA or CMLL; the most prominent example of non-compliance with this method is midget wrestler Chucky from AAA, whose gimmick is based on the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; movies.)

===Japan===

Until 1984, no independent puroresu promotion per se existed in Japan; potential talent went directly into the training dojos of either New Japan Pro-Wrestling or All Japan Pro Wrestling. (International Wrestling Enterprise also was a third-party promotion until 1981.) The advent of the Japanese Universal Wrestling Federation offered a long-sought third alternative.

From 1986 to 1988 the Japanese system went back to the two-promotion system, but then the UWF was reformed and another promotion, Pioneer Senshi, was started. Because of Japanese societal mores which implied that a wrestler was a lifelong employee of a company and thus identified with it wherever he went, neither AJPW nor NJPW made an effort to acquire wrestlers trained in other promotions; wrestlers from the major promotions who left, such as Genichiro Tenryu, Gran Hamada, Yoshiaki Fujiwara, Akira Maeda, Atsushi Onita, and Nobuhiko Takada had to start their own independent promotions in order to keep themselves in the limelight (Wrestling Association &quot;R&quot;, Universal Lucha Libre, Pro Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi, Fighting Network Rings, Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, and Hustle respectively) .

As the 1990s ended, though, things began to change. Independent promotions began gaining more prominence as they were featured in major specialized media such as &quot;Shukan Puroresu&quot; and &quot;Shukan Gong&quot; magazines. With the death of Giant Baba and retirement of Antonio Inoki, which effectively broke their control over the promotions they founded, the major promotions began looking to the smaller promotions for talent.

In 2000, the first major signing from an independent, Minoru Tanaka by NJPW from BattlARTS, took place; soon after NJPW stocked the junior heavyweight division with independent talent such as Masayuki Naruse, Tiger Mask, Gedo, and Jado. On the same year, following the Pro Wrestling Noah split, AJPW was forced to fill its ranks with independent talent; Nobutaka Araya, Shigeo Okumura and Mitsuya Nagai signed up (Araya is the only one who remains, but other signings since then have been Kaz Hayashi, Tomoaki Honma, Hideki Hosaka, and Ryuji Hijikata.)

Noah admitted one wrestler from the independents, Daisuke Ikeda, to its ranks as well (Ikeda has since left, but other wrestlers from the independents that were signed included Akitoshi Saito, Takahiro Suwa, and Taiji Ishimori). Although AJPW, NJPW, and Noah remain committed to their dojos, the reliance on independents is growing as obscure talent is recognized for its ability.

===United Kingdom===

For most of the years of ITV&#x27;s coverage of British Wrestling, the dominant promoter in the United Kingdom was the Joint Promotions cartel, which was originally modelled on the NWA and later amalgamated into a single company. Nonetheless, throughout this period, untelevised alternative promotions flourished with at least one significant competitor to Joint for live shows.

Initially the main rival was the former dominant promotion in the territory, Atholl Oakley&#x27;s BWA. By the time of its demise, wrestler/promoter Paul Lincoln had established himself as a major promoter with shows featuring himself as headline heel. In 1958, when Bert Assirati was stripped of the British Heavyweight Championship, Lincoln formed the BWF alliance of promoters to support Assirati&#x27;s claim, later recognising Shirley Crabtree as champion. Lincoln&#x27;s BWF was eventually bought out into Joint in 1970.

Welsh promoter Orig Williams also used the BWF name, promoting from the late 1960s up until the early 2000s and then sporadically until his death in 2009. From 1982 to 1995, Williams had a Welsh language TV wrestling show &quot;Reslo&quot; on S4C. Brian Dixon, a referee for Williams, set up his own company Wrestling Enterprises of Birkenhead later renamed All Star Wrestling . An alliance with promoter and former top star Jackie Pallo failed to prevent Joint gaining a five-year extension on its TV wrestling monopoly from January 1982 to December 1986.

However, by the mid-1980s Dixon had won over many wrestlers and fans from Joint who were tired of the Big Daddy-orientated direction of Joint. Eventually this culminated in All Star gaining a TV show on satellite channel Screensport and later, a slice of ITV&#x27;s coverage from 1987 until the end of ITV wrestling in 1988. By the end of this period, All Star had effectively replaced Joint (by now owned by Max Crabtree, brother of Shirley) as the dominant promotion in the UK.

Joint, renamed Ring Wrestling Stars in 1991, dwindled down before closing with Crabtree&#x27;s retirement in 1995, All Star has continued to be the dominant non-import live promotion in the UK up to the present day. Its principal competitors since that time have been Scott Conway&#x27;s TWA, John Freemantle&#x27;s Premier Promotions, RBW and LDN Wrestling. Since the 1990s there have also been numerous American-style &quot;New School&quot; promotions.

<doc id="885501" wikidata="Q106771302" url="?curid=885501" title="List of jet aircraft of World War II">
<text>World War II was the first war in which jet aircraft participated in combat with examples being used on both sides of the conflict during the latter stages of the war. The first successful jet aircraft, the Heinkel He 178, flew only five days before the war started on 1 September 1939. By the end of the conflict on 2 September 1945 Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States all had operational turbojet-powered fighter aircraft while Japan had produced, but not used, motorjet-powered kamikaze aircraft, and had tested and ordered into production conventional jets. Italy and the Soviet Union had both tested motorjet aircraft which had turbines powered by piston engines and the latter had also equipped several types of conventional piston-powered fighter aircraft with auxiliary ramjet engines for testing purposes. Germany was the only country to use jet-powered bombers operationally during the war.

This list includes only aircraft powered by turbine engines, either on their own or as part of mixed-power arrangements. Rocket-powered aircraft are not included, nor are aircraft that only flew following the end of the war. Aircraft which were designed but not constructed are also excluded.
Production figures for aircraft used postwar include examples built after the war ended, of the same versions already flying during the war.

<doc id="885504" wikidata="Q715146" url="?curid=885504" title="Giuseppe Tucci">
<text>Giuseppe Tucci (; 5 June 1894 – 5 April 1984) was an Italian orientalist, Indologist and scholar of East Asian studies, specializing in Tibetan culture and the history of Buddhism. During its zenith, Tucci was a supporter of Italian fascism, and he used idealized portrayals of Asian traditions to support Italian ideological campaigns. Tucci was fluent in several European languages, Sanskrit, Bengali, Pali, Prakrit, Chinese and Tibetan and he taught at the University of Rome La Sapienza until his death. He is considered one of the founders of the field of Buddhist studies.

==Life and work==

===Education and background===
He was born to a middle-class Italian family (from Apulia) in Macerata, Marche, and thrived academically. He taught himself Hebrew, Chinese and Sanskrit before even going to university and in 1911, aged only 18, he published a collection of Latin inscriptions in the prestigious &quot;Zeitschrift des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts&quot;. He completed his studies at the University of Rome in 1919, where his studies were repeatedly interrupted as a result of World War I.

After graduating, he traveled to India and settled down at the Visva-Bharati University, founded by the Bengali poet and Nobel Laureate, Rabindranath Tagore. There he studied Buddhism, Tibetan and Bengali, and also taught Italian and Chinese. He also studied and taught at Dhaka University, the University of Benares and Calcutta University. He remained in India until 1931, when he returned to Italy.

===Scholarship and reputation===

He was Italy&#x27;s foremost scholar of the East, with such diverse research interests ranging from ancient Iranian religion to Indian and Chinese philosophy. He taught primarily at the University of Rome but was a visiting scholar at institutions throughout Europe and Asia. In 1931, the University of Naples &quot;L&#x27;Orientale&quot; made him its first Chair of Chinese Language and Literature. In 1933 he promoted the foundation the - IsMEO (Istituto italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente), based in Rome. The IsMEO was established as a &quot;Moral body directly depending on Mussolini&quot;. Until 1945, when the IsMEO was closed, Gentile was its president and Tucci was its managing vice-president and, later, director of the courses of languages.

Tucci officially visited Japan for the first time in November 1936, and remained there for over two months until January 1937, when he attended at the opening of the Italian-Japanese Institute (Istituto Italo-nipponico) in Tokyo. Tucci traveled all over Japan giving lectures on Tibet and &quot;racial purity&quot;.

He organised several pioneering archaeological digs throughout Asia, such as in Swat in Pakistan, Ghazni in Afghanistan, Persepolis in Iran and in the Himalayas. In 1948 he led an expedition into Tibet accompanied by Tenzing Norgay who was to summit Everest 5 years later. According to Norgay&#x27;s account in &quot;Man of Everest&quot; Tucci was an excitable and energetic man on his eighth visit to the country. The trip included an audience with the Dalai Lama in the Potala Palace and bumping into Heinrich Harrer author of &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;. He was also the promoter of the National Museum of Oriental Art. In 1978 he received the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding, in 1979 the Balzan Prize for History (ex aequo with Ernest Labrousse). During the course of his life, he wrote over 360 books and articles.

===Politics===
Tucci was a supporter of Italian Fascism and Benito Mussolini. His collaboration began in his student days at the University of Rome, where he first met Giovanni Gentile (at the time, Professor of the History of Philosophy and already a close friend and collaborator of Mussolini), and continued right up to Gentile&#x27;s assassination in 1944, which led to the forced closure of IsMEO for over two years until 1947. In November 1936 - January 1937 he was the representative of Mussolini in Japan, where he was sent to improve the diplomatic relations between Italy and Japan and to make Fascist propaganda. On 27 April 1937 he gave a speech on the radio in Japanese on Mussolini&#x27;s behalf. In this country his action paved the way to the inclusion of Italy to the Anti-Comintern Pact (6 November 1937). Tucci was a member of the editorial board of an Italian propaganda magazine, &quot;Yamato&quot;, which was started in 1941 to improve the political alliance of Italy and Japan.

He wrote popular articles for the Italian state that decried the rationalism of industrialized 1930s–1940s Europe and expressed a yearning for a more authentic existence in touch with nature, which he claimed could be found in Asia. According to the Tibetologist Donald S. Lopez, &quot;For Tucci, Tibet was an ecological paradise and timeless utopia into which industrialized Europe figuratively could escape and find peace, a cure for western ills, and from which Europe could find its own pristine past to which to return.&quot; Hugh Richardson and David Snellgrove in the dedication of their 1968 book of &quot;A Cultural History of Tibet&quot; wrote, &quot;To Giuseppe Tucci who has revealed so many hidden treasures of Tibet life, art and learning.&quot; A fictional Tucci, played by Marcel Iureș, appears as a character in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;Youth Without Youth&quot;.

===Death===
Tucci died in San Polo dei Cavalieri, near Rome, in 1984.

<doc id="885505" wikidata="Q2383859" url="?curid=885505" title="The Goonies II">
<text>is an adventure platform video game developed and published by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released on March 18, 1987 in Japan, November in North America, and on December 19, 1988 in Europe. It is a sequel to a prior &quot;Goonies&quot; video game released on the Family Computer in Japan, which was only available in North America on Nintendo VS. System arcade units.

==Gameplay==
&quot;The Goonies II&quot; is considered an early example of an exploration platform game, with open level design similar to &quot;Pitfall II: Lost Caverns&quot; and &quot;Castlevania II: Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot;. The game features two modes of play: platform and first-person. Most of the game is played as the former as the player works through a non-linear map. The player moves Mikey to new areas of the map by ladders or doors that may act as warp zones. Several different types of zones are found in the game, each with distinct enemies, graphics and music. The Fratelli family (Jake, Francis, Cousin Pipsqueak, and Ma Fratelli) will frequently appear to pursue Mikey; with the exception of Pipsqueak who vanishes when hit, they can be stunned briefly with attacks but cannot be defeated.

When the player exits the platform screen by entering a door, the game shifts to a first-person mode. Using a command menu similar to &quot;Shadowgate&quot; (released a few months after &quot;The Goonies II&quot;), the player explores the area by navigating through rooms, searching for hidden items and interacting with non-player characters. The items the player finds may be useful in the platform screens (such as weapons or transceivers) or within the rooms themselves (such as the candle, key and ladder). The player will find the six Goonies and eventually Annie in cells in this mode. Each rescued Goonie increases Mikey&#x27;s health, and all six must be rescued before Annie can be freed.

There are a number of weapons the player can use, and the player can equip both a primary and secondary weapon. Mikey can use three primary weapons: the yo-yo, a short-range weapon with limited power; the slingshot, a ranged, ammunition-based weapon; and the boomerang, a slower ranged weapon with unlimited use. The bomb and molotov cocktail are the two secondary weapons the player can use, and the player can increase Mikey&#x27;s carrying capacity by finding additional cases of them. These are explosive weapons that have a small blast radius and can damage Mikey if he is in range; the bomb can also reveal hidden doors. There are also two performance boosting shoes in the game; the spring shoes increase Mikey&#x27;s jumping ability and are required to reach certain areas of the map, and the hyper shoes increase Mikey&#x27;s speed and make some areas more easily accessible. The player must find and use a diving suit in order to reach underwater areas of the hideout; this item limits Mikey to using a harpoon gun and bombs as his weapons.

Various items found throughout the maze allow Mikey to reach different areas of the map include a ladder, a diving suit, and even glasses which can reveal hidden doors.

What the player has to do in order to obtain certain vital items is sometimes obscure. For example, the candle is obtained when Mikey hits a specific old woman five times in a row.

An item called a Magic Locator Device can lead Mikey to a hidden Goonie, represented by a blue dot on the map. Although Mikey can find and locate up to six Magic Locator Devices, when one Goonie is rescued all collected Magic Locator Devices will vanish, but they may be recollected if there are remaining Goonies.

Mikey loses one life whenever his health meter is completely drained or he falls off the bottom edge of the screen. When all lives are lost, the game is over and the player receives a password that can be used to resume play at a later time, retaining all items and progress to that point.

==Reception==
The game received generally positive reviews upon release. &quot;Famitsu&quot; rated the game 26 out of 40. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; rated the game 81% in 1989.

It is listed as 16th on Gamasutra&#x27;s list of 20 open world games. There, it is described as considerably less difficult than predecessor &quot;The Goonies&quot; though it still &quot;basically requires a strategy guide to finish&quot;. Gameplay progression is based partially upon implicit clues, such as the strategic absence of things, making a player to think that the occasional discovery is &quot;the most awesome thing in the world&quot;.

<doc id="885509" wikidata="Q522099" url="?curid=885509" title="Wide Field and Planetary Camera">
<text>The Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WFPC) (pronounced as wiffpick (Operators of the WFPC1 were known as &quot;whiff-pickers&quot;)) was a camera installed on the Hubble Space Telescope launched in April 1990 and operated until December 1993. It was one of the instruments on Hubble at launch, but its functionality was severely impaired by the defects of the main mirror optics which afflicted the telescope. However, it produced uniquely valuable high resolution images of relatively bright astronomical objects, allowing for a number of discoveries to be made by HST even in its aberrated condition.

WFPC was proposed by James A. Westphal, a professor of planetary science at Caltech, and was designed, constructed, and managed by JPL. At the time it was proposed, 1976, CCDs had barely been used for astronomical imaging, though the first KH-11 KENNEN reconnaissance satellite equipped with CCDs for imaging was launched in December 1976. The high sensitivity offered such promise that many astronomers strongly argued that CCDs should be considered for Hubble Space Telescope instrumentation.

This first WFPC consisted of two separate cameras, each comprising 4 800x800 pixel Texas Instruments CCDs arranged to cover a contiguous field of view. The Wide Field camera had a 0.1 arcsecond per pixel resolution and was intended for the panoramic observations of faint sources at the cost of angular resolution. The Planetary Camera had a 0.043 arcsecond per pixel resolution and was intended for high-resolution observations. Selection between the two cameras was done with a four-facetted pyramid that rotated by 45 degrees.

As part of the corrective service mission (STS-61 in December 1993) the WFPC was swapped out for a replacement version. The Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 improved on its predecessor and incorporated corrective optics needed to overcome the main mirror defect. To avoid potential confusion, the WFPC is now most commonly referred to as WFPC1.

On its return to Earth, the WFPC was disassembled and parts of it were used in Wide Field Camera 3, which was installed in Hubble on May 14, 2009, as part of Servicing Mission 4, replacing WFPC2.

==Specifications==
The instrument had two different cameras within, the Wide Field and the Planetary Camera. The Wide Field camera had a wider field of view compared to the Planetary Camera.

;Specifications:
*Detection range, light wavelengths 115 to 1000 nm
*For the Wide Field Camera
**Field of View 2.6 x 2.6 arcminutes
**f/12.9 
*For the Planetary Camera
**Field of View 66 x 66 arcseconds
**f/30 
**Smallest pixel scale 0.043 arcsecond (unit of degree)

==First light image==

==Replacement==
Although there was nothing known to be wrong with this instrument, the spherical aberration in HST&#x27;s mirror severely limited the performance. 
WFPC was replaced by the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 which included its own internal corrective optics. WFPC2 was replaced by the Wide Field Camera 3 in 2009. After return to Earth, WFPC was disassembled and its parts cannibalized to make WFC3.

<text>Burnie is the mascot of the Miami Heat, the NBA basketball team since 1988. Burnie is a rough, anthropomorphic depiction of the fireball featured on the team&#x27;s logo.

==Appearance==
The Burnie costume is a full-body suit. The body is orange fur, with orange feathers for hair. The &quot;nose&quot; is a green basketball. Burnie wears number 0 (or 00) for the Heat, typically in a black uniform, although he has also worn the Heat&#x27;s red and white jerseys during playoff promotions. He also sometimes wears a white team T-shirt.

During the 2012 NBA Playoffs, in accord with the team&#x27;s &quot;White Hot Playoffs&quot; theme, Burnie&#x27;s costume temporarily changed to an all-white version of the same suit, with black trim around the jersey&#x27;s text.

On June 10, 2023 Mixed martial artist Conor McGregor appeared at Game Four of the 2023 NBA Finals in Miami, Florida, to promote his pain relief spray in a planned skit with Burnie. McGregor proceeded to punch the man wearing the mascot costume once and then again when the man was on the ground, and subsequently the man was treated in a hospital emergency room. Most of the crowd in attendance booed McGregor for his actions. On June 13, three days after the incident, McGregor clarified that &quot;it was a skit,&quot; and that &quot;and all is well&quot; between the two.

==Legal problems==
Burnie was sued in 1994 during an exhibition game in Puerto Rico. Burnie selected a woman from the audience, dragged her by the feet, and danced on the court with her during a time-out. The woman turned out to be the wife of a federal judge. The woman pulled away from Burnie and fell. Burnie faced 20 years in jail after being charged with aggravated assault and battery. Burnie was also sued prior for US$1 million due to the emotional distress the woman went through. The media ridiculed the case, and she appeared several times on late-night television. The case was settled for $50,000.

Burnie&#x27;s hijinks also led to another lawsuit in March 2015 and March 2017. On both occasions, people were injured by Burnie while he was performing. The same lawyer represented the two clients on the two occasions and both cases were settled. Both agreements remain confidential.

<doc id="885515" wikidata="Q1439988" url="?curid=885515" title="Karate Champ">
<text>, originally known as , is a fighting game developed by Technōs Japan and released in arcades by Data East in 1984. A variety of moves can be performed using the dual-joystick controls using a best-of-three matches format like later fighting games. The game was commercially successful, especially in the United States where it was the highest-grossing arcade game of 1985 and the best-selling home computer game up until 1989. &quot;Karate Champ&quot; established and popularized the one-on-one fighting game genre, for which it is considered one of the most influential games of all time.

An updated version that allows two players the option to compete against each other was released in 1984 under the title , featuring a multiplayer mode and more varied gameplay. It was released for the arcades shortly after the original during the same year, also published by Data East. This version was released internationally as &quot;Karate Champ&quot; (the original single-player version was exclusive to Japan), and would serve as the basis for the home versions of &quot;Karate Champ&quot;.

==Gameplay==
Using two joysticks, players can execute 24 moves. Gameplay consists of a two dimensional fight between the first karateka wearing a white gi who is controlled by player one and the second karateka wearing a red gi who is controlled by either player two or the CPU, followed by various bonus rounds for the successful player. This pattern repeats itself in the next, more challenging round set against a new background, the first level being a dojo and all following levels taking place at the same tournament stadium.

Unlike most later fighting games, there is no health bar or hit point system. A hit successfully landed ends the round and earns the hitter either one point or half point (along with a numeric score for the top ten, but this has no effect on winning a match). The first to score two points is the winner. If the player loses a battle, the game ends. The game features digitized speech for the judge to call out such phrases as &quot;Half point&quot; or &quot;Full point&quot;. The speech is in Japanese in the original version.

=== &quot;Player vs Player&quot; ===
&quot;Karate Champ — Player vs Player&quot; is distinguished from the initial &quot;Karate Champ&quot; by the addition of a player versus player mode. It is very similar to the original in the sense that they use the same hardware, improved speech, some new sprites and title screen, and the gameplay mechanics are basically the same.

&quot;Player vs Player&quot; has the characters fighting it out over girls in twelve different locations around the world (similar to the later SNK&#x27;s &quot;Street Smart&quot;). A scene runs as a best out of three rounds competition for one girl. After every competition, the player has a chance to earn bonus points by evading a series of potted plants flying at the player, kicking through a series of boards and stopping a charging bull. The locations of the game are: A harbor, a garden with a view of Mount Fuji, a bamboo forest, on a tree trunk over a chasm, on the stern of a Japanese registered ship, on the side of a road or runway, Holland with windmills, a big city, a North American desert with Indian tipis, a Japanese garden, a dojo, and finally a forest path at night. Afterwards, the game returns to the first scene for a second loop. Completing all 12 scenes again completes the game.

==Versions and re-releases==
&quot;Karate Champ&quot; was converted to the Apple II and the Commodore 64 by Berkeley Softworks. Data East began publishing the home versions in the USA on October 12, 1985. The NES version was released in North America in December 1986. Like the home computer versions, the NES conversion was inspired by the &quot;Player vs. Player&quot; edition of the arcade game, this version was later released in Japan for the Disk System on July 22, 1988, but never made it to the cartridge-based Family Computer. Data East published this version of the game, both in North America and Japan.

An emulation of the arcade version was released by Hamster for the PlayStation 2 as part of its &quot;Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono&quot; lineup. Only the original game was included (the &quot;Player vs. Player&quot; version being ignored from the compilation). The emulated version from Hamster was re-released in 2015 for the PlayStation 4 on the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; compilation which, unlike &quot;Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono&quot;, was officially distributed outside of Japan.

In 2010, it was released on the iPhone platform by developer Revolutionary Concepts. Although visually identical to the 1984 arcade edition of &quot;Karate Champ — Player vs Player&quot;, the iPhone version is actually a remake rather than an emulation, as it includes new features such as a difficulty mode as well as the ability for players to compete through a gaming network via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The game was also released for the iPad under the title Karate Champ XL, again developed by Revolutionary Concepts. &quot;Karate Champ XL&quot; is basically the same game as the iPhone&#x27;s &quot;Karate Champ&quot;, but with additional attributes over its phone counterpart such as a split-screen option.

The arcade version and the NES version were released in 2018 by Dreamgear LLC under its &quot;My Arcade&quot; brand. The arcade version of &quot;Karate Champ&quot; is part of a compilation released in the shape of a mini arcade cabinet featuring 34 Data East games. The NES version was released both as a standalone mini arcade cabinet and in a handheld device that includes 300 built-in games. In the case of the NES version, the referee&#x27;s digital voice was removed and the music tracks were replaced. The arcade version is unedited. Since My Arcade&#x27;s releases are single-player only, the two-player mode was removed from the NES version, and the &quot;Karate Champ — Player vs Player&quot; edition was not included in the compilation of 34 arcade games.

The NES version returned as part of the &quot;Data East Collection 1&quot; set for the Evercade handheld console. Except for the removal of the Nintendo license on the game&#x27;s titlescreen, the re-release is identical to the 1986 original with all soundtracks and digital voice intact as well as the two-player mode.

==Reception==
===Arcade===
&quot;Karate Champ&quot; was a commercial blockbuster, selling 10,000 arcade cabinets within two months of release and becoming Data East&#x27;s best-selling arcade game of all time. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Karate Champ&quot; on their August 1, 1984 issue as being the second-most-successful table arcade unit of the month, before becoming the top-grossing table arcade cabinet by August 15, 1984. &quot;Game Machine&quot; also listed &quot;Karate Champ — Player vs Player&quot; on their November 1, 1984 issue as being the sixth-most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

In North America, it was among the most successful arcade games in 1984, generating significant sales. In the United States, &quot;Karate Champ&quot; had shipped 30,000 arcade units by April 1985. It was the top-grossing arcade game during Summer 1985, and the fourth-top-grossing upright arcade cabinet on the monthly &quot;RePlay&quot; charts in November 1985, when each cabinet was selling for about $2,400 and earning an average coin drop revenue of $200 per week. It ended the year as the highest-grossing arcade game of 1985, and the year&#x27;s highest-grossing game in route/street locations. In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked the game 91st on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot; list.

===Home computers===
On home computers in the United States, Data East&#x27;s &quot;Karate Champ&quot; floppy disk received a &quot;Gold Award&quot; from the Software Publishers Association (SPA) in July 1987 for sales above 100,000 units, then a &quot;Platinum Award&quot; for over 250,000 sales in February 1988, and then a &quot;Diamond Award&quot; for sales above 500,000 units in January 1989. It was the first game to receive the &quot;Diamond Award&quot; from the SPA, and it was one of the top two best-selling computer games in the United States (along with &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;) up until June 1989.

Rick Teverbaugh reviewed the home computer version for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, stating the game is &quot;fast-paced&quot; and &quot;the graphics are very good&quot; but &quot;my only complaint is that some of the in-match options are counters for a move of your opponent, but there often isn&#x27;t any time for those reactions&quot;. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; opined that the Commodore 64 version &quot;isn&#x27;t quite as electrifying as the arcade version, but it&#x27;s an entertaining action-strategy test&quot;. The magazine concluded that &quot;the learning curve is steep, but ... when the joysticks are in the hands of two practiced gamers, it is one of the most exciting games to hit the computer screen in a long time&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Karate Champ&quot; inspired numerous martial arts games. Its release was followed by a wave of karate and kung fu games attempting to capitalize on its success. It is credited with establishing and popularizing the one-on-one fighting game genre, for which &quot;IGN&quot; listed it as one of the top ten most influential games of all time. Many of the mainstays in the fighting game genre, such as the best-of-three format, specific control inputs to pull off special moves, and bonus rounds after a specific number of victories, were established by this game. The &quot;Player vs Player&quot; edition of &quot;Karate Champ&quot; was also the first fighting game to allow two players to fight each other.

&quot;Karate Champ&quot; influenced titles such as Konami&#x27;s &quot;Yie Ar Kung-Fu&quot; (1985), Beam Software&#x27;s &quot;The Way of the Exploding Fist&quot; (1985), and other fighting games. John Tobias cited &quot;Karate Champ&quot; as the primary inspiration for the gameplay of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992).

In 1985, Data East began taking legal action against counterfeit arcade manufacturers, both in Japan and internationally. Data East later brought suit against Epyx alleging copyright infringement for its 1986 game &quot;World Karate Championship&quot;. The case, &quot;Data East USA, Inc. v. Epyx, Inc.&quot;, went to the Ninth Circuit Court, where it was held that the typical purchaser of the games would not find them substantially similar. &quot;Karate Champ&quot; was again involved in a later case, &quot;Capcom U.S.A. Inc. v. Data East Corp.&quot;, in Data East&#x27;s defence over Capcom&#x27;s allegations of &quot;Fighter&#x27;s History&quot; (1993) plagiarizing &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; (1991).

<text>The High Speed Photometer (HSP) is a scientific instrument formerly installed on the Hubble Space Telescope. The HSP was designed to measure the brightness and polarity of rapidly varying celestial objects. It could observe in ultraviolet, visible light, and near infrared at a rate of one measurement per 10 microseconds. The design was novel in that despite being able to view through a variety of filters and apertures, it had no moving parts &quot;except for electrons&quot; as principal investigator Prof. Robert Bless was fond of saying. Filter and aperture selection was accomplished using image dissector tubes and the HST pointing system. It was functional from launch in 1990 until it was removed at the end of 1993, and it helped diagnose an issue with the Hubble&#x27;s primary mirror.

The HSP was one of the instruments on Hubble at launch. Its primary mission was compromised by the optical problems with the telescope, although some projects were still successful. During the first servicing mission, in December 1993, it was replaced by the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR), which corrected the optical problem for the remaining instruments.

The principal investigator for the instrument was Dr. Robert C. Bless. Dr. Bless died in 2015, and his contributions to the Hubble Space Telescope and the HSP instrument were noted in news media. He worked at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and the HSP was the lightest and least expensive of the launch instruments.

The HSP instrument is located as of 2015 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison&#x27;s Space Place.

It was scientifically active during its period of use, an example of observations taken with the instrument is ultraviolet photometry of Nova Cygni 1992.

<doc id="885532" wikidata="Q11706236" url="?curid=885532" title="Kermesse (festival)">
<text>Kermesse, or kermis, or kirmess, is an outdoor fair or festival usually organized for charitable purposes. 
The term was derived from &#x27;kerk&#x27; (church) and &#x27;mis&#x27; (mass) in the original Dutch language term, and was borrowed in English, French, Spanish and many other languages. It originally denoted a mass and patronal festival held on the anniversary of the foundation of a church (or the parish) and in honour of the patron saint. Such celebrations were regularly held in the Low Countries, in Central Europe and also in northern France, and were accompanied by feasting, dancing and competitions of all kinds. The Kirchweih is the German equivalent, while church ale was a name of similar festivals in England. Many Catholic churches (parishes) still have patronal festivals of some sort for the anniversary of the church&#x27;s founding, or the feast day of the saint it is dedicated to.

The kermesse became a common subject in Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting in the 16th century, though many paintings called by the name were probably intended to depict village weddings.

==History==

Arguably the first kermesse was an annual parade to mark the events of the Brussels massacre of 1370 (some sources say 1369) in Brussels, when the entire Jewish population of the city were burnt alive or expelled after being accused of profaning a basket of communion hosts, which were said to have bled when stabbed. According to one source, those Jewish residents who could prove that they did not profane the hosts were not killed, but were merely banished from Brussels.

These festivities still survive in the form of funfairs, while the old allegorical representations are now uncommon. Whereas nearly every village has a &quot;kermis&quot; once or twice a year, the large &quot;Zuidfoor&quot; or &quot;Foire du Midi&quot; (South Fair) of Brussels and &quot;Sinksenfoor&quot; (Whitsun Fair) of Antwerp attract many visitors during several weeks. The funfair on the &quot;Vrijdagmarkt&quot; in Ghent coincides with the 10-day long &quot;Gentse Feesten&quot; (Ghent Festivities) which are held across the entire inner city around the 21st of July (Belgian national holiday).

The standard Dutch language expression &quot;Vlaamse kermis&quot; (Flemish kermesse) once referred to the local village &quot;kermesse&quot; (as pronounced in the former County of Flanders) though its modern usage is mainly limited to privately organized fairs open to the public, often for fund-raising, such as by schools or youth organisations in the Flemish Region.

The crew of the Dutch ship Gelderland used the names &quot;griff-eendt&quot; and &quot;kermisgans&quot; for the dodo in 1598, in reference to fowl fattened for the Kermesse festival, which was held the day after they anchored on Mauritius.

==In art==

In Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting, continuing into the Baroque period especially in the south, Kermesse scenes were a popular genre in painting. These typically show village festivities (perhaps in fact after a wedding or similar) with a few dozen figures dancing, drinking, and often flirting. Sometimes a few better-dressed figures look on. The genre develops a theme found in a smaller scale in the calendars of late-medieval illuminated manuscripts.

Pieter Bruegel the Elder (nicknamed &quot;Peasant Bruegel&quot; for his fondness for such subjects) was the main progenitor of the large painted kermesse, in works like &quot;The Wedding Dance&quot; (c. 1566, Detroit, with 125 figures) and &quot;The Peasant Dance&quot; (c. 1567, Vienna), which are thought to have made a set with the sit-down meal shown in &quot;The Peasant Wedding&quot; (c. 1567, Vienna). Most later works, many by his descendants, adopted the more distant view from slightly above that Bruegel had developed for other subjects, allowing a larger number of figures.

==Impact on other languages and cultures==
The word Kermess (generally in the form Kirmess) is applied in the United States to any entertainment, especially one organized in the interest of charity. The Dutch-American Village of Little Chute, Wisconsin, has celebrated &quot;Kermis&quot; annually since 1981. The Wallonian settlements in Door County, Wisconsin, also celebrate a &quot;Kermis&quot; with traditional Belgian dishes and events. Another American polity that celebrates this holiday is &quot;La Kermesse&quot; of Biddeford, Maine. The International School of Indiana, located in Indianapolis, Indiana, holds an annual &quot;Kermesse&quot; celebration with refreshments, carnival games and face-painting to celebrate the ending of the school year for their pre-elementary and elementary pupils. In the City of Halifax (Nova Scotia, Canada), a city with a limited Dutch heritage, kermesses have been held since 1907 as fundraisers for the local children&#x27;s hospital. The École Française de Vancouver (ÉFIV) in North Vancouver, British Columbia (Canada), holds an annual kermesse with games, food, a pétanque tournament and community participation.

The term has also had an influence on Ibero-American culture. Specifically in Paraguay, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile, &quot;kermeses&quot; are held by churches and schools to raise funds. Many activities take place including &quot;tombolas&quot; where people buy tickets for drawings that always have awards from very minor items to bigger awards. In Brazil &quot;quermesses&quot; are usually held by churches during the early weeks of winter and in celebration of the widely popular Festa Junina festivities.

The word also entered the Belarusian language as &quot;кiрмаш&quot; (&quot;kirmash&quot;) in the meaning of &quot;fair&quot;.
In Lithuanian language &quot;kermošius&quot; (&quot;kermoshius&quot;) means a fair after the mass in the church.
Polish language uses word &quot;kiermasz&quot; which also started as a village church event but over time morphed into synonym for fair.

In Romanian &quot;chermeză&quot; means party or banquet.

In Italian &quot;kermesse&quot; means festival or show, especially one featuring many different acts.

In the Turkish language &quot;kermes&quot; is a sale of ladies&#x27; handiwork for charity.

<text>Campylobacteriosis is among the most common infections caused by a bacterium in humans, often as a foodborne illness. It is caused by the &quot;Campylobacter&quot; bacterium, most commonly &quot;C. jejuni&quot;. It produces an inflammatory, sometimes bloody, diarrhea or dysentery syndrome, and usually cramps, fever and pain.

==Symptoms and signs==
The prodromal symptoms are fever, headache, and myalgia, which can be severe, lasting as long as 24 hours. After 1–5 days, typically, these are followed by diarrhea (as many as 10 watery, frequently bloody, bowel movements per day) or dysentery, cramps, abdominal pain, and fever as high as 40 °C (104 °F). In most people, the illness lasts for 2–10 days. It is classified as invasive/inflammatory diarrhea, also described as bloody diarrhea or dysentery.

There are other diseases showing similar symptoms. For instance, abdominal pain and tenderness may be very localized, mimicking acute appendicitis. Furthermore, &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; is closely related to &quot;Campylobacter&quot; and causes peptic ulcer disease.

===Complications===
Complications include toxic megacolon, dehydration and sepsis. Such complications generally occur in young children (&lt; 1 year of age) and immunocompromised people. A chronic course of the disease is possible; this disease process is likely to develop without a distinct acute phase. Chronic campylobacteriosis features a long period of sub-febrile temperature and asthenia; eye damage, arthritis, endocarditis may develop if infection is untreated. Occasional deaths occur in young, previously healthy individuals because of blood volume depletion (due to dehydration), and in people who are elderly or immunocompromised.

Some individuals (1–2 in 100,000 cases) develop Guillain–Barré syndrome, in which the nerves that join the spinal cord and brain to the rest of the body are damaged, sometimes permanently.

===Other factors===
In patients with HIV, infections may be more frequent, may cause prolonged bouts of dirty brown diarrhea, and may be more commonly associated with bacteremia and antibiotic resistance. In participants of unprotected anal intercourse, campylobacteriosis is more localized to the distal end of the colon and may be termed a proctocolitis. The severity and persistence of infection in patients with AIDS and hypogammaglobulinemia indicates that both cell-mediated and humoral immunity are important in preventing and terminating infection.

==Cause==

Campylobacteriosis is caused by &quot;Campylobacter&quot; bacteria (curved or spiral, motile, non–spore-forming, Gram-negative rods). The disease is usually caused by &quot;C. jejuni&quot;, a spiral and comma-shaped bacterium normally found in cattle, swine, and birds, where it is nonpathogenic, but the illness can also be caused by &quot;C. coli&quot; (also found in cattle, swine, and birds), &quot;C. upsaliensis&quot; (found in cats and dogs) and &quot;C. lari&quot; (present in seabirds in particular).

One effect of campylobacteriosis is tissue injury in the gut. The sites of tissue injury include the jejunum, the ileum, and the colon. &quot;C jejuni&quot; appears to achieve this by invading and destroying epithelial cells.

&quot;C. jejuni&quot; can also cause a latent autoimmune effect on the nerves of the legs, which is usually seen several weeks after a surgical procedure of the abdomen. The effect is known as an acute idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), i.e. Guillain–Barré syndrome, in which one sees symptoms of ascending paralysis, dysaesthesias usually below the waist, and, in the later stages, respiratory failure.

Some strains of &quot;C jejuni&quot; produce a cholera-like enterotoxin, which is important in watery diarrhea observed in infections. The organism produces diffuse, bloody, edematous, and exudative enteritis. In a small number of cases, the infection may be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura through a poorly understood mechanism.

==Transmission==
The common routes of transmission for the disease-causing bacteria are fecal-oral, person-to-person sexual contact, ingestion of contaminated food (generally unpasteurized (raw) milk and undercooked or poorly handled poultry), and waterborne (i.e., through contaminated drinking water). Contact with contaminated poultry, livestock, or household pets, especially puppies, can also cause disease.

Animals farmed for meat are the main source of campylobacteriosis. A study published in &quot;PLoS Genetics&quot; (26 September 2008) by researchers from Lancashire, England, and Chicago, Illinois, found that 97 percent of campylobacteriosis cases sampled in Lancashire were caused by bacteria typically found in chicken and livestock. In 57 percent of cases, the bacteria could be traced to chicken, and in 35 percent to cattle. Wild animal and environmental sources were accountable for just three percent of disease.

The infectious dose is 1000–10,000 bacteria (although ten to five hundred bacteria can be enough to infect humans). &quot;Campylobacter&quot; species are sensitive to hydrochloric acid in the stomach, and acid reduction treatment can reduce the amount of needed to cause disease.

Exposure to bacteria is often more common during travelling, and therefore campylobacteriosis is a common form of travelers&#x27; diarrhea.

==Diagnosis==
&quot;Campylobacter&quot; organisms can be detected by performing a Gram stain of a stool sample with high specificity and a sensitivity of ~60%, but are most often diagnosed by stool culture. Fecal leukocytes should be present and indicate the diarrhea to be inflammatory in nature. Methods currently being developed to detect the presence of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; organisms include antigen testing via an EIA or PCR.

==Prevention==
* Pasteurization of milk and chlorination of drinking water destroys the organisms.
* Treatment with antibiotics can reduce fecal excretion.
* Infected health care workers should not provide direct patient care.
* Separate cutting boards should be used for foods of animal origin and other foods. After preparing raw food of animal origin, all cutting boards and countertops should be carefully cleaned with soap and hot water.
* Contact with pet saliva and feces should be avoided.

The World Health Organization recommends the following:
* Food should be properly cooked and hot when served.
* Consume only pasteurized or boiled milk and milk products, never raw milk products.
* Make sure that ice is from safe water.
* If you are not sure of the safety of drinking water, boil it, or disinfect it with chemical disinfectant.
* Wash hands thoroughly and frequently with soap, especially after using the toilet and after contact with pets and farm animals.
* Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly, especially if they are to be eaten raw. Peel fruits and vegetables whenever possible.
* Food handlers, professionals and at home, should observe hygienic rules during food preparation.
* Professional food handlers should immediately report to their employer any fever, diarrhea, vomiting or visible infected skin lesions.

==Treatment==
The infection is usually self-limiting, and in most cases, symptomatic treatment by liquid and electrolyte replacement is enough in human infections.

===Antibiotics===
Antibiotic treatment only has a marginal effect on the duration of symptoms, and its use is not recommended except in high-risk patients with clinical complications. 

Erythromycin can be used in children, and tetracycline in adults. Some studies show, however, that erythromycin rapidly eliminates &quot;Campylobacter&quot; from the stool without affecting the duration of illness. Nevertheless, children with dysentery due to &quot;C. jejuni&quot; benefit from early treatment with erythromycin. Treatment with antibiotics, therefore, depends on the severity of symptoms. Quinolones are effective if the organism is sensitive, but high rates of quinolone use in livestock mean that quinolones are now largely ineffective.

Antimotility agents, such as loperamide, can lead to prolonged illness or intestinal perforation in any invasive diarrhea, and should be avoided. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin are ineffective against &quot;Campylobacter&quot;.

===In animals===
In the past, poultry infections were often treated by mass administration of enrofloxacin and sarafloxacin for single instances of infection. The FDA banned this practice, as it promoted the development of fluoroquinolone-resistant populations.
A major broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone used in humans is ciprofloxacin. The increasing resistance of the &quot;Campylobacter&quot; to fluoroquinolones and macrolides is of a major concern.
A different approach, propagated within the EU is that &quot;Campylobacter&quot; mitigating measures should be undertaken mainly at the primary production level. An update of potential control options was released by EFSA on 30 April 2020. Vaccination, feed, and water additives, discontinued thinning, employing few and well-trained staff, drinkers that allow standing water, addition of disinfectants to drinking water, hygienic anterooms, designated tools per broiler house were listed as most effective in mitigating the risk of Campylobacter in chicken thus reducing the risk of human campylobacteriosis.

==Prognosis==
Campylobacteriosis is usually self-limited without any mortality (assuming proper hydration is maintained). However, there are several possible complications.

==Epidemiology==
&quot;Campylobacter&quot; is one of the most common causes of human bacterial gastroenteritis. For instance, an estimated 2 million cases of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; enteritis occur annually in the U.S., accounting for 5–7% of cases of gastroenteritis. Furthermore, in the United Kingdom during 2000, &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; was involved in 77.3% in all cases of laboratory confirmed foodborne illness. About 15 of every 100,000 people are diagnosed with campylobacteriosis every year, and with many cases going unreported, up to 0.5% of the general population may unknowingly harbor &quot;Campylobacter&quot; in their gut.

Unfortunately, the true incidence of campylobacteriosis is unknown in most countries, especially developing countries. The reasons are among others underreporting, difficulties with diagnosis and differences in reporting systems in different countries.

A large animal reservoir is present as well, with up to 100% of poultry, including chickens, turkeys, and waterfowl, having asymptomatic infections in their intestinal tracts. Infected chicken feces may contain up to 109 bacteria per 25 grams, and due to the animals&#x27; close proximity, the bacteria are rapidly spread to other chickens. This vastly exceeds the infectious dose of 1000–10,000 bacteria for humans.

In January 2013, the UK&#x27;s Food Standards Agency warned that two-thirds of all raw chicken bought from UK shops was contaminated with campylobacter, affecting an estimated half a million people annually and killing approximately 100.

==Outbreak==
In August–September 2016, 5,200 people fell ill with campylobacteriosis in Hastings, New Zealand, after the local water supply in Havelock North tested positive for the pathogen &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot;. Four deaths were suspected to be due to the outbreak. It is suspected that after heavy rain fell on 5–6 August, water contamination from flooding caused the outbreak, although this is the subject of a government Inquiry. It is the largest outbreak of waterborne disease ever to occur in New Zealand. All schools in Havelock North closed for two weeks, with the Hastings District Council advising an urgent notice to boil water for at least one minute before consumption. This notice was lifted on 3 September, with the outbreak officially under control.

According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a multistate outbreak of human &quot;Campylobacter&quot; infection has been reported since 11 September 2017. In all, 55 cases were reported from 12 states (Florida, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming). Epidemiological and laboratory evidence indicated that puppies sold through Petland stores were a likely source of this outbreak. Out of 55 cases reported, 50 were either employees of Petland or had recently purchased a puppy at Petland, or visited there before illness began. Five people out of 55 cases reported were exposed to puppies from various sources.

&quot;Campylobacter&quot; can spread through contact with dog feces. It usually does not spread from one person to another. However, activities such as changing an infected person&#x27;s diapers or sexual contact with an infected person can lead to infection. Regardless of where they are from, any puppies and dogs may carry &quot;Campylobacter&quot; germs.

<text>Poe is the mascot of the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). He is named after the writer and Baltimore, Maryland resident, Edgar Allan Poe.

==Poe&#x27;s brothers==

When originally unveiled, Poe was one of three costumed mascots, all raven brothers named &quot;Edgar&quot;, &quot;Allan&quot;, and &quot;Poe&quot;. Because the Baltimore Ravens were named after the poem &quot;The Raven&quot; by Baltimore resident Edgar Allan Poe, it was natural that the team name their mascots after Poe himself. The three not only commemorated the famous Baltimore poet but also represented three completely different personalities and their stereotypical relation to certain types of NFL players.

According to the back story, Edgar was the first to hatch. Edgar was tall and broad-shouldered, representing the &quot;backfield&quot; or the players of the game routinely not staged on the line of scrimmage. This represented the linebacker, defensive back, fullback, quarterback, etc. Edgar was decidedly proud, if not arrogant, and was the trio&#x27;s leader.

Allan was particularly shorter and thinner than Edgar and especially Poe, yet much quicker. He represented the receivers and running backs. Allan was a very energetic bird who always had energy to spare. 

Poe was the last to hatch. Poe is short and stout representing the linemen of the game. He is a slow, lazy, yet lovable mascot. Poe routinely joins tailgate parties in his never-ending search for the perfect cheeseburger.

After the 2008 season ended, Edgar and Allan were retired, leaving Poe as the sole mascot of the Baltimore Ravens. For the 2009 season, Poe was joined by two real live ravens, &quot;Rise&quot; and &quot;Conquer&quot;.

After Poe suffered an injury in a halftime event during a preseason game, Edgar and Allan were brought out of retirement for the 2022 season. Poe returned in week 17 of that season against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a divisional rival.

<doc id="885576" wikidata="Q571313" url="?curid=885576" title="Jan Collaert the Elder">
<text>Jan Collaert the Elder or (I), Hans Collaert the Elder or Johannes Collaert (Brussels, between 1525 and 1530 – Antwerp, October 1580) was a Flemish printmaker, publisher, draftsman, tapestry designer, glass painter and designer and engraver of swords. He was the founder of a dynasty of engravers that would play a significant role in establishing Antwerp as one of the leading centres for printmaking in Europe in the second half of the 16th century and the early 17th century.

==Life==
Jan Collaert the Elder was born in Brussels as the son of Jannen (Jan) Collaert. His father was a designer and painter of cartoons for tapestries. Jan likely trained with his father. After a career as a draftsman producing designs for glass makers, tapestry makers and embroiderers in Brussels, he moved sometime before 1563 to Antwerp where he created designs for the local tapestry workshops. He also provided designs for jewelry.

His first dated print was published by Hieronymous Cock (1518–1570) in 1555. Collaert engraved plates to the designs by other artists for several print publishers in Antwerp during the 1570s. He married Anna van der Heyden, with whom he had four children: Adriaen (c. 1555/65 – 1618)., Hansken (Jan or Hans) (1561 – 1620/1628), Tanneken and Susanna.

The sons would later work in the workshop of Philip Galle and marry Galle&#x27;s daughters. The workshops of the Collaert and Galle families were close together and their works are hard to distinguish.

He died in Antwerp in October 1580.

==Work==
Collaert was known for his engravings after designs by contemporary artists, usually from the Northern Renaissance.

Collaert engraved a sword that was formerly in the collection formed in the nineteenth century by Prince Charles of Prussia and is now in the collection of the Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin. The sword blade was made by Damiano de Nerve between 1540 and 1581 and etched by Collaert after his own design. The signature IAN . COLLART appears in one of the figures engraved on the blade. The blade is etched with representations of the Planets on one side and Virtues on the other. The figures are in a vertical row.

==Selected works==
He left many works including:
* &quot;Life of Saint Francis&quot;, 16 prints
* &quot;Views of Brussels and its surroundings&quot;, after Hans Bol and Jacob Grimmer, 24 prints, published before 1580 
* &quot;Last Judgment&quot;, folio
*&quot;Monilium, Bullarum, Inauriumque Artificiosissimae Icones&quot;, 10 prints, 1581
*&quot;The Dead Christ in his Mother&#x27;s Lap&quot;
*&quot;Marcus Curtius&quot;
*&quot;Moses Striking the Rock, and The Resurrection of Lazarus&quot;, after Lambert Lombard
*&quot;The Fathers of the Desert&quot;
*&quot;Biblia Sacra and the History of the Church&quot;, after Rubens.

<text>Father Alberto Maria de Agostini (2 November 1883 – 25 December 1960) born in Pollone, Piedmont was an Italian missionary of the Salesians of Don Bosco order as well as a passionate mountaineer, explorer, geographer, ethnographer, photographer and cinematographer.

==Life==

De Agostini lived as a missionary in Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia, between Chile and Argentina, where he was the first person to reach several mountain peaks, glaciers and sea sounds; and discovered others, some named after him.

In January–February 1931 he, Egidio Feruglio, and the alpine mountain guides Croux and Bron, were the first to fully cross the Southern Patagonian Ice Field; they did it from Lago Viedma (Argentina) to the vicinity of Patagonian channels of the Pacific Ocean (Chile), and back.

In 1941, he was the first to write about Cueva de las Manos.

He also sustained a long and deep relationship with the native people of Tierra de Fuego.

In addition he has left behind 22 books and written works in Italian, German and Spanish; a precious collection of several hundred photographs; and a documentary film; all of them on Patagonia and Tierra de Fuego and the Fuegian tribes.

He died in Turin on Christmas Day, 1960.

There is now an Alberto de Agostini National Park in the west part of Tierra del Fuego named after him.

<doc id="885609" wikidata="Q108923" url="?curid=885609" title="Himalia group">
<text>The Himalia group is a group of prograde irregular satellites of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Himalia and are thought to have a common origin.

The known members of the group are (in order of increasing distance from Jupiter):

Two additional possible satellites discovered by Sheppard in 2017 have been identified to be likely part of the Himalia group, but were too faint (&quot;mag&quot; &gt;24) to be tracked and confirmed as satellites.

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) reserves names for moons of Jupiter ending in -a (Leda, Himalia and so on) for the moons in this group to indicate prograde motions of these bodies relative to Jupiter, their gravitationally central object.

==Characteristics and origin==

The objects in the Himalia group have semi-major axes (distances from Jupiter) in the range of 11.10 and 12.30 Gm, inclinations between 27.2° and 29.1°, and eccentricities between 0.11 and 0.24. All orbit in a prograde direction. In physical appearance, the group is very homogeneous, all satellites displaying neutral colours (colour indices B−V = 0.66 and V−R = 0.36) similar to those of C-type asteroids. Given the limited dispersion of the orbital parameters and the spectral homogeneity, it has been suggested that the group could be a remnant of the break-up of an asteroid from the main asteroid belt. The radius of the parent asteroid was probably about 89 km, only slightly larger than that of Himalia, which retains approximately 87% of the mass of the original body. This indicates the asteroid was not heavily disturbed.

Numerical integrations show a high probability of collisions among the members of the prograde group during the lifespan of the solar system (&quot;e.g.&quot; on average 1.5 collisions between Himalia and Elara). In addition, the same simulations have shown fairly high probabilities of collisions between prograde and retrograde satellites (e.g. Pasiphae and Himalia have a 27% probability of collision within 4.5 gigayears). Consequently, it has been suggested that the current group could be a result of a more recent, rich collisional history among the prograde and retrograde satellites as opposed to the single break-up shortly after the planet formation that has been inferred for the Carme and Ananke groups.

<text>Narayani () was one of the fourteen zones of Nepal until the restructuring of zones to Provinces, located in the central south of the country. The headquarter of Narayani zone was Hetauda. Narayani Zone is named after the Narayani River which is on the western border of the zone, separating it from the Gandaki and Lumbini zones. Narayani means beloved of Narayan which is Parvati his sister, and Narayan refers to Lord Vishnu (the preserver) in the Hindu religion.

== Geography ==
Narayani contained parts of the Terai, Inner Terai, and Hill regions of Nepal, but it did not contain any of the Mountain or Himalayan region. Narayani is rich in flora and fauna. Considering the plain Terai, bordering India (to the south), where arnas (wild bulls) run to the hills from in fall, landscape structure of Narayani can be considered unique. Narayani River and East Rapti River are the main rivers of Narayani zone. Bishajari and Garuda are some of the few lakes in Narayani.

== Administrative subdivisions ==
Narayani was divided into five districts; since 2015 the two northern districts have been redesignated as part of Bagmati Province, while the three southern districts have been redesignated as part of Madhesh Province.

== History ==
Narayani used to be all forest. Settlement started after the Anglo-Nepal War. Devghat, where people go for meditation, is in this area. It is one of the most religious places of Nepal.

== Economy ==
Birgunj-Pathlaiya 25 km industrial corridor having major industries of Nepal is in Narayani zone. 
It is the third largest industrial area of the country. Hetauda is the industrial area where the Hetauda cement factory (government owned organization) is. The main transit point of business transaction is in Birgunj joining to Raxaul, India, a dry port of Nepal and India.

Nepal Oil Corporation in Amlekhganj, Dabur Nepal in Bara District, Unilever in Hetauda, Bottlers Nepal (Terai) in Chitwan and other several industries are in Narayani Zone and play leading role in national economy.

== Important cities and towns ==
Some important cities and towns are Birganj, Parwanipur, Jitpur, Alau, Hetauda, Bharatpur, Narayangarh, Kalaiya, and Gaur.

== Miscellaneous ==
Narayani hosts Nepal&#x27;s oldest and most famous national park: Chitwan National Park (932 km2), considered to be one of Asia&#x27;s richest nature reserves, renowned for its Bengal tigers and the Indian rhinoceros. To the southeast the park is complemented by the Parsa National Park with another 499 km2.

As of 2014 the Zone now hosts the beauty contest of Miss Glam Narayani, wherein winners are given direct entry to Miss Glam Nepal.

Narayani is one of the few zones that was left relatively untouched by the Maoist insurgency. It is a relatively prosperous zones of Nepal with a trading market with India whose effect can be easily seen in the border town of Birgunj, the capital of this zone.

<text>Fritz Herlen (or Herlin) (before 1449 – October 12, 1491) was a German artist of the early Swabian school, in the 15th century.

==Biography==
The date and place of Herlen&#x27;s birth are unknown, but his name is on the roll of the tax-gatherers of Ulm in 1449; and in 1467 he was made citizen and town painter at Nördlingen, because of his acquaintance with Flemish methods of painting.

One of the first of his acknowledged productions is a shrine on one of the altars of the church of Rothenburg on the Tauber, the wings of which were finished in 1466, with seven scenes from the lives of Christ and the Virgin Mary. In the town-hall of Rothenburg is a Madonna and St Catherine of 1467; and in the choir of Nördlingen cathedral a triptych of 1488, representing the Nativity and Christ amidst the Doctors, at the side of a votive Madonna attended by St Joseph and St Margaret as patrons of a family.

In each of these works the painter&#x27;s name certifies the picture, and the manner is truly that of an artist acquainted with Flemish methods. We are not told under whom Herlen laboured in the Netherlands, but he probably took the same course as Schöngauer and Hans Holbein the Elder, who studied in the school of van der Weyden. His altarpiece at Rothenburg contains groups and figures, as well as forms of action and drapery, which seem copied from those of van der Weyden&#x27;s or Memlinc&#x27;s disciples, and the votive Madonna of 1488, whilst characterized by similar features, only displays such further changes as may be accounted for by the master&#x27;s constant later contact with contemporaries in Swabia.

Herlen had none of the genius of Schöngauer. He failed to acquire the delicacy even of the second-rate men who handed down to Matsys the traditions of the 15th century; but his example was certainly favourable to the development of art in Swabia. By general consent critics have assigned to him a large altar-piece, with scenes from the gospels and figures of St Florian and St Floriana, and a Crucifixion, the principal figure of which is carved in high relief on the surface of a large panel in the church of Dinkelsbuhl.

A Crucifixion, with eight scenes from the New Testament, is shown as his in the cathedral, a Christ in Judgment, with Mary and John, and the Resurrection of Souls in the town-hall of Nördlingen. A small Epiphany, once in the convent of the Minorites of Ulm, is in the Holzschuher collection at Augsburg, a Madonna and Circumcision in the National Museum at Munich. Herlen&#x27;s epitaph, preserved by Rathgeber, states that he died on October 12, 1491, and was buried at Nördlingen.

<doc id="885620" wikidata="Q155575" url="?curid=885620" title="Martin Schongauer">
<text>Martin Schongauer (c. 1450–53, Colmar – 2 February 1491, Breisach), also known as Martin Schön (&quot;Martin beautiful&quot;) or Hübsch Martin (&quot;pretty Martin&quot;) by his contemporaries, was an Alsatian engraver and painter. He was the most important printmaker north of the Alps before Albrecht Dürer, a younger artist who collected his work. Schongauer is the first German painter to be a significant engraver, although he seems to have had the family background and training in goldsmithing which was usual for early engravers.

The bulk of Schongauer&#x27;s surviving production is 116 engravings, all with his monogram but none dated, which were well known not only in Germany, but also in Italy and even made their way to England and Spain. Vasari says that Michelangelo copied one of his engravings, in the &quot;Trial of Saint Anthony&quot;. His style shows no trace of Italian influence, but a very clear and organised Gothic, which draws from both German and Early Netherlandish painting.

Recent scholarship, building on the work of Max Lehrs, attributes 116 engravings to him, with many also being copied by other artists (including his monogram), as was common in the period. His prolific contemporary Israhel van Meckenem did close copies of 58 engravings, exactly half of Schongauer&#x27;s output, and took motifs or figures from more, as well as apparently engraving some drawings that are now lost.

There are some fine drawings, including ones dated and signed with his monogram, and a surviving few paintings in oil and fresco.

==Biography==

Schongauer was born about 1450–53 in Colmar, Alsace, the third of four or five sons of Caspar Schongauer, a goldsmith and patrician from Augsburg who moved to Colmar about 1440; Caspar became a master of the goldsmith&#x27;s guild in 1445, which probably required a residence of five years. He presumably taught his son the art of engraving, which is a distinct and difficult skill that goldsmiths had long used on metal vessels. Two of his brothers worked as goldsmiths in Colmar, while another also became a painter. Colmar is now in France but was then part of the Holy Roman Empire and German-speaking.

Most unusually for a Gothic or Renaissance artist, he was sent to university, presumably with the intention of turning him into a priest or lawyer, and matriculated at the University of Leipzig in 1465, but seems to have left after a year. At this time university students often began at the age of twelve or thirteen. He was traditionally thought to have been trained as an engraver by Master E. S., but scholars now doubt this, partly because Schongauer&#x27;s prints took some time to develop the technical advances that a pupil of Master E. S. would have been taught.

He is thought to have trained as a painter with Colmar&#x27;s main local master Caspar Isenmann (d. 1472), a neighbour of his parents, who was greatly influenced by the Early Netherlandish painting of Rogier van der Weyden and others, and had perhaps studied in the Netherlands, and Schongauer&#x27;s few surviving pictures reflect this. This was probably around 1466 and 1469; he was recorded as back in Colmar in 1469. His older brother Ludwig Schongauer had probably preceded him in the workshop.

His earlier engravings also show clear influences from several Early Netherlandish painters, suggesting that he followed the traditional pattern of a &quot;wanderjahre&quot; travelling at the end of his training. One drawing, dated 1469, is a copy of the figure of Christ in Rogier van der Weyden&#x27;s &quot;Beaune Altarpiece&quot;, presumably made in front of the painting. Various details of costume, and the exotic plants in the &quot;Rest on the Flight into Egypt&quot;, have suggested to some scholars that he also visited Spain, and possibly Portugal.

He returned to Colmar and had established a workshop by 1471, when payments were made for an altarpiece for the Dominican church there, which is now in the museum and regarded as a workshop production. His &quot;Madonna of the Rose Bower&quot;, long displayed in the church in Colmar it was made for, but moved to the Dominican church nearby in 1973, is dated 1473 (his only dated painting). Its style corresponds with the earliest of his engravings, which have been placed in a broadly agreed sequence based on their technique and style, both of which show considerable development. In some cases a &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; is provided by copies in various media that can be dated.
The economics of fifteenth-century printmaking are unclear, and though his prints spread his fame widely across Europe, he may have relied more on the income from his &quot;major vocation&quot; of painting.

He died in Breisach in 1491, perhaps before reaching the age of forty. He had been engaged since 1488 in painting a large &quot;Last Judgment&quot; in the cathedral there, and was recorded as a citizen there in June 1489. This was the largest mural painting north of the Alps, and was incomplete at his death.

The following year Dürer, on his &quot;wanderjahre&quot;, travelled to Colmar to meet him, only to find he had died. Dürer was an admirer who collected his drawings and no doubt prints. His own print of the &quot;Flight into Egypt&quot;, in his &quot;Life of the Virgin&quot; series, includes the same two exotic trees as Schongauer&#x27;s, as an &quot;hommage&quot;. In Germany Dürer, whose prints became known over the decade following, was seen as the next leader of the tradition Schongauer had dominated for twenty years. 

His pupils included Hans Burgkmair the Elder, the Augsburg-based painter and designer of woodcuts (but not engravings), who was with him from 1488 to 1490. The painted portrait of Schongauer, with his coat of arms at top left, is unusual for a fifteenth-century artist, but the panel now in Munich appears to be made well after his death, and is perhaps a copy of a drawing or painting made at the date on the painting, 1483. It is attributed to Hans Burgkmair the Elder, and the lost original may have been by his father, Thoman Burgkmair, who very plausibly met Schongauer in Augsburg, where Schongauer is recorded as at least visiting.

Another of Schongauer&#x27;s pupils, the painter Urbain Huter, has long been considered as the main author of the Buhl Altarpiece, a work very close in design and execution both to Schongauer&#x27;s own engravings and to the production of Schongauer&#x27;s painting workshop. Some engravers whose prints are often copies of Schongauer&#x27;s, and whose original compositions are close to his style, are assumed to have been pupils of his. These include Master i.e, attributed with 55 prints by Lehrs, 31 copies of his master, Master BM, and Master A G, attributed with 34 prints, 13 copies of his master.

==Engravings==
One hundred and sixteen engravings are generally recognised as by his hand. Many of his pupils&#x27; plates as well as his own are signed, M†S, as are many copies probably by artists with no connection to him. He is thought to have begun signing engravings in the early 1470s. The rarest survives in three impressions, and unlike most other printmakers of the century, examples have probably survived of all the engravings he made.

The great majority of his subjects are religious, but there are a handful of comic scenes of ordinary life such as the early &quot;Peasant Family Going to Market&quot; or the &quot;Two Apprentices Fighting&quot;, which may reflect his background in a goldsmith&#x27;s house. A print of an elephant is a unique venture into the popular &quot;prodigy&quot; genre; it turns out that an elephant was indeed being toured around Germany in 1483, before drowning in a canal near Muiden. 
He also produced nine of the first ornament prints, initially intended to be used by craftsmen in various media, including woodcarvers and goldsmiths, as patterns for the elaborate and sophisticated designs. There are also two prints of metalwork objects, a censer and crosier.

From his family background and time at university he was no doubt familiar with the emerging bourgeoisie of trade and the professions who provided the core market for high quality engravings, but the subjects from classical mythology so popular in German prints of the next century, and already present in Italian ones, do not appear at all in his work.

The generally agreed sequence of his engravings shows an increasing sophistication of technique, but the most crowded and detailed, but highly organized, compositions are placed rather early, with &quot;late-Gothic complexity&quot; giving way to simpler compositions with more empty space and &quot;an almost classical orderliness and decorum&quot;. But some of the busy early prints were his most popular and influential, as shown by the number of copies of them. These include &quot;The Temptation of St Anthony&quot;, the &quot;[Rest on] the Flight into Egypt&quot;, &quot;Death of the Virgin&quot; and &quot;Christ Carrying the Cross&quot;.

There are a number of series of engravings which show this development, from the twelve &quot;crowded and turbulent&quot; scenes in the &quot;Passion&quot; series, perhaps of about 1480, through the &quot;Twelve Apostles&quot;, and the circular coats of arms with wild men, to the late circular Evangelist&#x27;s symbols and the &quot;Wise and Foolish Virgins&quot;, perhaps of around 1490. By the time of his pair showing the &quot;Annuciation&quot; with each figure occupying its own sheet, often thought to be his last prints, the background is only represented by a simple groundline.

He went beyond Master E. S. in the system of depicting volume by means of cross-hatching (lines in two directions) which was further developed by Dürer, and was the first engraver to curve parallel lines, probably by rotating the plate against a steady burin. He also developed a burin technique producing deeper lines on the plate, which meant that more impressions could be taken before the plate became worn.

According to Arthur Mayger Hind, Schongauer was one of the first German engravers to &quot;rise above the Gothic limitations both of setting and type&quot; and that he &quot;actualises an idea of beauty which in its nearer approach to more absolute ideals appeals to a far more universal appreciation&quot; than earlier engravers such as Master E. S.

With Master E.S., he was the first northern printmaker not only to have his prints very widely copied by other printmakers, but to have his designs taken by painters, sculptors and artists in all media. The demons in his &quot;The Temptation of St Anthony&quot; established the hybrids of fish, bird and insect types followed by Hieronymus Bosch and other artists throughout the next century.

Major print rooms possess good collections of Schongauer&#x27;s prints, most of which are relatively common for fifteenth-century prints, although impressions vary in quality a good deal. The different watermarks found suggest that impressions were printed over considerable periods, with most made when the copper plates were showing signs of wear. The &quot;Rest on the Flight into Egypt&quot; survives in some sixty impressions, though only seven are &quot;of the first quality&quot;. For the large &quot;Christ Carrying the Cross&quot;, the largest engraving yet made, the equivalent figures are about seventy and fifteen.


==Paintings==
Only a few of his paintings survived, the most notable being the &quot;Madonna in the Rose Garden&quot; painted for St Martin&#x27;s Church, Colmar and today displayed in the Dominican church nearby. This is a German subject, associated in particular with Cologne and Stephan Lochner, but Schongauer gives it a treatment very much in the Netherlandish style. It has been cut down at the top and sides to fit the elaborate later carved frame.

The Musée d´Unterlinden in Colmar possesses the largest collection. Two double-sided shutters (probably made to surround a sculpted central section) from the &quot;Orlier Altarpiece&quot;, dated c. 1470–75, show the &quot;Annunciation&quot; on the outer faces and a &quot;Nativity&quot; and Saint Anthony with donor portrait within. These are regarded as largely the work of the master, while the twenty-four panels from the doors of an altarpiece for the Dominican church are regarded as mainly painted by the workshop, no doubt to his designs. A &quot;Nativity&quot; in Berlin is attributed to him.

The small &quot;Holy Family&quot; in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna is close in style to his engravings, and not much larger than some. Many everyday details, such as the grapes in the basket, the wheat carried by Joseph, and the flask of water in the niche in the wall, can be treated as allusions to the theology of the subject, in the tradition of Netherlandish painting.

A watercolour and gouache study of paeony leaves and flowers (now Getty Museum) surfaced in 1988; it relates to the flowers in the &quot;Madonna in the Rose Garden&quot;.

The Breisach frescos remain on the west and south walls of the cathedral, though &quot;in ruinous condition&quot;.

<doc id="885627" wikidata="Q1933560" url="?curid=885627" title="Mike Tice">
<text>Michael Peter Tice (born February 2, 1959) is a former American football tight end and coach. He played college football at the University of Maryland, College Park and spent 11 seasons playing in the National Football League (NFL) before spending 22 seasons as a coach, including four seasons as the Minnesota Vikings head coach.

==Playing career==
Tice attended the University of Maryland, College Park where he played quarterback. He played tight end in the National Football League (NFL) from 1981 to 1995 with the Seattle Seahawks, Washington Redskins and Minnesota Vikings.

Tice was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Coaches and Football Categories with the Class of 2013.

==Coaching career==

===Minnesota Vikings===
Immediately after his retirement from playing, Tice joined the Vikings&#x27; coaching staff, serving first as tight ends coach (1996) and offensive line coach (1997–2001). Tice took over head coaching duties on an interim basis for the final game of the 2001 season, replacing Dennis Green. On January 10, 2002, Tice was named the 6th head coach in franchise history, Bud Grant having been both 2nd and 4th. He was the first former Viking player to assume the role.

In 2002, the Vikings led the NFL in rushing for the first time in team history, and in 2003, they led the league in total offense for the first time. A season later, the Vikings broke team records with 6,339 total yards and 4,754 passing yards and scored 50 touchdowns.

In March 2005, the NFL began to investigate Tice for organizing and profiting from a Super Bowl ticket scalping operation within the Vikings organization. He later admitted that these charges were true and the NFL fined him $100,000 on June 30, 2005. At the time, it was the largest fine ever handed down to a head coach in NFL history, and is still the largest for a head coach who does not also have the title or powers of general manager.

Tice was also the head coach during the Minnesota Vikings boat party scandal which occurred in October 2005. Some commentators believe that this incident led to his demise in Minnesota.

Tice&#x27;s contract with the Minnesota Vikings was allowed to expire after the last game of the 2005 season on January 1, 2006. The Vikings had just defeated the Chicago Bears, but a loss to the Baltimore Ravens eliminated the Vikings from playoff contention and effectively sealed Tice&#x27;s fate. During his tenure of more than four years as the Vikings head coach, he had a regular season record of 32–33–0, while going 1–1 in the playoffs. Also during his tenure, the Vikings recorded an NFL record for the most consecutive games with over 300 yards of offense with 36.

===Jacksonville Jaguars===
Tice was hired as assistant head coach/offense of Jacksonville by Jack Del Rio, another former Viking.

===Chicago Bears===
On January 15, 2010, Tice was hired as offensive line coach for the Chicago Bears. On October 3, 2010, his offensive line allowed 9 sacks in one half to the New York Giants. On September 17, 2010, against the Cowboys, his line only gave up one sack and held DeMarcus Ware, one of the leading sackers since he came into the NFL, sackless. Despite this, the Bears allowed 105 sacks in his two years as offensive line coach.

On January 6, 2012, the Bears promoted Tice to offensive coordinator, filling the void left by the resignation of Mike Martz.

On January 16, 2013, the Bears hired Marc Trestman to be the Bears new head coach after Lovie Smith was fired. It was also announced that the Bears had hired Aaron Kromer to replace Tice as offensive coordinator and offensive line coach. Tice was dismissed by the Bears on January 17, 2013.

===Atlanta Falcons===
Tice was hired to be the Atlanta Falcons offensive line coach in January 2014.

===Oakland Raiders===
Tice was hired to be the Oakland Raiders offensive line coach in January 2015. On February 6, 2018, Tice announced that he was retiring from coaching. He said that he was ready to move on from the coaching ranks because &quot;players today don&#x27;t want to be coached.&quot;

==Head coaching record==
==Personal life==
Mike Tice is the older brother of John Tice, also a former tight end at the University of Maryland, who played ten seasons in the NFL with the New Orleans Saints. John was an assistant coach for the Vikings in Mike&#x27;s tenure. His son, Nate, was a quarterback for the Wisconsin Badgers and became an NFL writer and podcaster after working in the back office for NFL teams. During Mike&#x27;s time with Seattle, his teammates referred to his eating style as &quot;Mike Tice&#x27;s Lunchout&quot; in a humorous parody of the then popular video game, &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out!!&quot; Tice currently lives in the Seattle area with his wife, Diane.

<text>Maggie Wheeler (née Jakobson) is an American actress. She is best known for her role as Janice on the television sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; (1994–2004), and Anita on &quot;Ellen&quot; (1994–1996). In addition to her acting and voiceover work, she is a singer, songwriter, choir director, and workshop facilitator.

==Early life and education==
Wheeler is the daughter of Barbara, a writer, and John Jakobson, one of the members of the New York Stock Exchange. She was raised in a secular Jewish household and graduated from The Calhoun School in New York City.

==Career==
In the 1980s, Wheeler (under her maiden name of Jakobson) briefly dabbled in voice acting. In the animated series &quot;SilverHawks&quot;, she voiced not only the villainess Melodia and the heroine Steelheart/Emily Hart, but all of the female characters; she also worked on the &quot;Karate Kat&quot; and &quot;Mini-Monsters&quot; segments of &quot;The Comic Strip&quot;. In 1989 she appeared in the live-action film, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;, alongside David Duchovny.

After she became Maggie Wheeler, it was rumored that she auditioned for the role of Monica Geller in &quot;Friends&quot;. She denied this in an interview, stating that she only auditioned for the role of Janice Goralnik, which she was invited to play. Janice was a recurring character of the series and particularly known as a frequent love interest of main character Chandler Bing. She featured in 19 episodes, appearing at least once in each season.

She also auditioned for the role of Debra Barone, on the American sitcom &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;. Although she was the producers&#x27; choice, CBS ended up selecting Patricia Heaton. Instead, Wheeler played the recurring role of Debra&#x27;s friend, Linda.

According to Kathy Griffin&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Official Book Club Selection&quot;, Wheeler was cast in the role of Vicki for the pilot episode of &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot; and was later replaced by Griffin.

She had a star billing in the first season of &quot;Ellen&quot;. She appeared on the hit comedy &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in the episode &quot;The Fix-Up&quot;, as one of Elaine&#x27;s friends who is set up with George. She has appeared in many other television programs, including &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;The War at Home&quot;, &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;.

In 1997, Wheeler voiced Harley Quinn&#x27;s replacement in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Joker&#x27;s Millions&quot;.

In 1998, she appeared in the remake of Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;, playing the younger of a mother-daughter pair of camp counselors. Wheeler provided the voice of Odile in &quot;Barbie of Swan Lake&quot;, and Trinette in the animated sitcom &quot;Archer&quot;.

In 2011, she guest-starred in the Disney Channel series &quot;Shake It Up&quot; as Dina&#x27;s mother.

Wheeler is the co-founder and director of the Golden Bridge Community Choir in Hollywood, a non-auditioned, intergenerational choir which supports local and global communities through fundraising concerts. She travels to retreat centers, universities, communities and schools to teach vocal workshops.

== Personal life ==
She has been married to sculptor Daniel Borden Wheeler since 1990. They have two children.

<doc id="885651" wikidata="Q2500758" url="?curid=885651" title="Stationary point">
<text>In mathematics, particularly in calculus, a stationary point of a differentiable function of one variable is a point on the graph of the function where the function&#x27;s derivative is zero. Informally, it is a point where the function &quot;stops&quot; increasing or decreasing (hence the name).

For a differentiable function of several real variables, a stationary point is a point on the surface of the graph where all its partial derivatives are zero (equivalently, the gradient has zero norm).
The notion of stationary points of a real-valued function is generalized as &quot;critical points&quot; for complex-valued functions.

Stationary points are easy to visualize on the graph of a function of one variable: they correspond to the points on the graph where the tangent is horizontal (i.e., parallel to the -axis). For a function of two variables, they correspond to the points on the graph where the tangent plane is parallel to the plane.

The notion of a &quot;stationary point&quot; allows the mathematical description of an astronomical phenomenon that was unexplained before the time of Copernicus. A &quot;stationary point&quot; is the point in the apparent trajectory of the planet on the celestial sphere, where the motion of the planet seems to stop, before restarting in the other direction (see apparent retrograde motion). This occurs because of the projection of the planet orbit into the ecliptic circle.

==Turning points==
A turning point of a differentiable function is a point at which the derivative has an isolated zero and changes sign at the point. A turning point may be either a relative maximum or a relative minimum (also known as local minimum and maximum). A turning point is thus a stationary point, but not all stationary points are turning points. If the function is twice differentiable, the isolated stationary points that are not turning points are horizontal inflection points. For example, the function formula_1 has a stationary point at , which is also an inflection point, but is not a turning point.

==Classification==

Isolated stationary points of a formula_2 real valued function formula_3 are classified into four kinds, by the first derivative test:

* a local minimum (minimal turning point or relative minimum) is one where the derivative of the function changes from negative to positive;
* a local maximum (maximal turning point or relative maximum) is one where the derivative of the function changes from positive to negative;

* a rising point of inflection (or inflexion) is one where the derivative of the function is positive on both sides of the stationary point; such a point marks a change in concavity;
* a falling point of inflection (or inflexion) is one where the derivative of the function is negative on both sides of the stationary point; such a point marks a change in concavity.

The first two options are collectively known as &quot;local extrema&quot;. Similarly a point that is either a global (or absolute) maximum or a global (or absolute) minimum is called a global (or absolute) extremum. The last two options—stationary points that are &quot;not&quot; local extrema—are known as saddle points.

By Fermat&#x27;s theorem, global extrema must occur (for a formula_2 function) on the boundary or at stationary points.

==Curve sketching==

Determining the position and nature of stationary points aids in curve sketching of differentiable functions. Solving the equation &quot;&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0 returns the &quot;x&quot;-coordinates of all stationary points; the &quot;y&quot;-coordinates are trivially the function values at those &quot;x&quot;-coordinates.
The specific nature of a stationary point at &quot;x&quot; can in some cases be determined by examining the second derivative &quot;&quot;(&quot;x&quot;):
* If &quot;&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) &lt; 0, the stationary point at &quot;x&quot; is concave down; a maximal extremum.
* If &quot;&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) &gt; 0, the stationary point at &quot;x&quot; is concave up; a minimal extremum.
* If &quot;&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0, the nature of the stationary point must be determined by way of other means, often by noting a sign change around that point.

A more straightforward way of determining the nature of a stationary point is by examining the function values between the stationary points (if the function is defined and continuous between them).

A simple example of a point of inflection is the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;3. There is a clear change of concavity about the point &quot;x&quot; = 0, and we can prove this by means of calculus. The second derivative of &quot;f&quot; is the everywhere-continuous 6&quot;x&quot;, and at &quot;x&quot; = 0, &quot;&quot; = 0, and the sign changes about this point. So &quot;x&quot; = 0 is a point of inflection.

More generally, the stationary points of a real valued function formula_5 are those
points x0 where the derivative in every direction equals zero, or equivalently, the gradient is zero.

===Examples===
For the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;4 we have &#x27;(0) = 0 and &#x27;(0) = 0. Even though &#x27;(0) = 0, this point is not a point of inflection. The reason is that the sign of &#x27;(&quot;x&quot;) changes from negative to positive.

For the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = sin(&quot;x&quot;) we have &#x27;(0) ≠ 0 and &#x27;(0) = 0. But this is not a stationary point, rather it is a point of inflection. This is because the concavity changes from concave downwards to concave upwards and the sign of &quot;&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) does not change; it stays positive.

For the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;3 we have &#x27;(0) = 0 and &#x27;(0) = 0. This is both a stationary point and a point of inflection. This is because the concavity changes from concave downwards to concave upwards and the sign of &quot;&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) does not change; it stays positive.

For the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0, one has &#x27;(0) = 0 and &#x27;(0) = 0. The point 0 is a non-isolated stationary point which is not a turning point nor a horizontal point of inflection as the signs of &#x27;(&quot;x&quot;) and &#x27;(&quot;x&quot;) do not change.

The function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;5 sin(1/&quot;x&quot;) for &quot;x&quot; ≠ 0, and &quot;f&quot;(0) = 0, gives an example where &#x27;(&quot;x&quot;) and &#x27;(&quot;x&quot;) are both continuous, &#x27;(0) = 0 and &#x27;(0) = 0, and yet &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) does not have a local maximum, a local minimum, nor a point of inflection at 0. So, is a stationary point that is not isolated.

<doc id="885653" wikidata="Q722689" url="?curid=885653" title="James S. White">
<text>James Springer White (August 4, 1821 – August 6, 1881), also known as Elder White, was a co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the husband of Ellen G. White. In 1849, he started the first Sabbatarian Adventist periodical entitled &quot;The Present Truth&quot;, in 1855 he relocated the fledgling center of the movement to Battle Creek, Michigan, and in 1863 played a pivotal role in the formal organization of the denomination. He later played a major role in the development of the Adventist educational structure beginning in 1874 with the formation of Battle Creek College.

==Early life==
James White was born on August 4, 1821, in the town of Palmyra, Maine. The fifth of nine children, James was a sickly child who suffered fits and seizures. Poor eyesight prevented him from obtaining much education and he was required to work on the family farm. At age 19 his eyesight improved and he enrolled at a local academy. He earned a teaching certificate in the common branches and briefly taught at an elementary school. He was baptized into the Christian Connexion at age 15. He learned of the Millerite message from his parents and after hearing powerful preaching at an advent camp meeting in Exeter, Maine, White decided to leave teaching and become a preacher. Consequently, he has ordained a minister of the Christian Connexion in 1843. White was a powerful preacher, and it is recorded that during the winter of 1843, 1,000 people accepted the Millerite message owing to his preaching. At times, however, White was met with angry mobs who hurled snowballs at him. During these early travels he met Ellen G. Harmon whom he married on August 30, 1846. James White and Ellen G. White had four boys, Henry Nichols (1847–1863), James Edson (1849–1928), William Clarence (1854–1937) and John Herbert (1860–1860).

==Adventist service==
The paper which James White initially started, &quot;The Present Truth&quot;, was combined with another periodical called the &quot;Advent Review&quot; in 1850 to become the &quot;Second Advent Review and Sabbath Herald&quot;, still published as the &quot;Adventist Review&quot; today. This periodical became the main source of communication for the Sabbatarian Adventist movement regarding points of doctrine and organization. It also became a venue for James and Ellen White to quickly and efficiently share their views to like-minded believers. James White served as editor of the periodical until 1851 when he invited Uriah Smith to become editor. He played a senior role in the management of church publications as president of the Review and Herald Publishing Association. He also served on several occasions as president of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.(1865–1867; 1869–1871; 1874–1880).

In 1865 White suffered from a paralytic stroke. White eventually determined that he should retire from the ministry and live out his days gracefully. In 1880, G. I. Butler replaced him as General Conference president. During the summer of 1881, White came down with a fever and was taken to the Battle Creek Sanitarium. Despite the efforts of Dr. Kellogg, White died on August 6, 1881.

==Publications==
White was a prolific writer and publisher for the Adventists. Some of his most popular publications include:

*&quot;Life Incidents&quot; (1868). Republished by Andrews University Press with an introduction by Jerry Moon (publisher&#x27;s page)
*&quot;Word to the Little Flock&quot;, 1847 Pamphlet

<doc id="885655" wikidata="Q7528502" url="?curid=885655" title="Sir Purr">
<text>Sir Purr is the mascot of the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League. He is an anthropomorphized panther wearing a Panthers football jersey, No.00. The character was introduced in 1995. 

On his page at the Panthers&#x27; web site, he describes his favorites snacks as &quot;birds like falcons and eagles and seahawks.&quot; He has a running rivalry with Jaxson de Ville, the mascot of the Jacksonville Jaguars (the Panthers&#x27; expansion brethren). Sir Purr also has family that occasionally joins him in games, such as Mini Meow, a younger version of Sir Purr.

He caused a stir in a 1996 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers; on a Panthers punt, he jumped on the ball even though it was a live ball, turning the play into a touchback. In 2020, Sir Purr made a number of headlines when Panthers wide receiver Robby Anderson mistook him for a bear. This created a running joke within the Panthers organization which is still referenced today in Sir Purr&#x27;s Instagram bio.

== Charitable Outreach Programs ==
Sir Purr engages in a number of philanthropic ventures on behalf on the Panthers throughout North Carolina and South Carolina. These programs include the &quot;Purr&#x27;s Pals&quot; program and the &quot;Sack the Test program.&quot; These ventures tend to be directed towards children due to Sir Purr&#x27;s kid friendly appearance. Purr&#x27;s Pal&#x27;s is a program that gives away tickets to Panther&#x27;s home games to children through the Big Brother Big Sister organization. The Sack the Test program intends to prepare Carolinian kids for standardized testing.

== Alternative Outfits ==
Sir Purr has been seen in many outfits during his time as the Panthers&#x27; mascot. These include but are not limited to a Santa Claus suit, a camouflage military outfit, A suit resembling that of Uncle Sam, and a Fred Flintstone Halloween costume.

<doc id="885657" wikidata="Q1261144" url="?curid=885657" title="Khasi people">
<text>The Khasi people are an Austroasiatic ethnic group of Meghalaya in north-eastern India with a significant population in the bordering state of Assam and in certain parts of Bangladesh. Khasi people form the majority of the population of the eastern part of Meghalaya, that is Khasi Hills, constituting 78.3% of the region&#x27;s population, and is the state&#x27;s largest community, with around 48% of the population of Meghalaya. They are among the few Austroasiatic-speaking peoples in South Asia. The Khasi tribe holds the distinction of being one of the few remaining tribes that have a matrilineal society. Under the Constitution of India, the Khasis have been granted the status of Scheduled Tribe.

==Etymology==
==History ==
===Khasi mythology===

Khasi mythology traces the tribe&#x27;s original abode to (&quot;The Seven Huts&quot;). According to the Khasi mythology, (God, the Lord Master) had originally distributed the human race into 16 heavenly families (). However, seven out of these 16 families were stuck on earth while the other 9 in heaven. According to the myth, a heavenly ladder resting on the sacred Lum Sohpetbneng Peak (located in the present-day Ri-Bhoi district) enabled people to go freely and frequently to heaven whenever they pleased until one day they were tricked into cutting a divine tree which was situated at Lum Diengiei Peak (also in present-day East Khasi Hills district), a grave error which prevented them access to the heavens forever. This myth is often seen as a metaphor of how nature and trees, in particular, are the manifestation of the divine on Earth and destroying nature and trees means severing our ties with the Divine. Like the Japanese, the Khasis use the rooster as a symbol because they believe that it was he who aroused God and also humbly paved and cleared the path for God to create the Universe at the beginning of time. The rooster is the symbol of morning marking a new beginning and a new sunrise.

Khasian is closely related to Palaungic language of Myanmar. Pre-Khasian migrated through Upper Burma to Brahmaputra Valley on the way to Meghalaya.

===Language===

The Khasi language is classified as part of the Austroasiatic language family. According to Peter Wilhelm Schmidt, the Khasi people are related to the Mon-Khmer people of Southeast Asia. Multiple types of research indicate that the Austroasiatic populations in the Indian subcontinent are derived from migrations from Southeast Asia during the Holocene period. Many of the words are similar to other Austroasiatic languages such as Palaung and Khmer language:

* Tiger: in both Khasi and Khmer.
* To fly: in Khasi, &quot;haer&quot; in Khmer
* Belly: in Khasi, &quot;poh&quot; in Khmer, &quot;bụng&quot; in Vietnamese. 
* New:   or in Khasi, &quot;thmei&quot; or &quot;thmai&quot; in Khmer, &quot;mới&quot; in Vietnamese
* Year: in Khasi, &quot;chnem&quot; in Khmer, &quot;năm&quot; in Vietnamese 
* Far: in Khasi, &quot;chngay&quot; in Khmer, &quot;ngay&quot; in Vietnamese
* Leaf: or in Khasi, &quot;slaek&quot; in Khmer, &quot;lá&quot; in Vietnamese
* Crab: in Khasi, &quot;ktam&quot; in Khmer
* Fingers: in only the pnar dialect (Khasi sub-tribe), &quot;mreamdai&quot; in Khmer, &quot;ngon tây&quot; in Vietnamese. 
* Toes: in the pnar dialect (Khasi sub-tribe)], &quot;mreamcheung&quot; in Khmer, &quot;ngon chân&quot; in Vietnamese. 
* Children: , or in Khasi, &quot;kaun&quot;, &quot;kon&quot; in Khmer, &quot;con&quot; in Vietnamese
* Birds: in Khasi, &#x27;chim in Vietnamese
* Eyes: or in Khasi, mắt in Vietnamese
* Fish: in Khasi, &quot;cá&quot; in Vietnamese
* Mother: in Khasi, Mae in Khmer, &quot;mẹ&quot; in Vietnamese, mea also in the Thai a kra-dai language family
* Rice: in Khasi, Sraw or Angkhor or bay in Khmer, &quot;gạo&quot; in Vietnamese; in Thai also &quot;khaw&quot; 
* Python: &quot;Thlen&quot; in Khasi, P&quot;os thlan (snake)&quot; in Khmer&quot;.&quot; 

There are also words similar to those in Sino-Tibetan languages, such as meaning &quot;I,&quot; which is the same in Tibetan, Burmese, and Old Chinese as it is in Khasi. Traces of connections with the Kachin tribe of North Myanmar have also been in the Khasis. The Khasi people also have their own word for the Himalayan mountains which is &quot;Ki Lum Mankashang&quot; which means that at one point in time, they did cross the mighty mountains. Therefore, all these records and their present culture, features, and language strongly show that they also have a strong Tibeto-Himalayan-Burman influence. The word &quot;Khas&quot; means hills and they have always been people of cold and hilly regions and have never been connected to the plains or arid regions. This nature-loving tribe calls the wettest place on Earth their home. The village of Mawsynram in Meghalaya receives 467 inches of rain per year.

Primarily an oral language, they had no script of their own, until the arrival of the Welsh missionaries. The Welsh missionaries originally used the Bengali script before resorting to the Roman script to transcribe the Sohra dialect of the Khasi language. Particularly significant in this regard was a Welsh evangelist, Thomas Jones.

===Modern times===

The Khasi first came in contact with the British in 1823, after the latter captured Assam. The area inhabited by the Khasi became a part of the Assam Province after the Khasi Hill States (which numbered to about 25 kingdoms) entered into a subsidiary alliance with the British.

The main crops produced by the Khasi people are betel leaves, areca nut, oranges, pineapples, plums, litchis, local varieties of rice and vegetables.

== Geographical distribution and sub-groups ==
Many Khasi sociologists classify the Khasi tribe in the following seven sub-tribes, which are collectively also known as &#x27;U Hynñiewtrep&#x27; or &#x27;Khasi&#x27;: 

* Khynriam (or Nongphlang): inhabit the uplands of the East Khasi Hills district.
* Pnar (or Synteng) live in the uplands of the Jaintia Hills district. 
* Bhoi live in the lower hills to the north and north-east of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills towards the Brahmaputra valley in a vast area in Ri-Bhoi district. 
* War subdivided into War-Jaintia and War-Khynriam tribes live on the steep southern slopes of Khasi Hills leading to Bangladesh.
* Maram inhabit the uplands of the central parts of West Khasi Hills District. 
* Lyngngam inhabit the western parts of the West Khasi Hills district bordering the Garo Hills display linguistic and cultural characteristics which show influences from both the Khasis to their east and the Garo people to the west. 
* Diko are extinct group who once inhabited the lowlands of the West Khasi Hills District.

According to the 2011 Census of India, over 1.41 million Khasi lived in Meghalaya in the districts of East Khasi Hills, West Khasi Hills, South West Khasi Hills, Eastern West Khasi Hills, Ri-Bhoi, West Jaintia Hills and East Jaintia Hills which togetherly constitute the Eastern part of Meghalaya&#x27;s Khasi and Jaintia Hills region. In Assam, their population reached 35 thousand. In Bangladesh&#x27;s Sylhet Division specially in Jaflong, around 85 thousand Khasis are living there.

Khasi inhabiting the northern part are known as Bhoi, as that area is often called Ri Bhoi. People in the east are known as the Pnar, and they call their land Rilum Jaintia. The south are called War or Ri War, because of its mountainous regions and soil fertility. The west has a number of regional names: Maram, Rimen, Khatsawphra, Mawiang, Lyngam. A Khasi who inhabits the central area is known as Khynriam. The War inhabitants of the Khasi community designed and built living root bridges of the War region.

==Dress==

The traditional costume of the Khasis is known to be &#x27;i shongkun bad i Don burom&quot; which translates to being grand/respectful and modest.

The traditional Khasi male dress is a , a longish sleeveless coat without collar, fastened by thongs in front. Nowadays, most male Khasis have adopted western attire. On ceremonial occasions they appear in a and sarong with an ornamental waist-band and they may also wear a turban.

The traditional Khasi female dress is called the or , both of which are rather elaborate with several pieces of cloth, giving the body a cylindrical shape. On ceremonial occasions, they may wear a crown of silver or gold. A spike or peak is fixed to the back of the crown, corresponding to the feathers worn by the menfolk. The consists of two pieces of material fastened at each shoulder. The &quot;Dhara&quot; consists of a single piece of material also fastened at each shoulder.

Weaving Ryndia is an art passed down through the generations and treated as an occupation, providing livelihood to families in the region. Traditionally a hand-spun, hand-woven fabric, worn with pride by both the men and women in Meghalaya, the fabric in its un-dyed off-white state, or maroon and mustard plaid design, is a cultural symbol of the Khasi people. Eri silk is also known as &#x27;peace silk&#x27; as the production process is considered to be non-violent. Weaving is primarily done by women. Eri silk in Meghalaya is produced from start to finish by women working from home or in clusters.
== Marriage ==
The Khasis are, for the most part, monogamous. Young men and women are permitted considerable freedom in the choice of partners. Potential marriage partners are likely to have met before betrothal. Once a man has selected his desired spouse, he reports his choice to his parents. They then secure the services of a mediator to make the arrangements with the woman&#x27;s family (provided that the man&#x27;s clan agree with his choice). The parents of the woman ascertain her wishes and if she agrees to the arrangement her parents check to make certain that the man to be wed is not a member of their clan (since Khasi clans are exogamous, marital partners may not be from the same clan). If this is satisfactory then a wedding date is set.

Divorce is relatively common, with causes ranging from incompatibility to lack of offspring. This ceremony traditionally consists of the husband handing the wife 5 cowries or paisa which the wife then hands back to her husband along with 5 of her own. The husband then throws these away or gives them to a village elder who throws them away. Present-day Khasis divorce through the Indian legal system.

The type of marriage is the determining factor in the marital residence. In short, post marital residence for a married man when an heiress (known as or ) is involved must be matrilocal (that is, in his mother-in-law&#x27;s house), while post-marital residence when a non-heiress is involved is neolocal. Traditionally (though nowadays this rule is not absolutely true), a Khasi man returns to his Iing-Kur (maternal home) upon the death of his spouse (if she is a Khadduh and they both have no children). These practices are the result of rules governing inheritance and property ownership. These rules are themselves related to the structure of the Khasi Kur (clan system).

== Onomastics ==
Khasi names are known for their originality and elaborate nature and often literal nature. The given names may be invented by parents for their children, and these can be based on traditional native names, Christian names, or other English words. The family names, which they call &quot;surnames,&quot; remain in the native Khasi languages or its dialects.

== Traditional politics ==

The traditional political structure of the Khasi community is democratic in nature. In the past, the Khasis consisted of independent native states called Syiemships, where male elders of various clans under the leadership of the Chief (called U Syiem) would congregate during Durbars or sessions and come to a decision regarding any dispute or problem that would arise in the Syiemship. At the village level, there exists a similar arrangement where all the residents of the village or town come together under the leadership of an elected Headman (called U Rangbah Shnong) to decide on matters pertaining to the locality. This system of village administration is much like the Panchayati Raj prevalent in most Indian States. There were around 25 independent native states on record which were annexed and acceded to the Indian Union. The Syiems of these native states (called Hima) were traditionally elected by the people or ruling clans of their respective domains. Famous among these Syiemships are Hima Mylliem, Hima Khyrim, Hima Nongkhlaw, amongst others. These Syiemships continue to exist and function till today under the purview of the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC), which draws its legal power and authority from the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India.

== Religion ==


Before the arrival of Christian missionaries and post- conversion, almost all of the Khasi people practised an indigenous tribal religion. The first translation of the Bible into any of the languages of Northeast India was a Khasi version, published in 1891 by missionaries. The main Christian denominations today followed among the Khasis include Catholicism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism (largest Christian denomination among the Khasis), and others. Around 83.14% of the Khasi tribe numbering around 1.17 million are Christian of various denominations (mainly Presbyterian and Catholic) and 15.41% of them numbering around still follow their Indigenous khasi religion called &quot;Ka Niam Khasi&quot; which is monotheistic in nature. In Khasi traditional religion Niam Khasi, the principal deity U Blei Nongthaw, who is One and formless is the Supreme creator of the whole universe.

A significant small number of Khasi population also adheres to Hindu and Buddhist faith. As per as 2011 census, around 10.3 thousands Khasi people have stated their religion as Hindu and Around 1.8 thousand Khasis follow Buddhism. Lesli Hardinge Pde, a 73-year-old retired Meghalaya civil servant, who is also an Khasi actor, comedian have translated Bhagavad Gita into Khasi language, locally known as &quot;The Song of God or in Khasi, Ka Jingrwai U Blei&quot;. The book was published on 9 May 2011. The author have also translated the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Upanishads into Khasi. Historians suggested that the Kamakhya temple of Assam&#x27;s Nilachal Hills was an ancient sacrificial site for an Austroasiatic tribal goddess, locally called or known as &quot;Ka Mei Kha&quot; (literally: &quot;old-cousin-mother&quot;), of the Khasi tribe supported by the folk lores of these very peoples. The traditional accounts from Kalika Purana of (10th century) and the Yogini Tantra too recorded that the goddess Kamakhya is of Kirata origin, and It is said that the worship of Kamakhya goddess predates the establishment of Kamarupa in (4th century CE).

There is also an endogamous very small community of Khasi Muslims, mostly residing in Shillong and adjoining areas of the city, who accepted Sunni Islam as a result of historic Muslim traders in the region. On 3 February 2019, Quran, Islamic Holy Book, was released in the Khasi language. The translation of 1251 pre-pages and pages of Quran, was done by a Khasi Muslim leader Mubarak Lyngdoh, to propagates Islam among the local Khasis. The translation was done at the initiative of the Seng Bhalang Islam (A local Islamic organisation of Shillong, Meghalaya). Khasi Muslims numbers around 1,689 as per 2011 census. 

There are also a small segment of Khasi population who don&#x27;t follow any particular faith. Around 6.8 thousand Khasis have stated that they are atheist and don&#x27;t believe in any particular religion or God as per 2011 census.

== Fertility rate ==
According to a 1998-99 research by the National Family Health Survey of India (NFHS), the Khasi tribe, along with Jaintia and Garo had the highest fertility in India at TFR=4.57.

==Genetics==
According to a genetic study in 2007, paternally, the Khasi people of Meghalaya carry around 72.8% Haplogroup O, 10.8% Haplogroup F, 6.5% halpogroup H and 4.4% Haplogroup P.

<text>The Valmikis are a variety of communities throughout India who all claim descent from the legendary author of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Valmiki. The Valmikis can be classified as a caste or &quot;sampradaya&quot; (tradition/sect). 

In the north-west Punjab region, this caste had adopted Sikhism. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, many Valmiki were prominent rebels. Notable examples include Matadin Bhangi, Gangu Mehtar and Bhura Singh Valmiki.

According to the 2001 Census of India, the Valmikis formed 11.2 per cent of the Scheduled Caste population in the Indian state of Punjab and were the second-most populous Scheduled Caste in Delhi National Capital Region. The 2011 Census of India for Uttar Pradesh showed the Valmiki population, which was classified as a Scheduled Caste, as 1,319,241.

<text>Gilbert de la Porrée (; after 1085 – 4 September 1154), also known as Gilbert of Poitiers, Gilbertus Porretanus or Pictaviensis, was a scholastic logician and theologian and Bishop of Poitiers.

== Life ==

He was born in Poitiers, and completed his first studies there. He was then educated under Bernard of Chartres at Chartres, where he was schooled in the differences between the teachings of Aristotle and Plato, and later under Anselm of Laon and Ralph of Laon at Laon, where he studied the Scriptures. After his education, he returned to Poitiers, where it is believed he taught. Subsequently he then returned to Chartres to teach logic and theology and succeeded Bernard of Chartres as Chancellor from 1126 to 1140. He is also known to have lectured in Paris. From a passage from the text, &quot;Dialogue with Ratius and Everard&quot;, by the Cistercian Everard, it would appear that Gilbert was more popular in Paris than in Chartres. Everard writes that he was the fourth to attend Gilbert&#x27;s lectures in Chartres and the three hundredth to attend in Paris. One of those attending Gilbert&#x27;s lectures in Paris, in 1141, was John of Salisbury, who was greatly influenced by them. John would later become chancellor of Chartres and also wrote about Gilbert saying: He taught grammar and theology, and would whip a student who made a grammatical error. If he believed a student was wasting time in class, he would suggest he take up bread making, and last when he lectured he used philosophers, orators and as well as poets to help interpret.

In the 1140s Gilbert published his Commentary on Boethius&#x27;s, Opuscula Sacra. Although intended as an explanation of what Boethius meant, it interpreted the Holy Trinity in such a way as went against the teachings of the church. In 1142, Gilbert became Bishop of Poitiers, and within the same year two archdeacons, Arnaud and Calon, denounced him for his ideas on the Trinity. It was also in 1142 when Gilbert&#x27;s teaching post in Chartres was taken over. By 1147, in Paris, Peter Lombard attacked Gilbert for his trinitarian doctrine. In 1148, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, known as the great detector of heresies, brought Gilbert to trial. Saint Bernard had previously had reasons to believe Gilbert was a heretic because when Abelard was tried and condemned, the school of Chartres, where Gilbert was chancellor at that moment, supported Abelard. Pope Eugene III presided over the trial, during which Gilbert and Bernard were asked to cite and explain specific biblical texts. Bernard, lacking Gilbert&#x27;s experience of the technique of the schools, was not able to condemn him. It was nevertheless decided to require Gilbert to reformulate parts of his book.

Gilbert died in 1154. He was buried at the Église Saint-Hilaire-le-Grand in Poitiers.

Gilbert is almost the only logician of the 12th century who is quoted by the greater scholastics of the succeeding age. The &quot;Liber sex principiorum&quot;, attributed to him, but in fact the work of an anonymous author, was regarded with a reverence almost equal to that paid to Aristotle, and furnished matter for numerous commentators, amongst them Albertus Magnus. Owing to the fame of this work, he is mentioned by Dante as the &quot;Magister sex principiorum&quot;. The treatise itself is a discussion of the Aristotelian categories, specially of the six subordinate modes.
The author distinguishes in the ten categories two classes, one essential, the other derivative. Essential or inhering (formae inhaerentes) in the objects themselves are only substance, quantity, quality and relation in the stricter sense of that term. The remaining six, when, where, action, passion, position and habit, are relative and subordinate (formae assistantes). This suggestion has some interest, but is of no great value, either in logic or in the theory of knowledge. More important in the history of scholasticism are the theological consequences to which Gilbert&#x27;s realism led him.

In the commentary on Boethius&#x27; treatise &quot;De Trinitate&quot; he proceeds from the metaphysical notion that pure or abstract being is prior in nature to that which is. This pure being is God, and must be distinguished from the triune God as known to us. God is incomprehensible, and the categories cannot be applied to determine his existence. In God there is no distinction or difference, whereas in all substances or things there is duality, arising from the element of matter. Between pure being and substances stand the ideas or forms, which subsist, though they are not substances. These forms, when materialized, are called &quot;formae substantiales&quot; or &quot;formae nativae&quot;; they are the essences of things, and in themselves have no relation to the accidents of things. Things are temporal, the ideas perpetual, God eternal. The pure form of existence, that by which God is God, must be distinguished from the three persons who are God by participation in this form. The form or essence is one, the persons or substances three. This distinction clearly goes against the church&#x27;s tenet of divine simplicity. It was this distinction between &quot;Deitas&quot; or &quot;Divinitas&quot; and &quot;Deus&quot; that led to the condemnation of Gilbert&#x27;s doctrine.

<text>The Jaguar XJ-S (later called XJS) is a luxury grand tourer manufactured and marketed by British car manufacturer Jaguar Cars from 1975 to 1996, in coupé, fixed-profile and full convertible bodystyles. There were three distinct iterations, with a final production total of 115,413 units over 20 years and seven months.

Originally developed using the platform of the then-current XJ saloon, the XJ-S was noted for its prominent rear buttresses. The early styling was partially by Jaguar&#x27;s aerodynamicist Malcolm Sayer—one of the first designers to apply advanced aero principles to cars—however Sayer died in 1970, before the design was finalised.

Its final iteration, produced from 1991 to 1996, was manufactured after Jaguar was acquired by Ford, who introduced numerous modifications – and eliminated the hyphen in the name, marketing Jaguar&#x27;s longest running model simply as the &quot;XJS.&quot;

== Pre-HE (1975–1981) ==

The XJ-S was introduced on 10 September 1975. The design and development had begun in the late 1960s by the code name of project XJ27, with an initial shape penned by Malcolm Sayer, but after his death in 1970 it was completed by the in-house Jaguar design team, headed by Doug Thorpe. Power came from the Jaguar V12 engine with a choice of a manual or an automatic transmission, but the manual was soon dropped as they were left over from V12 E Type production. V12 powered production automobiles were unusual at the time; Italian luxury sports car makers Lamborghini and Ferrari produced such models. The specifications of the XJ-S compared well with both Italian cars; it was able to accelerate to in 7.6 seconds (automatic models) and had a top speed of . The first series of XJ-S cars had a BorgWarner Model 12 transmission with a cast-iron case and a bolt-on bell-housing. In 1977, General Motors&#x27; Turbo-Hydramatic 400 transmissions were fitted. The TH400 transmission was an all-aluminium alloy case with an integrated non-detachable bell-housing. The XJ-S was originally supplied with Dunlop SP Super E205/70VR15 tyres on 6K alloy wheels; British police upgraded their Jaguars to a higher-performance 205/70VR15 Michelin XWX tyres. At the end of the 1970s Jaguar started to fit the 205/70VR15 Pirelli P5. The Pirelli P5 was the tyre that Jaguar had asked Pirelli to produce to improve their luxury cars. European and Canadian spec XJ-S models were fitted with two molded headlights, while models for the US (until 1992) were fitted with four round sealed beam lights due to legislation. 

Jaguar launched the XJ-S in the wake of a fuel crisis, when the market for a 5.3-litre V12 grand tourer was small. The buttresses behind the windows were criticised at the time as German authorities feared these would restrict rearward vision, and refused to give type approval to the XJ-S (and to the similarly designed Lancia Montecarlo) – requiring German XJ-S buyers to obtain road approval for each individual car upon registration. Sales remained stubbornly low, and production was halted for half of 1981, to allow unsold stock to be moved. Because of the slow sales, Leyland Cars had decided to discontinue the car but decided to give it another chance with a light facelift and engine revisions.

Italian styling house Pininfarina introduced a 1978 concept car based on the XJ-S, called the Jaguar XJSpider; which did not see production.

==HE (1981–1991) ==
From July 1981, the XJ-S was renamed the XJ-S HE and received the new High-Efficiency V12 engine for much better fuel economy. A positive side effect of the more efficient &quot;Fire Ball&quot; combustion chamber designed by Swiss Engineer Michael May was that power output was increased to or in North America. At the same time, the XJ-S HE received changes to its exterior and interior: there was body-coloured boot trim in place of the standard previous black, new five-spoke &quot;Starfish&quot; alloy wheels fitted with 215/70R15 Pirelli Cinturato P5 tyres, chrome inserts on the upper part of the bumpers, and elm inserts on dashboard and door cappings.

===Six-cylinder and convertible models===

In 1983, the new 3.6-litre Jaguar AJ6 straight-six engine was introduced along with a new convertible model called the XJ-SC. The coupé&#x27;s rather small rear seats were removed in order to make space for the removable soft top, making it a strict two-seater car. The XJ-SC was not a full convertible but was a fixed profile variant with a non-removable centre targa-type structure, fixed cant rails above the doors, and fixed rear quarter windows. The six-cylinder cars can be identified by a raised bonnet centre section.

Between 1983 and 1987, the six-cylinder-engined cars were only available with a five-speed manual transmission (Getrag 265), with a four-speed automatic (ZF 4HP22) offered from 1987 onwards (along with improved fuel injection as used on the XJ40). The earlier, manual models were not imported by Jaguar into the United States, which had to wait until the facelift manual 4-litre XJS coupé and convertible became available. A V12 powered XJ-SC was introduced in 1985.

The two-seat XJ-SC targa-type model, never a great success in the marketplace, was replaced by a two-seat full convertible in 1988 which proved to be a great hit.

XJ-SC

The first XJ-SC was produced on June 28, 1982, the last January 26, 1988. In all 5013 XJ-SC Cabriolets were built. These cars were different in that they had a Targa/Convertible body style with removable Targa panels over the two seater passenger compartment, similar to T-tops, plus a fabric rear section including the rear window; there was an optional hard top for the rear section. Approximately 1598 Right Hand Drive and 3416 Left Hand Drive cars built. Whilst there are a small number of the XJ-SC cars with the rear seat conversion, Jaguar Cars only ever produced one such car which was specially built for Princess Diana. The rear roof section on this car was fully secured in place and could not be removed. This conversion was later carried out by several aftermarket companies on owners cars, not with the approval of the works.

===Hess &amp; Eisenhardt convertible===
From 1986, a full convertible version was available through some dealers, modified by Hess &amp; Eisenhardt in the USA. The Hess &amp; Eisenhardt coachbuilding firm was located in Ohio, USA, and built convertible modifications for the XJ-S under contract from Jaguar, before the official Jaguar-built XJ-S full convertible became available in 1988.

The Hess &amp; Eisenhardt convertible differed from the later Jaguar-built XJS convertible as its un-padded top folded down deeper into the body structure of the car resulting in a cleaner rear profile when the roof was lowered. To accommodate this design element, the Hess &amp; Eisenhardt convertibles have two separate fuel tanks, positioned to allow for the roof to fully retract. The process of converting the stock Jaguar XJS coupé into the H&amp;E Convertible included the post-production removal of the roof, cutting the body in several sections, the addition of steel reinforcements behind the driver&#x27;s seat, and weights placed just behind the headlights to eliminate harmonic resonance caused by the significant modifications to the car. H&amp;E XJS convertibles are easily identified by the lower folding top, as well as two small badges located just behind the front wheels. The later Jaguar full convertible had a heavier padded top that did not fold as low as the H&amp;E convertible, but retained nearly all of the original components of the coupé.

The number of H&amp;E Jaguar XJS produced is unknown, partly because a fire at the Hess &amp; Eisenhardt factory destroyed most of the records pertaining to the Jaguar XJS conversions. According to some sources, a total of 2,100 cars were converted.

===Police demonstrator===

In 1984, a Jaguar XJS with a 3.6l engine and manual transmission was converted by Jaguar Special Vehicle Operations into a Police Special demonstrator vehicle, fitted with a police lightbar on the roof, a police radio in the centre console and plastic interior trim including cloth seats to replace luxury furnishings. The Police Special XJS demonstrator was loaned by Jaguar to a number of police forces across the United Kingdom, including the Warwickshire Constabulary, Greater Manchester Police and the Metropolitan Police, however no orders resulted from the trials due to a lack of interior space for traffic police equipment or for passengers. After retirement from demonstration services, the XJS was first donated to the Greater Manchester Police Museum before later being handed to the Jaguar Daimler Heritage Trust, with whom it would become an exhibit vehicle at the British Motor Museum in Gaydon, Warwickshire.

===XJR-S===
From 1988 to 1993, a special high performance XJR-S version equipped with the HE V12 engine was produced by the newly formed JaguarSport, a separate company owned in a ratio of 50:50 by Jaguar and TWR Group Limited specialising in developing high performance Jaguar sports cars. The car had a distinctive body kit, special 15&quot; alloy wheels, 235/60R15 Pirelli P600 tyres, a unique suspension system utilising modified coil springs and Bilstein shocks, a luxurious interior with Connolly Autolux leather along with walnut wood trim, and handling improvements. The first 100 of these cars were named &quot;Celebration Le Mans&quot; to commemorate Jaguar&#x27;s 1988 win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and were only sold in the UK. Between 1988 and 1989, a total of 326 XJR-S cars were produced with the engine which has a power output of . After September 1989, the displacement of the engine was increased to and it was now equipped with Zytek fuel injection and engine management system. This was different from the standard 6.0-litre engine used in the late XJS models and was unique to this model. The power output was raised to at 5,250 rpm and of torque at 3,650 rpm due to a higher compression ratio of 11.0:1, a new forged steel crankshaft, increased bore and forged alloy pistons. A modified air intake system and a low loss dual exhaust system was also standard on the model. The engine was mated to the 3-speed GM400 automatic transmission utilising a recalibrated valve body and had faster shift times. The car was equipped with 16&quot; Dunlop D40 M2 tyres for better grip. These modifications resulted in a top speed of . During a comparison test conducted by Motorsport magazine in 1997, the XJR-S outperformed the other competitors which included a BMW 850i, Porsche 928 GT and a Ferrari Mondial.

A total of 787 coupés and 50 convertible cars were built for the world market. In the United States, to commemorate the XJ220 launch in 1992, a limited number of 100 XJR-S coupés and convertibles were produced. Based on the facelift model, these were for the American market only. These included 22 Signal Red coupés, 22 Signal Red convertibles, 22 Jet Black coupés, 27 Jet Black convertibles, 2 Flamenco Red coupés, and the Silver Frost &#x27;Press Cars&#x27; of 4 coupés and 1 convertible.

===Daimler===

Jaguar considered a luxury Daimler version to be marketed as the &quot;Daimler-S&quot;, notably without the buttresses and with only a single prototype built in 1986. Paul Banham did produce some custom notch back coupés without buttresses, larger rear side windows, and a narrow C-pillars. In the mid-90s, Banham also made a reworked version called the XJSS based on the XJS.
== Facelift (1991–1996) ==
The XJS was relaunched in its final form in May 1991 under Ford Motor Company&#x27;s new ownership, as a division of its Premier Auto Group. Ford dropped the model name&#x27;s hyphen, marketing it as the XJS. By removing the frames, the rear side windows appeared enlarged despite having identical glass apertures as the earlier cars, the windscreen was flush fitting, while the buttresses remained – somewhat minimised by the new side window trim. Designer Geoff Lawson noted the buttresses were part of the car&#x27;s character. The rear fascia and trunk lid were redesigned, with new black tinted rear lights being fitted. The V12 engine was also upgraded with new injection and fuel system, new spark plugs, and a tidier engine room. Power for the catalyzed, European-market version inched up from .

The car received a new 4.0-litre version of the AJ6 straight-six engine. In 1992, a convertible model having the same engine was added to the range. The V12 engine&#x27;s capacity was enlarged to 6.0 litres in May 1992 and it had a power output of . With the introduction of the 6.0-litre V12, the transmission was also updated to a GM 4L80E with a fourth-gear overdrive, whilst the automatic 4.0-litre models continued with the electronic ZF4HP24E transmission. A 2+2 convertible was also introduced, as was a customised &quot;insignia&quot; line. At the same time, the car received more aerodynamic front and rear bumpers that were now painted the same colour as the body. The main interior change was to the instrument pack; the original featured distinctive drum type ancillary gauges - this was replaced by a more conventional style binnacle similar to that found in the XJ40 saloon. Outboard rear brakes replaced the more complicated inboard brakes of previous models from May 1993.

In April 1994, substantial revisions were made to the 4.0-litre AJ6 engine, which was now equipped with coil-on-plug ignition and given the new code name AJ16. In 1995, the final specification changes were made and the car was referred to as the Celebration model, to celebrate the 60th year of Jaguar Cars. Celebration cars feature diamond turned wheels, Jaguar embossed seats, and a wooden steering wheel.

The XJS was discontinued in 1996, after 21 years in production, superseded by the XK8, which continued to use a modified version of the XJS platform until 2005.


== Aftermarket modifications ==
TWR XJS

Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR) formed JaguarSport in partnership with Jaguar in 1988. XJR-S was their first model. But prior to 1988, specifically between 1984 and 1988, TWR offered sporting versions of XJS coupe and cabriolet cars. Various bodywork, trim and engine upgrade options were available on both the 3.6 litre 6-cylinder and 5.3 litre V12 vehicles. These cars are particularly unique and rare, often misinterpreted and misunderstood due to the poor record keeping for the pre-1988 cars. Further confusion is caused by the production of later XJR-S &quot;JaguarSport&quot; cars to similar specifications.

Some of the known upgrades included engine and transmission, low drag body kit, special bumper kit (for North American market), 8&quot;x16&quot; low drag Speedline Italian made alloy wheels fitted with &quot;TWR&quot; centre cap (very similar to later XJR-S wheels fitted with &quot;Sport&quot; centre cap), TWR suspension kit, TWR brake kit, TWR steering wheel, manual gearbox (5-speed close ratio), automatic gearbox quick shift kit, automatic gearshift lever (screw on leather type as used on XJR-S), TWR power assisted steering valve and others.

TWR body kits included a rear spoiler with a distinctive hole for radio antenna on the right hand side. It was also shaped differently than later XJR-S spoilers as it stood higher and had more distinctive flaps on the sides.

The fibreglass side mouldings (side skirts) were equipped with rubber seams.

Front bumper modifications included removal of the chrome and reinforcing front air dam and rear bumper featured exhaust exit apertures and rear integrated fog lights.

=== Lynx Eventer ===


A number of XJS&#x27;s were modified by coachbuilders Lynx to create a three-door shooting brake, marketed as the &quot;Lynx Eventer&quot;. Records suggest that 52 pre-facelift XJ-S, and 15 post-facelift XJS, were adapted, with 18 being left hand drive and 49 being right hand drive.

=== Lister-Jaguar XJS ===
In 1986, the newly-formed Lister Cars, under the leadership of engineer Laurence Pearce, began offering a high performance package for the Jaguar XJS. The cars were sold as Lister-Jaguar and 90 customer cars in total were converted. Lister teamed up with two manufacturers namely WP Automotive and BLE Automotive to carry out the conversion process. The standard package included increased engine displacement to 7.0-litres, a modified fuel injection system with four additional injectors and throttle bodies, larger engine valves along with connecting rods manufactured by Cosworth, a new crankshaft, new cylinder heads, new inlet and exhaust valves, new bearing caps, and a new body kit featuring a spoiler at the rear with a modified rear light clusters and flared wheel arches to accommodate the wide tyres. The modified suspension system featured Koni dampers having 30% stiffer rebound than the original and having a modified rear subframe arrangement with wishbones and radius arms relocated to provide greater triangulation and reduce axle tramp. The new shocks were 100% stiffer at the front and 50% stiffer at the rear. The braking system had ventilated brake discs and were moved outward for better cooling and stability. The interior was also modified and now had Recaro racing bucket seats and a new steering wheel with optimised feedback. The modified engine was rated at and of torque. The engine was mated to a 5-speed Getrag manual transmission. The cars were fitted with 17-inch wheels with wide Pirelli tyres measuring 10 inches at the front and 13 inches at the rear. Performance figures include a 0- acceleration time of 4.5 seconds and a top speed of .

Some customers chose to have their cars further modified with the addition of the Le Mans package. The package included a 6-speed Getrag manual transmission, a new exhaust system, and twin-superchargers over the standard package applied in order to extract a power output of from the engine.
=== XJS Monaco ===

Under license from Jaguar build by Paul Bailey Design. The Sultan of Brunei is said to have purchased two of the 11 cars completed.

==Motorsport==
For 1977, the &quot;Group 44&quot; racing team had a very successful season in Trans Am with a race car based on the actual production XJ-S chassis and running gear. The team won the series&#x27; 1977 drivers&#x27; championship cup for Bob Tullius but missed winning the manufacturer&#x27;s title by two points (only one Jaguar was competing in the Trans-Am series compared to many more Porsche entrants). In 1978, a purpose-built tube-frame &quot;silhouette&quot; style XJS race car was constructed which greatly reduced the weight compared to the full production chassis car campaigned in 1977. This silhouette car had only the production car&#x27;s roof panel as the sole piece of factory XJS sheetmetal on the car. Group 44 succeeded in again capturing the driver&#x27;s championship for Bob Tullius and also captured the manufacturer&#x27;s title as well, by entering Brian Fuerstenau driving the 1977 car at some venues to gain additional manufacturer&#x27;s points for Jaguar. The silhouette car survived and has surfaced recently in the SVRA historic sports race series. The 1977 factory chassis race car is believed to still be in the hands of Group 44&#x27;s Bob Tullius.

In April 1979 a Jaguar XJS driven by Dave Heinz and Dave Yarborough was entered into &quot;Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash&quot;, widely known simply as the Cannonball Run. They completed the from New York to Los Angeles in a record time of 32 hours and 51 minutes, a record that stood for 4 years, until it was beaten by David Diem and Doug Turner in a Ferrari 308. Diem and Turner covered the same distance in 32 hours and 7 minutes on the US Express, an unofficial successor to the Cannonball Run.

===Tom Walkinshaw Racing===
British Leyland had approached Tom Walkinshaw&#x27;s TWR in 1981 with the goal of identifying the BL car which would be best suited to race under FIA&#x27;s new, Group A touring car rules in the European Touring Car Championship. Walkinshaw hit upon the XJS, rather than the Rover 3500 that BL wanted to use, as its double wishbone suspension would allow it to fit the widest possible wheels under the Group A regulations. British Leyland was still smarting from the failure of the XJC racing programme in 1977 and opted not to provide factory backing for the new effort. TWR moved forward with the project, depending on outside sponsors like Akai and Motul instead, although Jaguar did provide some engineering support.

The XJS won its first race that season when Walkinshaw and Chuck Nicholson won the XIV Grand Prix Brno, the cars simply proving too fast for their rival BMW 530/530i and Alfa Romeo GTV6 opposition with Walkinshaw qualifying 5.37 seconds faster than anyone else on the 10.925 km (6.789 mi) Brno Circuit. After more victories for the team&#x27;s Jaguars in 1983 (including lapping the 20.81 km (12.93 mi) Nürburgring Nordschleife circuit in 7:56.00), the TWR Jaguars were the cars to beat in the ETCC, with Walkinshaw claiming the 1984 ETCC Drivers&#x27; Championship. During the championship season the TWR Jaguar team also won the prestigious Spa 24 Hours race with an XJS driven by Walkinshaw, Hans Heyer and Win Percy, proving not only the speed of the cars but the reliability of the 5.3 litre V12 engine. By 1984 the TWR Jaguars had a new challenger in the ETCC. The turbocharged Volvo 240T run by Eggenberger Motorsport arrived on the scene and had the speed to match the V12, though with turbocharging new to touring car racing it took a number of races for reliability to match the cars&#x27; speed.

By the end of 1984 the TWR developed V12 engines in the XJS were rated at approximately .

By 1985 the XJS had been retired from European competition and TWR was committed to running the 3.5L V8 Rover Vitesse in the ETCC. Walkinshaw had been to the 1984 James Hardie 1000 at the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, Australia, to co-drive a locally developed Australian Group C XJS with Australian driver John Goss. Walkinshaw qualified in provisional 7th place with a 2:16.09 lap of the 6.172 km (3.835 mi) circuit, recording a top speed of on the 2 km long Conrod Straight, with the promise of more to come in the &quot;Hardies Heroes&quot; Top 10 runoff through the use of special tyres. However, the tyres failed to arrive at the circuit in time and Walkinshaw eventually qualified 10th having to use front wheels on the car as no suitable rubber was available. Clutch failure saw the car fail to get off the start line and a helpless Walkinshaw was hit from behind by a Chevrolet Camaro Z28, causing the car&#x27;s instant retirement and the race&#x27;s first ever restart after the track was blocked at the start/finish line.

The Scot was determined to come back in 1985 and win the race in the first season of Group A in Australia and in 1985 the three TWR XJS Jaguars were brought out of retirement for the James-Hardie 1000. The cars were clearly the class of the field, finishing Hardies Heroes in 1st (Walkinshaw/Percy in #8), 2nd (Jeff Allam/Ron Dickson in #9) and 6th (Goss/Armin Hahne in #10). This time the cars got off the start line and Walkinshaw and Percy dominated most of the race, only losing the lead to the Goss/Hahne car during pit stops (the Allam/Dickson car went out on lap 3 with engine failure). The drivers of the #10 car, who had to battle a broken seat which was held loosely in place by straps and cable ties for well over 100 laps, sat in second most of the way until a split oil line late in the race cost the Walkinshaw/Percy car 3 laps and any chance of victory. 1974 Bathurst 1000 winner Goss won his second &quot;Great Race&quot; while Hahne, who had won the Group A category in the 1984 race driving a TWR Rover, maintained his 100% record with his only Bathurst 1000 win. After having the oil line replaced, Walkinshaw resumed in 4th place but easily caught and passed the JPS Team BMW 635 CSi of 1985 Australian Touring Car Champion Jim Richards in the last laps to make it a Jaguar 1–3, with Walkinshaw following Goss across the finish line in a formation finish.

The TWR XJS Jaguars were next seen late in 1986 at the Fuji 500 in Japan in what was meant to be its Group A swansong as it ran out of FIA homologation in at the end of the year. Against old foes in the BMW 635 CSi and Volvo 240T, as well as newer Group A cars such as the Australian Holden VK Commodore SS Group A V8 and the turbocharged Nissan Skyline DR30 RS, Walkinshaw qualified the XJS on pole, proving how competitive the car could still be in Touring car racing (the cars had been entered in the 1986 Bathurst 1000 and had undergone testing and development which gave a reported an extra , though the car ultimately did not race due to a lack of funding from Jaguar Rover Australia to help with freight costs). The Fuji race saw the Walkinshaw/Percy car lead the race until retiring on lap 6 with no oil pressure after easily holding off the Holden Commodore of Peter Brock on the circuit&#x27;s 1.5 km (0.93 mi) main straight, while the Hahne/Denny Hulme/Walkinshaw car only lasted until half distance before retiring with a broken differential.

Despite not being eligible for Group A racing in 1987, TWR ran their two Jaguars in the 1987 (January) Nissan Mobil 500 in Wellington, New Zealand under special invitation from the race promoters. Neither car finished with Walkinshaw/Percy suffering diff failure and the Hahne/Hulme car cutting a tyre resulting in a race ending crash after fighting their way into the lead. The cars then raced at Pukekohe, with Percy/Hahne giving the big cat a second-place finish in its final race behind the Perkins Engineering Holden Commodore VK of Australian drivers Larry Perkins and David Parsons.

TWR built a total of 7 cars.

===Non TWR===
Australian privateer Garry Willmington ran an XJS in the 1985 and 1986 Australian Touring Car Championships, and also the late season endurance races. While he reportedly had obtained more power from the V12 than TWR, Willmington didn&#x27;t have TWR&#x27;s resources to develop either the car or engine reliability and results were not forthcoming, though on occasions where the track had a long enough straight (such as Sandown Raceway in Melbourne or the Adelaide International Raceway), the Willmington Jag was usually the fastest car in a straight line. John Goss also ran his own privately entered XJS in the 1986 James Hardie 1000 after Jaguar-Rover Australia pulled its backing of the proposed TWR return to Bathurst due to a severe downturn in the Australian car market forced him to defend his crown alone, though he did receive some technical assistance from TWR. Electrical problems in the race saw Goss finish 24th with veteran Australian driver Bob Muir.

Today the XJS continues to be extensively campaigned in club level motorsport both in the United Kingdom and overseas. Best known of the race series is probably the Jaguar Enthusiasts&#x27; Club XJS championship, currently in association with Toyo Tires. Their championship has now been running for over a decade, offering an affordable entry into club motorsport in the UK, and continuing to attract large grids of this unlikely racing car. Cars compete in various states of modification, from barely modified road cars through to full race-specification cars built in homage to the great TWR specials.

<text>Karl von Prantl (aka Carl von Prantl) (28 January 1820 – 14 September 1888) (after 1872: Karl, Ritter von Prantl) was a German philosopher and philologist.

== Biography ==
He was born at Landsberg on the Lech. In 1843, he became doctor of philosophy at Munich Observatory, where he was made professor in 1859. He was also a member of the Academies of Berlin and Munich. Strongly in agreement with the Hegelian tradition, he defended and amplified it in &quot;Die gegenwärtige Aufgabe der Philosophie&quot; (1852) and &quot;Verstehen und Beurteilen&quot; (1877).

In these works, he emphasized the identity of the subjective and the objective for consciousness, and the fact that the perception of this unity is peculiar to man. He is more important, however, as a commentator and scholar, and made valuable contributions to the study of Aristotle. He published &quot;Aristoteles über die Farben&quot; (1849), &quot;Aristoteles acht Bücher der Physik&quot; (1857), and numerous minor articles on smaller points, such as the authenticity of the thirty-eight books of the &quot;Problems&quot;.

The work by which he is best known is &quot;Geschichte der Logik im Abendlande&quot; (4 volumes) (Leipzig: Verlag von S. Hirzel, 1855–1870) (&quot;History of Logic in the West&quot;). Christoph von Sigwart, in the preface to the first edition of his &quot;Logic&quot;, makes special mention of the assistance he obtained from this work.

Prantl died in Oberstdorf.

<doc id="885675" wikidata="Q4408628" url="?curid=885675" title="Patty Hill">
<text>Patty Smith Hill (March 27, 1868 – May 25, 1946) was an American composer and teacher who is perhaps best known for co-writing, with her sister Mildred Hill, the tune which later became popular as &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot;. She was an American nursery school, kindergarten teacher, and key founder of the National Association for Nursery Education (NANE) which now exists as the National Association For the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).

==Family and early life==
Patty Smith Hill was born in 1868 in Anchorage, Kentucky, just outside Louisville. Her parents were passionate people who instilled in Patty and her siblings the importance of education, the value of play, and the necessity of advocating for others. Her father, William Wallace Hill, was born in Bath, Kentucky, graduated from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky in 1833, and earned a doctorate of Theology from Princeton University in 1838. He dedicated his entire life to ministry and education, which took the Hill family from Kentucky to Missouri to Texas. Her mother, Martha Jane Smith, was William&#x27;s second wife (his first died in childbirth), and was born in Pennsylvania, but as an adolescent moved with her brother to live with their aunt and uncle on their plantation in Danville. Martha Jane was intent on learning and passing along education to others, evidenced, for example, by the fact that she taught the slaves on the Grimes plantation to read and write.

Hill&#x27;s parents were committed to their children&#x27;s education; her father is reported to have told his daughters to understand the value of a good education, and that it was, &quot;a tragedy for women to marry for a home. Don&#x27;t live with law kin! Don&#x27;t even if you have to live in a hollow tree!&quot; Empowered by her parents&#x27; encouragement, Patty graduated valedictorian of her class from the Louisville Collegiate Institute in 1887.

==Career in early childhood education==
Hill was an authority and leader in the progressive education movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Patty developed the Patty Hill blocks and in 1924 helped create the Institute of Child Welfare Research at Columbia University Teachers College. The Patty Hill blocks were large blocks with which children could create giant constructions. She was a member, President, and lifetime support of the Association for Childhood Education International.

==&quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot;==
Hill is perhaps best known as the sister of Mildred J. Hill, with whom she is credited as co-writing the tune to the song &quot;Good Morning to All&quot;. The tune became even more popular as &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; during the 20th century. Hill and her sister Mildred wrote the song (Mildred wrote the tune; Patty wrote the original lyrics) while Mildred was a composer of songs and Patty was principal at the Louisville Experimental Kindergarten School. This kindergarten was an early experiment in modern educational methods, and was honored, along with the Hill sisters, at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893.

==Later life and honors==
Patty Smith Hill, who never married, was awarded an honorary doctorate degree by Columbia University in 1929. Hill died at her home in New York City, and is buried in Cave Hill Cemetery, Louisville, Kentucky. She and Mildred J. Hill were posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 12, 1996.

<text>The Bentley Canal is an abandoned canal that was part of the Birmingham Canal Navigations. A very short section still exists where it joins the Wyrley and Essington Canal in Wolverhampton. From there it headed generally southeast through Willenhall and Walsall and connected with the Anson Branch and thus the Walsall Canal. The main line opened in 1843, with the Neachell Hall Branch following two years later. The branch closed in 1953 and the main line in the early 1960s.

==History==
In 1820, the Birmingham Canal Company had approached the Wyrley and Essington Canal, with a view to amalgamation. This had been declined, but from 1825 mineowners in the Walsall area petitioned for a junction between the two systems. Nothing happened for some years, but in 1837, Walsall Town Council began pushing both companies for a solution. After much disagreement, the Wyrley and Essington announced that they were ready to apply for an act of Parliament to authorise the construction of a junction at Walsall, which led to the Birmingham Canal Company agreeing to amalgamation. Both signed an agreement to proceed on 9 February 1840, and an act of Parliament, the Wyrley and Essington Canal Navigation Act 1840 (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. xxiv) was obtained to April to authorise the move. The Bentley Canal was one of three links between the systems built shortly afterwards. The other two were the Walsall Junction Canal, which linked the north end of the Walsall Canal to Birchills Junction, and the Rushall Canal, between the Tame Valley Canal and the Daw End Branch of the Wyrley and Essington.

In 1828, the company completed a branch to Ridgeacre at huge cost, and accepted an estimate for the Bentley Branch of £7,135, but they were in the middle of a much bigger enterprise, to lower the level of their main summit, and no further action appears to have been taken concerning the Bentley Branch. In 1839, work on the Tame Valley Canal began, under the direction of Messrs Walker and Burgess, who were the engineers. James Walker suggested that it should be built following a different line to that specified in the act of Parliament, and the committee approved his revised plans. When there was opposition to the new line from landowners, the committee agreed to revert to the original line, but Walker was infuriated, and wrote a long letter to them. They reconsidered, and agreed to proceed with Walker&#x27;s new line, for which they obtained a new act of Parliament. By August 1840, work on the Tame Valley Canal was progressing well, and Walker turned his attention to the Bentley Canal. He suggested that they dispense with the ten locks authorised by the act, and instead build two sections of level canal, one running from the Anson Branch at the Walsall level, continuing as far as was possible before higher ground prevented further progress, and another running from Wood Green to Portobello, on the same level. The committee again agreed with him.

Tenders were invited for the level canals, and prices received ranged from £11,300 to £27,691. The cheapest one was accepted, with four per cent of the cost going to Walker and Burgess. In June 1841, the committee approved plans to connect the Bentley Branch to the Wednesfield level through four locks, and then proceeding to the Wyrley and Essington Canal. The Wednesfield section was estimated to cost £6,850, and tenders for the whole thing ranged from £19,208 to £28,500. Of the thirteen tenders received, they opted for the cheapest. Effectively, this reinstated the parliamentary line, in place of Walker&#x27;s level canals. John Merry reported on progress in October 1842, noting that there were grooves for stop planks at every bridge, and they were all fitted with iron plates to prevent ropes wearing away the brickwork. Coping stones along the top of the locks were of Derbyshire stone, and the entrances to the locks had iron fenders to prevent damage to the brickwork. Each lock had a single paddle, operated by a windlass and rack.

Merry had suggested that the canal would be open by January 1843, but the opening was delayed until 28 April. Soon afterwards, Walker&#x27;s plan for the level Wood Green branch was dropped. The canal as built ran for through 10 locks. It fell into dereliction in the 1960s. The Neachells Branch was a short branch of which opened in 1845 to serve Neachell Hall Colliery and closed in 1953.

==Route==
The Bentley Canal left the Wyrley and Essington Canal at Wednesfield Junction. A cast iron bridge carried the towpath over the junction, and is still in situ. It dates from the mid-nineteenth century, and is a grade II listed structure. A short section of the canal remains in water, and is used for moorings for the Nickelodeon canalside pub. The first lock was located immediately to the east of the watered stub, and was followed by two more. The canal is heading east at this point, and the towpath was located on the south bank. The remains of old quarries were on both sides of the canal, and there was a metal works washing plant on the north bank in the 1950s. Bradburn&#x27;s Bridge carried a railway siding over the tail of the third lock. Beyond the bridge, Wolverhampton Metal Works occupied the south bank and there was a foundry on the north bank, although it had been a chocolate and confectionery works in 1902. The fourth lock was immediately before Well Lane Bridge. Between here and Neachells Bridge, there was a metal recovery works and allotment gardens on the north bank, and a cabinet works and two colour works to the south. This whole area has been redeveloped since the canal closed, although Well Lane and Neachells Lane still follow their original courses.

Two more locks occupied the next section, with Merrills Hall Bridge carrying Merrills Hall Lane over the canal just below the second. On the north bank were a steel works and a sports ground, which had been allotment gardens in 1938. A bowling green was nearest the canal, and a footbridge crossed it at this point. Reliance Works manufactured steel tubes on the south bank, and was sandwiched between the canal and a railway line. Beyond the bridge, Neachells Junction Bridge carried the towpath over the Neachells Branch. The branch headed due south. Another footbridge crossed it before it passed under a railway bridge. The settling tanks, filter beds and sludge beds of the Wednesfield Council sewage treatment works occupied the east bank of the branch beyond the bridge. A short arm to the east once served a coal mine, after which Water Lane crossed the canal. Beyond it, a wide basin served the Neachell Hall colliery, situated to the east of the canal, but disused by 1919.

Returning to the main line, the Weldless Steel Tube Works were located on the north bank, and a gas furnace plant was to the south. Hill&#x27;s Bridge carried a footpath over the canal. Fly Bridge, which was overshadowed by electricity pylons, carried another footpath. The Reliance Brass Foundry occupied the south bank just before Fibbersley Bridge, which now carries the B4484 road. Beyond it, the course of the canal is still clearly defined to the north of a housing estate. Dingle Bridge allowed walkers to cross from the end of Dingle Lane, while at Monmer Lane, there were two bridges, one to carry the road and a separate footbridge immediately to the west. An industrial estate occupied the south bank, as the canal turned towards the south east. After Spring Bank Bridge, there was a wharf and a short arm, with a towpath bridge over it, which served the Spring Vale iron foundry, which later became the Spring Vale stamping works.

Next the canal passes between the remains of Short Heath Brick Works on the north bank and Spring Bank Brick Works on the south. There were two locks, with a small arm and wharf to the north, between them. Sandbeds Bridge connected Charles Street and Stringers Lane, beyond which a third lock was located beneath a railway bridge. The fourth lock on this section was just before Clarke&#x27;s Lane Bridge, now carrying the A462 road. Farm Bridge joined the end of Durham Avenue. The canal turned to the south to pass under Wolverhampton Road West (now the B4464, formerly the A454) at County Bridge, and resumed its south-easterly course at Hopyard Bridge. A large cemetery occupies the north bank between the two bridges. Pendlebury Colliery occupied the south bank beyond the bridge, and had a small arm with a towpath bridge. The course of the canal is no longer visible from here, as its route is occupied by County Bridge Primary School. Beyond the school, Bentley Road North crossed at Bentley Lane Bridge, and the canal continued to join the Anson Branch just below Bentley Mill Bridge. The Anson Branch is no longer navigable, but is still partially watered.

<text>Christoph von Sigwart (; 28 March 1830 – 4 August 1904) was a German philosopher and logician. He was the son of philosopher Heinrich Christoph Wilhelm Sigwart (31 August 1789 – 16 November 1844).

==Life==
After a course of philosophy and theology, Sigwart became professor at the Blaubeuren (in 1859) and at Tübingen (in 1865).

==Philosophical work==
The first volume of Sigwart&#x27;s principal work, &quot;Logik&quot;, was published in 1873 and took an important place among contributions to logical theory in the late nineteenth century. In the preface to the first edition, Sigwart explains that he makes no attempt to appreciate the logical theories of his predecessors; he intended to construct a theory of logic, complete in itself.

The &quot;Logik&quot; represents the results of a long and careful study not only of German but also of English logicians. In 1895 an English translation by Helen Dendy was published in London. Chapter 5 of the second volume is especially interesting to English thinkers as it contains a profound examination of the induction theories of Francis Bacon, John Stuart Mill and David Hume. His &quot;Kleine Schriften&quot; contains valuable criticisms on Paracelsus and Giordano Bruno.

<text>Sergeant Joseph M. Darby (born c. 1979) is a former U.S. Army Reservist known as the whistleblower in the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal. Darby is a graduate of North Star High School, near his hometown at the time, Jenners, Pennsylvania.

At the time, Darby served as an M.P. at the Abu Ghraib prison, in Abu Ghraib, Iraq. After learning of the abuse, Darby was the first person to take steps to alert the U.S. military command.

==Disclosure of abuses at Abu Ghraib==

In January 2004, Darby provided two CD-ROMs of photographs to Special Agent Tyler Pieron of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, who was stationed at Abu Ghraib Prison, triggering an investigation that led to the implication of several soldiers violating the Geneva Convention. Darby initially wanted to remain anonymous, and had been assured of anonymity — he and those implicated all served in the 372nd Military Police Company, but became known when &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published his name and when later Donald Rumsfeld named him during a Senate hearing. This led to harassment and death threats against him and his family, resulting in them being taken into protective custody by the U.S. Army. Darby had agonized for a month beforehand, but finally decided to blow the whistle on his former friends explaining: &quot;It violated everything I personally believed in and all I&#x27;d been taught about the rules of war.&quot; He had known Lynndie England, one of the most well-known suspects, since Basic Training. He testified that he had received the photos from Charles Graner, another soldier in the photographs.

===Reactions===
The disclosure was not received well by the community in which Darby and his wife, Bernadette, were living in Maryland. They have been shunned by friends and neighbors, their property has been vandalized, and they now reside in protective military custody at an undisclosed location. Bernadette said, &quot;We did not receive the response I thought we would. People were, they were mean, saying he was a walking dead man, he was walking around with a bull&#x27;s-eye on his head. It was scary.&quot;

On the other hand, CBS reports that former neighbors from one of his childhood homes in Pennsylvania were proud of him. Darby has also said that soldiers in his unit shook his hand afterward.

===Recognition===
On May 7, 2004, Darby was profiled as the &quot;Person of the Week&quot; by anchor Peter Jennings on &quot;ABC&#x27;s World News Tonight&quot;, and in December 2004, he was selected as one of three ABC News &quot;People of the Year&quot;. He was profiled and interviewed by Anderson Cooper on the December 10, 2006, broadcast of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; (the segment was aired again on June 24, 2007).

Darby received a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award on May 16, 2005, in recognition of his courage in exposing the abuses at Abu Ghraib.

Darby also received a personal letter from Donald Rumsfeld, asking him to stop talking about how his identity had been disclosed by Rumsfeld despite receiving assurances of anonymity from military command.

<doc id="885721" wikidata="Q1262455" url="?curid=885721" title="Synod of Elvira">
<text>The Synod of Elvira (, ) was an ecclesiastical synod held at Elvira in the Roman province of Hispania Baetica, now Granada in southern Spain. Its date has not been exactly determined but is believed to be in the first quarter of the fourth century, approximately 305–6. It was one of three councils, together with the Synod of Arles (314) and the Synod of Ancyra, that first approached the character of general councils and prepared the way for the first ecumenical council. It was attended by nineteen bishops and twenty-six presbyters, mostly resident in Baetica. Deacons and laymen were also present. Eighty-one canons are recorded, although it is believed that many were added at later dates. All concern order, discipline and conduct among the Christian community. Canon 36, forbidding the use of images in churches, became a bone of contention between Catholic and Protestant scholars after the Protestant Reformation.

It is one of a number of pre-ecumenical ancient church councils and synods. The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia refers to this as a &quot;council,&quot; conveying a wider scope than a synod. The Vatican refers to it using both terms.

==Place and purpose==
The place of meeting, Eliberri, rendered as Elvira, was not far from the modern Granada, if not, as A.W. Dale and Edgar Hennecke think, actually identical with it. There the nineteen bishops and twenty-four presbyters, mostly from Hispania Baetica and Carthago Nova, assembled, probably at the instigation of Hosius of Córdoba, but under the presidency of Felix of Accitum (Guadix) in Baetica, probably by virtue of his being the oldest bishop present, with a view to restoring order and discipline in the church. The canons which were adopted reflect with considerable fullness the internal life and external relations of the Spanish Church of the 4th century. The reputation of this council drew to its canons further canons that came to be associated with the Synod of Elvira.

Victor De Clercq notes &quot;that except for Hosius of Córdoba, we know practically nothing about these men, nor do we know with certainty when and why the council was held, and that the church of Spain is one of the least known in pre-constantinian [sic] times&quot;.

==The canons==
Maurice Meigne considers that only the first twenty-one canons in the list that has been transmitted were promulgated at Elvira; the remainder having been added to the collection.

The social environment of Christians in Hispania may be inferred from the canons prohibiting marriage and other intercourse with Jews, pagans and heretics, closing the offices of flamen and duumvir to Christians, forbidding all contact with idolatry and likewise participation in pagan festivals and public games. The state of morals is mirrored in the canons denouncing prevalent vices. The canons respecting the clergy exhibit the clergy as already a special class with particular privileges, as acting under a more exacting moral standard, with heavier penalties for delinquency. The bishop has acquired control of the sacraments, presbyters and deacons acting only under his orders; the episcopate appears as a unit, bishops being bound to respect one another&#x27;s disciplinary decrees.

The canons are almost entirely concerned with the conduct of various elements of the Christian community, and have no theological content as such. Sanctions include long delays before baptism, exclusion from the Eucharist for periods of months or years, or indefinitely, sometimes with an exception for the death-bed, though this is also specifically excluded in some cases. Periods of penance, often for sexual offences, extend to 5 or 10 years: &quot;Canon 5. If a woman beats her servant and causes death within three days, she shall undergo seven years&#x27; penance if the injury was inflicted on purpose and five years&#x27; if it was accidental. She shall not receive communion during this penance unless she becomes ill. If so, she may receive communion.&quot;

All the canons which pertain to Jews served to maintain a separation between the two communities. Canon 15 prohibited marriage with pagans, while Canon 16 prohibited marriage of Christians with Jews. Canon 78 threatens Christians who commit adultery with Jews with ostracism. Canon 49 forbade the blessing of Christian crops by Jews, and Canon 50 forbade the sharing of meals by Christians and Jews.

Among the early canons (which are possibly the only original ones), Canon 1 forbade giving holy communion to lapsed Christians even &quot;in articulo mortis&quot;, an unusually severe application of Novatianist principles, which had divided the church since the recovery from mid 3rd-century persecutions: compare the severity of Cyprian of Carthage. The subject of this leading canon is a major indication for a date following recent persecution.

Among the later canons, of especial note are Canon 33, enjoining celibacy upon all clerics, married or not, and all who minister at the altar (the most ancient canon of clerical celibacy). Also relating to the subject of clerical celibacy is Canon 27, which calls for bishops and other clergy to refrain from living with women unless they are of relation. This canon is believed to be condemning the practice of Syneisaktism, or spiritual marriage, which was growing more and more popular among ascetic men and women.

Canon 36 states, &quot;It has seemed good that images should not be in churches so that what is venerated and worshiped not be painted on the walls.&quot; It allegedly forbids pictures in churches (compare the Iconoclastic Controversy in the East); according to Philip Schaff this canon &quot;has often been quoted by Protestants as an argument against image worship as idolatrous; while Roman Catholic writers explain it either as a prohibition of representations of the deity only, or as a prudential measure against heathen desecration of holy things&quot;. Canon 36 was the first official statement on art by the Christian Church and so of special interest in the history of Early Christian and medieval art, even if it represents Church policy only within the limits of the synod&#x27;s jurisdiction of Spain.

Canon 38, permits lay baptism under certain conditions, and Canon 53, forbids one bishop restoring a person excommunicated by another.

Other provisions relating to images forbade Christian slave-owners from allowing their pagan slaves to keep their personal idols, or &quot;if this is impossible to enforce, they must at least avoid the idols and remain pure. If this does not happen, they are alienated from the church&quot; (Canon 41). Canon 60 says &quot;If someone smashes an idol and is then punished by death, he or she may not be placed in the list of martyrs, since such action is not sanctioned by the Scriptures or by the apostles.&quot; Canon 34 says &quot;Candles are not to be burned in a cemetery during the day. This practice is related to paganism and is harmful to Christians. Those who do this are to be denied the communion of the church&quot;. Other canons imposed &quot;the rigorous form of fasting&quot; every Saturday (Canon 26), forbade the baptism of chariot racers or stage performers (Canon 62), and many tightly control the reception of former pagan priests into the Christian church and clergy (Canons, 2,3,4,55).

Several canons relate only to the behaviour of women, such as Canon 67: &quot;A woman who is baptized or is a catechumen must not associate with hairdressers or men with long hair...&quot; Canon 81 reads: &quot;A woman may not write to other lay Christians without her husband&#x27;s consent. A woman may not receive letters of friendship addressed to her only and not to her husband as well.&quot; However married former prostitutes are not to suffer delays in baptism on that account (Canon 44).

==Date of the synod==
The solution of the question of the date hinges upon the interpretation of the canons, that is, upon whether they are to be taken as reflecting a recent persecution, or as redacted in a time of peace, that is either after or before the persecution under Diocletian. Thus the earliest investigators, Louis Duchesne and Victor De Clercq, argue for a date between 300 and 303, i.e. before the persecution under Diocletian; others for a date between 303 and 314, after the persecution, but before the Synod of Arles (314); a few others argue for a date between the synod of Arles and the Council of Nicaea, (325). Karl Josef von Hefele and Robert William Dale follow early compilers of the canons Giovanni Domenico Mansi and Jean Hardouin in agreement upon 305 or 306, while Hennecke concludes that &quot;the whole attitude points to a time of peace, not to one immediately following a persecution; the complete absence of any provisions as to the case of the lapsed is enough to preclude the modern theory as to the date&quot;.

==Documentation==
The scanty documentation of the Synod of Elvira was first assembled by Ferdinand de Mendoza, &quot;De confirmando Concilio IIIiberitano ad Clementem VIII&quot;, 1593.

The canons are available online in English and in Latin (with dictionary lookup links)

<text>Khalid Skah () (born 29 January 1967) is a Moroccan track and field athlete, winner of the 10,000 metres at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

Born in Midelt, Morocco, Skah established himself first as a good cross country runner by winning the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in 1990 and 1991.

==Racing career==
===1991 World Championships===
His first major tournament on track was the 1991 World Championships where he first won a bronze in 10,000 m and then finished sixth at the 5000 m run. This was a disappointing outcome for Skah as, earlier in the season, he had won the 10000 m race in Oslo against a very strong field and had emerged as one of the favourites for the finals in Tokyo. However, for the 10 000 m final Richard Chelimo and the eventual world champion, Moses Tanui (both of Kenya), employed some very elaborate tactics and worked as a team. By the time of the 5000 m final Skah was probably tired. Yobes Ondieki of Kenya, who won the gold medal in the 5000 m, had expected Skah to be his major rival.

===1992 Olympics===
The following year, at the Barcelona Olympics, Skah met Chelimo again. With three laps remaining in the 10,000 m final, the two athletes were clear and battling for the gold medal. At this point the pair came to lap another Moroccan athlete, Hammou Boutayeb, who stayed with the leaders even after being lapped. The rules state that a lapped runner cannot &quot;assist&quot; another runner but, although Boutayeb&#x27;s actions were interpreted as unsportsmanlike by the crowd, it was not certain that there was collusion. Nevertheless Skah gained advantage, Chelimo was disadvantaged. These events incensed the Spanish crowd, and the Swedish track judge Carl-Gustav Tollemar attempted to stop Boutayeb.

Skah sprinted ahead of Chelimo in the final 150 m to claim victory, but was immediately disqualified, prompting cheers from the crowd. For about 14 hours, Chelimo was the Olympic champion. However, the Moroccan team appealed, and by the next morning, Skah was reinstated. The jury of appeal ruled that rule 143.2, which prohibited assistance, lacked a defined penalty, which rendered it effectively unenforceable. At the medal ceremony, Skah was met with boos, while the crowd reserved their applause for Chelimo.

===Other races===
In 1993 Skah won the 5000 m race at Weltklasse Zürich. However, he finished fifth in 5000 m at the 1993 World Championships. He ran his only world record in 2 miles (8:12.17) in the same season. He won the 1994 World Semi-Marathon Championships and finished second in 10,000 m at the 1995 World Championships.

Skah&#x27;s last major international meet was the 1996 Summer Olympics, where he finished seventh in the 10 000 m. In 1995, Skah was given Norwegian citizenship, where he lived and trained with athletes club B.U.L. After that, the Moroccan Athletics Association banned him from international competitions. Skah was reinstated in 2001, after which he tried a comeback to re-establish himself as one of the world&#x27;s best long distance runners, finishing tenth in the World Half Marathon Championships that year.

== Personal life ==
In June 2013, Skah was arrested at Orly Airport in Paris following an extradition request from Norway, where he was sought for alleged child abduction. Skah had been engaged in a long-running custody dispute with his Norwegian ex-wife, Anne Cecilie Hopstock, over their two children, Tarik and Selma. The case escalated into a diplomatic controversy after Norway admitted to assisting the children in leaving Morocco. In 2009, the teenagers reportedly fled their father’s home, seeking help from the Norwegian embassy in Rabat. They were sheltered at the ambassador’s residence before being smuggled out of the country on a yacht to Spain. While Norway confirmed that one of its diplomats had hidden the children, it denied official involvement in their escape, stating that two special forces members who aided them were off duty at the time. Morocco accused Norwegian officials of violating the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and called for legal action. Meanwhile, both Skah and Hopstock had been granted custody in their respective countries, though by 2013, the children were legal adults.
