<text>A coachman is an employee who drives a coach or carriage, a horse-drawn vehicle designed for the conveyance of passengers. A coachman has also been called a coachee, coachy, whip, or hackman.

The coachman&#x27;s first concern is to remain in full control of the horses (or other similar animals such as mules) and another employee, traditionally a footman, would accompany the coach to handle any circumstances beyond the coachman&#x27;s control.
==Duties==
&quot;Coachman&quot; is correctly applied to the driver of any type of coach or carriage having an independent seat for the driver. If it is a public transport vehicle the owners might arrange things differently and a coachman may do no more than drive the vehicle. A private coachman reports directly to his employer or the employer&#x27;s agent or factor and, being in command of the stables, the most important building after the house, is responsible for caring for and providing all the master&#x27;s horses and carriages and related employees. Where necessary the coachman may delegate the driving of household vehicles but it is a primary duty to personally drive the employer. In a great house, this would have been a specialty, but in more modest households, the &quot;coachman&quot; would have doubled as the stablehand or groom. Even a head chauffeur with under-chauffeurs and mechanics held a much lesser position needing such a small staff and little capital.

In early coaches he sat on a built-in compartment called a &quot;boot&quot;, bracing his feet on a footrest called a &quot;footboard&quot;. He was often pictured wearing a &quot;box coat&quot; or &quot;box jacket&quot;, a heavy overcoat with or without shoulder capes, double-breasted, with fitted waist and wide lapels; its name derives from its use by coachmen riding on the box seat, exposed to all kinds of weather. An ornamented, often fringed cloth called a &quot;hammercloth&quot; might have hung over the coachman&#x27;s seat, especially of a ceremonial coach. He could be seen taking refreshments at a type of public house called a &quot;watering house&quot;, which also provided water for horses.

The role of the coachman, who sat on the vehicle, was contrasted with that of the postillion mounted directly on one of the drawing horses. On the grandest ceremonial occasions the coachman might escort a number of his postillions with his own horse.

===Bynames===
A coachman was sometimes called a &quot;&quot; or &quot;jarvie&quot;, especially in Ireland; Jarvey was a nickname for Jarvis. In the first of his Sherlock Holmes stories, &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, Arthur Conan Doyle refers to the driver of a small cab in London as a jarvey. A coachman who drove dangerously fast or recklessly might invoke biblical or mythological allusions: Some referred to him as a jehu, recalling King Jehu of Israel, who was noted for his furious attacks in a chariot (2 Kings 9:20) before he died about 816 BC. Others dubbed him a Phaeton, harking back to the Greek Phaëton, son of Helios who, attempting to drive the chariot of the sun, managed to set the earth on fire.

The driver of a wagon or cart drawn by a draught animal was known as teamster or carter.

==Hungarian folklore==
The English word &quot;coach&quot;, the Spanish and Portuguese &quot;coche&quot;, the German &quot;Kutsche&quot;, the Slovak &quot;koč&quot; and the Czech &quot;kočár&quot; all probably derive from the Hungarian word &quot;kocsi&quot;, literally meaning &quot;of Kocs&quot;. Kocs (pronounced &quot;kotch&quot;) was a Hungarian post town, and the coach itself may have been developed in Hungary. Hungarian villages still hold Coachman of the Year competitions (similar to those held in Zakopane in Poland).

The coachman soon became a prominent figure in Hungarian folklore. As the Clever Coachman (tudós kocsis), he turns up unexpectedly in the hero&#x27;s life, either knowing his name or naming him by his true name. Many of Steven Brust&#x27;s novels play with this image of the coachman.
==Other uses==
Coachman is also a synonym for the pennant coralfish (&quot;Heniochus Monoceros&quot;). The Royal Coachman is also a type of fly used for fly fishing, which exists as both a dry-fly and a wet-fly. The pattern was composed in England pre-1860.

<doc id="874245" wikidata="Q7147224" url="?curid=874245" title="Patrick Miller of Dalswinton">
<text>Patrick Miller of Dalswinton (1731–1815) was a Scottish banker and inventor who served as Deputy Governor of the Bank of Scotland. He engineered the ship &quot;Experiment of Leith&quot; for the Swedish Navy, and was involved in a boat project with William Symington which later led to the paddle steamer &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot;.

==Early life==
Miller was born in Glasgow, the third son of William Miller of Glenlee, and his wife, Janet Hamilton. After attending the University of Glasgow, he decided to take up banking as his trade, since the Scottish economy was growing.

== Career ==
By November 1760, Miller became partners with William Ramsay of Barnton, merchants and bankers, in Edinburgh. In 1767, he was elected to the court of the Bank of Scotland where he implemented a number of reforms, particularly the introduction of note exchange, whereby the bank agreed to accept notes of its competitors. Thanks to his improvements, the bank successfully endured a banking crisis in 1772. Miller was a shareholder in the Carron Company.

In his final years, he served as Deputy Governor of the Bank of Scotland; he was succeeded by Adam Rolland of Gask FRSE upon his death.

==Invention and naval pursuits==

While looking after shipping interests overseas, Miller experienced firsthand the dangers of piracy on his ocean voyages. These brushes with privateers combined with his time on the ocean sparked a lifelong interest in ordnance and naval architecture.

===Warship===
He attempted to interest various European navies in his design for a super warship, but only Sweden showed any notable interest; their great naval architect Chapman called it the &quot;English (sic) sea-spook&quot;. The Swedish king Gustav III, as thanks for the actual vessel, Experiment of Leith, that Miller sent him, despatched Miller seeds of the swede in a magnificent snuff-box, featuring marine illustrations, now in the collection of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London.

===Pleasure boats===
Miller was particularly interested in multiple-hulled pleasure boats propelled by cranked paddle wheels placed between the hulls. On seeing a steam-carriage model made by the engineer William Symington (or on the suggestion of Symington&#x27;s friend James Taylor), he got Symington to build his patented steam engine with its drive into a twin-hulled pleasure boat. This was successfully tried out on Dalswinton Loch near Miller&#x27;s house on 14 October 1788. The next year a larger engine was fitted to a long twin-hull paddle boat and tried on the Forth and Clyde Canal. After initial problems of paddle wheels breaking up on 2 December, the vessel travelled some distance along the canal on 26 December and 27 December 1789. Miller abandoned the project due to the rising expenses of the venture.

===Charlotte Dundas===
Ten years later, Lord Dundas restarted Symington&#x27;s work on a steamboat, leading to the famous paddle steamer, &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot;.

== Death ==
Miller died in 1815, and is buried in a tomb against the southern wall of Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh.

<doc id="874246" wikidata="Q5524672" url="?curid=874246" title="Gary Bauer">
<text>Gary Lee Bauer (born May 4, 1946) is an American civil servant, activist, and former political candidate. He served in President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration as Under Secretary of Education and Chief Domestic Policy Advisor, and later became president of the Family Research Council and a senior vice president of Focus on the Family, both conservative Christian organizations. Bauer was a candidate in the 2000 Republican Party presidential primaries and participated in five national debates. He is known for his advocacy of religious liberty, support for Israel, and his dedication to electing conservative candidates to Congress.

Currently, Bauer is president of the advocacy organization American Values. In May 2018, President Donald Trump appointed him to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.

==Background==

Gary Bauer was born in Covington, Kentucky, and was reared in Newport, Kentucky, in a working-class family, the son of Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; (Gossett) and Stanley Rynolds Bauer, a laborer. He was reared in the Southern Baptist faith. Of his hometown, Bauer has said, &quot;in the years I grew up there, the town was literally under the control of an organized crime syndicate out of Toledo, Ohio. And when I say under the control of it, literally the mayor, the city council, even the police department were all being paid handsomely.&quot; Bauer cited the community&#x27;s efforts to oppose this corruption as a significant influence on his political conservatism.

Bauer received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky, in 1968 and a J.D. degree from Georgetown University in 1973. While attending law school, he worked as the assistant director of Opposition Research at the Republican National Committee from 1969 to 1973. He then took a position as the director of government relations for the Direct Mail Marketing Association, from 1973 to 1980. He served as a Deputy Under Secretary for Planning and Budget in the United States Department of Education, from 1982 to 1987, and as an advisor on domestic policy from 1987 to 1988. While serving under Reagan, he was named Chairman of President Reagan&#x27;s Special Working Group on the Family. His report, &quot;The Family: Preserving America&#x27;s Future,&quot; was presented to the President in December 1986.

Bauer served as the president of the Family Research Council from 1988 to 1999. He resigned from this position to run for the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States. He left the race after the primaries in February 2000. In 1996, he founded the Campaign for Working Families (CWF), a political action committee dedicated to electing &quot;pro-family, pro-life and pro-free enterprise&quot; candidates to federal and state offices. In addition to serving as the chairman of CWF, Bauer is also the president of American Values, a non-profit organization &quot;committed to defending life, traditional marriage, and equipping our children with&quot; conservative values. He also serves on the executive board of Christians United for Israel, a lobby group headed by John Hagee. Gary Bauer was one of the signers of the Statement of Principles of Project for the New American Century (PNAC) on June 3, 1997. He also serves on the board of the Emergency Committee for Israel.

Bauer currently serves as the president of American Values (conservative values advocacy organization).
At the end of May 2018, Bauer was appointed by President Trump to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.

Bauer is married to the former Carol Hoke, and lives in Virginia. Gary and Carol have three adult children.

==Political positions==
Bauer has been described as a &quot;politically conservative Baptist with strong commitments to preserving the traditional family and the Judeo-Christian values he believes are the foundation of American society.&quot; Bauer is anti-abortion. He is in support of repealing laws that allow abortion. He advocates for the Supreme Court&#x27;s overturn of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; as the first step in the anti-abortion cause. He wants to cut funding for Planned Parenthood and do away with any U.S. aid for organizations that provide or advise abortions. Bauer also says that he would counsel raped family members against abortion. He points to the Constitution and the Christian view of human life as reasons for not supporting euthanasia, stating that, &quot;all people have immeasurable value because they have been created in the image and likeness of God.&quot; He is a supporter of the death penalty for death row inmates. Bauer opposes cloning and embryonic stem cell research, but supports adult stem cell research. He supports a Constitutional
amendment to ban same-sex marriage, and prefers abstinence programs to comprehensive sex education programs. Bauer wants to remove from the tax code all economic disincentives to marry.

On foreign policy issues, Bauer supports strong ties with Israel, would not trade with China until the country improves its human rights record, and supported full funding for the Iraq War. Bauer believes that America should advance and protect freedom worldwide and &quot;bring the message of freedom to the Arab world&quot;. He is a critic of Islam.

Bauer supports enforcing all laws against illegal immigration and that all immigrants should learn English and U.S. traditions.

On economic issues, Bauer supports income tax cuts and decreased regulation of small businesses. He thinks that government should not set a minimum wage. He has stated that corporations should serve the U.S. as well as their shareholders, and has occasionally been critical of the World Trade Organization.

==Presidential campaign==
Bauer announced his presidential campaign in April 1999, running on a platform built mostly upon social issues such as abortion. Bauer received over 8% of the vote in the Iowa Republican caucuses, and less than 1% of the vote in the New Hampshire Republican primary before withdrawing from the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Bauer endorsed John McCain when he pulled out of the race in February 2000. In the fall of 1999, two senior members of Bauer&#x27;s campaign staff raised questions about closed-door meetings between Bauer and a female campaign aide. Bauer&#x27;s denial of any impropriety prompted two campaign workers to resign. There was never any actual evidence of infidelity brought against Bauer.

His presidential campaign is mostly remembered for an incident at the Bisquick Pancake Presidential Primary Flip-Off on 31 January 2000. The candidates each took a turn to mount a four-foot stage, make, flip and catch a pancake in a pan. When Bauer took his turn, he tossed his pancake too high and, trying to follow it, fell off the back of the stage, disappearing through a blue curtain. He emerged, unhurt, with no pancake and no pan. He then flipped and caught a pancake without falling on his second attempt. Bauer joked that it might be the best thing to happen to his campaign and said that he was &quot;the Ken Griffey of the presidential candidates. I dove into the dugout to catch my pancake.&quot; Years later, Bauer recalled that as he toppled off the stage and through the curtain, fellow candidate George W. Bush, who was standing backstage having already successfully completed his pancake toss, shouted &quot;here comes Bauer!&quot;

==Media activities==

Bauer co-hosted a talk radio show with former &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; CEO and President Tom Rose from March 2006 to March 2007 on WMET, a Washington, D.C. metropolitan area radio station. Bauer is also a frequent guest on many conservative talk-radio programs across the country. Gary and Tom were co-hosts on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 Bauer and Rose Show for 9 years and their popular show ended April 9, 2017 with Tom Rose taking a position in the White House as assistant and adviser to Vice President Pence.

==&quot;Manhattan Declaration&quot;==

In November 2009, Bauer signed an ecumenical statement known as the &quot;Manhattan Declaration&quot; calling on evangelical, Catholic and Orthodox Christians not to comply with rules and laws which they claim would compel participation in or blessing of abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences.

Bauer is the author of several books, including:

<doc id="874247" wikidata="Q2038676" url="?curid=874247" title="Stratum corneum">
<text>The stratum corneum (Latin for &#x27;horned layer&#x27;) is the outermost layer of the epidermis. Consisting of dead tissue, it protects underlying tissue from infection, dehydration, chemicals and mechanical stress. It is composed of 15–20 layers of flattened cells with no nuclei and cell organelles. 

Among its properties are mechanical shear, impact resistance, water flux and hydration regulation, microbial proliferation and invasion regulation, initiation of inflammation through cytokine activation and dendritic cell activity, and selective permeability to exclude toxins, irritants, and allergens. The cytoplasm of its cells shows filamentous keratin. These corneocytes are embedded in a lipid matrix composed of ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids.

Desquamation is the process of cell shedding from the surface of the stratum corneum, balancing proliferating keratinocytes that form in the stratum basale. These cells migrate through the epidermis towards the surface in a journey that takes approximately fourteen days.

== Structure ==
The human stratum corneum comprises several levels of flattened corneocytes that are divided into two layers: the &quot;stratum disjunctum&quot; and &quot;stratum compactum&quot;. The skin&#x27;s protective acid mantle and lipid barrier sit on top of the stratum disjunctum. The stratum disjunctum is the uppermost and loosest layer of skin. The stratum compactum is the comparatively deeper, more compacted and more cohesive part of the stratum corneum. The corneocytes of the stratum disjunctum are larger, more rigid and more hydrophobic than those of the stratum compactum. 

Research on osmotic permeability suggests the stratum compactum consists of two layers. The stratum disjunctum above these layers can swell, as can the lowest layer of the stratum disjunctum (two-fold). However, the first layer in the stratum compactum between them has limited swelling capacity and provides the stratum corneum&#x27;s barrier. 

==Function==
During cornification, the process whereby living keratinocytes are transformed into non-living corneocytes, the cell membrane is replaced by a layer of ceramides which become covalently linked to an envelope of structural proteins (the cornified envelope). This complex surrounds cells in the &quot;stratum corneum&quot; and contributes to the skin&#x27;s barrier function. Corneodesmosomes (modified desmosomes) facilitate cellular adhesion by linking adjacent cells within this epidermal layer. These complexes are degraded by proteases, eventually permitting cells to be shed at the surface. Desquamation and formation of the cornified envelope are both required for the maintenance of skin homeostasis. A failure to correctly regulate these processes leads to skin disorders developing.

Cells of the stratum corneum contain a dense network of keratin, a protein that helps keep the skin hydrated by preventing water evaporation. These cells can also absorb water, further aiding in hydration. In addition, this layer is responsible for the &quot;spring back&quot; or stretchy properties of skin. A weak glutenous protein bond pulls the skin back to its natural shape.

The thickness of the stratum corneum varies throughout the body. In the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet (sometimes knees, elbows, knuckles,) this layer is stabilized and built by the &quot;stratum lucidum&quot; (clear phase) which allows the cells to concentrate keratin and toughen them before they rise into a typically thicker, more cohesive stratum corneum. The mechanical stress of heavy structural strain causes this stratum lucidum phase in these regions which require additional protection in order to grasp objects, resist abrasion or impact, and avoid injury. In general, the stratum corneum contains 15 to 20 layers of corneocytes. The stratum corneum has a thickness between 10 and 40 μm.

In reptiles, the stratum corneum is permanent, and is replaced only during times of rapid growth, in a process called ecdysis or moulting. This is conferred by the presence of beta-keratin, which provides a much more rigid skin layer.

In the human forearm, about 1300 cells per cm2 per hour are shed. Stratum corneum protects the internal structures of the body from external injury and bacterial invasion.

== Skin disease ==
An inability to correctly maintain the skin barrier function due to the dysregulation of epidermal components can lead to skin disorders. For example, a failure to modulate the activity of kallikreins via the disruption of the protease inhibitor LEKTI causes the debilitating disorder Netherton syndrome.
Hyperkeratosis is an increased thickness of the stratum corneum, and is an unspecific finding, seen in many skin conditions.

<text>Anaxilaus or Anaxilas of [[Larissa]] (; century BC) was a physician and Pythagorean philosopher. According to Eusebius, he was banished from Rome in 28 BC by Augustus on the charge of practicing magic. Anaxilaus wrote about the &quot;magical&quot; properties of minerals, herbs, and other substances and derived drugs, and is cited by Pliny in this regard. His exceptional knowledge of natural science allowed him to produce tricks that were mistaken for magic.

<doc id="874251" wikidata="Q256584" url="?curid=874251" title="Masanobu Tsuji">
<text>was a Japanese army officer and politician. During World War II, he was an important tactical planner in the Imperial Japanese Army and developed the detailed plans for the successful Japanese invasion of Malaya at the start of the war. He also helped plan and lead the final Japanese offensive during the Guadalcanal campaign.

A Pan-Asianist, Tsuji pressured Asian countries to support Japan in World War II, despite being involved in atrocities such as the Bataan Death March and Sook Ching. He meticulously planned the mass murders in Singapore and surrounding regions. He personally oversaw the Pantingan River massacre. He evaded prosecution for Japanese war crimes at the end of the war and hid in Thailand. He returned to Japan in 1949 and was elected to the Diet as an advocate of renewed militarism. Through the 50&#x27;s he worked for American intelligence alongside Takushiro Hattori. In 1961, he disappeared on a trip to Laos.

Tsuji was among the most aggressive and influential Japanese militarists. He was a leading proponent of the concept of &quot;gekokujō&quot;, (literally &quot;the bottom overthrowing the top&quot;) by acting without or contrary to authorization. He incited the 1939 border clash with the Soviet Union and was a vehement advocate of war against the United States.

==Early life and career==
Masanobu Tsuji was born in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. He received his secondary education at a military academy and later graduated from the War College.

By 1934, he was active in the Army&#x27;s political intrigues as a member of the &quot;Tōseiha&quot;
(&quot;Control Faction&quot;) and helped block the attempted coup d&#x27;état of the rival &quot;Kōdōha&quot; (&quot;Imperial Way Faction&quot;). That brought him the patronage of General and future Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and General and future War Minister Seishirō Itagaki.

==Atrocities and war crimes==
From 1938 to 1939, Tsuji was a staff officer in the Kwantung Army in Japanese-occupied Mongolia. In March 1939, after the Japanese defeat at the hands of the Soviets at Changkufeng, Tsuji instigated an aggressive border policy, which triggered the Nomonhan Incident. 

When the war against America and Britain started, Tsuji was on the staff of General Tomoyuki Yamashita, whose army invaded Malaya. He was largely responsible for planning Yamashita&#x27;s successful landing in Malaya and subsequent campaign against Singapore. After the capture of Singapore, Tsuji helped plan the &quot;Sook Ching&quot;, a systematic massacre of thousands of Malayan Chinese who might be hostile to Japan. 

He was then transferred to the staff of General Homma in the Philippines. After the US surrendered there, Tsuji sought to have all American prisoners killed and encouraged the brutal mistreatment and casual murder of prisoners in the Bataan Death March. He also had many captured officials of the Philippines government executed, including by ordering the execution of Filipino Chief Justice José Abad Santos and the attempted execution of former Speaker of the House of Representatives Manuel Roxas.

After the war, Japanese war criminals were prosecuted for the Bataan Death March, Sook Ching and other atrocities, but Tsuji fled and avoided trial. Some other army officials, who had followed Tsuji&#x27;s command, were charged, and two of them were executed. 

Homma countermanded many of execution orders that had been pushed through by the Tsuji clique, including the execution orders for future Philippine president Manuel Roxas who was the former speaker of the house of representatives at that time. Homma saw these execution orders as a dishonorable violation of bushido ethics. However, Douglas MacArthur held him responsible for the actions of his subordinates and he was executed while Tsuji was on the run.

==World War II==

In 1932, Tsuji saw action in China, and subsequently travelled as far as Sinkiang.
He served as a staff officer in the Kwantung Army in 1937–1939. His aggressive and insubordinate attitude exacerbated the Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, and helped incite the Battle of Khalkhin Gol in 1939.

After the defeat at Khalkhin Gol, Tsuji opposed any further conflicts with the Soviet Union. After their attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, the Germans urged the Japanese to join the invasion, and many in the Japanese military wanted to avenge the defeat at Khalkhin Gol. However, Tsuji was an influential advocate of the attack on the United States. General Ryukichi Tanaka testified after the war that &quot;the most determined single protagonist in favor of war with the United States was Tsuji Masanobu.&quot; Tsuji later wrote that his experience of Soviet firepower at Khalkhin Gol convinced him not to attack the Soviet Union in 1941.

His protectors in the Army got him safely transferred to Taiwan, where he helped organize the Army&#x27;s jungle warfare school. He was then assigned to the Operations Section of the General Staff, where he became a strong advocate of war with the United States and Britain. It has been alleged that in late 1941, he planned the assassination of Prime Minister Konoe if Konoe achieved peace with the United States.

Tsuji planned the Japanese overland attack in New Guinea, via the Kokoda Trail. In that as in other operations, he ordered bold offensive moves, regardless of difficulties or the costs to the troops involved.

In late 1942, Tsuji went to Guadalcanal, where he planned and led the last major Japanese attack on October 23–24. After the attacks were defeated, Tsuji went to Tokyo in person to urge additional reinforcements. However, he then accepted the Navy&#x27;s conclusion that nothing could get through and recommended the evacuation of the remaining troops. He impressed the Emperor with his frankness.

However, the Guadalcanal fiasco had discredited him. He was sent to the Japanese HQ in Nanking, which was largely inactive, for the next year. While there, he made contacts with various Chinese, including both collaborators and agents of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s government.

In mid-1944, Tsuji was sent to Burma, where Japanese forces had been repulsed at Imphal. Tsuji was assigned to the 33rd Army, which faced the Chinese in northeastern Burma. He was an energetic and efficient planner, if notoriously arrogant, and once helped quell panic in the ranks by ostentatiously having a bath under fire in the front lines.

==Postwar life and disappearance==
When the Japanese position in Burma collapsed in 1945, Tsuji escaped, first to Thailand and then to China, where he renewed the contacts made in Nanking. He also visited Vietnam, which was in disorder with the Viet Minh resisting the re-establishment of French rule. In China, Tsuji was both a prisoner and an employee of Chinese intelligence.

In 1948, he was allowed to resign from Chinese service and returned to Japan. He began publishing books and articles about his war experiences, including an account of the Japanese victory in Malaya. He also wrote of his years in hiding in &quot;Senkō Sanzenri&quot; (潜行三千里;) &quot;3,000 &quot;li&quot; (Chinese miles) in hiding&quot;, which became a best seller. He was elected to the Diet in 1952, and re-elected twice.

In April 1961, he traveled to Laos and was never heard from again. It was thought that he might have been killed in the Laotian Civil War, but there were also rumors that he became an advisor to the North Vietnamese government. He was declared dead on 20 July 1968.
==Information later disclosed in CIA files==
CIA files declassified in 2005–2006 show that Tsuji also worked for the CIA as a spy during the Cold War. The files also acknowledged Tsuji&#x27;s writings in his book &quot;Senkō Sanzenri&quot; to be mostly factual. The documents described Tsuji to be an &quot;inseparable pair&quot; with Takushiro Hattori and stated them to be &quot;extremely irresponsible&quot; and that they &quot;will not take the consequences for their actions.&quot; Additionally, Tsuji was stated to be &quot;the type of man who given the chance, would start World War III without any misgivings.&quot; As an asset to the CIA, he was described as having no value because of lack of expertise in politics and information manipulation.

Additionally, the files contain information that Hattori had allegedly planned a coup to overthrow the Japanese government in 1952 that involved the assassination of Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida and replacing him with Ichiro Hatoyama of the DPJ, but Tsuji prevented the coup by persuading the group that the real enemies were not conservatives like Yoshida but the Socialist Party. However, the files also state that the CIA learned about the attempt only after the fact and that the information was gained from an unreliable source from China. Some academics such as the media theorist and Americanist Tetsuo Arima of Waseda University have suggested that the entire story might have been a bluff leaked to the Chinese by Tsuji himself as a way to make him seem more influential than he actually was.

According to the CIA files, when Tsuji returned to Vientiane from Hanoi, he was kidnapped by the Chinese Communist Party and was being imprisoned in Yunnan, ostensibly to be used in some way to worsen Japanese-American relations or Japan&#x27;s standing in Southeast Asia. Tsuji was considered to be still alive as of 8 August 1962 on the basis of handwriting analysis conducted on the writing on an envelope that was brought on 24 August 1962. However, he was never heard from again.

<text>Jorge Hank Rhon (born January 28, 1956) is a Mexican businessman and owner of Mexico&#x27;s largest sports betting company, &quot;Grupo Caliente&quot;. He served from December 2004 to February 2007 as the president of the municipality of Tijuana. He is the son of former Mexico City mayor Carlos Hank González and Guadalupe Rhon. The Hank family has alleged links to drug trafficking. He has been accused of money laundering, murder, arrested for possession of unlicensed arms and dealing in the trade of exotic animals.

==Biography==
Of German descent, Jorge Hank Rhon studied at the Alexander von Humboldt German College and Industrial Engineering at the Universidad Anáhuac in the State of Mexico. In 1980 he founded the Grupo Taos, a company that operates pet stores and amusement parks of which he is the president of the board and general director. He moved to Tijuana in 1985 to manage the Agua Caliente Racetrack and formed the Grupo Caliente which includes the dog racing track, a hotel, a mall and a network of entertainment centers in 19 states of Mexico as well as 13 countries of Central, South America and Europe. The number of employees of the racetrack grew from 700 to close to 6,000. During his management Tijuana has hosted the Señorita México pageant, the World Boxing title fight between Julio César Chávez and Danilo Cabrera and from 1986 to 1988 the Caribe International Classic Horserace, considered the most important in Latin America. The Racetrack also hosts the Day of the Three Wise Men, Children&#x27;s Day, Mother&#x27;s Day where thousands of children and their mothers receive free food, gifts and an entertainment show since 1988. Hank also created the Cuauhtémoc Hank Foundation to give scholarships to students of all grades including studies in foreign schools. On April 20, 1988, a local newspaper columnist, Hector &quot;El Gato&quot; Félix Miranda was assassinated on his way to work. The gunmen turned out to be security guards at the Caliente track, and one had worked as well for Hank Rhon&#x27;s father, Carlos Hank Gonzalez. To this day the independent news weekly in Tijuana, ZETA, runs a full page ad with white letters: &quot;Jorge Hank: Why did your bodyguards assassinate me?&quot; &#x27;El Gato&#x27; had been a fierce critic of the Hank family.

Hank Rhon is the owner of casinos and soccer teams. He is a lover of exotic animals and the father of 23 children, some of whom are named after animals.

==Campaign for municipal president==
As a candidate for mayor of Tijuana in 2004, Hank said, &quot;“Mi animal preferido sigue siendo la mujer”&quot;. (&quot;My favorite animal is still the woman.&quot;)

Hank won the mayoral race that year, beating PAN candidate Jorge Ramos by a slim margin, thus ending 15 years of PAN government in Tijuana.

==Mayor of Tijuana==
The most notable infrastructure improvement in Tijuana during the Hank administration was the multi-million investment on an underpass at the &quot;Alba Roja&quot; intersection, just south of the &quot;5 y 10&quot; intersection. The &quot;5 y 10&quot; intersection is one of the most famous in the city and with the heaviest traffic. The investment was for a figure close to 45 million pesos, more than four million dollars.

On February 8, 2005, the Hank administration inaugurated the five million pesos Center of Communication, Control, Computing and Command (C4) that included 60 high definition cameras. In order the reduce kidnappings, a problem of Tijuana for many years, the municipal government started a program of installing GPS devices on the cars of potential victims. In 2007, a program of road safety cameras was introduced in Tijuana that issued speeding tickets in which some drivers received up to 800 tickets issued the same day, same time, and on the same location.

The Hank administration produced significant urban development but failed to significantly reduce crime In 2007, the Operation Tijuana of the Federal Government only momentarily reduced serious crimes and ordinary crimes increased 40% and it was detected corruption amongst the federal forces. The operation was then extended to the five municipalities of the state and dubbed Operation Baja California, per request of the governor Eugenio Elorduy Walther.

On February 20, 2007, Hank requested a license to leave his post as mayor. The license was approved by nine PRI representatives with six PAN representatives rejecting the license and one PRD representative abstaining from voting. Multiple billboards reporting Hank actions as mayor were put out after the annual report and PAN representative complained and offered to remove the PAN-sponsored radio spots on fighting radar camera-issued tickets.

==Runs for governor of Baja California==
===2007===
At the end of 2006, Jorge Hank expressed his wishes to run a campaign for the 2007 Baja California state election.
This flared up comments from PAN politicians saying that he would be violating the state&#x27;s &quot;Antichapulin&quot; (&quot;anti-grasshopper&quot;) law which prohibits a person of public office to &quot;jump&quot; from one charge to another without ending their current term.

In February 2007, he requested permission to leave his post as municipal president and accept the candidacy for governor by the &quot;Alianza para que vivas mejor&quot; (The Alliance So You May live better), which was approved by his party&#x27;s regidores and denied by the PAN regidores. The PAN also accused five district electoral council members of partiality toward Hank because they served as judges during his administration as president of Tijuana. The Federal Electoral Tribune rejected the complaint determining that the law does not have such restriction that would prevent these five lawyers from serving as judges and then as council members.

On June 20, 2007, Baja California&#x27;s state elections court voted 2 to 1 in favor of the validity of the so-called &quot;anti-grasshopper law&quot; thus cancelling Hank&#x27;s bid for governor. He appealed the decision before the Federal Electoral Tribunal, which unanimously upheld his candidacy on July 7, holding the state law contravened the electoral and political rights of the citizenry. Pending that decision, Hank was not a registered candidate and had to abstain from campaigning. The election date was on August 5, 2007.

According to the Baja California&#x27;s State Electoral Institute, Jorge Hank lost the election by 8 points (almost 55,000 votes) to Jose Guadalupe Osuna Millan, PAN&#x27;s candidate.

===2021===
Alfredo Ferreiro Velasco, leader of PES announced on January 26, 2021, that Jorge Hank Rhon would be its candidate for governor in 2021. As a candidate for governor, Hank Rhon said of women &quot;“[S]e les ha bajado un poquito la inteligencia”&quot; (&quot;Their intelligence has lowered a little&quot;).

==Biography==
Griswold was born near Lamoille, Nevada, on October 10, 1890. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1913, and received his law degree from the University of Michigan Law School in 1915.

<text>The siege of Ueda was staged in 1600 by Tokugawa Hidetada, son and heir of the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, against Ueda castle garrison in Shinano province, which was controlled by the Sanada family.

Hidetada came across the castle as he marched his army along the Nakasendō (central mountain road) from Edo to rendezvous with his father&#x27;s forces. Sanada Masayuki resisted, and Sanada Yukimura, second son of Masayuki, was able to fight Hidetada&#x27;s 38,000 men with only 2,000. However, when the castle did not fall as quickly as Hidetada had hoped and expected, he gave up and abandoned the siege and hurried to meet up with his father. As a result of this delay, Hidetada missed the battle of Sekigahara, the decisive victory in his father&#x27;s unification of Japan.

<doc id="874283" wikidata="Q1088083" url="?curid=874283" title="Karkadann">
<text>The Karkadann (Arabic كركدن &quot;karkadann&quot; or &quot;karkaddan&quot; from &quot;Kargadan&quot;, Persian: كرگدن) is a mythical creature said to have lived on the grassy plains of India and Iran.

The word &quot;kargadan&quot; also means rhinoceros in Persian and Arabic.

Depictions of &quot;karkadann&quot; are found also in North Indian art. Like the unicorn, it can be subdued by virgins and acts ferociously toward other animals. Originally based on the Indian rhinoceros (one of the meanings of the word) and first described in the 10th/11th century, it evolved in the works of later writers to a mythical animal &quot;with a shadowy rhinocerine ancestor&quot; endowed with strange qualities, such as a horn with medicinal qualities.

==Evolution of descriptions==

An early description of the karkadann comes from the 10/11th century Persian scholar Al-Biruni (973–1048). He describes an animal which has &quot;the build of a buffalo...a black, scaly skin; a dewlap hanging down under the skin. It has three yellow hooves on each foot...The tail is not long. The eyes lie low, farther down the cheek than is the case with all other animals. On the top of the nose there is a single horn which is bent upwards.&quot; A fragment of Al-Biruni preserved in the work of another author adds a few more characteristics: &quot;the horn is conical, bent back towards the head, and longer than a span...the animal&#x27;s ears protrude on both sides like those of a donkey, and...its upper lip forms into a finger-shape, like the protrusion on the end of an elephant&#x27;s trunk.&quot; These two descriptions leave no doubt that the Indian Rhinoceros is the basis for the animal. But the future confusion between the rhinoceros and the unicorn was already in the making since the Persian language uses the same word, &quot;karkadann&quot;, for the mythological animal as it does for the rhinoceros, and this confusion is evident also in the illustrations of the creature.

After Al-Biruni, Persian scholars took his description and formed ever more fanciful versions of the beast, aided by the absence of first-hand knowledge and the difficulty of reading and interpreting old Arabic script. A decisive shift in description concerned the horn: where Al-Biruni had stuck to the short, curved horn, later writers made it a long, straight horn, which was shifted in artists&#x27; representations from the animal&#x27;s nose to its brow.

The Persian physician Zakariya al-Qazwini (Al-Qazwini, d. 1283) is one of the writers who at the end of the thirteenth century links the karkadann&#x27;s horn with poison, in his &quot;Aja&#x27;ib al-Makhluqat&quot;. He lists a few beneficial effects: holding the horn opens up the bowels to relieve constipation, and it can cure epilepsy and lameness. Later authors had the horn perspire when poison is present, suggesting the horn is an antidote and connecting it to alicorn, though this connection is not made by all writers.

In the 14th century, Ibn Battuta, in his travelogue, calls the rhinoceros he saw in India a karkadann, and describes it as a ferocious beast, driving away from its territory animals as big as the elephant; this is the legend that is told in &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; in the &quot;Second Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor&quot;.

The karkadann is referred to by Elmer Suhr as the &quot;Persian version of the unicorn&quot;. The name appears also in medieval European bestiaries, such as those from Escorial and Paris, where the name &quot;karkadann&quot; appears in the captions of unicorn illustrations.

==Horn==
Al-Qazwini, one of the earliest authors to claim the horn is an antidote to poison, also notes that it is used in the manufacturing of knife handles. According to Chris Lavers, &quot;The Natural History of Unicorns&quot;, khutu, a somewhat enigmatic material possibly consisting of ivory or bone, had been ascribed properties. Both of these &quot;enigmatic horns,&quot; Lavers argues, were used in making cutlery, and so became associated; this is how in the 13th century Al-Qazwini could consider karkadann horn as an antidote, and this is how the karkadann became associated with the unicorn.

==Name==
The name &quot;karkadann&quot; is a variation of the Kurdish name which means donkey with one horn [Kar kit Dan]. Persian &quot;kargadan&quot;, or Sanskrit &quot;kartajan&quot;, which is said to mean &quot;lord of the desert&quot;. Fritz Hommel suspects that the word entered Semitic languages via Arabs from Abyssinia. Other spellings and pronunciations include &quot;karkaddan&quot;, &quot;kardunn&quot;, &quot;karkadan&quot;, and &quot;karkend&quot;.

It has been conjectured that the mythical karkadann may have an origin in an account from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

The initial portion of Persian &quot;kargadan&quot; resembles the Sanskrit word &quot;khaRga&quot; for rhinoceros also meaning sword, where &quot;R&quot; represents a retroflex flap sound. The rhinoceros is &quot;sword horned&quot;.

==The karkadann in modern scholarship and culture==

===Scholarship on the karkadann===
Much of the available material on the karkadann was collected by Richard Ettinghausen in his 1950 publication &quot;The Unicorn&quot;, a book highly praised and often referred to as a standard reference on the unicorn.

===Notable appearances and references===
The karkadann is the topic of a long poem by Tawfiq Sayigh (d. 1971), &quot;A Few Questions I Pose to the Unicorn,&quot; which was hailed by Jabra Ibrahim Jabra as &quot;the strangest and most remarkable poem in the Arabic language.&quot;

Modern Iraq still has a tradition of &quot;tears of the karkadann,&quot; &quot;dumiu al-karkadan&quot;, which are reddish beads used in the Misbaha, the Muslim prayer beads (&quot;subuhat&quot;). The accompanying legend says that the rhinoceros spends days in the desert looking for water; when he does, he first weeps &quot;out of fatigue and thirst-pain.&quot; These tears, as they fall into the water of the drinking hole, turn into beads.

Peter Beagle (author of &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;) wrote a story, &quot;My Son Heydari and the Karkadann,&quot; in The Overneath (c)2017.

<doc id="874291" wikidata="Q1358091" url="?curid=874291" title="Battle of Uedahara">
<text>The was the first defeat suffered by Takeda Shingen, and the first field battle in Japan in which firearms were used. It took place in Shinano Province or the modern-day Nagano Prefecture.

== Battle ==
The Battle of Uedahara was part of Shingen&#x27;s attempt to control Shinano Province. Shingen&#x27;s father had invaded the territory and the clan was already in control of the bulk of its southern region around Lake Suwa. Shingen&#x27;s campaign began with the takeover of Shika castle, which alarmed Murakami Yoshikiyo due to its proximity to his territories. The latter sent an army tasked with aiding Shika but it was ambushed by Shingen&#x27;s troops at Odaihara. Yoshikiyo began mobilizing his forces in March 1548 to capture Shiga and drive Shingen out of Shinano.

Takeda Shingen met up with his force that had taken Shika castle, and led 7000 men north to face the threat posed by Yoshikiyo. Shingen&#x27;s vanguard was led by Itagaki Nobukata; when they charged head-on into Murakami&#x27;s vanguard, the charge was absorbed, and Itagaki was killed.

Murakami made use of 50 &quot;ashigaru&quot; armed with Japanese &quot;hand cannon&quot; arquebuses, who were meant to serve as support for archers. The army also used short-barreled Chinese handguns to counter the enemy&#x27;s cavalry. Shingen, on the other hand, adhered to the traditional battle strategy and failed to use the &quot;tanegashima&quot; first. Around 700 of Takeda&#x27;s men were killed, including Itagaki, and two other generals, Amari Torayasu and Hajikano Den&#x27;emon. Shingen himself even suffered a spear wound to his left arm.

== Aftermath ==
Despite Murakami&#x27;s victory, his power was significantly diminished after the battle of Uedahara. This was attributed to the death of his top-ranking samurai, crippling his capability to stand up on his own. On the other hand, Shingen benefited from the conflict, expanding his power further as he gained the Kousaka, Inoue, Mennai, Suda, Takanashi, and Seba districts.

<text>Michael Alexander Verhoeven (13 July 1938 – 22 April 2024) was a German film director, screenwriter, film and television producer, and actor. He was also a qualified Doctor of Medicine. He was considered a political filmmaker.

== Biography ==
Michael Verhoeven stemmed from a theatre and film family, the son of the German film director Paul Verhoeven (1901–1975) and actress Doris Kiesow (1902–1973).

Michael Verhoeven married Austrian actress Senta Berger in 1966 and stayed with her until his death in 2024 – in what is considered one of the longest-running scandal-free marriages in show business. Their sons are screenwriter/director/actor Simon Verhoeven (born 1972) and producer/actor Luca Verhoeven (born 1979). Verhoeven and Berger met at the Berlinale in 1960 and played together in front of the camera in the 1963 film &quot;Jack and Jenny&quot;, where he was supposed to kiss her in one scene. The two fell in love during filming. The couple had two sons, Simon Vincent (born 1972) and Luca Paul (born 1979). The children followed in their parents&#x27; footsteps: Simon Verhoeven is a director and screenwriter, whereas Luca Verhoeven is a producer. Both sons started out as actors and also work in the family business, Sentana Filmproduktion.

Verhoeven died after a short and serious illness in the presence of his family at his Grünwald home, on 22 April 2024. He was 85.

== Career ==
Michael Verhoeven began his career as an artist as a nine-year-old in plays (including a stage adaptation of &quot;Pünktchen und Anton&quot; based on the novel by Erich Kästner, a friend of the family) and subsequently appeared in films in the 1950s (such as Kästner&#x27;s &quot;The Flying Classroom&quot;, &quot;The Juvenile Judge&quot; and &quot;The Crammer&quot; with Heinz Rühmann). He directed his first play at the Tübingen Zimmertheater in 1962.

As a young adult, however, Verhoeven decided to study medicine against the wishes of his parents, who encouraged him to continue his acting career. He obtained his doctorate in 1969 with a thesis on psychiatric masking of brain tumors with special consideration of misleading findings and worked as a doctor for several years – including in the USA, where he had followed his wife Senta Berger, who was acting in Hollywood films in the 1960s alongside stars such as Charlton Heston, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Richard Widmark, John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, and Yul Brynner.

Back in Munich in 1965, he founded Sentana Filmproduktion together with his wife and began directing films – starting with &quot;The Dance of Death&quot; based on August Strindberg&#x27;s play of the same name. He followed up with two frolicky &#x27;60s lifestyle comedies &quot;Up the Establishment&quot; with Mario Adorf and Gila von Weiterhausen in the leading roles (1968), and &quot;Student of the Bedroom&quot; (1969), both produced by Rob Houwer.

Verhoeven&#x27;s political and experimental 1970 anti-Vietnam War film &quot;o.k.&quot; was entered into the 20th Berlin International Film Festival, but led to a scandal that forced the collapse of the festival without the awarding of any prizes: The then-jury president George Stevens felt offended and threatened to remove the experimental film from the program because of its supposed anti-American invective. The Berlinale regulations were subsequently reformed. Later that year, &quot;o.k.&quot; went on to win the German Film Award in Gold. For its 50th anniversary, MoMA conducted a special screening in 2021.

In the 1970s, Verhoeven worked increasingly for television, including directing one of the first episodes of Germany&#x27;s longest-running crime procedural series &quot;Tatort&quot; (for which he would direct another episode 33 years later in 2005). After becoming a father for the first time in 1972, he wrote and directed the anarchic children&#x27;s series &quot;Krempoli&quot; in 1975, in which he played a smaller part and also cast his father Paul Verhoeven and his sister Lis Verhoeven alongside Senta Berger. In 1980, he made the television film &quot;Die Ursache&quot; with Otto Sander. In the same year, his theatrical release &quot;Sunday Children&quot; (&quot;Sonntagskinder)&quot; got screened at the Cannes Film Festival.

In 1982, he wrote, directed, and co-produced the story of the resistance fighters against the Nazi regime, the siblings Hans and Sophie Scholl, in &quot;Die weiße Rose&quot; (&quot;The White Rose&quot;). The German Foreign Office banned official screenings abroad when Verhoeven refused to remove a critical commentary from the credits. The film won Silver at the German Film Awards. Based on the true story essay book &quot;A Case of Resistance and Persecution, Passau 1933–39,&quot; by Anja Romus, he wrote and directed &quot;The Nasty Girl&quot; ( &quot;Das schreckliche Mädchen&quot;) in 1990, which won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 40th Berlinale, the BAFTA for Best Foreign Language Film, Best Foreign Language Film at the 56th New York Film Critics Circle Award, and gained an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the 63rd Academy Awards. These two films cemented his international reputation as an important political voice in European film. Along with his adaptation of George Tabori&#x27;s memoire &quot;&quot; (with music by his son Simon Verhoeven, who also played a supporting part), and the documentary &quot;Der unbekannte Soldat&quot; (&quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;), Verhoeven was praised for his relentless examination of the Nazi regime in Germany and its aftermath.

Promoting &quot;The Nasty Girl&quot; in the US in 1990, Verhoeven explained his interest in remembrance culture or rather the lack thereof: “The danger is that we will really forget. But we are very rich right now, and it could happen that we become not quite so rich. Many social problems will show up with the so-called reunification, and with the social problems it could be that Germans again look for enemies. This is what I am scared of. We know so little about Eastern Germany, and the eastern people also don&#x27;t know too much about our history. What they were told in school is even more wrong than what we were told.”

In 1992, he became a member of the jury at the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival.

Verhoeven became a professor at the Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg in Ludwigsburg in the 1990s, passing on his knowledge to the next generation of filmmakers. For decades, Verhoeven also ran movie theaters in Berlin: the &quot;Toni&quot; at Antonplatz and the &quot;Olympia Filmtheater&quot; in Prenzlauer Berg until he sold the properties in the late 2010s.

In 2000, Verhoeven wrote and directed the controversial television film &quot;Enthüllung einer Ehe (Uncover of a Marriage)&quot;, which deals with the then still-taboo subject of transgender identity, for which he won the Robert Geisendörfer Preis, as well as two FIPA Awards at the International Festival of Audiovisual Programmes in Biarritz.

Together with wife Senta Berger, he was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit in 1999 and the Bavarian Order of Merit in 2002. In 2005, Verhoeven received the Marion Samuel Prize, which honors particularly effective ways of combating the forgetting, suppression, and relativization of the crimes committed by Germans during the Nazi era. In 2006, he got an Honorary Lifetime Award from the Bavarian Film Awards.

In 2000, Verhoeven made his first documentary: &quot;Der Fall Liebl&quot; – &quot;Ein Bayer in Togo&quot;, about a late repatriate who was unfamiliar with German bureaucracy and was threatened with deportation. In 2006, after seven years of work, his second documentary &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; about reactions to the Wehrmacht exhibition was released. In his 2008 documentary &quot;Human Failure&quot; (&quot;Menschliches Versagen&quot;), Verhoeven dealt with the question of the extent to which the German civil population profited from the confiscation of Jewish assets during the Nazi era. The film was screened at the Jerusalem Film Festival. In his 2011 documentary &quot;The Second Execution of Romell Broom&quot; (&quot;Die zweite Hinrichtung – Amerika und die Todesstrafe&quot;), made in collaboration with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Verhoeven took on the subject of capital punishment, following the death sentence for Romell Broom, found guilty for rape and murder, and his execution on 15 September 2009 in Lucasville, Ohio, which failed 18 times and was finally aborted.

However, Verhoeven was no stranger to light entertainment, most notably with his 1989 – 2002 television series &quot;Die schnelle Gerdi&quot; (&quot;Fast Gerdi&quot;) which starred Senta Berger as a smart and self-reliant Munich cab driver.

Verhoeven was one of the founding members of the Deutsche Filmakademie (German Film Academy, an organisation akin to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) in 2003.

His last directorial and screenwriting work, &quot;Let&#x27;s go!&quot;, was adapted in 2014 from the autobiographical novel &quot;Von Zuhause wird nichts erzählt&quot; by Laura Waco about her Jewish family in postwar Munich.

In 2015, Verhoeven co-produced &quot;Welcome to Germany&quot; (&quot;Willkommen bei den Hartmanns&quot;) written, directed, and co-producted by son Simon Verhoeven, in which Senta Berger played the leading role. This sharp-tongued comedy about the 2015 refugee crisis became the most successful German cinema film of the year (3.8 million viewers) and won the German Film Award, the Bavarian Film Award for Best Production, the Audience Award, the Peace Prize of German Film, the Goldene Leinwand, and the Bambi Award, among others.

<doc id="874301" wikidata="Q731408" url="?curid=874301" title="Bugatti EB 110">
<text>The Bugatti EB 110 is a mid-engine sports car initially conceived by Paolo Stanzani in the mid 1980s and produced by Bugatti Automobili S.p.A. from 1991 until 1995, when the company was liquidated. The model restarted the brand&#x27;s presence in the automobile industry after a hiatus of nearly 40 years (since 1952).

In the period from 1992 to 1995 the EB 110 competed against cars such as the Lamborghini Diablo, Jaguar XJ220, Ferrari F40 and Ferrari F50 (launched 1995) and McLaren F1. 

139 examples were built, plus small number of post-production cars which were completed after the bankruptcy. The last one was built by Dauer Sportwagen in 2002 and one additional unfinished example was completed in 2019. It was the only production model made by Romano Artioli&#x27;s Italian incarnation of Bugatti.

== History==

Discussions of a new supercar had taken place between Ferruccio Lamborghini and Paolo Stanzani at the end of 1984 during telephone calls and at the Turin Auto Show.

Stanzani warned Mr. Lamborghini that developing a new car was increasingly tough financially and that the engine development was a possible task but the bodywork would be resource intensive. He suggested that Nuccio Bertone could provide help with the bodywork design and manufacture. Bertone was involved in early talks for a collaboration on the exterior design but declined to continue the discussions after noting the conflict of interest that the potential majority investor, Autoexpo (and Romano Artioli), had in its distribution contracts of Ferrari cars in Germany. Jean-Marc Borel established the holding companies together with Artioli&#x27;s lawyer. On 11 May 1987 Autoexpo paid 7,500,00 French Francs to Messier Hispano Bugatti (Snecma Safran Aircraft Engines) for the purchase of the Bugatti brand and on 14 October 1987 Bugatti Automobili S.p.A. was founded.
Stanzani, minority shareholder in Bugatti Automobili was chosen as company Technical Director and sole Managing Director (&#x27;Amministratore Unico&#x27; in Italian) thanks to his career experience with Lamborghini vehicles including the Miura, Countach, Espada, Urraco, Jarama, Jalpa.

== Initial Development ==
Stanzani had given the new supercar the code FL12, shorthand notation for &#x27;Ferruccio Lamborghini 12-cylinder&#x27; and its development started in 1986 on the engine and chassis, with work being led by Stanzani and design/development carried out by Oliviero Pedrazzi and the engineers/draughtsmen at Tecnostile. The trio of Oliviero Pedrazzi, Achille Bevini and Tiziano Benedetti had worked on the Lamborghini Miura chassis and engine development as well as the Lamborghini Urraco and Lamborghini Countach, a successful Stanzani-conceived car that had carried Lamborghini through times of financial ups and down in the worldwide economies. Benedetti, Bevini and Pedrazzi had subsequently established their own company which was known to Ferruccio Lamborghini and Paolo Stanzani who were involved in early talks with Romano Artioli. Tecnostile was involved in several projects, including the transversely mounted V16 engine of the Cizeta (formerly Cizeta-Moroder V16T) for Claudio Zampolli (ex-Lamborghini employee).

During the early phases of the project, development was entirely carried out by Tecnostile at their workshops in via Don Milani #102, Modena. Pedrazzi focused on engine and chassis design, Bevini on bodywork and Benedetti on relations with suppliers. Amongst the employees was Maurizio Reggiani who had previously worked as engine designer in Maserati.

Several employees from Lamborghini joined the newborn Bugatti project on the basis of their trust in Stanzani. One of these was Lamborghini test driver Loris Bicocchi who was employee #7 in Campogalliano. He would patiently wait one year before beginning early testing of the EB 110 prototype.
== Engine and Chassis ==
Engine and chassis development was led by Stanzani and design/drawing was done by Pedrazzi as leader of the engineers and draughtsmen in Tecnostile. Pedrazzi had experience of engine design since his work in Ferrari under the supervision of Bizzarrini (250 GTO) and in Lamborghini.

The power would come from a &#x27;small&#x27; displacement V12 engine, with a 3500 cc swept volume that mirrored the requirements of the Formula 1 rules of 1987. The naturally aspirated form did not produce sufficient torque and power for a supercar and Stanzani had envisaged the usage of turbocharging. The choice of engine configuration, size and turbocharging was for technical, marketing and strategic reasons. The choice of four turbochargers was primarily due to the expected lag (compressor and turbine rotational inertia) that two larger turbochargers might have had.

The chassis utilised a planar (flat) material made by two aluminium skins (typically 0.9 to 1.5mm thick) separated by aluminium honeycomb (typically 8 to 12mm thick), all bonded by epoxy glue. The sheets were cut to dimension and then glued and riveted to form a 3-dimensional shape for the chassis. The choice of carbon skins sandwiching aluminium or Nomex honeycomb was not adopted by Stanzani due to the lack of experience in manufacture and repair in Italy. Furthermore the aluminium-aluminium material was more cost-effective.
== Styling and early prototype testing ==
Several designers received copies of the chassis drawings in order to propose styling for the bodywork: Paolo Martin, Giorgetto Giugiaro, Bertone and Marcello Gandini. Bertone proposed a design prepared by Marc Deschamps (who went on to style the B.Engineering Edonis in 1999) but soon after lost interest in the project. That same design would be presented again as Bertone Lotus Emotion.
Giugiaro&#x27;s Bugatti ID90 prototype was presented some time later at the 1990 Turin Car Show.
Martin&#x27;s proposal was avantgarde but rejected by the Bugatti management.

Gandini gained wider acceptance by being well known to Stanzani and having worked on the styling of many successful performance cars: Lamborghini Miura, Lancia Stratos Zero and the production Lancia Stratos, Alfa Romeo Carabo, Alfa Romeo Montreal, Cizeta-Moroder V16T. He would design the Lamborghini Diablo soon after.

Initial prototypes based on Gandini&#x27;s design were bodied by carrozzeria Ilas; these began testing in 1991.

== Restyling ==
Bugatti&#x27;s President was not happy with Gandini&#x27;s angular design language incorporating a shovel nose and flared rear wheel arches.
According to Gandini, Trucco and Stanzani, Artioli did not formally state his rejection of the original styling because he had in fact approved the 1:1 scale model.

Later interviews with Giampaolo Benedini revealed more detail on the fact that Artioli had asked him to propose some alternative design ideas for the car to go into production.
Artioli did not favour the aluminium honeycomb chassis proposed by Stanzani. Stanzani defended the choice of the aluminium-aluminium honeycomb chassis on the basis of being sufficiently stiff (in torsion and bending) while being cost-effective and repairable. Artioli pushed for a carbon-aluminium chassis on the basis of his concern with safety and due to the likely popularity of carbon composite in cutting edge supercars of the future.

Gandini made a second iteration of the design with softer lines, revised front and rear lights, and subtly different proportions for the rear wheel arches – styling cues also visible in the Maserati Chubasco of 1990. The second Gandini design replaced the network of cooling ducts on the bonnet with ducts in the front bumper and at the outer flanks of the two large fixed headlamps which replaced the early prototype&#x27;s pop-up units. The scissor doors, the large windshield, and the side window design were retained. This design was only possible for a Bugatti once Maserati had decided not to construct a supercar and therefore declined to take on the Chubasco proposal. The first Gandini prototype styling and the restyling were separated by approximately 2 years. Artioli, however, still was not fully convinced of the exterior design and wanted further detail design changes which Gandini refused to make because they would alter its DNA: for example the shape of the front intake and the placement of the Bugatti &#x27;shoe-horse&#x27;. Artioli thus tasked Gianpaolo Benedini (who had designed the &quot;Blue Factory&quot;) to make the requested changes. Benedini made small changes by placing a very small &#x27;shoe-horse&#x27; at the front air intake and took responsibility of the interior design together with Laurens van den Acker of Design System.

== Change of chassis material ==
Artioli had from the beginning been against the use of the aluminium &amp; aluminium honeycomb chassis material. He based his decision on the fact that racing drivers had lost their life with such a chassis (for example Gilles Villeneuve, where the seat belt mounts had torn off the chassis); he was also concerned that the material was soft and the skins and honeycomb would separate on slow speed impacts of the chassis against kerbs and other road objects.
Stanzani asked quotes from Aerospatiale for the supply of carbon-composite material to understand the benefits versus costs. He discussed at length with Aerospatiale the technical details and critical aspects of the chassis.
The French company presented proposals (quotes) for aluminium skins with aluminium honeycomb core and an alternative with carbon-fibre skins and honeycomb core. Stanzani viewed the carbon-aluminium quote as financially not viable for Bugatti Automobili and reported this to Artioli.
After Stanzani&#x27;s departure, further meetings were held between Dario Trucco (consulting on the overall delivery of the bodywork) and Oliviero Pedrazzi and the staff from Aerospatiale (Jean-Jacques Bodu, Georges Teyssier, Roland Bignolais) in the period of 4-5 September 1990, where Aerospatiale discussed the usage of the composite material in aircraft and certain details pertaining to manufacturing and crash impact resistance.
At a later stage tests were done on the torsional stiffness of the chassis in their two respective materials (both tests conducted without the upper steel roof tubular structure, so just the &#x27;tub&#x27;). The composite material proved stiffer but according to Trucco and Pedrazzi also heavier and significantly more expensive.

The carbon fibre chassis kept the same dimensions and panel split lines as designed by Pedrazzi in the original aluminium and aluminium honeycomb design, giving the car improved stiffness which allowed it to better achieve its targets of ride and handling. The chassis consisted of separate panels that were bonded and riveted together to remove the need for very large autoclaves. 

== Departure of Ing. Stanzani and arrival of Ing. Materazzi ==
Conflicts of opinion on the company direction between Stanzani and Artioli led to the respective departure of Gandini and Stanzani from the project. 
Stanzani&#x27;s original vehicle concept was technologically advanced (4WD, turbo, short wheelbase) and relatively light in terms of interior features. Artioli on the other hand wanted the car to represent the Bugatti brand and therefore include well appointed soft seats and electrical switches, which would add several hundred kilograms to the final kerb weight of the EB 110.

Artioli had increased the capital in the venture, thereby diluting Stanzani&#x27;s share, and had started to take more involvement in vehicle development compared to previously.

The role of technical director was filled by Nicola Materazzi, who had experience of working with Lancia, Abarth, Osella, Ferrari, Cagiva (and later Laverda), and had been Chief Engineer for the Lancia Stratos GR5, Ferrari 288 GTO Evoluzione, Ferrari F40 and Cagiva C589.

Materazzi had primarily a racing car background and a reputation for making minimalist performance cars, as evidenced by the 288 GTO Evoluzione and F40. His view of performance cars was evidently different from that of Romano Artioli and this would eventually lead to similar conflict as Artioli had had with Stanzani.
One of the first tasks for Materazzi was that of following the work at Aerospatiale with the simulation and physical torsional stiffness tests of the composite chassis.

Materazzi brought his engines experience (on Ferrari Testarossa, Ferrari 328 Turbo, Ferrari 288 GTO and Ferrari F40) to solve the problem which was affecting the engine&#x27;s durability on the dynamometer: excessive friction between titanium con-rods in contact. He then moved on to re-calculating the vehicle front to rear torque distribution. Test drivers Jean-Philippe Vittecoq and Loris Bicocchi stated that the cars were understeering too much so Materazzi altered the torque distribution from 40:60 to 27:73 and the drivers were satisfied with the handling improvement. The initial torque distribution had been calculated based on the static weight distribution of the vehicle and in similar way to rally vehicles of the 1980s (such as the Audi Quattro). The updated torque distribution was calculated based on the dynamic load distribution under acceleration, which takes into account of load transfer (vehicle mass * acceleration * centre of gravity height / wheelbase).
Materazzi attended aerodynamic testing at the Pininfarina wind tunnel and instructed changes to the front air intake (to the radiators) and its outlet to allow the radiator to function effectively, a detail which had been neglected by the Gandini/Benedini style.

The car was released with many innovative technologies that were scarcely used by the automotive industry at the time, such as a carbon fibre monocoque chassis, active aerodynamics, quad turbocharging (two per cylinder bank) and an all-wheel-drive system for safer handling (especially on wet roads). In particular the 4WD system had been a cornerstone of the Stanzani design that Ferrari was unable to productionise successfully (Forghieri had only built a prototype of the 408 4RM) and that Lamborghini would introduce only in 1993 with the Diablo VT (&#x27;Viscous Transmission&#x27;).

The design elements of the car paid homage to the distinctive Bugatti automobiles of the past. The name EB 110 is an abbreviation for the company&#x27;s founder, Ettore Bugatti and his 110th birthday (born 15 Sep 1881).

== Unveiling ==

The Bugatti EB 110 GT was unveiled on 14 September 1991 in front of the Grande Arche de la Défense, near Paris.
An evening gala was held at Versailles with 1700 guests. A continued launch day was held in Molsheim on 15 September, exactly 110 years after Ettore Bugatti&#x27;s birth. 

A lighter and more powerful variant with called the EB 110 Super Sport was introduced at the 1992 Geneva Motor Show just six months after the introduction of the GT. The Super Sport variant was lighter than the GT by which was achieved by the use of carbon-fibre body panels on the exterior and in the interior. The Super Sport could attain a top speed of and could accelerate from in 3.2 seconds.

Early in 1994, Formula One driver Michael Schumacher purchased a yellow EB 110 Super Sport, giving the company a great deal of publicity. Soon after this, the car that Schumacher bought gained further publicity when Schumacher accidentally crashed his EB 110 into a truck and blamed &quot;inadequate brakes&quot; for the crash. Despite this, the car was repaired and Schumacher retained the car until 2003.

Derek Hill, son of American Formula One champion Phil Hill, was one of three drivers on a team that competed with an EB 110 in the United States at the 1996 24 Hours of Daytona.

== Departure of Ing. Materazzi and arrival of Ing. Forghieri ==
Nicola Materazzi left the company in December 1992 after irreconcilable differences with president Romano Artioli. Materazzi was typically focused on minimalist cars with little regard to marketing. Artioli was much more focused on the marketing potential of the vehicle as well as its role in representing the glorious brand. The two had diametrically opposite viewpoints. Materazzi had been in favour of a light car, preferably with two-wheel-drive and two instead of four turbochargers but had obliged with the continuation of the specification wanted by Artioli. Furthermore Materazzi was against the deviation of focus and finances towards the EB112. A late evening discussion led to Materazzi&#x27;s decision to part ways with Bugatti Automobili.

Mauro Forghieri stepped into the role of technical director and remained until mid 1994. During this time he oversaw the development of the EB112, whose &#x27;hands on&#x27; development was carried out by Oliviero Pedrazzi and colleagues. Forghieri seeked to used his experience to lower the cost of the vehicle but most of the designs and contracts were already in place. He also proposed to Artioli and Benedini some options for a smaller Bugatti that would allow the company to improve its finances: this was the EB120 styled by Steeve Bernaud. Zagato designer Norihiko Harada produced sketches and renderings for a convertible or targa version of the EB 110.

== Company financial difficulties ==
Hard times hit the company in 1995 and the company was bankrupt as a result of several factors:

* chairman Artioli&#x27;s purchase of Lotus Cars for ~£30m ($50m)
* the company&#x27;s expenditure to develop the EB112 four door saloon
* the missed payments to several suppliers since 1993.
Dauer Racing GmbH of Nuremberg, Germany, bought the semi-finished EB 110 cars in the assembly plant plus the parts inventory through the bankruptcy trustee. The remaining chassis were later developed by B Engineering into their Edonis sports car which uses the monocoque chassis of the EB 110 combined with a modified version of its engine, enlarged to 3.8 litres of displacement.
== Specifications ==

The car has a 60-valve, quad-turbocharged V12 engine fed through 12 individual throttle bodies, powering all four wheels through a six-speed manual transmission. The engine has a bore x stroke of .
The EB 110 GT had a power output of at 8,000 rpm and of torque at 3,750 rpm. 
The performance oriented Super Sport version had the engine tuned to a maximum power output of at 8,250 rpm and of torque at 4,200 rpm.

The car uses a double wishbone suspension mounted to a chassis made from carbon fibre skins bonded to aluminium honeycomb. Equipped with Gandini&#x27;s trademark scissor doors, it has a glass engine cover that provides a view of the V12 engine. The GT is equipped with a speed-sensitive electronic rear wing and active air flaps near the rear window that can be raised at the flick of a switch manually, while the Super Sport has a fixed rear wing.

==Records==
On 24 May 1992 Jean-Philippe Vittecoq drove an EB 110 GT to an average speed (across 6 runs) of 342.7 km/h at Nardo&#x27; Proving Ground in Puglia, Italy, beating the official speed of 325 set by the Lamborghini Diablo.

On 30 May 1993 Vittecoq drove a Bugatti EB 110 SS to 355 km/h again at Nardo&#x27;. For a short time this was a speed record, until it was surpassed by the McLaren F1 which reached 386.4 km/h in 1998 at Ehra-Lessien, Germany, in the hands of Andy Wallace (racing driver).

On 3 July 1994 at Nardo&#x27; Loris Bicocchi drove an EB 110 GT powered by methane fuel to a speed of 344.7 km/h.

On 2 March 1995 Monegasque Gildo Pallanca Pastor drove an EB 110 with dedicated wheels and studded tyres in Oulu, Finland, reaching an average speed of 296.34 km/h and peak speed of 315 km/h.

During testing at the Nürburgring Nordschleife, the EB 110 prototype could complete the lap in a time of 7 minutes 44 seconds according to test driver Loris Bicocchi.

This time was faster than that of 7:46.36 set unofficially by the Jaguar XJ220. 

==EB 110 continuation cars==
===Dauer EB 110===

Dauer Sportwagen in Nuremberg, Germany, bought the remaining stock of EB 110 parts from the Bugatti factory after the company went bankrupt in 1995. A complete spare parts catalogue, with exploded diagrams and part numbers was made by the company. Three Super Sport models and a GT model were finished between 1999 and 2000 with the Bugatti logo and minor modifications.

The remaining incomplete chassis were used between 2001 and 2002 to manufacture five significantly improved cars called the Dauer EB 110 Super Sport Light Weight. Power output was increased to , turbo lag was decreased and weight was reduced by with the use of a body made from carbon fibre. Top speed of the car was estimated at , acceleration from a standstill to 97 km/h takes 3.3 seconds and the car covers the standing kilometre in 19 seconds. A power output increase to with sports exhaust and modified ECU was available as factory option.

The company Dauer Sportwagen went bankrupt in 2008. All original Bugatti parts, including the high performance parts of the EB 110 Super Sport and the equipment, were bought in 2011 by the company Toscana-Motors GmbH located in Kaiserslautern, Germany.

==Cars based on the EB 110==

===B Engineering Edonis===

The B Engineering Edonis is based on the Bugatti EB 110 Super Sport but has been extensively re-engineered, retaining little more than the carbon-fibre chassis from the original Bugatti sports car. It was conceived by Nicola Materazzi and styled by Marc Deschamps and introduced in 2000 with a complete exterior and interior redesign. The 3.5-litre Bugatti engine has had its displacement increased from 3,500 cc to 3,760 cc. The original four small IHI turbochargers have been replaced by two larger units from the same manufacturer. Engine power has been increased from and of torque to at 8,000 rpm and of torque. A version with 720 bhp set a speed of 359.6 km/h at the Nardo&#x27; proving ground in Italy.
In addition, the four-wheel-drive triple-differential drivetrain from the donor car has been replaced with a much simpler and lighter rear-wheel-drive transaxle, thus saving approximately from the total weight. The car weighing has a power-to-weight ratio of 480 hp/ton. In addition, the engine&#x27;s specific power output is an unprecedented 181 hp/litre. The brand claims a maximum speed of while acceleration from 0 to being achieved in 3.9 seconds. All changes were aimed at simplifying the vehicle.

B Engineering produced 2 prototypes of the Edonis (one in gold colour and one in &#x27;Rosso Pompeiano&#x27; red) out of the parts retained by the company of the original EB 110 when Bugatti S.p.A. went bankrupt. The project had caught the interest of Hispano Suiza but the discussions broke down over the valuation of the project in view of a sale.

Apart from manufacturing the Edonis, B Engineering also provided spare parts and service for the original EB 110 until 2023.

== Aftermarket modifications ==

=== Brabus EB 110 ===

The Brabus EB 110 is a modified version of the EB 110 Super Sports by German automotive tuning company Brabus. The car has not received any exterior modifications by the company with most of the modifications done to the interior and engine. The car has a bi colour blue and black leather interior and a custom made quad pipe exhaust system. Engine modifications of the car along with its performance statistics remain unknown. This is the only EB 110 modified by the company. The car&#x27;s existence was known after it was put on sale in 2013.

==Motorsport==
The EB 110 LM participated in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1994. The car qualified a very competitive 17th overall and 5th in the GT1 class but did not finish the race. The car is now on display at the Lohéac Automobile Museum. A second car commissioned by wealthy pharmaceutical entrepreneur Martino Finotto also participated in the 1996 24 Hours of Daytona, but suffered a gearbox problem and did not finish.

<doc id="874325" wikidata="Q1841812" url="?curid=874325" title="Gloria (American TV series)">
<text>Gloria is an American television sitcom and a spin-off of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; that aired on CBS from September 26, 1982, to April 10, 1983. The series stars Sally Struthers reprising her role as Gloria Stivic, the daughter of Archie Bunker on &quot;All in the Family&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The set-up of the show was that Gloria had been left at loose ends after her husband, Michael &quot;Meathead&quot; Stivic (who did not appear in the new series), left her for one of his students and moved to a nudist commune. Gloria, to be closer to her now-widowed father, decided to move with her young son, Joey (played by Christian Jacobs), and pick up the pieces of her life by returning to New York City from California. However, Gloria, not wanting to raise Joey in the city, decides to take a job as an assistant to two veterinarians in the fictitious upstate town of Fox Ridge. The veterinarians were played by Burgess Meredith and Jo de Winter; the character played by Meredith was also Gloria&#x27;s landlord.

CBS chose not to renew &quot;Gloria&quot; for a second season, despite the fact that the show ranked 18th for the season.

==Pilot==
CBS rejected &quot;Gloria&quot;″s original pilot which featured a brief cameo by Carroll O&#x27;Connor as Archie Bunker dropping off Gloria and Joey at Dr. Adams&#x27; clinic and residence. It was instead aired as a backdoor pilot episode within &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;. This pilot was written by veteran &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; writers Pat Shea and Harriett Weiss and &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; producer and close Carroll O&#x27;Connor associate Joe Gannon who co-created, wrote and produced the pilot. They were replaced by former &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; writers Steve Marshall and Dan Guntzelman (who would later find success writing and producing the long-running ABC sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot; as well as creating and producing its spin-off show, &quot;Just the Ten of Us&quot;).

The show&#x27;s production was moved from CBS Television City to Universal Studios. According to a December 1982 feature interview with Sally Struthers in&quot; TV Guide&quot;, this did not sit well with Carroll O&#x27;Connor who, with the rest of the &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; production staff, was effectively shut out of the production of &quot;Gloria&quot; (even Norman Lear, who created &quot;All in the Family&quot; and had some hand in all of its other spin-offs, had no credited involvement in &quot;Gloria&quot;). After this, O&#x27;Connor chose to be uninvolved in the retooled pilot and series. The characters of Dr. Jim Waynewrite and Ben the handyman were dropped when Marshall and Guntzelman&#x27;s second pilot was made, which went to series. In the second pilot, Joey adopted a black dog that he named Archie after his grandfather, which O&#x27;Connor was said to be less than thrilled about, according to the same 1982 &quot;TV Guide&quot; article. In the original pilot, actress Jo de Winter&#x27;s character, Maggie Lawrence, is an assistant to Dr. Adams. In the second pilot and the series, Maggie Lawrence is a veterinarian and Dr. Adams&#x27; partner in the clinic.

<text>The Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 is a mid-engine sports car designed and developed in Germany by the Volkswagen Group and Bugatti, and manufactured in Molsheim, France by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti. It was named after the racing driver Pierre Veyron.

The original version has a top speed of . It was named the 2000s Car of the Decade by the BBC television programme &quot;Top Gear&quot;. The standard Veyron also won &quot;Top Gear&quot;″s Best Car Driven All Year award in 2005.

The Super Sport version of the Veyron is one of the fastest street-legal production cars in the world, with a top speed of . The Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse was the fastest roadster in the world, reaching an averaged top speed of in a test on 6 April 2013. The production car speed record was later taken by another Bugatti, the Chiron, and then often changed hands for a while.

The Veyron&#x27;s chief designer was Hartmut Warkuß, with the exterior being designed by Jozef Kabaň of Volkswagen. Much of the engineering work was conducted under the guidance of chief technical officer Wolfgang Schreiber. The Veyron includes a sound system designed and built by Burmester Audiosysteme.

Several special variants have been produced. In December 2010, Bugatti began offering prospective buyers the ability to customise exterior and interior colours by using the &quot;Veyron 16.4 Configurator&quot; application on the marque&#x27;s official website. The Bugatti Veyron was discontinued in late 2014, but special edition models continued to be produced until 2015.


== Origins ==

In May 1998, Volkswagen AG acquired the rights to use the Bugatti logo and the trade name Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. To succeed the EB 110 model produced under the previous ownership, the automaker quickly released a series of concept cars whose technological advancements would culminate in the form of the Veyron 16.4.

Between October 1998 and September 1999, Bugatti introduced a series of Giugiaro-designed concept vehicles, each with permanent four-wheel drive and powered by the Volkswagen-designed W18 engine. The first car, the EB 118, was a 2-door luxury coupé presented at the 1998 Paris Motor Show. The next car, the EB 218, was a 4-door saloon presented at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show. The third and final car, the 18/3 Chiron, was a mid-engine sports car presented at the 1999 International Motor Show in Frankfurt.

In October 1999, Bugatti unveiled a fourth concept car at the Tokyo Motor Show. The EB 18/4 Veyron was a mid-engine sports car styled in-house under the direction of Hartmut Warkuß. In 2000, a modified version, the EB 16/4 Veyron, was displayed at motor shows in Detroit, Geneva, and Paris. Rather than the three-bank W18 engine of the four previous concept cars, the EB 16/4 featured the four-bank WR16 engine architecture installed in every production example of the Veyron. Warkuß also commissioned SEAT head of design, Walter de Silva, to submit a design proposal for the new Bugatti. The design was ultimately rejected in favour of Warkuß&#x27;s own proposal.

The decision to start production of the car was made by the Volkswagen Group in 2001. The first roadworthy prototype was completed in August 2003. It is identical to the later series variant, except for a few details. In the transition from development to series production, considerable technical problems had to be addressed, repeatedly delaying production until September 2005.
The Veyron EB 16.4 is named in honor of Pierre Veyron, a Bugatti development engineer, test driver and company race driver who, with co-driver Jean-Pierre Wimille, won the 1939 24 Hours of Le Mans while driving a Bugatti. The &quot;EB&quot; refers to Bugatti founder Ettore Bugatti and the &quot;16.4&quot; refers to the engine&#x27;s 16 cylinders and quad-turbochargers.

== Bugatti Veyron (2005–2011) ==
=== Specifications and performance ===
The Veyron features an 8.0-litre, quad-turbocharged, W16 cylinder engine, equivalent to two narrow-angle V8 engines bolted together. Each cylinder has four valves for a total of 64, but the configuration of each bank allows two overhead camshafts to drive two banks of cylinders so only four camshafts are needed. The engine is fed by four turbochargers and displaces , with a square bore and stroke.

The transmission is a dual-clutch direct-shift computer-controlled automatic transmission having seven gear ratios, with magnesium paddles behind the steering wheel and a shift time of less than 150 milliseconds, built by Ricardo of England rather than Borg-Warner, who designed the six speed DSG used in the mainstream Volkswagen Group marques. The Veyron can be driven in either semi-automatic or fully-automatic mode. A replacement transmission for the Veyron costs just over . It also has permanent all-wheel drive using the Haldex Traction system. It uses special Michelin PAX run-flat tyres, designed specifically to accommodate the Veyron&#x27;s top speed, and cost per set. The tyres can be mounted on the wheels only in France, a service which costs . Kerb weight is . This gives the car a power-to-weight ratio, according to Volkswagen Group&#x27;s figures, of per ton.
The car&#x27;s wheelbase is . Overall length is which gives of overhang. The width is and height . The Bugatti Veyron has a total of ten radiators:
*3 air-to-liquid intercooler loop radiators
*3 engine water-cooling radiators
*1 air conditioning condenser
*1 transmission oil radiator
*1 differential oil radiator
*1 engine oil radiator

It has a (normal condition) and (after lowering to the ground), and a frontal area of . This gives it a drag area, the product of drag coefficient and frontal area, of .

=== Engine power output ===
According to Volkswagen Group and certified by TÜV Süddeutschland, the W16 engine utilised by the Veyron has a power output of , and generates of torque.

=== Top speed ===
German inspection officials recorded an average top speed of the original version at during test sessions on Volkswagen Group&#x27;s private Ehra-Lessien test track on 19 April 2005.

This top speed was almost matched by James May on &quot;Top Gear&quot; in November 2006, at the Ehra-Lessien test track, at . May noted that at top speed the engine consumes of air per minute (as much as a human breathes in four days). Back in the &quot;Top Gear&quot; studio, co-presenter Jeremy Clarkson commented that most sports cars felt like they were shaking apart at their top speed, and asked May if that was the case with the Veyron at . May responded that the Veyron was very controlled, and only wobbled slightly when the air brake deployed.

In regular use, the ability to reach the above absolute top speed is locked out. The car&#x27;s normal top speed is listed as . Also, when the car reaches , hydraulics lower the car until it has a ground clearance of about . At the same time, the wing and spoiler deploy. In this &quot;handling mode&quot;, the wing provides of downforce, holding the car to the road.

To reach the car&#x27;s absolute top speed, its &quot;top speed mode&quot; must be entered while the vehicle is at rest. For this, the driver must use a special top speed key in a keyhole to the left of their seat, which triggers a checklist to establish whether the car and its driver are ready to attempt to reach . If so, the rear spoiler retracts, the front air diffusers shut, and normal ground clearance drops to .

=== Braking ===
The Veyron&#x27;s brakes use cross drilled, radially vented carbon fibre reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composite discs, manufactured by SGL Carbon, which have less brake fade and weigh less than standard cast iron discs. The lightweight aluminium alloy monobloc brake calipers are made by AP Racing; the front have eight titanium pistons and the rear calipers have six pistons. Bugatti claims maximum deceleration of 1.3 g on road tyres. As an added safety feature, in the event of brake failure, an anti-lock braking system (ABS) has also been installed on the handbrake.

Prototypes have been subjected to repeated 1.0 g braking from to without fade. With the car&#x27;s acceleration from to , that test can be performed every 22 seconds. At speeds above , the rear wing also acts as an airbrake, snapping to a 55° angle in 0.4 seconds once brakes are applied, providing an additional 0.68 g (6.66 m/s2) of deceleration (equivalent to the stopping power of an ordinary hatchback). Bugatti claims the Veyron will brake from to a standstill in less than 10 seconds, though distance covered in this time will be half a kilometre (third of a mile).

=== Special editions ===

== Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport (2009–2015) ==
The targa top version of the Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4, dubbed the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport, was unveiled at the 2008 Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance. It has extensive reinforcements to compensate for the lack of a standard roof and small changes to the windshield and running lights. Two removable tops are included, the second a temporary arrangement fashioned after an umbrella. The top speed with the hardtop in place is the same as the standard coupé version, but with the roof removed is limited to —and to with the temporary soft roof. The Grand Sport edition was limited to 150 units, with the first 50 going exclusively to registered Bugatti customers. Production began in the second quarter of 2009.

=== Special editions ===


== Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport, World Record Edition (2010–2011) ==
The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport is a faster, more powerful version of the Bugatti Veyron 16.4. Production was limited to 48 units. The Super Sport has increased engine power output of at 6,400 rpm and a maximum torque of at 3,000–5,000 rpm and a revised aerodynamic package. The Super Sport has been driven as fast as , making it the fastest production road car in the world at the time of its introduction although it is electronically limited to to protect the tyres from disintegrating.

The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport World Record Edition is a version of the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport. It is limited to five units. It has an orange body detailing, orange wheels, and a special black exposed carbon body. The electronic limiter is also removed with this version.

The model was unveiled in 2010 at The Quail, followed by the 2010 Monterey Historic Races at Laguna Seca, and the 2010 Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance.

=== Top Speed World Record ===
On 4 July 2010, James May, a television presenter on BBC Two&#x27;s television show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, drove the Veyron Super Sport on Volkswagen&#x27;s Ehra-Lessien (near Wolfsburg, Germany) high-speed test track at . Later that day, Bugatti&#x27;s official test driver Pierre Henri Raphanel drove the Super Sport version of the Veyron at the same track to establish the car&#x27;s top speed. With representatives of the Guinness Book of Records and German Technical Inspection Agency (TÜV) on hand, Raphanel made passes around the big oval in both directions achieving an average maximum speed of , thus taking back the title from the SSC Ultimate Aero TT as the fastest production vehicle of all time. The mark was reached by averaging the Super Sport&#x27;s two test runs, the first reaching and the second .

When the record was certified it was already well known to the public that the customer car would be electronically limited to . Yet, after a query by the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Guinness&#x27; PR director Jaime Strang was quoted on 5 April 2013: &quot;As the car&#x27;s speed limiter was deactivated, this modification was against the official guidelines. Consequently, the vehicle&#x27;s record set at 431.072 km/h is no longer valid.&quot; On 10 April 2013, it was written on its website: &quot;Guinness World Records would like to confirm that Bugatti&#x27;s record has not been disqualified; the record category is currently under review.&quot;

On 15 April 2013, Bugatti&#x27;s speed record was confirmed: &quot;Following a thorough review conducted with a number of external experts, Guinness World Records is pleased to announce the confirmation of Bugatti&#x27;s record of Fastest production car achieved by the Veyron 16.4 SuperSport. The focus of the review was with respect to what may constitute a modification to a car&#x27;s standard specification. Having evaluated all the necessary information, Guinness World Records is now satisfied that a change to the speed limiter does not alter the fundamental design of the car or its engine.&quot;
== Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse (2012–2015) ==
The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse is a targa top version of the Veyron Super Sport. The engine in the Vitesse variant has a maximum power output of at 6,400 rpm and a maximum torque of at 3,000–5,000 rpm. These figures allow the car to accelerate from a stand still to in 2.6 seconds. On normal roads, the Vitesse is electronically limited to .

The Vitesse was first unveiled at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show and later at the 2012 Beijing Auto Show and the 2012 São Paulo Motor Show.

=== Special editions ===
A number of special editions of the Vitesse were made:

* The World Record Car (WRC) Edition was limited to 8 units, debuted in 2013, and went on sale for .
In 2013, Bugatti produced a series of Vitesse dedicated to racing legends, including Jean-Pierre Wimille, Jean Bugatti, Meo Costantini, and Ettore Bugatti.

All six models in the Legend series are limited to three vehicles:
=== Records ===
A Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse driven by the Chinese racing driver Anthony Liu at Volkswagen Group&#x27;s proving grounds in Ehra-Lessien became the fastest open-top production sports car, with a top speed of .

After the world record attempt, Dr. Wolfgang Schreiber, President of Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S, said &quot;When we introduced the Vitesse, we established the top speed for open-top driving to be 375 km/h. Still, we could not let go of the idea of reaching the 400 km/h mark with this car as well. The fact that we have succeeded in reaching 408.84 km/h is a thrill for me, and it reaffirms once again that Bugatti is the leader when it comes to technology in the international automotive industry.&quot; The driver, Anthony Liu, claimed &quot;Even at such high speeds it remained incredibly comfortable and stable. With an open-top, you can really experience the sound of the engine and yet even at higher speeds I did not get compromised by the wind at all.&quot;

The Linea Vincero has new wheel rims and new exterior lower bodywork. It extensively uses carbon fibre in the interior and exterior as well.

This car, with its interior and exterior customisations, is worth US$1 million more than a standard Veyron 16.4.

=== Bugatti Veyron Linea D&#x27;oro ===
The Bugatti Veyron Linea D&#x27;oro is a car made on the basis of the Veyron Grand Sport and the 16.4 by the German car modification firm Mansory.

The D&#x27;oro&#x27;s exterior design is identical to its predecessor&#x27;s but it has a few differences such as the gold paint on the badge, rims and other features. The iconic V-shaped badge is also present on this car&#x27;s front grille.

=== Bugatti Veyron Linea Viviere ===

The Bugatti Veyron Linea Viviere (commonly known as the Mansory Viviere) is a car made on the basis of the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport by the German car modification firm Mansory.

This car&#x27;s exterior design features the iconic V-shaped front grille and an additional exhaust system below its rear lights. The interior has been handcrafted and carbon fibre has been extensively used.

This car has a second generation known as the Viviere Diamond Edition which has been made on the same basis. This car is the final Veyron Edition tuned by Mansory and has a marble coloured exterior paintwork.

The Bugatti Veyron Linea Viviere costs US$2.3 million, making it one of the most expensive Veyrons ever produced.

== Production ==
, 405 cars had been produced and delivered to customers worldwide, with orders that have already been placed for another 30. Bugatti was reported to produce 300 coupés and 150 roadsters up to the end of 2015. Production amounted to 450 units in a span of over 10 years. The final production vehicle, a Grand Sport Vitesse titled &quot;La Finale&quot; (The Last One), was displayed at the Geneva Motor Show from 5–15 March 2015.

== Future development ==
In 2008, Bugatti then-CEO Dr Franz-Josef Paefgen confirmed that the Veyron would be replaced by another high-end model by 2012. In 2011, the new CEO Wolfgang Dürheimer revealed that the company was planning to produce two models in the future — one a sports car-successor to the Veyron, the other a limousine known as the Bugatti 16C Galibier, which was later cancelled since Bugatti was later then working on a successor to the Veyron, which became the Bugatti Chiron.

The successor to the Veyron was unveiled in concept form as the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo at the September 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show.

A toned-down version of the radically styled Vision Gran Turismo concept car, now called the Chiron, debuted at the March 2016 Geneva Motor Show. Production started in 2017 and will be limited to 500 units.

== Sales ==

# The last Veyron, No. 450 was sold in May 2014.
== Reception ==

=== &quot;Top Gear&quot; ===
All three former presenters of the popular BBC motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot; have given the Veyron considerable praise. While initially skeptical that the Veyron would ever be produced, Jeremy Clarkson later declared the Veyron &quot;the greatest car ever made and the greatest car we will ever see in our lifetime&quot;, comparing it to Concorde and S.S. &quot;Great Britain&quot;. He noted that the production cost of a Veyron was , but was sold to customers for just . Volkswagen designed the car merely as a technical exercise. James May described the Veyron as &quot;our Concorde moment&quot;. Clarkson test drove the Veyron from Alba in northern Italy to London in a race against May and Richard Hammond who made the journey in a Cessna 182 aeroplane.

A few episodes later, May drove the Veyron at the VW test track and took it to its top speed of . In series 10, Hammond raced the Veyron against the Eurofighter Typhoon and lost. He also raced the car in Series 13 against a McLaren F1 driven by The Stig in a one-mile (1.6 km) drag race in Abu Dhabi. The commentary focused on Bugatti&#x27;s &quot;amazing technical achievement&quot; versus the &quot;non-gizmo&quot; racing purity of the F1. While the F1 was quicker off the line and remained ahead until both cars were travelling at approximately , the Bugatti overtook its competitor from and emerged the victor. Hammond has stated that he did not use the Veyron&#x27;s launch control in order to make the race more interesting.

The Veyron also won the award for &quot;Car of the Decade&quot; in &quot;Top Gear&quot; end of 2010 award show. Clarkson commented, &quot;It was a car that just rewrote the rule book really, an amazing piece of engineering, a genuine Concorde moment&quot;. When the standard version was tested in 2008, it did not reach the top of the lap time leader board, with a time of 1:18.3, which was speculated as being due to the car&#x27;s considerable weight disadvantage against the other cars towards the top. In 2010 the Super Sport version achieved the fastest ever time of 1:16.8 (dethroned the Gumpert Apollo S, replaced by the Ariel Atom V8 in 2011), as well as being taken to a verified average top speed of by Raphanel on the programme, thenceforth retaking its position as the fastest production car in the world.
=== Martin Roach ===
In 2011, Martin Roach&#x27;s book &quot;Bugatti Veyron: A Quest for Perfection – The Story of the Greatest Car in the World&quot; took the stance that the car had now become so famous that it is effectively a bona fide celebrity. The book follows its author as he attempts to track down and drive the car, along the way interviewing chief designers, test drivers, and the president of Bugatti.

=== Gordon Murray ===
During its development period McLaren F1 designer Gordon Murray said in UK auto magazine &quot;Evo&quot;: &quot;The most pointless exercise on the planet has got to be this four-wheel-drive, thousand-horsepower Bugatti.&quot; But after driving it he called it &quot;a huge achievement&quot;.

Murray was impressed with the Veyron&#x27;s engine and transmission after he test drove one for &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine. He also praised its styling: &quot;The styling is a wonderful mélange of classic curves and mechanical edges and elements — this should ensure that the car will still look good years from now, and therefore have a chance of becoming a future classic.&quot;

<text>The Bugatti EB 118 is the first concept car developed by Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. The 2-door coupé was presented at the 1998 Paris Motor Show. Bugatti commissioned the design of the EB 118 from Giorgetto Giugiaro of Italdesign. The EB 118 is powered by a W18 engine and has permanent four wheel drive.

==Design==

The design of the car is intended to echo the 1931 Type 50 and the 57SC Atlantic. The EB 118 has a longitudinal rib that echoes the Atlantic&#x27;s longitudinal body seam.

==Debut==
Bugatti introduced the EB 118 at the 1998 Paris Auto Show. After its Paris debut, Bugatti displayed the EB 118 along with its four-door counterpart the EB 218 at the Geneva Auto Show and the Tokyo Motor Show in 1999. The design was already production ready, but Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. decided that they wanted to focus on a sports car based on the 18/3 Chiron concept car introduced in 1999, so that the EB 118 stayed a concept car and never made it into production.

==Powertrain==
Power comes from a Volkswagen-designed W18 engine which produces and of torque. The EB 118 W18 engine has of three banks of six cylinders with a sixty degree offset between each cylinder bank. The EB 118 also features permanent four wheel drive taken from the Lamborghini Diablo VT.

This same powertrain was later used in both the 1999 EB 218 and 1999 18/3 Chiron cars.

<doc id="874346" wikidata="Q2663158" url="?curid=874346" title="Forensic accounting">
<text>Forensic accounting, forensic accountancy or financial forensics is the specialty practice area of accounting that investigates whether firms engage in financial reporting misconduct, or financial misconduct within the workplace by employees, officers or directors of the organization. Forensic accountants apply a range of skills and methods to determine whether there has been financial misconduct by the firm or its employees.

== History ==
Forensic accounting was not formally defined until the 1940s. Originally Frank Wilson is credited with the birth of forensic accounting in the 1930s.
When Wilson was working as a CPA for the US Internal Revenue Service, he was assigned to investigate the transactions of the infamous gangster Al Capone. Capone was known for his involvement in illegal activities, including violent crimes. However it was Capone&#x27;s federal income tax fraud that was discovered by forensic accountants. Wilson&#x27;s diligent analysis of the financial records of Al Capone indicted him for federal income tax evasion. Capone owed the government $215,080.48 from illegal gambling profits and was guilty of tax evasion for which he was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. This case established the significance of forensic accounting.

== Application area ==
Forensic accountants are necessary for a variety of reasons. They can be useful for criminal investigations, litigation support, insurance claims, and corporate investigations. 

Financial forensic engagements may fall into several categories. For example:
* Economic damages calculations, whether suffered through tort or breach of contract;
* Post-acquisition disputes such as earnouts or breaches of warranties;
* Bankruptcy, insolvency, and reorganization;
* Divorce settlement
* Securities fraud;
* Tax fraud;
* Money laundering;
* Business valuation; 
* Credit card fraud; 
* Skimming; 
* Computer forensics/e-discovery; and
* Fraud risk assessments under SOX 404 or otherwise.

==Forensic accountants==

Forensic accountants, investigative accountants or expert accountants may be involved in recovering proceeds of serious crime, and provide evidence to confiscation proceedings concerning actual or assumed proceeds of crime or money laundering. In the United Kingdom, relevant legislation is contained in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Forensic accountants typically hold the following qualifications; Certified Forensic Accounting Professional [Certified Forensic Auditors] (CFA - England &amp; Wales) granted by the Forensic Auditors Certification Board of England and Wales (FACB), Certified Fraud Examiners (CFE - US / International), Certificate Course on Forensic Accounting and Fraud Detection (FAFD) by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), Certified Public Accountants (CPA - US) with AICPA&#x27;s [Certified in Financial Forensics est. 2008] (CFF) Credentials, Chartered Accountants (CA - Canada), Certified Management Accountants (CMA - Canada), Chartered Professional Accountants (CPA - Canada), Chartered Certified Accountants (CCA - UK), or Certified Forensic Investigation Professionals (CFIP). In India there is a separate breed of forensic accountants called Certified Forensic Accounting Professionals.

The Certified Forensic Accountant (CRFAC) program from the American Board of Forensic Accounting assesses Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) knowledge and competence in professional forensic accounting services in a multitude of areas. Forensic accountants may be involved in both litigation support (providing assistance on a given case, primarily related to the calculation or estimation of economic damages and related issues) and investigative accounting (looking into illegal activities). The American Board of Forensic Accounting was established in 1993.

Large accounting firms often have a forensic accounting department. All of the larger accounting firms, as well as many medium-sized and boutique firms and various police and government agencies have specialist forensic accounting departments. Within these groups, there may be further sub-specializations: some forensic accountants may, for example, specialize in insurance claims, personal injury claims, fraud, anti-money-laundering, construction, or royalty audits. Forensic accounting used in large companies is sometimes called financial forensics.

The role of the forensic accountants differ from what auditors do. Forensic accountants are involved with investigating and analyzing the factual information brought about by the crime, whereas auditors handle the gross financial statements. Auditors detect financial deficiencies that need to be corrected, and they give suggestions to investors, based on their professional opinion, on the reliance of financial statements. Forensic accountants examine evidence of criminal offences and through this evidence, make efforts to improve the processes adopted by those affected. Though audits and forensic accounting investigations have their differences, they share a couple similarities; both require knowledge of the practices and processes possessed by the business and the general accounting principles concerned with the particular situation, and they both require the ability to interpret financial documents and be objective and impartial. 

Forensic accountants combine knowledge of the law with their accounting skills.  They can assess companies, and help companies resolve issues.  This can help companies prevent corruption, fraud, embezzlement, etc. As with all accounting professionals, forensic accountants performing an audit of a company should remain neutral.  Large companies mainly use forensic accountants when performing audits; however, there are other uses for forensic accountants in companies. Forensic accountants often assist in professional negligence claims where they are assessing and commenting on the work of other professionals. Forensic accountants are also engaged in marital and family law, analyzing lifestyle for spousal support purposes, determining income available for child support, and equitable distribution of marital assets.

Forensic accounting and fraud investigation methodologies are different than internal auditing. Thus forensic accounting services and practice should be handled by forensic accounting experts, not by internal auditing experts. Forensic accountants may appear on the crime scene a little later than fraud auditors; their major contribution is in translating complex financial transactions and numerical data into terms that ordinary laypersons can understand, because if the fraud comes to trial, the jury will be made up of ordinary laypersons. On the other hand, internal auditors investigate using checklists and techniques that may not surface the types of evidence that the jury or regulatory bodies look for in proving fraud. Forensic investigation fieldwork may carry legal risks and consultant malpractice risks if internal auditing checklists are used, rather than the specialized skills of forensic accounting.

The fraud cycle describes the process which is taken by those in order to conduct a fraud. It begins with planning the actions of the fraud, which is then followed by the actual commitment of the act, ending with the conversion of the assets to cash. The main goal of Forensic accountants is to determine whether financial crime has been committed, and if so, to what extent. They are often used as expert witnesses to assist the judge or jury in forming the verdict. It is important that forensic accountants possess skills such as microeconomics, cost-center accounting systems, coming up with conclusions with little data, report writing, research skills and interview skills.

This process can employ one or more of the following techniques: review of Public records; background investigations; interviews of knowledgeable parties; analysis of Real evidence to identify possible Forgery and/or document alterations; Surveillance and inspection of business premises; analysis of individual Financial transactions or statements; review of Business records to identify fictitious vendors, employees, and/or business activities, or interrogation of suspects, questioning of witnesses or victims.

Forensic accountants are also increasingly playing more proactive risk reduction roles by designing and performing extended procedures as part of the statutory audit, acting as advisers to audit committees, fraud deterrence engagements, and assisting in investment analyst research.

== Methods ==
Forensic accounting combines the work of an auditor and a public or private investigator. Unlike auditors whose goal is focused on finding and preventing errors, the role of a forensic accountant is to detect instances of fraud, as well as identify the suspected perpetrator of the fraud. Some of the most common types of fraud schemes include overstating revenues, understating liabilities, inventory manipulation, asset misappropriation, and bribery/corruption. To discover these, forensic accountants apply a variety of techniques.

Forensic accounting methods can be classified into quantitative and qualitative. The qualitative approach studies the personal characteristics of the individuals behind financial fraud schemes. A popular theory of fraud revolves around the fraud triangle, which classifies the three elements of fraud as perceived opportunity, perceived need (pressures), and rationalization. This theoretical construct was first articulated by behavioral scientist Donald Cressey. More recently, forensic accountants have gone beyond incentive effects and focused on behavioral characteristics, a branch of accounting known as accounting, behavior and organizations, or organizational behavior. Certain predictive factors, like being labeled as “narcissistic” or committing adultery, are common traits among fraud perpetrators. These characteristics are often not conclusive enough on their own to identify the culprit, but can help forensic accountants to narrow down a suspect list, sometimes based on behavioral or demographic factors.

The quantitative approach focuses on financial data information and searches for abnormalities or patterns predictive of misconduct. Today, forensic accountants work closely with data analytics to dig through complex financial records. Data collection is an important aspect of forensic accounting because proper analysis requires data that is sufficient and reliable. Once a forensic accountant has access to the relevant data, analytic techniques are applied. Predictive modeling can detect potentially fraudulent activities, entity resolution algorithms and social network analytics can identify hidden relationships, and text mining allows forensic accountants to parse through large amounts of unstructured data quickly. Another common quantitative forensic accounting method is the application of Benford&#x27;s law. Benford&#x27;s law predicts patterns in an observed set of accounting data, and the more the data deviates from the pattern, the more likely that the data has been manipulated and falsified.

== Analytical techniques ==
Forensic accountants utilize an understanding of economic theories, business information, financial reporting systems, accounting and auditing standards and procedures, data management &amp; electronic discovery, data analysis techniques for fraud detection, evidence gathering and investigative techniques, and litigation processes and procedures to perform their work.

When detecting fraud in public organizations accountants will look in areas such as billing, corruption, cash and non-cash asset misappropriation, refunds and issues in the payroll department. To detect fraud, companies may undergo management reviews, audits (both internally and externally) and inspection of documents. Forensic accountants will often try to prevent fraud before it happens but searching for errors and in-precise operations as well as poorly documented transactions.

The process begins with the forensic accountant gathering as much information as possible from clients, suppliers, stakeholders and anyone else involved in the company. Next, they will analyze financial statements in order to try and find errors or mistakes in the reporting of those financial statements as well as they will analyze any background information provided. The next step involves interviewing employees in order to try and find where the fraud may be occurring. Investigators will look at company values, performance reviews, management styles and the overall structure of the company. After this is complete the forensic accountant will try to draw conclusions from their findings.

<text>A V18 engine is an eighteen-cylinder piston engine where two banks of nine cylinders are arranged in a V configuration around a common crankshaft.

The V18 engine is a rare configuration and is primarily used in large diesel engines running at low operating speeds. These large V18 diesel engines have seen limited use in haul trucks, electricity generation, rail transport, and marine propulsion. 

There are no known automobiles that have used V18 engines and no engine manufacturer has developed or produced a V18 engine for use in automobiles.

While the V18 is a more uncommon engine configuration, there are more common eighteen-cylinder engine configurations such as the W18, which has seen use in both automobiles and aircraft, and the Deltic, an opposed-piston eighteen-cylinder diesel engine created by D. Napier &amp; Son which was used for a variety of applications.

== Examples ==
The BelAZ 75600 and Liebherr T 282B haul trucks are powered by the &quot;Cummins QSK78&quot; engine, while the Komatsu 960E-1 haul truck is powered by the &quot;Komatsu SSDA18V170&quot; engine.

In 1971, the Canadian locomotive manufacturer MLW-Worthington produced the &quot;MLW M640&quot; prototype diesel-electric locomotive powered by a ALCO 18-251 engine, however the locomotive did not reach production.

<doc id="874353" wikidata="Q134230" url="?curid=874353" title="Shuvuuia">
<text>Shuvuuia is a genus of bird-like theropod dinosaur from the late Cretaceous period of Mongolia. It is a member of the family Alvarezsauridae, small coelurosaurian dinosaurs which are characterized by short but powerful forelimbs specialized for digging. The type (and only known) species is &quot;Shuvuuia deserti&quot;, or &quot;desert bird&quot;. The name &quot;Shuvuuia&quot; is derived from the Mongolian word &quot;shuvuu&quot; (шувуу) meaning &quot;bird&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Shuvuuia&quot; was a small and lightly built animal. At in length and in body mass, it is one of the smallest known non-avian dinosaurs. The skull is lightly built with long and slender jaws and minute teeth. &quot;Shuvuuia&quot; is unique among non-avian theropods in the skull&#x27;s ability to perform prokinesis; that is, it could flex its upper jaw independently of its braincase.

The hindlimbs of &quot;Shuvuuia&quot; were long, slender, and short-toed, which may indicate significant running capabilities. The forelimbs, however, were unusually short and powerfully constructed. Although originally &quot;Shuvuuia&quot; and other alvarezsaurids were thought to have only a single digit on the front limb, newer specimens show the presence of reduced second and third fingers in addition to the massively enlarged thumb known from previous specimens.

Fossils of &quot;Shuvuuia&quot; are currently known from two locations within the Djadochta Formation: Ukhaa Tolgod and Tögrögiin Shiree. These sites are thought to be about 75 million years old (late Campanian age). Contemporary genera included &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and &quot;Protoceratops&quot;.

==Paleobiology==
===Nocturnal adaptations and diet===

Like other alvarezsaurids, &quot;Shuvuuia&quot; may have used its forelimbs to open insect nests, and its slender, unusually mobile jaws to probe after such prey. However, new research based on analysis of the theropod&#x27;s ears suggests that it was actually an owl-like, nocturnal hunter which used its strong legs to run down prey, and its arms to dig small prey such as insects and mammals out of burrows and shrubs; its lagena is about the same size as that of barn owls, giving it superb hearing in addition to its fantastic night vision (analyzed by looking at its scleral ring) allowing it to potentially hunt in complete darkness, unlike other theropods to which it has been compared, such as the apparently diurnal &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; and &quot;Alioramus&quot;.

===Feathers===
Specimen IGM 100/977 of &quot;Shuvuuia&quot; was found surrounded by small, hollow, tube-like structures resembling the rachis (central vane) of modern bird feathers. Though highly deteriorated and poorly preserved, biochemical analyses later showed that these structures contain decay products of the protein beta-keratin, and more significantly, the &quot;absence&quot; of alpha-keratin. While beta-keratin is found in all integumentary (skin and feather) cells of reptiles and birds, only bird feathers completely lack alpha-keratin. These findings show that, though poorly preserved, &quot;Shuvuuia&quot; likely possessed a coat of feathers.

<doc id="874356" wikidata="Q898955" url="?curid=874356" title="Miklós Horthy Jr.">
<text>Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya II (; ; 14 February 1907 – 28 March 1993) was the younger son of Hungarian regent Admiral Miklós Horthy and, until the end of World War II, a politician.

==Biography==
In his youth, Miklós Horthy Jr. and his older brother, István, were active members of a Roman Catholic Scout troop of the Hungarian Scout Association (&quot;Magyar Cserkészszövetség&quot;), although they were both Protestant.

For a time, Miklós Jr. was the Hungarian ambassador to Brazil.

After the death of István in 1942, Miklós Jr. became more powerful in his father&#x27;s government and supported his efforts to end the involvement of the Kingdom of Hungary with the Axis Powers. But on October 15, 1944, Nazi Germany launched Operation Panzerfaust. As part of this operation, Miklós Jr. was kidnapped by German commandos led by Otto Skorzeny, and threatened with death unless his father surrendered and agreed to appoint the Arrow Cross Party as the new government. His father complied, and Horthy Jr. survived the war (he became the only one of Horthy’s four children to outlive their father). 

While his father was placed under house arrest in Bavaria, the younger Miklós was sent to the Dachau concentration camp. Late in April 1945, Miklós Jr. was taken to Tyrol with other prominent inmates of Dachau. There the SS abandoned their prisoners as Allied forces advanced. The younger Miklós Horthy was liberated by the Fifth U.S. Army on May 5, 1945.

Father and son went into exile in Portugal, where Miklós Horthy Jr. lived almost fifty years before dying at Estoril, near Lisbon, in 1993. He had two daughters with his first wife Countess Mária Consueló Károlyi (1905–1976), Zsófia Horthy (1928–2004, Mrs Henry Freytag, then Mrs Charles Filliettaz) and Nicolette Horthy (1929–1990, Baroness Georg Bachofen von Echt). He was also a founding partner of Hovione, a Portuguese pharmaceutical company.

<doc id="874359" wikidata="Q1335543" url="?curid=874359" title="Emerson Drive">
<text>Emerson Drive was a Canadian country music band consisting of Brad Mates (lead vocals), Danick Dupelle (guitars, backing vocals), Mike Melancon (drums), and Dale Wallace (keyboards, backing vocals). The band was founded in 1995 as 12 Gauge, which consisted of Mates, Pat Allingham (fiddle), Steven Swager (bass guitar), Chris Hartman (keyboards), Dan Binns (guitar), David Switzer (guitar), and Remi Barre (drums); Swager was replaced with Jeff Loberg early on. After recording under this name, the band moved to the United States in 1999 and renamed themselves to Emerson Drive. They released two albums for the former DreamWorks Records Nashville branch: &quot;Emerson Drive&quot; in 2002 and &quot;What If?&quot; in 2004. These accounted for their first hit singles in the United States: &quot;I Should Be Sleeping&quot;, &quot;Fall into Me&quot;, and &quot;Last One Standing&quot;. After DreamWorks closed, Emerson Drive signed with Midas Records Nashville for the 2006 album &quot;Countrified&quot;, which produced their only American number-one single in &quot;Moments&quot;. Further releases in the United States were unsuccessful; however, the band continued to chart in Canada through releases on Open Road Recordings and Big Star Recordings over the next ten years.

==History==

===12 Gauge, &quot;Until You Walk the Tracks&quot; – 1995–1998===
Emerson Drive was formed under the name of 12 Gauge in February 1995 when Brad Mates entered a talent contest at his local high school in Grande Prairie, Alberta. Through the contest, Mates met fiddler Pat Allingham, bass player Steven Swager and keyboardist Chris Hartman. Mates, Hartman, Swager and Allingham decided to form a band with guitarists Dan Binns and David Switzer, bass guitarist Jeff Loberg, and drummer Remi Barre. The band started practicing in Mates&#x27; basement and entering contests. In 1996, the group entered a local Battle of the Bands contest and won the opportunity to write and record their EP &quot;Open Season&quot;.

In 1996, 12 Gauge began work on their first studio album and independently released, &quot;Until You Walk the Tracks&quot; in 1997. Through 1997 and 1998, the group toured Canada to support their album and charted two songs, including the top 40 single, &quot;Some Trains Never Come&quot;, which peaked at No. 36 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Country Tracks chart in 1998. Both singles were accompanied by music videos that received airplay on CMT Canada. In early 1998, the group received a nomination for Top New Group or Duo at the RPM Big Country Awards, but lost to Montana Sky.

By this time, Switzer had left the group and drummer Remi Barre had been replaced by Derrick Kuzemchuk. Soon after the release, Binns left the group. He was replaced by Dan Bauman, who stayed with the band for just over a year. By the end of 1998, Binns and Kuzemchuk left the group. Shortly after, the band hired Gerry Leiske as their manager, replacing previous manager Lionel Allingham (Pat&#x27;s father). Leiske introduced the band to guitarist Danick Dupelle, who had been performing with Canadian country trio Farmer&#x27;s Daughter, which Leiske also managed. Drummer Mike Melancon replaced Kuzemchuk.

===Name Change, Nashville &amp; &quot;Emerson Drive&quot; – 1999–2002===
In 1999, the band moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in search of a record deal. In the process, they discovered that &#x27;12 Gauge&#x27; was also the name of an American rapper and had to choose a new name; Emerson Drive is named for the Emerson Trail that crosses Western Alberta and joins the Alaska Highway.

The group caught the attention of executives at DreamWorks Records subsidiary DreamWorks Nashville, who signed the group to a record deal in 2000. Emerson Drive&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Emerson Drive&quot;, was scheduled to be released in January 2002, but was delayed when DreamWorks executives found two new songs and brought in singer-songwriter Richard Marx to produce. The album was released in May 2002; it ranked No. 67 on the Billboard Top Country Album charts for 2003.

Emerson Drive&#x27;s debut American single, &quot;I Should Be Sleeping&quot;, was released in November 2001. The song became a hit for the group on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Single &amp; Tracks chart in 2002, peaking at No. 4 and finishing the year at No. 22. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Fall into Me&quot;, one of the two new songs Marx produced, was issued in late 2002. It peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart in 2003, settling at No. 36 at year end. In Canada, it charted at No. 35 in 2002 and No. 32 in 2003, while &quot;I Should Be Sleeping&quot; charted at No. 40.

Reviews of &quot;Emerson Drive&quot; were favorable, and the band toured in support of it, playing several solo concerts and festivals, and opening for Keith Urban, Brad Paisley and Brooks and Dunn.

In 2002, the Academy of Country Music named Emerson Drive Top New Vocal Duo or Group, and the band won Top New Artist at the Radio &amp; Records Year-End Awards. At the Canadian Country Music Association awards, the band won Group or Duo of the Year and the Chevy Trucks Rising Star Award.

Beginning in August 2002, the band went through member changes with the departure of bassist Jeff Loberg, who exited the group to focus on his songwriting. Loberg was replaced by Patrick Bourque. In 2003, keyboardist Chris Hartman left to return to school, and was replaced by Dale Wallace; Pat Allingham left to spend more time with his family and was replaced by David Pichette.

===&quot;What If?&quot; – 2004–2005===
Emerson Drive released its second album, &quot;What If?&quot; on July 10, 2004. The album, which was also produced by Richard Marx, debuted at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Waitin&#x27; on Me&quot;, was released to Canada only in late 2003; the next single, &quot;Last One Standing&quot;, was released in Canada and the US in January 2004. Reviews of &quot;What If?&quot; were mixed but the band was signed as the opener for Shania Twain&#x27;s Up! Tour. The tour began on September 25, 2003, and ended in July 2004. During this time, the band performed twice at the Grand Ole Opry.

In 2004, DreamWorks Nashville was sold to Universal Music Group, which released two more singles from &quot;What If?&quot; in Canada, through Universal Music Canada in 2005. Universal shut down DreamWorks Nashville and Emerson Drive was dropped.

===&quot;Countrified&quot; – 2005–2006===
In late 2005, Keith Follesé and Brad Allen signed the band to their new label, Midas Records Nashville and the band began working on Emerson Drive&#x27;s third album; Alabama&#x27;s Teddy Gentry and veteran Nashville musician and songwriter Josh Leo were brought in to produce.

&quot;Countrified&quot; was released in September 2006, debuting at No. 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Songs chart. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;A Good Man,&quot; reached No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart (No. 5 in Canada) and was followed by &quot;Moments&quot;, which gave the group their first (and only) No. 1 single (No 4 in Canada). Emerson Drive became the first Canadian group to reach number one and the fifth Canadian act overall.

&quot;Moments&quot; was followed in Canada by the top-five hit &quot;Testify&quot; and in the United States by the top-25 hit &quot;You Still Own Me&quot;, a cover the 2004 Johnny Reid single.

&quot;Countrified&quot; won rave reviews. At the Juno Awards of 2007, &quot;Countrified&quot; was nominated for Country Recording of the Year and at the 42nd Academy of Country Music Awards, the band was nominated Top Vocal Group of the Year. The video for &quot;Moments&quot; won CMT Video of the Year, and at the Canadian Country Music Awards, the song won Single of the Year, and the band won Group or Duo of the Year. &quot;Moments&quot; was nominated as Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards.

===&quot;Believe&quot; – 2007–2010===
Bassist Patrick Bourque resigned from the band in August 2007 and, the following month, took his own life, at age 30. The members of Emerson Drive learned of his death while traveling to a concert in Valentine, Nebraska. In November, the band talked with CBC News saying they had known that Bourque had been unhappy, but &quot;nobody could do anything for him&quot;.

Emerson Drive toured the US in support of &quot;Believe&quot; through 2007, playing solo concerts and several festivals, including the 2007 CMA Music Festival. In October of that year, they accompanied Porter Wagoner, Trent Tomlinson, The Whites, Ricky Skaggs and Carrie Underwood in concert at the Grand Ole Opry. Producer and Alabama bassist Teddy Gentry was quoted as calling Emerson Drive “possibly the best band I’ve heard in years, as far as playing live on stage.”.

The band began recording their sixth album in 2008, with session bassists Michael Rhodes and Glenn Worf, and Arlo Gilliam as touring bassist. In November 2008, they released their first new single, &quot;Belongs to You&quot;, on Midas and new label Valory Music Group, which began to promote the band in mid-2008. The song peaked at No. 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart in March 2009, and the new album, &quot;Believe&quot; was released in May 2009, in Canada only.

In November 2008, Valory (now Big Machine Records) entered into partnership with Midas and the band signed with Open Road Recordings. As the band was embroiled in a dispute with Midas, this left them without a USA-based label and &quot;Believe&quot; was not released in the United States at the time. Despite this, the group achieved three more top ten hits in Canada with &quot;Believe,&quot; &quot;I Love This Road,&quot; and &quot;The Extra Mile&quot;.

In 2010, the band founded its own label, Amdian Records. The first single, &quot;That Kind of Beautiful&quot;, was released in Canada in June 2010 and in the United States in August.

&quot;Believe&quot; was very well received. In 2009, Emerson Drive was nominated as by the Canadian Country Music Association Awards as Group of the Year. At the Juno Awards of 2010, &quot;Believe&quot; was nominated as Country Album of the Year.

===&quot;Decade of Drive&quot; – 2011===
Open Road Recordings released the band&#x27;s greatest hits album, &quot;Decade of Drive&quot;, on February 8, 2011, in Canada. The album featured the band&#x27;s biggest hits and new previously unreleased songs. Its first single, &quot;When I See You Again&quot;, which was written as a tribute to Patrick Bourque, was released in November 2010 and peaked at No. 97. 
The second single, &quot;Let Your Love Speak&quot;, peaked at No. 89. The third single, &quot;Sleep It Off&quot;, did not chart.

In January 2011, Emerson Drive signed with Quarterback Records to release &quot;Let Your Love Speak&quot; to U.S. radio. The band began its Canadian &quot;Decade and Driving Tour&quot; on February 8, 2011.

===&quot;Roll&quot; and &quot;Tilt-a-Whirl&quot; – 2012–2015===
Emerson Drive&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Roll&quot;, was released on October 30, 2012. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;She&#x27;s My Kind of Crazy&quot;, was released to Canadian country radio on July 9, 2012. The second single, &quot;Let It Roll&quot; (with Doc Walker) was released to Canadian country radio on October 23, 2012. The third single, &quot;With You&quot; was released to Canadian country radio in March 2013. The fourth, &quot;She Always Get What She Wants&quot; was released to Canadian country radio in June 2013.

<text>The Bugatti EB 218 saloon is the second concept car presented by Bugatti under the ownership of the Volkswagen Auto Group. The EB 218 was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, who also designed the EB 112, the car&#x27;s predecessor and the EB 118, the car&#x27;s 2-door variant. The EB 218 can be considered as an update of the EB 112, a concept saloon introduced by Bugatti Automobili SpA in 1993. The EB 218 features Volkswagen&#x27;s unconventional W18 engine and permanent four-wheel drive borrowed from the Lamborghini Diablo VT.

==Design==
Bugatti commissioned Giorgetto Giugiaro of Italdesign to update the EB 112 concept that he designed for Bugatti Automobili SpA in 1993. The EB218&#x27;s wheelbase measures and it has a total length of . This makes the EB 218 longer than the EB 112 by . The most notable visual differences between the EB 218 and the EB 112 is a redesigned hood, bumpers and lights. The overall design is far less controversial than the EB 112&#x27;s &quot;Droopy hatchback-saloon&quot; design and has a much more of a typical saloon shape rather than the EB 112&#x27;s hatchback shape. The interior design is very simple yet extremely luxurious, with beige leather seats and a large wooden dashboard which manages to keep all the instruments and vents &quot;composed&quot;. The EB 218 draws inspiration from the classic Type 101 Guillore.

==Debut==
Bugatti introduced the EB 218 at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show, one year after its 2-door counterpart was introduced at the 1998 Paris Auto Show.

==Powertrain==
The EB 218 uses the same W18 engine and permanent four wheel drive powertrain that debuted in the 1998 EB 118. The same technology was used in the 1999 18/3 Chiron concept car.

Power comes from a Volkswagen-designed, and , W18 engine. This engine design was extremely unconventional due to the unusual firing order of the engine. The EB 218 W18 engine is composed of three banks of six cylinders with a sixty degree offset between each cylinder bank. In contrast, the W16 engine in Bugatti&#x27;s (Under Volkswagen ownership) first production car, the 2005 Veyron EB 16.4 features two banks of 8 cylinders, it is basically two W8 engines. The Volkswagen W16 engine is not the same as W engines from the pre war cars or the W18. The Volkswagen W16/W12/W8 engines are actually two banks of VR engines. In the case of the later Veyron they took the W12 from Bentley, which is two times VR6, chopped of 4 cylinders to make a W8 and then doubled that. Note that the W18 was actually a &quot;real&quot; W engine with 3 banks of 6 cylinders. The EB 218 has the permanent all-wheel drive taken from the Lamborghini Diablo VT sports car.

<text>István Horthy de Nagybánya (9 December 1904 – 20 August 1942) was a Hungarian politician and fighter pilot during World War II. He was briefly Vice-Regent of Hungary in 1942, and was the eldest son of Hungarian regent Miklós Horthy.

==Biography==
In his youth, István Horthy and his younger brother Miklós Jr. were active members of a Catholic Scout troop of the Magyar Cserkészszövetség (&quot;Hungarian Scout Association&quot;), even though he was a Protestant.
Horthy graduated as a mechanical engineer in 1928. He went to the United States for one year and worked in the Ford factory in Detroit, Michigan.

Returning to the Kingdom of Hungary, he worked in MÁVAG&#x27;s locomotive factory in this occupation. On the forefront of the designer team, he took part in the development of many great projects, such as the Class 424. Between 1934 and 1938, Horthy was director of the company and after 1938 he became its general manager. In 1940, he married Countess Ilona Edelsheim-Gyulai. 

István was pro-Western, and he strenuously confronted Nazism, often making his criticism public, despite Hungary being a part of the Axis. In January 1942, he had been elected Deputy Regent, and for some time, the &quot;small regent&quot; enjoyed massive popularity in Hungary. Shortly thereafter, István was sent to the Eastern Front. His humanity, and his disagreement in the &quot;Jewish question&quot; appears even here, too – a quote from one of his letters, which he sent to his father from Kyiv, Soviet Ukraine: &quot;[...] Yet another sad topic: the Jewish companies, as I hear, -there 20 or 30,000 [men]-, are at the mercy of the sadist&#x27;s passions, in every regard; the stomach of man gets ache [looking at this]; it is abhorrent, that in the 20th century, it happens at us, too... [...] I fear, we will pay for this very dearly once. (Is it possible to take them home to work there?) Otherwise, in spring, only a few will be alive. [...]&quot;

István Horthy died in a much-publicized flying accident in Russia on 20 August 1942 (18 August, according to other authors), He was then serving in the Royal Hungarian Air Force (&quot;Magyar Királyi Honvéd Légierő&quot;), MKHL, with the rank of 1/Lt, as a fighter pilot. His unit, 1/3 Fighter Squadron, was supporting the Hungarian Second Army against Soviet forces. He was flying his MÁVAG Héja I (&quot;&quot;Hawk&quot; I&quot;), &quot;V.421&quot;, a Hungarian fighter based on the Italian Reggiane Re.2000 &quot;Falco&quot; I. During his 25th operational sortie, soon after takeoff from an airfield near Ilovskoye, the other pilot flying with him asked Horthy to increase his altitude. István pulled up rapidly. His aircraft (which had become much more prone to stalls after a steel plate was added behind the cockpit of all Héja Is to protect pilots, but shifting the plane&#x27;s center of gravity) stalled and crashed. According to other sources, his aircraft entered a flat spin after he made a turn at low speed to fly in close formation with a He 46 reconnaissance aircraft. Some were convinced that the Germans had sabotaged his aircraft.

His only son, Sharif István Horthy, is a physicist and architect.

==Honors==
István Horthy was awarded the Order of Vitéz. Hungary honoured him by issuing a commemorative postage-stamp on 15 October 1942.

<text>Victoria University was an English federal university established by royal charter on 20 April 1880 at Manchester. It was the fifth university founded in England, established as a university for the North of England open to affiliation by colleges such as Owens College, which immediately did so. University College Liverpool joined the university in 1884, followed by Yorkshire College, Leeds, in 1887. The university and the colleges were distinct corporate bodies until Owens College merged with the university in 1904. A supplemental charter of 1883 enabled the granting of degrees in medicine and surgery.

==History==

The aspirations of Manchester and Liverpool to become independent city universities meant that the Victoria University was short-lived. Liverpool left the university in 1903 to become the University of Liverpool; Leeds was granted its own royal charter in 1904 and became the University of Leeds; Manchester, the only remaining site, was granted a new royal charter as the Victoria University of Manchester.

There was also a proposal that York be included: in 1903, F. J. Munby and others (including the Yorkshire Philosophical Society) proposed a &#x27;Victoria University of Yorkshire&#x27;. See University of York. In 1886 there had been a proposed scheme for the affiliation of other institutions including technical schools and literary and philosophical societies, which could have assisted the Yorkshire Philosophical Society&#x27;s proposal, however nothing came of this.

==List of Colleges==

==Student Life==

The Christie Cup is an inter-university competition between Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester in numerous sports since 1886. After the Oxford and Cambridge rivalry, the Christie&#x27;s Championships is the oldest inter–university competition on the English sporting calendar. The cup was a benefaction of Richard Copley Christie, a professor at Owens College.

==Officers==

===Vice-Chancellors===
*1880–1887: Joseph Gouge Greenwood (also Principal of Owens College 1857–1889)
*1887–1891: Adolphus William Ward (also Principal of Owens College 1889–1897)
*1891–1895: Gerald Henry Rendall (University College, Liverpool)
*1895–1897: Adolphus William Ward (second term)
*1897–1901: Nathan Bodington (Yorkshire College, Leeds)
*1901–1903: Alfred Hopkinson (also Principal of Owens College 1898–1904; afterwards Vice-Chancellor of the Victoria University of Manchester until 1913)

===Chancellors===
*1880–1891: The 7th Duke of Devonshire
*1892–1904: The 6th Earl Spencer, afterwards Chancellor of the Victoria University of Manchester.

==Arms==

The armorial bearings of the Victoria University showed charges representative of the three colleges: &quot;Per pale argent and gules, a rose counterchanged, in dexter chief a terrestrial globe semée of bees Or, in sinister chief a fleece Or, in point a liverbird rising argent, beaked and membered gules holding in the beak a fish argent&quot; with the motto &quot;Olim armis nunc studiis&quot; (&#x27;Formerly by weapons, now by studies&#x27;). The globe and bees is for Manchester, the liver bird for Liverpool, the fleece for Yorkshire and the rose for the counties of Lancaster (red rose) and York (white rose). The arms fell into abeyance in 1904 when those of Owens College were adopted for the Victoria University of Manchester.

<text>A W18 engine is an eighteen-cylinder piston engine with three banks of six cylinders in a W configuration.

The W18 layout is rarely used, with the only production examples being several aircraft during the 1920s and 1930s. Prototype W18 engines were produced for concept cars predecessors to the Bugatti Veyron in the late 1990s.

==Aircraft usage==
The first example was the German Mercedes D.VI aeroengine, which were built since 1915.
A later example is the 1929 Hispano-Suiza 18R, an aircraft racing engine produced in limited quantities in France. This was followed in 1934 by the Isotta Fraschini Asso 750, which was built in Italy and used in several flying boats. The Asso 750 was water-cooled and used an angle of 60 degrees between banks. The 1943 Tatra T955 was a prototype diesel aircraft engine which used a W18 layout.

==Automotive usage==
The W18 layout has been considered for use in motor vehicles by two manufacturers, although neither reached production. In 1967, Scuderia Ferrari built a prototype W3 engine as a feasibility study for a W18 engine to use in Formula One. In the late 1990s, the Bugatti EB 118, Bugatti EB 218, Bugatti 18/3 Chiron and Bugatti EB 18/4 Veyron concept cars were fitted with W18 engines, prior to the production version of the Bugatti Veyron using a W16 engine instead.
==Marine usage==
The W18 layout has been used on the high seas; CRM Motori SpA marine engines.

<doc id="874376" wikidata="Q8029021" url="?curid=874376" title="Wodonga railway station">
<text>Wodonga railway station is located on the North East line in Victoria, Australia. It serves the city of Wodonga, and it opened on 25 June 2011.

Opening as part of the Wodonga Rail Bypass project, it replaced the original station that opened on 21 November 1873 and closed on 9 November 2008.

Disused station Barnawartha is located between Wodonga and Chiltern.

==History==
===As a terminus===
Wodonga station was the original terminus of the Victorian Railways&#x27; North East line, which was built during the 1870s, with Wodonga opening on 21 November 1873. The connection through to the standard gauge system across the Murray River to Albury was not completed until 14 June 1883, partly because the New South Wales Government Railways standard gauge system had not yet extended as far south as Albury.

Intercolonial rivalries were settled by the building of lines and bridges of both gauges across the border river flats, with both Albury and Wodonga being transfer stations. Albury later became the passenger interchange station and the major freight transshipment point.

===Standard gauge===
In April 1962, the standard gauge line was extended south from Wodonga to Melbourne, and from that time onwards, most interstate haulage was on the standard gauge. Some broad gauge passenger trains still continued to operate to Albury, to provide a local service to north-eastern Victorian towns, but the long distance interstate freight and passenger trains operated via this new continuous standard gauge link between Melbourne and Sydney.

Livestock, mostly beef cattle, formed a large part of the freight carried to Melbourne from Wodonga, where large saleyards were established near the station. Meatworks were also one of Wodonga&#x27;s main industries. After 1980, the saleyard was moved to Bandiana, east of Wodonga. Dual gauge rail access was constructed at this selling centre, which was adjacent to the Victorian Cudgewa branch line. Services on this branch were discontinued beyond Bandiana, and the Victorian rail system soon ceased livestock traffic. Cattle continued to be occasionally railed from northern NSW to Bandiana Saleyards until 1987, when this rail traffic also ceased. In later years, the sidings at Bandiana were used as a rail container terminal by standard gauge trains only, until closure of the line on 1 September 2009.

Until November 2008, Pacific National operated broad gauge freight services from the Wodonga Coal Sidings to Geelong, carrying logs for woodchipping.

===Wodonga Rail Bypass===

The Wodonga Rail Bypass project moved Wodonga station from the original central location to a position on a new line on the northern edge of the town, along with five kilometres of new track. The release of railway land allowed the redevelopment of Wodonga&#x27;s commercial area, and eliminated ten level crossings. First conceived in 2000, design work commenced in 2006.

In May 2008, it was announced that the project would commence, as part of an upgrade of the North-East line. The last passenger train passed through Wodonga on 8 November 2008, with road coaches operating between Seymour and Albury. The first train passed through the new station site on 15 March 2010: a freight service delivering concrete sleepers.

On 23 July 2010, the new rail bypass was opened, and the original line through Wodonga closed. On 25 June 2011, the new station opened. The original station was later redeveloped as a restaurant.

<text>was a village located in Niihari District, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the village had an estimated population of 8,618 and a density of 588.26 persons per km2. The total area was 15.33 km2.

On March 27, 2006, Tamari, along with the towns of Ogawa and Minori (both from Higashiibaraki District), was merged to create the city of Omitama. The new city takes its name from a merger of the three older town names, Ogawa, MInori, TAMAri. 

The village had a large agricultural base, with rice and renkon (lotus roots) being the main crops.

<text>A W8 engine is an eight-cylinder piston engine with four banks of two cylinders each, arranged in a W configuration.

In practice, the W8 engine is created from two narrow-angle (15 degree) VR4 engines mounted at an angle of 72 degrees from each other on a common crankshaft. Thus, the resulting four banks align to form a &quot;W&quot;.

W8 engines are much less common than V8 engines, and the only W8 engine to reach production was manufactured by Volkswagen.

==Volkswagen W8 engine==
The Volkswagen 4-litre W8 engine was available in the Volkswagen Passat (B5.5) from September 2001 to September 2004. Production was minimal at only 11,000 units.

The engine had a displacement of , had a peak power rating of at 6,000 rpm and a peak torque rating of at 2,750 rpm. Power and torque outputs were lower than competitors V8 engines with similar capacity, however the W8 engine was praised for its smoothness.

Sales of the W8-engined Passat models were poor, and production was discontinued when the next generation of Passat switched from a longitudinal engine to a transverse engine layout, which made packaging of the wide W8 engine difficult. The W8 was effectively replaced by the Volkswagen 3.6-litre VR6 petrol engine.

<text>The Catechism for Filipino Catholics, or CFC, is a contextualized and inculturated Roman Catholic catechism for Filipinos prepared by the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and approved by the Holy See. The draft was produced by the CBCP&#x27;s &quot;Episcopal Commission on Catechesis and Catholic Education.&quot;

It is considered the present-day successor of the early 16th century &quot;Doctrina Christiana&quot;, the first book printed in what is now the Philippines. The &quot;Doctrina Christiana&quot; was written in Tagalog, in both &quot;abecedario&quot; (the newly developed Latinised orthography) and the indigenous Baybayin script commonly used at the time, as well as Spanish.

<text>The VR6 engine was a six-cylinder engine configuration developed by Volkswagen. The name VR6 comes from the combination of German words “V-Motor” and “Reihenmotor” meaning “inline engine” referring to the VR-engine having characteristics of both a V-layout and a inline layout. It was developed specifically for transverse engine installations and FWD (front-wheel drive) vehicles. The VR6 is a highly compact engine, thanks to the narrower angle of 10.5 to 15 degrees between cylinder banks, as opposed to the traditional V6 angles ranging from 45 to 90 degrees. The compact design is cheaper to manufacture, since only one cylinder head is required for all six cylinders, much like a traditional inline-6 engine.

Volkswagen Group introduced the first VR6 engine in 1991 and VR6 engines remained in production until late 2024. Volkswagen also produced a five-cylinder VR5 engine based on the VR6.

VR6 engines share a common cylinder head for the two banks of cylinders. Only two camshafts are needed for the engine, regardless of whether the engine has two or four valves per cylinder. This simplifies engine construction and reduces costs.

Since the cylinders are not located on the centreline of the combined cylinder head, the lengths of the intake and exhaust ports are different for each bank. Without compensation, these varying port lengths would result in the two banks of cylinders producing different amounts of power at a particular engine RPM. The difference in port lengths are compensated for with the length of the runners in the intake manifold, the camshaft overlap and lift profile, or a combination thereof.
== Volkswagen engines ==

The Volkswagen VR6 engine was designed for transverse engine installations in front-wheel drive vehicles. The narrow angle of 15° between the two cylinder banks reduced the width of the engine, compared to a traditional V6 engine. Therefore, the VR6 engine is easier to fit within an engine bay that was originally designed for a four-cylinder engine.

=== 12-valve versions ===
Early VR6 engines had two valves per cylinder (for a total of twelve valves) and used one camshaft for the intake and exhaust valves of each cylinder bank (without the use of rockers).

The first Volkswagen VR6 engine uses the AAA version. It had a bore of and a stroke of , for a total displacement of . In 1994, a ABV version was introduced in some European countries, with an increased bore of .

The V angle between the cylinder banks is 15°, and the compression ratio is 10:1. The crankshaft runs in seven main bearings and the journals are offset 22° to one another, in order to accommodate the offset cylinder placement. This also allows the use of a 120° firing interval between cylinders. The firing order is: 1, 5, 3, 6, 2, 4. The centerlines of the cylinders are offset from the centerline of the crankshaft by .

The valve sizes are for the intake and for the exhaust. Since the two rows of pistons and cylinders share a single cylinder head and head gasket, the piston crown (or top surface) is tilted. The engine management system is Bosch Motronic.

=== 24-valve versions ===
A version with four valves per cylinder (for a total of 24 valves) was introduced in 1999. The 24-valve versions use one camshaft for the intake valves of both banks (using rockers to reach the furthest bank) and the other camshaft for the exhaust valves of both banks (again, through the use of rockers). This operating principle is more akin to a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) design, with one camshaft for intake valves, and one for exhaust valves.

=== History ===
The 1922–1976 Lancia V4 engine and 1922–1939 Lancia V8 engine were the first narrow angle V engines to be used in a motor vehicle.

The first versions of the VR6 engine were introduced in the 1991 Volkswagen Passat B3 sedan and Volkswagen Corrado coupe. A AAA version producing was used in most Passat models and in the North American version of the Corrado. A ABV version producing was used in the &quot;Passat Syncro&quot; model and the European version of the Corrado. Both versions used two valves per cylinder. Usage of the VR6 engine spread to the Volkswagen Golf Mk3 &quot;2.8 VR6&quot; and Volkswagen Vento/Jetta (A3), &quot;2.8 VR6&quot; models in 1992, and high specification versions of the Sharan/Galaxy/Alhambra MPVs. The 2.8 litre version was also used in the 1996–2003 Mercedes-Benz Vito (W638) commercial vans, where it was designated &quot;M104.900&quot;.

In 1997, the VR5 engine was introduced, based on the VR6 engine.

An AQP/AUE version with four valves per cylinder was introduced in 2000. This engine produced , and mostly replaced the two-valve engines, except for in North America where an updated version of the two-valve engine was used in the Golf and Jetta from 2000 to 2002.

A EA390 version of the 4 valve engine was introduced in the 2001 Volkswagen New Beetle &quot;RSi&quot; model. Versions of this 3.2 litre engine were also used in the 2002–2004 Volkswagen Golf Mk4 &quot;R32&quot; model, the 2003-2010 Audi TT &quot;3.2 VR6 quattro&quot; models and the 2003-2009 Audi A3 8P &quot;3.2 VR6 Quattro&quot;(US Models). Peak power output was in the New Beetle (engine code AXJ), in the New Beetle and Golf (engine code BFH/BJS), and in the Audi TT(engine code BHE) and Audi A3 8P(engine code BDB / BMJ / BUB).

The engine size was again increased in 2005, when a version with gasoline direct injection (FSI) was introduced in the Volkswagen Passat (B6). This BLV version uses a narrower 10.6 degree angle between the cylinder banks and produces . A AXZ version producing was introduced in 2006. In 2008, an uprated &quot;BWS&quot; version of the 3.6 litre engine producing was introduced in the Volkswagen Passat (B6) &quot;R36&quot; model.

The base model Porsche Cayenne (9PA) used 3.2-liter VR6 engine from 2003 to 2006 and then a 3.6-litre VR6 engine from 2008 to 2010. Then the next generation Porsche Cayenne (92A) also used a 3.6-litre VR6 engine from 2010 to 2018.

Volkswagen had started to phase out VR engines in favour of downsized turbocharged four cylinder engines. In 2017, the VR6 engines made an unexpected comeback, with versions of the 24-valve VR6 engines being produced for the Volkswagen Atlas. Volkswagen also made a new VR6 (still EA390) for the Chinese market only, its 2.5-litre turbocharged 24-valve VR6 producing and 500 N⋅m of torque, for the Volkswagen Teramont SUV and Volkswagen Talagon MPV.

=== W engines ===

Volkswagen Group has produced several W engines based on combining two VR engines on a common crankshaft. The first W engine to reach production was the W12 engine which has been produced since 2001. The W12 engine is constructed from two VR6 engines mated together at an angle of 72 degrees. Although Volkswagen has not produced a VR4 engine, nonetheless it briefly produced a W8 engine from 2001 to 2004.

The largest Volkswagen W engine is the W16 engine introduced on the Bugatti Veyron in 2005. This engine uses an angle of 90 degrees between the two VR8 engines, and has four turbochargers.

== Other manufacturers ==
Motorcycle manufacturer Horex has produced VR6 engines since 2012.

<doc id="874400" wikidata="Q3526854" url="?curid=874400" title="Representation theory of finite groups">
<text>The representation theory of groups is a part of mathematics which examines how groups act on given structures.

Here the focus is in particular on operations of groups on vector spaces. Nevertheless, groups acting on other groups or on sets are also considered. For more details, please refer to the section on permutation representations.

Other than a few marked exceptions, only finite groups will be considered in this article. We will also restrict ourselves to vector spaces over fields of characteristic zero. Because the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero is complete, a theory valid for a special algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is also valid for every other algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Thus, without loss of generality, we can study vector spaces over formula_1

Representation theory is used in many parts of mathematics, as well as in quantum chemistry and physics. Among other things it is used in algebra to examine the structure of groups. There are also applications in harmonic analysis and number theory. For example, representation theory is used in the modern approach to gain new results about automorphic forms.

==Definition==

===Linear representations===
Let formula_2 be a formula_3–vector space and formula_4 a finite group. A linear representation of formula_4 is a group homomorphism formula_6 Here formula_7 is notation for a general linear group, and formula_8 for an automorphism group. This means that a linear representation is a map formula_9 which satisfies formula_10 for all formula_11 The vector space formula_2 is called a representation space of formula_13 Often the term &quot;representation of formula_4&quot; is also used for the representation space formula_15

The representation of a group in a module instead of a vector space is also called a linear representation.

We write formula_16 for the representation formula_17 of formula_13 Sometimes we use the notation formula_19 if it is clear to which representation the space formula_2 belongs.

In this article we will restrict ourselves to the study of finite-dimensional representation spaces, except for the last chapter. As in most cases only a finite number of vectors in formula_2 is of interest, it is sufficient to study the subrepresentation generated by these vectors. The representation space of this subrepresentation is then finite-dimensional.

The degree of a representation is the dimension of its representation space formula_15 The notation formula_23 is sometimes used to denote the degree of a representation formula_24

===Examples===
The trivial representation is given by formula_25 for all formula_26

A representation of degree formula_27 of a group formula_4 is a homomorphism into the multiplicative group formula_29 As every element of formula_4 is of finite order, the values of formula_31 are roots of unity. For example, let formula_32 be a nontrivial linear representation. Since formula_33 is a group homomorphism, it has to satisfy formula_34 Because formula_27 generates formula_36 is determined by its value on formula_37 And as formula_33 is nontrivial, formula_39 Thus, we achieve the result that the image of formula_4 under formula_33 has to be a nontrivial subgroup of the group which consists of the fourth roots of unity. In other words, formula_33 has to be one of the following three maps:
:formula_43

Let formula_44 and let formula_45 be the group homomorphism defined by: 
:formula_46
In this case formula_33 is a linear representation of formula_4 of degree formula_49

====Permutation representation====
Let formula_50 be a finite set and let formula_4 be a group acting on formula_52 Denote by formula_53 the group of all permutations on formula_50 with the composition as group multiplication.

A group acting on a finite set is sometimes considered sufficient for the definition of the permutation representation. However, since we want to construct examples for linear representations - where groups act on vector spaces instead of on arbitrary finite sets - we have to proceed in a different way. In order to construct the permutation representation, we need a vector space formula_2 with formula_56 A basis of formula_2 can be indexed by the elements of formula_52 The permutation representation is the group homomorphism formula_59 given by formula_60 for all formula_61 All linear maps formula_31 are uniquely defined by this property.

Example. Let formula_63 and formula_64 Then formula_4 acts on formula_50 via formula_67 The associated linear representation is formula_68 with formula_69 for formula_70

====Left- and right-regular representation====

Let formula_4 be a group and formula_2 be a vector space of dimension formula_73 with a basis formula_74 indexed by the elements of formula_13 The left-regular representation is a special case of the permutation representation by choosing formula_76 This means formula_77 for all formula_78 Thus, the family formula_79 of images of formula_80 are a basis of formula_15 The degree of the left-regular representation is equal to the order of the group.

The right-regular representation is defined on the same vector space with a similar homomorphism: formula_82 In the same way as before formula_79 is a basis of formula_15 Just as in the case of the left-regular representation, the degree of the right-regular representation is equal to the order of formula_13

Both representations are isomorphic via formula_86 For this reason they are not always set apart, and often referred to as &quot;the&quot; regular representation.

A closer look provides the following result: A given linear representation formula_87 is isomorphic to the left-regular representation if and only if there exists a formula_88 such that formula_89 is a basis of formula_90

Example. Let formula_91 and formula_92 with the basis formula_93 Then the left-regular representation formula_94 is defined by formula_95 for formula_96 The right-regular representation is defined analogously by formula_97 for formula_98

===Representations, modules and the convolution algebra===
Let formula_4 be a finite group, let formula_3 be a commutative ring and let formula_101 be the group algebra of formula_4 over formula_103 This algebra is free and a basis can be indexed by the elements of formula_13 Most often the basis is identified with formula_4. Every element formula_106 can then be uniquely expressed as

:formula_107 with formula_108.

The multiplication in formula_101 extends that in formula_4 distributively.

Now let formula_2 be a formula_3–module and let formula_113 be a linear representation of formula_4 in formula_15 We define formula_116 for all formula_117 and formula_118. By linear extension formula_2 is endowed with the structure of a left-formula_101–module. Vice versa we obtain a linear representation of formula_4 starting from a formula_101–module formula_2. Additionally, homomorphisms of representations are in bijective correspondence with group algebra homomorphisms. Therefore, these terms may be used interchangeably. This is an example of an isomorphism of categories.

Suppose formula_124 In this case the left formula_125–module given by formula_125 itself corresponds to the left-regular representation. In the same way formula_125 as a right formula_125–module corresponds to the right-regular representation.

In the following we will define the convolution algebra: Let formula_4 be a group, the set formula_130 is a formula_131–vector space with the operations addition and scalar multiplication then this vector space is isomorphic to formula_132 The convolution of two elements formula_133 defined by

:formula_134

makes formula_135 an algebra. The algebra formula_135 is called the convolution algebra.

The convolution algebra is free and has a basis indexed by the group elements: formula_137 where
:formula_138
Using the properties of the convolution we obtain: formula_139

We define a map between formula_135 and formula_141 by defining formula_142 on the basis formula_143 and extending it linearly. Obviously the prior map is bijective. A closer inspection of the convolution of two basis elements as shown in the equation above reveals that the multiplication in formula_135 corresponds to that in formula_145 Thus, the convolution algebra and the group algebra are isomorphic as algebras.

The involution

:formula_146

turns formula_135 into a formula_148–algebra. We have formula_149

A representation formula_150 of a group formula_4 extends to a formula_148–algebra homomorphism formula_153 by formula_154 Since multiplicativity is a characteristic property of algebra homomorphisms, formula_155 satisfies formula_156 If formula_155 is unitary, we also obtain formula_158 For the definition of a unitary representation, please refer to the chapter on properties. In that chapter we will see that (without loss of generality) every linear representation can be assumed to be unitary.

Using the convolution algebra we can implement a Fourier transformation on a group formula_13 In the area of harmonic analysis it is shown that the following definition is consistent with the definition of the Fourier transformation on formula_160

Let formula_161 be a representation and let formula_162 be a formula_163-valued function on formula_4. The Fourier transform formula_165 of formula_166 is defined as 
:formula_167

This transformation satisfies formula_168

===Maps between representations===

A map between two representations formula_169 of the same group formula_4 is a linear map formula_171 with the property that formula_172 holds for all formula_173 In other words, the following diagram commutes for all formula_117:

Such a map is also called formula_4–linear, or an equivariant map. The kernel, the image and the cokernel of formula_176 are defined by default. The composition of equivariant maps is again an equivariant map. There is a category of representations with equivariant maps as its morphisms. They are again formula_4–modules. Thus, they provide representations of formula_4 due to the correlation described in the previous section.

==Irreducible representations and Schur&#x27;s lemma==
Let formula_179 be a linear representation of formula_13 Let formula_181 be a formula_4-invariant subspace of formula_183 that is, formula_184 for all formula_185 and formula_186. The restriction formula_187 is an isomorphism of formula_181 onto itself. Because formula_189 holds for all formula_190 this construction is a representation of formula_4 in formula_90 It is called subrepresentation of formula_15
Any representation &quot;V&quot; has at least two subrepresentations, namely the one consisting only of 0, and the one consisting of &quot;V&quot; itself. The representation is called an &quot;irreducible representation&quot;, if these two are the only subrepresentations. Some authors also call these representations simple, given that they are precisely the simple modules over the group algebra formula_125.

&quot;Schur&#x27;s lemma&quot; puts a strong constraint on maps between irreducible representations. If formula_195 and formula_196 are both irreducible, and formula_197 is a linear map such that formula_198 for all formula_173, there is the following dichotomy:

*If formula_200 and formula_201 formula_202 is a homothety (i.e. formula_203 for a formula_204). More generally, if formula_205 and formula_206 are isomorphic, the space of &quot;G&quot;-linear maps is one-dimensional.
*Otherwise, if the two representations are not isomorphic, &quot;F&quot; must be 0.

==Properties==
Two representations formula_207 are called equivalent or isomorphic, if there exists a formula_4–linear vector space isomorphism between the representation spaces. In other words, they are isomorphic if there exists a bijective linear map formula_209 such that formula_210 for all formula_211 In particular, equivalent representations have the same degree.

A representation formula_212 is called faithful when formula_155 is injective. In this case formula_155 induces an isomorphism between formula_4 and the image formula_216 As the latter is a subgroup of formula_217 we can regard formula_4 via formula_155 as subgroup of formula_220

We can restrict the range as well as the domain:

Let formula_221 be a subgroup of formula_13 Let formula_33 be a linear representation of formula_13 We denote by formula_225 the restriction of formula_33 to the subgroup formula_227

If there is no danger of confusion, we might use only formula_228 or in short formula_229

The notation formula_230 or in short formula_231 is also used to denote the restriction of the representation formula_2 of formula_4 onto formula_227

Let formula_166 be a function on formula_13 We write formula_237 or shortly formula_238 for the restriction to the subgroup formula_227

It can be proven that the number of irreducible representations of a group formula_4 (or correspondingly the number of simple formula_125–modules) equals the number of conjugacy classes of formula_13

A representation is called semisimple or completely reducible if it can be written as a direct sum of irreducible representations. This is analogous to the corresponding definition for a semisimple algebra.

For the definition of the direct sum of representations please refer to the section on direct sums of representations.

A representation is called isotypic if it is a direct sum of pairwise isomorphic irreducible representations.

Let formula_243 be a given representation of a group formula_13 Let formula_245 be an irreducible representation of formula_13 The formula_245–isotype formula_248 of formula_4 is defined as the sum of all irreducible subrepresentations of formula_2 isomorphic to formula_251

Every vector space over formula_131 can be provided with an inner product. A representation formula_33 of a group formula_4 in a vector space endowed with an inner product is called unitary if formula_31 is unitary for every formula_173 This means that in particular every formula_31 is diagonalizable. For more details see the article on unitary representations.

A representation is unitary with respect to a given inner product if and only if the inner product is invariant with regard to the induced operation of formula_258 i.e. if and only if formula_259 holds for all formula_260

A given inner product formula_261 can be replaced by an invariant inner product by exchanging formula_262 with

:formula_263

Thus, without loss of generality we can assume that every further considered representation is unitary.

Example. Let formula_264 be the dihedral group of order formula_265 generated by formula_266 which fulfil the properties formula_267 and formula_268 Let formula_269 be a linear representation of formula_270 defined on the generators by: 
:formula_271

This representation is faithful. The subspace formula_272 is a formula_270–invariant subspace. Thus, there exists a nontrivial subrepresentation formula_274 with formula_275 Therefore, the representation is not irreducible. The mentioned subrepresentation is of degree one and irreducible. 
The complementary subspace of formula_272 is formula_270–invariant as well. Therefore, we obtain the subrepresentation formula_278 with
:formula_279
This subrepresentation is also irreducible. That means, the original representation is completely reducible: 
:formula_280
Both subrepresentations are isotypic and are the two only non-zero isotypes of formula_24

The representation formula_33 is unitary with regard to the standard inner product on formula_283 because formula_284 and formula_285 are unitary.

Let formula_286 be any vector space isomorphism. Then formula_287 which is defined by the equation formula_288 for all formula_289 is a representation isomorphic to formula_24

By restricting the domain of the representation to a subgroup, e.g. formula_291 we obtain the representation formula_292 This representation is defined by the image formula_293 whose explicit form is shown above.

==Constructions==

===The dual representation===
Let formula_294 be a given representation. The dual representation or contragredient representation formula_295 is a representation of formula_4 in the dual vector space of formula_15 It is defined by the property

:formula_298

With regard to the natural pairing formula_299 between formula_300 and formula_301 the definition above provides the equation:

:formula_302

For an example, see the main page on this topic: Dual representation.

===Direct sum of representations===

Let formula_303 and formula_304 be a representation of formula_305 and formula_306 respectively. The direct sum of these representations is a linear representation and is defined as

:formula_307

Let formula_308 be representations of the same group formula_13 For the sake of simplicity, the direct sum of these representations is defined as a representation of formula_258 i.e. it is given as formula_311 by viewing formula_4 as the diagonal subgroup of formula_313

Example. Let (here formula_314 and formula_315 are the imaginary unit and the primitive cube root of unity respectively):

:formula_316

Then

:formula_317

As it is sufficient to consider the image of the generating element, we find that

:formula_318

===Tensor product of representations===

Let formula_319 be linear representations. We define the linear representation formula_320 into the tensor product of formula_321 and formula_322 by formula_323 in which formula_324 This representation is called outer tensor product of the representations formula_205 and formula_326 The existence and uniqueness is a consequence of the properties of the tensor product.

Example. We reexamine the example provided for the direct sum:

:formula_316

The outer tensor product

:formula_328

Using the standard basis of formula_329 we have the following for the generating element:

:formula_330

Remark. Note that the direct sum and the tensor products have different degrees and hence are different representations.

Let formula_331 be two linear representations of the same group. Let formula_332 be an element of formula_13 Then formula_334 is defined by formula_335 for formula_336 and we write formula_337 Then the map formula_338 defines a linear representation of formula_258 which is also called tensor product of the given representations.

These two cases have to be strictly distinguished. The first case is a representation of the group product into the tensor product of the corresponding representation spaces. The second case is a representation of the group formula_4 into the tensor product of two representation spaces of this one group. But this last case can be viewed as a special case of the first one by focusing on the diagonal subgroup formula_313 This definition can be iterated a finite number of times.

Let formula_2 and formula_181 be representations of the group formula_13 Then formula_345 is a representation by virtue of the following identity: formula_346. Let formula_347 and let formula_33 be the representation on formula_349 Let formula_350 be the representation on formula_2 and formula_352 the representation on formula_90 Then the identity above leads to the following result:
:formula_354 for all formula_355

:Theorem. The irreducible representations of formula_356 up to isomorphism are exactly the representations formula_357 in which formula_205 and formula_206 are irreducible representations of formula_305 and formula_306 respectively.

====Symmetric and alternating square====
Let formula_362 be a linear representation of formula_13 Let formula_364 be a basis of formula_15 Define formula_366 by extending formula_367 linearly. It then holds that formula_368 and therefore formula_369 splits up into formula_370 in which 
:formula_371
:formula_372
These subspaces are formula_4–invariant and by this define subrepresentations which are called the symmetric square and the alternating square, respectively. These subrepresentations are also defined in formula_374 although in this case they are denoted wedge product formula_375 and symmetric product formula_376 In case that formula_377 the vector space formula_378 is in general not equal to the direct sum of these two products.

==Decompositions==
In order to understand representations more easily, a decomposition of the representation space into the direct sum of simpler subrepresentations would be desirable.
This can be achieved for finite groups as we will see in the following results. More detailed explanations and proofs may be found in [1] and [2].

:Theorem. (Maschke) Let formula_379 be a linear representation where formula_2 is a vector space over a field of characteristic zero. Let formula_181 be a formula_4-invariant subspace of formula_15 Then the complement formula_384 of formula_181 exists in formula_2 and is formula_4-invariant.
A subrepresentation and its complement determine a representation uniquely.

The following theorem will be presented in a more general way, as it provides a very beautiful result about representations of compact – and therefore also of finite – groups:

:Theorem. Every linear representation of a compact group over a field of characteristic zero is a direct sum of irreducible representations.

Or in the language of formula_101-modules: If formula_389 the group algebra formula_101 is semisimple, i.e. it is the direct sum of simple algebras.

Note that this decomposition is not unique. However, the number of how many times a subrepresentation isomorphic to a given irreducible representation is occurring in this decomposition is independent of the choice of decomposition.

The canonical decomposition

To achieve a unique decomposition, one has to combine all the irreducible subrepresentations that are isomorphic to each other. That means, the representation space is decomposed into a direct sum of its isotypes. This decomposition is uniquely determined. It is called the canonical decomposition.

Let formula_391 be the set of all irreducible representations of a group formula_4 up to isomorphism. Let formula_2 be a representation of formula_4 and let formula_395 be the set of all isotypes of formula_15 The projection formula_397 corresponding to the canonical decomposition is given by

:formula_398

where formula_399 formula_400 and formula_401 is the character belonging to formula_402

In the following, we show how to determine the isotype to the trivial representation:

Definition (Projection formula). For every representation formula_19 of a group formula_4 we define 
:formula_405
In general, formula_406 is not formula_4-linear. We define 
:formula_408 
Then formula_409 is a formula_4-linear map, because 
:formula_411

:Proposition. The map formula_409 is a projection from formula_2 to formula_414

This proposition enables us to determine the isotype to the trivial subrepresentation of a given representation explicitly.

How often the trivial representation occurs in formula_2 is given by formula_416 This result is a consequence of the fact that the eigenvalues of a projection are only formula_417 or formula_27 and that the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue formula_27 is the image of the projection. Since the trace of the projection is the sum of all eigenvalues, we obtain the following result 
:formula_420
in which formula_421 denotes the isotype of the trivial representation.

Let formula_422 be a nontrivial irreducible representation of formula_13 Then the isotype to the trivial representation of formula_155 is the null space. That means the following equation holds
:formula_425
Let formula_426 be an orthonormal basis of formula_427 Then we have:
:formula_428
Therefore, the following is valid for a nontrivial irreducible representation formula_2: 
:formula_430

Example. Let formula_431 be the permutation groups in three elements. Let formula_432 be a linear representation of formula_433 defined on the generating elements as follows:
:formula_434

This representation can be decomposed on first look into the left-regular representation of formula_435which is denoted by formula_155 in the following, and the representation formula_437 with

:formula_438

With the help of the irreducibility criterion taken from the next chapter, we could realize that formula_439 is irreducible but formula_155 is not. This is because (in terms of the inner product from ”Inner product and characters” below) we have formula_441

The subspace formula_442 of formula_443 is invariant with respect to the left-regular representation. Restricted to this subspace we obtain the trivial representation.

The orthogonal complement of formula_442 is formula_445 Restricted to this subspace, which is also formula_4–invariant as we have seen above, we obtain the representation formula_245 given by

:formula_448

Again, we can use the irreducibility criterion of the next chapter to prove that formula_245 is irreducible. Now, formula_439 and formula_245 are isomorphic because formula_452 for all formula_453 in which formula_454 is given by the matrix

:formula_455

A decomposition of formula_456 in irreducible subrepresentations is: formula_457 where formula_27 denotes the trivial representation and 
:formula_459 
is the corresponding decomposition of the representation space.

We obtain the canonical decomposition by combining all the isomorphic irreducible subrepresentations: formula_460 is the formula_245-isotype of formula_33 and consequently the canonical decomposition is given by
:formula_463

The theorems above are in general not valid for infinite groups. This will be demonstrated by the following example: let

:formula_464

Together with the matrix multiplication formula_4 is an infinite group. formula_4 acts on formula_467 by matrix-vector multiplication. We consider the representation formula_468 for all formula_469 The subspace formula_470 is a formula_4-invariant subspace. However, there exists no formula_4-invariant complement to this subspace. The assumption that such a complement exists would entail that every matrix is diagonalizable over formula_473 This is known to be wrong and thus yields a contradiction.

The moral of the story is that if we consider infinite groups, it is possible that a representation - even one that is not irreducible - can not be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations.

==Character theory==
===Definitions===

The &quot;character&quot; of a representation formula_9 is defined as the map

:formula_475 in which formula_476 denotes the trace of the linear map formula_477

Even though the character is a map between two groups, it is not in general a group homomorphism, as the following example shows.

Let formula_478 be the representation defined by:
:formula_479
The character formula_480 is given by 
:formula_481
Characters of permutation representations are particularly easy to compute. If &quot;V&quot; is the &quot;G&quot;-representation corresponding to the left action of formula_4 on a finite set formula_50, then

:formula_484

For example, the character of the regular representation formula_485 is given by
:formula_486
where formula_487 denotes the neutral element of formula_13

=== Properties===
A crucial property of characters is the formula

:formula_489

This formula follows from the fact that the trace of a product &quot;AB&quot; of two square matrices is the same as the trace of &quot;BA&quot;. Functions formula_490 satisfying such a formula are called class functions. Put differently, class functions and in particular characters are constant on each conjugacy class formula_491
It also follows from elementary properties of the trace that formula_492 is the sum of the eigenvalues of formula_31 with multiplicity. If the degree of the representation is &quot;n&quot;, then the sum is &quot;n&quot; long. If &quot;s&quot; has order &quot;m&quot;, these eigenvalues are all &quot;m&quot;-th roots of unity. This fact can be used to show that formula_494 and it also implies formula_495

Since the trace of the identity matrix is the number of rows, formula_496 where formula_487 is the neutral element of formula_4 and &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of the representation. In general, formula_499 is a normal subgroup in formula_13
The following table shows how the characters formula_501 of two given representations formula_502 give rise to characters of related representations.

By construction, there is a direct sum decomposition of formula_503. On characters, this corresponds to the fact that the sum of the last two expressions in the table is formula_504, the character of formula_505.

===Inner product and characters===
In order to show some particularly interesting results about characters, it is rewarding to consider a more general type of functions on groups:

Definition (Class functions). A function formula_506 is called a class function if it is constant on conjugacy classes of formula_4, i.e. 
:formula_508
Note that every character is a class function, as the trace of a matrix is preserved under conjugation.

The set of all class functions is a formula_131–algebra and is denoted by formula_510. Its dimension is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of formula_13

Proofs of the following results of this chapter may be found in [1], [2] and [3].

An inner product can be defined on the set of all class functions on a finite group:
:formula_512
Orthonormal property. If formula_513 are the distinct irreducible characters of formula_4, they form an orthonormal basis for the vector space of all class functions with respect to the inner product defined above, i.e. 
* formula_515
* Every class function formula_166 may be expressed as a unique linear combination of the irreducible characters formula_513.
One might verify that the irreducible characters generate formula_518 by showing that there exists no nonzero class function which is orthogonal to all the irreducible characters. For formula_519 a representation and formula_166 a class function, denote formula_521 Then for formula_519 irreducible, we have formula_523 from Schur&#x27;s lemma. Suppose formula_524 is a class function which is orthogonal to all the characters. Then by the above we have formula_525 whenever formula_519 is irreducible. But then it follows that formula_525 for all formula_519, by decomposability. Take formula_519 to be the regular representation. Applying formula_530 to some particular basis element formula_531, we get formula_532. Since this is true for all formula_531, we have formula_534

It follows from the orthonormal property that the number of non-isomorphic irreducible representations of a group formula_4 is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of formula_13

Furthermore, a class function on formula_4 is a character of formula_4 if and only if it can be written as a linear combination of the distinct irreducible characters formula_539 with non-negative integer coefficients: if formula_540 is a class function on formula_4 such that formula_542 where formula_543 non-negative integers, then formula_540 is the character of the direct sum formula_545 of the representations formula_546 corresponding to formula_547 Conversely, it is always possible to write any character as a sum of irreducible characters.

The inner product defined above can be extended on the set of all formula_163-valued functions formula_135 on a finite group:
:formula_512

A symmetric bilinear form can also be defined on formula_551
:formula_552
These two forms match on the set of characters. If there is no danger of confusion the index of both forms formula_553 and formula_554 will be omitted.

Let formula_555 be two formula_125–modules. Note that formula_125–modules are simply representations of formula_4. Since the orthonormal property yields the number of irreducible representations of formula_4 is exactly the number of its conjugacy classes, then there are exactly as many simple formula_125–modules (up to isomorphism) as there are conjugacy classes of formula_13

We define formula_562 in which formula_563 is the vector space of all formula_4–linear maps. This form is bilinear with respect to the direct sum.

In the following, these bilinear forms will allow us to obtain some important results with respect to the decomposition and irreducibility of representations.

For instance, let formula_565 and formula_566 be the characters of formula_321 and formula_568 respectively. Thenformula_569

It is possible to derive the following theorem from the results above, along with Schur&#x27;s lemma and the complete reducibility of representations.

:Theorem. Let formula_2 be a linear representation of formula_4 with character formula_572 Let formula_573 where formula_574 are irreducible. Let formula_575 be an irreducible representation of formula_4 with character formula_577 Then the number of subrepresentations formula_574 which are isomorphic to formula_181 is independent of the given decomposition and is equal to the inner product formula_580 i.e. the formula_245–isotype formula_582 of formula_2 is independent of the choice of decomposition. We also get:
::formula_584
:and thus
::formula_585

:Corollary. Two representations with the same character are isomorphic. This means that every representation is determined by its character.

With this we obtain a very useful result to analyse representations:

 Irreducibility criterion. Let formula_586 be the character of the representation formula_183 then we have formula_588 The case formula_589 holds if and only if formula_2 is irreducible.

Therefore, using the first theorem, the characters of irreducible representations of formula_4 form an orthonormal set on formula_518 with respect to this inner product.

:Corollary. Let formula_2 be a vector space with formula_594 A given irreducible representation formula_2 of formula_4 is contained formula_597–times in the regular representation. In other words, if formula_485 denotes the regular representation of formula_4 then we have: formula_600 in which formula_601 is the set of all irreducible representations of formula_4 that are pairwise not isomorphic to each other.

In terms of the group algebra, this means that formula_603 as algebras.

As a numerical result we get: 
:formula_604
in which formula_485 is the regular representation and formula_606 and formula_607 are corresponding characters to formula_608 and formula_609 respectively. Recall that formula_487 denotes the neutral element of the group.

This formula is a &quot;necessary and sufficient&quot; condition for the problem of classifying the irreducible representations of a group up to isomorphism. It provides us with the means to check whether we found all the isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of a group.

Similarly, by using the character of the regular representation evaluated at formula_611 we get the equation:
:formula_612

Using the description of representations via the convolution algebra we achieve an equivalent formulation of these equations:

The Fourier inversion formula:
:formula_613

In addition, the Plancherel formula holds:
:formula_614
In both formulas formula_16 is a linear representation of a group formula_616 and formula_617

The corollary above has an additional consequence:

:Lemma. Let formula_4 be a group. Then the following is equivalent:
:* formula_4 is abelian.
:* Every function on formula_4 is a class function.
:* All irreducible representations of formula_4 have degree formula_622

==The induced representation==
As was shown in the section on properties of linear representations, we can - by restriction - obtain a representation of a subgroup starting from a representation of a group. Naturally we are interested in the reverse process: Is it possible to obtain the representation of a group starting from a representation of a subgroup? We will see that the induced representation defined below provides us with the necessary concept. Admittedly, this construction is not inverse but rather adjoint to the restriction.

===Definitions===
Let formula_623 be a linear representation of formula_13 Let formula_221 be a subgroup and formula_626 the restriction. Let formula_181 be a subrepresentation of formula_628 We write formula_629 to denote this representation. Let formula_173 The vector space formula_631 depends only on the left coset formula_632 of formula_633 Let formula_485 be a representative system of formula_635 then

:formula_636

is a subrepresentation of formula_637

A representation formula_33 of formula_4 in formula_640 is called induced by the representation formula_641 of formula_221 in formula_643 if

:formula_644

Here formula_485 denotes a representative system of formula_646 and formula_647 for all formula_648 and for all formula_649 In other words: the representation formula_243 is induced by formula_651 if every formula_652 can be written uniquely as

:formula_653

where formula_654 for every formula_649

We denote the representation formula_33 of formula_4 which is induced by the representation formula_641 of formula_221 as formula_660 or in short formula_661 if there is no danger of confusion. The representation space itself is frequently used instead of the representation map, i.e. formula_662 or formula_663 if the representation formula_2 is induced by formula_90

====Alternative description of the induced representation====
By using the group algebra we obtain an alternative description of the induced representation:

Let formula_4 be a group, formula_2 a formula_125–module and formula_181 a formula_670–submodule of formula_2 corresponding to the subgroup formula_221 of formula_13 We say that formula_2 is induced by formula_181 if formula_676 in which formula_4 acts on the first factor: formula_678 for all formula_679

===Properties===
The results introduced in this section will be presented without proof. These may be found in [1] and [2].

:Uniqueness and existence of the induced representation. Let formula_680 be a linear representation of a subgroup formula_221 of formula_13 Then there exists a linear representation formula_16 of formula_258 which is induced by formula_685 Note that this representation is unique up to isomorphism.

:Transitivity of induction. Let formula_181 be a representation of formula_221 and let formula_688 be an ascending series of groups. Then we have
::formula_689

:Lemma. Let formula_16 be induced by formula_691 and let formula_692 be a linear representation of formula_13 Now let formula_694 be a linear map satisfying the property that formula_695 for all formula_696 Then there exists a uniquely determined linear map formula_697 which extends formula_202 and for which formula_699 is valid for all formula_173

This means that if we interpret formula_701 as a formula_702–module, we have formula_703 where formula_704 is the vector space of all formula_702–homomorphisms of formula_640 to formula_707 The same is valid for formula_708

Induction on class functions. In the same way as it was done with representations, we can - by &quot;induction&quot; - obtain a class function on the group from a class function on a subgroup. Let formula_540 be a class function on formula_227 We define a function formula_711 on formula_4 by
:formula_713
We say formula_711 is &quot;induced&quot; by formula_540 and write formula_716 or formula_717

:Proposition. The function formula_718 is a class function on formula_13 If formula_540 is the character of a representation formula_181 of formula_722 then formula_718 is the character of the induced representation formula_724 of formula_13

:Lemma. If formula_726 is a class function on formula_221 and formula_540 is a class function on formula_258 then we have: formula_730

:Theorem. Let formula_243 be the representation of formula_4 induced by the representation formula_691 of the subgroup formula_227 Let formula_480 and formula_736 be the corresponding characters. Let formula_485 be a representative system of formula_738 The induced character is given by
::formula_739

===Frobenius reciprocity===

As a preemptive summary, the lesson to take from Frobenius reciprocity is that the maps formula_740 and formula_741 are adjoint to each other.

Let formula_181 be an irreducible representation of formula_221 and let formula_2 be an irreducible representation of formula_258 then the Frobenius reciprocity tells us that formula_181 is contained in formula_231 as often as formula_724 is contained in formula_15

:Frobenius reciprocity. If formula_750 and formula_751 we have formula_752

This statement is also valid for the inner product.

===Mackey&#x27;s irreducibility criterion===
George Mackey established a criterion to verify the irreducibility of induced representations. For this we will first need some definitions and some specifications with respect to the notation.

Two representations formula_321 and formula_322 of a group formula_4 are called disjoint, if they have no irreducible component in common, i.e. if formula_756

Let formula_4 be a group and let formula_221 be a subgroup. We define formula_759 for formula_211 Let formula_761 be a representation of the subgroup formula_227 This defines by restriction a representation formula_763 of formula_764 We write formula_765 for formula_766 We also define another representation formula_767 of formula_768 by formula_769 These two representations are not to be confused.

:Mackey&#x27;s irreducibility criterion. The induced representation formula_770 is irreducible if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:
:* formula_181 is irreducible
:* For each formula_772 the two representations formula_767 and formula_765 of formula_768 are disjoint.

For the case of formula_221 normal, we have formula_777 and formula_778. Thus we obtain the following:

:Corollary. Let formula_221 be a normal subgroup of formula_13 Then formula_781 is irreducible if and only if formula_33 is irreducible and not isomorphic to the conjugates formula_767 for formula_784

===Applications to special groups===
In this section we present some applications of the so far presented theory to normal subgroups and to a special group, the semidirect product of a subgroup with an abelian normal subgroup.

:Proposition. Let formula_785 be a normal subgroup of the group formula_4 and let formula_113 be an irreducible representation of formula_13 Then one of the following statements has to be valid:
:* either there exists a proper subgroup formula_221 of formula_4 containing formula_785, and an irreducible representation formula_439 of formula_221 which induces formula_33,
:* or formula_2 is an isotypic formula_796-module.
:Proof. Consider formula_2 as a formula_796-module, and decompose it into isotypes as formula_799. If this decomposition is trivial, we are in the second case. Otherwise, the larger formula_4-action permutes these isotypic modules; because formula_2 is irreducible as a formula_802-module, the permutation action is transitive (in fact primitive). Fix any formula_803; the stabilizer in formula_4 of formula_805 is elementarily seen to exhibit the claimed properties.     formula_806

Note that if formula_785 is abelian, then the isotypic modules of formula_785 are irreducible, of degree one, and all homotheties.

We obtain also the following

:Corollary. Let formula_785 be an abelian normal subgroup of formula_4 and let formula_245 be any irreducible representation of formula_13 We denote with formula_813 the index of formula_785 in formula_13 Then formula_816[1]

If formula_785 is an abelian subgroup of formula_4 (not necessarily normal), generally formula_819 is not satisfied, but nevertheless formula_820 is still valid.

====Classification of representations of a semidirect product====
In the following, let formula_821 be a semidirect product such that the normal semidirect factor, formula_785, is abelian. The irreducible representations of such a group formula_258 can be classified by showing that all irreducible representations of formula_4 can be constructed from certain subgroups of formula_221. This is the so-called method of “little groups” of Wigner and Mackey.

Since formula_785 is abelian, the irreducible characters of formula_785 have degree one and form the group formula_828 The group formula_4 acts on formula_830 by formula_831 for formula_832

Let formula_833 be a representative system of the orbit of formula_221 in formula_835 For every formula_836 let formula_837 This is a subgroup of formula_227 Let formula_839 be the corresponding subgroup of formula_13 We now extend the function formula_539 onto formula_842 by formula_843 for formula_844 Thus, formula_539 is a class function on formula_846 Moreover, since formula_847 for all formula_848 it can be shown that formula_539 is a group homomorphism from formula_842 to formula_851 Therefore, we have a representation of formula_842 of degree one which is equal to its own character.

Let now formula_33 be an irreducible representation of formula_854 Then we obtain an irreducible representation formula_855 of formula_856 by combining formula_33 with the canonical projection formula_858 Finally, we construct the tensor product of formula_539 and formula_860 Thus, we obtain an irreducible representation formula_861 of formula_846

To finally obtain the classification of the irreducible representations of formula_4 we use the representation formula_864 of formula_258 which is induced by the tensor product formula_866 Thus, we achieve the following result:

:Proposition.
:* formula_864 is irreducible.
:* If formula_864 and formula_869 are isomorphic, then formula_870 and additionally formula_33 is isomorphic to formula_872
:* Every irreducible representation of formula_4 is isomorphic to one of the formula_874

Amongst others, the criterion of Mackey and a conclusion based on the Frobenius reciprocity are needed for the proof of the proposition. Further details may be found in [1].

In other words, we classified all irreducible representations of formula_875

==Representation ring==
The representation ring of formula_4 is defined as the abelian group
:formula_877
With the multiplication provided by the tensor product, formula_878 becomes a ring. The elements of formula_878 are called virtual representations.

The character defines a ring homomorphism in the set of all class functions on formula_4 with complex values

:formula_881

in which the formula_539 are the irreducible characters corresponding to the formula_402

Because a representation is determined by its character, formula_586 is injective. The images of formula_586 are called virtual characters.

As the irreducible characters form an orthonormal basis of formula_886 induces an isomorphism
:formula_887
This isomorphism is defined on a basis out of elementary tensors formula_888 by formula_889 respectively formula_890 and extended bilinearly.

We write formula_891 for the set of all characters of formula_4 and formula_893 to denote the group generated by formula_894 i.e. the set of all differences of two characters. It then holds that formula_895 and formula_896 Thus, we have formula_897 and the virtual characters correspond to the virtual representations in an optimal manner.

Since formula_898 holds, formula_893 is the set of all virtual characters. As the product of two characters provides another character, formula_893 is a subring of the ring formula_901 of all class functions on formula_13 Because the formula_903 form a basis of formula_518 we obtain, just as in the case of formula_905 an isomorphism formula_906

Let formula_221 be a subgroup of formula_13 The restriction thus defines a ring homomorphism formula_909 which will be denoted by formula_910 or formula_911 Likewise, the induction on class functions defines a homomorphism of abelian groups formula_912 which will be written as formula_913 or in short formula_914

According to the Frobenius reciprocity, these two homomorphisms are adjoint with respect to the bilinear forms formula_915 and formula_916 Furthermore, the formula formula_917 shows that the image of formula_918 is an ideal of the ring formula_919

By the restriction of representations, the map formula_740 can be defined analogously for formula_905 and by the induction we obtain the map formula_741 for formula_923 Due to the Frobenius reciprocity, we get the result that these maps are adjoint to each other and that the image formula_924 is an ideal of the ring formula_923

If formula_785 is a commutative ring, the homomorphisms formula_740 and formula_741 may be extended to formula_785–linear maps:
:formula_930

in which formula_931 are all the irreducible representations of formula_221 up to isomorphism.

With formula_933 we obtain in particular that formula_741 and formula_740 supply homomorphisms between formula_518 and formula_937

Let formula_305 and formula_939 be two groups with respective representations formula_940 and formula_941 Then, formula_357 is the representation of the direct product formula_356 as was shown in a previous section. Another result of that section was that all irreducible representations of formula_356 are exactly the representations formula_945 where formula_946 and formula_947 are irreducible representations of formula_305 and formula_306 respectively. This passes over to the representation ring as the identity formula_950 in which formula_951 is the tensor product of the representation rings as formula_952–modules.

==Induction theorems==

Induction theorems relate the representation ring of a given finite group &quot;G&quot; to representation rings of a family &quot;X&quot; consisting of some subsets &quot;H&quot; of &quot;G&quot;. More precisely, for such a collection of subgroups, the induction functor yields a map 
:formula_953; induction theorems give criteria for the surjectivity of this map or closely related ones.
&quot;Artin&#x27;s induction theorem&quot; is the most elementary theorem in this group of results. It asserts that the following are equivalent:

* The cokernel of formula_540 is finite.
* formula_4 is the union of the conjugates of the subgroups belonging to formula_956 i.e. formula_957

Since formula_893 is finitely generated as a group, the first point can be rephrased as follows:
*For each character formula_586 of formula_258 there exist virtual characters formula_961 and an integer formula_962 such that formula_963
 gives two proofs of this theorem. For example, since &quot;G&quot; is the union of its cyclic subgroups, every character of formula_4 is a linear combination with rational coefficients of characters induced by characters of cyclic subgroups of formula_13 Since the representations of cyclic groups are well-understood, in particular the irreducible representations are one-dimensional, this gives a certain control over representations of &quot;G&quot;.

Under the above circumstances, it is not in general true that formula_540 is surjective. &quot;Brauer&#x27;s induction theorem&quot; asserts that formula_540 is surjective, provided that &quot;X&quot; is the family of all &quot;elementary subgroups&quot;.
Here a group &quot;H&quot; is elementary if there is some prime &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;H&quot; is the direct product of a cyclic group of order prime to formula_968 and a formula_968–group.
In other words, every character of formula_4 is a linear combination with integer coefficients of characters induced by characters of elementary subgroups.
The elementary subgroups &quot;H&quot; arising in Brauer&#x27;s theorem have a richer representation theory than cyclic groups, they at least have the property that any irreducible representation for such &quot;H&quot; is induced by a one-dimensional representation of a (necessarily also elementary) subgroup formula_971. (This latter property can be shown to hold for any supersolvable group, which includes nilpotent groups and, in particular, elementary groups.) This ability to induce representations from degree 1 representations has some further consequences in the representation theory of finite groups.

==Real representations==
For proofs and more information about representations over general subfields of formula_131 please refer to [2].

If a group formula_4 acts on a real vector space formula_974 the corresponding representation on the complex vector space formula_975 is called real (formula_2 is called the complexification of formula_977). The corresponding representation mentioned above is given by formula_978 for all formula_979

Let formula_33 be a real representation. The linear map formula_31 is formula_982-valued for all formula_173 Thus, we can conclude that the character of a real representation is always real-valued. But not every representation with a real-valued character is real. To make this clear, let formula_4 be a finite, non-abelian subgroup of the group

:formula_985

Then formula_986 acts on formula_987 Since the trace of any matrix in formula_988 is real, the character of the representation is real-valued. Suppose formula_33 is a real representation, then formula_990 would consist only of real-valued matrices. Thus, formula_991 However the circle group is abelian but formula_4 was chosen to be a non-abelian group. Now we only need to prove the existence of a non-abelian, finite subgroup of formula_993 To find such a group, observe that formula_988 can be identified with the units of the quaternions. Now let formula_995 The following two-dimensional representation of formula_4 is not real-valued, but has a real-valued character:
:formula_997
Then the image of formula_33 is not real-valued, but nevertheless it is a subset of formula_993 Thus, the character of the representation is real.

:Lemma. An irreducible representation formula_2 of formula_4 is real if and only if there exists a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form formula_1002 on formula_2 preserved by formula_13

An irreducible representation of formula_4 on a real vector space can become reducible when extending the field to formula_1 For example, the following real representation of the cyclic group is reducible when considered over formula_163
:formula_1008
Therefore, by classifying all the irreducible representations that are real over formula_1009 we still haven&#x27;t classified all the irreducible real representations. But we achieve the following:

Let formula_977 be a real vector space. Let formula_4 act irreducibly on formula_977 and let formula_1013 If formula_2 is not irreducible, there are exactly two irreducible factors which are complex conjugate representations of formula_13

Definition. A quaternionic representation is a (complex) representation formula_183 which possesses a formula_4–invariant anti-linear homomorphism formula_1018 satisfying formula_1019 Thus, a skew-symmetric, nondegenerate formula_4–invariant bilinear form defines a quaternionic structure on formula_15

:Theorem. An irreducible representation formula_2 is one and only one of the following:
:: (i) complex: formula_1023 is not real-valued and there exists no formula_4–invariant nondegenerate bilinear form on formula_15
:: (ii) real: formula_1026 a real representation; formula_2 has a formula_4–invariant nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form.
:: (iii) quaternionic: formula_1023 is real, but formula_2 is not real; formula_2 has a formula_4–invariant skew-symmetric nondegenerate bilinear form.

==Representations of particular groups==
===Symmetric groups===
Representation of the symmetric groups formula_1033 have been intensely studied. Conjugacy classes in formula_1033 (and therefore, by the above, irreducible representations) correspond to partitions of &quot;n&quot;. For example, formula_1035 has three irreducible representations, corresponding to the partitions

:3; 2+1; 1+1+1

of 3. For such a partition, a Young tableau is a graphical device depicting a partition. The irreducible representation corresponding to such a partition (or Young tableau) is called a Specht module.

Representations of different symmetric groups are related: any representation of formula_1036 yields a representation of formula_1037 by induction, and vice versa by restriction. The direct sum of all these representation rings

:formula_1038

inherits from these constructions the structure of a Hopf algebra which, it turns out, is closely related to symmetric functions.

===Finite groups of Lie type===

To a certain extent, the representations of the formula_1039 , as &quot;n&quot; varies, have a similar flavor as for the formula_1033; the above-mentioned induction process gets replaced by so-called parabolic induction. However, unlike for formula_1033, where all representations can be obtained by induction of trivial representations, this is not true for formula_1039. Instead, new building blocks, known as cuspidal representations, are needed.

Representations of formula_1039 and more generally, representations of finite groups of Lie type have been thoroughly studied. describes the representations of formula_1044. A geometric description of irreducible representations of such groups, including the above-mentioned cuspidal representations, is obtained by Deligne-Lusztig theory, which constructs such representation in the l-adic cohomology of Deligne-Lusztig varieties.

The similarity of the representation theory of formula_1033 and formula_1039 goes beyond finite groups. The philosophy of cusp forms highlights the kinship of representation theoretic aspects of these types of groups with general linear groups of local fields such as Q&quot;p&quot; and of the ring of adeles, see .

==Outlook—Representations of compact groups==
The theory of representations of compact groups may be, to some degree, extended to locally compact groups. The representation theory unfolds in this context great importance for harmonic analysis and the study of automorphic forms. For proofs, further information and for a more detailed insight which is beyond the scope of this chapter please consult [4] and [5].

===Definition and properties===
A topological group is a group together with a topology with respect to which the group composition and the inversion are continuous.
Such a group is called compact, if any cover of formula_258 which is open in the topology, has a finite subcover. Closed subgroups of a compact group are compact again.

Let formula_4 be a compact group and let formula_2 be a finite-dimensional formula_163–vector space. A linear representation of formula_4 to formula_2 is a continuous group homomorphism formula_1053 i.e. formula_1054 is a continuous function in the two variables formula_117 and formula_1056

A linear representation of formula_4 into a Banach space formula_2 is defined to be a continuous group homomorphism of formula_4 into the set of all bijective bounded linear operators on formula_2 with a continuous inverse. Since formula_1061 we can do without the last requirement. In the following, we will consider in particular representations of compact groups in Hilbert spaces.

Just as with finite groups, we can define the group algebra and the convolution algebra. However, the group algebra provides no helpful information in the case of infinite groups, because the continuity condition gets lost during the construction. Instead the convolution algebra formula_135 takes its place.

Most properties of representations of finite groups can be transferred with appropriate changes to compact groups. For this we need a counterpart to the summation over a finite group:

===Existence and uniqueness of the Haar measure=== 
On a compact group formula_4 there exists exactly one measure formula_1064 such that:
* It is a left-translation-invariant measure
::formula_1065
* The whole group has unit measure:
::formula_1066
Such a left-translation-invariant, normed measure is called Haar measure of the group formula_13

Since formula_4 is compact, it is possible to show that this measure is also right-translation-invariant, i.e. it also applies

:formula_1069

By the scaling above the Haar measure on a finite group is given by formula_1070 for all formula_173

All the definitions to representations of finite groups that are mentioned in the section ”Properties”, also apply to representations of compact groups. But there are some modifications needed:

To define a subrepresentation we now need a closed subspace. This was not necessary for finite-dimensional representation spaces, because in this case every subspace is already closed. Furthermore, two representations formula_1072 of a compact group formula_4 are called equivalent, if there exists a bijective, continuous, linear operator formula_176 between the representation spaces whose inverse is also continuous and which satisfies formula_1075 for all formula_173

If formula_176 is unitary, the two representations are called unitary equivalent.

To obtain a formula_4–invariant inner product from a not formula_4–invariant, we now have to use the integral over formula_4 instead of the sum. If formula_1081 is an inner product on a Hilbert space formula_183 which is not invariant with respect to the representation formula_33 of formula_258 then

:formula_1085

is a formula_4–invariant inner product on formula_2 due to the properties of the Haar measure formula_1088 Thus, we can assume every representation on a Hilbert space to be unitary.

Let formula_4 be a compact group and let formula_173 Let formula_1091 be the Hilbert space of the square integrable functions on formula_13 We define the operator formula_1093 on this space by formula_1094 where formula_1095

The map formula_1096 is a unitary representation of formula_13 It is called left-regular representation. The right-regular representation is defined similarly. As the Haar measure of formula_4 is also right-translation-invariant, the operator formula_1099 on formula_1091 is given by formula_1101 The right-regular representation is then the unitary representation given by formula_1102 The two representations formula_1096 and formula_1104 are dual to each other.

If formula_4 is infinite, these representations have no finite degree. The left- and right-regular representation as defined at the beginning are isomorphic to the left- and right-regular representation as defined above, if the group formula_4 is finite. This is due to the fact that in this case formula_1107

===Constructions and decompositions===
The different ways of constructing new representations from given ones can be used for compact groups as well, except for the dual representation with which we will deal later. The direct sum and the tensor product with a finite number of summands/factors are defined in exactly the same way as for finite groups. This is also the case for the symmetric and alternating square. However, we need a Haar measure on the direct product of compact groups in order to extend the theorem saying that the irreducible representations of the product of two groups are (up to isomorphism) exactly the tensor product of the irreducible representations of the factor groups. First, we note that the direct product formula_356 of two compact groups is again a compact group when provided with the product topology. The Haar measure on the direct product is then given by the product of the Haar measures on the factor groups.

For the dual representation on compact groups we require the topological dual formula_701 of the vector space formula_15 This is the vector space of all continuous linear functionals from the vector space formula_2 into the base field. Let formula_155 be a representation of a compact group formula_4 in formula_15

The dual representation formula_1115 is defined by the property

:formula_1116

Thus, we can conclude that the dual representation is given by formula_1117 for all formula_1118 The map formula_1119 is again a continuous group homomorphism and thus a representation.

On Hilbert spaces: formula_155 is irreducible if and only if formula_1119 is irreducible.

By transferring the results of the section decompositions to compact groups, we obtain the following theorems:

:Theorem. Every irreducible representation formula_1122 of a compact group into a Hilbert space is finite-dimensional and there exists an inner product on formula_1123 such that formula_245 is unitary. Since the Haar measure is normalized, this inner product is unique.

Every representation of a compact group is isomorphic to a direct Hilbert sum of irreducible representations.

Let formula_243 be a unitary representation of the compact group formula_13 Just as for finite groups we define for an irreducible representation formula_1127 the isotype or isotypic component in formula_33 to be the subspace

:formula_1129

This is the sum of all invariant closed subspaces formula_1130 which are formula_4–isomorphic to formula_1132

Note that the isotypes of not equivalent irreducible representations are pairwise orthogonal.

:Theorem.
::(i) formula_248 is a closed invariant subspace of formula_637
::(ii) formula_248 is formula_4–isomorphic to the direct sum of copies of formula_1132
::(iii) Canonical decomposition: formula_1138 is the direct Hilbert sum of the isotypes formula_1139 in which formula_245 passes through all the isomorphism classes of the irreducible representations.

The corresponding projection to the canonical decomposition formula_1141 in which formula_582 is an isotype of formula_183 is for compact groups given by
:formula_1144
where formula_1145 and formula_1146 is the character corresponding to the irreducible representation formula_251

====Projection formula==== 
For every representation formula_1148 of a compact group formula_4 we define

:formula_1150

In general formula_406 is not formula_4–linear. Let

: formula_1153

The map formula_409 is defined as endomorphism on formula_2 by having the property

:formula_1156

which is valid for the inner product of the Hilbert space formula_15

Then formula_409 is formula_4–linear, because of
:formula_1160
where we used the invariance of the Haar measure.

:Proposition. The map formula_409 is a projection from formula_2 to formula_414

If the representation is finite-dimensional, it is possible to determine the direct sum of the trivial subrepresentation just as in the case of finite groups.

===Characters, Schur&#x27;s lemma and the inner product===
Generally, representations of compact groups are investigated on Hilbert- and Banach spaces. In most cases they are not finite-dimensional. Therefore, it is not useful to refer to characters when speaking about representations of compact groups. Nevertheless, in most cases it is possible to restrict the study to the case of finite dimensions:

Since irreducible representations of compact groups are finite-dimensional and unitary (see results from the first subsection), we can define irreducible characters in the same way as it was done for finite groups.

As long as the constructed representations stay finite-dimensional, the characters of the newly constructed representations may be obtained in the same way as for finite groups.

Schur&#x27;s lemma is also valid for compact groups:

Let formula_1164 be an irreducible unitary representation of a compact group formula_13 Then every bounded operator formula_1166 satisfying the property formula_1167 for all formula_1168 is a scalar multiple of the identity, i.e. there exists formula_1169 such that formula_1170

Definition. The formula
:formula_1171
defines an inner product on the set of all square integrable functions formula_1091 of a compact group formula_13 Likewise 
:formula_1174
defines a bilinear form on formula_1091 of a compact group formula_13

The bilinear form on the representation spaces is defined exactly as it was for finite groups and analogous to finite groups the following results are therefore valid:

:Theorem. Let formula_586 and formula_1178 be the characters of two non-isomorphic irreducible representations formula_2 and formula_1180 respectively. Then the following is valid 
:*formula_1181
:*formula_1182 i.e. formula_586 has &quot;norm&quot; formula_622

:Theorem. Let formula_2 be a representation of formula_4 with character formula_1187 Suppose formula_181 is an irreducible representation of formula_4 with character formula_1190 The number of subrepresentations of formula_2 equivalent to formula_181 is independent of any given decomposition for formula_2 and is equal to the inner product formula_1194

:Irreducibility Criterion. Let formula_586 be the character of the representation formula_183 then formula_1197 is a positive integer. Moreover formula_589 if and only if formula_2 is irreducible.

Therefore, using the first theorem, the characters of irreducible representations of formula_4 form an orthonormal set on formula_1091 with respect to this inner product.

:Corollary. Every irreducible representation formula_2 of formula_4 is contained formula_1204–times in the left-regular representation.

:Lemma. Let formula_4 be a compact group. Then the following statements are equivalent:
:* formula_4 is abelian.
:* All the irreducible representations of formula_4 have degree formula_622

:Orthonormal Property. Let formula_4 be a group. The non-isomorphic irreducible representations of formula_4 form an orthonormal basis in formula_1091 with respect to this inner product.

As we already know that the non-isomorphic irreducible representations are orthonormal, we only need to verify that they generate formula_1212 This may be done, by proving that there exists no non-zero square integrable function on formula_4 orthogonal to all the irreducible characters.

Just as in the case of finite groups, the number of the irreducible representations up to isomorphism of a group formula_4 equals the number of conjugacy classes of formula_13 However, because a compact group has in general infinitely many conjugacy classes, this does not provide any useful information.

===The induced representation===
If formula_221 is a closed subgroup of finite index in a compact group formula_258 the definition of the induced representation for finite groups may be adopted.

However, the induced representation can be defined more generally, so that the definition is valid independent of the index of the subgroup formula_227

For this purpose let formula_1219 be a unitary representation of the closed subgroup formula_227 The continuous induced representation formula_1221 is defined as follows:

Let formula_1222 denote the Hilbert space of all measurable, square integrable functions formula_1223 with the property formula_1224 for all formula_1225 The norm is given by

:formula_1226

and the representation formula_1227 is given as the right-translation: formula_1228

The induced representation is then again a unitary representation.

Since formula_4 is compact, the induced representation can be decomposed into the direct sum of irreducible representations of formula_13 Note that all irreducible representations belonging to the same isotype appear with a multiplicity equal to formula_1231

Let formula_16 be a representation of formula_258 then there exists a canonical isomorphism
:formula_1234

The Frobenius reciprocity transfers, together with the modified definitions of the inner product and of the bilinear form, to compact groups. The theorem now holds for square integrable functions on formula_4 instead of class functions, but the subgroup formula_221 must be closed.

===The Peter-Weyl Theorem===

Another important result in the representation theory of compact groups is the Peter-Weyl Theorem. It is usually presented and proven in harmonic analysis, as it represents one of its central and fundamental statements.

:The Peter-Weyl Theorem. Let formula_4 be a compact group. For every irreducible representation formula_1127 of formula_4 let formula_1240 be an orthonormal basis of formula_1132 We define the &quot;matrix coefficients&quot; formula_1242 for formula_1243 Then we have the following orthonormal basis of formula_1091:
::formula_1245

We can reformulate this theorem to obtain a generalization of the Fourier series for functions on compact groups:

:The Peter-Weyl Theorem (Second version). There exists a natural formula_1246–isomorphism 
::formula_1247
:in which formula_1248 is the set of all irreducible representations of formula_4 up to isomorphism and formula_1123 is the representation space corresponding to formula_251 More concretely:
::formula_1252

==History==
The general features of the representation theory of a finite group &quot;G&quot;, over the complex numbers, were discovered by Ferdinand Georg Frobenius in the years before 1900. Later the modular representation theory of Richard Brauer was developed.

<doc id="874401" wikidata="Q727006" url="?curid=874401" title="Béla Imrédy">
<text>Béla [[vitéz]] Imrédy de Ómoravicza (; 29 December 1891 in Budapest – 28 February 1946 in Budapest) was Prime Minister of Hungary from 1938 to 1939.

Born in Budapest to a Catholic family, Imrédy studied law as a young man before he started working for the Hungarian Ministry of Finance. Eventually becoming a skilled economist and financier, Imrédy was made Director of the Hungarian National Bank in 1928. In 1932, he was appointed Minister of Finance under the fascist Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös. After resigning in 1935, Imrédy became President of the Hungarian National Bank. Extremely ambitious, Imrédy was known to hold right wing views on matters of domestic and social policy. On matters of foreign policy, Imrédy was pro-British, a sentiment which was to help him gain the position of Minister of Economic Coordination under Prime Minister Kálmán Darányi. When Darányi resigned in May 1938, Imrédy was appointed prime minister by Regent Miklós Horthy. Imrédy&#x27;s attempts to improve Hungary&#x27;s diplomatic relations with Britain initially made him very unpopular with Germany and Italy. Imrédy realized that he could not afford to alienate the two fascist powers on a long term basis, however, and from the autumn of 1938 onward his foreign policy became increasingly pro-German and pro-Italian. Imrédy also worked to gain a base of power in Hungarian right wing politics, founding the Movement of Hungarian Life. He was quick to suppress any rivals in his quest for power, and influential fascists such as Ferenc Szálasi were harassed by Imrédy&#x27;s administration. As Imrédy drifted further to the right, he proposed that the government be reorganized along totalitarian lines and enacted legislation that restricted the freedom of the press and caused many Jews to suffer economically.

In February 1939, Imrédy&#x27;s moderate political opponents, angered at his growing compliancy to Germany and Hungary&#x27;s right wing, presented evidence to Regent Horthy that suggested Imrédy&#x27;s great-grandfather was Jewish. When Horthy confronted Imrédy with the evidence, Imrédy could not deny the claims about his heritage and resigned the premiership on 13 February 1939. Imrédy served in the Hungarian Army for a time in 1940, and in October of that year he founded the pro-fascist, Anti-Semitic Party of Hungarian Renewal. When German troops occupied Hungary in 1944, Imrédy was German Plenipotentiary Edmund Veesenmayer’s top choice to replace Miklós Kállay as prime minister. Horthy could not be swayed to accept the idea, however, and Döme Sztójay was made prime minister instead. Imrédy became Sztójay&#x27;s Minister of Economic Coordination in May 1944, but he was forced to resign in August. After German forces were driven out of Hungary, Imrédy was arrested and tried by a People&#x27;s Tribunal in November 1945. Found guilty of war crimes and collaboration with the Nazis, he was sentenced to death and executed by a firing squad in the courtyard of the jail in Markó street, Budapest, in 1946.

<text>A W16 engine is a sixteen-cylinder piston engine with four banks of four cylinders in a W configuration.

W16 engines are rarely produced, with the notable exception of the Volkswagen Group 8.0 WR16 engine, which has been used since 2005 in the Bugatti Veyron, Bugatti Chiron and their related models.

== Volkswagen Group ==

The W16 engine that Volkswagen Group uses in its Bugatti Veyron and Chiron has a displacement of and four turbochargers. It is effectively two narrow-angle VR8 engines (based on the VR6 design) mated at an included angle of 90 degrees on a common crankshaft.

The most powerful version of this engine, installed in the Bugatti Bolide, generates at 7,000 rpm.

At the 1999 Geneva Auto Salon, Bentley presented Hunaudières, a concept two-seated mid-engined car with an 8-litre W16 engine. The engine was the basis for the Bugatti Veyron.

Another concept car from Volkswagen Group to have the W16 engine is the Audi Rosemeyer, introduced in 2000 and shown at various auto salons. The engine fitted to Rosemeyer is the only W16 variation to have five valves per cylinder.

== Other manufacturers ==
In 1916, a rotary valve W16 engine was built in France by Gaston Mougeotte.

The Jimenez Novia, a one-off sports car built in 1995, used a W16 engine with two crankshafts. Built by combining four Yamaha FZR1000 inline-four motorcycle engines, the engine has a displacement of , eight camshafts and five valves per cylinder, and produces .

<text>The Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) is the permanent organizational assembly of the Catholic bishops of the Philippines exercising together certain pastoral offices for the Christian faithful of their territory through apostolic plans, programs and projects suited to the circumstances of time and place in accordance with law for the promotion of the greater good offered by the Catholic Church to all people.

It has 90 active and 40 honorary bishops and other members. The chancery is centrally located within the Intramuros district, located just behind the Manila Cathedral.

Kalookan bishop Pablo Virgilio David is the president .

It is the Plenary Assembly which elects through direct vote the officers of the Conference, composed of the following: President, Vice-President, Secretary General and Treasurer. It is likewise the Plenary Assembly which elects the members of the Permanent Council, the Chairmen of the Episcopal Commissions and the heads of the agencies attached to the Conference.

The Plenary Assembly meets in regular session twice a year: in January and in July. When the Plenary Assembly is not in session, the Permanent Council acts for and in behalf of the Conference.

The Permanent Council is composed of a chairman, Vice-Chairman, and ten regional representatives (five for Luzon, two for Visayas and three for Mindanao).

The President of the CBCP serves for a term of two years, and is limited to only two consecutive terms. The members of the Permanent Council, on the other hand, have a term of two years but are allowed a cumulative number of up to four terms. They may not, however, serve for more than two consecutive terms in succession.

==Permanent Council==
Bishops convene as a Plenary Assembly on a regular basis only twice a year. When the Plenary Assembly is not in session, it is the Permanent Council which acts for and on behalf of all the bishops.

The Permanent Council, composed of ten elected members representing the Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao regions, acts in accordance with the Constitution and By-Laws of the CBCP, and the policies and standing decisions of the Plenary Assembly.

The Council may be convened by the President at any time for the discharge of its regular functions or for special purposes. However, when the Council cannot have a quorum, the members present, together with other CBCP members available, may also act for and in behalf of the Conference.

The Permanent Council&#x27;s regular functions include ensuring that the decisions made during the Plenary Assembly are properly executed and directing the activities of the Office and other agencies of the Conference. It is also tasked to prepare the agenda for the meetings of the Plenary Assembly and examine and approve the Conference&#x27;s annual budget, prior to submission and final approval of the Plenary Assembly.

==Philippine politics==

The episcopal conference expressed dismay (July 6, 2007) over the conduct of the May 14, 2007, midterm elections, saying &quot;the challenge of credible, honest, meaningful and peaceful polls remains&quot;. CBCP president Lagdameo lamented that &quot;vote-buying and other anomalies have already become systematic and even cultural.&quot; He stressed that election watchdogs, including the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV), noted that the problem no longer lies in the voters but the voting system itself and the irresponsibility of some election officials. PPCRV chairman Henrietta de Villa told the bishops that last May&#x27;s elections merely repeated the unresolved poll fraud issues in the 2004 race between Arroyo and the late Fernando Poe Jr. Lagdameo promised that they would come up with a full assessment of the conduct of the May 14 midterm elections at the conclusion of the assembly (July 9). The CBCP is also expected to discuss other pertinent issues, including extrajudicial killings of activists and journalists as well as the implementation of the new Anti-Terror Law.

Lagdameo asked the government to review the controversial anti-terror law, fearing it could be abused. The CBCP warned that the Human Security Act may be used by authorities to quell popular dissent against the government of Mrs. Arroyo. The CBCP, in a press conference, further called for a change of leadership at the Commission on Elections as it noted the &quot;continuing dominance&quot; of political dynasties, dagdag-bawas, and poll violence. Demanding &quot;full revamp of the Comelec&quot;, it sought for the appointment of people with &quot;unquestioned integrity and competence, especially in systems and management&quot; to succeed Chair Abalos and the five other members. There should also be &quot;serious efforts to de-politicize and professionalize the bureaucracy,&quot; the CBCP said in a two-page pastoral statement read by its president Angel Lagdameo. Its call came after the vote of the 85-bishop CBCP during their two-day plenary assembly. Meanwhile, Comelec Commissioner Rene Sarmiento urged the early nomination process (which must be transparent and should involve the electorate) for the four poll commissioners. The terms of office of Chair Abalos and Commissioners Tuason and Borra would end in February next year, with an existing vacancy at the Comelec.

On December 17, 2007, in a statement on the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) website, Pampanga archbishop Paciano Aniceto stated that Pope Benedict XVI assured Filipinos that God and the church are still with them – in his encyclical &quot;Spe Salvi facti sumus (In hope we are saved).&quot; Also, Manila auxiliary bishop Broderick Pabillo was appointed the new chair of the Episcopal Commission on Social Action and Peace and the National Action for Social Justice and Peace (Nassa), the CBCP&#x27;s social arm, replacing Marbel bishop Dinualdo Gutierrez.

On January 7, 2008, Bishop Leonardo Medroso, chairman of the CBCP Episcopal Commission on Canon Law and bishop of Tagbilaran diocese, Bohol, issued the appeal to priests to stay away from politics, ahead of the May 2010 elections. He cited Code of Canon Law, prohibition, Canon 287, which forbids all clerics from entering politics and that priests &quot;cannot have an active role in political parties unless the need to protect the rights of the church or to promote the common good.&quot; Three priests—Crisanto de la Cruz, Ronilo Maat Omanio and Ed Panlilio—who ran in the last elections were suspended from their pastoral duties as a result of their entry into the political arena. Only Panlilio won.

On January 19, 2008, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (quoting from a letter of Vatican Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone) announced that Pope Benedict XVI &quot;praised the courage of, and was saddened over the brutal and tragic killing of Reynaldo Roda in his ministry as head of Notre Dame School.&quot; The Pope wrote Jolo Bishop Angelito Lampon: &quot;calls upon the perpetrators to renounce the ways of violence and to play their part in building a just and peaceful society, where all can live together in harmony.&quot;

Church insiders reported that the CBCP was still ruled by conservatives, amid renewed calls for Mrs. Arroyo&#x27;s resignation. Bishops therefore, failed to join these clamors, since the President &quot;continues to wield influence over a good number of CBCP members&quot;.

== Positions ==

=== HIV/AIDS ===
In 2015, the head of CBCP&#x27;s Episcopal Commission on Health Care, Dan Vicente Cancino, explained that the rise of HIV/AIDS cases in the Philippines due to Filipinos believing to &quot;distorted concept of sexuality&quot; due to lack of &quot;family values formation&quot;. He urged Filipinos to adhere to traditional Filipino values and live a life of prayer.

The Rise of HIV/AIDS cases in the Philippines, as much as Ten people per day, has been attributed to the CBCP&#x27;s stance against reproductive health education and condom use.

=== Philippine Anti-discrimination Bill ===
In December 2011, the CBCP reportedly urged the Philippine Senate not to pass the Bill 2814 known as &quot;Anti-Ethnic, Racial or Religious Discrimination and Profiling Act of 2011&quot; or &quot;Anti-discrimination Bill&quot;. CBCP legal counsel Roland Reyes stated that he believes that the bill is a precursor for the passage of a same sex marriage bill in the country. Another CBCP legal counsel, Jo Imbong, questioned protecting homosexuals because she considers homosexuality to be a choice of the individual. The CBCP sees the Anti-discrimination bill as a challenge to religious freedom, but the CBCP stated that it supports the bill as long as it rejects second class treatment for the LGBT community.

== Controversies ==

===PCSO controversy===
The CBCP was embroiled in a controversy in 2011 over millions of pesos in donations from the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office at the behest of then president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. According to a Commission on Audit report in 2009, some bishops received donations for the purchase of vehicles from the PCSO.

Critics claim the donations was given to ensure church support for Arroyo, who was then buffeted by scandals and repeated threats of impeachment. The bishops were tagged as &quot;Pajero bishops&quot; as it was alleged that they received Pajero vehicles.

Cardinal Orlando Quevedo, Archbishop of Cotabato, explained that they asked for donations from the government because they are from &quot;the provinces that have some of the most difficult areas that we have.&quot; He added that it is their duty to help the people from those provinces with the use of their resources and that &quot;when we lack resources, we seek the assistance from others.&quot;

The bishops were summoned during the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee investigation on the anomalies within the PCSO, with the bishops returning the vehicles donated to them. The CBCP Permanent Council also conducted its own investigation regarding the controversy. Senator Teofisto Guingona, chairman of the Blue Ribbon Committee, said that since the vehicles were used for secular purposes, the donation is not considered as a violation of the Constitution, but added that the issue was a &quot;litmus test to the Constitution&quot; since the Constitution prohibits favoring a particular religious organization. Senator Juan Ponce Enrile said that the tag &quot;Pajero bishops&quot; were unfair since the bishops did not receive expensive vehicles and said that the PCSO leadership must be blamed for the controversy.

=== Pedophilia ===
Shay Cullen, founder of the &quot;People&#x27;s Recovery Empowerment Development Assistance Foundation&quot;, accused CBCP members of covering up cases of sexual abuse and misconduct.

In year 2002, CBCP apologized for the cases of sexual abuse and misconduct that were committed by its priests. CBCP admitted that around 200 priests have been involved in various cases of sexual misconducts, not limited only to pedophilia, for time period of 20 years.
According to one report, cases of pedophilia in the Philippines were settled out of courts, with the convicted members of clergy being transferred to another parishes by their Bishops. Several cases of pedophilia have been reported with some still pending trial.

==John Mary Vianney Galilee Development and Retreat Center for Priests==
In 1991, at the Second Plenary Council of the Philippines (PCP II), the CBCP decided to build a national center for the ongoing renewal and rehabilitation of clergy, to operate under the CBCP&#x27;s Episcopal Commission on Clergy.

The John Mary Vianney Galilee Development and Retreat Center for Priests, a 54-room institution would be inaugurated on August 15, 2007 by Manila Archbishop Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales. The center would also accommodate clergy who were &quot;exiled&quot; for sexual misconduct including pedophilia and siring children.

<text>Döme Sztójay (, 5 January 1883 – 22 August 1946) was a Hungarian soldier and diplomat of Serb origin, who served as Prime Minister of Hungary in 1944, during World War II.

== Biography ==
Born in Versec (modern-day Vršac) into a Serb family as Dimitrije Stojaković (), Sztójay joined the Austro-Hungarian Army as a young man and served as a colonel during World War I. After the war, Sztójay served in Admiral Miklós Horthy’s counter-revolutionary Royal Hungarian Army, specializing in counter-espionage. After Horthy became Regent of Hungary, Sztójay was promoted to general and served as a military attaché in Berlin from 1927 to 1933. He Magyarized his name to Sztójay in 1927. From 1933 to 1935, Sztójay served in the Ministry of Defence. In 1935, Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös named Sztójay as Hungarian ambassador to Germany, a position he would hold until 1944. As ambassador, Sztójay formed strong ties with the Third Reich and often voiced support for German policies to his superiors in Hungary.

In Operation Margarethe in March 1944, the German Army occupied Hungary and forced Horthy to remove Prime Minister Miklós Kállay from office. Kállay, like Horthy, knew that Germany was losing the war, and had put out numerous feelers to the West. On 9 September 1943 László Veress, an employee of the Ministry of Exterior signed a secret agreement to surrender unconditionally to the Western Allies. Although Kállay and his government had promised on numerous occasions to surrender to the Western Allies as soon as they reached Hungary, Veress&#x27; agreement was unauthorized, as in Kállay&#x27;s consideration it effectively gave up Hungary&#x27;s sovereignty.

Nevertheless, the agreement didn&#x27;t sit well with Berlin. When they took over the country, the Germans gave Horthy a choice between choosing a new prime minister who would cooperate with the Germans or undisguised occupation. Knowing that the latter would likely mean a Gauleiter who would treat Hungary in the same manner as the other Nazi-occupied countries, Horthy chose the former. The German Plenipotentiary for Hungary, Edmund Veesenmayer, proposed that Horthy reappoint Béla Imrédy, who had been prime minister earlier in the war (and who had, ironically, a Jewish great-grandfather). However, Horthy balked at appointing the strongly pro-German Imrédy and suggested Sztójay instead. Though Sztójay had been ambassador to Berlin for a decade and was known to be pro-German, Horthy believed that at bottom he was a soldier first and would not totally give in to German demands. The Germans readily approved of Horthy&#x27;s choice, and on 23 March 1944, Sztójay was appointed prime minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

As prime minister, Sztójay legalized Ferenc Szálasi’s Arrow Cross Party, increased Hungarian troop levels on the Eastern Front, dissolved the nation&#x27;s labor unions, jailed political opponents, and cracked down on left wing politicians and activists. He also significantly ramped up the pace of forced deportations of Hungarian Jews, but at the same time tried to reduce the consequences. Horthy quickly became appalled by Sztójay&#x27;s actions and demanded his removal as prime minister, but Veesenmayer, backed by Adolf Hitler, sternly refused to do so. Horthy refused to give in entirely, however, and used his influence to stop the deportations of Hungary&#x27;s Jews and to force Imrédy out of Sztójay&#x27;s cabinet. The Germans finally submitted to Horthy&#x27;s pressure in August 1944 and Sztójay resigned as prime minister in favour of Géza Lakatos.

When Horthy was removed from power by the Germans in October 1944, Sztójay was not reappointed prime minister due to poor health. Sztójay subsequently fled Hungary when the Germans were driven out of the country by the Red Army in April 1945. Sztójay was later captured by American troops and extradited to Hungary in October 1945, after which time he was tried by a People&#x27;s Tribunal in Budapest. He was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against the Hungarian people, sentenced to death, and executed by a firing squad in Budapest in 1946.

<text>is a Japanese department store chain, principally located in the Kansai region of Japan. The chain is operated by Daimaru Matsuzakaya Department Stores, a subsidiary of J. Front Retailing. At one time Daimaru was an independent company, , headquartered in Chūō-ku, Osaka.

It has been a member of the International Association of Department Stores from 1962 to 1982. As of 2016, Daimaru had seven stores in Japan, and employed about 3,000 people.

==History==


Daimaru traces its history to &quot;Dai-Monjiya&quot;, a dry goods store in Kyoto founded by Shimomura Hikoemon Masahiro in 1717. The name &quot;Daimaru&quot; was first used for a store in Nagoya called &quot;Daimaruya&quot;, which opened in 1728.

The chain was incorporated in 1907 and reincorporated as Daimaru Dry Goods K.K. in 1920, changing its name to Daimaru in 1928. For several years in the 1960s, Daimaru was the largest retailer in Japan. 

In 1960, Daimaru established a subsidiary called Peacock Sangyo. Now known as Daimaru Peacock, it operates 49 supermarkets in the Greater Tokyo Area, 28 in the Kansai region and 8 in the Chūbu region.

===International expansion and closures===
Daimaru expanded to Malaysia 1942 opening in Penang and later Singapore establishing a presence in November 1983 when Liang Court was opened. Daimaru would later close and reopen in 2003.

Its opened in Hong Kong in 1960 lasting until its exit from Hong Kong in 1998, 

In the late 1964, it was the first Japanese department store to open in Thailand, under the name Thai Daimaru.

It opened its first store outside of Asia in Melbourne, Australia in 1991 operating across six levels of the Melbourne Central (in direct competition with Myer and David Jones). A second Australian store announced in 1996 opened on the Gold Coast in 1998. Daimaru announced its departure from the Australian market after nearly a decade of low profits in September 2001 commencing closure of both stores in late 2002.

In 1998, Daimaru entered into a partnership with the French grand couturier Dominique Sirop to produce &quot;Dominique Sirop for Daimaru&quot;, a high fashion prêt-à-porter (ready-to-wear) label.

<text>Géza Lakatos de Csíkszentsimon (Hungarian title/name: &quot;Vitéz lófő csíkszentsimoni Lakatos Géza&quot;; in German: Geza Ritter Lakatos, Edler von Csikszentsimon) (30 April 1890 – 21 May 1967) was a colonel general in the Hungarian Army during World War II who served briefly as Prime Minister of Hungary, under regent Miklós Horthy from 29 August 1944, until 15 October 1944.

== Biography ==
Lakatos graduated at Ludovica Military Academy. He was a military attaché in Prague from 1928 to 1934. On 5 August 1943 he succeeded vitéz Gusztáv Jány as commander of the Second Army. On 1 April 1944 he was appointed commander of the 1st Hungarian Army, but this was only until 15 May 1944.

In August 1944 supporters of Lakatos and Horthy, armed with one tank, overthrew the German-installed government of Döme Sztójay. Lakatos&#x27;s military government (also called &quot;shadow-army&quot;, since they operated in complete secrecy) stopped the deportation of Hungarian Jews, with acting Interior Minister Béla Horváth ordering Hungarian gendarmes to use deadly force against any deportation effort. Lakatos also reopened peace talks with the Allies that had previously been begun by Miklós Kállay. He even went as far as to begin talks with the Soviets. On 15 October 1944, Horthy tried to force the Germans out entirely and concluded an armistice with the Allies. However, when Horthy announced this in a nationwide radio address, the Germans kidnapped Horthy&#x27;s son, Miklós Horthy, Jr., and Horthy surrendered to them. The far-right Arrow Cross Party, backed by the Germans, immediately staged a coup and took full control of the government. Lakatos was forced to resign that day, and was imprisoned by the Germans in Sopronkőhida. After that he was interned into Sopron.

Following the Soviet occupation of Hungary, Lakatos was interrogated several times in Kiskőrös. He was released from prison in January 1946 and thereafter appeared as a witness in war crime trials against the Arrow Cross Party and other pro-Nazi former officials before the so-called People&#x27;s Tribunal of Budapest. In the forthcoming years he lived in his estate in Érd. His military pension was revoked by the Communist authorities and his lands were also confiscated in 1949. Following that he moved to Budapest where he worked as a book illustrator and silk painter, and lived in poor financial circumstances. His daughter emigrated to Australia in 1956, when the failed Hungarian Revolution briefly allowed people to emigrate from Hungary. Following his wife&#x27;s death in 1965, the authorities permitted Lakatos to travel to Adelaide where his daughter lived since 1957. He died there two years later, in 1967.

<text>State Route 38 (SR 38) is a mostly rural and scenic state highway in the U.S. state of California, connecting Interstate 10 in Redlands with State Route 18 in the Big Bear Lake area. It is one of the primary routes into the San Bernardino Mountains. Despite the orientation of its alignment, SR 38 is assigned in a west–east direction.

==Route description==
SR 38 begins at its west junction with State Route 18 adjacent to the westernmost point of Big Bear Lake near the City of Big Bear Lake. Bordering the north shore of the lake, it traverses North Shore Drive as it passes Fawnskin and Minnelusa. After it passes Big Bear City Airport, it reaches its northeast junction with State Route 18 at Greenway Drive in Big Bear City. Route 38 then turns south, sharing Greenway Drive with Route 18. Both route signs continue on Greenway Drive to its intersection with Big Bear Boulevard. At the intersection, Route 18 turns west and Route 38 turns east onto Big Bear Boulevard. Route 38 continues easterly on Big Bear Boulevard to its intersection with Greenspot Boulevard and Shay Road.

The route then turns southeast onto Greenspot Boulevard. SR 38 leaves Big Bear City, and ascends southeasterly, reaching Onyx Summit at , near Onyx Peak; in the vicinity of this location, Route 38 is one of the highest roads in southern California. After the summit, the highway turns briefly southerly and then southwesterly starting its slow descent as it continues along Cienaga Seca Creek until it is just west of the forest road to Heart Bar Campground and to one of the many trails to San Gorgonio Mountain, the highest land elevation in southern California. It then continues northwesterly along the upper Santa Ana River and then, after briefly crossing undulating terrain, westerly through the Barton Flats area, home to many campgrounds. After leaving the Barton Flats area, encountering many small-radius curves, it continues southwesterly through undulating terrain to Angelus Oaks, where Route 38 crosses the ridgeline of the highest peaks in the San Bernardino Mountains.

After leaving Angelus Oaks, the highway continues briefly to the south including many curves; then the highway descends more rapidly as it turns southeasterly and then briefly southerly and southwesterly along the southern face of the San Bernardino Mountains to its intersection with Valley of the Falls Drive, the access road to the community of Forest Falls and to the shortest and steepest trail to San Gorgonio Mountain. Now known as Mill Creek Road, Route 38 turns slightly north of west past the north side of Mountain Home Village and then southwesterly through and adjacent to Mill Creek Canyon before leaving the San Bernardino National Forest and entering Mentone. Upon entering Mentone, the route continues due west, becoming Mentone Boulevard. As one enters Redlands from Mentone, SR 38 becomes Lugonia Avenue before turning south on Orange Street and terminating at Interstate 10 in Redlands east of the State Route 210 interchange.

SR 38 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and the western portion of the route is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 38 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System; however, it is only a scenic highway as designated by the California Department of Transportation between a point east of the South Fork Campground and the intersection with State Lane, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a &quot;memorable landscape&quot; with no &quot;visual intrusions&quot;, where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.

The segment of SR 38 from the westernmost point of Big Bear Lake to the San Bernardino National Forest boundary near Mill Creek Canyon is designated as part of the Rim of the World Scenic Byway, a National Forest Scenic Byway.

==History==
A road that went from Redlands to near Baldwin Lake was added to the state highway system in 1933, and became Route 190 in 1935. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, SR 38 was designated; at this time, the highway was rerouted to the northern side of Big Bear Lake.

<text>Layer de la Haye (often spelled Layer-de-la-Haye; locally known just as &quot;Layer&quot;) is a village and civil parish in the City of Colchester district of Essex, England. In the 2011 census it had a recorded population of 1,767. 

== History ==
The village is thought to have been founded in Saxon times, with its original name, Legra, meaning &#x27;lookout&#x27;. Its elevation made it an ideal vantage point for the Saxons against raiding parties from the coast. Later its name changed to Leire or Leger, meaning &#x27;mud&#x27;. A Norse word, this is likely to have referred to the soil and marshland around the village. During the time of the Norman Conquests, the village was &quot;owned&quot; by the de la Hayes, and its name thus changed to Layer de la Haye. Layer was ravaged by the Black Plague of the 14th Century. The Church became derelict until it was restored by monks.

In 1289, John de Rye donated of land to St John&#x27;s Abbey in Colchester. As a token of appreciation, a manor and farm were named after him (Rye Manor and Rye Farm respectively). At the end of the 15th century, the Abbey built a toll-gate house, now called the Greate House (originally the Gate House) near Malting Green.

At the time of the dissolution of the Monasteries which began in 1536, Sir Thomas Audley, who in turn became speaker of the House of Commons and Lord Chancellor, appropriated the manors of Rye and Blind Knights, together with the Mill and the patronage of the benefice. Layer Mill is mentioned in the Domesday Book as a water-mill. The mill wheel was powered by water from the Roman River.

Within the churchyard of St John the Baptist lie the graves of Arthur Cecil Alport (a South African physician who first identified the Alport syndrome in a British family in 1927), Cuthbert Alport (a Conservative Party politician, minister and life peer) and General Sir Ivo Vesey (a British Army officer who served as Chief of the General Staff in India from 1937 to 1939).

Layer de la Haye is among the villages which suffered damage from the 1884 Colchester earthquake.

==Facilities==
The village has a Church of England primary school for children up to the age of eleven. They run a number of after-school clubs, including a girls football club, which is organised by Colchester United F.C..

The parish church is dedicated to St John the Baptist. There has been a church building at its location since at least 1128, when it was mentioned in documents, although some of the fabric appears to be earlier than that date. For over 400 years, priests were supplied by the Abbey of St John or the Priory of St Botolph, in Colchester. The nave and tower date from 1350, when they were rebuilt by the monks of St Botolph. During the 19th century, a south aisle was added, to accommodate the increased population of the village. Parish registers go back to 1752, as earlier ones were destroyed in a fire. The tower houses five bells, the oldest of which dates from 1459. A project to install a new bell frame was completed in 2001. The church is part of the benefice of Thurstable and Winstree, a group of eight parishes covering an area to the south of Colchester. There are close links with the parishes of Birch, Layer Breton, and Layer Marney.

Part of Abberton Reservoir is located within the parish, and Essex Wildlife Trust manage a visitor centre which is accessed from Church Road, Layer de la Haye. The site is of international importance for wild fowl, with up to 40,000 birds visiting it each year. Construction of the reservoir was authorised in 1935 by an Act of Parliament, which also authorised the building of Layer de la Haye Treatment Works. This processes water from the reservoir, from where it is piped to Tiptree to be mixed with water from other sources, before it enters the drinking water supply system. The buildings at the treatment works are good examples of International Modern Movement structures.

== Population ==
In 1950 its population was under 700; by 1975 it was over 1,000 and in 1990 it was just short of 2,000. However, the proximity of Colchester, with its large range of shops and facilities, eventually forced all of the three shops in Layer to close. The Layer Village Store was reopened by new owners in 2015.

Despite concerns over vandalism and anti-social behaviour, the village is generally regarded as a safe and happy place to be. Societies and clubs provide entertainment for the whole village community.

==House Prices==
Layer-De-La-Haye, with an overall average price of £444,714 was more expensive than nearby Lexden (£371,319), Stanway (£309,215) and Colchester (£273,543).

<doc id="874461" wikidata="Q7305086" url="?curid=874461" title="Red Square (University of Washington)">
<text>Red Square, officially Central Plaza or the Suzzallo Quadrangle, is a large open square on the Seattle campus of the University of Washington that serves as a hub for two of the university&#x27;s major axes, connecting the campus&#x27;s northern Liberal Arts Quadrangle (&quot;The Quad&quot;) with the science and engineering buildings found on the lower campus. The plaza is paved with red brick, and becomes notoriously slippery during rain.

During the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition in 1909, the square was the site for the temporary U.S. Government Building. After the exposition closed, the building was removed and the area left an open field that eventually became known as Central Plaza or Suzzallo Quadrangle, after Suzzallo Library, along its eastern edge.

In 1969, the field was excavated to construct an underground parking garage; the engineers who designed the garage thought that the rain on the grass would leak into the garage, leading to the choice of a distinctive red brick surface. Cassandra Amesely, then an editor of the student paper &quot;The Daily&quot;, convinced the student population to refer to the area as Red Square, presumably in reference to the color of the brick. Whether it was also meant to refer to Moscow&#x27;s Red Square in an era known for student activism is unclear.

The northwest area of the square is dominated by three adjacent brick monoliths; one to ventilate the underground garage and the other two for aesthetic reasons. The northeast corner of the square features a version of Barnett Newman&#x27;s &quot;Broken Obelisk&quot; sculpture. Steps to the southeast lead down Rainier Vista to Drumheller Fountain, aligned with Mount Rainier. A 1909 bronze statue of George Washington is below the west entrance, facing west toward The Brothers of the Olympic Mountains. The elevation of Red Square is approximately above sea level.

The plaza is surrounded by the following buildings:
* [[Suzzallo Library]] to the east: the university&#x27;s central library
* [[Gerberding Hall]] to the southeast: university administration
* [[Meany Hall for the Performing Arts|Meany Hall]] to the southwest: performing arts facilities
* [[Odegaard Undergraduate Library]] to the northwest
* Kane Hall to the northeast: lecture halls

==&quot;College GameDay&quot;==
Red Square has hosted ESPN&#x27;s &quot;College GameDay&quot; three times, in 2013, 2016, and 2023.

<doc id="874463" wikidata="Q2904007" url="?curid=874463" title="Zakaria Zubeidi">
<text>Zakaria Muhammad &#x27;Abdelrahman Zubeidi (; other spellings include Zakariyah Zbeidi, Zacharia and Zubaidi) (born 1976) is the former Jenin chief of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades.

He is considered a &quot;symbol of the Intifada&quot;, and was on Israel&#x27;s most-wanted list for several years. In an interview in 2005 he assumed responsibility for the 2002 Beit She&#x27;an attack that killed 6 people. He pledged to put away his weapons as part of an Israeli amnesty in 2007, though he never gave his guns up in the sense of relinquishing them to the authorities. 
Zubeidi nevertheless agreed to give up violence, and after a three-month probation period, was removed from Israel&#x27;s wanted list. He subsequently devoted himself to &#x27;cultural resistance&#x27; in the form of support for the Freedom Theatre at the Jenin Refugee Camp.

On 28 December 2011, Israel rescinded Zubeidi&#x27;s pardon, and in May 2012 he was detained without charge by the Palestinian National Authority for six months. On 27 February 2019, Zubeidi was arrested again and in May charged before an Israeli military court with carrying out at least two shooting attacks on civilian buses in the West Bank. On September 6, 2021, he escaped from the Gilboa Prison in Israel&#x27;s North, together with five other Palestinian prisoners, through a tunnel that they had dug. Five days later, on September 11, 2021, Zubeidi was caught near the Israeli village of Kfar Tavor.

In January 2025, Zubeidi was released as part of a three-phase Israel–Hamas war ceasefire, aimed at securing the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.

==Early life==
Zakaria was born in 1976 into the family of Mohammed and Samira Zubeidi, one of eight children at the Jenin refugee camp. The family originally came from a village near Caesarea from which they were expelled in the 1947–1949 Palestine war. In an rare interview with a British reporter, Zakaria recalled his father, an English teacher, was prevented from teaching by the Israelis after he was arrested in the late 1960s for being a member of Fatah. He worked instead as a labourer in an Israeli iron foundry, did some private teaching on the side, and became a peace activist. The first Israeli Zubeidi had ever met was the soldier who came to take away his father away, leaving the mother to raise their children alone.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, during the First Intifada, Israeli human rights activist Arna Mer-Khamis opened a children&#x27;s theater in Jenin, &quot;Arna&#x27;s House&quot;, to encourage understanding between Israelis and Palestinians. Dozens of Israeli volunteers ran the events, and Samira, believing that peace was possible, offered the top floor of the family house for rehearsals. Zubeidi, then aged 12, his older brother Daoud, and four other boys around the same age formed the core of the troupe.

Zubeidi attended the UNRWA school in Jenin Refugee Camp, and by all accounts was a good student. In 1989, at age 13, he was shot in the leg when he threw stones at Israeli soldiers. He was hospitalised for six months and underwent four operations, but was left permanently affected, with one leg shorter than the other and a noticeable limp. At age 14, he was arrested for the first time (again for throwing stones) and jailed for six months. At that time he had become the representative before the prison governor for the other child prisoners. On his release, he dropped out of high school after one year. A year later, he was re-arrested for throwing Molotov cocktails and imprisoned for years. In prison, he learned Hebrew, and became politically active, joining Fatah.

On his release following the 1993 Oslo Accords, he joined the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s Palestinian Security Forces. He became a sergeant, but left, disillusioned, after a year, complaining: &quot;There were colleagues whom I had taught to read who were promoted to senior positions because of nepotism and corruption.&quot;

He went to work illegally in Israel, and for two years earned a good living as a contractor for home renovations in Tel Aviv and Haifa. He was eventually arrested in Afula and, after being briefly imprisoned for working without a permit, deported back to Jenin. With his permit to work in Israel blocked, Zubeidi reportedly resorted to auto theft. In 1997, he was caught with a stolen car, and was given a fifteen-month sentence. After serving his time, he returned to the camp in Jenin. He became a truck driver, transporting flour and olive oil, but in September 2000 lost his job when the West Bank was sealed off due to the Second Intifada.

==Leader of the Al-Aqsa Brigades==

===Battle of Jenin===
Zubeidi himself traces his entry into armed militancy back to late 2001 when, after the killing of a close friend, he learned how to make bombs. On 3 March 2002, one month before the main assault on the refugee camp, his mother was killed during an Israeli raid into Jenin. She had taken refuge in a neighbor&#x27;s home and was shot by an IDF sniper who targeted her as she stood near a window. She subsequently bled to death. Zubeidi&#x27;s brother Taha was also killed by soldiers shortly afterward. A month later, a suicide bomber from Jenin killed 29 Israelis. The Israeli Army then launched a full-scale offensive in the Jenin refugee camp, demolishing hundreds of homes, leaving 2,000 homeless. Ten days of fighting ensued in which 52 Palestinians and 23 Israeli soldiers died.

Aside from grieving for lost family members and friends, Zubeidi was greatly embittered by the fact that none of the Israelis who had accepted his mother&#x27;s hospitality, and whom he had thought were his friends, tried to contact him. In a 2006 interview he stated angrily, &quot;You took our house and our mother and you killed our brother. We gave you everything and what did we get in return? A bullet in my mother&#x27;s chest. We opened our home and you demolished it. Every week, 20-30 Israelis would come there to do theatre. We fed them. And afterward, not one of them picked up the phone. That is when we saw the real face of the left in Israel.&quot; The Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades may reach peace with Israel, he said, but personally he would not. He found himself unable to forgive the killing of his mother and brother and the razing of his house.

Losing hope in the Israeli peace camp, he joined the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades, an armed wing of Fatah and became a leader of the group. The al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades claimed responsibility for a November 2002 terrorist attack in Bet She&#x27;an in which 6 civilians were murdered, and Israel named Zubeidi as the prime suspect who planned the attack. This and other attacks he was involved in made him one of Israel&#x27;s most wanted men in the West Bank. 

Arna&#x27;s son, Israeli actor Juliano Mer-Khamis, did return to Jenin in 2002 and looked for the boys who had been in the theater group. Zubeidi had turned to armed resistance, Daoud was sentenced to 16 years in prison for militant activities, and the other four were dead. In 2004, Mer-Khamis completed a documentary film about the group, &quot;Arna&#x27;s Children&quot;. Zubeidi&#x27;s face was slightly disfigured by fragments of shrapnel from a bomb that he mishandled in 2003.

===Power-broker of Jenin===
He took responsibility for a bombing in Tel Aviv that killed one woman and injured more than 30 in June 2004. During this period, he was considered the primary power-broker and most powerful man in Jenin. Zubeidi was &quot;de facto&quot; in charge of law and order in the city. He viewed the PA security forces as having little presence other than &quot;disturbing traffic.&quot; Although he developed a friendly relationship with the former Palestinian president and Fatah head, Yasser Arafat, recalling him saying &quot;&#x27;Zakaria, buddy, I love you, we&#x27;re marching to Jerusalem!&#x27;&quot;, Zubeidi also stated &quot;I don&#x27;t take orders from anyone. I&#x27;m not good at following.&quot; At the time, he was enthusiastic about the intifada, dismissing the view of Palestinians who wanted to end it and warned the new generation of Palestinians would &quot;fight better&quot;.
Israel tried to assassinate him four times. In one such attempt in 2004, an Israeli police unit killed five other brigade members, including a 14-year-old boy, in a jeep carrying Zubeidi. On November 15, following Arafat&#x27;s death, Israeli forces launched an incursion in Jenin to kill him, but he evaded them; in the raid, nine Palestinians were killed, including four civilians and his deputy, &quot;Alaa&quot;. The raid uncovered an arms cache. Prior to these incidents, another attempt on his life had been made by a Palestinian; Zubeidi broke his assailant&#x27;s hand as a punishment.

Zubeidi was at the center of controversy in 2004 when Tali Fahima, an Israeli legal secretary, was imprisoned due to her contacts with him. She was accused of preventing his arrest by the IDF by translating a document for him. Both of them denied allegations that they had a romantic relationship. He stated that year, &quot;The intifada is in its death throes. These are the final stages... Not only was the intifada a failure, but we are a total failure. We achieved nothing in 50 years of struggle; we&#x27;ve achieved only our survival.&quot; In an interview at this time with two Israeli journalists, Zubeidi assumed personal responsibility for a terrorist attack in Beit She&#x27;an in 2002, when two Palestinian gunmen from Jalbun shot six Israelis dead.

===Elections and renewed conflict with Israel===
During the Palestinian presidential elections in 2004, Zubeidi initially endorsed Marwan Barghouti, but shortly after Barghouti was imprisoned, he decided to support Mahmoud Abbas, who went on to win the election. The two were in contact with each other and Zubeidi, despite being considered a loose cannon and dangerously outspoken, appreciated Abbas&#x27; &quot;subdued no-nonsense style.&quot; In December 2004, Israeli sources criticized Abbas for meeting Zubeidi. Despite his readiness to accept Abbas&#x27; election to the presidency, Zubeidi still stated that he did not trust the latter in regard to the fundamental Palestinian claims concerning the status of Jerusalem and the right of return for Palestinian refugees. According to Zubeidi, Arafat was the only figure who could have fulfilled those aspirations, claiming this was &quot;why he was poisoned... why Israel killed him.&quot;

In September 2005 he declared that his group&#x27;s cease-fire was at an end after Samer Saadi and two other militants were killed by Israeli forces in Jenin. On July 6, 2006, the IDF attempted to capture Zubeidi at a funeral, but he escaped after an exchange of gunfire.

==Amnesty==

On July 15, 2007, the Office of the Israeli Prime Minister announced that Israel would include Zubeidi in an amnesty offered to militants of Fatah&#x27;s al-Aqsa-Brigades. As of 2008, he was hired by Juliano Mer-Khamis (who was later murdered) as director of the Freedom Theatre in the Jenin refugee camp.

In an interview on April 4, 2008, he stated that he still had not received a full pardon from Israel, and blamed the PA for &quot;lying&quot; to him. He continued to sleep at the PA&#x27;s Jenin headquarters and receive a salary of 1,050 NIS almost half of what he received earlier (2000 NIS). Asked why he had stopped fighting even when he had not received a full pardon, Zubeidi replied &quot;because of the conflict between Fatah and Hamas. Look, it&#x27;s perfectly clear to me that we won&#x27;t be able to defeat Israel. My aim was for us, by means of the resistance, to get a message out to the world. Back in Abu &#x27;Ammar&#x27;s day, we had a plan, there was a strategy, and we would carry his orders... now there&#x27;s no one capable of using our actions to bring about... achievements.&quot; Zubeidi criticized the PA leadership, saying &quot;they are whores. Our leadership is garbage.&quot; Faced with the question of whether or not he admitted defeat he claimed &quot;Even [late Egyptian president] Gamal Abdel Nasser admitted his defeat, so why not me?&quot;

Prior to Fatah&#x27;s Sixth Conference in August 2009, Zubeidi called on fellow Fatah members to adopt a program of resistance in case peace negotiations with Israel failed and a Third Intifada broke out. Although he was accredited as one of 2,000 Fatah delegates to the conference in Bethlehem, Zubeidi was momentarily denied entry to the meeting hall. al-Aqsa Brigade members in Nablus and Jenin, as well as those outside of the Palestinian territories, protested the rebuff, describing it as &quot;stabbing the resistance in the back.&quot; Fatah officials eventually gave him permission to attend on August 5, 2009. The PA was also asked by brigade members to ensure Zubeidi&#x27;s safety from Bethlehem back to Jenin. A number of right-wing Israeli Knesset members submitted a petition to the Israeli military court on August 6 calling for Zubeidi&#x27;s arrest, despite the fact that he had been amnestied, because his &quot;hands have Israeli blood [on them].&quot;. In the speech he delivered at the conference, Zubeidi suggested the Fatah-ruled West Bank reunite with the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip through force, if necessary. He criticized the &quot;old leadership,&quot; condemning them for failing the Palestinian people, stating that &quot;(d)uring 18 years of negotiations [under Fatah], no hope has been created.&quot; Zubeidi suggested that a younger generation of Palestinians should lead Fatah.

===Cancelling of amnesty===
On 29 December 2011, Israel rescinded Zubeidi&#x27;s pardon and Zubeidi stated to &quot;Ma&#x27;an News Agency&quot; that he had not violated any of the conditions of his amnesty. He was advised by PA security officials to turn himself in to Palestinian custody lest he be arrested by Israel&#x27;s security forces. A week before Zubeidi was notified about the cancellation of his amnesty, his brother had been arrested by the PA.

Zubeidi was then kept in detention without charge by the Palestinian Authority from May to October 2012. During this period, Zubeidi undertook to study for a master&#x27;s degree from Birzeit University, where he was supervised by Abdel Rahim Al-Sheikh, Professor of Cultural Studies, with a thesis entitled &quot;The Dragon and the Hunter,&quot; that focused on the Palestinian experience of being pursued from 1968 to 2018 and was helped in collecting materials by his friend Gideon Levy, an Israeli journalist, who provided him with documents from Haaretz&#x27;s archives.

On 27 February 2019, before he could complete his dissertation, Zubeidi was arrested again, on suspicion of having engaged in terrorist activities, and in May he was charged before an Israeli military court with carrying out at least two shooting attacks on civilian buses in the West Bank.

==Escape and recapture==

Zakaria Zubeidi was at the Gilboa Prison since his arrest, and on 6 September 2021, he succeeded to escape with five other prisoners. He was captured by the police on 11 September, with Mohammed Qassem Ardah, in northern Israel at a truck stop near the town of Shibli–Umm al-Ghanam. According to an eyewitness, they were found hiding under a semi-trailer. Zubeidi tried to escape but was overpowered.

== 2025 release ==
In January 2025, it was agreed to release Zubeidi as part of a three-phase ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, aimed at ending the war in Gaza and securing the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. He was released on 30 January 2025, after which he was greeted by crowds of Palestinians in Ramallah.

<doc id="874468" wikidata="Q5142105" url="?curid=874468" title="Colchester Royal Grammar School">
<text>Colchester Royal Grammar School (CRGS) is a state-funded grammar school in Colchester, Essex. It was founded in 1128 and was later granted two royal charters - by Henry VIII in 1539 and by Elizabeth I in 1584.

The school&#x27;s main buildings and playing fields are located in the Lexden area of Colchester and there are around 950 pupils aged 11–18. Historically a boys&#x27; school, it has admitted girls to the sixth form since 1998 and specialises in science and languages. The school regularly tops national A-level league tables.

==History==
===Before 1900: foundation, royal charters and early history===

Despite the paucity of mediaeval documentation, there is evidence to suggest that the school&#x27;s origins can traced back to 1206, and indeed earlier to 1132.

Several centuries later, following the dissolution of the monasteries by King Henry VIII, the royal charter of 1539 ensured that revenues were granted to the bailiffs and commonality of Colchester on condition that they founded a school; this was then enacted by the charter of Elizabeth I in 1585, on condition that at least £13 6s 8d be set aside annually for the schoolmaster. Revenue from other property was also granted, but this was later challenged in court during the reign of William III, and the arrangements were legally reconfirmed. By 1750, under the stewardship of Philip Morant, these revenues were worth £45 per annum and provided scholarships for two boys to study at the University of Cambridge.

For most of its history, the school was small and run mainly out of the headmaster&#x27;s house, with only minor changes until 1852 when the &quot;big school&quot; was built. At this time there was very little secondary education in northern Essex, and difficulties were exacerbated through friction between the headmaster of the school and the town&#x27;s Corporation. Pupil numbers dropped, although the school took in a few &quot;parlour boarders&quot; to prepare for entry into the army or university.

===Since 1900: new school buildings, uniform and other developments===

The school&#x27;s situation changed in 1900 with the appointment of Percy Shaw Jeffrey as headmaster. He took over a school with 29 boarders and barely any staff, but his reforms rapidly turned the school around. He introduced day boys and established a preparatory school, a cadet corps, an orchestra, a bugle band, school entertainments and theatrical performances. He was a pioneer of the teaching of modern European languages through phonetics, employing language teachers from France and Germany and setting up arrangements for foreign study during holidays.
The resulting academic success, scholarships and local goodwill enabled Shaw Jeffrey to expand the school buildings, inspired by the designs of local rivals, such as Ipswich School and Earls Colne Grammar School. First, Mansfield House was purchased in 1903 and renamed Gilberd House. In 1908 Shaw Jeffrey convinced the governors and local education board to build a new school building for £4,000 on land previously used as kitchen gardens. The new buildings were designed by architects Newman, Jacques and Round and were opened by Lord Rosebery, the former Prime Minister, in May 1910. In 1911 the school was given of playing fields and opened tennis courts and a small rifle range.

Until 1908 the school blazer was green, but other schools in the area had adopted the same colour. Wanting the school to be distinct and recognisable, Shaw Jeffrey approached a tailor and asked what the most expensive dye was. Told that it was purple, he chose it as the new colour for the school&#x27;s blazer, which it remains to this day.

By 1912 numbers had grown to 144 pupils in the main school, split into four houses (School House, Parr&#x27;s House (formerly North Town), Harsnett&#x27;s House (formerly South Town) and Dugard&#x27;s House), and 169 younger boys in the preparatory school.

Growth continued through the world wars, with 700 boys by 1947 and five scholarships for pupils to pursue university education. An outdoor swimming pool was constructed in the 1920s and remains in use. In 1966 Labour-controlled Colchester Borough Council put forward proposals to close Colchester Royal Grammar School and Colchester County High School and move to a comprehensive system, but this was rejected by Essex County Council. The educational expansion of the 1960s allowed the construction of new classrooms and a gymnasium.

Expansion continued into the 21st century, with a new art building opened in 2003 and the technology block upgraded. In 2006 a new extension to the science building was completed and two new chemistry laboratories were opened.

The school became grant-maintained in the 1980s and converted into an academy in 2012.

Following the launch of the Everyone&#x27;s Invited website in 2020, allegations of misconduct were made by a former student of the school, which led to an inspection by Ofsted. The inspection found safeguarding to be ineffective and graded the school as &quot;inadequate&quot; overall. In February 2022, however, an Ofsted monitoring visit found that significant improvements had been made to the safeguarding and reporting processes, concluding that &quot;safeguarding is effective&quot; and that &quot;pupils say school is a safe and enjoyable place to be&quot;.

==Buildings and facilities==

The school&#x27;s main site on Lexden road houses classrooms, science and technology facilities, school hall, library, gymnasium, cafeteria and offices. The site also contains: Gurney Benham House, acquired in 1934 and named after William Gurney Benham, a former pupil; Elyanore House, used for music teaching; the George Young building, named after a former English teacher and used for drama; and the Jenkinson Building (opened in 2016), named after a former headmaster and containing computer rooms and chemistry laboratories.

The school has male and female boarders who mainly come from overseas (mostly from Hong Kong and parts of the European Union).

==Academic situation==
Being a selective school in the Consortium of Selective Schools in Essex, entrants are required to pass the eleven-plus exam.

The school has consistently achieved high results, coming first in the A-level league tables on many occasions. The school is also successful at GCSE level. In 2004 Colchester Royal Grammar School was named as the top state school in the country by the BBC.

The school&#x27;s success was recognised in 1999 by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who invited the headmaster, Stewart Francis, along with other heads of the country&#x27;s top schools, to a meeting to discuss the improvement of education in Britain.

In the early 2000s the headmaster Kenneth Jenkinson explained the success by saying that &quot;although as a grammar school the academic success of our students is our principal priority, I tend to see the results as the by-product of an ethos where we encourage students to aim high in all that they do and approach challenges with confidence&quot;.

===Classical Latin and Greek===
The teaching of Classical Greek is offered to pupils, in addition to studying Latin, up to A-level. Between 1994 and 2004 the Government of Greece funded teaching of the subject in an effort to halt its decline in the United Kingdom state sector. This was the result of a pupil-led campaign following a decision by the governors to cease teaching of the subject following financial difficulties caused by becoming a grant-maintained school.

Colchester Royal Grammar School was also the first in the country to teach Classical Civilisation at A-Level. The subject &quot;arose from a conversation between Arthur Brown, Head of Classics, and the Headmaster one afternoon in 1970.&quot;

==Production==

As a fan of idol singers, Tanemura created the series out of desire to write lyrics. Her previous series, &quot;Time Stranger Kyoko&quot;, was cut short due to the main protagonist, Kyoko, having a strong personality, which failed to appeal to her editors and reader demographic. As a result of this, Tanemura decided to give Mitsuki a more subdued personality and later had the idea of making her sickly to explain her shy behavior. Mitsuki is modeled after one of Tanemura&#x27;s assistants, Airi Teito, and her corkscrew hairstyle was inspired by then-Morning Musume member Ai Kago.

==Media==

Under the pseudonym &quot;Meguro Teikoku&quot;, Tanemura has also self-published unofficial &quot;dōjinshi&quot; of the series and sold limited copies exclusively at Comiket in August 2015.


===Anime===

The series was adapted as a 52-episode anime television series by Studio Deen, directed by Toshiyuki Kato. It was broadcast on TV Tokyo from April 6, 2002 to March 29, 2003. Because the anime adaptation was broadcast while the manga was still ongoing, several characters have different backgrounds and personalities, and the story ended with a different resolution.

The television series was licensed by Viz Media, who released seven DVDs (the first 28 episodes), under the title &quot;Full Moon&quot; before putting further releases on indefinite hold, citing low sales potential. The English dub was provided by Blue Water Studios. The songs are subtitled only, resulting in a dub that switches between English dialogue and Japanese singing. On August 3, 2024, AnimEigo announced their license to the anime and will re-release the series on Blu-ray in 2025.

&quot;Full Moon o Sagashite&quot; has two opening themes and four ending themes. &quot;I Love U&quot; by The Scanty is used as the opening theme for the first 26 episodes, while the group&#x27;s song &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Princess&quot; is used for the rest. Changin&#x27; My Life performs all four ending themes: &quot;New Future&quot; used for the first six episodes, episode 52, and final episode; &quot;Myself&quot; is used for episodes 7–26; &quot;Eternal Snow&quot; is used for episodes 27–42; &quot;Love Chronicle&quot; is used for episodes 43–51.

===OVA===
 is a ten-minute anime OVA that was distributed with the November 2002 issue of &quot;Ribon&quot;, the magazine in which the manga was serialized. It was produced by Studio Deen. Myco and Chieko Honda reprise their respective roles of Mitsuki and Meroko from the anime, and Hiromi Ōtsuda voices Takuto. Set before the series ends, it features Takuto and Meroko trying to make their way to the studio in stuffed animal forms after Mitsuki accidentally leaves them at home while rushing to work.

===Art book===
On April 15, 2004, Shueisha published a seventy-page art book for the series entitled . Viz Media published an English language edition in North America on October 21, 2008.

<doc id="874483" wikidata="Q610992" url="?curid=874483" title="Presbyterium">
<text>Presbyterium is a modern term used in the Catholic Church and Eastern Catholic Churches after the Second Vatican Council in reference to a college of priests, in active ministry, of an individual particular church such as a diocese or eparchy. The body, in union with their bishop as a collective, is a symbol of the collaborative and collegial nature of their sacerdotal ministry as inspired by the reforms made during the Second Vatican Council.

The presbyterium is most visible during the ordination of new priests and bishops and the Mass of the Chrism: the Holy Thursday Mass where the blessing of the oils used in the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, Anointing of the Sick, and Holy Orders takes place. They are also visible during other special liturgical functions such as the wake and burial of their bishop.

Liturgically, within Catholicism, the presbyterium is the area of the church in which the clergy functions. It is more commonly called the sanctuary.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;presbyterium&quot; is the Latinised form of the Greek (), &#x27;council of elders, presbytery&#x27;, from Greek (), the comparative form of (), &#x27;elder&#x27;.

==Presbyterate==
The presbyterate is another term used to refer to the sacerdotal collegiality of priests with their bishop, commonly used in the Anglican Communion. Within churches which hold apostolic succession, it is reflected in the concelebration of the Eucharist, in joining the bishop in the laying on of hands on an ordinand to the priesthood, in collegial processions, at inductions, funerals, and other liturgical activities. In the Catholic Church it is used to refer to the second order of priesthood - one is said to be &quot;ordained to the presbyterate&quot;. Paragraph 1536 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church states that there are three distinct orders of apostolic ministry in the sacrament of Holy Orders: episcopate, presbyterate and diaconate

<doc id="874501" wikidata="Q1203324" url="?curid=874501" title="Tone, Ibaraki">
<text>is a town in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 15,073 in 6163 households and a population density of 605 persons per km². The percentage of the population aged over 65 was 46.6%. The total area of the town is .

==Geography==
Tone is located in the flatlands in the very southern portion of Ibaraki Prefecture, bordered by Chiba Prefecture to the south. The Tone River, along with the Shin-Tone River and Kogawa River pass through the town.

===Neighboring municipalities===
Chiba Prefecture
*Abiko
*Inzai
*Sakae
Ibaraki Prefecture
*Kawachi
*Ryūgasaki
*Toride

===Climate===
Tone has a Humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light snowfall. The average annual temperature in Kitaibaraki is 14.5 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1345 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.2 °C, and lowest in January, at around 3.8 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Tone peaked around 1990 and has steadily declined since.

==History==
The area of present-day Tone was part of Kitasōma District in Shimōsa Province, as the boundary between Shimōsa and Hitachi Province had been established I the Nara period as the Tone River. However, by the Meiji period, the course of the river had shifted, leaving the area of present-day Tone on the northern bank of the river. This area was transferred to Ibaraki Prefecture in 1875. It was organized into the town of Fukawa and the villages of Fumi, and Momma within Kitasōma District, Ibaraki Prefecture with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889.

The modern town of Tone was founded by the merger of Fukawa with Fumi and Momma on January 1, 1955.

==Government==
Tone has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 12 members. Tone, together with neighboring Ryūgasaki, contributes two members to the Ibaraki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Ibaraki 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Tone was a small agricultural community until the creation of new towns which transformed the area into a commuter town for Tokyo metropolis. However, due to poor transportation connections and an aging population, the population of the town is now in decline and property prices have suffered severe declines. Discussions for a merger with neighboring Ryūgasaki were suspended in 2005, partly due to the town&#x27;s high debt burden and increasingly poor revenue base.

==Education==
*Japan Wellness Sports University
* Tone has three public elementary schools and one public middle school operated by town city government. The town does not have a high school.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
Tone does not have any passenger railway line. The nearest station is on the Abiko branch line of the JR East’s Narita Line.

===Highway===
The town is not served by any national highway. Primary access is by Chiba Prefectural Route 4 and 170, and by Ibaraki Prefectural Route 11, 68 and 209.

<doc id="874503" wikidata="Q5284440" url="?curid=874503" title="NCAA Division III">
<text>NCAA Division III (D-III) is a division of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the United States. D-III consists of athletic programs at colleges and universities that choose not to offer athletic scholarships to their student-athletes.

The NCAA&#x27;s first split was into two divisions, the University and College Divisions, in 1956, the College Division was formed for smaller schools that did not have the resources of the major athletic programs across the country. The College Division split again in 1973 when the NCAA went to its current naming convention: Division I, Division II, and Division III. D-III schools are not allowed to offer athletic scholarships, while D-II schools can.

D-III is the NCAA&#x27;s largest division with around 450 member institutions, which are 80% private and 20% public. The median undergraduate enrollment of D-III schools is about 2,750, although the range is from 418 to over 38,000. Approximately 40% of all NCAA student-athletes compete in D-III.

==Requirements==
D-III institutions must sponsor at least three team sports for each sex/gender, with each playing season represented by each gender. Teams in which men and women compete together are counted as men&#x27;s teams for sports sponsorship purposes. In a feature unique to D-III, the total number of required sports varies with each school&#x27;s full-time undergraduate enrollment. Schools with an enrollment of 1,000 or less must sponsor five men&#x27;s and five women&#x27;s sports; those with larger enrollments must sponsor six for each sex/gender. Institutions that sponsor athletic programs for only one sex/gender (single-sex schools, plus a few historically all-female schools that are now coeducational) need only meet the sponsorship requirements for that sex. There are minimum contest rules and participant minimums for each sport.

D-III athletic programs are non-revenue-generating, extracurricular programs that are staffed and funded like any other university department. They feature student-athletes who receive no financial aid related to their athletic ability. Student-athletes cannot redshirt as freshmen, and schools may not use endowments or funds whose primary purpose is to benefit athletic programs.

D-III schools &quot;shall not award financial aid to any student on the basis of athletics leadership, ability, participation or performance&quot;. Financial aid given to athletes must be awarded under the same procedures as for the general student body, and the proportion of total financial aid given to athletes &quot;shall be closely equivalent to the percentage of student-athletes within the student body&quot;. The ban on scholarships is strictly enforced. As an example of how seriously the NCAA takes this rule, in 2005 MacMurray College became only the fifth school slapped with a &quot;death penalty&quot; after its men&#x27;s tennis program gave grants to foreign-born players. The two service academies that are D-III members, Merchant Marine and Coast Guard, do not violate the athletic scholarship ban because all students, whether or not they are varsity athletes, receive the same treatment, a full scholarship.

Another aspect that distinguishes D-III from the other NCAA divisions is that D-III institutions are specifically banned from using the National Letter of Intent, or any other pre-enrollment form that is not executed by other prospective students at the school. The NCAA provides for one exception—a standard, nonbinding celebratory signing form that may be signed by the student upon his or her acceptance of enrollment. However, this form cannot be signed at the campus of that college, and staff members of that college cannot be present at the signing.

==Conferences==
===All-sports conferences===
An &quot;all-sports conference&quot; is defined here as one that sponsors both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball. While the NCAA has a much more detailed definition of the term, every NCAA conference (regardless of division) that sponsors basketball meets the organization&#x27;s requirements for &quot;all-sports&quot; status.

==D-III schools with D-I programs==
Ten D-III schools currently field Division I programs in one or two sports, one maximum for each gender. These schools are allowed to offer athletic scholarships only for their D-I men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports.

Five of them are schools that traditionally competed at the highest level of a particular men&#x27;s sport prior to the institution of the three division classifications in 1973, a decade before the NCAA governed women&#x27;s sports. These five colleges (plus three others that later chose to return their D-I programs to D-III) were granted a waiver (a.k.a. a grandfather clause) in 1983 to continue offering scholarships, a waiver that was reaffirmed in 2004. Presumably due to Title IX considerations, grandfathered schools are also allowed to field one women&#x27;s sport in D-I, and all five schools choose to do so.

* Clarkson University (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey)
* Colorado College (men&#x27;s ice hockey and women&#x27;s soccer)
* Johns Hopkins University (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse)
* Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey)
* St. Lawrence University (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey)

Three formerly grandfathered schools moved completely to D-III. The State University of New York at Oneonta, which had been grandfathered in men&#x27;s soccer, moved totally to D-II in 2006. Rutgers University–Newark, which had been grandfathered in men&#x27;s volleyball, did the same in 2014. Hartwick College, which had been grandfathered in men&#x27;s soccer and women&#x27;s water polo, moved its men&#x27;s soccer program to D-III in 2018 and dropped women&#x27;s water polo entirely.

The other five schools chose to field D-I programs in one sport for men and/or one sport for women after the original grandfather clause went into effect, so they were not grandfathered and thus were not allowed to offer athletic scholarships. Academic-based and need-based financial aid was still available, as is the case for all of D-III.

* Franklin and Marshall College (men&#x27;s wrestling)
* Hobart College (men&#x27;s lacrosse)
* Massachusetts Institute of Technology (women&#x27;s rowing) 
* Rochester Institute of Technology (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey)
* Union College (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey)

In addition, Lawrence University was formerly a non-grandfathered program in fencing, but the NCAA no longer conducts a separate D-I fencing championship. Lawrence continues to field a fencing team, but that team is now considered D-III (see below).

In August 2011, the NCAA decided to no longer allow individual programs to move to another division as a general policy. One exception was made in 2012, when RIT successfully argued for a one-time opportunity for colleges with a D-I men&#x27;s team to add a women&#x27;s team.

Since no more colleges would be allowed to move individual sports to D-I, the five non-scholarship programs (led by RIT and Union) petitioned to be allowed to offer scholarships in the interests of competitive equity. D-III membership voted in January 2022 to extend the grandfather clause to allow all ten colleges to offer athletic scholarships, effective immediately.

Football and basketball may not be D-I programs at D-III institutions, because their revenue-enhancing potential would give them an unfair advantage over other D-III schools. In 1992, several D-I schools playing D-III football were forced to bring their football programs into D-I, following the passage of the &quot;Dayton Rule&quot; (named after the University of Dayton, whose success in D-III football was seen as threatening the &quot;ethos&quot; of Division III sports). This led directly to the creation of the Pioneer Football League, a non-scholarship football-only Division I FCS conference.

==D-III schools playing in non-divisional sports==

In addition to the D-III schools with teams that play as D-I members, many other D-III schools have teams that compete alongside D-I and D-II members in sports that the NCAA does not split into divisions. Teams in these sports are not counted as playing in a different division from the rest of the athletic program. D-III members cannot award scholarships in these sports.

==Reforms==
In 2003, concerned about the disparity of some D-III athletic programs and the focus on national championships, the D-III Presidents&#x27; Council, led by Middlebury College President John McCardell, proposed ending the athletic scholarship exemptions for D-I programs, eliminating redshirting, and limiting the length of the traditional and non-traditional seasons. At the January 2004 NCAA convention, an amendment allowed the exemption for grandfathered D-I athletic scholarships to remain in place, but the rest of the reforms passed.

==Inclusion programs==
D-III announced the creation of a LGBTQ inclusion program in 2019 known as the LGBTQ OneTeam Program. The program has facilitators from more than 40 colleges across the country, including Smith College, Agnes Scott College, and more. The group publicly condemned laws trying to limit transgender people in sports in 2021. A member of the program – Rhea Debussy who is a transgender rights activist – publicly left after changes to the NCAA&#x27;s transgender policy in 2022.

<doc id="874504" wikidata="Q3117110" url="?curid=874504" title="Nicktoons">
<text>Nicktoons is the brand name used by Nickelodeon for their original animated series. All Nicktoons are produced partly at the Nickelodeon Animation Studio and list Nickelodeon&#x27;s parent company (Paramount Global) in their copyright bylines.

Since its launch in the late 1970s, Nickelodeon&#x27;s schedule incorporated animation produced by other companies. The channel did not invest in its own original cartoon series until 1989 when producer Vanessa Coffey visited Los Angeles to accept pitches from local animators. Geraldine Laybourne, the channel&#x27;s then-president, greenlit three pitches for full series: &quot;Doug&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;. On August 11, 1991, the three cartoons premiered as part of a 90-minute block, becoming the first branded Nicktoons. In contrast to the merchandise-based cartoons that dominated the 1980s animation industry, Vanessa Coffey and Geraldine Laybourne agreed that the Nicktoons should be creator-driven: based on original characters designed by animators.

The first Nicktoons debuted to financial success, convincing Viacom to invest in original animated shows for its other network MTV. Until 1998, Nickelodeon&#x27;s animation division operated out of a rented office complex in Studio City, California. Production moved to an individual building in nearby Burbank on March 4, 1998. Among the first shows produced at this new facility was &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, which by 2004 had become the most profitable Nickelodeon program. In 2002, a cable channel also called Nicktoons was launched, followed by multiple international versions. Several original shows have premiered new episodes on the channel.

In the early 2010s, Nickelodeon debuted the first two Nicktoons based on preexisting TV franchises, as opposed to new characters: &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and &quot;Winx Club&quot;. These two revamped shows were developed at Nickelodeon Animation Studio following Viacom&#x27;s purchases of both properties. In 2019, Nick Animation debuted its first streaming-exclusive Nicktoon, &quot;Pinky Malinky&quot;, which was released on Netflix rather than television. Several months later, the studio announced a multi-year deal to produce animated content for Netflix, including new properties and spin-offs of previous Nicktoons.

==History==
===Early efforts (1979–1988)===
Nickelodeon&#x27;s first original animated program, &quot;Video Dream Theatre&quot;, was left unaired. It was produced over a half-year period in 1979, when the network hired its future president Geraldine Laybourne to make two pilots for the show. &quot;Video Dream Theatre&quot; used animation to visualize children&#x27;s dreams in different styles, such as color Xerox. According to an interview with Laybourne herself, Nickelodeon did not broadcast the show because it was deemed too frightening; she commented, &quot;the trouble with kids&#x27; dreams is they&#x27;re really scary. It&#x27;s a lot about abandonment, it&#x27;s a lot about suffocation. They don&#x27;t make very good stories.&quot;

The network continued to only broadcast externally-produced animation until almost a decade later, when animator Ralph Bakshi pitched an original animated series called &quot;Tattertown&quot;. In 1988, a half-hour pilot episode was produced, overseen by Debby Beece (Nickelodeon&#x27;s senior vice president of programming). Nickelodeon declined to pick up a full series, and the pilot &quot;Christmas in Tattertown&quot; premiered on December 21, 1988, as a standalone Christmas special. The network&#x27;s next attempt at an original animation was &quot;Nick&#x27;s Thanksgiving Fest&quot;, which was composed of two shorts. According to Linda Simensky, the Thanksgiving shorts &quot;gave Nickelodeon executives the confidence they needed to get the animation department started&quot;.

During the production of &quot;Nick&#x27;s Thanksgiving Fest&quot; in 1989, Geraldine Laybourne held a meeting at her house to develop a philosophy for the channel&#x27;s original cartoons. She played tapes of current animated shows, which her colleagues viewed as merchandise-driven and overly commercial. The group decided that Nickelodeon should aim for the opposite of their contemporaries, producing cartoons that would keep their creators in a key creative role rather than prioritizing an efficient &quot;assembly line&quot; process.

=== Later investments and success (1988–2000) ===

==== 1988–1996 ====

Geraldine Laybourne laid out a set of rules for the network&#x27;s cartoons, most importantly wanting to &quot;put the creator back, front and center.&quot; She approached her fellow executive Vanessa Coffey to find artists in Los Angeles interested in pitching original cartoons. Coffey had experience working in animation and was the producer for &quot;Nick&#x27;s Thanksgiving Fest&quot; in 1988. Laybourne gave Coffey &quot;pretty much free rein to look for properties&quot;.

Vanessa Coffey rented an apartment in Los Angeles for two weeks and accepted hourly pitches. She mailed animators a call for submissions, which she summarized as &quot;I&#x27;m looking for ideas, I&#x27;m looking for concepts. The less developed, the better. I want drawings, not a big pitch.&quot; As Coffey accepted pitches, she decided that she did not want a &quot;consistent look like Disney&quot;, specifically searching for projects that had completely different styles from each other.

Of the pitches she accepted, Coffey decided to approve eight six-minute pilots at a cost of $100,000 each. Laybourne would eventually select three pilots to expand into full series, meant to fill a programming block of an hour and a half. The first Nicktoon that Coffey approved was Jim Jinkins&#x27; &quot;Doug&quot;, followed by Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo&#x27;s &quot;Rugrats&quot;. The final pitch that went to series came from John Kricfalusi, who presented a variety show titled &quot;Your Gang&quot; with a live-action host presenting different cartoons, each cartoon parodying a different genre. Ren and Stimpy were pets of one of the children in &quot;Your Gang&quot;. Coffey was dissatisfied with most of the pitch but did like Ren and Stimpy, singling them out for their own series. Both Coffey and Laybourne allowed the three shows to enter development. Between the pilots and series&#x27; production, Vanessa Coffey was named Nickelodeon&#x27;s Vice President of Animation.

In fall 1992, Nickelodeon fired John Kricfalusi. Coffey and Laybourne asserted that Kricfalusi was in breach of contract for not delivering on time, creating inappropriate content, and going over budget. Kricfalusi suspected the real reason was that the network was uncomfortable with more crude humor. After Kricfalusi and Nickelodeon missed several promised new-episode delivery and air dates, the network—which had purchased the rights to the &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; characters from Kricfalusi—negotiated a settlement with him. Production on &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; moved to Nickelodeon&#x27;s animation department, Games Animation, and the show was put under the creative supervision of Bob Camp. Coffey soon stepped down as animation vice president for Nickelodeon to pursue her own projects. She was replaced by Mary Harrington, a Nickelodeon producer who moved out from New York to help run the Nicktoons division after Kricfalusi was fired.

At the time, the Nicktoons were produced primarily out-of-house at Jumbo Pictures (&quot;Doug&quot;) and Klasky Csupo (&quot;Rugrats&quot;), with Nickelodeon&#x27;s executives overseeing development. Hoping to concentrate production under one roof, Nickelodeon greenlit its first fully-in-house series, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, in 1992. A budget freeze in 1995 at Viacom (parent company of Nickelodeon) resulted in &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; being canceled that same year and the network passing on the final 13 episodes of their option for &quot;Doug&quot;. Jinkins sold Jumbo Pictures to Disney in 1996, moving &quot;Doug&quot; over to ABC and Toon Disney as a result. Nickelodeon retained the rights to the 52 episodes produced between 1991 and 1994 as a part of the agreement.

==== 1996–2000 ====
In 1996, Albie Hecht, then-president of Film and TV Entertainment for Nickelodeon, met with Nickelodeon artists to brainstorm an idea for a new Nicktoons studio. Nickelodeon&#x27;s new facility, named Nickelodeon Animation Studio, would eventually open on March 4, 1998; Hecht said, &quot;For me, this building is the physical manifestation of a personal dream, which is that when people think of cartoons, they&#x27;ll say Nicktoons.&quot;

In June 1997, Nickelodeon began a five-year, $350 million investment into original animation. As part of this effort, the company doubled its animation staff and produced many new pilots, including one for &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. Before commissioning &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; as a full series, Nickelodeon executives insisted that it would not be popular unless the main character was a child who went to school, with his teacher as a main character. The show&#x27;s creator, Stephen Hillenburg, recalled in 2012 that Nickelodeon told him, &quot;Our winning formula is animation about kids in school... We want you to put SpongeBob in school.&quot; Hillenburg was ready to &quot;walk out&quot; on Nickelodeon and abandon the series, since he wanted SpongeBob to be an adult character. He eventually compromised by adding a new character to the main cast, Mrs. Puff, who is a boat-driving teacher. Hillenburg was happy with the compromise and said, &quot;A positive thing for me that came out of it was [how it brought] in a new character, Mrs. Puff, who I love.&quot;

According to Nickelodeon writer Micah Wright, the series pickups for both &quot;SpongeBob&quot; and &quot;CatDog&quot; were announced on the same day in 1997. Nickelodeon&#x27;s senior vice president, Kevin Kay, confirmed to the animation studio&#x27;s creative team that it had greenlit 100 episodes (200 individual segments) of &quot;CatDog&quot; and six episodes (twelve segments) of &quot;SpongeBob&quot;. Nickelodeon believed &quot;CatDog&quot; had the potential to be its next breakout hit, and their order represented an investment of $50 million into the series alone. Stephen Hillenburg was doubtful that his show would last, and he stated in 2009: &quot;I was thinking if we could make a pilot, then we&#x27;d have one episode and have accomplished that. Then I thought if it did go to a full season that we&#x27;d get twelve chances to write stories and that might be it... that we&#x27;d make twelve shows and get canceled.&quot;

In 1998, Nickelodeon premiered &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot;, which was intended as a &quot;character laboratory&quot; to test out cartoon characters. Creator Fred Seibert described the show as an experiment into a seven-minute format that Nickelodeon generally avoided; he said, &quot;they were very willing to try an experiment to see how it would work.&quot; The series eventually yielded three half-hour spin-offs based on segments from the show: &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, &quot;ChalkZone&quot;, and &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot;. 1998 also marked the release of the first feature film based on a Nicktoon: &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;, which became the first non-Disney animated film to gross over $100 million at the North American box office. On December 8, Nickelodeon&#x27;s movie division greenlit theatrical adaptations of &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; and &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, less than a month after &quot;Rugrats&quot; opened in theaters.

=== Building new brands (2000–2009) ===
At the turn of the millennium, Nickelodeon noticed that a new competitor, Cartoon Network, was attracting some of its 11–15 year old demographic. Desiring a cartoon suited for older viewers, Nickelodeon producer Mary Harrington contacted Jhonen Vasquez for a series pitch after reading his &quot;Squee!&quot; comic books. Vasquez pitched &quot;Invader Zim&quot;, which satisfied Nickelodeon&#x27;s requests for &quot;something &#x27;edgy&#x27;.&quot;

Nickelodeon also sought out a new action-adventure cartoon after commissioning several anime-inspired pilots that &quot;didn&#x27;t go anywhere&quot;, according to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article. By 2002, Nickelodeon had rejected multiple Japanese series, considering them derivative or too mature for the channel&#x27;s target audience. In response, Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino pitched &quot;&quot;, and Nickelodeon ordered six episodes of the show. &quot;Avatar&quot; premiered in February 2005 to high ratings, after which Nickelodeon increased its order to 13 episodes and again to 20.

In the early 2000s, Nickelodeon briefly continued its strategy of adapting Nicktoon franchises into theatrical features. Executives at the company&#x27;s movie division decided to reconsider this approach after several films (&quot;Hey Arnold!: The Movie&quot; and &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot;) were met with poor financial and critical reception. According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Nickelodeon believed the &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; movie &quot;didn&#x27;t just fail but actually tarnished one of the company&#x27;s best selling points: its trustworthy brand name.&quot; Aside from &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; films, Nickelodeon Movies stopped producing animated theatrical features based on their shows.

In February 2005, high ratings from Butch Hartman&#x27;s two Nicktoons (&quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; and &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;) convinced the network to sign a multi-year deal with Hartman. As part of the agreement, Hartman developed original animated and live-action concepts for Nickelodeon and its sister channel, Noggin. In a statement, Hartman said, &quot;Working with everyone at Nickelodeon over the past several years has been hugely satisfying and I look forward to forging the same kind of terrific creative alliances with the folks at Noggin&quot;.

In October 2006, DreamWorks Animation (who was then in a distribution deal with Nickelodeon&#x27;s corporate sister Paramount Pictures) announced that it would partner to co-produce animated shows with the channel. The partnership resulted in three CGI-animated shows based on DreamWorks&#x27; character library: &quot;The Penguins of Madagascar&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness&quot;, and &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot;.

===Rebranding (2009–2017)===

In October 2009 and September 2010, respectively, Viacom brought &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and &quot;Winx Club&quot; into the Nickelodeon family by purchasing both franchises. Nickelodeon Animation Studio produced a new CGI-animated &quot;Turtles&quot; series and new seasons of &quot;Winx Club&quot; with CGI sequences. &quot;TMNT&quot; and &quot;Winx&quot; were both inducted into the Nicktoons franchise after Nickelodeon launched them. The two productions comprised Nickelodeon&#x27;s strategy to reboot two established brands for new viewers: &quot;TMNT&quot; was intended to reach an audience of boys aged 6 to 11, and &quot;Winx&quot; was aimed at the same age group of girls. In February 2011, Viacom bought out a third of Rainbow SpA, the Italian animation studio that introduced &quot;Winx Club&quot;. The purchase was valued at 62 million euros (US$83 million) and led to new shows being co-developed by Rainbow and Nickelodeon, including &quot;Club 57&quot; and a pilot for the Nickelodeon Animated Shorts Program called &quot;Crazy Block&quot;.

In the early 2010s, Nickelodeon executives searched for independent animations on the Internet, looking for original ideas. Chris Viscardi, who would later become Nickelodeon Animation&#x27;s senior vice president, stated that the studio desired to &quot;[get] back to more creator-driven things.&quot; Nickelodeon eventually came across two animations they enjoyed: &quot;The Forest City Rockers&quot; (a short series by Jay Howell and Jim Dirschberger) and &quot;Breadwinners&quot; (a stand-alone short by Gary DiRaffaele and Steve Borst). Howell and Dirschberger were recruited to develop &quot;Sanjay and Craig&quot; while DiRaffaele and Borst were asked to expand their &quot;Breadwinners&quot; short into a full series. &quot;Sanjay and Craig&quot; premiered first, on May 25, 2013. After its debut, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Robert Lloyd optimistically compared the show to the Nicktoons of the 1990s, writing that &quot;the goofy and delightful series ... represents a positive step back for the network to where it once belonged.&quot;

In the late 2010s, Nickelodeon revived three existing Nicktoons IP as one-off movies, including &quot;Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie&quot;, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life: Static Cling&quot;, and &quot;Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus&quot;. The first aired on the Nickelodeon channel in November 2017, while the latter two premiered in August 2019 on Netflix. Jhonen Vasquez, the creator of &quot;Invader Zim&quot;, stated in 2019 that the studio&#x27;s support for the revival films waned due to a shift in management: &quot;We had an immense amount of support throughout most of the production. Things just turn on a dime, people get axed, new people come in.&quot;

=== Expanding beyond cable (2018–present) ===
In 2018, Nickelodeon began to shift from focusing only on cable broadcasting to what it describes as a &quot;studio model&quot; that provides content for third-party companies. The decision was made based on the sharp decline of cable viewership due to the rise of streaming services. As part of this strategy, Nickelodeon announced that the series &quot;Pinky Malinky&quot; would release on Netflix as &quot;the first straight-to-Netflix Nicktoon&quot;. The series premiered on the platform on January 1, 2019. On November 13, 2019, Nickelodeon expanded their relationship with Netflix with the announcement of a multi-year output deal, under which Nickelodeon Animation Studio will produce &quot;original animated feature films and TV series based on both new and existing IP&quot;. On February 21, 2020, Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Glitch Techs&quot; premiered on Netflix, becoming the second Nicktoon to receive a digital only release.

===Climate===
Date has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Date is . The average annual rainfall is with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .
==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Date has declined over the past 70 years.

==History==
A whole body skeleton of Paleoparadoxia was excavated in Yanagawa on August 21, 1984. The skeleton is named the “Yanagawa Specimen”. The first humans to live within the bounds of present-day Date City are thought to have arrived during the Paleolithic Period. The area was part of ancient Mutsu Province. Towards the end of the Heian Period, Shinobu-gun (present day Fukushima City) and Date-gun (encompassing not only present day Date, but also Koori Town to the North and Kawamata Town to the South) were awarded to Date Tomomune. Tomomune founded the Date clan in present-day Hobara. The 17th lord of the Date Clan, Date Masamune lost control of the area and went on to found the Sendai Clan and the City of Sendai. The clan continued to rule over the Sendai Domain during the Edo period. However, under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate, most of the area of Date was initially part of Yonezawa Domain, followed by Fukushima Domain and Yanagawa Domain before becoming &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct control of the shogunate. It was not part of the Date Clan&#x27;s territories. After the Meiji Restoration, the area was organized as part of Nakadōri region of Iwaki Province.

As of 1889, at the time of the establishment of the modern municipalities system, the area consisted of 21 towns and villages. Between the years 1955 and 1960, these were consolidated into the five towns of Date (formerly the villages of Nagaoka and Fushiguro), Hobara (formerly the town of Hobara and the villages of Ooda, Kamihobara, Hashirazawa, and Tominari), Ryōzen (formerly the villages of Ryozen, Kakeda, Oguni, and Ishido), Tsukidate (formerly the villages of Ote and Otegawa), and Yanagawa (formerly the town of Yanagawa and the villages of Awano, Sekimoto, Shirane, Ooeda, Isazawa, Tomino, and Yamafunyuu), which merged to create the modern city of Date on January 1, 2006.

Date is about north-west of Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, the site of the nuclear accident that followed the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Although outside the nuclear accident exclusion zone, the levels of radiation in the city caused residents, and especially children, to remain indoors.

In 2016 an anime was produced in promotion of the city. Masamune Datenicle (政宗ダテニクル) features a young Date Masamune who meets a dragon deity that gives him the ability to call upon former leaders of the Date Clan.

==Government==
Date has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 22 members. Date, together with the three municipalities of Date District, collectively contribute three members to the Fukushima Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Fukushima 1st district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The economy of Date is primarily agricultural, with an emphasis on rice and horticulture. The area is noted for its peaches and dried persimmons.

Taiyo Yuden operates a metal power inductor production plant in the Yanagawa Industrial Zone in Date, Fukushima, which also produced CD, DVD and Blu-ray discs in the past.

=== Peaches ===
Date City&#x27;s location in central Fukushima (Nakadōri), in the middle of Fukushima Basin, helps in the cultivation of peaches. The most common varieties grown in the area are Akatsuki, Kawanakajima, and Yuuzora.

=== Dried Persimmons ===
As sericulture lost its place in the area during the Taisho period, the former village of Isazawa in Yanagawa replaced it with the production of dried persimmons, among other industries. Dried persimmons had been produced in the area since the Edo Period. However, the addition of sulfur fumigation as was used in the production of raisins in the United States, allowed for a much sweeter product. Whereas traditional dried persimmons, &quot;hoshigaki&quot;, have a tough skin and are almost black in color, those created with the additional step of sulfur fumigation, called &quot;anpogaki&quot; or &quot;tsurushigaki&quot;, are soft and bright orange.

Although the production of anpogaki was halted for three years after the 2011 disaster, Date City&#x27;s persimmon orchards have since been decontaminated and testing machines have been installed, ensuring the safety of the final product.

==Education==
Date City has fourteen public elementary schools, six public junior high schools, one public high school, and one private high school:

<text>&quot;Jingle Bells&quot; is one of the most commonly sung Christmas songs in the world. It was written by James Lord Pierpont. It is an unsettled question where and when Pierpont originally composed the song that would become known as &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;. It was published under the title &quot;The One Horse Open Sleigh&quot; in September 1857. Although it has no original connection to Christmas, it became associated with winter and Christmas in the 1860s and 1870s, and it was featured in a variety of parlor song and college anthologies in the 1880s. It was first recorded in 1889 on an Edison cylinder; this recording, believed to be the first Christmas record, is lost, but an 1898 recording—also from Edison Records—survives.

It has been claimed that the song was originally written to be sung by a Sunday school choir for Thanksgiving, or as a drinking song. However, these claims are not supported by any primary sources. According to more recent research, the song was originally written as a minstrel song satirizing Black participation in northern winter activities.

==History==
===Composition===


James Lord Pierpont originally copyrighted the song with the name &quot;The One Horse Open Sleigh&quot; on September 16, 1857. The songwriting credit given was &quot;Song and Chorus written and composed by J. Pierpont.&quot; Possibly intended as a drinking song, it did not become a Christmas song until decades after it was first performed. Pierpont dedicated the song to John P. Ordway, Esq., an organizer of a troupe called &quot;Ordway&#x27;s Aeolians&quot;.

It is an unsettled question where and when Pierpont originally composed the song that would become known as &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;. A plaque at 19 High Street in the center of Medford Square in Medford, Massachusetts, commemorates the &quot;birthplace&quot; of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, and claims that Pierpont wrote the song there in 1850, at what was then the Simpson Tavern. Previous local history narratives claim the song was inspired by the town&#x27;s popular sleigh races during the 19th century. Researcher Kyna Hamil proposes that the song was composed in Boston, before Pierpont moved to Savannah in the fall of 1857. 

The song was republished in 1859 by Oliver Ditson and Company, 277 Washington Street, Boston, with the new title &quot;Jingle Bells; or, The One Horse Open Sleigh&quot;. Its sheet music cover featured a drawing of sleigh bells around the title. Sleigh bells were strapped across the horse to make the jingle, jangle sound.

&quot;Jingle Bells&quot; was first performed on September 15, 1857, at Ordway Hall in Boston by blackface minstrel performer Johnny Pell. The song was in the then-popular style or genre of &quot;sleighing songs&quot;. Pierpont&#x27;s lyrics are strikingly similar to lines from many other popular sleigh-riding songs of the time; researcher Kyna Hamill argued that this, along with his constant need for money, led him to compose and release the song solely as a financial enterprise: &quot;Everything about the song is churned out and copied from other people and lines from other songs—there&#x27;s nothing original about it.&quot;

By the time the song was released and copyrighted, Pierpont had relocated to Savannah, Georgia, to serve as organist and music director of that city&#x27;s Unitarian Church (now Unitarian Universalist), where his brother, Rev. John Pierpont Jr., served as minister. In August 1857, Pierpont married Eliza Jane Purse, daughter of the mayor of Savannah. Pierpont remained in Savannah and never returned north.

The double meaning of &quot;upsot&quot; (an old variant of the past tense of &quot;upset&quot;) was thought humorous, as a sleigh ride gave an unescorted couple a rare chance to be together, unchaperoned, in distant woods or fields, with all the opportunities that afforded. This upset became the climactic component of a sleigh-ride outing within the sleigh narrative.

===Recordings and performances===
James Lord Pierpont&#x27;s 1857 composition &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; became one of the most performed and most recognizable secular holiday songs ever written, not only in the United States, but around the world. In recognition of this achievement, James Lord Pierpont was voted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

&quot;Jingle Bells&quot; was first recorded by banjoist Will Lyle on October 30, 1889 (attested A T E Wangemann Logbook, p. 114), on an Edison cylinder, but no surviving copies are known to exist. The earliest surviving vocal recording was made by the Edison Male Quartette in 1898, also on an Edison cylinder (and 1898 Columbia brown wax 4090), as part of a &#x27;Christmas&#x27; medley titled &quot;Sleigh Ride Party&quot;. There is a version by the Hayden Quartet called Sleigh Ride Party recorded in 1901. In 1902, the Hayden Quartet recorded &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;. The song became a Christmas favorite in the early twentieth century.

In 1935, Benny Goodman and His Orchestra reached No. 18 on the charts with their Swing or big band recording of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;. In 1941, Glenn Miller and His Orchestra with Tex Beneke, Marion Hutton, Ernie Caceres, and the Modernaires on vocals had a No. 5 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles chart with a big band arrangement of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; on RCA Victor as Bluebird 11353-A. In 1943, Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters recorded &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; as Decca 23281 which reached No. 19 on the charts and sold over a million copies. In 1951, Les Paul had a No. 10 hit with a multi-tracked version on guitar. In 2001, House of Mouse version, sung by Wayne Allwine, Russi Taylor, and Bill Farmer. In 2006, Kimberley Locke had a No. 1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart with a recording of the song.

===First song in space===
&quot;Jingle Bells&quot; was one of the first songs to be broadcast from space, in a Christmas-themed prank by Gemini 6 astronauts Tom Stafford and Wally Schirra. While in space on December 16, 1965, they sent this report to Mission Control:

The astronauts then produced a smuggled harmonica and sleigh bells, and with Schirra on the harmonica and Stafford on the bells, broadcast a rendition of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;. The harmonica, shown to the press upon their return, was a Hohner &quot;Little Lady&quot;, a tiny harmonica approximately long, by wide. From 1967, Smithsonian kept this historical relic.

==Lyrics==
Music historian James Fuld notes that (as opposed to an adjective), &quot;the word &quot;jingle&quot; in the title and opening phrase is apparently an imperative verb.&quot; In the winter in New England in pre-automobile days, it was common to adorn horses&#x27; harnesses with straps bearing bells as a way to avoid collisions at blind intersections, since a horse-drawn sleigh in snow produces almost no audible noise. The rhythm of the tune apparently mimics that of a trotting horse&#x27;s bells; however, &quot;jingle bells&quot; is commonly interpreted to mean a certain kind of bell.

Jingle Bells
&lt;poem&gt;
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O&#x27;er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight! 

:Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells,
:Jingle all the way.
:Oh! what fun it is to ride
:In a one-horse open sleigh. Hey! 
:Jingle bells, jingle bells,
:Jingle all the way;
:Oh! what fun it is to ride
:In a one-horse open sleigh.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Although less well-known than the opening, the remaining verses depict high-speed youthful fun. In the second verse, the narrator takes a ride with a girl and loses control of the sleigh:
&lt;poem&gt;
A day or two ago
I thought I&#x27;d take a ride
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side,
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And then we got .
::|: chorus :|
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the next verse (which is often skipped), he falls out of the sleigh and a rival laughs at him:
&lt;poem&gt;
A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow,
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away. Ah! 
::|: chorus :|
&lt;/poem&gt;
In the last verse, after relating his experience, he gives advice to a friend to pick up some girls, find a faster horse, and take off at full speed:
&lt;poem&gt;
Now the ground is white
Go it while you&#x27;re young,
Take the girls tonight
and sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bobtailed bay
Two forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And snap! You&#x27;ll take the lead.
::|: chorus :|
&lt;/poem&gt;

Notes to lyrics
===Original lyrics===
The two first stanzas and chorus of the original 1857 lyrics differed slightly from those known today. It is unknown who replaced the words with those of the modern version. Underlined lyrics are the removed lyrics from the original version. Bold lyrics are the new lyrics in the current version.
&lt;poem&gt;
Dashing thro&#x27; the snow,
In a one-horse open sleigh,
O&#x27;er the (fields) we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob tail ring,
Making spirits bright,
 (What fun it is) to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

::|: chorus :|
:Jingle bells, jingle bells,
:Jingle all the way;
:Oh! what (fun) it is to ride
:In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago
I tho&#x27;t I&#x27;d take a ride
And soon Miss Fannie Bright
Was seated by my side.
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And (then) we got upsot.

&lt;/poem&gt;

==Melody==

The original 1857 version of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; featured a substantially different chorus. The progression of descending chords in the original refrain (A–E/G–Fm–C–D–A/E–E7–A; in Roman numeral analysis, I–V6–vi–V/vi–IV–I–V7–I) bears some resemblance to that of Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon. The verses, on the other hand, have mostly the same melody (with some minor simplifications) in modern renditions as they did in 1857. The origin of the simpler, modern refrain is unknown, but it dates back at least 1898, when the oldest surviving phonograph recording of the song was released through Edison Records.

The &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; tune is used in French and German songs, although the lyrics are unrelated to the English lyrics. Both songs celebrate winter fun, as in the English version. The French song, titled &quot;Vive le vent&quot; (&quot;Long Live the Wind&quot;), was written by Francis Blanche and contains references to Father Time, Baby New Year, and New Year&#x27;s Day. There are several German versions of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, including Roy Black&#x27;s &quot;Ein kleiner weißer Schneemann&quot;.

==Parodies and homages==

Like many simple, catchy, and popular melodies, &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; is often the subject of parody. &quot;Jingle Bells, Batman Smells&quot; has been a well-known parody since the mid-1960s, with many variations on the lyrics. It has been referenced several times in official Batman media, notably appearing in the second episode of &quot;&quot;, &quot;Christmas with the Joker&quot;. It also appears in the first episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;, which led the series to be misattributed with creating the parody.

Parodies or novelty versions of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; have been recorded by many artists, and include Yogi Yorgesson&#x27;s &quot;Yingle Bells&quot;, Da Yoopers&#x27; &quot;Rusty Chevrolet&quot;, Bucko and Champs&#x27; &quot;Aussie Jingle Bells&quot;, The Three Stooges&#x27; &quot;Jingle Bell Drag&quot;, and Jeff Dunham&#x27;s &quot;Jingle Bombs&quot;, performed in his &quot;Achmed the Dead Terrorist&quot; sketch. Another popular spoof of the song is &quot;Pumpkin Bells&quot;, a &quot;Pumpkin Carol&quot; which celebrates Halloween and the &quot;Great Pumpkin&quot;. It originated in &quot;The Peanuts Book of Pumpkin Carols&quot;, a booklet based on the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip and published by Hallmark Cards in the 1960s.

The Australian &quot;Aussie Jingle Bells&quot; written by Colin Buchanan, broadly translates the idea of the original song to the summertime Christmas of the Southern hemisphere, making reference to a Holden ute and Kelpie.

&quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; by Bobby Helms pays homage to &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, directly referencing the source song&#x27;s lyrics, but with a different melody. Originally recorded and released by Helms in a rockabilly style, &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; has itself since become a Christmas standard.

&quot;Tintinabulations&quot; is a novelty arrangement of the song for full orchestra by American Katherine W. Punwar. It consists of 19th and 20th century stylistic variations of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; and is sometimes performed by classical orchestras for their Christmas concerts.

The first notes in the chorus have become a motif that has been inserted into recordings of other Christmas songs, most notably at the beginning and end of Bing Crosby&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas&quot;; a guitar passage at the end of Nat King Cole&#x27;s &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;; and Clarence Clemons performing a saxophone solo in the middle of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Merry Christmas Baby&quot;. A piano is also heard playing these notes at the end of Springsteen&#x27;s version of &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;. A slow version of the chorus opening forms the conclusion of Stan Freberg&#x27;s 1957 &quot;Green Chri$tma$&quot;, interspersed with cash-register noises. Mariah Carey utilizes a bit of the melody in her song &quot;When Christmas Comes&quot;. Joni Mitchell&#x27;s 1971 song &quot;River&quot; begins with a melancholy version of the chorus on piano.

<doc id="874512" wikidata="Q1115201" url="?curid=874512" title="Lake Chelan">
<text>Lake Chelan ( ) is a narrow, long lake in Chelan County, north-central Washington state, U.S. It is an overdeepened lake and resembles a fjord, with an average width of . Near its upper end, the lake surface lies more than below peaks less than away. Before 1927, Lake Chelan was the largest natural lake in the state in terms of both surface area and water volume. Upon the completion of Lake Chelan Dam in 1927, the elevation of the lake was increased by to its present maximum-capacity elevation of . 

With a maximum depth of , Lake Chelan is the third deepest lake in the United States behind Crater Lake, the deepest, and Lake Tahoe, the second deepest. Because of overdeepening, the sides of this lake drop steeply to its bottom. The deepest part of Lake Chelan lies as much as below sea level. In places, the bedrock floor of the valley occupied by Lake Chelan, which is buried by Pleistocene glacial and lacustrine sediments, lies at least below sea level. Two communities lie on the southern end of the lake, and a third sits at the far north end, providing a gateway to North Cascades National Park.

==Hydrology==
On an annual basis, an average of flow into the lake. Approximately 75% of the water that flows into the lake comes from two tributaries. The Stehekin River alone contributes 65% of all water to Lake Chelan, averaging annually. The other major tributary, Railroad Creek, averages annually. The remaining water is added via a number of smaller tributaries as well as direct rain and snowfall.

With a maximum depth of , Lake Chelan is the third deepest lake in the United States, and the 25th deepest in the world. At its deepest, the lake bottom is below sea level. The total watershed of the lake is More than 90% of the watershed is forested land. The remainder of the basin is composed of the lake itself (5.6%) and agriculture (3.5%).

==Geology==
The fjord-like topography of the Lake Chelan valley results from repeated glacial erosion and deposition (maybe nine or ten times) during the Pleistocene Period. The last episode of glacial erosion and deposition in the basin occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum about 21,000 years ago. At that time, in the upper Similkameen River valley of British Columbia, the Skagit Lobe split from the Okanogan Lobe of the Cordilleran ice sheet and advanced south into the Skagit River drainage. Skagit ice passed through Fisher and Rainy passes, and down Bridge Creek into the Lake Chelan valley. The glacial lobe flowed down the Lake Chelan valley until meeting glacial ice of the main Okanogan Lobe advancing up the valley from the Columbia River drainage near Manson. The deposits of the northwestward advancing Okanagan lobe are characterized by large, basalt glacial erratics. As the Skagit Lobe during the Last Glacial Maximum and glacial lobes during older glaciations flowed to the southeast down the Lake Chelan valley, they excavated the deep glacial trough that is now occupied by Lake Chelan. The depth of the Lucerne Basin and the elevation of glacial till and moraines and glacier-scoured bedrock on the walls of the overdeepened Lake Chelan valley indicates that the thickness of the Skagit Lobe was over .

===Basins===
Lake Chelan is composed of two basins. The lower basin, Wapato, is shallower and approximately a fourth the total length of the lake. The upper basin, Lucerne, is much deeper and extends for the remainder of the length of the lake. The two basins are separated by a sill rising to within of the surface, at a point known as the narrows, at which the lake is only wide.

The lower basin, Wapato, reaches a maximum depth of only . About of glacial sediment and rockslide deposits rest on top of the bedrock. This section of the lake is long, and has an average depth of . Due to the relatively modest size of this basin, water resides in this basin for only 0.8 years, compared to 10 for Lucerne Basin. The upper Lucerne basin is long with an average depth of and thus by far the larger of the two basins. It is in this part of the lake that the maximum depth of is found. Lucerne basin contains 92% of the water in Lake Chelan and 74% of the surface area, leaving Wapato with only 8% of the total volume of water and 26% of the surface area. The upper basin of Lake Chelan is surrounded by more mountainous terrain, resulting in few beaches along the shoreline. Approximately of the shoreline of this basin are in National Forest lands, and in National Park lands.

==Natural history==
===Climate===
The climate of Lake Chelan&#x27;s watershed is varied. From the southern end of the lake in the rain shadow of the Cascade Range, to the northern tip of the lake located in the eastern Cascades, the climate of Lake Chelan&#x27;s watershed is as diverse as the lake is long. The south end&#x27;s weather is notably dry, with Chelan averaging only of rain per year, along with of snow. Stehekin receives an average of of rain per year, and of snow. Other than precipitation trends, the climates are remarkably similar. Both locations average around for a high, and for a low throughout the course of the year.
==History==
===Etymology===
The name Chelan is a Salish Indigenous word, &quot;&quot;Tsi - Laan&quot;,&quot; meaning &#x27;Deep Water&#x27;.
===Cities===
Due to the isolated nature of Lake Chelan, especially at its northern reaches, there is not a large population that resides along the shore. Chelan, which had 4,222 residents at the 2020 census, is currently the only incorporated city situated along the lake shore. The city is located at the southern terminus of the lake, adjacent to the Lake Chelan Dam and the Chelan River outflow. The census-designated place of Manson, which had 1,523 residents in 2020, is also located at the southern end of the lake. The unincorporated community of Stehekin, with approximately 75 residents, is located at the northern terminus of the lake, adjacent to the Stehekin River inflow. At the mouth of the Railroad Creek sits Lucerne, a small community of private cabins served by commercial boats. Lucerne is also the primary gateway to the community of Holden Village, a Lutheran retreat center located inland from the lake. With approximately 50 long-term residents, Holden includes one of the few remaining public K-12 two-room schools in the contiguous United States.

==Economy==

===Fishing===
Fishing is a popular recreating activity on Lake Chelan. The following fish are or were native to the lake: Bull Trout, Westslope cutthroat trout, Largescale sucker, Longnose sucker, Bridgelip sucker, Northern pikeminnow, Peamouth, Redside shiner, Mountain whitefish, Pygmy whitefish.

In addition to these native species, six species have been introduced to the lake, primarily for sport fishing purposes: Yellowstone cutthroat trout, Rainbow trout, Kokanee, Brook trout, Chinook salmon, Lake trout

====State records====
In 2013, a Lake Trout was caught, setting the state record.

=== Winemaking ===
The Lake Chelan AVA surrounds the southernmost 12 miles of Lake Chelan. A subzone of the larger Columbia Valley AVA, the Lake Chelan AVA is home to 31 tasting rooms.

==Protected lands==
At the north end of the lake, surrounding the town of Stehekin, is Lake Chelan National Recreation Area (NRA). Bordering the Lake Chelan NRA is the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness. The Wenatchee National Forest surrounds much of the lake on either side. Two state parks are located on the southern edge, not far from the city of Chelan. These state parks are Twenty-Five Mile Creek State Park and Lake Chelan State Park.

In addition to the protected land located directly on the shores of Lake Chelan, Stehekin serves not only as a gateway to the Lake Chelan NRA, but also to the rest of the North Cascades National Park Complex, Stephen Mather Wilderness, and adjacent National Forest Wilderness Areas. Approximately 87% of the Lake Chelan watershed is owned by either federal, state, or local entities, with the rest in private ownership.

<doc id="874513" wikidata="Q8048219" url="?curid=874513" title="Yanagawa, Fukushima">
<text>is one of five neighborhoods within the city of Date, Fukushima, along with the former towns of Date, Hobara, Ryōzen and Tsukidate (all from Date District). Until 2006, it was an independent castle town located in Date District, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 20,626 and a density of 248.72 persons per km2. The total area is 82.93 km2.

== History ==

Yanagawa was under the control of the Date Clan from 1189, when Date Tomomune received the land, until Date Masamune forfeited it to Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1590. In 1598, the entire Fukushima Basin (Shintatsu Plain) became the territory of Uesugi Kagekatsu and Suda Nagayoshi became the lord of Yanagawa Castle.

By 1960, the town of Yanagawa had merged with the villages of Awano, Sekimoto, Shirane, Ooeda, Isazawa, Tomino, and Yamafunyuu. The town&#x27;s symbol was established in 1965, and in 1983, cherry blossoms, persimmon trees, and wagtails were designated as the town&#x27;s official flower, tree, and bird, respectively.

A whole body skeleton of Paleoparadoxia was excavated in Yanagawa on August 21, 1984. The skeleton is named the “Yanagawa Specimen”.

In 2006, Yanagawa merged with the towns of Date, Hobara, Ryōzen and Tsukidate, creating Date City.

=== Yanagawa Castle ===

Yanagawa Castle was constructed in the Kamakura Period and used as the headquarters of the Date Clan from the time of the 11th lord of the Date Clan, Date Mochimune, through to that of the 14th lord, Date Tanemune. Mochimune&#x27;s son, the 12th lord, Date Shigemune was influenced by Higashiyama Culture and built the inner garden, including Shinji Pond, which is still visible at the site today. The 17th lord of the Date Clan, Date Masamune stayed at Yanagawa Castle when the last member of the Date Clan to own the castle, Date Tessai Nyuudou resided there.

=== Summer Festival ===
Held in August, hundreds of people dress in yukata and parade down the main street, performing the local bon odori dance. This is followed by an address by the mayor, a series of performances, and a fireworks show.

=== Specialty Products ===
In 2019, a specialty product of Yanagawa, the &quot;&quot;Niku goro to onigiri&quot;,&quot; was awarded first place among onigiri in the Bento and Prepared Meal Awards (お弁当・お惣菜大賞). It is prepared using local, &quot;Date chicken&quot; and only available at the Machi no Eki Yanagawa, a community center in the center of the town.

<doc id="874515" wikidata="Q5874645" url="?curid=874515" title="Hobara, Fukushima">
<text>is one of five neighborhoods within the city of Date, Fukushima, along with the towns of Date, Yanagawa, Ryozen, and Tsukidate. Until the merger of all five towns in 2006, Hobara was a town located in Date District, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan.

At that time, studies reported the town had an estimated population of 24,491 people and a density of 583.25 persons per km². The total area was 41.99 km².

== History ==

The town&#x27;s symbol was designed in 1957, mixing the katakana character for &quot;ho,&quot; as in &quot;Hobara&quot; and the character for &quot;en&quot; or yen.

In 1960, the town of Hobara and the villages of Ooda, Kamihobara, Hashirazawa, and Tominari merged, retaining the name &quot;Hobara.&quot;

In 1979, peach blossoms, the Japanese red pine, and the common cuckoo were designated the town&#x27;s official flower, tree, and bird, respectively.

On January 1, 2006, Hobara, along with the towns of Date, Ryōzen, Tsukidate and Yanagawa (all from Date District), was merged to create Date City.

==Events==

===Tsutsuko-biki Festival===
Tsutsuko-biki is a yearly festival that happens in Hobara on the first Sunday in March. Men from upper, lower, and central Hobara pull at three sides of a &quot;tsutsuko&quot; (meaning a &quot;tawara&quot; or straw bag) containing mochi. In the past, when the town market was held on the 5th and 10th of every month, this festival was held on January 24 to decide which section of the town would have the right to host the market.

Local legend states that the festival began when a severe famine broke out during the Kyōhō Era (1716-1736) in the mid-Edo Period. The lord of Yanagawa at that time, Matsudaira Michiharu (later known as Tokugawa Muneharu), gathered the locals and gave them rice seeds that provided a great harvest the following year. The event is a Shinto ritual of Itsukushima Shrine.

===Momo Marathon===
There is a yearly &quot;Momo Marathon&quot; (Peach Marathon) which passes through Hobara each summer.

==Folk Tales and Local Legends==

===Shinkeibo===
Shinkeibo (真敬坊) was a Japanese monk who travelled through Hobara during a plague and was able to treat the villagers, saving them from their sickness. Shinkeibo was asked by the villagers to stay in the town permanently, but stories vary as to whether he resumed wandering or spent the rest of his life in Hobara. Shinkeibo is still considered a hero for his help.

===Bomaka===
Bomaka (ぼまか) is the name of a playful spirit that caused trouble to residents of Hobara for approximately one year. Little is known about him beyond his great power and mischievous nature.

===Kamekyo===
Kamekyo is the name of a spirit that resides in a local shrine, Itsukushima Shrine (厳島神社) in Hobara. Local legends include tales in which Kamekyo, a childlike spirit, plays with village children or helps villagers in times of famine or poverty.

==Local Foods==

===Mame Kojiru===
Mame Kojiru (豆っこ汁) is a kind of bean used in making dango, a dumpling that is eaten both on its own and as an additive (in miso soup broth, for instance). Mame Kojiru is considered to be a creation native to Hobara.

== Local Attractions ==

=== Takako Lake ===
A short walk from Takako Station, Takako Lake is located in Kamihobara&#x27;s area of Takako. According to legend, when the area changed hands from the 17th lord of the Date Clan, Date Masamune to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, locals rushed to hide any trace of the local gold smelting works from the incoming rulers by submerging them in the lake. Alleged sightings of medieval millstones and other tools continued on into the Showa Period.

=== Takako&#x27;s Twenty Scenic Views ===
The Takako Twenty Scenic Views (高子二十境 &quot;Takako Ni-juu Kyou&quot;) are twenty sites chosen and named by three generations of the Kumasaka family, who wrote &quot;kanshi&quot; poems in commemoration of each of these sites. These poems are inscribed on white land markers at each of the twenty sites. A guided tour of the twenty sites is held annually, featuring detailed explanations of each stop along the two courses offered (8 km and 6 km) as well as performances of local folk songs and a raffle in which anyone who participates may be rewarded with locally grown grapes.

The Twenty Scenic Views include:

# &quot;Tanroban&quot; (丹露盤 &quot;Red Rock of Dew&quot;)
# &quot;Gyokutogan&quot; (玉兎巖 &quot;Moon Hare Rock&quot;)
# &quot;Chōshōrei&quot; (長嘯嶺 &quot;Recitation Ridge&quot;)
# &quot;Ryuusekigan&quot; (龍脊巖 &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Back&quot;)
# &quot;Saishigai&quot; (彩芝崖 &quot;Herb Gatherer&#x27;s Cliff&quot;)
# &quot;Kiunkutsu&quot; (帰雲窟 &quot;Cloud&#x27;s Cave&quot;)
# &quot;Shoukihan&quot; (将帰阪 &quot;Home Coming Hill&quot;)
# &quot;Rishukō&quot; (狸首岡 &quot;Badger Hill&quot;)
# &quot;Insen&quot; (隠泉 &quot;Hidden Spring&quot;)
# &quot;Kōshihi&quot; (高子陂 &quot;Takako Lake&quot;)
# &quot;Fukiō&quot; (不羈拗 &quot;Freedom Basin&quot;)
# &quot;Jūsuigai&quot; (拾翆崖 &quot;Jade Picker&#x27;s Cliff&quot;)
# &quot;Henshōgen&quot; (返照原 &quot;Sundance Meadow&quot;)
# &quot;Sōmarei&quot; (走馬嶺 &quot;Galloping Horse Ridge&quot;)
# &quot;Hakurohō&quot; (白鷺峰 &quot;White Heron Peak&quot;)
# &quot;Uzan&quot; (雩山 &quot;Rain Dance Mountain&quot;)
# &quot;Ufuzan&quot; (禹父山 &quot;Pioneer&#x27;s Hill&quot;)
# &quot;Gukōkoku&quot; (愚公谷 &quot;Old Fool&#x27;s Valley&quot;)
# &quot;Haku&#x27;undou&quot; (白雲洞 &quot;White Cloud Cave&quot;)
# &quot;Koshōkyuu&quot; (古樵丘 &quot;Old Logger Hill&quot;)

Also referred to as &quot;Takakogaoka-kan&quot; or &quot;Takakogaoka Hall,&quot; Tanroban, the first of the Takako Twenty Scenic Views is also the former site of a castle built by Date Tomomune. This was the first structure built by Tomomune upon arriving in Date. As such, it is considered the founding place of the Date Clan. At the mountain peak is the Kameoka Hachimangu Shrine. The shrine&#x27;s white &quot;torii&quot; gate stands at the foot of the site.

=== Historic Sites ===

==== Mount Ryozen and Kitabatake Akiie ====
Mount Ryōzen is a mountain on the border of Soma City that stands at 825 meters. During the Heian Period, the original Ryōzen Temple (or Ryōzen-ji; not to be confused with Ryōzen Shrine, which was founded in 1881) was constructed on Mount Ryōzen, where it flourished as a center of Buddhist learning in the North for hundreds of years. During the War of the Northern and Southern Courts, otherwise known as the Nanboku-cho War, then governor of the province of Mutsu, Kitabatake Akiie had Ryozen Castle constructed within the temple grounds and stayed there for a number of months between military campaigns. Having left Ryōzen to pursue Ashikaga Takauji, Akiie died in battle at the young age of twenty-one. A statue of Akiie stands at the foot of Mount Ryōzen, at one entrance to Ryōzen Shrine, where he is enshrined with his father, Kitabatake Chikafusa.

==== Mount Chausu and Princess Gozen ====
Mount Chausu is a mountain standing at 252.5 meters in the former town of Kakeda, that is thought to have been the site of Kakeda Castle. Kakeda Castle was destroyed by Kakeda Yoshimune during the Tenbun Revolt, a civil war within the Date Clan that began in the eleventh year of the Tenbun Era (1542), when the 14th lord of the clan, Date Tanemune had a falling out with his son, Date Harumune, the 15th lord of the Date Clan. One reason for the rebellion was Tanemune&#x27;s manner of gaining power through the marriage of his children. Tanemune&#x27;s daughter, Kakeda Gozen, is said to have been in a relation with a retainer by the name of Nakajima Ise. Ise took advantage of the commotion caused by the revolt and brought Princess Gozen away to Kanayama Castle in Miyagi Prefecture&#x27;s Marumori Town. Princess Gozen is then said to have thrown herself into a well out of grief. A Kan&#x27;non Temple on Mount Chausu is dedicated to her memory.

* Hie Shrine
* Ryōzen Kōsaikan (a hotel and bathhouse)

=== Ryōzen Taiko Drum Festival ===
The Ryōzen Taiko Drum Festival (霊山太鼓まつり) or Date na Taiko Drum Festival (だてな太鼓まつり) is an annual two-day festival held in August. While the festival originated in the town of Ryōzen, in recent years it has been held at Hobara Total Park (保原総合公園) in Hobara Town, the central area of Date City. There is usually a comedic performance, among other stage acts, food and activity booths, as well as a battle between teams of taiko drum performers.

<text>is a town in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 12917 in 5414 households, and a population density of 110 persons per km2. The total area of the town was .

Kawamata is known for its production of silk and silk products. In the late 6th century, Ōtomo no Koteko, also known as Otehime, came to this area. According to tradition, she is honored for having encouraged silk farming in the area. The town is also known for the raising of &quot;shamo&quot;, a special breed of game bird similar to chicken. Shamo ramen is a local speciality.

Kawamata&#x27;s main annual event is the &quot;Cosquín en Japón&quot; festival, a three-day celebration of traditional Argentinian music and dance, which is held each year in October.

==Geography==
The geographic area of Kawamata is approximately 10 km east-to-west and 20 km north-to-south; the total land area is 127.66 km2. It has an altitude of 201.2 m as measured at the site of the municipal office. Kawamata is located at the confluence of two local rivers, the Hirose and the Isazawa, from which the town&#x27;s name (meaning &quot;river fork&quot;) is derived. Several other small rivers and streams run through the town.

There are four designated mountains in Kawamata: Mt. Kōdaishi (863 m), Mt. Hakubaishi (821 m), Mt. Kuchibuto (842 m), and Mt. Hanazuka (918 m).

===Subdivisions===
The central town consists of the Kawamata neighborhood and parts of Tsuruzawa, Kogami, and Iizaka. The remaining areas are outlying neighborhoods:
* (Central) Kawamata
* Tsuruzawa
* Kogami
* Iizaka
* Ōtsunagi
* Kotsunagi
* Higashi-Fukuzawa
* Nishi-Fukuzawa
* Ojima
* Akiyama (also called Fukuda)
* Yamakiya

====Yamakiya====
The former village of is the largest and most sparsely populated region of Kawamata, as well as the most physically isolated. It is located in the mountains to the south-east of the central town; at 37.40 km2, it occupies almost one third of Kawamata&#x27;s geographic area. Within Kawamata, Yamakiya retains some of its own distinct cultural characteristics. Yamakiya is home to the Yamakiya Taiko Club, an amateur &quot;taiko&quot; drum performance group made up of young people from the community. In April 2012, several members of the club travelled to Washington, DC in the US for the 100th anniversary of the National Cherry Blossom Festival as part of a cultural exchange initiative.

One of Yamakiya&#x27;s prominent facilities is the Yamakiya Skating Rink, an outdoor ice rink which is normally open during January and early February. Speed skating competitions are held for local school children every year.

The Yamakiya region was placed under mandatory evacuation (classified as a &quot;planned evacuation zone&quot;) due to elevated levels of radiation following the 2011 earthquake and nuclear crisis. As of 10 August 2013, the evacuation status of Yamakiya was reorganized, with the majority of the area being redesignated as &quot;an area readying for the lifting of evacuation orders&quot;, and a small area by the Namie border to remain restricted. The actual evacuation status may be lifted in spring of 2016.

==Climate==
Kawamata has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Kawamata is . The average annual rainfall is with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, like many rural Japanese communities, Kawamata has suffered from a shrinking population over the past few decades. From a high of more than 27,000 in 1950, the population has decreased to only 15,010 in 2012. This has been correlated with a reduction in available services, including the shutting down of the Kawamata Line railway in 1972, and the closing or merging of several schools.

==History==
The area of present-day Kawamata was part of ancient Mutsu Province. Numerous Jōmon period ruins have been found in the area. During the Edo period, it was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate. After the Meiji Restoration, it was organized as part of Adachi District in the Nakadōri region of Iwaki Province with the creation of the modern municipalities system.

The origin of modern Kawamata goes back to 1876, when Kawamata Village was established; the community was subsequently redesignated as Kawamata Town with the establishment of the municipalities system on 1 April 1889. In 1955, seven neighboring villages – Fukuda, Iizaka, Kotsunagi, Ōtsunagi, Ojima, Tomita, and Yamakiya – were merged into Kawamata Town, leading to the current municipal boundaries.

Kawamata&#x27;s official emblem, a stylized か (&quot;ka&quot;) hiragana designed to resemble a bird in flight, was adopted in 1965.

===2011 earthquake and Fukushima nuclear disaster===
Kawamata was impacted in a number of ways by the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. As an inland community, the town was not directly affected by the tsunami. However, power outages lasting up to several days (depending on area) occurred. Several buildings, including the municipal office building, suffered significant structural damage and were subsequently evacuated.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant initially led to the establishment of a 30 km exclusion zone around the power station. Although Kawamata was located outside this region, in April 2011, the Japanese government established additional evacuation areas which included the Yamakiya neighborhood of Kawamata. The evacuation order will be lifted on 31 March 2017. Controls had been relaxed in August 2013 permitting decontamination work to start.

==Economy==
The traditional industries of Kawamata were historically agriculture and textiles. Rice farming, &quot;shamo&quot; chicken, and silk goods all remain culturally important. In recent years, the manufacturing of products such as automobile parts has also become prominent.

==Education==
As of 2012, Kawamata had six public elementary schools and two junior high schools operated by the town government. The town also operates five half-day kindergartens, and one full-day nursery school. The is one public high school operated by the Fukushima Prefectural Board of Education. Since 2011 a number of schools (kindergarten through junior high school) from neighbouring Iitate village have been housed inside temporary facilities in Kawamata.

===Kindergartens and nursery schools===
* 
* 
* (currently sharing facilities with Kawamata-Minami Kindergarten)

===Elementary schools===

* (currently housed inside Kawamata-Minami Elementary School)

Kawamata-Minami Elementary School was founded in 1985 from the merger of two former schools: Ōtsunagi Elementary School and Kotsunagi Elementary School. Similarly, Tomita Elementary School was founded in 1989 from the merger of Tsuruzawa and Kogami Elementary Schools.

Two other schools, and , were closed down in March 2008 due to declining enrollment. Students from these two schools were moved into Kawamata Elementary School.

Following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the former Ojima Elementary School building, now a community centre, was temporarily used to house evacuees from several other municipalities close to the damaged Fukushima I nuclear power station.

===Junior high schools===
* (currently housed inside Kawamata Junior High School)

Originally, various districts of Kawamata had their own junior high schools. In 1974, all except Yamakiya Junior High School were merged into Kawamata Junior High School.

===High schools===

==Transportation==
===Railway===
*Kawamata is not served by any passenger train lines. The nearest railway station is Matsukawa Station on the Tōhoku Main Line. Kawamata itself has had no railway service since 1972, when the former Kawamata Line from Matsukawa, operated by Japanese National Railways (JNR), was abolished.

===Highways===

<text>Title of Record is the second studio album by American rock band Filter, released on August 24, 1999, by Reprise Records. The album&#x27;s earlier sessions were marred with slow progress due to lineup changes and frontman Richard Patrick&#x27;s decision to construct his own studio for recording. However, progress improved after solidifying the lineup and bringing in further production help. In support of the album&#x27;s release, Filter performed on the 1999 Family Values Tour.

&quot;Title of Record&quot; was a critical and commercial success upon its release, peaking at number 30 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It had sold over 800,000 copies by 2001 and was later certified platinum by the RIAA for shipments of over one million copies. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Welcome to the Fold&quot;, &quot;Take a Picture&quot;, and &quot;The Best Things&quot;. &quot;Take a Picture&quot; became the band&#x27;s most successful single, peaking within the top-20 of nine international charts, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Background==
The album was created over an exhaustive four-year period. After the release of Filter&#x27;s 1995 debut &quot;Short Bus&quot;, which was created entirely by frontman Richard Patrick, Brian Liesegang, and a drum machine, the band toured in support of the album throughout 1996. In order to do this, a live band was recruited, consisting of Geno Lenardo on guitar, Frank Cavanaugh on bass, and Matt Walker on drums.

Reports of working on a second album started to arise in early 1997. Initial plans involved Patrick and Liesegang working together on a second album in a similar manner as their first album. Liesegang initially spoke of traveling across North America and recording on a PowerBook whenever inspiration hit them. He referred to a tentative title as &quot;Longbutter&quot;, a tentative release date of September 1997, and hinted of moving in a more electronic direction now that the band had established themselves as different from Nine Inch Nails, of which they had both been a part prior to Filter. Prior to formal recording sessions for a new album, the two wrote and released a few songs on movie soundtracks, most notably the electronic rock track &quot;(Can&#x27;t You) Trip Like I Do&quot; with the Crystal Method, which proved to be a turning-point for the two. The sessions strengthened Liesegang&#x27;s conviction to move into more of an electronic, Radiohead-type musical direction, whereas it had the opposite effect on Patrick, inspiring him to keep the music heavy and guitar oriented.

With the two both unable to agree on how to proceed, constant arguing and power struggles ensued. Patrick&#x27;s collaboration with The Crystal Method had also opened his mind to collaborating with different musicians, leading him to start attempting to push Liesegang out of the band. The resulting tensions and fighting led Lenardo, Cavanaugh, and Walker all to leave first. Relations between Patrick and Liesegang continued to deteriorate, and by mid-1997, due to Patrick&#x27;s &quot;creative dominance&quot;, Liesegang quit the band as well, leaving Patrick as the sole member.

Patrick, now on his own, attempted to restart the sessions for the album, but experienced further roadblocks:
 &quot;I kind of had to hit rock bottom. I didn&#x27;t have a band. I didn&#x27;t have a studio. I had this platinum record that showed up in the mail, and I had nothing except for my own talents. So at some point, I forced myself to play the guitar. I would force myself to write lyrics. I was playing people&#x27;s demos. I was still into the band. It&#x27;s just that I didn&#x27;t have anything. 
Patrick opted to start over by building his own studio, called &quot;Abyssinian Son&quot;; however, this ended up being far more complicated and time-consuming than he expected, with over two years going into dealing with realtors, property leases, and contractors to get the studio in functioning shape. Once preparations were complete, Patrick met up with, and started early sessions with music producer and sound engineer Rae DiLeo. However, after a month of sessions with just himself and DiLeo&#x27;s guidance, Patrick decided not to do the entire album himself, and decided to seek out musicians, specifically, the &quot;Short Bus&quot; touring band.

As several years had passed since members had left, this led to difficulties as well. Walker was unable to return, as he had become the replacement touring drummer for the Smashing Pumpkins to replace drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Lenardo initially was unable to return, as he had gotten married and had children and was living a life that was contrary to Patrick&#x27;s requirements for him in the studio. However, after working through it, Patrick became more accommodating to his lifestyle, and Lenardo returned in a desire to provide for his family. Cavanaugh had been touring with Prong, but was able to return, and the band recruited new drummer Steven Gillis to replace Walker.

==Writing and recording==
With a working band back together, the album&#x27;s final sessions began. Some tracks, such as &quot;Take a Picture&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Fold&quot;, would still be written entirely by Patrick, while others would entail Lenardo coming up with a rough idea, and Patrick polishing it into its final form. The exception was &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Kill Me&quot;, where Patrick conceded that Lenardo wrote the entirety of the music of the track. Cavanaugh did not contribute to the writing process other than creating the bass line to the track &quot;Cancer&quot;, otherwise just playing as directed by others. Gillis oftentimes had to re-record his drum tracks multiple times due to Lenardo altering the guitar parts of the songs. The band continued to work with Dileo on the album, but also brought in music producer Ben Grosse to assist with the album&#x27;s production and mixing. Other collaborators included D&#x27;Arcy Wretzky, former bassist of the Smashing Pumpkins, who provided vocals for the chorus of the track &quot;Cancer&quot;. Eric Remschneider, who had also contributed to the Smashing Pumpkin&#x27;s song &quot;Disarm&quot; was also brought in to play cello on the opening track &quot;Sand&quot;, lead single &quot;Take a Picture&quot; and closing track &quot;Miss Blue&quot;.

Described as being &quot;firmly within the industrial-metal tradition&quot;, the record expands on the grunge-influenced industrial rock sound of &quot;Short Bus&quot; with electronic textures and elements from folk, worldbeat and psychedelia.

==Release and promotion==
The album was released on August 24, 1999, and debuted on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; chart at no. 30. In support of it, the band performed on Family Values Tour 1999. By October 2001, the album had amassed over 800,000 sold, and was eventually certified platinum, indicating over one million units shipped. On August 9, 2019, the band released a 20th Anniversary reissue of the album via Craft Recordings, which compiled a number of b-sides and remixes that had been released separately around the time of the album&#x27;s release.

==Reception==
The album was commercially and critically well received. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album for its &quot;subtle differences in tension and dynamics that keep it fresh and engaging throughout&quot;, albeit &quot;a little out of place within the modern rock world of 1999&quot; (due to the prominence of nu metal) and ultimately &quot;a strong album&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Steven Mirkin regarded the record as &quot;derivative&quot;, while noting the band&#x27;s &quot;attention to melody and craft&quot; to be refreshing. Greg Kot of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; thought that the album &quot;rehashes the Jekyll and Hyde dynamics that have become alternative rock&#x27;s creative downfall.&quot; Nevertheless, Kot further stated: &quot;With &quot;Short Bus&quot;, Filter sounded like the latest and lightest in a long line of industrial-rock bands, but &quot;Title of Record&quot; expands the possibilities.&quot;

The album sold more than 1 million copies, and the hit single &quot;Take a Picture&quot; fared well on several charts. In 2005, &quot;Title of Record&quot; was ranked number 493 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

The album was featured as number 8 on &quot;Loudwire&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;15 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1999&quot;.

<doc id="874536" wikidata="Q535258" url="?curid=874536" title="Nilo Cruz">
<text>Nilo Cruz is a Cuban-American playwright and pedagogue. With his award of the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his play &quot;Anna in the Tropics&quot;, he became the second Latino so honored, after Nicholas Dante.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Cruz was born in 1960 to Tina and Nilo Cruz, Sr. in Matanzas, Cuba. The family immigrated to Little Havana in Miami, Florida, in 1970 on a Freedom Flight, and eventually naturalised to the United States. His interest in theater began with acting and directing in the early 1980s. He studied theater first at Miami-Dade Community College, later moving to New York City, where Cruz studied under fellow Cuban María Irene Fornés. Fornes recommended Cruz to Paula Vogel who was teaching at Brown University where he would later receive his M.F.A. in 1994.

===Career===
In 2001, Cruz served as the playwright-in-residence for the New Theatre in Coral Gables, Florida, where he wrote &quot;Anna in the Tropics&quot;. Rafael de Acha, artistic director of the New Theatre, produced and directed the world premiere performance of &quot;Anna in the Tropics,&quot; which won the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the Steinberg Award for Best New Play.

After the play was awarded the Pulitzer and Steinberg awards, Emily Mann directed a production at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey, and the play then had its Broadway premiere with Jimmy Smits in the lead role.

Some of the theatres that have developed and performed Cruz’s works include New York&#x27;s Public Theater, New York Theatre Workshop, Pasadena Playhouse, McCarter Theatre, Oregon Shakespeare Festival, South Coast Repertory, The Alliance, New Theatre, Florida Stage, and the Coconut Grove Playhouse.

Cruz wrote the book of the Frank Wildhorn-Jack Murphy musical &quot;Havana&quot;. Its scheduled world premiere at the Pasadena Playhouse has been delayed by the theatre&#x27;s declaration of bankruptcy in 2010.

Cruz has translated plays into both Spanish and English. His adaptation and translation of &quot;La vida es sueño&quot; (&quot;Life Is a Dream&quot;) in English premiered at South Coast Repertory in 2007. He translated the script for &quot;Hamlet, Prince of Cuba&quot; at Asolo Repertory Theatre into Spanish for the 2012 production that ran simultaneously in English and Spanish on alternating nights.

Cruz has been the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships, including two NEA/TCG National Theatre Artist Residency grants, a Rockefeller Foundation grant, San Francisco&#x27;s W. Alton Jones award, a Kennedy Center Fund for New American Plays award, and a USA Artist Fellowship.

Cruz is a frequent collaborator with Peruvian-American composer Gabriela Lena Frank. To date, they have completed a set of orchestral songs, &quot;La centinela y la paloma&quot; (&quot;The Keeper and the Dove&quot;), for soprano Dawn Upshaw and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra (premiered under the baton of Joana Carneiro in February 2011); &quot;The Saint Maker&quot; for soprano Jessica Rivera, mezzo-soprano Rachel Calloway, the San Francisco Girls Chorus, and the Berkeley Symphony in May 2013; &quot;Journey of the Shadow&quot; for narrator and ensemble of eleven players (San Francisco Chamber Orchestra premiering in April 2013); the &quot;Conquest Requiem&quot; for soprano, baritone, orchestra, and chorus for the Houston Symphony under the baton of Andrés Orozco-Estrada in May 2017 which will be recorded by the Nashville Symphony in November 2022 for the Naxos label; and &quot;Cinco Lunas de Lorca&quot; (&quot;The Five Moons of Lorca&quot;) as a digital short for countertenor, choir, and piano for the Los Angeles Opera. Their newest project is &quot;El último sueño de Frida y Diego&quot; (&quot;The Last Dream of Frida and Diego)&quot;, a two-act opera commissioned by San Diego Opera and San Francisco Opera with a premiere in October 2022.

Cruz penned the libretto to composer Jimmy López&#x27;s opera &quot;Bel Canto&quot; which had its world premiere at the Lyric Opera of Chicago on December 7, 2015.

Cruz&#x27;s most recent work is &quot;Bathing in Moonlight&quot;, a world premiere featuring Raul Mendez, Priscilla Lopez, Hannia Guillen, Frankie J. Alvarez, Michael Rudko, and Katty Velasquez. Directed by Emily Mann, &quot;Bathing in Moonlight&quot; ran September 9 - October 9, 2016, at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey. &quot;Bathing in Moonlight&quot; is the recipient of an Edgerton Foundation New Play Award and a 2016 Greenfield Prize.

Cruz is an alumnus of New Dramatists and has taught playwriting at Brown University, the University of Iowa, and Yale University. He currently lives in New York City and Miami.

<doc id="874539" wikidata="Q147289" url="?curid=874539" title="Hellebore">
<text>Commonly known as hellebores (), the Eurasian genus Helleborus consists of approximately 20 species of herbaceous or evergreen perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, within which it gave its name to the tribe of Helleboreae. Many hellebore species are poisonous.

Despite common names such as &quot;winter rose&quot;, &quot;Christmas rose&quot;, and &quot;Lenten rose&quot;, hellebores are not closely related to the rose family (Rosaceae).

== Etymology ==

The common name &quot;hellebore&quot; is first attested in 1300s; it originates, via Old French and Latin, ultimately from . Although traditionally translated as &quot;plant eaten by fawns&quot;, this could be folk etymology and, according to Beekes, really a Pre-Greek word. It is &quot;not&quot; related to the word &quot;hell&quot;, despite botanical associations with poison, madness, etc.

In Anglo-Saxon England, the Anglo-Latin word &quot;elleborus&quot; had varied meanings. Around 900 AD, it was linked with &quot;&quot;tunsingwyrt&quot; (various spellings; likely an allium such as wild garlic) in the Old English Herbarium. Ælfric of Eynsham seemed to assert that &quot;elleborus&quot; had no vernacular Old English translation; by the early 11th century, &quot;wodewistle&quot;&quot; was used to gloss the word, possibly referring to hemlock or similar. These shifts reflect the developing understanding of Latin plant names in Old English texts.

== Description ==
The flowers have five petal-like sepals surrounding a ring of small, cup-like nectaries which are actually petals modified to hold nectar. The sepals do not fall as petals would, but remain on the plant, sometimes for many months. The persistence of the sepals may contribute to the development of the seeds.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus was established by Carl Linnaeus in volume one of his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753.

The scientific name &quot;Helleborus&quot; could derive from the Ancient Greek word (), the common name for &quot;H. orientalis&quot;, constructed from (, &quot;to injure&quot;) and (), &quot;food.&quot;. It is also possibly from Greek, ἄλκη “fawn”, βιβρώσκω (bibrṓskō, “to eat”).

=== Species and subspecies ===
Twenty-two species are recognised and divided into six sections.
The table below shows the species of the genus &quot;Helleborus&quot;, give its common name, the area of distribution, an image if available and the meaning of the scientific name. The cladogram shows the relationship between the different species determined with microbiological methods by Meiners et al. (2011).

====Caulescent species====
These four species have leaves on their flowering stems (in &quot;H. vesicarius&quot; the stems die back each year; it also has basal leaves).

* &quot;Helleborus argutifolius&quot; – Corsican hellebore
* &quot;Helleborus foetidus&quot; – stinking hellebore or setterwort
* &quot;Helleborus lividus&quot;
* &quot;Helleborus vesicarius&quot;

====Acaulescent (stemless) species====
These species have basal leaves. They have no true leaves on their flower stalks (although there are leafy bracts where the flower stalks branch).

* &quot;Helleborus atrorubens&quot;
* &quot;Helleborus croaticus&quot;
* &quot;Helleborus cyclophyllus&quot;

** &quot;Helleborus odorus&quot; subsp. &quot;laxus&quot;
** &quot;Helleborus odorus&quot; subsp. &quot;odorus&quot;
* &quot;Helleborus orientalis&quot; – Lenten rose, Lenten hellebore, oriental hellebore (N.B. most of the Lenten hellebores in gardens are now considered to be &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;hybridus&quot;)
** &quot;Helleborus orientalis&quot; subsp. &quot;abchasicus&quot; (syn. &quot;H. abchasicus&quot;)
** &quot;Helleborus orientalis&quot; subsp. &quot;guttatus&quot;
** &quot;Helleborus orientalis&quot; subsp. &quot;orientalis&quot; (syn. &quot;H. caucasicus, H. kochii&quot;)
* &quot;Helleborus purpurascens&quot;
* &quot;Helleborus thibetanus &quot;(syn&quot;. H. chinensis&quot;)
* &quot;Helleborus torquatus&quot;
* &quot;Helleborus viridis&quot; - green hellebore or bear&#x27;s-foot
* &quot;Helleborus occidentalis&quot; (formerly &quot;H. viridis&quot; subsp. &quot;occidentalis&quot;)

Other species names (now considered invalid) may be encountered in older literature, including &quot;H. hyemalis&quot;, &quot;H. polychromus&quot;, &quot;H. ranunculinus&quot;, &quot;H. trifolius&quot;.

====Hellebore hybrids====

Hybridising (deliberate and accidental) between &quot;H. orientalis&quot; and several other closely related species and subspecies has vastly improved the colour-range of the flowers, which now extends from slate grey, near-black, deep purple and plum, through rich red and pinks to yellow, white and green. The outer surface of the sepals is often green-tinged, and as the flower ages it usually becomes greener inside and out; individual flowers often remain on the plant for a month or more. The inner surface of each sepal may be marked with veins, or dotted or blotched with pink, red or purple. &quot;Picotee&quot; flowers, whose pale-coloured sepals have narrow margins of a darker colour, are much sought-after, as are those with dark nectaries which contrast with the outer sepals.

Recent breeding programmes have also created double-flowered and anemone-centred plants. Ironically, doing this is actually reversing the evolutionary process in which hellebores&#x27; true petals had been modified into nectaries; it is usually these nectaries which become the extra petals in double, semi-double and anemone-centred flowers. Double-flowered hellebores provide a very interesting variation to the standard hellebore. They are generally easy to maintain and share the same planting conditions as the standard hellebore.

Semi-double flowers have one or two extra rows of petals; doubles have more. Their inner petals are generally very like the outer ones in colour and patterning. They are often of a similar length and shape, though they may be slightly shorter and narrower, and some are attractively waved or ruffled. By contrast, anemone-centred flowers have, cupped within the five normal outer petals, a ring of much shorter, more curved extra petals (sometimes trumpet-shaped, intermediate in appearance between petals and nectaries), which may be a different colour from the outer petals. These short, extra petals (sometimes known as &quot;petaloids&quot;) drop off after the flower has been pollinated, leaving an apparently single flower, whereas doubles and semi-doubles tend to retain their extra petals after pollination.

====Interspecific hybrids====
Gardeners and nurserymen have also created hybrids between less closely related species. The earliest was probably &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;nigercors&quot;, a cross between &quot;H.  niger&quot; and &quot;H. argutifolius&quot; (formerly &quot;H. lividus&quot; subsp. &quot;corsicus&quot; or &quot;H. corsicus&quot;, hence the name) first made in 1931. &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;sternii&quot;, a cross between &quot;H. argutifolius&quot; and &quot;H. lividus&quot;, first exhibited in 1947, is named after the celebrated British plantsman Sir Frederick Stern. &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;ballardiae&quot; (&quot;H. niger&quot; crossed with &quot;H. lividus&quot;) and &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;ericsmithii&quot; (&quot;H. niger&quot; crossed with &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;sternii&quot;) similarly commemorate the noted British nursery owners Helen Ballard and Eric Smith. In recent years, Ashwood Nurseries (of Kingswinford in the English Midlands), already well known for its Ashwood Garden Hybrids (&quot;H.&quot; × &quot;hybridus&quot; singles, semi-doubles, doubles and anemone-centres), has created hybrids between &quot;H. niger&quot; and &quot;H. thibetanus&quot; (called &quot;H.&quot; &#x27;Pink Ice&#x27;), and between &quot;H. niger&quot; and &quot;H. vesicarius&quot; (called &quot;H.&quot; &#x27;Briar Rose&#x27;). The gardenworthiness of these hybrids has still to be proven.

The following hellebore species and cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:

* &quot;H. argutifolius&quot;
* &quot;H. foetidus&quot;
* &quot;H. lividus&quot;
* &quot;H. niger&quot;
* &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;sternii&quot; &#x27;Blackthorn Group&#x27;

==Distribution==

Various species of this genus originated in Europe and Asia. The greatest concentration of species occurs in the Balkans. One atypical species (&quot;H. thibetanus&quot;) comes from western China; another atypical species (&quot;H. vesicarius&quot;) inhabits a small area on the border between Turkey and Syria.

==Pests and diseases==
===Insects===
====&quot;Phytomyza hellebori&quot;====
More commonly known as the Hellebore leaf miner, &quot;Phytomyza hellebori&quot; is a small fly that infests only the &quot;H. foetidus&quot; plants in the Hellebore genus. The leaf miner fly digs tunnels into the leaves of the &quot;H. foetidus.&quot; The tunnels create brownish-black blotches on the plant. These later turn into a nesting ground where the flies lay their eggs. With time, the leaves turn a brownish-white along where the tunnels were dug. The larvae start to eat the inside of the leaves in August, and damage develops from the late summer to the early spring, with heavy attacks leaving the foliage disfigured by spring.

To control heavy infestations, the leaves can be removed and destroyed during the winter months before the adult flies emerge. Insecticides can be used with limited effectiveness in controlling larvae and fly populations in the plant. Insecticides may harm non-leaf miner flies if applied during the hellebore&#x27;s flowering period.

====&quot;Macrosiphum hellebori&quot;====
&quot;Macrosiphum hellebori&quot;, commonly known as &#x27;Hellebore aphid&#x27; or &#x27;greenfly&#x27;, is a sap-feeding aphid that infests the flowers and foliage of hellebore plants. The whitish-green aphids are about long and form dense colonies on hellebores, coating them with a honeydew that can lead to the growth of sooty mold on the leaves and flowers of the hellebore. This species of aphid only affects hellebores and is most active in March and April when the hellebores are flowering and when few aphid predators are around, though they may infest during any time of the year.

Aphids start their feeding from the outside the flowers, beginning at the leaves and then moving towards the flower petals of the hellebore. As the hellebore begins to open, the aphids try to move into the flower. The aphids then feed on the inner parts of the plant as well as the young stems and shoots. As the population grows, the aphids eventually eat the remaining parts of the plant, such as older leaves, for food.

Aphid infestations can be controlled through persistent squashing of the aphids manually or by using insecticides. It is not recommended to spray flowering hellebores as it may harm the non-aphid pollinating insects.

===Diseases===
==== &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; ====
&quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; or grey mold is a fungal disease that infects most ornamental plants. The fungus causes a decay of plant tissues and grows fuzzy gray-brown mold over the decaying areas, such as the buds, leaves, and flowers. Parts of the plant may shrivel and die after exposure to the mold, particularly the flowers. Typically the fungus infects plants only through an open wound or when the plant is under stress, but it has also been known to infect plants in humid conditions. If the humidity is low, the mold may be contained to discrete spots on the plant, but the mold has been known to spread rapidly in highly humid conditions. Grey mold is not seasonally dependent and can infect a plant at any time of the year. The fungus forms black seed-like structures in the dead plant tissue to create its spores to help it survive when new host plants are scarce. The spores are spread through the air to new plants.

To treat the infected plant, the first step is to remove infected and dying leaves, buds, and flowers immediately along with any other dead plant materials around the hellebore. The next step is to reduce the humidity around the plant by improving the ventilation and ensuring the plants are not overcrowded.

==== &quot;Coniothyrium hellebori&quot; ====
&quot;Coniothyrium hellebori&quot; is a fungus that causes the most common fungal disease for helleborus species known as Hellebore black spot or leaf spot. The disease is most common not only in botanical and ornamental gardens but also in hellebore nurseries as well. Visible symptoms include blackish-brown spots that often appear as rings on the leaf blade or at the margins of the leaf. The spots continue to grow larger as the disease progresses, retaining an elliptical or circular shape and turning a dark brown or black color. The spots grow until they infect the whole leaf. Petioles and flowers can also be infected, but the disease is primarily seen in the leaves. The symptoms become visible in the spring and worsen with time.

The small black fruiting bodies which carry the spores, pycnidia, are formed in the dead cells of the leaf spots. The spores are mainly spread by water, wind, and wind-blown rain. The fungus has an ideal habitat to spread and grow at the final growth site for hellebore plants, and if left untreated, the spores remain for many years. The most effective method against &quot;C. hellebori&quot; is to remove and destroy the infected leaves immediately to avoid reinfection the following spring.

==== Helleborus net necrosis virus ====
Helleborus net necrosis virus (HeNNV), also known as Hellebore black death, is an RNA virus that can cause serious disease in Hellebore plants by stunting or deforming the plant as it grows. The disease marks the leaves of the hellebores with black streaks, often following the veins of the leaf, and creating ring patterns. It can also mark the sepals and flowers with black spots or streaks but does not always do so. When symptoms are severe, new leaves have limited growth before dying off. The most seriously affected in the UK is &quot;H. orientalis&quot;, but all hellebores are susceptible to the disease. The most effective method of treatment against black death is to dig up and destroy all infected plants immediately. Many viruses are not transmitted through seeds, so it is possible to raise new disease resistant plants this way.

==== &quot;Pseudomonas viridiflava&quot; ====
&quot;Pseudomonas viridiflava&quot; is a bacterium that has been claimed to cause disease in hellebores in New Zealand, among other plants. The bacterial disease manifested on hellebore plants in the form of black leaf spots, necrosis petal, and stem lesions. The most popular ornamental and commercial crop grown in New Zealand is &quot;H. orientalis&quot; and its hybrids, of which 90 percent of the &quot;H. orientalis&quot; in the Tauranga nursery contracted the disease after several days of moderate rainfall. The disease caused discoloration in the form of black leaf spots that were circular and about 1.5–2 mm in diameter, black stem lesions, and dry, grey to brown lesions with distinct margins on the flower petals. The symptoms were different from other leaf-spotting hellebore diseases, such as those caused by the fungus &quot;Coniothyrium&quot; and the bacteria &quot;Xanthomonas&quot; The case in New Zealand is the only reported case of &quot;P. viridiflava&quot; infecting hellebores so far, but in other plants &quot;P. viridiflava&quot; has been reported to also induce symptoms such as leaf rot, leaf blotch, stem necrosis and blossom blight.

==Horticulture==

Hellebores are widely grown in United States Department of Agriculture hardiness zones 5a to 8b gardens for decorative purposes. They are particularly valued by gardeners for their winter and early spring flowering period; the plants are surprisingly frost-resistant and many are evergreen. Also of value is their shade tolerance. Many species of hellebore have green or greenish-purple flowers and are of limited garden value, although Corsican hellebore (&quot;H. argutifolius&quot;), a robust plant with pale green, cup-shaped flowers and attractive leathery foliage, is widely grown. So is the &#x27;stinking hellebore&#x27; or setterwort (&quot;H. foetidus&quot;), which has drooping clusters of small, pale green, bell-shaped flowers, often edged with maroon, which contrasts with its dark evergreen foliage. &quot;H. foetidus&quot; &#x27;Wester Flisk&#x27;, with red-flushed flowers and flower stalks, is becoming popular, as are more recent selections with golden-yellow foliage.

The so-called Christmas rose (&quot;H. niger&quot;), a traditional cottage garden favourite, bears its pure white flowers (which often age to pink) in the depths of winter; large-flowered cultivars are available, as are pink-flowered and double-flowered selections.

The most popular hellebores for garden use are &quot;H. orientalis&quot; and its colourful hybrids, &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;hybridus&quot; (Lenten rose). In the northern hemisphere, they flower in early spring, around the period of Lent, and are often known as Lenten hellebores, oriental hellebores, or Lenten roses. They are excellent for bringing early colour to shady herbaceous borders and areas between deciduous shrubs and under trees.

The cultivar =&#x27;Walhero&#x27; (sometimes listed under &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;hybridus&quot;) has won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

== Toxicity ==

All helleborus plants are toxic, and all parts of the helleborus plant are toxic. Hellebore poisoning is rare, but it does occur.
Hellebore plants are usually left alone by animals such as deer and rabbits because the leaves of the plant produce poisonous alkaloids, making them distasteful to animals. The poisonous alkaloids have been known to sometimes bother gardeners with sensitive skin. It was used in the First Sacred War at the start of the sixth century BC to poison the water supply of the city of Kirrha.

Poisonings occur through ingestion or handling. Hellebore plants should not be ingested as poisoning cases are most severe when the plants are eaten. This is especially true when hellebores are eaten in large quantities. Symptoms of ingestion include: burning of the mouth and throat, salivation, vomiting, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, nervous symptoms, and possibly depression. Consuming large quantities of hellebore plants can be fatal. Toxic cardiac glycosides occur in the roots. High levels of ranunculin and protoanemonin, especially in the leaves and sap, also contribute to symptoms after ingestion.

Dermatitis may also occur from handling the hellebore plants without protection. This is typically caused by the ranunculin and protoanemonin found on the outside of the plant, including the leaves, stem, flower, and sap. The poison on the outside of the plant causes irritation and burning sensations on the skin. When collecting seeds from hellebore plants, it is recommended to wait for the pods to dry and shake them out into a container or onto the ground to collect. Attempts to remove the seeds by hand exposes skin to the potent toxins in the sap of the hellebore, which can increase the damage done to the skin. Small or minimal exposure to the toxins should only cause a mild irritation to the skin, and the affliction should only last for a few minutes. If the burning persists or intensifies, it is recommended to wash the affected areas thoroughly to remove the toxins and see a doctor.

The species historically known as &quot;Black hellebore&quot; cause tinnitus, vertigo, stupor, thirst, anaphylaxis, emesis (vomiting), catharsis, bradycardia (slowing of the heart rate), and finally, collapse and death from cardiac arrest. Although &quot;Helleborus niger&quot; (black hellebore) contains protoanemonin or ranunculin, which has an acrid taste and can cause burning of the eyes, mouth, and throat, oral ulceration, gastroenteritis, and hematemesis, research in the 1970s showed that the roots of &quot;H. niger&quot; do not contain the cardiotoxic compounds helleborin, hellebrin, and helleborein that are responsible for the lethal reputation of &quot;black hellebore&quot;. It seems that earlier studies may have used a commercial preparation containing a mixture of material from other species such as &quot;Helleborus viridis&quot;, green hellebore.

== Uses ==
In the early days of medicine, two kinds of hellebore were recognized: black hellebore, which included various species of &quot;Helleborus&quot;, and white hellebore, now known as &quot;Veratrum album&quot;, which belongs to a different plant family, the Melanthiaceae. Although the latter plant is highly toxic, containing veratrine and the teratogens cyclopamine (which can cause the fatal birth defect of cyclopia) and jervine, it is believed to be the &quot;hellebore&quot; used by Hippocrates as a purgative.

Despite its toxicity, &quot;black hellebore&quot; was used by the Greeks and Romans to treat paralysis, gout and other diseases, more particularly insanity.

==Culture==
&quot;H. niger&quot; is commonly called the Christmas rose, due to an old legend that it sprouted in the snow from the tears of a young girl who had no gift to give the Christ Child in Bethlehem.

In Greek mythology, Melampus of Pylos used hellebore to save the daughters of the king of Argos from a madness, induced by Dionysus, that caused them to run naked through the city, crying, weeping, and screaming. 

During the Siege of Kirrha in 585 BC, hellebore was reportedly used by the Greek besiegers to poison the city&#x27;s water supply. The defenders were subsequently so weakened by diarrhea that they were unable to defend the city from assault.

In a fit of madness induced by Hera, Heracles killed his children by Megara. His madness was cured using hellebore.

<doc id="874551" wikidata="Q3113277" url="?curid=874551" title="Stehekin, Washington">
<text>Stehekin is a small unincorporated community in Chelan County, Washington. The name &quot;Stehekin&quot; comes from a word in the Salishan language that means &quot;the way through&quot;. Stehekin has somewhat more than 100 permanent residents, but vacationers and seasonal workers increase its population during the summer.

Stehekin is part of Wenatchee–East Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area. Located at the northwest end of Lake Chelan, the town lies just south of the North Cascades National Park. Stehekin is within the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, a unit administered by the National Park Service (NPS). The Glacier Peak Wilderness Area lies to the northwest of Stehekin.

== History ==
The upper end of Lake Chelan was part of a major east-west corridor for Native Americans for at least 9,000 years connecting communities on either side of the Cascade Range. In the 1800s, Native Americans in the Lake Chelan and Upper Skagit Valley referred to the pass between them as Stehekin meaning &quot;the way through&quot;. Natives would store canoes at the head of the lake. White settlement began around 1875 when prospectors began searching for minerals in and around the Stehekin Valley. Mining activity increased in the 1880s with significant ore discoveries through 1891. A small gold rush occurred in the area.

Difficulty in accessing the community created problems for miners attempting to get their product to markets. Numerous proposals for wagon roads, railroads, and later vehicle highways were created in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, but none were brought to fruition and the village remains disconnected from the North American road and railroad networks. A road was built connecting the original dock on the south side of the Stehekin River to mining areas up the valley in the 1890s. This route was abandoned within a few years when a new dock was built on the north side of the river.

William Buzzard homesteaded and cleared a area and planted a small garden in 1889. This was sold in 1911 to the Buckner family, who developed it into a small farm and orchard that they operated into the 1940s. A post office was established in Stehekin in 1892.

The Stehekin Valley Road was included in Washington&#x27;s inventory of state highways during the first half of the 20th century before passing into the hands of Chelan County and later the federal government. The last extension of the road was in 1949, from which point mining interest stopped proposing extensions due to the high cost of construction and maintenance. Sections were abandoned after flood damage in 1995 and 2003.

Stehekin has experienced several forest fires that have endangered the town, including in 1993, 2006, and 2015. An evacuation order urging Stehekin residents to leave was issued in late July 2024 during the Pioneer Fire. A week after the withdrawal behest, most residents remained though a Red Cross shelter was established in Chelan. Firefighters prepared the town in advance of the encroaching flames, wrapping fire-resistant protective foil around several buildings, including the NPS cabin and several historical buildings. In case of a catastrophic necessity, the fire crews also built a floating dock on the lake to assist in a last-minute evacuation. Stehekin reopened in late August after the evacuation order was withdrawn. There were no reported injuries nor loss of any building in the community.

==Tourism==
Stehekin is visited by hikers and bikers in the summer, and snowshoers and skiers in the winter, as well as photographers year-round. Sights and attractions in Stehekin include the Buckner Homestead Historic District, The Golden West Visitor Center, the Stehekin Pastry Company, the one-room Stehekin School, the 312&#x27; Rainbow Falls, Harlequin Bridge, and the CCC-constructed National Park Service cabin at High Bridge. Trout and sockeye salmon are popular targets for fishing in Stehekin.

==Transportation==

There is no road access to Stehekin, although roughly of road exist in the Stehekin Valley. The town is accessible by passenger ferries operated by the Lake Chelan Boat Company, by private boat from Chelan, by foot over Cascade Pass, by floatplane, or by small aircraft that land on a turf airstrip open from June through September. Vehicles in Stehekin are barged up Lake Chelan. The Stehekin State Airport is noted by the Washington State Department of Transportation as being one of the state&#x27;s most challenging. While only in elevation, there are mountains on the sides and trees at each end of the runway. The airport is often used as a base for firefighting, at which times it is closed to the public. 

In addition to these means of access, visitors come to Stehekin by horseback and hiking. In 2003, much of the upper (northern) half of the Stehekin Valley Road was washed out by the nearby Stehekin River. Thus, access via Cascade Pass has become more difficult, adding as much as to the already strenuous trek. Stehekin is also accessible from Washington Pass via the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). As well, the PCT can be used to access Stehekin from the Suiattle River Valley, although the hike is longer than that from Washington Pass.

A network of trails through the mountains east of Stehekin provide access by foot from the Methow Valley area. The Chelan Summit trail starts near the nexus of Grade Creek Road northwest of Chelan and provides a continuous trail all the way into Stehekin. The Lake Shore Trail, which leads into Stehekin from Prince Creek. The &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; ferry services this trail head.

==Climate==
Stehekin has a dry-summer continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dsb&quot;) with warm to hot summers and heavy winter snowfall. The precipitation pattern closely resembles a Mediterranean climate and using the lower isotherm for the coldest month, Stehekin may be described as a highly unusual mediterranean climate. Winter temperatures are much colder than those encountered on the windward side of the Cascades, but are still moderate compared to areas further east. The overall temperature span has ranged from in summer to in winter. The coldest daily maximum measured was in December 1968. During the series of normals spanning from 1991 to 2020 the coldest annual maximum averaged a lot closer to the normals with . Summer nights can occasionally be very warm, with a record of from July 1907, as well as a reading 
of measured in 2015. In a normal year, the warmest low is .

==Telephone service==
Between March 15 and 28 of 2007, WeavTel, a telecommunications company based in Chelan, at the southern end of the lake, began normal operations of standard-delivery residential and business telephone service, joining Stehekin to the Washington State telephone grid after decades of isolation. With no cell phone reception, Stehekin had previously only been served by highly expensive satellite and radio telephones. Although the move was not widely accepted amongst residents, business owners found benefit in having normal telephone service.

The WeavTel service is currently limited to the Lower Stehekin Valley, around Stehekin Landing and the village proper, but WeavTel has applied for permits to extend the service into the Upper Valley using underground fiber-optic cables. The move was made possible under federal and state grants that provided support for any telecommunications company willing to extend service to rural areas. Although most other areas of North Central Washington have standard service, areas outside the city of Wenatchee have benefited from the grants as well. One of the first test phone calls was placed from Stehekin&#x27;s Silver Bay Resort.

<text>The was an insider trading and corruption scandal that forced many prominent Japanese politicians to resign in 1988.

Recruit is a human resources and classifieds company based in Tokyo. Its chairman, Hiromasa Ezoe, offered a number of shares in a Recruit subsidiary, Cosmos, to business leaders and senior politicians shortly before Cosmos went public in 1986. Following the public offering, Cosmos&#x27;s share price skyrocketed, and the individuals involved in the scheme saw average profits of ¥66 million each.

Although only seventeen members of the Diet were involved in the insider trading, another thirty were later found to have received special favors from Recruit.

Among the politicians involved in the scandal were Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takao Fujinami. In addition to members of the LDP government, leaders of the Komeito, Democratic Party of Japan, and Japan Socialist Party were also found to be involved. As a result, Takeshita&#x27;s cabinet was forced to resign, although some of its members returned to political prominence later (including future prime ministers Kiichi Miyazawa and Keizō Obuchi).

The chairmen of NTT, the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;, and the &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; were also involved in the scandal.

Despite the breadth of the Recruit Scandal across party lines, the LDP was hurt most significantly by the scandal. It is often said to be one of the main causes of Morihiro Hosokawa&#x27;s opposition party victory in 1993, which briefly interrupted the LDP&#x27;s otherwise continuous reign over Japan.

<text>A general merchant store (also known as general merchandise store, general dealer, village shop, or country store) is a rural or small-town store that carries a general line of merchandise. It carries a broad selection of merchandise, sometimes in a small space, where people from the town and surrounding rural areas come to purchase all their general goods. The store carries routine stock and obtains special orders from warehouses. It differs from a convenience store or corner shop in that it will be the main shop for the community rather than a convenient supplement.

General stores often sell staple food items such as milk and bread, and various household goods such as hardware and electrical supplies. The concept of the general store is very old, and although some still exist, there are far fewer than there once were, due to urbanization, urban sprawl, and the relatively recent phenomenon of big-box stores. The term &quot;general merchandise store&quot; is also used to describe a hybrid of a department store, with a wide selection of goods, and a discount store, with low prices. Examples include J. C. Penney and Sears.

==History==
General dealers were established in the 18th and 19th centuries in many remote populated places where mobility was limited and a single shop was sufficient to service the entire community. Due to its close connection and confinement to its customers, general dealers often adjusted their sales offerings to the specific preferences of their community.

General dealers existed, apart from mainland Europe and Asia, in all European colonies and generally in areas where colonists encroached upon communities that previously did not trade with money. In the colonies, trading or bartering in local produce had existed long before official shops were opened. The growing need for imported goods, both from European settlers and native populations, led to the establishment of a network of merchants, and subsequently to the creation of a money economy.

==By country==

===Australia===
While a large number of general stores still exist in Australia, as in other parts of the world their numbers were greatly reduced by the advent of supermarkets.

===Canada===
The oldest continually run general store in Canada is Trousdale&#x27;s, located in Sydenham, Ontario, which has been operated by the Trousdale family since 1836. Sociability has always been a feature, as locals come to chat as well as buy. Gray Creek Store in Gray Creek, Kootenay Bay, Canada is the largest and oldest general dealer in the Kootenay Lake region Enniskillen General Store in Clarington, Ontario has been in operation since 1840 and still continues today. Robinson&#x27;s General Store in Dorset, Ontario, voted &quot;Canada&#x27;s Best Country Store&quot;, has been owned and operated by the same family since 1921.

===Dominican Republic===
In the Dominican Republic, a colmado is the country&#x27;s equivalent of a general store. Colmado literal translation is &#x27;full to the brim&#x27; implying its great density of goods in a small space. The colmado is much more than just a general store, for it offers a social gathering point for the residents of the town or neighborhood. The colmado is an important institution in the Dominican Republic serving as an economic, social and political center for every small community. It is common for colmados to have loud Dominican music such as merengue, bachata, or salsa playing. A common pastime for Dominican men is to play dominoes and drink a beer at their local colmado on Sundays. Another particularity of the colmado is that they provide delivery service of their products directly to the customer&#x27;s dwelling. Products range from beer, snacks, toilet paper to flashlights and canned food.

===Egypt===
The Greek merchants in Egypt were called &quot;bakal&quot;.

===Finland===

General stores (&quot;sekatavarakauppa&quot;) first appeared in Finland in 1859 when fixed shop retailers were allowed to set up shops in rural towns for the first time. Prior to that, authorised trade in rural products other than those produced in the same region depended on city travel, open-air markets and fairs. A related type of store is the village store (&quot;kyläkauppa&quot;), typically located in sparsely populated towns, which still performs many similar functions to general stores. As in many other countries, their numbers were greatly reduced with the advent of supermarkets, from over 3400 such shops in 1980 to 241 in 2017.

===India===
In India, a tapri is a regional version of a general store. It stores all home, personal, medical, and hygienic daily-use products. Many Kirana shops sell products other than food, such as clothing or household items, stationery, toys, tools, and medicines. Small Kirana stores, which are generally located on the corner of streets and generally known as katta or tapri, sell cigarettes, tobacco, and tea.

Recently, there has been a notable integration of Aadhaar-enabled Payment System (AePS) services in Kirana or general stores across India. AePS allows customers to conduct basic banking transactions such as cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, and fund transfer using their Aadhaar number and biometric authentication. This integration has enabled Kirana stores to serve as financial service points, offering convenient banking services to local communities. 

On 30 July 2024, Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) introduced an interoperable QR code to link neighborhood store owners with consumers. With ONDC-registered buyer apps like Magicpin and Paytm, merchants can create a unique QR code that customers can scan to access their online store on the ONDC platform. 

===Namibia===
Due to its sparse population, there are still a number of general dealers in Namibia, for instance, the Solitaire General Dealer in Solitaire, an important stopover for tourists through Namibia&#x27;s Namib-Naukluft Park.

===Puerto Rico===
In Puerto Rico, a US territory, several general stores (&quot;colmado&quot;) have proliferated since the 1970s.

* Supermercados Selectos
* Supermercados Econo

===South Africa===
There are still many general dealers in South Africa; the oldest is Oom Samie se Winkel () in Dorp Street, Stellenbosch. Oepverkoop is the oldest general dealer in Paternoster, Western Cape. Goodwood Museum in Cape Town displays the operation of a general dealer shop.

===United Kingdom===
Village shops are becoming less common in the densely populated parts of the country, although they remain common in remote rural areas.

Their rarity in England is due to several factors, such as the rise in car ownership, competition from large chain supermarkets, the rising cost of village properties, and the increasing trend of the wealthy to own holiday homes in picturesque villages, consequently these houses which used to be occupied full-time by potential customers are often vacant for long periods.

Of those villages in England who still have shops, these days they are often a combination of services under one roof to increase the likelihood of profit and survival. Extra services may include a post office, private business services such as tearooms, cafes, and bed and breakfast accommodation; or state services such as libraries and General Practitioner (GP) or Dental clinics; and charity partners such as Women&#x27;s Institute (WI) coffee mornings held on the day most elderly villagers might collect their weekly pensions.

Community shops have become popular in some villages, often jointly owned and run by many villagers as a co-operative. The Village Retail Services Association promotes the role and function of the village shop in the UK. Many modern village shops choose to stock items which draw in customers from neighboring areas who are seeking locally sourced, organic and specialist produce such as local cuts of meat, local cheeses, wines etc.

Corner shops are usually so-called because they are located on the corner plot or street end of a row of terraced housing, often Victorian or Edwardian factory workers&#x27; houses. The doorway into the shop was usually on the corner of the plot to maximize shop floor space within, this also offered two display windows onto two opposing streets. Many have now altered the original shop front layout in favor of a mini-supermarket style. Although it is common that corner shops found in the UK were former grocers&#x27; shops, other specialist retailers also occupied such plots and have suffered the same fate of being largely replaced by supermarkets and hypermarkets, such retailers as greengrocers, bakers, butchers and fishmongers.

====In popular culture====
Many British television and radio series, especially soap operas, feature corner shops or village shops as cornerstones for community gatherings and happenings. A prominent example is the village shop in Ambridge, the fictional village in the BBC Radio 4 series, &quot;The Archers&quot;, (1950–present). The ITV1 soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (1960–present) has featured a corner shop since the first episode; originally owned by Florrie Lindley, it was later acquired by Alf Roberts the grocer, and after his death in the late-1990s was bought by Dev Alahan, reflecting this common change in British culture to Asian shopkeepers. The dying days and changing culture of the traditional British grocer were explored to great effect in the BBC TV comedy series &quot;Open All Hours&quot; (1976–1985), set in the real suburb of Balby in Doncaster; the shop front used for the street scenes in the series does actually exist in the area and is now a hairdressing salon. The BBC Scotland comedy series &quot;Still Game&quot; has a corner shop as a recurring location where characters can meet and gossip; the actor who plays its owner, Navid Harrid (Sanjeev Kohli), plays a similar role as Bangaram in the Radio 4 comedy series &quot;Fags, Mags and Bags&quot; which is set entirely in Ramesh&#x27;s shop.

The band Cornershop in part base their image on the perception that many convenience shops are now owned by British Asian people. In terms of British popular culture, these media representations give some idea of the importance attached to local shops in the national psyche and as a mainstay of community life.

===United States===


General stores and itinerant peddlers dominated in rural America until the coming of the automobile after 1910. Farmers and ranchers depended on general stores that had a limited stock and slow turnover; they made enough profit to stay in operation by selling at high prices. Often farmers would barter butter, cheese, eggs, vegetables or other foods which the merchant would resell. Prices were not marked on each item; instead the customer negotiated a price. Men did most of the shopping, since the main criterion was credit rather than quality of goods. Indeed, most customers shopped on credit, paying later when crops or cattle were sold; the owner&#x27;s ability to judge credit worthiness was vital to his success. The store was often a gathering point for local men to chat, pass around the weekly newspaper, and talk politics.

In the South, the general store was especially important after the Civil War, as the merchant was one of the few sources of credit available until the cash crops (usually cotton or tobacco) came in. By 1878, for example, there were 1,468 local merchants in Alabama, or 12 for every 10,000 people. There were few towns and very few cities, so rural general stores and itinerant peddlers were the main sources of supply. 

During the first half of the 20th century, general stores were displaced in many areas of the United States by many different types of specialized retailers in trading towns and small cities. However, from the 1960s to the present, many small specialized retailers have in turn been crushed by the so-called &quot;category killers&quot;, which are &quot;big-box&quot; wholesale-type retailers large enough to carry the majority of best-selling goods in a specific category, like sporting goods or office supplies. Gray&#x27;s General Store of Adamsville, Rhode Island is reputed to be the oldest continually operating general store in the United States until its temporary closure in 2012. It subsequently reopened in the summer of 2013.

However, the convenience inherent in the general store has been revived in the form of the modern convenience store. A few variety stores draw upon the concept of having a broad variety of goods servicing small communities where big-box retailers are absent; Dollar General stores, in particular, draws its name from both the &quot;dollar store&quot; concept of having items at a fixed price point and the general store.

<doc id="874565" wikidata="Q5308887" url="?curid=874565" title="Drug czar">
<text>Drug czar is an informal name for the person who directs drug-control policies in various areas. The term follows the informal use of the term &quot;czar&quot; in U.S. politics. The &#x27;drug czar&#x27; title first appeared in a 1982 news story by United Press International that reported that, &quot;[United States] Senators ... voted 62–34 to establish a &#x27;drug czar&#x27; who would have overall responsibility for U.S. drug policy.&quot; Since then, several &quot;ad hoc&quot; executive positions established in both the United States and United Kingdom have subsequently been referred to in this manner.

== Germany ==
The Drug Commissioner of the German Federal Government has been called the nation&#x27;s drug czar by the state media company Deutsche Welle.

== United States ==
The first US Drug czar was Harry J. Anslinger, who served as the first Commissioner of the Treasury Department&#x27;s &quot;Federal Bureau of Narcotics&quot; from 1930 to 1962, under the administrations of five presidents: Herbert Hoover, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy. Legislative efforts for marijuana prohibition under Anslinger included a push for all states to adopt similar drug laws, the Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act and the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, which in effect criminalized the drug and set the stage for marijuana prohibition.
