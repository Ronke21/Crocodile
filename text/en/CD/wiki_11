<text>James Jean (born 1979) is a Taiwanese-American visual artist working primarily in painting and drawing. He lives and works in Los Angeles, where he moved from New York in 2003.

==Early life==
Jean was born in Taiwan and raised in New Jersey. During his early education, he explored various forms of artistic expression, including the piano and trumpet. He attended the School of Visual Arts in New York City, from which he graduated in 2001.

==Early career==
In 2001, Jean became a cover artist for DC Comics and Marvel Comics, garnering seven Eisner awards, three consecutive Harvey awards, two gold medals and a silver from the Society of Illustrators of Los Angeles, and a gold medal from the Society of Illustrators of New York. He illustrated covers for the comic book series &quot;Fables&quot; and &quot;The Umbrella Academy&quot;, for which he has won six Eisner Awards for &quot;Best Cover Artist&quot;. Jean won the 2005 Wizard Fan Award for Favorite Cover Artist for &quot;Fables&quot;. In 2006, he won Best Artist from the World Fantasy Awards. 

He also worked in advertising, and has contributed to many national and international publications. His clients included &quot;Time Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, ESPN, Atlantic Records, Target, Linkin Park, &quot;Playboy&quot;, Knopf, Prada among others. He also did the album art for My Chemical Romance &#x27;s album &quot;The Black Parade&quot;, which was released in 2006.

==Present career==
In 2008, Jean retired from illustration projects in order to focus on painting. Combining abstract figuration with loose, gestural marks, Jean creates layered compositions that evoke personal or collective experiences. Dream-like and at times disorienting, his works are expressive of narratives unbounded in time or space, and draw upon art historical antecedents ranging from Baroque painting traditions to Japanese woodblock prints and Chinese silk scroll paintings.

===Sketchbooks===
Sketchbooks have sustained a vital space in Jean&#x27;s practice, solidifying importance in his time during art school as a rejection of the strict academic focus of visual arts studies. In favor of the freedom found in sketching during his childhood, Jean embraced sketchbooks as a means of exploring figures and imaginative creatures, synthesizing doodles, line drawings, and journalistic elements with more polished compositions in black-and-white and color. For Jean, sketchbooks are spaces for both experiment or study and for finished artworks in their own right.

==Notable works==

===Prada===
In 2007, Jean created a mural for the Prada Epicenter stores in New York and Los Angeles. He also created a backdrop for Prada&#x27;s Spring/Summer 2008 show in Milan.

Aspects of the Epicenter mural and the Milan wallpaper were transformed into clothing, handbags, shoes, and packaging. Prada undertook a global campaign that featured Jean&#x27;s work in advertising environments, animation, and special events.

In 2008, Jean again collaborated with Prada, developing an animated short based on the wallpapers, clothing, and accessories produced in 2007. He wrote, storyboarded, and did the visual development for the animation, which would be eventually titled &quot;Trembled Blossoms&quot;, taken from the poem &quot;Ode to Psyche”, by John Keats.

Jean reunited with Prada to create prints for its Resort 2018 collection. He described the visual effect as a &quot;tangle of floral elements occasionally populated and overrun by rabbits.&quot; Prada brought the collection to Shanghai as part of the brand&#x27;s unveiling of Rong Zhai, a 20th-century mansion it restored, and exclusive looks were debuted in vivid reds, yellows, and blues.

Jean&#x27;s images were used for the brand&#x27;s SS2018 Menswear collection. His work also served as the set design for the collection&#x27;s premiere at the Via Fogazzaro space. Jean&#x27;s collaboration with Prada brought images inspired by graphic novels to high-fashion pieces, blending the superhuman with the human, and with a nod to the thick black lines that divide illustration panels.

===Film artwork===
Jean created the poster art for three films in 2017: Darren Aronofsky’s &quot;mother!&quot;, Guillermo del Toro’s &quot;The Shape of Water&quot;, and Denis Villeneuve’s &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;. Employing different media for each artwork, he hand-painted two character posters for &quot;mother!&quot; (one for Jennifer Lawrence and another for Javier Bardem), made a charcoal drawing for &quot;The Shape of Water&quot;, and used digital drawing tools for &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;. As part of his creative process, Jean collaborated closely with both Darren Aronofsky and Guillermo del Toro. Del Toro, a long-time fan of Jean&#x27;s work, describes his drawings as having &quot;a delicate nature to them and beautiful line work that is at the same time realistic and sort of elevated into a style of his own.&quot; Jean later created poster art for Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert&#x27;s film &quot;Everything Everywhere All At Once.&quot; Jean&#x27;s posters uniquely evoke the tone and mood of each film without overtly revealing depictions of plot.

==Notable exhibitions==
Jean&#x27;s first solo exhibition was held in 2009 at Jonathan LeVine (then located in the Chelsea neighborhood in New York), followed in 2011 by &quot;Rebus,&quot; a solo presentation at Martha Otero Gallery (at the time located in the Fairfax district in Los Angeles).

In 2013, Jean&#x27;s work was the subject of &quot;Parallel Lives,&quot; a solo exhibition at Tilton Gallery in New York. Spanning both floors of the gallery, the show debuted a new body of work that fused personal with universal themes, and realism with mythology. Its title drawn from Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Noble Greens and Romans,&quot; also known as &quot;Parallel Lives,&quot; the exhibition of paired works explored the tension created from &quot;parallels.&quot;

Jean&#x27;s work was included in &quot;Juxtapoz x Superflat,&quot; organized by the Vancouver Art Gallery in 2016. Curated by artist Takashi Murakami and Juxtapoz editor Evan Pricco, the group exhibition brought together artists whose works had been included in the magazine and who had participated in or expanded upon Murakami&#x27;s postmodern art movement Superflat. Jean&#x27;s painting &quot;Bouquet&quot; served as the marquee image for the exhibition.

For &quot;Azimuth,&quot; a 2018 solo exhibition at Kaikai Kiki Gallery in Tokyo, Jean presented drawings, paintings, and an installation of illuminated stained glass works, which he made at Judson Studios. The show centered on the radiance of color and light, with works driven by a force of optimism and innocence, informed in part by the joy of the artist&#x27;s son.

===Lotte Museum of Art===
In 2019, Lotte Museum of Art in Seoul hosted &quot;Eternal Journey,&quot; a major retrospective of Jean&#x27;s work. Over 500 works were on view in the exhibition, including large-scale paintings, sculpture, installation, video art, 150 comic book covers, and more than 200 drawings that served as the inspiration for many of the included works. Nine large-scale paintings explored the theme of obangsaek, or the five fundamental or cardinal colors, a traditional color schema representative of the order of the universe.

Collaborating again with Judson Studios, the oldest family-operated stained-glass maker in the US, Jean created &quot;Gaia - Yellow Earth Center&quot; (2019), the centerpiece of the Lotte Museum of Art exhibition. The sculpture expands upon his earlier explorations into stained glass for &quot;Azimuth,&quot; bringing his visual vocabulary to the traditional medium. Over eight feet in height, the illuminated sculpture, which combines water jet cutting, hand and airbrush painting, and fused glass, depicts the goddess Gaia with a slinking tiger in an all-over composition of natural and geometric elements.

The exhibition was on view from April 4 through September 1, 2019 and is accompanied by an exhibition catalogue with essays by Yoon-Kyung Kwon, Chief Curator at Lotte Museum of Art; Hee-Kyung Song, Art Historian and Professor at Ewha Womans University; and Christopher James Alexander, Architecture, Art, and Design Consultant, Principal of CJA Creative Collaborations.

==NFTs==
On 4 March 2021, Jean sold his first NFT with his artwork &quot;Slingshot&quot;. It was auctioned on NFT platform Foundation and sold the next day for $469,696.35.

==Awards==
In 2008, Jean collaborated with AIDES, a France-based non-profit community organization dedicated to fighting HIV/AIDS, in their print advertising campaign around the theme “Explore, Just Protect Yourself.” Jean&#x27;s print campaign was awarded the Bronze Lion at the 2008 Cannes Advertising Festival.

<doc id="876322" wikidata="Q6052374" url="?curid=876322" title="International Peace Mission movement">
<text>The International Peace Mission movement is a religious movement that was founded and led by Father Divine. Father Divine was worshipped by his followers as a God. Thus, the core belief of the International Peace Mission Movement is that everyone is treated equal in the eyes of God. Father Divine preached against sexism and racism. He was most renowned during and following the Great Depression in the 1930s. Thus, the International Peace Mission movement is now known to be an important precursor of the Civil Rights Movement. The International Peace Mission movement emphasized its opposition to violence and war. Also the movement has a very strong focus on spiritual development through meditation and prayer. 

The International Peace Mission movement is built on the principles of Christianity, democracy, Americanism, brotherhood, and Judaism with understanding that all religions teach the same basic truths. Members of the movement are taught not to discriminate race, color, or religion. The movement first started in Brooklyn, New York and then in Sayville, New York. Moving forward in 1942, the headquarters were relocated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During World War II, Father Divine organized rallies and prayer for his peace movement to oppose war. Today, the International Peace Mission movement still focuses on promoting the message of equality, peace, and social justice.

==Teachings and beliefs==

The teachings of the movement are based on the following principles:
* Father Divine is God
* &quot;Heaven&quot; is a state of consciousness
* Unity of the world&#x27;s religions
* Celibacy, Marriage to God
* Children shall be raised by assigned guardians
* Use of the USA flag and the English language worldwide
* Prohibition of smoking, drinking of alcoholic beverages, obscenity and receiving of gifts
* Public education
* Abandoning racial barriers
* Communal ownership of property and donation of goods and services
* Gender segregation

==Organization and structure==

===Leadership===
The International Peace Mission Movement was led by Father Divine up to his death in 1965. Father Divine&#x27;s widow Mother Divine then succeeded her late husband and led the Movement until her death in 2017.

===Auxiliaries===
An auxiliary are specific groups of people who are willing to support and help the International Peace Mission Movement. There are three &quot;auxiliaries&quot; in the Peace Mission movement - the Rosebuds, for girls and young women, the Lily-buds for older, mature women and the Crusaders for males of all ages. Each auxiliary has specific duties, creeds and uniforms.

==Publications==
There were two publications of the International Peace Mission Movement: The &quot;Spoken Word&quot; (1934–1937) and the &quot;New Day&quot; (1936–1989). Both were available to members and the general public. These publications contained articles on issues of the day, as well as articles on world and local events.

==Rituals==

===Church services===
The services consist of singing Peace Mission hymns and songs from popular culture. The singing is followed by the playing of taped sermons by past or present leaders. Talks by visiting speakers, if present, follow. Readings of the King James Bible and/or a Peace Mission publication are conducted. Services conclude with member testimonials about the power of Father Divine.

===Holy Communion services===
The &quot;Holy Communion service&quot; is the signature ritual that symbolizes the Peace Mission. It symbolized the provision of food to those who could not afford it during the Great Depression. The origins of the &quot;holy banquet&quot; are in the communal home meals served to Father Divine&#x27;s followers before 1932. By the mid-1930s, these communal meals had become well-attended banquets, feeding thousands of people. Often, Father Divine would give impromptu speeches during the meal.

The Peace Mission viewed the banquets as the reinstatement of the &quot;Christian love feast&quot; mentioned in the New Testament and the Last Supper that Jesus Christ attended before his crucifixion.

===Divine Marriage anniversary celebration===
On April 29, 1946, interracial marriage of 70-year-old Father Divine to his 21-year-old Canadian-born secretary is called the &quot;Marriage of Christ to his Church&quot; and the &quot;fusion between heaven and Earth&quot; in Peace Mission theology. It is celebrated each year in April as an &quot;international, interracial, universal holiday&quot;, according to Peace Mission literature.

Every year since 1948, Peace Mission members gather at Father Divine&#x27;s home or at headquarters in order to celebrate a special Holy Communion service for the Divine marriage anniversary celebration.

===Communal shareholding===
Members of the Peace Mission were encouraged to pool their individual resources and invest in businesses, the profits of which were to be divided up and shared. During the 1930s, these properties and businesses were quite numerous. Peace Mission businesses included the Divine Lorraine and Divine Tracy Hotels in Philadelphia, farmlands in upstate New York and garages.

==History of the International Peace Mission movement==

===Beginnings===
George Baker Jr attended a local store front Baptist Church, often preaching and teaching in the church&#x27;s Sunday school, until 1907, when he became Samuel Morris&#x27;s (Father Jehovia), first follower. Thus, George Baker Jr known to be &quot;the Messenger&quot;. In 1912, Father Divine disagreed that Father Jehovia was God and anyone could be God. As result, Father Divine parted ways and declared himself a God. Father Divine traveled down South to Georgia to preach and got into conflicts with local ministers and was sentenced to 60 days on a chain gang. Upon his release, he attracted a following of mostly black women in Valdosta, Georgia. On February 6, 1914, several followers&#x27; husbands and local preachers had him arrested for lunacy and Divine was incarcerated in an insane asylum. Father Divine was later released and pronounced mentally sound in spite of his &quot;maniacal&quot; beliefs, and admonished to leave the state.

===1914–1932: The Proto-Peace Mission Movement===
In 1914, Father Divine traveled to Brooklyn, New York, with a moderate amount of followers and an all-black congregation. In 1919, he and his followers moved the commune to Sayville, New York on Long Island. Father Divine and his followers were the first black homeowners in town. In this period, his movement underwent sustained growth, as he ran the entire movement from his communal house. Father Divine held free weekly banquets and helped newcomers find jobs. He began attracting many white followers as well as black in the late 1920s. On May 8, 1931, Father Divine and his followers was arrested and charged with disturbing the peace that was brought by his neighbors.
===1930s: Peace Mission Movement Zenith===
Press coverage and notoriety increased dramatically for the Peace Mission after the arrest for disturbing the peace ended in first conviction, then the death of the presiding judge and Father Divine&#x27;s subsequent release. The impression that Justice Smith&#x27;s death was an act of divine retribution was perpetuated by the press, which failed to report Smith&#x27;s prior heart problems and implied the death to be more sudden and unexpected than it was. The New York based media frenzy following the death made this event and its repercussions the single most famous moment of Father Divine&#x27;s life. Articles on Father Divine propelled his popularity. By December, his followers began renting buildings in New York City for Father Divine to speak in. Soon, he often had several engagements on a single night.

In May 1932, Peace Mission meetings were regularly held at the Rockland and throughout New York and New Jersey. Father Divine had many supporters in throughout the world, more specifically Washington State and California. During this period of expansions, several Peace Mission branch communes were opened in New York and New Jersey. In this period of time, Father Divine&#x27;s followers finally named the movement: &quot;the International Peace Mission movement&quot;.

Father Divine moved to Harlem, New York, and accumulated a significant following in the black community. Furthermore, Father Divine established a headquarters in Harlem, New York. The members of the movement held most deeds but they contributed toward Father Divine&#x27;s comfortable lifestyle. As a result, purchasing several hotels, members could live and seek jobs inexpensively. Also, the Peace Mission movement opened several budget enterprises, such as restaurants and clothing shops.

===1930s: International expansion and alliance with the Communist Party USA===
In 1934, Peace Mission branches had opened in Los Angeles, California, and Seattle, Washington. The gatherings occurred in France, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia. Although, the membership totals were overstated in the press. Thus, Father Divine was called upon to offer political endorsements.

In early 1934, an alliance between Father Divine and the Communist Party USA began. The Peace Mission Movement practiced a form of communal socialism which profits from individual Peace Mission businesses were redistributed within the movement. Father Divine became impressed with the Communist Party&#x27;s commitment to civil rights and resulted in an alliance being formed.

In spite of this alliance, the movement was largely apolitical until the Harlem Riot of 1935. Based on a rumor of police killing a black teenager, the Harlem Riot left four dead and caused over $1 million in property damage in Father Divine&#x27;s neighborhood. Father Divine&#x27;s outrage at this and other racial injustices fueled a keener interest in politics. In January 1936, the movement organized a convention to create political platforms incorporating the doctrine of Father Divine. Among other things, the delegates opposed school segregation and many of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s social programs, which they interpreted as &quot;handouts&quot;. Other planks called for the nationalization and government control of the major banks and industries.

===1930s and 1940s: Peace Mission Movement scandals===
Reports of improper sexual conduct would slant much of the public perception of the Peace Mission throughout its stay in the public spotlight. Several highly publicized Peace Mission sex and other scandals became part of the public record on the Mission.

===1940s: the death of Peninniah (Mother) Divine, the rise of Sweet Angel and the doctrine of reincarnation===
Mrs Peninniah Divine, also called Mother Divine, had been married to Father Divine some 30 years at the time of her death. She died in seclusion amongst what was, at the time, the Peace Mission&#x27;s farms and other rural upstate New York business collectively called the &quot;Promised Land&quot;. She was buried in an unknown and unmarked grave. Peninniah Divine had been prominently active in the itinerant ministry of George Baker Jr from the Valdosta, Georgia, days and was regularly covered in the Peace Mission press up till about 1940 or 1941 before coverage of her simply stopped and she disappeared from Peace Mission life.

Almost no one knew that Mother Divine had died until 70-year-old Father Divine&#x27;s remarriage to his 21-year-old white Canadian secretary, Edna Rose Ritchings, also known as &quot;Sweet Angel&quot; in the movement, became public knowledge after her visa status came up for review. Father Divine claimed that his young secretary was his deceased wife returned.

Critics of the movement believed that the elderly and supposedly celibate Father Divine&#x27;s controversial marriage to his 21-year-old secretary would destroy the movement. The Peace Mission response was the institutionalization of celebrating the wedding anniversary. Despite predictions by some in the press and others of the imminent collapse of the entire movement, the marriage became one of the most important and celebrated events in the Peace Mission.

Reincarnation had not previously been an emphasized part of Father Divine&#x27;s doctrine and did not become a regular part of his theology until around 1960. Followers at the time believed that Peninniah was an exceptional case and viewed her &quot;return&quot; as &quot;Sweet Angel&quot; as a special miracle of Father Divine. The doctrine of reincarnation is now an accepted and regular teaching of the Peace Mission.

===1940s and the early 1950s: reorganization, Woodmont and the long decline of the Peace Mission movement===
In this period and through 1942, Father Divine centralized the movement into a formal church. Although this reduced the number of outposts, it put the organization under firmer control in the northeast. Three formal churches were set up in 1941, the Circle Mission Church the Unity Mission Church and the Palace Mission Church. Although they all had the same constitution and doctrines, they were financially independent. This redundancy made the movement stronger against legal attacks.

The Peace Mission&#x27;s political focus on anti-lynching measures became more resolved. By 1940, its followers had gathered 250,000 signatures in favor of an anti-lynching bill that Father Divine had written.

In 1953 the Movement acquired its signature parsonage Woodmont, a hilltop estate in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, outside of Philadelphia. This French Gothic manor served as the home of Father Divine until his death in 1965.

===1950s: the civil rights movement and the Peace Mission movement===
In 1951, The Peace Mission advocated reparations be paid to the descendants of African slaves. It also advocated in favor of integrated neighborhoods. However, unlike its earlier joint meetings and public marches with the Communist Party USA during its zenith decade of the 1930s, it did not participate in the burgeoning American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.

===1950s: The Red Scare and Peace Mission anti-communism===
By the 1950s, which included the beginnings of the modern US Civil Rights Movement, the Cold War between the US and the USSR was at an all-time high. The Peace Mission Movement&#x27;s depression era alliance with the radical left still rankled many. The Peace Mission response, starting around 1948/49, was to go on the anti-communist offensive, with Father Divine regularly lambasting communism while praising the &quot;American way&quot;, even reversing some of his most pointed criticisms of the American system from the 1930s. Which he would continue to do until his death in 1965.

===1960-1990s: Sweet Angel Divine leads the Peace Mission===
Father Divine died on September 6, 1965. He was succeeded at the helm of the movement by his widow, Mrs. &#x27;Sweet Angel&#x27; Divine (Edna Rose Ritchings a.k.a. &quot;Mother Divine&quot;).

Mother Divine continued to preside over the &quot;Holy Communion banquets&quot; that are central to Peace Mission worship, and she continued to have her husband&#x27;s taped and recorded messages played continuously at Peace Mission functions, in addition to distributing copies of his speeches in Peace Mission literature.

Over the decades, few new members have replaced the followers who die; thus the ability to sustain and maintain Peace Mission properties and publications has been severely degraded. The Peace Mission central newspaper, the &quot;New Day&quot;, first published in the movement&#x27;s heyday year of 1936, ceased publication in 1989.

===Early 21st century: contraction and current status===

The Peace Mission Movement has steadily contracted from its 1930s heyday through the first decades of the 21st century. On March 4, 2017, Mother Divine died at the Woodmont estate at age 91.

Due to the decline in members, several once-central and iconic Peace Mission properties of the 1940s and 1950s, including the Divine Tracy Hotel and the Divine Lorraine Hotel, were sold by the movement before Mother Divine&#x27;s death. Remaining properties of the Peace Mission include the Circle Mission Church, Home and Training School Inc in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which is the movement&#x27;s international headquarters, the original commune home in Sayville, Long Island, New York, at 72 Macon Street, which was Father Divine&#x27;s primary residence from 1919 to 1932 and is the Peace Mission&#x27;s New York headquarters, and the movement&#x27;s remaining signature property, the 73-acre, hilltop Woodmont manor house and estate outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Woodmont is the location of the Palace Mission Church and is also the official residence of the remaining Peace Mission leadership. The Peace Mission provides scheduled tours of both the Woodmont manor home and Father Divine&#x27;s nearby mausoleum called the &quot;Shrine To Life&quot;. On October 29, 2017, approximately 200 guests convened to celebrate the dedication and grand opening of the Father Divine Library and Museum at Woodmont.

<text>Mount Tongariro (; ) is a compound volcano in the Taupō Volcanic Zone of the North Island of New Zealand. It is located to the southwest of Lake Taupō, and is the northernmost of the three active volcanoes that dominate the landscape of the central North Island.

==Geology==
Mount Tongariro is part of the Tongariro volcanic centre, which consists of four massifs made of andesite: Tongariro, Kakaramea-Tihia Massif, Pihanga,
and Ruapehu at the southern end of the North Island Volcanic Plateau. The andesitic eruptions formed Tongariro, a steep stratovolcano, reaching a height of . Tongariro is composed of layers of both lava and tephra and the eruptions that built the current stratovolcano commenced about 275,000 years ago.

Tongariro consists of at least 12 cones. Ngauruhoe, while often regarded as a separate mountain, is geologically a cone of Tongariro. It is also the most active vent, having erupted more than 70 times since 1839, the last episode in 1973 to 1975.
Activity has also been recorded at other vents in recent history. Te Māri Craters erupted in 2012, for the first time since 1897. Red Crater last erupted ash in 1926 and contains active fumaroles. There are many explosion craters on the massif; water has filled some of these to form Blue Lake and the Emerald Lakes.

The high altitude and severe alpine climate between March and October allow snowfall in the winter (there are commercial ski-fields at neighbouring Mount Ruapehu) and rain can freeze, causing verglas; in contrast in the mid to late summer, the mountains can be bare apart from remnant patches of snow in south-facing gullies. Unlike nearby Mt. Ruapehu, no glaciers exist on Tongariro today. However, geomorphological evidence in the form of moraines and cirques indicates the former presence of mountain glaciers. Dating of moraines on western Tongariro show that valley glaciers were present at several times during the last glacial cycle, before melting away at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum approximately 18,000 years ago.

==History==
Mount Tongariro is in the Tongariro National Park, New Zealand&#x27;s first national park and one of the earliest in the world. It was set aside (literally &quot;made sacred&quot;) in 1887 by Te Heuheu Tukino IV (Horonuku), paramount chief of the Māori Ngati Tuwharetoa iwi and made a national park in order to preserve its natural beauty. The park also includes the peaks of Ngauruhoe and Ruapehu, both of which lie to the southwest of Tongariro. The national park is a dual World Heritage Site for its outstanding natural and intangible cultural values.

The Tongariro Alpine Crossing hiking route passes between Tongariro and Ngauruhoe.

Mount Tongariro and its surroundings are also one of the several locations which Peter Jackson chose to shoot &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy.

===Eruptive history===
The oldest recorded volcanism in the area was at 933,000 ± 46,000 years ago at Hauhungatahi, north-west of Ruapehu. There is then a gap in identified materials until a small lava inlier on the western side of Tongariro that has been dated at 512,000 ± 59,000 years ago and is essentially buried by more recent activity. The cone and ring-plain of the complex has multiple eruptive centres aligned with the Taupō volcanic rift and bounded by the Waihi and Poutu fault zones. The formation of these began about 304,000 years ago in the Tama lakes area and definitely was established by 230,000 years ago. The eruptive centres extend from the Te Maari craters in the north-east to the Tama Lakes in the south-west and include the more classic cone of Mount Ngauruhoe which like North Crater, another symmetrical but smaller cone, required the absence of ice after the last ice age to form. Tongariro displays evidence for extensive Quaternary glaciation in the form of moraines and lava-ice interaction textures. However Pukeonake is off this axis, approximately west of the linear vent zone, but is considered to be a satellite vent. The largest recent eruptions with volumes greater than occurred between 16,600 and 26,000 years ago with the Rotoaira tephras, at about 11,400 years ago producing the Pahoka tephra and the largest Mangamate Formation at about 11,200 years. The Pahoka-Mangamate sequence was an intense 200 year long period of large explosive eruptions from multiple vents between Tongariro and Ruapehu. This sequence is understood to have included a total volume of about in several episodes:
# Te Rato Episode, with Half Cone and North Crater active at similar times producing at least a tephra volume of (DRE ). This episode was from a deep magma reservoir at between depth.
# Oturere Episode, with three layers with initially Half Cone and Tama Lakes vents active at similar times, to a total volume of ; however, the final most recent layer was from the Tama Lakes area alone.
# Ohinepango - Waihohonu twin episodes, again from Half Cone and Tama lakes vents with the former predominant to a tolal volume of 
# Wharepu Episode, from only Tama Lake vents. This episode too was from a deep magma reservoir at between depth, and produced a tephra volume of at least .
# Poutu Episodes, an initial Blue Lake vent eruption was followed by a proto-Ngauruhoe vent eruption to the south of the present Ngauruhoe crater with a total of five layers of tephra deposited to a total tephra volume of .

====2012 Te Māri eruptions====

After a period of volcanic unrest that had resulted in an increase in alert level on 20 July 2012, at 11:50 pm (NZST, UTC+12) on 6 August 2012, Mt Tongariro had what was initially believed to be a hydrothermal eruption after this increased activity. The eruption occurred at the Te Māri Craters, which had not had a major ash eruption since 1897 and had been dormant since September 1899.

The eruption occurred in a new vent below the Upper Te Māri crater, and sent blocks as large as in size up to from the vent.

An ash cloud high deposited ash into the surrounding area, especially to the east of the volcano. The ash cloud travelled in four hours. NIWA reported the ash cloud contained about of ash, and that the ash cloud was long and wide 39 minutes after the eruption. Ash and the smell of sulphur was reported in Napier and Hastings. The smell of sulphur was also reported in Wellington, Nelson and Blenheim.

State Highway 1 to the east and State Highway 46 to the north of the mountain each received up to of ash cover, and were closed until the following morning due to ash and low visibility. A layer of ash thick settled on farmland east of Mount Tongariro. Particle sizes were between . The airspace within a radius of the mountain was closed after the eruption, but later reopened to visual flights only. Air New Zealand cancelled some flights in and out of Rotorua, Taupō, Gisborne, Napier, Wanganui and Palmerston North due to the risk of volcanic ash clogging the engines on their aircraft serving those airports.

No injuries were reported, and the only significant property damage was to the Department of Conservation&#x27;s Ketetahi Hut, which is located west of the Te Māri Craters. There was no official evacuation but 24 people living along State Highway 46 fled their homes for fear of being isolated.

Mount Tongariro erupted again at 1:20 pm on 21 November, ejecting an ash cloud 4000 metres into the air. Flights in the area were cancelled, as were several the following morning. Geologists had no warning before the eruption, saying it was not linked to warnings the week before of elevated activity at nearby Mount Ruapehu.

<text>Extremoduro () was a Spanish hard rock band from Plasencia, Extremadura. The band is led by Roberto Iniesta, also known as &quot;Robe&quot;, who is often referred as &quot;El rey de Extremadura&quot; (). The name Extremoduro is a pun on the band&#x27;s home region in western Spain, Extremadura, and roughly translates as &quot;extremely tough&quot;, &quot;rough edge&quot; or, more literally, &quot;hard extreme&quot;.

The band was created in 1987 and is regarded as one of the most influential bands of the Spanish hard rock scene, besides being a complete symbol for their region. Influenced by the Spanish literature, Iniesta&#x27;s lyrics are often described as rude street poetry, with frequent allusions to drugs, sex and self-destruction.

Songs by Extremoduro include &quot;So payaso&quot;, &quot;Golfa&quot;, &quot;Salir&quot;, &quot;Extremaydura&quot;, &quot;Puta&quot; and &quot;Jesucristo García&quot;. The highest moment in the band&#x27;s career was probably reached with the release of their album &quot;Agila&quot;, which was awarded a prize for best video in the first edition of the Spanish Music Awards in 1997.

It is considered one of the best Spanish bands ever by several music magazines. They were ranked number 6 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest Spanish rock bands&quot;.

In December 2019, the band announced a farewell tour of eight cities for May and June 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was first postponed to autumn 2020, then cancelled and the band officially disbanded.

== History ==
=== 1987 to 2001 ===

Roberto Iniesta (also known as &quot;Robe&quot;) establishes the band in the summer of 1987 in Plasencia, the second most important city of Cáceres, a province of the west of Spain. Previously, in 1983, he had formed the band ‘Dosis Letal’ with Zósimo &quot;Zosi&quot; Pascual, with whom he composed the song &quot;La Carrera&quot;, that would later come to be the penultimate track of Extremoduro&#x27;s 1996 disc Agíla.

Extremoduro were initially formed by Robe, as vocalist and guitarist, &quot;Chico&quot; on the bass and &quot;Miguelin&quot; on the drums. This initial set-up lasted just a few months, after which Robe decided to reconfigure the group and found Salo and Louis &quot;von Fanta&quot; to replace Kaito and William respectively. With this new dynamic in place, and with the difficulty they faced recording an album, they decided to sell vouchers to their acquaintances (at a thousand pesetas each) that would entitle each of them to a copy of the demo tape after it had been produced. They sold 250 of these &quot;coupons&quot; (whose buyers are credited in the finished production). After this, they produced 1000 copies of this first &quot;demo&quot; which already contained some of the quintessential anthems of the group, such as &quot;Extremaydura&quot; or &quot;Jesucristo Garcia&quot;; the collection is &quot;Rock transgresivo&quot;.

The distribution of this transgressive musical offering of rock began to attract attention inside and outside their home region of Plasencia; it was so well received that the Spanish television program Plastic invited them for a live performance. They were then selected for the national final of the Yamaha trophy in which they finished third.

It was in this final that Avispa Music noticed them and began negotiations for the release of their debut professionally recorded album, &quot;Tú en tu casa, nosotros en la hoguera&quot;. The album was recorded that summer, containing the same songs as &quot;Rock Transgresivo&quot; (in addition to &quot;Amor Castúo&quot;). The group often expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome and, in fact, in 1994 it was remixed and partially re-recorded to be reissued under another name.

At the end of this deal-making 1989, Robe restructured the band again: he switched to the role of supporting guitarist, to focus on the delivery of the vocals. In this way, Salo became lead guitarist and Carlos &quot;Dirty&quot; took up the vacancy for a bassist. In 1991, a deal was struck with Wasp to record the second album, but due to the poor expectations that the label offered, they decided to break this contract and sign with Pasión-Área Creativa, like Avispa Music, an independent company, but this time with better conditions. They record a second album with them in Madrid &quot;Somos unos animales&quot;, published in July 1991.

With the collaboration of vocalist and guitarist Madrid Rosendo Mercado (ex-Leño) on the songs &quot; &quot;La canción de los oficios&quot; &quot; (voice) and &quot; &quot;Perro Callejero&quot; &quot; (guitar), they themselves define it as the beginning of the true sound of Extremoduro that the band calls &quot;transgressive Rock.&quot;

In this first period, drugs – especially heroin – were the inseparable &#x27;other member&#x27; of the group. As such, the group&#x27;s live performances (usually considered their greatest asset) were unpredictable to say the least. Though they now had presence in the Spanish rock scene, it was said that Extremoduro&#x27;s live gigs were either &quot;unforgettable or a disaster.&quot; The group began to sell a lot and Pasión-Área Creativa proved too small for their ambitions, which together with other disputes (royalties not being paid for this LP), lead to them signing with DRO in 1991, giving them better distribution and promotion, and the means to the success that later years brought.

===DRO Atlantic signing===
DRO (Discos Radioactivos Organizados) was a record company founded in the &#x27;80s as Spain&#x27;s first independent record label by members of the Aviator Dro techno pop outfit. When Extremoduro got signed up with them in 1992, it was one of the largest independent labels in Spain, in the process of a sale to Warner Music International, one of the most important multinational actors in the music business. Although the label has changed its name (DRO-Atlantic, DRO East-West, Warner Music España...), Extremoduro has published all of its albums through them since signing up. Indeed, they have re-edited their two previous albums with DRO.

In 1992, the third studio album came to be; the first within their contract with DRO, Deltoya. This had its origin in a spin-off project from the band, of Robe&#x27;s: Extremozoide, although circumstances would cause this to be published as another album of Extremoduro&#x27;s. The album has a more erotic—and less social—theme than the previous discs, and most of the lyrics are adaptations of the poems by Kiko &quot;Luna Creciente&quot;, Tomás Rodríguez (the band&#x27;s manager) and Manolo Chinato. The album includes the voices and participation of other artists, such as Argentinian singer and guitarist Ariel Rot in &quot;Volando solo&quot;. It would not be the last time that Robe hatched upon a project that was independent of the group, nor the last time that this independence would prove to be short lived.

1993 is a crucial year in the history of Extremoduro. For starters, they cross paths with Iñaki &quot;Uoho&quot; Antón (then guitarist of Platero y Tú) in Bilbao and together with other musicians start a new project: La Pedrá. Robe is responsible for voice and guitar, Uoho for a second guitar, keyboards and percussion, and they join Dieguillo (bassist for Quemando Ruedas, Cicatriz, Antisocial), Gary (drums for Quattro Clavos) and Selu (from Reincidentes) with his saxophone and cante jondo. In August, they take to the studio to record a half-hour of music but it is highly experimental and discontinuous and the label refuses to back it, as it is seen as too risky. They would have to wait two more years for it to be sold commercially. Still, thanks to the stability that DRO gives the band, Robe is able to start a side project to Extremoduro in Barcelona: The Q3. This gives space to accommodate the ideas that did not work within Extremoduro. Jorge &quot;el Moja&quot; is on drums, Eugene on the guitar, Miguel Ferreras on bass and Ramón Sogas &quot;Mon&quot;, on the other bass.

Meanwhile, drugs continue to permeate Extremoduro, and throughout the tour there are disagreements in the band that lead to its break up. After being part of the band since recording the demo, and three albums, drummer Luis &quot;von Fanta&quot;, bassist Carlos &quot;el Sucio&quot; and guitarist Salo left the group. Robe, not about to see the band go down the pan, or abandon their dreams, replaces the disbanded members of Extremoduro with members of Q3, which marks the end of this project, but saves Extremoduro. It was with this collection of musicians that recorded the fourth album: ¿Dónde están mis amigos?, Which continues the style begun with Deltoya and confirms their reputation as one of the most important groups of Spanish rock. They remain unknown to the public at large due to their political incorrectness and raw style. The album was recorded in autumn 1993 and was published later that year. While all his works hitherto had been self-produced, this is the first record for which they hired a professional producer: Ventura Rico. This LP is considered the most personal and intimate of the band. This is probably due to the disintegration of the group, because now the other musicians are employees in a band that is directed by Robe himself. Fernando Madina from Reincidentes takes part in the song Pepe Botika (¿Dónde están mis amigos?).

<text>The Ward W. Willits House is a home in Highland Park, a suburb of Chicago in Illinois, United States. Designed in 1901 by architect Frank Lloyd Wright, the Willits house is considered one of the first of the great Prairie School houses. The house presents a symmetrical facade to the street and has a cruciform plan, with four wings extending out from a central fireplace. In addition to stained-glass windows and wooden screens that divide rooms, Wright also designed the furniture for the house.

==Background==
The Willits House is one of Wright&#x27;s first true Prairie-style houses; as such, it is the culmination of the period of experimentation that Wright engaged in the previous few years. This house was designed for Ward Winfield Willits in 1901, who was then vice-president of Adams and Westlake Company, a brass foundry of which he was later made president. Orlando Giannini, who was employed by Willits at the time, may have been responsible for the creation of this house as he introduced Wright to Willits. Wright was known for bridging the gap between architecture and nature, which makes this house fascinating because it is a full expression of Wright&#x27;s interest in reconnecting with nature and Wright&#x27;s equal interest in Japanese architecture and the Dutch art movement that was simultaneously occurring.

==Design==
The Willits House is the first house in true Prairie style and marks the full development of Wright&#x27;s wood frame and stucco system of construction. Although the Willits House has two stories, it is a more complex shape, consisting of a rectangular central space with a rectangular wing projecting from each side of that space. This is a standard design feature for most prairie-style houses, in addition to low roofs, elements that run parallel to the ground and extend out beyond the frame of the house. Wright used a cruciform plan with the interior space flowing around a central chimney core and extending outward onto covered verandas and open terraces. The plan of the house is a windmill style, as seen with the four wings extending from the fireplace in the central core and the movement from each wing being along a diagonal line. Wing two contains the great living room with high windows and a walled terrace. The dining room, extended by a large porch, comprises the third wing; the fourth, towards the rear of the house, contains the kitchen and servants&#x27; quarters. Wright incorporates diagonals into several other places in his design – the dining room has a prow-shaped end bay and another prow-shaped projection, the reception room has a similar prow-shaped bay, the art glass light over the entry stairway is rotated 45 degrees, again emphasizing the diagonal, and the terminating piers of the porte cochere are offset from the end wall by 45 degrees.

The first floor contains the living room that faces the street, the dining room, kitchen, pantry, servants&#x27; quarters, reception, porte cochere, veranda, and terrace. The first floor also contains several fireplaces that are clustered together. An entrance-stair hall, living room, dining room and kitchen rotate around the central fireplace. The plan of the house begins to open up and the rooms are linking much more strongly outward. The house is less contained and architecture that moved outwards was one of the main features. Moving to the second floor of the house, it contains five bedrooms, a sewing room and a library over the south entrance. Instead of continuing the west bedroom (directly over the living room) the full width of the wing, Wright left space for second-floor side porches and urns .

The Willits House was seen as an entertainment-style home. The use of the Romanesque archway in the entrance, an emphasis on horizontals as seen in the low roofs of the dining room wing and porte cochere and the use of different trim materials in the upper part of the house. When light shines on this area, the roof appears to be hovering and displays very deep and dark shadows. Another unique feature of this house is that Wright was able to design everything in the house, from the furniture to the lighting fixtures.

==Architect-client relationship==

Wright and the Willits&#x27;s became friends soon after meeting and realizing that with Wright&#x27;s architectural expertise and Willits&#x27;s company making contributions to many architectural projects, a vision for the Ward Willits House was possible. The client and architect continued their relationship after the house was completed, and Willits and his wife accompanied Frank Lloyd Wright and his first wife, Catherine (Tobin) Wright, on a trip to Japan in 1905. The trip went well and was a first for Wright; however, the relationship could not withstand the hardships that occur by being an architect and having a strong relationship with one&#x27;s client. The clients were wealthy and had enough money to have the house built—although their friendship barely survived the ill treatment of Wright&#x27;s first wife and family and unpaid loans Wright is said to have had with Willits, eventually repaid with sales of some of the many Japanese prints acquired on the trip. Nonetheless, Ward Willits spent many years with his wife in the house and lived there until his death in 1950.

==Post-1954==
The house was purchased in 1983 and the new owner began renovations. The new owner and his wife mainly completed the work, focusing on returning the building to a point in time approximating 1909, and they made sure to maintain Wright&#x27;s unique features throughout the house. The restoration was acknowledged by many to be Museum quality, and received a Driehaus award. The house still sits on the same site in Highland Park, Illinois and is a common attraction for those who want to view a piece of architectural history. The Frank Lloyd Wright &quot;Tour of the North Shore&quot; currently explores the northern suburbs of Chicago along Lake Michigan to see one dozen Frank Lloyd Wright houses, including the Ward Willits House.

<text>Reno Stead Airport is a large public and military general aviation airport located in the North Valleys area, 10 nautical miles (19 km) northwest of the central business district of Reno, in Washoe County, Nevada, United States. A former military installation until 1966, when it was known as Stead Air Force Base, in honor of 1st Lt. Croston Stead who died there during a training exercise in 1949. 
The airport&#x27;s sole remaining military presence consists of an Army Aviation Support Facility and the 189th General Support Aviation Battalion of the Nevada Army National Guard, flying CH-47 Chinook helicopters. The airport is owned by the Reno Tahoe Airport Authority. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a general aviation &quot;reliever airport&quot;.

Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, this airport is assigned RTS by the FAA, but has no designation from the IATA (which assigned RTS to Rottnest Island Airport in Rottnest Island, Western Australia). Reno Stead Airport does not have regularly scheduled service, but functions as a general aviation reliever for the nearby Reno–Tahoe International Airport. The airport is used by the Bureau of Land Management as a base for fire fighting aircraft.

==History==
The location was opened by the United States Army Air Forces in 1942, in the middle of World War 2.

Stead Air Force Base was established by the United States Air Force (USAF) at the airfield in 1951, when it was determined that the Sierra Nevada and nearby forests would be suitable for survival training. The USAF Survival School and 3904th Composite Wing moved to the base from Camp Carson, Colorado, on 29 May 1951. Equipped with C-119 Flying Boxcars for training, SAC had begun the training for its personnel, teaching them how to survive if forced down in remote and/or unfriendly terrain, how to escape capture, and how to escape if captured.

Other commands wanted to train aircrews in survival techniques, and in September 1954 Stead AFB became part of the Air Training Command (ATC), and the 3904th Composite Wing became the 3635th Combat Crew Training Wing. After a number of name changes, the survival training school became the 3637th Combat Crew Training Squadron.

In January 1958, a small group of instructor pilots from Randolph AFB, Texas, was sent to Stead AFB to determine the feasibility of advanced helicopter training in the area&#x27;s mountains. On 15 July 1958, the 3635th Crew Training Wing was redesignated as the 3635th Flying Training Wing (Advanced), concurrent with the relocation of the USAF Helicopter Pilot School to Stead.

In 1960 and 1962, astronauts were trained in desert survival by the 3637th Combat Crew Training Squadron and then helicoptered to a location near the Carson Sink for further training.

In 1964 the Reno Stead Airport was operated by the Ag Aviation Academy, which was then based in Minden, Nevada, about 15 miles south of Carson City. By 1966, the AG Aviation Academy moved totally up to Stead. In 1967 Robert E. Schricker retired from a 27-year career as a fighter pilot for the USAF and became Chief Pilot for the AG Academy. The academy taught all types of flying courses and ground schools, including helicopter and multi engine courses. Actress and race pilot, Susan Oliver, got her multi engine pilot license there in 1968. Chief Pilot Schricker left the AG Academy in 1969 to open his own flight school, Reno&#x27;s Executive Air, at the main Reno Airport. In the 1960s Bill Lear, Lear Aviation, founder of the Lear Jet, also set up operations at the Stead Airport. Since 1964, it has been home to the National Championship Air Races, also known as the Reno Air Races, held every September. It was the launch site of &quot;Earthwinds&quot; balloon system in the early 1990s, which attempted and failed multiple times to circumnavigate the globe.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Reno/Stead Airport covers an area of 5,000 acres (2,023 ha) at an elevation of 5,050 feet (1,539 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways with asphalt surfaces: 14/32 is 9,000 by 150 feet (2,743 x 46 m) and 8/26 is 7,608 by 150 feet (2,319 x 46 m).

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2020, the airport had 49,800 aircraft operations, an average of 136 per day: 86% general aviation and 14% military.
At that time there were 186 aircraft based at this airport: 136 single-engine, 16 military, 9 multi-engine, 19 jet, and 6 helicopters.

<doc id="876344" wikidata="Q6965050" url="?curid=876344" title="Napoleon Symphony">
<text>Napoleon Symphony: A Novel in Four Movements () is Anthony Burgess&#x27;s fictional recreation of the life and world of Napoleon Bonaparte, first published in 1974 (by Jonathan Cape in the UK and Alfred A. Knopf in the US). Its four &quot;movements&quot; follow the structure of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 3,&quot; known as the &quot;Eroica&quot;. Burgess said he found the novel &quot;elephantine fun&quot; to write.

==Synopsis==
Burgess&#x27;s Bonaparte is a cuckold suffering from heartburn and halitosis who is portrayed as a wily seducer of Tsar Alexander I of Russia. His conquest of Egypt is a central theme of the novel, which presents a comedic but detailed and revealing portrait of an Arab and Muslim society under occupation by a Christian Western power.

==Background==
Beethoven had originally dedicated his Third Symphony to Bonaparte. But when he learned that Napoleon had crowned himself Emperor, he tore the dedication from the manuscript. When the work was published it was titled, &quot;Sinfonia eroica, composta per festeggiare il sovvenire d&#x27;un grand&#x27;Uomo&quot; (Heroic symphony, composed to celebrate the memory of a great man), known to posterity as the &quot;Eroica&quot;.

The novel is dedicated to Stanley Kubrick, who had directed the film adaptation of Burgess&#x27;s earlier novel, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Kubrick had intended to make a biographical film about Bonaparte, but was dissatisfied with his own screenplay. They corresponded, then met in December 1971. Burgess suggested to Kubrick that the structure of the film could be based on the &quot;Eroica&quot; symphony, and was asked by Kubrick to write a novel based on this concept to serve as the basis for a screenplay. Using his own knowledge of symphonic structure, Burgess based his writing closely on the sequence of Beethoven&#x27;s work, with Napoleon&#x27;s funeral followed by a resurrection. In June 1972 he sent the first section to Kubrick, who responded with regret that the treatment was unsuitable for a film, writing, &quot;the [manuscript] is not a work that can help me make a film about the life of Napoleon.&quot; Freed from these constraints, Burgess developed the work into an experimental novel. He reworked the material into a stage play called &quot;Napoleon Rising&quot; for the Royal Shakespeare Company, but it remained unperformed in his lifetime. It was first performed in a radio adaptation for the BBC on 2 December 2012.

==Reception==
Burgess suggested that reviews on both sides of the Atlantic were &quot;mixed&quot;, with negative reviews from Peter Ackroyd in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, and from &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Two years later, when the novel was published in French, Burgess noted that reviews were more positive.

<doc id="876351" wikidata="Q934314" url="?curid=876351" title="Aleksandr Aleksandrov (mathematician)">
<text>Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov (, alternative transliterations: &quot;Alexandr&quot; or &quot;Alexander&quot; (first name), and &quot;Alexandrov&quot; (last name)) (4 August 1912 – 27 July 1999) was a Soviet/Russian mathematician, physicist, philosopher and mountaineer.

== Personal life ==
Aleksandr Aleksandrov was born in 1912 in Volyn, Ryazan Oblast. His father was a headmaster of a secondary school in St Petersburg and his mother a teacher at said school, thus the young Alekandrov spent a majority of his childhood in the city. His family was old Russian nobility—students noted ancestral portraits which hung in his office. His sisters were Soviet botanist Vera Danilovna Aleksandrov (RU) and Maria Danilovna Aleksandrova, author of the first monograph on gerontopsychology in the USSR. In 1937, he married a student of the Faculty of Physics, Marianna Leonidovna Georg. Together they had two children: Daria (b. 1948) and Daniil (RU) (b. 1957). In 1980, he married Svetlana Mikhailovna Vladimirova (nee Bogacheva). In 1951 he became a member of the Communist Party.

Alekandrov had a personal love for poetry, writing and translating. Once, on a trip to London, he was received as a visiting Shakespeare scholar. He was also very well travelled, visiting India, the US, and throughout Europe.

== Scientific career ==

He graduated from the Department of Physics of Leningrad State University. His advisors there were Vladimir Fock, a physicist, and Boris Delaunay, a mathematician. In 1933 Aleksandrov worked at the State Optical Institute (GOI) and at the same time gave lectures at the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of the university. He completed his Ph.D. in 1935 at the university and later in 1937 — a D.Sc. dissertation. He became a professor at the university, while also working at LOMI, the Leningrad Department of the Steklov Mathematical Institute (now PDMI, Petersburg Department of the Mathematical Institute). Appointed the rector of the university in 1952, Aleksandrov remained in this position until 1964. He was the youngest rector in university history, and was fairly popular. One of his main contributions was the attempted move of Leningrad State University to Old Peterhof, which proved unsuccessful. In 1946 he became a corresponding member, and in 1964 a full member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Since1975 he was also a member of the Accademia dei Quaranta.

From 1964 to 1986 Aleksandrov lived in Novosibirsk, heading the Laboratory of Geometry of the Institute of Mathematics of the Siberian Division of the USSR Academy of Sciences, teaching at Novosibirsk State University. In 1986 he returned to Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) to head the geometry laboratory at LOMI.

Aleksandrov&#x27;s main work was in the study of differential geometry and physics. His work in geometry specifically is said to be second only to Gauss by N. V. Efimov, V. A. Zalgaller and A. V. Pogorelov.

== Awards ==
Partial list of the awards, medals, and prizes awarded to Aleksandrov:
* Stalin Prize (1942)
* Lobachevsky International Prize (1951)
* Euler Gold Medal of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1992)
One of the many orders that he was awarded was given to him in 1990 for his efforts in preserving genetics from the attacks of the pseudoscience of Lysenkoism that had official state support in the times of Stalin and Khrushchev.

== Works by Aleksandrov ==
Aleksandrov wrote a multitude of books, scientific papers, textbooks for various levels (schools to universities), including &quot;Convex Polyhedra&quot;, originally published in Russian in 1950 and translated into English in 2005. He also wrote non-mathematical papers, memoirs about famous scientists, and philosophical essays dealing with the moral values of science.

* A. Pogorelov — from Kharkov
* A. Yusupov — from Bukhara
* Students from the Aleksandrov Leningrad period (ordered by the time of joining the seminars): Yu. Borisov, V. Zalgaller, Yu. Reshetnyak, I. Bakelman, Yu. Volkov, A. Zamorzaev, S. Bogacheva (who later married Aleksandrov), Yu. Borovskii, R. Pimenov
* Sobchuk and Starokhozyayev — from Ukraine
* G. Rusiyeshvili — from Georgia (country)
* B. Frank and H. Frank — from Germany
* Yu. Burago, V. Kreinovich; Grigori Perelman
* Moved from Alma-Ata after Aleksandrov&#x27;s lecture tour there: M. Kvachko, V. Ovchinnikova, E. Sen&#x27;kin
* Stayed in Alma-Ata: A. Zilberberg, V. Strel&#x27;cov, D. Yusupov
* Novosibirsk students: A. Guts, A. Kuz&#x27;minykh, A. Levichev, and A. Shaidenko.

Both in St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk Aleksandrov participated in joint research also with some of his students&#x27; students. Several of them became his co-authors: V. Berestovskii, A. Verner, N. Netsvetaev, I. Nikolaev, and V. Ryzhik.

His last Ph.D. student was Grigori Perelman who proved Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture in 2002/2003 which contains the Poincaré conjecture as a special case.

==Mountaineering==
Aleksandrov became attracted to alpinism under the influence of his advisor Boris Delaunay. In the summer of 1937, after defending his D.Sc.,
:&quot;…together with I. Chashnikov he makes a first climb to the Chotchi summit, and with K. Piskaryov performs a climb of Bu-Ul&#x27;gen via the western wall (one of the first wall climbs in the history of the Soviet alpinism).[…] In 1940  he participates in a record-making traversal[…] He manages, almost by a miracle, to stop the fall of A. Gromov, who had fallen along with a snow shelf. It was with this traversal that Aleksandrov completed the alpinist sports master requirements. The German-Soviet War postponed awarding him this honorary title until 1949.&quot;

During his rectorship, Aleksandrov also advanced the mountaineering sport activities in the university, actively participating in the climbs.

The fiftieth birthday was celebrated by Aleksandrov in the mountains with his friends. On that day he made a solo first climb of an
: &quot;…unnamed peak 6222 m (Shakhdarinsk ridge, Pamir), that as he suggested was then named &quot;The peak of the Leningrad university.&quot;&quot;

During later years Aleksandrov was unable to climb due to health problems, yet he never ceased dreaming of climbing. Finally, in 1982, the year of his seventieth birthday, he, together with K. Tolstov, performed in Tian Shan his last climb, of the Panfilov Peak…

<text>Theme Hospital is a business simulation game developed by Bullfrog Productions and published by Electronic Arts in 1997 for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows compatible PCs in which players design and operate a privately owned hospital with the goal of curing patients of fictitious comical ailments. The game is the thematic successor to &quot;Theme Park&quot;, also produced by Bullfrog, and the second instalment in their &quot;Theme&quot; series, and part of their &quot;Designer Series&quot;. The game is noted for its humour, and contains numerous references to pop culture.

Peter Molyneux and James Leach came up with the idea of creating a &quot;Theme&quot; game based on a hospital, but Molyneux was not directly involved in development due to his work on &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;. Designers originally planned to include four distinct gameplay modes corresponding to historical time periods, but this was dropped due to time pressures on the team. Multiplayer support with up to four players was added in a patch. The game received a generally positive reception, with reviewers praising the graphics and humour in particular. &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; was a commercial success, selling over 4 million copies worldwide, and was ported to the PlayStation 1 in 1998. A Sega Saturn version was in development, but cancelled. The game was re-released on GOG.com in 2012 and Origin in 2014, and the PlayStation version was released on the PlayStation Network in Europe in 2008, Japan in 2009, and North America in 2010. Revival attempts have been made with the development of open-source remakes such as &quot;CorsixTH&quot;.

== Gameplay ==

The player is required to build an environment that will attract patients with comical diseases and then treat them while tending to their needs. The game has a somewhat dark sense of humour, similar to that of its predecessor, &quot;Theme Park&quot;. Diseases include Bloaty Head (which swells the patient&#x27;s head), King Complex (which forces the patient to impersonate Elvis Presley), and Alien DNA (which transforms the patient into an alien).

Starting with an empty hospital, the player must build rooms and hire doctors, nurses, handymen and receptionists. Each staff member has statistics that affect their performance, and doctors can be trained so their statistics will increase. Rooms include GP&#x27;s Offices, Psychiatric rooms, Operating Theatres and Pharmacies, and are built by placing down a blueprint, assigning the location of doors and windows, and then placing down required and optional pieces of furniture. The player may also set up items such as benches, fire extinguishers, and plants in the open corridor spaces provided. The player is given time to build the hospital at the start of each level before patients start coming. Patients see a GP in his office who either provides a diagnosis or sends them for further evaluation in a specialised diagnosis room. Once a diagnosis is made, the patient will be sent for treatment. While a few rooms are available at the start of the game, the rest must be researched. Some rooms, such as the Inflator room—where patients with Bloaty Head are treated—contain machines which require regular maintenance by a handyman: if neglected for too long, they will explode, killing all occupants of the room. Doctors must have acquired certain specialist skills to practise in certain rooms, such as the Research room (used to research new rooms and cures, and improve existing ones) and Operating Theatre. There are rooms that only staff use, such as the Staff Room and the Training room, while patients also require certain rooms such as toilet facilities.

Diagnosis and treatment cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including the amount of diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt to cover it up by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, they are fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.

Although the player has no direct control over the patients, they have some influence over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining what to do with them when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.

The player competes against computer rivals named after famous computers, real and fictional: these include Holly from &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and Deep Thought from &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. The game is timed with days of the year, and at the end of each year (game time), players are judged on their performances, and may be given trophies, reputation increases, or cash bonuses.

Each level has set goals in the fields of financial attainment, hospital reputation, patients cured, and hospital value. Holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die will bring about losing requirements. When the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present, or stick with their current one. If enough rats have been shot, the player is taken to a special level whose goal is to shoot as many as possible.

A patch was released that fixed bugs and added support for Serial Cable, Modem, and IPX/SPX network gaming (with up to four players) in the Windows version, and a difficulty setting. In multiplayer, each player has a colour, which patients will wear to distinguish from those of other players. &quot;Litter Bombs&quot; are featured, allowing players to spread litter around other players&#x27; hospitals, while staff members can be persuaded to work for other players, and there are &quot;Mini Missions&quot;, with instructions for players to perform. Players are also able to chat with each other during a game.

== Development ==
&quot;Theme Hospital&quot; took over two years to develop. The idea came from Peter Molyneux and journalist James Leach, who explored the possibility of other &quot;Theme&quot; games while discussing &quot;Theme Park&quot;. Leach suggested a hospital, and Molyneux was enthusiastic about the idea. Development began when the designer Mark Webley selected &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; from a list of possible games put together by Molyneux, and Webley, along with the artist Gary Carr, visited the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Great Ormond Street Hospital, and Frimley Park Hospital for research and inspiration. Carr was initially displeased at the prospect of working on &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;: he had previously left Bullfrog to work for The Bitmap Brothers because he did not have faith in &quot;Theme Park&quot;. He chose to return based on his belief that he would work on &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;, which he was eager to do. Initially, &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; was to feature real diseases, but these were replaced with fictional, comedic afflictions as it was decided that the game&#x27;s maladies should not be too realistic: the team were faced with the dilemma of having to make the hospital fun and interesting, as Webley stated that theme parks are &quot;colourful&quot; compared to hospitals, and Carr believed that hospital rooms looked very similar and that it was hard to tell what each machine does.

It was during a hospital visit (after witnessing an operation that they were ordered out of because they were distracting the surgeon) that they came up with the idea of using made-up illnesses and cures: Carr considered death &quot;quite sad&quot; and believed that illness was not a popular subject. He stated that using made-up illnesses gave them &quot;creative freedom&quot;, which he believed was essential. Webley said that Carr was concerned that using real diseases might be considered distasteful. According to Carr, the team were aiming for humour rather than gore. During the initial stages of programming, Bullfrog hired James Leach, who wrote the game&#x27;s text and came up with the diseases. Molyneux was not directly involved in the game&#x27;s production as he was then working on &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;.

The graphic design was decided to be modelled from those of cartoons, and a goal was to have two thousand character animations. Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time, and the team ultimately ended up with four. Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the Kit Kat graphics correct. He said they did not have the right colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, all that was left was refining the difficulty levels.

The game deviates from the NHS model; Webley and Carr decided that players should think of the hospital as a business, with profit highly important. The team, who worked in offices near the Royal Surrey County Hospital, drew some inspirations from &quot;Theme Park&quot; and borrowed a great deal of code. Webley explained that this was an &quot;obvious starting point&quot; as he had been a programmer on &quot;Theme Park&quot;, and that the systems had been rewritten by the time &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; was complete. A program which facilitated animation was built upon by Webley, who dubbed it the Complex Engine. There were not many meetings, and Webley took the team to the pub weekly with a list of tasks to perform. Webley explained that the way the team worked meant that only they could perform their assigned duties otherwise they would not get done, effectively giving members ownership of their parts of the game. It was during one such meeting that the team realised the game was complete. The disease called King Complex was to be called Elvis Impersonator, but Elvis&#x27;s estate owned the rights. Bloaty Head was based on an allergic reaction Molyneux had, when his face became an &quot;alarming size&quot;.

According to Leach, the volume of work was small. A big problem was that the team had too many ideas, and insufficient time to implement them all. For example, other diseases were planned; one of these was Animal Magnetism, which would see patients with attached animals which would have to be cut away. Another idea that was not implemented was the possibility of four separate in-game eras: futuristic, mediaeval, Victorian, and modern. The game was originally to have players begin in the mediaeval zone, and progress to more modern ones. By May 1996, the idea of the other time periods had been deemed &quot;prohibitive&quot; due to the amount of graphics required. Carr later stated that the game did not need the other eras, and that the team was small enough to make things up as they went along. Carr was also afraid that if they had produced a design document, Electronic Arts would have considered the omission of the other eras feature cutting. An idea that Molyneux pushed Webley&#x27;s team to implement was a screen that enabled players to mix coloured chemicals to apply them to diseases. Accessibility was also a concern for the team: with so many options, it was felt that players could treat the game like work. The tester Jon Rennie simplified the game from the original design; Webley was keen for players to be able to begin play without a long tutorial.

&quot;Theme Hospital&quot; was released on 28 March 1997 (although it was previously due for release in November 1996), and is part of Bullfrog&#x27;s &quot;Designer Series&quot;. The game attracted some controversy from NHS managers, the Houses of Parliament, and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, who published an article criticising the game as &quot;sick&quot; and said that the British Medical Association was using it to train management staff. The NHS argued that the game mocked hospital management. Webley was invited to appear on a local radio station; he did not consider the game to make light of real-world health management because it featured fictional diseases rather than real ones. &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; was a commercial success, which surprised Bullfrog and Electronic Arts. It repeatedly appeared in the top five of budget charts and sold over 4 million copies. In 2014, Molyneux stated that he wanted the game to make a comeback, and described &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; as &quot;a great game that I and many people remember&quot;.

Original releases&#x27; cover art used a green cross on a white background, which Bullfrog did not have the right to use. The artwork was mistakenly approved because it was faxed in black and white, and had to be recalled. Later releases changed the cross to a star. Despite its rejection, the cross version is available in more recent formats.

=== Sound ===

The music and sound effects were produced by Russell Shaw and Adrian Moore. Moore used Sound Forge to develop the sound effects. Some (such as the snooker balls) were taken directly from its library, and others (including the treatment machines) were created by mixing sounds together. Some machine sounds were created by mixing the sounds of electric egg mixer with that of a hydraulic lifter. The farting sounds were recorded when Moore was working with bands including T&#x27;Pau, Prefab Sprout, and Seal at a recording studio: he did so as a joke, but they were useful for &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;.

=== Ports and re-releases ===
A PlayStation port of &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; was developed by Krisalis Software and released by Electronic Arts in 1998. The PlayStation version was released as a download on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable from PlayStation Store in Europe on 31 January 2008, in North America on 31 August 2010, and in Japan on 28 October 2009. Later PlayStation Vita version become available on PSN exclusively for Japan. This version is no longer available for purchase in Europe since September 2014, after becoming free for a short period of time. A Sega Saturn version (titled &quot;Sim Hospital&quot; as of October 1995) was in development and due for release in mid-1996, but was cancelled.

In 2012, &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; was re-released on the digital distribution service GOG.com. In January 2015, Origin distributed &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; free for a limited time through their &quot;On the House&quot; programme. It was distributed a second time through the &quot;On the House&quot; programme in September the same year, as a temporary replacement to &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2&quot; due to an excessive number of requests for the latter. It was released a third time in selected countries in 2017 from 7 March to 17 May as a replacement for &quot;Syberia 2&quot;.

An open-source remake, &quot;CorsixTH,&quot; improves the original game with features such as modern OS support, higher screen resolutions and a level editor. &quot;CorsixTH&quot; is available under the MIT Licence, and in 2012, a version was released on Android, available on the Google Play Store.

== Reception ==
&quot;Theme Hospital&quot; received positive reviews. Critics noted the strong gameplay, detailed graphics, satisfying comedic tone, and voice acting performance, but fell conflicted on music, repetition, the artificial intelligence, and the user interface.

The British magazine &quot;PC Gamer&quot; Steve Owen praised the game&#x27;s challenge and &quot;cute&quot; graphics, but criticised the interface. Frederick Claude of &quot;Coming Soon Magazine&quot; also complimented the graphics as &quot;highly detailed&quot;, and the &quot;very simple&quot; user interface, although he criticised the repetitiveness and lack of multiplayer support that would later be introduced with a patch. GameSpot Trent Ward agreed about the graphics too, lauding them as &quot;fantastic&quot;, and also complimented the &quot;realistic&quot; voice acting performance, and the humour, although he criticised the artificial intelligence as &quot;flawed&quot;. His conclusion was that the game &quot;just doesn&#x27;t fly&quot;. Bonnie James of The Electric Playground also liked the graphics, as well as the &quot;lovely&quot; opening sequence, but found the music &quot;horrible&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; Alex Huhtala concurred about the graphics, describing them as &quot;large and colourful&quot;, but commented that the humour wears off after a while, although he felt it is good to begin with.

Another reviewer who liked the graphics was Dawn Jepsen of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, who also praised the humour, especially the &quot;wackiness&quot; of the illnesses, and described the game as &quot;delightful and absorbing&quot;. The humour was also approved by a reviewer of Jeuxvideo.com, who, like other reviewers, lauded the graphics, by describing them as colourful. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewer echoed others&#x27; views about the humour, describing it as something they had come to expect from Bullfrog, but criticised the lack of multiplayer support. The humour was again praised by a reviewer of &quot;PC Power&quot;, who said that the ailments enabled Bullfrog to have &quot;hilarious&quot; cures. The &quot;thoroughly engrossing&quot; gameplay, and the graphics were also complimented: it was stated that the bright colours gave hospitals a &quot;cheerful look&quot;. &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; was described as a &quot;fantastic title&quot;. Other comments from critics included &quot;Edge&quot; reviewer&#x27;s compliments of the balance of patients and illnesses against the player&#x27;s resources, and his belief that the game is a refinement of its genre, and &quot;PC Zone&quot; reviewers commendation of the detail: it was remarked that it gets players &quot;helplessly immersed&quot;, and the game was awarded the &quot;PC Zone&quot; Classic accolade. Éric Ernaux of &quot;Génération 4&quot; said the quality is &quot;remarkable for a game of its genre&quot;.

The PlayStation version&#x27;s main problem, as noted by critics, was the controls. It was cited by reviewers from GameSpot, IGN, Eurogamer, &quot;Edge&quot;, and &quot;GamePro&quot; as a major downside. &quot;GamePro&quot; explained, &quot;Since the game was developed for mouse control, the directional pad&#x27;s response is a bit jerky.&quot; Its reception was not entirely negative: James Mielke of GameSpot also commended the addictiveness, and described the port as &quot;almost completely intact&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; found the dry humor was the game&#x27;s shining quality, offering the player a consistent source of laughter through the steep challenges. IGN agreed with others about the humour, by praising it as &quot;wonderfully sick&quot;. It was further commented that the game&#x27;s &quot;brilliance&quot; made it a &quot;must-have&quot;. The sentiments about the controls and humour were echoed by Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer, who reviewed it on the PlayStation Network. Absolute PlayStation&#x27;s reviewers had a mixed view about the graphics: they criticised the resolution and colour palette, but complimented the sprites. The user interface was criticised as being reminiscent of a 16-bit game. Despite the criticisms, they agreed with others about the humour, and described the game as &quot;a blast to play&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot;″s reviewer lauded the depth and accessibility.

In 1997, &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; appeared alongside &quot;Theme Park&quot; at #61 on &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s list of top 100 games, and was named in April as a Game of Distinction.

=== Legacy ===
Oxymoron Games made &quot;Project Hospital&quot;, which is their take on &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;. Two Point Studios, a studio founded by Webley and Carr, developed a similar game &quot;Two Point Hospital&quot;, a spiritual sequel to &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;. Both games were released in 2018: &quot;Two Point Hospital&quot; was released on 30 August, while &quot;Project Hospital&quot; was released on 30 October. &quot;Two Point Hospital&quot; features the Animal Magnetism disease, that was originally cut from &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; before release.

<text>Bernard MacLaverty (born 14 September 1942) is an Irish fiction writer and novelist. His novels include &quot;Cal&quot; and &quot;Grace Notes&quot;. He has written five books of short stories.

==Biography==
MacLaverty was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and educated at Holy Family Primary School in the Duncairn district and then at St Malachy&#x27;s College. After school, he worked as a medical laboratory technician and studied at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. He lived in Belfast until 1975, when he moved to Scotland with his wife, Madeline, and four children (Ciara, Claire, John, and Jude). He initially lived in Edinburgh and then the island of Islay before settling in the West End of Glasgow.

He was Writer-in-Residence at the Universities of Aberdeen, Liverpool John Moores, Augsburg and Iowa State. He was the Ireland Fund Artist-in-Residence in the Celtic Studies Department of University of St. Michael&#x27;s College, a college at University of Toronto, in October 2007.

==Work==
MacLaverty is the author of five novels and seven short story collections. His first novel &quot;Lamb&quot; was published in 1980. It is about faith, relationships and love. It was followed by &quot;Cal&quot; in 1983. This is an examination of love in the midst of violence. &quot;Grace Notes&quot;, which was published in 1997, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for Fiction. It is about the conflict between a desire to compose and motherhood. &quot;The Anatomy School&quot; (2001) is a comedic coming-of-age novel. 

He has also written six collections of short stories, the contents of which are mostly in &quot;Collected Stories&quot; (Cape, 2013).

MacLaverty wrote a screenplay for &quot;Cal&quot; in 1984, which was picked up for production by Goldcrest Films; Helen Mirren and John Lynch starred in &quot;Cal&quot; (1984), and Mark Knopfler composed the film soundtrack, also called &quot;Cal&quot;. The film was entered into the 1984 Cannes Film Festival, where Mirren won the award for Best Actress. It was received well by critics, but lost money in the box office on the order of –£118,000 net profit. He also adapted &quot;Lamb&quot; for the screen; Liam Neeson and Hugh O&#x27;Conor starred in &quot;Lamb&quot; (1985) and Van Morrison composed the soundtrack.

MacLaverty has written versions of his fiction for other media – radio plays, television plays, screenplays and libretti. In 2003 he wrote and directed a short film &quot;Bye-Child&quot; (BAFTA-nominated for &quot;Best Short Film&quot;) and more recently wrote libretti for Scottish Opera&#x27;s Five:15 series &quot;The King’s Conjecture&quot;, with music by Gareth Williams, and &quot;The Letter&quot; with music by Vitaly Khodosh. For Scottish Opera in 2012, and again with music by Gareth Williams, he wrote &quot;The Elephant Angel&quot;, an opera for schools, which toured Scotland and Northern Ireland.

<text>The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), sometimes unofficially referred to as the International Stratigraphic Commission, is a daughter or major subcommittee grade scientific organization that concerns itself with stratigraphical, geological, and geochronological matters, worldwide.

It is the largest subordinate body of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). The ICS is essentially a permanent working subcommittee, which meets far more regularly than the quadrennial meetings scheduled by the IUGS, when it meets as a congress or membership of the whole.

==Aims==

One of its main aims, a project begun in 1974, is to establish a multidisciplinary standard and global geologic time scale that will ease paleontological and geobiological comparisons region to region by benchmarks with stringent and rigorous strata criteria called Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Points (GSSPs) within the fossil record. (i.e. section of the rock record as of a core sample section or accessible exposed strata, which when a core sample are usually &quot;trayed&quot; in long pieces, also called &quot;sections&quot; about a meter in length.)

==Methodology==
Additionally the ICS defines an alternative type of benchmark and criteria called Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages (GSSAs) where the characteristics and dating criteria set solely by physical sciences methods (such as magnetic alignment sequences, radiological criteria, etcetera.) as well as encouraging an international and open debate amongst Earth scientists in the paleontology, geology, geobiology and chronostratigraphy fields, among others. 

The International Commission on Stratigraphy has spawned numerous subcommittee level organizations organized and mobilized on a local country-wide or regional basis that are the true working committees of the IUGS, and these do the field work, basis comparisons in conference or co-ordination research committee meetings of local or wide-scale scope.

==Publications==
The ICS publishes various reports and findings as well as revised references periodically, summarized in the International Stratigraphic Chart, a combined &quot;working proposal&quot; and &quot;guideline-to-date&quot; released after the last ICS deliberations prior to the upcoming (next) meeting of the IUGS. Until the IUGS accepts the recommendations, they are unofficial since the IUGS parent approves or dismisses the individual deliberation reports of the ICS, which are presented as recommendations, and span dating and strata selection criteria, and related issues including nomenclatures. In &quot;de facto&quot; everyday matters, the deliberative results reported out of any meetings of the ICS are widely accepted and immediately enter everyday use, except in the rare cases where they result in a strong body of dissenting opinion, which matters are resolved before the full IUGS.

One such controversy arose in 2009 when the ICS deliberated and decided that the Pliocene Series of the current but unofficially named Quaternary Period should be shifted into the Neogene System and Neogene Period. Despite the strong debate, the Quaternary saw official ratification as a geological unit from the IUGS in June 2009, placing its lower boundary to the Gelasian Stage/Age at Monte San Nicola, Sicily, Italy (until then uppermost part of the Pliocene Series/Epoch, and thus of the Neogene System/Period), 2.58 Ma BP.

In addition to publishing paper and document (PDF) versions of the International Stratigraphic Chart, the ICS also provides a machine-readable version of the chart formulated using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and, in particular, Time Ontology in OWL. The ICS&#x27; chart web page also provides an interactive version of the chart, based on the OWL data.

==Logo==
The logo of International Commission on Stratigraphy was designed after the Chinese character of &quot;mountain&quot;, 山.

<doc id="876374" wikidata="Q241354" url="?curid=876374" title="Anastasiya Kapachinskaya">
<text>Anastasiya Alexandrovna Kapachinskaya (; born November 20, 1979) is a Russian former sprint athlete. She was the 2003 World champion in the 200 m. She was disqualified from competitions in 2004 and 2008 due to doping offences. As a result, the bulk of her athletics performances after 2004 have been annulled.

== Career ==
Kapachinskaya won the women&#x27;s 200 m at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics in Paris. The following year, she was initially awarded gold in the 200 m event at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Budapest but was stripped of the title after testing positive for the banned anabolic steroid stanozolol. She denied all knowledge of how it had happened, and during her two-year ban she vowed to work with the World Anti-Doping Agency to promote sports without drugs.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Kapachinskaya reached the 400 m final, where she placed fifth. She initially won silver in the 4 × 400 m relay. In 2009, she advanced to the 400 m final at the world championships and finished 6th. The Russian team which included Kapachinskaya initially achieved a bronze in the relay.

In May 2016, it was reported that Kapachinskaya was one of 14 Russian athletes, and nine medalists, implicated in doping following the retesting of urine from the 2008 Olympics. Kapachinskaya was named by Russian press agency TASS as having failed the retest, which was undertaken following the Russian doping scandal of 2015 and 2016. If confirmed, under IOC and IAAF rules, Kapachinskaya stood to lose all results, medals and records from the date of the original test to May 2016. As this would be a second doping offence, she would also face a lifetime ban from the sport. In August 2016, Kapachinskaya and her relay teammates were officially stripped of their 2008 silver medal. Kapachinskaya had tested positive for the steroids stanozol and turinabol. On 21 June 2017 it was reported that Kapachinskaya had forfeited all results and medals from 17 August 2008 onwards.

<text>Helsinki Arena (formerly Hartwall Arena) is a large multi-functional indoor arena located in Helsinki, Finland. It was opened in April 1997. The arena is convertible for various events. The total seated capacity during ice hockey games is 13,349 (about 14,000 for basketball, for concerts up to 15,000) and as an amphitheatre, it is significantly reduced to between 3,000 and 5,000.

The formerly Russian-owned arena has been unused since March 2022 due to EU sanctions related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The main sponsor, Hartwall, also ended its sponsorship and the arena&#x27;s name was changed. In February 2025, the sale of the facility to new owners was concluded, with the arena scheduled to re-open in April or May.

==Construction and facilities== 
The initiative for building the arena came from Harry &quot;Hjallis&quot; Harkimo in 1994. It was built to be ready for the Ice Hockey World Championships in 1997, and was delivered by the constructor on 11 April 1997. The building is elliptical, 153 metres long and 123 metres wide. It also has a practice arena 37 metres underground, used by many hockey teams. It is connected to a multi-storey carpark, which has a total capacity of 1,421 vehicles.

The arena is situated next to Pasila railway station, which is the second busiest railway station in Finland, 3.5 km north of the Helsinki Central railway station.

== Other and former names ==

The national broadcaster Yle calls the arena &quot;Helsingin areena&quot; or &quot;Helsingforsarenan&quot; (&quot;the Helsinki Arena&quot; in Finnish and Swedish). The newspaper &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; calls it &quot;Helsinki-areena&quot;.

It was branded as &quot;Hartwall Areena&quot; from its opening until 2014, and as &quot;Hartwall Arena&quot; thereafter until 2 March 2022. The beverage company Hartwall, also based in Helsinki, was its largest sponsor, and thus got the naming rights. Hartwall ended its sponsorship in March 2022, to avoid association with the then-Russian owners of the arena, Roman Rotenberg and Gennady Timchenko, in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In September 2024, the Finnish government announced that it would spend €200,000 on drafting a law that would allow the seizure of the arena from Rotenberg and Timchenko. That November, Rotenberg and Timchenko sold their ownership of the arena to Finnish real estate investment company Trevian, with its CEO Reima Södervall along with Heikki Viitikko planning to have the venue reopened by early 2025. In February 2025 the deal was finalised, with the facility scheduled to re-open in April or May.

== Events ==

=== Entertainment ===
=== Sports ===
The arena was the home venue of the ice hockey team Jokerit.

The arena has also been used for Ice Hockey World Championships, World Figure Skating Championships, NHL Challenge, and World Cup of Hockey. On 2 October 2009, the NHL opened its season in the arena with a matchup between the Chicago Blackhawks and the Florida Panthers, making it the first NHL game to be held in Finland. In May 2011, the arena served as the main venue of the 2012 IIHF World Championship. It hosted all Group A games and quarterfinals, all semifinals and the bronze and gold medal games. Group B games and quarterfinals were hosted in Ericsson Globe, Stockholm. It also co-hosted the 2013 IIHF World Championship with Ericsson Globe, but in 2013 all games after quarterfinals were played in Stockholm.

The arena was one of the host venues of the 2016 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Its assignment included hosting the gold-medal game, in which Kasperi Kapanen scored an Overtime goal to win Gold for Finland on home ice.

One of the group stages of EuroBasket 2017, was also played at the arena.

The arena hosted two 2018–19 regular season NHL games between the Winnipeg Jets and Florida Panthers on Thursday, 1 November 2018 and Friday, 2 November 2018 as part of the 2018 NHL Global Series.

<text>John Vianney (born Jean-Marie Vianney and later Jean-Marie-Baptiste Vianney; 8 May 1786 – 4 August 1859) was a French Catholic priest often referred to as the Curé d&#x27;Ars (&quot;the parish priest of Ars&quot;). He is known for his priestly and pastoral work in his parish in Ars, France, resulting in the radical spiritual transformation of the community and its surroundings. 

Catholics note his saintly life, mortification, persevering ministry in the sacrament of confession, and ardent devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. He was canonized in 1925 and his feast day is August 4. He is the patron saint of parish priests.

== Early life ==
Vianney was born on 8 May 1786, in the French town of Dardilly, France (near Lyon), and was baptized the same day. His parents, Matthieu Vianney and his wife Marie (Belize), had six children, of whom John was the fourth. The Vianneys were devout Catholics who helped the poor. Vianney&#x27;s paternal grandparents once hosted Benedict Joseph Labre, the patron saint of the homeless, who passed through Dardilly on his pilgrimage to Rome in 1770.

By 1790, the anticlerical Terror phase of the French Revolution forced many loyal priests to hide from the regime in order to carry out the sacraments in their parish. Even though to do so had been declared illegal, the Vianneys travelled to distant farms to attend Masses celebrated on the run. Realizing that such priests risked their lives day by day, Vianney began to look upon them as heroes. He received his First Communion catechetical instruction in a private home from two nuns whose communities had been dissolved during the Revolution. He made his first communion at the age of 13 in a neighbour&#x27;s kitchen; during the Mass, the windows were covered so that the light of the candles could not be seen from outside.

The Catholic Church was re-established in France in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte, resulting in religious peace throughout the country, culminating in a Concordat. By this time, Vianney was concerned about his future vocation and longed for an education. He was 20 when his father allowed him to leave the farm to be taught at a &quot;presbytery school&quot; in the neighbouring village of Écully, conducted by the Abbé Balley. The school taught arithmetic, history, geography and Latin. Vianney struggled with school, especially with Latin, since his past education had been interrupted by the French Revolution. Only because of Vianney&#x27;s deepest desire to be a priest—and Balley&#x27;s patience—did he persevere.

Vianney&#x27;s studies were interrupted in 1809 when he was drafted into Napoleon&#x27;s armies. He would have been exempt, as an ecclesiastical student, but Napoleon had withdrawn the exemption in certain dioceses because of his need for soldiers in his fight against Spain. Two days after he had to report at Lyons, he became ill and was hospitalized, during which time his draft left without him. Once released from the hospital, on 5 January, he was sent to Roanne for another draft. He went into a church to pray, and fell behind the group. He met a young man who volunteered to guide him back to his group, but instead led him deep into the Forez mountains, to the village of Les Noes, where deserters had gathered. Vianney lived there for fourteen months, hidden in the byre attached to a farmhouse, and under the care of Claudine Fayot, a widow with four children. He assumed the name Jerome Vincent, and under that name, he opened a school for village children. Since the harsh weather isolated the town during the winter, the deserters were safe from gendarmes. However, after the snow melted, gendarmes came to the town constantly, searching for deserters. During these searches, Vianney hid inside stacks of fermenting hay in Fayot&#x27;s barn.

An imperial proclamation in March 1810 granted amnesty to all deserters, enabling Vianney to go back legally to Écully, where he resumed his studies. He was tonsured in 1811, and in 1812 he went to the minor seminary at Verrières-en-Forez. In the autumn of 1813, he was sent to the major seminary at Lyons. Considered too slow, he was returned to Balley. However, Balley persuaded the vicar general that Vianney&#x27;s piety was great enough to compensate for his ignorance, and the seminarian received minor orders and the subdiaconate on 2 July 1814, was ordained a deacon in June 1815, and was ordained a priest on 12 August 1815 in the Couvent des Minimes de Grenoble. He said his first Mass the next day, and was appointed the assistant to Balley in Écully.

== Curé (priest) of Ars ==
In 1818, shortly after the death of Balley, Vianney was appointed parish priest of the parish of Ars, a town of 230 inhabitants. When Vianney&#x27;s bishop first assigned him to Ars, Vianney got lost trying to find the town. Two young men tending flocks in the fields pointed him in the right direction. 

With Catherine Lassagne and Benedicta Lardet, he established &quot;La Providence&quot;, a home for girls.

As parish priest, Vianney realized that the Revolution&#x27;s aftermath had resulted in religious ignorance and indifference, due to the devastation wrought on the Catholic Church in France. At the time, Sundays in rural areas were spent working in the fields, or dancing and drinking in taverns. Vianney spent time in the confessional and gave homilies against blasphemy and profane dancing. If his parishioners did not give up this dancing, he refused them absolution. His stern sermons were later collected together in the famous &quot;,&quot; along with his moral .

== Later years ==

Vianney came to be known internationally, and people from distant places began travelling to consult him as early as 1827. &quot;By 1855, the number of pilgrims had reached 20,000 a year. During the last ten years of his life, he spent 16 to 18 hours a day in the confessional. Even the bishop forbade him to attend the annual retreats of the diocesan clergy because of the souls awaiting him yonder&quot;. He spent at least 11 or 12 hours a day in the confessional during winter, and up to 16 in the summer.

In his article &quot;How does the Church Respond to Suicide?&quot; Shaun McAfee references an incident described in the book &quot;Cure of Ars:&quot; &quot;...a woman...told...Vianney that she was devastated because her husband had committed suicide. She wanted to approach the great priest but his line often lasted for hours and she could not reach him. She was ready to give up and in a moment of mystical insight that only a great saint can receive...Vianney exclaimed through the crowd, &quot;He is saved!” The woman was incredulous so the saint repeated, stressing each word, &quot;I tell you he is saved. He is in Purgatory, and you must pray for him. Between the parapet of the bridge and the water he had time to make an act of contrition.&quot;Vianney had a great devotion to Saint Philomena. He regarded her as his guardian and erected a chapel and shrine in honour of the saint. In May 1843, he felt so ill that he thought that his life was coming to an end. He attributed his cure to her intercession.

Vianney yearned for the contemplative life of a monk, and four times ran away from Ars, the last time in 1853. He was a champion of the poor as a Franciscan tertiary and was a recipient of the coveted French Legion of Honour.

== Death and veneration ==

On 4 August 1859, Vianney died at the age of 73. The bishop presided over his funeral with 300 priests and more than 6,000 people in attendance. Before he was entombed, Vianney&#x27;s body was fitted with a wax mask.
On 3 October 1874 Pope Pius IX proclaimed him &quot;venerable&quot;; on 8 January 1905, Pope Pius X declared him Blessed and proposed him as a model to the parochial clergy. In 1925 John Mary Vianney was canonized by Pope Pius XI, who in 1929 made him patron saint of parish priests. In 1928 his feast day was inserted into the General Roman Calendar for celebration on 9 August. Pope John XXIII&#x27;s 1960 revision, in which the Vigil of Saint Lawrence had a high rank, moved the feast to 8 August. Finally, the 1969 revision placed it on 4 August, the day of his death.

In 1959, to commemorate the centenary of John Vianney&#x27;s death, Pope John XXIII issued the encyclical letter &quot;Sacerdotii nostri primordia&quot;. John Paul II visited Ars in person in 1986 in connection with the bicentenary of Vianney&#x27;s birth and referred to him as a &quot;rare example of a pastor acutely aware of his responsibilities … and a sign of courage for those who today experience the grace of being called to the priesthood.&quot;

In honour of the 150th anniversary of Vianney&#x27;s death, Pope Benedict XVI declared a Year for Priests, running from the Feast of the Sacred Heart 2009–2010.

The Vatican Postal Service issued a set of stamps to commemorate the 150th Anniversary. With the following words on 16 June 2009, Benedict XVI officially marked the beginning of the year dedicated to priests, &quot;…On the forthcoming Solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, Friday 19 June 2009 – a day traditionally devoted to prayer for the sanctification of the clergy –, I have decided to inaugurate a ‘Year of the Priest’ in celebration of the 150th anniversary of the &quot;dies natalis&quot; of John Mary Vianney, the Patron Saint of parish priests worldwide...&quot;

Pope Benedict XVI declared 19 June 2009 – 19 June 2010 a Year for Priests to encourage priests to strive for spiritual perfection. In the Pope&#x27;s words the Curé d&#x27;Ars is &quot;a true example of a pastor at the service of Christ&#x27;s flock.&quot;

There are statues of Vianney in many French churches and in Catholic churches throughout the world. Also, many parishes founded in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are named after him. Some relics are kept in the Church of Notre-Dame de la Salette in Paris.

John Vianney is remembered in the Anglican Communion with a commemoration on 4 August.

== &quot;Heart of a Priest&quot; relic tour ==

In November 2018, Vianney&#x27;s heart was transported to the United States for a 6-month nationwide tour. As Joe Bollig explained in his article detailing the relic&#x27;s unexpected stop in Kansas City, &quot;The heart receives special veneration because in Scripture it is considered to be a person’s hidden centre of emotional, intellectual and moral activity. Saint John Vianney is said to have lived his life according to the heart of Christ and united his heart to Christ’s.&quot; By the end of the tour, &quot;the relic [had] travelled almost — almost one and a half times the circumference of the Earth — and was available for over 1,200 hours of public veneration.&quot;

The tour of the incorrupt heart of John Vianney came to the Parish of St. Catherine of Siena in Nichols, Connecticut, on April 29, 2019, with a liturgy celebrated by Daniel A. Cronin, Archbishop Emeritus of Hartford, and concelebrated by Joseph A. Marcello, pastor of St. Catherine of Siena. (Photos of the event available here.)

<text>The Audio Visuals were an unlicensed series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio dramas made by British fans in the 1980s.
Featuring Nicholas Briggs as the Doctor, twenty-eight audio plays were recorded and distributed on audio cassette between 1985 and 1991 (a pilot, in which the Doctor was voiced by Stephen Payne, was recorded at Chris Corney&#x27;s house in Hamble near Southampton in 1984).

The first three seasons (released 1985-1988) were produced by Bill Baggs, and the fourth and final season (1989–1991) by Gary Russell.

Although the Audio Visuals audios were a violation of copyright, the BBC chose to look the other way. Gary Russell later told an interviewer,
:&quot;We were fans doing some stuff for a handful of people. We never advertised in professional magazines, we kept ourselves to ourselves. In doing so, we broke every copyright rule in the book (hell, Terry Nation would have crucified us - although I think our Dalek stories knocked spots off Saward&#x27;s!) JNT was certainly aware of us, but he didn&#x27;t care. Why should he? We were no more than any other fan product and at least we weren&#x27;t printing articles about him or the show. I doubt Saward knew or cared. He wouldn&#x27;t know drama if it bit him.&quot;

Many of those involved in the Audio Visuals went on to work in more professional, licensed science fiction audio drama, either through BBV (founded by Bill Baggs) or through Big Finish Productions (which in 1999 began producing licensed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama under the guidance of Gary Russell). Nicholas Briggs has worked for both BBV and Big Finish as an actor and as a writer; he also worked on additional &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-related/inspired productions for Reeltime Pictures and, beginning in 2005, provided vocal work for the new &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series.

Several Audio Visuals scripts have been remade professionally, either by BBV (with the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; elements removed, as part of the video series &quot;The Stranger&quot;), Big Finish (as licensed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audios), or Arcbeatle Press (as licensed novels). The Big Finish audios which were adapted from Audio Visuals plays are &quot;The Mutant Phase&quot;, &quot;Sword of Orion&quot;, &quot;Minuet in Hell&quot; and the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; special releases &quot;Last of the Titans&quot; and &quot;Cuddlesome&quot;. Arcbeatle Press released an adaptation of &quot;Requiem&quot; as part of their &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off &quot;&quot;. 

Elements from various Audio Visuals plays also appear in Gary Russell&#x27;s contributions to the licensed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel ranges published by Virgin and the BBC, most notably in &quot;Deadfall&quot;. The Nicholas Briggs incarnation of the Doctor has also appeared in the &quot;DWM&quot; comic strip both as an unspecified future version, and the form taken by Shayde when posing as the Ninth Doctor.

<text>Ronald Ames Guidry (; born August 28, 1950), nicknamed &quot;Louisiana Lightning&quot; and &quot;Gator&quot;, is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees. Guidry was also the pitching coach of the Yankees from 2006 to 2007.

Guidry&#x27;s major league career began in 1975. He was a member of World Series-winning Yankees teams in 1977 and 1978, both over the Los Angeles Dodgers. He won the American League Cy Young Award in 1978, winning 25 games and losing only 3. He also won five Gold Glove Awards and appeared in four All-Star games. Guidry served as captain of the Yankees beginning in 1986; he retired from baseball in 1989. In 2003, the Yankees retired Guidry&#x27;s uniform number (49) and dedicated a plaque to him in Monument Park.

==Early life==
Ronald Ames Guidry was born to Roland and Mary Grace Guidry on August 28, 1950 in Lafayette, Louisiana. Guidry is of Cajun heritage.

==College career==
Guidry attended and pitched for the University of Southwestern Louisiana. He was a combined 12–5 with a 2.03 earned run average (ERA) and 137 strikeouts as a two-year letterman with the Ragin&#x27; Cajuns baseball team in 1969 and 1970.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
The New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB) selected Guidry in the third round, with the 67th overall pick, in the 1971 MLB draft.

===New York Yankees (1975–1988)===
After four seasons in the minor leagues, Guidry pitched briefly in the Major Leagues in the 1975 and 1976 seasons. He was nearly sent to the Baltimore Orioles as part of a trade deadline blockbuster on June 15, 1976, but the Yankees did not want to give up any more left-handed pitchers beyond the three (Scott McGregor, Tippy Martinez and Rudy May) that they had already included in the deal. The following year he was to have been dealt to Toronto for Bill Singer in a transaction that was approved by the Yankees but was vetoed by Blue Jays president Peter Bavasi.

In 1977, Guidry began the season as a relief pitcher but was moved into the Yankees&#x27; starting rotation. On April 30, he was called on to make an emergency start in replace of Mike Torrez, recently acquired in a trade from the Athletics, who had not joined the team in time for what was supposed to be his first start. In the longest outing Guidry could remember since his Eastern League days of 1974, he helped the Yankees beat the Seattle Mariners 3–0. Guidry finished the season with a 16–7 record. His emergence as a starter after his previous seasons in the bullpen made him one of the Yankees&#x27; biggest surprises in 1977. He helped lead the Yankees to a World Series championship.

In 1978, Guidry posted a career year that has been described as the all-time best season by a Yankees pitcher. Against the California Angels on June 17, he struck out a Yankee-record 18 batters. Guidry&#x27;s 18-strikeout performance is usually cited as the launching pad of the Yankee Stadium tradition of fans standing and clapping for a strikeout with two strikes on the opposing batter. For the season, Guidry went 25–3, setting the all-time mark for winning percentage by a pitcher with at least twenty wins. He led the league with a 1.74 ERA, an .893 winning percentage, nine shutouts, and 248 strikeouts. Guidry&#x27;s success in 1978 was due in large part to his mastery of the slider. His 248 strikeouts set a Yankees&#x27; franchise record for most strikeouts by a pitcher in a single season, a record that stood until 2022 when Gerrit Cole recorded 257 strikeouts.

Guidry&#x27;s 25th win of the 1978 regular season was his most significant, as it came in the Yankees&#x27; 5–4 win over the Boston Red Sox in a one-game playoff at Fenway Park in Boston to determine the American League East division winner. The game is best known for Bucky Dent&#x27;s seventh-inning, three-run home run that gave the Yankees a 3–2 lead. Later that month, the Yankees again won the World Series over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Guidry won the 1978 American League Cy Young Award unanimously. He also finished second in the American League Most Valuable Player voting to Boston Red Sox slugger Jim Rice. In addition, Guidry was named The Sporting News AL Pitcher and Major League Player of the Year. Had he not taken the loss in Toronto on September 20, when his record at the time was 22-2, he would have become the first (and to date, only), pitcher ever with at least a .900 winning percentage, and at least 20 wins in a season.

Guidry was named to the American League All-Star Team in 1978, 1979, 1982, and 1983. Known as an excellent fielder, Guidry won a Gold Glove each year from 1982 through 1986. In 1984, Guidry won the Roberto Clemente Award, given annually to the Major Leaguer who &quot;&#x27;best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual’s contribution to his team.&#x27;&quot;

On August 7, 1984, Guidry struck out three batters (Carlton Fisk, Tom Paciorek and Greg Luzinski) on nine pitches in the ninth inning of a 7–0 win over the Chicago White Sox. Guidry became the eighth American League pitcher and the 27th pitcher in major-league history to accomplish an immaculate inning. In 1985, he led the American League with 22 wins. Guidry and Willie Randolph were named co-captains of the Yankees on March 4, 1986.

The latter years of Guidry&#x27;s 14-year major league career were hindered by shoulder and elbow injuries. He retired from baseball on July 12, 1989.
Guidry&#x27;s number 49 was retired on August 23, 2003. The Yankees also dedicated a plaque to Guidry in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. The plaque calls Guidry &quot;a dominating pitcher&quot;, a &quot;respected leader&quot;, and &quot;a true Yankee.&quot; Each living Yankee previously honored with a plaque in Monument Park was on hand for the ceremony: Phil Rizzuto, Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford, Reggie Jackson and Don Mattingly.

==Coaching career==
===New York Yankees (2006–2007)===
Guidry joined Yankees manager Joe Torre&#x27;s coaching staff as pitching coach in the 2006 season, replacing Mel Stottlemyre. Guidry was criticized in 2007 because the Yankees&#x27; highly acclaimed pitching staff was underachieving. In 2007, Yankees pitchers walked the sixth-most batters overall in the Major Leagues; this was the most walks in a season for a Yankees pitching staff since 2000. Torre&#x27;s departure from the Yankees following the 2007 season ended Guidry&#x27;s tenure as pitching coach. Though he was interested in returning to the Yankees for the 2008 season, he was not offered a position on new manager Joe Girardi&#x27;s coaching staff. He did return to the Yankees as a spring training instructor.

Former &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Harvey Araton wrote a book called &quot;Driving Mr. Yogi: Yogi Berra, Ron Guidry, and Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Gift&quot; that profiles the friendship Guidry had with Yankees&#x27; Hall of Fame catcher (and Guidry&#x27;s former coach and manager) Yogi Berra.

==Personal life==

Guidry is married to Bonnie Rutledge Guidry; their wedding was on September 23, 1972. They have three children: two daughters, Jamie and Danielle, and a son, Brandon.

Guidry is a member of the Knights of Columbus.

<text>John Knoll (born October 6, 1962) is an American visual effects supervisor and chief creative officer (CCO) at Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM). One of the original creators of Adobe Photoshop (along with his brother, Thomas Knoll), he has also worked as visual effects supervisor on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels and the 1997 special editions of the original trilogy. He also served as ILM&#x27;s visual effects supervisor for &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, as well as the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; series. Along with Hal Hickel, Charles Gibson and Allen Hall, Knoll and the trio&#x27;s work on &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; earned them the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.

Knoll has been praised by directors James Cameron, Gore Verbinski, Guillermo del Toro, and Brad Bird. Del Toro, who worked with Knoll for the first time on &quot;Pacific Rim&quot;, stated &quot;He basically has the heart of a kid and the mind of a scientist, and that&#x27;s a great combination.&quot;

Knoll is also the inventor of Knoll Light Factory, a lens flare generating software inspired by his work at Industrial Light and Magic. He was the Computer Graphics Project Designer on &quot;The Abyss&quot;, an achievement which earned ILM its tenth Oscar, and worked on two &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes: &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;″s pilot episode (&quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;) and the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Explorers&quot;. 

Knoll had a cameo appearance in &quot;Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot; as a fighter pilot, helped pitch the story of &quot;Rogue One&quot;, a feature film set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series, for which he also worked as writer and executive producer.

John Knoll reflected on his work with George Lucas on the Star Wars prequel trilogy: &quot;I still feel like I owe George a lot to have been given that opportunity. On those three films, I feel like I got a whole career&#x27;s worth of experience packed into eight years. George never constricted his thinking to what he knew for sure the tools were capable of; his attitude was, &quot;Yeah, well, I&#x27;m writing what I want to see, so you guys will figure it out.&quot; I loved that he would constantly throw those challenges out with the confidence [that] you guys will figure it out. That was great.&quot;

In 2016, John Knoll and his brother Thomas were inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

At the 2019 Oscars, John and his brother Thomas were awarded a Scientific and Engineering Award for the original architecture, design and development of Photoshop.

<doc id="876408" wikidata="Q5413089" url="?curid=876408" title="Hjallis Harkimo">
<text>Harry Juhani &quot;Hjallis&quot; Harkimo (born 2 November 1953) is a Finnish businessman, sportsperson, and a member of the Finnish Parliament. Previously a National Coalition Party MP, he now chairs his own political party, Movement Now.

First elected to the Parliament in 2015 representing NCP, his tenure in the party was cut short following his complaints about leadership in 2018. He then proceeded to establish and register his new political movement simply as an association due to strong disdain toward traditional party politics. Following his successful re-election campaign in 2019, Harkimo decided to register Movement Now as a party afterall, explaining that &quot;the whole system was built so that thriving in it won&#x27;t be possible without having a party.&quot;

In the Parliament, Harkimo sits in opposition, although he voted in favor of swearing in the Rinne Cabinet. He later explained this by saying he wanted to give the government platform a chance, since he considered many of its goals positive. Since then, Harkimo and Movement Now have been more critical of the government, even by joining in on some joint opposition interpellations.

==Sailing==
In the 1981–82 season Harkimo was a crewmember on the yacht &quot;Skopbank of Finland&quot; in the Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race.

From 1986 to 1987 he participated in a round-the-world single-handed yacht race, BOC Challenge, and finished third.

In the 1989–90 season he was a crewmember on the yacht Belmont Finland in the Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race.

==Political career==
In 1988 Finnish presidential election, Harkimo was Harri Holkeri&#x27;s constituent.

Harkimo was elected to the Eduskunta in 2015 with 11,416 votes in the election. Although he was elected representing the National Coalition Party, in 2018 he left the party and founded a new political movement, Movement Now. In the 2019 parliamentary election, Harkimo was elected to the parliament as the sole representative from Movement Now.

Harkimo stated in late August 2020 that he was running for Mayor of Helsinki in 2021 Finnish municipal elections

===Presidential election 2024===
In 2022, Harkimo was nominated as the Movement Now candidate for the Finnish presidential election of 2024. In the election, he finished last with 0.5% of the votes.

==Business==

Harkimo was the chairman of the board of the Helsinki-based ice-hockey team Jokerit 1991–2019.

Hjallis had been dreaming of his own ice rink since 1994. At that time, the club was playing in the Helsinki Ice Hall together with HIFK, and Harkimo had understood that there would be no continuity in the operations of the Jokerit, if it continued in the same hall. He as a builder and developer of the team&#x27;s home arena, Hartwall Areena, and had been an investor in sports.

Harkimo shared a common interest with HJK. Hjallis bought the PK-35 and renamed the club FC Jokerit with the aim of attracting Jokerit hockey fans to the football audience as well. Harkimo had experience in stadium construction after leading the Hartwall Arena project, which was completed in 1997. Harkimo raised FIM 64 million in private funding, the City of Helsinki paid 32 million from the budget and the state 14 million, and so the new football stadium began to rise rapidly along Urheilukatu. Töölö football stadium was completed on 10 June 2000, just in time for the opening match between FC Jokerit and HJK. Eventually, HJK acquired the FC Jokerit football operations and formed the reserve team HJK Klubi 04 when, in March 2004, Hjallis Harkimo announced the closure of FC Jokerit.

Harkimo was a talk show hosted by &quot;With Hjallis&quot; on MTV3. In the program, Harkimo interviewed economic and political figures as well as other public figures.

The first production period of the program was presented from 27 January to 31 March 2011, the second from 8 March to 10 May 2012 and the third from 7 March to 9 May 2013. The fourth season, which was presented from 2 November to 21 December 2013 and the name was changed to &quot;Hjallis&quot;. Unlike in the fourth season, there are three guests instead of one. The fifth season of the series was shown from 26 September to 19 December 2014. The sixth production season began on 11 March 2016. In the sixth season, there are two guests in each episode.

In the 2012 presidential election, Harkimo supported the Coalition Party&#x27;s Sauli Niinistö campaign with 10,000 euros through Hjallis Promotion Oy.

Harkimo hosted the Finnish version of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; from 2009 until 2013. and made a one-season return in 2018.

In October 2017, Harkimo started to publish YouTube videos, discussing politics, business, sports and other subjects.

In 2019 Harkimo bought the 49% share of Jokerit from Russians Gennady Timchenko and Roman Rotenberg, the owners of Arena Events Oy. Harkimo then sold 100% of Jokerit to Jari Kurri, a long time manager of the club. Harkimo&#x27;s intent was to exclude the club from the US sanction list drawn upon the annexation of Crimea.

==Personal life==
Harkimo married his first wife, MP Leena Harkimo in 1989. The pair filed for divorce in 2002. He later married ex-MP Merikukka Forsius-Harkimo in 2004, but they divorced after only a year of marriage. Harkimo has two sons from his first marriage and a third from his second marriage. Harkimo has a younger brother, Roy, born in 1954.

Harkimo has been a vegetarian since the beginning of 2018.

<text>John Dennis Fitzgerald (February 3, 1906 – May 21, 1988) was an American author, most notable for &quot;The Great Brain&quot; series of children&#x27;s books.

== Biography ==
Fitzgerald was born in Price, Utah, the son of an Irish Catholic father and a Scandinavian Latter-day Saint mother. He had two older brothers, Thomas (the basis for the character known as the Great Brain) and William; two younger brothers, Charles and Gerald; and an older sister, Isabelle (known as &quot;Belle&quot;).

He left Utah in 1925 at the age of 18. He played in a jazz band and got a job in the newspaper business. He spent four years as a foreign correspondent and began to write short story fiction when he returned to the United States. Journalism work became increasingly difficult to find so he took a job as a purchasing agent at a steel company for economic stability while he continued to write. He found enough success that he quit the purchasing job to write full-time, having had over three hundred short stories published before 1950. Eventually, though, the market for short stories shrank so much that he took a job in a bank. 

Fitzgerald wrote his first novel with his sister, but she was not credited because the book was written in the first person. Titled &quot;Papa Married a Mormon&quot;, it was published in 1955 as a tribute to his mother who had passed away. It was serialized in McCall&#x27;s magazine and reprinted in several foreign languages, including German and Chinese. On the strength of this success, he quit his job and moved to a mountain cabin in Colorado to attempt a career at writing novels. Other about late nineteenth and early twentieth century Utah and written for an adult audience followed but he ended up moving to Denver and took a hiatus from creative writing for a short while. He published &quot;The Professional Story Writer and His Art&quot; in 1936 and one evening when friends dropped by, they all traded reminiscences of childhood. Fitzgerald&#x27;s tales of his brother&#x27;s exploits created such mirth that his wife suggested he publish them. Thus began his most well-known books, The Great Brain series, in which his characters are loosely based on people from his own family and community, including himself.

Fitzgerald published many stories in magazines and he co-wrote two textbooks about creative writing. Children&#x27;s books are seen as the more important of his writings.

<doc id="876428" wikidata="Q906520" url="?curid=876428" title="Divergent series">
<text>In mathematics, a divergent series is an infinite series that is not convergent, meaning that the infinite sequence of the partial sums of the series does not have a finite limit.

If a series converges, the individual terms of the series must approach zero. Thus any series in which the individual terms do not approach zero diverges. However, convergence is a stronger condition: not all series whose terms approach zero converge. A counterexample is the harmonic series

:formula_1

The divergence of the harmonic series was proven by the medieval mathematician Nicole Oresme.

In specialized mathematical contexts, values can be objectively assigned to certain series whose sequences of partial sums diverge, in order to make meaning of the divergence of the series. A &quot;summability method&quot; or &quot;summation method&quot; is a partial function from the set of series to values. For example, Cesàro summation assigns Grandi&#x27;s divergent series

:formula_2

the value . Cesàro summation is an &quot;averaging&quot; method, in that it relies on the arithmetic mean of the sequence of partial sums. Other methods involve analytic continuations of related series. In physics, there are a wide variety of summability methods; these are discussed in greater detail in the article on regularization.

==History==

Before the 19th century, divergent series were widely used by Leonhard Euler and others, but often led to confusing and contradictory results. A major problem was Euler&#x27;s idea that any divergent series should have a natural sum, without first defining what is meant by the sum of a divergent series. Augustin-Louis Cauchy eventually gave a rigorous definition of the sum of a (convergent) series, and for some time after this, divergent series were mostly excluded from mathematics. They reappeared in 1886 with Henri Poincaré&#x27;s work on asymptotic series. In 1890, Ernesto Cesàro realized that one could give a rigorous definition of the sum of some divergent series, and defined Cesàro summation. (This was not the first use of Cesàro summation, which was used implicitly by Ferdinand Georg Frobenius in 1880; Cesàro&#x27;s key contribution was not the discovery of this method, but his idea that one should give an explicit definition of the sum of a divergent series.) In the years after Cesàro&#x27;s paper, several other mathematicians gave other definitions of the sum of a divergent series, although these are not always compatible: different definitions can give different answers for the sum of the same divergent series; so, when talking about the sum of a divergent series, it is necessary to specify which summation method one is using.

==Examples==

* 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ⋯formula_3
* 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ⋯formula_4
* 1 − 1 + 2 − 6 + 24 − 120 + ⋯formula_5
* 1 − 2 + 4 − 8 + ⋯formula_6
* 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ⋯formula_7
* 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ⋯formula_8
* 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯formula_9

==Theorems on methods for summing divergent series==
A summability method &quot;M&quot; is &quot;regular&quot; if it agrees with the actual limit on all convergent series. Such a result is called an &quot;Abelian theorem&quot; for &quot;M&quot;, from the prototypical Abel&#x27;s theorem. More subtle, are partial converse results, called &quot;Tauberian theorems&quot;, from a prototype proved by Alfred Tauber. Here &quot;partial converse&quot; means that if &quot;M&quot; sums the series &quot;Σ&quot;, and some side-condition holds, then &quot;Σ&quot; was convergent in the first place; without any side-condition such a result would say that &quot;M&quot; only summed convergent series (making it useless as a summation method for divergent series).

The function giving the sum of a convergent series is &quot;linear&quot;, and it follows from the Hahn–Banach theorem that it may be extended to a summation method summing any series with bounded partial sums. This is called the &quot;Banach limit&quot;. This fact is not very useful in practice, since there are many such extensions, inconsistent with each other, and also since proving such operators exist requires invoking the axiom of choice or its equivalents, such as Zorn&#x27;s lemma. They are therefore nonconstructive.

The subject of divergent series, as a domain of mathematical analysis, is primarily concerned with explicit and natural techniques such as Abel summation, Cesàro summation and Borel summation, and their relationships. The advent of Wiener&#x27;s tauberian theorem marked an epoch in the subject, introducing unexpected connections to Banach algebra methods in Fourier analysis.

Summation of divergent series is also related to extrapolation methods and sequence transformations as numerical techniques. Examples of such techniques are Padé approximants, Levin-type sequence transformations, and order-dependent mappings related to renormalization techniques for large-order perturbation theory in quantum mechanics.

==Properties of summation methods==
Summation methods usually concentrate on the sequence of partial sums of the series. While this sequence does not converge, we may often find that when we take an average of larger and larger numbers of initial terms of the sequence, the average converges, and we can use this average instead of a limit to evaluate the sum of the series. A &quot;summation method&quot; can be seen as a function from a set of sequences of partial sums to values. If A is any summation method assigning values to a set of sequences, we may mechanically translate this to a &quot;series-summation method&quot; A&quot;Σ&quot; that assigns the same values to the corresponding series. There are certain properties it is desirable for these methods to possess if they are to arrive at values corresponding to limits and sums, respectively.

* Regularity. A summation method is &quot;regular&quot; if, whenever the sequence &quot;s&quot; converges to &quot;x&quot;, Equivalently, the corresponding series-summation method evaluates 
* Linearity. A is &quot;linear&quot; if it is a linear functional on the sequences where it is defined, so that for sequences &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot; and a real or complex scalar &quot;k&quot;. Since the terms of the series &quot;a&quot; are linear functionals on the sequence &quot;s&quot; and vice versa, this is equivalent to A&quot;Σ&quot; being a linear functional on the terms of the series.
* Stability (also called &quot;translativity&quot;). If &quot;s&quot; is a sequence starting from &quot;s&quot;0 and &quot;s&quot;′ is the sequence obtained by omitting the first value and subtracting it from the rest, so that , then A(&quot;s&quot;) is defined if and only if A(&quot;s&quot;′) is defined, and Equivalently, whenever for all &quot;n&quot;, then Another way of stating this is that the shift rule must be valid for the series that are summable by this method.

The third condition is less important, and some significant methods, such as Borel summation, do not possess it.

One can also give a weaker alternative to the last condition. 
* Finite re-indexability. If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot;′ are two series such that there exists a bijection formula_10 such that for all &quot;i&quot;, and if there exists some formula_11 such that for all &quot;i&quot; &gt; &quot;N&quot;, then (In other words, &quot;a&quot;′ is the same series as &quot;a&quot;, with only finitely many terms re-indexed.) This is a weaker condition than &quot;stability&quot;, because any summation method that exhibits &quot;stability&quot; also exhibits &quot;finite re-indexability&quot;, but the converse is not true.)

A desirable property for two distinct summation methods A and B to share is &quot;consistency&quot;: A and B are consistent if for every sequence &quot;s&quot; to which both assign a value, (Using this language, a summation method A is regular iff it is consistent with the standard sum Σ.) If two methods are consistent, and one sums more series than the other, the one summing more series is &quot;stronger&quot;.

There are powerful numerical summation methods that are neither regular nor linear, for instance nonlinear sequence transformations like Levin-type sequence transformations and Padé approximants, as well as the order-dependent mappings of perturbative series based on renormalization techniques.

Taking regularity, linearity and stability as axioms, it is possible to sum many divergent series by elementary algebraic manipulations. This partly explains why many different summation methods give the same answer for certain series.

For instance, whenever the geometric series
:formula_12
can be evaluated regardless of convergence. More rigorously, any summation method that possesses these properties and which assigns a finite value to the geometric series must assign this value. However, when &quot;r&quot; is a real number larger than 1, the partial sums increase without bound, and averaging methods assign a limit of infinity.

==Classical summation methods==

The two classical summation methods for series, ordinary convergence and absolute convergence, define the sum as a limit of certain partial sums. These are included only for completeness; strictly speaking they are not true summation methods for divergent series since, by definition, a series is divergent only if these methods do not work. Most but not all summation methods for divergent series extend these methods to a larger class of sequences.

===Absolute convergence===

Absolute convergence defines the sum of a sequence (or set) of numbers to be the limit of the net of all partial sums , if it exists. It does not depend on the order of the elements of the sequence, and a classical theorem says that a sequence is absolutely convergent if and only if the sequence of absolute values is convergent in the standard sense.

===Sum of a series===

Cauchy&#x27;s classical definition of the sum of a series defines the sum to be the limit of the sequence of partial sums . This is the default definition of convergence of a sequence.

==Nørlund means==
Suppose &quot;pn&quot; is a sequence of positive terms, starting from &quot;p&quot;0. Suppose also that
:formula_13
If now we transform a sequence s by using &quot;p&quot; to give weighted means, setting
:formula_14
then the limit of &quot;tn&quot; as &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity is an average called the &quot;Nørlund mean&quot; N&quot;p&quot;(&quot;s&quot;).

The Nørlund mean is regular, linear, and stable. Moreover, any two Nørlund means are consistent.

===Cesàro summation===

The most significant of the Nørlund means are the Cesàro sums. Here, if we define the sequence &quot;pk&quot; by
:formula_15
then the Cesàro sum &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot; is defined by Cesàro sums are Nørlund means if , and hence are regular, linear, stable, and consistent. &quot;C&quot;0 is ordinary summation, and &quot;C&quot;1 is ordinary Cesàro summation. Cesàro sums have the property that if then &quot;C&quot;&quot;h&quot; is stronger than &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;.

==Abelian means==
Suppose } is a strictly increasing sequence tending towards infinity, and that . Suppose
:formula_16
converges for all real numbers &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0. Then the &quot;Abelian mean&quot; &quot;A&quot;&quot;λ&quot; is defined as
:formula_17

More generally, if the series for &quot;f&quot; only converges for large &quot;x&quot; but can be analytically continued to all positive real &quot;x&quot;, then one can still define the sum of the divergent series by the limit above.

A series of this type is known as a generalized Dirichlet series; in applications to physics, this is known as the method of &quot;heat-kernel regularization&quot;.

Abelian means are regular and linear, but not stable and not always consistent between different choices of &quot;λ&quot;. However, some special cases are very important summation methods.

===Abel summation===

If , then we obtain the method of &quot;Abel summation&quot;. Here

:formula_18

where &quot;z&quot; = exp(−&quot;x&quot;). Then the limit of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) as &quot;x&quot; approaches 0 through positive reals is the limit of the power series for &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) as &quot;z&quot; approaches 1 from below through positive reals, and the Abel sum &quot;A&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is defined as

:formula_19

Abel summation is interesting in part because it is consistent with but more powerful than Cesàro summation: whenever the latter is defined. The Abel sum is therefore regular, linear, stable, and consistent with Cesàro summation.

===Lindelöf summation===
If , then (indexing from one) we have

:formula_20

Then &quot;L&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), the &quot;Lindelöf sum&quot;, is the limit of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) as &quot;x&quot; goes to positive zero. The Lindelöf sum is a powerful method when applied to power series among other applications, summing power series in the Mittag-Leffler star.

If &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is analytic in a disk around zero, and hence has a Maclaurin series &quot;G&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) with a positive radius of convergence, then in the Mittag-Leffler star. Moreover, convergence to &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is uniform on compact subsets of the star.

==Analytic continuation==

Several summation methods involve taking the value of an analytic continuation of a function.

===Analytic continuation of power series===

If Σ&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; converges for small complex &quot;x&quot; and can be analytically continued along some path from &quot;x&quot; = 0 to the point &quot;x&quot; = 1, then the sum of the series can be defined to be the value at &quot;x&quot; = 1. This value may depend on the choice of path. One of the first examples of potentially different sums for a divergent series, using analytic continuation, was given by Callet, who observed that if formula_21 then

formula_22

Evaluating at formula_23, one gets

formula_24

However, the gaps in the series are key. For formula_25 for example, we actually would get

formula_26, so different sums correspond to different placements of the formula_27&#x27;s.

Another example of analytic continuation is the divergent alternating series
formula_28
which is a sum over products of formula_29-functions and Pochhammer&#x27;s symbols. Using the
duplication formula of the formula_29-function, it reduces to
a generalized hypergeometric series
formula_31

===Euler summation===
Euler summation is essentially an explicit form of analytic continuation. If a power series converges for small complex &quot;z&quot; and can be analytically continued to the open disk with diameter from to 1 and is continuous at 1, then its value at &quot;q&quot; is called the Euler or (E,&quot;q&quot;) sum of the series Σ&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Euler used it before analytic continuation was defined in general, and gave explicit formulas for the power series of the analytic continuation.

The operation of Euler summation can be repeated several times, and this is essentially equivalent to taking an analytic continuation of a power series to the point &quot;z&quot; = 1.

===Analytic continuation of Dirichlet series===

This method defines the sum of a series to be the value of the analytic continuation of the Dirichlet series

:formula_32
at &quot;s&quot; = 0, if this exists and is unique. This method is sometimes confused with zeta function regularization.

If &quot;s&quot; = 0 is an isolated singularity, the sum is defined by the constant term of the Laurent series expansion.

===Zeta function regularization===
If the series

:formula_33

(for positive values of the &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;) converges for large real &quot;s&quot; and can be analytically continued along the real line to &quot;s&quot; = −1, then its value at &quot;s&quot; = −1 is called the zeta regularized sum of the series &quot;a&quot;1 + &quot;a&quot;2 + ... Zeta function regularization is nonlinear. In applications, the numbers &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; are sometimes the eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator &quot;A&quot; with compact resolvent, and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is then the trace of &quot;A&quot;−&quot;s&quot;. For example, if &quot;A&quot; has eigenvalues 1, 2, 3, ... then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is the Riemann zeta function, &quot;ζ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), whose value at &quot;s&quot; = −1 is −, assigning a value to the divergent series . Other values of &quot;s&quot; can also be used to assign values for the divergent sums , and in general
:formula_34
where &quot;Bk&quot; is a Bernoulli number.

==Integral function means==
If &quot;J&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = Σ&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; is an integral function, then the &quot;J&quot; sum of the series &quot;a&quot;0 + ... is defined to be
:formula_35
if this limit exists.

There is a variation of this method where the series for &quot;J&quot; has a finite radius of convergence &quot;r&quot; and diverges at &quot;x&quot; = &quot;r&quot;. In this case one defines the sum as above, except taking the limit as &quot;x&quot; tends to &quot;r&quot; rather than infinity.

===Borel summation===
In the special case when &quot;J&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;e&quot;&quot;x&quot; this gives one (weak) form of Borel summation.

===Valiron&#x27;s method===
Valiron&#x27;s method is a generalization of Borel summation to certain more general integral functions &quot;J&quot;. Valiron showed that under certain conditions it is equivalent to defining the sum of a series as 
:formula_36
where &quot;H&quot; is the second derivative of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;c&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;e&quot;−&quot;G&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), and &quot;a&quot;0 + ... + &quot;a&quot;&quot;h&quot; is to be interpreted as 0 when &quot;h&quot; &lt; 0.

==Moment methods==

Suppose that &quot;dμ&quot; is a measure on the real line such that all the moments

: formula_37

are finite. If &quot;a&quot;0 + &quot;a&quot;1 + ... is a series such that

:formula_38

converges for all &quot;x&quot; in the support of &quot;μ&quot;, then the (&quot;dμ&quot;) sum of the series is defined to be the value of the integral

: formula_39

if it is defined. (If the numbers &quot;μ&quot;&quot;n&quot; increase too rapidly then they do not uniquely determine the measure &quot;μ&quot;.)

===Borel summation===
For example, if &quot;dμ&quot; = &quot;e&quot;−&quot;x&quot; &quot;dx&quot; for positive &quot;x&quot; and 0 for negative &quot;x&quot; then &quot;μ&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;n&quot;!, and this gives one version of Borel summation, where the value of a sum is given by 
:formula_40

There is a generalization of this depending on a variable &quot;α&quot;, called the (B′,&quot;α&quot;) sum, where the sum of a series &quot;a&quot;0 + ... is defined to be

: formula_41

if this integral exists. A further generalization is to replace the sum under the integral by its analytic continuation from small &quot;t&quot;.

==Miscellaneous methods==

===BGN hyperreal summation===

This summation method works by using an extension to the real numbers known as the hyperreal numbers. Since the hyperreal numbers include distinct infinite values, these numbers can be used to represent the values of divergent series. The key method is to designate a particular infinite value that is being summed, usually formula_42, which is used as a unit of infinity. Instead of summing to an arbitrary infinity (as is typically done with formula_43), the BGN method sums to the specific hyperreal infinite value labeled formula_42. Therefore, the summations are of the form

:formula_45

This allows the usage of standard formulas for finite series such as arithmetic progressions in an infinite context. For instance, using this method, the sum of the progression formula_46 is formula_47, or, using just the most significant infinite hyperreal part, formula_48.

===Hausdorff transformations===

===Hölder summation===

===Hutton&#x27;s method===

In 1812 Hutton introduced a method of summing divergent series by starting with the sequence of partial sums, and repeatedly applying the operation of replacing a sequence &quot;s&quot;0, &quot;s&quot;1, ... by the sequence of averages , , ..., and then taking the limit.

===Ingham summability===

The series &quot;a&quot;1 + ... is called Ingham summable to &quot;s&quot; if

: formula_49

Albert Ingham showed that if &quot;δ&quot; is any positive number then (C,−&quot;δ&quot;) (Cesàro) summability implies Ingham summability, and Ingham summability implies (C,&quot;δ&quot;) summability.

===Lambert summability===

The series &quot;a&quot;1 + ... is called Lambert summable to &quot;s&quot; if
:formula_50

If a series is (C,&quot;k&quot;) (Cesàro) summable for any &quot;k&quot; then it is Lambert summable to the same value, and if a series is Lambert summable then it is Abel summable to the same value.

===Le Roy summation===

The series &quot;a&quot;0 + ... is called Le Roy summable to &quot;s&quot; if

: formula_51

===Mittag-Leffler summation===
The series &quot;a&quot;0 + ... is called Mittag-Leffler (M) summable to &quot;s&quot; if
:formula_52

===Ramanujan summation===
Ramanujan summation is a method of assigning a value to divergent series used by Ramanujan and based on the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula. The Ramanujan sum of a series &quot;f&quot;(0) + &quot;f&quot;(1) + ... depends not only on the values of &quot;f&quot; at integers, but also on values of the function &quot;f&quot; at non-integral points, so it is not really a summation method in the sense of this article.

===Riemann summability===

The series &quot;a&quot;1 + ... is called (R,&quot;k&quot;) (or Riemann) summable to &quot;s&quot; if

: formula_53

The series &quot;a&quot;1 + ... is called R2 summable to &quot;s&quot; if

: formula_54

===Riesz means===

If &quot;λ&quot;&quot;n&quot; form an increasing sequence of real numbers and

: formula_55

then the Riesz (R,&quot;λ&quot;,&quot;κ&quot;) sum of the series &quot;a&quot;0 + ... is defined to be

: formula_56

===Vallée-Poussin summability===
The series &quot;a&quot;1 + ... is called VP (or Vallée-Poussin) summable to &quot;s&quot; if

: formula_57
where formula_58 is the gamma function.

===Zeldovich summability===

The series is Zeldovich summable if

:formula_59

<text>The Melisende Psalter (London, British Library, Egerton MS 1139) is an illuminated manuscript commissioned around 1135 in the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, probably by King Fulk for his wife Queen Melisende. It is a notable example of Crusader art, which resulted from a merging of the artistic styles of Roman Catholic Europe, the Eastern Orthodox Byzantine Empire and the art of the Armenian illuminated manuscript.

Seven scribes and illuminators, working in the scriptorium built by the crusaders in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, were involved in the creation of the psalter. It measures 21.6 centimetres by 14 centimetres.

This manuscript forms part of the Egerton Collection in the British Library in London.

==The New Testament cycle==

The first twenty-four illustrations, on each side of the first twelve folios, depict scenes from the New Testament. New Testament images were commonly found at the beginning of western psalters, unlike in eastern psalters. In this case, the images depict scenes more common in the Eastern Orthodox liturgy. 

The scenes depicted are the Annunciation, Visitation, the Nativity, the Adoration of the Magi, the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, the Baptism of Jesus, the Temptation of Christ, the Transfiguration, the Raising of Lazarus, the triumphal entry into Jerusalem (see illustration), the Last Supper, the Washing of the Feet, the Agony in the Garden, the Betrayal of Judas, the Crucifixion of Jesus, the Descent from the Cross, the Lamentation, the Harrowing of Hell, the Three Marys at the Tomb, and the Deesis.

These illustrations were made by an illuminator named Basilius, who signed the last illustration (pictured above) (Latin for &quot;Basilius made me&quot;), and is the only named illuminator or scribe of this manuscript. Nothing is known about Basilius. Because of his Greek name it has been suggested that he was a Byzantine artist. It is also possible that he was a western artist who had been trained in a Greek style, maybe in Constantinople. Or, he may have been an Armenian Catholic, familiar with both Catholic and Orthodox traditions.
==The calendar==

Folios 13-21 contain the calendar, which is strikingly similar to psalter calendars produced in England in the same period. It appears to be based on a calendar of St. Swithun&#x27;s church in Winchester. The calendar is filled with English saint days rather than those more popular in Jerusalem. One name, St. Martin of Tours, a saint popular throughout Europe, is written in gold, for unknown reasons. 

Three crusader-specific dates are mentioned in the calendar: the capture of Jerusalem on July 15, the death of Baldwin II on August 21, and the death of his wife Morphia on October 1. Each month has a medallion with a sign of the Zodiac, illustrated in a Romanesque style with heavy Islamic influences.

==The psalter==

Folios 22-196 contain the Latin psalms written in a northern French script. A third illuminator painted the initial letters of each psalm. Some initials take up the entire side of a leaf, and are drawn with gold lettering on a purple background. They show influence from Italian and Islamic art, possibly suggesting that the artist was trained in Muslim-influenced southern Italy.

==Prayers to the saints==
The scribe who wrote the psalms also wrote a series of prayers on folios 197–211, dedicated to nine saints: the Virgin Mary, St. Michael, St. John the Baptist, St. Peter, St. John the Evangelist, St. Stephen, St. Nicholas, St. Mary Magdalene, and St. Agnes. The prayers are accompanied by paintings of the saints by a fourth illuminator trained in a Romanesque style. His technique also shows an attempt to incorporate a Byzantine style. There are a few blank and undecorated spaces in this section of the psalter, and it may be incomplete.

==The covers==

The ivory covers, decorated with some small turquoise beads, show scenes from the life of King David and from the &quot;Psychomachia&quot; of Prudentius on the front side, and another king performing the six works of mercy from the Gospel of Matthew on the back side, both showing influence from Byzantine, Islamic, and western art. The geometric designs on the covers are especially influenced by Islamic art.

The king on the back side is dressed in Byzantine imperial clothes, but most likely represents a crusader king, perhaps Fulk. There is a carving of a falcon above him, which is possibly a clue that the king is Fulk, as &quot;falcon&quot; and &quot;Fulk&quot; in Old French were both &quot;Fouque&quot;. Another bird name, , was possibly also implied here as a pun on the king&#x27;s name.
Underneath the falcon, the word is carved, Latin for gyrfalcon. The artist has not signed in the same way Basilius has.

The spine of the psalter is decorated with Byzantine silk and silver thread, as well as red, blue, and green Greek crosses, which are found in the royal arms of the kingdom. The spine was stitched by an artisan who was perhaps a westerner trained in a Byzantine style, as his stitching is not as smooth as other examples of Byzantine silk spines made by native Greeks.

==Date and recipient==
The exact date of the psalter, and for whom it was made, is unknown, although it is obviously made for a noblewoman of the kingdom, based on the use of Byzantine styles, considered to be aristocratic by the crusaders, the depictions of kings, and the use of feminine word endings in the Latin prayers. Through circumstantial evidence, Queen Melisende can probably be identified as the recipient. The English influence in the calendar and elsewhere likely comes from King Fulk, who was related to the English royal family by marriage. 

It is also notable that aside from the capture of Jerusalem, the only crusader-specific dates in the calendar are the deaths of Melisende&#x27;s parents, King Baldwin II and Queen Morphia. The mixture of Catholic and Orthodox elements in the psalter may reflect Melisende&#x27;s mixed upbringing. Her father, Baldwin, was Catholic and her mother, Morphia, was an Armenian of the Greek Orthodox faith.

If Melisende was the recipient, then the psalter was most likely commissioned by Fulk, probably around 1135. Prior to this, Fulk and Melisende had been fighting for superiority in the kingdom, and Melisende had allied with rebels against Fulk. By 1134 they had reconciled, and the psalter had to have been written after 1131, the date of Baldwin II&#x27;s death. On the other hand, it could have been written anytime before Melisende&#x27;s death in 1161. Palaeographical comparisons to other texts produced in Jerusalem suggest it was written in the 1140s or even 50s, but the later texts may have used the Melisende Psalter as a source.

The manuscript was perhaps owned by Grande Chartreuse, Grenoble, in the early 19th century. By about 1840 it was owned by Ambroise Comarmond, director of the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon. Its next owner was Guglielmo Libri (b. 1802, d. 1869), who is most famous for stealing medieval manuscripts from French public libraries. He sold it to the London bookdealers Payne and Foss, who sold to the British Museum in November 1845.

==In popular culture==
In the historical grand strategy simulation game, &quot;Crusader Kings III&quot;, the Melisende Psalter is an object the ruler can collect if their spouse or lover is cheating on them, as a reference to Fulk&#x27;s attempt to win back Melisende&#x27;s favor with the gift during her affair with Hugh II of Jaffa. It is called &#x27;The Psalter of Cuckoldry&#x27;, with a description of the detailing of the ivory front and its turquoise beads to define the object as the Melisende Psalter.

<doc id="876434" wikidata="Q3815064" url="?curid=876434" title="Kick Off (series)">
<text>The Kick Off franchise is a series of football simulation video games created by Dino Dini. &quot;Kick Off&quot; was published by Anil Gupta&#x27;s publishing house Anco Software for the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga. First released in 1989, &quot;Kick Off&quot; was well-received and won awards.

After the release of &quot;Kick Off&quot; several sequels were released. &quot;Player Manager&quot; was released in 1990. The game was the first game to combine a management environment (including tactics, league play, transfers, and detailed player attributes) with a football game engine (based on that of &quot;Kick Off&quot;). &quot;Kick Off 2&quot; was released in 1990 as a sequel to &quot;Kick Off&quot;. The game introduced a number of new features as well as several small alterations.

In 1992, Dino Dini left Anco and signed a contract for Virgin Games, which released &quot;Goal!&quot; in 1993. Anco released several further editions of the &quot;Kick Off&quot; series between 1994 and 1997, but these games had little in common with &quot;Kick Off&quot; and &quot;Kick Off 2&quot;. In 2001–2003, the KOA collaborated closely with Anco developer Steve Screech in an attempt to relaunch the &quot;Kick Off&quot; and &quot;Player Manager&quot; series. &quot;Kick Off 2002&quot; was released. Anco started to work on another sequel &quot;Kick Off 2004&quot; which reached beta status. The attempt came to a halt when Anco closed in 2003.

==History==
&quot;Kick Off&quot; was released in 1989. &quot;Kick Off&quot; was first developed for the Atari ST and then ported to the Amiga. Several expansion disks were released for &quot;Kick Off 2&quot;. In 1992, Dino Dini left Anco and signed a contract for Virgin Games, which released &quot;Goal!&quot; in 1993. Anco released &quot;Kick Off 3&quot; in 1994. The game used a side view instead of a top-down view and bore little resemblance to &quot;Kick Off 2&quot; apart from the name. Anco Software published the first versions of &quot;Kick Off&quot; for the Amiga and Atari ST.

==Gameplay==

With &quot;Kick Off&quot; the ball did not stick to the player&#x27;s feet but instead was realistically kicked ahead from the players, in a manner similar to that of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Soccer&quot;, released in 1985 on the NES. This added a degree of difficulty and skill requirement at the same time. Other attributes, such as action replays, players with different characteristics, different tactics, fouls, yellow cards, red cards, injuries, injury time and various referees with different moods are also featured.

==Reception==
* &quot;ST Action&quot; – Highest accolade they could give.
* &quot;Amiga User Int&quot; – &quot;Best computer game ever&quot; 97%

* &quot;Commodore User&quot; – &quot;No other footy game can touch it&quot; 90%
* &quot;Amiga Action&quot; – &quot;Surpasses all other football games&quot; 93%
* &quot;PCW&quot; - &quot;Nothing short of brilliant&quot;
* &quot;New Comp Express&quot; – &quot;Computer football event of the year&quot;

==Sequels==
===&quot;Player Manager&quot;===
===&quot;Kick Off 2&quot;===
In 1990, &quot;Kick Off 2&quot; was released by Anco. &quot;Kick Off 2&quot; retains the pace and accuracy of &quot;Kick Off&quot;, with a full size multi directional scrolling pitch and the players, markings, goals etc., in correct proportions. Both teams play the game strictly according to tactics. Players move into position to receive passes and gain possession. The ball, as in real game, travels ahead of the player.

There is a league and a cup tournament with sudden death penalty shoot outs, in case of a draw. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but with different styles of play and the player skills to match, that style. There is an option to load player&#x27;s team from &quot;Player Manager&quot; along with player&#x27;s tactics, to play against another team in a single game or enter league and cup tournament.

The special events selection in the main menu allows data disks to be loaded. &quot;Kick Off 2&quot; also provides the facility to change strip colours and on expanded Atari ST&#x27;s (1 MB or above) there are additional sound effects. The &quot;Action Replay&quot; facility allows goals to be viewed at normal pace or in &quot;Slow Motion&quot; and saved to disk. There are 24 referees and have their own distinctive temperaments.

===&quot;Super Kick Off&quot;===
&quot;Super Kick Off&quot; is one of the follow-ups of &quot;Kick Off&quot; and &quot;Kick Off 2&quot; for the Master System, Game Boy, Mega Drive, and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. &quot;Super Kick Off&quot; was slower than the original games. The Mega Drive version knocked &quot;PGA Tour Golf II&quot; from the top of the charts. &quot;MegaTech&quot; gave the game 94% and a Hyper Game Award, saying that the &quot;feel and playability is unrivalled by any other footy game so far&quot;, but criticising the high price of £45.

===&quot;Goal!&quot;===

In 1992, a sequel, &quot;Kick Off 3&quot;, was in development. The game wasn&#x27;t released in this form though, as Dino Dini left Anco in 1992 for Virgin Games, where he developed &quot;Goal!&quot;, released in 1993. &quot;Goal!&quot; featured similar gameplay to &quot;Kick Off 2&quot; but also added one-touch passing as seen in &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot;, player acceleration, and more advanced menu systems and options. &quot;Goal!&quot; received generally good reviews but did not enjoy the same lasting popularity as &quot;Kick Off 2&quot;.

===&quot;Kick Off 3&quot; ===
In 1994, Anco released &quot;Kick Off 3&quot; developed by Steve Screech, a totally new game with nothing in common with &quot;Kick Off 2&quot;. The game didn&#x27;t receive as good reviews as its predecessors and didn&#x27;t gain the same popularity. An Atari Jaguar port was in development but never released.

====&quot;Kick Off 96, 97 &amp; 98&quot;====
In 1996, Toka Nono released &quot;Kick Off 96&quot; for Amiga and Windows. The game received average reviews. In 1997, &quot;Kick Off 97&quot; was released for Windows. The game received better reviews than &quot;Kick Off 96&quot; but still didn&#x27;t become popular. Later the same year, Anco released &quot;Kick Off 98&quot; for the PC which received poor reviews. In 1998 &quot;Kick Off World&quot; was released for the original PlayStation, again developed by Toka and published by Funsoft.

===&quot;Kick Off 2002&quot;===
In 2001, Steve Screech started a project called &quot;Ultimate Kick Off&quot; with the help of an early established Kick Off Association. The game was built using the Gamebryo engine, released by Anco in 2002 for PC and Mac with the name &quot;Kick Off 2002&quot;. The game received poor reviews and only sold 5000 copies. Later a sequel called &quot;Kick Off 2004&quot; was planned. It reached beta status but was never released. The project ended when Anco closed in 2003.

===&quot;Kick Off Revival&quot;===
A new entry in the series, with a control system designed for the use with an analog stick, &quot;Kick Off Revival&quot;, was released in June 2016 for PlayStation 4 with poor reviews from the main game websites. PlayStation Vita version was released nine months later in 2017 with bad reviews. A PC version is available on Steam.

<text>229 (two hundred [and] twenty-nine) is the natural number following 228 and preceding 230.

== In mathematics ==
It is the fiftieth prime number, and a regular prime.
It is also a full reptend prime, meaning that the decimal expansion of the unit fraction 1/229 repeats periodically with as long a period as possible.
With 227 it is the larger of a pair of twin primes,
and it is also the start of a sequence of three consecutive squarefree numbers. It is the smallest prime that, when added to the reverse of its decimal representation, yields another prime: 229 + 922 = 1151.

There are 229 cyclic permutations of the numbers from 1 to 7 in which none of the numbers is mapped to its successor (mod 7),
229 rooted tree structures formed from nine carbon atoms,
and 229 triangulations of a polygon formed by adding three vertices to each side of a triangle.
There are also 229 different projective configurations of type (123123), in which twelve points and twelve lines meet with three lines through each of the points and three points on each of the lines, all of which may be realized by straight lines in the Euclidean plane.

The complete graph &quot;K&quot;13 has 229 crossings in its straight-line drawing with the fewest possible crossings.

<text>The , also known as MEXT, is one of the eleven ministries of Japan that compose part of the executive branch of the government of Japan.

== History ==
The Meiji government created the first Ministry of Education in 1871. In January 2001, the former Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture and the former merged to become the present MEXT.

== Organization ==
The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology currently is led by the minister of education, culture, sports, science and technology. Under that position is two state ministers, two parliamentary vice-ministers, and administrative vice-minister, and two deputy ministers. Beyond that the organization is divided as follows.

=== Minister&#x27;s Secretariat ===
The Minister&#x27;s Secretariat is the department that manages general policies that affect the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology as a whole. These functions include many administrative jobs such as auditing policies, community relations, and overall human resource management for domestic and international relations alike.

=== Director-General for International Affairs ===
The Director-General for International Affairs, according to Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology&#x27;s site, is the main point of contact between Japan&#x27;s National Commission and United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The collective goal of the two organizations is to create mutual, sustainable development through education, science, and culture.

=== Department of Facilities Planning and Disaster Prevention ===
The Department of Facilities Planning and Disaster Prevention is in charge of focusing on the ability of school facilities to reduce damage caused by disasters such as earthquakes. On top of this, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology&#x27;s site, also describes part of their duties as promoting universities&#x27; endeavors in educational and research activities.

== Education departments ==

These are the segments of the ministry with focus on the education portions of organization.

=== Education Policy Bureau ===
The Education Policy Bureau as a department upholds the concept of lifelong learning, introduced in the Basic Act on Education. Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology describes this department&#x27;s duties as designing educational policy based on comprehensive and objective evidence.

=== Elementary and Secondary Education Bureau ===
The Elementary and Secondary Education Bureau is in charge of enhancing the educational development of students progressing through preschool to upper secondary schools, or any equivalent.

=== Higher Education Bureau ===
The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology describes the Higher Education Bureau as a department that focuses on promoting the education of undergraduate and graduate schools. This includes overseeing permission of grants, teacher quality, as well as the selection and admission of both domestic and abroad students.

== Sports and culture departments ==

These are the segments of the ministry with focus on the sports and culture portions of organization.

=== Japan Sports Agency ===
The Japan Sports Agency is tasked with the promotion of physical education and health, as well as maintaining the country&#x27;s ability to compete in international athletics.

=== Agency for Cultural Affairs ===

The Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs tries to create a culture in the country that encourages participation in cultural activities and the arts. Their goal is to achieve a &quot;Nation Based on Culture and Art&quot;.

== Science and technology departments ==
These are the segments of the ministry with focus on the science and technology portions of organization.

=== Science and Technology Policy Bureau ===

The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology&#x27;s site regards the duties of the Science and Technology Policy Bureau as the department in charge of the promotion of science and technology in the country. The scope of the department includes students as well as established professionals.

=== Research Promotion Bureau ===
The Research Promotion Bureau is a department that focuses on development of scientific research, as well as research in fields including technology and physics.

=== Research and Development Bureau ===
The Research and Development Bureau is slightly different from the Research Promotion Bureau as this department focuses on social problems including energy and the environment. Consequentially, this department would focus on exploration in space and deep sea.

== Activities and funded research ==
While the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology currently contains multiple agencies, primarily a congregation of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, it actually began as the Ministry of Education. Over the years, Japan separately created each of the agencies that would eventually combine to make the current organization. Nonetheless, each department of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology researches programs and institutions to fund.

=== Educational research ===
The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, were able to get their funding increased successfully through the years. They did so with the aid of one of their subgroups, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. The additional funds were likely aided in approval due to their source coming from national bonds rather than taxes. The programs, funded by the increased budget, include projects in new materials, molecular-scale surface dynamics, next-generation process technology, computer science, synthesis-based chemical engineering science, micro-mechatronics (micromachinery), biotechnology, human genome research, cell signaling, bioinformatics, brain research, Structural biology, life sciences, developmental biology, and biomedical engineering.

==Educational programs==
MEXT is one of three ministries that run the JET Programme. It also offers the Monbukagakusho Scholarship, also known as the MEXT or Monbu-shō scholarship. The Ministry sets standards for the romanization of Japanese.

In cooperation with the Japanese Student Services Organization (JASSO), the ministry further funds the prestigious JASSO scholarship for international students which has been described as the &quot;Japanese Fulbright program&quot;. It offers financial support of up to ¥80,000 per month for the top 1% of students of any foreign country for studies at a Japanese university.

MEXT provides the Children Living Abroad and Returnees Internet (CLARINET) which provides information to Japanese families living abroad.

MEXT sends teachers around the world to serve in &quot;nihonjin gakkō&quot;, full-time Japanese international schools in foreign countries. The Japanese government also sends full-time teachers to &quot;hoshū jugyō kō&quot; supplementary schools that offer lessons that are similar to those of &quot;nihonjin gakkō&quot; or those which each have student bodies of 100 students or greater. In addition, MEXT subsidizes weekend schools which each have over 100 students.

Japanese Government MEXT scholarship 2022 Japanese Government MEXT Scholarship 2021 Embassy Recommendation. The scholarship programs are for students who wish to study in Japan as Research Student (Masters/Ph.D./ Research), Undergraduate student, College of Technology student, or Specialized Training student.

<text>Academic study of Jewish mysticism, especially since Gershom Scholem&#x27;s &quot;Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism&quot; (1941), draws distinctions between different forms of mysticism which were practiced in different eras of Jewish history. Of these, Kabbalah, which emerged in 12th-century southwestern Europe, is the most well known, but it is not the only typological form, nor was it the first form which emerged. Among the previous forms were Merkabah mysticism (c. 100 BCE – 1000 CE), and Ashkenazi Hasidim (early 13th century) around the time of the emergence of Kabbalah.

Kabbalah means &quot;received tradition&quot;, a term which was previously used in other Judaic contexts, but the Medieval Kabbalists adopted it as a term for their own doctrine in order to express the belief that they were not innovating, but were merely revealing the ancient hidden esoteric tradition of the Torah. This issue has been crystalized until today by alternative views on the origin of the Zohar, the main text of Kabbalah, attributed to the circle of its central protagonist Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai in the 2nd century CE, for opening up the study of Jewish Mysticism. Traditional Kabbalists regard it as originating in Tannaic times, redacting the Oral Torah, so do not make a sharp distinction between Kabbalah and early Rabbinic Jewish mysticism. Academic scholars regard it as a synthesis from the Middle Ages, when it appeared between the 13th-15th centuries, but assimilating and incorporating into itself earlier forms of Jewish mysticism, possible continuations of ancient esoteric traditions, as well as medieval philosophical elements.

The theosophical aspect of Kabbalah itself developed through two historical forms: &quot;Medieval/Classic/Zoharic Kabbalah&quot; (c.1175 – 1492 – 1570), and Lurianic Kabbalah (1569  – today) which assimilated Medieval Kabbalah into its wider system and became the basis for modern Jewish Kabbalah. After Luria, two new mystical forms popularised Kabbalah in Judaism: antinomian-heretical Sabbatean movements (1666 – 18th century), and Hasidic Judaism (1734 – today). In contemporary Judaism, the only main forms of Jewish mysticism which are practiced are esoteric Lurianic Kabbalah and its later commentaries, the variety of schools of Hasidic Judaism, and Neo-Hasidism (incorporating Neo-Kabbalah) in non-Orthodox Jewish denominations.

Two non-Jewish syncretic traditions also popularized Judaic Kabbalah through their incorporation as part of general Western esoteric culture from the Renaissance onwards: theological Christian Cabala (c. 15th  – 18th century) which adapted Judaic Kabbalistic doctrine to Christian belief, and its diverging occultist offshoot Hermetic Qabalah (c. 19th century – today) which became a main element in esoteric and magical societies and teachings. As separate traditions of development outside Judaism, drawing from, syncretically adapting, and different in nature and aims from Judaic mysticism, they are not listed on this page.

<text>Immanuel Jakobovits, Baron Jakobovits (8 February 192131 October 1999) was the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth from 1967 to 1991. Prior to this, he had served as Chief Rabbi of Ireland and as rabbi of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue in New York City. In addition to his official duties he was regarded as an authority in medical ethics from a Jewish standpoint. He was knighted in 1981 and became the first Chief Rabbi to enter the House of Lords in 1988 as Baron Jakobovits.

==Biography==
Jakobovits was born in Königsberg, East Prussia, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia), where his father Julius (Yoel) was a community rabbi. The family moved to Berlin in the 1920s, where his father became rabbinical judge on the &quot;beth din&quot; of the Grossgemeinde, but fled Germany in 1938 to escape Nazi persecutions. In the United Kingdom he completed his higher education, including a period at the Etz Chaim Yeshiva in London, studying under and receiving semicha (rabbi ordination) from the Rabbis Elya Lopian, Leib Gurwicz and Nachman Shlomo Greenspan. He also studied in Jews&#x27; College and the University of London (BA and PhD, University College).

He married Amélie Munk of Paris, the daughter of a prominent rabbi, who would support his community work throughout his life. The couple had six children. Lady Jakobovits died in May 2010, and was buried alongside her husband, on Jerusalem&#x27;s Mount of Olives.

His first position was as rabbi of the Brondesbury synagogue. In 1949, at the relatively young age of 27, he was appointed Chief Rabbi of the declining Jewish community of Ireland. This was to be a stepping stone towards a greater rabbinical career, and in 1958 he assumed the rabbinate of Hermann Merkin&#x27;s Fifth Avenue Synagogue in New York, a position he held until 1966, when he was called to the Chief Rabbinate of the United Hebrew Congregation of the British Commonwealth. He held this position until his retirement in 1991.

He was knighted on 22 July 1981 and was created a life peer on 5 February 1988, as Baron Jakobovits, of Regent&#x27;s Park in Greater London, becoming the first rabbi to receive this honour. In 1987 he was given a Lambeth DD by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the first Jew to receive such a degree. In 1991 he received the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion.

In the House of Lords he became known as a campaigner for traditional morality. Jakobovits aroused considerable controversy when, after the discovery of a possible genetic explanation for homosexuality, he suggested that he saw no &quot;moral objection for using genetic engineering to limit this particular trend&quot;. While he did not advocate abortion, he did describe homosexuality as &quot;a grave departure from the natural norm which we are charged to overcome like any other affliction&quot;; if there were genetic explanations for homosexuality, &quot;the errant gene&quot; should be &quot;removed or repaired&quot; to prevent the &quot;disability&quot;. In a speech in the House of Lords, Jakovites made a speech saying that homophobia was an invented term that aimed to &quot;uproot existing moral order.&quot;

Jakobovits died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 31 October 1999, and was buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.

==Other functions==
Jakobovits was also the president of the Conference of European Rabbis, in which capacity he worked on standardising and regulating religious conversion to Judaism.

==Ideas and philosophy==
Jakobovits was a firm adherent of the &quot;German-Jewish&quot; &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; philosophy, having a broad knowledge of religious subjects as well as secular culture and philosophy. This made him a unique spokesperson for Orthodox Judaism, as he was able to transmit ideas to a wide audience which would otherwise not have achieved dissemination.

Jakobovits was the most prominent figure in 20th century Jewish medical ethics, a field he virtually created on his own. He was also a pioneer in religious bioethics. His speciality was the interaction between medical ethics and &quot;halakha&quot;. Thanks to his academic training in Ireland, Rabbi Jakobovits approached his comprehensive volume, &quot;Jewish Medical Ethics&quot;, in light of Roman Catholic medical ethics, with which he often compares Jewish ethics. Whether developing or disputing his analysis, subsequent Jewish bioethicists have utilised his work on abortion, euthanasia, the history of Jewish medical ethics, palliative care, treatment of the sick, and professional duties. Likewise, he is credited with popularizing the viewpoint that Judaism supports the nearly absolute sanctity of life.

Jakobovits&#x27; political stance was conservative, and he was particularly close to Margaret Thatcher. When a Church of England report titled &quot;Faith in the City&quot; was published in December 1985 criticising Thatcher&#x27;s policies, Jakobovits responded by attacking its underlying philosophy. Jakobovits argued that work rather than welfare should be the over-riding aim of government policy: &quot;Cheap labour is better than a free dole&quot;. More controversially, he contended that inner-city black people should learn from Jewish experiences in America. There, he argued, Jews had worked themselves out of poverty, educated themselves, integrated into the host culture and nurtured a &quot;trust in and respect for the police, realising that our security as a minority depended on law and order being maintained&quot;. Jakobovits also took a conservative view on trade unions, criticised &quot;Faith in the City&quot; for not mentioning the role of trade unions, arguing that &quot;The selfishness of workers in attempting to secure better conditions at the cost of rising unemployment and immense public misery can be just as morally indefensible as the rapaciousness of the wealthy in exploiting the working class&quot;.

Within Judaism, Jakobovits held mildly Zionist views. He maintained that sooner or later Israel would need to negotiate the territory it conquered during the Six-Day War; which made him a controversial figure, as he mentioned these views publicly.

<doc id="876459" wikidata="Q847847" url="?curid=876459" title="Synthetism">
<text>Synthetism is a term used by Post-Impressionist artists like Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard and Louis Anquetin to distinguish their work stylistically from Impressionism. Earlier, &quot;Synthetism&quot; has been connected to the term Cloisonnism, and later to Symbolism. The term is derived from the French verb &quot;synthétiser&quot; (&quot;to synthesize&quot; or &quot;to combine so as to form a new, complex product&quot;).

==History==
Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Louis Anquetin, and others pioneered the style during the late 1880s and early 1890s.

Synthetist artists aimed to &quot;synthesize&quot; three features: 
*The outward appearance of natural forms.
*The artist&#x27;s feelings about their subject.
*The purity of the aesthetic considerations of line, colour and form.

In 1890, Maurice Denis summarized the goals for synthetism as,
:&quot;It is well to remember that a picture before being a battle horse, a nude woman, or some anecdote, is essentially a flat surface covered with colours assembled in a certain order.&quot;

The term was first used in 1877 to distinguish between scientific and naturalistic Impressionism, and in 1889 when Gauguin and Emile Schuffenecker organized an &quot;Exposition de peintures du groupe impressioniste et synthétiste&quot; in the Café Volpini at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. The confusing title has been mistakenly associated with Impressionism. Synthetism emphasized two-dimensional flat patterns, thus differing from Impressionist art and theory.

==Synthetist paintings==

*Paul Sérusier - &quot;Talisman (Bois d&#x27;amour)&quot; (1888)
*Paul Gauguin - &quot;Vision After The Sermon&quot; (1888), &quot;La Belle Angele&quot; (1889), &quot;The Loss of Innocence&quot; (1890)
*Émile Bernard - &quot;Buckwheat Harvest&quot; (1888)
*Charles Laval - &quot;Going to Market&quot; (1888)
*Cuno Amiet - &quot;Breton Spinner&quot; (1893)

<text>Scott A. Mosier (born March 5, 1971) is an American film producer, director and editor best known for his work with director Kevin Smith, with whom he occasionally co-hosts the weekly podcast, &quot;SModcast&quot;.

== Early life ==
Mosier was born in Vancouver, Washington, and moved around as a child between British Columbia and Washington. He has dual Canadian and American citizenship, as his father John was born in Saskatchewan, Canada. As a teenager he resided in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Mosier met Kevin Smith while both were attending Vancouver Film School in Canada. Their first assignment, &quot;Mae Day: The Crumbling of a Documentary&quot;, was a student film documentary that fell apart in production. To salvage it, Smith and Mosier interviewed the crew about the demise of the very documentary that they had been attempting to produce. They also added a segment in which the two were shown in silhouette as they described their fictional thoughts.

Four months into the eight-month program, Smith decided to drop out, but not before making a deal with Mosier: each would start writing a script of his own, and the one who finished last would help the other with his film.

== Career ==

=== View Askew ===
On Smith&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;Clerks&quot;, Mosier recorded the original sound on set, edited the film (at RST Video), and contributed to the budget. He also contributed by appearing on-screen as multiple characters, including the angry hockey player and Willam Black (Snowball).

On 1995 film &quot;Mallrats&quot;, Mosier worked in organizing the budget along with line producer Laura Greenlee, while presiding over a much larger crew. In the film, he portrayed Svenning&#x27;s assistant, Roddy. The character later appeared on a Jay and Silent Bob MTV short.

On the 1997 romantic comedy film &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, Mosier and Smith agreed with Miramax&#x27;s Harvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein to shrink the initial proposed budget from $3 million to $250,000. The compromise allowed Mosier and Kevin to cast their friends instead of established stars. Mosier appears in the beginning of the film as the comics convention patron who gets into an argument with Banky Edwards (Jason Lee) after demeaning his career as a “tracer”.

On the 1999 film &quot;Dogma&quot;, Mosier worked with Greenlee again; the editing of the film lasted nearly a year. He also played the Smooching Seaman who Ben Affleck and Matt Damon meet on the bus.

On the 2001 film &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, Mosier worked with a budget of $20 million. The editing was difficult, due to the MPAA threatening to give the film an NC-17 rating. In the film, Mosier played the assistant director on the set of the fictional sequel to &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; and reprises his Willam Black character from &quot;Clerks&quot;.

Mosier had a comparatively larger budget to work with on the film &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;, at $35 million. The editing was also difficult due to the studio&#x27;s desire to cut a large amount of Jennifer Lopez footage with Ben Affleck following the poor box-office performance of &quot;Gigli&quot;.

Mosier produced &quot;Clerks II&quot; in 2006. Smith stated he edited the film himself, making &quot;Clerks II&quot; one of three films Mosier has produced with Smith, but not edited (the others being &quot;Mallrats&quot; and &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot;). Mosier makes a brief cameo as a concerned father who shields his daughter&#x27;s eyes from the sight of a character sitting on a toilet.

In 2008, Mosier worked again with Smith as the producer on &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot;.

=== Other work ===
Mosier served as an executive producer, editor, and actor for Bryan Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Vulgar&quot;, an Askew production. He had also served as a producer (along with Smith) on &quot;Drawing Flies, A Better Place&quot;, and &quot;&quot;; he served as a co-executive producer on &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; and &quot;Big Helium Dog&quot;. He also appeared in cameos in &quot;Drawing Flies&quot; as the Crying Diaperman, in &quot;A Better Place&quot; as Larry, and in &quot;Vulgar&quot; as Scotty. Although he barely recorded any episodes in 2017, Mosier is also a co-host, along with Smith, of the SModcast podcast hosted by the Smith-owned SModcast.com.

In 2007, &quot;Salim Baba&quot;, a short documentary Mosier produced, was nominated for an Academy Award. Filmmakers Tim Sternberg and Francisco Bello received the nomination (Mosier was unable to be nominated due to a limit of two nominees per short film).

On SModcast 77, Mosier announced he would not produce Smith&#x27;s film &quot;Cop Out&quot; (2010), instead pursuing his directorial debut. He stated on SModcast 90 that he finished writing his first feature screenplay and was in the process of trying to sell it.

On August 10, 2011, Mosier stated on Twitter that he has written some episodes of the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; cartoon on Disney. This was confirmed in a special &quot;SModcast Extra&quot; (attached to SModcast No. 204 and episode 5 of the &quot;Comic Book Men&quot; podcast &quot;Secret Stash&quot;) in which he and Smith interview Joe Casey; Mosier has written six scripts for the series.

Mosier made his directorial debut with Illumination Entertainment&#x27;s animated feature &quot;The Grinch&quot;, based on the book by Dr. Seuss, and co-directed with Yarrow Cheney. It was released on November 9, 2018.

== Personal life ==
Mosier was personally involved with fellow producer Monica Hampton for a while, whom he met while the two were producing &quot;Vulgar&quot;. He married girlfriend Alex Hilebronner on September 1, 2006. The couple met on the set of &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;.

In the documentary &quot;Back to the Well: Clerks II&quot;, he states that he is agnostic, but has gone to church with Kevin Smith on occasion.

<doc id="876478" wikidata="Q720259" url="?curid=876478" title="John Adams Dix">
<text>John Adams Dix (July 24, 1798 – April 21, 1879) was an American politician and military officer who was Secretary of the Treasury, Governor of New York and Union major general during the Civil War. He was notable for arresting the pro-Southern Maryland General Assembly, preventing that divided border state from seceding, and for arranging a system for prisoner exchange via the Dix–Hill Cartel, concluded in partnership with Confederate Major General Daniel Harvey Hill.

==Biography==
Dix was born in Boscawen, New Hampshire on July 24, 1798, the son of Timothy Dix and Abigail Wilkins, and brother of composer Marion Dix Sullivan. He was educated at Phillips Exeter Academy, and joined the US Army as an ensign in May 1813, serving under his father until the latter&#x27;s death a few months later. He attained the rank of captain in August 1825 and resigned from the Army in December 1828.

In 1826, Dix married Catherine Morgan, the adopted daughter of Congressman John J. Morgan, who gave Dix a job overseeing his upstate New York land holdings in Cooperstown. Dix and his wife moved to Cooperstown in 1828, and he practiced law in addition to overseeing the land holdings. In 1830, he was appointed by Governor Enos T. Throop as Adjutant General of New York, and moved to Albany, New York. He was Secretary of State of New York from 1833 to 1839, and a member of the New York State Assembly (Albany Co.) in 1842.

===U.S. Senator===

Dix was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Silas Wright, Jr., and held office from 1845 to 1849. In November 1848, he was the Barnburner/Free-Soil candidate for Governor of New York, but was defeated by Whig Hamilton Fish. In February 1849, he ran for re-election to the U.S. Senate as the Barnburners&#x27; candidate, but the Whig majority of the State Legislature elected William H. Seward.

===Railroad president and postmaster===

In 1853 Dix was president of the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad. He was appointed Postmaster of New York City and served from 1860 to 1861.

In addition to his military and public duties, Dix was the president of the Union Pacific from 1863 to 1868 during construction of the First transcontinental railroad. He was the figurehead for rail baron Thomas C. Durant, in both of his railroad presidencies. He was also briefly president of the Erie Railroad in 1872.

===Civil War service===

Dix was appointed United States Secretary of the Treasury by President James Buchanan in January 1861 for the remainder of the lame duck president&#x27;s term, ending on March 4. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he sent a telegram to the Treasury agents in New Orleans ordering that: &quot;If any one attempts to haul down the American flag, shoot him on the spot.&quot; Although the telegram was intercepted by Confederates, and was never delivered to the Treasury agents, the text found its way to the press, and Dix became one of the first heroes of the North during the Civil War. The saying is found on many Civil War tokens minted during the war, although the wording is slightly modified.

====Major general====

At the start of the American Civil War, Dix was appointed a major general in the New York Militia. With George Opdyke and Richard Milford Blatchford, he formed the Union Defense Committee, empowered by President Abraham Lincoln to spend public money during the initial raising and equipping of the Union Army. He joined the Union Army as the highest ranking major general of volunteers during the war, effective May 16, 1861; also appointed on that day were Nathaniel P. Banks and Benjamin Franklin Butler, but Dix&#x27;s name appeared first on the promotion list, meaning that he had seniority over all major generals of volunteers. In the summer of 1861, he commanded the Department of Maryland and the Department of Pennsylvania. His importance at the beginning of the Civil War was in arresting six members of the Maryland General Assembly and thereby preventing the legislature from meeting. This prevented Maryland from seceding, and earned him President Lincoln&#x27;s gratitude. That winter, he commanded a regional organization known as &quot;Dix&#x27;s Command&quot; within Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s Department of the Potomac. Dix commanded the Department of Virginia from June 1862 until July 1863, and the Department of the East from July 1863 until April 1865.

On July 22, 1862, Dix and Confederate Major General Daniel Harvey Hill concluded an agreement for the general exchange of prisoners between the Union and Confederate armies. This agreement became known as the Dix-Hill Cartel. It established a scale of equivalents, where an officer would be exchanged for a fixed number of enlisted men, and also allowed for the parole of prisoners, who would undertake not to serve in a military capacity until officially exchanged. (The cartel worked well for a few months, but broke down when Confederates insisted on treating black prisoners as fugitive slaves and returning them to their previous owners.)

On October 10, 1862, Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles wrote that &quot;a scheme for permits, special favors, Treasury agents, and improper management&quot; existed and was arranged by Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase for General John A. Dix. The motive of Chase appeared to be for political influence and not for financial gain.

Dix was considered too old for field command. Some believe that his most distinguished contribution to the war was the suppression of the New York City draft riots in July 1863, although the rioting had already subsided by the time he replaced General John E. Wool. He was also active in the defense of Suffolk, which was part of his department. He served as the temporary chairman of the 1866 National Union Convention.

===Later career===
He was United States Minister to France from 1866 to 1869.

He was Governor of New York from 1873 to 1874, elected on the Republican ticket in November 1872, but was defeated for re-election by Samuel J. Tilden in November 1874. He suffered another defeat when he ran for the Mayor of New York City in 1876.

===Death ===
Dix died on April 21, 1879, in New York City at age 80 and was buried at the Trinity Church Cemetery in Lower Manhattan.

==Legacy==

==Musical career==

Doroschuk formed the Canadian new wave/synthpop group Men Without Hats in 1977, earning worldwide success with &quot;The Safety Dance&quot; in 1983 and &quot;Pop Goes the World&quot; in 1987. Men Without Hats started out as a new wave band, but the band&#x27;s sound changed throughout the 1980s, adding more rock influence and transitioning to hard rock by the end of 1990.

In 1997, recording under the name Ivan, he released a solo album, &quot;The Spell&quot;, followed by a 1999 tour to promote the album.

Doroschuk attempted to revive Men Without Hats in 2003 with his release of the band&#x27;s comeback album &quot;No Hats Beyond This Point&quot;, but did not reform the group for a tour or live performances. The studio album used material originally intended for Doroschuk&#x27;s unreleased second solo album &quot;Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot;. Apart from a 2003 interview on VH1&#x27;s &quot;True Spin&quot;, and a 2008 SOCAN Awards Gala where he was presented with an award for &quot;The Safety Dance&quot;, Doroschuk made few public appearances during the 2000s.

In 2010, a full revival and reformation of the group Men Without Hats took place, with Doroschuk recruiting three new members. In 2012, they released the album &quot;Love in the Age of War&quot;, in which Doroschuk returned the band to its early-1980s synthpop sound by creating an intentional follow-up album to 1982&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm of Youth&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Doroschuk married in the late 1990s but later divorced. He has one son and was a stay-at-home father before reforming Men Without Hats. He resides in Victoria, British Columbia.

<text>Ignosticism or igtheism is the idea that the question of the existence of God is meaningless because the word &quot;God&quot; has no coherent and unambiguous definition.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;ignosticism&quot; was coined in 1964 by Sherwin Wine, a former Reform rabbi and a founding figure of Humanistic Judaism.

==Distinction from theological noncognitivism==
Ignosticism and theological noncognitivism are similar although whereas the ignostic says &quot;every theological position assumes too much about the concept of God&quot;, the theological noncognitivist claims to have no concept whatever to label as &quot;a concept of God&quot;, but the relationship of ignosticism to other nontheistic views is less clear. While Paul Kurtz finds the view to be compatible with both weak atheism and agnosticism, other philosophers consider ignosticism to be distinct.

<text>The Kenya Methodist University (KeMU) is a chartered private university founded by the Methodist Church in Kenya. It is situated within woodland on the north eastern slopes of Mount Kenya, five kilometers from Meru Town. The development of KeMU is based on the 1906 Methodist Church education policy that resulted in the development of schools, industrial institutes and colleges.

== History ==
In 1987 the Methodist Church in Kenya formed a working committee to work out how to establish a university in the region. In 1995 the Commission for Higher Education made an inspection visit of the project, and later in June 1997 granted a Letter of Interim Authority, giving approval for the establishment of Kenya Methodist University. The authority paved the way for the creation of academic programmes, research and post-graduate training. KeMU became a fully chartered university on 28 June 2006.

== Campus ==
The university has campuses in Meru, Nairobi, and Mombasa .

<text>Joey Lauren Adams (born January 9, 1968) is an American actress and director. Adams starred in &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and played smaller roles in other Kevin Smith View Askewniverse films.

==Career==
Adams began her film career in 1977 with a small role in &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot;. From there she began to find larger roles. In 1991, Adams appeared in &quot;Top of the Heap&quot;, the 100th episode of &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, and subsequently starred in its short-lived spinoff. In 1993, Adams landed her first major film role as Simone in Richard Linklater&#x27;s &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;. The same year, she appeared in the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; spinoff film &quot;Coneheads&quot; as one of Connie Conehead&#x27;s friends.

Two years later, Adams appeared in &quot;Mallrats&quot;, written and directed by Kevin Smith. The two started dating during the film&#x27;s post-production, and their relationship provided the inspiration for Smith&#x27;s next film, &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;. The relationship did not last long, but ended on friendly terms. Meanwhile, in 1996, while Smith was finalizing the script for &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, Adams was cast in the slapstick comedy &quot;Bio-Dome&quot;, which was directed by Jason Bloom. Adams played Monique, Bud Macintosh&#x27;s (Pauly Shore) girlfriend.

Adams played a leading role in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, portraying Alyssa Jones, a lesbian who falls in love with a man, played by Ben Affleck. Later, Smith would describe &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; as a &quot;sort of penance/valentine&quot; and a &quot;thank-you homage&quot; to Adams. In addition to her acting work on the film, Adams wrote and performed the song &quot;Alive&quot; for the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

Adams&#x27; performance in &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; earned her both the 1997 Chicago Film Critics Award and Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award for Most Promising Actress, and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress-Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. From there, Adams was originally slated to play the female lead in Smith&#x27;s next film, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Dogma&quot;, but Linda Fiorentino ultimately won the role. However, she would later make brief appearances in two other Smith projects: the 2001 film &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, and the 2004 animated short &quot;&quot;, featured on the &quot;Clerks X&quot; DVD. In both of these appearances, Adams reprises the role of Alyssa Jones.

Her post-Smith projects included playing a spunky veterinarian&#x27;s assistant who falls in love with a single father (Vince Vaughn) in 1998&#x27;s &quot;A Cool, Dry Place&quot;. The following year, Adams appeared in her first big-budget Hollywood release, playing Adam Sandler&#x27;s love interest in the successful comedy &quot;Big Daddy&quot;. She then went on to appear in many smaller films, including &quot;Beautiful&quot; and &quot;In the Shadows&quot;. In 2005, she had a guest role in an episode of the TV series &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;.

Also in 2006, Adams released her directorial debut film, &quot;Come Early Morning&quot;, starring Ashley Judd, Jeffrey Donovan, Diane Ladd, Tim Blake Nelson and Laura Prepon. The film, shot on location in Little Rock, Arkansas, was selected for the 2006 Sundance Film Festival.

In 2006, she, along with Lian Lunson and Nicole Holofcener, was awarded the Women in Film Dorothy Arzner Directors Award. On November 24, 2009, Interscope Records released Adams&#x27; directorial debut for a music video entitled &quot;Belle of the Boulevard&quot; by Dashboard Confessional.

Adams returned to TV in March 2010, on the Showtime series &quot;The United States of Tara&quot;. She appeared in six episodes as Pammy, a barmaid who falls for Buck, one of the title character&#x27;s alternate personalities.

Adams is also known for her distinctive voice which one film critic referred to as that of a &quot;sex-kitten-on-helium&quot;. Regarding her voice, Adams commented: &quot;It&#x27;s not a normal voice. It doesn&#x27;t fit into people&#x27;s preconceptions about what a woman&#x27;s voice should sound like. My mom doesn&#x27;t think I have an unusual voice, though. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s helped me get some roles. But &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; I almost didn&#x27;t get. There was concern the voice would grate on some people, which some critics said it did.&quot; Another film critic said that whether viewers loved it or hated it, her voice had &quot;the potential to hypnotize.&quot;

==Personal life==
Adams was born in North Little Rock, Arkansas, the youngest of three children. Her father was a lumber yard owner. Adams grew up in the Overbrook neighborhood of North Little Rock and graduated from North Little Rock Northeast High School in 1986. She announced her intention to pursue acting after one year as an exchange student in Australia. In a May 7, 1997, appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; to promote &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, Adams revealed she was a niece to &quot;Hee-Haw&quot; cast member and ordained minister Grady Nutt.

Adams married Brian Vilim in 2014.

<text>Harold Sonny Ladoo (4 February 1945 – 17 August 1973) was a Caribbean novelist, who was the author of two books documenting the struggles of living in poverty in the Hindu communities of Trinidad and Tobago. He moved to Canada in 1968 and was mysteriously murdered while on a visit to Trinidad in 1973.

== Biography ==
Ladoo was born and grew up in an environment much like the world of his novels. He was born in Trinidad into extreme poverty, and immigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with his wife and son in 1968 to study English at the University of Toronto.

It was during this time that he wrote his first and most notable novel, &quot;No Pain Like This Body&quot;, published in 1972. Described by David Chariandy and &quot;an unusually strong first novel&quot;, it is the vivid story of a young boy growing up in a small Caribbean rice-growing community. The book focuses on the day-to-day struggles of a single family through illness, storm, and violence during the August rainy season. The writing is raw and often naïve yet manages to create a visceral experience.

His second book, &quot;Yesterdays&quot; (posthumously published, 1974), was a much more upbeat book about a young man attempting to launch a Hindu Mission to Canada.

Ladoo&#x27;s third book was intended to be the last part of a trilogy; however, in 1973, while on a visit home to his Calcutta Settlement, he was mysteriously killed and his body was found on the side of a road in Trinidad.

==Bibliography==
* &quot;No Pain Like This Body&quot; (1972), House of Anansi, 2013
* &quot;Yesterdays&quot; (posthumously published, 1974)

== Legacy ==

Michael Bucknor and Conrad James described Ladoo&#x27;s work as being, along with the works of Andrew Salkey, &quot;especially useful&quot; for tracking developments in Caribbean social attitudes towards masculinity and issues of male sexuality during the mid- to late-20th century, a domain that had been neglected by Western scholars until recently.

An essay on Indo-Caribbean authors contrasted Ladoo&#x27;s work with that of Sasenarine Persaud, neither of them ever having had direct experiences with India; Persaud integrated spiritual and aesthetic elements of Indian high culture into his writing, while Ladoo&#x27;s writing of his colonial environment featured &quot;naturalistic detail, black humour, and the grotesque&quot;. Scholar Victor Ramraj described Ladoo as being unique from fellow Indo-Caribbean writers Neil Bissoondath, Rabindranath Maharaj, Ismith Khan, V. S. Naipaul, and Samuel Selvon: Ladoo&#x27;s use of Creole dialect is a departure from older Caribbean fiction. 

Naipaul, Jean Rhys, George Lamming, Derek Walcott, and others, used the polished language of the coloniser and showed in doing so that they were equal to the British writers who made a name for themselves. Ladoo, on the other hand, shows his confidence by selecting Creole, as if to say, &quot;This is the dialect of the common man, why should I try to gentrify it?&quot; In doing so, he achieves an authenticity that is furthered by the immersion of his characters in the kind of vocabulary and sentence structure that the poverty-stricken people would use. In addition, his use of onomatopoeia heightens the effect of the sounds of movement in people and nature, and increases the animism that makes the characters even more authentic. Indigenous people all over the world have believed in the almost god-like power of nature. Ladoo amplifies this distinctive belief in the intentionality given to thunder or lightning or reptiles.

The University of Toronto Mississauga campus (formerly Erindale College) offers to students The Harold Sonny Ladoo Book Prize for Creative Writing every year.

<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Motoi Yoshida. It was published in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;seinen&quot; manga magazine &quot;Evening&quot; from 2001 to 2004, with its chapters collected in five volumes by Kodansha. The series tells of the incestuous relationship that develops between 28-year-old Koshiro, and his 15-year-old sister, Nanoka.

It was adapted into a 13-episode anime television series by A.C.G.T. Directed by Takahiro Omori, it was broadcast on TV Asahi from April to June 2004; only twelve episodes of the series aired, with the remaining episode streamed online and later included in both DVD releases and when the series aired in reruns as the eighth episode. The anime series was licensed for release in North American by Geneon Entertainment, which released three DVD volumes in 2005.

==Synopsis==
Twenty-eight-year-old Koshiro Saeki, who lives with his father Zenzo, is dumped by his girlfriend Shoko of two years, who claims he was too cold and she had found someone else. While on a train the morning after, he sees high school student Nanoka Kohinata looking at a button and crying. Later, as she is getting off the train, she unknowingly drops her train pass and Koshiro follows to return it to her. Koshiro finds himself watching her sudden smile as she notices the cherry blossoms are in bloom. Later, Koshiro is leaving his job at a marriage-arranging company with a coworker when he encounters the same girl again. Having two free tickets to a nearby amusement park, he gives them to her. To his surprise, she asks him to go with her. While on the Ferris wheel, the girl explains that she was crying on the train because she&#x27;d been rejected by a boy she had been in love with for several years. Koshiro ends up telling her about his own break up, and cries while she comforts him.

As they leave the park together, having enjoyed the outing and expecting to part and never meet again, they run into their father and are shocked to discover they are siblings. Nanoka moved to Tokyo just that morning to live with them because their home is closer to her new high school. As Koshiro hadn&#x27;t gone home the night before, he hadn&#x27;t learned of her arrival. Since they had grown up living separately, they didn&#x27;t know what the other looked like.

As the series progresses, Koshiro finds himself unable to rid himself of the attraction that he felt for Nanoka when he first met her. Instead, his love and desire continue to grow, despite his attempts to fight them. Entering womanhood, Nanoka also develops feelings for her older brother, only increasing Koshiro&#x27;s struggle. In near desperation, he moves out of the family home to remove himself from temptation and attempts to keep his coworker, Kaname Chidori, from finding out the truth behind his brusqueness with Nanoka.

However, the solution is only temporary, as Nanoka begins visiting Koshiro regularly, cooking him meals and spending time with him. Eventually, unable to resist their feelings anymore, they share a passionate kiss and have sex with each other. Unsure of what to do now that they have broken a societal taboo, they visit their parents, before contemplating committing suicide together. In the end, they decide to live, and to continue their relationship.

She eventually becomes suspicious of the siblings&#x27; relationship, and upon realizing she is correct, attempts to get them to end things, even trying to convince Nanoka that she is dating Koshiro.

==Reception==
&quot;Koi Kaze is not a series which is going to suit everyone&#x27;s tastes due to its subject matter. It has the potential, though, to be the year&#x27;s premiere romantic anime series.&quot; — Theron Martin, &quot;Anime News Network&quot;.

&quot;With the first third of the show on this volume, it&#x27;s definitely one of the better structured doomed romances that I&#x27;ve seen in anime in a long time.&quot; — Chris Beveridge, &quot;Mania&quot;.

&quot;There are a million ways this series could have gone wrong. Instead, &quot;Koi Kaze&quot; deserves the highest marks possible for its thoughtful, honest, and mature handling of such a difficult and controversial issue.&quot; — Carlos Ross, &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot;.

&quot;&quot;Koi Kaze&quot; is not a reassuring show, but if it skirts the edge of disaster instead of plunging in, it may offer warmth to lonely, troubled people, and that&#x27;s worth a lot.&quot; — Christian Nutt, &quot;Newtype USA&quot;.

His elder sister was Clara Alzina Hapgood Higgins, who later married Frank Sullivan Smith, one time head of the Shawmut Railroad. His father, a descendant of Stephen Hopkins of the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, was a successful merchant who owned a chain of grocery stores in Olean, New York and held mining and timber tracts in Michigan, Wisconsin, Washington, Oregon, and Minnesota.

Higgins&#x27;s grandfather was a pioneer physician of distinction in Western New York.

Higgins attended Rushford Academy and then Riverview Academy, a military school in Peekskill, New York, from which he graduated in 1873. He then attended a commercial college in Binghamton, New York.

==Career==
After completing his education Higgins worked as a sales agent for an oil company in Detroit and Chicago, and then became a partner in the Stanton, Michigan, mercantile firm of Wood, Thayer, and Company. In 1879, Higgins returned to New York and became a partner in his father&#x27;s business, Higgins, Blodgett &amp; Co.

===Political career===
He was a delegate to the 1888 Republican National Convention. In 1894, Higgins was elected to the New York Senate with a plurality of 8,046 votes over his opponent, and he served for eight years, sitting in the 117th, 118th (both 32nd D.), 119th, 120th, 121st, 122nd, 123rd, 124th and 125th New York State Legislatures (all seven 50th D.). While in the Senate, he served on various committees and was &quot;Chairman of the Finance Committee for a longer period than any other man.&quot;

In 1888, he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in Chicago that resulted in the nomination of former Senator Benjamin Harrison of Indiana for President and Levi P. Morton of New York, a former Congressman and Minister to France, for Vice President.

In 1902, Higgins was the successful Republican candidate for lieutenant governor against Democrat Charles N. Bulger (663,689 votes to 653,555 votes), and he served one term from 1903 to 1904. In what was considered the Republican Roosevelt wave, due to former New York Governor&#x27;s Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s election to the Presidency, Higgins was the successful Republican nominee for governor in 1904, and he served one term from January 1905 to December 1906. He was succeeded by fellow Republican Charles Evans Hughes (who later became the U.S. Secretary of State and Chief Justice of the United States).

Higgins was in ill health at the end of his term and died just six weeks after leaving office. In his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it was said:

&quot;The illness of ex-Gov. Higgins covers practically the whole of his administration of two years. His health was not robust when he was nominated for Governor in 1904, and it is but chronicling the truth to say that the campaign taxed him greatly. Following his election he was able to rest up, and for a time he felt better than in months. On assuming office, however, the cares of the Governorship wore on him and each month increased the pressure.&quot;

==Personal life==
On June 5, 1877, Higgins was married to Kate Corinne Noble (1855–1929), a daughter of Aaron Harrison Noble and Aldura (née Bell) Noble. They married in Stanton, Michigan, where Higgins was then in business. Together, they were the parents of:

* Orrin Thrall Higgins (1879–1912)
* Josephine Bell Higgins, who married Émile Lucien Hovelaque, the Inspector General of Public Instruction in France, in 1911.
* Frank Harrison Higgins (1886–1937).
* Clarence Noble Higgins (1890–1890), who died in infancy of Cholera Infantum.

Among Higgins closest friends was Olean Mayor Nicholas Van Vranken Franchot, who served as the New York State Superintendent of Public Works during Higgins administration.

Higgins died of heart disease in Olean on February 12, 1907. After an Episcopal burial service read at his residence, he was buried at Mount View Cemetery in Olean. President and Mrs. Roosevelt sent flowers, as did Governor Hughes and many other prominent people. Higgins estate was valued at $1,250,000, considerably less than the $15,000,000 estimated around his death. His wife died at the Higgins residence, 128 South Street in Olean, in May 1929.

===Legacy===
Higgins official portrait as Governor of New York was painted by Buffalo, New York, native, Eugene Speicher.

A biography of Higgins, &quot;Frank Wayland Higgins: New York’s Forgotten Governor&quot;, was authored by William Gabler in 2002.

<doc id="876512" wikidata="Q4349788" url="?curid=876512" title="Legend of the Red Dragon">
<text>Legend of the Red Dragon (LORD) is a text-based online role-playing video game, released in 1989 by Robinson Technologies. &quot;LORD&quot; is one of the best known door games. The player&#x27;s goal is to improve their skills in order to defeat the Red Dragon which has been attacking the village. The software is compatible with DOS, Microsoft Windows, and OS/2. The game was sold to and is currently owned by Metropolis Gameport. 

==History==
&quot;LORD&quot; was created by Seth Robinson of Robinson Technologies and is currently maintained by Michael Preslar. Robinson began to write &quot;LORD&quot; in Pascal to run on his bulletin board system. As he did not have access to other door games such as &quot;Trade Wars&quot;, he needed something that would occasionally bring people back to the BBS. The first version of &quot;LORD&quot; only featured the chatting and flirting systems. Over time, Robinson incorporated features that he had seen work well in other games: for example, the restricted number of turns per day, and the concept of random events. Eventually &quot;LORD&quot; became a mixture of action and romance.

Initially only intended to run on his own BBS, Robinson eventually received offers from users who wanted to run it on other systems. After the first sale, word-of-mouth advertising increased its popularity.

&quot;LORD&quot; was a successful game, and by 1993 many BBSs had active communities of players. Over the next few years, MUDs began to overtake BBS door games as the multiplayer online format of choice, and in 1998 Robinson sold the game and its sequel to Metropolis Gameport. He went on to write other small games for PC and mobile platforms. His final release of &quot;LORD&quot; was version 4.00a.

Metropolis Gameport contracted Michael Preslar on January 8, 2001, to continue the game&#x27;s development. The most recent version of &quot;LORD&quot; (4.08) was released in 2009 as a patch (via the DOSEMU patch archive), and was labeled as &quot;Patch for Lord 4.07 for OS/2, dosemu, and most all other emulated environments&quot;.
The latest version available on the official site is 4.07, with the full package for 4.08 being under inspection since Oct 22, 2007. According to Preslar, further updates to the &quot;LORD&quot; software were planned, including a web application and versions for ELF-compatible Linux and Unix systems (completed but available only to beta testers), but his latest statement on the matter, in 2013, is that he no longer has a system that allows him to work on the game.

==Gameplay==
The premise of &quot;LORD&quot; is that a red dragon is wreaking havoc in a town where the player has recently arrived. Multiple players compete over a period of weeks to advance their skills and to kill the dragon. In order to achieve this goal, players must face combat to gain experience. Once they have gained enough experience, they must face their master at Turgon&#x27;s Warrior Training and advance in skill level. Advancement increases the players fighting stats and gives an additional skill point in the current skill (up to 40). Advancement also presents stronger enemies and masters; a player must challenge and defeat master Turgon himself to reach level 12, the final level, before attempting to search for and slay the dragon.

As a BBS game, &quot;LORD&quot; uses a text-only interface. Later versions of &quot;LORD&quot; also gave the option of using RIP (Remote Imaging Protocol) graphics, which required the use of a RIP client to view.

Players select a character class, choosing from among &quot;Death Knight Skills&quot;, &quot;Mystical Skills&quot;, and &quot;Thieving Skills&quot;. While a player is training in a particular skill, s/he is subject to random events in the woods for that particular skill, which provide opportunities for advancement. Eventually, players may master all three skills.

Players can take a certain number of actions every day. Actions could be to fight monsters in the forest, attack other players or to attempt to slay the red dragon itself. In addition, every day a player can send a &quot;flirt&quot; to another player character which may range from a shy wink, to sex, to a marriage proposal. Sometimes this can be done more than once a day. Sex may result in contracting sexually transmitted diseases, and female characters might become pregnant.

While a player is looking for forest monsters a number of random forest events can occur; these involve simple events such as finding gold or gems as well as interactions with a number of non-player characters such as Olivia, men/maidens in distress, the old hag, and the old man, and the opportunity to advance in your skill if they pass the test. This is also where a player encounters flowers in the fairy garden and meets up with a group of fairies bathing.

There are three non-player characters located at the Inn: Seth Able the bard, Violet the barmaid, and the unnamed Bartender. Seth Able the bard will sing a song for a player. Once a day, players can listen to Seth&#x27;s song and receive a bonus, such as the doubling of one&#x27;s bank account, or additional forest or player vs. player fight opportunities. The Bartender provides services and information to any warrior who can pay him in gold or gems, but provides nothing for free.

Male players can also flirt with Violet, and female players with Seth Able (named after Robinson), in a fashion similar to flirting with other players. Success is based on the player&#x27;s charm points. A marriage to Violet or Seth may last one day or two months or more; unlike player-player marriages, the software may terminate these bonds at any time. During marriage, offspring are possible for male players, and more likely for female players. Offspring bring sometimes surprising benefits to warriors.

&quot;LORD&quot; allows many players to play simultaneously, in BBSs that support it. This allows real-time player-versus-player battles.

&quot;LORD&quot; features several in-game message boards, as well as a limited electronic mail system, which allow players to converse. Players may use the mail system to send flirtations to other players of the opposite sex, propose trysts, or marriage.

The registration system let all players play until level six, then it wouldn&#x27;t allow players to get past to level 7 until the program was registered. Users often sent in funds for that very purpose. Some players even registered their own copy of LORD for local use so they could practice skills and test strategies.

===IGMs===
In-Game Modules (IGMs) are small software extensions written by third-party developers that add functionality to &quot;LORD&quot;. A number of these were created and widely distributed. IGM software was first developed on the Amiga, and then ported to MS-DOS. Some IGMs were written to allow a &quot;cheating&quot; style of game play, and others have presented bugs or loopholes to be exploited by players. The current maintainer of the &quot;LORD&quot; software has introduced a scripting language called &quot;Lady&quot; in order to allow smoother development of game extensions.

====Wizardstone====
Wizardstone was planned to be a major IGM; the author was so enthusiastic about it that he convinced Robinson to advertise it by mentioning its two main characters in a forest event within the game itself. The IGM had a number of features that Robinson was impressed with, most notably its blackjack game.
Though the IGM Wizardstone was never released it is nonetheless important to the history of the game, being the only IGM mentioned in the game itself, the inspiration for the &quot;Olivia&quot; forest event character, and the source of the Blackjack event.

The IGM was supposed to contain an ending to Olivia&#x27;s story, as stated in the game. There was once talk of adding an ending to Olivia&#x27;s story to the game, but nothing ever came of it.

==Reception==
The game sold only seven copies in its debut year, but word of mouth drove sales to 30,000 units over the next seven years of release.

In Gamasutra&#x27;s essay on the history of computer role-playing video games, &quot;LORD&quot; was considered to be a highly playable and memorable game, with colorful text and humor. &quot;The Escapist&quot; magazine highlighted the way &quot;LORD&quot; handled sexuality, which became more mature as Robinson developed the game over the years.

==Ports and sequels==

Robinson developed an official sequel, &quot;Legend of the Red Dragon II: New World&quot;, in 1992. It featured real-time multiplayer gameplay, with ANSI art graphics, in a Roguelike top-down view. &quot;LORD II&quot;&#x27;s final release came in 1998, before its sale to Metropolis Gameport.

The first &quot;LORD&quot; spin-off, &quot;Tournament LORD&quot;, was written by Robinson. It was a multiplayer version designed for the MBBS/Worldgroup BBS systems.

The second port was &quot;Wildcat Tournament Legend of the Red Dragon&quot; (WT-LORD), a multi-player version created for Wildcat! BBS systems, written by Joseph Marcelletti and Allan Benjamin. Robinson was impressed with this port and used some of its features in the next version of TLORD. It was maintained by IceRage Technologies but is now freeware and no longer developed or supported.

===&quot;Legend of the Green Dragon&quot;===
&quot;Legend of the Green Dragon&quot; is a Web-based variation with major differences in game play. Despite the similarity in name, it is an entirely different game that is not written or authorized by the author or the current owners of &quot;Legend of the Red Dragon&quot;. &quot;Legend of the Green Dragon&quot; (also referred to as &quot;LotGD&quot;) is an open-source game that allows any Web developer to customize and create their own version of the game using the PHP language.

<doc id="876513" wikidata="Q2164854" url="?curid=876513" title="European Hockey League">
<text>The European Hockey League was a European ice hockey club competition which ran between the years 1996 and 2000.

==History==
It was established in 1996 by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and commercial partner CWL Telesport and first contested in 1996–1997. In 1996–97, twenty teams played in five divisions. After home and away intra-division games, the division winners plus the three best second-placed teams went into the quarter-finals. The first winners were Finnish club TPS, who beat Russian HC Dynamo Moscow 5–2.

In the 1997–98 season, 24 teams competed in six divisions. The division winners and the two best second-placed teams progressed to the quarter-finals. The league title was won by Austrian team VEU Feldkirch, who beat Russian side Dynamo Moscow 5–3.

In the 1998–99 season, 24 teams competed in six divisions. The top two in each division were paired off against each other in two-game, home-and-away series. The winners of these six playoffs went into the semi-final round, which was played in two groups of three. The winner of each of these two groups played in the final. For the third year in a row, Dynamo Moscow lost the final, this time to fellow-Russians Metallurg Magnitogorsk.

In the 1999–2000 season, 16 teams competed in four divisions. The two best clubs in each division advanced to the semi-final round, which was played as two-game, home-and-away series. The four winners of the semi-finals qualified for the &quot;EHL Top Four Final&quot;. In that final round, Metallurg Magnitogorsk defended its title, this time beating Czech club Sparta Prague 2–0.

Following consultation with its commercial partner, then called &quot;CWL Holding AG&quot;, the IIHF decided to suspend the running of the European Hockey League for the 2000–01 season. Despite financial investment and the improved quality of the contest, attention from the media, spectators, and TV networks in Europe was not seen as satisfactory. In order to optimize exposure of the league in Europe, the IIHF decided to consult with European broadcasters starting with the 2001–02 season. An international club competition, in the tradition of the previous European Cup, was staged by the IIHF for the 2000–01 season, but the European Hockey League did not restart.

<text>This Island Earth is a 1955 American science fiction film produced by William Alland, directed by Joseph M. Newman and Jack Arnold, and starring Jeff Morrow, Faith Domergue and Rex Reason. It is based on the 1952 novel of the same name by Raymond F. Jones. The film, distributed by Universal-International, was released in 1955 on a double feature with &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy&quot;.

Upon initial release, the film was praised by critics, who cited the special effects, well-written script, and the eye-popping Technicolor as being its major assets. In 1996, it was edited down and lampooned in &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie&quot;, a film adaption of the popular film-riffing television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

The 1952 novel by Jones was originally serialized in the science fiction magazine &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; as three related novelettes: &quot;The Alien Machine&quot; (June 1949), &quot;The Shroud of Secrecy&quot; (December 1949), and &quot;The Greater Conflict&quot; (February 1950). Jones had taken the novel title from a line in Robert Graves&#x27; poem &quot;Darien&quot; (&quot;It is a poet’s privilege and fate/To fall enamoured of the one Muse/Who variously haunts this island earth&quot;).

==Plot==
Physicist and leading atomic scientist Dr. Cal Meacham is flying to his laboratory in a loaned Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star. Just before landing, the jet&#x27;s engine fails, but he is saved from crashing by a mysterious green glow that surrounds his aircraft.

Back at his laboratory, Meacham discovers that an unusual substitute for the electronic condensers that he had ordered has been delivered from a mysterious source. Intrigued that the condensers appear to be made from an unknown and almost indestructible material, he later orders instructions and parts to build a complex device called an &quot;interocitor&quot;. Neither Meacham nor his assistant, Joe Wilson, have heard of such a device, but they immediately begin its construction. When they finish, a mysterious man named Exeter appears on the interocitor&#x27;s screen and informs Meacham that he has passed a test. His ability to build the interocitor demonstrates that he is gifted enough to be part of Exeter&#x27;s special research project. Exeter triggers a beam which causes the interocitor to self-destruct.

Despite his reservations, Meacham remains intrigued and is picked up at the fog-shrouded airport by an unmanned, computer-controlled Douglas DC-3 aircraft with no windows. Landing in a remote area of Georgia, he finds an international group of top atomic scientists already present, including an old flame, Dr. Ruth Adams. Cal is confused by Ruth&#x27;s failure to recognize him and becomes suspicious of Exeter and his assistant Brack. Believing that they are not being monitored, Adams and a third scientist, Steve Carlson, share their suspicions with Meacham.

Meacham and Adams flee with Carlson, but their car is attacked and Carlson is killed. When they take off in a Stinson 108 single engine aircraft, Meacham and Adams watch as the research facility and all its inhabitants are incinerated. Their aircraft is then drawn up by a bright green beam into a flying saucer. Exeter explains that he and his men are from the planet Metaluna and are locked in a war with the Zagons. They defend against Zagon attacks with a planetary energy field, but are running out of uranium to keep it operational. They have enlisted humans in an effort to transmute lead into uranium, but time has now run out. Exeter takes both Earthers back to his world, sealing them in conditioning tubes to normalize the pressure differences between the planets.

They land safely on Metaluna, but the planet is under bombardment by Zagon spaceships guiding flaming meteors as weapons against them. The defensive &quot;ionization layer&quot; is failing, and the battle is entering its final stage. Metaluna&#x27;s leader, the Monitor, reveals that the Metalunans intend to flee to Earth. He insists that Meacham and Adams be subjected to a Thought Transference Chamber to subjugate their free will. He further indicates this will be the fate of the rest of humanity after Metalunan relocation. Exeter believes that this is immoral and misguided.

Before the couple can be sent into the device, Exeter helps them escape. Exeter is badly injured by a mutant guard while he, Cal, and Ruth flee from Metaluna in the saucer. The planet&#x27;s ionization layer becomes totally ineffective as they leave. Under the constant Zagon bombardment, Metaluna begins heating up and turns into a lifeless &quot;radioactive sun&quot;. The mutant guard has also boarded the saucer and attacks Ruth, but dies as a result of the pressure barrier differences on the way back to Earth.

As they enter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, Exeter sends Cal and Ruth away in their Stinson aircraft, declining to join them. Exeter is dying and the ship&#x27;s energy is nearly depleted. The saucer flies out over the ocean, rapidly accelerates until it is enclosed in a fireball, and crashes into the water where it explodes.

==Cast==
* Jeff Morrow as Exeter
* Faith Domergue as Dr. Ruth Adams
* Rex Reason as Dr. Cal Meacham
* Lance Fuller as Brack
* Russell Johnson as Dr. Steve Carlson
* Douglas Spencer as The Monitor
* Robert Nichols as Joe Wilson
* Karl L. Lindt as Dr. Adolph Engelborg
* Orangey as Neutron the cat (uncredited)

==Production==
Principal photography for &quot;This Island Earth&quot; took place from January 30 to March 22, 1954. Location work took place at Mt. Wilson, California. Most of the Metaluna sequence was directed by Jack Arnold; the front office was apparently dissatisfied with the footage Newman shot and had it redone by Arnold, who unlike Newman had several sci-fiction films to his credit.

Most of the sound effects, the ship, the interocitor, etc. are simply recordings of radio teletype transmissions picked up on a short-wave radio played at various speeds. In a magazine article, the special effects department admitted that the &quot;mutant&quot; costume originally had legs that matched the upper body, but they had so much trouble making the legs look and work properly that they were forced by studio deadline to simply have the mutant wear a pair of trousers. Universal-International&#x27;s film posters show the mutant as it was supposed to appear.

This title was one of the very few &quot;flat widescreen&quot; titles to be printed direct-to-matrix by Technicolor. This specially ordered 35-millimeter printing process was intended to maintain the highest possible print quality, as well as to protect the film negative. Another Universal film that was also given the direct-to-matrix treatment was &quot;Written on the Wind&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box-office===
&quot;This Island Earth&quot; was released in June 1955, and by the end of that year had accrued US$1,700,000 in distributors&#x27; domestic (United States and Canada) rentals, making it the year&#x27;s 74th biggest earner.

===Critical response===
A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Howard Thompson stated: &quot;The technical effects of &quot;This Island Earth&quot;, Universal&#x27;s first science-fiction excursion in color, are so superlatively bizarre and beautiful that some serious shortcomings can be excused, if not overlooked.&quot; &quot;Whit&quot; in &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Special effects of the most realistic type rival the story and characterizations in capturing the interest in this exciting science-fiction chiller, one of the most imaginative, fantastic and conceived entries to date in the outer-space film field.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was also positive, calling it &quot;one of the most fascinating — and frightening — science-fiction movies to come at us yet from outer space ... To the camera and effects men must go the major laurels for making this wonders visible and audible — in awesome Technicolor and a sound track that is as ear-wracking as it is eerie.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; was less positive, writing: &quot;Faced with the wonders of space, man&#x27;s reactions prove, as usual, dreadfully limited. The dialogue—especially in the faked-up romance between Doctors Meacham and Adams—remains resolutely earth-bound, while the ending is simply a spacial variation on the conventional curtain. Joseph Newman has done his best to make his characters as intriguing as his special effects, but they have neither the stature nor the expression.&quot;

Since its original release, the critical response to the film has continued to be mostly positive. Bill Warren has written that the film was &quot;the best and most significant science fiction movie of 1955 … [it] remains a decent, competent example of any era&#x27;s science fiction output&quot;. In Phil Hardy&#x27;s &quot;The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Science Fiction&quot;, the film was described as &quot;a full-blooded space opera complete with interplanetary warfare and bug-eyed monsters ... the film&#x27;s space operatics are given a dreamlike quality and a moral dimension that makes the dramatic situation far more interesting&quot;. Danny Peary felt that the film was &quot;colorful, imaginative, gadget-laden sci-fi&quot;. At the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 75%, based upon 16 reviews. &quot;Greater Milwaukee Today&quot; described it as &quot;an appalling film&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* The design for the Metaluna Monitor has proved itself to be an iconic look for an alien, influencing even H. R. Giger&#x27;s design for the Xenomorphs in the Alien franchise. This has led to the design being used in several homages, as well as the Metaluna Monitor himself making appearances in various pieces of film, television, games, and other forms of pop culture.
* Castle Films released a 9-to-12-minute (depending on projector speed) 8 mm cutting from the film (with the retitle &quot;War of the Planets&quot;) for the home audience, beginning in 1961.
* In &quot;Explorers&quot; (1985), one of the films that protagonist Ben watches is &quot;This Island Earth&quot;. In that film and this one, the character builds a device with help from an alien so that they may meet.
* A brief homage to &quot;This Island Earth&quot; is seen in &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982). E.T. turns the television on during a showing of the film, at the scene when Cal and Ruth are being abducted by the aliens, and Cal says &quot;They&#x27;re pulling us up!&quot;
* A segment of the television series &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (season 2, episode 10, 1977) uses space battle footage from the film, and the alien planet shown is also recycled &quot;This Island Earth&quot; footage.
* The album &quot;Happy Together&quot; (1987) by the a cappella group The Nylons featured a track titled &quot;This Island Earth&quot;.
* The video game &quot;Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders&quot; (1988) contains key references to the film, such as large-headed aliens disguised as humans, communications through interstellar teleconferencing, and an aircraft being pulled into a flying saucer.
* Shock rock metal band GWAR&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;This Toilet Earth&quot; (1994), and its companion short-form film &quot;Skulhedface&quot;, contain numerous references to &quot;This Island Earth&quot;, including the title, an alien with an over-sized brain posing as a human, and communication between aliens using an interstellar teleconference device.
* New Jersey punk rock band The Misfits included a song tribute entitled &quot;This Island Earth&quot; on their album &quot;American Psycho&quot; (1997).
* The alien Orbitron, the Man from Uranus, from the 1960s toy line &quot;The Outer Space Men&quot;, also known as &quot;Colorform Aliens&quot;, is based on the Mutant.
* A fan of &quot;This Island Earth&quot;, comedian/musician Weird Al Yankovic, has featured the interocitor in both his film &quot;UHF&quot; (1989) and the music video for &quot;Dare to be Stupid&quot;.
* The Metaluna Mutant is one of the many alien monsters held captive at Area 52 in &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003). It is later one of the aliens released by Marvin the Martian so that it could stop the main characters from taking the &quot;Queen of Diamonds&quot; card.
* Experimental pop artist Eric Millikin created a large mosaic portrait of the Metaluna Mutant out of Halloween candy and spiders as part of his &quot;Totally Sweet&quot; series in 2013.
* &quot;This Island Earth&quot; is the film-within-the-film in &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie&quot;. In order to maintain a 73-minute runtime and to accommodate several &quot;host segments&quot;, &quot;This Island Earth&quot; was edited down by about 20 minutes. Writer/star Michael J. Nelson said that &quot;This Island Earth&quot; was chosen to mock because, he felt, &quot;nothing really happens&quot; and &quot;it violates all the rules of classical drama&quot;. Writer Kevin Murphy added that the film had many elements that the writing crew liked, such as &quot;A hero who&#x27;s a big-chinned white-guy scientist with a deep voice. A wormy sidekick guy. Huge-foreheaded aliens who nobody can quite figure out are aliens – there&#x27;s just &#x27;something different about them&#x27;. And a couple of rubber monsters who die on their own without the hero ever doing anything&quot;.
* In the &quot;Bad Bob&quot; episode of the animated series &quot;ReBoot&quot;, a binome asks if Bob&#x27;s car crash is due to a problem with its interocitor.
* Dan Aykroyd cited &quot;This Island Earth&quot; as inspiration in part for the Coneheads he created on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;—aliens whose large heads go largely unmentioned by the earthlings who observe them.
* A poster of the film appears in chapter 3, page 11 of the graphic novel &quot;Watchmen&quot;.

==Home media==
Shout! Factory released the film on Blu-ray with a new 4K scan of the interpositive in two different aspect ratios: 1.85:1 and 1.37:1. The 1:37:1 version is available for rental views on YouTube.

<text>Some of those who held the lead role as governor of Virginia never visited the New World and governed through deputies resident in the colony. Others, such as Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, held the lead role for many years but were in Virginia for only a short portion of that time and usually delegated responsibilities to others. Probably for those reasons, in many historical documents and references, the deputies and lieutenant governors who had the primary responsibility in Virginia are also often titled simply &quot;governor.&quot; Also, transportation from England routinely took several months and occasionally, much longer. Thus, dates may appear to overlap.
==Governor of Virginia (1585–1590)==
The first English attempt to colonize Virginia was the &quot;Lost Colony&quot; of Roanoke. Unsuccessful settlements were established under two different governors, and the final fate of the colonists remains unknown.
* Sir Walter Raleigh, Governor of Virginia (1585–1590, absentee)
** Sir Ralph Lane, Governor of Roanoke (Virginia) (1585–1586)
** John White, Governor of Raleigh (Virginia) (1587–1590)

==Virginia Company of London Governors (1607–1624)==
From 1606 until 1624, Proprietary Governors oversaw the operation of the Virginia Colony. Most were styled &quot;President of the Council&quot;, although some were styled &quot;governor&quot; by the proprietors.

# President of the Council Edward Maria Wingfield (1607)
# President of the Council John Ratcliffe (1608)
# Acting President Matthew Scrivener (1608)

==Crown Governors (1624–1652)==
After the Virginia Company of London lost its proprietary charter in 1624, the colony was taken over by the English Crown, and became a crown colony. Governors were appointed by the ruling monarch to oversee the interests of the Crown. During the interregnum period (1649–1660), when England came under commonwealth rule and the protectorate rule of Oliver and Richard Cromwell, those governments appointed Virginia&#x27;s governors. William Berkeley, who was governor at the time of the execution of King Charles I, remained in office until the arrival of a Commonwealth fleet in 1651 led to his removal. Berkeley was returned to office by votes of the Virginia assembly and by appointment of the restored King Charles II in 1660.

<doc id="876532" wikidata="Q12859415" url="?curid=876532" title="Pot Noodle">
<text>Pot Noodle is a brand of instant noodle snack foods from the United Kingdom, available in a selection of flavours and varieties. This dehydrated food consists of noodles, assorted dried vegetables and flavouring powder. It is prepared by adding boiling water, which rapidly softens the noodles and dissolves the powdered sauce.

The product is packaged in a plastic pot, from which the prepared noodles can be eaten. Many pots contain a sachet of sauce, such as soy sauce.

Certain flavours of Pot Noodle have &quot;King&quot; variants, which are large versions of the same flavour. 

==History==
Instant noodles were originally invented in 1958 by Momofuku Ando, and &quot;Cup Noodles&quot; developed by his company Nissin Food Products in 1971.

Golden Wonder launched the Pot Noodle brand in the United Kingdom in 1977. In July 1995, Best Foods, which produces Hellmanns mayonnaise, paid then owner Dalgety plc $280 million for its Golden Wonder Pot Noodle instant hot snacks manufacturing business.

Bestfoods, known as CPC international before 1997, was itself acquired by Unilever in June 2000. Unilever kept the Pot Noodle brand and its sole production factory, after it sold the rest of the Golden Wonder business in January 2006 to Tayto. In the same year, Unilever relaunched the brand, introduced three new varieties and reduced salt levels by 50 per cent. Golden Wonder later established another line of pot noodles called &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Noodle&quot; (renamed &quot;Noodle Pot&quot; in 2016) in direct competition with their former brand.

==Production==

Pot Noodles are manufactured in Croespenmaen, near Crumlin, Caerphilly, Wales, which became the topic of an advertising campaign of 2006, showing fictitious Pot Noodle mines in Wales. The factory typically produces 175 million pots annually.

Around 2006, Pot Noodle&#x27;s recipe was changed to make the product healthier. This mostly involved cutting down on the amount of salt in the product. A &quot;GTi&quot; variant, prepared in a microwave instead of adding boiling water, was introduced at the end of the 2000s and was the first Pot Noodle to contain real meat. In 2007, 2014, and 2023, the brand changed their logo.
Pot Noodle has often given promotional gifts away, including a &#x27;horn&#x27; and a &#x27;spinning fork.&#x27; During the 2008 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Unilever sponsored a musical directed by David Sant, and created by advertising agency Mother, set in a Pot Noodle factory.

==Controversies==
The Pot Noodle brand has been involved in a number of controversial advertising campaigns.

In January 2002, Irish politician Michael Ring TD, branded a Pot Noodle animated television advertisement as glorifying child neglect and demanded it be banned. The advertisement featured a young boy whose tongue was stuck to a frozen climbing frame. A supervisor went to get a sponge and boil a kettle of water to help free the child&#x27;s tongue but was distracted and instead used the hot water to make a Pot Noodle. Ring said &quot;the manufacturers have a responsibility to the public not to encourage youngsters to lick frozen pipes or suggest that adults should neglect a suffering child&quot;. 

In August 2002, a series of television adverts that described Pot Noodle as &quot;the slag of all snacks&quot; was withdrawn after complaints to the Independent Television Commission. The related poster campaign, revolving around the &quot;Hot Noodle&quot; range with a tagline of &quot;hurt me, you slag&quot; was withdrawn by Unilever after the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld complaints that &quot;the tone could be interpreted as condoning violence&quot;.

In May 2005, the Advertising Standards Authority received 620 complaints, about a series of advertisements featuring a man with a large brass horn in his trousers, with the suggestive slogan &quot;Have you got the Pot Noodle horn?&quot; Some of the complaints described them as &quot;tasteless and offensive.&quot; The three advertisements had been already approved for restricted times, primarily after the 9:00pm watershed. The ASA did not uphold the complaints. While it accepted the campaign was &quot;a little crude,&quot; they deemed it harmless and said that &quot;the timing restriction was appropriate.&quot;

In a September 2006 article headed &quot;Teach Pot Noodle teens to cook&quot; in Dublin&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; newspaper, Cavan chef Nevin Maguire on a recent school visit was shocked &quot;to see 60 per cent of Leaving Cert students had Pot Noodle for their lunch&quot;. Maguire, along with other celebrity chefs called for compulsory cookery lessons in Ireland&#x27;s schools for a &quot;new generation that thinks &#x27;food comes in a box&#x27;&quot;.

==Related products==

Golden Wonder introduced a similar convenience food &quot;Pot Rice&quot; at the beginning of the 1980s. Pot Rice was made from dehydrated rice, wheat protein, vegetables, and flavourings, sold in a plastic pot. Pot Rice was later manufactured by Unilever and Knorr when the Pot Noodle brand went through a series of acquisitions and takeovers in the 1990s.

Posh Noodle was a variation on the typical pot noodle, consisting of thinner, ramen like noodles and available in three Asian themed flavours, launched in 2003.

Pot Rice was discontinued at the beginning of the 2000s. Pot Rice flavours have included &quot;Chicken Risotto&quot;, &quot;Chicken Curry&quot;, &quot;Beef &amp; Tomato&quot; and &quot;Savoury Beef&quot;. Pot Rice received a limited relaunch in 2018. &quot;Pot Mash&quot; was a similar branded mashed potato snack, sold by the makers of Pot Noodle in the United Kingdom and Ireland at the end of the 1990s.

&quot;Pot Casserole&quot; consisting of dried vegetables and soya protein was introduced during the 1980s, but discontinued before the turn of the century. &quot;Pot Pasta&quot; and &quot;Pot Spaghetti&quot; combined dried pasta pieces with a sachet of Parmesan cheese, and was available for some time in the 1990s. However, in 2017, Pot Pasta was relaunched. &quot;Pot Sweet&quot; was a dessert range available in four varieties, introduced in the mid-1980s, and discontinued shortly afterwards.

In 2020, Lost the Pot Noodle, instant noodles in loose plastic packaging instead of a plastic pot, was launched in 3 flavours: curry, roast chicken and sweet chilli.

From August 2021, Pot Noodle launched another new range of pots, titled &#x27;Pot Noodle Fusions&#x27;. This range hearkened back to earlier ranges like &#x27;Posh Noodle&#x27; and &#x27;Asian Street Style&#x27; with more exotic world food flavours including Chilli Chicken, Katsu Curry and the previously available Thai Green Curry flavours, as a partial rebrand and partial new launch.

<doc id="876534" wikidata="Q1064276" url="?curid=876534" title="Full and faithful functors">
<text>In category theory, a faithful functor is a functor that is injective on hom-sets, and a full functor is surjective on hom-sets. A functor that has both properties is called a fully faithful functor.

==Formal definitions==
Explicitly, let &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; be (locally small) categories and let &quot;F&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; be a functor from &quot;C&quot; to &quot;D&quot;. The functor &quot;F&quot; induces a function
:formula_1
for every pair of objects &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;C&quot;. The functor &quot;F&quot; is said to be
*faithful if &quot;F&quot;&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot; is injective
*full if &quot;F&quot;&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot; is surjective
*fully faithful (= full and faithful) if &quot;F&quot;&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot; is bijective
for each &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;C&quot;.

==Properties==
A faithful functor need not be injective on objects or morphisms. That is, two objects &quot;X&quot; and &quot;X&quot;′ may map to the same object in &quot;D&quot; (which is why the range of a full and faithful functor is not necessarily isomorphic to &quot;C&quot;), and two morphisms &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;f&quot;′ : &quot;X&quot;′ → &quot;Y&quot;′ (with different domains/codomains) may map to the same morphism in &quot;D&quot;. Likewise, a full functor need not be surjective on objects or morphisms. There may be objects in &quot;D&quot; not of the form &quot;FX&quot; for some &quot;X&quot; in &quot;C&quot;. Morphisms between such objects clearly cannot come from morphisms in &quot;C&quot;.

A full and faithful functor is necessarily injective on objects up to isomorphism. That is, if &quot;F&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; is a full and faithful functor and formula_2 then formula_3.

==Examples==
* The forgetful functor &quot;U&quot; : Grp → Set maps groups to their underlying set, &quot;forgetting&quot; the group operation. &quot;U&quot; is faithful because two group homomorphisms with the same domains and codomains are equal if they are given by the same functions on the underlying sets. This functor is not full as there are functions between the underlying sets of groups that are not group homomorphisms. A category with a faithful functor to Set is (by definition) a concrete category; in general, that forgetful functor is not full.
* The inclusion functor Ab → Grp is fully faithful, since Ab (the category of abelian groups) is by definition the full subcategory of Grp induced by the abelian groups.

==Generalization to (∞, 1)-categories==
The notion of a functor being &#x27;full&#x27; or &#x27;faithful&#x27; does not translate to the notion of a (∞, 1)-category. In an (∞, 1)-category, the maps between any two objects are given by a space only up to homotopy. Since the notion of injection and surjection are not homotopy invariant notions (consider an interval embedding into the real numbers vs. an interval mapping to a point), we do not have the notion of a functor being &quot;full&quot; or &quot;faithful.&quot; However, we can define a functor of quasi-categories to be &quot;fully faithful&quot; if for every &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;C,&quot; the map formula_4 is a weak equivalence.

<doc id="876535" wikidata="Q7736839" url="?curid=876535" title="The Glory and the Dream">
<text>The Glory and the Dream: A Narrative History of America, 1932–1972 is a 1,400-page social history by William Manchester, first published in 1974. Sometimes sold as two volumes, it describes the history of the United States between 1932 and 1972. 

==Content==
The book details both social history and political machinations in the period with a focus on how the New Deal, the Second World War and the Cold War influenced American culture. Special attention is paid to Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal and the lasting effect it had on the U.S. government. Manchester simplifies the complex political maneuvers and opaque terminology that pervaded Cold War politics to more accessible language.

The book&#x27;s title is taken from William Wordsworth&#x27;s poem &quot;&quot;: &quot;Whither is fled the visionary gleam? / Where is it now, the glory and the dream?&quot;

==Release and reception==
&quot;The Glory and the Dream&quot; was listed as a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller in 1975. In &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, Michael Aitken called it &quot;a collossal piece of nostalgia that brings to mind G.K. Chesterton&#x27;s insight that the real American is all right: it is the ideal American who is all wrong.&quot;

The book was translated into Chinese by Dong Leshan.

<doc id="876542" wikidata="Q320915" url="?curid=876542" title="David Gray (British musician)">
<text>David Peter Gray (born 13 June 1968) is a British singer-songwriter. Having released his debut album in 1993, he received worldwide attention with &quot;White Ladder&quot; five years later, particularly for the hit single &quot;Babylon&quot;. &quot;White Ladder&quot; was the first of three chart-toppers in six years for Gray in the UK, where it became the fifth best-selling album of the 2000s. In 2019, it was ranked as the UK&#x27;s tenth best-selling album of the 21st century. David Gray reached the US Top 20 with five successive albums, and has received four Brit Award nominations, including two nominations for Best British Male.

==Career==
===Early life and career===
David Gray was born in 1968 in Sale, Cheshire, England. He was born with pyloric stenosis, which is a narrowing of the opening from the stomach to the first part of the small intestine. He was initially misdiagnosed, and nearly died from starvation. He lived in Altrincham before moving with his family at the age of nine to Solva, Pembrokeshire, Wales, where his parents took over a gift shop and started a clothing business. &quot;I had an amazing time growing up there... My imagination could run wild... It was that which gave me the kind of insane self-belief I have, and had even then, that I could do something as unlikely as play music for a living.&quot; He went to Ysgol Dewi Sant high school in nearby St Davids and then on to Carmarthenshire College of Art and finally Liverpool School of Art.

Gray&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;A Century Ends&quot; and &quot;Flesh&quot;, were issued in 1993 and 1994 respectively and led to Gray becoming popular in folk-rock circles, but both failed in terms of commercial sales. Simon Price wrote of Gray&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Birds Without Wings&quot;: &quot;He sounded like an anguished, intense troubadour, potentially a male PJ Harvey.&quot; In 1996 Gray released his third album, &quot;Sell, Sell, Sell&quot;. The album was recorded at Pyramid Sound Studios in Ithaca, New York. Despite his dislike of the album, Gray continued to maintain residence in Ithaca on and off over the years. Despite critical acclaim, the album did not chart, but the song &quot;Late Night Radio&quot; received some airplay on alternative UK radio stations. On the 1997 Mary Black album &quot;Shine&quot;, Gray contributed five songs.

===1998–2002: &quot;White Ladder&quot; and rise to fame===
Originally released on Gray&#x27;s own label IHT Records in November 1998, &quot;White Ladder&quot; was re-released in 2000 on EastWest internationally and on ATO Records in the US and Canada. The re-release brought him commercial success and critical attention. While his first three albums featured acoustic folk songs and guitar-based alternative rock, &quot;White Ladder&quot; introduced his now-trademark folktronic sound. The album included his best-known songs: &quot;This Year&#x27;s Love&quot;, &quot;Babylon&quot;, &quot;Please Forgive Me&quot; and &quot;Sail Away&quot;. After its re-release, combined with the release and success of single &quot;Babylon&quot;, it sold 100,000 copies in Ireland alone, making it number one for six weeks, and according to a 2012 report was the biggest-selling album ever in that country. In June 2000, &quot;Babylon&quot; hit No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart; it remains his biggest UK hit to date. In the United States, the album received a boost from jam-band leader Dave Matthews, who made it the first release by ATO Records, the record company he co-founded. &quot;Babylon&quot; was also the first of three US chart entries for Gray to date.
The album was No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, two years and five months after its original release, spending a total of 151 weeks on the chart. Aside from &quot;Please Forgive Me&quot;, which charted at No. 72 on the UK Singles Chart, all other single releases charted within the Top 20: the re-released &quot;Please Forgive Me&quot; charted at number 18, and &quot;Say Hello, Wave Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Sail Away&quot; peaked at number 26.

The year 2001 also saw the release of a rarities compilation of Gray&#x27;s early works, &quot;The EPs 1992-1994&quot;, as well as an album of previously unreleased songs recorded in 1999, &quot;Lost Songs 95-98&quot;, both of which followed &quot;White Ladder&quot; into the Top 20 in the UK Albums Chart. Gray also provided vocals on the electronic-based band Orbital&#x27;s 2001 single &quot;Illuminate&quot;.

In November 2002, Gray released the follow-up to &quot;White Ladder&quot;, entitled &quot;A New Day at Midnight&quot;. The new release did not receive the same critical acclaim as its predecessor, but still went straight in at number 1, famously beating &quot;Pop Idol&quot; runner-up Gareth Gates&#x27;s debut album &quot;What My Heart Wants to Say&quot; to the summit and selling nearly 150,000 copies in its first week of release. It went on to achieve platinum status within a year, eventually being certified four times platinum overall, and was the second-biggest selling album by a UK artist in 2002, behind &quot;Pop Idol&quot; winner Will Young&#x27;s debut album &quot;From Now On&quot;. &quot;A New Day at Midnight&quot; produced two further UK Top 30 hits in &quot;The Other Side&quot; and &quot;Be Mine&quot; and a minor US hit with &quot;Dead in the Water&quot;.

===Later career===

After a three-year hiatus which saw him wind down his recording and touring schedule due to exhaustion, Gray returned with his seventh album, &quot;Life in Slow Motion&quot;, in September 2005. Like its predecessor, it topped the UK Albums Chart in its first week of release. After the much-criticised &quot;A New Day at Midnight&quot;, &quot;Life in Slow Motion&quot; was hailed as a return to form by many critics. Lead single &quot;The One I Love&quot; was a Top 10 hit in the UK in October 2005 and spent three months in the UK chart. Following the relative commercial failure of follow-up singles &quot;Hospital Food&quot; and &quot;Alibi&quot;, Gray again went into hiatus during 2006.

In March 2007, Gray released the compilation album &quot;&quot;. On 7 July 2007, Gray performed with Damien Rice at the UK leg of Live Earth at Wembley Stadium in London. Gray released a compilation CD of live covers entitled &quot;A Thousand Miles Behind&quot; exclusively through his official website on 8 October that year on CD and digital download. On 13 November, Gray released the album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, which includes many of his best known songs as well as two new songs, including the lead single &quot;You&#x27;re the World to Me&quot;.

On 28 May 2009, Gray announced that his album &quot;Draw the Line&quot; would be released on 14 September in the UK and on 22 September in the United States. The album features guest appearances by Annie Lennox and Jolie Holland. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Fugitive&quot;, was released on 7 September 2009, coinciding with the start of an expansive world tour. On 19 September, Gray performed his self-proclaimed first pool-side concert at the Rooftop Pool at The Colonnade Hotel in Boston for the Mix 104.1 &quot;End of Summer Bash&quot;. Gray performed songs from the new album, including &quot;Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Draw the Line&quot; and &quot;Jackdaw&quot;.

In an interview for &quot;Hot Press&quot;, released on 3 December 2009, Gray revealed to Jackie Hayden that he was working on his next album, &quot;Foundling&quot;. Gray said that one of the tracks would be called &quot;The Old Chair&quot;, which, according to Gray, &quot;features just a drum kit and me on my Steinway piano. It&#x27;s very quiet.&quot; &quot;Foundling&quot; was released in the UK on 16 August. and in the United States on 17 August. &quot;Foundling&quot; is a double album: the first CD consists of 11 new songs and the second consists of eight previously unreleased songs. A ninth is available via iTunes.

David Gray signed a global agreement with Kobalt Label Services for the release of his 10th studio album, &quot;Mutineers&quot;. His first in four years, it was recorded at The Church Studios in London and produced by Andy Barlow (Lamb). The release took place on 17 June 2014. It was announced that Gray would support the new release with a North American tour through April and May, followed by an eight-date UK tour in June and July that included a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

&quot;The Best of David Gray&quot; was released on CD, double CD and LP in October 2016, and included two new recordings. The album, released in conjunction with IHT Records, had already been released as a dynamic playlist on Spotify that automatically changed shape every week Gray commented: &quot;What we have on our hands is an ever-evolving &#x27;Best Of&#x27; that is different every week, every month, every year, every decade.&quot;

In March 2019, Gray released his 11th record, &quot;Gold in a Brass Age&quot;. It was produced by Ben de Vries, son of producer Marius de Vries, and was seen largely as a return to his signature &quot;folktronica&quot; sound.

In the year 2020, Gray released a 20th anniversary edition of &quot;White Ladder&quot;. A deluxe set with bonus tracks and demos was also made available on both CD and vinyl formats. He embarked on an international tour to celebrate the anniversary, starting in Europe in February, but it was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gray announced on 20 May 2020 via his social media channels that the tour had to be postponed. The tour kicked off in Belfast on the 17th of May 2022 nearly two years to the day it was cancelled. Gray has always credited Ireland for boosting his career with the original sales of White Ladder so it felt fitting to start the tour in Ireland.

Gray released his 12th studio album on 19 February 2021. Entitled &quot;Skellig&quot; (named after the Skellig Islands in County Kerry, Ireland) it featured a title track and a single called &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;. It was recorded at Edwyn Collins&#x27; Helmsdale studio in Sutherland and features David Kitt, Rob Malone and producer Ben de Vries as musicians on the record.

==Musical style==
Gray&#x27;s early music was in a contemporary folk-rock, singer-songwriter mode; his primary instrument was acoustic guitar, with occasional piano. 1996&#x27;s &quot;Sell, Sell, Sell&quot; featured some rock arrangements and electric instrumentation. Starting with the release of &quot;White Ladder&quot;, Gray began to make significant use of computer-generated music to accompany his voice and acoustic instrumentation. &quot;A New Day at Midnight&quot; continued this direction, although lyrically it was darker in tone than &quot;White Ladder&quot; and the instrumentation much more downbeat. In the liner notes, Gray dedicated the album to his father, who died in 2001. Despite the move to more complex music, Gray has used small-scale, often home-based, recording methods and equipment and espoused a do-it-yourself approach to music production. However, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Life in Slow Motion&quot; was a collaboration with the record producer Marius de Vries.

Gray is noted for his &#x27;bobble-headed&#x27; style of performing, often rocking his head in time vigorously to the music. Gray himself would comically play up this trait in the video for &quot;Be Mine&quot;, in which his head eventually rolls off his body and gets thrown around in a variety of different locations.

<text>Christian Dalmau (born August 29, 1975) is a Puerto Rican retired professional basketball player, and current head coach of the Indios de Mayagüez in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN). He is the second son of the legendary Puerto Rican basketball star Raymond Dalmau. Dalmau has played in the NCAA, the National Basketball Development League, and the Baloncesto Superior Nacional in Puerto Rico. Dalmau has played internationally in Turkey, Poland, and Israel. Dalmau was a member of the Puerto Rican National Basketball Team that defeated the United States in the 2004 Olympic Games.

==Biography==
After playing college basketball in the NCAA, Dalmau began his professional career in 1993 with the Piratas de Quebradillas in Puerto Rico&#x27;s top level Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN). As a rookie, he showed great potential but the team decided to trade him for more experienced players. His new team was the Maratonistas de Coamo where he would become a star. Dalmau joined the BSN&#x27;s new Avancinos de Villalba in 1996, playing there from 1996 to 1998. When Villalba folded after its third season, Dalmau returned to Coama for two seasons, then was traded to the Atleticos de San German in 2001.

In the 2002–2003 season, Dalmau signed with the Mobile Revelers of the National Basketball Development League. Dalmau was named &quot;Most Valuable Player&quot; in 2004. That same year he was selected to replace his brother, Richie, on the Puerto Rican National Basketball Team. He played in the Israeli Basketball League with Hapoel Galil Elyon. From 2005 to 2007, Dalmau played in Poland with Prokom Trefl Sopot.

For the 2007–08 season, Dalmau played with Beşiktaş Cola Turka of the Turkish League. In July 2008 he signed a contract with PBC Ural Great Perm in Russian Basketball Super League 1.

In 2009, Dalmau returned to the BSN to play for the Vaqueros de Bayamón. He led the team to victory at the 2009 BSN Championship, and was chosen as the 2009 BSN Finals MVP. In 2010, after being named the league&#x27;s MVP during the regular season, Dalmau led Bayamón to their second straight BSN Finals appearance, losing at home in game seven to the Capitanes de Arecibo.

After the 2012 BSN season with Bayamón, now in his late 30s, Dalmau moved to a number of teams, in different leagues, over the next five seasons. In the BSN, he played with the Mets de Guaynabo, Cangrejeros de Santurce and returned to his rookie team, the Piratas de Quebradillas. He also played with Halcones Xalapa in Mexico&#x27;s Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional.

Dalmau returned to Bayamón in 2017, retiring from playing basketball at the end of that season.

In 2018, Dalmau became head coach of the senior boys basketball team at Central Pointe Christian Academy, a small prep high school in Kissimmee, Florida. In March 2020, the team won the Sunshine Independent Athletic Association championship.

<doc id="876545" wikidata="Q19030" url="?curid=876545" title="Extensor digiti minimi muscle">
<text>The extensor digiti minimi (extensor digiti quinti proprius) is a slender muscle of the forearm, placed on the ulnar side of the extensor digitorum communis, with which it is generally connected.

It arises from the common extensor tendon by a thin tendinous slip and frequently from the intermuscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles.

Its tendon passes through a compartment of the extensor retinaculum, posterior to distal radio-ulnar joint, then divides into two as it crosses the dorsum of the hand, and finally joins the extensor digitorum tendon. All three tendons attach to the dorsal digital expansion of the fifth digit (little finger). There may be a slip of tendon to the fourth digit.

== Variations ==
* An additional fibrous slip from the lateral epicondyle: The tendon of insertion may not divide or may send a slip to the ring finger.
* Absence of the muscle is rare; fusion of the belly with the extensor digitorum communis is not uncommon.
* Variations of the fifth extensor compartment, which the extensor digiti minimi runs through, may cause tenosynovitis and can limit the use of the extensor digiti minimi.
* The extensor digiti minimi can also be bifurcated, which means split, at many different points in the muscle.

==Functions==
The extensor digiti minimi is a two joint muscle. It acts as an extensor in both joints. It extends the wrist, which means it moves the back of the hand toward the back of the forearm. It also extends the little finger, which means it straightens the little finger from a fist.

<doc id="876547" wikidata="Q842595" url="?curid=876547" title="Big wave surfing">
<text>Big wave surfing is a discipline within surfing in which surfers paddle into, or are towed into, waves that are at least 20 feet (6.2 m) high, on surf boards known as &quot;guns&quot; or towboards. The size of the board needed to successfully surf these waves varies by the size of the wave, as well as the technique the surfer uses to reach it. A larger, longer board enables a rider to paddle fast enough to catch the wave and has the advantage of being more stable, but it also limits maneuverability and surfing speed.

In 1992, big wave surfers such as Buzzy Kerbox, Laird Hamilton and Darrick Doerner introduced a cross-over variation called tow-in surfing. While many riders still participate in both activities, they remain very distinct. Tow-in surfing involves being towed in to big waves by jet ski, creating the speed needed to successfully ride them. Tow-in surfing also revolutionized board size, allowing surfers to trade in their unwieldy 12 ft. boards in favor of light, 7 ft boards that enabled more speed and easier maneuvrability in waves over 30 ft (10m). By the end of the 1990s, tow-in surfing meant that surfers could ride waves exceeding 50 ft (15m).

==Hazards of big wave surfing==
In a big wave wipeout, a breaking wave can push surfers down 20 to 50 feet (6.2 m to 15.5 m) below the surface. Once they stop spinning around, they have to quickly regain their equilibrium and figure out which way is up. Surfers may have less than 20 seconds to get to the surface before the next wave hits them. Additionally, the water pressure at a depth of 20 to 50 feet can be strong enough to rupture human eardrums. Strong currents and water action at those depths can also slam a surfer into a reef or the ocean floor, which can result in severe injuries or even death.

One of the greatest dangers is the risk of being held underwater by two or more consecutive waves. Surviving a triple hold-down is extremely difficult, and surfers must be prepared to cope with these situations.

A major issue argued between big-wave surfers is the necessity of the leash on the surfboard. In many instances, the leash can do more harm than good to a surfer, catching and holding them underwater and diminishing their opportunities to fight towards the surface. Other surfers, however, depend on the leash. Today, tow-in surfboards are equipped with foot holds (like those found on windsurfs) instead of leashes, in order to provide some security to the surfer without generating safety hazards whilst the surfer is underwater.

These hazards have killed several big-wave surfers. Some of the most notable are Mark Foo, who died surfing Mavericks on 23 December 1994; Donnie Solomon, who died exactly a year later at Waimea Bay; Todd Chesser, who died at Alligator Rock on the North Shore of Oahu on 14 February 1997; Peter Davi, who died at Ghost Trees on 4 December 2007; Sion Milosky, who died surfing Mavericks on 16 March 2011; and Kirk Passmore, who died at Alligator Rock on 12 November 2013.

==Paddle-in surfing==
On 18 January 2010
Danilo Couto and Marcio Freire became the first to surf Jaws Peahi paddling, surfing the wave to the left side. They did not have jetski support and used only their shorts and their surfboards. They were the only ones to surf Jaws paddling until 4 January 2012, when it was surfed to the right side for the first time.

On 4 January 2012, Greg Long, Ian Walsh, Kohl Christensen, Jeff Rowley, Dave Wassel, Shane Dorian, Mark Healey, Carlos Burle, Nate Fletcher, Garrett McNamara, Kai Barger, North Shore locals and other of the best big-wave surfers in the world invaded the Hawaiian Islands for a historic day of surfing. Surfers had to catch and survive the wave at Jaws Peahi, on the north shore of Maui, without the use of a jet ski.

Jeff Rowley made Australian history by being the first Australian to paddle into a 50-foot plus (15m) wave at Jaws Peahi, Hawaii, achieving his &#x27;Charge for Charity&#x27; mission set for 2011, to raise money for Breast Cancer Australia.

On 30–31 January 2012, Jeff Rowley and a number of international big wave surfers including Greg Long, Shaun Walsh and Albee Layer spent two days paddle-surfing Jaws, on the Hawaiian island of Maui, as part of their ongoing big-wave paddle-in program at the deep-water reef, further cementing the new frontier of paddle-in surfing at Jaws.

On 12 March 2012, Jeff Rowley paddled into Mavericks Left, California, and became the first Australian to accomplish this task. Mavericks is traditionally known as a right-hander wave and Rowley pushed the boundaries of what was possible at the Mavericks left-hander, a task that wasn&#x27;t without its challenges, requiring a vertical drop into the wave.

On 30 March 2012, Jeff Rowley was a finalist in the Billabong XXL Big Wave Awards 2011/2012, in the Ride of the Year category with his rides at Jaws Peahi in Maui, Hawaii on 30 January 2012, placing 4th place in the world of elite big wave surfers.

== Big wave surfing world records ==

=== Male ===
German surfer Sebastian Steudtner broke the record in October 2020 off the coast of Praia do Norte, Nazaré, Portugal, when he surfed through an wave.

=== Female ===
According to Guinness World Records, Australian Laura Enever holds the women&#x27;s big wave record, surfing a wave in Oahu in January 2023 to break the world record by 30cm. However, the record is not without controversy, as she wiped out at the base of the wave, and it has even been claimed that Justine Dupont rode a wave (although she, too, is said to have wiped out), although this claim has not been ratified by Guinness.

==Big Wave Surfing Contest==

The oldest and most prestigious big wave contest is The Eddie, named after Oahu north shore Hawai&#x27;ian lifeguard and surfer Eddie Aikau. The competition window is between 1 December and the last day of February annually.

Another big wave surfing contest hosted by Red Bull is held at Jaws Peahi, with invitation of 21 of the best big wave surfers in the world. The waiting period for the contest is from 7 December to 15 March. Some of the known invitees to the contest include Jeff Rowley, Albee Layer, Greg Long, Shane Dorian, Kai Lenny, Ian Walsh.

From 1999 to 2016, Mavericks was a premier big wave contest. The first year&#x27;s results were first place, Darryl Virostko (&quot;Flea&quot;); second place, Richard Schmidt (surfer); third place, Ross Clarke-Jones; and fourth place, Peter Mel. This contest was last held in 2016, and has been indefinitely cancelled by the World Surf League.

Beginning in 2014–15, the World Surf League (WSL) has sanctioned the Big Wave World Tour (BWWT). On 28 February 2015, Makua Rothman became the first WSL BWWT Champion with 20,833 points outscoring the runner-up, Gabriel Villaran of Peru, by almost 7,000 points.

On 11 November 2016, Paige Alms of Maui was crowned the first women&#x27;s big wave surfing champion at Jaws on Maui during the Pe&#x27;ahi Women&#x27;s Challenge which was part of the Women&#x27;s Big Wave Tour #1 held 15 Oct – 11 November 2016, at Haiku, Hawaii. This was the first big wave surfing contest ever held for women. The results were in first place Paige Alms (Hawaii), second place Justine Dupont (France), third place Felicity Palmateer (Australia), and tied for fourth place Keala Kennelly (Hawaii), Emily Erickson (Hawaii), and Laura Enever (Australia).

==Big Wave Surfing Awards==
Since 2005, the world&#x27;s best big wave surfers gather in &quot;Surf City&quot; Huntington Beach, California, for the annual World Surf League (WSL) Big Wave Awards hosted by surfer Strider Wastlewski. The gala ceremony is currently held at the Pasea Hotel and Spa and nominated surfers are awarded for their greatest rides of the past year and the big wave community is celebrated.

The event raises the bar every year, with $350,000 in prize money allotted across seven categories: 
*&quot;XXL Biggest Wave&quot;
*&quot;Biggest Paddle Wave&quot;
*&quot;Tube of the Year&quot;
*&quot;Best Overall Performance&quot;
*&quot;Women&#x27;s Performance&quot;
*&quot;Wipeout Award&quot;
*&quot;Ride of the Year&quot;.

The seven winners are given top honors and a TAG Heuer watch for another WSL big wave season.

<text>The Supercopa de España, also known as the Spanish Super Cup, is a super cup tournament in Spanish football. Founded in 1982 as a two-team competition, the current version has been contested since 2020 by four teams: the winners and runners-up of the Copa del Rey and La Liga.

Until 1995, a team that won both the league and cup automatically got the trophy. From 1996 to 2019, if a team won both, they had to play the cup runners-up for the Supercopa. Since its inception, thirteen teams have participated in the tournament, and ten have been crowned champions.

Barcelona is the reigning champion after defeating Real Madrid in the final of the 2025 edition held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Barcelona is also the most successful team with fifteen titles, followed by Real Madrid with thirteen. Athletic Club and Deportivo La Coruña each have three titles, with Deportivo notably winning every edition they have participated in. Lionel Messi is the competition&#x27;s all-time top scorer and the most successful player, with eight titles.

==History==
The current competition has existed since 1982. Between 1940 and 1953, several other tournaments between the Spanish league champions and the cup winners (then &quot;Copa del Generalísimo&quot;) were played.

In September 1940, a match with this format had the name of Copa de Campeones. It was not repeated until December 1945 when, due to the good relations with the Spanish military government the ambassador of Argentina, offered a trophy called Copa de Oro Argentina. Both these trophies were unofficial and were only played once.

In 1941 the Copa Presidente FEF was established as an official tournament founded and organized by the RFEF; however, it was also only contested once, and though 11 of the 12 matches in its mini-league format were played between April and May 1941, its last, decisive fixture was delayed until eventually taking place in September 1947.

Also in 1947, the Copa Eva Duarte was established as an annual and official tournament founded and organized by the RFEF, as a tribute to Argentine president Juan Domingo Perón and his wife María Eva Duarte de Perón. It was played between September and December, usually as one-match finals. The trophy was the predecessor of the current Supercopa de España, first held in 1982.

In 2018, the Supercopa was played for the first time as a single match hosted at a neutral venue in Tangier, Morocco.

On 12 November 2019, it was announced that the Supercopa would expand to four teams, the winners and runners-up of the Copa del Rey and La Liga, and would be held at King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia for the next three years, in a deal valued at €120 million. The event was also moved to January in order to reduce the &quot;congestion&quot; on teams&#x27; schedules. The agreement has faced criticism: Jesus Alvarez, head of sport programming for state broadcaster RTVE, stated that it would not bid for the media rights to the Supercopa, in protest of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s human and women&#x27;s rights records—especially in women&#x27;s sports. Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional president Javier Tebas also criticized the decision, citing the human rights violations and the country&#x27;s &quot;pirating&quot; of European football (in reference to pirate broadcaster beoutQ). In the past, Tebas had been a major advocate to hold the competition outside of Spain, and especially the United States, as part of his efforts to expand La Liga globally. RFEF president Luis Rubiales stated that women would be able to attend the matches without restriction, and defended the agreement as the use of football to &quot;transform society&quot;.

Neither the Copa del Rey nor La Liga winners reached the Supercopa de España final in the first three editions of the four-team format. In June 2021, the extension of the agreement with Saudi Arabia for ten years was announced, to continue playing the tournament in the country until at least 2029.

<text>Yonsei University () is a private Christian research university located in Seoul, South Korea. Yonsei is one of the three most prestigious universities in the country, part of a group referred to as SKY universities.

The university traces its roots to the first modern medical center in Korea, &quot;Gwanghyewon&quot; (광혜원 廣惠院, House of Extended Grace) founded in April 1885, now Severance Union Medical College (세브란스 의과대학; 세브란스 醫科大學). The institution in its current university form was established in January 1957 through the union of Yonhi College () and Severance. As a tribute, the name &quot;Yonsei&quot; was derived from the first syllables of the names of its two parent institutions, &quot;Yon; 연; 延&quot; from Yonhi College and &quot;Sei; 세; 世&quot; from Severance Union Medical College. Yonhi College was one of the first modern colleges, founded as Chosun Christian College () in March 1915. The union was a result of a lasting bilateral cooperation between the colleges that began in the 1920s. The institutions were the first of their kinds in Korea. 

The student body consists of 18,200 undergraduate students, 11,632 graduate students, 4,518 faculty members, 6,788 staff, and 257,931 alumni. Yonsei operates its main campus in Seoul and offers graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs in Korean and English. Graduates of Yonsei include a Nobel laureate, an Academy Award winner, Olympians, and a Fulkerson Prize-winning mathematician.

== History ==

=== Beginnings (1885–1916) ===

The Yonsei University Medical School dates to April 10, 1885, when the first modern hospital to practice Western medicine in Korea, &quot;Gwanghyewon&quot;, was established.
The hospital was founded by Horace Newton Allen, the American Protestant missionary appointed to Korea by the Presbyterian Church in the USA. The hospital was renamed Chejungwon (제중원 濟衆院, House of Universal Helpfulness) on April 26. As there appeared difficulties, the church appointed Canadian Oliver R. Avison to run &quot;Chejungwon&quot; on July 16, 1893. &quot;Gwanghyewon&quot; was financed at first by the Korean government, while the medical staff was provided by the church. However, by 1894 when the First Sino-Japanese War and Gabo reforms took place, the government was not able to continue its financial support, thus management of &quot;Chejungwon&quot; came fully under the church. In 1899, Avison returned to the US and attended a conference of missionaries in New York City where he elaborated on the medical project in Korea. Louis Severance, a businessman and philanthropist from Cleveland, Ohio, was present and was deeply moved. He later paid for the major portion of the construction costs of new buildings for the medical facility. &quot;Chejungwon&quot; was renamed Severance Hospital after him.

&quot;Chejungwon&quot; (later Severance Hospital) was primarily a hospital, but it also performed medical education as an attachment. The hospital admitted its first class of 16 medical students selected through examinations in 1886, one year after its establishment. By 1899, Chejungwon Medical School was independently recognized. Following the increase of diversity in missionary denominations in Korea, collaboration began to form. &quot;Chejungwon&quot; began to receive medical staff, school faculty, and financial support from the Union Council of Korean Missionaries () in 1912. Accordingly, the medical school was renamed as Severance Union Medical College in 1913.

The rest of Yonsei University traces its origins to Chosun Christian College, which was founded on March 5, 1915, by an American Protestant missionary, Horace Grant Underwood sent by the church. Underwood became the first president, and Avison became the vice president. It was located at the YMCA. Courses began in April with 81 students and 18 faculty members.

Underwood died of illness on October 12, 1916, and Avison took over as president.

===During World Wars I and II (1916-1946) ===
On August 22, 1910, Japan annexed Korea with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910. The first Governor-General of Korea, Terauchi Masatake, introduced the &quot;Ordinance on Chosun Education&quot; () in 1911, and subsequently &quot;Regulations on Professional Schools&quot; () and &quot;Revised Regulations on Private Schools&quot; () in March, 1915. These were intended to stifle private education in Korea; any establishment of schools, any change in school regulations, location, purpose, coursework, or textbooks must all be reported to and authorized by the governor-general, and all courses must be in Japanese.

Severance Union College struggled to meet these requirements; school regulations and coursework were altered, faculty evaluated and enlarged, its foundation and its board clarified. It received its recognition as a professional medical school on May 14, 1917. In 1922 the governor-general Makoto Saito issued &quot;Revised Ordinance on Chosun Education&quot; (). It called for stricter qualifications for the faculty, and Severance complied and further recruited more members with degrees from accredited institutions in North America and Europe. Japan did not completely ignore the competence of this institution; in 1923, Severance recovered its right to give medical licenses to its graduates without state examination, a right that had been lost since 1912. Moreover, in March 1934, the Japanese Ministry of Education and Culture further recognized Severance in allowing its graduates the right to practice medicine anywhere in Japanese sovereignty. Oh Geung Seon () became the first Korean president of Severance in 1934.
Ordinances in 1915 and 1922 also affected the fate of Chosun Christian College. Intended as a college, it was not legally recognized as such, since the Ordinance of 1915 did not allow the establishment of Korean private colleges. Hence, Chosun Christian College, now renamed Yonhi College, was accepted only as a &quot;professional school&quot; on April 17, 1917, by then a joint project from diverse missionary denominations. However, Yonhi had formed the organization and faculty becoming a university. It consisted of six departments: humanities, agriculture, commerce, theology (this department did not open due to differences among the founding denominations), mathematics and physics, and applied chemistry. The ordinances, furthermore, prohibited coursework in Korean history, its geography, or in the Bible outside the department of theology. The council of missionaries reacted with &quot;A Resolution on the Revised Educational Ordinance&quot; (), which carefully pointed out that Japan did not apply such rigorous absurdities to its private schools in mainland Japan.

After the March First Independence Movement swept the peninsula in 1919, Japan somewhat relaxed its grip on Korea, and this is reflected in the Ordinance of 1922. It ceased the arbitrary control of governor-general over the coursework and the qualification of faculty members, and altered its stance on strict separation of religion from all education. It also recognized Yonhi as a professional school equal to its counterparts in Japan, and permitted the Christian programs and the Bible in its coursework. Nevertheless, Japanese literature became mandatory. Under Japanese intervention, Korean history was taught under the name Eastern History, and the Korean language was taught whenever possible.
The Department of Agriculture was closed after 1922 when its first graduates left Yonhi. Efforts were made to revive this department, without much success. However, Yonhi installed a training center for agricultural leaders on campus and its programs saw large numbers of participants.
Yonhi was liberal in its admission of non-Christians. Its policy was to admit non-Christians relatively freely and allow the majority of Christian students to gradually influence and assimilate them.
In the late 1930s, Japan again shifted its policy towards Korea to incorporate it into its scheme of expansionism. In August 1936, the new Japanese Governor-General Jirō Minami began the assimilation of Koreans, to exploit them for military purposes; The governor-general enforced Sōshi-kaimei and Shinto on Koreans, and began to recruit Koreans for Japanese war efforts. In April 1938, the third &quot;Ordinance on Chosun Education&quot; ordered the acceptance of Shinto, the voluntary removal of the Korean language in coursework, and further intensification of Japanese and Japanese history education. Yonhi Professional School did not follow suit and opened courses on the study of the Korean language in November 1938. This was not tolerated for long: In March 1940, Yonhi was forced to open courses in Japanese studies for each department and each year. In 1938, English classes began to come under pressure following a deterioration of relations between Japan and the United States; coursework in English was forbidden and texts of English writers were censored. In 1938, President H.H. Underwood accepted the practice of Shinto to avoid Yonhi&#x27;s potential closure. Governors-General pushed Yonhi to refuse financial support from United States and financial difficulties mounted. American and British trustees and instructors were removed from the school in December 1941 upon the beginning of the Pacific War, and the government took direct control of the school in August 1942.

===During the Korean War (1946–1952)===

Severance was approved as a college by the liberated Korean government in 1947. Since most medical institutions in Korea were run by the Japanese, medical staff and faculty were in short supply after their departure. Thus, many members of Severance staff and faculty left to assist other institutions. Severance took up the role of student leadership and was outspoken against US-Soviet occupation. In 1950, during the outbreak of the Korean War, Severance functioned as a field hospital until Seoul was overrun. Severance fled quickly, but some faculty members and students were unable to leave in time; some were killed and others were captured then exploited by the advancing North Koreans. Severance seniors joined the military as army surgeons. Although Severance returned to Seoul for a while after its recapture, it had to flee again on December 17, 1950, carrying its medical equipments on a LST: Severance departed from Incheon and arriving in Busan and eventually relocating to Geoje and maintained a presence there until 1952. When Severance arrived in Busan, its medical school joined the wartime college, a temporary body. Meanwhile, the Severance facility in Seoul received heavy damage, as it was in the center of the city near Seoul Station. Severance Hospital again returned on April 1, 1952, and its medical college on June 12, 1952.
The US military neglected the restitution of Yonhi and held other plans to use it as a military hospital or judiciary training center. With time, nevertheless, Yonhi came to be viewed as a missionary institution that was dispossessed by the governor-general.
Yonhi was able to open its doors again on January 21, 1946, and, on August 15, 1946, was recognized as a university. In December 1948, plans for the unification of Yonhi and Severance began to take form. The Graduate School was formed in July 1950.

On May 10, 1950, Yonhi graduated the first post-colonial class, however in June all progress came to a halt due to the Korean War. The university suspended all courses on June 27 and recruited student soldiers. The North Korean military advanced into the Yonhi campus and established its headquarters there. This was a cause of severe damage to the campus when the US military recaptured Seoul in September. The university reopened following the recapture of Seoul, but it was once more on the run to Busan in December. In February 1951, Yonhi joined the wartime college, however, it kept an independent body and opened its own courses on October 3, 1951. On April 15, 1953, Yonhi began its work on restoration; Yonhi returned to its campus in the fall.

=== Postwar (1953–1959)===

In 1957, Severance Medical College and Hospital and Yonhi University merged to form Yonsei University.

==Culture==

===University symbols===
The &quot;ㅇ&quot; and &quot;ㅅ&quot; in the University arms are derived from the first letters of &quot;연세&quot; (&quot;Yonsei&quot; in Korean).The circle &quot;ㅇ&quot; represents the ideal of a complete and well-rounded person, while the &quot;ㅅ&quot; symbolizes the upward-looking pursuit for scholarly excellence. In addition, the &quot;ㅇ&quot; stands for Heaven; the &quot;-&quot; represents the horizon of the Earth and &quot;ㅅ&quot; signifies &quot;man,&quot; as expressed in the Chinese character (人). The open book stands for truth; the torchlight signifies freedom; and the arms, as a whole, protects these two core principles of the university.

The university&#x27;s mascot is an eagle, and its color is &quot;royal blue&quot;.

===Christianity===
Yonsei University is founded on Christian principles and purporting to &quot;produce Christian leaders with the spirits of freedom and truth&quot;. The Christian character of the university is well illustrated by its history as a school founded by American Protestant missionaries and by its school motto from the Bible, &quot;The truth will set you free&quot; (John 8:32). As of 2007, the Board of directors of Yonsei University should include a member from four Korean Christian organizations: The Presbyterian Church of Korea (), the Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea (), the Korean Methodist Church (), and the Anglican Church of Korea (). In Korea and Japan, Christian schools founded by Christian organizations or individuals, especially by Western missionaries, such as Yonsei University, are commonly called mission schools.

A school&#x27;s founding ideology and a student&#x27;s freedom of religion has been debated in South Korean society for some time. As of 2009, a student does not have to be an active Christian to be admitted to Yonsei University.

In 2010, Yonsei University entered an agreement with The United Methodist Church, in which the university will serve as the regional office for the Methodist Global Education Fund for Leadership Development.

==Student life==

====Rivalry with Korea University====

Each claiming to be the best private university in South Korea, Yonsei University and Korea University have had a long-standing athletic rivalry. The rivalry is well-illustrated by famous annual sports matches between them. This event, starting in 1925, is called KoYon Jeon () when Korea University hosts the matches and YonKo Jeon () when Yonsei University hosts the matches. However, the above official name is actually used only for official appearances such as broadcasting and newspaper reports. &#x27;YonKo Jeon&#x27; is commonly used in Yonsei University and &#x27;KoYon Jeon&#x27; is generally used in Korea University. The annual one-time matches include soccer, baseball, basketball, rugby, and ice hockey. With the founding of the U-League, the two institutions also meet in the league matches for all sports except rugby.

The events draw large numbers of student spectators, as well as celebrities and professional athletes. Prior to the YonKo Jeon, students from both universities also gather for the Yonsei-Korea University Joint Cheering Event () where students practice their cheers and show school spirit.

<text>Russell Alexander Alger ( ; February 27, 1836 – January 24, 1907) was an American politician and businessman. He served as the 20th governor of Michigan, U.S. Senator, and U.S. Secretary of War. Alger&#x27;s life was a &quot;rags-to-riches&quot; success tale. He became an army officer, financier, lumber baron, railroad owner, and government official in several high offices. He was supposedly a distant relation of author Horatio Alger.

==Early life and career==
Russell Alexander Alger was born on February 27, 1836, in Lafayette Township, Medina County, Ohio. His parents were Russell and Caroline Alger (née Moulton). Hailing from a New England family, his ancestors came from England to Massachusetts in 1759.

His parents died in 1848, leaving Russell the oldest of three orphan children, without money and with a brother and sister to care for and support. He had been accustomed to working for the neighbors for a small quantity of provisions or a few pennies a day even before the death of his parents, who were very poor.

He now found homes for his brother and sister and secured work for himself on a farm, his remuneration being his board, clothes and the privilege of attending school three months out of the year. He attended Richfield Academy in Summit County, Ohio, and taught country school for two winters.

He studied law in Akron, Ohio, and was admitted to the bar in March 1859. He first began to practice law in Cleveland. In 1860, he moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, and engaged in the lumber business.

==Civil War==
Alger enlisted as a private soldier in the American Civil War on September 2, 1861. He was commissioned and served as a captain and major in the 2nd Michigan Cavalry Regiment. In three years, he served in 66 different battles and skirmishes.

On July 1, 1862, at the Battle of Booneville, Alger attacked the enemy&#x27;s rear with ninety men. He was wounded and taken prisoner, but escaped the same day. The Confederate forces were soundly defeated.

On October 16, he was made lieutenant colonel of the 6th Michigan Cavalry.

On February 28, 1863, he was promoted to colonel of the 5th Michigan Cavalry. His command was the first to enter Gettysburg on June 28. Alger was personally mentioned in the report of General George Armstrong Custer on cavalry operations there.

Alger was considered a military strategist and surveyed Union supplies with President Lincoln.

Alger participated in General Sheridan&#x27;s Valley Campaigns of 1864 in Virginia. On June 11, 1864, at Trevilian Station, he captured a large force of Confederates with a brilliant cavalry charge.

On July 8, 1864, Alger was severely wounded pursuing the enemy at Boonesborough, Maryland.

Alger resigned from the army on September 20, 1864. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Alger for the award of the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from June 11, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on March 12, 1866. On February 28, 1867, President Johnson nominated Alger for the award of the grade of brevet major general of volunteers to rank from June 11, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on March 2, 1867.

In 1868, he was elected the first commander of the Michigan department of the Grand Army of the Republic. In 1889, he became the Grand Army&#x27;s National Commander-in-Chief. He was also a member of the Michigan Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

==Lumber baron==
After the Civil War, Alger settled in Detroit as head of Alger, Smith &amp; Company and the Manistique Lumbering Company. His holdings included a great pine forest on Lake Huron covering over and producing more than of lumber per annum.

In order to transport the lumber, Alger led his company to create the Detroit, Bay City and Alpena Railroad, of which Alger served as president.

After clear cutting forests in the lower peninsula, his lumber companies acquired land in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan including Kingston Plains, just south of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. These bleak stump plains have resisted 90 years of reforestation efforts. Alger made a fortune logging the area which he used to propel himself to governor of Michigan.

At the turn of the 20th century, he and Florida landowner Martin Sullivan established the Alger-Sullivan Lumber Company, which milled lumber in Foshee, Alabama and Century, Florida.

==Political activism==
Alger was active in politics as a Republican. In 1866, he was a delegate to the party&#x27;s Wayne County convention and its state convention. In the late 1860s, Alger was a leader of the Boys in Blue, an organization of Union veterans formed to support Republican Party policies and candidates. In October 1872, Alger was a vice president of the committee that organized a Republican campaign event which featured a speech by James G. Blaine, then serving as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

In June 1876, Alger was a vice president of the committee which sponsored a Republican rally in Detroit that began that year&#x27;s presidential campaign. In early October 1876, Alger was a vice president of the committee that organized a mass Republican rally in Detroit which featured a speech by former governor Edward Follansbee Noyes of Ohio. In late October 1876, he was one of the vice presidents of the committee that organized a Republican rally in Detroit which included a keynote address by U.S. Senator James G. Blaine of Maine.

In early June 1880, Alger was a delegate to a mass interstate meeting of Union veterans which met in Chicago to devise a plan for supporting Republican candidates in that year&#x27;s elections. In mid-June, he presided over the Republican meeting in Detroit which was organized to ratify the results of the 1880 Republican National Convention, which had been held earlier in the month.

==Governor of Michigan==

In 1884, Alger was elected Governor of Michigan and served from January 1, 1885, to January 1, 1887. Highlights of his term included creation of the state board of pardons, the founding of a veterans home in Grand Rapids, the creation of two new counties (Alger and Iron), and establishment of the Michigan College of Mines. Alger declined renomination in 1886.

Alger&#x27;s name was placed in nomination for president at the 1888 Republican National Convention. He rose in balloting to 142 votes, with 416 necessary to win, but Benjamin Harrison ultimately obtained the nomination and went on to win the general election. After the election, Alger served as a presidential elector for Harrison.

== Secretary of War ==
On March 5, 1897, Alger was appointed Secretary of War in the Cabinet of U.S. President William McKinley.

As Secretary, Alger recommended pay increases for military personnel serving at foreign embassies and legations, legislation to authorize a Second Assistant Secretary of War, and a constabulary force for Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines.

He was criticized for the inadequate preparation and inefficient operation of the department during the Spanish–American War, especially for his appointment of William R. Shafter as leader of the Cuban expedition and the United States Army beef scandal, in which poor-quality canned beef was supplied to the Army. &quot;Algerism&quot; became an epithet to describe the claimed incompetence of the Army, especially as compared to the more stellar performance of the Navy.

Alger resigned at President McKinley&#x27;s request on August 1, 1899. He published a personal history of the war titled &quot;The Spanish–American War&quot; in 1901.

=== Vendetta against John S. Mosby ===
John Singleton Mosby accused Alger of pursuing a vendetta against him during Alger&#x27;s tenure as War Secretary. Mosby had been a Confederate partisan during the Civil War. Afterwards, he became a Republican and supported the presidential candidacies of Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes. In 1878, Hayes appointed Mosby as U.S. Consul in Hong Kong, where Mosby served until 1885.

Mosby supported William McKinley for president in 1896, and was assured by members of Congress close to McKinley that he could expect appointment to a consulship in Asia or South America. When no appointment was forthcoming, Mosby concluded that Alger was blocking his return to the consular service and claimed that Alger was pursuing a vendetta. According to Mosby, this was because during the war Mosby had ordered the execution of soldiers under Alger&#x27;s command who were accused of looting and destroying the property of supporters of the Confederacy in 1864. Historians and authors have concluded that it is more probable that the official preventing Mosby from receiving an appointment under McKinley was Secretary of State John Sherman. When Mosby began serving in Hong Kong, he concluded that his predecessor, David H. Bailey, had been involved in embezzlement and fraud. Bailey was forced to resign as U.S. Consul in Shanghai. Bailey was from Sherman&#x27;s home state of Ohio, and Sherman had authority over diplomatic appointments, so Sherman is more likely than Alger to have taken revenge on Mosby.

== U.S. Senator ==
On September 27, 1902, Alger was appointed by Michigan Governor Aaron T. Bliss to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of James McMillan. He was elected to the seat by the Michigan State Legislature in January 1903.

Alger was chairman of the Senate Committee on Pacific Railroads during the 59th Congress.

== Personal life ==
Alger was the founder of a prominent family, many of whom became involved in 20th century Michigan politics and active in the Republican Party.

The Algers had a home in Black River, Alcona Township, Michigan, from which Alger oversaw his lumbering operations.

On April 2, 1861, he married Annette Huldana Squire Henry of Grand Rapids. They had six children; Henrietta, Caroline, Frances, Russell Jr., Frederick, and Allan.

Frederick graduated from Harvard in 1899, served as a lieutenant colonel with the American Expeditionary Force in France during the First World War, and was awarded the French Legion of Honor.

Russell Jr. was instrumental in persuading the Packard Motor Car Company to move to Michigan from Ohio. He built a palatial Italian Renaissance style estate, &quot;The Moorings,&quot; in Grosse Pointe. It was donated in 1949 and became the Grosse Pointe War Memorial.

== Death ==
He died in Washington, D.C., in 1907. He is interred in Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit, Michigan.

==Legacy==

In a memorial address, Senator John Spooner of Wisconsin said of Alger, &quot;No man without noble purpose, well-justified ambitions, strong fiber, and splendid qualities in abundance could have carved out and left behind him such a career.&quot;

An early movie entitled &quot;General Wheeler and Secretary of War Alger at Camp Wikoff&quot; documents an official visit to Camp Wikoff, New York as Secretary of War. The visit and film were produced to garner support from the New York newspapers.

In May 1898, the War Department established Camp Russell A. Alger on a farm near Falls Church and Dunn Loring, Virginia. Faced with a typhoid fever epidemic, it was abandoned the month at the war&#x27;s end in August 1898 and sold the following month. In its brief existence, 23,000 men trained there for service. It is commemorated by an official Virginia historical marker.

<text>Youssouf Ouédraogo (25 December 1952 – 18 November 2017) was a Burkinabé politician. In 1992 he became the first prime minister of Burkina Faso since 1983, serving from 16 June 1992 to 22 March 1994. Ouédraogo, a member of the ruling Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP), later served as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs from January 1999 to June 2007.

==Biography==
Ouédraogo was born in Tikaré, in Bam Province. Under Thomas Sankara, Ouédraogo was appointed to the government as Minister of Planning and Popular Development on 31 August 1984, remaining in that position for three years. Shortly after Sankara was assassinated in October 1987, Ouédraogo became Minister for the Plan and Cooperation under Blaise Compaoré. He left that position on 25 April 1989 and became President of the Economic and Social Council, in which position he served until he was elected to the National Assembly as a deputy from Bam in the May 1992 parliamentary election. He was appointed as prime minister by Compaoré on 16 June 1992.

The CFA franc was devaluated in January 1994, and this was followed by controversy. Ouédraogo signed an agreement with trade unions to raise salaries on 12 March 1994, but the agreement fell through and Ouédraogo resigned a few days later. He then served as Ambassador to Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg and the European Union before being appointed as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in January 1999.

Ouédraogo was elected to the National Assembly again in the 2007 parliamentary election as a candidate of the CDP from Bam Province. In the government of Prime Minister Tertius Zongo, which was appointed on 10 June 2007, he was replaced as Foreign Minister by Djibrill Bassolé. He subsequently became special adviser to the president of the African Development Bank.

== Political career ==

He obtained a degree in marketing at the Universities of Dijon, Clermont-Ferrand and Lyon III (France). He taught at the University of Ouagadougou from 1982.

Under Thomas Sankara (President of Burkina Faso from 1983 to 1987), Ouédraogo was appointed to the government as Minister of Planning and Popular Development on 31 August 1984, remaining in that position for three years. Shortly after Sankara was assassinated in October 1987, Ouédraogo became Minister for the Plan and Cooperation under Blaise Compaoré. He left that position on 25 April 1989 and became president of the Economic and Social Council, in which position he served until he was elected to the National Assembly as a deputy from Bam in the May 1992 parliamentary election. He was appointed as prime minister by Compaoré on 16 June 1992.

He promoted reforms favorable to the private sector. He entered into negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank to reach agreements on structural adjustment. The CFA franc was devaluated in January 1994, and this was followed by controversy. Ouédraogo signed an agreement with trade unions to raise salaries on 12 March 1994, but the agreement fell through and Ouédraogo resigned a few days later.

== Diplomacy ==

He also had a diplomatic career, serving as an Ambassador to Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg and the European Union before being appointed as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in January 1999.

Chairman of the African Group of Ambassadors Committee – Caribbean – Pacific (ACP), he is one of the main negotiators in front of the European Commission at the renewal of the Fourth Geneva Convention governing the ACP-EU Partnership for the period 1995–1999.

Recalled to Burkina Faso in January 1999, he was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs, a post he held until 2007.

He represented Africa at the launch in March 1999 of the US – Africa Partnership for 21st century, with President Bill Clinton. At this time the Burkina Faso held the presidency of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). He strongly supported the preferential agreement proposed by the United States to promote trade relations with Africa (AGOA) and the creation of the Millennium Challenge Corporation. He also organized Burkina second ministerial meeting implementation of the Africa – European Union (2002), and the tenth Francophonie Summit (2004).

Ouédraogo was elected to the National Assembly again in the 2007 parliamentary election as a candidate of the CDP from Bam Province. In the government of Prime Minister Tertius Zongo, which was appointed on 10 June 2007, he was replaced as Foreign Minister by Djibrill Bassolé.

== International organisations ==

In September 2007, he became Special Adviser to the President of the African Development Bank. He was in charge of political and diplomatic issues. He was appointed to that position to deepen and/or expand the partnership between the Bank and its Member States, Regional Economic Communities and international institutions. He also defended a stronger partnership between the Maghreb and Sub-Saharan Africa.

In 2016, he was elected associated member of the Royal Academies for Science and Arts of Belgium. His induction took place on 28 May during an official ceremony at the Academy Palace of Belgium where he held a speech on behalf of all new members.

<text>IPFilter (commonly referred to as ipf) is an open-source software package that provides firewall services and network address translation (NAT) for many Unix-like operating systems. The author and software maintainer is Darren Reed. IPFilter supports both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, and is a stateful firewall.

IPFilter is delivered with FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris 10 through 11.3, illumos (OpenIndiana) and HP-UX. It used to be a part of OpenBSD, but it was removed by Theo de Raadt in May 2001 due to problems with its license. It was subsequently replaced in OpenBSD by PF, which was developed by OpenBSD&#x27;s own developers. DragonFly BSD removed its support for IPFilter in May 2011. Oracle Solaris imported the PF firewall from OpenBSD in the 11.3 release, and removed IPFilter in the 11.4 release. 

IPFilter can be installed as a runtime-loadable kernel module or directly incorporated into the operating system kernel, depending on the specifics of each kernel and user preferences. The software&#x27;s documentation recommends the module approach, if possible.

<text>The Copa de la Liga (League Cup in Spanish) was a Spanish football tournament created in 1982.

Due to time constraints, saturation and club pressure, the competition only lasted four years, being cancelled in 1986. Winning the trophy helped two clubs to complete cup doubles: FC Barcelona with the Copa del Rey (1983) and Real Madrid with the UEFA Cup (1985). In all four finals, the team that played the second leg at home won the trophy.

== History ==
The League Cup was promoted by the president of FC Barcelona, Josep Lluís Núñez, in order to create a new competition that would generate new economic income for the clubs, both in terms of box office and television rights.

In 1986 the fourth and last edition was held. In 1987, the fifth edition was scheduled to be held with a new “final three” format (which would have replaced the Supercopa de España, which for this reason was not held in the 1987 or 1988 seasons), for which they were already classified. Real Madrid (League champion), Real Sociedad (Cup champion) and Atlético Madrid (champion of the “intermediate league” of the “Playoff League”). The clubs finally agreed to cancel the competition due to the saturation of the match schedule, especially due to the strange League format of that 1986–87 season.

==Format==
The League Cup was a straight knock-out competition. All ties were played over two legs, home and away, with the team with the largest aggregate score progressing. The final also consisted of two games.

If the aggregate score was tied after two legs of ninety minutes each, extra-time would be played. If that failed to separate the teams, a penalty shootout would determine the winner. Unlike the Copa del Rey, the away goals rule was not applied.

<text>The is a utility cartridge released by Konami on December 12, 1985 in Japan and Europe. It is meant to be used in conjunction with Konami&#x27;s own MSX game cartridges, allowing users to select their stages, adjust the number of lives, save progress and high scores, make screen dumps, and play in slow motion, among other uses.

An updated model called Konami&#x27;s New Ten Times Cartridge (コナミの新10倍カートリッジ, Konami no Shin Jū-bai Kātoriji) was released on February 18, 1988. This new version adds support for MSX2 games and features a battery backup that allows users to save data via S-RAM from compatible games (such as &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot;). Even though Konami&#x27;s New Ten Times Cartridge was released exclusively in Japan, if the Japanese cartridge is put into a European MSX or MSX2 system it will show up in English with the title Game Master II.

<text>Michael Kelvin Norris (born March 19, 1955) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball for the Oakland Athletics from 1975 to 1983 and in 1990. Norris is a two-time Gold Glove Award winner and he was an MLB All-Star in 1981.

==Career==
Norris attended Balboa High School in San Francisco and was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the first round (24th overall) 
In January 1973. He made his major league debut in 1975. He struggled mightily during his first five major league seasons, recording a 4.67 ERA and a 12–25 record.

Norris had a breakout season in 1980, going 22–9 with 24 complete games, a 2.53 earned run average and an AL-low .209 batting average against, while also earning his first Gold Glove Award. However, he was not awarded the American League Cy Young Award; Steve Stone of the Baltimore Orioles, who had a record of 25–7, was given the honor. Norris pitched more innings, gave up fewer hits, walks, home runs, and runs, and had a much lower ERA than Stone, but at the time, wins were a primary focus of voters. Norris placed 15th in the MVP voting.

In , Norris posted a modest 12–9 record, earning his second Gold Glove Award and also earning an All-Star berth. Norris spun a complete-game shutout in the first round of the playoffs against the Kansas City Royals and pitched well in the AL Championship Series against the New York Yankees despite getting hit with a loss there.

However, Norris never even approached his 1981 form again. A number of baseball historians and statisticians have blamed this on manager Billy Martin overworking him and the other members of the 1981 staff. In 2006, baseball writer Rob Neyer estimated that Norris threw 131 pitches per complete game in 1981–a heavy workload for a young pitcher even then. He was sent to the minors during the 1983 season. After spending parts of the next five years in the minors, he made a brief comeback as a relief pitcher in 1990, posting an ERA of 3.00 in 27 innings. He is the only player to win at least one game with Oakland in three different decades, as well as the only player with at least a 10-year career to spend his entire career with the Athletics during their tenure in Oakland.

==Later life==
In 1999 he was diagnosed with cervical myelopathy, and he had surgery in January 2000 at the California Pacific Medical Center. After recovering, Norris took up golf as a hobby. In 2007, he appeared with Dave Stewart, Mudcat Grant, and Vida Blue in a pre-game ceremony before a regular season game between the Texas Rangers and the Oakland Athletics.

Norris was well known for his distinctive green fielding glove.

<text>Pat Ingoldsby (25 August 1942 – February/March 2025) was an Irish poet and television presenter. He hosted children&#x27;s television shows, wrote plays for the stage and for radio, published books of short stories and waa a newspaper columnist. From the mid-1990s, he withdrew from the mass media and was most widely known for his collections of poetry, and his selling of them on the streets of Dublin (usually on Westmoreland Street or College Green).

==Background==
Ingoldsby was born in Malahide, Dublin, Ireland on 25 August 1942. On 1 March 2025, it was announced that he had died at the age of 82.

==Work==
In the 1980s, Ingoldsby hosted RTÉ children&#x27;s television shows named &quot;Pat&#x27;s Hat&quot;, &quot;Pat&#x27;s Chat&quot;, and &quot;Pat&#x27;s Pals&quot;. His plays include &quot;Bats or Booze or Both&quot; (Dublin, Project Arts Centre, 1977); &quot;Hisself&quot; (Dublin, Peacock Theatre, 1978); &quot;Rhymin&#x27; Simon&quot; (Peacock Theatre, 1978); &quot;When Am I Getting&#x27; Me Clothes&quot; (Peacock Theatre, 1978); &quot;Yeukface the Yeuk and the Spotty Grousler&quot; (Peacock, 1982); and &quot;The Full Shilling&quot; (Dublin, Gaeity Theatre, 1986). In the early 1990s, he had a column in the &quot;Evening Press&quot; (a now-defunct national Irish newspaper). These columns were later collected in &quot;The Peculiar Sensation of Being Irish&quot;. Ingoldsby is a fluent Irish speaker and includes a few poems written in Irish in each book of poetry. He lives in Clontarf, in Dublin, Ireland. Since sometime in the mid-1990s, he withdrew from TV, radio and theatre, instead devoting his efforts to poetry. Pat was nevertheless still part of Ireland&#x27;s arts scene, sometimes opening Art exhibitions, introducing then-new musicians such as David Gray or launching other people&#x27;s books. He self-published through Willow Publications, which he set up and named after one of his pet cats (who later died). Some of his books since 1998 have carried a note that they are protected by the &quot;Bratislava Accord 1993, section 2 cre/009 manifest-minsk&quot;, the terms of which allegedly protect his book&#x27;s content from being included in:
* &quot;school textbooks&quot;
* &quot;examinations&quot;
* &quot;elocution classes&quot;
* &quot;anything with the word &quot;Arts&quot; in it.&quot;

In March 2022, the Museum of Literature Ireland (MoLI) hosted a video installation to mark the release of Ingoldsby&#x27;s latest anthology, &quot;In Dublin They Really Tell You Things — Pat Ingoldsby, Selected Poems 1986 — 2021&quot;.

==Influences==
Most of Ingoldsby&#x27;s poems are about his personal experiences, observations of life in Dublin, or mildly surreal humorous possibilities. Topics of personal experiences vary from the death of his father, or the electroconvulsive therapy he received (c. 1988), to his appreciation of the natural world or his pets (mostly cats, but also some fish). Observations of Dublin are mostly humorous conversations overheard on the bus, or the characters he sees and talks to while selling his books on the streets. Some observations are not so cheerful as he also sees the drunks and the homeless of Dublin city, and the some aspects of modernisation which he isn&#x27;t pleased with. His most distinctive style of poetry is his humourist style. A recurring character, Wesley Quench, appears in roles such as the driver of a Flying See-Saw Brigade. Another poem, &quot;Vagina in the Vatican,&quot; depicts a vagina sneaking into the Vatican unstopped because no one knew what it was – except for a few who couldn&#x27;t let slip that they did. He also occasionally produced stories for children. These are a childish version of his mildly surreal style. During the rapid increase in the use of mobile telephones, he offered a &quot;Mobile Phone Euthanasia&quot; services on the streets of Dublin, where he would destroy phones for annoyed owners. His cousin Maeve Ingoldsby was a playwright. Pat retired from selling his books on the streets of Dublin in 2015.

<doc id="876579" wikidata="Q7825438" url="?curid=876579" title="Torbay, Western Australia">
<text>Torbay is a small town and a bay in the Great Southern region of Western Australia, west of Albany. Torbay is within the City of Albany local government area. The Torbay townsite was gazetted in 1910.

The Torbay area is on the eastern fringe of the karri forest region, and with some notable blocks of remnant tall forest. Large granite outcrops are also common. Beaches on the bay tend towards fine white sand. Where streams occur, they are clear but stained dark brown in colour from high-tannin-content vegetation.

Children in the area usually attend schools in Albany, travelling there by school bus. There is also a local independent school, the Woodbury Boston Primary School.

==History==
The town is named after Tor Bay, a bay on the coast to the south originally named by Captain Matthew Flinders in 1801 after Tor Bay in Devon, the home port of Admiral Richard Howe&#x27;s Channel Fleet, for whom Flinders had served as a midshipman from 1793 to 1794. Admiral Howe&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Lord Torbay&quot;. Flinders identified a number of local features with Lord Howe-related names, including Torbay (the bay), Torbay Inlet, Torbay Head and West Cape Howe (originally named Cape Howe by George Vancouver), to avoid confusion with James Cook’s Cape Howe in New South Wales. 
Pre-settlement explorers of the Torbay area included: Matthew Flinders, Robert Brown, Ferdinand Bauer and William Westall (Dec. 1801); Thomas Wilson (Dec. 1829); Roe and Stirling (Nov. 1835); and Charles Codrington Forsyth of HMS &quot;Pelorus&quot; (1838).

===Shipbuilding===
In November 1835, Roe and Stirling explored the Tor Bay area, scoping the area for shipbuilding. From the late 1830s to the 1860s an industry building vessels of up to 150 tons was established at Port Harding (Migo Island), using timber from the Guarinup Hills, half a mile behind the beach.

===Whaling===
A shore whaling station was established on the beach at Tor Bay behind Migo Island in 1844. Whales were taken during the periods 1844-1846 and 1861-1864.

===Forestry===
In 1886 railway contractors C &amp; E Millar established sawmills at Bornholm to supply timber for the construction of the Great Southern Railway (Beverley to Albany railway). Timber was initially shipped out by lighter, schooner and the small steamer &quot;Active&quot; from Port Harding (Migo Island) to Albany, and later by tramline to Elleker. In 1889 the Torbay Estate, of 22,000 acres, was granted to Millars in consideration of extending the railway from Elleker to Torbay and establishing working sawmills there. The two Bornholm mills were shifted to Torbay and enlarged. 
A prosperous timber settlement was in evidence at Torbay for about six years. The estate concession extended from Wilgie Hill, at the Albany end of Torbay, to Youngs, the timber being hauled by tramline from 20 miles beyond Torbay as far as Hay River, before the mills were finally moved. By 1895 most of the suitable timber at Torbay had been felled. The railway was again extended to Denmark in 1896. In 1898 Millars Karri and Jarrah Forests Limited offered the Torbay Estate back to the government provided they could retain ownership of the strip of land occupied by the Elleker-Torbay railway, which under their contract was to revert to the government after 14 years. The land was subdivided and sold for agricultural purposes in 1900.

===WAGR rail service===
Millars&#x27; Elleker-Torbay-Denmark railway line closed on 31 May 1905. During negotiations over the sale of the railway line the State leased the line and WAGR rail services began on 3 May 1907. In 1908 Millars sold the railway to the state government. Line extension works beyond Denmark were started in 1926 and on 11 June 1929 the first passenger service ran to Nornalup. The Nornalup-Denmark-Torbay-Elleker rail service was permanently shut down on 30 September 1957 and the rails were lifted in 1963.
On early operational lists of stopping places of the line, there are two identified locations, one as Torbay Junction, the other being Torbay.
* Torbay was the station and siding built in 1889, on the Denmark line - at 335m 58c and closed in 1957.

* Torbay Junction was opened in 1897, as Lakeside, on the Great Southern line at 330m 46c, it was then named Torbay Junction in 1908, and was further renamed Elleker in 1921.

==Modern industry==
Local industries include dairy farming, beef cattle, plantation forestry, specialist horticulture, arts and crafts and tourism, along with rural businesses that service farmers (mechanics, lime supply, machinery and labour hire etc.). A seasonal commercial fishing industry occurs within the bay based on catches of herring and Australian salmon during the February–April period. 
Torbay has been a traditional potato growing area for over a century, particularly for seed potato production. While some pumpkins are grown and the area is suitable for cauliflower production, potatoes are the major horticultural crop. The area currently produces about 50% of Western Australia’s requirements for seed potato production.

==Tor Bay==
Tor Bay, which includes Port Harding (named in 1838 by master&#x27;s mate Charles Forsyth after Captain Francis Harding of HMS &quot;Pelorus&quot;) and Port Hughes (named in 1831 by Roe after Private Thomas Hughes of the 63rd Regiment) as well as Torbay Inlet, lie between Torbay Head and Stony Island. Torbay Head is the most southerly point on the mainland of Western Australia and the most western point of the Great Australian Bight. Islands within Tor Bay include Migo Island, named after the Swan River native Migo, Richard Island, named after Admiral Richard Howe, both by Roe in 1835; and Shelter Island.

Popular beaches on the bay include Perkins Beach, Muttonbird Beach and Cosy Corner, all accessible by car. Cosy Corner Beach is the most well-known, and is a popular family beach with picnic and camping facilities. Children&#x27;s swimming lessons are held there in the summer. There are other beaches that are accessible only by four-wheel drive vehicle. The Bibbulmun Track passes around the edge of the bay, coming down long steps from the steep hills above Cosy Corner and following the beach around the curve of the bay and across the mouth of Torbay Inlet along Muttonbird Beach to near Shelter Island.

==Mars==
A diameter impact crater on the planet Mars was in 1988 named after Torbay.

<text>The Asian Saga is a series of six novels written by James Clavell between 1962 and 1993. The novels all centre on Europeans in Asia, and together explore the impact on East and West of the meeting of these two distinct civilizations.

==Overview==
The name &quot;Asian Saga&quot; was first applied to the series after &quot;Shōgun&quot; had been published. The purpose of the &quot;Asian Saga&quot; was, according to Clavell—descendant of a family long in service to the British Empire, and who was a prisoner of war of the Japanese during the Second World War—to tell &quot;the story of the Anglo-Saxon in Asia&quot;.

Ordered by publication date:

# &quot;King Rat&quot; (1962)
# &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; (1966)
# &quot;Shōgun&quot; (1975)
# &quot;Noble House&quot; (1981)
# &quot;Whirlwind&quot; (1986)
# &quot;Gai-Jin&quot; (1993)

Ordered by internal chronology:

# &quot;Shōgun:&quot; set in feudal Japan, 1600. 1152 pages.
# &quot;Tai-Pan:&quot; set in Hong Kong, 1841. 727 pages.
# &quot;Gai-Jin:&quot; set in Japan, 1862. 1126 pages.
# &quot;King Rat:&quot; set in a Japanese POW camp, Singapore, 1945. 400 pages.
# &quot;Noble House:&quot; set in Hong Kong, 1963. 1171 pages.
# &quot;Whirlwind:&quot; set in Iran, 1979. 1147 pages (Abridged with some rewritten parts as Escape, 598 pages)

Four of the six books—&quot;Tai-Pan&quot;, &quot;Gai-Jin&quot;, &quot;Noble House&quot;, and &quot;Whirlwind&quot;—follow the dealings of the great trading company Struan&#x27;s, the Noble House of Asia (based on Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited), its founder Dirk Struan, and his various descendants. &quot;Gai-Jin&quot; provides the major link between the &quot;Shōgun&quot; and Struan&#x27;s storylines.

Some of the characters make appearances in multiple books, and many characters from one book are referred to in later books. For example, two characters from &quot;King Rat&quot; (Robin Grey and Peter Marlowe) reappear in &quot;Noble House,&quot; and Robert Armstrong is a major character in both &quot;Noble House&quot; and &quot;Whirlwind.&quot; As a tie-in, Linc Bartlett&#x27;s (&quot;Noble House&quot;) namesake ancestor appears in Clavell&#x27;s film &quot;Walk Like a Dragon&quot; (1960).

There are dozens of characters throughout the series, with very complex family relationships and a great deal of history that is hinted at but never described in detail. For instance, Peter Marlowe is almost certainly a descendant of Lt. John Marlowe, the captain who married Malcolm Struan and Angelique Richaud against the wishes of Tess Struan, as Clavell refers often to Peter Marlowe&#x27;s family&#x27;s long history of naval service. Clavell peppers the entire Asian Saga with these genealogical Easter eggs.

After publishing &quot;Whirlwind,&quot; Clavell wrote a shorter version of the story which focused on two characters from the book. Titled &quot;Escape: The Love Story from Whirlwind,&quot; the book is generally not considered an official part of the Asian Saga; nonetheless, some reviewers said it helped flesh out several aspects of the original novel.

In 1980, Clavell stated that, beyond &quot;Noble House,&quot; future entries in the series would include &quot;Nippon,&quot; set in 1970s Japan, and &quot;China,&quot; set in the present and future. When he died in 1994 after the publication of &quot;Gai-Jin&quot;, it was reported that he had been planning several more entries in the &quot;Asian Saga&quot; series.

==Plot==

===List of tai-pans of Struan&#x27;s===

* 1st tai-pan: Dirk Struan, 1828–1841
* 2nd tai-pan: Culum Struan, 1841–1862
* 3rd tai-pan: Sir Lochlin Struan, 1862–1873??
* 4th tai-pan: Dirk Dunross, 1873–1894
* 5th tai-pan: Sir Lochlin Struan, 1894–1908 (see notes)
* 6th tai-pan: Ross Lechie Struan, 1908–1915
* 7th tai-pan: Sir Ross Struan, 1915–19?? (see notes)
* 8th tai-pan: Colin Dunross, 19??–1949
* 9th tai-pan: Alastair Struan, 1949–1960
* 10th tai-pan: Ian Dunross, 1960–1970
* 11th tai-pan: David MacStruan, 1970–1975 (see notes)
* 12th tai-pan: Linbar Struan, 1975–19?
* 5th tai-pan (in name only): Kelly O&#x27;Gorman, 1894–1915 (see notes)

===The half coins of Jin-qua===
In 1841, when Struan&#x27;s was on the brink of collapse, Dirk Struan received a loan of silver from the merchant Jin-qua in exchange for a series of favors. Among these were four bronze coins, split in half, four halves given to Dirk Struan, the other four halves kept by Jin-qua. Anyone who brought a half coin to the tai-pan of the Noble House would be granted whatever he asked, whether legal or illegal. All future tai-pans must swear to keep this bargain, before learning the details, if they were to become tai-pan. This served as repayment to the loan of silver.

Of the four coins, one was kept by Jin-qua, passed down through his family. One given to the warlord Wu Fang Choi. One given to Gordon Chen, and passed down through his family, and one given out in secret.

The first coin was brought to Dirk Struan in 1841 by Wu Fang Choi.

The second coin was brought in 1894 by Chiang Wu-tah. He asked that the Noble House give aid and sanctuary to Sun Yat-sen and to assist him to overthrow the Manchu dynasty. This is recounted in &quot;Noble House&quot;, chapter 60. In the movie however, the second coin is stated to have been returned to Hag Struan in 1911.

The story of the third coin is a major plot line in &quot;Noble House&quot;. The coin is owned by Struan&#x27;s trusted compradore Phillip Chen, handed down to him from his grandfather Gordon Chen. However, his son John Chen learns the secret of the coin, steals it, and bargains it and its secret away to American businessman Lincoln Bartlett. Before Bartlett takes possession of the coin, John Chen is kidnapped and murdered. When Phillip Chen enlists his underworld cousin Four Finger Wu to help locate John, Wu discovers the coin in the possession of one of the kidnappers, and takes it for his own, knowing its secret. When Wu dies, his son Profitable Choy takes over the coin and begs the favours from Ian Dunross.

The fate of the fourth coin is not addressed in the saga. However, it is speculated in &quot;Noble House&quot; that it was given to May-may (Dirk Struan&#x27;s mistress) and passed down to their descendant Sir Shih-teh &quot;Shitee&quot; T&#x27;Chung.

==Adaptations==
As of 2024, four installments of the &quot;Asian Saga&quot; have been adapted for film or television:
* &quot;King Rat&quot; (1965), starring George Segal, was nominated for two Academy Awards for Art Direction and Black and White Cinematography.
* &quot;Shōgun&quot; (1980), was adapted by NBC as a television miniseries starring Richard Chamberlain, Toshiro Mifune, and Yoko Shimada; the production was one of the highest rated programs of its kind ever broadcast.
** The nine-hour miniseries was nominated for 14 Emmy Awards, winning three including Best Limited Series. It also won three Golden Globe Awards.
** A two-hour version received a theatrical release in 1981.
* &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; (1986), released as a theatrical film starring Bryan Brown and Joan Chen, was a critical and box office failure.
* &quot;Noble House&quot; (1988) was adapted as a TV miniseries starring Pierce Brosnan and was a ratings success. It updated the timeframe of the novel from the 1960s to the 1980s and took many liberties with key points of the novel (for example, Ian Dunross became a bachelor who had a romance with Casey Tcholok).
*&quot;Shōgun&quot; (2024): The channel FX has released a series on its Hulu platform.

Although there were press reports in the mid-1990s that a miniseries adaptation of &quot;Gai-Jin&quot; was planned, no production eventuated.

<doc id="876583" wikidata="Q910962" url="?curid=876583" title="Guidelines for National Unification">
<text>The Guidelines for National Unification (), or the National Unification Guidelines (NUG), were written by the National Unification Council, an advisory body of the Republic of China government, regarding Chinese unification. The National Unification Guidelines were adopted by the Executive Yuan Council on February 23, 1991. The guidelines have a three-step process for the gradual unification of mainland China and Taiwan.

==Contents==
The National Unification Guidelines endorses the One China policy before any other statements: &quot;Both the mainland and Taiwan are parts of Chinese territory. Helping to bring about national unification should be the common responsibility of all Chinese people.&quot; However, the document emphasized that unification must &quot;first respect the rights and interests of the people in the Taiwan area, and protect their security and welfare&quot;. A more radical earlier draft emphasized the &quot;will&quot;, rather than the &quot;rights&quot;, of the people in Taiwan, but this wording was changed at the insistence of ROC premier Hau Pei-tsun. The guidelines envisioned three stages that must be reached before planning unification:

# Both sides would not &quot;deny each other&#x27;s existence&quot; in the international community and would renounce the use of force or threats. The mainland should carry out political reforms.
# The two sides would set up official communication channels &quot;on equal footing&quot; and help each other participate in international organizations. In return, Taiwan will help develop the mainland&#x27;s economy and open up the Three Links of communication technology.
# The two sides will establish an organization to plan the unification of a &quot;democratic, free, and equitably prosperous China&quot;

The NUG&#x27;s demands that the PRC renounce the use of force, grant ROC political equality to itself, and let the ROC participate in international organizations, while offering little from Taiwan in return, sharply contradicted the unification proposals from mainland China. Additionally, the requirement for a &quot;free, democratic&quot; China to even consider unification precluded negotiations with the Chinese Communist Party currently in power on the mainland. In practice, the unrealistic goals for unification set by the NUG furthered the goals of Taiwanization of the ROC and the One Country on Each Side political culture in Taiwan. Nonetheless, in diplomatic terms the affirmation of the One China principle on the Taiwan side made the 1992 Consensus and the Wang-Koo Talks possible.

==Abrogation==

As part of the Four Noes and One Without pledge, President Chen Shui-bian had promised not to formally abolish the National Unification Guidelines or the National Unification Council despite his party&#x27;s supportive stance on Taiwan independence. In his Chinese New Year address on January 29, 2006, President Chen Shui-bian proposed abolishing the National Unification Guidelines and the National Unification Council. On February 27, 2006, Chen formally announced that the guideline would &quot;cease to apply&quot; and the council would &quot;cease to function&quot;. The United States initially warned Chen not to abolish either the council or the guidelines, but later refused to condemn him because it believed the absence of the term &quot;abolish&quot; was not a breach of the status quo. However, Chen was widely condemned by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which warned that Chen &quot;would bring disaster to Taiwan society.&quot; The Pan-Blue Coalition also condemned the move as unnecessarily provocative, arguing that Chen needed to focus on economic issues in the face of a growing unemployment and suicide rate, and some legislators started a petition to have Chen impeached. Chen defended his action as a response to the military threat from mainland China. Without the legal constraints of the NUG, Chen&#x27;s successor, President Ma Ying-jeou, has been able to usher in an era of unprecedented exchanges between mainland China and Taiwan since 2008.

<doc id="876584" wikidata="Q1112001" url="?curid=876584" title="Colt Anaconda">
<text>The Colt Anaconda is a large frame double-action revolver featuring a full length under-barrel ejection-rod lug and six round cylinder, designed and produced by the Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company in 1990. Chambered for the powerful .44 Magnum and .45 Colt centerfire ammunition cartridges, the Anaconda marked the Hartford, Connecticut firm&#x27;s first foray into the popular large-bore Magnum pistol market.

==Development==
Built on a new and heavier ‘MM&#x27; frame, the Anaconda was brought out to compete with .44 Magnum contemporaries such as the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29, the Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. Redhawk and Blackhawk, and the Dan Wesson Firearms Model 44. Considering that many of these models had been marketed and sold for fully 35 years upon its introduction, the Anaconda was a very late entry into the large-bore handgun market. Unlike most other pistols introduced in the 1980s and 1990s, the Anaconda was never offered with a carbon steel blued finish, but was available only in stainless steel. When originally introduced, Anacondas were plagued with poor accuracy, but changes to the barrels quickly corrected the problems to the point that Colt billed its new pistol as among the most accurate .44 Magnum revolvers in production. Anaconda revolvers were primarily marketed for sport enthusiast shooters and hunters, as they are too large for law enforcement general duty use or concealed-carry, although made-to-order limited production versions of the gun continued to be available from the Colt custom gun shop until approximately 2003. In 2021, Colt resumed production of the Anaconda, using a new design with a stronger frame and an oversized Python action.

==Features==
Originally chambered for the .44 Magnum cartridge, in 1993 the Anaconda began to be offered in .45 Colt as well. Its fit and finish resembled an upsized King Cobra married to a ventilated-rib barrel reminiscent of the Python&#x27;s. Initially marketed with a satin brushed stainless finish, a highly polished mirror-like option known as &quot;Ultimate Stainless&quot; was catalogued for a time through the Colt Custom Shop. Anacondas came equipped with four, six, or eight inch barrels, neoprene synthetic rubber finger-grooved combat-style grips with nickel colored &#x27;Rampant Colt&#x27; medallions, large target type hammers and triggers, as well as open iron sights with a red insert front and fully adjustable white outline rear. Some models were factory drilled and tapped for telescopic sight mounting, while others shipped with recoil reducing Magna-Ported barrels. The trigger actions on these guns are rated as very high-quality, and the heavy-duty solid construction and weight tends to absorb recoil, making the Anaconda relatively easy to shoot with heavy loads.

===Kodiak===
Introduced in 1993, the Kodiak was similar to the Anaconda in that it was constructed entirely of stainless steel, but offered the additional features of a recoil-reducing factory magna-ported barrel and unfluted cylinder.

There were 2000 Kodiaks made as a special run of Anacondas, breaking away from their long history of naming revolvers after snakes. A special run of 1000 King Cobras was made about the same time, having the same Magna-Ported barrel and unfluted cylinder and were called the Grizzly. There was an uncatalogued barrel version of the Anaconda, with reportedly less than 150 made. These versions command very high prices when they are encountered. Additionally, Colt made an extremely low number of barrel Anacondas chambered in .45 Colt. This ultra-rare variation commands a premium price when encountered as well.

In 2024, Colt reintroduced the Kodiak, a variant of the newer Anaconda (reintroduced in 2021), with the same style of Magna-ported barrel and unfluted cylinder of the originals, available with a 4.25-inch barrel.

<doc id="876589" wikidata="Q809666" url="?curid=876589" title="Barwon River (New South Wales)">
<text>Barwon River, a perennial river that is part of the Murray–Darling basin, is located in the north-west slopes and Orana regions of New South Wales, Australia.

The name &quot;barwon&quot; is derived from the Australian Aboriginal words of &#x27; or&#x27;, meaning great, wide, awful river of muddy water; and also &quot;baawan&quot;, a Ngiyambaa name for both the Barwon and Darling rivers. The history, culture and livelihoods of the local Aboriginal people are closely intertwined with the Barwon River and its associated tributaries and downstream flows.

==Course==
The river is formed through the confluence of the Macintyre River and Weir River (part of the Border Rivers system), north of Mungindi, in the Southern Downs region of Queensland. The Barwon River generally flows south and west, joined by 36 tributaries, including major inflows from the Boomi, Moonie, Gwydir, Mehi, Namoi, Macquarie, Bokhara and Bogan rivers. During major flooding, overflow from the Narran Lakes and the Narran River also flows into the Barwon. The confluence of the Barwon and Culgoa rivers, between Brewarrina and Bourke, marks the start of the Darling River.

From its head to the point where it reaches the 29th parallel south near the town of Mungindi, the course of the Barwon is the border between Queensland and New South Wales.

Towns on the Barwon River, from its source towards its mouth include Mungindi, Collarenebri, Walgett, and Brewarrina.

The catchment and water flows of the Barwon River are generally administered by the Murray–Darling Basin Authority and together with the Darling River, the catchment covers about 13% of the Murray-Darling Basin.

In December 2018, amidst drought, the Barwon River at Walgett ceased flowing, reduced to a series of stagnant pools.

==History==

===Aboriginal history===
Aboriginal people from six language groups originally occupied the area of the Barwon River wetlands. These were the Ngemba, the Baranbinja, the Murrawarri, the Yuwaalaraay, the Weilwan, and the Kamilaroi peoples. The Aboriginal people generally used the wetlands for hunting, fishing, and gathering uses, and for cultural association.

Aboriginal people built a complex series of fish traps on the Barwon River at Brewarrina. These traps are a large, well-preserved example of this type of prehistoric site. The traps were built of rocks placed in the river bed to form a large number of V-shaped or diamond-shaped channels. The Brewarrina fish traps have now been listed on the Australian National Heritage List owing to the rarity of these works. They are of importance to modern Aboriginal people and are still in use. There are rocky rapids above and below Collarenebri as well as weirs and other structures for irrigation which impede normal navigation of the river.

===European history===
In 1846, Roderick Mitchell, Commissioner of Crown Lands and the son of explorer, Sir Thomas Mitchell, proved that the Barwon and MacIntyre Rivers were the same river under different names.

Regular steamer services ran from Walgett to Bourke from 1880 to 1912. During the floods of 1879 and 1886 the steamers were able to travel into Collarenebri and as far as Mungindi in 1890.

The Brewarrina Bridge, which was built in 1888 over the Barwon River on the Kamilaroi Highway, has also been assessed as being of state significance. The Boonanga bridge completed in 1928 to cross the Barwon River near Boomi, is an early example of Allan timber truss road bridges. This bridge has been recorded with the NSW State Agency Heritage Register.

<doc id="876592" wikidata="Q50937" url="?curid=876592" title="It Came from Beneath the Sea">
<text>It Came from Beneath the Sea is a 1955 American science fiction monster horror film from Columbia Pictures, produced by Sam Katzman and Charles Schneer, directed by Robert Gordon, that stars Kenneth Tobey, Faith Domergue, and Donald Curtis. The screenplay by George Worthing Yates was designed to showcase the stop motion animation special effects of Ray Harryhausen.

A monstrous giant octopus rampages along the west coast of North America after becoming too radioactive from nuclear testing in the South Pacific for it to be able to hunt its natural prey in the Mindanao Deep.

&quot;It Came from Beneath the Sea&quot; was released as the top half of a double feature with &quot;Creature with the Atom Brain&quot;.

==Plot==

A nuclear submarine on its shakedown cruise in the Pacific Ocean, captained by Commander Pete Mathews, comes into contact with a massive sonar return. Unable to outrun or outmaneuver the object, the boat is disabled, but frees itself and returns to Pearl Harbor. Tissue from a huge sea creature is discovered jammed in the submarine&#x27;s dive planes.

Marine biologists Professor Lesley Joyce and John Carter of Harvard University are called in; they identify the tissue as a small part of a gigantic octopus. The military authorities are unconvinced, but are persuaded after receiving reports of missing swimmers and ships at sea being pulled under by a large sea creature. Both scientists conclude that the animal is from the Mindanao Deep, having been forced from its natural habitat by hydrogen bomb testing in the area, which has made the giant octopus radioactive, driving off its natural food supply.

The scientists suggest the disappearances of a Japanese fishing fleet and a Siberian seal boat may be the work of the foraging giant. Both Mathews and the Navy representatives express doubt and demand further proof. As Mathews assists Joyce and Carter, a report comes in of an attack on a Canadian freighter; several men escaped in a life raft. The survivors are questioned by psychiatrists, but when the first sailor&#x27;s description of a creature with giant tentacles is doubted, the other sailors refuse to testify. Joyce convinces the first sailor to repeat his story. The U.S. government officials halt all sea traffic in the North Pacific without revealing the reason. Carter flies out to sea to trace a missing ship, while Mathews and Joyce follow up on a report of five missing people off the coast of Oregon.

The local sheriff, Bill Nash, takes Mathews and Joyce to the attack site, where they find giant suction cup imprints in the beach sand. (At this point, Matthews and Joyce have become romantically involved.) They request that Carter join them. Nash is attacked along the beach by the giant octopus; the two nearby scientists barely escape. They hastily arrange for all Pacific coast waters to be mined before departing for the navy&#x27;s base in San Francisco.
An electrified safety net is strung underwater across the entrance to San Francisco Bay, protecting the electrified Golden Gate Bridge. Carter takes a helicopter along the shoreline and baits the sea with dead sharks in an effort to lure the creature inland. Joyce demonstrates to reporters a special jet-propelled atomic torpedo, which they hope to fire at the giant, while driving it back to the open sea before detonating the weapon. Later that day, the creature demolishes the underwater net, irritated by the electrical voltage, and heads toward San Francisco.
The navy orders the Golden Gate Bridge abandoned; Carter learns that the electric circuit was left on, so he races to the bridge to shut it off. The giant creature catches hold of the bridge and destroys Carter&#x27;s car, the electrical voltage irritating it even more. Mathews drives Carter to safety before a bridge section is pulled down by a giant tentacle.

The residents of San Francisco panic and begin a mass exodus. The navy struggles to evacuate the Embarcadero and the Ferry Building, which is battered by the creature&#x27;s giant tentacles. When more people are killed, the Defense Department authorizes Mathews to take out the submarine and fire the torpedo; Carter joins Mathews aboard while Joyce remains at the base.

Flamethrowers drive the giant tentacles back into the sea. When Mathews fires the jet torpedo into the giant creature, it grabs the submarine. Using an aqualung, Mathews swims up to the massive body and places explosive charges before being knocked out by the shockwaves from their premature explosion. Carter swims out and shoots at one of its eyes, forcing the giant octopus to release the submarine; he then pulls Mathews to safety. As the creature turns toward the open sea, the torpedo is detonated, destroying the octopus. The trio celebrate the victory at a restaurant, where Mathews makes an impromptu proposal, and Joyce accepts.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
The film was made by producer Charles Schneer under the supervision of Sam Katzman who had a B picture unit at Columbia. Schneer said the idea for the film was inspired by the first explosion of the hydrogen bomb in the Marshall Islands, saying he felt if some creature came out of the deep &quot;and then destroyed the Golden Gate Bridge, that would be a hell of a film.&quot;

The title was inspired by Universal&#x27;s science fiction hit &quot;It Came from Outer Space&quot;. Schneer had been impressed by the effects for &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; and hired Ray Harryhausen. &quot;I don&#x27;t think I would have made that type of picture if I hadn&#x27;t been able to get Ray to do the FX,&quot; Schneer said later.

===Shooting===
Much of the filming was done at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, including scenes aboard a submarine, and several naval personnel were given supporting roles.

To keep shooting costs low, director Robert Gordon shot inside an actual submarine, both above and under water, using handheld cameras. For a scene that takes place on a stretch of Pacific coastline, Gordon and his crew dumped several truckloads of sand onto a sound stage at Columbia, which they backed with a rear projection screen. During their scene together, Kenneth Tobey found himself sinking through the sand to the point of appearing shorter than Faith Domergue on camera, forcing him to dig himself out of the hole between every take. A more extensive love scene had been written for the characters but was literally torn out of the shooting script by Sam Katzman, to keep principal photography from going over schedule.

When animator Ray Harryhausen″s special effects were budgeted, studio head Sam Katzman allowed Harryhausen only enough money for animating &quot;six&quot; of the octopus&#x27; eight tentacles; two were eliminated on the final shooting miniature. Harryhausen jokingly named his giant octopus &quot;the sixtopus&quot;. For the scenes where a single tentacle is seen moving on screen, Harryhausen used a large model tentacle instead of employing the complete stop-motion animation model. Some of the later Golden Gate bridge scenes employ a shooting miniature of a bridge support; these were composited in post-production over live footage of the real support (this is the section that the &quot;sixtopus&quot; is seen clinging to in the bridge scene).

Schneer was refused permission to shoot on the actual Golden Gate Bridge, so he put the camera on the back of a bakery truck and drove it back-and-forth over the bridge several times to get the needed footage.

==Reception==
&quot;It Came from Beneath the Sea&quot; was teamed on a theatrical release double bill with Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Creature with the Atom Brain&quot;.

The film&#x27;s success led to Harryhausen collaborating again with Schneer for &quot;Earth vs. the Flying Saucers&quot; the following year.

===Critical===
&quot;Time Out&quot; called it a &quot;minor entry in the &#x27;50s cycle of radiation-paranoia sci-fi pics&quot;; and &quot;Moria&quot; noted, &quot;Most of the film is told in a stolid, flat style that seems more like an Army training documentary than a dramatic film. The problem is that one has to plod through three-quarters of the film to get to the monster sequences...Certainly, when the climactic scenes of wholesale destruction do arrive they are great&quot;; whereas &quot;Allmovie&quot; wrote that the film &quot;utilized elements of the documentary, with a narration that makes the first half of the movie seem almost like a newsreel, which gives the action a greater immediacy. And...This is all presented in a cool, clipped realistic manner, with a strong but convincingly stated macho tone...It all served to make the first quarter hour of the film almost irresistibly suspenseful, and gave Harryhausen one of the best lead-ins that one could ask for, for his effects&quot;; Leonard Maltin also praised the film&#x27;s &quot;Breathtaking special effects&quot;; and the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, while acknowledging it as a &quot;classic monster flick&quot;, also called the film &quot;Predictable tosh, but good 1950s fun&quot;.

==Legacy==
The four-issue comic book miniseries &quot;It Came from Beneath the Sea... Again&quot; (2007), released by TidalWave Productions as part of their Ray Harryhausen Signature Series, continued the story. A preview of the first issue was included on the 50th Anniversary DVD release of the film.

A clip from the film was used in the second episode of the TV series &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, which also features a giant man-eating octopus.

In &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998), the scene of the cephalopod attacking the Golden Gate Bridge is shown on a television.

In &quot;The Mitchells vs. the Machines&quot; (2021), a theatrical release poster for &quot;It Came from Beneath the Sea&quot; can be seen in Katie Mitchell&#x27;s bedroom.

In &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983), William Hurt&#x27;s character is watching &quot;It Came from Beneath the Sea &quot; while talking with Meg Tilly.

<text>Georges Franju (; 12 April 1912 – 5 November 1987) was a French filmmaker. He was born in Fougères, Ille-et-Vilaine.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Before working in French cinema, Franju held several different jobs. These included working for an insurance company and a noodle factory. He served briefly in the military in Algeria and was discharged in 1932. Upon his return, he studied to become a set designer and later created backdrops for music halls including Casino de Paris and the Folies Bergère.

In the mid-thirties, Franju and Henri Langlois met through Franju&#x27;s twin brother Jacques Franju. As well as creating the 16 mm short film &quot;Le Métro&quot;, Langlois and Franju also started a short-lived film magazine and created a film club called &quot;Le Cercle du Cinema&quot; with 500 francs he borrowed from Langlois&#x27; parents. The club showed silent films from their own collections followed by an informal debate about them amongst members. From &quot;Le Cercle du Cinema&quot;, Franju and Langlois founded the Cinématheque Française in 1936. Franju ceased to be closely related with the Cinématheque Française as early as 1938, and only became associated with it strongly again in the 1980s when he was appointed as the honorary artistic director of the Cinématheque. In 1937, Franju and Langlois co-founded another less successful film journal titled &quot;Cinematographe&quot; which had only two issues. In early 1940, Franju and Dominique Johansen co-founded another organization to promote cinema called Circuit Cinématographique des Arts et des Sciences which closed on 31 May 1940.

===Film career===
In 1949, Franju began work on a series of nine documentary films. The Nazi occupation of Paris and the industrialism following World War II influenced Franju&#x27;s early works. His first documentary, &quot;The Blood of Beasts&quot; (French: &quot;Le Sang des Bêtes&quot;) was a graphic film of a day inside a Paris slaughterhouse. The second documentary, commissioned by the government in 1950, was &quot;Passing By the Lorraine&quot; (French: &quot;En Passant par la Lorraine&quot;). The film was commissioned as a celebration of the modernization of the French industry, but Franju&#x27;s film showed his view of the ugliness spewing forth from monstrous factories. Franju&#x27;s third film commissioned by the French government, &quot;Hôtel des Invalides&quot; (1951), was a look at life inside a veterans&#x27; hospital. The film was commissioned as a tribute to the hospital and the War Museum, but Franju turned it into a film against the glorification of militarism. Franju later said that &quot;Hôtel des Invalides&quot; was his favorite of his three &quot;slaughter&quot; films.

With &quot;Head Against the Wall&quot; (French: &quot;La tête contre les murs&quot;) in 1958, Franju turned toward fiction feature films. His second feature was the horror film &quot;Eyes Without a Face&quot; (French: &quot;Les Yeux sans Visage&quot;) about a surgeon who tries to repair his daughter&#x27;s ruined face by grafting on to it the faces of beautiful women. His 1963 film &quot;Judex&quot; was a tribute to the silent film serials &quot;Judex&quot; and &quot;Fantomas&quot;. In Franju&#x27;s later years his film work became less frequent. Franju occasionally directed for television and in the late seventies he retired from filmmaking to preside over the Cinématheque Française. Georges Franju died on 5 November 1987.

==Film style==
In her study of French cinema since the French new wave, Claire Clouzot described Franju&#x27;s film style as &quot;a poignant fantastic realism inherited from surrealism and Jean Painlevé science cinema, and influenced by the expressionism of Lang and Murnau&quot;. Franju&#x27;s focus was on the visual aspect of filmmaking, which he claimed marked a director as an auteur. Franju claimed to &quot;not have the story writing gift&quot; and was focused on what he described as the &quot;putting into form&quot; of the film.

Franju used elements of surrealism and shock horror within his films in order to &quot;awaken&quot; his audience. Franju had a long history of friendship with well-known surrealists including André Breton, and the influence of this movement is extremely evident in his works. Franju uses these elements to link horror, history, and an ironic commentary on modernity&#x27;s ideal of progress. Franju is quoted as having said &quot;It&#x27;s the bad combination, it&#x27;s the wrong synthesis, constantly being made by the eye as it looks around, that stops us from seeing everything as strange.&quot; Throughout his documentary &quot;Le Sang des bêtes&quot;, for example, Franju reminds the audience just how strange everyday life can be. The opening sequence of the film presents the modern age as a &quot;dream land&quot; in which there is a need for some sort of awakening; Franju&#x27;s awakening comes through historical knowledge. Surrealist depictions of strange mannequins on the city&#x27;s edge are reminiscent of the bodies of the men wounded in war. Walter Benjamin argued that surrealism must &quot;disturb capitalist culture&#x27;s mythic assumptions of a rationalized evolving history&quot; which is done by provoking a simultaneous interpretation of the past and the present. This, as Benjamin argues, relies on the recognition of horror within everyday life. Franju does this in many ways throughout &quot;Le Sang des bêtes&quot;. For example, &quot;La Mer&quot; plays during a sequence in the slaughterhouse, comparing the lyrics to aspects of the slaughter, forcing the audience to interpret the love song in new and horrific ways. A similar contradiction can be seen in the film during scenes in which voiceover narration is used. The use of voiceover in the film works to undermine the form of a more typical documentary film. By alternating male and female narrators, the clinical, typically masculine authority of the documentary film is undermined. During the scene in which the instruments of slaughter are examined, the contradiction between the clinical account of the use of the instruments and the visceral horror of the instruments themselves points out the horrors that are ignored by modern society.

The same is true of Franju&#x27;s most famous film, &quot;Les Yeux sans visage&quot; (Eyes Without a Face), which also uses aspects of the scientific documentary film to accentuate horror. &quot;Les Yeux sans visage&quot; proved so horrific that audience members in Edinburgh fainted during screenings. During the most graphic grafting scene in the film a large importance is placed on surgical lamps, the scalpel being used, gloves, masks, and operating tables. Once again, the contradiction between the methodical, scientific approach to this horrific situation and the situation itself serves to accentuate the horror. &quot;Les Yeux sans visage&quot; also uses surrealist elements to address aspects of post-war life. During one scene, loud, disrupting noises of an airplane and church bells are heard while Dr. Genessier and Louise bury a failed facial graft candidate. This scene serves to portray the loss of faith in medicine (represented by the body created by another of Dr. Genessier&#x27;s many failed attempts to complete this surgery), the progress of technology (represented by the airplane), and the comfort of religion (represented by the church bells). This surrealist combination forces a new view of modernity and thus a reevaluation of the past.

<doc id="876603" wikidata="Q325389" url="?curid=876603" title="Dave Stewart (Eurythmics)">
<text>David Allan Stewart (born 9 September 1952) is an English musician, songwriter and record producer, best known for Eurythmics, his successful professional partnership with Annie Lennox. Sometimes credited as David A. Stewart, he won Best British Producer at the 1986, 1987 and 1990 Brit Awards. Stewart (along with Lennox) was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2020 and the duo were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2022. Outside of Eurythmics, Stewart has written and produced songs for artists such as Ringo Starr, Stevie Nicks, Mick Jagger and Tom Petty.

==Early life==
Stewart was born in 1952 in Sunderland, England, son of John (&quot;Jack&quot;) and Sadie Stewart. Distantly related both to the Dukes of Northumberland and to pirates, Stewart was from a middle-class, &quot;well-off family&quot;, with accountant parents; he &quot;always wanted to play with the working-class kids, but they&#x27;d always call [him] &#x27;richie&#x27; and whack [him] on the head with cricket bats and things.&quot; His father was a &quot;keen harmonica player&quot; with a &quot;dedication to music of all types&quot;, having &quot;invested in the latest hi-tech stereo system and wired it up to every room in the house.&quot; He attended Barnes Infants and Junior School and Bede Grammar School for Boys. 

Whilst still in his teens, he secured a record deal as part of folk-rock band Longdancer. Despite being signed to Elton John&#x27;s record label, The Rocket Record Company, they did not achieve commercial success. He also collaborated with Brian Harrison to produce an EP on the Sunderland Multicord label (label number MULT-SH-1, producer Ken McKenzie), recording two songs (&quot;Girl&quot; and &quot;Green She Said&quot;) from a school musical production written by teacher Dick Bradshaw, one traditional number (&quot;A Blacksmith Courted Me&quot;) and a song written by Dave and Brian (&quot;Deep December&quot;). After leaving Wearside, Stewart spent several years living in squats in London. In late 1976, he was introduced to Annie Lennox by Paul Jacobs. Soon, Stewart and Lennox became romantically involved. By 1977, the pair had teamed up with Sunderland musician Peet Coombes, releasing a single on Logo Records as the Catch. The band then developed into the Tourists, who enjoyed modest success, including a hit in 1979 with a cover of the Dusty Springfield hit &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot;.

== Eurythmics ==

The Tourists split up in 1980, as did Stewart and Lennox, though the pair continued to work together. They formed a new musical project named Eurythmics. After a string of hit singles and albums, the duo split in 1990, but reunited in 1999 for the album &quot;Peace&quot; and another world tour. Lennox and Stewart worked together again in 2005, recording two new tracks for the greatest hits package &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot;, released to coincide with Eurythmics&#x27; 25th anniversary.

==Post-Eurythmics==
When Eurythmics dissolved in 1990, Stewart moved to France and immediately released a self-titled album with his new band, The Spiritual Cowboys, which reached No. 38 on the UK album charts. The song &quot;Party Town&quot; was featured in the 1990 film &quot;Flatliners&quot;. A second album, &quot;Honest&quot;, followed in 1991. Both records went Gold in France, where Stewart concentrated his efforts.
In 1992, Stewart collaborated with singer Terry Hall (formerly of The Specials, Fun Boy Three and The Colourfield) on the project Vegas. The duo released one self-titled album but this was commercially unsuccessful, though one of the singles from the album (&quot;Possessed&quot;) made the UK Top 40.

In 1993, Stewart appeared in an Apple Inc. advertisement for the Power Macintosh in which he riffed on the word &quot;power&quot;. He also had a small cameo as a computer hacker in the 1995 film &quot;Hackers.&quot;

In 1994, Stewart released a solo album, &quot;Greetings from the Gutter&quot;. The album was not a commercial success, though Stewart scored a minor UK hit with the single &quot;Heart Of Stone&quot; which reached number 36. He then released another album, &quot;Sly-Fi&quot;, first on the internet.

In 1995, Stewart appeared in an advert for BT in which he sang the track &#x27;Secrets&#x27; which was made specifically for BT to be used in the advert.

In November 2002, Stewart worked with former South African president Nelson Mandela. Stewart came up with the idea of turning Mandela&#x27;s prison number into a telephone number then wrote and recorded songs with Paul McCartney, Bono and Edge and various others that you could only hear if you dialled this number and whilst listening you were donating. He then began organising the 46664 campaign and series of concerts in the fight against HIV/AIDS in South Africa.

In 2007, Stewart announced on his MySpace page that he would be playing live concerts showcasing his entire career. According to the announcement, he was to be accompanied by various guest musicians as well as a 30-piece orchestra. Additionally, Stewart has stated that for the first time in many years, he has been writing new songs on his guitar, although he had no plans at that time for a new solo album.

On the project, &quot;The Dave Stewart Songbook&quot;, he wrote a large coffee table-size book full of stories and photographs and also re-recorded 21 hit songs which have been co-written or co-produced by him during the past decades and were originally released by artists such as No Doubt, Shakespears Sister, Bryan Ferry, Celine Dion, Bob Geldof, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Jon Bon Jovi and Eurythmics. Also included is the song &quot;American Prayer&quot; written by Stewart with Bono of U2, for which Dave Stewart shot a video clip in support of the campaign of US presidential candidate Barack Obama, featuring various film and music stars, which premiered on YouTube on 23 August 2008. Stewart also released a new solo track, &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot;, in 2008. In July 2010, Stewart recorded his first solo album of new material since 1998&#x27;s &quot;Sly-Fi&quot;. Entitled &quot;The Blackbird Diaries&quot; after the Nashville, Tennessee studio where it was recorded, the album includes duets with Stevie Nicks, Martina McBride, Colbie Caillat and The Secret Sisters. Stewart has made a film of the making of the album and also filmed a live concert in Nashville at The Belcourt Theatre on 9 December 2010.

In May 2011 it was announced that Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones had formed a new supergroup called SuperHeavy which includes Dave Stewart, Joss Stone, Damian Marley and A. R. Rahman.

In May 2012 it was announced that Stewart would be playing four UK shows in September 2012 to support the release of his new album &quot;The Ringmaster General&quot;.

In 2013, Stewart released the album &quot;Lucky Numbers,&quot; which was recorded on a boat in the South Pacific for 12 days.

In October 2017 Stewart appeared on a German TV programme marking the 40th year of the stage career of the German singer Nena with whom he performed their jointly written track, &quot;Be My Rebel&quot;.

Stewart produced or co-produced all of Eurythmics&#x27; albums and, once the band became established, he also became a producer of other artists. In 1985, as well as producing Eurythmics&#x27; hit album &quot;Be Yourself Tonight&quot;, Stewart co-produced the album &quot;Southern Accents&quot; for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, as well as co-writing several songs for the album including the hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Around Here No More&quot;. The same year, Stewart also produced the debut solo album by Feargal Sharkey, which included the UK number one hit &quot;A Good Heart&quot;. Due to these accomplishments, Stewart won &quot;Best Producer&quot; at the 1986 BRIT Awards in London.

Stewart would go on to write and produce for a variety of other artists throughout the years. In 1986, he collaborated with Bob Geldof on tracks for his debut solo album &quot;Deep in the Heart of Nowhere&quot;. Working together, the duo named themselves &quot;The Brothers of Doom&quot;. Also in 1986, he co-produced the album &quot;Three Hearts in the Happy Ending Machine&quot; by Daryl Hall. The same year, he co-wrote and produced the song &quot;Is This Love?&quot; by Alison Moyet, a UK number 3.

Stewart also co-wrote and co-produced several tracks for Mick Jagger&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Primitive Cool&quot;.

In 1989, Stewart produced the debut album by Russian singer-songwriter Boris Grebenshchikov, &quot;Radio Silence&quot;.

In 1992, along with Marcella Detroit, he co-wrote the Shakespears Sister hit single &quot;Stay&quot; with his then-wife, Siobhan Fahey (with Stewart credited under the pseudonym &quot;Jean Guiot&quot;) as well as several other tracks for their second album &quot;Hormonally Yours&quot;. In this year Fahey also provided vocals on &quot;Walk into the Wind&quot; for Stewart&#x27;s group Vegas with Terry Hall, Olle Romö and Emmanuel &#x27;Manu&#x27; Guiot.

In 1993, Stewart co-wrote two tracks for German punk rock-singer Nina Hagen which were published on her sixth solo studio album &quot;Revolution Ballroom&quot;. He can also be heard on keyboards and contributed background vocals.

In 1996, Stewart produced the debut album by Alisha&#x27;s Attic, &quot;Alisha Rules the World&quot;, and wrote a few tracks on the third Shakespears Sister album &quot;#3&quot; (actually a solo album by Siobhan Fahey, which Fahey ended up releasing in 2004).

In 1997, Stewart co-produced the album &quot;Destination Anywhere&quot; for Jon Bon Jovi, and also co-wrote two tracks. The same year, he produced and co-wrote the album &quot;Come Alive&quot; with the actress and singer Rhona Mitra, who was in character as Lara Croft for the recording, because she was the official model for the character at that time. In 1999, Stewart and Mitra collaborated on a second Lara Croft album, titled &quot;Female Icon&quot;.

Stewart collaborated with Bryan Ferry on his 2002 album &quot;Frantic&quot;, co-writing several tracks and co-producing one of them.

He also co-wrote &quot;Friend or Foe&quot; for the Russian pop duo t.A.T.u., which is on their 2005 album &quot;Dangerous and Moving&quot;.

In 2008, Stewart was brought in by Ringo Starr to produce his album &quot;Liverpool 8&quot;, after Starr dismissed the album&#x27;s original producer, Mark Hudson. Hudson&#x27;s work on some tracks earned both Stewart and Hudson credits as co-producers (along with Starr himself).

In 2010, Stewart announced on his Twitter account he was co-writing and producing the new studio album by Stevie Nicks. The album, entitled &quot;In Your Dreams&quot;, was co-produced by Glen Ballard and released in May 2011.

In 2010, Stewart co-wrote and co-produced two songs with writer and composer Mark Warford &#x27;Lover Earth&#x27; and &#x27;Time, Faith, Love&#x27; for the charity-focused dramatised audio production, &#x27;A Voyage For Soldier Miles&#x27;.

On 24 February 2011, Stewart tweeted that he had just produced a new album by Joss Stone, stating that they also wrote 10 songs together.

On 10 October 2011, Stewart released a new song called &quot;Leap of faith&quot; in collaboration with Greek singer Anna Vissi. The official clip of the song was released in Anna&#x27;s fan club YouTube channel. Two days later, the Stewart produced Fire EP for artist Orianthi was released as an iTunes download.

He has worked occasionally with American ska-punk band No Doubt, co-writing &quot;Underneath It All&quot; for their 2001 release &quot;Rock Steady&quot; and &quot;Sparkle&quot; for their 2012 release &quot;Push and Shove&quot;.

In 2013, he worked with singer Lauren Harris on the pop rock project Kingdom of I. The track &quot;Crying at the Disco&quot; was released as a free download on Soundcloud later that year.

Stewart co-wrote and produced New Zealand singer Jon Stevens&#x27; album called &quot;Starlight,&quot; which was released in March 2017 and features a blues and soul influenced rock / powerpop sound.
Parallel to that, Stewart co-wrote and produced Australian singer Vanessa Amorosi&#x27;s studio album, which features &quot;soul gospel&quot; music. The album, &quot;Memphis Love&quot;, was released in November 2023 on Stewart&#x27;s independent label, Bay Street Records.

===Film, television and soundtrack work===
Stewart co-wrote, with Mick Jagger and Daryl Hall, the theme song for the 1986 comedy film &quot;Ruthless People&quot;. He took a greater involvement in the film industry in 1989 by writing and producing the soundtrack &quot;Lily Was Here&quot; for the Dutch film &quot;De Kassière&quot; (English title &quot;Lily Was Here&quot;). The single, also called &quot;Lily Was Here&quot; and featuring saxophone player Candy Dulfer, topped the Dutch charts for five weeks. The single also reached the UK Top 10 and peaked at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the summer of 1990.

Though he had previously directed music videos, he made his feature film directorial debut in 2000 with &quot;Honest&quot;, a black comedy set in Swinging London in the late 1960s featuring three members of the British girl group All Saints.

Stewart also performed the song &quot;Everybody, All Over The World (Join The Celebration)&quot; for the 2004 film &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;.

Stewart, in conjunction with his brother John J. Stewart of Oil Factory Productions, and in collaboration with music critic and author Robert Palmer and documentary filmmaker Robert Mugge made a documentary dealing with Delta Blues music. &quot;Deep Blues: A Musical Pilgrimage to the Crossroads&quot;, released in 1991, was filmed in Memphis, Tennessee and various north Mississippi counties. Palmer narrated.

Stewart was the main interviewer for the HBO series &quot;Off the Record&quot;, which is a show that highlights songwriting and features prominent musicians. The pilot aired on HBO on 24 November 2006 and featured Bono and The Edge from U2.

He collaborated with Mick Jagger to record songs which appear on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Alfie&quot;, released in 2004. The soundtrack includes the critically acclaimed song &quot;Old Habits Die Hard&quot;, which won a Golden Globe award for Best Original Song from a Motion Picture.

In 2010 the song Love Lives, originally from the 2009 EP Let&#x27;s Do It Again, is included in the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Repo Men&quot;.

In 2012, together with Rosemary Reed, Stewart was the executive co-producer of Living The Life series on Sky Arts. He also recorded an exclusive soundtrack for the new episodes.

Stewart is the co-creator and executive producer of the 2012 ABC sitcom &quot;Malibu Country&quot; starring Reba McEntire.

Stewart created and executive produces the NBC unscripted series &quot;Songland&quot;, which gives new songwriters a chance to have their original compositions recorded by an established artist, with a single released immediately following each episode. The panel of judges on &quot;Songland&quot; include Ryan Tedder, Ester Dean and Shane McAnally. The series premiered in the summer of 2019 and averaged 5.1 million viewers per episode, the most for a new unscripted series that summer. NBC announced that the series had been renewed for a second season in September 2019.

===Musical theatre===
Stewart wrote the musical &quot;Barbarella&quot;, based on the 1968 film, which premiered in Vienna on 11 March 2004. Stewart later wrote music and lyrics (with Glen Ballard) for &quot;Ghost the Musical&quot;, which premiered at the Manchester Opera House in March 2011, ahead of a transfer to the Piccadilly Theatre in London&#x27;s West End in June the same year; the show subsequently opened on Broadway in 2012.

In 2021 Stewart teamed up with Joss Stone to write and produce a new stage production of &quot;The Time Traveller&#x27;s Wife&quot;, based on the Audrey Niffenegger novel of the same name. The show received its premiere in September 2022 at the Storyhouse in Chester, before transferring to London&#x27;s west end, where it began previews at the Apollo Theatre in October 2023.

===Record label===
Though most of Stewart&#x27;s own music (specifically with Eurythmics) was released via the RCA/BMG label, he also formed his own record label in the 1980s called Anxious Records. The label has included a roster of artists such as Terry Hall, Londonbeat, Chris Braide and Curve vocalist Toni Halliday.

===Platinum Weird===

In 2006, Stewart resurrected Platinum Weird, a band he purportedly formed in the early 1970s in London with singer Erin Grace, but which was in reality created in 2004. According to the fictional account, Erin was moody and mysterious, and disappeared shortly before the band&#x27;s eponymous album was due to be released in 1974. Platinum Weird features noted songwriter Kara DioGuardi on vocals and the band has re-recorded some of the fictional original band&#x27;s songs and some new ones as well for an upcoming album. The album was produced by John Shanks.

In July 2006, VH1 premiered a mockumentary entitled &quot;Rock Legends – Platinum Weird&quot;, an examination of the band&#x27;s unusual story, complete with cameo appearances from such rock legends as Mick Jagger, Annie Lennox, Ringo Starr and Elton John, all reminiscing about the former band&#x27;s short-lived heyday and their impressions of the mysterious Erin Grace. The album was further promoted by a series of bogus World Wide Web fan sites, some of which are registered by the New Media Department of Interscope Records and hosted on the same server as interscope.com, and related false documents for the &quot;lost&quot; group.

=== Web3 Music ===
In 2021 Stewart a co-founded SongBits, a web3 music platform that focuses on fan-artist engagement.

<doc id="876606" wikidata="Q384206" url="?curid=876606" title="Dave Stewart (musician, born 1950)">
<text>David Lloyd Stewart (born 30 December 1950) is an English musician known for his work with the progressive rock bands Uriel, Egg, Khan, Hatfield and the North, National Health, and Bruford. Stewart is the author of two books on music theory and wrote a music column for &quot;Keyboard&quot; &quot;Magazine&quot; (USA) for thirteen years. He has also composed music for TV, film and radio, much of it for Victor Lewis-Smith&#x27;s production company. He has worked with singer Barbara Gaskin since 1981.

==History==
Stewart was born in Waterloo, London. Having joined local covers band The Southsiders while still at school, Stewart&#x27;s musical career began in earnest at the age of seventeen when he played organ in Uriel with Mont Campbell (bass, vocals), Steve Hillage (guitar, vocals) and Clive Brooks (drums). After a residency on the Isle of Wight in the summer of 1968, Hillage left the group to go to university. Uriel continued as a trio, later changed their name to Egg and subsequently recorded two albums for Decca. In 1969 Hillage briefly rejoined his former bandmates to record a one-off psychedelic album under the pseudonym Arzachel. In 1972 Stewart guested on Hillage&#x27;s new band Khan&#x27;s first album.

After the break-up of Egg in 1973, Stewart joined Hatfield and the North, described by author Jonathan Coe as &quot;probably the best-loved of the so-called &#x27;Canterbury&#x27; bands&quot;. (Coe&#x27;s novel &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot; takes its title from the band&#x27;s second album.) Hatfield broke up in 1975 and, after guesting with the Steve Hillage-led Gong on a few French gigs, Stewart founded National Health with fellow keyboardist Alan Gowen and ex-Hatfield guitarist Phil Miller. Finding a permanent drummer proved difficult; Bill Bruford played with the group for a few months and was eventually replaced by Pip Pyle, thereby reuniting three of the former Hatfield musicians. Stewart subsequently guested on Bill Bruford&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Feels Good to Me&quot; (1977), before joining his band Bruford.

Having recorded three albums and played two successful US tours, the Bruford group was discontinued in 1980. Stewart immediately formed Rapid Eye Movement with his friends Pip Pyle (drums), Rick Biddulph (who had been a roadie and sound engineer for Hatfield and National Health) on bass and Jakko Jakszyk (guitar &amp; vocals). The UK REM (not to be confused with the contemporaneous American band of the same name) was conceived primarily as a live band and never recorded an album, although poor-quality tapes of live concerts in France survive. Jakszyk recalls the band as being &quot;a lot rougher than National Health, very structured but performed in a very anarchic way&quot;.

In 1981 Stewart changed musical direction and began experimenting with pop arrangements and songwriting. His first solo release, a heavy electronic reworking of Jimmy Ruffin&#x27;s Motown soul classic &quot;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&quot;, featuring guest vocals by The Zombies&#x27; founder and vocalist Colin Blunstone, reached No. 13 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 34 in Australia. For a follow-up, Stewart recruited friend and former Hatfield backing vocalist Barbara Gaskin to record a version of the 1960s teen lament &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot;. Released in the autumn of 1981, the single reached No. 1 in Britain and Germany and topped the UK charts for four weeks. It also peaked at No.4 in Australia. Stewart and Gaskin have worked together ever since and have released seven albums. The duo occasionally play live gigs augmented by either Andy Reynolds (1990-2009) or Beren Matthews (2018 onwards) on guitar, and have performed in Tokyo (September 2001) and London (August 2018) as a quartet with Gavin Harrison on drums.

The keyboardist&#x27;s side projects include reforming National Health in 1981 to produce a memorial album for keyboardist Alan Gowen, producing the hit single &quot;Hole in My Shoe&quot; and &quot;Neil&#x27;s Heavy Concept Album&quot; for comedian Nigel Planer (well known for his hippie character in &quot;The Young Ones&quot;), and producing the first album by Bill Bruford&#x27;s electro-jazz outfit Earthworks.

Stewart has also composed TV music – in the mid-1980s he wrote the new title theme to the revamped BBC music show &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; and later wrote, produced, and performed much of the soundtrack to the TV drama series &quot;Lost Belongings&quot;, set in Northern Ireland. Since the 1990s, he has written music for TV programmes made by British production company Associated Rediffusion; these include the BBC series &quot;Inside Victor Lewis-Smith&quot; (1995), &quot;Ads Infinitum&quot; (BBC Two, 1999), and the 2003 documentary on the BBC Radiophonic Workshop &quot;Alchemists of Sound&quot;. In recent years, he has written string and choir arrangements for a number of acts, including Anathema, Porcupine Tree, and Steven Wilson (See &quot;Arranger&quot; below).

<text>Theognostus (, &quot;Feognost&quot;; died 11 March 1353) was a bishop of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople who served as Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27;.

== Life ==
Theognostus was born in Constantinople and later in his life became Peter&#x27;s successor as Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27;. He chose Moscow as his primary seat after he had lived for several years in Volodymyr in Volhynia.

It was his lot to reconcile Novgorod with the Grand Duchy of Moscow in times of their mutual animosity. Theognostus managed to save all of the Russian churches&#x27; valuables and gave up all his personal property after he had refused to collect tribute from the churches in favor of the Golden Horde. He was tortured by the Tatars for such audacity. It was the Khan who finally gave up and confirmed the existing privileges of the Russian Orthodox Church. After a fire swept through Moscow, Theognostus started to restore the churches.

In 1353, feeling that his days were numbered, Theognostus recommended Alexius (Bishop of Vladimir) his successor. Theognostus was buried in the Cathedral of the Dormition in Moscow. He was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in the 19th century.

<text>David Keith Stewart (born February 19, 1957), nicknamed &quot;Smoke&quot;, is an American professional baseball executive, pitching coach, sports agent, and former starting pitcher. The Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; 16th-round selection in the 1975 MLB draft, Stewart&#x27;s MLB playing career spanned from 1978 through 1995, winning three World Series championships all with different clubs while compiling a career 3.95 earned run average (ERA) and a 168–129 won–lost record, including winning 20 games in four consecutive seasons. He pitched for the Dodgers, Texas Rangers, Philadelphia Phillies, Oakland Athletics, and Toronto Blue Jays.

Stewart was an MLB All-Star and was known for his intimidating pitching style and his postseason performance, winning one World Series Most Valuable Player Award and two League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Awards. After his playing career, he served as a pitching coach for the San Diego Padres, Milwaukee Brewers, and Blue Jays and as an assistant GM. General managers he has worked under include Sandy Alderson, Kevin Towers, Gord Ash, and Dean Taylor. He later became a sports agent based in San Diego until the Arizona Diamondbacks hired him as general manager at the end of the 2014 season, a position he held until 2016.

==Early life==
Stewart was born in Oakland, California. His father, David, was a longshoreman, and his mother, Nathalie, worked at a cannery. His father didn&#x27;t want Stewart to play sports, because he felt nobody could make a living hitting a ball, so his older brother taught him how to play. As a kid, Stewart spent many days at the East Oakland Branch of the Oakland Boys Club.

Stewart attended St. Elizabeth High School in Oakland, where he earned All-American honors in both baseball (where he played catcher) and in football (where he was a linebacker and tight end). He also averaged 16 points per game as a small forward on the basketball team. He was offered 30 college scholarships to play football, but turned them all down to sign with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who selected him in the 16th round of the 1975 Major League Baseball draft.

==Professional career==

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
The Dodgers decided to turn Stewart into a pitcher because of his strong arm. He made his professional debut with the Bellingham Dodgers of the short-season single-A Northwest League. He had a 0–5 win–loss record with a 5.51 earned run average (ERA) in 22 games pitched, five of which were games started, for a Bellingham team that set a record by losing the first 24 games of the season. He was promoted to the Midwest League at the end of the 1976 season and with the Clinton Dodgers in 1977 he had a breakout season: 17–4 with a 2.15 ERA in 24 starts, including 15 complete games and 3 shutouts. Despite his impressive season, he lost out on the Midwest League MVP and Top prospect honors to future Hall of Famer Paul Molitor, then with the Burlington Bees. Stewart was promoted to the AA San Antonio Dodgers of the Texas League for the 1978 season. He was 14–12 with a 3.68 ERA in 28 starts for San Antonio.

Stewart made his major league debut on September 22, 1978, pitching two innings in relief against the San Diego Padres. He allowed only one hit and no runs while striking out one batter (Jim Beswick). That was his only appearance for the Dodgers that season. Stewart spent all of the 1979 and 1980 seasons in AAA with the Albuquerque Dukes. Despite an 11–12 record and 5.24 ERA in 28 games for the Dukes in 1979, Stewart felt he pitched well and was disappointed when he did not receive a September call-up. In 1980, he was 15–10 with a 3.70 ERA for a Dukes team that won the Pacific Coast League (PCL) Championship. He led the PCL in innings pitched (202) and starts (29) and tied for the league lead in wins (15).

Stewart went to spring training with the Dodgers in 1981. Because he was out of options, the Dodgers could not send him back down to the minors without risk of losing him to another team. They initially planned to release him, but eventually cut Don Stanhouse instead. He made the Dodgers opening day roster and pitched in relief that season, appearing in 32 games with a 2.49 ERA and six saves. He got his first Major League win in his first appearance of the season, on April 13 against the San Francisco Giants, when he worked two scoreless innings in relief of Bob Welch. His first save was recorded on August 16 against the Atlanta Braves. When MLB&#x27;s players went on a two-month long strike on June 12, Stewart was hard pressed financially and went to work for a Dodger fan that owned a metal fastener business and worked out with a semi-pro team along with teammate Bobby Castillo. The Dodgers made the split-season playoffs and Stewart saw his first taste of post-season action, being credited as the losing pitcher in the first two games of the Division Series against the Houston Astros. He allowed a walk-off homer to Alan Ashby in game one and allowing the winning runs to reach base in the 11th inning of game two. He redeemed himself by not allowing a run in the two games he appeared in for the Dodgers in the 1981 World Series against the New York Yankees, which the Dodgers won in six games.

He spent time as both a starter and a reliever in 1982, appearing in 45 games (starting 14 of them) and was 9–8 with a 3.81 ERA. The Dodgers almost traded Stewart to the Texas Rangers after the 1982 season in a package for catcher Jim Sundberg, however, Sundberg wouldn&#x27;t waive his no-trade clause and the deal fell apart. In 1983, he appeared in 46 games for the Dodgers, all but one as a relief pitcher, with a 5–2 record and a 2.96 ERA. On July 11, he was part of a play that Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda called one of the &quot;craziest&quot; moments he&#x27;d ever seen, when three runs scored on a wild pitch.

===Texas Rangers===

On August 19, 1983, the Dodgers traded Stewart with a player to be named later (Ricky Wright) to the Rangers for Rick Honeycutt. The trade was controversial at the time, with many feeling that Rangers GM Joe Klein had gotten too little in exchange for his team&#x27;s best pitcher. The Rangers placed Stewart in the starting rotation. He made eight starts down the stretch, going 5–2 with a 2.14 ERA. In 1984, however, Stewart struggled, producing a 7–14 record and a 4.73 ERA in 27 starts before losing his rotation spot. Tom House joined the organization in January 1985 as the team&#x27;s new pitching coach. He decided that Stewart needed a new pitch and started teaching him a split-fingered fastball.

In 1985, the Rangers used Stewart as a relief pitcher, but his performances out of the bullpen were poor. On May 22 he gave up a three-run homer to Jorge Orta of the Kansas City Royals, giving up the lead. The home fans booed him off the field; after the game, Stewart called the fans &quot;idiots&quot; and challenged them to come on to the field and do his job for him. The team&#x27;s new general manager, Tom Grieve, fined Stewart $500 for his remarks, but that wasn&#x27;t enough for Rangers owner Eddie Chiles, who demanded that Grieve trade Stewart. After finding a weak market for him, the Rangers finally managed to trade Stewart to the Philadelphia Phillies on September 13, 1985, for pitcher Rick Surhoff. In 42 games for the Rangers in 1985, Stewart was 0–6 with a 5.42 ERA.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
In the off-season, he negotiated with the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball, but they did not agree to terms on a contract so he re-signed with the Phillies.

Stewart appeared in 12 games for the team over parts of the 1985 and 1986 seasons, recording a 6.00 ERA. There were rumors that Stewart had been pitching injured, but the Phillies still released him on May 9, 1986. Stewart later said that the Phillies lied to him, and that they had said if he kept his nose clean he would get somewhere, but instead he was released.

===Oakland Athletics===
Stewart had a try-out with the Baltimore Orioles, but they told him they didn&#x27;t even have a spot for him in Double-A. He wound up signing a free agent contract with the Oakland Athletics on May 23, 1986. After one game with The Triple-A Tacoma Tigers, Stewart joined the A&#x27;s roster. In a game on July 1, he punched Pat Corrales, the manager of the Cleveland Indians, during a game, which initiated a bench-clearing brawl. He was suspended four games and fined for his actions. Also in 1986, Stewart developed a forkball to supplement his fastball and slider. He pitched in 29 games for the Athletics in 1986, with 17 starts. He was 9–5 with a 3.74 ERA.

Stewart signed a two-year $500,000 contract with the Athletics prior to the 1987 season. He won 20 games in 1987, while posting a 3.68 ERA and striking out 205 batters. He credited pitching coach Dave Duncan with helping improve his pitches. In 1988 he won his first eight games and claimed the Major League Baseball Pitcher of the Month Award. He went 21–12 with a 3.23 ERA, while leading the American League (AL) with 14 complete games and innings pitched. Stewart started two games in the A&#x27;s four-game sweep of the Boston Red Sox in the 1988 American League Championship Series. After the series, his manager Tony La Russa said he had &quot;never met a player or person of higher quality.&quot; Stewart was the starting pitcher in game one of the 1988 World Series against the Dodgers. Prior to the game, he told Dodgers&#x27; second baseman Steve Sax that he was going to hit him in the neck during the game. He came close, drilling Sax in the left shoulder and glaring at him. He allowed three runs in eight innings and was in line for the win before Kirk Gibson&#x27;s walk-off homer off closer Dennis Eckersley gave the game to the Dodgers. Working on three days rest, Stewart was not as good in game four, allowing four runs (only two earned) and leaving the game with one out in the sixth to pick up the loss. The Dodgers finished off their championship with a win in Game five.

In 1989, Stewart was 21–9 with a 3.32 ERA in 36 starts. His manager, La Russa, was also the manager of the American League team at the All-Star Game and picked Stewart to start for the AL team over fan favorite Nolan Ryan. He allowed two runs to score in his one inning of work in the game. He finished second in the voting for the American League Cy Young Award to Kansas City Royals pitcher Bret Saberhagen.

In the 1989 American League Championship Series, Stewart won both of the games he pitched with a 2.81 ERA. In the World Series, Stewart pitched a complete-game shutout in the first game against the San Francisco Giants. The series was interrupted when an earthquake struck the Bay Area just prior to the start of Game 3. When the series resumed, 10 days later, Stewart started game three for the A&#x27;s, and picked up his second win of the series when he allowed three runs in seven innings. The A&#x27;s swept the series in four games and Stewart was selected as the MVP of the series going 2–0 with a 1.69 ERA. Stewart signed a new two-year $7 million contract extension with the Athletics after the season. This was the largest contract in baseball at the time.

In 1990, Stewart was 22–11 (his fourth straight 20-win season and tied for 2nd in the majors) with a 2.56 ERA in 36 starts. He led the league in innings pitched (267), complete games (11) and shutouts (4) while being third in ERA and finishing third in the Cy Young voting. On June 29, he no-hit the Toronto Blue Jays, at SkyDome, the first no-hitter by an African American since Jim Bibby in 1973. That same day, Fernando Valenzuela of the Dodgers no-hit the St. Louis Cardinals at Dodger Stadium – the first time in Major League history that no-hitters had been thrown in both leagues on the same day. The A&#x27;s won their third straight pennant, beating the Boston Red Sox in the American League Championship Series, and Stewart was named the ALCS MVP going 2–0 with a 1.13 ERA. Stewart got the start in Game one of the 1990 World Series for the heavily favored A&#x27;s against the Cincinnati Reds. However, Eric Davis hit a two-run home run off him in the first inning and he only lasted four innings as the Reds pulled off the upset. He pitched better in game four, allowing only one earned run while pitching a complete game, but the Reds won the game and finished off a sweep of the series. Despite being the losing pitcher in games 1 and 4, Stewart had a 2.77 ERA in the 1990 World Series.

After the 1990 season, Stewart was part of a Major League All-Star team that played an eight-game series in Japan against a Japanese all-star team. He went on the disabled list for the first time in his career in 1991 because of a strained rib muscle, which caused him to miss three weeks of the season. When he returned he was not as dominant as he had been before. His troubles were partly because of an inability to throw his forkball for strikes and as a result he was pitching with less confidence. In 35 starts, Stewart finished 11–11 with a league-high 5.18 ERA in 1991 as the Athletics missed the playoffs for the first time since 1987.

Stewart was bothered by elbow tendinitis for much of the 1992 season but still made 31 starts (his fewest since 1986) and had a 12–10 record and 3.66 ERA. The A&#x27;s returned to the playoffs, but this time were seen as underdogs to the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League Championship Series. Stewart started the opener of the series and pitched 7.2 innings while allowing only three runs in a game the A&#x27;s won. The A&#x27;s lost the next three games and were on the verge of elimination, so he called a team meeting in order to give his teammates a pep talk. He responded by pitching a complete game victory in game five, allowing only two runs. It was the first complete game victory in an ALCS game since Bruce Hurst of the Boston Red Sox pitched one in 1986 against the California Angels. However, the Blue Jays won the next game to take the series and eliminate the A&#x27;s from the post-season.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
Stewart signed a two-year, $8.5 million contract with the Blue Jays on December 8, 1992. He said that he was sad to leave the A&#x27;s, whom he had envisioned spending the rest of his career with, but he felt the Blue Jays treated him with more respect with their offer. He said that the A&#x27;s general manager, Sandy Alderson, was disrespectful of him and all he had done for Oakland, and was insulted that he was accused of disloyalty when he signed with the Blue Jays.

As a member of the Blue Jays rotation in 1993, Stewart made 26 starts and was 12–8 with a 4.44 ERA. He suffered from a number of injuries during the season but the Blue Jays stuck with him because of his heart and competitiveness, as well as the support he offered to other pitchers on the staff. The Blue Jays made it to the ALCS where Stewart got the call in game two. He allowed only one run in six innings of work to pick up the win. The day before his next start, while the rest of his team was already in Chicago, he was in Toronto helping the Salvation Army deliver food to the homeless on Thanksgiving Day in Canada. He made it to the game on time, and pitched 7.1 innings for his second win of the series, in the clinching game six that sent the Blue Jays back to the World Series. He was selected as ALCS MVP for the second time in his career. In the 1993 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, Stewart got the start in game two and struggled, allowing five runs in six innings to take a rare post-season loss. Nevertheless, he was confident heading into his next start, in game six, saying he was pitching for respect as much as for another championship. He allowed four runs in six innings but that was enough as the Blue Jays, thanks to a three-run walk-off homer by Joe Carter, won the game 8–6 and with it took the series, 4 games to 2.

Stewart remained with the Blue Jays for the 1994 season, making 22 starts for them with a 7–8 record and 5.87 ERA before the 1994–95 MLB strike wiped out the rest of the season in August (and delayed the start of the next season). He had planned to retire at the end of the season but was bothered by the lack of empathy on the part of the fans toward the players. He would later say that he never felt the same passion for baseball after the strike.

===Return to the Oakland Athletics and retirement===
When the strike finally ended, he re-signed with the Athletics on April 8, 1995, and was their opening day starter on April 26, 1995. However, he could not recapture his prior form. Stewart was rocked for nine runs and was removed from the game with only one out in the second inning. In 16 starts, he was 3–7 with a 6.89 ERA, prompting the manager to announce publicly that Stewart would move to the bullpen for the first time since 1986 and be replaced in the rotation by Todd van Poppel. Stewart chose to retire rather than make the move to the pen. He made the public announcement on July 24, 1995, saying it was a low point in his life and he just couldn&#x27;t perform like he wanted to anymore.

Over his career, he started 18 games in the postseason, compiling a stellar 2.84 ERA and 10–6 (10–4 as a starter) record. In the LCS, he was especially dominant, going 8–0.

==Post-playing career==

Stewart served as the assistant to Sandy Alderson, the general manager of the Athletics, in 1996. In 1997, he left that position to serve in a similar capacity under Kevin Towers of the San Diego Padres. In 1998, he agreed to become the Padres&#x27; pitching coach, despite some worry that it would detract from his goal of becoming a GM and some personal conflict between him and team president Larry Lucchino. He turned around a pitching staff that had been awful the year before and helped get the team into the World Series. Several of the Padres pitchers (including Andy Ashby, Sterling Hitchcock and Joey Hamilton) credited Stewart directly with the improvement of the staff. He maintained some of his front office duties, including running the Latin America scouting department, during the season and often remarked that he would leave for the right front office position.

Stewart left San Diego after the season and interviewed for assistant GM positions with Oakland and the Florida Marlins. He was a finalist to replace Frank Wren in Florida, but his concern about the high crime rate in South Florida led him to turn down the position. His familiarity with the Blue Jays organization was the main reason he accepted the job there under Gord Ash. When the Blue Jays fired pitching coach Rick Langford in the middle of the 2000 season, Stewart moved into the position on July 24, 2000. After the 2001 season, when the Blue Jays had an opening at general manager, they passed on Stewart, hiring J. P. Ricciardi instead. Stewart chose to resign from his dual role as pitching coach and assistant general manager. He was outspoken about the fact that he felt minorities were being discriminated against in the front office and that the decision by team president Paul Godfrey was racist. Frustrated, he said, &quot;I think the whole process is a waste of time.&quot;

He joined the Milwaukee Brewers as their pitching coach for the 2002 season under manager Davey Lopes. After the team started 3–12, Lopes was fired and Stewart was a candidate to replace him, but it instead went to bench coach Jerry Royster. He resigned on July 29, 2002, in order to care for his mother and spend more time with family. After leaving that position, he was the pitching coach for the United States national baseball team at the Olympic Qualifying tournament.

Stewart started a sports agency called Sports Management Partners. His first big deal was negotiating a six-year, $66 million contract extension between the A&#x27;s and third baseman Eric Chavez. He also negotiated contracts for Matt Kemp and Chad Billingsley.

On September 25, 2014, the Arizona Diamondbacks hired Stewart to become their general manager, replacing Towers; he was the fourth GM hired by the team since 2010. He reported to La Russa, his former manager when he played for Oakland, who served as the Diamondbacks&#x27; chief baseball officer. He transferred his management company to former A&#x27;s teammate Dave Henderson and his wife, Lonnie Murray, when he took the Diamondbacks job. On December 4, 2015, the Diamondbacks agreed to a six-year contract with free agent pitcher Zack Greinke worth a total of $206.5 million. At that time, it held the highest annual average value in MLB, exceeding $34.4 million per year, and was also the largest contract by total value in team history. Stewart later said of the contract, &quot;It could be franchise-changing for us, if everything goes well.&quot; Five days later, they traded for Shelby Miller and Gabe Speier, doing so by trading Dansby Swanson, Ender Inciarte, and Aaron Blair to the Atlanta Braves.

The Diamondbacks went 79–83 in 2015 and 69–93 in 2016 with Stewart as general manager. On October 3, 2016, Stewart and manager Chip Hale (hired around the same time as Stewart) were fired by the Diamondbacks.

Stewart was about to have his #34 jersey retired by the Oakland Athletics in 2020, but the ceremony was postponed until further notice, due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the lack of plans in 2021 prompted questions from fans and even Stewart himself in April 2022 before it was announced that Stewart will have his jersey retired by the Athletics on September 11, 2022. Stewart would break the A&#x27;s tradition in that his number would be a re-retirement, as well as his not being in the Hall of Fame.

In 2021, following the Dodgers victory in the 2020 World Series, Stewart said he would not be attending the 40th anniversary celebration of the Dodgers’ 1981 World Series championship because of how he believed the team mishandled the Trevor Bauer sexual assault allegations by waiting an entire week to put him on administrative leave.

On January 22, 2025, Stewart rejoined the Athletics front office, serving as special assistant to player development director Ed Sprague Jr.

==Personal life==
Stewart and his ex-wife, Vanessa, have two children, Adrian and Alyse. Stewart is romantically linked to sports agent Lonnie Murray.

In 1985, Stewart was arrested on suspicion of lewd conduct with a prostitute later revealed to be a trans woman. After pleading no contest to a lesser charge of soliciting a prostitute, Stewart&#x27;s judgment was a fine, probation, and a suspended sentence. Two days after the arrest, Stewart was honored with the Good Guys award from Dallas-Fort Worth sportswriters. Accepting the award, he admitted both his guilt and that he was ashamed.

In 1994, Stewart and teammate Todd Stottlemyre stood trial for seven days in Hillsborough County, Florida on charges of battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest with violence. Stewart also faced charges of disorderly conduct. Stewart was accused of punching a police officer in the face at a club. The jury deliberated for 36 minutes before finding the pitchers not guilty.

<doc id="876611" wikidata="Q720682" url="?curid=876611" title="Asalha Puja">
<text>Āsāḷha Pūjā () is a Theravada Buddhist festival which typically takes place in July, on the full moon of the Āsādha month. It is celebrated in Indonesia, Cambodia (), Thailand, Sri Lanka, Laos, Myanmar and in other countries with Theravada Buddhist populations. In Indonesia, the festival is centered at Mendut Temple and Borobudur Temple, Central Java.

Asalha Puja, also known as Dharma Day, is one of Theravada Buddhism&#x27;s most important festivals, celebrating as it does the Buddha&#x27;s first sermon, the Sermon in the Deer Park at Sarnath, in which he set out to his five former associates the doctrine that had come to him following his enlightenment. This first pivotal sermon, often referred to as “setting into motion the wheel of dhamma,” is the teaching which is encapsulated for Buddhists in the Four Noble Truths: there is suffering (dukkha); suffering is caused by craving (tanha); there is a state (nibbana) beyond suffering and craving; and finally, the way to nirvana is via the Noble Eightfold Path. All the various schools and traditions of Buddhism revolve around this central doctrine.

This first sermon is not only the first structured discourse given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, it also contains the essence of all his subsequent teaching. At the end of the talk, one of the five participants recounted his understanding of what had been said and asked to be received as a disciple, a request the Buddha granted, thus establishing the first order of monks.

The day is observed by donating offerings to temples and listening to sermons. The following day is known in Thailand as &quot;Wan Khao Phansa&quot;; it is the first day of Vassa, the Theravada rains retreat.

<text>Mesa Community College (MCC) is a public community college in Mesa, Arizona. It is the largest of the 10 community colleges in the Maricopa County Community College District, the largest community college district in the United States in terms of enrollment.

== History ==
MCC was launched by Mart Godinez in 1963 as an extension branch of Phoenix College and was located at 809 W. Main Street in Mesa. There were 330 students registered for classes the first semester at Mesa Extension on September 11, 1963. John Riggs was appointed as the first president. Mesa students voted Hokams as the nickname for their athletic teams in 1964. Capital funds from the bond election in 1964 enabled Mesa Community College to purchase 120 acres, with an option to purchase an adjoining 40 acres, for the new campus at Dobson and Southern Roads in Mesa. The three building campus included a science building, student center and maintenance building. The buildings were designed by Mesa architects Horlbeck, Hickman &amp; Associates and Tempe architect Kemper Goodwin, and built by Tibschraney Bros. Construction Company. In addition to the three permeate buildings portable buildings were used for the first several years, until the campus was able to expand.

On April 12, 1965, the Maricopa Junior College District Board named Mesa Community College and Glendale Community College as separate institutions from Phoenix College. Mesa Community College graduated its first class on its new campus in ceremonies May 29, 1968. The library and classroom building was completed in 1968. In 1969 Tibschraney Bros. completed construction of the campus with completion of the gymnasium, athletic fields, technology building, social science building, faculty office building and business education building. The music building was completed in 1970 followed by the nursing building in 1974. That same year, MCC&#x27;s mascot changed from Hokam to Thunderbird, also at this time Helena Howe was appointed president. A liberal arts building was added in 1976. The Outback Theater was built in 1978 That same year Theo J. Heap became president of the college. In 1982 a health improvement center was built near the gymnasium. The technology building opened in 1984 and was designed by architects Hickman, Schafer &amp; Truley, that same year Wallace A. Simpson became president. The east gymnasium was added in 1986. Bar code technology came to the library in 1987 as part of a new automation system. Bar codes were assigned to every item in the library&#x27;s collection, and appeared on student ID cards for the first time. From 1986 to 1987 the Business/Psychology building, Social/Cultural Science building and testing center were built. In 1988 Larry K. Christianson became president. The Kirk Student Center was expanded in 1988 and a clock tower was added at the entrance in 1990. In 1999 the Paul A. Elsner Library a new larger library opened adjacent to the old, the old library building was subsequently remodeled and is now the academic support building. A new life science building was also added at this time. 

Phase I construction began for Red Mountain Campus in 2000, which included four buildings: the Desert Willow Building (library &amp; commons), Mesquite Building (student &amp; administrative services), Palo Verde Building (classrooms &amp; laboratories), and the Ironwood Building. (central plant). A groundbreaking ceremony was held in April, 2000.

In 2004 MCC was visited by then President George W. Bush who discussed his proposal for $250 Million federal grant for job training across the United States.

<text>The Barwon River is a perennial river of the Corangamite catchment, located in The Otways and the Bellarine Peninsula regions of the Australian state of Victoria.

==Location and features==
Fed by the confluence of the East and West Branches of the river, the Barwon River rises in the Otway Ranges and flows generally north by east and then east, joined by thirteen tributaries including the Leigh and Moorabool rivers and flowing through Lake Connewarre, before reaching its mouth and emptying into Bass Strait at Barwon Heads. The river flows adjacent to the settlement of Winchelsea and Greater Geelong. The estuarine section of the river forms part of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar Site as a wetland of international importance, as well as of the Bellarine Wetlands Important Bird Area. From its highest point including its source confluence, the river descends over its course.

The river is crossed by a number of bridges in Geelong. Of particular note is the unusual one-lane truss bridge in Newtown, Geelong. The &quot;Breakwater&quot; in East Geelong was constructed by Foster Fyans to supply drinking water.

Water from the river feeds agriculture and industry. The river is a popular recreation spot for Geelong, with parklands such as Balyang Sanctuary along the banks, and sees use by water skiers and rowing regattas such as Head of the River.

==Etymology==
The river&#x27;s name is derived from the Aboriginal word Parwan, meaning either &quot;magpie&quot; or &quot;great wide&quot;.

In the Aboriginal Wathawurrung language the names for the river are &quot;Worragong&quot;, with no clearly defined meaning, &quot;Nellemengobeet&quot;, meaning &quot;lagoon at mouth&quot;, and &quot;Barrwang&quot;, meaning &quot;magpie&quot;.

The Boonwurrung group, who occupied the Geelong region before the Wathawurrung, called the river Nooarn, which is believed to have meant &quot;great eel&quot;, for the giant eel that was believed to have lived in it.

==Towns==
Towns the river flows through include:
* Forrest
* Barwon Downs
* Birregurra
* Winchelsea
* Inverleigh
* Geelong
* Ocean Grove
* Barwon Heads

==Dams and weirs==
Ordered upstream to downstream:

===West Barwon Dam===
The West Barwon Dam was constructed near Forrest in 1965 by what is now Barwon Water. The dam is now the major water supply for Geelong.

===Buckley Falls===
Buckley Falls is located between Highton and Fyansford. A weir and water race was built above the falls in 1876 to provide power for the Fyansford Paper Mill. The falls were named by John Helder Wedge after escaped convict William Buckley, who lived in the area with Aborigines for 32 years from 1803.

===The &quot;Breakwater&quot;===
The &quot;Breakwater&quot; is located in the Geelong suburb of the same name. Originally built to prevent salt water moving upstream, it now keeps the river level through Geelong constant and was an important crossing point until it was replaced in 2012 by a bridge about 350m upstream. Construction on the weir started in late 1838 under Captain Foster Fyans and was completed by May 1840. Built by convicts, the weir failed in flood in 1844, not being fully rebuilt until 1849. Little changed to the breakwater until it was rebuilt by the Country Roads Board for modern traffic in the mid 1960s.

===Barrage===
A second weir was built over the Barwon River further downstream. Located near where the river enters Lake Connewarre, the barrage again keeps water levels constant upstream for waterskiers, and prevents saltwater moving upstream into Reedy Lake.

==Bridges==
Ordered upstream to downstream:

===Barwon River Bridge===
The Barwon River Bridge at Winchelsea was erected in 1867 for the Council of the Shire of Winchelsea, replacing an earlier timber structure of 1849. The three span arch structure was built of bluestone by James Sinclair at a cost of £4,602 and officially opened by Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, on 3 December 1867. The Barwon River Bridge is the third structure erected at this historic crossing place and has since 1867 provided an important link with Geelong and the Western District. This finely proportioned masonry arch bridge, one of the most impressive stone structures in Victoria, has a notable association with Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the three times royal visitor to nearby &#x27;Barwon Park&#x27; mansion. The Barwon River Bridge, which is still in regular use, has recently been rehabilitated. A new reinforced concrete structure, located beside the bluestone bridge, partly relieves the heavy traffic loads.

===Pollocksford Bridge===
The single-lane bridge, located in Gnarwarre, carries Pollocksford Road over the river.

The original bridge, consisting of four bluestone piers supporting a timber superstructure, was constructed in the 1850s. Reconstruction of the bridge began in the 1910s, which replaced the timber superstructure with a new structure made of iron and steel, but retained the original bluestone piers. The reconstructed bridge was opened on 14 February 1921 by Victorian Premier Harry Lawson.

===Geoff Thom Bridge===
The twin bridges, opened on 15 June 2009, carries the four-lane Geelong Ring Road over the river. The bridge is named after Geoffrey Thom, former member of the Victorian Legislative Council.

===Queens Bridge===
The single-lane Queens Bridge carries Queens Park Road, which links Highton and Newtown. The location was originally the site of a punt, with a wooden cattle crossing being provided in 1861. Those crossing the bridge were charged a toll. The bridge collapsed in the 1870 flood, and a new wooden bridge opened in 1872. The toll ended 1877. The bridge was wrecked by the 1909 flood, but was rebuilt. The current one-lane steel bridge was opened in 1930. A water main and footpath were added on one side in 1963, and the height and deck have been modified in later years.

===Princes Bridge===
The two-lane Princes Bridge carries Shannon Avenue between Belmont and Newtown. It is the third bridge on the site, all of which have been named after Prince Albert, the consort of Queen Victoria. A bridge was first proposed for the site in the 1850s as a second Barwon crossing in Geelong. At the time many wanted the bridge to be located at end of Pakington Street, but they were defeated. The wooden &quot;Prince Albert Bridge&quot; was constructed by the City of Newtown in 1861, named after Prince Albert, who had died that year.

The bridge was originally not tolled, and provided competition for the Barwon Bridge on Moorabool Street, which was tolled by the South Barwon Shire. As a result, the shire erected a fence across new bridge to prevent people from using it, but the fence was removed several times by an unknown party, which led to a guard being stationed there. At the same time, the Newtown and Chilwell Council decided to erect its own toll gate at the new bridge, so the South Barwon council retaliated by erecting a &quot;check toll&quot; gate on its side of the river. The Newtown and Chilwell councillors refused to pay the toll, which remained for another year.

With the bridge becoming dilapidated, a tender accepted in June 1888 for the construction of a replacement. Provided with separated lanes, the new wooden bridge was opened on 31 May 1889. In 1959, extensive repairs were carried out to handle much heavier traffic from the expansion of Highton. That proved to be a short-term measure, and in June 1965 the wooden bridge was replaced by current steel girder bridge, which is upstream of older bridges. To avoid flooding, the new bridge was connected to Shannon Avenue by a high level embankment, which skirts what became Balyang Sanctuary in 1973.

===McIntyre Bridge===
The long McIntyre Bridge is located upstream of the James Harrison Bridge, and is a post-tensioned, pre-stressed stayed girder bridge, carrying a sewer pipe with a concrete pedestrian walkway above. Constructed in 1967 to carry sewage from Geelong to the ocean outfall at Black Rock, the bridge provided relief for the 1916 sewer aqueduct further downstream. It was designed by Jan van der Molen, and was one of the first in Australia to use computer engineering in the design process.

===James Harrison Bridge===
The four-lane, 82-metre James Harrison Bridge carries the Princes Highway though Geelong. Construction started in 1988 and was completed in September 1990, removing heavy through traffic from the main Belmont shopping centre. Consisting of twin parallel two lane bridges, The main river span is of concrete cantilever design, with a number of smaller concrete box girder spans completing the viaduct to the south. The bridge was named after Geelong engineer and refrigeration pioneer James Harrison.

===Temporary Barwon Bridge===
While the Barwon Bridge at Moorabool Street was being rebuilt in the mid-1920s, to allow for the extension of the tram system to Belmont, a temporary wooden bridge was provided as an alternative. It linked the end of Latrobe Terrace on the northern bank with Barrabool Road on the southern bank.

===Barwon Bridge===
The four-lane Barwon Bridge carries Moorabool Street over the river, and is located on the site of the first Barwon crossing. The first wooden bridge opened early in 1848. Tolled by the South Barwon council, it was swept away in a flood four years later, on 23 May 1852. From December that year a government punt operated at the site. By late 1853, two government punts were used to form a pontoon bridge. It was not until 1859 that a proper iron bridge was opened as a replacement. That bridge was only two lanes wide and was considered too narrow to permit the extension of trams into Belmont, so it was closed and dismantled in 1924.

The new bridge was designed by Country Roads Board engineer Donald Darwin and was opened on 18 August 1926 by Governor of Victoria, Lord Somers. Of concrete and steel girder construction, it was built by Armstrong Whitworth and cost A£ (A$). In 1966, the bridge was widened to four lanes by extending each side of the deck.

===Breakwater road and rail bridges===
The original Breakwater Bridge was a ford running on top of the breakwater. A timber trestle railway bridge was built over the top in 1876 when the Geelong railway line was extended to Winchelsea. That bridge was replaced by a concrete and steel girder bridge in the 1960s, although the remains of the wooden supports of the former bridge are still visible.

A low-level road causeway was built across the breakwater by the Country Roads Board in the mid 1960s. The causeway had a restricted clearance underneath the railway bridge, and was only about a metre (3 ft) above the water level. As a consequence, a number of trucks became stuck under the railway bridge, and the causeway also required frequent closure due to river flooding. To overcome those problems, VicRoads received planning permission in 2009 to replace the low-level crossing with a new bridge about 350m upstream, at a cost of $63 million, which was completed in mid-2012.

===Sewer Aqueduct===
An aqueduct was constructed between 1913 and 1916 to carry sewage across the Barwon River from Geelong to an ocean outfall at Black Rock. Of reinforced concrete construction, it was an unusual design, and is listed on the Victorian National Estate Register. The designer was engineer Edward Giles Stone, who erected many daring structures using reinforced concrete. It has 14 cantilever spans, and has an overall length of more than . The viaduct was decommissioned in 1993. Because of falling debris, caused by the loss of calcium from the concrete used in the construction, the land and river underneath the aqueduct has been fenced to prevent public access. The aqueduct was replaced by a pump-boosted gravity system, including twin siphon pipes under the river.

===Barwon Heads Bridge===

The two-lane wooden bridge between Barwon Heads and Ocean Grove was built in 1927. Before this time a ferry ran by Tom Abernathy operated across the mount of the Barwon. The bridge was used in filming the ABC TV series &quot;SeaChange&quot;. In July 2006, the Government of Victoria shelved plans to replace the heritage-listed bridge with a new one, with plans put forward for an upgraded to be carried out instead. The new Barwon Heads Bridge was constructed in 2010.

<text>William McKendree Gwin (October 9, 1805 – September 3, 1885) was an American medical doctor and politician who served in elected office in Mississippi and California. In California he shared the distinction, along with John C. Frémont, of being the state&#x27;s first U.S. senators. Before, during, and after the Civil War, Gwin was well known in California, Washington, D.C., and the Southern United States as a determined Confederate sympathizer.

==Early life==
Gwin was born near Gallatin, Tennessee. His father was Reverend James Gwin, a pioneer Methodist minister, who served under the prominent Reverend William McKendree, America&#x27;s first native-born Methodist bishop and namesake of the younger Gwin. James Gwin served as a soldier on the frontier under General Andrew Jackson. William Gwin pursued classical studies and graduated from the medical department of Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1828.

==Political career==
As the son of a chaplain who was at the Battle of New Orleans, the young Gwin served as a personal secretary to President Andrew Jackson during the latter&#x27;s second term. Gwin then practiced medicine in Clinton, Mississippi, until 1833, when he became the United States Marshal for Mississippi, serving for one year. He was elected as a Democrat from Mississippi to the 27th Congress of 1841 to 1843. Declining a renomination for Congress on account of financial embarrassment, he was appointed, on the accession of James K. Polk to the Presidency, to superintend the building of the new custom-house at New Orleans, Louisiana. He moved to California in 1849 and participated in the 1849 California Constitutional Convention. He also purchased property in Paloma, California, where a gold mine was established. The Gwin Mine would eventually yield millions of dollars, providing him with a fortune. He also organized the &quot;Chivalry&quot; wing of the Democratic Party.

Before the admission of California as a U.S. state, Gwin was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate. He served from September 10, 1850, to March 3, 1855. He was a strong advocate of Pacific expansion and in 1852 advocated a survey of the Bering Strait. Gwin presented a bill that was approved by the Senate and the House and became the Act of March 3, 1851, which established a three-member Board of Land Commissioners to be appointed by the President for three-year terms (the period was twice extended by Congress, resulting in a five-year term). The function of the Public Land Commission was to determine the validity of Spanish and Mexican land grants in California.

California Governor John Bigler turned to Gwin&#x27;s rival, David Broderick, when Gwin failed to help Bigler obtain the ambassadorship to Chile. Broderick was appointed Chairman of the California Democratic Party, which split as a result. Gwin had a duel with Representative Joseph McCorkle with rifles at thirty yards following an argument over his alleged mismanagement of federal patronage. Shots were fired by both men, but only a donkey died. The split added turmoil to California&#x27;s political scene, including bribery, physical intimidation, and nonstop political maneuvering. Although weaker than Gwin&#x27;s faction, the Broderick faction was able to block Gwin from being re-elected senator in 1855.

When the Know Nothings exploited the weakness, Broderick accepted Gwin&#x27;s candidacy, and Gwin was re-elected to the United States Senate and served from January 13, 1857, to March 3, 1861. He took Joseph Heco with him to Washington, D.C., to meet President James Buchanan. In 1858, Gwin challenged Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson to a duel, but they resolved their differences through a senatorial arbitration committee.
During the 32nd and 33rd Congresses he was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. During his second term he was also a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance. While in the Senate, he secured the establishment of a mint in California, a survey of the Pacific coast, a navy yard, and station and carried through the senate a bill providing for a line of steamers between San Francisco, China, and Japan by way of the Sandwich Islands. By 1860, he was advocating the purchase of Alaska from the Russian Tsar.

Although the new Republican Party won several important urban contests in California, Gwin&#x27;s wing of the Democratic Party did very well in the California elections of 1859. After the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, Gwin helped to organize abortive secret discussions between Lincoln&#x27;s new Secretary of State, William H. Seward, and some southern leaders to find a compromise that would avoid dissolution of the Union. Before hostilities broke out between the states, Gwin toured the South but returned to California. Here Gwin&#x27;s &quot;Chivalry&quot; faction spoke on the South&#x27;s behalf. Gwin even considered that it might be possible for a Republic of the Pacific, centered on California, to secede from the Union, but when his party suffered badly in the elections of 1861, he saw that there was little more that he could do in California to promote that cause.

==Later life==
Gwin returned east to New York on the same ship as Edwin Vose Sumner, commander of the Union Army&#x27;s Department of the Pacific. Sumner organized Gwin&#x27;s arrest along with two other secessionists, John Slidell (soon after involved in the Trent Affair) and J.L. Brent. However, President Abraham Lincoln intervened for their release, wishing to avoid an international incident, as Gwin had friends in Panama. Gwin sent his wife and one of his daughters to Europe, while he returned to his plantation in Mississippi. The plantation was destroyed in the war and Gwin, a daughter, and son fled to Paris.

In 1864, he attempted to interest Napoleon III in a project to settle American slave owners in Sonora, Mexico. Despite a positive response from Napoleon, the idea was rejected by his protégé, Maximilian I, who feared that Gwin and his southerners would take Sonora for themselves. After the war, he returned to the United States and gave himself up to Major General Philip Sheridan in New Orleans. Sheridan granted his original request for release to rejoin his family, which had also returned, but was countermanded by President Andrew Johnson.

Gwin retired to California and engaged in agricultural pursuits until his death in New York City in 1885. He was interred at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California.
