<text>Charles Edward Potter (October 30, 1916November 23, 1979) was a U.S. Representative and a U.S. Senator from the state of Michigan.

==Early life==
Potter was born in Lapeer, Michigan and attended the public schools there. He received an AB degree from Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan, in 1938. He worked as an administrator of Bureau of Social Aid in Cheboygan County, Michigan, 1938–1942. In 1942, he enlisted as a private in the United States Army with combat service in the European Theater of Operations with the US 28th Infantry Division. He was seriously wounded at Colmar, Alsace, France, in 1945, resulting in the loss of both legs. He was discharged from the service as a major in 1946.

He was awarded the Silver Star twice, the French Croix de Guerre, and the U.S. Purple Heart. After the war, he was engaged as a vocational rehabilitation representative for the Retraining and Reemployment Administration with the United States Labor Department until his resignation in 1947.

==Congress==

Potter was elected on August 26, 1947, as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives from Michigan&#x27;s 11th congressional district for the 80th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Fred Bradley. He was reelected to the two succeeding Congresses and served from August 26, 1947, until his resignation November 4, 1952.

He was elected to the United States Senate in 1952 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Arthur H. Vandenberg, replacing Blair Moody, who had been appointed to the post. He served the remainder of Vandenberg&#x27;s term, from November 5, 1952, to January 3, 1953. He was also elected in 1952 for the term commencing January 3, 1953, defeating Moody in both elections. He served until January 3, 1959, having been defeated for reelection to a second term in 1958 by Philip Hart.

Potter voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957.

During his tenure, he served as the only member of the Subcommittee on Korean War Atrocities, investigating war crimes committed during the Korean War.

==Later career==
After leaving Congress, Potter engaged as an industrial consultant and international securities executive. In his 1965 memoir, &quot;Days of Shame&quot;, he outlined the battle between moderate Republicans and Democrats to contend with Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy. Potter was a close confidante of President Dwight D. Eisenhower on this and other issues.

Potter was a Methodist and a member of American Legion, Amvets, Disabled American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Eagles, Elks, Kiwanis, and the American Battle Monuments Commission. He resided in Queenstown, Maryland, until his death at Walter Reed Army Hospital, Washington, D.C. at the age of sixty-three.

Charles E. Potter is interred in Section 30 of Arlington National Cemetery, Fort Myer, Virginia.

<doc id="881741" wikidata="Q2041688" url="?curid=881741" title="Mohamedou Ould Slahi">
<text>Mohamedou Ould Slahi (; born December 21, 1970) is a Mauritanian engineer who was detained at Guantánamo Bay detention camp without charge from 2002 until his release on October 17, 2016.

Slahi traveled to Afghanistan in December 1990 &quot;to support the mujahideen.&quot; Slahi trained in an al Qaeda camp and swore allegiance to the organization in March 1991. He returned to Germany soon after, but traveled back to Afghanistan for two months in early 1992. Slahi said that, after leaving Afghanistan the second time, he &quot;severed all ties with ... al-Qaeda.&quot; The U.S. government maintains that Slahi &quot;recruited for al-Qaeda and provided it with other support&quot; since then. He lived in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, from November 1999 to January 2000. Slahi was suspected of involvement in the attempted LAX bombing and was investigated by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. Due to the scrutiny, Slahi returned to live in Mauritania where he was questioned and cleared of involvement.

After the September 11 attacks, the U.S. again was interested in Slahi. He was brought in for questioning by Mauritanian authorities on November 20, 2001, after which he was detained for seven days and questioned by Mauritanian officers and by agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The CIA then transported Slahi to a Jordanian prison through its extraordinary rendition program; he was held for eight months. Slahi said he was tortured by the Jordanians. After being flown to Afghanistan and held for two weeks, he was transferred to military custody and the Guantánamo Bay detention camp in Cuba on August 4, 2002, under the authority of the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). Slahi was subjected to sleep deprivation, isolation, temperature extremes, beatings and sexual humiliation at Guantánamo. In one documented incident, he was blindfolded and taken out to sea in a boat for a mock execution. Lt. Col Stuart Couch refused to prosecute Slahi in a Military Commission in 2003. He said that &quot;Salahi&#x27;s incriminating statements—the core of the government&#x27;s case—had been taken through torture, rendering them inadmissible under U.S. and international law.&quot;

In 2005, the internationally recognized criminal defense lawyer Nancy Hollander got involved in Slahi&#x27;s case, together with lawyer Theresa Duncan. They argued Slahi&#x27;s rights to a fair trial, despite criticism for defending a terrorist suspect. In 2010, Judge James Robertson granted a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, ordering Slahi to be released on March 22. In his unclassified opinion, Judge Robertson wrote: &quot;... associations alone are not enough, of course, to make detention lawful.&quot; The Department of Justice appealed the decision. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the ruling and remanded the case to the District Court on November 5, 2010, for further factual findings. The District Court never held the second habeas hearing.

On July 14, 2016, Slahi was approved by a Periodic Review Board for release from detention. Slahi was freed and returned to Mauritania on October 17, 2016; he had been imprisoned at Guantánamo for over fourteen years.

Slahi wrote a memoir in 2005 while imprisoned, which the U.S. government declassified in 2012 with numerous redactions. The memoir was published as &quot;Guantánamo Diary&quot; in January 2015 and became an international bestseller. Slahi is the first Guantánamo detainee to publish a memoir while imprisoned. Slahi wrote four other books while in detention, but he has not been allowed to access these books since being removed from Guantanamo.

==1988–1999==
Slahi was an exceptional student in high school in Mauritania. In 1988, he received a scholarship from the Carl Duisberg Society to study in West Germany, where he earned an electrical engineering degree from the University of Duisburg. In 1991, Slahi travelled to Afghanistan to join the Mujahideen fighting against the communist central government. The United States had supported the Mujahideen against the Soviet occupation starting in 1979, and funnelled billions of dollars of weapons and aid to the &quot;freedom fighters&quot;. After the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, there was a civil war between Mohammad Najibullah&#x27;s government and the Mujahideen. Slahi trained for several weeks at the al Farouq training camp near Khost, which was run by al Qaeda, one of many Mujahideen groups in the civil war. At the end of his training in March 1991, he swore &quot;bayat&quot; to al Qaeda and was given the &quot;kunya&quot; (nom de guerre) of &quot;Abu Musab.&quot; However, he did not participate in the civil war, instead returning to Germany.

In February 1992, Slahi travelled again to Afghanistan and was assigned to a mortar battery in Gardez. Six weeks later, the Najibullah regime fell and he returned to Germany. In hearings in Guantanamo, Slahi has stated that he travelled to Afghanistan twice, attended the al Farouq training camp, and fought against the Afghan central government in 1992, but that he was never an enemy combatant against the United States. In fact, he was fighting on the same side as the United States, which in 1992 supported the Mujahideen fight against the communist government in Afghanistan.

Slahi&#x27;s cousin and former brother-in-law is Mahfouz Ould al-Walid, also known as Abu Hafs al-Mauritani. Before the September 11 attacks in the United States, Al-Walid was a spiritual adviser to Osama bin Laden, was on the Shura council of al Qaeda, and headed the sharia council. Two months before the attacks, al-Walid, along with several other al Qaeda members, wrote a letter to bin Laden opposing the planned attacks. Al-Walid left al Qaeda after the attacks.

While al-Walid was in Sudan, where al Qaeda was based in the mid-1990s, he twice asked Slahi to help him get money to his family in Mauritania, about $4,000 in December 1997 and another $4,000 in December 1998. In the 2010 &quot;habeas corpus&quot; opinion for Slahi, the judge wrote: &quot;the government relies on nothing but Slahi&#x27;s uncorroborated, coerced statements to conclude that the money transfers were done on behalf of and in support of al-Qa&#x27;ida.&quot; In 1998, Slahi was heard by U.S. intelligence talking to al-Walid on a satellite phone traced to bin Laden.

The 9/11 Commission Report, based on the interrogations of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, stated that in 1999, Slahi advised three members of the Hamburg Cell to travel to Afghanistan to obtain training before waging jihad in Chechnya. The federal District Court in 2010 that reviewed Slahi&#x27;s case found that Slahi &quot;provided lodging for three men for one night at his home in Germany [in November 1999], that one of them was Ramzi bin al-Shibh and that there was discussion of jihad and Afghanistan.&quot; Besides Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Mr. Slahi&#x27;s other two houseguests were future September 11 hijackers. Slahi claims it was merely a matter of hospitality to fellow Muslims.

==1999–2002==
Slahi moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in November 1999 because German immigration authorities would not extend his visa for residence in Germany. Since he was a &quot;hafiz,&quot; he was invited by the imam of a large mosque to lead Ramadan prayers. Ahmed Ressam, who was caught with explosives crossing the Canada–U.S. border in December 1999 as part of the 2000 millennium attack plot, had attended the same mosque. Since Slahi was known to U.S. intelligence through contact with his cousin Mahfouz Ould al-Walid, he was suspected by them of activating Ressam.

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) put Slahi under surveillance for several weeks but did not find any grounds to arrest him. According to a classified report of German intelligence, &quot;there is not only no evidence of any involvement by Ould Slahi in the planning and preparation of the attacks, but also no indication that Ressam and Slahi knew each other.&quot;

Frustrated by Canada&#x27;s refusal to arrest him, the CIA worked with Mauritanian intelligence to lure Slahi back by forcing his mother to call him under the false premise that Canada was going to arrest him and he had to return to Mauritania to be protected. Slahi left Canada on January 21, 2000, where he was arrested in Senegal at the request of United States authorities and questioned about the millennium plot. He was transferred to Mauritania to be interrogated by local authorities and United States FBI agents. After three weeks in custody, during which Slahi was accused of being involved in the millennium plot, he was released.

Slahi worked at various companies in Mauritania as an electrical engineer starting in May 2000. After the September 11 attacks, the U.S. renewed scrutiny of everyone suspected of having ties to al Qaeda. On September 29, he was again detained by the Mauritanian authorities for questioning. He cooperated with the authorities several more times and then for the last time starting on November 20, 2001. Slahi was interrogated by both Mauritanian officials and the FBI for seven days.

Then the CIA transported him to Jordan using extraordinary rendition. The CIA supervised his interrogation at a Jordanian prison for eight months. Slahi claims he was tortured and forced to confess to involvement with the millennium plot. On July 19, 2002, the CIA transported Slahi to Bagram, Afghanistan, where he was transferred to military custody and held at the detention facility. The US military flew Slahi to Guantanamo Bay detention camp on August 4, 2002.

==Guantánamo Bay detention, 2002-2016==

Slahi was assigned detainee ID number 760 and was initially held in Camp Delta. Officials belonging to the CSIS interviewed Slahi in February 2003. He was among 14 men classified as high-value detainees, for whom United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld authorized use of what were called enhanced interrogation methods, which have since been classified as torture. By January 2003, US military interrogators pressed to make Slahi their second &quot;Special Project,&quot; drawing up an interrogation plan like that used against Mohammed al-Qahtani. Declassified documents show that Slahi was transferred to an isolation cell near the end of May and abusive interrogation started. He was subjected to extreme cold and noise, extended sleeplessness, forced standing or other postures for extended periods of time, threats against his family, sexual humiliation and other abuses.

In February 2015, a series in &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that one of his interrogators was Richard Zuley, a career homicide detective with the Chicago Police Department, who was called in on assignment with the United States Navy Reserve. In Chicago, Zuley has been the subject of civil suits by inmates attributing similar abuse, including shackling, threats and coerced confessions.

In September 2003, Slahi was moved to Camp Echo. Memos summarizing meetings held on October 9, 2003, and February 2, 2004, between General Geoffrey Miller and Vincent Cassard of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) acknowledged that camp authorities were not permitting the ICRC to have access to Slahi, due to &quot;military necessity.&quot;

Lt. Col V. Stuart Couch, a Marine Corps lawyer, was appointed as Slahi&#x27;s prosecutor at Guantanamo. He withdrew from the case in May 2004 after reviewing it in depth. Couch said that he believed that Slahi &quot;had blood on his hands,&quot; but he &quot;could no longer continue the case in good conscience&quot; because of the alleged torture, which tainted all confessions Slahi had made. Couch said that &quot;the evidence is not believable because of the methods used to obtain it and the fact that it has not been independently corroborated.&quot;

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published a letter that Slahi wrote to his lawyers on November 9, 2006. In the letter, Slahi said all his confessions of crimes were the result of torture. He laughed at being asked to recount &quot;everything&quot; that he had said during interrogations, joking that it was &quot;like asking Charlie Sheen how many women he dated.&quot;

In 2005, the internationally recognized criminal defense lawyer Nancy Hollander got involved in Slahi&#x27;s case, together with lawyer Theresa Duncan. They argued Slahi&#x27;s rights to a fair trial, despite criticism for defending a terrorist suspect.

===Guantánamo Diary===

Slahi started writing a memoir of his experiences in 2005, continuing into the next year. The 466-page manuscript was in English, a language Slahi learned at Guantánamo. After litigation and negotiation, the US government declassified the memoir in 2012, making numerous redactions. Excerpts were published by &quot;Slate&quot; magazine as a three-part series beginning April 30, 2013. On May 1, 2013, &quot;Slate&quot; also published a related interview with Col. Morris Davis, the military&#x27;s chief prosecutor at Guantánamo from September 2005 to October 2007. &quot;Guantánamo Diary&quot; was published as a book in January 2015, the first work by a still-imprisoned detainee at Guantánamo. It provides details of Slahi&#x27;s harsh interrogations and torture, including being &quot;force-fed seawater, sexually molested, subjected to a mock execution and repeatedly beaten, kicked and smashed across the face, all spiced with threats that his mother will be brought to Guantánamo and gang-raped.&quot; It has become an international bestseller. Prison officials prevented Slahi from receiving a copy of his published book.

===Joint Review Task Force===
When he assumed office in January 2009, President Barack Obama repeated his commitment to close Guantanamo. He convened a six-agency task force to review the detainees and recommend those who could be released.
In its 2010 report, the Guantánamo Review Task Force recommended Slahi be considered for prosecution in a military commission. The task force recommended that detainees deemed too dangerous to release, but without sufficient evidence for prosecution, receive a Periodic Review Board hearing. In 2013, Slahi was listed as one of 71 detainees eligible for a review.
In March 2016, Slahi was granted a hearing before the Board in June.

===Further interrogation request===
U.S. district court James Robertson had issued an order to the Department of Defense barring them from interrogating Slahi while his habeas corpus case was under consideration. Guantánamo authorities in October 2014 seized all of Slahi&#x27;s privileged legal papers and all his personal belongings, including a computer. They also stripped Slahi of his &quot;comfort items,&quot; including letters from his late mother, in an attempt to force him to agree to interrogations. Slahi wrote in an unclassified letter to his attorneys in April 2015 that officials had offered to return these items if he agreed to interrogations, which had been barred for six years. Prosecutors in the case of Ahmed al-Darbi wanted to interrogate Slahi about him.

===Torture===
Slahi was last interrogated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on May 22, 2003. He claimed an FBI interrogator warned him &quot;this was our last session; he told me that I was not going to enjoy the time to come.&quot; Three months later Defense Secretary Rumsfeld approved the use of &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot;. Slahi was subjected to isolation, temperature extremes, beatings and sexual humiliation by military interrogators. In one incident, he was blindfolded and taken out to sea for a mock execution.

A 2007 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; report paraphrased an incident described in the 2005 Schmidt-Furlow Report, an investigation by the Department of Defense into detainee treatment at Guantanamo following FBI allegations of torture used by DOD interrogators in the early years of Guantanamo:

On July 17, 2003, a masked interrogator told Mr. Slahi he had dreamed of watching detainees dig a grave... The interrogator said he saw &quot;a plain, pine casket with [Mr. Slahi&#x27;s] identification number painted in orange lowered into the ground.&quot;

In the summer of 2003, Slahi was repeatedly subjected to the use of an interrogation technique which the Schmidt-Furlow Report stated had been prohibited by the Secretary of Defense on December 2, 2002.

What was not revealed until 2008 was that in a March 14, 2003, legal opinion memo issued by John Yoo of the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, Yoo advised that federal laws related to torture and other abuses did not apply to interrogations overseas. At that point the Bush administration contended that Guantanamo Bay was outside US jurisdiction. The Defense Department used this memo to authorize the use of &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; at Guantanamo and in Iraq. Also, by 2005, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that by an April 2003 memo from Rumsfeld to General James T. Hill, commander of United States Southern Command, responsible for Guantanamo Bay, Rumsfeld authorized 24 specific permitted interrogation techniques to be used. Jack Goldsmith, head of the Office of Legal Counsel, withdrew the Yoo Torture Memos in June 2004 and advised federal agencies not to rely on them.

Slahi&#x27;s lawyers in 2008 threatened to sue Mauritanian, Jordanian and U.S. officials over his torture.

The United States Senate Committee on Armed Services produced a report titled &quot;Inquiry into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody&quot; on November 20, 2008. It contains information about the treatment of Slahi and others at Guantanamo before 2005.

According to Peter Finn of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2010, Slahi, along with Tariq al-Sawah, were &quot;two of the most significant informants ever to be held at Guantanamo. Today, they are housed in a little fenced-in compound at the military prison, where they live a life of relative privilege – gardening, writing and painting – separated from other detainees in a cocoon designed to reward and protect.&quot;

===Habeas corpus proceedings===
In &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot; (2004), the United States Supreme Court ruled that detainees at Guantánamo Bay detention camp had the right of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; to challenge their detention. Slahi had &quot;habeas&quot; petitions submitted on his behalf. In response, the Department of Defense published 27 pages of unclassified documents from his Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) on July 14, 2005.

The Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) mandated that Guantánamo detainees were no longer entitled access to the U.S. federal courts, so all pending &quot;habeas&quot; petitions were stayed. However, in June 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Boumediene v. Bush&quot; that the MCA of 2006 could not remove detainees&#x27; right to &quot;habeas&quot; and access to the federal court system. All previous &quot;habeas&quot; petitions were eligible to be re-instated.

Before submitting briefs in the &quot;habeas&quot; case, the U.S. government dropped its previous allegations that Slahi had participated in the Millennium Plot and that he knew about the 9/11 attacks before they happened.

===Release order===
After review of the case, U.S. District Court Judge James Robertson granted the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and ordered Slahi&#x27;s release on March 22, 2010. Robertson&#x27;s ruling was criticized by several Republican Party politicians. Slahi was the 34th detainee whose release was ordered by a federal district court judge reviewing government materials associated with his habeas petition. The unclassified decision was filed on April 9, 2010.

Referring to the government&#x27;s charge that Slahi gave &quot;purposeful and material support&quot; to al Qaeda, Judge Robertson wrote:

Salahi may very well have been an al-Qaida sympathizer, and the evidence does show that he provided some support to al-Qaida, or to people he knew to be al-Qaida. Such support was sporadic, however, and, at the time of his capture, non-existent. In any event, what the standard approved in Al-Bihani actually covers is &quot;those who purposefully and materially supported such forces in hostilities against U.S. Coalition partners.&quot; 530 F.3d at 872 (emphasis added). The evidence in this record cannot possibly be stretched far enough to fit that test.

Judge Robertson addressed the other government allegation, that Slahi was &quot;part of&quot; al Qaeda at the time of his capture. He said the law was not as clear in this instance:
neither Al-Bihani nor any other case provides a bright-line test for determining who was and who was not &quot;part of&quot; al-Qaida at the time of capture. The decision, in other words, depends on the sufficiency of the evidence. The question of when a detainee must have been a &quot;part of&quot; al-Qaida to be detainable is at the center of this case, because it is clear that Salahi was at one point a sworn al-Qaida member.

Judge Robertson discusses other factors in his decision, including which side had the burden of proof and considering the reliability of coerced or hearsay testimony. In conclusion, Judge Robertson stated:

The government had to adduce evidence – which is different from intelligence – showing that it was more likely than not that Salahi was &quot;part of&quot; al-Qaida. To do so, it had to show that the support Salahi undoubtedly did provide from time to time was provided within al-Qaida&#x27;s command structure. The government has not done so.

===Appeal===
The Department of Justice appealed the decision. Oral arguments were heard on September 17, 2010, by a three-judge panel for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In oral arguments, Judge David S. Tatel questioned whether swearing &quot;bayat&quot; in 1991 is evidence of actions a decade and more later against the United States. He noted, &quot;When he swore bayat, the United States and al-Qaeda had a common goal. Both the United States and al-Qaeda were opposing a communist government of Afghanistan.&quot; The panel discussed sending the case back to the District Court or over-ruling the decision, based on other recent D.C. Circuit rulings on the criteria that justify detention, which were still being developed.

On November 5, 2010, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the decision and remanded the case to the D.C. District Court for further factual findings, based on guidance it had given to the D.C. District Court about review of such habeas corpus cases of detainees. 
The Circuit Court panel said the following questions needed to be answered:
*whether Slahi understood that he was referring recruits to work in al-Qaeda&#x27;s &quot;jihad&quot; against the U.S.,
*what Slahi may have said to bin al-Shibh in a discussion of jihad in Afghanistan,
*whether he had been asked by al-Qaeda to help with communications projects in Afghanistan and elsewhere,
*whether he had taken a role in planning computer &quot;cyberattacks,&quot; and 
*whether he remained &quot;a trusted member&quot; of al-Qaeda up to the time of his capture.

The District Court never held any hearings after the Court of Appeals decision.

Slahi had his first Periodic Review Board review on June 2, 2016. A month later, the board recommended that Slahi be released.

==Life after detention==
On October 17, 2016, Slahi was freed and returned to Mauritania, after being detained without charge for over 14 years.

In 2017, &quot;CBS News&quot; journalist Holly Williams traveled to Mauritania to interview Slahi. 
&quot;CBS News&quot;″ flagship news show, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, broadcast the story on March 12, 2017. &quot;CBS News&quot; described it as Slahi&#x27;s first television interview since his repatriation. In this interview Mohamedou said he &quot;wholeheartedly [forgives] everyone who wronged [him] during [his] detention.&quot; Slahi filed in April 2022 a legal claim against the Canadian government on the grounds that &quot;faulty intelligence provided by Canadian authorities contributed to his detention&quot; in 2002, seeking $35 million in compensation.

In May 2018, Slahi&#x27;s former guard at Guantanamo, Steve Wood, visited him in Mauritania during Ramadan.
It was covered in the 2020 documentary short film &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;.

On January 29, 2021, the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; published an open letter from Slahi, and six other individuals who were formerly held in Guantanamo, to newly inaugurated US President Biden, appealing to him to close the detention camp.

In February 2021, a film adaption of his memoir titled &quot;The Mauritanian&quot; directed by Kevin Macdonald, and starring Jodie Foster, Tahar Rahim, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Shailene Woodley was released.

==Personal life==
As of 2019, Slahi&#x27;s passport had not been returned to him as was promised during his release. He has not been able to leave Mauritania to treat his health condition or see his newborn son in Germany. After his academic graduation in Germany in 1999 Slahi had registered himself as unemployed while also being involved in commercial activities which he failed to declare to the authorities, resulting in a suspended sentence for social fraud and an unlimited entry ban.

<doc id="881743" wikidata="Q862891" url="?curid=881743" title="Billingham">
<text>Billingham is a town and civil parish in County Durham, England. The town is on the north side of the River Tees and is governed as part of the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees unitary authority. It had a population of 35,165 in the 2011 Census.

The settlement has been around since Anglo-Saxon times as a village; a post-Second World War modern town centre was built north of the old village centre on the town&#x27;s grange. It was a township with an urban district from 1923 until 1968, when it was absorbed into the County Borough of Teesside, and later part of the county of Cleveland.

Billingham is home to the Billingham Manufacturing Plant which is a major producer of chemicals for agriculture.

==History==
The town was settled by Angles and has a name either meaning &quot;Billa&#x27;s people&#x27;s home&quot; or &quot;bill-shaped hill people&#x27;s home&quot;. The town was in one of the Northumbrian regiones. This regione is thought to cover much of the land of northern Teesdale and had late Viking rule. It was later broken up with Billingham in the Hartness district then into a small shire called Billinghamshire.

St Cuthbert&#x27;s Parish Church has elements dating back to the late-7th/early-8th-century in its nave and a tower dating c. AD 1000. There is also a 7th-century grave-marker from the church in the British Museum.

===Chemical industry and ICI===
The town&#x27;s chemical industry started in the early 1900s. In 1917, the town was chosen to be the site of a new chemical works supplying ammonia for the war. However, the plant was not completed until 1920, after the war had ended. The Brunner Mond Company took over the site and converted it to manufacture fertilisers. In December 1926, Brunner Mond merged with three other chemical companies to form Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), who took control of the plant. With the World Wars creating a high demand for explosives it led to a massive expansion of Billingham and post-Second World War a new town centre was built. ICI began to produce plastics at Billingham in 1966.

Aldous Huxley visited the newly opened and technologically advanced Brunner and Mond plant at ICI and gave a detailed account of the processes he saw. The introduction to the most recent print of &quot;Brave New World&quot; states that Huxley was inspired to write the novel by this Billingham visit. Henry Thorold in the &quot;Shell Guide to County Durham&quot; states:

From 1971 to 1988, ICI operated a small General Atomics TRIGA Mark I nuclear reactor at its Billingham factory to produce radio-isotopes for use in process instrumentation such as level measurement devices. In addition to its own on-site coal-fired power station, ICI also operated the coal-fired North Tees Power Station, designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, on the banks of the Tees to provide electricity for its plants. The latter was eventually decommissioned and demolished (at a ceremony attended by Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley) in 1987. The site of the power station is now Billingham Reach Industrial Estate, an international wharf owned by Able UK Ltd. ICI no longer operates in Billingham, having sold many of its businesses during the restructuring of the company in the 1990s. Some of the company&#x27;s former manufacturing plants are still in operation, run by other chemical companies. Several chemical plants close to the town were subject to explosions and leaks in 2006 and 2007.

Following the fragmentation and ultimate loss of the chemicals conglomerate ICI, the Billingham Chemical Industrial park became a multi-company facility. The chemical, biotechnology and engineering companies that continue to operate at Billingham are members of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). They include GrowHow, Johnson Matthey, Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies and Fruitarom. Other members of the NEPIC Cluster operate from the 62-acre (25 hectares) Belasis Business Park in Billingham such as Cambridge Research Biochemicals, ABB and Biochemica. Growhow not only manufacture fertilisers &amp; industrial chemicals in Bilingham, but also capture the CO2 for use in the food and drink industry. Tomatoes are grown in Billingham by North Bank Growers using the recoverable energy from the Billingham complex, which further reduces the area&#x27;s carbon footprint.

Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies have a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Billingham. Subject to regulatory approval, at least 60 million doses of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine will be manufactured there for the UK government from 2021.

===Anhydrite mine===
In 1983, NIREX announced a proposal to use the disused anhydrite mine as a site for the disposal of intermediate level nuclear waste. There was a certain amount of opposition to this, led by Billingham Against Nuclear Dumping (BAND), as despite the suitability of the site in geological terms, it was very close to a large population centre.
Subsequently, in 1985, the plans were dropped. In 2007, more recent plans to reopen the mines for &quot;use as a long-term disposal facility for low hazard waste&quot; were met with similar opposition and a petition of 3,200 signatures against the mine&#x27;s opening was presented to the local authority.

In March 2011, Stockton Council&#x27;s planning committee accepted an application from NPL Waste Management to reopen the mine for the disposal of hazardous waste. NPL planned to convert the mine into a 4,000,000 cubic metre waste storage facility receiving over 100,000 tonnes of waste annually.

== Governance ==

===Municipal===

Between 1923 and 1968, Billingham had its own urban district council which built, among other things, the Billingham Forum, Kennedy Gardens and Billingham Golf Club (the UK&#x27;s first municipally-owned club). Billingham&#x27;s last mayor was Octavious Evitts in 1952.

It was subsumed into the County Borough of Teesside in 1968. In 1974, Teesside County Borough was replaced by the County of Cleveland, which had four districts: Hartlepool, Langbaurgh-on-Tees, Middlesbrough and Stockton-on-Tees. Billingham was then part of Stockton-on-Tees. In 1996, with the abolition of Cleveland county, Billingham remained within the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees which became a unitary authority.

===Town parish===

Billingham civil parish is the largest area and size in the Stockton Borough. Other than the town itself, areas of the parish include Haverton Hill, Port Clarence, Cowpen Bewley and Seal Sands.

A petition to Stockton Borough Council and referendum held in 2003 both gave assent to a proposal for Billingham to become reparished. The Department for Communities and Local Government and the Electoral Commission issued orders for the creation of a Billingham parish and the setting up of a new town council in February 2007. It is funded by a precept of £80,000. The first elections for the new Town Council were held on 3 May 2007.

==Geography==

===Protected and green spaces===
Billingham Beck Valley Country Park (also known as Billingham Bottoms) was landscaped from a reclaimed industrial waste tip and has steadily grown to include former grazing land to form a site including wetland habitats. Designated as a Local Nature Reserve by English Nature in 1992, it won a Green Flag Award in 2005. The beck itself is one of the major tributaries of the River Tees and has a tidal reach around the former ICI site.
=== Town ===

The town is effectively split into two separate areas by name: Old Billingham (the area around the village green adjacent to St Cuthbert&#x27;s church and built up around the ICI works) and the more planned estates that have spread out since the 1950s, increasing the town&#x27;s size and borders towards the villages of Wolviston and Cowpen Bewley to the point of almost incorporating them.

Billingham Town Centre provides the town with national retail chains such as Asda, Greggs, Iceland, Argos, Aldi, Costa, Poundland and Boyes, as well as several charity shops, estate agents and banks, with a market featuring in the centre every Monday and Friday. The town centre lacks some services but Stockton town centre is less than away and Middlesbrough town centre is also less than away.

In 1967, Associated Dairies&#x27; fledgling stores division, launched in 1965, opened its first store outside of its Yorkshire heartland in the town centre. Asda Billingham was Asda&#x27;a first store to open in the North East and is now the oldest continuously trading Asda supermarket in the UK.

In March 2012 it was confirmed that a Wetherspoons public house would be opened in the town centre, along with a Fulton Frozen Foods superstore.

In August each year the town centre hosts the Billingham International Folklore Festival. Dancers and musicians perform traditional and contemporary dance.

In November 2013, a time capsule was buried in front of &#x27;The Family&#x27; statue in Billingham town centre under a stone with the inscription &#x27;FOREVER FORWARD 30 11 2013&#x27;. The capsule is not to be unearthed until the year 2078.

==Demography==
The population of Billingham, according to the census of 1801, was 962. This number increased slowly until the beginning of the First World War, when the need for nitrates to use in explosives brought about a significant burst of growth for the town. In 1917, after Billingham was chosen as the site for the production of synthetic ammonia due to its good transport links and access to the resources needed, the population of the town nearly doubled in just a few years from 4500 to 8000. After the war, the site was bought by Brunner Mond and converted for use in the production of agricultural fertiliser. Brunner Mond soon merged with a number of other companies to form Imperial Chemical Industries. This furthered the growth of Billingham&#x27;s population, which reached nearly 18,000 by 1931. With the onset of the Second World War, synthetic ammonia for explosives was once again in demand, further sustaining the town&#x27;s development.

During the latter half of the 20th century, the population of Billingham slowed significantly due to the industrial decline of the area. Furthermore, Billingham attracted relatively few immigrants after its de-industrialisation. Across the wards that make up Billingham, just 2.3% of the population at the 2011 Census were born outside the UK, compared to a national average of 13%. The population was also recorded as 99% white.

Population data for 1801–1971 is available at Britain Through Time.

==Education==
Billingham is served by two secondary schools: Northfield School, a specialist sports college, and St Michael&#x27;s Catholic Academy, a specialist Science Catholic academy. Northfield Marsh House site, formerly Campus, was closed in 2012.

At the moment construction is ongoing for St. Michael&#x27;s to join the Billingham Campus and New Bede/Riverside College facilities on the Marsh House Avenue site. The council has published plans for a £40 million investment in primary schools which will include some being rebuilt or re-designed and refurbished. Roseberry Primary School and Bewley Infant and Bewley Junior Schools are on the list for action within the next few years.

Bede College has served the town for several years, and attracts students from Hartlepool and Stockton, consistently achieving higher results than nearby colleges in Stockton or Middlesbrough. Formerly one of the smallest colleges in the UK, with under 400 students, its recent amalgamation with Stockton Riverside College and relocation to an adjacent new campus has seen its student body increase significantly. As part of the new campus, the college has also gained its own sports facilities.

==Religion==
Billingham is home to several religious communities, the largest of which are the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church.

The Church of England community is served by a single Team Parish, with five parish churches: St. Cuthbert&#x27;s, St. Luke&#x27;s, St. Mary Magdalene, St. Aidan&#x27;s, and St. Peter&#x27;s. The parish covers all of Billingham, the Clarences, Cowpen Bewley, Newton Bewley, and Wolviston. It is part of the Church of England Deanery of Stockton in the Archdeaconry of Auckland, which itself is within the Diocese of Durham.

The Roman Catholic community is served by three parishes, Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Parish Billingham, St. John the Evangelist and St. Joseph&#x27;s. These parishes are based in Hexham and Newcastle&#x27;s St Hilda Partnership. The Parish Priest is the Rev John Butters.There is also St Michaels RC Secondary School in Billingham, which is part of the Carmel Trust based in Darlington.

The Christian community is also served by two Methodist churches, one Baptist church and a Pentecostal Church called &quot;New Life&quot; based on Low Grange Avenue. There is also a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

The Spiritualist community is served by one Spiritualist Church located on Chapel Road, TS23 1DX, just off The Green. This is the second oldest Church in Billingham and started out life as a Methodist church that was then sold on to the Spiritualist National Union when the Methodists needed a larger premises. The chapel has been serving Spiritualism and the local community since 1932.

==Transport==
===Road===
Billingham is served by the A19 running to Sunderland in the north and Thirsk in the south.

Billingham is also served by the A689 to Hartlepool in the east and Bishop Auckland in the west.

===Rail===

Billingham railway station is on the Durham Coast Line with hourly services provided by Northern to Newcastle and the MetroCentre in the north and to Stockton and Middlesbrough in the south. Grand Central provide an express train from Sunderland to London but the service does not currently serve Billingham.

The original Billingham railway station was closed in the late 1960s and moved a mile east along the line. Rail services were infamously operated using Pacer trains which were in essence converted Leyland National buses, but these were withdrawn in late 2019 due to them not meeting government disability requirements.

===Bus===
Stagecoach provides services 35 to Stockton via Norton Glebe &amp; High Grange, 36 Middlesbrough &amp; Hartlepool, 52 Stockton High Street &amp; Low Grange and 34 Middlesbrough &amp; Owington Farm. Many route changes were made with Billingham&#x27;s buses, such as the re-routing around High Grange on the 34. In summer 2018 the 34A was introduced but withdrawn in late 2019.

Go North East provide services X9 &amp; X10 To Newcastle &amp; Middlesbrough.

Local operator Stagecarriage provided local services, such as the X7 to Stockton, Teesside Retail Park and Middlesbrough. This service was withdrawn around a fortnight before the company&#x27;s collapse in July 2019. The service has not been replaced.

Leven Valley formally provided service 45 to Wolviston. After the closure of Leven Valley, Stagecarrige took over this service, but it stopped running shortly after.

==Sport==
Billingham is the home of Billingham Town F.C., who celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2017 having been initially founded in 1967 as Billingham Social Club.

The chemical industry&#x27;s creation of ammonia in the town also led to the formation of Billingham&#x27;s other football team, Billingham Synthonia, Synthonia being a portmanteau of &quot;synthetic ammonia&quot;. At the beginning of the 2017–18 season, financial difficulties spurred Billingham Synthonia F.C. to relocate to the Norton Sports Complex in Norton in a ground-share with Norton &amp; Stockton Ancients and are currently ground sharing with Stokesley SC.

Billingham Synthonia Cricket Club is of similar origins to the football club of the same name. The club play in the North Yorkshire and South Durham Cricket League.

The town also has its own ice hockey team (the Billingham Stars) in the English National Ice Hockey League, whose home rink is Billingham Forum Ice Arena. There is also another ice hockey team called the Billingham wildcats which is made up of women aged 16+.

The town has one Rugby Union club, Billingham RUFC, which has four senior teams, the 1st XV currently playing in National 3 North, four leagues from the Premiership. The 2nd XV (Lions) currently playing in The &quot;Candy League&quot; Division 1. The 3rd XV currently playing in The &quot;Teesside Merit League&quot;, with the Colts playing in a competitive Saturday Colts League. The club also has a junior section, ranging from U-7 minis to U-16s, with teams winning Durham county cups and leagues.

=== Billingham Forum ===
In 1967, Billingham Forum was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. A sports and leisure complex, it contains a swimming pool, an ice rink, and a number of sports halls. The complex also houses the Forum Theatre. Notable personalities that have performed in the theatre include Wendy Richard, Jimmy Edwards, Eric Sykes, Darren Day, Arthur Lowe, David Jason, Penelope Keith, Terry Scott, Timothy West, Carroll Baker, and Dame Anna Neagle. Roy Chubby Brown performed there for the first time in November 2006; his DVD for 2007 was recorded there as well.

As part of the proposals to regenerate Billingham, a &#x27;Gateway&#x27; initiative proposed the construction of a new sports and leisure centre on John Whitehead Park to replace the Forum. This proved highly controversial, particularly as the Forum&#x27;s would-be-replacement did not contain a theatre. The proposals were abandoned in November 2004, shortly after the Forum Theatre was granted Grade II listed building status.

Following a survey that reported 98% of participants in favour, Stockton Borough Council submitted a bid of £15-20 million to refurbish the Forum Complex in partnership with The Billingham Partnership group.

On 2 June 2011, the Billingham Forum returned from its £15m refurbishment, which started in mid-2009. The Billingham Forum now encompasses a theatre, business standard conferencing facilities, a swimming facility, a large Ice Arena, a state-of-the-art Activ8 Gym with TechnoGym Digital exercising equipment, a sauna and steam room, fun indoor climbing (GoClimb), a sports injury centre, and dry sports and drama facilities. There was originally a fish pond in the centre of Billingham Forum but it has been removed. The exterior wall panels have also been replenished with a colour scheme of Dark Blue, Grey and Yellow. Billingham Forum is owned by Stockton Borough Council and is managed by Tees Active Ltd.

<text>Jerome Abram Bettis Sr. (born February 16, 1972) is an American former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons, primarily with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Nicknamed &quot;the Bus&quot; due to his large size and forceful running style, he played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and was selected 10th overall by the Los Angeles Rams in the 1993 NFL draft. Bettis was a member of the Rams for three seasons before being traded to the Steelers, where he spent the remainder of his career. A six-time Pro Bowl and two-time first-team All-Pro selection, he is regarded as one of the greatest power runners of all time and ranks eighth in NFL rushing yards. He retired in 2006 after helping the Steelers win a Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XL, the franchise&#x27;s first in over two decades. Bettis was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015.

==Early life==
Bettis was born February 16, 1972, in Detroit, Michigan. He is the oldest of three children of Gladys Elizabeth (née Bougard) and Johnnie E. Bettis. Bettis did not start playing football until high school, as his primary passion as a youth had been bowling. At age 14, he was diagnosed with asthma. As a youth in Detroit, Bettis and his brother made ends meet by selling crack cocaine. He attended Mackenzie High School in Detroit, where he was a standout running back and linebacker. As a senior, he was rated the top player in the state by the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, and was the Gatorade Circle of Champions Player of the Year award winner.

==College career==
Bettis enrolled at the University of Notre Dame to play college football for the Fighting Irish. Bettis finished his career with 337 rushing attempts for 1,912 yards (5.7 yards per attempt), and made 32 receptions for 429 yards (13.4 yards per reception). In his sophomore year, he set the Notre Dame touchdown record with 20 in one season, with 16 rushing, and 4 receiving (23 total touchdowns including the 1992 Sugar Bowl, a record which still stands). In his last game as a junior, a 28–3 win by Notre Dame over Texas A&amp;M in the 1993 Cotton Bowl, he rushed 20 times for 75 yards, ran for two touchdowns and caught a 26-yard touchdown pass.

Following this Bettis decided to forgo his senior year and enter the 1993 NFL draft. He returned to Notre Dame in 1996 when he was having a dispute with the St. Louis Rams and was considering retirement. He registered for courses in &quot;history, philosophy, marketing and business&quot; totaling an 18 credit class load. He returned to the NFL shortly thereafter.

Bettis later returned to Notre Dame to complete his college degree, and on May 15, 2022, he graduated with a business degree.
==Professional career==
===Los Angeles / St. Louis Rams===
The Los Angeles Rams selected Bettis in the first round, with the tenth overall selection, of the 1993 NFL draft. On July 22, 1993, He signed a three-year, $4.625 million contract with a signing bonus in excess of $2 million. As a rookie, he flourished under Chuck Knox&#x27;s ground-oriented offense. He quickly earned the nickname &quot;The Battering Ram&quot; as he rushed for 1,429 yards (second in the NFL, behind only Emmitt Smith&#x27;s 1,486 rushing yards), drawing comparisons to Earl Campbell. Bettis also had an NFL-best 79 rushing first downs and an NFL-best 38 runs of 10 or more yards, and tied for the league lead with seven 100-yard rushing games despite not becoming the full-time starter until the sixth game of the season. Bettis was named a First-team All-Pro (the only rookie named to the team) and Consensus NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. He rushed for over 1,000 yards and was selected for the NFC&#x27;s Pro Bowl team in each of his first two seasons with the Rams.

The Rams moved to St. Louis for the 1995 season. New coach Rich Brooks instituted a more pass-oriented offense, a major reason why Bettis was limited to 637 yards, a significant dropoff from his 1993 and 1994 totals. Brooks asked Bettis whether he wanted to move to fullback for the upcoming 1996 season or preferred to be traded. He opted to be dealt.

====Trade to Pittsburgh====
The Rams gave Bettis the option of which team he wanted to be traded to, and he chose the Steelers over their AFC Central rival Houston Oilers (who would draft Eddie George that year instead) due to the Steelers&#x27; more storied history.

The Steelers were in need of a running back because Bam Morris, their power running back for the 1994 and 1995 seasons, was arrested in March 1996 for marijuana possession.

In what would become one of the more lopsided trades in NFL history, on draft day (April 20, 1996) Bettis was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers with a third-round pick in the 1996 NFL draft in exchange for the Steelers&#x27; second-round pick and their fourth-round pick in the 1997 NFL draft. The Steelers drafted Steve Conley with the Rams’ third round selection. With their second round pick in the 1996 draft the Rams took Ernie Conwell. In 1997 the Rams traded their fourth-round pick from the Steelers and two sixth-round picks to the Dolphins in order to move up nine slots and take offensive tackle Ryan Tucker.

Morris eventually pleaded guilty to marijuana possession and was cut by the team in June 1996, leaving Bettis as the featured back. Conley was traded to the Colts two seasons later for a fifth-round pick.

===Pittsburgh Steelers===
In his first season in Pittsburgh, Bettis rushed for a then career-high 1,431 yards and 11 touchdowns and was named to his second 1st team All-Pro team. He also won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year, NFL Alumni Running Back of the Year, was voted Steelers&#x27; team MVP and finished the 1996 season as the leader in Football Outsiders rushing DYAR metric.

Bettis rushed for over 1,000 yards in each of his first six seasons with the Steelers between 1996 and 2001. Included in that run were three campaigns of over 1,300 yards. In 1997, Bettis rushed for a career-best 1,665 yards in the team&#x27;s first 15 games. However, because the team had already wrapped up its playoff position, he was rested for the regular-season finale and finished 26 yards short of the team&#x27;s single-season record. Bettis does hold the Steelers&#x27; franchise record for rushing yards in a single season when including postseason play. Bettis was a second-team All-Pro choice in 1997 and set a then NFL record with two overtime touchdowns in the same season.

Bettis was leading the league with 1,072 rushing yards in 2001 when he suffered a serious hip and groin injury that sidelined him for the remainder of the regular season. Injuries would also cost him significant parts of the 2002 season, leaving him as a backup to Amos Zereoué to begin the 2003 season. Despite regaining his starting role midway through the 2003 season, Bettis again found himself a backup to start the 2004 season, this time to free-agent acquisition Duce Staley. But when an injury took Staley out of action midway through the year, Bettis stepped in and gained 100-plus yards in six of the next eight games, and in seven consecutive starts. The late-season effort led to the sixth Pro-Bowl berth of his career.

Bettis spent the 2005 season as a short-yardage running back, but managed two notable games along the way: a 101-yard, two-touchdown effort in a pivotal week 14 win over Chicago (his second-to-last game in Pittsburgh) in which he ran over Bears&#x27; safety Mike Green and the NFL&#x27;s Defensive Player of the Year linebacker Brian Urlacher on the goal line during a heavy snow squall. Then he scored three touchdowns in a win over Detroit to clinch a playoff berth on the last day of the season. He finished the season and his career as the NFL&#x27;s 5th leading all-time rusher.

Bettis was also at the center of one of the most controversial calls in NFL history. During a Thanksgiving Day game with the Detroit Lions on November 26, 1998, he was sent out as the Steelers representative for the overtime coin toss. Bettis appeared to call &quot;tails&quot; while the coin was in the air but referee Phil Luckett declared that Bettis had called &quot;heads&quot; first and awarded possession to Detroit, which would go on to win the game before Pittsburgh had the chance to have possession.&quot; After reviewing the incident, the NFL changed the rule and declared that the call of &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot; would be made before the coin was tossed rather than during the toss and that at least two officials would be present. In 2001 the readers of ESPN voted the incident as No. 8 on its list of the ten worst sports officiating calls of all time, even though sound enhancements of the audio showed that Bettis said &quot;hea-tails&quot; and Bettis admitted starting to call &quot;heads&quot; before changing it to tails. Bettis later put together one of the most bizarre single-game statistics in NFL history. In the 2004 season opener he scored three touchdowns while carrying the ball five times for a total of only one yard and a 0.2 yards per carry average.

During that 2004 season, Bettis and New York Jets running back Curtis Martin dueled for position on the all-time rushing yards leaderboard. Bettis entered the season in 6th place all-time and 684 yards ahead of Martin in 9th place. Because Bettis was the backup in Pittsburgh for the start of the season, Martin was able to pass Bettis in week 13 until the Steelers played their game later in the day and Bettis retook the lead by 6 yards. When the Jets traveled to Martin&#x27;s home town of Pittsburgh to play the Steelers the following week, both backs would cross the 13,000-yard mark, making this the first time two players crossed the 13,000 yard mark (or other similarly high yardage milestones) in the same game. Their combined career totals were also one of the biggest combined career totals for opposing running backs in history. At the end of the game, Martin would lead Bettis by 9 yards. Two weeks later in week 16, Bettis would again pass Martin and establish himself with a lead of 81 yards. In doing so, Bettis passed Eric Dickerson for 4th place on the all-time list. Bettis sat out the final week of the season, and when Martin rushed for 153 yards that week he passed Dickerson, and Bettis for the final time.

After the Steelers&#x27; defeat in the 2004 AFC Championship Game on January 23, 2005, Bettis announced that he was considering retirement, but would not make a final decision for several months to prevent the sting of the defeat from clouding his judgment. Later, Bettis agreed to stay with the Steelers for another season. He stated he would love to play in the Super Bowl in 2006 since it was to be played in his hometown of Detroit. His wish came true as the Steelers played in, and won, Super Bowl XL (40) against the Seattle Seahawks, 21–10, on February 5, 2006.

Bettis finished his 13 NFL seasons as the NFL&#x27;s 5th all-time leading rusher with 13,662 yards and 91 touchdowns. He also caught 200 passes for 1,449 yards and 3 touchdowns and threw 3 career touchdown passes. He was named to the Pro Bowl in 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001, and 2004. Bettis won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year award in 1996, and in 2002 he was the recipient of the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award. While Bettis finished with 1,542 more yards than Franco Harris on the NFL&#x27;s all-time rushing list, Harris remains the Steelers all-time leading rusher because 3,091 of Bettis’ yards came while he was with the Rams.

Bettis received the nickname &quot;the Bus&quot; during his time at Notre Dame, as a reporter at the university&#x27;s newspaper (The Observer) came up with it, stating that he looked like a bus taking guys for a ride. This led to a student chant about how &quot;Nobody stops the bus&quot; that stuck for the rest of his tenure at the school.

Bettis was given the nickname &quot;the Closer” by his Steeler head coach Bill Cowher because whenever Pittsburgh was ahead at the end of the game, Cowher would send in Bettis to run out the clock.

====Final season====
Shortly after the Steelers lost the 2004–2005 AFC Championship game to the eventual Super Bowl XXXIX champion New England Patriots, Ben Roethlisberger approached Bettis. He promised Bettis that if he came back for one last season, he would get him to the Super Bowl. Apparently, it was this promise that got Jerome Bettis to play one last season. In 12 NFL seasons, Bettis had reached the playoffs five times, but had never been in the Super Bowl.

In week 17 of the 2005 NFL season, Bettis rushed for 41 yards and three touchdowns against the Detroit Lions. The Steelers won, 35–21, and thanks to Bettis&#x27;s three touchdowns, they clinched a playoff berth. When Bill Cowher pulled Bettis from the game late in the fourth quarter, he was given a standing ovation from the Steeler fans. This game would be the last home game (not including the neutral-site Super Bowl) for Jerome Bettis.

Bettis contributed 52 yards and a touchdown in the Steelers&#x27; wildcard playoff victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on January 8. After their wildcard win, Ben Roethlisberger revealed to the team that he promised to Bettis that he would get him to the Super Bowl, in order to get him to come back for the 2005 season.

On January 15, 2006, Bettis was the center of one of football&#x27;s most memorable endings in a divisional playoff game against the Indianapolis Colts. The Steelers offensive attack was mostly pass-driven during the game. Bettis ran for 46 yards on 17 rushes, including one touchdown. When the Steelers took possession of the ball on the Indianapolis 2-yard line with 1:20 remaining in the game, leading 21–18, the outcome seemed almost certain. The first play from scrimmage went to the surehanded Bettis, who had not fumbled once the entire year. As Bettis ran towards the end zone, Colts linebacker Gary Brackett popped the ball out of Jerome&#x27;s hands, where, in seemingly another occurrence of the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; &quot;cover jinx,&quot; it was picked up by cornerback Nick Harper, who was stopped from returning the fumble all the way for a touchdown by Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. Ultimately, however, Bettis&#x27;s mistake did not result in a Steelers loss, as Colts kicker Mike Vanderjagt missed a 46-yard game-tying field goal, ending the game with a 21-18 Steelers victory.

The next week, the Steelers were set to face off against the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship game. Bettis delivered a rousing speech to his teammates the day before the game, asking them to &quot;Just get me to Detroit&quot;, his hometown, where Super Bowl XL was to be played. Bettis&#x27;s wish was granted, as he and the Steelers advanced to Super Bowl XL with a 34–17 win over the Broncos, led by Ben Roethlisberger&#x27;s arm. Bettis ran for 39 yards on 15 carries, including a touchdown. After the game was over, Bettis found his parents in the crowd and mouthed the words &quot;We&#x27;re going home&quot; to them.

==Retirement from football==

Asked about the possibility of retirement, Bettis announced, &quot;I played this game for a championship. I&#x27;m a champion, and I think the Bus&#x27; last stop is here in Detroit.&quot; Thus, Jerome Bettis officially announced his retirement standing on the champions&#x27; podium, holding the Vince Lombardi Trophy alongside Dan Rooney, who accepted the trophy on behalf of both himself and Bill Cowher, the winning head coach. Hines Ward, the MVP of the game, said during the Super Bowl commercial, &quot;I&#x27;m going to Disney World and I&#x27;m taking The Bus!&quot;

Although the Steelers have not officially retired Bettis&#x27; #36, they have not reissued it since his retirement and it is understood that no Steeler will ever wear it again. His number joins a list of other unofficially retired numbers such as those of Terry Bradshaw and Hines Ward.

On January 31, 2006, Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and the City Council presented the key to the city to Bettis and declared the week &quot;Jerome Bettis Week&quot; for being &quot;a shining example of what a kid with a dream from Detroit can accomplish with hard work and determination.&quot; Currently, he lives in Atlanta, Georgia.

Governor Jennifer M. Granholm of the State of Michigan declared February 1, 2006, to be Jerome Bettis Day.

On May 21, 2006, Bettis received an honorary Doctoral degree from Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, Michigan.

Before the Steelers&#x27; home opener of the 2006 NFL season, a large school bus drove onto the field, and Bettis stepped out to a massive crowd ovation. He was one of several Steelers players being honored as part of the celebration of the franchise&#x27;s five Super Bowl victories; Lynn Swann and Franco Harris were also present.

==Post-football career==

In February 2006, at the 2006 Winter Olympics, NBC Sports announced that Bettis had been signed as a studio commentator for NBC&#x27;s new &quot;Football Night in America&quot; Sunday night pregame show where he was through the 2008 season.
In April 2006, Bettis and his parents teamed up with Don Barden, the head of PITG Gaming LLC, in a bid for a casino on Pittsburgh&#x27;s Northside to be called the Majestic Star. Their plan would aid the NHL&#x27;s Pittsburgh Penguins with funding for a new ice arena. Barden said that he would give $7.5 million a year for 30 years to help build a new arena.

Bettis opened a restaurant called &quot;Jerome Bettis&#x27; Grille 36&quot; on June 5, 2007, on Pittsburgh&#x27;s Northside.

Bettis makes a cameo as himself in the episode &quot;The Convention&quot; of season 3 of the NBC comedy series &quot;The Office&quot;. Signing autographs at a paper convention, Michael Scott tries to invite him to a room party, which Bettis declines. Later, Michael claims Bettis is nicknamed &quot;The Bus&quot; because he is afraid of flying.

In 2010, Bettis joined School of the Legends (SOTL), an online community and partner of the NFLPA. He was featured in an article on the D1 Training website in February 2011 and filmed training courses for SOTL that focused on his position as a running back.

Bettis is currently the host of &quot;The Jerome Bettis Show&quot; on WPXI-TV, filmed at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, airing Saturdays at 7:00 PM and 1:00 AM. He was a commentator for the NFL Network and a former NBC studio analyst for &quot;Football Night in America&quot;. Now he is an NFL analyst for different ESPN programs, such as &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.

The Jerome Bettis Bus Stops Here Foundation and other agencies sponsor the Jerome Bettis Asthma and Sports Camp annually for children with asthma. Bettis has also delivered over 1000 pairs of cleats to children in the Detroit school system.

After falling short as a finalist in 2013, on January 31, 2015, Bettis was voted into The Pro Football Hall of Fame. Bettis returned to NBC to help Bob Costas preside over the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation at the end of Super Bowl XLIX on February 1, 2015.

Bettis starred in a Geico commercial in 2019, playing a running back in flag football that dominates the competition (49–0).

Bettis portrays himself in the episode &quot;Welcome to the Ex-Files&quot; in Season 4 of the CBS comedy series &quot;The Neighborhood&quot;, where he visits the home of principal characters Calvin and Tina Butler for dinner after running into them at a restaurant. In the course of the evening, characters learn that Bettis &amp; Tina had a &quot;summer fling&quot; when they were teenagers, triggering jealousy in Calvin that gets resolved by the end of the episode.

Bettis returned on campus at the University of Notre Dame in 2021–2022 to finish his bachelor&#x27;s degree, something he had started nearly 30 years earlier. He graduated in May 2022 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business.

==Personal life==
Bettis has made political donations to both Democratic and Republican candidates, such as the Congressional campaign of Democratic Representative Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick and George W. Bush&#x27;s 2004 reelection campaign. On March 29, 2008, Bettis accompanied Barack Obama on a campaign visit to the U.S. Steel plant in Braddock, Pennsylvania. Bettis endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

<doc id="881753" wikidata="Q423380" url="?curid=881753" title="Oxymorphone">
<text>Oxymorphone (sold under the brand names Numorphan and Opana among others) is a highly potent opioid analgesic indicated for treatment of severe pain. Pain relief after injection begins after about 5–10 minutes, after oral administration it begins after about 30 minutes, and lasts about 3–4 hours for immediate-release tablets and 12 hours for extended-release tablets. The elimination half-life of oxymorphone is much faster intravenously, and as such, the drug is most commonly used orally. Like oxycodone, which metabolizes to oxymorphone, oxymorphone has a high potential to be abused. 
It was developed in Germany in 1914. It was patented in 1955 and approved for medical use in 1959. In June 2017 the FDA asked Endo Pharmaceuticals to remove its product from the US market. This was in part due to the opioid epidemic in the US, and the fact that a 2012 reformulation failed to stop illicit injection of the drug. Endo responded by voluntarily removing Opana ER from the market a month later. Generic versions of extended-release oxymorphone, such as those manufactured by Amneal Pharmaceuticals, are still available in the US.

==Medical uses==
Oxymorphone Immediate Release is indicated for the relief of moderate to severe pain, such as treatment of acute post surgical pain. For any chronic treatment of pain, clinicians should only consider long term use if there is significant clinical benefit to the patient&#x27;s therapy that outweigh any potential risk. The first line treatment choices for chronic pain are non-pharmacological and non-opioid agents.

Oxymorphone extended-release tablets are indicated for the management of chronic pain and only for people already on a regular schedule of strong opioids for a prolonged period. Immediate-release oxymorphone tablets are recommended for breakthrough pain for people on the extended-release version. Compared to other opioids, oxymorphone has similar pain relieving efficacy.

In the United States it is a Schedule II controlled substance with an ACSCN of 9652.

Oxymorphone ER Tablets should be taken on an empty stomach.

==Availability==

=== Brands and forms ===
Oxymorphone was marketed by Endo Pharmaceuticals, under the brand name(s) Opana and Opana ER. Opana ER was withdrawn by the manufacturer in 2017 due to a FDA request, making it unavailable in the US. However, both IR (immediate release) and ER (extended release) formulations are still available under the generic name Oxymorphone and Oxymorphone ER, provided by a multitude of different manufacturers.

Oxymorphone is also available as an injectable for inpatient use, available for IV (intravenous), IM (intramuscular), and SC (subcutaneous) injection.

An extended release (ER) modified-release dosage form is commonly used, which modifies the pharmacokinetics of the drug.

=== Oral dosage forms ===
Oxymorphone comes in a variety of doses.
== Special populations ==
Patients already suffering from debilitation are at a much higher risk of respiratory depression. Nonopioid analgesics should be considered in this population.

Elderly patients are much more sensitive to adverse effects, such as falls, cognitive impairment and constipation, and should be monitored for such. Decreased renal function associated with aging leads to decreased clearance of the drug, resulting in narrow therapeutic windows and increasing the danger of overdose. If oxymorphone is absolutely indicated, smaller initial doses should be started for this population.

There is a risk of neonatal withdrawal symptom in the newborn if pregnant women take oxymorphone for a prolonged period. Oxymorphone crosses the placenta and holds risk of birth defects, poor fetal growth, stillbirth, and preterm delivery. The children of mothers who are physically dependent on oxymorphone have a higher risk of similar dependence. Due to these severe risks, oxymorphone is highly discouraged among this population. The amount of transfer of oxymorphone into the breast milk is not known and women are cautioned to weigh the risks and benefits before breastfeeding while on this medication.

==Side effects==
The principal adverse effects of oxymorphone are similar to other opioids with constipation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, dry mouth and drowsiness being the most common adverse effects. This drug is highly addictive as with other opioids and can lead to chemical dependence and withdrawal.

==Overdose==
In common with other opioids, oxymorphone overdosage is characterized by respiratory depression, sleepiness progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle weakness, cold and clammy skin, and sometimes slow heart rate and low blood pressure. In a severe case of overdose, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest and death can occur.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Oxymorphone elicits its effects by binding to and activating the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and, to a much lesser extent, the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) and κ-opioid receptor (KOR). Its activity at the DOR may augment its action at the MOR. Oxymorphone is 10 times more potent than morphine. The calculation of relative potency indicated that 1 mg of oxymorphone hydrochloride equaled 9.85 mg of morphine sulfate, or 1.02 mg of oxymorphone hydrochloride was equivalent to 10 mg of morphine sulfate.

===Pharmacokinetics===
==Chemistry==
Oxymorphone is commercially produced from thebaine, which is a minor constituent of the opium poppy (&quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;) but thebaine is found in greater abundance (3%) in the roots of the oriental poppy (&quot;Papaver orientale&quot;).
German patents from the mid-1930s indicate that oxymorphone as well as hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and acetylmorphone can be prepared—without the need for hydrogen gas—from solutions of codeine, morphine, and dionine by refluxing an acidic aqueous solution, or the precursor drug dissolved in ethanol, in the presence of certain metals, namely palladium and platinum in fine powder or colloidal form or platinum black.

Oxymorphone hydrochloride occurs as odourless white crystals or white to off-white powder. It darkens in colour with prolonged exposure to light. One gram of oxymorphone hydrochloride is soluble in 4 ml of water and it is sparingly soluble in alcohol and ether. It degrades upon contact with light.

Oxymorphone can be acetylated like morphine, hydromorphone, and some other opioids. Mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra- esters of oxymorphone were developed in the 1930s but are not used in medicine at this time. Presumably other esters such as nicotinyl, benzoyl, formyl, cinnimoyl &amp;c.can be produced.

The 2013 US DEA annual manufacturing quotas were 18 375 kilogrammes for conversion (a number of drugs can be made from oxymorphone, both painkillers and opioid antagonists like naloxone) and 6875 kg for direct manufacture of end-products. Oxymorphone is also a minor metabolite of oxycodone, which is formed by CYP2D6-mediated O-demethylation.

==History==
Oxymorphone was first developed in Germany in 1914, and patented in the US by Endo Pharmaceuticals in 1955. It was introduced in the United States in January 1959 and other countries around the same time.

==Society and culture==

===Brand names===
* Numorphan (suppository and injectable solution)
* Opana ER (extended-release tablet): June 2017 FDA removal request due to rates of IV abuse.
* Opana IR (immediate-release tablet)
* O-Morphon in Bangladesh by Ziska pharmaceutical ltd.

The brand name Numorphan is derived by analogy to the Nucodan name for an oxycodone product (or vice versa) as well as Paramorphan/Paramorfan for dihydromorphine and Paracodin (dihydrocodeine). The only commercially available salt of oxymorphone in most of the world at this time is the hydrochloride, which has a free base conversion ratio of 0.891, and oxymorphone hydrochloride monohydrate has a factor of 0.85.

Generic pill markings are ATV10/APO; HK10 (10 mgs) oblong white and ATV20/APO; HK20 (20 mgs) oblong white.

===Abuse===
In 1924, the United States banned the sale and importation of opium for the manufacture of heroin, an opioid pain medication which was being abused. See Anti-Heroin Act of 1924.

Beginning in the 1990s, prescription opioid drug abuse has been a prevalent public health issue of concern. Since 2013, with greatly increasing morbidity and deaths from overdoses of &quot;synthetic&quot; opioids, such as oxycodone, tramadol, and fentanyl, this issue has developed into a full-fledged epidemic. This has led to several other public health issues, including the spread of diseases like hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

In the United States, as of 2013 more than 12 million people abused opioid drugs at least once a year. In 2010, 16,652 deaths were related to opiate overdose, in 2015 this number increased to 33,091. In September 2013, new FDA labeling guidelines for long-acting and extended-release opioids required manufacturers to remove moderate pain as use indication, reserving the drug for &quot;pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment&quot; however it did not restrict physicians from prescribing opioids for moderate, &quot;as needed&quot; usage.

In January 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an illness associated with intravenous (IV) abuse of oral Opana ER (oxymorphone) in Tennessee. The syndrome resembled that of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Initial therapy included therapeutic plasma exchange, as for TTP. Unlike TTP, no deficient ADAMTS13 activity nor anti-ADAMTS13 antibody was found indicating a thrombotic microangiopathy of different underlying cause. If IV Opana abuse is acknowledged, supportive care, instead of therapeutic plasma exchange could be considered.

In January 2015, the first HIV outbreak linked to abuse of prescription opioid drugs was identified by the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH), in the small, rural community of Scott County in southeastern Indiana.  ISDH launched an investigation into this HIV outbreak when 11 individuals were confirmed positive for HIV with ties tracing back to the same community. Three months into this investigation, ISDH diagnosed a total of 135 people with HIV, with the numbers still increasing. The cause of this outbreak has been linked to the sharing of needles between opioid abusers, which in some cases, involves sharing needles with up to nine different partners.

In late March 2015, reports indicated Austin, Indiana, was the center of an outbreak of HIV caused by oxymorphone use as an injectable recreational drug. The outbreak required emergency action by state officials. The NPR podcast &quot;embedded&quot; episode of 31 March 2016 was an in-depth account of a visit to oxymorphone abusers in Austin, Indiana. In 2016, the street price of oxymorphone was reported to be $140.

The common opioid of abuse in this outbreak has been identified as Opana ER, a time-released oxymorphone pain killer formulated to be resistant to crushing, manufactured by Endo Pharmaceuticals. This harder to crush formulation was put into production in 2012 in an effort to reduce the risk of abuse from snorting the crushed up pill. However, opioid abusers circumvented this issue by finding a way to dissolve and inject the drug.

The extent of this outbreak has garnered the attention of both the CDC and FDA. The CDC opened a larger investigation into all disease outbreaks involving Opana ER, focusing on the incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like illness in the 2012 Tennessee outbreak, as well as the 2015 HIV outbreak in Indiana. The FDA launched a post-marketing safety study regarding the reformulation of Opana ER in 2012 and the Indiana state government helped fund another study exploring the link between HIV infection and injection use of oxymorphone in Indiana from 2014 to 2015.

The results of these studies found that the reformulation of Opana to a hard to crush tablet unintentionally increased the risk of transmission of acquired blood borne infections because opioid abusers switched from using the drug through the nasal route to injection. This epidemic caused the risk of acquiring a blood borne infection with the use of injectable opioids to increase in comparison to the risk of acquiring an infection when using injectable heroin or cocaine.

In June 2017, faced with the public health crisis, the opioid epidemic, the FDA asked Endo Pharmaceuticals to &quot;remove its opioid pain medication, reformulated Opana ER (oxymorphone hydrochloride), from the market&quot;. In their 8 June 2017 press release they also noted that, this was the first time the FDA had taken steps to &quot;remove a currently marketed opioid pain medication from sale due to public health consequences of abuse.&quot; By 6 July 2017, Endo International voluntarily complied with the FDA removal request.

<text>The Edinburgh International Festival is an annual arts festival in Edinburgh, Scotland, spread over the final three weeks in August. Notable figures from the international world of music (especially classical music) and the performing arts are invited to join the festival. Visual art exhibitions, talks and workshops are also hosted. 

The first &#x27;International Festival of Music and Drama&#x27; took place between 22 August and 11 September 1947. Under the first festival director, the distinguished Austrian-born impresario Rudolf Bing, it had a broadly-based programme, covering orchestral, choral and chamber music, Lieder and song, opera, ballet, drama, film, and Scottish &#x27;piping and dancing&#x27; on the Esplanade of Edinburgh Castle, a structure that was followed in subsequent years.

The Festival has taken place every year since 1947, except for 2020 when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A scaled-back version of the festival was held in 2021.

*October 2022–: Nicola Benedetti, Scottish-Italian violinist

==Creation of the festival==

The idea of a Festival with a remit to &quot;provide a platform for the flowering of the human spirit&quot; and enrich the cultural life of Scotland, Britain and Europe took form in the wake of the Second World War. The idea of creating an international festival within the UK was first conceived by Rudolf Bing, the General Manager of Glyndebourne Opera Festival, the arts patron Lady Rosebery, theatre director Sir Tyrone Guthrie, and Audrey Mildmay (wife of John Christie) during a wartime tour of a small-scale Glyndebourne production of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;.

Rudolf Bing conceived of the festival to heal the wounds of war through the languages of the arts. This is its principal &quot;raison d’être&quot;. It was first financed by Lord Rosebery with the £10,000 winnings of his horse Ocean Swell that won the only two major horse-races run in wartime including the Jockey Club Cup in 1944. This sum was matched by Edinburgh Town Council and then some money in turn was matched by the Arts Council of Great Britain under the chairmanship of John Maynard Keynes. Bing also co-founded the Festival with Henry Harvey Wood, Head of the British Council in Scotland, Sidney Newman, Reid Professor of Music at Edinburgh University, and a group of civic leaders from the City of Edinburgh, in particular Sir John Falconer.

Bing had looked at several English cities before shifting his focus to Scotland and settling on Edinburgh, a city he had visited and admired in 1939. In particular, Edinburgh&#x27;s castle reminded him of Salzburg where he had been the festival director before the war. Harvey Wood described the meeting at which the idea was hatched:

The Edinburgh International Festival of Music and Drama was first discussed over a lunch table in a restaurant in Hanover Square, London, towards the end of 1944. Rudolf Bing, convinced that musical and operatic festivals on anything like the pre-war scale were unlikely to be held in any of the shattered and impoverished centres for many years to come, was anxious to consider and investigate the possibility of staging such a Festival somewhere in the United Kingdom in the summer of 1946. He was convinced and he convinced my colleagues and myself that such an enterprise, successfully conducted, might at this moment of European time, be of more than temporary significance and might establish in Britain a centre of world resort for lovers of music, drama, opera, ballet and the graphic arts.
Certain preconditions were obviously required of such a centre. It should be a town of reasonable size, capable of absorbing and entertaining anything between 50,000 and 150,000 visitors over a period of three weeks to a month. It should, like Salzburg, have considerable scenic and picturesque appeal and it should be set in a country likely to be attractive to tourists and foreign visitors. It should have sufficient number of theatres, concert halls and open spaces for the adequate staging of a programme of an ambitious and varied character. Above all it should be a city likely to embrace the opportunity and willing to make the festival a major preoccupation not only in the City Chambers but in the heart and home of every citizen, however modest. Greatly daring but not without confidence I recommended Edinburgh as the centre and promised to make preliminary investigations.

Wood approached Falconer, who enthusiastically welcomed the initiative on behalf of the city. As it was too late to finalise arrangements for 1946, plans were made for the following year.

It was first financed by Lord Rosebery with the £10,000 winnings of his horse Ocean Swell that won the only two major horse-races run in wartime including the Jockey Club Cup in 1944. This sum was matched by Edinburgh Town Council and then some money in turn was matched by the Arts Council of Great Britain under the chairmanship of John Maynard Keynes. Bing also co-founded the Festival with Henry Harvey Wood, Head of the British Council in Scotland, Sidney Newman, Reid Professor of Music at Edinburgh University, and a group of civic leaders from the City of Edinburgh, in particular Sir John Falconer.

==Features of the festival==
The first International Festival took place between 22 August and 11 September 1947, and it remained an event straddling August and September until 2015, when the dates of the Edinburgh International Festival was brought forward to begin and end in August. This brought the International Festival back in sync with the Fringe which had shifted dates several years earlier.

===Classical music===
From the beginning, the festival had a broad coverage, but with an emphasis on classical music, a highlight of the first season being concerts given by the Vienna Philharmonic, reunited with their erstwhile conductor Bruno Walter, who had left Europe after Germany&#x27;s annexation of Austria in 1938.

Many notable musicians appeared at the festival during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Besides Bruno Walter, they included the conductors Wilhelm Furtwängler, John Barbirolli, Thomas Beecham, Adrian Boult, Fritz Busch, Josef Krips, Pierre Monteux and Vittorio Gui, the pianist Artur Schnabel, the violinist Joseph Szigeti, and the singer Lotte Lehmann, all of whom appeared in Edinburgh late their careers.

Rising stars of post-war Europe, such as the conductors Herbert von Karajan, Rafael Kubelík, Charles Munch, Wolfgang Sawallisch, and Leonard Bernstein, the pianists Claudio Arrau, Solomon, and Rudolf Serkin, the string players Yehudi Menuhin, Pierre Fournier, Isaac Stern, and Amadeus String Quartet, and the singers Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Victoria de los Ángeles, Boris Christoff, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, and Peter Pears were all present in Edinburgh concert and recital halls from the beginning of their careers, while the long-lived pianist Artur Rubinstein had a career that seemingly spanned both eras. 

Some of the most impressive performers of the early years had their careers cut short in the 1950s, notably Kathleen Ferrier, Guido Cantelli, Ginette Neveu and Dennis Brain.

Edinburgh remained at the centre of the musical world during the second decade (1957–1966) of the festival. Leading conductors who performed in the city at that time included Otto Klemperer, Ernest Ansermet, Georg Solti, Carlo Maria Giulini, Yevgeny Mravinsky, István Kertész, Bernard Haitink, George Szell and Leopold Stokowski.

During the third decade (1967-1976) a new group of artists came to Edinburgh, many of whom would dominate music for the rest of the century and into the next. They included conductors like Pierre Boulez, Colin Davis, Claudio Abbado, Kurt Masur, Zubin Mehta, Riccardo Muti, and Daniel Barenboim (who also often appeared as a pianist) and soloists like the pianists Claudio Arrau, Alfred Brendel, Murray Perahia, and Marta Argerich, and the string players Jacqueline du Pré and Itzhak Perlman. In addition an outstanding group of Soviet artists included the pianist Sviatoslav Richter, cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich, violinists David Oistrakh and Leonid Kogan, and the soprano Galina Vishnevskaya.

===Opera===
The founders of the Edinburgh Festival had been closely connected with the Glyndebourne Opera and from the beginning opera was an important part of the programme. 

The city did not have, and still does not have, ideal facilities for creating original staged opera productions, so guest companies were invited to the festival. In the early years, Glyndebourne fulfilled this role, bringing two productions a year between 1947 and 1951. Hamburg took over in 1952, with no less than six productions. Glyndebourne returned from 1953 to 1955, now with three operas each year, with Hamburg coming again in 1956 with four productions.

During the second decade (1957–1966), Edinburgh received a series of different opera companies, starting with La Scala (Piccola Scala), and continuing with the Stuttgart State Opera, Royal Opera Stockholm, Glyndebourne Opera, Covent Garden Opera, Belgrade Opera, the English Opera Group, Teatro San Carlo, Naples, Budapest Opera and Ballet, National Theatre, Prague, the Holland Festival and the Bavarian State Opera, with an average of four or five productions each year. Also from 1965, an Edinburgh Festival Opera began to offer locally created shows. 

During the third decade (1967–1976), Edinburgh Festival Opera were prominent performers, together with the Glasgow-based Scottish Opera.

They returned in subsequent years, together with companies including the Ballets des Champs-Élysées from Paris, American National Ballet Theatre from New York, the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas (Le Grand Ballet de Monte Carlo), the Spanish Ballet of Pilar López, the Yugoslav Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet.

===Drama===
Drama was an important feature of the Edinburgh International Festival from its inception, and right through the successful early years.

The Old Vic Theatre Company, like Glyndebourne for opera and Sadler&#x27;s Wells for ballet, gave their strong support to the festival in the beginning, and over the years they were joined by a series of other important British companies such as the Glasgow Citizens&#x27; Theatre, The English Stage Company, Royal Shakespeare Company, Traverse Theatre, Prospect Theatre Company, and the National Theatre of Great Britain. 

One of the festival&#x27;s first dramatic success came in 1948 when an adaptation of Sir David Lyndsay&#x27;s &quot;The Thrie Estaites&quot; was performed to great acclaim for the first time since 1552 in the Assembly Hall on the Mound. The work was revived in 1948. 1949, 1951, 1959 and 1973.

Companies came from all over the world, and with increasing frequency. In the first decade (1947–1956), from France, Italy and Canada, in the second (1957–1966), from France, Italy, Greece, Russia, and Poland, and in the third (1967–1976), from the USA, Sweden, Ireland, Poland, Bulgaria, East Germany, Italy, Romania, Japan, Belgium, and Switzerland. Notable groups included the Le Comédie Française, Düsseldorf Theatre Company, The Stratford Ontario Festival Company, Abbey Theatre Dublin, Theatre on the Balustrade, Prague, La Mama Company, New York and the Noh and Bunraku companies from Japan. 

Noted directors in the early years included E. Martin Browne, Peter Ustinov, Gustav Gründgens, Tyrone Guthrie and Michael Benthall, while in the 1960s and 1970s Frank Dunlop, Richard Eyre, Toby Robertson, Luca Ronconi, and Andrei Serban brought productions to the city.

Well-known actors included Ralph Richardson, Alec Guinness, John Gielgud, Sybil Thorndike, Lewis Casson, Emlyn Williams, Claire Bloom, Alan Badel, Peter Finch, Richard Burton, Fay Compton, Ann Todd, Eric Porter and Edwige Feuillère in the early period, while Anna Calder-Marshall, Derek Jacobi, Felicity Kendal, Ian McKellen, John Neville, Edward Petherbridge, and Timothy West first appeared in the 1960s and 1970s.

===Visual arts===

The visual arts were not featured in the first two festivals in 1947 and 1948, but from 1949 they became an important part of the events. There were major exhibitions at the National Gallery of Scotland and Royal Scottish Academy. These included Rembrandt in 1950, Spanish Paintings (El Greco to Goya) in 1951, Degas in 1952, Renoir in 1953, Cézanne in 1954, Gauguin in 1955, and Braque in 1956.

The second decade of the festival began with Monet in 1957, followed by two exhibitions, Masterpieces of Byzantine Art and the Moltzau Collection (Cézanne to Picasso) featured in 1958, Masterpieces of Czech Art in 1959, German Expressionist Painting in 1960, and an Epstein Memorial Exhibition together with a selection from the Bührle Collection (Zürich) in 1961. Modern Primitive Paintings from Yugoslavia and Matisse and After (from the Sonja Henie — Niels Onstad Collection in Oslo in 1962. Modigliani and Soutine were shown in a double exhibition, together with Music and Dance in Indian Art, in 1963. There was an exhibition of Delacroix in 1964, Corot in 1965, and Rouault in 1966.

The third decade began with Derain in 1967, followed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Wotruba, a &quot;Boudin to Picasso&quot; exhibition at the Royal Scottish Academy, and &quot;Canada 101&quot;, a focus on contemporary Canadian art, all in 1968. &quot;Sixteenth century Italian drawings from British private collections&quot; (at Merchants&#x27; Hall), &quot;Contemporary Polish art&quot;, and &quot;Jack Coia gold medallist&quot; were shown in 1969. For 1970, the exhibitions were &quot;Early Celtic art&quot; and &quot;Contemporary German art from Düsseldorf&quot;. &quot;The Belgian contribution to surrealism&quot;, &quot;Sir Walter Scott Bicentenary&quot; and &quot;Contemporary Romanian art&quot; exhibitions were offered in 1971. In 1972 the Scottish painter Alan Davie was featured at the Royal Scottish Academy, followed in 1973 by &quot;Permanences e l&#x27;Art Francais&quot; in the same gallery, as well as &quot;Objects USA at the City of Edinburgh Art Gallery, and a &quot;Tyrone Guthrie exhibition&quot;.

=== World premieres ===

Many works have received their world premieres at the Edinburgh International Festival, from T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Cocktail Party&quot; and &quot;The Confidential Clerk&quot; in 1949 and 1953, to James MacMillan&#x27;s 2018 version of &quot;Quickening&quot; and Symphony No. 5, both in 2019.

* St Cecilia&#x27;s Hall (180) a historic concert hall in the Cowgate, which dates back to 1763.
==Other festivals in Edinburgh==
About ten other festivals are held in Edinburgh at about the same time as the International Festival. Collectively, the entire group is referred to as the Edinburgh Festival or Edinburgh Festivals.

Most notable is the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, which started as an offshoot of the International Festival in the first year of its operation (although not known as such at the beginning), and has since grown to be the world&#x27;s largest arts and media festival. 

The Edinburgh International Film Festival also began in August 1947 with a programme of documentary films. In the 1990s this festival moved into June. The 1966 Writers&#x27; Festival begun by John Calder, Richard Demarco, Jim Haynes, founders of the Paperback Bookshop and Traverse Theatre, eventually led to the Edinburgh International Book Festival also staged in August. 

The British Army&#x27;s desire to showcase itself during the festival period led to the independent staging of the first Edinburgh Military Tattoo, featuring displays of piping and dancing, in 1950. This annual event has come to be regarded as a part of the official festival, though it continues to be organised separately.

The result is a collection of festivals with more than 2,500 performances and events every day in Edinburgh in August, which is said to be many times larger than any similar conglomeration of arts and media festivals anywhere in the world.

<text>John Morton Eshleman (June 14, 1876 – February 28, 1916) was an American lawyer and politician from California. He was the 26th lieutenant governor of California from 1915 to 1916.

A native of the Midwest, Eshleman was born in Villa Ridge, Illinois, but went west in 1896 to work on the Southern Pacific Railroad. Eshleman received his Bachelor of Arts from the University of California, Berkeley in 1902, and the next year he received his Master of Arts there. At Berkeley, he was president of the student government. Eshleman was admitted to the California Bar in 1905 and was appointed Deputy State Labor Commissioner by Governor George Pardee.

Eshleman ran for the state legislature on a Republican and Union-Labor ticket and was elected to the 38th California Assembly from the 52d District (Berkeley) in 1907. Though appointed Deputy District Attorney of Alameda County, he did not serve, moving instead to the Imperial Valley in Southern California for the dry air because of his poor health. When Imperial County was created from the eastern part of San Diego County in August 1907, Eshleman was chosen to be the first District Attorney of the county, serving from 1907 to 1910.

In 1910, Eshleman was elected to the third district seat on the California Railroad Commission with the backing of the progressive Lincoln-Roosevelt League. He was subsequently elected chair of the commission upon taking office in 1911. Eshleman was elected Lieutenant Governor as a Progressive in 1914. Inaugurated January 5, 1915, he served until his death under Governor Hiram Johnson. Eshleman died in 1916 in Indio, California, after a long battle with tuberculosis, and was buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California. His remains were moved to Sunset View Cemetery in El Cerrito, California, in 1956. Johnson appointed William Stephens to replace Eshleman as lieutenant governor. Eshleman also served as an &quot;ex officio&quot; regent of the University of California by virtue of his office as lieutenant governor.

The student union at UC Berkeley was named Eshleman Hall in his honor; this building was later renamed Moses Hall. A new building (1965) called Eshleman Hall was subsequently erected, which housed various student groups including the campus newspaper, &quot;The Daily Californian&quot;. Eshleman Hall was demolished in the summer of 2013 and rebuilt in 2015.

Eshleman married Elizabeth Ledgett in 1906. His son, also named John Morton &quot;Jack&quot;, was a newspaper reporter and wrote detective novels set in the Bay Area. Jack was an activist for labor rights and, during World War II, helped bring about the demise of &quot;auxiliary&quot; (segregated) unions in the Kaiser shipyards. His daughter, Jane Eshleman Conant, was a pioneering woman writer for San Francisco newspapers from 1941 to 1976. Eshleman also had two other children, Kathryn Eshleman Wahl, a women&#x27;s editor at the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot;, and Robert T. Eshleman, a prominent Bay Area attorney. His daughters were the first two women&#x27;s editors at &quot;The Daily Californian&quot;, which was housed in the original building named for their father.

<doc id="881793" wikidata="Q736185" url="?curid=881793" title="Château de Marly">
<text>The Château de Marly () was a French royal residence located in what is now Marly-le-Roi, the commune on the northern edge of the royal park. This was situated west of the palace and garden complex at Versailles. Marly-le-Roi is the town that developed to serve the château, which was demolished in 1806 after passing into private ownership and being used as a factory. The town is now a bedroom community for Paris.

At the Château of Marly, Louis XIV of France escaped from the formal rigors he was constructing at Versailles. Small rooms meant less company, and simplified protocol; courtiers, who fought among themselves for invitations to Marly, were housed in a revolutionary design of twelve pavilions built in matching pairs flanking the central sheets of water, which were fed one from the other by formalized cascades (&quot;illustration, right&quot;).

After the French Revolution, about 1800, the château was sold to a private owner. He demolished it in 1806 after his factory there failed. The hydraulic &quot;machine&quot; that pumped water for Versailles was also demolished. Only the foundation of Jules Hardouin-Mansart&#x27;s small château the &quot;pavillon du Roi&quot; remains at the top of the slope in Marly park. Napoleon bought back the estate in 1807, and the park belongs to the state.

==History==
The works at Marly were begun in the spring of 1679, on 22 May, before Louis had moved his court permanently to Versailles. The king was looking for a retreat on well-wooded royal lands between Versailles and Saint-Germain-en-Laye that were well-watered and provided a grand view. Marly was chosen.

Robert Berger has demonstrated that the design of Marly was a full collaboration between Jules Hardouin-Mansart and the &quot;Premier peintre du Roi&quot; Charles Le Brun, who were concurrently working on the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. Mansart&#x27;s elevations for the pavilions were to be frescoed to designs adapted from a suite that Le Brun had recently drawn. The frescoed exteriors of the otherwise somewhat severe buildings created a richly Baroque ensemble of feigned sculptures against draperies and hangings, with vases on feigned sculptural therms against the piers— all in the somewhat eclectic Olympian symbolism that Le Brun and the King favoured everywhere at Versailles.

The decor of the pavillon du Roi featured Apollo, the Sun King&#x27;s iconographic persona, and Thetis. Other pavilions were dedicated to other Olympians, but also to Hercules, and to Victory, Fame and Abundance. Construction was completed by 1684, though the overcharged painted programmes were simplified and restrained in the execution.
The Sun King attended the opening of the completed hydraulic works in June 1684 and by 1686 development was sufficiently advanced for the King to stay there for the first time, with a selected entourage. The theme of Marly was that it was a simple hunting lodge, just enough to accommodate the Royal Hunt. In 1688 the &quot;Grand Abreuvoir à chevaux&quot; was installed on the terrace, a mere &quot;horse trough.&quot;

Throughout the rest of his life, Louis continued to embellish the wooded park, with wide straight rides, in which ladies or the infirm might follow the hunt, at some distance, in a carriage, and with more profligate waterworks than waterless Versailles could provide: the &quot;Rivière&quot; or &quot;Grande Cascade&quot; dates to 1697–1698. Versailles was provided with water from Marly.
The famous description of Marly in the memoirs of Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon were written in retrospect and, for the initiation of Marly, at second hand; when Saint-Simon wrote, in 1715, Marly&#x27;s heyday was ending, with the death of Louis XIV that year. Louis&#x27; heirs found the north-facing slope made Marly damp and dreary, and rarely visited.

The &quot;river&quot; was filled in and grassed in 1728. During the Revolution the marble horses by Guillaume Coustou the Elder, the &quot;Chevaux de Marly&quot;, were transported to Paris (1794), to flank the opening of the &quot;Champs-Élysées&quot; in the soon-to-be-renamed &quot;Place de la Concorde&quot; (they are now displayed in the &quot;Musée du Louvre&quot;, along with many other Marly sculptures).

In 1799/1800, Marly was sold to an industrialist, M. Sagniel, who installed machinery to spin cotton thread. When the factory failed in 1806, the château was demolished and its building materials sold, including the lead from its roof. Napoleon bought back the estate the following year; the empty gardens and the surrounding woodland park still belong to the State.

==Remains==

At the end of the 19th century, several connoisseurs purchased leases on the individual &quot;garçonnières&quot;, cleaned up the overgrowth, recovered some bruised and broken statuary and recreated small gardens among the ruins: Alexandre Dumas, fils and the playwright and collector of 18th-century furnishings Victorien Sardou.

The &quot;Cour Marly&quot; of the Louvre museum was inaugurated in 1993. It contains mostly works of art from Marly, displayed on three levels.

==The Marly &quot;machine&quot;==

Providing a sufficient water supply for the fountains at Versailles had been a problem from the outset. The construction of the Marly hydraulic &quot;machine&quot;, actually located in Bougival (where its inventor Rennequin Sualem died in 1708), driven by the current of the Seine moving fourteen vast paddle wheels, was a miracle of modern hydraulic engineering, perhaps the largest integrated machine of the 17th century.

It pumped water to a head of 100 meters into reservoirs at Louveciennes (where Madame du Barry had her château in the 1760s). The water then flowed either to fill the cascade at Marly or drive the fountains at Versailles — the latter, after passing through an elaborate underground network of reservoirs and aqueducts. The machine could only deliver sufficient pressure to satisfy either Marly or Versailles, and invariably the King&#x27;s demands received priority.

In the nineteenth century, various other pumps replaced the originals, and the last was taken out of service in 1967.

<doc id="881804" wikidata="Q42037" url="?curid=881804" title="J. M. G. Le Clézio">
<text>Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio (; 13 April 1940), usually identified as J. M. G. Le Clézio, of French, Mauritian, and British nationality, is a writer and professor. The author of over forty works, he was awarded the 1963 Prix Renaudot for his novel and the 2008 Nobel Prize in Literature for his life&#x27;s work, as an &quot;author of new departures, poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy, explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilization&quot;.

==Biography==
Le Clézio&#x27;s mother was born in the French Riviera city of Nice, his father on the island of Mauritius (which was a British possession, but his father was ethnically Breton, in France). Both his father&#x27;s and his mother&#x27;s ancestors were originally from Morbihan, on the south coast of Brittany.
His paternal ancestor François Alexis Le Clézio fled France in 1798 and settled with his wife and daughter on Mauritius, which was then a French colony but would soon pass into British hands. The colonists were allowed to maintain their customs and use the French language. Le Clézio has never lived in Mauritius for more than a few months at a time, but he has stated that he regards himself both as a Frenchman and a Mauritian. He has dual French and Mauritian citizenship (Mauritius gained independence in 1968) and calls Mauritius his &quot;little fatherland&quot;.

Le Clézio was born in Nice, his mother&#x27;s native city, during World War II when his father was serving in the British Army in Nigeria. He was raised in Roquebillière, a small village near Nice until 1948 when he, his mother, and his brother boarded a ship to join his father in Nigeria. His 1991 novel &quot;Onitsha&quot; is partly autobiographical. In a 2004 essay, he reminisced about his childhood in Nigeria and his relationship with his parents.

After studying at the University of Bristol in England from 1958 to 1959, Le Clézio finished his undergraduate degree at Nice&#x27;s Institut d&#x27;études littéraires. In 1964 Le Clézio earned a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Provence with a thesis on Henri Michaux and the mystical experience.

After several years spent in London and Bristol, Le Clézio moved to the United States to work as a teacher. In 1967 he served as an aid worker in Thailand as part of his national service, but was quickly expelled from the country for protesting against child prostitution and sent to Mexico to finish his national service. From 1970 to 1974, he lived with the Embera-Wounaan tribe in Panama. He has been married since 1975 to Jémia Jean, who is Moroccan, and has three daughters (one by his first marriage with Rosalie Piquemal). Since the 1990s they have divided their residence between Albuquerque, Mauritius, and Nice.

In 1983 Le Clézio wrote a doctoral thesis on colonial Mexican history for the University of Perpignan, on the conquest of the Purépecha people who inhabit the present-day state of Michoacán. It was serialized in a French magazine and published in Spanish in 1985.

Le Clézio has taught at a number of universities around the world. A frequent visitor to South Korea, he taught French language and literature at Ewha Womans University in Seoul during the 2007 academic year. In November 2013, Le Clézio joined Nanjing University in China as a professor.

== Literary career ==
Le Clézio began writing at the age of seven; his first work was a book about the sea. He achieved success at the age of 23, when his first novel, &quot;Le Procès-Verbal&quot; (&quot;The Interrogation&quot;), was the Prix Renaudot and was shortlisted for the Prix Goncourt. Since then he has published more than thirty-six books, including short stories, novels, essays, two translations on the subject of Native American mythology, and several children&#x27;s books.

From 1963 to 1975, Le Clézio explored themes such as insanity, language, nature, and writing. He devoted himself to formal experimentation in the wake of such contemporaries as Georges Perec or Michel Butor. His persona was that of an innovator and a rebel, for which he was praised by Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze.

During the late 1970s, Le Clézio&#x27;s style changed drastically; he abandoned experimentation, and the mood of his novels became less tormented as he used themes like childhood, adolescence, and travelling, which attracted a broader audience. In 1980, Le Clézio was the first winner of the newly created Grand Prix Paul Morand, awarded by the Académie Française, for his novel &quot;Désert&quot;. In 1994, a survey conducted by the French literary magazine &quot;Lire&quot; showed that 13 per cent of the readers considered him to be the greatest living French-language writer.

==Nobel Prize==
The Nobel Prize in Literature for 2008 went to Le Clézio for works characterized by the Swedish Academy as being &quot;poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy&quot; and for being focused on the environment, especially the desert. The Swedish Academy, in announcing the award, called Le Clézio an &quot;author of new departures, poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy, explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilization.&quot; Le Clézio used his Nobel prize acceptance lecture to attack the subject of information poverty. The title of his lecture was &quot;Dans la forêt des paradoxes&quot; (&quot;In the forest of paradoxes&quot;), a title he attributed to Stig Dagerman.

Gao Xingjian, a Chinese émigré writing in Mandarin, was the previous French citizen to receive the prize (for 2000); Le Clézio was the first French-language writer to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature since Claude Simon for 1985, and the fourteenth since Sully Prudhomme, laureate of the first prize of 1901.

==Controversy==
Le Clézio is a staunch defender of Mama Rosa, director of a Mexican shelter raided by the police in July 2014 when children were found eating rotten food and kept against the will of their parents. He wrote an article in &quot;Le Monde&quot; arguing that she is close to sanctity.

<text>Aljamiado (; ; trans. &quot;ʿajamiyah&quot; ) or Aljamía texts are manuscripts that use the Arabic script for transcribing European languages, especially Romance languages such as Old Spanish or Aragonese. This alphabet is also called the Morisco alphabet.

According to Anwar G. Chejne, &quot;Aljamiado&quot; or &quot;Aljamía&quot; is &quot;a corruption of the Arabic word &quot;ʿajamiyah&quot; (in this case it means foreign language) and, generally, the Arabic expression &quot;ʿajam&quot; and its derivative &quot;ʿajamiyah&quot; are applicable to peoples whose ancestry is not of Arabian origin&quot;. During the Arab conquest of Persia, the term became a pejorative.

== History ==
The systematic writing of Romance-language texts in Arabic scripts appears to have begun in the fifteenth century, and the overwhelming majority of such texts that can be dated belong to the sixteenth century. A key &quot;aljamiado&quot; text is the compilation &quot;Suma de los principales mandamientos y devediamentos de nuestra santa ley y sunna&quot; by the mufti of Segovia, of 1462.

In later times, Moriscos were banned from using Arabic as a religious language, and wrote in Spanish on Islamic subjects. Examples are the &quot;Coplas del alhichante de Puey Monzón&quot;, narrating a &quot;Hajj&quot;, or the &quot;Poema de Yuçuf&quot; on the Biblical Joseph (written in Aragonese).

Aljamiado played a very important role in preserving Islam and the Arabic language in the life of the Moriscos of Castile and Aragon; Valencian and Granadan Moriscos spoke and wrote in Andalusi Arabic. After the fall of the last Muslim kingdom on the Iberian peninsula, the Moriscos (Muslims in parts of what was once Al-Andalus) were forced to convert to Christianity or leave the peninsula. They were forced to adopt Christian customs and traditions and to attend church services on Sundays. Nevertheless, some of the Moriscos kept their Islamic belief and traditions secretly, and this included the usage of Aljamiado.

In 1567, Philip II of Spain issued a royal decree in Spain, which forced Moriscos to abandon using Arabic on all occasions, formal and informal, speaking and writing. Using Arabic in any sense of the word would be regarded as a crime. They were given three years to learn the language of the Christian Spanish, after which they would have to get rid of all Arabic written material. Moriscos of Castile and Aragon translated all prayers and the Hadith (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad) into Aljamiado transcriptions of the Spanish language, while keeping all Qur&#x27;anic verses in the original Arabic. Aljamiado scrolls were circulated amongst the Moriscos. Historians came to know about Aljamiado literature only in the early nineteenth century. Some of the Aljamiado scrolls are kept in the Spanish National Library in Madrid.

===Letters===

Notes:
# The letter &quot;alif&quot; (ا) plays three roles. First as a carrier of vowel at the beginning of a word. Second is for writing the [e] sound in combination with diacritic, and third is for writing vowel hiatus.
# It is not an independent letter, but a special &quot;dongara&quot; consisting of a letter and a consonant (in other words, the repetition of a letter) to indicate a specific sound.
# These letters are only used in writing Arabic loanwords. The Ladino equivalents for these letters are in accordance with the Judeo-Arabic orthographic traditions.
# This letter has a dual pronunciation, depending on the letter after it. For this reason, both in Aljamiado and in Ladino, two different letters are used to represent it.
# In Ladino, the pronunciation of this letter differs from its equivalent in modern Spanish.
# Whenever the letter &quot;D&quot; is at the beginning of the word, or after a nasal consonant (&quot;m&quot; or &quot;n&quot;), or after a lateral consonant (&quot;l&quot;), pronounced as [d] and written with the letter &quot;d&quot;. In all other cases, it is pronounced as [ð] and written with the letter &quot;d&quot;.
# In old Spanish, the letter &quot;X&quot; was for representing the sound [ʃ]. But in some words, especially those that start with &quot;ex-&quot;, the pronunciation of this letter is [s], [ks] or [gz].
# In the writing of Aljamiado, the Maghrebi script has been common, in which the placement and number of dot of on letters &quot;faʾ&quot; and &quot;qafʾ&quot; are different from the conventional Arabic script, or the so-called &quot;Mashreqi script&quot;.
# The letter &quot;waw&quot; does not correspond to any exact letter in the Spanish Latin alphabet. This letter and its sound [w] are pronounced in certain digraphs and trigraphs. Worded differently, there are diphthongs and triphthongs as result of certain vowel sequences, where the sound [w] is pronounced and the letter &quot;waw&quot; is used to write it.
# The letter &quot;y&quot; in the Spanish Latin alphabet is equivalent to &quot;yaʾ&quot; (ي). But this letter is also used to write some consonant sequences, especially consonant sequences that have a sound similar to [j] in their pronunciation.

=== Vowels ===

Spanish has 5 vowels, which include [a], [e], [i], [o], [u].

In the Arabic language and alphabet, however, there are only 3 vowels, [a], [i], [u]. In Arabic, these 3 vowels have both a short form, which is represented by diacritics &quot;fatʾha&quot;, &quot;kasra&quot;, and &quot;ḍamma&quot;, and long forms, which are represented by the letters &quot;alif&quot; (ا), &quot;yaʾ&quot; (ي), and &quot;waw&quot; (و).

In Spanish, however, there is no difference between short and long vowels. In Aljamiado alphabet, 4 vowels are written as follows:

The vowel [a] is represented by the diacritic &quot;◌َ&quot;.
The vowel [i] is represented by the diacritic &quot;◌ِ&quot;.
The two vowels [o] and [u] are merged and are represented by the diacritic &quot;◌ُ&quot;.
The vowel [e] is represented by the combination of fatʾha and &quot;alif&quot; &quot;ـَـا&quot;.

The Hebrew alphabet, like Arabic, has both diacritics, known as niqqud, and the use of three letters &quot;alef&quot; (א), &quot;vav&quot; (ו), and &quot;yod&quot; (י). In the Judaeo-Spanish alphabet, niqqud is not used, and only three aforementioned letters are used. Also, in addition to the merger of [o] and [u], two vowels [i] and [e] are also merged, and thus only three vowels are shown; as follows:

The vowel [a] is represented by &quot;alif&quot; &quot;א&quot;.
The two vowels [e] and [i] are merged and represented by &quot;yod&quot; &quot;י&quot;.
The two vowels [o] and [u] are merged and are represented by &quot;vav&quot; &quot;ו&quot;.

In Aljamiado, similar to Arabic and Persian, when the vowel is at the beginning of the word, &quot;alif&quot; (ا) is used as the vowel carrier, except for the [e] sound. For the [e] sound, a hamza is used as a vowel carrier, followed by &quot;alif&quot; (ا). In Judaeo-Spanish (Ladino) as in Arabic, &quot;alif&quot; &quot;א&quot; plays the same role.

No distinction between unstressed or stressed vowels exist in Aljamiado manuscripts.

In the middle of the word, in Aljamiado, only diacritics (and for the case of [e] only a diacritic and an &quot;alif&quot; (ا) and in Judaeo-Spanish only one of the three previously mentioned letters are used.

Notes:
# The letter &quot;hei&quot; (ה) is used when the vowel [a] is at the end of the word. This letter is the equivalent to the letter «ه، ـه» or «ة، ـة» in Persian and Arabic.

====Vowel Sequences====

In Spanish, vowels sequences fall into two general types, diphthongs and Vowel hiatus. &quot;diphthong&quot; means that in practice, a pair of sequential vowels are read as a single vowel under one syllable. &quot;Vowel hiatus&quot; means that two vowels are read as two consecutive separate syllables.

The pronunciation of vowels and their writing are subject to certain rules in the Spanish Latin Alphabet, as well as in Aljamiado. In Spanish, vowels are divided into two general groups: &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot;:

* Vowels [a], [e], [o] are classified as strong;
* Vowels [i], [u] are classified as weak.

As previously mentioned, in Aljamiado, there is no difference in writing between [o] and [u]. In Judaeo-Spanish, there&#x27;s no difference between [o] and [u], nor between [e] and [i].

&quot;Vowel hiatus&quot; occurs when two strong vowels are sequential. In such a case, each vowel is read as part of a separate syllable. &quot;Diphthong&quot; occurs when one vowel is weak and the other is strong. In this case, Stress in pronunciation is on the strong vowel. Of course, there are exceptions to these rules.

Below table outlines the general guidelines and some examples

=== Consonants ===

In order to better understand Aljamiado writing conventions, it is necessary to understand the pronunciation of Old Spanish and the evolution of the sounds of Spanish. That is why the manuscripts of Aljamiado are considered important sources for the study of Spanish linguistics.

The first thing that should be mentioned is that in Aljamiado, like Persian and other Arabic-derived alphabets, changes were made to the letters in the Arabic alphabet in order to show new consonants. In other Arabic-derived alphabets, these changes were made by adding dots to the letters that most closely match an existing sound in Arabic alphabet. But in Aljamiado, this was done by gemination mark on the letters with the closest existing sound. Gemination, in addition to this role, in Aljamiado also plays the role of geminating, like Arabic, something that is done in the Spanish Latin alphabet by writing letters twice. For example, &quot;ب&quot; produces a [b], but &quot;بّ&quot; produces a [p].

The Ladino alphabet also does the same thing with niqqud such as &quot;Rafe&quot; (רָפֶה) &quot;◌ﬞ&quot; or &quot;Geresh&quot; (גֶּרֶשׁ) &quot;◌׳&quot;, for example &quot;ב&quot; produces the sound [b], and &quot;בﬞ&quot; or &quot;ב׳&quot; produce the sound [v].

Notes
# This sound, for the most part, has evolved out of existence in Modern Spanish. The &quot;x&quot; (شّ) now sounds like &quot;j&quot; ([x]) in most cases in modern Spanish.

Some letters simply adopted another value.

The phoneme /β/ was typically represented by the letter ب (b), though in some instances it was represented by the letter ف (f). The plosive consonants were required to be aspirated; however, this aspect was lost in weaker positions such as the initial position of a word or an intervocalic position. In Aljamiado texts, the letter ط was utilized to represent the phoneme /t/ in initial and intervocalic positions where it was unaspirated, while the letter ت was utilized in postconsonantal positions to indicate the aspirated form of the phoneme. Similarly, the letter ﻕ was used to represent the phoneme /k/ in initial and intervocalic positions where it was unaspirated, and the letter ﻙ was used in postconsonantal positions to indicate the aspirated form. However, according to the glossary of Abuljair, the aspiration of plosive consonants never ceased to occur in any position.

===B, V (ب) and P (بّ)===

In Spanish language, the letter &quot;B&quot; has two allophones. If the letter is at the beginning of the word, or after a nasal consonant (&quot;m&quot; or &quot;n&quot;), it is pronounced as [b]. Otherwise, it is pronounced as [v~β]. The letter &quot;v&quot; also is pronounced as [v~β] regardless of position in the word.

In Aljamiado, no distinction is made between any one of these. The letter &quot;baʾ&quot; (ب) is used for all cases.

In Judeo-Spanish, distinction is made between these two allophones. Cases of [b] are written with the letter &quot;beth&quot; &quot;ב&quot;. Whereas the sounds [v~β] are written with the letter &quot;beth&quot; with Rafe or Geresh &quot;בﬞ (ב׳)&quot;. US Government Guide on Romanization of Ladino 
As Arabic alphabet lacks a letter for the equivalent to the letter &quot;P&quot;, the sound [p], in Aljamiado, a digraph has been created. This digraph consists of the letter &quot;baʾ&quot; and a shadda, &quot;بّ&quot;.

This is not an issue in Judeo-Spanish, as the letter &quot;Pe&quot; has two possible pronunciations of [p] and [f]. Thus for the sound [p], the letter &quot;pe&quot; (פ) is used. For the sound [f], the letter &quot;pe&quot; plus Rafe or Geresh (פﬞ (פ׳) / ף) is used.

===G, J (ج and خ) and Ch (جّ)===

In Spanish, the letter &quot;G&quot; represents two pronunciations. If &quot;G&quot; is followed by &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, or &quot;y&quot;, it will have a &quot;soft&quot; pronunciation [x]. Otherwise, it will have a hard pronunciation [g].

In Spanish, the letter &quot;J&quot; has pronunciation identical with &quot;soft G&quot;. In old Spanish, these two were pronounced as [ʒ‍~d͡ʒ]. Thus, the Aljamiado letter for both these sounds is reflective of this historic sound. The letter &quot;jim&quot; (ج) is used, as opposed to &quot;khaʾ&quot; (خ).

Similarly in Judeo-Spanish, the letter &quot;gimel&quot; plus Rafe or Geresh (גﬞ (ג׳)) has historically been used. In Modern Judeo-Spanish (Ladino), unlike varieties of Spanish, this historic pronunciation has been preserved. However, due to contact and influence from other languages, namely Serbo-Croatian, Turkish, and French, a distinction between [ʒ‍] and [d͡ʒ] in orthography has come to dominance. Namely that the former ([ʒ‍]) are shown with &quot;zayn&quot; Rafe or Geresh (זﬞ (ז׳)).

===D (د and ذ)===

Similar to the letter &quot;B&quot;, the letter &quot;D&quot; represents two allophones in Spanish. If the letter is at the beginning of the word, or after a nasal consonant (&quot;m&quot; or &quot;n&quot;), it is pronounced as [d]. Otherwise, it is pronounced as [ð].

While this is not reflected in Latin alphabet, in Aljamiado manuscripts, as well as in Judeo-Spanish (not universally) is shown.

In instances where the pronunciation is [d], the letter &quot;dal&quot; (د) has been used in Aljamiado, and the letter &quot;dalet&quot; (ד) Judeo-Spanish.

In instances where the pronunciation is [ð], the letter &quot;ḏal&quot; (ذ) has been used in Aljamiado, and the letter &quot;dalet&quot; plus Rafe or Geresh (דﬞ (ד׳)) Judeo-Spanish.

===R (ر) and Rr (رّ)===

In Spanish Latin Alphabet, &quot;r&quot; versus &quot;rr&quot; denotes a difference in pronunciation, with the former being [ɾ] (Voiced alveolar tap), and the latter [r] (Voiced alveolar trill). This distinction is used in Aljamiado too with the use of shadda. The letter &quot;r&quot; being shown with &quot;raʾ&quot; (ر), and the &quot;rr&quot; with &quot;raʾ-shadda&quot; (رّ).

This distinction is not shown in Judeo-Spanish. Both cases are shown with a single &quot;resh&quot; (ר). In some regional varieties of Ladino, the distinction in pronunciation had ceased to exist as well.

===Z (ز), Ç/S (س), and X (ش)===

One of the notable evolutions in the Spanish language has been with respect to fricative-coronal consonants.

In old Spanish, the letter &quot;z&quot; was pronounced as [d͡z]. It is thus written in Aljamiado with the letter &quot;zaʾ&quot; (ز). In Judeo-Spanish, the letter &quot;zayin&quot; (ז) is used. However, in modern Spanish, the pronunciation of the letter &quot;z&quot; has evolved in two manners. In most dialects of European Spanish, the letter &quot;z&quot; today is pronounced identically as the soft pronunciation of the letter &quot;c&quot;, as [θ]. In Latin American dialects, the letter &quot;z&quot; is pronounced identically as the letter &quot;s&quot; and the soft pronunciation of the letter &quot;c&quot;, as [s].

The letter &quot;c&quot; has two pronunciations in Spanish, based on rules and factors, hard and soft C. &quot;c&quot; is pronounced &quot;soft&quot; if it is followed by &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, or &quot;y&quot;, or if it is given a cedilla accent (ç). In other cases, &quot;c&quot; is pronounced as &quot;hard&quot;, as a [k].

In old Spanish, the soft pronunciation of &quot;c&quot; was as [t͡s]. In Aljamiado, this letter was uniquely assigned the letter &quot;sin&quot; (س). In Judeo-Spanish, the letter &quot;samech&quot; (ס) was used.

However, in modern Spanish, the soft pronunciation of the letter &quot;c&quot; has evolved in two manners. In most dialects of European Spanish, the letter &quot;c&quot; today is pronounced identically as the letter &quot;z&quot;, as [θ]. In Latin American dialects, the soft pronunciation of the letter &quot;c&quot; is pronounced identically as the letter &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z&quot;, as [s].

In old Spanish, the letter &quot;s&quot; was pronounced as [s] or [z], distinct from the soft pronunciation of the letter &quot;c&quot;. The digraph &quot;ss&quot; represented [s] as well, but has since been replaced with a single &quot;s&quot; in Spanish orthography. To reflect the difference between &quot;s&quot; and soft pronunciation of &quot;c&quot;, in Aljamiado, the letter &quot;shin&quot; (ش) was given a new association and sound, and was used to write &quot;s&quot;. Similarly, in Judeo-Spanish, letter &quot;shin&quot; (ש) was used.

In modern Judeo-Spanish, in the centuries after expulsion of Jews from Spain, as the pronunciations of &quot;c&quot; and &quot;s&quot; merged independently of Spanish, confusion ensued for a few decades, with both &quot;samech&quot; (ס) and &quot;shin&quot; (ש) being used interchangeably. Today, the letter &quot;samech&quot; (ס) has won out and is used exclusively.

In old Spanish, the letter &quot;x&quot; had a pronunciation as [ʃ]. In Aljamiado, the letter &quot;shin&quot; (ش) was used. In Judeo-Spanish, the letter &quot;shin&quot; has been used, historically with niqqud Rafe or Geresh (שﬞ (ש׳)). But in modern times, without any (ש).

In modern Spanish, the pronunciation of &quot;x&quot; has evolved. In most cases, it is now pronounced as the letter &quot;j&quot; would, [x]. This is reflected in orthography as well. In Judeo-Spanish, the original pronunciation has been retained.

In some instances, especially in beginning of words as &quot;ex-&quot;, the letter &quot;x&quot; has preserved an [s] sound, or a [ks] sound. In Judeo-Spanish this is reflected mostly by &quot;gimel+zayin&quot; (גז) and in some other words as &quot;koph+samech&quot; (קס).

== Modern Phonetic Aljamiado ==

In the modern era, with an increased interest in the history and culture of the Muslim-ruled era of Spanish history, linguists and language-enthutiasts have attempted to study more deeply the history of Aljamiado. Some, such as &quot;Fernando Tejón&quot;, have compiled, updated, and standardized a new iteration of the Aljamiado script, having it match the modern phonetics of Peninsular Spanish, which in a sense makes this effort, more of creating an Aljamiado-derived transliteration scheme, than an alphabet. The stated objective of this transliteration scheme is to have an accurate one-to-one representation of all phonetic sounds that are found in standard Peninsular Spanish, eliminating detailed representation of allophones (in contrast with traditional Aljamiado, in which for example the letter &quot;d&quot; was written with either د or ذ, sounds /d/ and /ð/ respectively). This section presents this modern alphabet.
This specific scheme has been designed based on the principle of ease-of-use and practicality, meaning that the letters and diacritics used, are the typical ones found in standard Arabic script, with no need for additional characters or modifications. This is in line with the traditional Aljamiado itself, in which for example the letter &quot;p&quot; is written with a geminated &quot;b&quot;, as in «بّ» (&quot;b&quot; with a shadda diacritic). This principle applies to vowels as well, where the sukun (no-vowel) diacritic (◌ْ) has been designated for the sound of &quot;o&quot;, while actual cases of &quot;no-vowel&quot; are deliberately left without any diacritic, and where the nasan &quot;an&quot; diacritic (◌ً) has been designated for vowel &quot;e&quot;

Below table presents the letters and diacritics:

== Other uses ==

The practice of Jews writing Romance languages such as Spanish, Aragonese or Catalan in the Hebrew script is also referred to as &quot;aljamiado&quot;.

The word &quot;aljamiado&quot; is sometimes used for other non-Semitic language written in Arabic letters:

* Bosnian and Albanian texts written in Arabic script during the Ottoman period have been referred to as aljamiado. However, many linguists prefer to limit the term to Romance languages, instead using &quot;Arebica&quot; to refer to the use of Arabic script for Slavic languages like Bosnian.
* The word &quot;Aljamiado&quot; is also used to refer to Greek written in the Arabic/Ottoman alphabet.

<doc id="881819" wikidata="Q7659970" url="?curid=881819" title="Sydney Hilton Hotel bombing">
<text>The Sydney Hilton Hotel bombing occurred on 13 February 1978, when a bomb exploded outside the Hilton Hotel in George Street, Sydney, Australia. The hotel was hosting the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting (CHOGRM), a regional offshoot of the biennial meetings of the heads of government from across the Commonwealth of Nations.

The bomb was planted in a rubbish bin and exploded when the bin was emptied into a garbage truck outside the hotel at 12:40 a.m. It killed two men, Alec Carter and William Favell, the garbage collectors who picked up the bin. A police officer guarding the entrance to the hotel lounge, Paul Burmistriw, died later. It injured eleven others. Twelve foreign leaders were staying in the hotel at the time, but none were injured. Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser immediately deployed the Australian Army for the remainder of the CHOGRM meeting.

The Hilton case has been highly controversial due to allegations that Australian security forces, such as the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), may have been responsible. This led to the Parliament of New South Wales unanimously calling for the Commonwealth to hold an inquiry in 1991 and 1995.

The Hilton bombing was described in Parliament as the first and only domestic terrorist event in Australia.

Prior to the bombing, the security forces had been under considerable pressure. In South Australia, the White inquiry into their police special branch was very critical, and ties with ASIO were cut. New South Wales was about to have a similar inquiry. After the bombing, the NSW inquiry was never held, and the Commonwealth increased support for the anti-terrorism activities of the intelligence services.

==Accusations of conspiracy==
It has been asserted that there were a number of unusual circumstances, namely:
* At the 1983 Walsh Coronial Inquest, it was stated by Terry Griffiths and others that there was a continuous police presence outside the building since the previous morning. This may have prevented anyone placing a large bomb into the rubbish bin while the police were there.
* The 1995 ABC documentary &quot;Conspiracy&quot; showed the driver of the garbage truck, Bill Ebb, claiming that the bins would normally be emptied several times each day, but police had prevented three earlier trucks from emptying the bin that contained the bomb, even though it was overflowing with rubbish.
* In 1991, John Hatton said in parliament that the garbage bin had not been searched for bombs and that searching bins is normally a high priority, and is specified in New South Wales police permanent circular 135.
* Army dog handler Keith Burley said that his dogs could smell very small quantities of explosives, and were expected to be used for the event. Burley said they were unexpectedly called off a few days prior without explanation.
* The entire truck and all bomb fragments were dumped immediately afterwards, at an unrecorded location. This prevented forensic evidence, such as the type of explosive used, from being gathered. Hatton compared that to the detailed evidence retrieved from the Pan Am Flight 103 that exploded at 30,000 feet.
* In 1983, William Reeve-Parker provided a statutory declaration that an army officer had admitted planting the bomb by switching rubbish bins 24 hours earlier. Reeve-Parker denied knowledge of who the officer was, although he &quot;had helped his son&quot;. Reeve-Parker was never called as a witness at the coronial inquest.
* The officer-in-charge of police immediately after the bombing, Inspector Ian MacDonald, claimed there had been a cover-up.
* In 1995, Andrew Tink said that it had been alleged that former Attorney General of New South Wales Frank Walker and Federal Government Senator Gareth Evans had been told by a CSIRO scientist, that under pressure from ASIO they had made two fake bombs in the week prior to the bombing. The bombs were designed not to explode, but could do so in a garbage truck compactor.
* The principal private secretary of a federal senator was told that the bomb squad was waiting nearby at this early hour of the morning. Barry Hall QC said that this would make it hard to claim that they were not involved. The government did not permit people from the bomb squad to be called as witnesses to the inquest.
* Sgt Horton stated that he saw an occurrence pad entry, that showed the warning call was received at 12:32, 8 minutes before the bomb exploded. It was not relayed instantly to the police out front. At the inquest, four other versions of this pad were shown, each timing the call at 12:40.

Many of these issues were identified by Terry Griffiths, a former policeman who was seriously injured in the bombing, who had called for an inquiry. In 1995, Peter Collins, NSW Attorney General 1991–1992, said &quot;The Hilton Bombing is a history of half truths, a litany of lies&quot;. In 1995, Barry Hall QC, counsel for Griffiths, argued that ASIO may well have planted the bomb in order to justify their existence.

The 1982 Walsh inquest was terminated prematurely, due to the finding of a prima facie case of murder.

==Arguments against a conspiracy==

The then Indian prime minister Morarji Desai claimed that the Ananda Marga organisation had attempted to kill him, due to the imprisonment of the organisation&#x27;s spiritual leader, Shrii Shrii Anandamurti. There had been other alleged attacks by Ananda Marga. On 15 September 1977, the military attaché at the Indian High Commission, Canberra, Colonel Singh and his wife, were attacked in Canberra. Just over a month later an Air India employee in Melbourne was stabbed. ASIO had infiltrated the Ananda Marga from 1976, and were monitoring it.

In 1998, Ben Hills wrote an article called &quot;The Hilton Fiasco&quot;, published in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. He argued that members of Ananda Marga were responsible for the Hilton bombing, saying that Evan Pederick was recruited for the bombing by Tim Anderson, while a man called Abhiik Kumar was the likely mastermind. He asserted that ASIO had information which would have helped in the police investigation, but withheld it.

In the 2016 publication, &quot;Who Bombed the Hilton?&quot;, film-maker Rachel Landers addressed the accusation that the bins outside the Hilton were left unemptied, with a bomb secreted inside one of them, as part of a conspiracy by Australian police or security agencies. Landers asserts: &quot;An enormous number of people are free to shove any number of objects (including an enormous placard) into the bin, lean on it or use it as a convenient seat over a very long period of time. For the conspiracists to be correct, the following have to be lying in their statements: seven garbage men (including a street sweeper), an accountant, two hippies, a sign-writer, a father of two out for the day with his kids, an anarchist and the Hilton commissionaire. They also have to be colluding with each other, the police who have been told to wave away garbage trucks and, one assumes, ASIO and their mates at Special Branch.&quot;

Landers also drew attention to the activities of Abhiik Kumar. She maintained that Kumar had been in almost every country where there was a threat, an attack or cases of Margis being arrested for violence against an Indian national. This included Kumar being in Sydney the day before the Hilton bombing.

In 2019 book, &quot;The Hilton Bombing: Evan Pederick and the Ananda Marga&quot;, Imre Salusinszky argued that &quot;not a single shred of evidence has emerged to support any of the conspiracy theories about the Hilton bombing.&quot; He said &quot;the official cover-up, if indeed there is one, has remained tight as a drum&quot;. Salusinszky gave a detailed account of Pederick&#x27;s involvement in Ananda Marga activities. This included planting the bomb outside the Hilton and then going to Brisbane on the same day. He covered in detail Pederick&#x27;s decision to confess to a Catholic priest after eleven years of guilt and torment.

==Trials and Investigations==

A few days after the bombing, Richard Seary offered his services to the police Special Branch as an informant. He expressed the view that the Ananda Marga society might be involved with the Hilton bombing. He soon infiltrated that organization, which had its headquarters in three adjacent houses in Queen Street, Newtown.

On 15 June 1978, Seary told Special Branch that members of Ananda Marga intended to bomb the home of Robert Cameron, a member of the far-right National Front of Australia, that night at his home in the Sydney suburb of Yagoona. Two members of the society — Ross Dunn and Paul Alister — were subsequently apprehended at Yagoona in Seary&#x27;s company and charged with conspiracy to murder Robert Cameron.

It was alleged that Dunn and Alister had intended to plant a bomb at Cameron&#x27;s home. Dunn and Alister stated that they intended only to write graffiti at Cameron&#x27;s home and had no knowledge of the bomb, which they claimed had been brought by Seary. Seary having already given discredited evidence accusing Dunn and Alister at the initial Hilton bombing inquest, was considered an unreliable witness in the written judgement of the High Court in &quot;Alister v R&quot; (1984):
However, there was also some police evidence, and the prosecution had strongly associated the matter with the Sydney Hilton bombing. The trial relating to the alleged plot to bomb Cameron&#x27;s home began in February 1979, but the jury could not come to a verdict. A second trial was held in July, and all three defendants were convicted.

In 1982, a coronial inquest into the bombing was held. Stipendiary Magistrate Walsh found a prima facie case of murder against two members of Ananda Marga—Ross Dunn and Paul Alister, but not Tim Anderson—based on evidence from Richard Seary, which was later discredited.

Coronial inquiries are limited in their scope. No person appearing before the coroner has a right to subpoena evidence without permission from the coroner, and in this inquest Walsh rejected all applications.

In 1984, the Attorney-General, Paul Landa, established an inquiry to investigate the convictions of Dunn, Alister and Anderson. The inquiry was similar to a Royal Commission, and was headed by Justice Wood. Richard Seary was in England at the time and did not take part, but after the inquiry indicated that he was willing to take part. Justice Wood reconvened the inquiry and it ran through to February 1985. The result was that Justice Wood recommended the pardoning of the three, and they were released in 1985. 

The inquiry did not directly cover the Hilton Bombing. The pardoned trio received compensation from the NSW Government. Alister ploughed his compensation money into land on Bridge Creek Road near Maleny, Queensland, which became his home, and the site of the Ananda Marga River School.

According to Paul Alister&#x27;s later assertions, points that emerged during the inquiry included:
* Tapes of conversations between Richard Seary and his Special Branch contact showed that Seary had originally suggested that the Hare Krishna group might have been responsible for the Hilton bombing
* Police ignored the Hare Krishna suggestion and told Seary to spy on Ananda Marga.
* Seary infiltrated Ananda Marga one month later than he had originally stated in court.
* Seary knew how to obtain explosives illegally, although he had said in court that he did not.
* Seary had told police about the alleged Cameron bombing plan five days earlier than he originally stated.
* Dr Emanuel Fischer, who had done a psychiatric assessment of Seary, said he was schizoid and psychopathic.
* Seary&#x27;s girlfriend Wendy, said that Seary had told her that he had thought they were going to Robert Cameron&#x27;s house to put up posters, and he had been surprised that explosives were brought along.
* Wendy said that Seary had not volunteered to spy on Ananda Marga, but had been pressured by the police.
* Seary&#x27;s friend Dok said that Seary had a plan to bomb an abattoir when he had been in the Hare Krishnas.

Paul Alister later speculated about Richard Seary&#x27;s motives, saying he was a &quot;wild card&quot; because he seemed to have his own agenda. He stated that Seary seemed to have a mixture of motives for what he said, and seemed to dislike the police. Seary&#x27;s girlfriend indicated that Seary had been pressured by the police to find evidence that incriminated the &quot;Margiis&quot;. Alister and his colleagues speculated that perhaps Seary was being blackmailed into informing, because of his former activity as a drug addict. Seary had also been present when someone had died of a drug overdose. This may have given the police leverage over him, because he could be charged.

In 1989, Anderson was re-arrested for the Sydney Hilton bombing, tried, convicted and sentenced to fourteen years. The crown prosecutor was Mark Tedeschi QC. Anderson was acquitted in 1991 by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, which held that the verdicts of guilty were unsafe and unsatisfactory. 

Chief Justice Gleeson concluded:
Instead of ordering a new trial, the Court entered a judgement of acquittal.

Pederick confessed to the bombing and so was convicted without detailed scrutiny of his confession. However, in the Anderson appeal, Chief Justice Gleeson said Pederick&#x27;s account of the bombing was &quot;clearly unreliable&quot;. He found: &quot;On any view of the matter, his account of the events of 12 February 1978, and in particular of the circumstances relating to his actual attempt at assassination, is clearly unreliable. He is incapable of giving a description of those events which does not involve serious error.&quot; 

Questions about Pederick&#x27;s sanity were raised in the Anderson appeal. Gleeson criticised the trial judge&#x27;s directions to the jury that Pederick must be assumed to be &quot;sane&quot;. He described Pederick as &quot;a witness who said that on a particular occasion he stood in George Street in Sydney and tried to blow up the Prime Minister of India, the Prime Minister of Australia, and a number of other people besides, and, when his attempt was unsuccessful, attributed its failure to the supernatural intervention of his guru&quot;. The Chief Justice added: &quot;He seems to have been a person whose reasoning processes were somewhat unorthodox. There was a significant danger of confusing the jurors by telling them that the law presumed him to be sane&quot;.

Pederick unsuccessfully appealed his conviction in 1996, the year before his release. The appeal was rejected when he produced no evidence to explain why his original confession had been false. Pederick was released after serving eight years in jail and stated: &quot;I guess I was quite unique in the prison system in that I had to keep proving my guilt, whereas everyone else said they were innocent.&quot;

The two failed prosecutions against Tim Anderson and his friends have been cited as instances of Australian miscarriages of justice. For example, in Kerry Carrington&#x27;s 1991 book &quot;Travesty! Miscarriages of Justice&quot;, and in other law texts, including notes on compensation practice.

A plaque was unveiled at the site of the explosion in George Street on 13 February 2008, the 30th anniversary of the blast.

The then-Premier of New South Wales, Morris Iemma, commended the City of Sydney Council for restoring the memorial plaque to its original home, and said he hoped there will never be a need for another.

<text>Expedition 10 (2004–2005) was the tenth expedition to the International Space Station, using the Soyuz TMA-5, which stayed during the expedition for emergency evacuation.

==Crew==
==Mission parameters==
*Perigee: 384 km
*Apogee: 396 km
*Inclination: 51.6°
*Orbital period: 92 min

==Mission objectives==

Chiao and Sharipov docked at the Space Station on 16 October 2004 aboard Soyuz TMA-5, to relieve Expedition 9 crewmates Mike Fincke and Gennady Padalka. Chiao was the expedition commander and NASA science officer, and Sharipov was the Soyuz commander and flight engineer. Both Astronauts were researchers in the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity Project.

Notable accomplishments included replacing critical hardware in the Quest Joint Airlock; repairing U.S. spacesuits; and submitting a scientific research paper on ultrasound use in space. Chiao was also the first astronaut to vote in a U.S. Presidential election from space.

== Notable events ==
The launch of Expedition 10 was rescheduled. During preflight testing, an explosive bolt was accidentally activated on the Soyuz TMA-5 spacecraft. The resulting damage caused was repaired and the mission launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 14 October 2004.

During the Expedition 10 mission, two Progress supply spacecraft docked with the International Space Station. The first (Progress 51) docked on 25 December 2004 followed by the second (Progress 52) on 28 February 2005.

European Space Agency Astronaut Roberto Vittori of Italy launched to the Station with the Expedition 11 crew and spent eight days onboard performing scientific experiments. Vittori returned to Earth with the Expedition 10 crew. He was aboard under a contract between ESA and the Russian Federal Space Agency.

The re-entry of the Soyuz TMA-5 spacecraft was perfect, returning the astronauts to Earth 53 miles northeast of the town of Arkalyk after 192 days, 19 hours and 2 minutes in space. The recovery team reached the capsule in minutes.

== Crew ==
Chiao is a veteran of three Space Shuttle flights, and spent 13 hours on two spacewalks in 2000 as part of a construction mission at the Station. Sharipov has logged over 211 hours in space. He served as a mission specialist on the Shuttle during the eighth Shuttle-Mir docking mission in 1998.

==Spacewalks==
The Expedition 10 crew completed two spacewalks, including experiment installation and tasks to prepare the Station for the arrival of the new European Automated Transfer Vehicle in 2006. Instead, the Automated Transfer Vehicle came in 2008.
The first spacewalk took place on 26 January 2005 and the second on 28 March 2005.

<doc id="881833" wikidata="Q1316690" url="?curid=881833" title="Women's 100 metres world record progression">
<text>The first world record in the 100 metres sprint for women was recognised by the Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale (FSFI) in 1922. The FSFI was absorbed by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) in 1936. The current record is 10.49 seconds set by Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988.

To June 21, 2009, the IAAF (and the FSFI before it) have ratified 43 world records in the event.

==Records 1922–1976==
The &quot;Wind&quot; column in the table below indicates the wind assistance in metres per second. 2.0 m/s is the current maximum allowable, and a negative value indicates that the mark was set against a headwind. the &quot;Auto&quot; column indicates a fully automatic time that was also recorded in the event when hand-timed marks were used for official records, or which was the basis for the official mark, rounded to the 10th or 100th of a second, depending on the rules then in place. A &quot;y&quot; indicates a distance measured in yards and ratified as a world record in this event.

==Records from 1975==
From 1975, the IAAF accepted separate automatically electronically timed records for events up to 400 metres. Starting January 1, 1977, the IAAF required fully automatic timing to the hundredth of a second for these events.

Wyomia Tyus&#x27;s 1968 Olympic gold medal performance and Renate Stecher&#x27;s 1972 Olympic championship win, both in 11.07, were the fastest recorded fully electronic 100-metre races to that time and were ratified as world records. However, Tyus&#x27;s 11.07 was later adjusted to 11.08.

*There is controversy over Griffith-Joyner&#x27;s world record as questions have been raised as to whether the wind actually was zero, as indicated by the trackside anemometer. The triple-jump anemometer, some 10 metres away, read 4.3 m/s, more than double the acceptable limit. Despite the controversy, the record was ratified by the IAAF. 

Had this mark been ignored, the progression would have continued as follows:

<doc id="881837" wikidata="Q1384866" url="?curid=881837" title="E. C. George Sudarshan">
<text>Ennackal Chandy George Sudarshan (also known as E. C. G. Sudarshan; 16 September 1931 – 13 May 2018) was an Indian American theoretical physicist and a professor at the University of Texas. Prof.Sudarshan has been credited with numerous contributions to the field of theoretical physics, including Glauber–Sudarshan P representation, V-A theory, tachyons, quantum Zeno effect, open quantum system and quantum master equations, spin–statistics theorem, non-invariance groups, positive maps of density matrices, and quantum computation.

==Early life==
Ennackal Chandy George Sudarshan was born in Pallom, Kottayam, Travancore, British India. He was raised in a Syrian Christian family, but later left the religion and converted to Hinduism following his marriage. He married Lalita Rau on December 20, 1954, and they have three sons, Alexander, Arvind (deceased) and Ashok. George and Lalita were divorced in 1990 and he married Bhamathi Gopalakrishnan in Austin, Texas.

He studied at CMS College Kottayam, and graduated with honors from the Madras Christian College in 1951. He obtained his master&#x27;s degree at the University of Madras in 1952. He moved to Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and worked there for a brief period with Dr. Homi Bhabha as well as others. Subsequently, he moved to University of Rochester in New York to work under Prof. Robert Marshak as a graduate student. In 1958, he received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Rochester. At this point he moved to Harvard University to join Prof. Julian Schwinger as a postdoctoral fellow.

==Career==
Dr. Sudarshan made significant contributions to several areas of physics. He was the originator (with Robert Marshak) of the V-A theory of the weak force (later propagated by Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann), which eventually paved the way for the electroweak theory. Feynman acknowledged Sudarshan&#x27;s contribution in 1963 stating that the V-A theory was discovered by Sudarshan and Marshak and publicized by Gell-Mann and himself. He also developed a quantum representation of coherent light later known as Glauber–Sudarshan representation (for which controversially Glauber was awarded the 2005 Nobel prize in Physics ignoring Sudarshan&#x27;s contributions).

Sudarshan&#x27;s most significant work may have been his contribution to the field of quantum optics. His theorem proves the equivalence of classical wave optics to quantum optics. The theorem makes use of the Sudarshan representation. This representation also predicts optical effects that are purely quantum, and cannot be explained classically. Sudarshan was also an advocate for the existence of tachyons, particles that travel faster than light. He developed a fundamental formalism called dynamical maps to study the theory of open quantum system. He, in collaboration with Baidyanath Misra, also proposed the quantum Zeno effect.

Sudarshan and collaborators initiated the &quot;Quantum theory of charged-particle beam optics&quot;, by working out the focusing action of a magnetic quadrupole using the Dirac equation.

He taught at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), University of Rochester, Syracuse University, and Harvard. From 1969 onwards, he was a professor of physics at the University of Texas at Austin and a senior professor at the Indian Institute of Science. He worked as the director of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc), Chennai, India, for five years during the 1980s dividing his time between India and USA. During his tenure, he transformed it into a centre of excellence. He also met and held many discussions with philosopher J. Krishnamurti. He was felicitated on his 80th birthday, at IMSc Chennai on 16 September 2011. His areas of interest included elementary particle physics, quantum optics, quantum information, quantum field theory, gauge field theories, classical mechanics and foundations of physics. He was also deeply interested in Vedanta, on which he lectured frequently.

==Controversy regarding Nobel Prize==
Sudarshan began working on quantum optics at the University of Rochester in 1960. Two years later, Glauber criticized the use of classical electromagnetic theory in explaining optical fields, which surprised Sudarshan because he believed the theory provided accurate explanations. Sudarshan subsequently wrote a paper expressing his ideas and sent a preprint to Glauber. Glauber informed Sudarshan of similar results and asked to be acknowledged in the latter&#x27;s paper, while criticizing Sudarshan in his own paper. &quot;Glauber criticized Sudarshan&#x27;s representation, but his own was unable to generate any of the typical quantum optics phenomena, hence he introduces what he calls a P-representation, which was Sudarshan&#x27;s representation by another name&quot;, wrote a physicist. &quot;This representation, which had at first been scorned by Glauber, later becomes known as the Glauber–Sudarshan representation.&quot;

Sudarshan was passed over for the Physics Nobel Prize on more than one occasion, leading to controversy in 2005 when several physicists wrote to the Swedish Academy, protesting that Sudarshan should have been awarded a share of the Prize for the Sudarshan diagonal representation (also known as Glauber–Sudarshan representation) in quantum optics, for which Roy J. Glauber won his share of the prize. Sudarshan and other physicists sent a letter to the Nobel Committee claiming that the P representation had more contributions of &quot;Sudarshan&quot; than &quot;Glauber&quot;. The letter goes on to say that Glauber criticized Sudarshan&#x27;s theory—before renaming it the &quot;P representation&quot; and incorporating it into his own work. In an unpublished letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Sudarshan calls the &quot;Glauber–Sudarshan representation&quot; a misnomer, adding that &quot;literally all subsequent theoretic developments in the field of Quantum Optics make use of&quot; Sudarshan&#x27;s work— essentially, asserting that he had developed the breakthrough.

In 2007, Prof.Sudarshan told the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, &quot;The 2005 Nobel prize for Physics was awarded for my work, but I wasn&#x27;t the one to get it. Each one of the discoveries that this Nobel was given for work based on my research.&quot; Sudarshan also commented on not being selected for the 1979 Nobel, &quot;Steven Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow and Abdus Salam built on work I had done as a 26-year-old student. If you give a prize for a building, shouldn&#x27;t the fellow who built the first floor be given the prize before those who built the second floor?&quot;

<text>Bathocyroe fosteri is a species of lobate ctenophore found at intermediate depths in all the world&#x27;s oceans. The species is very common and abundant near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It is bioluminescent, and is typically observed hanging motionlessly in an upright or inverted posture although it can flap its oral lobes to swim. This deep-sea comb jelly is named for Alvin (DSV-2) pilot Dudley Foster, who collected the first specimens.

== Description ==
&quot;Bathocyroe fosteri&quot; is mostly transparent with red pigmented inner gut walls. It has short comb rows and measures 2–4 cm across the oral lobes. These oral lobes are used to contain prey until they are drawn into the gut with its tentacles.

<doc id="881842" wikidata="Q665892" url="?curid=881842" title="Aristeia">
<text>An aristeia or aristia (; , &quot;excellence&quot;) is a scene in the dramatic conventions of epic poetry as in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, where a hero in battle has his finest moments (&quot;aristos&quot; = &quot;best&quot;). &quot;Aristeia&quot; may result in the death of the hero, and therefore suggests a &quot;battle in which he reaches his peak as a fighter and hero&quot;.

==Historical background==
In the pre-hoplite phase of Greek military evolution, the well-armed aristocrat was the major focus of military action, placed at the apex of his less well-armed dependants. This was reflected in the Homeric division between nobility and commoners, and in the regular epic struggles over the armour of the former, once fallen in their aristeia.

Classical hoplite armies, though very different, nevertheless still awarded prizes (aristeia) for individual excellence in action.

==Epic examples==
Literally, &quot;moment of excellence&quot;, &quot;aristeiai&quot; often coincide with battleground slaughter, and feature one warrior who dominates the battle. 

*Aristeiai abound in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, the peak being Achilles&#x27; &quot;aristeia&quot; in Books 20–22 where he almost single-handedly routs the Trojan army and then goes on to kill its champion Hector. Achilles&#x27; &quot;extended and phenomenal solo performances in battle&quot; are shown in the epic&#x27;s &quot;longest and most murderous&quot; series of events. Other instances of this phenomenon in the &quot;Iliad&quot; are found in Diomedes&#x27; &quot;preeminent deeds&quot; in battle while empowered by Athena (Books 5 and 6, the longest after Achilles&#x27; from Book 20–22), Hector&#x27;s leading of the Trojan assault on the Achaian camp in Book 8 (with the help of Zeus), Agamemnon&#x27;s &quot;aristeia&quot; in Book 11 where his rampage prompts Zeus to warn Hector against meeting him in battle, as well as Patroclus&#x27; &quot;aristeia&quot; in Book 16, which ultimately leads to his demise at the hands of Hector. Book 16 illustrates how &quot;aristeiai&quot; often fit into the &quot;epic overextension&quot; of battles: the arming of the warriors, the march into battle, the initial clash, the intense exchanges, and the retreat of one of the armies—often leading to a hero&#x27;s opportunity for his &quot;aristeia&quot;.

*In Book 22 of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Greek hero Odysseus slaughters all of the suitors in his palace in another homeric display of martial excellence. &quot;Aristeia&quot; also suggests the qualities of the hero that make his great deeds possible, such as Odysseus&#x27; &quot;polymetis&quot; (&quot;cunning intelligence&quot;) that allows him to triumph over the Cyclops Polyphemus in Book 9 of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

*&quot;Aristeia&quot; is also seen, to some extent, in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, when Nisus and Euryalus leave the Trojan defences in Book 9 to slaughter the Latin captains while they sleep. It also features in Book 10, when Mezentius takes the place of Turnus and strikes down all in his path: it draws upon Homeric models, using a simile. Camilla also has an &quot;aristeia&quot; in Book 11 killing twelve opponents, but ends with her death.

*In Paradise Lost, Books V and VI see the most individual moments of battlefield domination (aristeia), associated with (for example) the figure of Abdiel.

==Recent examples==
In the film &quot;300&quot;, individual Spartan deaths are often portrayed as a Homeric aristeia.

<doc id="881855" wikidata="Q2386582" url="?curid=881855" title="Digory Kirke">
<text>Professor Digory Kirke is a fictional character from C. S. Lewis&#x27; fantasy series &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia.&quot; He appears in three of the seven books: &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;, and &quot;The Last Battle&quot;.

In the 2005 film &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, he is portrayed (as an adult) by Jim Broadbent.

==Character biography==
===&quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;===
Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie stay with the character, referred to in this book only as &quot;the Professor&quot;, at his great house in the country to escape the Blitz. A wardrobe in this house leads Lucy to Narnia; when her siblings do not believe her story, the Professor speaks to them wisely and shows them that she is logically likely to be telling the truth. At the end of the story, he reassures the children that they will return to Narnia one day.

===&quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;===
The Professor is mentioned only briefly and in passing, but it is here that his surname, Kirke, is first used.

===&quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;===
Digory Kirke is a young boy who lives in Victorian London with his Uncle Andrew and Andrew&#x27;s sister Aunt Letty, because his father is in India and his mother is deathly ill. Uncle Andrew has made magic rings that allow whoever wears them to travel to other worlds by passing through the Wood between the Worlds. He first tricks Digory&#x27;s friend Polly Plummer into trying one; when she vanishes, he manipulates Digory into following her with another ring in order to bring her back. Reunited with Polly, and finding that they can return to London through the pool from which they emerged into the Wood, Digory persuades Polly to try one of the many other pools.

They find themselves in a lifeless world called Charn, over which a dying red sun hangs. They find a great hall full of wax figures, and a golden bell. Against Polly&#x27;s vehement opposition, Digory rings the bell, thus waking Queen Jadis, the last living resident of Charn, from her self-imposed enchanted sleep. Despite their attempts to shake her, Jadis follows Digory and Polly back to London, intent on conquest, where she causes havoc for an afternoon. Digory resolves to take her back to Charn, but instead accidentally brings her (and Uncle Andrew and others) into the empty world of Narnia shortly before Aslan starts creating it. Once the world is created, Jadis flees from Aslan, who sends Digory to a mysterious locked garden in the far west to retrieve an apple which, once planted, will grow a tree that will lock Jadis out of Narnia for centuries; it also has the power to cure sickness and grant immortality.

After Digory&#x27;s long journey by flying horse, he arrives with Polly to find Jadis already there. Jadis tempts Digory to eat his apple himself and take another to save his ill mother. Digory, after a struggle of conscience, takes the apple to Aslan and plants it as instructed. With Aslan&#x27;s permission and blessing, Digory is allowed to take an apple from this tree back to his world to cure his mother. He plants the core in his garden, from which a new tree grows. Years later this tree is blown down by a storm and Digory uses its wood to build the wardrobe that becomes the portal to Narnia in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;.

===&quot;The Last Battle&quot;===
Prior to the events of the book, the now elderly Digory and Polly have been regularly meeting with the child protagonists of the other books in the series (excepting Susan) to reminisce about their adventures in Narnia. After the titular battle, they all meet again in the renewed Narnia in Aslan&#x27;s Country. At the end of the book it is revealed that they have all been killed in a railway accident and are now in an eternal blessed afterlife.

<text>Anhydrite, or anhydrous calcium sulfate, is a mineral with the chemical formula CaSO4. It is in the orthorhombic crystal system, with three directions of perfect cleavage parallel to the three planes of symmetry. It is not isomorphous with the orthorhombic barium (baryte) and strontium (celestine) sulfates, as might be expected from the chemical formulas. Distinctly developed crystals are somewhat rare, the mineral usually presenting the form of cleavage masses. The Mohs hardness is 3.5, and the specific gravity is 2.9. The color is white, sometimes greyish, bluish, or purple. On the best developed of the three cleavages, the lustre is pearly; on other surfaces it is glassy. When exposed to water, anhydrite readily transforms to the more commonly occurring gypsum, (CaSO4·2H2O) by the absorption of water. This transformation is reversible, with gypsum or calcium sulfate hemihydrate forming anhydrite by heating to around under normal atmospheric conditions. Anhydrite is commonly associated with calcite, halite, and sulfides such as galena, chalcopyrite, molybdenite, and pyrite in vein deposits.

==Occurrence==

Anhydrite is most frequently found in evaporite deposits with gypsum; it was, for instance, first discovered in 1794 in a salt mine near Hall in Tirol. In this occurrence, depth is critical since nearer the surface anhydrite has been altered to gypsum by absorption of circulating ground water.

From an aqueous solution, calcium sulfate is deposited as crystals of gypsum, but when the solution contains an excess of sodium or potassium chloride, anhydrite is deposited if the temperature is above . This is one method by which the mineral has been prepared artificially and is identical with its mode of origin in nature. The mineral is common in salt basins.

===Tidal flat nodules===
Anhydrite occurs in a tidal flat environment in the Persian Gulf sabkhas as massive diagenetic replacement nodules. Cross sections of these nodular masses have a netted appearance and have been referred to as &quot;chicken-wire anhydrite&quot;. Nodular anhydrite occurs as replacement of gypsum in a variety of sedimentary depositional environments.

===Salt dome cap rocks===
Massive amounts of anhydrite occur when salt domes form a caprock. Anhydrite is 1–3% of the minerals in salt domes and is generally left as a cap at the top of the salt when the halite is removed by pore waters. The typical cap rock is a salt, topped by a layer of anhydrite, topped by patches of gypsum, topped by a layer of calcite. Interaction of anhydrite with hydrocarbons at high temperature in oil fields can reduce sulfate () into hydrogen sulfide (H2S) with a concomitant precipitation of calcite. The process is known as thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR).
===Igneous rocks===
Anhydrite has been found in some igneous rocks, for example in the intrusive dioritic pluton of El Teniente, Chile and in trachyandesite pumice erupted by El Chichón volcano, Mexico.

==Naming history==
The name anhydrite was given by A. G. Werner in 1804, because of the absence of water of crystallization, as contrasted with the presence of water in gypsum. Some obsolete names for the species are muriacite and karstenite; the former, an earlier name, being given under the impression that the substance was a chloride (muriate). A peculiar variety occurring as contorted concretionary masses is known as tripe-stone, and a scaly granular variety, from Volpino, near Bergamo, in Lombardy, as vulpinite; the latter is cut and polished for ornamental purposes.

A semi-transparent light blue-grey variety from Peru is referred to by the trade name &quot;angelite&quot;.

==Other uses==

The Catalyst Science Discovery Centre in Widnes, England, has a relief carving of an anhydrite kiln, made from a piece of anhydrite, for the United Sulphuric Acid Corporation.

Extensive structural damage in the German city of Staufen im Breisgau has occurred since a 2007 geothermal drilling project allowed subsurface water to invade a layer of anhydrite below the city, causing extensive but uneven ground swelling as pockets of the anhydrite converted to gypsum.

<doc id="881863" wikidata="Q818982" url="?curid=881863" title="Berek Joselewicz">
<text>Berek Joselewicz (17 September 1764 – 15 May 1809) was a Polish Jewish colonel of the Polish Army during the Kościuszko Uprising. Joselewicz commanded the first Jewish military formation in modern history excluding Prince Potemkin&#x27;s Israelovsky Regiment. He was also a merchant and financial agent of the Polish magnate Prince Massalski.

==Early life==
Dow Baer (Berek) Joselewicz was born in Kretinga, in the Duchy of Samogitia of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, a member country of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He worked as a financial agent for a local Lithuanian magnate, the Lord of Kretinga and Bishop of Vilnius Prince Massalski. Joselewicz often travelled abroad in pursuit of various tasks, during which he learned to speak French. He spent some time in Paris during the beginning of the French Revolution, and it is thought that this may have later inspired him to join Tadeusz Kościuszko, who advocated similar causes of brotherhood and equality.

== Kościuszko Uprising ==
Joselewicz initially served in the militia before petitioning Kościuszko for permission to form an all-Jewish unit. On 17 September 1794 Kościuszko officially announced the creation of the unit. Joselewicz, along with another Jew named Józef Aronowicz, issued a patriotic call-to-arms in Yiddish denouncing Russia and Prussia, eliciting hundreds of volunteers, mostly poor trade workers and artisans. Five hundred men were eventually accepted and formed into a cavalry regiment (). At Joselewicz&#x27;s request, they were allowed to keep their religious customs, including access to kosher foods, abstaining from combat on the Sabbath when possible, and growing their beards. Joselewicz&#x27;s unit was popularly known as &quot;the Beardlings&quot;. They took part in the Battle of Praga, in which the unit was wiped out, with only a few men (including Joselewicz) surviving the battle. Joselewicz himself was taken prisoner by the Russians.

== Polish Legions ==
After the defeat of the Kościuszko Uprising, Joselewicz left for Galicia and then for Italy. There he joined the Polish Legions under Henryk Dąbrowski. As a commander of a sabre company in Polish cavalry units, he fought in various battles of the Napoleonic Wars period. Among them were the battles of Trebbia, Novi, Hohenlinden, Austerlitz and Friedland. 
== Army of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw ==
He remained in the army as a squadron leader in the following the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807. From 1807 he fought in various battles in Poland.

=== Austro-Polish War ===
He was killed in the Battle of Kock in 1809 during an encounter with a unit of Austrian hussars, and today his grave has become a popular tourist attraction.

== Legacy ==
The historical Polish proverb &quot;Perish like Berek at Kock&quot; (&quot;&quot;Zginął jak Berek pod Kockiem&quot;.&quot;) describes someone disappearing without a trace. Another historical folk song describes Berek: &quot;This was Berek, famous Jew, Man of duty, righteous Pole. Not with wine, not with swindle but with blood he paid for glory!&quot; Original text: &quot;Był to Berek, sławny Żyd, Człek sumienny – Polak prawy. Nie kwaterką – ni szacherką, Lecz się krwią dorobił sławy!&quot;.

He was honored by a postage stamp as &quot;A Jewish Fighter for Polish Freedom&quot;, issued jointly by Polish and Israeli postal services.

According to Derek Penslar, Berek was not a Polish patriot but rather &quot;an adventurer and activist&quot;.&quot;Berek was not so much a Polish patriot as an adventurer and activist who sought to enhance his own personal honor as well as that of the Jews under his command. Although Berek is most famous for his service for Poland, in 1796 he proposed to the Habsburg emperor the raising of a corps of six thousand to eight thousand Jews who would be divided into cavalry and infantry units to fight against the French.” There are streets named after him in many Polish towns including Warsaw, Kraków, Łódź, Częstochowa, Zawichost, Biłgoraj, Radomsko, Chrzanów, Będzin, Lubartów and Żarki. In Góra Kalwaria, the street is now called Firefighters Street.

==Awards==
He was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Virtuti Militari medal and the Legion of Honour with a Golden Cross for his merits.

== Family ==
Berek&#x27;s son, Józef Berkowicz (1789–1846), also fought in the Battle of Kock, and later served as a squadron chief during the November Uprising of 1830, during which he also attempted to convince Jewish soldiers to desert the Russian army and join the Poles. Berkowicz later moved to England and wrote a novel. Berek&#x27;s widow and son received a pension until 1831.

<text>George Herbert Hitchings (April 18, 1905 – February 27, 1998) was an American medical doctor who shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Sir James Black and Gertrude Elion &quot;for their discoveries of important principles for drug treatment&quot;, Hitchings specifically for his work on chemotherapy.

==Education and early life==
Hitchings was born in Hoquiam, Washington, in 1905, and grew up there, in Berkeley, California, San Diego, Bellingham, Washington, and Seattle. He graduated from Seattle&#x27;s Franklin High School, where he was salutatorian, in 1923, and from there went to the University of Washington, from which he graduated with a degree in chemistry &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1927, after having been elected to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior the year before. That summer, he worked at the university&#x27;s Puget Sound Biological Station at Friday Harbor on San Juan Island , and received a master&#x27;s degree the next year for his thesis based on that work.

From the University of Washington, Hitchings went to Harvard University as a teaching fellow, ending up at Harvard Medical School. Before getting his Ph.D. in 1933, he joined Alpha Chi Sigma in 1929.

==Career and research==
Following his PhD, he worked at Harvard and Case Western Reserve University. In 1942, he went to work for Wellcome Research Laboratories at Tuckahoe, where he began working with Gertrude Elion in 1944. Drugs Hitchings&#x27; team worked on included 2,6-diaminopurine (a compound to treat leukemia) and p-chlorophenoxy-2,4-diaminopyrimidine (a folic acid antagonist). According to his Nobel Prize autobiography,
:The line of inquiry we had begun in the 1940s [also] yielded new drug therapies for malaria (pyrimethamine), leukemia (6-mercaptopurine and thioguanine), gout (allopurinol), organ transplantation (azathioprine) and bacterial infections (co-trimoxazole (trimethoprimA)). The new knowledge contributed by our studies pointed the way for investigations that led to major antiviral drugs for herpes infections (acyclovir) and AIDS (zidovudine).

In 1967 Hitchings became vice president in Charge of Research of Burroughs-Wellcome. He became Scientist Emeritus in 1976. He also served as adjunct professor of pharmacology and of experimental medicine from 1970 to 1985 at Duke University.

Hitchings founded the Triangle Community Foundation in 1983. Hitchings is a member of the Medicinal Chemistry Hall of Fame.

== Personal life ==
His first wife, Beverly Reimer Hitchings, died in 1985. Hitchings remarried in 1989 to Joyce Carolyn Shaver-Hitchings, MD. Dr. Shaver-Hitchings died in 2009.

Hitchings died on 27 February 1998 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

==Awards and honors==
Hitchings was awarded the Passano award by the Passano Foundation in 1969, and the de Villiers award in 1970. In 1972, he was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1974. In 1989, Hitchings received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

<doc id="881866" wikidata="Q293923" url="?curid=881866" title="Jaguar AJ-V8 engine">
<text>The Jaguar AJ-V8 is a compact DOHC V8 piston engine used in many Jaguar vehicles. It was the fourth new engine type in the history of the company. It was an in house design with work beginning before Ford&#x27;s purchase of the company. In 1997 it replaced both designs previously available on Jaguar cars: the straight-6 Jaguar AJ6 engine (or rather its AJ16 variant), and the Jaguar V12 engine. It remained the only engine type available on Jaguar until 1999 with the launch of the S-Type, when the Jaguar AJ-V6 engine was added to the list. The AJ-V8 is available in displacements ranging from 3.2L to 5.0L, and a supercharged version is also produced. Ford Motor Company also used this engine in other cars, including the Lincoln LS and the 2002–2005 Ford Thunderbird, as well as in several Land Rovers, and the Aston Martin V8 Vantage.

The AJ-V8 was designed to use Nikasil-coated cylinders rather than the more-common iron cylinder liners. However, like the BMW M60, high-sulphur fuel reacted with the Nikasil coating and caused engine failures. Jaguar replaced affected engines, and has used conventional cast-iron linings ever since.

The engine originally used a two-state Variable Valve Timing system to switch the intake cam timing by 30°. Newer variants use a more sophisticated system which can vary intake timing incrementally up to 48°. The Lincoln version was made in the United States.

Other engine features include fracture-split forged powder metal connecting rods, a special one-piece cast camshaft, and reinforced plastic intake manifold.

The AJ-V8 was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 2000.

Ford ceased production of the AJ-V8 engine in September 2020 when it closed the Bridgend Plant. However, in August 2020 JLR was able to take over production means for the AJ-V8.

==Manufacture==
The AJ8 engine was manufactured in a dedicated Jaguar facility located within the Ford Bridgend Engine Plant in Bridgend, South Wales. The Jaguar &quot;plant-within-a-plant&quot; saved considerable investment costs by Jaguar. It was staffed by workers dedicated to Jaguar engine production and included a linked flow-line of computer numerically controlled machines with automated loading and assembly. Component supply was on a &quot;just-in-time&quot; basis.

Jaguar Land Rover has subsequently produced the AJ supercharged petrol V8 Jaguar Land Rover engines in a state-of-the-art Engine Manufacturing Centre in Wolverhampton.

== 4.0 L ==

The AJ26 engine was introduced in 1996. The number &quot;26&quot; comes from 12+6+8 (cylinders), because when the first ideas were sketched, a family of 6-, 8- and 12-cylinder engines was contemplated, although only the 8-cylinder version was produced. It has a square bore and stroke. It was updated in 1998 as the AJ27 with continuously variable valve timing. The AJ-V8 was updated again in 2000 as the AJ28. The naturally aspirated version produces in the 2000–2002 XK8.

== Aston Martin 4.3/4.7==
Aston Martin hand-assembles a special version of the AJ-V8 for the 2005 V8 Vantage known as AM05 – or while it was under development as AJ37. This unit displaced and produces at 7,000 rpm and at 5,000 rpm. This engine is unique to Aston Martin and features race-style dry-sump lubrication, which enables it to be mounted low to lower the centre of gravity. The firing order is the same as the other AJ-V8 engines although the cylinder numbering is different (AJ37 = 1-5-4-2-6-3-7-8 vs. AJ26 = 1-2-7-3-4-5-6-8). The engine is assembled by hand at the AM facility in Cologne, Germany, which also builds the V12 for the DB9 and Vanquish. The cylinder block, cylinder heads, crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, camshafts, inlet and exhaust manifolds, lubrication system and engine management are all unique to the Aston Martin version.

In May 2008, Aston Martin released a new design that used pressed cylinder liners instead of cast-in liners. This allowed for thinner liners, and a higher capacity of for the V8 Vantage. Called the AM14, power output increased to (an 11% increase on the previous 4.3-litre unit) and peak torque to (a 15% increase). The Aston Martin V8 Vantage S features the same 4.7-litre V8 engine found in the base Vantage, but with improved intake airflow, new mufflers, and new programming that keeps the exhaust system&#x27;s bypass valves open longer. The engine in the V8 Vantage S now develops at 7,300 rpm and torque of at 5,000 rpm representing an increase of and respectively. This engine is also used in the bespoke Aston Martin DB10 concept car for the 2015 James Bond film Spectre.

==AJ-V8 Gen III 5.0==
An all new direct injection 5.0 L engine family was introduced in 2009, for the 2010 model year. The AJ133 is a 90° V8 engine available in either supercharged or naturally aspirated form, with a bore &amp; stroke of and a compression ratio of 9.5:1 for the supercharged version and 11.5:1 for the naturally aspirated one respectively. 

The main structural components of the engine are all manufactured from aluminium alloy. The engine is built around a very stiff, lightweight, enclosed V, deep skirt cylinder block, with an open-deck design. A structural windage tray is bolted to the bottom of the cylinder block to further improve the block stiffness, minimize NVH (noise, vibration and harshness) and help reduce oil foaming. To further enhance the stiffness of the lower engine structure, a heavily ribbed sump body is installed. The sump body also helps to reduce engine noise. 

A spheroidal graphite cast-iron crankshaft is utilized with high-strength cast pistons and fracture-split forged steel connecting rods manufactured from 36 Mn VS4 steel.

The engine uses a Bosch high pressure direct injection fuel system with fuel pressure provided by two, cam driven high pressure pumps which are driven by a dedicated camshaft. The high pressure pumps supply the fuel rails which in turn supply the four injectors for that bank with fuel at a controlled pressure.

The four camshafts incorporate VCT (variable camshaft timing). VCT allows the timing of the intake and exhaust valves to be adjusted independently of each other. 

The naturally aspirated engine features cam profile switching and variable tract length inlet manifold. 

Supercharged engines make use of a sixth-generation 1.9L TVS (Twin Vortices Series) supercharger, which is located in the &#x27;vee&#x27; of the engine and is driven from the crankshaft by a dedicated secondary drive belt.

Denso&#x27;s Generation 1.6 Engine Management System was used on earlier models, later switching to Bosch&#x27;s MED17 engine management 2013+ (except for the XKR and XKR-S).

The direct fuel injection system, advanced piston and combustion chamber design and the supercharger provide improved fuel consumption and emissions, as these engines meet EU5 emission regulations in Europe and Rest of World (ROW) and ULEV 70 emission regulations in North American Specification (NAS) markets.

The naturally aspirated engine was replaced by the AJ126 supercharged V6 engine starting for the 2013 model year. It has since been replaced by the all-new Ingenium turbocharged inline-6 engine.

As of December 2024, Jaguar has discontinued most of its internal combustion engine (ICE) models, including those featuring the AJ133S, as part of its transition to an all-electric lineup by 2025. The 2024 Land Rover Defender V8 is the final vehicle to use the AJ133S engine. For the 2025.5 model year, it was joined in Defender by BMW’s 4.4L N63 twin-turbo V8 in the Octa derivative, (NC11 had already been introduced in the 2022 Range Rover and 2023 Range Rover Sport). 

===AJ133===
Land Rover version is called &#x27;LR-V8 Petrol engine&#x27;.

===AJ133S===
The AJ133S is the supercharged variant of the AJ133, featuring an Eaton TVS1900R supercharger. It incorporates twin water-to-air intercoolers and a front-mount heat exchanger, with a shared cooling circuit. Differences over the naturally aspirated engine include; flat-top pistons for a lower compression ratio (9.5:1 vs 11.5:1), piston-oil spray jets, and different intake camshafts without cam-profile switching capabilities. 

All AJ133S engines utilize the same supercharger pulley setup, capable of producing approximately 15PSI of boost. Differences in ECU calibrations determine the final power output.

The Bowler Nemesis and David Brown Speedback Silverstone Edition also use a variant of this engine producing .
===Model year changes===
Over its production span, the AJ133/S underwent several modifications to enhance performance, reliability, and compliance with evolving emission standards. Key changes by model year include:

2010:
*Equipped with 10.5mm cylinder head bolts.
*Utilized a Tsubaki timing chain with a 6.35mm pitch (except for X351 XJ and Land Rover models, which used an 8mm pitch chain from INA).
*Featured Denso engine management.
*Employed a vacuum-actuated supercharger bypass valve.
*Supercharged variants had aluminum coolant crossover pipes.

2011:
*All AJ133 variants transitioned to an INA timing chain with an 8mm pitch for MY2012 vehicles.
*Introduced redesigned timing chain guides and tensioners.
*Switched to plastic coolant crossover pipes for supercharged models.

2013 (excluding XKR &amp; XKR-S):
*Upgraded to 11mm cylinder head bolts.
*Adopted Bosch MED17 engine management.
*Implemented an electric supercharger bypass valve.
*Added an eco-start-stop starter motor.
*Updated air box assemblies, mass air flow (MAF) sensors, and throttle body.

2014:
*Further redesigned timing chain guides, incorporating an added steel button for MY2015 vehicles.
*Introduced new timing chain tensioners.

2021 (specific to F-Pace SVR &amp; F-Type P450/P575):
*Removed the mechanical vacuum pump, replacing it with a blanking plate.

2024:
*Updated the coolant crossover pipes to aluminum in MY24 Defender and Jaguar F-Pace SVR vehicles. LR186859 &amp; LR186917.

These updates aimed to address known issues and improve the engine’s overall performance and durability. For instance, the timing chain and tensioner revisions were implemented to enhance reliability. Additionally, the shift to Bosch engine management systems facilitated better integration with modern vehicle electronics and emission control systems.

==V6==
===AJ126===
The AJ126 V6 uses a AJ133 V8 engine block with the rear two cylinder bores blanked, and reduced bore sizes on the remaining six cylinders. While the engine block is the same size as the V8, the cylinder heads are shortened versions of the V8 heads. It is made on the same production line as the AJ133. 

The AJ126 is a 90° petrol V6, having a bore and stroke of with a 10.5:1 compression ratio. It is supercharged and liquid cooled featuring direct fuel injection, four overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. There are two versions differing in power produced, a standard version making at 6,500 rpm and between 3,500-5,000 rpm and a high-performance variant making at 6,500 rpm and between 3,500-5,000 rpm. A special Jaguar F-Type 400 Sport model made and .

The AJ126 engine is equipped with an Eaton TVS Roots-type supercharger. Specifically a 1.3L Eaton TVS R1320, mounted in the engine’s “vee” and is known for its compact design, efficiency, and ability to deliver smooth, immediate power.

Jaguar has since replaced the AJ-126 with an all new Ingenium turbocharged inline-6 engine.

<doc id="881868" wikidata="Q602428" url="?curid=881868" title="Antonio Guzmán Fernández">
<text>Silvestre Antonio Guzmán Fernández (February 12, 1911 – July 4, 1982), best known as Antonio Guzmán, was a Dominican businessman and a politician. He was President of the Dominican Republic, from 1978 to 1982.

== Early life ==
Antonio Guzmán was born in the town of La Vega. He studied in the primary and secondary schools of La Vega.

He worked in the fruit exportation business and soon became a wealthy rancher as well.

An early member of Juan Bosch’s Dominican Revolutionary Party, he served as secretary of agriculture in Bosch&#x27;s brief 1963 administration. In May 1966 he was the vice-presidential candidate for the PRD, with Bosch as the candidate for president. The elections were won, however, by Joaquín Balaguer.

He ran for president in 1974 as the candidate of a united opposition ticket. However, he pulled out after Balaguer changed the rules in a way that the opposition felt was unfair and undemocratic.

== Presidency ==
Guzmán ran for president again in 1978 as the PRD candidate, with Jacobo Majluta as his running mate. When election returns showed an unmistakable trend in Guzmán&#x27;s favor, the military stopped the count. However, amid vigorous protests at home and strong pressure abroad, the count resumed. When the returns were all in, Guzmán handed Balaguer the first loss of his electoral career. When Balaguer left office that year, it marked the first time in the Dominican Republic&#x27;s history that an incumbent president peacefully surrendered power to an elected member of the opposition.

Guzmán&#x27;s political plan was to move slowly to reform the social and economic aspects of the Dominican Republic, while he tried to have direct contact with the armed forces because of their threat concerning pressure in the political field. To directly attack the last problem, he implemented a program that reassigned or even removed officers who were skeptical of his plans and also promoted younger officers who stood behind Guzmán. This new program also called for an institution for more formal training for officers and personnel that enlisted in the armed forces. This program proved to be a great success, and it was a major part of the legacy Guzmán left behind.

Politically though, there was not a lot Guzmán could do because he was restrained to some extent since the majority of Congress consisted of Balaguer&#x27;s Reformist Party—which gave them benefits when it came to vetoing the different reforms Guzmán wished to launch. Since Guzmán was a wealthy cattle rancher—he knew how to implement well-mapped economic policies. He also helped make the nation&#x27;s public transportation system better and increased minimum wage. But even though Guzmán made many reforms that were beneficial to the country, he was still criticized for not responding to the economic decline. One big event that made the criticism even stronger was Hurricane David that hit in 1979, which slowed the economy even more.

== End of Presidency ==

Early in June 1982, Hipólito Mejía, who was running to become senator for the Santiago Province, was told that the president was not feeling well and that he should pay him a visit. Hipólito had a good relationship with the president, who had appointed him Minister of Agriculture in 1978. Upon arriving Hipólito found Guzmán sitting on the beach crying, next to his horse. Something that Hipólito, and everyone else, knew was very out of character in a president with a very strong and vibrant personality. When Hipólito inquired, Guzmán told him he was worried about the country&#x27;s future. That same day Hipólito told Renée Klang Avelino, the president&#x27;s wife, that he was worried about Guzmán, but Renée dismissed it telling him not to worry, her husband a valiant and fearless leader, and that there was nothing wrong with him. Three days later the president had dinner at Hipólito&#x27;s house. There Hipólito&#x27;s wife noticed that the president was acting very out of character and that he looked somewhat untidy. After listening to his wife&#x27;s concerns, Hipólito visited a psychiatrist friend who told him that the president may be suffering from depression. Hipólito would not have any of this of course, he knew his friend very well and told the psychiatrist that &quot;Guzman basically invented anti-depression&quot;. But the psychiatrist replied with a stern warning. &quot;Hipólito, depression is a cursed illness. Be very careful&quot;. It is very likely that the president was suffering from depression but kept it from everyone, even his wife. Furthermore, even if he had acknowledged it, he was the type of person that would have never taken medications for it. According to Hipólito, that&#x27;s the kind of person he was.

About a month later, on July 4, 1982, Hipólito was awakened at 4 am by a phone call from his cousin. Antonio Guzmán had shot himself. Vice-President Jacobo Majluta became acting President and ruled for the remaining 43 days of the four-year term (source missing).

<text>Gregory Edward Hemphill (born 14 December 1969) is a Scottish comedian, actor, writer, and director. Born in Springburn, an inner–city district in Glasgow, Scotland, Hemphill moved to Montreal in Canada in the mid-1970s before returning to Scotland in 1988. 

Hemphill is one of the executive producers and co–owner of the production company Effingee Productions. His work with Ford Kiernan, his long standing comedy and script writing partner, includes the BBC Scotland comedy series &quot;Chewin&#x27; The Fat&quot; (1999–2005) and &quot;Still Game&quot; (2002–2007, 2016–2019). Hemphill was Rector of the University of Glasgow between 2001 and 2004.

==Early and personal life==
Hemphill was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the son of Edward, a chartered accountant, and Anne Hemphill (née Brophy) a teacher. The family left Scotland in the mid-1970s, and he spent much of his childhood in Montreal, which has contributed to his Scottish-Canadian accent. 

He returned to Scotland in 1988 at the age of 18 to study at the University of Glasgow, where he achieved an MA Honours Degree in theatre, film and television. He is married to actress Julie Wilson Nimmo; they have two sons. Hemphill said that despite living in Canada, he &quot;always felt Scottish&quot;, claiming that &quot;My dad was from Maryhill, my mum was from St George’s Cross, and it seemed that everyone on the West Island of Montreal was from somewhere else&quot;.

==Career==

===Early career===
Hemphill has appeared in several projects. In 1990, he performed at the Edinburgh Fringe with Rab Christie and Neil Warhurst as the &quot;Trio Brothers Troup&quot;, where they won the 1990 &quot;So You Think You&#x27;re Funny&quot; trophy. He continued his stage work, appearing in the 1992 God Plus Support performance and in the popular 1995 &quot;Only an Excuse?&quot; tour. He also ventured into radio as the original presenter of football show, &quot;Off the Ball&quot; on BBC Radio Scotland and &quot;Eddie Mair Live&quot;.

Hemphill and Kiernan scripted seven episodes between 1999 and 2000, for then popular children&#x27;s television show &quot;Hububb&quot;. These were, Lullabubb, Top of the Bubbs, Conquer Leserest, Casual-Tea, Bubb Goes Boo, 2010: A Space Bubbsy and No Go Pogo. He guest starred alongside Kiernan in one episode, which he also scripted with Kiernan, Casual-Tea. However, his best known performances are alongside Ford Kiernan in the television sketch show &quot;Chewin&#x27; the Fat&quot; and its spin off, &quot;Still Game&quot;. In series three of &quot;Still Game&quot;, Hemphill&#x27;s brother Steve has a cameo as a CN Tower lift operative.

===&quot;Still Game&quot;===
Following the success of &quot;Chewin&#x27; The Fat&quot;, Kiernan and Hemphill wrote &quot;Still Game&quot;. &quot;Still Game&quot; was based on the original play that the pair wrote for the Edinburgh Festival in 1997. The Characters Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade had appeared throughout the four series of &quot;Chewin&#x27; The Fat&quot;. Six series and four specials were originally broadcast between 2002 and 2007. The series ended following the sixth series in 2007, with Ford Kiernan, Greg Hemphill and Paul Riley&#x27;s company Effingee Productions which produced &quot;Still Game&quot;, thought to have split up after Riley walked away to go it alone after being refused more control over the future of the company by Kiernan. Hemphill stated that he didn&#x27;t want a &quot;boardroom battle&quot;. The split ultimately resulted in the indefinite hiatus of the series.

In 2012 actor and playwright Kenny Boyle acquired the rights to the original stage play of Still Game and toured the show, with a new cast, to The Tron theatre, FTH theatre, and The Ayr Gaiety Theatre. The original play had not been staged for 14 years. Kiernan and Hemphill came to see the performances and consequently began considering reviving Still Game officially.

On 15 October 2013, the &quot;Daily Record&quot; ran a front-page story that the show would be returning. On 23 October 2013, Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill announced details of live shows entitled &quot; Still Game Live&quot; at The SSE Hydro in Glasgow at a press conference. They were scheduled to perform four shows beginning in September 2014, but due to high demand, it was extended to 16 and then 21 shows. On 24 October 2013 Kiernan confirmed in the &quot;Daily Record&quot; that Kenny Boyle&#x27;s tour of the original stage show had been one of the instigating factors for Still Game&#x27;s return. The 21 shows at The Hydro ran from 19 September 2014 until 10 October 2014, played to 210,000 fans and made £6,000,000 in ticket sales. The show received mixed reviews.

On 12 May 2016, the BBC announced that the show would return in 2016 with a six-part seventh series, nine years after the previous series concluded. Filming of the new seventh series started in the summer and the series began on 7 October 2016. The show&#x27;s return attracted its highest ever overnight audience for a single episode on 7 October, taking a 58% share of the Scottish TV audience with 1,300,000 viewers. The show also aired for the first time on BBC One across the UK nationwide and drew a total audience of 3,200,000. On 16 March 2017, it was announced that an eighth series has been commissioned to air on BBC One with plans to broadcast towards the end of 2017. The series was pushed back to start on 8 March 2018. On 13 July 2018, the BBC announced that Still Game would return for the ninth and final series later in 2019, after which the show will end. Filming for the ninth series started in August 2018 and was completed on 14 September 2018.

In September 2016, a second live show &quot;Still Game Live 2: Bon Voyage&quot; was announced for the SSE Hydro. The second stage show was to run for ten nights beginning 4 February 2017, but in October 2016, a further five performances were added. Unlike the previous live show, this show was not televised or recorded in any other way. The third and final SSE Hydro live show &quot;Still Game: The Final Farewell&quot; was officially announced on 1 November 2018, with five shows in September 2019 taking place over three days. A further 5 shows were announced on 2 November.

===University of Glasgow===
Hemphill was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow in March 2001. He was one of five candidates and narrowly defeated Alasdair Gray for the post.

===Other work===
Hemphill appeared in the Scottish Gaelic-language drama, &quot;Eilbheas&quot;, in which Hemphill played the spirit of Elvis set in the Western Isles. It was first shown on the launch night of BBC Alba. He has also written &quot;Appointment with the Wicker Man&quot; with Donald McLeary for the National Theatre of Scotland, a stage production about a small community&#x27;s attempts to produce a musical version of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;.

Hemphill has been involved in the Scottish wrestling scene, matched against actor, comedian and writer, Robert Florence. They played bitter rivals at &quot;Kelvin Brawl&quot; in the Glasgow&#x27;s Kelvin Hall on 21 June 2013. Comedian Frankie Boyle became part of this venture, unmasking himself at the end of the match.

Hemphill guest-starred in an episode of the award-winning children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Katie Morag&quot; in 2014, playing the part of Donald John Cameron. Hemphill starred as Mr Sawdust in two series of the CBeebies television show &quot;Olga da Polga&quot; alongside his wife Julie Wilson Nimmo.

In 2022, Hemphill and Julie Wilson Nimmo starred in television programme &quot;Jules and Greg&#x27;s Wild Swim&quot; about wild swimming which aired on New Years Day 2023 on BBC Scotland and BBC iPlayer. The full series of six episodes was released in 2023.

In March 2023, Hemphill featured on a BBC Scotland programme as part of the broadcaster&#x27;s centenary celebrations, alongside wife Julie Wilson Nimmo and &quot;Still Game&quot; co-star Sanjeev Kohli.

In 2024 Hemphill has featured as the father (Ade) on the BBC Programme Dinosaur.

In 2024, Hemphill made his Hollywood debut where he made an appearance in the film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; as a bartender.

=== Directing ===
In 2016, alongside Donald McLeary, Hemphill wrote the script for the horror/comedy film &quot;West Skerra Light&quot;. At a length of one hour, this was his first full-length drama as a film director. In 2017, alongside Hopscotch Films, Hemphill was involved in directing the black comedy ghost-hunting drama &quot;Long Night at Blackstone&quot;.

<doc id="881890" wikidata="Q452722" url="?curid=881890" title="Alice Hoffman">
<text>Alice Hoffman (born March 16, 1952) is an American novelist and young-adult and children&#x27;s writer, best known for her 1995 novel &quot;Practical Magic&quot;, which was adapted for a 1998 film of the same name. Many of her works fall into the genre of magic realism and contain elements of magic, irony, and non-standard romances and relationships.

== Early life and education==
Alice Hoffman was born in New York City and raised on Long Island, New York. Her grandmother was a Russian-Jewish immigrant. She graduated from Valley Stream North High School in 1969, and then from Adelphi University with a Bachelor of Arts. She was a Mirrielees Fellow at the Stanford University Creative Writing Center in 1973 and 1974, where she earned a Master of Arts in Creative Writing.

==Career==
When Hoffman was twenty-one and studying at Stanford, her first short story, &quot;At the Drive-In&quot;, was published in Volume 3 of the literary magazine &quot;Fiction&quot;. Editor Ted Solotaroff contacted her, and asked whether she had a novel. At that point, she began writing her first novel, &quot;Property Of&quot;. It was published in 1977, by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, now a division of Macmillan Publishers. A section of &quot;Property Of&quot; was published in Solotaroff&#x27;s literary magazine, &quot;American Review&quot;.

Hoffman&#x27;s first job was at Doubleday, which later published two of her novels.

She was the recipient of a New Jersey Notable Book Award for &quot;Ice Queen&quot;. She won a Hammett Prize for &quot;Turtle Moon&quot;.
She wrote the screenplay for the 1983 film &quot;Independence Day&quot;, starring Kathleen Quinlan and Dianne Wiest.

In September 2019 Hoffman released &quot;The World That We Knew&quot; based on a true story told to her by a fan at a book signing. The woman confided to Hoffman that during World War 2, her Jewish parents had her live with non-Jewish people to escape the Nazis. These were known as &quot;hidden children&quot; and Hoffman thought about this woman and her unusual upbringing for years before deciding to travel to Europe and learn more.

The third novel in her &quot;Practical Magic&quot; series, &quot;Magic Lessons&quot;, was released in October 2020. This prequel takes place in the 17th century and explores the life of Maria Owens, the family matriarch.

For Scholastic Press, Hoffman has also written the young adult novels &quot;Indigo&quot;, &quot;Green Ange&quot;l, and its sequel, &quot;Green Witch&quot;. With her son Wolfe Martin, she wrote the picture book &quot;Moondog&quot;.

In 2015, Hoffman donated her archives to her alma mater, Adelphi University.

==Personal life==
Hoffman resides in Boston. After being treated for breast cancer at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, she helped establish the hospital&#x27;s Hoffman Breast Center.

<doc id="881893" wikidata="Q7872865" url="?curid=881893" title="USS Pickering">
<text>USS &quot;Pickering&quot; was a brig, the 1st brig built for the UCRC Service, in the United States Revenue Cutter Service and then the United States Navy during the Quasi-War with France. She was named for Timothy Pickering, then the Secretary of State.

USRC &quot;Pickering&quot; was built at Newburyport, Massachusetts in 1798 for the Revenue Cutter Service. Captain Jonathan Chapman was her first commander. Taken into the Navy in July at the outbreak of the Quasi-War, she departed Boston on her first cruise on 22 August.

==Service history==
In 1799 and early 1800, she was part of Commodore Barry&#x27;s squadron in the West Indies. Lieutenant Edward Preble commanded &quot;Pickering&quot; from January through June 1799, when he was promoted to captain and took command of the frigate .

On 21 April 1799 she exchanged fire with Fort Dup Vieux and Fort Royall, Guadeloupe. On 29 April 1799 she and USS George Washington recaptured American brig &quot;Fair American&quot; captured by 3 French letters of marque the previous day. On 1 May 1799 she, and USS George Washington recaptured American brig &quot;Francis&quot;, captured by a French privateer. &quot;Francis&quot; was Captained by Joshua Preble, Lieutenant Edward Preble&#x27;s brother. &quot;Pickering&quot; was permanently transferred to the Navy on 20 May and re-designated USS &quot;Pickering&quot;. She arrived at New York 12–13 June 1799 from her deployment to the Caribbean. Master Commandant Benjamin Hillar, U.S. Navy, assumed command in June, and continued command of the ship for its final years. She, USS Ganges, and USS Merrimack recaptured American merchant schooner &quot;John&quot; on 15 August 1799. On 16 September 1799 she captured (recaptured?) schooner Atalanta, condemned by prize court and sold in August, 1800. &quot;Pickering&quot; fought a notable engagement with the French privateer &quot;L&#x27;Egypte Conquise&quot; on 18 October 1799. The Frenchman was well fitted out and manned and should have been able to capture &quot;Pickering&quot;. While the French ship carried fourteen 9-pounders, four 6-pounders, and crew of 250, the American cutter had only fourteen 4-pounders and seventy men. After a nine-hour battle, however, the French ship was forced to surrender. A few days earlier she had a running battle with a French lugger that escaped due to springing of the Pickering&#x27;s masts. Sometime in October she and USS Delaware recaptured brig &quot;Henrich&quot;. On 27 December 1799 she captured a French privateer, possibly &quot;Voltiguese&quot;. &quot;Pickering&quot; continued to cruise in the West Indies, and before her return to the United States had captured four French privateers, including &quot;Atalanta&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Active&quot;(sometime before 24 April), and &quot;Fly&quot;. Between 2 August to 31 December 1799 she recaptured schooner &quot;Cynthia&quot;, Unknown English sloop, French schooner &quot;Helen&quot;, recaptured Danish brig &quot;Helen&quot;, recaptured brig &quot;Brothers&quot; sometime in November, recaptured schooner &quot;Harriet&quot; in January, 1800. On 2 February 1800 she recaptured armed merchant ship &quot;Portland&quot; in the Sale Rock Passage, she had been captured by a privateer on 25 January (). In April she recaptured brigs &quot;Mary&quot; and &quot;Eliza&quot;, and captured an unknown schooner. She arrived in Boston on 17 May 1800. She departed Boston 10 June to patrol between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras.

She returned to New Castle, Delaware on 21 July. Ordered to join Commodore Thomas Truxton&#x27;s squadron on the Guadeloupe Station in the West Indies, she sailed from New Castle, Delaware on 20 August, and was never heard from again. She is presumed to have been lost with all hands in a gale in September, but this was never proven. This storm is also thought to have sunk , which likewise vanished without a trace. The exact cause of the cutter&#x27;s disappearance remains a mystery.

<doc id="881897" wikidata="Q7774318" url="?curid=881897" title="The Western Star (Ohio)">
<text>The Western Star was a weekly newspaper published for 206 years, from February 13, 1807, to January 17, 2013. It had been the oldest weekly newspaper in Ohio, second oldest of any sort in Ohio after the daily &quot;Chillicothe Gazette&quot;, and the oldest paper bearing its original name published west of the Appalachian Mountains until it ceased publication with its January 17, 2013 printed edition. It had been published on Thursdays by Cox Media Group Ohio, the communications company founded by former Ohio Governor James Middleton Cox. Its coverage area was primarily Lebanon and southern Warren County.

&quot;The Western Star&quot; for most of its history was a paid-circulation paper and became a free saturation paper in the early 2000s. The paper, based in Lebanon, Ohio for more than 200 years, closed its Lebanon office in 2010 as part of a consolidation of Cox Media Group Ohio&#x27;s weekly newspaper facilities to Liberty Township, Butler County, Ohio.

In November, 2012, Cox Media Group announced in a letter to advertisers that the paper would be combined with other Cox weeklies the &quot;Pulse-Journal&quot; and the &quot;Fairfield Echo&quot; into &quot;The Pulse of Warren County&quot; and &quot;The Pulse of Butler County&quot; beginning with the January 20, 2013 print editions. According to CMG, these are &quot;two brand new weekly newspapers delivered to communities currently served by &quot;The Western Star&quot;, &quot;Fairfield Echo&quot;, and &quot;The Pulse-Journal&quot;&quot; and &quot;The Pulse county news editions will replace The Western Star.&quot; Subsequently, company representatives announced that the papers would be branded &quot;&quot;Today&#x27;s Pulse of Warren County&quot;, a product of The Western Star&quot; and &quot;&quot;Today&#x27;s Pulse of Butler County&quot;, a product of the Fairfield Echo.&quot; An article (FAQ) on the Cox weeklies&#x27; websites during the week of January 13, 2013 stated, &quot;The final issues of &quot;The Western Star&quot;, &quot;Fairfield Echo&quot; and the &quot;Pulse-Journal&quot; editions was on Thursday, January 17, 2013.&quot;

==Founding and ownership==
It was first published February 13, 1807 by John McLean (1785-1861), who eventually became an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. For a century, no copy was known of the first issue, the paper itself lacking a copy. However, one eventually was found in the archives of the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, Massachusetts.

McLean sold the paper in 1810 to his brother, Nathaniel McLean. Over the next four years, Nathaniel partnered successively with the Rev. Adjet McGuire, Samuel H. Hale, Henry Lazier, Joseph Henderson, and William Blackburn. In 1814, Nathaniel sold his interest to his brother William McLean (1794-1863) who published it with Blackburn until 1816, when Blackburn departed.

In 1817, William McLean sold to Abram Van Vleet, a justice of the peace, and John Eddy (1762-1824). Later that year they took on William A. Camron (died 1838) as a partner. Eddy left that year, replaced by a man named Cunningham who did not last the year. In 1825, Van Vleet and Eddy sold to Anthony Howard Dunlavy, an attorney who served in the Ohio General Assembly and as Warren County prosecutor, and William A. Sellers, a member of the General Assembly in 1838. In 1827, they sold the paper to Camron and Jacob Morris, who was married to Dunlavy&#x27;s sister and later was Warren County treasurer. In 1828, Camron sold to Dunlavy, who was partners with his brother-in-law until 1829 when Morris assumed sole control. Morris took on an apprentice circa 1830, William H. P. Denny. He became Morris&#x27;s partner, and in 1834, sole owner.

In 1858, Denny sold his interest and left town. The new owner was Dr. James Scott, who served in the Ohio General Assembly, followed by William H. Corwin, son of the founder of Lebanon, and, by the late 1860s, Seth W. Brown, an attorney who later served as Warren County prosecutor. The paper at this time was a Republican journal.

On January 19, 1871, Brown sold to William C. McClintock (born 1845) and Clements Hardy. McClintock assumed sole ownership on January 16, 1873. He published the paper, then a seven-column quarto, and introduced steam printing presses. He owned the paper until circa 1893 when ownership was assumed by a corporation, the Western Star Publishing Company, which was controlled by McClintock until 1907, when John M. Mulford took over and owned it until 1921. In May 1902, a linotype machine to set type was introduced. On September 6, 1923, the Brown Publishing Company, the company owned by Congressman Clarence J. Brown, bought the paper and owned it until 1998.

Brown&#x27;s first act was to appoint as editor and publisher Gardner H. Townsley (circa 1897–1967), whose claim to fame was having been the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale&#x27;s college roommate. He expanded the paper from twelve to sixteen pages. He subsequently served as publisher over a succession of editors: Warren Nelson, Ed Thompson, Jamyes Myers, and David Schneider. Townsley served as publisher until his death.

His son Robert N. Townsley (died April 17, 1994) replaced him as publisher, with Schneider continuing as editor. In October 1968, Townsley was replaced by William Kreeger, who had the title &quot;general manager&quot; until March 1970 when he was named publisher. Janet Goode became editor in January 1970 and served until October of that year when she was replaced by John Nichols. Nichols served until August 1971 when Joe Falter became editor. Falter served until he retired in 1994. Thomas Barr served as Western Star editor from 1994 until 2008. In 1990, Fred Gibson became publisher and served until the paper&#x27;s sale in 1998. Under both Falter and Barr, through 2007 the paper earned many first or second place honors in General Excellence in the Ohio Newspaper Association Hooper Awards, and in 2007 the paper earned third place nationwide in the Best Non-Daily contest by the national Suburban Newspapers of America.

In the 1998, Brown traded &quot;The Western Star&quot; along with the &quot;Star Press&quot; in Springboro, &quot;Today&#x27;s Express&quot; in Morrow, the &quot;Monroe Times&quot;, and the &quot;Miamisburg-West Carrollton News&quot; to The Thomson Corporation, a Canadian newspaper company known for the poor quality of its publications, in exchange for three daily papers, the &quot;Piqua Daily Call&quot;, the &quot;Xenia Daily Gazette&quot;, and the &quot;Greenville Daily Advocate&quot;. When the company decided to exit the newspaper business, Thomson sold &quot;The Western Star&quot; to Cox on September 1, 2000, though only after Thomson&#x27;s original plans to sell the paper to Gannett, owner of &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, fell apart. From late 1991 to January 13, 2013, the paper issued a free Sunday edition, although for its last few years it contained exclusively advertising. Under Cox it surrendered its second class mailing permit, ceased its distribution in the southern part of Warren County, and began to be distributed free to homes in Lebanon and Turtlecreek Township.

==Publication history==
The paper was first published on Friday, February 13, 1807, under the name &quot;The Western Star&quot; and continued to Saturday, August 10, 1822, when it merged with another weekly, &quot;The Lebanon Gazette&quot;. Effective with the issue of Saturday, August 17, 1822, it assumed the name &quot;The Western Star and Lebanon Gazette&quot;, continuing under that name until Saturday, June 12, 1824. With the issue of Saturday, June 19, 1824, it shortened its name to the &quot;Star and Gazette&quot;, continuing under that name until the issue of Monday, September 5, 1825.

With the issue of Monday, September 13, 1825, it went back to the old name, &quot;The Western Star and Lebanon Gazette&quot; and published under that title until the issue of Saturday, July 26, 1828. Effective Saturday, August 2, 1828, the name was shortened back to &quot;The Western Star&quot; and continued until Thursday, October 27, 1859. With the issue of Thursday, November 3, 1859, the titled changed to &quot;The Weekly Western Star&quot;. By 1866, the word &quot;weekly&quot; was dropped but with the issue of Thursday, January 26, 1871, it was once more &quot;The Weekly Western Star&quot; until Thursday, December 26, 1872. &quot;Weekly&quot; was once more dropped with the Thursday, January 2, 1873, issue.

It continued under this name until Thursday, February 16, 1893, the paper that week merging with another paper called &quot;The Lebanon Gazette&quot;. As of Thursday, February 23, 1893, the paper appeared as &quot;The Western Star and Lebanon Gazette&quot; until Thursday, January 12, 1899. The title was shortened back to &quot;The Western Star&quot; effective with the issue of Thursday, January 19, 1899, and continued as a weekly until the issue of Thursday, August 29, 1935. The following Monday, September 2, 1935, the paper began a brief existence as a daily, publishing every day except Sundays. This continued to Thursday, December 31, 1936. The following week it resumed its existence as a weekly with the issue of Thursday, January 7, 1937. That issue also marked a change in the name of the paper to &quot;The Western Star and Lebanon Patriot&quot; with its absorption of another weekly, &quot;The Lebanon Patriot&quot;. The title went back to &quot;The Western Star&quot; with the issue of Thursday, July 7, 1938.

The paper then switched its publication day to Wednesday but returned to Thursdays circa 2002.

<doc id="881899" wikidata="Q661729" url="?curid=881899" title="Weltklasse Zürich">
<text>Weltklasse Zürich () is an annual, invitation-only, world-class track and field meeting at the Letzigrund in Zürich, Switzerland, generally held at the end of August or beginning of September. Previously one of the IAAF Golden League events, it now serves as a final of the Wanda Diamond League, alongside Memorial Van Damme between 2010 and 2019. In 2021 and 2022, Weltklasse Zürich served as the sole final of the Diamond League, and this is also planned for 2025 and 2027. So far, 27 world records have been set at Weltklasse Zürich. In 1988, Carl Lewis won the 100-meter duel against Ben Johnson. The time of 9.93 seconds was upgraded to a world record a year later, following Johnson’s doping case.

One of the first large-scale international athletics events (outside the Summer Olympics), it is sometimes referred to as the one-day Olympics. With a budget of about ten million Swiss francs, Weltklasse Zürich ranks among the most expensive events in athletics. Every year, it draws around 25,000 fans to Letzigrund Stadium, with competitions broadcast in up to 135 countries. Since 2014, Christoph Joho and Andreas Hediger have led the organization as co-directors. 

Weltklasse Zürich first took place on 12 August 1928. In the beginning, the meeting was nicknamed by the public the &quot;Nurmi meeting&quot; after the most admired and celebrated participant at the time, Paavo Nurmi. On 21 June 1960, on the Letzigrund track, Armin Hary became the first human to run the 100 m dash in 10.0 seconds.

UBS has supported Weltklasse Zürich as its main sponsor since 1981. Other sponsors are Vaudoise Assurances, Migros, Le Gruyère Switzerland, Medica, Omega, Swiss, Lexus, Erdgas and Puma.

==History==
The meeting was conceived in 1924 by the athletic section of the FC Zürich which became the Leichtathletik Club Zürich in 1934, and was first held at the Letzigrund on a dirt track on 12 August 1928 as the Internationales Leichtathletik-Meeting in Zürich.
Since 1935 it also became known as the &quot;American Meeting&quot;, similar to the Bislett Games, and this continued into the 1950s.
A notable hiatus occurred after the 1952 meeting until the rebuilt Letzigrund Stadium opened in 1958, although a meeting had still been planned for August 1954.
The name &quot;Weltklasse Zürich&quot; was adopted in 1959.
The meet would not be held regularly on an annual basis until 1973, and the Weltklasse introduced electronic timing the following year.

During 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic prevented Weltklasse Zürich from taking place, instead an event called &quot;Inspiration Games&quot; was held.

==Track surface==
The first surface was made of dirt in 1928, and the first synthetic track surface in Europe was installed in 1968.
The number of lanes was increased to eight in the early 1970s which forced the Weltklasse to be put on hold for two years for the construction to take place.

The current surface at the Letzigrund Stadium was developed in 2014 by the Swiss company CONICA. The new surface was installed in June 2014 at a cost of 800,000 CHF and was paid for by the city of Zurich, which owns Letzigrund Stadium.

==Editions==
Some of the earliest editions were bilateral matches that are not counted among the 29 &quot;Internationales&quot; and Weltklasse meetings organized from 1928 til 1977.


==World records==
Over the course of its history, numerous world records have been set at Weltklasse Zürich.

<doc id="881901" wikidata="Q1181944" url="?curid=881901" title="Ceiling fan">
<text>A ceiling fan is a fan mounted on the ceiling of a room or space, usually electrically powered, that uses hub-mounted rotating blades to air. They cool people effectively by increasing air speed. Fans do not reduce air temperature or relative humidity, unlike air-conditioning equipment, but create a cooling effect by helping to evaporate sweat and increase heat exchange via convection. Fans add a small amount of heat to the room mainly due to waste heat from the motor, and partially due to friction. Fans use significantly less power than air conditioning as cooling air is thermodynamically expensive. In the winter, fans move warmer air, which naturally rises, back down to occupants. This can affect both thermostat readings and occupants&#x27; comfort, thereby improving the energy efficiency of climate control. Many ceiling fan units also double as light fixtures, eliminating the need for separate overhead lights in a room.

==History==
Punkah style ceiling fans are based on the earliest form of the fan, which was first invented in India around 500 BC. These were cut from an Indian palmyra leaf which forms its rather large blade, moving slowly in a pendular manner. Originally operated manually by a cord and nowadays powered electrically using a belt-driven system, these punkahs move air by going to and fro. In comparison to a rotating fan, it creates a gentle breeze rather than an airflow.
Some of the first rotary ceiling fans appeared in the early 1860s, and 1870s in the United States. At that time, they were not powered by any form of electric motor. Instead, a stream of running water was used, in conjunction with a turbine, to drive a system of belts which would turn the blades of two-blade fan units. These systems could accommodate several fan units, and became popular in stores, restaurants, and offices. Some of these systems survive today, and can be seen in parts of the southern United States where they originally proved useful.

The electrically powered ceiling fan was invented in 1882 by Philip Diehl. He had engineered the electric motor used in the first electrically powered Singer sewing machines, and in 1882 he adapted that motor for use in a ceiling-mounted fan. Each fan had its own self-contained motor unit, with no need for belt drive.

Almost immediately he faced fierce competition due to the commercial success of the ceiling fan. He continued to make improvements to his invention and created a light kit fitted to the ceiling fan to combine both functions in one unit. By World War I most ceiling fans were made with four blades instead of the original two, which made fans quieter and allowed them to circulate more air. The early turn-of-the-century companies who successfully commercialized the sale of ceiling fans in the United States were what is today known as the Hunter Fan Company, Robbins &amp; Myers, Century Electric, Westinghouse Corporation and Emerson Electric.

By the 1920s, ceiling fans became commonplace in the United States and had started to take hold internationally. From the Great Depression of the 1930s, until the introduction of electric air conditioning in the 1950s, ceiling fans slowly faded out of vogue in the U.S., almost falling into total disuse in the U.S. by the 1960s; those that remained were considered items of nostalgia.
Meanwhile, ceiling fans became very popular in other countries, particularly those with hot climates, such as India, Pakistan,Bangladesh and the Middle East, where a lack of infrastructure and/or financial resources made energy-hungry and complex freon-based air conditioning equipment impractical. In 1973, Texas entrepreneur H. W. (Hub) Markwardt began importing ceiling fans into the U.S. that were manufactured in India by Crompton Greaves, Ltd. Crompton Greaves had been manufacturing ceiling fans since 1937 through a joint venture formed by Greaves Cotton of India and Crompton Parkinson of England. These Indian manufactured ceiling fans caught on slowly at first, but Markwardt&#x27;s Encon Industries branded ceiling fans (which stood for ENergy CONservation) eventually found great success during the energy crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s since they consumed less energy than the antiquated shaded pole motors used in most other American made fans. The fans became the energy-saving appliances for residential and commercial use by supplementing expensive air conditioning units with a column of gentle airflow.
Due to this renewed commercial success using ceiling fans effectively as an energy conservation application, many American manufacturers also started to produce, or significantly increase the production of, ceiling fans. In addition to the imported Encon ceiling fans, the Casablanca Fan Company was founded in 1974. Other American manufacturers of the time included the Hunter Fan Co. (which was then a division of Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc), FASCO (F. A. Smith Co.), and Emerson Electric; which was often branded as Sears-Roebuck. Smaller, short-lived companies include NuTone, Southern Fan Co., A&amp;G Machinery Co., Homestead, Hallmark, Union, Lasko, and Evergo.

Through the 1980s and 1990s, ceiling fans remained popular in the United States. Many small American importers, most of them rather short-lived, started importing ceiling fans. Throughout the 1980s, the balance of sales between American-made ceiling fans and those imported from manufacturers in India, Taiwan, Hong Kong and eventually China changed dramatically with imported fans taking the lion&#x27;s share of the market by the late 1980s. Even the most basic U.S-made fans sold for $200 to $500, while the most expensive imported fans rarely exceeded $150.

Ceiling fan technology has not evolved much since 1980, with a notable exception being the semi-recent increase in availability of energy-efficient, remote/app controlled brushless DC fans to the masses. However, important inroads have been made in design by companies such as Monte Carlo, Minka Aire, Quorum, Craftmade, Litex and Fanimation—offering higher price ceiling fans with more decorative value. In 2001, &quot;Washington Post&quot; writer Patricia Dane Rogers wrote, &quot;Like so many other mundane household objects, these old standbys are going high-style and high-tech.&quot;

==Uses==
Ceiling fans have multiple functions. Fans increase mixing in a ventilated space, which leads to more homogenous environmental conditions. Moving air is generally preferred over stagnant air, especially in warm or neutral environments, so fans are useful in increasing occupant satisfaction. Because fans do not change air temperature and humidity, but move it around, fans can aid in both the heating and cooling of a space. Because of this, ceiling fans are often an instrumental element of low energy HVAC, passive cooling or natural ventilation systems in buildings. Depending on the energy use of the fan system, fans can be an efficient way to improve thermal comfort by allowing for a higher ambient air temperature while keeping occupants comfortable. Fans are an especially economic choice in warm, humid environments.

Ceiling fans can be controlled together in a shared space, and can also be individually controlled in a home or office setting. In an office environment, individually controlled ceiling fans can have a significant positive impact on thermal comfort, which has been shown to increase productivity and satisfaction among occupants. Ceiling fans aid in the distribution of fresh air in both mechanically ventilated and naturally ventilated spaces. In naturally ventilated spaces, ceiling fans are effective at drawing in and circulating fresh outdoor air. In mechanically ventilated spaces, fans can be focused to channel and circulate conditioned air in a room.

===Direction===
The direction that a fan spins should change based on whether the room needs to be heated or cooled. Unlike air conditioners, fans only move air—they do not directly change its temperature. Therefore, ceiling fans that have a mechanism for reversing the direction in which the blades push air (most commonly an electrical switch on the unit&#x27;s switch housing, motor housing, or lower canopy) can help in both heating and cooling.

While ceiling fan manufacturers (mainly Emerson) have had electrically reversible motors in production since the 1930s, most fans made before the mid-1970s are either not reversible at all or mechanically reversible (have adjustable blade pitch) instead of an electrically reversible motor. In this case, the blades should be pitched with the upturned edge leading for downdraft, and with the downturned edge leading for updraft. Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Adaptair&quot; mechanism is perhaps the most well-known example of mechanical reversibility.

For cooling, the fan&#x27;s direction of rotation should usually be set so that air is blown downward—usually counter-clockwise from beneath, but dependent upon manufacturer. The blades should lead with the upturned edge as they spin. The breeze created by a ceiling fan creates a wind chill effect, speeding the evaporation of perspiration on human skin, which makes the body&#x27;s natural cooling mechanism much more efficient. As a result of this phenomenon, the air conditioning thermostat can be set a few degrees higher than normal when a fan is in operation, greatly reducing power consumption. Since the fan works directly on the body, rather than by changing the temperature of the air, it is recommended to switch all ceiling fans off when a room is unoccupied, to further reduce power consumption. In some cases, like when a fan is near walls like in a hallway, updraft may cause better airflow. Another example of how updraft can cause better cooling is when the ceiling fan is in middle of a bedroom with a loft bed near a wall, meaning breeze can be felt better when airflow is coming from the top.

For heating, ceiling fans should be set to blow the air upward. Air naturally stratifies, i.e. warmer air rises to the ceiling while cooler air sinks, meaning that colder air settles near the floor where people spend most of their time. A ceiling fan, with its direction of rotation set so that the warmer air on the ceiling is pushed down along the walls and into the room, heating the cooler air. This avoids blowing a stream of air directly at the occupants of the room, which would tend to cool them. This action works to equalize, or even out the temperature in the room, making it cooler at ceiling level, but warmer near the floor. Thus the heating thermostat in the area can be set a few degrees lower to save energy while maintaining the same level of comfort.

Though reversible models of industrial-grade ceiling fans do exist, most are not reversible. High ceiling heights in most industrial applications render reversibility unnecessary. Instead, industrial ceiling fans typically de-stratify heat by blowing hot air at ceiling level directly down toward the floor.

===Blade shape===
Residential ceiling fans, which are almost always reversible, typically use flat, paddle-like blades, which are equally effective in downdraft and updraft. Industrial ceiling fans typically are not reversible and operate only in downdraft, and therefore are able to make effective use of blades that are contoured to have a downdraft bias.

More recently, however, residential ceiling fan designers have been making increasing use of contoured blades in an effort to boost ceiling fan efficiency. This contour, while serving to effectively boost the fan&#x27;s performance while operating in downdraft, can hinder performance when operating in updraft.

===Air conditioning===
The most commonplace use of ceiling fans today is in conjunction with an air conditioning unit. Without an operating ceiling fan, air conditioning units typically have both the tasks of cooling the air inside the room and circulating it. Provided the ceiling fan is properly sized for the room in which it is operating, its efficiency of moving air far exceeds that of an air conditioning unit, therefore, for peak efficiency, the air conditioner should be set to a low fan setting and the ceiling fan should be used to circulate the air.

===Flicker and strobing===
Ceiling fans are usually installed in a space with other lighting fixtures, but if the fan is positioned too close to a light panel or fixture, a strobe or flicker effect may occur. A strobe or flicker effect is a phenomenon which occurs when light brightens and dims consistently as it penetrates and passes through a moving ceiling fan. This is due to the fan blades intermittently blocking the light, causing shadows to appear across the room&#x27;s interior surface leading to visual discomfort. The rotating area of a moving fan blade can commonly obstruct the light source when a ceiling fan is positioned underneath an artificial lighting fixture, which can be increasingly distracting to occupants within the space. To ensure that the ceiling fans seamlessly co-exists with the lighting fixtures to avoid strobing, it is recommended that the horizontal separation between the blade and the lighting fixture is maximized. In addition, increasing the vertical distance between the light and the blade will reduce the concentration and frequency of strobing. Never position a light fixture directly above a ceiling fan&#x27;s blades, and downlight and point source fixtures should be set such that their beam angles do not cross them. Generally, to ensure uniformly adequate light levels, any recessed ceiling lighting and fixtures that emit light above the level of the fan blades should be placed as far away from the ceiling fan as possible. Another recommended strategy is to ensure that the light’s angle of dispersion or the field angle is reduced, which minimizes the strobing effect from the fan blades. It is well known that human eyes can detect flicker at low frequencies (between 60 and 90 hertz), but not at high frequencies (beyond 100 hertz), which is also known as non-visible flicker. The strobe effect can have significant physiological and psychological effect on humans. Two test rooms were utilized in an experiment to compare the effects of visual flicker induced the ceiling fan. The findings revealed statistical proof that one out of three cognitive performances (digit-span task) may have been reduced slightly as a result of an increased effect of visual flicker.

==Parts==
The key components of a ceiling fan are the following:
* An electric motor
* Blades (also known as paddles or wings) usually made from solid wood, plywood, steel, aluminium, MDF or plastic
* Blade irons (also known as blade brackets, blade arms, blade holders, or flanges), which hold the blades and connect them to the motor.
* Flywheel, a metal, plastic, or tough rubber double-torus that is attached to the motor shaft and to which the blade irons may be attached. The flywheel inner ring is locked to the shaft by a lock-screw and the blade irons to the outer ring by screws or bolts that feed into tapped metal inserts. Rubber or plastic flywheels may become brittle and break, a common cause of fan failure. Replacing the flywheel may require disconnecting wiring and requires removing the switch housing that&#x27;s on the way for the flywheel to be removed and replaced.
* Rotor, an alternative to blade irons. First patented by industrial designer Ron Rezek in 1991, the one-piece die-cast rotor receives and secures the blades and bolts right to the motor, eliminating most balance problems and minimizing exposed fasteners.
* A mechanism for mounting the fan to the ceiling such as:
** Ball-and-socket system. With this system, there is a metal or plastic hemisphere mounted on the end of the downrod; this hemisphere rests in a ceiling-mounted metal bracket, or self-supporting canopy, and allows the fan to move freely (which is very useful on vaulted ceilings).
** J-hook and Shackle clamp. A type of mounting system where the ceiling fan hangs on a hardened metal hook, screwed into the ceiling or bolted through a steel I-beam. The fan can be mounted directly on a ceiling hook, making the junction box optional. A porcelain or rubber grommet is used to reduce vibration and to electrically isolate the fan from the ceiling hook. This type of mounting is most common on antique ceiling fans and ceiling fans made for industrial use. A variation of this system using a U-bracket secured to the ceiling by means of lag bolts is often used on heavy-duty ceiling fans with electrically reversible motors in order to reduce the risk of the fan unscrewing itself from the ceiling while running in clockwise. This type of mount is ideally suited to the RC flat roof with metal hooks and has become ubiquitous in South Asia, including Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, etc.
** Flush mount (also known as &quot;low profile&quot; or &quot;hugger&quot; ceiling fans). These are specially designed fans with no downrod or canopy like a traditional mount fan. The motor housing appears to be directly attached to the ceiling, that is where the name &quot;hugger&quot; comes from. They are ideal for rooms with low ceilings ranging in height between 2.286 m and 2.5908 m. A disadvantage to this design is that since the blades are mounted so close to the ceiling, air movement is greatly reduced.
::Some ball-and-socket fans can be mounted using a low-ceiling adapter, purchased specially from the fan&#x27;s manufacturer. This allows the same design to be used in both a high and low ceiling environment, simplifying the buying decision for consumers. In recent years, it has become increasingly common for a ball-and-socket fan to be designed such that the canopy (ceiling cover piece) can optionally be screwed directly into the top of the motor housing, thus eliminating the need for a downrod. The whole fan can be secured directly onto the ceiling mounting bracket; this is often referred to as a dual-mount or tri-mount.
Other components, which vary by model and style, can include:
* A downrod, a metal pipe used to suspend the fan from the ceiling. Downrods come in many lengths and widths, depending on the fan type.
* A decorative encasement for the motor (known as the &quot;motor housing&quot;).
* A switch housing (also known as a &quot;switch cup&quot; or &quot;nose column&quot;), a metal or plastic cylinder mounted below and in the center of the fan&#x27;s motor. The switch housing is used to conceal and protect various components, which can include wires, capacitors, and switches; on fans that require oiling, it often conceals the oil reservoir which lubricates the bearings. The switch housing also makes for a convenient place to mount a light kit.
* Blade badges, decorative adornments attached to the visible underside of the blades for the purpose of concealing the screws used to attach the blades to the blade irons.
* Assorted switches used for turning the fan on and off, adjusting the speed at which the blades rotate, changing the direction in which the blades rotate, and operating any lamps that may be present. Some fans have remote controls to adjust speed and turn the light off and on. 
* Lamps
** Uplights, which are installed on top of the fan&#x27;s motor housing and project light up onto the ceiling, for aesthetic reasons (to &quot;create ambience&quot;)
** Downlights, often referred to as a &quot;light kit&quot;, which add ambient light to a room and can be used to replace any ceiling-mounted lamps that were displaced by the installation of a ceiling fan
** Decorative lights mounted inside the motor housing—in this type of setup, the motor housing side-band often has glass or acrylic panel sections, which allow light to shine though.

==Operation==
The way in which a fan is operated depends on its manufacturer, style, and the era in which it was made. Operating methods include:
* &quot;Pull-chain/pull-cord control.&quot; This style of fan is equipped with a metal-bead chain or cloth cord which, when pulled, cycles the fan through the operational speed(s) and then back to off. These fans typically have between one and four speeds. Fans with lights usually have a second pull chain which is to control light, and it&#x27;s usually on/off, but sometimes it&#x27;s three way, in which case it would be some lights, other lights, all lights, and off. Some fans, usually outdoor rated or Canadian, have another pull chain to change direction.
* &quot;Variable-speed control.&quot; During the 1970s and into the mid-1980s, fans were often produced with a solid-state variable-speed control. This was a dial mounted either on the body of the fan or in a gang box at the wall, and when turned in either direction, continuously varied the speed at which the blades rotated—similar to a dimmer switch for a light fixture. A few fans substituted a rotary click-type switch for the infinite-speed dial, providing a set number of set speeds (usually ranging from four to ten).
** Different fan manufacturers used variable-speed controls in different ways:
*** The variable-speed dial controlling the fan entirely; to turn the fan on, the user turns the knob until it clicks out of the &quot;off&quot; position, and can then choose the fan&#x27;s speed.
***Variable speed pull-chain. This setup is similar to the variable-speed dial discussed above, except that a &quot;dual chain&quot; setup is used to turn the potentiometer shaft.
*** A pull-chain present along with the variable-speed control; the dial can be set in one place and left there, with the pull-chain serving only to turn the fan on and off. Many of these fans have an option to wire an optional light kit to this pull-chain in order to control both the fan and the light with one chain. Using this method, the user can have either the fan or light on individually, both on, or both off.
*** &quot;Vari-Lo.&quot; A pull-chain and variable-speed control are present. Such a fan has two speeds controlled by a pull-chain: high (full power, independent of the position of the variable-speed control), and &quot;Vari-Lo&quot; (speed determined by the position of the variable-speed control). In some cases, maximum speed on Vari-Lo setting is slower than high.

* &quot;Wall-mounted control.&quot; Some fans have their control(s) mounted on the wall instead of on the fans themselves; these are very common with industrial and HVLS fans. Such controls are usually proprietary and/or specialized switches.
** &quot;Mechanical wall control.&quot; This style of switch takes varying physical forms. The wall control, which contains a motor speed regulator of some sort, determines how much power is delivered to the fan and therefore how fast it spins. Older such controls employed a choke—a large iron-cored coil—as their regulator; these controls were typically large, boxy, and surface-mounted on the wall. They had anywhere from four to eight speeds. Newer versions of this type of control do not use a choke as such, but much smaller capacitors and/or solid-state circuitry; the switch is typically mounted in a standard in-wall gang box. The old one is called electrical fan regulator that works on the principle of reducing voltage and the new one is called electronic fan regulator that works on the principle of switching that control the time duration of the power supply. The new electronic fan regulator is more power efficient.
** &quot;Digital wall control.&quot; With this style of control, all of the fan&#x27;s functions—on/off status, speed, the direction of rotation, and any attached light fixtures—are controlled by a computerized wall control, which typically does not require any special wiring. Instead, it uses the normal house wiring to send coded electrical pulses to the fan, which decodes and acts on them using a built-in set of electronics. This style of control typically has anywhere from three to seven speeds.
* &quot;Wireless remote control.&quot; In recent years, remote controls have dropped in price to become cost-effective for controlling ceiling fans. They may be supplied with fans or fitted to an existing fan. The hand-held remote transmits radio frequency or infrared control signals to a receiver unit installed in the fan. However, these may not be ideal for commercial installations as the controllers require batteries. They can also get misplaced, especially in installs with many fans.
* &quot;Directional Switch.&quot; Most ceiling fans typically feature a small slide switch on the motor body of the fan itself, which controls the direction in which the fan rotates. In one position, the fan is caused to rotate clockwise, in the other position the fan is caused to rotate counter-clockwise. Given that the fan blades are typically slanted, this results in the air either being drawn upwards or brought downwards. While the user can select which they prefer, typically air is blown downwards in summer and lifted upwards in winter. The downwards blowing is experienced as &quot;cooling&quot; in summer, while the upwards convection brings ceiling-hugging warm air back down throughout the room in winter.

==Classifications==
Ceiling fans can be classified into three main categories based on their use and functionality. Each type offers some unique advantages over the others and hence is suitable for a specific application. These include household, industrial and large-diameter fans.
* &quot;Household fans&quot; usually have 4, 5 or 6 wooden blades, a decorative motor housing, and a standard three speed motor with pull-chain switch control. These fans come in two varieties, with or without a light kit, depending on the price and consumer preferences.
* &quot;Commercial or industrial ceiling fans&quot; are typically used in stores, schools, churches, offices, factories, and warehouses. Such a fan is designed to be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than its household counterpart. Industrial or commercial ceiling fans typically use three or four blades, typically made of either steel or aluminum, and operate at high speed. These energy-efficient ceiling fans are designed to push massive amounts of air across large, wide open spaces. From the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, metal-bladed industrial ceiling fans were popular in lower-income American households, likely due to them being priced lower than wood-bladed models. Industrial style ceiling fans are very popular for household applications in Asia and the Middle East.

* &quot;HVLS fans&quot; are large-diameter ceiling fans, intended for large spaces such as large warehouses, hangars, shopping malls, railway platforms and gymnasiums. These fans generally spin at a lower speed but due to their large diameter, ranging between 7&#x27; and 24&#x27; (2.1 m and 7.3 m), can provide a large area with a gentle breeze. Modern HVLS fans use airfoil-style blades for optimized air movement at a reduced energy cost. One of the most notable manufactures of HVLS fans is Big Ass Fans.

* &quot;Indoor/outdoor ceiling fans&quot; are designed for use in partially enclosed or open outdoor spaces. The body and blades are made of materials and finishes that are not as drastically affected by moisture, temperature swings, or humidity as traditional materials and finishes. UL Damp-rated fans are suitable for covered outdoor areas like patios and porches that are not directly exposed to rainwater from above, as well as moisture-prone indoor areas such as bathrooms and laundry rooms. In open places where the fan may come in contact with water, one must use wet-rated fans. UL Wet-rated fans have a completely sealed motor which can withstand direct exposure to rainwater, snow and can even be washed off with a garden hose. Both industrial and residential fans come in dry-rated as well as damp and wet-rated varieties.

==Types==
Many styles of ceiling fans have been developed over the years in response to several different factors such as growing energy-consumption consciousness and changes in decorating styles. The advent and evolution of new technologies have also played a major role in ceiling fan development. Following is a list of major ceiling fan styles and their defining characteristics:
* &quot;Cast-iron ceiling fans.&quot; These account for almost all ceiling fans made since their invention in 1882 through the mid-1960s. A cast-iron housing encases a very heavy-duty motor, usually of the shaded-pole variety. These motors are lubricated by means of a thrust bearing submerged in an oil-bath and must be oiled periodically, usually once or twice per year. Because these fans are so sturdily built, and due to their utter lack of electronic components, it is not uncommon to see cast-iron fans aged eighty years or more running strong and still in use today.

** &quot;The Hunter &#x27;Original&quot;&#x27; (manufactured by the Hunter Fan Co.) is by far the most recognizable example of a cast-iron ceiling fan today. It has enjoyed the longest production run of any fan in history, dating from 1906 to the present day. The Hunter Original employed a shaded-pole motor from its inception until 1984 (the 91.44 cm Original remained shaded pole before it was replaced with the 106.68 cm Original in 1985), at which point it was changed to a much more efficient permanent split-capacitor motor. Though the fan&#x27;s physical appearance remains virtually unchanged, the motor was downgraded in 2002 when production was shipped to Taiwan; the motor, though still oil-lubricated, was switched to a &quot;skeletal&quot; design, as discussed below, with a shortened main shaft that inadvertently caused reliability issues. In 2015, this motor design was revised, and once again employs a full-length main shaft; the key element to the longevity of the pre-2002 motors.
* &quot;20 pole Induction &quot;Pancake&quot; motor ceiling fans.&quot; These fans with highly efficient cast aluminum housings, were invented in 1957 by Crompton-Greaves, Ltd of India and were first imported into the United States in 1973 by Encon Industries. This Crompton-Greaves motor was developed through a joint venture with Crompton-Parkinson of England and took 20 years to perfect. It is considered the most energy-efficient motor ever manufactured for ceiling fans (apart from the DC motor) since it consumes less energy than a household incandescent light bulb.
* &quot;Stack-motor ceiling fans.&quot; In the late 1970s, due to rising energy costs prompted by the energy crisis, Emerson adapted their &quot;K63&quot; motor, commonly used in household appliances and industrial machinery, to be used in ceiling fans. This new &quot;stack&quot; motor, along with Encon&#x27;s cast aluminum 20 pole motor, proved to be powerful, yet energy-efficient, and aided in the comeback of ceiling fans in America, since it was far less expensive to operate than air conditioning. With this design (which consists of a basic stator and rotor), the fan&#x27;s blades mount to a central hub, known as a flywheel. The flywheel which is made of either metal or reinforced rubber can be mounted either flush with the fan&#x27;s motor housing (concealed) or prominently below the fan&#x27;s motor housing (known as a &quot;dropped flywheel&quot;). Many manufacturers used and/or developed their own stack motors, including (but not limited to) Casablanca, Emerson, FASCO, Hunter, and NuTone. Some manufacturers trademarked their personal incarnation of this motor: for example, Emerson&#x27;s &quot;K63&quot; and later &quot;K55&quot; motors, Fanimation&#x27;s &quot;FDK-2100&quot;, and Casablanca&#x27;s &quot;XLP-2000&quot; and &quot;XLP-2100&quot;. The earliest stack-motor fan was the Emerson, which was an earlier version of the model that was later called &quot;Heat-Fan&quot;, a utilitarian fan with a dropped metal flywheel and blades made of fiberglass and later moulded plastic depending on the model. This fan was produced in numerous different forms from 1962 through 2005 and, while targeted at commercial settings, also found great success in residential settings. Casablanca Fan Co. also made stack-motor fans with concealed flywheels rather than dropped flywheels. While this motor is not nearly as widely used as in the 1970s and 1980s, it can still be found in Razzetii Italy brand. One disadvantage of this type of fan is that the flywheel, if it is made from rubber, will dry out and crack over time and eventually break; this is usually not dangerous, but it renders the fan inoperable until the flywheel is replaced.
* &quot;Direct-drive ceiling fans&quot; employ a motor with a stationary inner core with a shell, made of cast iron, cast aluminum, or stamped steel, that revolves around it (commonly called a &quot;spinner&quot; motor). The blades are attached directly to this shell. Direct-drive motors are the least expensive motors to produce, and on the whole are the most prone to failure and noise generation. While the very first motors of this type (first used in the 1960s) were relatively heavy-duty, the quality of these motors has dropped significantly in recent years. This type of motor has become the de facto standard for today&#x27;s fans; it is used in all Hampton Bay and Harbor Breeze ceiling fans sold today, and has commonly been used by most other brands.
** Spinner-motor fans, sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;spinners&quot;, employ a direct-drive (spinner) motor and &quot;do&quot; have a stationary decorative cover (motor housing). &quot;Spinner-motor&quot; fans account for nearly all fans manufactured from the late 1980s to the present.
** Spinner fans employ a direct-drive motor and do not have a stationary decorative cover (motor housing). This accounts for most industrial-style fans (though such fans sometimes have more moderate-quality motors), and inexpensive residential fans commonly found in Brazil, South Asia, Southeast Asia and many Middle Eastern countries.
* &quot;Skeletal motors&quot;, which are a high-end subset of direct-drive motors, can be found on some higher-quality fans. Examples of skeletal motors include Hunter&#x27;s &quot;AirMax&quot; motor, Casablanca&#x27;s &quot;XTR200&quot; motor, and the motors made by Sanyo for use in ceiling fans sold under the Lasko name, and post-2002 Hunter &quot;Original&quot; ceiling fans. Skeletal motors differ from regular direct-drive motors in that:
** They have an open-frame (&quot;skeletal&quot;) design, which allows for far better ventilation and therefore a longer lifespan. This is in comparison to a regular direct-drive motor&#x27;s design, in which the motor&#x27;s inner workings are completely enclosed within a tight metal shell which may or may not have openings for ventilation; even when openings are present, they are almost always small to the point of being inadequate.
** These are typically larger than regular direct-drive motors and, as a result, are more powerful and less prone to burning out. 
* &quot;Friction-drive ceiling fans.&quot; This short-lived type of ceiling fan was attempted by companies such as Emerson and NuTone in the late 1970s with little success. Its advantage was its tremendously low power consumption, but the fans were unreliable and very noisy, in addition to being grievously under-powered. Friction-drive ceiling fans employ a low-torque motor that is mounted transversely in relation to the flywheel. A rubber wheel mounted on the end of the motor&#x27;s shaft drove a hub (via contact friction, hence the name) which, in turn, drove the flywheel. It was a system based on the fact that a low-torque motor spinning quickly can drive a large, heavy device at a slow speed without great energy consumption &quot;(see Gear ratio)&quot;.
* &quot;Gear-drive ceiling fans.&quot; These were similar to (and even less common than) the friction drive models; however, instead of a rubber wheel on the motor shaft using friction to turn the flywheel, a toothed gear on the end of the motor shaft meshed with gear teeth formed into the flywheel, thus rotating it. The company &quot;Panama&quot; made gear driven ceiling fans and sold them exclusively through the &quot;Family Handyman&quot; magazine in the 1980s, and some HVLS ceiling fans have a gearbox motor.
* &quot;Internal belt-drive ceiling fans.&quot; These were also similar in design to gear-drive and friction-drive fans; however, instead of a rubber friction wheel or toothed gear, a small rubber belt linked the motor to the flywheel. The most notable internal belt-drive ceiling fans were the earliest models produced by the Casablanca Fan Co. and a model sold by Toastmaster.

* &quot;Belt-driven ceiling fans.&quot; As stated earlier in this article, the first ceiling fans used a water-powered system of belts to turn the blades of fan units (which consisted of nothing more than blades mounted on a flywheel). For period-themed decor, a few companies (notably Fanimation and Woolen Mill) have created reproduction belt-drive fan systems. The reproduction systems feature an electric motor as the driving force, in place of the water-powered motor.

* &quot;Orbit fans&quot; use a mechanism to oscillate 360 degrees. They are also typically flushed to the ceiling like hugger type fans. They are also very small in size, usually, about 40.64 cm and have a similar construction to that of many pedestal fans and desk fans, and usually have finger guards. These are once again, popular mostly in many developing countries as they are a cheap alternative to traditional paddle type ceiling fans. Many American manufacturers, such as &quot;Fanimation&quot; have started producing high quality designer versions of such fans.
* &quot;Mini ceiling fans&quot; are mostly found in less developed places, such as the Philippines and Indonesia, and today are constructed similarly to most oscillating pedestal and table fans, predominantly out of plastic. These fans, hence the name &quot;mini&quot; ceiling fan are relatively small in size, usually ranging from 40.64 cm to 91.44 cm, however, some still span to sizes as large as 106.68 cm in diameter. Additionally, unlike traditional ceiling fans, these fans typically use synchronous motors.
* &quot;Bladeless ceiling fans.&quot; This type was introduced in 2012 by Exhale fans and uses a bladeless turbine to push air outwards from the fan, which is also the case of regular ceiling fans on updraft mode. These fans feature a brushless DC motor instead of a normal direct-drive motor.
*A &quot;pendulum fan&quot; or &quot;flap fan&quot; is a type of low velocity ceiling fan that can be used for air circulation around a targeted area. The back and forth motion increases turbulence around cooling sources, like chilled waterfalls at the Lavin Bernick Center at Tulane, helping to cool a greater volume of air.
* &quot;Brushed DC ceiling fans.&quot; Before the current switched from DC to AC, there were productions of brushed DC ceiling fans. Those are wired directly to DC wires.
* &quot;Brushless DC ceiling fans.&quot; This type of fans uses BLDC technology which offers much higher efficiency than normal fans driven with traditional AC motors. These are quieter than AC motor fans due to the fact that they are commutated electronically and use permanent magnet rotors. Among the other advantages, these fans offer are high efficiency, lower noise level, less rotor heat, integration of remote control and other convenience technologies etc. The only drawbacks are the high cost and the presence of complex electronics which may be more prone to failure and difficult to service. However, with the advent of new technologies and better quality control techniques, the latter is becoming less of a concern. Those are wired to AC wires along with AC/DC adaptor.
* &quot;Smart ceiling fans.&quot; These fans can be controlled by Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa Assistant, Apple Homekit and Wifi. A vast majority of these fans use BLDC motors due to their microcontroller based design, flexibility in fine controls and firmware upgrade capability. The speed, brightness and timing of the fans can be adjusted with a smartphone app.

== Effects on airborne transmission and distribution ==
Ceiling fans provide a more affordable and energy-efficient alternative to air-conditioning, especially when used in conjunction with warmer room air temperature. Overall, the use of ceiling fans results in a lesser impact on global warming when looking at carbon generation suppression. In addition to improving thermal comfort and reducing energy consumption from air-conditioning, ceiling fans have also been studied as a tool that could potentially affect airborne transmission and distribution of infection. 

Ceiling fans affect the air and pollutant distribution in a space, including infectious aerosols. Ceiling fans may decrease the risk of transmission of infectious aerosols. 

An experiment using gas to simulate exhaled droplet nuclei found that ceiling fans could reduce the concentration of aerosols at the exposed person&#x27;s breathing zone by more than 20%. Ceiling fans were proven to have a more significant effect on the droplet and airborne transmission when the coughing infected person is located directly under the ceiling fan. Ceiling fans offer better protection from cough exposure for people located closer to the fan center, where the directed airflow changing particle trajectory downward to the floor is the greatest. 

A more realistic experiment using tracer particles found ceiling fans are effective in reducing the infection risks by 47% in short-range, but marginally increase infections risks in long-range transmissions. The benefits of ceiling fans are highest when the room is well ventilated, when masking measures are in place, and when the pathogen is not highly contagious. However if there are more people at long range distances, ceiling fans may cause more people to get sick by dispersing exhaled pathogens that are highly contagious, like measles and the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, even if the room follows the ASHRAE 241 recommendations. 

==Safety concerns with installation==
A typical ceiling fan weighs between 3.6 and 22.7 kg when fully assembled. While many junction boxes can support that weight while the fan is hanging still, a fan &quot;in operation&quot; exerts many additional stresses—notably torsion—on the object from which it is hung; this can cause an improper junction box to fail. For this reason, in the United States the National Electric Code (document NFPA 70, Article 314) states that ceiling fans must be supported by an electrical junction box listed for that use. It is a common mistake for homeowners to replace a light fixture with a ceiling fan without upgrading to a proper junction box. Ultimately, the weight of the fan must be carried by a strong structural element of the ceiling, such as a ceiling joist. Should an improperly mounted fan fall, especially a 22.7 kg cast iron fan, the result could be catastrophic.

===Low-hanging fans/danger to limbs===
Another concern with installing a ceiling fan relates to the height of the blades relative to the floor. Building codes throughout the United States prohibit residential ceiling fans from being mounted with the blades closer than seven feet from the floor; this sometimes proves, however, to not be high enough. If a ceiling fan is turned on and a person fully extends his or her arms into the air, as sometimes happens during normal tasks such as dressing, stretching or changing bedsheets, it is possible for the blades to strike their hands, potentially causing injury. Also, if one is carrying a long and awkward object, one end may inadvertently enter the path of rotation of a ceiling fan&#x27;s blades, which can cause damage to the fan. Building codes throughout the United States also prohibit industrial ceiling fans from being mounted with the blades closer than 10 feet from the floor for these reasons.

In other countries, ceiling fans usually come with a warning to install the fan so that the blades are 2.3 meters above the floor or higher, as instructed by the IEC and similar bodies. This rule applies to all &quot;high level fans&quot; including but not limited to ceiling fans.

In Australia, building codes require fans to be mounted at least 2.1 meters high. 

====&quot;MythBusters&quot;: &quot;Killer Ceiling Fan&quot;====
In 2004, &quot;MythBusters&quot; tested the idea that a ceiling fan is capable of decapitation if an individual was to stick his or her neck into a running fan. Two versions of the myth were tested, with the first being the &quot;jumping kid&quot;, involving a kid jumping up and down on a bed, jumping too high and entering the fan from below and the second being the &quot;lover&#x27;s leap&quot;, involving a husband leaping towards his bed and entering the fan side-on. Kari Byron and Scottie Chapman purchased a regular household fan and also an industrial fan, which has metal blades as opposed to wood and a more powerful motor. They busted the myth in both scenarios with both household and industrial fans, as tests proved that residential ceiling fans are, apparently by design, largely incapable of causing more than a minor injury, having low-torque motors that stop quickly when blocked and blades composed of light materials that tend to break easily if impacted at speed (the household fan test of the &quot;lover&#x27;s leap&quot; scenario actually broke the fan blades.) They did find that industrial fans, with their steel blades and higher speeds, proved capable of causing injury and laceration—building codes require industrial fans to be mounted with blades 3.048 m above the floor, and the industrial fan test of the &quot;lover&#x27;s leap&quot; scenario produced a lethal injury where the fan sliced through the jugular and into the vertebrae—but still lost energy rapidly once blocked and were unable to decapitate the test dummy.

===Wobble===
Wobbling is usually caused by the weight of fan blades being out of balance with each other. This can happen due to a variety of factors, including blades being warped, blade irons being bent, blades or blade irons not being screwed on straight, or weight variation between blades. Also, if all the blades do not exert an equal force on the air (because they have different angles, for instance), the vertical reaction forces can cause wobbling. Wobble can also be caused by a motor flaw, but that very rarely occurs. Wobbling is not affected by the way in which the fan is mounted or the mounting surface.

Contrary to popular misconception, wobbling alone will not cause a ceiling fan to fall. Ceiling fans are secured by clevis pins locked with either split pins or R-clips, so wobbling will not have an effect on the fan&#x27;s security, unless of course, the pins/clips were not secured. To date, there are no reports of a fan wobbling itself off the ceiling and falling. However, a severe wobble can cause light fixture shades or covers to gradually loosen over time and potentially fall, posing a risk of injury to anyone under the fan, and also from any resulting broken glass. When the MythBusters were designing a fan with the goal of chopping off someone&#x27;s head, Scottie used an edge finder to find the exact center of their blades with the aim of eliminating potentially very dangerous wobbling of their steel blades.

Wobbling may be reduced by measuring the tip of each blade from a fixed point on the ceiling (or floor) and ensuring each is equal. If the fan has a metal plate between the motor and blade, this may be gently adjusted by bending. It can also be reduced by making sure all blades have the same pitch, and all blades have the same distance from adjacent blades. It can also be reduced by having balancing weight on the blades.

Even a very slight wobble can also cause a pull chain to swing, if fan is at right RPM, and as the pull chain swings, it can weaken the part that flexes, which can eventually cause it to break, meaning that a pull chain can fall on someone.

Wobble in some case can cause wires inside the motor to wriggle, and then eventually reach the top of the motor, which can then yank the wires out of the windings. That is fixable, but it may not be very easy to fix.

=== Humming ===
Humming is often caused by using a dimmer switch or a solid state speed control (those are usually made for industrial setting where humming noise is acceptable) to control the fan speed, since those controls cause chopping current, which causes windings to vibrate. Humming can also be caused by a bad start/run capacitor, or a capacitor with a wrong capacitance size for the motor. A bad or wrong start/run capacitor causes the winding current phase on main windings and auxiliary windings to not sync properly and can cause a hum. Also, humming may be reduced by having windings varnished.

<text>Thomas Dashiff Gilovich (born January 16, 1954) is an American psychologist who is the Irene Blecker Rosenfeld Professor of Psychology at Cornell University. He has conducted research in social psychology, decision making, and behavioral economics, and has written popular books on these subjects. Gilovich has collaborated with Daniel Kahneman, Richard Nisbett, Lee Ross and Amos Tversky. His articles in peer-reviewed journals on subjects such as cognitive biases have been widely cited. In addition, Gilovich has been quoted in the media on subjects ranging from the effect of purchases on happiness to people&#x27;s most common regrets, to perceptions of people and social groups. Gilovich is a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.

==Early history and education==

Gilovich earned his B.A. from the University of California, Santa Barbara and his PhD from Stanford University. After hearing Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman give a lecture about judgment and decision making in his very first classroom experience there, Gilovich changed his program of research to focus on the intersection of social psychology and judgment and decision making . He went on to earn his Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford in 1981.

==Research in social and cognitive psychology==

Gilovich is best known for his research in heuristics and biases in the field of social psychology. He describes his research as dealing with &quot;how people evaluate the evidence of their everyday experience to make judgments, form beliefs, and decide on courses of action, and how they sometimes misevaluate that evidence and make faulty judgments, form dubious beliefs, and embark on counterproductive courses of action.&quot; According to Google Scholar, he has an h-index of 77 for all his published academic papers, which is considered exceptional.
The focus of Gilovich&#x27;s work is reflected in two influential texts, &quot;Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment&quot; (with Dale Griffin and Daniel Kahneman) and &quot;Social Psychology&quot; (with Serena Chen, Dacher Keltner and Robert Nisbett), both of which are used as textbooks in academic courses in psychology and social psychology throughout the USA.
Summarizing the research in an interview when asked what the benefits are, he responded, &quot;I think that field has an enormous amount to offer, because we make consequential decisions all the time, and they aren&#x27;t always easy, we don&#x27;t always do them well,&quot; and that his research program is about trying to figure out how the mind works so we &quot;understand why some decisions are easy, and we tend to do certain things very well, and why some decisions are difficult, and we tend to do them poorly.&quot; He further explained that his hope is that he and his colleagues are &quot;providing lots of information to help us understand those difficult decisions, and give people the tools so that they can make better decisions so they less often in life are going down paths that don&#x27;t serve them well.&quot;

Gilovich condensed his academic research in judgement and decision making into a popular book, &quot;How We Know What Isn&#x27;t So&quot;. Writing in &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, Carl Sagan called it &quot;a most illuminating book&quot; that &quot;shows how people systematically err in understanding numbers, in rejecting unpleasant evidence, in being influenced by the opinions of others. We&#x27;re good in some things, but not in everything. Wisdom lies in understanding our limitations.&quot; Reviewing the book for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, George Johnson wrote, &quot;Over time, the ability to infer rules about the way the world works from skimpy evidence confers a survival advantage, even if much of the time the lessons are wrong. From evolution&#x27;s standpoint, it is better to be safe than sorry.&quot; In an interview, Gilovich summarized the thesis of &quot;How We Know What Isn&#x27;t So&quot; as people &quot;thinking we really have the evidence for things, [that] the world is telling us something, but in fact the world is telling us something a little more complicated, and how is it that we can misread the evidence of our everyday experience, and be convinced that something is true when it really isn&#x27;t.&quot; He further elaborated on some of the erroneous beliefs his book discusses, including the &quot;sophomore jinx&quot;, the idea that things such as natural disasters come in threes, and the belief that the lines we are in slow down but the lines we leave speed up. In the same interview he called confirmation bias the &quot;mother of all biases.&quot;

==Notable contributions in biases and heuristics research==

Through his published work in biases and heuristics, Gilovich has made notable contributions to the field through the following concepts:

===Hot hands===

Gilovich&#x27;s research in the alleged &quot;hot hand&quot; effect, or the belief that success in a particular endeavor, usually sports, will likely be followed by further success, has been particularly influential. A paper he wrote with Amos Tversky in 1985 became the benchmark on the subject for years. Some of the research from the 1985 paper has been contested recently, with a new journal article arguing that Gilovich and his coauthors themselves fell victim to a cognitive bias in interpreting the data from the original study. Specifically, that in a truly random situation, a hit would be expected to be followed by another hit less than 50 percent of the time, but if one hit followed another at 50 percent, that would be evidence for the hot hand. 

===Spotlight effect===

The spotlight effect, the phenomenon where people tend to believe that they&#x27;re noticed more than they really are, is a term Gilovich coined. In a paper he wrote with two graduate students in 1999, he explained that &quot;because we are so focused on our own behavior, it can be difficult to arrive at an accurate assessment of how much–or how little–our behavior is noticed by others. Indeed, close inspection reveals frequent disparities between the way we view our performance (and think others will view it) and the way it is actually seen by others.&quot; 
For the paper, Gilovich and his coauthors conducted an experiment asking college students to put on a Barry Manilow shirt and walk into a room of strangers facing the door. The researchers predicted that the students would assume that more people would notice their T-shirt than was actually true. The results were as predicted, with participants thinking that roughly half the strangers would have recognized the Barry Manilow shirt, when in fact the number was closer to 20 percent.

===Bias blind spot===

Gilovich has contributed to an understanding of bias blind spot, or the tendency to recognize biases in other people, but not in ourselves. Several studies he coauthored found that people tend to believe that their own personal connection to a given issue is a source of accuracy and enlightenment, but that such personal connections in the case of others who hold different views are a source of bias. Similarly, he has found that people look to external behavior in evaluating biases in others, but engage in introspection when evaluating their own. Two examples he gave in a talk are that both older and younger siblings felt the other were held to a higher standard, and that Democrats and Republicans both felt that the electoral college helped the other side more than their own party.

===Clustering illusion===

Gilovich was an early author in the clustering illusion, which is closely related to the &quot;hot hand&quot; fallacy, and is the tendency to see &quot;clusters&quot; of data in a random sequence of data as nonrandom. In &quot;How We Know What Isn&#x27;t So&quot;, Gilovich explains how people want to see a sequence such as as planned, even though it was arbitrary. In addition, he stated that people tend to misjudge randomness, thinking that rolling the same number on dice 4 times in a row is not truly random, when in fact it is.

===Illusion of transparency===

Building on his research on the spotlight effect, Gilovich helped to discover the illusion of transparency, or the tendency to overestimate the extent to which people telegraph their inner thoughts and emotions. In a study he conducted with two coauthors in 1998, individuals read questions from index cards and answered them out loud. They either lied or told the truth based on what the card said to do on a label only they could see. Half of the liars thought they had been caught, but in fact only a quarter were, hence the illusion of transparency. In addition, they found in the same study that in an emergency situation, people assumed the emergency and concern would show in their expression and behavior, but it didn&#x27;t, which the authors believe partially explains the bystander effect: &quot;When confronted with a potential emergency, people typically play it cool, adopt a look of nonchalance, and monitor the reactions of others to determine if a crisis is really at hand. No one wants to overreact, after all, if it might not be a true emergency. However, because each individual holds back, looks nonchalant, and monitors the reactions of others, sometimes everyone concludes (perhaps erroneously) that the situation is not an emergency and hence does not require intervention.&quot;

===Regret===

Gilovich has researched the causes of regret. A study he conducted in 1994 found that specific actions people wish they hadn&#x27;t taken are regretted more in the short run, but ultimately, inactions are regretted more in the long run. He has continued to emphasize that people tend to regret the things they don&#x27;t do more than the things they did.

===Anchoring===

Following Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, Gilovich and his colleagues have conducted research in anchoring, the tendency to anchor on information that comes to mind and adjust until a plausible estimate is reached when making decisions. A study he co-authored with Nicholas Epley found that anchoring is actually several different effects, and the multiple causes are at play. Another study that Gilovich and Nicholas Epley coauthored found that once an anchor is set, people adjust away from it, though their adjustments tend to be insufficient, so their final guess is close to the initial anchor.

===Self-handicapping===

In his social psychology research, Gilovich discovered the phenomenon of &quot;self-handicapping&quot;, which he described as &quot;attempts to manage how others perceive us by controlling the attributions they make for our performance.&quot; An example of self-handicapping, according to Gilovich, would be drawing attention to elements that inhibit performance, and so discount failure in others&#x27; eyes, or make success the result of overcoming insurmountable odds. The self-handicapping can either be real (failing to study or drinking excessively), or faked (merely claiming that there were difficult obstacles present). Gilovich has stated that the strategy is most common in sports and undergraduate academics, but that it often backfires.

==Research in behavioral economics==

Besides his contributions to the field of social psychology, Gilovich&#x27;s research in cognitive psychology has influenced the field of behavioral economics. Gilovich has written a popular book condensing his academic research in the field, and which touches on many of the topics in &quot;How We Know What Isn&#x27;t So&quot;, &quot;The Wisest One in the Room: How You Can Benefit from Social Psychology&#x27;s Most Powerful Insights&quot;. In an interview with Brian Lehrer, Gilovich discussed the book and the subjects it touches on, such as the difference between intelligence and wisdom, the latter being knowledge of other people and how to connect with them, the negative impact of income inequality on happiness, motivation, and what can create &quot;virtuous cycles&quot; in a university environment. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; gave it a positive review, writing, &quot;The authors leap from personal behavior and motivation in the first half into societal, cultural, and even international change in the second, offering suggestions, if not necessarily a working blueprint, for how to achieve goals such as global environmental responsibility. None of this is riveting reading, but it rarely lapses into academic jargon.&quot;

===Experiential purchases===

A major recurring theme in Gilovich&#x27;s work in behavioral economics is the importance of experience over ownership of material things. For instance, a paper he co-authored with Leaf Van Boven found that people overwhelmingly preferred &quot;experiential purchases&quot; to &quot;material purchases.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, James Hamblin noted the growing body of research, pioneered by Gilovich, showing that experiences tend to bring people more happiness than possessions: &quot;It&#x27;s the fleetingness of experiential purchases that endears us to them. Either they&#x27;re not around long enough to become imperfect, or they are imperfect, but our memories and stories of them get sweet with time. Even a bad experience becomes a good story.&quot; In a talk about barriers to gratitude, Gilovich further noted that a survey of his students at Cornell found that they enjoyed their conversations about their experiences than their material purchases, and that happiness from experiential purchases is more enduring than that from material purchases. The reason being that experiences make for better stories, cultivate personal identity more, and connect people to each other. Gilovich explained that the implication is that experiential purchases lead to more gratitude and thus to more pro-social behavior. In addition, Gilovich has emphasized the importance of being active and seeking goals: &quot;We evolved to be goal-striving creatures. You’ll regret more the things that you didn’t do rather than the things you did.&quot; Along similar lines, in one talk he urged his audience, &quot;mind your peaks and ends. You won’t remember the length of your vacation experience, but you’ll remember the intensity. And do something special at the end.&quot;

<doc id="881904" wikidata="Q6187845" url="?curid=881904" title="Jessie Tuggle">
<text>Jessie Lloyd Tuggle Jr. (born April 4, 1965) is an American former professional football player who spent his entire career as a linebacker for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL) from 1987 to 2000. He played college football for the Valdosta State Blazers. He appeared in the Pro Bowl five times, and played in Super Bowl XXXIII. His nickname is &quot;the Hammer&quot;, because of the impact of his tackles.

== Early life ==
Tuggle was born in 1965 in Spalding County, Georgia, and attended Griffin High School. He played football at Griffin as an outside linebacker and offensive guard.

Tuggle was considered &quot;too small&quot; (five-foot-10 and 180 pounds) and &quot;too slow&quot; to play Division I college football. He was not recruited by any Division I programs and received only two Division II offers. He accepted an offer from Valdosta State University and was a four-year starter at linebacker from 1983 to 1986. He broke Valdosta&#x27;s career record with 340 tackles. He was a three-time All-Gulf South Conference selection and his No. 88 was retired less than a decade after Tuggle left.

In 2007, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

==Atlanta Falcons==
After going undrafted, Tuggle signed with the Atlanta Falcons through a chance encounter. During training camp, myriad injuries at linebacker gave Tuggle playing time and a shot at making the roster (which he did).

After being a role player his rookie season, he recorded 108 tackles by virtue of eight starts. Becoming a bona fide star on the Atlanta defense, marked by the 1989-1993 period in which Tuggle racked up 969 tackles. During that stretch, he made his first Pro Bowl appearance in 1992. Even while the Falcons languished, Tuggle never thought of leaving in free agency, even when he would meet former teammates like Brett Favre. This endeared him to many Atlanta fans, who consider him one of the greatest and most beloved Falcons of all time.

After being with the Falcons through some tough years, the high point in Tuggle&#x27;s career was 1998, when he played in Super Bowl XXXIII and was voted to the Pro Bowl.

Tuggle retired during training camp in 2001 after injuries plagued the end of his career.

In his 14 NFL seasons, Tuggle appeared in 209 games (189 as a starter) and recorded 1,640 tackles (164 assisted), 21 sacks, six interceptions, which he returned for 106 yards and a touchdown, 10 forced fumbles and 37 pass deflections. He also recovered 10 fumbles, returning them for 155 yards and an NFL record five touchdowns.

He and his former teammate Clay Matthews Jr. are the only two players to lead the NFL in tackles four times. Tuggle also holds the record for most tackles from 1990 to 1999 with 1,293. At the time of his retirement, he held the NFL record for touchdowns via fumble recoveries with five.

<text>James Patrick Edmonds (born June 27, 1970) is an American former professional baseball center fielder and a broadcaster for Bally Sports Midwest. He played for the California/Anaheim Angels, St. Louis Cardinals, San Diego Padres, Chicago Cubs, Milwaukee Brewers, and Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1993 to 2010.

Edmonds was well known for his defensive abilities, earning eight Gold Glove Awards. He also was a prolific hitter, batting .284 with 393 home runs and an on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) of .903. He is affectionately known by Cardinal fans as &quot;Jimmy Baseball&quot; or &quot;Jimmy Ballgame&quot;.

==Early life==
Edmonds was born on June 27, 1970, in Fullerton, California. His parents divorced when he was a child and had joint custody. His father&#x27;s home was within a few miles of Anaheim Stadium. He attended Diamond Bar High School in Diamond Bar, in eastern Los Angeles County.

==Professional career==
===California / Anaheim Angels===
====1988–1993: Minor leagues====
Edmonds was selected in the seventh round of the 1988 Major League Baseball draft by the California Angels. He had injured his shoulder in his senior year of high school, causing him to fall in the draft.

Following the draft, he was assigned to the Bend Bucks, the Angels&#x27; A-Short Season affiliate in the Northwest League. In 1988, he played in 35 games for the Bucks and hit .221 with no home runs and 13 runs batted in. The following year, he was promoted to the Quad Cities Angels, the team&#x27;s Class-A affiliate in the Midwest League. He played in 31 games and hit .261 with 1 home run and 4 RBIs.

In 1990, Edmonds advanced to the Palm Springs Angels, the Angels&#x27; High-A affiliate in the California League. He played 91 games and hit .293 with 3 home runs and 56 RBIs. He remained with Palm Springs for the 1991 season, playing 60 games while batting .294 with two home runs and 27 RBIs. In 1992, he was promoted to Double-A with the Midland Angels in the Texas League. He hit .313 with eight home runs and 32 RBIs in 70 games for Midland. He was promoted again in 1992, moving up to the Triple-A Edmonton Trappers for 50 games, batting .299 with six home runs and 36 RBIs. In 1993, Edmonds played for the new Angels Triple-A affiliate, the Vancouver Canadians. He played 95 games for the team, batting .315 and hitting nine home runs with 74 RBIs.

====1993–1996: Emergence as a power hitter====
On September 7, 1993, the Angels promoted Edmonds to the majors for the first time. He made his MLB debut on September 9, starting in left field against the Detroit Tigers at Tiger Stadium, going 0-for-4 with two strikeouts. Edmonds collected his first major league hit on September 10 against the Toronto Blue Jays in the SkyDome, a pinch-hit double in the ninth inning off of Duane Ward. Edmonds collected his first major league RBI on September 14 against Seattle Mariners pitcher Roger Salkeld, driving in Chad Curtis with a single. In his September call-up 1993 season, Edmonds batted .246 in 61 at-bats across 18 games.

Despite the signings of outfielders Bo Jackson and Dwight Smith in the offseason, Edmonds made the Angels&#x27; 1994 Opening Day roster. Edmonds received sporadic playing time for the first half of the season, often pinch hitting and rarely starting games. He did not hit his first major league home run until May 11, 1994, in a game against the Texas Rangers where he hit a two-run shot off Rick Helling. Through his first 50 games in 1994, Edmonds was batting .328 with a .405 on-base percentage. By June, Edmonds began to receive more regular playing time, serving as the primary left fielder after Bo Jackson had been benched and Dwight Smith had been traded to Baltimore. Midway through the season, Edmonds was considered by the media to be a prime candidate for the AL Rookie of the Year Award. Although Edmonds&#x27;s high averages regressed as he played more games, he finished the strike-shortened season batting .273 with five home runs and 37 RBIs. He placed eighth in AL Rookie of the Year voting.

With the departure of Chad Curtis in the offseason, Edmonds became the Angels&#x27; everyday center fielder for the 1995 season. In his new role as the team&#x27;s primary center fielder, Edmonds also emerged as a formidable power hitter; he only had 29 home runs in his six-year minor league career and five in his true rookie season, leading to him being initially recognized as a contact hitter when coupled with his high batting averages. Edmonds did not hit any home runs through the first 17 games of the 1995 season, but hit six with an .857 slugging percentage in an eight-game stretch from May 15 to May 23. Edmonds received his first All-Star Game selection in 1995 and was batting .291 with 13 home runs and 52 RBIs at the All-Star break. Edmonds finished the 1995 season batting .290 with 33 home runs and 107 RBIs.

Edmonds returned to the Angels in 1996 as one of the team&#x27;s best all-around hitters. On March 7, he agreed to a four-year, $9.5 million contract extension with the Angels that included a team option in the fifth year. He suffered groin and stomach injuries on May 25, sidelining him for a month. Edmonds returned to the field on June 10 but sprained his thumb the following day, causing him to be out for another month. He returned to action on July 18, going 2-for-5 with a home run against the Seattle Mariners. Edmonds finished the 1996 season batting .304 with 27 home runs and 66 RBIs.

====1997–1999: Gold Glove selections====
Edmonds, along with Tim Salmon, Garret Anderson, and Darin Erstad, comprised a group of four outfielders that emerged as viable options for the Angels in the mid-1990s. This created a dilemma for the team&#x27;s front office, who sought to have all four players serve as everyday starters. As a result, the Angels traded designated hitter Chili Davis and first baseman J. T. Snow for pitching in the 1996–97 offseason in order to create playing time for all four outfielders. Amid the positional shakeup, Edmonds was able to stay in center field while Erstad moved to first base. Edmonds received recognition for his defensive prowess in 1997, often making highlight reels. During a June 10, 1997, game against the Kansas City Royals, Edmonds ran straight back towards the center field wall of Kauffman Stadium and dove outstretched for a fly ball over his head, making the catch on the warning track. The catch is widely viewed as one of the greatest defensive plays in baseball history, with Joe Posnanski of &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranking it as the 29th-greatest moment in all of baseball history. In the 1997 season, Edmonds batted .291 and hit 26 home runs with 80 RBIs. Following the season, he received his first career Gold Glove Award.

In September 1998, the division-leading Angels fell behind the Texas Rangers in the standings, ultimately losing the division and missing out on the playoffs. Edmonds, despite batting .340 that month with five home runs and 20 RBIs, was criticized by some teammates for his purported nonchalance towards the Angels&#x27; late-season elimination. In an interview, Edmonds said that he wasn&#x27;t &quot;going to come in the next day and want to kill himself&quot; if the Angels were mathematically eliminated. In 1998, Edmonds played a career-high 154 games, hitting .307 with 25 home runs and 91 RBIs. He received his second career Gold Glove Award.

During spring training in 1999, Edmonds tore the labrum in his right shoulder while lifting weights, aggravating an injury he had been playing through for several years prior. He underwent surgery to correct the injury, sidelining him for the first half of the season. In addition to the deactivating surgery, tensions were also rising in the clubhouse as some teammates were taking exception to Edmonds&#x27;s alleged nonchalant, dismissive attitude. These factors created doubt that the Angels would bring back Edmonds after the 1999 season. Team newcomer Mo Vaughn, who had yet to share the field with Edmonds, accused him of not accepting responsibility for team struggles. Edmonds returned to the field as a designated hitter on August 2, 1999, going 2-for-4 against the Texas Rangers with a double. He returned to center field on August 7. He finished his abbreviated 1999 season batting .250 with 5 home runs and 23 RBIs in 55 games.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
====2000–2003: Immediate production====
On March 23, 2000, the Angels traded Edmonds to the St. Louis Cardinals for second baseman Adam Kennedy and pitcher Kent Bottenfield. Five days prior, Angels general manager Bill Stoneman had told Edmonds that he would not be traded, but plans purportedly changed when St. Louis made Kennedy available.

Edmonds made his Cardinals debut on April 3, 2000, going 0-for-3 with 2 walks against the Chicago Cubs. He recorded his first hit, home run, and RBI as a Cardinal the following day. Through his first 50 games, Edmonds batted .371 with 16 home runs and 39 RBIs. He received his second career All-Star selection, starting in the game in place of the injured Ken Griffey Jr., going 1-for-2 with a hit off David Wells. Edmonds finished the year batting .295 with 42 home runs and 108 RBIs. He received his third career Gold Glove Award and finished fourth in National League Most Valuable Player Award voting. In the postseason, Edmonds batted .361 with 3 home runs and 12 RBIs in 8 games.

In 2001, Edmonds batted .304 with 30 home runs and 110 RBIs. He received his second consecutive Gold Glove Award, the fourth of his career. In the 2001 National League Division Series, Edmonds batted .235 with two home runs and three RBIs.

In 2002, Edmonds batted a career-high .311 with 28 home runs and 83 RBIs. He was awarded his third consecutive Gold Glove Award, the fifth of his career. In the 2002 postseason, Edmonds batted .355 with two home runs and six RBIs through eight games.

In 2003, Edmonds received his third career All-Star selection. Through the All-Star break, he batted .303 with 28 home runs and 67 RBIs. Edmonds started in center field in the All-Star game and batted second, going 1-for-2 with a first-inning single off AL starter Esteban Loaiza. Edmonds slumped after the All-Star break, batting .214 with 11 home runs and 22 RBIs. He finished the season batting .275 with 39 home runs and 89 RBIs. He received his fourth consecutive Gold Glove Award, the sixth of his career.

====2004–2007: Postseason success====

The 2004 season was among the statistically best for Edmonds. He hit .301, had a .643 slugging percentage, 42 home runs, and 111 RBI; all but batting average were career highs. As a result, he earned a Silver Slugger Award, a Gold Glove Award, and was fifth in the voting for the NL Most Valuable Player Award. During a Chicago Cubs-Cardinals game at Wrigley Field on July 19, 2004, pitcher Carlos Zambrano was ejected from the game for throwing at Edmonds. Zambrano screamed at Edmonds as he rounded the bases on a home run, earning Zambrano a five-game suspension. Edmonds, along with Albert Pujols and Scott Rolen, earned the nickname &quot;MV3&quot; for their standout 2004 seasons. Edmonds was on the cover of video game &quot;MLB Slugfest&quot; in 2004. A defining moment of Edmonds&#x27; career came in the 2004 National League Championship Series, in which Edmonds hit a twelfth-inning home run to win Game 6. In Game 7, Edmonds made a spectacular defensive play in center, helping the Cardinals win the pennant.

In 2005, Edmonds hit .263 with 29 home runs and 89 RBIs, earning his fourth career All-Star selection. During Game 4 of the 2005 National League Championship Series, Edmonds was ejected in the eighth inning for arguing a strike call made by home plate umpire Phil Cuzzi. Edmonds later said that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t trying to show up&quot; Cuzzi and said that Cuzzi responded profanely, a claim that was not contested. In 9 postseason games in 2005, Edmonds batted .267 with a home run, one RBI, and three doubles.

On Mother&#x27;s Day in 2006, Edmonds was one of more than 50 hitters who used a pink bat to benefit the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation. Late in the 2006 season, Edmonds began having trouble with fielding that plagued the rest of his tenure with St. Louis. On June 21, he crashed into the wall of U.S. Cellular Field while playing against the Chicago White Sox trying to rob a home run ball. Intermittent bouts of nausea, dizziness, and blurred vision followed in the next few weeks for him, particularly intensifying on diving attempts. Two months after the crash, he was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome. In the 2006 postseason, Edmonds helped the St. Louis Cardinals win their first World Series title since 1982 while having 13 total hits in the postseason with two home runs while batting in all 16 games.

He batted .252 in 117 games in 2007 while hitting 12 home runs with 53 runs batted in.

===Later career===
====2008–2009: Padres, Cubs, and off-year====
On December 14, 2007, the Cardinals traded Edmonds to the San Diego Padres in exchange for prospect David Freese. As part of the deal, the Cardinals also agreed to pay part of Edmonds&#x27;s 2008 salary. Edmonds&#x27; 241 home runs with the Cardinals are the fourth-most in franchise history. On May 9, 2008, the Padres released him after hitting only .178 with one home run in 90 at-bats.

On May 14, 2008, the Chicago Cubs, in need of a left-handed bat, signed Edmonds to a one-year contract of which the Cubs were only responsible for the league minimum. He started the next day against his former team, the Padres, and went 1-for-4. Edmonds was not well-received initially by the fans in Chicago, but after joining the Cubs, he hit over .300 with eight home runs in his first six weeks. On June 21, 2008, Edmonds hit two home runs in the fourth inning against the Chicago White Sox.

Edmonds did not play in 2009 because he did not receive what he considered a good offer. In January 2010, he announced his intention to return to the majors, saying, &quot;Last year was a mistake. I should have played somewhere.&quot;

====2010–2011: Return and retirement====
On January 28, 2010, Edmonds signed a minor league deal with the Milwaukee Brewers. The Brewers added him to the major league roster on March 25.

On August 9, 2010, Edmonds was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Chris Dickerson. Both Edmonds and Dickerson had to clear waivers because the non-waiver trade deadline had already passed.

On February 4, 2011, Edmonds signed a minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals; however, after continuing symptoms from a strained Achilles tendon suffered during the 2010 season, Edmonds officially announced his retirement from baseball on February 18, 2011.

==Broadcasting career==
On March 14, 2013, Fox Sports Midwest announced that they had hired Edmonds to join their St. Louis Cardinals broadcasting crew. Edmonds initially served as an analyst during &quot;Cardinals Live&quot; pre-game and post-game broadcasts. He replaced Cal Eldred, a former Cardinal pitcher who had broadcast for FSM for four years and was moving on to become a special assistant in the Cardinals organization. Since 2016, Edmonds has alternated between the &quot;Cardinals Live&quot; studio role and serving as a color commentator in the booth for certain games.

Edmonds has expressed a desire to one day be a part of the Cardinals ownership group.

==Personal life==

Edmonds has two daughters from his first marriage, to Lee Ann Horton, who died of cancer in 2015.

He has a son and a daughter from his second marriage, to Allison Jayne Raski, which lasted from 2008 to 2014.

Edmonds married Meghan O&#x27;Toole King on October 24, 2014. She joined the cast of &quot;The Real Housewives of Orange County&quot; in 2015; Edmonds appeared on the show. They welcomed a daughter on Thanksgiving Day 2016 and twin boys on June 5, 2018. On October 25, 2019, the day after their fifth wedding anniversary, Edmonds filed for divorce.

Edmonds married Kortnie O&#x27;Connor in 2022.

Edmonds and his family live in Frontenac, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis.

===Business ventures===
Edmonds opened several restaurants with business partner Mark Winfield. The pair opened their first restaurant in 2007, while Edmonds was still playing for the Cardinals. Called Jim Edmonds 15 Steakhouse, it closed in September 2013. 
Within a few months, they opened a new restaurant in the space called The Precinct; it would close in May 2015.

In 2015, they opened a BBQ-style restaurant called Winfield&#x27;s Gathering Place in Kirkwood, Missouri; it closed on July 2, 2016.

==Awards==

Edmonds&#x27; fielding ability has earned him recognition from Major League coaches and managers, who voted him a Rawlings Gold Glove winner eight times in nine seasons from 1997 to 2005.

ESPN&#x27;s Rob Neyer lists Edmonds as No. 12 of the top 100 players of the first decade of the 21st century due to his productivity at the plate and gold-glove skills in center field.

On August 8, 2014, Edmonds was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame. He was announced as a candidate for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum on November 9, 2015, but was removed from the ballot on January 6, 2016, after only receiving 2.5% of the vote in his first year of eligibility.

<text>Clarence James Brown Sr. (July 14, 1893 – August 23, 1965) was an American politician; he represented Ohio as a Republican in the United States House of Representatives from 1939 until his death in Bethesda, Maryland in 1965. Long representing conservative views, near the end of his life, he helped gain House passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which he voted for to provide enforcement of the right to vote for all citizens, while also voting in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, 1960, and 1964.

As president of Brown Publishing Company from 1920, he created a huge media company that lasted for 90 years. In 1918, at age 25, Brown was elected as the 36th lieutenant governor of Ohio, the youngest man to gain that post.

==Life and career==
Brown was born in Blanchester, Clinton County, Ohio or West Union, Clermont County, Ohio, the son of Owen and Ellen Barerre (née McCoppin) Brown. He attended the Blanchester public schools, and then attended law school at Washington and Lee University, in Lexington, Virginia, from 1913 to 1915.

On his twenty-first birthday, Brown married Ethel McKinney. He worked as state statistician in 1915 and 1916 in the Ohio Secretary of State&#x27;s office.

Brown began newspaper work in Blanchester in 1917, where he published several country newspapers. He became president of the Brown Publishing Company in Blanchester, and also owned and operated several large farms in the Blanchester area. He directed Brown Publishing for the rest of his life.

==Political career==

In 1918, at 25, Brown was elected as the 36th Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, serving from 1919 to 1923; he was the youngest man ever to hold the office. In 1926, he was elected Ohio Secretary of State and served from 1927 to 1933.

In 1921, at the height of the Ku Klux Klan&#x27;s power in Ohio, Brown supported federal civil rights legislation to stop the lynching of African-Americans. In 1938, prior to his first election as U.S. representative, he was one of only 67 (of 870) candidates for U.S. House along with only 8 (out of 96) sitting Senators to pledge support to the NAACP for federal anti-lynching legislation, the legislative precursor to modern civil rights legislation. In 1940, during debate of the anti-lynching bill he stated:

In 1947, during floor debate involving Adam Clayton Powell Jr. (D–NY) and John E. Rankin (D–MS), Brown forced a rule change from Speaker Joseph W. Martin Jr. (R–MA) to prohibit racially offensive language from being used on the House floor.

Brown twice ran for governor of Ohio. In 1932, he lost the primary. In 1934, he won the Republican nomination but lost the general election. Brown was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1936, 1940, 1944 and 1948 and a member of the Republican National Committee from 1944.

Brown was elected in 1938 as a Republican to the Seventy-sixth and to the thirteen succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1939 until his death in 1965. While in Congress, he was chairman of the Select Committee on Newsprint in the Eightieth Congress; he was a personal friend of Democrat Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn of Texas.

In the 1930s and 1940s, Brown staunchly opposed President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies to expand the federal bureaucracy. He also opposed expanding U.S. foreign military entanglements until the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, in March 1941 he voted in favor of providing increased military aid to the United Kingdom during that country&#x27;s war against Nazi Germany. Following World War II, Brown warned against the continuation and expansion of foreign aid programs that were meant to be temporary. When Harry S. Truman became president, Brown opposed his Fair Deal, viewing it as corrupt cronyism through the expansion of federal bureaucracy.

Brown cosponsored legislation to create the Hoover Commission to study and reform the federal government and served on the commission, formally the Commission on the Organization of the Executive Branch of Government.

By the 1950s, Brown was the ranking minority member of the important Rules Committee in Congress. In the 1960s, he worked with its chairman, the Democrat Howard W. Smith of Virginia, to block expansive federal legislation sought by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Smith was a senior member of the Southern Bloc, which was established by white Democrats at the turn of the 20th century, when the former Confederate States disfranchised blacks. However, near the end of his life, Brown convinced the segregationist Smith to allow landmark civil rights legislation to reach the House floor for a vote.

He checked out of the hospital to help shepherd the Voting Rights Act of 1965 through Smith&#x27;s Rules Committee, and he contributed to the achievements of the Civil rights movement.

Brown died from uremic poisoning due to kidney failure at Bethesda Naval Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland on August 23, 1965. He was buried in the I.O.O.F. Cemetery, Blanchester, Ohio.

Brown was a member of the Masons, K. of P., I.O.O.F., Moose, and M.W.A.

Brown and his wife Ethel had three children — Betty, Dorothy and Clarence J. &quot;Bud&quot; Brown Jr.

His son, Bud, won the special election in 1965 to fill his father&#x27;s seat in Congress. His grandson is Clancy Brown, an actor. He is not related to the film director of the same name.

<text>Lee David Ross (August 25, 1942 – May 14, 2021) was a Canadian-American professor. He held the title of the Stanford Federal Credit Union Professor of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford University and was an influential social psychologist who studied attributional biases, shortcomings in judgment and decision making, and barriers to conflict resolution, often with longtime collaborator Mark Lepper. Ross was known for his identification and explication of the fundamental attribution error and for the demonstration and analysis of other phenomena and shortcomings that have become standard topics in textbooks and in some cases, even popular media. His interests included ongoing societal problems, in particular protracted inter-group conflicts, the individual and collective rationalization of evil, and the psychological processes that make it difficult to confront societal challenges. Ross went beyond the laboratory to involve himself in conflict resolution and public peace processes in the Middle East, Northern Ireland, and other areas of the world.

==Life==
Ross was born in Toronto on August 25, 1942. He earned his B.A. degree in psychology at the University of Toronto in 1965 and his Ph.D. in social psychology at Columbia University in 1969 under the supervision of Stanley Schachter. His primary interests include biases in human inference, judgment, and decision-making; intergroup relations and dispute resolution; political psychology; and points of contact between psychology, law, and ethics.

Ross first came into prominence in 1977 when he coined the term &quot;fundamental attribution error&quot; to describe the finding that people are predisposed towards attributing another person&#x27;s behavior to individual characteristics and attitudes, even when it is relatively clear that the person&#x27;s behavior was a result of situational demands (Ross, 1977; This effect is closely linked to, but somewhat broader than, &quot;correspondence bias&quot; identified by Jones &amp; Davis, 1965). With Robert Vallone and Mark Lepper he authored the first study to describe the hostile media effect. He has also collaborated with Richard Nisbett in books on human judgment (Nisbett &amp; Ross, 1980) and the relation between social situations and personality (i.e. &quot;the person and the situation&quot;; Ross &amp; Nisbett, 1991). His 1977 chapter, on &quot;The Intuitive Psychologist and his Shortcomings&quot; has been one of the most cited articles in social psychology over the past four decades.

Author of over 100 journal articles and book chapters, Ross, co-authored two influential books with Richard Nisbett: &quot;Human Inference&quot; (1980), which deals with the tasks, strategies, and shortcomings of the intuitive psychologist and &quot;The Person and the Situation&quot; (Ross &amp; Nisbett, 1991; reissued in 2011 with a foreword by Malcolm Gladwell, who commented that &quot;all of my books have been, in some sense, intellectual godchildren of the &quot;Person and the Situation&quot;&quot;). Most recently, Ross has co-authored, with Tom Gilovich, &quot;The Wisest One in the Room&quot;, which explores what the authors consider to be the most important and the most personally and societally useful ideas to have emerged from social psychology and related disciplines.

Ross died on May 14, 2021, at the age of 78 from heart and kidney failure at his home in Palo Alto. He was survived by his wife Judith (née Spinks) Ross, and their four adult children.

==Research==
Lee Ross was interested in – and has influenced – many fields of psychology, including attitude formation and change, social cognition, judgment and decision, influence, intergroup relations and political psychology. His research generally focused on sources of bias and error and strategies to ameliorate them. With an interdisciplinary group of researchers, Ross was a co-founder of the Stanford Center on International Conflict and Negotiation (SCICN). The motivational, cognitive, and perceptual barriers that thwart efforts to ease conflict and achieve mutually beneficial agreements has been a major focus both of his research and applied work over the past two decades.

His earliest work involved the under-appreciation of situational influences on actions and outcomes, and on the role of &quot;construal&quot; or subjective interpretation of the situations and choices one faces. For example, one study on the &quot;fundamental attribution error&quot; demonstrated that observers are relatively insensitive to role-conferred advantages and disadvantages in evaluating actions and outcomes. A study on the role of situational construal and the impact of situational labeling showed that the decision of research participants to cooperate vs defect when playing the classic Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma game could be heavily influenced by the &quot;name of the game&quot; (i.e. the Wall Street Game versus the Community Game). Much of his subsequent work focused on these influences, and related ones, that govern a wide range of interferential and judgmental tasks, and the interactions between individuals and between groups.

Ross and his colleagues subsequently conducted ground-breaking work on other errors and biases in judgment and decision-making and in the attribution process, including biased assimilation of information and resulting belief perseverance, the false consensus effect, the hostile media effect, reactive devaluation, and most recently &quot;naive realism&quot; or the illusion of personal objectivity.

<doc id="881924" wikidata="Q2356215" url="?curid=881924" title="Nova (Richard Rider)">
<text>Nova (Richard Rider) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character appeared historically as the star of his own series, and at other times, as a supporting character in team books such as &quot;The New Warriors&quot;. He is a member of the intergalactic police force known as the Nova Corps. He has access to the Nova Force and superhuman abilities including enhanced strength, flight and resistance to injury.

==Publication history==
The character was created in 1966 by writer Marv Wolfman in issue #3 of his fanzine &quot;Super Adventures&quot;. Then known as the Star, he was an alien doctor named Denteen who found a spaceship containing pills which gave him a different superhuman power every five minutes. In issue #6, Wolfman and writer Len Wein reimagined the character, now a prisoner named Kraken Roo who turns out to become the superhero Black Nova. Years later, Wolfman (working for Marvel Comics) and artist John Romita Sr. tweaked the design of the character&#x27;s uniform and created a new origin story.

Nova debuted in &quot;The Man Called Nova&quot; #1 (Sept. 1976), written by Wolfman and drawn by John Buscema. Wolfman intended the teenage character to be an homage to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko&#x27;s Spider-Man, down to his humble working-class roots and alliterative alter-ego. The original series lasted 25 issues from September 1976 to May 1979. Dangling plot lines were resolved in issues #206-214 of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (also by Wolfman) and issue #24 of &quot;Rom: Spaceknight&quot;. The character then disappeared into obscurity until returning as a member of the original New Warriors team debuting in &quot;The Mighty Thor &quot;#411 (December 1989), and continuing through &quot;The New Warriors&quot; #1-75 and &quot;Annual&quot;s #1-4 (July 1990—September 1996).

Following two subsequent &quot;Nova&quot; titles, &quot;Nova&quot; (vol. 2) #1-18 (Jan. 1994-June 1995) and &quot;Nova the Human Rocket&quot; (vol. 3) #1-7 (May.-Nov. 1999), Nova would return in &quot;The New Warriors&quot; (vol. 2) #0-10 (Oct. 1999—July 2000) and &quot;New Warriors&quot; (vol. 3) #1-6 (July 2005-Dec. 2005). After a four-issue miniseries titled &quot;Annihilation: Nova&quot; and a leading role in &quot;Annihilation&quot; #1-6, &quot;Nova&quot; (vol. 4) ran for 36 issues (April 2007-April 2010). This series tied into &quot;&quot;, &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, and &quot;War of Kings&quot;. After the cancellation of &quot;Nova&quot; (vol. 4), some remaining plot threads were addressed in &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot;, a six-issue miniseries with two bookend one-shots (May 2010-Feb. 2011).

Nova appeared as a member of the Secret Avengers during the first four issues of that team&#x27;s eponymous series (May - Aug. 2010).

Nova appears in a &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; storyline running from August to October 2014, an &quot;Original Sin&quot; tie-in featuring a flashback to events immediately following &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==

===Original series===

When the last surviving member of the planet Xandar&#x27;s elite Nova Corps, Rhomann Dey, is dying, he selects New York high school student Richard Rider to replace him. Rider is given the uniform and powers of a Nova Centurion, but little instruction on how to use them. Calling himself Nova, Rider becomes a superhero, fighting costumed supervillains such as the Condor, Powerhouse, Diamondhead, the Corruptor, and the Sphinx, and teaming with heroes such as Spider-Man and Thor. He initially hides his identity, but later reveals it to his family.

Rider discovers Dey&#x27;s spaceship orbiting Earth and uses it to journey to Xandar with Doctor Sun, Powerhouse, Comet, the Crimebuster and the Sphinx, where they join the Xandarians&#x27; war against the Skrulls. With the help of Rom the Space Knight, the Skrulls are defeated. Wanting to return to Earth, Rider is released from his duties on Xandar and relinquishes his powers.

===&quot;The New Warriors&quot;===
Upon his return to Earth, Rider struggles to readjust due to his failure to complete high school. Unknown to him, the planet Xandar is utterly destroyed in an attack by the space pirate Nebula. With the help of Night Thrasher, Rider regains his powers and joins the New Warriors superhero team, where he becomes close friends with Speedball. Richard briefly dates Yale student Laura Dunham and teammate Namorita.
Rider encounters Garthan Saal, a former Nova Corps Centurion who had been driven insane by absorbing too much of the Nova Force, the source of power for Nova Centurions. Saal seeks more power so he can restore Xandar to its former glory. He strips Rider of his powers and transports him to Xandar. Saal is defeated. Rider witnesses the reformation of the Nova Corps and receives the rank of Centurion Prime.

Assigned to Earth, Rider is confronted with the challenge of balancing dual lives as a member of both the Nova Corps and the New Warriors. Rider encounters a Nova Corps member from an alternate timeline named Nova 0:0, who prepares him to stop the Deathstorm, which is coming to destroy Earth. Because Rider defies Xandar&#x27;s Queen Adora to stop the Deathstorm, he is temporarily stripped of his powers and rank, but is given back his powers when his replacement sacrifices himself.

===&quot;Annihilation&quot;===
Nova briefly travels the U.S. with the reformed New Warriors as part of a reality television show. Rider leaves the group when he is summoned to Xandar alongside the entire Nova Corps, which has been fully mobilized to respond to the Annihilation Wave, a force from the Negative Zone led by Annihilus. The wave decimates Xandar and the corps in a surprise attack. As the only surviving centurion, Rider makes contact with the Xandarian Worldmind, a living supercomputer that regulates the Nova Force and is caretaker of the entire database of Xandarian civilization. The Worldmind uploads itself and the entire Nova Force into Rider, greatly enhancing his abilities. During the Annihilation War, Rider takes command of the United Front, a loose collaboration of soldiers. In a nearly year-long campaign, Rider resists the Wave&#x27;s advance across the galaxy until the United Front suffers a swift defeat. He leads a small team into the Wave&#x27;s conquered territory and eventually engages Annihilus in personal combat, killing him.

After the Annihilation War, Rider returns to Earth to rest. However, finding out that his pleas for help in the Annihilation War were ignored by Earth&#x27;s superheroes because of a Civil War, and meeting Penance - his old friend Speedball, who was mentally scarred by the events leading up to said war - Rider returns to space, feeling out of place on Earth and disturbed by what Penance had become.

===Post-&quot;Annihilation&quot;===
Attempting to aid the Kree against an from the Phalanx, Rider is wounded and crash-lands on a sparsely populated Kree outpost. While Rider&#x27;s unconscious body recovers, Worldmind deputizes a local Kree commander, Ko-Rel, to guard him. Rider is infected by the transmode virus and joins the Phalanx. Now tasked with killing Rider before the Worldmind falls into enemy hands, Ko-Rel attacks him, only to be killed by Gamora in retaliation. Upon her death, her fraction of the Nova force returns to Rider and enables him to overcome the transmode virus. He flees Kree space pursued by Gamora and a Phalanx-controlled Drax. Seeking a cure for the transmode virus, Rider eventually arrives on Kvch, home planet of the Technarchy. Rider enlists the help of the mutant Warlock and his son Tyro, who cure Rider, Drax, and Gamora of the transmode virus. The five return to Hala to engage the Phalanx.

When ambushed by Skrulls during the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, Rider is aided by Kl&#x27;rt the Super-Skrull. He learns about the Secret Invasion and heads for Earth. Rider learns that Project Pegasus, the base where his brother now works, is under Skrull attack. Working with Darkhawk, Rider successfully stops the Skrulls&#x27; advance. The scientists of the facility extract the Worldmind from his brain and use the supercomputer to jump-start a project known as the quantum flask, which restores Quasar to life. A Skrull warship is about to attack Project Pegasus but is destroyed by a band of alien Nova Centurions who then declare their allegiance to Rider.

Rider learns that the Worldmind has been recruiting members for the Corps without telling him. When he learns that Ego the Living Planet is among the new recruits, he becomes enraged and tries to battle Worldmind. As a result, he is stripped of his rank and ejected from the Nova Corps. Because his body has become dependent on the Nova Force, Rider will die if he is without it for too long. As a temporary measure, he borrows the quantum bands from Wendell Vaughn and becomes Quasar. Using his new abilities, Rider rescues the Corps from the War of Kings. Ego is removed as a Centurion and Rider regains his Nova Prime status, but not before most of the new recruits are slaughtered by the Shi&#x27;ar Imperial Guard. Nova agrees to train the remaining new Centurions, including his younger brother Robert.

Nova is recruited for the Secret Avengers by Steve Rogers and sent to Mars to investigate Roxxon&#x27;s operations on that planet. While there, Rider discovers a second Serpent Crown secreted there, only to fall under its influence until rescued by Rogers and his team of Avengers. Shortly after this mission, Nova is called away to deal with the events of &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot; and Steve Rogers confirms he has left the team.

===&quot;Realm of Kings&quot; and &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot;===
A lost Nova Corps ship appears from a tear in space-time known as the Fault. Onboard is Zan Philo, a long-missing Nova Centurion who is assigned to train the new recruits. Later, Rider and Darkhawk find themselves inside the Fault, where they are called to do battle for the Sphinx against his younger self. Because of the unstable timestream inside the Fault, Nova is able to return with Namorita, his old girlfriend who had died a few years earlier. Rider returns to Project Pegasus, where he confronts an alternate Quasar who originates from the Cancerverse, a universe within the Fault.

Catching up to the alternate Quasar, Rider returns to the Fault to see the Universal Church of Truth rip it wide open. Assisted by others, he confronts Lord Mar-Vell, the evil alternate version of Captain Marvel, but cannot stop him. Entering the Fault to assist the Guardians of the Galaxy, Rider and the Guardians watch Thanos destroy Mar-Vell. Now facing an enraged Thanos, Rider pulls the Nova Force from the rest of the Corps for extra strength. He and Star-Lord are able to hold Thanos back for the few minutes it takes for the Fault to close, trapping all three of them in the Cancerverse. The two heroes continue to fight Thanos for a Cosmic Cube which has the power to send them home. Rider charges the Cube with the Nova Force to create a doorway for Star-Lord, intending to remain behind and keep Thanos from escaping too. Star-Lord escapes, but Rider is unable to prevent Thanos from escaping as well. Because no one is immediately aware Star-Lord survived, Nova and Star-Lord receive a statue in their honor on Hala.

===Return===
The latest Nova, Sam Alexander, locates the Xandarian Worldmind. Rider&#x27;s consciousness awakens within the Worldmind during the encounter. It is later revealed that Rider and the Worldmind survived the closure of the Fault and remain trapped in the Cancerverse. Using the Nova Force, Rider manages to escape the Cancerverse, returns to Earth to visit his mother, and learns that his father has died. He encounters Alexander and they begin working together. However, in his escape, Rider has become a portal to the Cancerverse, which repeatedly attempts to invade Earth through him. Rider returns to the Cancerverse in hopes of closing the portal and thus saving his own universe. Despite his resistance, he is co-opted by the Cancerverse, but is freed by Alexander, who has followed him. The two escape the Cancerverse once more, using the Cosmic Cube carried by Thanos&#x27; Cancerverse doppelganger. Rider and Alexander resume their lives and relationships on Earth while continuing as Nova Corpsmen.

In the aftermath of &quot;Empyre,&quot; Nova represents the Nova Corps during a Galactic Council meeting held by Kl&#x27;rt the Super-Skrull. When Emperor Stote of the Zn&#x27;rx was found dead in the restroom and Noh-Varr becomes a suspect after attacking the Skrull subaltern Val-Korr, Nova calls in the Guardians of the Galaxy to investigate Emperor Stote&#x27;s murder.

During the &quot;Judgment Day&quot; storyline, Nova appears at Port Prometheus to protect the evacuees from the attackers at the time when Uranos the Undying was attacking.

==Powers and abilities==
Nova derives his powers from an energy source called the Nova Force which all Nova Corps Centurions wield. This energy was transferred to Rider by the Nova Centurion Rhomann Dey. The Nova Force affords Rider superhuman powers including flight, superhuman strength, speed, and durability, as well as the power to absorb energy directed against him and release it as gravimetric pulses and beams, either from specific parts of his body or from his entire body. Nova is a good hand-to-hand combatant, and has been coached by Chord.

Nova wears a standard Xandarian StarCorps uniform, designed to accommodate his powers without being damaged by them. The uniform is highly resistant to damage, including outer space conditions, and is airtight. In addition, the uniform has a built-in life support function that can sustain Rider under the most extreme environmental conditions, including acting as a life-support suit by locking off the mouth and eyes of the helmet. The helmet contains a radio, telescopic sights, night vision sensors, and heat imaging sensors, as well as a visual heads-up display for tracking energy signatures. Nova&#x27;s helmet has a rigid construction and shape when worn, but becomes as malleable as cloth when it is not, allowing Rider to hide it in his civilian clothes when desired. Nova&#x27;s uniform is not only extremely malleable, but contains specific functions to aid Rider in his role as a Nova Corps Centurion. Among these features are an electromagnetic discharge that can nullify gravity and an interface to stargates that allow him to enter hyperspace, where he can move at velocities exceeding the speed of light. Rider can also alter the appearance and nature of his uniform to suit his needs. However, as Rider learns the hard way, the Nova Corps keeps a strict dress code. When he makes major cosmetic changes to his uniform after rejoining the New Warriors, Nova is summarily ordered to conform to standard.

During Annihilation, Rider&#x27;s uniform is altered and enhanced to house the Xandarian Worldmind as well as the entire Nova Force, which was previously used by all members of the Nova Corps. With the Worldmind and the Nova Force, Rider possesses tremendously augmented strength and durability as well as nearly limitless quantities of energy. The Worldmind consists of the entire culture and history of Xandar as well as the individual minds of thousands of years of dead Xandarians. The consensus voice of the Worldmind can speak directly to Rider, helping him to control the Nova Force, fight enemies, sense energy, interface with electronics, and protect against psionic abilities. The Worldmind can also assume direct control of Rider&#x27;s body when he is asleep.

==Marv Wolfman lawsuit==
In 1997, on the eve of the impending release of the &quot;Blade&quot; motion picture, Marv Wolfman sued Marvel Characters Inc. over ownership of all characters he had created for Marvel Comics, including Nova and Blade. A ruling in Marvel&#x27;s favor was handed down on November 6, 2000. Wolfman&#x27;s stance was that he had not signed work-for-hire contracts when he created characters including Blade and Nova. In a nonjury trial, the judge ruled that Marvel&#x27;s later use of the characters was sufficiently different to protect it from Wolfman&#x27;s claim of copyright ownership.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In the alternate future of Earth X, Nova resides in the afterlife. He and two other deceased heroes, Ms. Marvel and Star-Lord, lead an initial charge against Mephisto but are swiftly defeated.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;===
Nova is featured in &quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot;. Unable to overcome his fear and horror of the slaughter occurring around him, Nova fails to act in his own defense when Spider-Man attacks him. Daredevil intervenes, but is bitten when Nova is too shocked to assist. He and Thor are rescued by the Fantastic Four and united with the other surviving heroes on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. Nova panics further when Nick Fury formulates a desperate last stand defense, citing that this was nothing like previous global threats; and that the world was as good as dead. Regardless, Nova helps in the battle until he is bitten by Ms. Marvel. As a zombie, he participates in a failed attack on Doctor Doom&#x27;s castle, in an effort to get at the humans inside. A zombie version of Nova can be seen in the &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; miniseries, being shredded by a hail of metal fragments hurled by Magneto.

He is still mobile, as a zombie, when a swarm of zombies attack and attempt to consume the Silver Surfer. During the incident, Zombie Hulk crushes Zombie Hercules when the latter attempts to steal the Silver Surfer&#x27;s head. Nova backs away, saying &quot;On second thought, you keep that, big guy&quot;. He is later killed by the cosmic zombies.

===MC2===
Richard Rider appears frequently in the &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; series, which is set in an alternate future. The MC2 Nova (co-created by Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz) first appeared in &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; #7 and wrongly believed Spider-Girl was a supervillain since she was fighting Darkdevil at the time. After a brief battle Nova later realizes his mistake.

Over time, the MC2 Nova attempts to tutor Spider-Girl on the importance of being a superhero. His arrogance and lack of patience with younger heroes causes his lessons to be largely ignored. However, the fact that Nova was a founding member of the New Warriors gave Spider-Girl the inspiration to form a new MC2 version of the Warriors.

By the time of the series, Nova has served as a temporary Avenger. He also appears in the &quot;Last Hero Standing&quot; and &quot;Avengers Next&quot; miniseries. Nova also assisted in the battle against Galactus in &quot;Last Planet Standing&quot;. The Nova in the MC2/Spider-Girl future is eventually confirmed to be Richard Rider in &quot;Avengers Next&quot; #2. His attitude toward Spider-Girl is often arrogant and dismissive, bordering on the contemptuous; but later he becomes impressed by her, after her surviving a battle against the Avengers&#x27; enemy Seth.

===&quot;Forever Yesterday&quot;===
Nova appears as the sole Caucasian member of a team of Avengers from a parallel reality where the Middle East is the dominant superpower. He serves the ruler of this alternate Earth, the tyrannical female Sphinx. He is shown the truth of how the female Sphinx used the energy of the Ka Stone to reshape reality by the original Sphinx&#x27;s former advisor, Sayge. Nova betrays the Sphinx to join Marvel Man (Vance Astrovik) and Firestar of that world&#x27;s Mutant Liberation Front as well as Night Thrasher, whose parents were murdered in this reality on the orders of the Sphinx. When Nova threatens to murder the Sphinx&#x27;s cat, she restores reality.

===Nova 0:0===
The second Nova series Nova deals with Nova 0:0, who is much more adept at using his powers than Richard Rider. He often fights Nova to test him and to push Nova into using his powers in new ways. It is revealed that this Nova is, in fact, the alternate reality version of Richard&#x27;s younger brother Robert. In that reality, Robert gained the Nova Force powers instead of Richard and stayed behind to lead the Nova Corps and help Xandar rebuild after the war with the Skrulls. Robert&#x27;s Earth had been destroyed by the Deathstorm while he was off in space. Nova 0:0 would later sacrifice his life preventing the Deathstorm from destroying the 616-version of Earth. He died and was buried on Mars. In the fourth volume of &quot;Nova&quot;, the Robert Rider of the 616-version of Earth also becomes a member of the Nova Corps (alongside various other humans and non-humans) and again proves capable of using his powers in ways his brother Richard had not.

===&quot;What If&quot;===
Issue #15 of &quot;What If?&quot; contained four stories in which a young widow, a homeless man, Peter Parker, and a criminal became Nova instead of Richard.

In &quot;What If? Annihilation&quot;, the Annihilation Wave reaches Earth in the climactic battle of the super hero Civil War. Nova, Captain America, and Iron Man work together and sacrifice themselves while using a weapon to destroy the Wave and save Earth.

<text>The Framley Examiner is a parody of a newspaper in a small provincial English town, created as a website and later a book. It is written by Robin Halstead, Jason Hazeley, Alex Morris and Joel Morris.

== History ==
The &quot;Framley Examiner&quot; originally began as a website, started in 2001.
Its success then spawned a book &quot;The Framley Examiner&quot; () described on the cover as &quot;the book of the website of the newspaper&quot;.
A second book, &quot;Historic Framley&quot; (), was later published, being described as &quot;produced in association with Framley Museum&quot;.

Its writers are regular contributors to &quot;Viz&quot; magazine. The book &quot;Bollocks to Alton Towers&quot; (), published in April 2005, by the same authors, is a non-fiction book unrelated to The Framley Examiner.
The website was last updated on 23 July 2013, but more recent posts have been made to social media accounts.

In May 2020, the &quot;Framley Examiner&quot; website was updated to reveal the launch of a crowd-funding appeal via Unbound with the aim of publishing the now out-of-print Framley Examiner along with additional, previously unpublished material.

The father of Joel and Alex Morris worked as a local journalist in Chelmsford, Essex, but the group have dismissed any connection of Framley to the town, saying that &quot;It wasn&#x27;t meant to be targeting one particular rag.&quot;

==Contributors==

*Challenger Putney, a bespectacled reporter who enjoys reporting on stories featuring the Framley town council or the Mayor of Framley, William D&#x27;Ainty. He is especially suited to the job, since he lives with the Mayor and his wife.
*Katie Blirdsnest, a woman who runs a feature called &quot;The Blirdnest Report&quot; which takes a look at life in and around the Framley area. Her previous reports have included such topics as interviewing the man who swallows the tide to stop it from flooding Framley, and rolling down rubbish heaps with binmen. Her reports often contain the phrase &quot;I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!&quot;
*Damiun Clavalier, bored son of international fridge magnate Garuth Clavelier, who writes ridiculous articles in the hope of being sacked.
*Adam Wrent, whose photo byline depicts him at the age of four.
*Taunton Mishap, whose trademark journalistic style is to miss the point of the story.
*Pigshit Nelson, a transgender man who writes unintelligible sport reports.
*Bunco Booth, a journalist who is in love with Katie Blirdsnest.
*Beaky Coxwain, a possible lesbian who is also in love with Katie Blirdsnest
*Ursula Cloybeam, the &quot;Examiner&quot;″s petty and vitriolic arts correspondent. Her reviews of local arts include a harsh review of a local school production of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. She is also apparently a member of the local secret society the Wripple Vetivers.
*Jesus Chigley, wrote the first article ever published in the &quot;Framley Examiner&quot;, and spends most of the time reminding his colleagues of this.
*Stan Rubbish, the Examiner&#x27;s darts correspondent.
*Bowery Tarpaulin
*Pharaoh Clutchstraw, science expert.
*Arcady Belvedere, writes about local history that only he seems to remember or care about.

*Arbroath Smokie
*Oliver Singultus-Hiccup, motoring reporter.

*Estelle Donne, who has appeared in about a dozen wedding announcements. &quot;Reference: Don Estelle, actor best known for his appearance in the BBC sitcom It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum.&quot;
*Fluff, which is apparently a mainstay of Whoft&#x27;s economy.
*Mayor William D&#x27;Ainty, a flamboyant and possibly insane man who mounts ever more outrageous stunts in order to relieve the tedium of ruling Framley. &quot;Reference: the late Billy Dainty, a music hall and television comic&quot;
*Vince Previous, an unsavoury fellow who frequently places adverts offering various kinds of massage for ladies.
*Ianbeale Steeplecocque, MP for the district, whose sole concern is the effect of time travel on the local economy and infrastructure. Given the continued meddling of Professor Bostrom, his concerns may be justified. He was recently ousted in a cash for crisps scandal. &quot;Reference: Ian Beale is a character in the BBC soap EastEnders.&quot;
*A constant desire for a Black and Decker Dinnermate and to go at any length to get one. For example, in one ad: &quot;Fountain of Knowledge, will swap for Elixir of Youth or Black and Decker Dinnermate&quot;. &quot;Reference: portable workbench the Black &amp; Decker Workmate.&quot;
*Framley&#x27;s twin town, Baden Schleissgarten ASF, and its mayor, Claus Freneddt, occasionally appear in the &quot;Examiner&quot;. Mayor Freneddt once ordered the Framley council to put up posters saying &quot;your town stinks&quot; across the town.
*Roy Newby, a rake magnate who owns most of the shops in the Framley area under the brand of &quot;Newby&#x27;s of Molford&quot;, including the NcNewby&#x27;s fast food restaurant.

<doc id="881933" wikidata="Q1476778" url="?curid=881933" title="Sheena, Queen of the Jungle">
<text>Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, is a fictional American comic book jungle girl heroine, originally published primarily by Fiction House during the Golden Age of Comic Books. She was the first female comic book character with her own title, with her 1941 premiere issue (cover-dated Spring 1942) preceding &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #1 (Summer 1942). 

Predated in literature by Rima, the Jungle Girl of William Henry Hudson 1904 novel &quot;Green Mansions&quot;, Sheena was essentially a female version of Tarzan. An orphan who grew up in the jungle and learned how to survive and thrive there, she possessed the ability to communicate with wild animals and was proficient in combat with knives, spears, bows, and makeshift weapons; her Golden Age adventures mostly involved encounters with slave traders, white hunters, native Africans, and wild animals.

==Publication history==

Sheena debuted in Joshua B. Power&#x27;s British magazine &quot;Wags&quot; #46 in January 1938. She was created by Will Eisner and S. M. &quot;Jerry&quot; Iger. One source says Iger, through his small studio Universal Phoenix Features (UFP), commissioned Mort Meskin to produce prototype drawings of Sheena. UFP was one of a handful of studios that produced comics on demand for publishers and syndicates, and whose client Editors Press Service distributed the feature to &quot;Wags&quot;. To help hide the fact their studio consisted only of themselves, the duo signed their Sheena strip with the pseudonym &quot;W. Morgan Thomas&quot;. Eisner said an inspiration for the character&#x27;s name was H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s 1886 jungle-goddess novel &quot;She&quot;. Iger, who maintained that Eisner had nothing to do with the creation of the character, claimed that he picked the name because his mind wandered to the derogatory name &quot;sheenies&quot; that Jewish people were sometimes called in his early days in New York.

Sheena first appeared stateside in Fiction House&#x27;s &quot;Jumbo Comics&quot; #1, and subsequently in every issue (Sept. 1938 – April 1953), as well as in her groundbreaking 18-issue spin-off, &quot;Sheena, Queen of the Jungle&quot; (Spring 1942 – Winter 1952), the first comic book to title-star a female character. Sheena also appeared in Fiction House&#x27;s &quot;Ka&#x27;a&#x27;nga&quot; #16 (Summer 1952) and the one-shot &quot;3-D Sheena, Jungle Queen&quot; (1953)—the latter reprinted by Blackthorne Publishing as &quot;Sheena 3-D Special&quot; (May 1985). Blackthorne also published &quot;Jerry Iger&#x27;s Classic Sheena&quot; (April 1985). 

Fiction House, originally a pulp magazine publisher, ran prose stories of its star heroine in the latter-day pulp one-shot &quot;Stories of Sheena, Queen of the Jungle&quot; (Spring 1951) and &quot;Jungle Stories&quot; vol. 5 #11 (Spring 1954). AC Comics has published reprints of classic Sheena stories.

The property then remained dormant until the release of the Sheena film. Since then, it has passed through the hands of several publishers: 

* Marvel released a two-issue adaptation of the movie in 1984.
* Sheena and her male counterpart Kaanga headlined &quot;Jungle Comics&quot;, a three-issue Blackthorne series that ran from May to October of 1988.
* London Night - an independent publisher specializing in female heroines and softcore erotica - launched a reboot of Sheena in February 1998, with a one-shot color comic book followed by three issues of a planned four-issue black-and-white miniseries (May 1998 – February 1999). This series moved the setting from the jungles of Africa to those of South America, an innovation retained by most subsequent adaptations.

* A second reboot was launched by Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing in 2007 under the guidance of Steven E. de Souza, who situated it in his pre-existing fictional South American country of Val Verde. Devil&#x27;s Due titles included &quot;Sheena, Queen of the Jungle&quot; #1–5 (June 2007 – January 2008), a &quot;Sheena, Trail of the Mapinguari&quot; one-shot (April 2008), and &quot;Sheena, Queen of the Jungle: Dark Rising&quot; #1–3 (October 2008 – December 2008). All subsequent series have taken place in this continuity.
* Moonstone revived the title with &quot;Sheena, Queen of the Jungle&quot; #1–3 in 2014, again written by Steven S. and David de Souza.
* The most substantial Sheena revival to date has been a Dynamite run beginning with a ten-issue 2017 series co-written by Marguerite Bennett and Christina Trujilo, with art by Moritat (issues 1-4) and Maria Laura Sanapo (issues 5-10). A second ten-issue series written by Stephen Mooney and drawn by Jethro Morales premiered in November 2021; a third, subtitled &quot;Fatal Exams&quot; and set at an elite boarding school, ran for five issues in 2023, and was co-written by Steven S. de Souza and Wes Clark Jr., with art by Ediano Silva. The Dynamite series represented a soft reboot, retaining the setting and characters of the Devil&#x27;s Due / Moonstone series but not the continuity.

== Fictional character biography ==
Sheena is the young, blonde daughter of Cardwell Rivington, who is exploring in Africa with his daughter in tow. When Cardwell accidentally dies after drinking a magic potion made by Koba, a native witch doctor, Sheena is orphaned. Koba raises the girl as his own daughter, teaching her the ways of the jungle and various central African languages. The adult Sheena becomes &quot;queen of the jungle&quot; and acquires a monkey sidekick named Chim.

According to &quot;Jess Nevins&#x27; Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes&quot;, &quot;Assisted by the great white hunter Bob Reynolds, Sheena fights everything under the sun, including but not limited to: hostile natives, hostile animals, giants, a super-ape, the Green Terror, sabre-tooth tigers, voodoo cultists, gorilla-men, devil-apes, blood cults, devil queens, dinosaurs, army ants, lion men, lost races, leopard-birds, cavemen, serpent gods, vampire-apes, etc.&quot;

Originally costumed in a simple red dress, Sheena acquired her iconic leopard-skin bikini by issue #10 of &quot;Jumbo Comics&quot;.

In time, Sheena&#x27;s home village is destroyed, leaving Sheena with a white safari guide named Bob Reynolds (alternately called &quot;Bob Reilly&quot; or &quot;Bob Rayburn&quot;), who becomes her mate. In later incarnations, Sheena&#x27;s mate is Rick Thorne.

The 1988 Jungle Comics began with the original 1940&#x27;s Sheena living in retirement in contemporary New York, under the name Sharon McClory. She is given the opportunity to be rejuvenated by magical means so that she may return to Africa and join her similarly de-aged 1940s Fiction House stablemate (and Tarzan pastiche) Kaanga in a struggle against a murderous gang of terrorist poachers.

The 1998 London Night reboot moved the action to South America, made Sheena a redhead, and gave her real name as Sheila Fortner. This incarnation of the character headed a substantial organization, with a crew of assistants and an elaborate underground base.

In the 2007 de Souza reboot (also set in South America, but in a different fictional country), Sheena&#x27;s name was Rachel Rivington Cardwell (also spelled &quot;Caldwell&quot; in the later Devil&#x27;s Due and Moonstone series, and &quot;Cadwell&quot; in the early Dynamite series), a homage to her father&#x27;s name in the original 1940s comics. An orphan raised in the hidden city of Piatiti, Sheena was actually the long-lost granddaughter of the ruthless industrialist Harrison Cardwell, and was revered by the tribal peoples of the Zona Prohibida (the unexplored interior of Val Verde) as the &quot;Matayana,&quot; the legendary protectress of the Mother Forest. In addition to several human sidekicks - the idealistic environmental activist Bob Kellerman, cynical Cardwell security head Martin Ransome, college student Chamo, and fellow rich girl Tyler Pinto - she shared a telepathic link with three animal partners: the black jaguar Yagua, scarlet macaw Pete, and spider monkey Chim.

Model Irish McCalla portrayed the titular character in &quot;Sheena: Queen of the Jungle&quot;, a 26-episode TV series, aired in first-run syndication from 1955 to 1956. McCalla told a newspaper interviewer she was discovered by Nassour Studios while throwing a bamboo spear on a Malibu, California beach, famously adding &quot;I couldn&#x27;t act, but I could swing through the trees.&quot; Although the Sheena character was often called &quot;the Queen of the Congo,&quot; the TV series clearly located her in Kenya, which is hundreds of miles from the Congo River. Though the character was created in comic books by Will Eisner and Jerry Iger many years earlier, a 1956 &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary for Claude E. Lapham, a 10-year editor at Fiction House, says, &quot;His story &#x27;Sheena&#x27; was the basis for the television story of that name.&quot;

The 1984 Columbia Pictures film &quot;Sheena&quot;, produced by Paul Aratow, starred Tanya Roberts, who had previously co-starred as Kiri in MGM&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;Beastmaster&quot;. In this version, the character&#x27;s name is Janet Ames, daughter of Philip and Betsy Ames, before being renamed Sheena by Shaman. Roberts&#x27;s Sheena had a much-expanded vocabulary from McCalla&#x27;s (as well as a telepathic connection with jungle animals). Marvel Comics published a comic-book adaptation of the &quot;Sheena&quot; film as &quot;Marvel Comics Super Special&quot; #34 (June 1984), reprinting it as &quot;Sheena, Queen of the Jungle&quot; #1–2 (Dec. 1984–Feb. 1985).

The Bollywood film industry in India produced a string of uncredited Hindi versions of Sheena, beginning with &quot;Tarzan Sundari&quot;, also known as &quot;Lady Tarzan&quot; (1983); &quot;Africadalli Sheela&quot; (1986); and &quot;Jungle Ki Beti&quot; (1988).

&quot;Sheena&quot; was revived by Hearst Entertainment in October 2000, portrayed by Gena Lee Nolin. In this version, the character&#x27;s real name is Shirley Hamilton. Sheena was given a new power in this 35-episode Columbia/TriStar series: the ability to adopt the form of any warm-blooded animal once she gazed into its eyes. She was also depicted as a ferocious killer, capable of becoming a humanoid creature called the Darak&#x27;Na; this form killed numerous individuals, though in her regular form she was also seen in numerous episodes stabbing soldiers and other villains to death. As with Tanya Roberts, Nolin&#x27;s Sheena spoke whole sentences.

In 2017, Millennium Films was developing a Sheena reboot.

The Ramones song &quot;Sheena Is a Punk Rocker&quot; was inspired by Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. The song first appeared on the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;, in 1977. A cartoon drawing of Sheena appears on the record sleeve of the LP version.

The Bruce Springsteen song &quot;Crush on You&quot; contains the lyrics &quot;She makes the Venus de Milo look like she got no style/she makes Sheena of the Jungle look meek and mild.&quot;

Ike Turner credited Sheena, Queen of the Jungle as one of his inspirations for creating Tina Turner&#x27;s stage persona. He chose the name &quot;Tina&quot; because it rhymed with &quot;Sheena.&quot;

<text>Graeme James Souness (; born 6 May 1953) is a Scottish former professional football player, manager and television pundit.

A midfielder, Souness achieved his greatest period of success as an integral part of the Liverpool team of the late 1970s and early 1980s, during which he won five First Division titles and three European Cup trophies. He was captain for three seasons at Liverpool until his departure to Sampdoria in 1984. Souness later became player-manager for Rangers, leading the club to three Scottish titles and four league cups. His final game as a player came in the closing minutes of Rangers&#x27; final match of the 1989–90 season, which was his only appearance of the season. 

Souness continued as Rangers coach for a further year before joining Liverpool as manager for the 1991–92 English First Division season. He went on to have spells at Galatasaray, Southampton, Torino, Benfica, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United.

At international level, Souness gained 54 caps for Scotland, captaining the team on 27 occasions.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Souness was brought up in the Saughton Mains area of Edinburgh, and supported local side Hearts and Rangers. As a teenager, Souness played for local boys&#x27; club North Merchiston.

Souness&#x27; career began as an apprentice at Tottenham Hotspur under Bill Nicholson. He signed professional forms as a 15-year-old in 1968. Frustrated at a lack of first-team opportunities, the teenage Souness told Nicholson he should be selected for the first team. Souness made one first-team appearance for Spurs, in a UEFA Cup tie as a substitute.

During the summer of 1972, Souness played in the North American Soccer League for the Montreal Olympique. He appeared in 10 of his team&#x27;s 14 matches and was named in the league&#x27;s All-Star team for that season.

===Middlesbrough===
Spurs sold Souness to Middlesbrough for £30,000 in 1972. He made his first appearance for Middlesbrough on 6 January 1973 in a 2–1 league defeat to Fulham at Craven Cottage. His first goal came on 11 December 1973 in a 3–0 league victory over Preston North End at Ayresome Park.

Souness&#x27; tenacious style began to garner acclaim during his time at Middlesbrough. His first season saw Middlesbrough finish fourth, two places and 14 points short of promotion. Jack Charlton was appointed Middlesbrough manager, his first managerial post, in May 1973. One of Charlton&#x27;s first signings was experienced former Celtic midfielder Bobby Murdoch, a fellow Scot whom Souness later cited as an important influence in the development of his playing style. Promotion as champions of the Second Division followed in 1973–74. Souness&#x27; influence was demonstrated when he scored a hat-trick in the season&#x27;s final fixture, an 8–0 victory over Sheffield Wednesday.

===Liverpool===
Souness&#x27; playing career is best remembered for his seven seasons at Liverpool, where he won five League Championships, three European Cups and four League Cups.

Souness&#x27; time at Anfield began in January 1978 as a replacement for veteran Ian Callaghan. After winning his first European Cup in 1977, Liverpool manager Bob Paisley sought reinforcements by signing three Scottish players, all of whom were to contribute substantially to further success. Central defender Alan Hansen arrived from Partick Thistle for £110,000. Kenny Dalglish – an established Scottish international – signed from Celtic for a then British record fee of £440,000. Souness formed the final part of the Scottish triumvirate, leaving Middlesbrough in acrimonious circumstances for a club-record fee of £350,000 on 10 January 1978.

Souness&#x27; Liverpool debut came in a 1–0 league victory over West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns on 14 January 1978. His first goal – a volley from just inside the penalty box, eventually awarded fans&#x27; goal of the season – came in a 3–1 win over rivals Manchester United at Anfield on 25 February 1978.

Souness played a pivotal role in Liverpool&#x27;s retention of the European Cup against FC Bruges in 1978 at Wembley Stadium, providing the pass for Kenny Dalglish to score the match&#x27;s only goal.

Sustained success followed. Souness&#x27;s first League title medals were won in seasons 1978–79 and 1979–80. A second European Cup medal for Souness arrived in 1981 with a 1–0 victory over Real Madrid – the culmination of a campaign in which Souness scored a hat-trick in the quarter-final against CSKA Sofia.

This burst of success prompted Paisley to award Souness the club captaincy for season 1981–82, to the chagrin of the incumbent Phil Thompson who had made some errors that season and with whom Paisley had a vicious row during one match at Aston Villa. Thompson initially refused to speak to Souness, claiming he had &quot;stolen the captaincy&quot; from behind his back. This was the start of several long-running feuds between the two robust characters, and over the coming years, they would confront each other in various circumstances.

Under Souness&#x27; captaincy, two trophies followed as Liverpool regained the League championship and retained the League Cup, trophies that were successfully defended in season 1982–83. For the trophy award presentation after the 2–1 win over Manchester United in 1983, Souness stepped back and insisted that Paisley collect the trophy in the manager&#x27;s retirement season.

In 1983–84, Souness lifted three trophies. He scored the winning goal in the 1984 League Cup final replay at Maine Road against Merseyside rivals Everton, the first all-Merseyside cup final. Liverpool won the league title for the third consecutive season and reached the 1984 European Cup final after beating Romanian champions Dinamo București in the semi-final 3–1 on aggregate. In an ill-tempered first leg at Anfield, Souness broke the jaw of Dinamo captain Lică Movilă, which went unpunished by the referee. Liverpool won the 1984 final after a penalty shoot-out win over Roma, with Souness scoring one of the penalties in the shootout.

Souness&#x27; Liverpool career ended in 1984 after 358 appearances and 56 goals.

===Sampdoria===
Souness left Liverpool in 1984, joining Sampdoria for a fee of £650,000. Souness and England international Trevor Francis – a player at the Genoa-based club since 1982 – added experience to an emerging group of future Italian internationals, including Roberto Mancini, Pietro Vierchowod and Gianluca Vialli. In his first season, Sampdoria won the Coppa Italia with a 3–1 aggregate victory over Serie A rivals Milan in the final, securing the trophy for the first time in club history. Souness scored the only goal of the game in the first leg of the final.

===Rangers===
Souness&#x27; career in Italy ended in 1986 as he took up the position of player-manager at Rangers. His playing career at Ibrox began inauspiciously. His competitive debut – in the opening match of the 1986–87 season, against Hibernian in his hometown of Edinburgh – saw him sent off after two yellow cards in the first 34 minutes.

Disciplinary problems – something that had recurred periodically throughout Souness&#x27;s career – resurfaced on a number of occasions during his time as a player at Rangers, and the spell was also blighted by injury. He made 73 appearances in total for Rangers (50 in the league), scoring three goals. His final appearance as a player was at Ibrox in a 2–0 victory over Dunfermline Athletic in Rangers&#x27; last home match of the 1989–90 season, when he brought himself on for the final 20 minutes.

== International career ==
While a Middlesbrough player, Souness received his first international cap for Scotland on 30 October 1974 in a 3–0 friendly victory over East Germany at Hampden Park. By the time Souness was selected by manager Ally McLeod for the Scotland squad for the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina, he had been awarded only six caps. His move to Liverpool increased his profile. Souness missed Scotland&#x27;s first two matches, a defeat to Peru and a draw with Iran, due to injury. He was selected for the final group match against the Netherlands. Souness contributed to a 3–2 victory that nevertheless saw Scotland eliminated from the tournament on goal difference.

Souness played in two further World Cups. The first, in 1982 in Spain, saw Souness play all three group stage matches. His first international goal arrived in the final game prior to elimination, a 2–2 draw with the Soviet Union in Málaga.

A final World Cup appearance came in 1986 in Mexico, at a time when Souness had already been appointed Rangers player-manager. Souness played in defeats to Denmark and West Germany. He later said he had performed poorly in those matches, having struggled with the high altitude and losing a significant amount of weight and power. Souness was omitted by caretaker manager Alex Ferguson for Scotland&#x27;s final match against Uruguay. Souness claimed in his autobiography, &quot;The Management Years&quot;, and press interviews that this was the only time in his whole career he had been dropped. Souness also stated Ferguson was unusually apologetic and was very respectful and diplomatic in his conversation with Souness at night when he broke the news to him, as he held Souness in high regard. His international career ended after the 1986 World Cup. He had made 54 appearances in almost 12 years, scoring four goals.

==Coaching and managerial career==

===Rangers===
Souness was appointed Rangers&#x27; first player-manager in April 1986, signing from Sampdoria for a fee of £300,000 and succeeding Jock Wallace. Financed initially by the club&#x27;s then owner, Lawrence Marlborough, Souness and club chairman David Holmes embarked upon a bold strategy of reclaiming the footballing ascendancy Rangers had lacked in recent years, having not won the league title since 1978, with all of the Scottish league titles since then being claimed by their arch-rivals Celtic, and the emerging &quot;New Firm&quot; of Aberdeen and Dundee United. A 33-year-old Souness arrived at Ibrox with a reputation as one of Europe&#x27;s leading midfielders. His signing was unusual in that Scottish clubs had rarely been able to sign top-quality internationals, including Scots, from other leagues. Scottish clubs had often found themselves being in the position of selling their top players to English clubs, notable examples being Kenny Dalglish (sold from Celtic to Liverpool in 1977), Gordon Strachan (sold from Aberdeen to Manchester United in 1984) and Frank McAvennie (sold from St Mirren to West Ham United in 1985).

A string of major signings for Rangers from English clubs began to be termed the &quot;Souness Revolution&quot;. Significantly, this reversed the historic pattern of Scotland&#x27;s most able footballers playing in England. His first signings included Terry Butcher, captain of Ipswich Town and an established England international, and Chris Woods of Norwich City, England&#x27;s second-choice goalkeeper. Subsequent seasons saw the arrival of other English internationals, such as Trevor Steven, Gary Stevens, Trevor Francis and Ray Wilkins. Souness was able to offer the lure of European club competition, at a time – 1985–1990 – when English clubs were banned from Europe in the wake of the Heysel Stadium disaster. Rangers profited from this by embarking upon a signing policy which drew on their relative wealth to compete, for the first time, directly with England&#x27;s most powerful clubs.

Souness revitalised Rangers quickly began to dominate Scottish football. In his first season, 1986–87, they won the Championship and the League Cup, defeating Celtic 2–1 in the final. They retained the League Cup in 1987–88, defeating Aberdeen on penalties after extra-time, although they surrendered their league title to Celtic. Two more Championships were to follow, this time in successive seasons (1988–89 and 1989–90), and a further two League Cup victories, over Aberdeen 3–2 in 1988–89 and Celtic 2–1 (after extra time) in 1990–91. In April 1991, Rangers were in the process of winning a fourth league title in five seasons when Souness left Rangers to take over as manager of Liverpool. He was replaced by his assistant Walter Smith four matches prior to the end of what was to become another championship-winning season. Rangers went on to win six further league titles in succession, as well as a string of domestic cups, under Smith&#x27;s management.

Although Souness had been hugely successful in his time at Ibrox, his time in charge had not been without controversy. A significant act was the signing of Mo Johnston in 1989. Rangers, historically a team supported by Protestants, had for most of the 20th century a policy of refusing to sign Roman Catholics. Although there had been many Rangers players of Catholic faith, particularly before the sectarian divisions hardened after World War I, none of them were as high-profile as Johnston. He had previously played for Celtic, and had looked set to rejoin them from Nantes until Souness made an offer to sign him. Johnston publicly announced he would return to Celtic in a press conference at Celtic Park, but days later he signed for Rangers. Souness stated that religion was not an issue for him; his first wife was a Catholic and the children from that marriage were baptised Catholic. His main consideration was that Johnston was a good player, but he also believed that the signing would damage Celtic. He was also responsible for ordering a picture of Queen Elizabeth II be hung in the Rangers dressing room, a tradition Rangers continued.

Souness also found himself under scrutiny from the Scottish Football Association (SFA) and Scottish League more than once. A succession of confrontational after-match comments pitched Souness regularly at loggerheads with both organisations, prompting touchline bans which Souness circumvented in characteristically provocative fashion by naming himself as a substitute, allowing access as a player to the dugout. In May 1990, Souness was fined £5,000 by the SFA for breaching a touchline ban after television pictures showed him in the tunnel area yelling at his players on the pitch. Souness later said that conflict with officialdom was one of the principal factors precipitating his departure from Ibrox.

In 2009, Souness said of his time as Rangers manager, &quot;When I look back on my actions and antics at Ibrox I bordered on being out of order. I was obnoxious and difficult to deal with.&quot; He was manager during 261 matches in all competitions for Rangers, winning 125 (64%) of 193 league fixtures.

===Liverpool===
Kenny Dalglish, who had played alongside Souness at Liverpool, had resigned as Liverpool manager in February 1991, despite having won three league titles and two FA Cups in the previous five seasons, and with Liverpool still being in contention for both trophies when he resigned. Long-serving coach Ronnie Moran was put in temporary charge following Dalglish&#x27;s sudden resignation, but he did not want the job permanently. Souness was appointed Liverpool manager, having signed a five-year contract, on 16 April 1991, leaving Rangers with four games of their season remaining.

Souness took over at Anfield just before Liverpool surrendered their defence of the English league title to Arsenal. He made a major reorganisation of the squad in his first six months as manager, bringing in Dean Saunders for an English record of £2.9 million as well as defenders Mark Wright and Rob Jones and midfielder Mark Walters. He also gave a regular place in the team to 19-year-old midfielder Steve McManaman, whose debut had come under Dalglish in December 1990, and a debut to one of Dalglish&#x27;s last signings, teenage midfielder Jamie Redknapp. At the end of that campaign, Souness gave a professional contract to 17-year-old striker Robbie Fowler.

During the 1991–92 season, Liverpool rarely looked like serious title contenders, but it soon became a two-horse race between Leeds United and Manchester United. Leeds eventually won the title, while Liverpool came sixth. They returned to European competition that season after six years of isolation following the Heysel disaster of 1985, and reached the UEFA Cup quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by Genoa. By April 1992, they were only in contention for the FA Cup.

Souness had major heart surgery in April 1992. A controversy arose after the FA Cup semi-final against Portsmouth, which Liverpool needed a replay and penalties to win. In the event of a victory for Liverpool, an interview was due to be published in &quot;the Sun&quot;, a British tabloid, with Souness celebrating the win and his own successful surgery. The photograph which accompanied the interview was of Souness, in his hospital ward, kissing his girlfriend with joy at his own recovery and his team&#x27;s win. The interview was due to go in alongside the match report on 14 April 1992, but the late end to the game meant the deadline for publication was missed and the report, with interview and photograph, went in on 15 April instead – the third anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster. Many Liverpool fans reacted with fury after seeing the interview was conducted with &quot;The Sun&quot;, a newspaper which had been reviled and widely shunned on Merseyside following its false reporting on the disaster. Souness himself had restricted Liverpool players from talking to &quot;The Sun&quot;. Although he apologised at the time, Souness has since said that he probably should have resigned at that point. There were continued calls from many fans for Souness to resign or be sacked. Souness attended the 1992 FA Cup Final, which Liverpool won 2–0 against Sunderland, against the advice of his doctors.

1992–93 was an even more frustrating season for Souness. Just after the start of the season, he sold Dean Saunders to Aston Villa. While Saunders was a key player in Villa&#x27;s near-successful title challenge, his successor Paul Stewart proved to be a huge disappointment, scoring just one league goal from 32 appearances over the next two seasons, struggling with injuries as well as inconsistent form. Top scorer Ian Rush was having a difficult time scoring goals, and Liverpool spent much of the season in the bottom half of the table. They entered March still only in 15th place, but an excellent final quarter of the season, in which Rush scored 11 Premier League goals, saw them finish sixth. This time there was no success in any of the cup competitions, meaning that there would be no European competition for Liverpool in the 1993–94 season. Aside from the six seasons when Liverpool were banned from European competitions, this was the first time since 1963 that Liverpool had failed to qualify for Europe.

The pressure on Souness continued to mount throughout 1993, but he made another attempt at revitalising Liverpool by signing defender Julian Dicks and striker Nigel Clough for the 1993–94 season. The season began well, but the disappointing results quickly returned. Souness finally resigned as Liverpool manager at the end of January 1994 when Liverpool had suffered a shock FA Cup exit at the hands of Bristol City. He was succeeded by long-serving coach Roy Evans.

Souness&#x27;s three-year reign as Liverpool manager was not remembered with fondness by the club&#x27;s fans, although his reign did bring some success to the club. Apart from guiding them to FA Cup success in 1992, he also oversaw the breakthrough of three young players who would go on to be a key part in Liverpool&#x27;s improved performances over the next five years – Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler and Jamie Redknapp, allowing them to play and develop in the first team where they went on to inspire an upturn in fortunes at Anfield.

Souness later said in his autobiography &quot;The Management Years&quot; that he faced an uphill struggle from the start for a number of reasons. The majority of key players were in their late 20s or early 30s when he took over, and some appeared to have passed their peak. He knew they had to be eventually replaced and he doubted the desire of some of them. He said the senior players also appeared not to want to listen to him and may have resented his disciplinarian approach to their behaviour, and also claimed a number of players – including Peter Beardsley and Steve McMahon – asked for improved terms in their contracts or they would move elsewhere. In the end, Beardsley, McMahon and Houghton were sold, seemingly before suitable replacements were found and these key components of Kenny Dalglish&#x27;s great side were not adequately replaced. Souness said Ian Rush and Ray Houghton had also questioned why new signings like Mark Wright were earning more money than them, despite not yet having won any trophies. The sale of Peter Beardsley to local rivals Everton was a controversial move, and the player performed well for Everton in his two seasons there, and continued to do well despite his advancing years during four seasons at Newcastle United.

Souness also claims Liverpool chief executive Peter Robinson at the time had warned him this was a Liverpool team in decline and that they only had one player who was still &quot;great&quot; - John Barnes. Souness was left disappointed by Barnes as he was at this time frequently suffering from injuries, and in particular suffered a ruptured achilles tendon which was to eventually affect his acceleration therefore affecting his playing style, and not giving Souness what he wanted from a vintage Barnes at his peak, which was what he saw as a &quot;devastating winger with pace and goalscoring touch&quot;. He had also said Barnes was once the &quot;best player in Britain&quot; but unfortunately only saw flashes of his brilliance.

Souness also fell out with former Liverpool teammates Tommy Smith and Phil Thompson during his time in charge at Anfield. In his autobiography, Souness said that Thompson, the reserve team manager, was overheard angrily criticising his tactics and purchases behind his back. This was overheard by Manchester United assistant manager Brian Kidd and relayed to Walter Smith, who was so alarmed by Thompson&#x27;s behaviour that he drove from Scotland to Liverpool to tell Souness what had been said. Souness dismissed Thompson as a result and the two have remained bitter towards each other since, with Thompson claiming in his own book he would never speak to Souness again as a result.

Souness said he had a number of disputes as a Liverpool player with Thompson, including in 1981, when Thompson initially refused to speak to Souness for a while after he lost the captaincy to him; Thompson had accused Souness to his face and in front of the other Liverpool players of &quot;stealing the captaincy behind his back&quot;. They also had an argument and physical fight which took place after Thompson had accused Souness of marrying his first wife Danielle only because she was wealthy. Souness believed these incidents may have contributed to Thompson&#x27;s hostility and disrespect of him. Tommy Smith had been strongly critical of Souness in the local media at the time, and he had been caught mixing with the players and some of the coaches at Anfield despite no longer having an official position at the club. Souness banned Smith from the club areas, and said that in his last phone call with Smith, instructing him not to be seen around the official club areas, he was certain he had &quot;made an enemy for life&quot;.

===Galatasaray===
After leaving Liverpool, Souness was out of work for over a year, despite reports at the end of the 1993–94 season linking him with a return to Middlesbrough, this time as a manager, a job which went to Bryan Robson instead.

Souness went to manage Galatasaray in Turkey in June 1995, and again managed to court controversy with local issues, nearly sparking a riot after placing a large Galatasaray flag into the centre circle of the pitch of arch rivals Fenerbahçe after Galatasaray had beaten them in the Turkish Cup final on 24 April 1996. The iconic image of Souness planting the flag drew comparisons with Turkish hero Ulubatlı Hasan, who was killed as he planted the Ottoman flag at the end of the Siege of Constantinople. This earned Souness the nickname &quot;Ulubatlı Souness&quot;.

===Southampton===
Souness then returned to England to manage Southampton, but after one season he resigned, citing differences with chairman Rupert Lowe. Souness is perhaps best remembered at Southampton for signing Senegalese player Ali Dia, supposedly on the recommendation of former FIFA World Player of the Year and former Liberian striker George Weah. Souness did not check any of Dia&#x27;s credentials as a good player, which proved to be a hoax instigated by Dia&#x27;s friend (who had made the initial call). When Dia made his sole appearance in the Premier League, as a substitute for Matt Le Tissier, he performed amazingly poorly and was substituted. A notable high point of the season was a 6–3 home win over defending champions Manchester United in late October.

The &quot;Saints&quot; managed to avoid relegation from the Premier League in 1996–97, finishing 16th, but he resigned towards the end of May 1997. Within days, it was reported Everton, Liverpool&#x27;s local rivals, were interested in appointing Souness as manager to succeed Joe Royle, but Howard Kendall was appointed for a third time instead.

===Torino===
After his stint at Southampton, Souness went back to Italy to become the coach at Torino. When he arrived, it was clear he would have no say in what players he could buy or sell, as the club&#x27;s owner made those decisions. Souness lasted just four months before being dismissed.

===Benfica===
In November 1997, Souness was appointed by Benfica&#x27;s new chairman João Vale e Azevedo, who promised to return the club to its former glory. The Scottish manager brought several British players from the Premier League, including defenders Steve Harkness and Gary Charles, midfielders Michael Thomas and Mark Pembridge and forwards Dean Saunders and Brian Deane, as well as refusing to sign emerging talent Deco. 18 months later, Souness left the club and stated, &quot;Vale e Azevedo lies when he looks in the eyes. Be careful, this man is dangerous.&quot;

===Blackburn Rovers===
Souness returned to the English league in March 2000 to become manager of Blackburn Rovers, earning promotion back to the Premier League in his first full season. During his four-year spell at Blackburn, he initially got the very best out of talented youngsters such as Damien Duff, David Dunn and Matt Jansen, as well as bringing Henning Berg back to the club and signing big name players like Andy Cole, Tugay Kerimoğlu, Barry Ferguson, Brad Friedel and Dwight Yorke. Cole and Jansen scored in Blackburn&#x27;s 2–1 League Cup final victory over Tottenham Hotspur in February 2002. Blackburn were still battling against relegation back to Division One when they lifted the League Cup, but went on to finish a secure 10th in the final table.

Souness then guided Blackburn to a sixth-place finish in 2003 and took them into the UEFA Cup for a second successive season, before finishing a disappointing 15th in 2003–04.

===Newcastle United===
Souness left Blackburn in September 2004 to become manager of Newcastle United following the sacking of 71-year-old Sir Bobby Robson a few games into the season.

Despite a promising start on Tyneside, Souness quickly fell out with a number of players, including Welsh international Craig Bellamy, who left the club to join Blackburn, after being loaned out to Celtic. Laurent Robert, Olivier Bernard and Jermaine Jenas were also reported to have left the club on bad terms with Souness. The club finished 14th in the league (their lowest finish since promotion in 1993) and despite making it to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup and the semi-finals of the FA Cup, Souness found himself under mounting pressure from &quot;Toon&quot; supporters.

Newcastle had a slow start to the 2005–06 season, but Souness was hoping that the purchase of Michael Owen from Real Madrid on 30 August for an estimated club-record fee of £17 million would help to turn the club&#x27;s fortunes around and bring a repeat of the top five finishes achieved during Robson&#x27;s final three seasons. Newcastle recorded a win in the Tyne-Wear derby against Sunderland (3–2), and went on to win their next three matches, keeping three clean sheets. Souness seemed to be tightening up Newcastle in defence, with six clean sheets in Newcastle&#x27;s first 12 games of the season, as many as the whole of the preceding campaign. His decision to reunite the former England striker duo Alan Shearer and Michael Owen initially appeared shrewd. However, Owen cracked the fifth metatarsal of his right foot when he clashed with England teammate Paul Robinson during a 2–0 defeat at Tottenham on 30 December 2005 and was out of action for three months, adding to the club&#x27;s injury woes.

Souness was criticised for an apparent lack of long-term planning at Newcastle, centred on a small squad, and a consequent vulnerability to injury among his players. Expensive signings – such as Jean-Alain Boumsong for £8 million, and Albert Luque for £10 million – failed to live up to expectations. By the beginning of February 2006, Newcastle United were placed 15th in the Premier League table and sliding dangerously towards a relegation battle, despite having spent over £50million on players in the last 18 months. On 2 February 2006, Souness was sacked as manager by chairman Freddy Shepherd and replaced by United&#x27;s Youth Academy Director Glenn Roeder.

In the club&#x27;s DVD season review for the 2005–06 season, goalkeeper Shay Given and defender Robbie Elliott acknowledged Souness was under pressure at the club as a result of injuries to the squad and admitted some players were to blame for their lack of all-round effort, but also admitted there was a bad atmosphere at the training ground, with Souness seeming to favour some players over others. Alan Shearer acknowledged the fans never really accepted Souness, as well as several injuries being instrumental in damaging the team&#x27;s confidence. Chairman Freddy Shepherd declared it was the team&#x27;s formation and loss against Manchester City that prompted his decision to sack Souness.

Souness did not return to football management after leaving Newcastle.

===Stevens inquiry===

In the report of the Stevens inquiry into football corruption published in June 2007, Souness was criticised for an apparent lack of consistency:Souness issued a statement denying any wrongdoing:The Stevens inquiry then issued a clarification:In July 2007, Newcastle United was raided by the City of London Police, who were investigating transfer deals involving Newcastle, Rangers and Portsmouth. Two Souness transfers, Jean-Alain Boumsong and Amdy Faye, were among a list of 17 transfers not cleared by Quest. The Boumsong deal in particular was so odd that it was widely commented upon at the time. Four months after succeeding Sir Bobby Robson as manager, Souness was in his first transfer window as Newcastle manager. At £8.2 million, Boumsong was his first big signing and Souness said he would replace Jonathan Woodgate in the Newcastle defence, which had conceded several leads earlier in the season.

Newcastle were aware of Boumsong prior to his move from Auxerre to Rangers on a free transfer. Robson had travelled to France to watch him, but he declined the opportunity to sign Boumsong. Liverpool were also interested in signing Boumsong. Robson&#x27;s doubts were confirmed when Boumsong marked Alan Shearer in a pre-season game against Rangers. Shearer came off to speak in dismissive terms about the Frenchman&#x27;s lack of physicality, and he later mentioned Boumsong&#x27;s previous availability on a free transfer on television.

When Boumsong was given a torrid time by DJ Campbell during his Newcastle debut against Yeading in the FA Cup, doubts over the wisdom of the transfer mushroomed. The agent in the Boumsong and Faye transfers was Willie McKay. On 7 November 2007, Quest issued the following statement about McKay&#x27;s dealings:

==Career after management==

===Media work===
Souness has appeared as a television analyst in the UK and Ireland regularly since his managerial career ended. He was one of the main analysts on Sky Sports coverage of the Premier League, regularly appearing on the &quot;Super Sunday&quot; programme featuring the biggest head-to-head matches, and was one of the main pundits used on their UEFA Champions League coverage until they lost the rights in 2015. He left Sky Sports on 30 April 2023. 

Souness previously featured on RTÉ&#x27;s live coverage of the UEFA Champions League and on their highlights show &quot;Premier Soccer Saturday&quot;, covering the Premier League. He was also regularly seen covering RTÉ&#x27;s coverage of Republic of Ireland football internationals. Souness contributed to RTÉ Sport&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, alongside Johnny Giles, Eamon Dunphy, Liam Brady, Ronnie Whelan, Denis Irwin, Ossie Ardiles and Dietmar Hamann for the duration of the group stage.

During analysis of the World Cup match between Ghana and Serbia on 13 June 2010, Souness made a controversial comment involving Nemanja Vidić and Fernando Torres live on air, commenting, &quot;Vidic got raped... sorry, taken apart by Torres at Liverpool&quot;, which forced RTÉ to censure Souness and publicly apologise after a commercial break.

As a pundit, Souness is also known for his frequent criticism of Manchester United&#x27;s Paul Pogba. Pogba himself is unaware what he has done to warrant such criticism. Instead, he affirms he has no idea of Souness&#x27; existence.

===Possible returns to management===
In June 2006, the chairman of Crystal Palace, Simon Jordan, said he wished to discuss with Souness a role in managing the club following the departure of Iain Dowie. However, no contract materialised.

Souness looked to be the front-runner for the Bolton Wanderers manager&#x27;s job following the departure of his former Liverpool teammate Sammy Lee in October 2007, but later pulled out of the running when it became apparent the job was set to be given to Gary Megson. At around the same time, Souness was linked with taking over the Republic of Ireland national team.

In January 2008, Souness announced he would be willing to return to Newcastle United as manager, following the departure of Sam Allardyce and the arrival of the club&#x27;s new ownership and board. However, United only interviewed Harry Redknapp and Kevin Keegan for the position, with Keegan soon after being appointed with the job; Souness&#x27;s interest has never been publicly acknowledged by the club.

Following the sacking of Blackburn Rovers manager Paul Ince on 16 December 2008, Souness was linked with a return to the club as manager. However, Sam Allardyce was appointed as the new manager on 17 December, after Souness said he had no contact from Blackburn about the position.

Having been linked with the Scotland national team in November 2009, Souness stated he has no desire to return to management at any level.

===Bid for Wolverhampton Wanderers===
In January 2007, it was reported by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that Souness was heading a £20 million consortium to take over Football League Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers. He attended a Wolves game as a VIP guest and made a formal offer for the club, asking to see the club&#x27;s finances. The bid was rejected by the Wolves board, which felt it undervalued the club. Souness did not make a repeat offer for the club and it was later sold to another investor.

==Biographies==
In 1985, Souness wrote an autobiography called &quot;No Half Measures&quot;. In 1999, he wrote another book chronicling his post-playing career up to and including his spell at Southampton, entitled &quot;Souness: The Management Years&quot;.

==Life outside football==

===Personal life===
Souness&#x27; first wife was Danielle Wilson; they met in 1982 and married in 1984. He adopted her young daughter, and they had three more children together. They separated in 1989 and later divorced.

Souness has been married to Karen Souness, his second wife, since 1994. Together, the couple have a son and Souness has two stepchildren from Karen&#x27;s previous relationship.

In 2010, Souness sold the family home in Colinton in Edinburgh for £3.5m to Fred Goodwin, and moved to a newly developed property in Sandbanks, Poole, Dorset.

During a discussion about climate change on Sky Sports &quot;Super Sunday&quot; in 2021, Souness announced that he had been following a vegan diet for the previous three years.

===Political views===
Souness&#x27; political views have, at various points in his career, generated comment.

In 1982, Souness and teammate Sammy Lee made cameo appearances, as themselves, in an episode of the BBC&#x27;s Liverpudlian drama series &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot;. Written by Alan Bleasdale, the series offered a critique of Thatcherism – and in particular the large-scale unemployment then evident in urban Britain – apparently at odds with Souness&#x27;s own Conservative politics.

In 2007, in the lead-up to elections to the Scottish Parliament, Souness was one of 15 prominent current and former footballers named in a newspaper advertisement urging &quot;every patriotic Scot to help maintain Scotland&#x27;s place in the United Kingdom which has served Scotland well.&quot;

===Charitable work===
Souness launched a fundraising campaign for DEBRA, a charity seeking a cure for epidermolysis bullosa, in May 2023. As part of the fundraising activities he announced plans to swim the English Channel. On 18 June 2023, he completed the swim, in a wetsuit, as part of a six-person relay team, raising £1m for the charity.

===Reputation===

Souness was described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as &quot;one of the most fearsome men in the game.&quot; However, his Liverpool team-mate Michael Robinson said of Souness in 2016: &quot;I found him a very personal, cuddly chap who was actually quite vulnerable about being a human being with emotions. To this day, he still tries very hard not to be this lovely cuddly person, when really he is.&quot;

<text>Ludovico Consorti (1902–1979) was an Italian sculptor who built the bronze Holy Door in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in 1950. In 1980, a year after his death, he received an award from the city of Grosseto for artistic merits.

== Biography ==

<doc id="881957" wikidata="Q5099050" url="?curid=881957" title="Chillicothe Gazette">
<text>The Chillicothe Gazette is Ohio&#x27;s oldest newspaper. The daily newspaper is based in Chillicothe, Ohio, the seat of Ross County, and is owned by Gannett. A complete file is in the library of the Ohio Historical Society in Cincinnati.

== History ==
On November 9, 1793, William Maxwell published the first edition of &quot;The Centinel of the Northwest Territory,&quot; a weekly newspaper in Cincinnati. It was the first paper published in the Northwest Territory.

Subscription was &quot;250 cents&quot; per annum, and 7 cents a single copy. The motto of the &quot;Centinel&quot;: &quot;Open to all Parties -- but influenced by none,&quot; expressed the publisher&#x27;s aims: to afford an isolated community a medium to make known its varied wants and to record local happenings, as well as those of the outside world.

The newspaper was published weekly until June 1796 when it was sold to Edmund Freeman who merged it with &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot;. Around 1800, the paper moved to Chillicothe, Ohio, when the government of the Northwest Territory relocated to that city 

The paper eventually assumed the name &quot;The Chillicothe Gazette&quot;. Gannett sold the paper in the 1990s to Community Newspaper Holdings, who in turn sold to The Thomson Corporation. When Thomson exited the newspaper business in the late 1990s, Gannett bought it back.

<text>Cox Enterprises, Inc. is an American privately held global conglomerate headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, with approximately 55,000 employees and $21 billion in total revenue. Its major operating subsidiaries are Cox Media Group, Cox Communications, and Cox Automotive. The company&#x27;s major national brands include AutoTrader, Kelley Blue Book, Manheim Auctions and more.

Through Cox Automotive, the company&#x27;s international operations stretch across Asia, Australia, Europe and Latin America. Cox Enterprises is currently led by Alexander C. Taylor, a fourth-generation Cox family member and great-grandson of founder James M. Cox. James M. Cox&#x27;s grandson, James C. Kennedy, and other members of the Cox family are on the company&#x27;s board of directors.

On March 2, 2020, the sale of Cox Media Group&#x27;s Ohio newspapers was finalized back to Cox Enterprises, and subsequently formed Cox First Media. This move was to ensure the publications would remain daily newspapers serving the southwest Ohio region.

==History==
===Founding===

The company was founded in Dayton, Ohio, by James M. Cox, who purchased the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; in 1898. Cox became a member of Ohio&#x27;s delegation to the United States House of Representatives and then the governor of Ohio. He was the Democratic Party candidate for president of the United States in the presidential election of 1920, running unsuccessfully on a ticket that included Franklin D. Roosevelt as the vice presidential candidate.

===Telecommunications===
In 1935, at the urging of Governor Cox&#x27;s son James M. Cox Jr., Cox entered the radio business starting with WHIO in Dayton. Governor Cox purchased &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot; in 1939 as well as radio station WSB. On September 29, 1948, Cox&#x27;s WSB-TV, later referred to as the &quot;Eyes of the South&quot;, aired the first television broadcast in Atlanta. WHIO-TV in Ohio&#x27;s Miami Valley soon followed, airing its first broadcasts on February 23, 1949.

In 1950, Governor Cox purchased &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;, and in 1962 his son purchased three cable television systems in central Pennsylvania with a total of 11,800 subscribers. The two combined their broadcasting and cable businesses into the publicly-traded Cox Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in 1964, though the newspaper business remained independent as Cox Enterprises.

In 1966, Cox expanded its holdings to purchase television syndicator Walter Schwimmer, followed in 1967, by the purchase of television production company Bing Crosby Productions. Cox subsequently sold off its syndication unit to a new production company Telecom Productions in 1970. Cox would reenter the television syndication business, when Cox&#x27;s subsidiary TeleRep, established Television Program Enterprises in the late 1970s, before merging with Rysher Entertainment in 1993.

As the cable business expanded, it was eventually consolidated and spun off into the new privately-owned Cox Cable Communications (CCC) in 1968, which quickly became the second-largest cable TV company. Upon Jim Cox Jr.&#x27;s death in 1974, he left his two sisters, Anne Cox Chambers and Barbara Cox, in control of 95% of the privately-owned company.

In 1982, CBC moved its headquarters to the Atlanta area and changed its name to Cox Communications, Inc. The company was eventually consolidated into Cox Enterprises. In 1988 then-Executive Vice President Jim Kennedy, grandson of Governor Cox, was promoted to CEO and chairman of Cox Enterprises.

In 1986, Cox Enterprises launched a new subsidiary Cox Video, which lined up eleven commitments for original video programs, four of them came from Media Home Entertainment, which are comedy-based tapes and seven of them came from Fox Hills Video, which are reality-based tapes, both subsidiaries of Heron Communications, and co-production budgets involve a total of $1.5 million, and the Cox Video unit has also acquired the rights to produce video adaptations of the magazines and exercise regulations of Joe Weider, which included &quot;Muscle &amp; Fitness&quot;, &quot;Flex&quot; and &quot;Men&#x27;s Fitness &amp; Shape&quot;, and Peter Bieler acting as executive producer on tapes produced by Cox Video, which also served as executive vice president of the studio, and the company is planning on to do regular releases that sometimes make use of the magazine&#x27;s names and will be positioned as companions to Wieder&#x27;s widely-distributed equipment, and the MHE comedies ranked at the $100,000 range and the Fox Hills tapes ranked at the $100,000 range.

Over the ensuing decades, Cox made pioneering investments and became the first company to bundle telephone, highspeed internet and digital cable television over a single broadband network.

===Automotive===
Cox entered the automotive industry in 1965 with the purchase of Black Book. Three years later, Manheim was purchased by Cox as well. In the 1980s, Manheim acquired its first non-U.S. auction in Toronto, Canada, making Cox an international company. In 1997, Autotrader.com was founded revolutionizing the way people buy and sell used cars. In 2014, Cox Enterprises brought its automotive-related businesses (which by then included and NextGear Capital) together under the Cox Automotive name.

==Subsidiaries==

===Cox Communications===

Cox Communications formed an alliance with the Cleveland Clinic to take Healthcare to the home in February 2015. The company has also been deploying residential gigabit internet service.

In 2019, Cox Communications earned the No. 11 spot on the 2019 DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity list. This marks the fourteenth time the company has been recognized among the nation&#x27;s corporate diversity leaders.

===Cox Automotive===

===Cox Media Group===
Cox Media Group (CMG) is an integrated broadcasting, publishing, direct marketing and digital media company.

In 2019, Cox Enterprises reached an agreement with Apollo Global Management to sell a majority interest in Cox Media Group&#x27;s broadcast television stations, including the company&#x27;s radio, newspaper, and TV properties in Ohio, and its local OTT advertising subsidiary – Gamut. Smart Media from Cox. based in New York. On February 10, 2020, Cox Enterprises bought back the Ohio newspapers it sold to Apollo Global Management after the FCC required Apollo to reduce the daily newspapers to 3-day publication or sell them. Cox announced the newspapers would continue 7-day publication.

&quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, in addition to the media agency Ideabar, will continue to be part of Cox Enterprises.

In August 2022, Cox Enterprises agreed to acquire Axios Media, with the deal being valued at $525 million.

In February 2024, Cox agreed to buy out government software company OpenGov, in which it already holds minority interest, with the deal valuing the company at $1.8billion.

<text>The first USS &quot;Bainbridge&quot; was a brig in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. She was named for Commodore William Bainbridge, U.S. Naval Commissioner 1824–1827.

&quot;Bainbridge&quot; was launched on April 26, 1842, by Boston Navy Yard and commissioned on December 16, 1842, Commander Z. F. Johnston in command.

Sailing from Boston on January 26, 1843, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; served with the Home Squadron until returning to New York on May 3, 1844. From June 26, 1844 – October 10, 1847, she served with the Brazil Squadron. She laid up for most of the next year, and from 10 April 1848 – 2 July 1850 was with the Africa Squadron. She departed New York on November 2 and until September 1856 cruised with both the African and Brazil Squadrons. She returned to Norfolk on September 10, 1856.

Laid up at Norfolk Naval Shipyard from September 18, 1856 – April 28, 1858, she departed Hampton Roads, Virginia on May 18, 1858, to join Commodore William B. Shubrick&#x27;s Paraguay expedition for operations against Paraguay in retaliation for the attack on in 1855. &quot;Bainbridge&quot; arrived at Asunción, Paraguay, in company with the squadron in January 1859 and after the matter had been peacefully settled remained with the Brazil and African Squadrons until departing Rio de Janeiro on September 17, 1860. She arrived at Boston on November 9 and was placed out of commission.

Recommissioned on May 1, 1861, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; sailed for the Gulf of Mexico on 21 May and cruised there until June 1862. While in the area she captured two schooners and assisted in the capture of one steamer. On August 3, 1862, she sailed from New York to join the East Gulf Blockading Squadron at Key West, Florida.

In September 1862, she was ordered to Aspinwall, Granadine Confederation, where — from November 22–24 — a severe storm forced her to jettison all spars, sails, gun carriages, howitzers, shot, powder, provisions, and water. After extensive repairs she sailed for New York, arriving in May 1863. On August 21, 1863, while proceeding to her station with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, she capsized off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, with the loss of all but one of her crew.

<doc id="881973" wikidata="Q2062481" url="?curid=881973" title="Paul Slovic">
<text>Paul Slovic (born 1938) is an American professor of psychology at the University of Oregon and the president of Decision Research, a collection of scientists from all over the nation and in other countries that study decision-making in times when risks are involved. He was also the president for the Society of Risk Analysis until 1984. He earned his undergraduate degree at Stanford University in 1959 and his PhD in psychology at the University of Michigan in 1964 and has received honorary doctorates from the Stockholm School of Economics and the University of East Anglia. He is past president of the Society for Risk Analysis and in 1991 received its Distinguished Contribution Award. In 1993, he received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association, and in 1995 he received the Outstanding Contribution to Science Award from the Oregon Academy of Science. In 2016 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

Slovic studies human judgment, decision making, and risk perception, and has published extensively on these topics. He is considered, with Baruch Fischhoff and Sarah Lichtenstein, a leading theorist and researcher in the risk perception field (the psychometric paradigm, the affect heuristic, and &quot;risk as feeling&quot;).

His most recent work examines “psychic numbing” and the failure to respond to mass human tragedies.

==Major theories==

Affect Heuristic - this is the ability to make a quick emotional decision in time of crisis. Slovic says that even if there is a bad situation, if we have positive feelings toward something it lowers people&#x27;s perception of risks but enhances their perception of benefits.

Slovic contributed towards the psychometric paradigm of risk perception. He found that people usually perceived most activities as having a high risk. He also found that if someone gained pleasure from something they saw the risk level being low. This shows that risk levels can depend on the individual&#x27;s personal belief and emotions of a specific risk.

Psychophysical Numbing - this is the idea that people are not as affected by the loss of life depending on how it is presented. Slovic says that people cannot connect on an emotional level when being presented with large numbers.

==Publications==

In &quot;Perception of Risk Posed by Extreme Events&quot;, Slovic discusses what research says about people&#x27;s perceived risk when associated with extreme events. The way people think action should take place is based on their perceptions. These perceptions can vary from people&#x27;s status, background, education, biology, etc. The different perceptions decide how risky a choice of action is in extreme events over another. Risk perceptions are connected between emotions and reason, which creates rational behavior. Slovic explains what risk actually is. He says it is a hazard, probability, it has consequences, and threat. Since it has so many subjective meanings tied to it, it often causes communication failure. Risk perceptions are studied in three major ways: axiomatic measurement paradigm, socio-cultural paradigm, and psychometric paradigm. The axiomatic measurement looks at how people view consequences of a risky choice and how it might impact their lives. The Socio-cultural looks at the “effect of group and culture level variable on risk perception”. Psychometric paradigm looks at how people react emotionally to a risky situation that “affects judgments of the riskiness of physical, environmental and material risk”. 
When public officials overreact to a new/unknown danger it is likely because they overestimate its true danger or for reassurance for the public.

“If I Look at the Mass I will Never Act” discusses how most people are caring individuals and they are willing to help those in need. The problem is when those in need are part of a mass group of people. The question that Slovic asks is why do people ignore genocide? He uses psychological research to show how mass murders do not connect in people&#x27;s minds as being bad as they are. He discusses the lessons that is learned from past genocide. He talks about how we said “’Never again’ after liberation of Nazi death camps” but we have continued to have instances of genocide all over the world. America has reacted poorly to genocide. There are no ramifications to political figures if they choose to stay out of the conflict. He also looks at how the media does not do a great job of reporting the news. They are focused on other issues that are emphasizing the bigger problems. When discussing his psychological research he says how all other factors do not matter without “affect”. Affect is what tells us if something is right or wrong. “If activated feelings are pleasant, they motivate actions to reproduce the feelings. If the feelings are unpleasant, they motivate actions and thoughts anticipated to avoid the feelings” The experience of affect is what guides peoples “judgments, decisions and actions” Slovic also discusses “Attention” as being an important factor. It is necessary for the feelings. It is good for people to see the vast numbers of those murdered but it does not have the same effect as images. Slovic says, “We quickly grow numb to the facts and the math” He uses statistics to show the relationship between the numbers of people presented and our level of contributions to help them. When it was one victim it was a full ten on the scale. For eight victims the contribution dropped down to a five. What seemed to work was when the media would cover individual stories of victims. People became more willing to the help/donate in these instances. Several changes need to be made to combat this perception of mass murder. International law needs to be changed to accommodate this problem of numbness of numbers. The approach of reporting genocide also needs to change because our feelings alone do not give enough drive to stop genocide.

&quot;Facts and Fears: Societal Perception of Risk&quot;: There is statistical data for many hazards that people can perceive such as smoking, car wrecks, etc. But without interpretation of the statistics they are just numbers and they have to be given relevance in their respective context. Slovic looks at the psychology of risk assessment when managing hazards. He says that experts as general publics are needed in the assessment process and “that understanding public perceptions is crucial to effective decision making”. Through his study he looked at how people view as a perceived risk and what determines risk perception. By the end of his research he concluded that “perceived risk is quantifiable and predictable”. Not only is there a difference in perception between experts and public but also the people within the public differ as well. He found that when there is a higher perceived risk it causes higher desired reduction of that risk.

<doc id="881978" wikidata="Q7955527" url="?curid=881978" title="WSB (AM)">
<text>WSB (750 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station in Atlanta, Georgia. It simulcasts a news/talk radio format with 95.5 WSBB-FM. WSB and WSBB-FM are the flagship stations for Cox Media Group which also owns three other Atlanta radio stations and WSB-TV. WSB is among the highest billing stations in the U.S. The station&#x27;s studios and offices are in the WSB Television and Radio Group Building on West Peachtree Street in Midtown Atlanta.

WSB is powered at 50,000 watts, the maximum for commercial AM stations. WSB is a clear-channel class A station and uses a non-directional antenna. The station&#x27;s transmitter and radiating tower are seven miles (11 kilometers) northeast of Atlanta at the Northlake Tower Festival Shopping Center, off Lavista Road in Tucker, Georgia. Its daytime coverage area is not as large as 50,000-watt AM stations in other parts of the country due to Georgia&#x27;s poor ground conductivity; as such, a number of outer Atlanta suburbs only receive a grade B signal. At night, when radio waves travel farther, WSB can be heard with a good radio across much of the Southeastern United States, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Though the station is licensed for HD Radio operations, like many stations, it shut off the capability due to RF interference, a lack of demand for AM stations in the format, and the establishment of WSBB-FM to address audio quality concerns.

==History==
===Atlanta Journal===
WSB was one of the first radio stations in the South. In early 1922, there was a tremendous public interest in the then-new technology of radio broadcasting. By the end of the year, the number of authorized stations exceeded 500. In many communities, a race broke out to see who would be the first to get a station on the air. In Atlanta, the primary contenders were the two major newspapers, the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; and the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;. The &quot;Journal&quot; established a makeshift studio on the fifth floor of its building at 7 Forsyth Street. A transmitter had been ordered, but facing a delay, the newspaper arranged for the equipment used by Gordon Heidt for his amateur station to be temporarily installed. A broadcasting license was normally needed before a station could go on the air, but it was arranged to have an initial telegraphed authorization, which was sent by the Department of Commerce on the evening of March 15, 1922. The station&#x27;s debut broadcast took place that evening. The transmitter had only 100 watts of power and ice was used to cool the batteries.

The &quot;Journal&#x27;s&quot; new station was issued the randomly assigned call letters WSB. Station management would claim the call letters stood for &quot;Welcome South, Brother&quot;, even though the &quot;Journal&quot; did not specifically request those call letters. The &quot;Constitution&#x27;s&quot; station, WGM, debuted two days later on March 17. Because it also was transmitting on 360 meters, the two newspapers had to set up a time-sharing agreement allocating broadcast hours. Competition was so fierce between the two that WSB&#x27;s manager, Lambdin &quot;The Little Colonel&quot; Kay, banned any person who had previously appeared on WGM from broadcasting over WSB.

In September 1922, the Department of Commerce set aside a second entertainment wavelength, 400 meters (750 kHz) for &quot;Class B&quot; stations that had quality equipment and programming. Both WSB and WGM were assigned to this new wavelength. In May 1923, additional &quot;Class B&quot; frequencies were made available, and Atlanta was assigned the use of 700 kHz. Once again, both WSB and WGM were assigned to this new frequency. However, at the end of July, WGM permanently ceased operations, which gave WSB exclusive use of the assignment.

===NBC Red Network===
In 1927, WSB became an affiliate of the NBC Red Network. The station carried NBC&#x27;s dramas, comedies, news and sports during the &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot;. The trademark three-tone NBC chimes were first played in the WSB studios.

In the summer of 1927, WSB began transmitting on 630 kHz. On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of the Federal Radio Commission&#x27;s General Order 40, WSB was reassigned to a &quot;clear channel&quot; frequency of 740 kHz. WSB was the dominant station nationally on this frequency. In March 1941, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), WSB moved to 750 kHz, where it has been heard ever since.

Part of WSB&#x27;s programming was southern gospel music, gaining popularity throughout the region, with shows hosted by Charles Davis Tillman. The &quot;Shelby Star&quot; newspaper, in an issue dated November 1985, wrote that the talented Dan Hornsby, after the 1929 crash of the stock market, found himself working no longer for Columbia Records. He got work as the first morning show announcer for WSB. Lambdin Kay called Hornsby &quot;90% of the local talent on WSB&quot;.

===Cox Enterprises===
In 1939, the &quot;Journal&quot; newspaper and WSB radio station were sold to James Middleton Cox, the founder of what would become Cox Enterprises. Wright Bryan, a WSB news reporter as well as managing editor of the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot;, was also a stringer for NBC during World War II. He was the first war correspondent to broadcast an eyewitness account of the D-Day invasion. Bryan reported from London in the early hours of June 6, 1944. Elmo Ellis, who programmed WSB in the 1950s and 1960s, is remembered as an innovator among Southern broadcasters. He provided the on-air editorials for the station, and in the 1960s, consistently supported civil rights.

WSB won a 1946 Special Citation of Honor Peabody Award. It was awarded for its program &quot;The Harbor We Seek&quot;.
From 1925 to 1956, WSB radio, along with later co-owned stations WSB-FM and WSB-TV, operated out of the top floor of the Atlanta Biltmore Hotel in Midtown Atlanta. Afterward, the WSB stations were housed in a Colonial-style mansion with its interior specially built for broadcasting, informally known as &quot;White Columns&quot;. That location was where Peachtree Street crosses West Peachtree Street near Ansley Park. In 1998, all of the Cox&#x27;s Atlanta radio stations, as well as WSB-TV, moved into a new &quot;Digital White Columns&quot; on the same property. The original White Columns was demolished afterward.

===FM and TV stations===
In 1948, WSB added an FM sister station, WSB-FM, originally broadcasting on 104.5 MHz. The &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; had also been experimenting with FM radio, putting WCON-FM on the air the year before. When the two newspapers merged under Cox ownership in 1952, WCON-FM and WSB-FM went silent. WSB-FM returned to the air in 1955 on WCON-FM&#x27;s dial position, 98.5 FM. While it has the call letters of WSB-FM, the station traces its founding to when WCON-FM first signed on.

During its early years, when few people had FM radio receivers, WSB-FM mostly simulcast the programming on WSB. That included programs from the NBC Red Network, as well as local shows. As network programming moved from radio to television in the 1950s, WSB-AM-FM began airing a full service, middle of the road format of popular music, news, sports and information. By the late 1960s, WSB-FM was separately programmed with a beautiful music format.

Also in 1948, WSB-TV first signed on the air on September 29. It originally broadcast on Channel 8. It is the second-oldest TV station south of Washington, D.C., after WTVR-TV in Richmond, Virginia. Just as WSB aired NBC Red Network radio programming, WSB-TV was originally a primary NBC-TV affiliate. WSB-TV also carried some ABC shows. While Channel 8 was assigned to &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot;, Channel 2 was assigned to &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;, although the &quot;Constitution&quot; never got its TV station on the air. After the two newspapers came under Cox ownership, WSB-TV moved to Channel 2. The station switched networks with WXIA-TV in 1980 to become an ABC affiliate.

WSB formerly broadcast in AM stereo using the Motorola C-QUAM system during the 1980s, a period when music could still be heard on the station. The on-air talent in this era included morning hosts Russ Spooner and Dick Hemby, as well as longtime Atlanta Braves baseball announcer Skip Caray presenting morning sportscasts. As WSB&#x27;s format progressed to a full-time news-talk radio format by 1987, the AM stereo system was turned off, as it was superfluous since music had been discontinued.

Also in the 1980s, WSB discontinued its NBC affiliation. Its own news staff delivered all the newscasts, with sound and actualities supplied by AP Radio. In 2018, WSB affiliated with ABC News Radio for its world and national news coverage. Co-owned WSB-TV has been an ABC television affiliate since 1980. In 2020, the station switched to CBS News Radio.

===95.5 FM simulcast===
On August 16, 2010, WSB began a full-time simulcast on co-owned WBTS 95.5 FM, which previously played rhythmic contemporary music under the branding &quot;95.5 The Beat&quot;. That October 1, WBTS&#x27;s call letters were changed to WSBB-FM; the extra &quot;B&quot; was added to the FM call letters because Cox already owns a station with the WSB-FM call sign on 98.5. On July 31, 2019, WSB and WSBB-FM began calling themselves &quot;95.5 WSB&quot;. Despite the AM station&#x27;s wide coverage, 750 is now mentioned, along with WSBB-FM&#x27;s true call letters, during the hourly FCC-mandated station identification in a rushed form.

Cox Enterprises sold majority control of Cox Media Group to Apollo Global Management on December 17, 2019. While Cox Enterprises retains a minority stake in the company, the sale effectively separated the WSB stations from the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, which remains wholly owned by Cox Enterprises.

WSB&#x27;s Scott Slade hosted &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Morning News&quot; until February 2023, when he stepped back from full-time hosting. He was succeeded by evening news anchor Chris Chandler, and remains semi-retired as a fill-in host. In April 2023, 31-year morning news host Marcy Williams retired from WSB. She calculated she wrote more than 300,000 radio news stories.

==Programming==
===News and Talk===
WSB and WSBB-FM mostly air local news and talk shows. Weekdays begin at 5 am with &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Morning News&quot;, anchored by Chris Chandler, Judd Hickinbotham and Cheryl Castro. Traffic reports and weather forecasts are featured every six minutes. The WSB Skycopter covered traffic from the air from 1965 to 2024, when parent company Total Traffic allowed the contract to expire. After retiring from his longtime daily radio show in 2020, Clark Howard now provides consumer reports. In middays, afternoons and early evenings, local talk hosts include Erick Erickson, Mark Arum, Eric Von Haessler and Shelley Wynter. At 9 pm, WSB carries &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; recorded that afternoon. Overnight, repeats of local weekday shows are heard.

Weekends feature shows on gardening, home repair, cars, real estate, health and money, some of which are paid brokered programming. Syndicated weekend shows include &quot;Bill Handel on the Law, The Kim Komando Show, Eye on Travel with Peter Greenberg&quot; and &quot;Face The Nation&quot;. WSB and WSBB-FM are affiliates of CBS News Radio, and carry twice-hourly news updates in overnight hours. The stations have a news sharing agreement with WSB-TV.

===Sports===
WSB has long served as the flagship radio station for the University of Georgia Bulldogs Radio Network, carrying its football and basketball games. In past years, WSB also served as the flagship station for Atlanta Braves baseball, Atlanta Falcons football and Atlanta Hawks basketball. WSB carried Braves baseball coverage from 1966, the year the Milwaukee Braves moved to Atlanta, until 1991. Braves games moved to 640 WGST from 1992 until 1994.

In 1995, the team returned to WSB, the season in which the Braves won the World Series. That same year, Atlanta Hawks game coverage was also picked up by the station. From 1995 until 2004, WSB branded itself as the &quot;Sports Voice of the South&quot;, carrying play-by-play game coverage of Braves baseball, Hawks basketball and Bulldogs football and basketball. In 2019, Braves baseball moved to 680 WCNN. The Falcons and Hawks are now heard on 92.9 WZGC.

<text>Clarence John &quot;Bud&quot; Brown Jr. (June 18, 1927 – January 26, 2022) was an American politician and publisher who served as a Republican United States Representative from the 7th District of Ohio, from 1965 to 1983. He also served as the United States Deputy Secretary of Commerce and Acting Secretary of Commerce in the Reagan administration from 1983 to 1988.

==Early life and education==
Brown was born in Columbus, Ohio, the son of Ethel (née McKinney) and United States Representative Clarence J. Brown. He attended Western High School in Washington, D.C., and graduated from Duke University in 1947 and Harvard Business School, with an M.B.A., in 1949.

==Career==
Brown served in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946 (V-12 Navy College Training Program) and again from 1950 to 1953 in the Korean War. Before entering the service, Brown had started working in the newspaper business for his father&#x27;s family-owned Brown Publishing Company, from youth to 1953, and from 1957 to 2010. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Brown and his family lived in Urbana, Ohio, 90 miles north of Cincinnati, where the headquarters of the publishing company was based.

Brown served as president from 1965 to 1976, and later as chairman of the board. The company had interests in a wide network of newspapers across the country but, due to the rapidly changing business as a result of technology, it ceased operations in 2010 after 90 years.

==Political career==
Brown was first elected to the Eighty-ninth Congress, by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of his father Clarence Brown in 1965, and reelected to the eight succeeding Congresses (November 2, 1965, to January 3, 1983). He was not a candidate for reelection to the Ninety-eighth Congress in 1982, as he ran for Governor of Ohio that year, losing to Richard Celeste.

He became involved in Republican Party politics, serving as a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1984. Ronald Reagan appointed Brown as Deputy Secretary of Commerce and Acting Secretary of Commerce; he served from 1983 to 1988. He was a member of the board of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation from 1988 to 1989, and he was president and chief executive officer of the United States Capitol Historical Society from 1992 to 1999.

==Personal life and death==
Brown was married to Joyce Helen (née Eldridge) Brown, a conductor, composer and classical pianist. They married on June 11, 1955 in a garden ceremony at the home of Roy Eldridge and Helen Eldridge in the town Franklin, Ohio, his wife&#x27;s hometown. They had four children: Beth (c. 1957–1964); Clancy, an actor, Cathy, and Roy, who followed his father into newspaper publishing and politics.

Bud Brown died from complications of COVID-19 in Urbana, Ohio, on January 26, 2022, at the age of 94.

<doc id="881983" wikidata="Q3325072" url="?curid=881983" title="Jaguar XK engine">
<text>The Jaguar XK is an inline 6-cylinder dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) engine produced by Jaguar Cars between 1949 and 1992. Introduced as a 3.4-litre, it earned fame on both the road and track, being produced in five hemispherical head displacements between 2.4 and 4.2-litres for Jaguar passenger cars, with other sizes being made by Jaguar and privateers for racing. A de-rated version was also used in certain military vehicles built by Alvis and Daimler.

==Early development==
Prior to World War II, SS Cars (which changed its name to &quot;Jaguar&quot; in 1945) used three engines produced by the Standard Motor Company: a 1.5-litre 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder engines of 2.5 and 3.5 litres. Sir William Lyons and his engine designers; William Heynes (Chief Engineer), Walter Hassan, Claude Baily, and Harry Weslake are widely reported to have discussed a new range of replacements whilst fire-watching on the roof of the SS factory in Swallow Road, Coventry, during German World War II bombing raids. Rather than developing prototype engines immediately after the war, it is claimed that Jaguar&#x27;s wartime engine developments went far beyond mere discussion and design, extending to the construction and testing of several prototype engines as early as 1943.

The initial aim was to produce a series of engines of higher than normal output that would be able to stay ahead of the competition without revision for many years and which Sir William insisted also had to &quot;look good&quot;. In 1942-43, a range of configurations was considered and it was concluded that, for good breathing and high brake mean effective pressure (BMEP), the new engines would need vee-opposed valves operating in hemispherical combustion chambers. Two configurations of this type were selected for comparison in 1943 and the prototypes named &quot;XG&quot; and &quot;XF&quot;. The XG 4-cylinder of 1,776 cc, first tested in October 1943, was based on the 1.5-litre Standard block and used its single cam-in-block to operate the opposed valves via a complicated crossover pushrod arrangement, similar to that of the pre-war BMW 328. The XF 4-cylinder of 1,732 cc used the now familiar dual overhead cam (DOHC) configuration and was first tested in November 1944. The XG was found to suffer from excessive pushrod and rocker noise and gas flow figures through its vertical valve ports did not equal those of the horizontal ports on the XF. Therefore, from these two options, the DOHC XF layout was selected.

4-cyl engine development progressed as follows:
* XG Pushrod engine 73 x 106 x 4 1776 cc May to Nov 1944
* XF 75 x 98 x 4 1732 cc Nov 1944 to Jun 1945
* XK1 (first of Heynes’ 4 x XJs) 76.25 x 98 x 4 1790 cc Oct 1945 to Nov 1946
* XK2 76.25 x 98 x 4 1790 cc Feb to Sep 1946
* XK3 76.25 x 98 x 4 1790 cc Dec 1946 to Feb 1947
* XK4 76.25 x 98 x 4 1790 cc Nov 1946 to Dec 1947
* Gardner Engine (used in record-breaking MG car) 1970 cc 1948 
* XK Number 1 3-bearing crank 1970 cc 1949-1952
* XK Number 2 3-bearing crank 1970 cc 1950-1952
* XK 5-bearing crank 1970 cc 1953

By September 1947 a 3.2-litre 6-cylinder version had been produced, called the &quot;XJ 6-cylinder&quot;, which was intended to replace both Standard-based 6-cylinder units. Testing showed the need for higher torque at low speeds than this engine could produce and hence it was &#x27;stroked&#x27; to 3,442 cc to form the &quot;XK 6-cylinder&quot;, which saw its debut in an open two-seat XK120 sports car at the 1948 London Motor Show. Following this the XK powered the Jaguar Mark VII and a number of other models in subsequent years.

The XG prototype soldiered on as a component testbed until 1948. There also existed an &quot;XK 4-cylinder&quot; of 1,790 cc, also first tested in October 1945 and remaining under development alongside the XK 6-cylinder units. At the time of William Heynes&#x27; paper presented to the IMechE in February 1953, the XK 4-cylinder was still referred to as being under development. It was only finally dropped as a possible production engine later in 1953, by which time it had been realised that Jaguar&#x27;s image in the market had moved beyond the need for a replacement for the old 1.5-litre Standard 4-cylinder unit.

Because the 6-cylinder XK prototypes were found to be so much more refined than the 4-cylinder versions, in 1951 a 1,986 cc 6-cylinder version of the XK 6-cylinder was built to see if it would suffice as a smaller scale engine. By 1954 this had grown to 2,483 cc and it was this short-block version of the XK 6-cylinder that was fitted to the new compact Jaguar 2.4-litre (retrospectively known as the Mark 1) released in that year. None of the 4-cylinder prototypes ever advanced to production but Lt. Col. Goldie Gardner&#x27;s speed record team did fit a 1970 cc version to the MG streamliner EX-135 in 1948 to take the 2,000 cc class record at , on the Jabbeke motorway in Belgium.

There are some misleading claims of an intervening &quot;XJ&quot; 4-cyl prototype but it seems the only person who referred to them as such was William Heynes in a paper presented to the IMechE in 1953. Heynes stated there were many 4-cyl variants following the XF but it was he alone who loosely grouped them as XJ. The last mention of XF was in July 1945 and the first mention of XK (XK1) was in October of the same year. This doesn&#x27;t give much room for a series of XJ engines.There are no mentions of XJ in the archive (other than in Heynes’ paper). If there is a XJ, the first one is likely to have been referred to as XK1 internally. There were three others of nominally 1790 cc capacity called XK2, XK3 &amp; XK4. It is likely these are what Heynes referred to as &quot;XJ&quot;. The first &quot;true&quot; XK was called &quot;XK Number 1&quot; (distinct from &quot;XK1&quot;) and was of 1970 cc nominal capacity with an 83mm/91mm bore/stroke.

Thus were developed the two block sizes that formed the basis of all subsequent XK 6-cylinder engines; the shorter block being used for the 2.4 and 2.8-litre engines and the full sized block for both versions of the 3.4, the 3.8 and the 4.2-litre engines.

==Production==
The castings for the XK block were manufactured for Jaguar by Leyland Motors. In 1968, Jaguar laid off 2,500 workers at both Radford and Brown Lane due to strike by Leyland workers over pay parity after the merger of Leyland with British Motor Holdings, which Jaguar estimated had cost them a loss of 160 cars a day at a cost of £320,000.

==Description==

===Valve train===
The most recognisable feature of the XK engine is the dual cam covers atop the engine, which were a polished alloy until a change to ribbed black and alloy finish in early 1968, four years or so after the introduction of the 4.2-litre versions in 1964. The unusual depth of the engine&#x27;s cylinder head was dictated by the desire to make room for two generously-sized valves, whilst not excessively restricting the flow of gases into and out of the hemispherical combustion chambers. To satisfy these two conditions, a relatively wide angle between the valves was initially chosen, with quite long valve stems. To efficiently operate valves whose tops were such a long way apart, the dual overhead cam arrangement was found to be the most effective.

The cam lobes act directly on bucket type tappets, which are adjusted by means of shims between the underside of the bucket and the top of the valves. Two duplex chains drive the camshafts, one from the crankshaft to a sprocket at the level of the combustion chambers, and one from the sprocket to each camshaft. The original sprung slipper design of the lower cam chain tensioner proved to be too weak and after a couple of years was changed to an improved hydraulic design, using engine oil pressure.

===Cylinder head===
The cylinder heads were made of RR50 aluminium alloy due to that material&#x27;s high rate of heat conduction and light weight, the latter estimated by William Heynes to give a weight saving of some compared with a similar head made of cast iron. Special attention was paid to the gas flow, with Harry Weslake and Heynes designing a curved inlet port to impart swirl to the air-fuel mixture for improved combustion. The same basic cylinder head layout was preserved throughout the production life of the engine but with many detail changes. Valve and port sizes and angles, camshaft lift, compression ratio and carburetion were frequently amended from model to model, depending upon whether power or torque was being emphasised. Very early XK engines fitted to the XK 120 sports car and Mark VII saloon lacked fixing studs at the front part of the cam covers, where they covered the timing chains, which leaked oil as a result. From 1951 onwards, all XK engines had studs around the full perimeter of the cam covers.

The earliest cylinder heads are known as &quot;Standard&quot; or &quot;A type&quot; heads and are identifiable by their differing valve angles of 30 degrees inlet and 45 degrees exhaust, as well as by their unpainted aluminium finish. Around 1954, the &quot;B type&quot; head appeared, with equal valve angles of 35 degrees on inlet and exhaust. The &quot;B type&quot; heads are painted light &quot;duck egg&quot; blue (early cars) to light green (later cars) in the 2.4 and 3.4-litre models and metallic dark blue in 3.8-litre models. A very few XK 120s and XK 140s were supplied to customers with the &quot;C type&quot; cylinder head, which was painted red and carried a plaque on each cam cover stating &quot;Jaguar Type C&quot;.

A supposedly more efficient &quot;straight port&quot; cylinder head, again with equal 35 degree angles on the inlet and exhaust was introduced later in the 1950s and this was painted pumpkin orange on the XK-150S. The cylinder heads in the Series 1 E-type and Mark X were painted gold whether the engine was a 3.8-litre or 4.2-litre. Around the time of the later series 1 E-Types and 420G in 1968, about the same time as the arrival of the ribbed cam covers, the practice of painting the cylinder heads ceased. Many sources still describe the subsequent unpainted aluminium finish as &quot;silver&quot;.

Jaguar&#x27;s colour-coding of its cylinder heads of the late 1950s and early 1960s can be determined from Heiner Stertkamp&#x27;s list below. The only real anomaly is that the earliest 3.8-litre E-Types had an orange painted head (because they had 3 carburettors) but later changed to gold (because they had straight-port heads). Gold paint signified a straight port triple-carburettor setup from then until the demise of the Mark X.
* Silver/bare aluminium =&gt; 3.4 A-type head (Standard XK120, XK140 and MkVII with two H6 carburettors)
* Red =&gt; 3.4-litre with C-type head and 2 carburettors (XK 120 C and XK 140SE/M only)
* Light duck egg blue and later light green =&gt; 3.4-litre with B-type head and 2 carburettors (may appear as light blue, light green or light blue-green)
* Dark blue metallic =&gt; 3.8-litre with B-type head and 2 carburettors
* Orange =&gt; 3.4 and 3.8-litre with straight-port head and 3 carburettors 
* Gold =&gt; later 3.8-litre and all 4.2-litre (until 420G and Series 2 E-Type) with straight-port head and 3 carburettors

Cars with the straight-port head and only two carburettors did not have painted heads. See the complete table of XK cylinder head types as they relate to Jaguar and Daimler models at the end of this article.

===Engine block===
The block was made of cast iron (with the exception of some made of aluminium alloy for racing engines), with the crankcase split on the centreline of the seven-bearing crankshaft. The crankshaft was made of EN16 steel, heat treated prior to machining. An innovation was the fitting of a proprietary Metalastik vibration damper on the nose of the crankshaft to eliminate damaging crankshaft resonances. The design and materials of the bottom end of the engine hardly changed throughout its life, apart from the changes dictated by the respaced cylinders of the 4.2-litre version (also used by the &#x27;new 3.4&#x27; litre version). The oil pump was changed after a couple of years from a relatively inefficient gear-type pump to a Hobourn-Eaton eccentric-lobe unit.

===Fuel system===
The pre-injection cars had either two or three SU, Weber, Zenith or Zenith-Stromberg carburettors of various sizes depending upon the model and market, although Weber carburettors were only available from the dealer or on the aftermarket, and not supplied by the factory. The exception to this was 2.4 litre cars up to the introduction of the 240, these earlier cars having twin Solex downdraught carburettors. Some D-Type sports racing cars received fuel injection, but it did not become available on the road cars until 1978, beginning on certain US market models in order to comply with government fuel-efficiency standards. It was eventually extended across the range and to all markets.

===Power rating===
During the 1950s and 1960s Jaguar released SAE gross horsepower figures, using the measurement system preferred by US manufacturers, as otherwise its cars would have appeared under-powered in comparison with US cars. This practice was superseded by reliance on the more realistic SAE net horsepower system around 1972, although Jaguar power ratings of that era may also be expressed using the very similar DIN net rating system. Since the conditions upon which the SAE gross figures were determined were not recorded, an objective comparison of the power outputs of the various models of XK powered Jaguar over time is impossible.

The 1965 4.2 XK fitted to the carburetted E-Type had a listed output of SAE gross; the 1986 fuel injected 4.2 XK fitted to the series 3 XJ6 was listed at DIN net. Variables such as compression ratio, cam lifts and durations, and fuel consumption rate for each engine during testing would, at a minimum, be additionally required to develop any estimated comparisons.

==Individual displacements==

===3.4-litre===

The first production use of the XK straight-6 was in the 1948 Jaguar XK120, which used the version with a bore x stroke of . It had an iron block without cylinder liners and aluminium cylinder head. It had a wider gap between cylinders 3 and 4 than between the other cylinders. The 3.4 was first rated at SAE gross at a compression ratio of 8:1, rising to SAE gross with the C-type cylinder head (confusingly not the head from the C-Type as raced at Le Mans) all the way to SAE gross with the &quot;straight port&quot; head at a compression ratio of 9:1 as fitted to the XK150SE.

Almost as soon as the new compact Jaguar 2.4-litre was released, there was pressure on Jaguar to fit the 3.4-litre engine to it. This was duly done in February 1957, the car being known as the Jaguar 3.4-litre. The designation &quot;Mark 1&quot; for these cars was applied retrospectively, after the release of the Mark 2 in 1959.

The original 3.4-litre XK was used in the following road cars:
* Jaguar XK120 - 1948-53, &quot;Standard (or &quot;A type&quot;)&quot; cylinder head, bare aluminium finish, 2 × SU H6 carburettors. The XK 120 C came with the C-type head (red) as an option from 1951 to 1952 with 2 × SU H8 carburettors. In 1953, the XK 120 C switched to a triple 40 DCOE Weber carburetor setup. The XK 120 SE and M came with the C-type head as an option with 2 × SU H6 carburettors (occasionally SU H8)
* Jaguar XK140 - 1954-57, &quot;Standard (or &quot;A type&quot;)&quot; cylinder head, 2 × SU H6 carburettors. The XK 140 SE or M came with the C-type head as an option, painted red with 2 × SU H6 or H8 carburettors
* Jaguar XK 150 3.4 - 1957-61, &quot;B type&quot; cylinder head, painted light blue-green, 2 × SU HD6 carburettors
* Jaguar XK 150 3.4S - 1957-61, &quot;Straight port&quot; cylinder head, painted orange, 3 × SU HD8 carburettors
* Jaguar Mark VII - 1950-54, &quot;A type&quot; then &quot;C type&quot; (as option from April 1953) cylinder head, unpainted aluminium, 2 × SU H6 carburettors
* Jaguar MkVIIM - 1954-57, &quot;C type&quot; cylinder head, 2 × SU H6 carburettors, some had high-lift cams
* Jaguar Mark VIII - 1956–1958, &quot;B type&quot; cylinder head, painted light blue-green, 2 × SU HD6 carburettors
* Jaguar 3.4-litre &#x27;Mark 1&#x27; - 1957-59, &quot;B type&quot; cylinder head, painted light blue-green, 2 × SU HD6 carburettors
* Jaguar 3.4-litre Mark 2 - 1959-67, &quot;B type&quot; cylinder head, painted light blue-green, 2 × SU HD6 carburettors
* Jaguar 340 Mark 2 - 1967-68, &quot;B type&quot; cylinder head, ribbed cam covers, 2 × SU HD6 carburettors
* Jaguar S-Type 3.4 - 1963-68, &quot;B type&quot; cylinder head painted light blue-green, smooth cam covers, 2 × SU HD6 carburettors

===2.4-litre===
In the mid-1950s, Jaguar lacked a compact saloon of the type represented until 1949 by the Standard-engined 1½ litre. In choosing a power unit for its all new compact saloon, Jaguar could choose between the 1,995 cc four-cylinder XK prototype and a downsized version of the 3.4-litre six-cylinder XK. The 4-cylinder was considered too low powered and unrefined. The 3.4 was already well &quot;undersquare&quot;, which means that its bore was much less than its stroke, so a smaller bore version of the 3.4 was not seen as a realistic proposition. Jaguar was therefore obliged to create a short-stroke version of the 6-cylinder XK with a shorter cylinder block, reducing it in height from to .

Introduced in the Jaguar 2.4-litre in 1955, the engine had a stroke of while retaining the bore of to give a capacity of . Despite having a displacement of almost 2.5 litres, the new car was called the &quot;Jaguar 2.4&quot; to create an obvious separation from the old Standard 2½ litre and link it to the now familiar 3.4-litre XK engine. The 2.4s produced were rated at 112 bhp (nett) by the factory, using twin Solex downdraft carburettors.

In 1959 the engine was carried over into the new Mark 2, in which it produced SAE gross, still with Solex carburettors. The Jaguar 240 was fitted with an uprated version of the engine, incorporating the straight-port cylinder head and twin SU carburettors delivering 133 bhp SAE gross.

The 2.4-litre XK was used in the following cars:
* Jaguar 2.4-litre &#x27;Mark 1&#x27; - 1955-59, &quot;B type&quot; cylinder head, unpainted, 2 × Solex B32PB15S carburettors, valve angles 30 degrees inlet, 45 degrees exhaust
* Jaguar 2.4-litre Mark 2 - 1959-67, &quot;B type&quot; cylinder head, unpainted, 2 × Solex B32PB15S carburettors, valve angles 45 degrees inlet and exhaust
* Jaguar 240 Mark 2 - 1967-69, &quot;Straight port&quot; cylinder head, unpainted, 2 × SU HD6 carburettors, valve angles 45 degrees inlet and exhaust

===3.8-litre===

The 3.8-litre version was released in 1958, initially for the last of the XK150s and the Mark IX saloon. It retained the 3.4’s bore centres and stroke but was bored out to for a total displacement of (3,781 cc / 230.7 cu-in). The distance between the cylinder bores was sufficiently small that it was decided to fit dry liners to the bores. The 3.8 had a number of detail differences from the 3.4, particularly in its valve gear and carburetion. The standard 3.8 produced SAE gross and up to SAE gross in the XK150SE with the straight port head.

The 3.8-litre XK was used in the following road cars:
* Jaguar XK 150 3.8 - 1958-61, &quot;B type&quot; cylinder head, painted dark blue metallic, 2 × SU HD6 carburettors
* Jaguar XK150 3.8S - 1958-61, &quot;Straight port&quot; cylinder head, painted pumpkin orange, 3 × SU HD8 carburettors
* Jaguar Mark IX - 1958-61, &quot;B type&quot; cylinder head, painted dark blue metallic, 2 × SU HD6 carburettors
* Jaguar Mark X 3.8 - 1961-64, &quot;Straight port&quot; cylinder head, painted gold, 3 × SU HD8 carburettors
* Jaguar Mark 2 - 1959-67, &quot;B type&quot; cylinder head, painted dark blue metallic, 2 × SU HD6 carburettors
* Jaguar E-Type Series 1 3.8 - 1961-64, &quot;Straight port&quot; cylinder head, painted orange then gold, 3 × SU HD8 carburettors
* Jaguar S-Type 3.8 - 1963-68, &quot;B type&quot; cylinder head, dark blue metallic or later with smooth cam covers and unpainted, 2 × SU HD6 carburettors
* Panther J.72

===3.0-litre===

3-litre versions of the XK engine were built from 1959 onwards for FIA sports car racing with a 85 mm (3.35 in) bore and 88 mm (3.46 in) stroke. It was also popular with small race car manufacturers such as Lister Cars who could not afford to produce their own engines. As well as endurance racing, the engine was also used in Formula Libre racing.

A 3.0-litre XK was used in the following road cars:
*Jaguar E2A prototype sports racer (1960)
*Jaguar E-type lightweight sports racer (1961)
*Jaguar D-type (non-works) sports racer (1959)
*Lister Cars endurance and formula racers
*Hersham and Walton Motors (HWM) endurance and formula racers
*Cooper Car Company endurance and formula racers
*John Tojeiro endurance and formula racers

===4.2-litre===
A bored-out 4.2-litre version of the XK was officially released in 1964, although racers had been boring the 3.8 out to 4.2 litres for years. The factory 4.2-litre block was a new siamesed sleeve design which used respaced cylinders set evenly along the length of the block with new main bearing spacings and a new crankshaft. The middle two cylinders were moved closer together and the outer two moved further apart but the overall length of the block remained unchanged. This enabled the cylinder bores to be taken out to whilst retaining the familiar long stroke of for a total displacement of .

Despite the re-spacing of the cylinder bores, the cylinder head castings remained unchanged. As a result, the centrelines of the combustion chambers in the head no longer aligned precisely with the centrelines of the cylinders but this did not matter greatly as the combustion chamber diameters in the head were smaller than the cylinder diameters. The 3.8 and 4.2-litre cylinder heads and cams are therefore interchangeable. The 4.2-litre engine from the factory had unsmoothed steps between the inlet manifold and head, and the manifold gaskets were not a good match for the inlet ports. These engines therefore make excellent bases for some modification, achieving approx. SAE net and increased torque merely by &quot;flowing&quot; the head.

Published horsepower ratings of the various versions of the 4.2-litre are complicated by the switch from gross to net horsepower systems during its lifetime. For example, in 1965 the 4.2-litre with triple SU HD8 carburetors fitted to the US-specification E-Type was rated at @ 5400 rpm SAE gross and a maximum torque of @ 4000 rpm whereas by 1969, now with twin Zenith-Stromberg carburetors, this had fallen to SAE gross. The difference indicates the effect of the revised carburetion and other changes made to reduce exhaust emissions from US specification engines. Jeff Daniels&#x27; reference states that the similar twin Zenith-Stromberg version fitted to a US specification XJ6 was rated by Jaguar at using the DIN net horsepower system, the difference being largely due to the effect of the gross versus net horsepower rating systems.

The 1987 Jaguar XJ6 was the last Jaguar car fitted with the XK engine. In 1992 the last Daimler DS420 Limousine was produced. Like all other DS420 limousines, it was equipped with a 4.2-litre XK engine. The 4.2 variant was also used in some military vehicles with relatively few modifications. The XK engine has the rare accolade of having been in production and service in cars spanning six consecutive decades.

All of the 4.2-litre XK engines used the straight port head. After the arrival of the ribbed cam covers in 1967 the heads normally remained unpainted, which some sources describe as &quot;silver&quot;.

The 4.2-litre XK was used in the following cars:
* Jaguar Mark X 4.2 - 1964-66, &quot;straight port&quot; cylinder head, painted gold, 3 × SU HD8 carburettors
* Jaguar 420 - 1966-68, 2 × SU HD8 carburettors
* Daimler Sovereign - 1966-69, 2 × SU HD8 carburettors
* Jaguar 420G - 1966-70, painted gold, 3 × SU HD8 carburettors
* Jaguar E-Type Series 1 4.2 - 1964-68, painted gold, 3 × SU HD8 carburettors (from 1967 US specification E-Types used 2 × Zenith-Stromberg 175 CDSE carburettors for reduced emissions)
* Jaguar E-Type Series 2 - 1968-70, 3 × SU HD8 carburettors (US specification E-Types used 2 × Zenith-Stromberg 175 CDSE carburettors for reduced emissions)
* Jaguar XJ6 4.2 Series 1 - 1968-73, 2 × SU HD8 carburettors (North American specification XJ6 used 2 × Zenith-Stromberg 175 CDSE carburettors for reduced emissions)
* Daimler Sovereign 4.2 &#x27;XJ6&#x27; Series 1 - 1969-73, 2 × SU HD8 carburettors
* Jaguar XJ6 4.2 Series 2 - 1973-74, 2 × SU HS8 carburettors (North American specification XJ6 used 2 × Zenith-Stromberg 175 CDSE carburettors for reduced emissions)
* Daimler Sovereign 4.2 &#x27;XJ6&#x27; Series 2 - 1973-74, 2 × SU HS8 carburettors
* Jaguar XJ6 L 4.2 Series 2 - 1973-79, 2 × SU HS8 carburettors. From 1977, 2 × SU HIF7 carburettors, US market from May 1978 Bosch-Lucas L-Jetronic electronic injection
* Daimler Sovereign LWB 4.2 &#x27;XJ6&#x27; Series 2 - 1973-79 (and Daimler Vanden Plas 1975-79), 2 × SU HS8 carburettors. From 1977, 2 × SU HIF7 carburettors, US market (VDP only) from May 1978 Bosch-Lucas L-Jetronic
* Jaguar XJ6 4.2 Series 3 - 1979-87, 2 × SU carburettors or Bosch-Lucas L-Jetronic electronic injection

* Daimler DS420 Limousine - 1968-92, 2 × SU HD8 carburettors. From 1985 Bosch-Lucas L-Jetronic electronic injection
* Panther J.72
* Panther De Ville

It was also used in the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) - CVR(T) - family of military vehicles: e.g.,
* FV101 Scorpion, a light tank
* FV107 Scimitar, an armoured reconnaissance vehicle

and the corresponding Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Wheeled) - CVR(W) - family: e.g., Fox armoured reconnaissance vehicle
plus the Dennis D600 fire engine.

===2.8-litre===

A 2.8-litre version of the XK was introduced for the entry-level XJ6 models in 1968. It had a similar short block to the old the 2.4 with addition of the later two rear water cooling holes for the straight port cylinder head, retaining the bore of but lengthening the stroke by to to give a displacement of 2,792 cc / 170.4 cu-in. The power output of the 2.8 was listed as DIN net, which cannot be directly compared with the 133 bhp SAE gross of the last of the 2.4s in the 240 Mark 2.

The 2.8 gained a bad reputation early in its career due to a tendency for excessive carbon deposits to accumulate on the piston crowns during low-speed running, which would burn through the crowns when run at higher revs. This was later cured by a switch to stronger pistons but the engine was also a mediocre performer offering no real economy benefit and it was dropped in 1973, to be replaced by the ‘new’ 3.4.

All of the 2.8-litre XK engines used the straight port head unpainted, which some sources may describe as &quot;silver&quot;, and had ribbed cam covers.

The 2.8-litre XK was used in the following cars:
* XJ6 2.8 Series 1 - 1968-73, 2 × SU HD8 carburettors
* Daimler Sovereign 2.8 &#x27;XJ6&#x27; Series 1 – 1969-72, 2 × SU HD8 carburettors
* XJ6 2.8 Series 2 - 1973-74, 2 × SU HS8 carburettors

===&quot;New&quot; 3.4-litre===
Introduced in 1975 to replace the 2.8 in the entry level XJ6, the new 3.4 was not a simple revival of the original XK. Whilst it shared the old 3.4’s bore and stroke of and respectively, it carried over some features of the newer 4.2 litre engine - the main bearing spacings and bearing sizes, and stiffer bottom end but dispensing with the cylinder liners used by the 3.8 and 4.2. However the cylinder spacing remained as the original 1948 design. With 83mm bore, the cylinders needed to line up with the combustion chambers in the cylinder head (whose centres remained as the original 1948 design right up to the end of XK-engine production.
It used a straight port head and delivered DIN net and far superior torque to the 2.8.

The &quot;new 3.4&quot; used the straight port head, had ribbed cam covers and the heads were unpainted.

The &quot;New 3.4&quot; litre XK was used in the following cars:
* XJ6 3.4 Series 2 - 1975-79, ribbed cam covers, 2 × SU HS8 carburettors. From 1977, 2 × SU HIIF7 carburettors
*Daimler Sovereign &#x27;XJ6&#x27; 3.4 Series 2 – 1975-79, ribbed cam covers, 2 × SU HS8 carburettors. From 1977, 2 × SU HIIF7 carburettors
* XJ6 Series 3 - 1979-86, ribbed cam covers, 2 × SU carburettors

==Cylinder head types==
The following table relates XK cylinder head type to Jaguar/Daimler model and includes the paint colours applied to certain versions of the cylinder head in the 1950s and 60s. Unpainted heads are sometimes referred to as &quot;silver&quot; but this is merely the natural colour of the aluminium alloy.

<doc id="881987" wikidata="Q4820926" url="?curid=881987" title="Augusta GreenJackets">
<text>The Augusta GreenJackets are a Minor League Baseball team of the Carolina League and the Single-A affiliate of the Atlanta Braves. They play their home games at SRP Park in North Augusta, South Carolina. 

==History==

Augusta was a member of the South Atlantic League from 1980 to 2020. Before the San Francisco Giants took over the club&#x27;s affiliation after the 2004 season, the GreenJackets were a part of the Boston Red Sox organization. Prior to that, the Red Sox replaced the Pittsburgh Pirates in Augusta. The GreenJackets boast third baseman Kevin Youkilis and Dustin Pedroia as the only prospects to make the Red Sox roster, although knuckle baller Tim Wakefield pitched there in 1989 with the Pirates organization. The Red Sox&#x27; relationship with Augusta met with immediate success when the GreenJackets won the South Atlantic League championship in their first year as an affiliate team.

The 2020 season was postponed and later cancelled for Augusta and all of MiLB due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the MiLB Reorganization of 2021, the Braves invited Augusta to be their new Low-A affiliate in the Low-A East. In 2022, the Low-A East became known as the Carolina League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization, and was reclassified as a Single-A circuit.

The team is named after The Masters golf tournament held across the Savannah River in Augusta, Georgia, where the winner receives a green jacket. The team logo features a yellowjacket wasp colored green, wearing a tam o&#x27; shanter cap, associated with golf.

One week a year the GreenJackets assume the name of their alter ego and become the Pimento Cheese. This name also pays homage to the Masters tournament with the iconic pimento cheese sandwich, a popular concession item sold at the tournament, featured prominently as the team&#x27;s logo on caps, jerseys, and all team branding.

==Stadium==

The GreenJackets play in SRP Park, a 4,782-seat stadium which opened on April 12, 2018. SRP Park is part of Riverside Village at Hammond&#x27;s Ferry, which overlooks the Savannah River and the city of Augusta, featuring apartments, a hotel, office space, and multiple restaurants and shops. The North Augusta-based SRP Federal Credit Union purchased the naming rights to the ballpark.

SRP Park replaced Lake Olmstead Stadium as the home of the GreenJackets. Lake Olmstead Stadium was built primarily as a baseball facility between 1994 and 1995. The stadium seated 4,400 with nearly 1,000 box seats, 830 reserved seats, over 2,000 general admission seats.

==Awards==
In 2008, the team was voted by fans as the best minor league team in the Minor League Baseball Yearly (MiLBY) Awards.

<doc id="881990" wikidata="Q16148479" url="?curid=881990" title="List of colonial governors of the Dutch Gold Coast">
<text>This article lists the colonial governors of the Dutch Gold Coast. During the Dutch presence on the Gold Coast, which lasted from 1598 to 1872, the title of the head of the colonial government changed several times:

*1675–1798: Director-General (Dutch: &quot;directeur-generaal&quot;)
*1798–1810: Governor-General (Dutch: &quot;gouverneur-generaal&quot;)
*1810–1815: Commandant-General (Dutch: &quot;commandant-generaal&quot;)
*1815–1819: Governor-General (Dutch: &quot;gouverneur-generaal&quot;)
*1819–1838: Commander (Dutch: &quot;kommandeur&quot;)
*1838–1872: Governor (Dutch: &quot;gouverneur&quot;)

==List==
Dates in italics indicate &quot;de facto &quot;continuation of office.

===Direct Dutch rule (1612–1621)===
Before the establishment of the Dutch West India Company on 3 June 1621, Dutch traders nominally were at the direct control of the Dutch government. Initially, the regulation of trade was left to the traders themselves, but after the building of Fort Nassau at Mouri in 1612, a general was installed to administrate the new colony.

===Dutch West India Company rule (1621–1791)===



There are many lists available of Director-Generals of the Gold Coast in service of the Dutch West India Company, all with slightly conflicting names and dates. The most accurate information is available for the eighteenth century, as Harvey Feinberg compiled a list of Director-Generals of that century on the basis of day registries available at the Nationaal Archief.

===Direct Dutch rule (1792–1872)===
The Dutch West India Company was dissolved in 1791, and its colonies reverted to the rule of the States-General of the Dutch Republic on 1 January 1792. The last Director-General installed by the Dutch West India Company, Jacobus de Veer, became the first Director-General under the direct authority of the Dutch Republic. The Dutch Republic was succeeded by the Batavian Republic and the Kingdom of Holland, which all inherited the rule over the colony.

Although the Kingdom of Holland was incorporated into the First French Empire, the colony on the Gold Coast was never occupied by either France or Great-Britain. Dutch rule continued under the Kingdom of the Netherlands proclaimed in 1815, until the cession of the possessions on the Gold Coast to the United Kingdom in 1872.

<doc id="881991" wikidata="Q966379" url="?curid=881991" title="Ann Curry">
<text>Ann Curry (born November 19, 1956) is an American journalist, who has been a reporter for more than 45 years, focused on human suffering in war zones and natural disasters. Curry has reported from the wars in Kosovo, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Afghanistan, Darfur, Congo, and the Central African Republic. Curry has covered numerous disasters, including the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, and the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, where her appeal via Twitter topped Twitter&#x27;s &#x27;most powerful&#x27; list, credited for helping speed the arrival of humanitarian planes.

In June 2012, she became the national and international correspondent-anchor for NBC News and the anchor at large for the &quot;Today&quot; show. She was co-anchor of &quot;Today&quot; from June 9, 2011, to June 28, 2012, and the program&#x27;s news anchor from March 1997 until becoming co-anchor. She was also the anchor of &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; from 2005 to 2011.

On January 13, 2015, it was announced that Curry would be leaving NBC News after nearly 25 years. In January 2015, Curry founded her own multi-platform media startup. She continued to conduct major news interviews on network television, including securing an exclusive interview with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif in 2015 about the Iran nuclear talks. She hosted and produced &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet Again with Ann Curry&quot; from 2018 to 2019 on PBS.

==Early life and education==
Ann Curry was born in Agaña, Guam, the daughter of Hiroe Nagase and Robert Paul &quot;Bob&quot; Curry. Her mother is Japanese, and her father, an American from Pueblo, Colorado, had Irish and German ancestry. Her parents met when her father, a career United States Navy sailor, worked as a streetcar conductor during the United States occupation of Japan after World War II. Although he was transferred out of Japan, he returned two years later to marry Nagase. Curry is the eldest of five children.

Curry lived in Japan for several years as a child, and attended the Ernest J. King School on the United States Fleet Activities Sasebo naval base in Sasebo, Nagasaki. During her childhood, she also lived in San Diego, Alameda, California, and Virginia Beach, Virginia. Later, she moved to Ashland, Oregon, where she graduated from Ashland High School. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism from the University of Oregon in 1978.

==Career==

===1978–1989===
Curry began her broadcasting career in 1978 as an intern at then NBC-affiliate (now CBS-affiliate) KTVL in Medford, Oregon. There she rose to become the station&#x27;s first female news reporter. In 1980, Curry moved to NBC-affiliate KGW in Portland, where she was a reporter and anchor. Four years later, Curry moved to Los Angeles as a reporter for KCBS-TV and received two Emmy Awards while working as a reporter from 1984 to 1990.

===1990–2012===
In 1990, Curry joined NBC News, first as the NBC News Chicago correspondent then as the anchor of&quot; NBC News at Sunrise &quot;from 1991 to 1996. From 1993 to 1995 &amp; again from 1996-1999 Curry was one of the rotating anchors of the Sunday edition of NBC Nightly News. Curry also served as a substitute news anchor for Matt Lauer from 1994 to 1997 at &quot;Today&quot;. From 1997 to 2011, she served as news anchor at &quot;Today&quot;, becoming the show&#x27;s second-longest serving news anchor, behind Frank Blair, who served in that capacity from 1953 to 1975. During this time, she also served as a substitute anchor for &quot;Today&quot;. On June 24, 2005, Curry was named co-anchor of &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; with Stone Phillips; she remained as the primary anchor when Phillips left on July 2, 2007, until she replaced Meredith Vieira on &quot;Today&quot; in 2011. She was the primary substitute on &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; from 2005 to 2011.
Curry has reported on major international stories, filing stories from places such as Baghdad, Sri Lanka, Congo, Rwanda, Albania, and Darfur. Curry hosted NBC&#x27;s primetime coverage and highlights of the Live Earth concerts on July 7, 2007, and also contributed with interviews for the special with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Vice President Al Gore. Curry reported from the during the invasion of Afghanistan in November 2001, and had an exclusive interview with General Tommy Franks. She reported from Baghdad in early 2003, and then from the as the war in Iraq began. Curry was also the first network news anchor to report from inside the Southeast Asian tsunami zone in late 2004.

On December 17, 2007, Curry bungee-jumped off the Transporter Bridge in Middlesbrough, England, to raise money for charity. Her jump was shown live on the &quot;Today&quot; show.

In 2009, Curry traveled to Iran, where she interviewed then-President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad days before Ahmadinejad traveled to America to speak in front of the United Nations General Assembly.

In 2011, Curry appeared in the first PBS Kids Sprout &quot;Kindness Counts&quot; public service announcement. She was the television host of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade in 2011.

===Departure from &quot;Today&quot;===
In June 2012, Curry was widely reported as being replaced as co-host of &quot;Today&quot;. Curry hired attorney Robert Barnett to represent her in her discussions with NBC. On June 28, Curry announced in an emotional broadcast on the show that she was leaving &quot;Today&quot;. She signed a new multiyear contract with the network as NBC News national and international correspondent/anchor and &quot;Today&quot; anchor-at-large. Her departure had led to some discussions about racism, particularly as she was one of the most prominent Asian-American journalists on the national stage.

For a time, she led a seven-person unit producing content and reporting for &quot;NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt&quot; (for which she also was a regular substitute anchor), &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, &quot;Rock Center with Brian Williams&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, and MSNBC. Curry also anchored multiple NBC News primetime specials. On August 9, 2012, Curry made her first post-departure appearance on &quot;Today&quot;, when she reported a story during the show&#x27;s coverage at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The reunion with her former co-anchor, Matt Lauer, was described in the media as &quot;tense&quot;, &quot;awkward&quot;, and &quot;chilly&quot;. In September 2013, Lauer said he was disappointed in the way the media reported Curry&#x27;s departure.

In January 2015, Curry was announced as officially leaving NBC News.

=== 2015–present ===
In June 2016, she moderated a panel discussion between the Dalai Lama and Lady Gaga at the 84th annual U.S. Conference of Mayors in Indianapolis. In July 2017, PBS announced a new documentary television series &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet Again with Ann Curry&quot; hosted and co-produced by Curry. In November 2017, she attended WE Day at Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In 2018, she also spoke at two other WE Day events, in Seattle and in Toronto.

In January 2018, Curry returned to television with her PBS series, &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet Again&quot;. Developed by her own production company, the series focused on 12 stories of people searching for individuals who changed their lives. She then appeared on &quot;The View&quot; as guest co-host on January 23, 2018, where she addressed the controversies surrounding her departure from &quot;Today&quot;. In 2019, Curry hosted TNT/TBS&#x27;s &quot;Chasing the Cure&quot;, also serving as executive producer.

In 2018, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that Curry had warned NBC of sexual misconduct by Matt Lauer in 2012, after a staffer told her she&#x27;d been sexually harassed, but was worried about being fired if she reported it. Lauer was fired from NBC after new allegations of abusing staff in 2017. When asked whether she felt informing NBC executives resulted in her 2012 firing from &quot;Today&quot;, Curry stated &quot;I think that many people have guessed why (I was replaced), but I’ve held myself back. I’ve asked people why, and I haven’t gotten a good answer.&quot; Concerning her reaction to the firing, she stated &quot;it honestly hurts really deeply, because I really think I did nothing wrong. But in spite of the pain of it, which still lingers, I know that I contributed to some people suffering less.&quot;

She was awarded the Murrow Lifetime Achievement Award in 2022. In 2024, she received the Damon Runyon Award from the Denver Press Club.

<doc id="882002" wikidata="Q6122906" url="?curid=882002" title="Jaguar V12 engine">
<text>An evolution of the 1964 DOHC prototype “XJ13” engine, the Jaguar V12 engine is a family of SOHC internal combustion V12 engines with a common block design, that were mass-produced by Jaguar Cars for a quarter of a century, from 1971 to 1997, mostly as 5.3litres, but later also as 6litres, and 7litre versions that were deployed in racing. Except for a few low-volume exotic sports car makers, Jaguar&#x27;s V12 engine was the world&#x27;s first V12 engine in mass-production. For 17 years, Jaguar was the only company in the world consistently producing luxury four-door saloons with a V12 engine. The V12 powered all three series of the original Jaguar XJ luxury saloons, as well as its second generation XJ40 and X305 successors.

Originally fitted with carburettors, the SOHC V12s received electronic fuel injection in 1975. In 1981, the engines were improved with higher efficiency (HE) cylinder heads. Including the V12 E-Type mark3 models, and in the XJS (from 1975 to 1996), Jaguar made a total of 161,583 SOHC V12-engined cars. The Jaguar V12 was regarded as one of the premier power plants of the 1970s and 1980s. After launching the second generation XJseries in 1986, Jaguar developed their V12 into the racing engines that brought two overall victories at the 24hours of LeMans endurance races of 1988 and 1990.

Remarkably, three decades earlier, the engine was initiated in 1951 by Claude Baily as a prototype design for an intended LeMans racecar: the Jaguar XJ13 - as well as for planned use in Jaguar’s range of luxury and sports cars. After building six DOHC engines, 3 of which were extensively tested in cars, the XJ13 project was terminated in 1967, before the car ever entered into competition. Under the direction of Jaguar Chief Engineer William Heynes, the DOHC V12 engine design was reworked by engineers Walter Hassan and Harry Mundy into a road-going SOHC production-vehicle version, first installed in the Jaguar E-Type mark 3 of 1971. The SOHC V12 was just the second production engine design in Jaguar&#x27;s history, after the 1949 straight-six XK engine, built through 1992. It uses an all-aluminium block and cylinder heads with removable wet steel liners, and single overhead camshafts with two valves per cylinder.

==Development==
Initial designs for a V12 engine were produced by engineer Claude Bailey as early as 1951, with a view to using it in a LeMans race-car. Bailey&#x27;s original 8.0 L design used double overhead camshafts heads sharing the same basic layout as the inline 6-cylinder XK engine, in order to allow for a relatively high redline. Even after Jaguar withdrew from racing in 1957, the V12 design continued to be refined, and Bailey proposed a range of displacements from 7.6 L (sharing 87 mm bore and 106 mm stroke measurements with the 3.8 L XK) down to 5.0 L (sharing the 2.4 L XK&#x27;s 83 mm bore and 76.5 mm stroke). In 1962 Bailey was instructed to begin prototype tooling and bench testing of a 5.0 L design, having settled on an 87 mm bore and 70 mm stroke.

By 1964 several incarnations of the V12 engine were being tested, including versions meant for racing and others for installation into production cars. An all-aluminium quad-cam design with fuel injection was created for the XJ13, while cast iron blocks and heads, and other double and single overhead cam head designs were created for use in a production road car version. These production versions of the engine were tested in Mark X saloons.

After the XJ13 project was cancelled the team of Hassan and Mundy designed a new single overhead cam head, with the camshaft lobes acting directly on vertically-inclined valves through bucket tappets. This was similar to the cylinder head design of the contemporary Rover 2000, with which the Jaguar V12 also shared the use of dished &#x27;Heron&#x27; pistons. These changes reduced complexity, weight, size and noise, and were anticipated to help the engine meet future emissions standards.

The revised head design by Hassan and Mundy also had longer, more restrictive inlet ports sacrificing top-end power but which—along with an increase in displacement to (90 mm bore x 70 mm stroke)—greatly improved performance at lower and mid-range engine speeds, which was more desirable in heavier luxury cars. The chain-driven SOHC heads and the softer valve springs fitted to reduce valve train noise resulted in the red line being lowered to 6,500 rpm from the 8,000 rpm of the original DOHC design. The engine was continuously refined with various carburettor and fuel injection arrangements before finally seeing production in the Series III E-Type in 1971.

== 5.3 Litre==
The production engine had an oversquare bore x stroke, producing to (depending on emission controls and compression ratio), and up to of torque in fuel-injected form. Right from the start of production in 1971 the V12 engine had Lucas OPUS (Oscillating Pick-Up System) electronic ignition. Initially the OPUS ignition amplifier unit was secured directly to the engine between the cylinder heads and had problems due to overheating. In later cars the ignition amplifier had been moved away from the engine where it could get air flow for cooling. Originally the V12 was supposed to use an advanced fuel injection system under development by AE Brico but this plan was cancelled at a late stage, possibly due to concerns that the design was too similar to Bosch products. The V12 as used in the Series 3 E-Types, Series 1 XJ12 and early Series 2 XJ12s (1973-April 1975) had four side draft Zenith-Stromberg carburettors. After April 1975, the V12 engine used in the Series 2 XJ12 and the new XJ-S had a licensed copy of the Bosch D-Jetronic system adapted by Lucas for use on the V12.

This version was used in the following cars:
* 1971-1974 Jaguar E-Type
* 1975–1981 Jaguar XJS
* 1972–1981 Jaguar XJ12 (Series 1 and 2)
* 1973–1981 Daimler Double-Six (Series 1 and 2)
* 1972-1981 Panther J.72
* 1974-1985 Panther De Ville

== 5.3 Litre HE==
A &quot;high-efficiency&quot; (HE) version of the engine debuted in 1981, using special high-swirl design cylinder heads designed by Swiss racing driver Michael May. May&#x27;s design consisted of a swirl chamber at the exhaust valve with a channel around the intake valve. The use of conventional flat-topped pistons in lieu of the original design&#x27;s dished type allowed squish from the compression stroke to push the air through the channel around the intake valve to the chamber below the exhaust valve, causing turbulent swirling flow around the spark plug (which had been relocated near the exhaust valve at the top of the chamber). This design created a stratified charge, allowing the engine to run at an unusually high compression ratio for the time (10.5:1 to 12.5:1, depending on market and year) while running a relatively lean fuel mixture. In any given market power levels remained similar to the previous model, but fuel economy was improved by nearly 50%. A new fuel injection system called &quot;Digital P&quot; featuring a digital ECU with integrated manifold air pressure transducer was installed, replacing the older analogue control unit and remote pressure sensor from Bosch&#x27;s original D-Jetronic design. (However, cars sold in Australia, Sweden and Switzerland continued to use the D-Jetronic system until at least 1985.)

The OPUS ignition was replaced by Lucas&#x27;s Constant Energy Ignition (CEI) in 1982, to deliver a more reliable spark. Series 3 XJ12 and Daimler Double Six cars used the CEI system until the end of their production in 1992, but it was superseded in the XJ-S in mid-1989 by another from Magneti Marelli. The Marelli ignition system was used until the end of XJ-S production, and on the version used in the XJ81 four-door saloons made in 1993 and 1994.

The 5.3 HE was used in the following applications:
* 1981–1992 Jaguar XJ12 (Series 3)
* 1981–1992 Jaguar XJ-S
* 1981–1992 Daimler Double-Six (Series 3)

== 6.0 Litre HE==

The engine was stroked to in 1992 for a displacement of to make this one of the most powerful Jaguar production engines to date at at 5,400 rpm and at 3,750 rpm. The XJR-S stayed in the line until 1993 with power raised at at 5250 rpm and at 3650 rpm of torque. The engine on X305 used a new Nippondenso distributorless crank-fired ignition system with coil packs very similar to Ford EDIS-6 units. The last Jaguar V12 engine was produced on 17 April 1997.

The 6.0 HE was used in the following cars:
* 1989–1993 Jaguar XJR-S 6.0 (from September 1989)
* 1992–1995 Jaguar XJS
* 1993–1994 Jaguar XJ-12 / Daimler Double-Six (XJ40/XJ81)
* 1994–1997 Jaguar XJ-12 / Daimler Double-Six (X300)

==TWR==
In 1982, Tom Walkinshaw Racing became Jaguar&#x27;s official team in the European Touring Car Championship, running the XJS with its 5.3L V12 which under the development of TWR would eventually produce a reliable . And with drivers such as Tom Walkinshaw himself, Briton Win Percy, West German star Hans Heyer, and budding Formula One driver Martin Brundle, the big Cats would soon become the cars to beat and in 1984 TWR had not only won the ETCC but had also won the 1984 Spa 24 Hours with Walkinshaw, Percy and Heyer driving. The XJS&#x27;s were retired at the end of 1984 with TWR moving into running the Rover Vitesse in Touring car racing while becoming Jaguar&#x27;s official factory team in the World Endurance Championship, taking over the project from American team Group 44. However, the XJS V12&#x27;s were brought out of their early retirement for one off events over 1985, 1986 and 1987 with their best result coming at the 1985 James Hardie 1000 at the famous Mount Panorama Circuit in Australia. Not only were the Jaguars easily the fastest cars in the race (in what was Australia&#x27;s first year of running to Group A rules), but local Jaguar driver John Goss teamed with TWR regular, West Germany&#x27;s Armin Hahne in the team&#x27;s 3rd car to win the race with Walkinshaw and Percy finishing 3rd.

As Jaguar&#x27;s official World Sportscar Championship team, TWR&#x27;s first car, XJR6, used the engine, but in the following year the engine was upgraded to 6.9 L and in 1988 the XJR9 used the engine&#x27;s most famous displacement of . By 1991, the V12 was good for 7.4 L inside the XJR12, developing an impressive 

TWR also upgraded production Jaguar cars (usually XJRSes), with a variety of styling, handling and performance modifications. Most of the cars thus modified were straight from the Jaguar factory and sold through Jaguar dealerships.

By 1989, TWR were selling moderate numbers of XJRSes fitted with a version of the V12, which pre-dated the Jaguar production version by some 3 years.

==Lister==
Lister Cars, a well-known Jaguar tuner with a long history of technical collaboration with the British automaker, made frequent use of this powerplant. The first Jaguar Lister XJRSes were built by the company BLE Automotive in Erdington, Birmingham in the early 1980s until the Lister brand was passed on to WP Automotive of Leatherhead. In 1991, they fitted the version of the engine, with a bore and stroke, into a modified Jaguar XJS, which was rebadged Lister Le Mans. This engine officially produced and . From 1993, Lister Cars owner Laurence Pearce produced the company&#x27;s first in house design the Lister Storm, which, naturally, continued using the V12 engine, both on the road and on the track, the car becoming a mainstay of the FIA GT Championship and several national championships for the following decade.

<text>Pozole (; from , meaning &quot;cacahuazintle&quot;, a variety of corn or maize) is a traditional soup or stew from Mexican cuisine. It is made from hominy with meat (typically chicken or pork), and can be seasoned and garnished with shredded lettuce or cabbage, chili peppers, onion, garlic, radishes, avocado, salsa or limes. Known in Mesoamerica since the pre-Columbian era, the stew is common across Mexico and neighboring countries, served both as a day-to-day meal and as a festive dish.

== Description ==

Pozole can be prepared in many ways, but all variations include a base of cooked hominy in broth. The broth is most commonly made with chicken or pork, but vegetarian preparations exist. When the broth is meat-based, pieces of the meat used to make the broth are usually served in the final dish; vegetarian versions substitute beans for the meat.

The three main types of pozole are &quot;blanco&quot; (white), &quot;verde&quot; (green), and &quot;rojo&quot; (red). &quot;Pozole blanco&quot;—&quot;white pozole&quot;—is the preparation without any additional green or red sauce. &quot;Pozole verde&quot;—&quot;green pozole&quot;—adds a rich salsa verde based on green ingredients, possibly including tomatillos, epazote, cilantro, green chiles (typically jalapeños or serranos), or pepitas. &quot;Pozole rojo&quot;—&quot;red pozole&quot;—is similar, but using a salsa roja made from one or more dried or smoked red chiles, such as guajillo, piquin, or ancho, and usually tomato.

Pozole is commonly served accompanied by a wide variety of toppings, particularly raw vegetables. Common toppings include chopped onion, shredded cabbage, sliced radish, avocado, limes, oregano, tostadas, chicharrón, and chiles.

== Regional customs ==
Pozole is also considered a festive dish. In Mexico and in New Mexico, pozole is typically served on New Year&#x27;s Eve to celebrate the new year. Pozole is frequently served as a celebratory dish throughout Mexico and in Hispanic communities outside Mexico. Other occasions for serving pozole include Mexican Independence Day, birthdays, Christmas, and other holidays.
Pozole is a typical dish in various states, such as Nayarit, Sinaloa, Michoacán, Guerrero, Zacatecas, Jalisco, and Morelos. Pozole is served in Mexican restaurants worldwide. It is also popular in the cuisine of New Mexico where it is known as &quot;posole&quot;, and is a common dish among the Puebloan Indigenous peoples residing along the Rio Grande.

In the Southwestern United States, a type of field corn (&quot;posole&quot; corn) is used that differs from hominy. It is considered to be more flavorful and has a firmer texture than hominy which tends to be softer and mushier than posole.
The Hopi people make a variety called noquivi (Hopi: &quot;nöqkwivi&quot;), using lamb or mutton rather than the traditional pork. It is often made from dried blue corn posole kernels; green chiles and juniper berries (instead of bay leaves) are added to the stew. This variety of posole is also prepared by the Puebloan people of New Mexico.

== History ==
Pozole was mentioned in the 16th century Florentine Codex by Bernardino de Sahagún. Since maize was a sacred plant for the Aztecs and other inhabitants of Mesoamerica, pozole was made to be consumed on special occasions.

According to research by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History) and the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, on these special occasions, the meat used in the pozole may have been human.
Possible archeological evidence of mass cannibalism may support this theory, and there is widespread scholarly agreement that the Aztecs practiced cannibalism in the context of human sacrifice and warfare, though the social and dietary significance of such acts is disputed.
While some authors such as Marvin Harris suggest that human flesh was a significant part of an aristocratic diet, others argue that there was not sufficient human flesh available to be a major source of proteins and that its consumption was chiefly a status symbol.

<doc id="882006" wikidata="Q638926" url="?curid=882006" title="House of Obrenović">
<text>The House of Obrenović or Obrenović Dynasty (, Обрeновићи / Obrenovići, ) was a Serbian dynasty that ruled Serbia from 1815 to 1842, and again from 1858 to 1903. 

They came to power through the leadership of their progenitor Miloš Obrenović I in the Serbian Uprising of 1815–1817 against the Ottoman Empire, which led to the formation of the Principality of Serbia in 1817. The Obrenović dynasty were traditionally allied with Austria-Hungary and opposed the Russian-supported House of Karađorđević.

The family&#x27;s rule came to an end in a coup d’état by the military conspirators, often known today as the Black Hand, who invaded the royal palace and murdered King Alexander I, who died without an heir. The National Assembly of Serbia invited Peter Karađorđević to become king of Serbia.

Unlike other Balkan states such as Greece, Bulgaria, or Romania, Serbia did not import a member of an existing European royal family (mostly German dynasties) to take its throne; the Obrenović dynasty, like its Karađorđević rival, was an indigenous Serbian family.

==List of monarchs==

Unlike most other dynasties in Europe, where a regnal number is used to distinguish different monarchs who shared the same given name, the Obrenović dynasty assigned subsequent regnal numbers to each ruling prince. Thus, there was never a Milan I, Milan III, a Michael I or a Michael II. Milan II and Michael III were simply the second and third ruling prince from the Obrenović dynasty. This practice was discontinued when prince Milan IV proclaimed himself king and declared the principality of Serbia a kingdom (1882).

<doc id="882009" wikidata="Q1080403" url="?curid=882009" title="Birmingham Hodge Hill (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Birmingham Hodge Hill was a constituency of part of the city of Birmingham represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament from 2004 to 2024 by Liam Byrne of the Labour Party.

Under the 2023 periodic review of Westminster constituencies, the seat was abolished and largely replaced with constituency of [[Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North]]. It was first contested at the 2024 general election, with Byrne being re-elected for the new seat.

==Constituency profile==
The constituency covered a diverse area of east Birmingham, including the predominantly Asian inner-city area of Washwood Heath and the mostly white area of Shard End on the city&#x27;s eastern boundary, as well as Hodge Hill itself. There is roughly a three-way split of social housing, privately rented and privately owned homes. The area has a high proportion of low-income households, with the constituency having one of the highest Indices of Multiple Deprivation in the West Midlands for its central area.

== Boundaries ==

1983–1997: The City of Birmingham wards of Hodge Hill, Shard End, and Washwood Heath &quot;(as they existed on 1 February 1983)&quot;.

1997–2010: The City of Birmingham wards of Hodge Hill, Shard End, and Washwood Heath &quot;(as they existed on 1 June 1994)&quot;.

2010–2018: The City of Birmingham wards of Bordesley Green, Hodge Hill, Shard End, and Washwood Heath &quot;(as they existed on 12 April 2005)&quot;. 

When the Hodge Hill area committee district of Birmingham was created in 2004, its boundaries were those of the constituency.

2018–2024: Following a local government boundary review, which did not effect the parliamentary boundaries, the contents of the constituency were as follows with effect from May 2018:

* The City of Birmingham wards of Alum Rock, Bromford &amp; Hodge Hill, Heartlands, Shard End and Ward End, most of Glebe Farm &amp; Tile Cross, and Small Heath, and small parts of Bordesley &amp; Highgate, and Bordesley Green.

Further to the 2023 periodic review of Westminster constituencies which came into effect for the 2024 general election, the Boundary Commission for England abolished the constituency and created the new seat of Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North as its primary successor; Alum Rock was transferred to Birmingham Ladywood and Small Heath to Birmingham Yardley, with the bulk of the remainder being included in the new seat.

==History==
The constituency was created in 1983, taking much of abolished Birmingham Stechford, the remainder of which bolstered Birmingham Yardley (principally Stechford itself). The predecessor seat was won by the Labour candidate in all but one election since its 1950 creation. 

The first Member of Parliament (MP) was Terry Davis, who had been MP for Birmingham Stechford from 1979 to 1983. In 2004, the appointment of Davis as secretary general of the Council of Europe resulted in a fiercely contested by-election. The seat saw a strong result by the Liberal Democrat candidate, who hoped to build on her party&#x27;s previous by-election gain at Brent East, as well as vote splitting by the similarly aligned-to-Labour, anti-war RESPECT The Unity Coalition candidate. On a low turnout, the incumbent party, represented by Liam Byrne, held the seat by a margin of 460 votes over the Liberal Democrats. The 2015 result made the seat the ninth safest of Labour&#x27;s 232 seats by percentage of majority. In 2017, Byrne received over 80% of the vote.

Note: percentage changes are from the figures at the 2001 general election, not the 2004 by-election.




===Elections in the 2010s===














1: The Liberal Democrats suspended Waheed Rafiq from the party over numerous antisemitic and other offensive social media posts. It was too late to prevent him standing in the election and his name remained on the ballot paper as a Liberal Democrat. Rafiq polled the lowest percentage for any Liberal Democrat candidate in the 2019 election.

<doc id="882010" wikidata="Q2778065" url="?curid=882010" title="Cayley transform">
<text>In mathematics, the Cayley transform, named after Arthur Cayley, is any of a cluster of related things. As originally described by , the Cayley transform is a mapping between skew-symmetric matrices and special orthogonal matrices. The transform is a homography used in real analysis, complex analysis, and quaternionic analysis. In the theory of Hilbert spaces, the Cayley transform is a mapping between linear operators .

==Real homography==
A simple example of a Cayley transform can be done on the real projective line. The Cayley transform here will permute the elements of {1, 0, −1, ∞} in sequence. For example, it maps the positive real numbers to the interval [−1, 1]. Thus the Cayley transform is used to adapt Legendre polynomials for use with functions on the positive real numbers with Legendre rational functions.

As a real homography, points are described with projective coordinates, and the mapping is
:formula_1

==Complex homography==

On the upper half of the complex plane, the Cayley transform is:
:formula_2
Since formula_3 is mapped to formula_4, and Möbius transformations permute the generalised circles in the complex plane, formula_5 maps the real line to the unit circle. Furthermore, since formula_5 is a homeomorphism and formula_7 is taken to 0 by formula_5, the upper half-plane is mapped to the unit disk.

In terms of the models of hyperbolic geometry, this Cayley transform relates the Poincaré half-plane model to the Poincaré disk model.

In electrical engineering the Cayley transform has been used to map a reactance half-plane to the Smith chart used for impedance matching of transmission lines.

==Quaternion homography==
In the four-dimensional space of quaternions formula_9, the versors
:formula_10 form the unit 3-sphere.

Since quaternions are non-commutative, elements of its projective line have homogeneous coordinates written formula_11 to indicate that the homogeneous factor multiplies on the left. The quaternion transform is
:formula_12

The real and complex homographies described above are instances of the quaternion homography where formula_13 is zero or formula_14, respectively.
Evidently the transform takes formula_15 and takes formula_16.

Evaluating this homography at formula_17 maps the versor formula_18 into its axis:
:formula_19
But formula_20

Thus formula_21

In this form the Cayley transform has been described as a rational parametrization of rotation: Let formula_22 in the complex number identity
:formula_23
where the right hand side is the transform of formula_24 and the left hand side represents the rotation of the plane by negative formula_25 radians.

===Inverse===
Let formula_26 Since
:formula_27
where the equivalence is in the projective linear group over quaternions, the inverse of formula_28 is
:formula_29
Since homographies are bijections, formula_30 maps the vector quaternions to the 3-sphere of versors. As versors represent rotations in 3-space, the homography formula_31 produces rotations from the ball in formula_32.

== Matrix map ==
Among &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; square matrices over the reals, with &quot;I&quot; the identity matrix, let &quot;A&quot; be any skew-symmetric matrix (so that &quot;A&quot;T = −&quot;A&quot;). 

Then &quot;I&quot; + &quot;A&quot; is invertible, and the Cayley transform
:formula_33
produces an orthogonal matrix, &quot;Q&quot; (so that &quot;Q&quot;T&quot;Q&quot; = &quot;I&quot;). The matrix multiplication in the definition of &quot;Q&quot; above is commutative, so &quot;Q&quot; can be alternatively defined as formula_34. In fact, &quot;Q&quot; must have determinant +1, so is special orthogonal. 

Conversely, let &quot;Q&quot; be any orthogonal matrix which does not have −1 as an eigenvalue; then
:formula_35
is a skew-symmetric matrix. (See also: Involution.) The condition on &quot;Q&quot; automatically excludes matrices with determinant −1, but also excludes certain special orthogonal matrices.

However, any rotation (special orthogonal) matrix &quot;Q&quot; can be written as

:formula_36

for some skew-symmetric matrix &quot;A&quot;; more generally any orthogonal matrix &quot;Q&quot; can be written as

:formula_37

for some skew-symmetric matrix &quot;A&quot; and some diagonal matrix &quot;E&quot; with ±1 as entries.

A slightly different form is also seen, requiring different mappings in each direction,
:formula_38

The mappings may also be written with the order of the factors reversed; however, &quot;A&quot; always commutes with (μ&quot;I&quot; ± &quot;A&quot;)−1, so the reordering does not affect the definition.

=== Examples ===
In the 2×2 case, we have
:formula_39
The 180° rotation matrix, −&quot;I&quot;, is excluded, though it is the limit as tan θ⁄2 goes to infinity.

In the 3×3 case, we have
:formula_40

where &quot;K&quot; = &quot;w&quot;2 + &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2 + &quot;z&quot;2, and where &quot;w&quot; = 1. This we recognize as the rotation matrix corresponding to quaternion

:formula_41

(by a formula Cayley had published the year before), except scaled so that &quot;w&quot; = 1 instead of the usual scaling so that &quot;w&quot;2 + &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2 + &quot;z&quot;2 = 1. Thus vector (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) is the unit axis of rotation scaled by tan θ⁄2. Again excluded are 180° rotations, which in this case are all &quot;Q&quot; which are symmetric (so that &quot;Q&quot;T = &quot;Q&quot;).

=== Other matrices ===
One can extend the mapping to complex matrices by substituting &quot;unitary&quot; for &quot;orthogonal&quot; and &quot;skew-Hermitian&quot; for &quot;skew-symmetric&quot;, the difference being that the transpose (·T) is replaced by the conjugate transpose (·H). This is consistent with replacing the standard real inner product with the standard complex inner product. In fact, one may extend the definition further with choices of adjoint other than transpose or conjugate transpose.

Formally, the definition only requires some invertibility, so one can substitute for &quot;Q&quot; any matrix &quot;M&quot; whose eigenvalues do not include −1. For example,
:formula_42
Note that &quot;A&quot; is skew-symmetric (respectively, skew-Hermitian) if and only if &quot;Q&quot; is orthogonal (respectively, unitary) with no eigenvalue −1.

== Operator map ==
An infinite-dimensional version of an inner product space is a Hilbert space, and one can no longer speak of matrices. However, matrices are merely representations of linear operators, and these can be used. So, generalizing both the matrix mapping and the complex plane mapping, one may define a Cayley transform of operators.
:formula_43
Here the domain of &quot;U&quot;, dom &quot;U&quot;, is (&quot;A&quot;+i&quot;I&quot;) dom &quot;A&quot;. See self-adjoint operator for further details.

<text>Proofs and Refutations: The Logic of Mathematical Discovery is a 1976 book by philosopher Imre Lakatos expounding his view of the progress of mathematics. The book is written as a series of Socratic dialogues involving a group of students who debate the proof of the Euler characteristic defined for the polyhedron. A central theme is that definitions are not carved in stone, but often have to be patched up in the light of later insights, in particular failed proofs. This gives mathematics a somewhat experimental flavour. At the end of the Introduction, Lakatos explains that his purpose is to challenge formalism in mathematics, and to show that informal mathematics grows by a logic of &quot;proofs and refutations&quot;.

==Background==
The 1976 book &quot;Proofs and Refutations&quot; is based on the first three chapters of his 1961 four-chapter doctoral thesis &quot;Essays in the Logic of Mathematical Discovery&quot;. But its first chapter is Lakatos&#x27;s own revision of its chapter 1 that was first published as &quot;Proofs and Refutations&quot; in four parts in 1963–4 in the &quot;British Journal for the Philosophy of Science&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Many important logical ideas are explained in the book. For example, the difference between a counterexample to a lemma (a so-called &#x27;local counterexample&#x27;) and a counterexample to the specific conjecture under attack (a &#x27;global counterexample&#x27; to the Euler characteristic, in this case) is discussed.

Lakatos argues for a different kind of textbook, one that uses heuristic style. To the critics that say such a textbook would be too long, he replies: &#x27;The answer to this pedestrian argument is: let us try.&#x27;

The book includes two appendices. In the first, Lakatos gives examples of the heuristic process in mathematical discovery. In the second, he contrasts the deductivist and heuristic approaches and provides heuristic analysis of some &#x27;proof generated&#x27; concepts, including uniform convergence, bounded variation, and the Carathéodory definition of a measurable set.

The pupils in the book are named after letters of the Greek alphabet.

== Method ==

Though the book is written as a narrative, it aims to develop an actual method of investigation based upon &quot;proofs and refutations&quot;. In Appendix I, Lakatos summarizes this method by the following list of stages:

# Primitive conjecture.
# Proof (a rough thought-experiment or argument, decomposing the primitive conjecture into subconjectures).
# &quot;Global&quot; counterexamples (counterexamples to the primitive conjecture) emerge.
# Proof re-examined: the &quot;guilty lemma&quot; to which the global counter-example is a &quot;local&quot; counterexample is spotted. This guilty lemma may have previously remained &quot;hidden&quot; or may have been misidentified. Now it is made explicit, and built into the primitive conjecture as a condition. The theorem - the improved conjecture - supersedes the primitive conjecture with the new proof-generated concept as its paramount new feature.

He goes on and gives further stages that might sometimes take place:

==Publication history==
The 1976 book has been translated into more than 15 languages worldwide, including Chinese, Korean, Serbo-Croat and Turkish, and went into its second Chinese edition in 2007.

==Impact on teaching==
A number of mathematics teachers have implemented Lakatos&#x27; method of proofs and refutations in the classroom, when teaching other mathematical topics. The method has been applied to the analysis and presentation of problem solving in mechanics
by high school to college level students.

The Mathematical Association of America has included this book on a list of books that they consider to be &quot;essential for undergraduate mathematics libraries&quot;.
