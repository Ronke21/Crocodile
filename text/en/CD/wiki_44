<text>The Hamiltonian constraint arises from any theory that admits a Hamiltonian formulation and is reparametrisation-invariant. The Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity is an important non-trivial example.

In the context of general relativity, the Hamiltonian constraint technically refers to a linear combination of spatial and time diffeomorphism constraints reflecting the reparametrizability of the theory under both spatial as well as time coordinates. However, most of the time the term &quot;Hamiltonian constraint&quot; is reserved for the constraint that generates time diffeomorphisms.

== Simplest example: the parametrized clock and pendulum system ==

=== Parametrization ===

In its usual presentation, classical mechanics appears to give time a special role as an independent variable. This is unnecessary, however. Mechanics can be formulated to treat the time variable on the same footing as the other variables in an extended phase space, by parameterizing the temporal variable(s) in terms of a common, albeit unspecified parameter variable. Phase space variables being on the same footing.

Say our system comprised a pendulum executing a simple harmonic motion and a clock. Whereas the system could be described classically by a position x=x(t), with x defined as a function of time, it is also possible to describe the same system as x(formula_1) and t(formula_1) where the relation between x and t is not directly specified. Instead, x and t are determined by the parameter formula_1, which is simply a parameter of the system, possibly having no objective meaning in its own right.

The system would be described by the position of a pendulum from the center, denoted formula_4, and the reading on the clock, denoted formula_5. We put these variables on the same footing by introducing a fictitious parameter formula_1,
formula_7
whose &#x27;evolution&#x27; with respect to formula_1 takes us continuously through every possible correlation between the displacement and reading on the clock. Obviously the variable formula_1 can be replaced by any monotonic function, formula_10. This is what makes the system reparametrisation-invariant. Note that by this reparametrisation-invariance the theory cannot predict the value of formula_11 or formula_12 for a given value of formula_1 but only the relationship between these quantities. Dynamics is then determined by this relationship.

=== Dynamics of this reparametrization-invariant system ===

The action for the parametrized Harmonic oscillator is then
formula_14
where formula_4 and formula_5 are canonical coordinates and formula_17 and formula_18 are their conjugate momenta respectively and represent our extended phase space (we will show that we can recover the usual Newton&#x27;s equations from this expression). Writing the action as
formula_19
we identify the formula_20 as
formula_21

Hamilton&#x27;s equations for formula_22 are
formula_23
which gives a constraint,
formula_24

formula_25 is our Hamiltonian constraint! It could also be obtained from the Euler–Lagrange equation of motion, noting that the action depends on formula_22 but not its formula_1 derivative. Then the extended phase space variables formula_4, formula_5, formula_17, and formula_18 are constrained to take values on this constraint-hypersurface of the extended phase space. We refer to formula_32 as the `smeared&#x27; Hamiltonian constraint where formula_22 is an arbitrary number. The &#x27;smeared&#x27; Hamiltonian constraint tells us how an extended phase space variable (or function thereof) evolves with respect to formula_1:
formula_35
(these are actually the other Hamilton&#x27;s equations). These equations describe a flow or orbit in phase space. In general we have
formula_36
for any phase space function formula_37. As the Hamiltonian constraint Poisson commutes with itself, it preserves itself and hence the constraint-hypersurface. The possible correlations between measurable quantities like formula_11 and formula_12 then correspond to `orbits&#x27; generated by the constraint within the constraint surface, each particular orbit differentiated from each other by say also measuring the value of say formula_40 along with formula_11 and formula_12 at one formula_1-instant; after determining the particular orbit, for each measurement of formula_12 we can predict the value formula_11 will take.

=== Deparametrization ===

The other equations of Hamiltonian mechanics are
formula_46

Upon substitution of our action these give,
formula_47

These represent the fundamental equations governing our system.

In the case of the parametrized clock and pendulum system we can of course recover the usual equations of motion in which formula_5 is the independent variable:

Now formula_49 and formula_50 can be deduced by

formula_51
formula_52

We recover the usual differential equation for the simple harmonic oscillator,
formula_53

We also have formula_54 or formula_55

Our Hamiltonian constraint is then easily seen as the condition of constancy of energy! Deparametrization and the identification of a time variable with respect to which everything evolves is the opposite process of parametrization. It turns out in general that not all reparametrisation-invariant systems can be deparametrized. General relativity being a prime physical example (here the spacetime coordinates correspond to the unphysical formula_1 and the Hamiltonian is a linear combination of constraints which generate spatial and time diffeomorphisms).

=== Reason why we could deparametrize here ===

The underlining reason why we could deparametrize (aside from the fact that we already know it was an artificial reparametrization in the first place) is the mathematical form of the constraint, namely,
formula_57

Substitute the Hamiltonian constraint into the original action we obtain
formula_58
which is the standard action for the harmonic oscillator. General relativity is an example of a physical theory where the Hamiltonian constraint isn&#x27;t of the above mathematical form in general, and so cannot be deparametrized in general.

== Hamiltonian of classical general relativity ==

In the ADM formulation of general relativity one splits spacetime into spatial slices and time, the basic variables are taken to be the induced metric, formula_59, on the spatial slice (the metric induced on the spatial slice by the spacetime metric), and its conjugate momentum variable related to the extrinsic curvature, formula_60, (this tells us how the spatial slice curves with respect to spacetime and is a measure of how the induced metric evolves in time). These are the metric canonical coordinates.

Dynamics such as time-evolutions of fields are controlled by the Hamiltonian constraint.

The identity of the Hamiltonian constraint is a major open question in quantum gravity, as is extracting of physical observables from any such specific constraint.

In 1986 Abhay Ashtekar introduced a new set of canonical variables, Ashtekar variables to represent an unusual way of rewriting the metric canonical variables on the three-dimensional spatial slices in terms of a SU(2) gauge field and its complementary variable. The Hamiltonian was much simplified in this reformulation. This led to the loop representation of quantum general relativity and in turn loop quantum gravity.

Within the loop quantum gravity representation Thiemann formulated a mathematically rigorous operator as a proposal as such a constraint. Although this operator defines a complete and consistent quantum theory, doubts have been raised as to the physical reality of this theory due to inconsistencies with classical general relativity (the quantum constraint algebra closes, but it is not isomorphic to the classical constraint algebra of GR, which is seen as circumstantial evidence of inconsistencies definitely not a proof of inconsistencies), and so variants have been proposed.

=== Metric formulation ===

The idea was to quantize the canonical variables formula_61 and formula_62, making them into operators acting on wavefunctions on the space of 3-metrics, and then to quantize the Hamiltonian (and other constraints). However, this program soon became regarded as dauntingly difficult for various reasons, one being the non-polynomial nature of the Hamiltonian constraint:
formula_63
where formula_64 is the scalar curvature of the three metric formula_59. Being a non-polynomial expression in the canonical variables and their derivatives it is very difficult to promote to a quantum operator.

=== Expression using Ashtekar variables ===

The configuration variables of Ashtekar&#x27;s variables behave like an formula_66 gauge field or connection formula_67. Its canonically conjugate momentum is formula_68 is the densitized &quot;electric&quot; field or triad (densitized as formula_69). What do these variables have to do with gravity? The densitized triads can be used to reconstruct the spatial metric via

formula_70

The densitized triads are not unique, and in fact one can perform a local in space rotation with respect to the internal indices formula_71. This is actually the origin of the formula_66 gauge invariance. The connection can be used to reconstruct the extrinsic curvature. The relation is given by

formula_73

where formula_74 is related to the spin connection, formula_75, by formula_76 and formula_77.

In terms of Ashtekar variables the classical expression of the constraint is given by,

formula_78

where formula_79 field strength tensor of the gauge field formula_67 . Due to the factor formula_81 this is non-polynomial in the Ashtekar&#x27;s variables. Since we impose the condition

formula_82

we could consider the densitized Hamiltonian instead,

formula_83

This Hamiltonian is now polynomial the Ashtekar&#x27;s variables. This development raised new hopes for the canonical quantum gravity programme. Although Ashtekar variables had the virtue of simplifying the Hamiltonian, it has the problem that the variables become complex. When one quantizes the theory it is a difficult task ensure that one recovers real general relativity as opposed to complex general relativity. Also there were also serious difficulties promoting the densitized Hamiltonian to a quantum operator.

A way of addressing the problem of reality conditions was noting that if we took the signature to be formula_84, that is Euclidean instead of Lorentzian, then one can retain the simple form of the Hamiltonian for but for real variables. One can then define what is called a generalized Wick rotation to recover the Lorentzian theory. Generalized as it is a Wick transformation in phase space and has nothing to do with analytical continuation of the time parameter formula_5.

=== Expression for real formulation of Ashtekar variables ===

Thomas Thiemann addressed both the above problems. He used the real connection

formula_86

In real Ashtekar variables the full Hamiltonian is

formula_87

where the constant formula_88 is the Barbero–Immirzi parameter. The constant formula_89 is -1 for Lorentzian signature and +1 for Euclidean signature. The formula_74 have a complicated relationship with the densitized triads and causes serious problems upon quantization. Ashtekar variables can be seen as choosing formula_91 to make the second more complicated term was made to vanish (the first term is denoted formula_92 because for the Euclidean theory this term remains for the real choice of formula_93). Also we still have the problem of the formula_81 factor.

Thiemann was able to make it work for real formula_88. First he could simplify the troublesome formula_81 by using the identity

formula_97

where formula_98 is the volume,

formula_99

The first term of the Hamiltonian constraint becomes

formula_100

upon using Thiemann&#x27;s identity. This Poisson bracket is replaced by a commutator upon quantization. It turns out that a similar trick can be used to teat the second term. Why are the formula_74 given by the densitized triads formula_102? It actually come about from the Gauss Law

formula_103

We can solve this in much the same way as the Levi-Civita connection can be calculated from the equation formula_104; by rotating the various indices and then adding and subtracting them. The result is complicated and non-linear. To circumvent the problems introduced by this complicated relationship Thiemann first defines the Gauss gauge invariant quantity

formula_105

where formula_77, and notes that

formula_107

We are then able to write

formula_108

and as such find an expression in terms of the configuration variable formula_67 and formula_110. We obtain for the second term of the Hamiltonian

formula_111

Why is it easier to quantize formula_110? This is because it can be rewritten in terms of quantities that we already know how to quantize. Specifically formula_110 can be rewritten as

formula_114

where we have used that the integrated densitized trace of the extrinsic curvature is the &quot;time derivative of the volume&quot;.

<text>Steven Heighton (August 14, 1961 – April 19, 2022) was a Canadian fiction writer, poet, and singer-songwriter. He is the author of eighteen books, including three short story collections, four novels, and seven poetry collections. His last work was &quot;Selected Poems 1983-2020&quot; (House of Anansi Press) and an album, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Share&quot;.

==Life and work==
Heighton was born in Toronto, Ontario, and grew up there and in Red Lake, in northern Ontario. He travelled and worked in western Canada and Australia after high school, got a BA and MA from Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, and then travelled and worked for two years in Asia before settling back in Kingston and starting to write, at first part-time and eventually full-time.

Heighton&#x27;s most recent books are the novel &quot;The Nightingale Won&#x27;t Let You Sleep&quot; (2017), the Governor General&#x27;s Award-winning poetry collection &quot;The Waking Comes Late&quot; (2016), and the Trillium Award finalist &quot;The Dead Are More Visible&quot; (May 2012). Heighton is also the author of the novel &quot;Afterlands&quot; (2006), which appeared in six countries and was cited on best of year lists in ten publications in Canada, the US, and Britain. The book is in pre-production for film. Heighton&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;The Shadow Boxer&quot; (2001), a story about a young poet-boxer and his struggles growing up, also appeared in five countries.

His work has been translated into ten languages and widely anthologised. He won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for Poetry in 2016. His books have been nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Award, the Trillium Award (twice), the Journey Prize, a Pushcart Prize, and Britain&#x27;s W.H. Smith Award (best book of the year). He received the Gerald Lampert Award, four gold and one silver award for fiction and for poetry in the National Magazine Awards, the Air Canada Award, the P.K. Page Award, the K.M. Hunter Award, and the Petra Kenney Prize. &quot;Flight Paths of the Emperor&quot; has been listed at Amazon.ca as one of the ten best Canadian short story collections and has been published in Britain by Granta Books.

Heighton has been the writer-in-residence at McGill University, Queen&#x27;s, Concordia, the University of Ottawa, and Massey College at the University of Toronto. He has also led writing workshops at the Summer Literary Seminars in Saint Petersburg, Russia (2007), the May Studios at the Banff Centre for the Arts (2001), Writing with Style at the Banff Centre, and the Sage Hill Writing Experience in Blackstrap Lake, Saskatchewan (2015 and 2016.)

His nonfiction book &quot;Reaching Mithymna: Among the Volunteers and Refugees on Lesvos&quot; was shortlisted for the 2020 Hilary Weston Writers&#x27; Trust Prize for Nonfiction.

In April 2021, Heighton released an album of eleven original songs with Wolfe Island Records/CRS Europe. &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Share&quot; emerges from &quot;an alchemical bath of blues, rock, folk, country, soul, and Americana.&quot; It was recorded at the Post Office Studio, Wolfe Island, Ontario, and produced by Hugh Christopher Brown.

Heighton died on April 19, 2022, at the age of 60 of cancer. He lived in Kingston, Ontario.

<text>The Grumman TB2F was a cancelled twin-engined torpedo bomber project, intended as Grumman&#x27;s successor to the successful TBF Avenger. However, only a mockup was ever constructed.

In 1944, during World War II, the &quot;Midway&quot; class aircraft carriers were being built, and Grumman attempted to design a new torpedo bomber to accompany those carriers. However, it was soon decided that, among other difficulties, it would be impractical to efficiently deploy twin-engined aircraft of this size from an aircraft carrier, and the plans were shelved.

<text>The Santa Clara River Valley is a rural, mainly agricultural valley in Ventura County, California that has been given the moniker Heritage Valley by the namesake tourism bureau. The valley includes the communities of Santa Paula, Fillmore, Piru and the national historic landmark of Rancho Camulos. Named for the Santa Clara River, which winds through the valley before emptying into the Pacific Ocean between the cities of Ventura and Oxnard, the tourist bureau describes it as &quot;Southern California&#x27;s last pristine agricultural valley nestled along the banks of the free-flowing Santa Clara River.&quot;

==Geography==

The Santa Clara River Valley is bordered by the Topatopa Mountains, Los Padres National Forest, and Sespe Condor Sanctuary to the north and the Santa Susana Mountains to the south. The valley stretches from the boundary of northwest Los Angeles County and the northern Santa Clarita Valley on the east to the Oxnard Plain on the west marked by South Mountain on the south bank of the river. The Santa Clarita Valley is part of the upper watershed of the river.

==Climate==

The valley has been called one of the &quot;most dangerous wind and fire corridors in Southern California.&quot; It forms a connection between the high desert and the coast, which serves as a &quot;wind-tunnel-like-corridor&quot; for funneling Santa Ana winds, which spread wildfires. This served to spread the Maria Fire, one of the 2019 California wildfires. This valley has also suffered through the Saddleridge Fire in 2019, the Creek Fire and the Thomas Fire in 2017, and the Sayre Fire in 2008.

=== Floods ===
Further information: Great Flood of 1862

The failure and near complete collapse of the St. Francis Dam took place in the middle of the night on March 12, 1928. The dam was holding a full reservoir of 12.4 billion gallons (47 billion liters) of water that surged down San Francisquito Canyon and emptied into the Santa Clara River, flowing down the river valley to the ocean.

==History==
A footpath through the valley was the only route linking the San Fernando and San Buenaventura missions for 18th-century Spanish missionaries. Thomas Bard launched a campaign in the 1870s to build a road through the valley as he wanted to connect the new Hueneme wharf with ore mines in Inyo County

The valley is an exception to the post-war urban development that has almost entirely eliminated citrus cultivation throughout most of Southern California.

==Transportation==
*Route 126 - the main E-W highway serving the valley.
*Route 150 - a minor E-W highway connecting Ojai to the valley.
*Route 23 - a minor N-S highway connecting Fillmore to the Conejo Valley.
*Santa Paula Branch Line - the railway corridor through the valley, mostly used for excursions.

<doc id="886957" wikidata="Q810968" url="?curid=886957" title="Batting order (baseball)">
<text>In baseball, the batting order or batting lineup is the sequence in which the members of the offense take their turns in batting against the pitcher. The batting order is the main component of a team&#x27;s offensive strategy. In Major League Baseball, the batting order is set by the manager, who before the game begins must present the home plate umpire with two copies of his team&#x27;s lineup card, a card on which a team&#x27;s starting batting order is recorded. The home plate umpire keeps one copy of the lineup card of each team, and gives the second copy to the opposing manager. Once the home plate umpire gives the lineup cards to the opposing managers, the batting lineup is final and a manager can make changes only under the Official Baseball Rules governing substitutions. If a team bats out of order, it is a violation of baseball&#x27;s rules and subject to penalty.

According to &quot;The Dickson Baseball Dictionary&quot;, a team has &quot;batted around&quot; when each of the nine batters in the team&#x27;s lineup has made a plate appearance, and the first batter is coming up again during a single inning. Dictionary.com, however, defines &quot;bat around&quot; as &quot;to have every player in the lineup take a turn at bat during a single inning.&quot; It is not an official statistic. Opinions differ as to whether nine batters must get an at-bat, or if the opening batter must bat again for &quot;batting around&quot; to have occurred.

In modern American baseball, some batting positions have nicknames: &quot;leadoff&quot; for first, &quot;cleanup&quot; for fourth, and &quot;last&quot; for ninth. Others are known by the ordinal numbers or the term #-hole (3rd place hitter would be 3-hole). In similar fashion, the third, fourth, and fifth batters are often collectively referred to as the &quot;heart&quot; or &quot;meat&quot; of the batting order, while the seventh, eighth, and ninth batters are called the &quot;bottom of the lineup,&quot; a designation generally referring both to their hitting position and to their typical lack of offensive prowess.

At the start of each inning, the batting order resumes where it left off in the previous inning; it does not reset to start with the #1 hitter again. If the current batter did not finish his at-bat during the previous inning (because another baserunner becomes the third out, by being picked-off or caught stealing), he will lead off the next inning with the pitch count reset to 0-0. While this ensures that the players all bat roughly the same number of times, the game will almost always end before the last cycle is complete, so that the #1 hitter (for example) almost always has one plate appearance more than the #9 hitter, which is a significant enough difference to affect tactical decisions. This is not a perfect correlation to each batter&#x27;s official count of &quot;at-bats,&quot; as a sacrifice (bunt or fly) that advances a runner, or a walk (base on balls or hit by pitch) is not recorded as an &quot;at-bat&quot; as these are largely out of the batter&#x27;s control, and does not hurt his batting average (base hits per at-bats.)

==History==

===Development of the set batting order===
Early forms of baseball or rounders from the mid 19th century did not require a fixed batting order; any player who was not on base could be called upon to bat. The concept of a set batting order is said to have been invented by Alexander Cartwright, who also instituted rules such as the foul ball and tagging the runner (as opposed to pegging him with the ball), and devised the shortstop position. In the early days of baseball, the rules did not require that the batting order be announced before game time. This permitted strategic decisions regarding batting order to occur while the game was in progress. For example, Cap Anson was known to wait to see if the first two men got on base in the first inning. If they did not, he would wait and hit in the next inning. However, in the 1880s, organized baseball began mandating that the batting order be disclosed before the first pitch.

For example, Rule 36 (&quot;The Batsman&#x27;s Position--Order of Batting&quot;) in &quot;The Playing Rules of Professional Base Ball Clubs&quot; of 1896 stated the following: &quot;The Batsmen must take their positions within the batsmen&#x27;s lines ... in the order in which they are named in the batting order, which batting order must be submitted by the Captains of the opposing teams to the Umpire before the game, and this batting order must be followed except in the case of a substitute player, in which case the substitute must take the place of the original player in the batting order. After the first inning the first striker in each inning shall be the batsman whose name follows that of the last man who completed his turn ... in the preceding inning.&quot;

===Contrast with cricket===

In cricket, the batting order is generally fixed so that players are sure of their role within the team, but there is no obligation to submit a definitive batting order and stick to it. A &quot;batsman&quot; can be &quot;promoted&quot; to a higher spot (or conversely, demoted to a lower one) in the batting order according to the team&#x27;s wishes.

The idea of a &quot;revolving&quot; batting order is unique to baseball, in which the on-deck batter at the time the final out is made in one inning becomes the lead-off batter (unless the current batter had not been struck-out or put a ball in play, in which case he returns as the lead-off batter with a 0-0 reset pitch count) in the next inning (unless his spot is taken by a pinch-hitter).

In the shorter form of cricket, there is only one innings per side, while in the longer form each side bats a maximum of two times. In a typical innings of this latter form, all eleven players on the team will have a chance to bat, and the innings finishes when 10 players are out. In the team&#x27;s second innings, the batting order is usually maintained, but the team can make any changes it desires.

As in baseball, many batting order configurations are possible, but a standard order might be:

*Two opening batsmen - able players who can negotiate a typically difficult period of play.
*Four middle order batsmen - specialist batsmen who may be more attacking.
*A wicket-keeper - the equivalent of the catcher, who is also expected to contribute with the bat.
*Four bowlers - the equivalent of pitchers; players who may or may not have any ability with the bat.

The concept of a batting order in baseball is &quot;profoundly democratic; no matter how good a hitter you are, you have to wait your turn.&quot; In that respect, although baseball, like cricket, &quot;may have begun as a gentlemen&#x27;s game,&quot; Americans gravitated toward baseball as a better embodiment of the country&#x27;s egalitarian ideal, and as a symbol of cultural as well as political independence from the British colonial legacy.
* The closest equivalent in cricket would be the 20% limit on the number of overs (sets of consecutive pitches) that a player can deliver in a one-day game; these force teams to have at least 5 players who can bowl parts of the inning. 

However, it should also be remembered that in cricket a single innings lasts hours or even days, and there are periods in which batting can be markedly easier or more difficult. A related factor is that a single ball is used in an innings for around 80 overs (approximately 5 hours of play). At the beginning of an innings, therefore, when bowlers are fresh and the ball is hard, it would be appreciably more challenging for the non-specialist batsmen to make an impact. Conversely, if such a player bats when the ball is old and the bowlers are tired, he can thrive, and this can often be a great source of pleasure to spectators, as insult is added to injury for the other side.

Finally, in cricket, there is no such thing as a designated hitter, so even if a bowler has no batting ability, he will still be required to bat, usually as the last man in the order.

==Positions in the lineup==
===Batter #1===

The first player in the batting order is known as the leadoff hitter. The leadoff batter is traditionally an individual with a high on-base percentage, plate discipline, bat control, good speed, and the ability to steal bases. His goal is to ensure the team has baserunners when the later, more powerful hitters come to bat. Once on base, his main goal is to get into scoring position (that is, 2nd or 3rd base) as quickly as possible, either through steals, hit and run plays or intelligent baserunning decisions, and then on to score.

His need for a high on-base percentage (OBP) exceeds that of the other lineup spots. Because leadoff hitters are selected primarily for their speed and ability to reach base, they are typically not power hitters, but contact hitters. Leadoff hitters typically hit mostly singles and doubles and draw walks to get on base. However, speed is not essential, as was shown by Wade Boggs, but it is highly desired among leadoff hitters.

However, today&#x27;s model for a leadoff hitter developed only gradually. An early &quot;job description&quot; for a leadoff hitter by baseball pioneer Henry Chadwick in 1867 advised only, &quot;Let your first striker always be the coolest hand of the nine.&quot; By 1898, though, a &quot;Sporting Life&quot;
article noted, &quot;It is customary to have a small, active fellow who can hit, run and steal bases, and also worry a pitcher into a preliminary base on balls, as a leader in the list.&quot;

Examples of classic leadoff hitters are Phil Rizzuto, Richie Ashburn, Maury Wills, Lou Brock, Pete Rose, Rod Carew, Tim Raines, and Ichiro Suzuki, with some having somewhat more power (Dick McAuliffe, Lou Whitaker, Rickey Henderson, Paul Molitor, Derek Jeter, Carlos Gómez, Gerardo Parra, Johnny Damon).

The term “leadoff hitter” can be used interchangeably to describe not only the first batter on the lineup card, but also the first batter up in any particular inning. For example, if, in the second inning, the fifth batter in the lineup card is the first batter up, it will be said that he is leading off or that he is the leadoff batter for that particular inning.

===#2===
The second batter is usually a contact hitter with the ability to bunt or sacrifice a baserunner over or get a hit. His main goal is to move the leadoff man into scoring position and to avoid grounding into double plays. Managers often like to have a left-handed hitter bat second because of the potential gap in the infield defense caused by the first baseman holding the leadoff batter. As early as 1892, it was recognized that a left-handed hitter in the second spot would make it easier for a man on base to steal second. On a very good team this batter can have characteristics of both a leadoff hitter and a power hitter (Manny Machado, Curt Flood, Joe Morgan, Christian Yelich, Robin Yount, Alan Trammell, Ryne Sandberg, Aaron Judge, Freddie Freeman), in some such cases abandoning the advantage of having a left-hand hitter in favor of a good right-handed hitter.

===#3===
The third batter, in the &quot;three-hole&quot;, is generally the best all-around hitter on the team, often hitting for a high batting average but not necessarily very fast. Part of his job is to reach base for the cleanup hitter, and part of it is to help drive in baserunners himself. Third-place hitters are best known for &quot;keeping the inning alive&quot;. However, in recent years, some managers have tended to put their best slugger in this position.

Typically the greatest hitters for a combination of power and OBP on their teams bat third, as is shown by the use of such hitters as Rogers Hornsby, Babe Ruth, Stan Musial, Mel Ott, Ted Williams, Tony Gwynn, Willie Mays, Chipper Jones, Barry Bonds, Mickey Mantle, Carl Yastrzemski, Duke Snider, Albert Pujols, Joey Votto, Andrew McCutchen, Miguel Cabrera, Ken Griffey Jr., Ryan Braun, Josh Hamilton, Evan Longoria, José Bautista, Edwin Encarnación, Mike Trout, and Hank Aaron in this position in the lineup. Even without the combination of extreme power (Yogi Berra, Al Kaline, George Brett) or high batting average (Ernie Banks, Harmon Killebrew, Johnny Bench, Mike Schmidt, Reggie Jackson) this batting position contains an inordinate number of hitters who eventually become members of the Baseball Hall of Fame.

===#4===

The fourth player in the batting order is known as the cleanup hitter, also known as the &quot;cleanup spot&quot; and in modern baseball is almost always one of the best hitters on the team, often the one with the most power and ability to drive in runs with extra-base hits (double, triple, or home run). Baseball managers tend to place hitters who are most likely to reach base ahead of the clean-up man, so that the fourth batter can &quot;clean&quot; the bases by driving these baserunners home to score runs. His main goal is to drive in runs, although he is expected to score runs as well. Hitting cleanup requires an exceptional level of talent, and the ability to deliver big hits in important situations (such as the bases loaded with two out). Examples of #4 hitters include Edgar Martínez, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Eddie Mathews, Norm Cash, Willie McCovey, Billy Williams, Tony Pérez, Fred McGriff, Eddie Murray, Daniel Murphy, Alex Rodriguez, Prince Fielder, David Ortiz, and Ryan Howard.

The theory behind the cleanup hitter is that, at the beginning of the game, if at least one of the first three batters reaches base with a single-base hit or walk, a home run will result in two or more runs rather than just one (a &quot;solo&quot; home run). If all three players reach base, thereby loading the bases, the cleanup hitter has the chance to hit a grand slam, scoring four runs. But even without the grand slam, this batter can extend an inning with a high batting average and frequent walks.

However, since home runs were a rarity before 1920, the concept of slotting a home run hitter fourth was slow to develop. Regardless, the need for a good run producer in that position was recognized from the early days in baseball history, as demonstrated by player-manager Cap Anson generally penciling his name there. As power came to play a larger role in the game, the tendency to bat home run hitters fourth developed accordingly. In 1904, sportswriter Tim Murnane stated unequivocally that &quot;The heavy hitter of the team is located at the fourth place.&quot;

The #3 and #4 hitters can often be switched in roles. For example, the 2011 Detroit Tigers had Miguel Cabrera as their #4 hitter but moved him to the #3 hitter after acquiring Prince Fielder as a free agent before the 2012 season.

===#5, #6===
The fifth and sixth (and sometimes seventh) batters have traditionally been RBI men, with the main goal of driving runners home, especially with sacrifice flies. The 3rd, 4th and 5th hitters in the lineup are called the &quot;heart of the order&quot;, signifying their collective ability to get on base, hit for power and drive in runs. Modern sabermetric baseball theories suggests that even the 5th and 6th batters should have high on-base percentages, though this approach has not been universally adopted. The fifth batter is usually a team&#x27;s second-best power hitter, and his purpose is often to &quot;protect&quot; the clean-up hitter in the batting order. He is expected to pose enough of a threat that the opposing team refrains from intentionally walking the clean-up hitter in potential scoring situations. The sixth hitter serves as a backup to the fifth hitter in case he fails to score runs or to drive more in himself if another scoring opportunity presents itself.

===#7, #8===
The seventh and eighth batters are often not as powerful as the earlier batters, and do not have as high a batting average. They are often players who are in the lineup more because of their defensive ability (typically catcher, second baseman or shortstop) than their ability as hitters. They are still expected to produce (as is the case for &quot;any&quot; regular starter), but they have less pressure in those spots. The main pressure on the eighth hitter comes when there are two outs: in this case, he must battle the pitcher to get on base so that the ninth hitter can come up. That way, even if the ninth hitter gets out, the top of the order comes up next. Very often the #7 hitter is a catcher, commonly the slowest baserunner on a team whose lack of speed would contribute to a large number of double plays higher in the order even if he is a good hitter (Bill Freehan). The eighth batter is often a good contact hitter, and can be used as a back-up #2 hitter. In leagues without designated hitters (DHs), the catcher often bats eighth, as they are often employed for their defensive skills and handling of the pitching staff, and tend to have a relatively low batting average. However, this is by no means always the case. In a situation where the pitcher is batting in the #9 slot, #8 hitters are sometimes intentionally walked to get to the pitcher&#x27;s spot in the #9 hole; however, with two outs the opposing pitcher is expected to battle the #8 hitter, so in the event of an out the pitcher leads off the following inning.

===#9===
The nine hole is traditionally meant for people that struggle to bat. 

In leagues where the DH rule is not in effect, the starting pitcher almost always fills the ninth spot, although relief pitchers may occupy a different spot due to a double switch. If there is a man on first or second base with fewer than two outs when the ninth hitter is up, he almost always bunts. However, a notable alternative exists to this, in which the pitcher or weakest hitter actually bats in the 8th slot, and another player with decent OBP and speed bats in the 9th slot, thus creating a kind of second leadoff hitter, at the bottom of the lineup, that loops to the top of the order afterwards. This has been used sparingly in the major leagues, but was notably employed by St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa in the second half of the 1998 baseball season, and again in August 2007 and in 2008, and by Milwaukee Brewers manager Ned Yost in 2008. Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon placed the pitcher in the #8 spot during the beginning of the 2017 Cubs season.
==Bragan&#x27;s brainstorm==
On August 18, 1956, major league manager Bobby Bragan placed his best hitter in the leadoff position and the remainder of his lineup in descending batting average order. In his 1966 book, &quot;Percentage Baseball&quot;, Earnshaw Cook claimed that Bragan&#x27;s lineup would result in 1 to 2 more wins per season. A computer simulation demonstrated the superiority of Bragan&#x27;s lineup.

<text>Richard Taylor (6 July 1981 – 8 August 2004) was a Welsh inline skating and freestyle skiing champion.

Taylor, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, learned to skate because he wanted to become a stuntman. He turned professional at the age of 15 after winning the World Amateur International Inline Skate Series (IISS) and qualifying 6th in the Professional Competition in Amsterdam 1996.
He went on to win the UK National In-Line skating championship twice. Taylor had a large fanbase, especially in Europe. He also competed in the British Freestyle Skiing and Snowboarding Championships in Les Deux Alpes in March 2004, winning the Big Air ski title and was about to join the Line Skis Professional Team that winter season.

==Death== 
He collided with a concrete lamp-post while skating near his home on 3 August 2004 and suffered a skull fracture that caused a coma. He also broke both legs in the accident. When he failed to regain consciousness, his parents on 8 August 2004 consented to his life support machine being turned off. His parents Gaynor and the now late John Taylor set up the Richard Taylor Memorial Fund to raise funds to have the Skatepark at the Knap, Barry upgraded and dedicated to his memory.

<doc id="886963" wikidata="Q938888" url="?curid=886963" title="Picardy third">
<text>A Picardy third, (; ) also known as a Picardy cadence or Tierce de Picardie, is a major chord of the tonic at the end of a musical section that is either modal or in a minor key. This is achieved by raising the third of the expected minor triad by a semitone to create a major triad, as a form of resolution.

For example, instead of a cadence ending on an A minor chord containing the notes A, C, and E, a Picardy third ending would consist of an A major chord containing the notes A, C, and E. The minor third between the A and C of the A minor chord has become a major third in the Picardy third chord.
Philosopher Peter Kivy writes:

According to Deryck Cooke, &quot;Western composers, expressing the &#x27;rightness&#x27; of happiness by means of a major third, expressed the &#x27;wrongness&#x27; of grief by means of the minor third, and for centuries, pieces in a minor key had to have a &#x27;happy ending&#x27; – a final major chord (the &#x27;tierce de Picardie&#x27;) or a bare fifth.&quot;

As a harmonic device, the Picardy third originated in Western music in the Renaissance era.

==Illustration==
What makes this a Picardy cadence is shown by the red natural sign. Instead of the expected B-flat (which would make the chord minor) the accidental gives us a B natural, making the chord major.

Listen to the final four measures of &quot;I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say&quot; with () and without () Picardy third (harmony by R. Vaughan Williams).

==History==
===Name===
The term was first used in 1768 by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, although the practice was used in music centuries earlier. Rousseau argues that “the [practice] remained longer in Church Music, and, consequently, in Picardy, where there is music in a lot of cathedrals and churches,” and “the term is used jokingly by musicians”, suggesting it might have never had an academic basis, a tangible origin, and might have sprung out of idiomatic jokes in France in the first half of the 18th century.
Robert Hall hypothesizes that, instead of deriving from the Picardy region of France, it comes from the Old French word &quot;picart&quot;, meaning &quot;pointed&quot; or &quot;sharp&quot; in northern dialects, and thus refers to the musical sharp that transforms the minor third of the chord into a major third.

The few Old French dictionaries in which the word &quot;picart&quot; (fem. &quot;picarde&quot;) appears give “&quot;aigu&quot;, &quot;piquant&quot;” as a definition. While &quot;piquant&quot; is quite straightforward—meaning spiky, pointy, sharp—&quot;aigu&quot; is much more ambiguous, because it has the inconvenience of having at least three meanings: “high-pitched/treble”, “sharp” as in a sharp blade, and “acute”. Considering the definitions also state the term can refer to a nail (&quot;clou&quot;) (read masonry nail), a pike or a spit, it seems &quot;aigu&quot; might be there used to mean &quot;pointy&quot; / “sharp”. However, not “sharp” in the desired sense, the one relating to a raised pitch, but in the sense of a sharp blade, which would thus completely discredit the word &quot;picart&quot; as the origin for the Picardy third, which also seems unlikely considering the possibility that &quot;aigu&quot; was also used to refer to a high(er)-pitched note, and a treble sound, thus perfectly explaining the use of the word &quot;picarde&quot; to designate a chord whose third is higher than it should be.

Not to be ignored is the existence of the proverb &quot;ressembler le Picard&quot; (&quot;to resemble an inhabitant of Picard&quot;) which meant “&quot;éviter le danger&quot;” (to avoid danger). This would link back to the humorous character of the term, that would have thus been used to mock supposedly cowardly composers who used the Picardy third as a way to avoid the gravity of the minor third, and perhaps the backlash they would have faced from the academic elite and the Church by going against the time’s scholasticism.

Ultimately, the origin of the name &quot;tierce picarde&quot; will likely never be known for sure, but what evidence there is seems to point towards these idiomatic jokes and proverbs as well as the literal meaning of &quot;picarde&quot; as high-pitched and treble.

===Use===
In medieval music, such as that of Machaut, neither major nor minor thirds were considered stable intervals, and so cadences were typically on open fifths. As a harmonic device, the Picardy third originated in Western music in the Renaissance era. By the early seventeenth century, its use had become established in practice in music that was both sacred (as in the Schütz example above) and secular:
Examples of the Picardy third can be found throughout the works of J. S. Bach and his contemporaries, as well as earlier composers such as Thoinot Arbeau and John Blow. Many of Bach&#x27;s minor key chorales end with a cadence featuring a final chord in the major:

In his book &quot;Music and Sentiment&quot;, Charles Rosen shows how Bach makes use of the fluctuations between minor and major to convey feeling in his music. Rosen singles out the Allemande from the keyboard Partita No. 1 in B-flat, BWV 825, to exemplify &quot;the range of expression then possible, the subtle variety of inflections of sentiment contained with a well-defined framework&quot;. The following passage from the first half of the piece starts in F major, but then, in bar 15, &quot;Turning to the minor mode with a chromatic bass and then back to the major for the cadence adds still new intensity.&quot;

Many passages in Bach&#x27;s religious works follow a similar expressive trajectory involving major and minor keys that may sometimes take on a symbolic significance. For example, David Humphreys (1983, p. 23) sees the &quot;languishing chromatic inflections, syncopations and appoggiaturas&quot; of the following episode from the St Anne Prelude for organ, BWV 552 from &quot;Clavier-Übung III&quot; as &quot;showing Christ in his human aspect. Moreover the poignant angularity of the melody, and in particular the sudden turn to the minor, are obvious expressions of pathos, introduced as a portrayal of his Passion and crucifixion&quot;:

Notably, Bach&#x27;s two books of &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, composed in 1722 and 1744 respectively, differ considerably in their application of Picardy thirds, which occur unambiguously at the end of all of the minor-mode preludes and all but one of the minor-mode fugues in the first book. In the second book, however, fourteen of the minor-mode movements end on a minor chord, or occasionally, on a unison. Manuscripts vary in many of these cases.

While the device was used less frequently during the Classical era, examples can be found in works by Haydn and Mozart, such as the slow movement of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto 21, K. 467:

Philip Radcliffe says that the dissonant harmonies here &quot;have a vivid foretaste of Schumann and the way they gently melt into the major key is equally prophetic of Schubert&quot;. At the end of his opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, Mozart uses the switch from minor to major to considerable dramatic effect: &quot;As the Don disappears, screaming in agony, the orchestra settles in on a chord of D major. The change of mode offers no consolation, though: it is more like the tierce de Picardie, the &#x27;Picardy third&#x27; (a famous misnomer derived from &quot;tierce picarte&quot;, &#x27;sharp third&#x27;), the major chord that was used to end solemn organ preludes and toccatas in the minor keys in days of old.&quot;

The fierce C minor drama that pervades the &quot;Allegro con brio ed appassionato&quot; movement from Beethoven&#x27;s last Piano Sonata, Op. 111, dissipates as the prevailing tonality turns to the major in its closing bars &quot;in conjunction with a concluding diminuendo to end the movement, somewhat unexpectedly, on a note of alleviation or relief&quot;.

The switch from minor to major was a device used frequently and to great expressive effect by Schubert in both his songs and instrumental works. In his book on the song cycle &quot;Winterreise&quot;, singer Ian Bostridge speaks of the &quot;quintessentially Schubertian effect in the final verse&quot; of the opening song &quot;Gute Nacht&quot;, &quot;as the key shifts magically from minor to major&quot;.
Susan Wollenberg describes how the first movement of Schubert&#x27;s Fantasia in F minor for piano four-hands, D 940, &quot;ends in an extended Tierce de Picardie&quot;. The subtle change from minor to major occurs in the bass at the beginning of bar 103:

In the Romantic era, those of Chopin&#x27;s nocturnes that are in a minor key almost always end with a Picardy third. A notable structural employment of this device occurs with the finale of the Tchaikovsky Fifth Symphony, where the motto theme makes its first appearance in the major mode.

==Interpretation==
According to James Bennighof: &quot;Replacing an expected final minor chord with a major chord in this way is a centuries-old technique—the raised third of the chord, in this case G rather than G natural, was first dubbed a &#x27;Picardy third&#x27; (&quot;tierce de Picarde&quot;) in print by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in 1797 ... to express [the idea that] hopefulness might seem unremarkable, or even clichéd.&quot;

==Notable examples==
* The Christian hymn tune &quot;Picardy&quot;, often sung with the text &quot;Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence&quot;, is based on a French carol from the 17th century or earlier. It is in a minor key, but the final chord is changed to major on the final verse.
*(Unknown) – &quot;Coventry Carol&quot; (written not later than 1591). Modern harmonisations of this carol include the famously distinctive finishing major Picardy third in the melody, but the original 1591 harmonisation went much further with this device, including Picardy thirds at seven of the twelve tonic cadences notated, including all three such cadences in its chorus.
*The Band – &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s On Fire&quot;, composed by Rick Danko and Bob Dylan, and appearing on both Music From Big Pink and The Basement Tapes, is in A minor and resolves to an A major chord at the end of the chorus.
*The Beatles – &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Back&quot;, from the soundtrack album of the film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. Ian MacDonald speaks of the way &quot;Lennon is harmonised by McCartney in shifting major and minor thirds, resolving on a Picardy third at the end of the first and second verses&quot;.
*Beethoven – &quot;Hammerklavier&quot;, slow movement
*Brahms – Piano Trio No. 1, scherzo
* Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - &quot;Lacrimosa&quot; from Requiem in D Minor K.626 (Süssmayr completion) is in the tonic key of D minor, where the final cadence ends on a D Major chord.
*Sarah Connor – &quot;From Sarah with Love&quot;, final cadence
*Coots and Gillespie, &quot;You Go to My Head&quot;. Ted Gioia describes the song as starting &quot;in the major key, but from the second bar onward, Mr. Coots seems intent on creating a feverish dream quality tending more to the minor mode&quot; before finally reaching a cadence in the major.
*Dvořák – &quot;New World Symphony&quot;, finale
*Bob Dylan – &quot;Ain&#x27;t Talkin&#x27;, the final song on &quot;Modern Times&quot; (2006), is played in E minor but ends (and ends the album) with a ringing E major chord.
*Roberta Flack – &quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot; ending and resolution. According to Flack: &quot;My classical background made it possible for me to try a number of things with [the song&#x27;s arrangement]. I changed parts of the chord structure and chose to end on a major chord. [The song] wasn&#x27;t written that way.&quot;
*Oliver Nelson – &quot;Stolen Moments&quot;, from the 1961 album &quot;The Blues and the Abstract Truth&quot;; Ted Gioia sees &quot;the brief resolve into the tonic major in bar four of the melody&quot; as &quot;a clever hook... one of the many interesting twists&quot; in this jazz composition. 
*Joni Mitchell – &quot;Tin Angel&quot;, from &quot;Clouds&quot; (1969); the Picardy third lands on the lyric &quot;I found someone to love today&quot;. According to Katherine Monk, the Picardy third in this song, &quot;suggests Mitchell is internally aware of romantic love&#x27;s inability to provide true happiness but, gosh darn it, it&#x27;s a nice illusion all the same.&quot;
*Donna Summer – “I Feel Love” (1977) alternates throughout with an accompaniment of &quot;synth swirls: major and minor; it’s basically a version of what Franz Schubert did for his whole career.&quot;
*The Fireballs – &quot;Vaquero&quot;, This (1961) Tex-Mex instrumental composed by George Tomsco and Norman Petty is clearly in the key of E minor, and yet ends with a ringing E Major chord.&quot;
*Hall &amp; Oates – &quot;Maneater&quot;; each verse has a Picardy third in the middle, moving from a major seventh in the second measure to a flat second in the third measure, and finally ending on a major first in the fourth measure. In the song&#x27;s original key of B minor, this is an A major chord to a C major chord, ending on a B major chord.
*The Turtles – &quot;Happy Together&quot; (1967) alternates between major and minor keys with the last chord of the outro featuring a Picardy third.
*The Zombies - &quot;Time of the Season&quot;, from the 1968 album Odessey and Oracle, is in E minor with each chorus ending on an E major chord.

Henryk Górecki&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 3 op 36&quot;, also known as the &quot;Symphony of Sorrowful Songs&quot; ends in a positive major third contrasting with the preceding greater part of the work.

Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Shine on you crazy diamond&quot; concludes with a sudden switch to a major key.

<text>The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) is a joint American and Canadian security accreditation program for cryptographic modules. The program is available to any vendors who seek to have their products certified for use by the U.S. Government and regulated industries (such as financial and health-care institutions) that collect, store, transfer, share and disseminate &quot;sensitive, but not classified&quot; information. All of the tests under the CMVP are handled by third-party laboratories that are accredited as Cryptographic Module Testing Laboratories by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). Product certifications under the CMVP are performed in accordance with the requirements of FIPS 140-3.

The CMVP was established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) of the Government of Canada in July 1995.

The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP), which provides guidelines for validation testing for FIPS approved and NIST recommended cryptographic algorithms and components of algorithms, is a prerequisite for CMVP.

<text>Wild Cards is a series of science fiction superhero shared universe anthologies, mosaic novels, and solo novels. They are written by a collection of more than forty authors (referred to as the &quot;Wild Cards Trust&quot;) and are edited by George R. R. Martin and Melinda M. Snodgrass. Set largely during an alternate history of post-World War II United States, the series follows humans who contracted the Wild Card virus, an alien virus that rewrites DNA and mutates survivors. Those who acquire crippling and/or repulsive physical conditions are known as Jokers, while those who acquire superhuman abilities are known as Aces, and those few who acquire minor, insignificant powers not worthy of being called aces are known as Deuces.

The series originated from a long-running campaign of the &quot;Superworld&quot; role-playing game, gamemastered by Martin and involving many of the original authors. The framework of the series was developed by Martin and Snodgrass, including the origin of the characters&#x27; superhuman abilities and the card-based terminology.

The first installment, &quot;Wild Cards&quot;, was released in January 1987 by Bantam Books and, as of February 2024, thirty-two books have been released through four publishers. The series has been adapted to comic books, graphic novels, and role-playing games.

== Premise ==

Set during an alternate history of post–World War II United States, the series follows events after an airborne alien virus is released over New York City in 1946 and eventually infects tens of thousands globally. The virus, designed to rewrite DNA, was developed as a bioweapon by a noble family on the planet Takis, and it is taken to Earth to test on humans, who are genetically identical to the people of Takis. Dr. Tachyon, a member of this family, objects and attempts to stop them. However, his attempt crashes their ship, releasing the virus.

The virus affects each individual differently, and it becomes known as the Wild Card virus because of these &quot;random and unpredictable&quot; symptoms. It kills 90% of those who contract it and mutates the remaining percentage. 9% survive but become Jokers, who develop minor or crippling physical conditions. The remaining 1% become Aces, who remain human or mostly human in appearance but develop superhuman abilities; Aces whose abilities are too trivial or specific to be generally valuable are called Deuces.

== Origin ==
&quot;Wild Cards&quot; began as a two-year-long campaign of the &quot;Superworld&quot; role-playing game, gifted to George R. R. Martin by Victor Milán, in Albuquerque, New Mexico; the players were science fiction writers, including Gail Gerstner-Miller, Milán, John J. Miller, Melinda M. Snodgrass, and Walter Jon Williams, and Martin served as gamemaster. Because of the amount of time and creative energy put into the campaign, Martin initially thought to write a novel on his character, Turtle. However, he realized this would have &quot;rescued one character from [the] &quot;SuperWorld&quot; campaign, but would have meant discarding all the rest&quot;. Since the game had been built by a group, he felt it should be a shared universe anthology, which were popular at the time. Martin invited other writers he believed would be interested in the universe, including Roger Zelazny, Lewis Shiner, Pat Cadigan, Howard Waldrop, Edward Bryant, and Stephen Leigh.

Martin said that the group loved comic books and superheroes but wanted to approach the material in a &quot;grittier, more adult manner than what we were seeing in the &#x27;80s&quot;. He cited the series&#x27; &quot;sense of history&quot; as a strength and expressed frustration with the retroactive continuity of mainstream comics. Martin also felt that the multitude of sources for superpowers in comics strained suspension of disbelief when taken together, and he believed a single plausible source was needed. Snodgrass suggested a virus, which allowed for the superpowered Aces, the &quot;monsters and freaks&quot; Jokers, and a high death toll. Snodgrass and Martin also developed the card based terminology, and Milán developed the pseudoscience of the series.

The series was originally meant to be set in a then contemporary 1985, but Waldrop, who was to write the first story, insisted that his story take place right after World War II. This created a forty-year gap between the first chapter and the remaining stories, pushing later contributions to fill in the intervening decades. Martin noted that this forced the authors to write about events they would have otherwise ignored, particularly the House Un-American Activities Committee and the McCarthy hearings, which gave rise to characters and plot points that &quot;added immeasurable richness to our world and depth of our characters&quot;. Waldrop&#x27;s story also forced Williams to rewrite a new story, &quot;Witness&quot;, which became the only shared world story to appear on the final ballot for a Nebula Award.

British writer Neil Gaiman met with Martin in 1987 and pitched a &quot;Wild Cards&quot; story about a character who lives in a world of dreams. Martin declined due to Gaiman&#x27;s lack of prior credits at the time. Gaiman went on to publish his story as &quot;The Sandman&quot;.

== In other media ==
=== Role-playing games ===

&quot;Wild Cards&quot; was adapted into a role-playing game format by Steve Jackson Games. Written by John J. Miller and published in June 1989, the sourcebook used GURPS Supers rules and contained descriptions of sixty of the characters. A supplement titled &quot;Aces Abroad&quot;, written by Kevin Andrew Murphy, was released in 1991. Green Ronin Publishing published &quot;Wild Cards Campaign Setting&quot;, written by Miller, for its &quot;Mutants &amp; Masterminds&quot; RPG in August 2008; the game debuted at Gen Con that year. Two supplements were released: an adventure anthology titled &quot;All-in&quot; and a character book titled &quot;Aces &amp; Jokers&quot;.

=== Comics ===
A four-issue &quot;Wild Cards&quot; limited series was released in 1990 by Epic Comics, an imprint of Marvel Comics. The issues were then collected and published as a trade paperback in October 1991. They were also included in &quot;Epic: An Anthology&quot;, released in 1992. A second limited series titled &quot;Wild Cards: The Hard Call&quot;, written by Daniel Abraham and illustrated by Eric Battle, was published over six issues from April to September 2008 by Dabel Brothers Productions. Dabel Brothers partnered with Del Rey to collect the titles in July 2008, including &quot;Wild Cards: The Hard Call&quot;, as graphic novels beginning in fall 2008. The issues were collected in a hardcover edition published by Dynamite Entertainment in February 2011.

Marvel Entertainment began publishing a 4-issue comic book limited series &quot;Wild Cards: The Drawing of Cards&quot; scripted by Paul Cornell in July 2022. The series adapted material from the first &quot;Wild Cards&quot; novel.

Bantam Books published two original &quot;Wild Cards&quot; graphic novels in 2023: &quot;George R. R. Martin Presents Wild Cards: Now &amp; Then&quot; by writer Carrie Vaughn and artist Renae De Liz, and &quot;George R. R. Martin Presents Wild Cards: Sins of the Father&quot; by writer Melinda Snodgrass and artists Michael Komarck and Elizabeth Leggett.

=== Audiobooks ===
Unabridged audiobook versions of the first five books have been released. Audiobooks of the first two installments were released by Brilliance Audio in November and December 2011. Versions of the third, fourth, and fifth novels were released by Penguin Random House from February to March 2016, featuring voice talents for each character. The sixth and seventh installments were released in February and June 2017. Commencing in August 2018, HarperAudio (UK) began releasing a new set of audiobooks in the series. The first three (&quot;Mississippi Roll&quot;, &quot;Low Chicago&quot; and &quot;Texas Hold&#x27;em&quot;) were narrated by William Hope. Next, Peter Noble narrated the two UK Wild Cards works (&quot;Knaves Over Queens&quot; and &quot;Three Kings&quot;). The sixth audiobook from HarperAudio (UK) (which was released in August 2021), &quot;Joker Moon&quot;, was performed by Maya Saroya. On a side note, in the UK, &quot;Three Kings&quot; has been released before &quot;Joker Moon&quot;, while the opposite is set to happen in the US.

=== Film ===
In October 2011, Syfy Films, a joint venture between Syfy Channel and Universal Pictures, acquired screen rights to &quot;Wild Cards&quot; under the direction of Gregory Noveck, senior vice president of production. Snodgrass was asked to write the screenplay, and she and Martin were to serve as executive producers. At the time of announcement, the film was intended to have a contemporary setting and the Sleeper among its characters. This was the second time the series was optioned.

=== Television ===
In August 2016, Universal Cable Productions acquired the rights to create a television series. Martin stated that the development was in early stages and that the production was working on choosing characters and stories to adapt. Because of his exclusivity contract with HBO, which aired &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; based on Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, Martin said he will not be involved in the adaptation. Snodgrass is to serve as an executive producer. In a blog post, Martin said that Noveck is also to serve as an executive producer.

Universal Cable Productions was teaming up with Hulu in November 2018 to develop two series based on the novels to establish a potential connected &quot;Wild Cards&quot; universe for the streaming service, but as of 2021, the upcoming series was moved from Hulu to Peacock.

<text>Interstate 495 (I-495) is an auxiliary route of I-95 in the US state of Massachusetts, maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). Spanning , it is the second-longest auxiliary route in the Interstate Highway System, being roughly shorter than I-476 in Pennsylvania.

Serving as one of two beltways (the other being Route 128) that forms a semicircle around Boston, and being the &quot;outer&quot; beltway, I-495 has its northern terminus in Salisbury, where it splits from I-95. Its route forms an arc with an approximately radius around the city and intersects seven additional radial expressways: I-93, US Route 3 (US 3), Route 2, I-290, I-90 (Massachusetts Turnpike), Route 24, and I-95 once more. I-495 has its southern terminus in Wareham, at the meeting of I-195 and Route 25. Originally, the stretch from Route 24 to I-195 was signed as Route 25, that status now only begins east of I-195.

I-495 and areas to its immediate east are often regarded as the inner ring of Greater Boston. The freeway&#x27;s northern segment parallels the New Hampshire border, at one point coming as close as to the boundary, and its southern end is roughly north of Cape Cod. West of I-495 is the Worcester area and Central Massachusetts. I-495 is a heavily traveled route serving communities in Plymouth, Bristol, Norfolk, Worcester, Essex, and Middlesex counties.

==Route description==

I-495 begins as the direct continuation of Route 25 at the intersection with I-195 in West Wareham. It starts as a two-lane highway in both directions. It gets the third lane during the interchange with Route 24. The junction includes the unusual transition of shrinking from the six-lane Route 25 to the four-lane interstate due to the third lane of Route 25 joining to and from I-195. The road heads roughly northwest, passing through the towns of Rochester and Middleborough (where the road meets US 44) as a four-lane highway before entering Bristol County, crossing the Taunton River at Raynham. I-495 becomes a six-lane highway just southeast of the Route 24 interchange (which is actually in neighboring Bridgewater).

The road continues northwest through Taunton and Norton before entering Mansfield, where there is a short collector–distributor road concurrency with Route 140. I-495 makes its southern junction with its parent route, I-95, on the border between Mansfield in Bristol County and Foxborough in Norfolk County. The road continues through Plainville (where there is a junction with US 1). The highway comes within of the Rhode Island state line before turning in a more northerly direction through Franklin and Bellingham.

I-495 passes through Milford, Medway, Hopkinton (where the junction with the Massachusetts Turnpike, or I-90, is located), and Westborough (where the road meets Route 9). It then continues through Southborough, Marlborough (where the road meets US 20 and I-290), Hudson, Berlin, Bolton (where the road finally begins to turn northeasterly), and Harvard. The Harold E. Brown Jr. Memorial Bridge on I-495 over Massachusetts Route 117 in Bolton was dedicated in October 2012 in honor of Brown Jr, a CIA officer who was killed in the 2009 Camp Chapman attack.

Continuing to turn to a more easterly direction, the road passes through Boxborough, Littleton (where there is an intersection with Route 2), Westford and Chelmsford. At the Chelmsford–Lowell line lies the intersection with US 3 and the Lowell Connector (formerly I-495 Business). The road continues through Lowell and Tewksbury before entering Essex County at Andover, directly at exit 94 (formerly exit 39).

In Andover, the road has a junction with I-93. It then enters the city of Lawrence, where the road turns due north, crossing the Shawsheen River into North Andover before crossing the Merrimack River at the O&#x27;Reilly Bridge back into Lawrence. It then heads into Methuen, where the road turns back to a northeasterly route after the junction with Route 213 (Loop Connector). The road heads into Haverhill, crossing the Merrimack twice more at a bend in the Bradford section of town. It passes north of downtown Haverhill, coming within of the New Hampshire state line, the closest the road comes to leaving the state. I-495 then passes through the towns of Merrimac and Amesbury before entering Salisbury where it immediately meets I-95 and ends approximately south of where that Interstate enters New Hampshire.

Throughout its path, the road passes closely to several existing state highways. From Wareham through to the Middleborough Rotary, it parallels Route 28. For much of the stretch between Norton and Milford, the road is within a few miles of Route 140, with two junctions of that highway in Mansfield and Franklin. From Milford to Bolton, the road passes just west of Route 85. Much of the northern third of the route also roughly parallels Route 110.

==History==

As early as the late 1940s, a plan was developing for an &quot;outer circumferential highway&quot; around Boston, a limited-access freeway meant to have an approximate radius from the Boston city center. A portion of this new &quot;outer circumferential highway&quot; southeast of the US 1 junction in Foxborough was meant to be a &quot;relocation&quot; of the existing Route 28, which was quickly changed in 1947 to a new designation of Route 25 as a full-length freeway from the Route 24 expressway in Raynham to Wareham. The section of I-495 between Route 24 in Raynham and I-95 at the Foxborough–Mansfield town line began construction at I-95 in 1976 and finished at the Route 25/Route 24 interchange in 1982. (Prior to 1982, I-495 ended at I-95; the section from Raynham to Wareham was just signed as Route 25). Route 25 was constructed in stages from the late 1950s to the late 1960s.

==Future==
In 2014, a new intelligent transportation system was installed to help commuters and the state better understand the traffic congestion on I-495. Some improvements expected to come to I-495 in the next few years include a project that will install fiber-optic cable, traffic cameras, and variable-message signs on I-495 from I-90 (Hopkinton) to I-93 (Andover).

In 2015, the state pledged $165 million to 285 million (equivalent to $ to $ in ) for improvements to the I-495/Massachusetts Turnpike intersection and is considering three different plans. The work is expected to begin in 2021 and be completed in 2025. Improvements to the I-495/Route 9 intersection will commence at the same duration, with a different budget.

==Exit list==

Interchanges were to be renumbered to mileage-based numbers under a project scheduled to start in 2016; however, this project was indefinitely postponed by MassDOT until November 18, 2019, when MassDOT confirmed that, beginning in late summer 2020, the exit renumbering project would start. On May 7, 2021, MassDOT announced that I-495 exit numbers would get renumbered starting on or after May 16, 2021, and it would last for approximately five weeks. The project was broken down into four sections:
* Segment 1: between Route 28 and I-95 (old exits 3–13)
* Segment 2: between I-95 and I-90 (old exits 14–22)
* Segment 3: between I-90 and US 3 (old exits 23–35)
* Segment 4: between US 3 and junction Route 110/I-95 (old exits 37–55) 

&quot;OLD EXIT XX&quot; plates will be up for 2 years.

<doc id="886993" wikidata="Q898233" url="?curid=886993" title="The Preppie Murder">
<text>The Preppie Murder is an American television film directed by John Herzfeld, written by Herzfeld and Irv Roud, and starring William Baldwin as Robert Chambers and Lara Flynn Boyle as Jennifer Levin. The film aired on ABC in 1989. It was based on the events of a murder committed by Robert Chambers, nicknamed the &quot;Preppie Killer&quot;. The film co-stars Danny Aiello, Joanna Kerns, and William Devane.

== Plot ==
The film reenacts Robert Chambers&#x27; murder of Jennifer Levin. Robert Chambers, a man who attended prep schools on a scholarship, kills Jennifer Levin, who herself was of a privileged background after they leave a trendy Manhattan bar together. When Detective Mike Sheehan arrests him, Chambers claims that he killed her in self-defense after rough sex got out of hand. In the ensuing trial, Chambers&#x27; attorney, Jack Litman, attacks Levin&#x27;s personal history. Chambers eventually pleads guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter.

== Cast ==
* Danny Aiello as Detective Mike Sheehan
* William Baldwin as Robert Chambers
* Joanna Kerns as Linda Fairstein
* Lara Flynn Boyle as Jennifer Levin
* Dorothy Fielding as Phyllis Chambers
* James Handy as Detective Joe Brady Quinn
* William Devane as Jack Litman

== Production ==
The film was shot mostly in Los Angeles, but some exterior shots took place in New York City. Mike Sheehan, who investigated the case, served as a consultant. Jennifer Levin&#x27;s parents declined involvement; her father called it &quot;exploitative&quot;. Linda Fairstein and Jack Litman also declined involvement. Director John Herzfeld wanted to tell Jennifer Levin&#x27;s story and &quot;clear a little of the mud off her&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;The Preppie Murder&quot; aired September 24, 1989, on ABC. It was released on home video in November 1993.

== Reception ==
Howard Rosenberg of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;vexing, powerful and heartbreaking—yet strangely enigmatic&quot;. John Leonard of &quot;New York&quot; called it &quot;pointless&quot; and compared it negatively to Linda Wolfe&#x27;s book, &quot;&quot;. John J. O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film&#x27;s denunciation of the press as exploitative was ironic, as it &quot;merely warms up the old headlines it pretends to abhor.&quot;

<doc id="886997" wikidata="Q325925" url="?curid=886997" title="Balthus">
<text>Balthasar Klossowski de Rola (February 29, 1908 – February 18, 2001), known as Balthus, was a Polish-French modern artist. He is known for his erotically charged images of pubescent girls, but also for the refined, dreamlike quality of his imagery.

Throughout his career, Balthus rejected the usual conventions of the art world. He insisted that his paintings should be seen and not read about, and he resisted attempts to build a biographical profile. Nevertheless, towards the end of his life he took part in a series of dialogues with the neurobiologist Semir Zeki, conducted at his chalet at Rossinière, Switzerland and at the Palazzo Farnese (French Embassy) in Rome. They were published in 1995 under the title &quot;La Qûete de l&#x27;essentiel&quot;, and in them he gives some of his views on art, painting and some other painters.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Balthus was born in Paris, in 1908, to Prussian expatriate parents. His given name was Balthasar Klossowski – his sobriquet &quot;Balthus&quot; was based on his childhood nickname, alternately spelled Baltus, Baltusz, Balthusz or Balthus.

His father, Erich Klossowski, was an art historian who wrote a noted monograph on Honoré Daumier. Erich grew up in the town of Ragnit in East Prussia, now part of Russia but then in the German Empire. Unlike his brother or parents, Balthus claimed that he belonged to the former Polish petty nobility (the &quot;drobna szlachta&quot;) and his family bore the Rola coat of arms. Balthus later fancifully elaborated on his family background, using the surname &quot;Klossowski de Rola,&quot; and adding the term &quot;count&quot; to this title, which no one in his family&#x27;s documented history had ever done. Balthus even had the Rola arms embroidered onto many of his kimono, in the style of a Japanese .

Balthus&#x27;s mother Elisabeth Dorothée Spiro Klossowska (known as Baladine Klossowska) was descended from Lithuanian Jews who had emigrated to East Prussia. In the catalogue of the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s 1984 Balthus exhibition, she was described as the daughter of a cantor from Korelitz in Novogrudok district in the Russian Empire. However, Balthus told his biographer Nicholas Fox Weber that this was erroneous, and that his mother came &quot;apparently from a Protestant family in the south of France&quot;. But according to Weber, this was a confabulation on Balthus&#x27;s part. In fact, Balthus would often embroider upon his story of his mother&#x27;s ancestry, saying that she was also related to the Romanovs and the Narischkins, powerful aristocratic families of Russia. In another confabulatory twist, Weber reports that Baladine&#x27;s lover, the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, had said that the Spiros were descended from one of the richest families of Sephardic Jews, that is that they were of Spanish, not Eastern European origin. Weber doubted this story too, since Balthus&#x27;s son Fumio, born in the late 1960s, had Tay–Sachs disease, a genetic disorder commonly associated with Eastern European Jews.
Balthus&#x27;s older brother Pierre Klossowski (1905–2001) became a noted writer and philosopher.

The Klossowski children grew up in an art-world environment, with frequent visits to their household by famous artists and writers, including Rilke, André Gide (who mentored Pierre), and Jean Cocteau (who would depict the family in scenes of his 1929 novel &quot;Les Enfants Terribles&quot;). The artists Maurice Denis and Pierre Bonnard were also visitors. The children had a Scottish nanny, and Balthus would later say that his first language was English, although his parents spoke German to one another.

Overall, Balthus had an idyllic memory of these early childhood years, which were disrupted when, shortly after the First World War began in 1914, the family were forced to leave Paris in order to avoid deportation due to their German citizenship. They settled first in Switzerland, later in Berlin.

In 1917 his parents separated, and his mother moved with the two boys to Geneva. They lived in a modest flat at 11, rue Pré-Jérôme, a comfortable neighborhood. About a year later his mother became the lover of Rilke. Rilke was very impressed with the young &quot;Baltusz&quot;&#x27;s artistic talent, and helped him to publish his first work in 1921, at the age of 13. This was a wordless novel titled &quot;Mitsou&quot; which included forty drawings by Balthus and a preface by Rilke. The comic-book-style pictures depict the story of a young boy who loses his beloved cat. The themes of the story foreshadowed Balthus&#x27;s lifelong fascination with cats, along with a feeling of loss or disappearance.

At Christmas of 1921, Baladine, financially destitute, moved to Berlin with her children in order to live with her brother.

===Young adulthood===
In 1926 Balthus visited Florence, where he copied many frescos by the Renaissance master Piero della Francesca. This inspired an early ambitious work of his: the tempera wall paintings of the Protestant church of the Swiss village of Beatenberg which he executed in 1927.

From 1930 to 1931 Balthus served in the French army in Morocco. He was drafted into the Moroccan infantry in Kenitra and Fes, worked as a secretary, and sketched his painting &quot;La Caserne&quot; (1933).

In 1933 he moved to Paris, taking a studio in the Rue de Furstemberg. Later he would move to another studio at the nearby Cour de Rohan. Balthus showed no interest in modernist styles such as Cubism. His paintings were realistic but introverted, in the manner of the second generation of Surrealist painters such as Salvador Dalí, who often used realistic techniques to depict psychological motifs or dream images. Balthus often depicted pubescent girls in erotic and voyeuristic poses. One of the most notorious works from his first exhibition in Paris was &quot;The Guitar Lesson&quot; (1934), which caused controversy due to its sadistic and sexually explicit imagery. It depicts a young girl arched on her back over the lap of her female teacher, whose hands are positioned on the girl as if to play her like a guitar: one hand near her exposed vulva, and the other hand grasping her hair. Other works from the same exhibition included &quot;The Street&quot; (1933), &quot;Cathy Dressing&quot; (1933) and &quot;Alice&quot; (1933).
Early on his work was admired by writers and fellow painters, especially by André Breton and Pablo Picasso. His circle of friends in Paris included the novelists Pierre Jean Jouve, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Joseph Breitbach, Pierre Leyris, Henri Michaux, Michel Leiris and René Char, the photographer Man Ray, the playwright and actor Antonin Artaud, and the painters André Derain, Joan Miró and Alberto Giacometti (one of the most faithful of his friends). In 1948, another friend, Albert Camus, asked him to design the sets and costumes for his play &quot;L&#x27;État de Siège&quot; (&quot;The State of Siege&quot;, directed by Jean-Louis Barrault). Balthus also designed the sets and costumes for Artaud&#x27;s adaptation for Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s &quot;The Cenci&quot; (1935), Ugo Betti&#x27;s &quot;Delitto all&#x27;isola delle capre&quot; (Crime on Goat-Island, 1953) and Barrault&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1959–1960).

In 1937 he married Antoinette de Watteville, who was from an influential aristocratic family from Bern. He had met her as early as 1924, and she was the model for the aforementioned &quot;Cathy Dressing&quot; and for a series of portraits. Balthus had two children from this marriage, Stanislas (born 1942) and Thaddeus Klossowski (born 1944), who recently published books on their father, including the letters by their parents. Stanislas, known as &quot;Stash&quot;, became a figure in swinging London and Paris in the 1960s.

===Champrovent to Chassy===
In 1940, with the invasion of France by German forces, Balthus fled with his wife Antoinette to Savoy to a farm in Champrovent near Aix-les-Bains, where he began work on two major paintings: &quot;Landscape near Champrovent&quot; (1942–1945) and &quot;The Living Room&quot; (1942). In 1942, he escaped from Occupied France to Switzerland, first to Bern and in 1945 to Geneva, where he became a friend of the publisher Albert Skira as well as the writer and member of the French Resistance, André Malraux. Balthus returned to France in 1946 and a year later traveled with André Masson to Southern France, meeting figures such as Picasso and Jacques Lacan, who eventually became a collector of his work. With Adolphe Mouron Cassandre in 1950, Balthus designed stage decor for a production of Mozart&#x27;s opera Così fan tutte in Aix-en-Provence. Three years later he moved into the Chateau de Chassy in the Morvan, living with his step-niece Frédérique Tison and finishing his large-scale masterpieces &quot;La Chambre&quot; (&quot;The Room&quot; 1952, possibly influenced by Pierre Klossowski&#x27;s novels) and &quot;Le Passage du Commerce Saint-André&quot; (1954).

===Later years===

As international fame grew with exhibitions in the gallery of Pierre Matisse (1938) and the Museum of Modern Art (1956) in New York City, he cultivated the image of himself as an enigma. 
In 1961, he moved to Rome where he presided over the Villa de Medici as director (appointed by the French Minister of Culture André Malraux) of the French Academy in Rome. He became a friend of the filmmaker Federico Fellini and the painter Renato Guttuso.

In 1977, he moved to Rossinière, Switzerland. That he had a second, Japanese wife Setsuko Ideta whom he married in 1967 and was thirty-five years his junior, simply added to the air of mystery around him (he met her in Japan, during a diplomatic mission also initiated by Malraux). A son, Fumio, was born in 1968 but died two years later.

The photographers and friends Henri Cartier-Bresson and Martine Franck (Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s wife) both portrayed the painter and his wife and their daughter Harumi (born 1973) in his Grand Chalet in Rossinière in 1999.

Balthus was one of the few living artists to be represented in the Louvre, when his painting &quot;The Children&quot; (1937) was acquired from the private collection of Pablo Picasso.

He co-authored a book of dialogues with the neurobiologist Semir Zeki, entitled &quot;La Quête de l&#x27;essentiel.&quot;

He died in Rossinière, Switzerland. Prime ministers and rock stars alike attended his funeral. Bono, lead singer of U2, sang for the hundreds of mourners at the funeral, including the President of France, the Prince Sadruddhin Aga Khan, supermodel Elle Macpherson, and Cartier-Bresson.

===Style and themes===
Balthus&#x27;s style is primarily classical. His work shows numerous influences, including the writings of Emily Brontë, the writings and photography of Lewis Carroll, and the paintings of Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, Simone Martini, Poussin, Jean-Étienne Liotard, Joseph Reinhart, Géricault, Ingres, Goya, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Courbet, Edgar Degas, Félix Vallotton and Paul Cézanne. Although his technique and compositions were inspired by pre-Renaissance painters, there also are eerie intimations of contemporary surrealists like de Chirico. Painting the figure at a time when figurative art was largely ignored, he is widely recognised as an important 20th-century artist.

Many of his paintings show young girls in an erotic context. Balthus insisted that his work was not erotic but that it recognized the discomforting facts of children&#x27;s sexuality. In 2013, Balthus&#x27;s paintings of adolescent girls were described by Roberta Smith in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as both &quot;alluring and disturbing&quot;. In its transgressive themes and treatment of sexual taboo, his art has been compared to the work of the contemporary philosopher Georges Bataille (a friend of his brother Pierre Klossowski).

==Influence and legacy==

His work has influenced several contemporary artists, notably Duane Michals and Émile Chambon. He has also influenced the filmmaker Jacques Rivette of the French New Wave, whose film &quot;Hurlevent&quot; (1985) was inspired by Balthus&#x27;s drawings made at the beginning of the 1930s: &quot;Seeing as he&#x27;s a bit of an eccentric and all that, I am very fond of Balthus (...) I was struck by the fact that Balthus enormously simplified the costumes and stripped away the imagery trappings (...)&quot;.

His widow, Setsuko Klossowska de Rola, heads the Fonds Balthus, the archives of the painter, which is accessible to scholars as a long term deposit in the Museum of Fine Arts in Lausanne.

A reproduction of Balthus&#x27;s &quot;Girl at a Window&quot; (a painting from 1957) prominently appears in François Truffaut&#x27;s film &quot;Domicile Conjugal&quot; (&quot;Bed and Board&quot;, 1970). The two principal characters, Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) and his wife Christine (Claude Jade), are arguing. Christine takes down from the wall a small drawing of about 25×25 cm and gives it to her husband: Christine: &quot;Here, take the small Balthus.&quot; Antoine: &quot;Ah, the small Balthus. I offered it to you, it&#x27;s yours, keep it.&quot;

During December 2017, a public petition was circulated requesting that Balthus&#x27;s painting &quot;Thérèse Dreaming&quot; be removed from display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York due to its alleged explicit content and suggestive portrayal. Philip Kennicott, writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on 5 December 2017, in an article titled &quot;This painting might be sexually disturbing. But that&#x27;s no reason to take it out of a museum&quot;, summarized the museum&#x27;s long-standing position against censorship. The painting had previously been on display at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany in 2007 without incident.

==In popular culture==
* South African novelist Christopher Hope wrote &quot;My Chocolate Redeemer&quot; around a painting by Balthus, &quot;The Golden Days&quot; (1944), which appears on the book jacket.
* Stephen Dobyns&#x27;s book &quot;The Balthus Poems&quot; (Atheneum, 1982) describes individual paintings by Balthus in 32 narrative poems.
* Harold Budd&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;The White Arcades&quot; includes a track titled &quot;Balthus Bemused by Color&quot;.
* Robert Dassanowsky&#x27;s book &quot;Telegrams from the Metropole: Selected Poems 1980–1998&quot; includes &quot;The Balthus Poem&quot;.
* Thomas Harris&#x27;s book &quot;Hannibal&quot; (1999, Delacorte Press) says that the character Hannibal Lecter, a psychiatrist, cannibal, and genius, is Balthus&#x27;s cousin.
* William Minor&#x27;s book &quot;The Balthus Poems &quot;(Coracle, 2018) is a minimalist, absurdist approach to his life and work.
* Joyce Carol Oates&#x27;s 2018 book &quot;Beautiful Days: Stories&quot; contains the story &quot;Les beaux jours,&quot; which contains lyrical descriptions of Balthus&#x27;s paintings and imagines the life of an eleven-year-old model of Balthus.
* Maya Hawke&#x27;s 2022 single &quot;Thérèse&quot; from her second studio album &quot;Moss&quot; is inspired by Balthus&#x27;s painting entitled &quot;Thérèse Dreaming&quot;.
* The UK print edition of Philip Pullman&#x27;s short work &quot;The Collectors&quot; features &quot;Portrait de la jeune fille en costume d&#x27;amazone&quot; (1932) by Balthus as a cover image and inside print. The UK adult cover of Northern Lights (Pullman novel) also features another work by Balthus, &quot;Girl in Green and Red&quot; (1944).

==Exhibitions==
Balthus held his first exhibition at Galerie Pierre, Paris, in 1934. Following the ensuing scandal, he exhibited at the Pierre Matisse Gallery, New York, from 1938 to 1977, although he never visited the United States. Balthus&#x27;s first major museum exhibition was at the Museum of Modern Art in 1956. Other museum exhibitions of note include Musée des Arts Decoratifs, Paris (1966); Tate Gallery, London (1968); La Biennale di Venezia (1980); Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1980); Musée cantonal des beaux-arts de Lausanne (1993); Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (1984, traveled to Metropolitan Museum, Kyoto); Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (1984); and Palazzo Grassi, Venice (2001). &quot;Balthus: Cats and Girls: Paintings and Provocations&quot; at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (September 25, 2013 – January 12, 2014) was the first U.S. museum survey of the artist&#x27;s work in 30 years. A major retrospective overseen by the artist&#x27;s wife, Ideta Setsuko, was held in 2014 at the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum. An exhibition of Polaroid photographs taken by Balthus at the Museum Folkwang in Essen, Germany, was canceled over accusations of pedophilia. The German newspaper &quot;Die Zeit&quot; called the images, which depict a model named Anna from ages eight to 16, “documents of pedophile greed.”

Since then, despite attempts, no planned exhibition of Balthus’s work was censored or cancelled for such allegations.

==Films on Balthus==
* Damian Pettigrew, &quot;Balthus Through the Looking Glass&quot; (72&#x27;, Super 16, PLANETE/CNC/PROCIREP, 1996). Documentary on and with Balthus filmed at work in his studio and in conversation at his Rossinière chalet. Shot over a 12-month period in Switzerland, Italy, France and the Moors of England.

<text>Ben Kerr (April 27 1930 – June 17, 2005) was a Canadian author, broadcaster, musician and perennial candidate, who was most famous as one of Toronto, Ontario&#x27;s quirky street performers.

==Background==
Kerr was born April 27 1930 in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia to Benjamin Kerr, a professional golfer, and Mildred Audrey Torrance, a stenographer, and spent fifteen years in the Royal Canadian Air Force before settling in Toronto. In the 1960s, Kerr frequently played guitar in folk clubs in Toronto&#x27;s Yorkville district working alongside groups such as Steppenwolf, the Mynah Birds, Rick James, Gordon Lightfoot and Joni Mitchell, and wrote songs for the then unknown Neil Young.

In 1969, he had a life changing experience when he gave up his three pack a day smoking habit and started taking a daily cayenne pepper cocktail. He credited the concoction with turning his health around and saving his life. He later wrote the book &quot;The Cayenne Pepper Does it All&quot; to document this experience.

Kerr was considered a &quot;major promoter for Canadian Country Music artists&quot; by the 1970&#x27;s. In 1971, Kerr wrote &quot;Parliament Hill&quot; for Angus Walker who he was promoting at the time. &quot;Parliament Hill&quot; peaked at number 18 on RPM Country 50 rankings. On June 3, 1973, a group of twelve entertainers and promoters met at The Horseshoe Tavern, in Toronto, Ontario at formed the original board of directors for the Canadian Country Music Association. This group included Brent Williams, notable country and bluegrass entertainer, Jury Krytiuk, president of Boot Records, Bod Dalton, a promotor, Sean Eyre, DJ Lindsay, radio personality Harold Moon who worked for BMI Records, Jack Starr of The Horseshoe Tavern, Barry Haugen of RCA Records, Vic Folliott of Brantford Radio, Mary Butterill of CAPAC Publishing and Kerr. Kerr released &quot;Shoes Keep on Walking&quot; in the fall of 1973 and peaked at number 82 on RPM Magazine&#x27;s ranking of country music songs.

For a time, Kerr was an executive at the Toronto Harbour Commission. A fervent anti-smoking crusader, he quit the job in a rage in 1981 when a co-worker blew smoke in his face. He wrote a song, &quot;Fire on One End, a Fool on the Other&quot;, about the incident. This inspired him to run from Toronto to Los Angeles to promote a smoking ban in offices. The run took him six months. Also in 1981, Kerr released &quot;Distilled Water&quot;, a song that peaked at number 27 on RPM Magazine&#x27;s top 30 Canadian content list and number 64 on RPM Magazine&#x27;s Top 75 Country Singles He was also in the 1982 Trees music video &quot;Shock of the New&quot;, appearing as a guy with an oxygen mask and a shirt promoting clean air in offices. In 1987, he played a dead man in the basement of Casa Loma in B.D. Benedikt&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the 7th Door&quot;.

==Post-retirement==
Kerr supported himself as a busker for the remainder of his life, singing with a karaoke machine in front of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay department store at the corner of Yonge and Bloor streets. He was often voted &quot;favourite street performer&quot; in &quot;Now Magazine&quot;&#x27;s annual Toronto survey, and it is rumoured that Kerr was once offered a recording contract with Sub Pop Records. He continued to appear frequently on radio and television as an advocate for the health benefits of cayenne pepper, and was the author of &quot;The Cayenne Pepper Cocktail Does it All&quot;.

As well, he was a perennial fringe candidate who ran in every Toronto mayoral election from 1985 until 2003, the last municipal election held before his death. In 1997, he placed fourth behind Mel Lastman, Barbara Hall and Don Andrews. In the 2000 election, he ran on a platform of waterfront renewal, backed by the self-penned campaign song &quot;Fringe Candidate&quot;.

Ben Kerr died on June 17, 2005, at his home on Jones Avenue in Toronto, at the age of 75. In 2007, Toronto City Council approved a motion to name a laneway near the corner of Danforth and Jones in Kerr&#x27;s honour. Ben Kerr Lane was officially named on May 25, 2008.

<doc id="887010" wikidata="Q2803733" url="?curid=887010" title="Torreys Peak">
<text>Torreys Peak is a mountain in the Front Range region of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. It is one of 53 fourteeners in Colorado. Its nearest major city is Denver. Torreys Peak is located along the Continental Divide, as well as the division between Clear Creek County and Summit County. In the Arapaho language Torrey&#x27;s Peak and the adjacent Gray&#x27;s Peak are named, Heeniiyoowuu or &quot;Ant Hills&quot;.

==Name==
The first European to ascend Torreys Peak, botanist Charles C. Parry, named the peak for his botanist colleague John Torrey. Torrey actually did not see the peak until 1872, 11 years later (the year before his death at the age 76). It is nearly always mentioned in conjunction with nearby Grays Peak.

==Hiking==
There are three main trails used to reach the summit. The first is actually a continuation of Grays Peak Trail to the summit of Grays Peak, which starts in Stevens Gulch. See the Grays Peak article for more information on accessing that trail.

A popular and challenging variation of this trail follows class-3 Kelso Ridge. This route splits from the Grays Peak trail from the trailhead, climbs to the saddle between Torreys and Kelso Mountain, then follows the rugged ridge about to the summit.

The third trail starts at Loveland Pass about to the northwest. To reach Loveland Pass, follow I-70 west from Denver to where US Route 6 breaks off and heads south. Follow the meandering Route 6 approximately seven miles to the trailhead at Loveland Pass, at an elevation of . The steepest part of the trail actually begins right away with a half mile climb of . The trail follows the Continental Divide gently taking the climber down into three saddles and up two more peaks, including Grizzly Peak at and Mount Sniktau at . The final saddle rests at approximately 12,600 ft. From this saddle, it is a mile-long ascent of to the final summit.

Once at the summit, many opt to continue on to Grays Peak, away. The trail from Torreys Peak to Grays Peak dips down to a saddle and then climbs back up to .

<doc id="887015" wikidata="Q7750683" url="?curid=887015" title="Matrix defense">
<text>The &quot;Matrix&quot; defense is a legal defense based on the premise of the film franchise &quot;The Matrix&quot;, in which reality is a computer generation and the real world is different from what reality is popularly perceived to be.

A defendant using this defense claims that they committed a crime because they believed that they were in a simulated world (the Matrix), and not in the real world. A defendant could allege they never intended death for their victim because they believed the victim to be alive in the other reality. This is a version of the insanity defense and considered a descendant of the &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; defense of John Hinckley, one of the first defenses based on blurring reality with films.

Regardless of whether the defendant believes that they were living within a simulated world, this defense has been used in cases where the accused were sent to mental-care facilities instead of prisons:
* Tonda Lynn Ansley of Hamilton, Ohio, was found not guilty by reason of insanity using this defense after shooting her landlady in the head in July 2002.
* Vadim Mieseges of San Francisco offered a &quot;Matrix&quot; explanation to police after chopping up his landlady, and was declared mentally incompetent to stand trial.
* Joshua Cooke&#x27;s lawyers were going to attempt this defense in 2003 in his trial for the murder of his adoptive parents, before he pleaded guilty.
* The case of Lee Malvo, who participated in the sniper shootings of 30 victims in 2002, also included references to &quot;The Matrix&quot;, mentioned in the writings taken from his jail cell. Malvo reportedly shouted &quot;free yourself from the Matrix&quot; from his cell after his arrest, and told FBI agents to watch the film if they wanted to understand him.

<text>The Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park is the union of Waterton Lakes National Park in Canada and Glacier National Park in the United States. Both parks are declared Biosphere Reserves by UNESCO and their union as a World Heritage Site.

==History==
===Formation===
The union of the Waterton Lakes National Park and the Glacier National Park is attributed to a number of individuals throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Early proponents of a borderless international park include Canadian George &quot;Kootenay&quot; Brown, a long-time settler and first forest ranger-in-charge of Waterton, and American Albert Henry &quot;Death-on-the-Trail&quot; Reynolds, an early ranger of the northern portion of Glacier.

The Cardston, Alberta, and Montana Rotary Clubs played a significant role in the park&#x27;s establishment, holding a joint meeting at the Prince of Wales Hotel on July 4–5, 1931, which led to a resolution drafted by Samuel H. Middleton, calling on both groups to petition the proper authorities for the establishment of the Peace Park. An agreement was subsequently negotiated by Canadian Brigadier-General John Smith Stewart, Member of Parliament for Lethbridge, and American Congressman from Montana Scott Leavitt. The 72nd United States Congress passed &quot;An Act to establish Waterton Glacier International Peace Park&quot; on December 8, 1931, and be approved by the United States Senate in March 1932. The Canadian federal government decided to wait until after the United States government had passed a bill in order to act, and the Canadian bill was further delayed by protests of proponents of the International Peace Garden between Manitoba and North Dakota. Finally, John Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Act respecting the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park&quot; was passed by Parliament, and given royal assent on May 26, 1932.

The union of the parks was achieved through the efforts of Rotary International members from Alberta and Montana, on June 18, 1932, at Glacier Park Lodge. The dedication address was given by Sir Charles Arthur Mander, 2nd Baronet. The ceremony for the Canadian side was delayed by the Great Depression, and finally took place in July 1936, with Lieutenant Governor of Alberta William L. Walsh overseeing the ceremony and dedicating a cairn for conservation advocate Kootenay Brown.

===Later history===
The two parks are administered separately and have separate entrance fees.

In 2007, the International Dark-Sky Association named Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park the International Dark-Sky Park.

==Border crossing==
The Chief Mountain Border Crossing, reached by Montana Highway 17 from the American side and by Alberta Highway 6 from the Canadian side, is the only road border crossing within the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park. It is one of only two on the US–Canada border that are closed in winter (Poker Creek - Little Gold Creek Border Crossing is the other).

<text>Wishcraft is a 2002 American slasher film directed by Richard Wenk (credited as Danny Graves) and starring Michael Weston and Alexandra Holden. The screenplay concerns a teenager who receives a talisman that gives him three wishes.

==Plot==
A high school student named Brett Bumpers (Weston) receives a mysterious package one day. It contains a bull penis totem with a note explaining that it will grant him three wishes. His first wish is for Samantha (Alexandra Holden) to go to a spring dance with him. Samantha invites him to the dance the next day, and he suspects his wish has come true. Samantha&#x27;s boyfriend Cody is the star jock at the school, and he is humiliated by Samantha&#x27;s decision.

After the dance, one of Cody&#x27;s buddies is murdered by a cloaked figure with a grotesquely disfigured face. When Brett drops Samantha off at home, she suggests they should return to being friends. Heartbroken, Brett makes his second wish: for Samantha to become his girlfriend and actually fall in love with him. Samantha breaks up with Cody the next day and initiates a relationship with Brett. Meanwhile, the cloaked figure continues to kill students at the high school.

Feeling guilty about wishing Samantha into a relationship, Brett confesses the truth to her. As Samantha is coming to grips with the truth, the cloaked figure attacks the pair. He lures Brett away from Samantha and then reveals himself to be Brett&#x27;s history teacher, Mr. Turner (Austin Pendleton). Mr. Turner explained that he had bought the totem and discovered it granted wishes. He wished his wife dead to avoid divorcing her. Then he wished for &quot;fuck-you-money&quot;, and he promptly got $100 million, which he hid in a Swiss bank account. Mr. Turner confessed that he also wished for supernatural strength because he decided to kill problem students at the school. As he was killing the students on his list, he sent the totem to Brett because he was an exemplary student. If the totem is given to another person, that person can also make three wishes.

Mr. Turner then reveals that Samantha is the last name on his list. Just as he is about to kill Samantha, Brett makes his third wish, asking for more strength and agility than Mr. Turner. The two struggle, and eventually, Brett kills Mr. Turner with a samurai sword. Brett gives the totem to Samantha so that she is not forced to love him against her will. She uses the totem to begin their relationship again, but this time, on her terms.

==Cast==
==Reception==
Website &quot;Beyond Hollywood&quot; gave the film a positive review, stating: &quot;The film doesn’t have the Hollywood slick and gloss, but it makes up for the lack of visual polish with a surprisingly good script and an all-around good cast.&quot; &quot;Eye for Film&quot; gave &quot;Wishcraft&quot; two out of film stars, saying that only fans of the genre would enjoy the film: &quot;Perhaps dedicated fans of the genre might find some solace in the films use of the old horror clichés, but I don&#x27;t think anyone else will. Still, at least there&#x27;s plenty of suspects for you to play Guess The Psycho...&quot; Luisito Joaquín González from &quot;Slash Above&quot; also reviewed the film, concluding: &quot;Of the myriad of Scream imitators that were unleashed during the early noughties, Wishcraft is most definitely not one of the worst that you can place your hands upon. Weston and Holden make for an agreeable pairing and the film is worth seeing for maintaining an impressive pace and generating moments of unique humour. It is an ok time-waster rather than a good one and I can’t help but feel that it tries too hard to have one over on Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson.&quot;

<doc id="887038" wikidata="Q854629" url="?curid=887038" title="Kissel">
<text>Kissel or kisel is a simple dish with the consistency of a thick gel, and made of sweet fruit, berry, grains (oatmeal, rye, wheat), peas, or from milk. It belongs to the group of cold-solidified desserts, although it can be served warm. 

==Etymology==
&quot;Kissel&quot; is derived from a Slavic word meaning &#x27;sour&#x27;, after a similar old Slavic dish—a leavened flour porridge (or weak sourdough) which was made from grain, most commonly oats, but any grain, including legumes like peas or lentils could be used. Bean kissels were typically not leavened, and lacked the sweetness of the modern variants.

== History ==
Grain-based kissels were known 9000 years ago in ancient Anatolia and Mesopotamia, they are mentioned in Sumerian and Akkadian texts. In ancient times, oatmeal kissel was prepared by fermentation of oat milk.

In Russia, oatmeal, rye or wheat kissel was an everyday dish, but also a ritual one, eaten at funeral feasts. Hot oatmeal kissel was usually eaten with linseed or hemp oil. When cooled and solidified, it was cut and served with milk, jam or with fried onions.

Oat-based kissel soup is one of the characteristic national dishes of Poland (&quot;żurek&quot;) and Belarus.

In old Polish cuisine, the name &quot;kisiel&quot; or &quot;kisielica&quot; was used for thick soups (slush, , plural &quot;breje&quot;) made of fish gelatin. In French cuisine there was a similar dish known, called &quot;gelée&quot; – a berry-fruit jelly-kissel made with addition of gelatin based on fish waste. Contemporary fruit kissels are solidified with starch and the preparation prosess doesn&#x27;t require fermentation, therefore they are easier to make. In the former Russian Empire, fruit kissels appeared in late 19th century or at the beginning of 20th, when affordable potato starch became easily available. In Western European languages, fruit and berry sweet kissels based on starch do not have a common name and are attributed to &quot;fruit cereals&quot;, &quot;gravy&quot;, &quot;sautés&quot;, &quot;fruit sauces&quot; etc.

Among other dishes closely related to starch-solidified kissels are: rice pudding, flummery (British cuisine), &quot;Haferschleim&quot; (German), Lokum (Turkish), polenta (Italian) or mamalyga (Eastern-Roman).

== Fruit kissel == 
Fruit kissel is a viscous dish, popular as a dessert and as a drink in Northern, Central, and Eastern Europe. It consists of the sweetened juice (or puree) of berries. Sometimes red wine, fresh, or dried fruits are added as well. It is similar to mors, but usually thickened with cornstarch or potato starch; arrowroot may be used as a substitute as well. The thickness varies depending on how much starch is used and on temperature. Thin kissel is most easily consumed by drinking, while thicker versions are almost like jelly and eaten with a spoon. Kissel can be served either hot or cold. Can be paired with sweetened quark or cream, can also be served on pancakes or with ice cream.

It is similar to the Danish &quot;rødgrød&quot; and German &quot;Rote Grütze&quot;. Swedish &quot;blåbärssoppa&quot; is a similarly prepared bilberry dessert.

Today, most Polish households prepare fruit kissel from instant mixes instead of the traditional way. The most popular flavours are strawberry, gooseberry, and raspberry. In Russia, the most popular flavours are cranberry, cherry, and redcurrant.

In Lithuania, cranberry kissel () is a traditional meal on Kūčios (Christmas Eve supper).

In Finland, kissel is often made of bilberries (since they can often be found growing wild in forests, and are thus both easy to gather and free) as well as from prunes, apricots, strawberries, etc. Rhubarb can also be used (see #Vegetable kissel), but is often combined with strawberries to produce a sweeter flavour. (&#x27;Queen&#x27;s kissel&#x27;) is made with mixed berries and berry juices, generally bilberries and raspberries. Prune kissel () is traditionally eaten with rice pudding at Christmas.

== Vegetable kissel ==
Less common, vegetable kissel is made from boiled or baked vegetables such as rhubarb, pumpkins, or beetroot.

== Milk kissel ==
( or ; ) is a creamy pudding, similar to semolina pudding or budino. It is made from milk and potato starch (Poland) or corn starch (Finland) and flavoured with sugar and vanillin (or vanilla) or cocoa powder. It can also be enriched with the addition of butter and yolks. 

It may be eaten as a dessert, alone, or garnished with fruit syrups, sauces, jams, fresh or dried fruit, or with cookies and biscuits. 

It may also be used as an ingredient in cake creams (i.e. for karpatka or napoleonka). Most Polish households prepare milk kissel from instant mixes instead of the traditional way.

==Cultural references==
Kissel is mentioned in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, where there is a story of how it saved the city of Belgorod in Kievan Rus&#x27;, besieged by nomadic Pechenegs in 997. When the food in the city became scarce, the population followed the advice of an old man, who told them to make kissel from the remnants of grain, and a sweet drink from the last mead they could find. They filled a wooden container with the kissel, and another one with the mead drink, and put those containers into the holes in the ground, and built two fake wells over them. When the Pechenegian ambassadors came into the town, they saw how the inhabitants took the food from those &quot;wells&quot;, and the Pechenegs even were allowed to taste the kissel and mead beverage. Impressed by that show and degustation, Pechenegs decided to lift the siege and to go away, having concluded that the Ruthenians were mysteriously fed from the earth itself.

In Russian fairy tales, the land of marvels (similar to Cockaigne) is described as the land of &quot;milk rivers and kissel banks&quot;. This expression became an idiom in Russian for prosperous life or &quot;paradise on earth&quot;.

Another phrase common in Russia and Poland, &quot;the seventh water after kissel&quot; (, ), is used to describe a distant relative.

<text>Daniel Scott Lamont (February 9, 1851 – July 23, 1905) was the United States Secretary of War during Grover Cleveland&#x27;s second term.

==Early life==
Lamont was born on his family&#x27;s farm in McGraw, New York (then called McGrawville) on February 9, 1851. He was a son of John B. Lamont, a merchant from Cortlandville, and Elizabeth (née Scott) Lamont. Lamont, of Scotch ancestry, had a family lineage that could be traced back as far as 1250.

He waited on customers from behind the counter in his father&#x27;s store. He attended the Central Academy, successor of New York Central College, in McGraw. He attended Union College at Schenectady, New York. While attending Union College, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity.

==Career==
He was employed as engrossing clerk and assistant journal clerk in the state capitol at Albany, New York, was a clerk on the staff of the Democratic state central committee in 1872 and was chief clerk of the New York department of state from 1875 to 1882.

In 1883, through his mentor Daniel Manning, Lamont was assigned to then-New York Governor Grover Cleveland&#x27;s staff as a political prompter. He became private and military secretary with the honorary rank of colonel on the governor&#x27;s staff the same year and continued in his service after Cleveland became president in 1885. Lamont also held employment with William C. Whitney in his business ventures in 1889.

From March 5, 1893, to March 5, 1897, Lamont served as United States Secretary of War in President Cleveland&#x27;s cabinet. Throughout his tenure, he urged the adoption of a three-battalion infantry regiment as a part of a general modernization and strengthening of the Army. Furthermore, Lamont recommended the construction of a central hall of records to house Army archives and urged that Congress authorize the marking of important battlefields in the manner adopted for Antietam. He also recommended that lands being used by Apache prisoners at Fort Sill be acquired for their permanent use and their prisoner status be terminated.

===Later life===
After his service as Secretary of War, Lamont was vice president of the Northern Pacific Railway Company from 1898 to 1904. He was also a director of numerous banks and corporations. In 1889, he went into business with William C. Whitney (Cleveland&#x27;s Secretary of the Navy) and Oliver Hazard Payne (organizer of the American Tobacco trust).

In August 1904, he was considered as a candidate for Governor of New York, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing &quot;Qualifying experience in large public and private affairs, ability and executive capacity already demonstrated in high office, and personal character quite above all impeachment or assault unmistakably designate Daniel S. Lamont as a fit candidate for the Democrats of New York to name for the Governorship.&quot;

==Personal life==
Lamont was married to Juliet Kinney and had three surviving daughters, Frances, Elizabeth (Bessie), and Katherine. A fourth daughter, Julia, died in 1902 at 18 years old. Lamont spent his early summers in the Gray Gables neighborhood in Bourne, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, near where Grover Cleveland owned a house. Cleveland and Lamont were known to have many parties during the summers. His old house still stands. In 1888, he began spending his summers on the coast of Maine and bought a house in Sorrento known as Blueberry Lodge, which also still stands today.

Lamont died at his country home, Altamount in Millbrook, New York, on July 23, 1905, at aged 54. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, in The Bronx, New York City. After his death, his widow continued the family&#x27;s close relationship with the Clevelands.

<doc id="887041" wikidata="Q3364587" url="?curid=887041" title="Anchor baby">
<text>Anchor baby is a term (regarded by some as a pejorative) used to refer to a child born to non-citizen parents in a country that has birthright citizenship which will therefore help the parents and other family members gain legal residency or avoid deportation. In the U.S., the term is generally used as a derogatory reference to the supposed role of the child, who automatically qualifies as an American citizen under &quot;jus soli&quot; and the rights guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The term is also often used in the context of the debate over illegal immigration to the United States. A similar term, &quot;passport baby&quot;, has been used in Canada for children born through so-called &quot;maternity&quot; or &quot;birth tourism&quot;.

==History and usage==
A related term, &quot;anchor child&quot;, referring in this case to &quot;very young immigrants who will later sponsor immigration for family members who are still abroad&quot;, was used in reference to Vietnamese boat people from about 1987. In 2002 in the Irish High Court, Bill Shipsey used the term to refer to an Irish-born child whose family were his clients; in the 2003 Supreme Court judgment upholding the parents&#x27; deportation, Adrian Hardiman commented on the novelty of both the term and concomitant argument. (In Ireland &quot;jus soli&quot; citizenship was abolished in 2004.)

&quot;Anchor baby&quot; appeared in print in 1996, but remained relatively obscure until 2006, when it found new prominence amid the increased focus on the immigration debate in the United States. The term is generally considered pejorative. Analysis of news usage, internet links, and search engine rankings indicate that Fox News and Newsmax were pivotal in popularizing the term in the mid and late 2000s. In 2011 the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; added an entry for the term in the dictionary&#x27;s new edition, which did not indicate that the term was disparaging. Following a critical blog piece by Mary Giovagnoli, the director of the Immigration Policy Center, a pro-immigration research group in Washington, the dictionary updated its online definition to indicate that the term is &quot;offensive&quot;, similar to its entries on ethnic slurs. , the definition reads:

&quot;n. Offensive&quot; Used as a disparaging term for a child born to a noncitizen mother in a country that grants automatic citizenship to children born on its soil, especially when the child&#x27;s birthplace is thought to have been chosen in order to improve the mother&#x27;s or other relatives&#x27; chances of securing eventual citizenship.

The decision to revise the definition led to some criticism from immigration opponents, such as the Center for Immigration Studies and the Federation for American Immigration Reform.

In 2012, Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff, in a meeting designed to promote the 2010 Utah Compact declaration as a model for a federal government approach to immigration, said that &quot;The use of the word &#x27;anchor baby&#x27; when we&#x27;re talking about a child of God is offensive.&quot;

In 2019, The Australian Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton called the two children of the Biloela family &quot;Anchor babies&quot;.

===Maternity tourism industry===

, Los Angeles is considered the center of the maternity tourism industry, which caters mostly to wealthy Asian women; authorities in the city there closed 14 maternity tourism &quot;hotels&quot; in 2013. The industry is difficult to close down since it is not illegal for a pregnant woman to travel to the U.S.

On March 3, 2015 federal agents in Los Angeles conducted a series of raids on three &quot;multimillion-dollar birth-tourism businesses&quot; expected to produce the &quot;biggest federal criminal case ever against the booming &#x27;anchor baby&#x27; industry&quot;, according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

==== Ireland&#x27;s abolition of unconditional birthright citizenship ====
In 2005, Ireland amended its constitution to become the last country in Europe to abolish unconditional &quot;jus soli&quot; citizenship, as a direct result of concerns over birth tourism. A headline case was Chen v Home Secretary, whereby a Chinese temporary migrant living in mainland United Kingdom travelled to Belfast, Northern Ireland to give birth to her daughter for the purpose of obtaining Irish citizenship for her daughter (Ireland&#x27;s &quot;jus soli&quot; law extends to all parts of the island of Ireland, including Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK). The daughter&#x27;s Irish citizenship was then used by her parents to obtain permanent residence in the UK as the parents of a dependent EU citizen.

==Immigration status (United States)==
The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution indicates that &quot;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&quot; The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed in &quot;United States v. Wong Kim Ark&quot;, , that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizenship for nearly all individuals born in the United States, provided that their parents are foreign citizens, have permanent domicile status in the United States, and are engaging in business in the United States except performing in a diplomatic or official capacity of a foreign power.

Most constitutional scholars agree that the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides birthright citizenship even to those born in the United States to illegal immigrants. Edward Erler, writing for the Claremont Institute in 2007, said that since the &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; case dealt with someone whose parents were in the United States legally, it provides no valid basis under the 14th Amendment for the practice of granting citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. He goes on to argue that if governmental permission for parental entry is a necessary requirement for bestowal of birthright citizenship, then children of undocumented immigrants must surely be excluded from citizenship.

However, in &quot;Plyler v. Doe&quot;, , a case involving educational entitlements for children in the United States unlawfully, Justice Brennan, writing for a five-to-four majority, held that such persons were subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and thus protected by its laws. In a footnote, he observed, &quot;no plausible distinction with respect to Fourteenth Amendment &#x27;jurisdiction&#x27; can be drawn between resident immigrants whose entry into the United States was lawful, and resident immigrants whose entry was unlawful.&quot; In 2006 judge James Chiun-Yue Ho, who President Donald Trump would later appoint to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, wrote in a law review article that with the &quot;Plyler&quot; decision &quot;any doubt was put to rest&quot; whether the 1898 &quot;Wong Kim Ark&quot; decision applied to illegal aliens because &quot;&quot;all nine justices agreed&quot; that the Equal Protection Clause protects legal and illegal aliens alike. And all nine reached that conclusion precisely because illegal aliens are &#x27;subject to the jurisdiction&#x27; of the U.S., no less than legal aliens and U.S. citizens.&quot;

Statistics show that a significant, and rising, number of undocumented immigrants are having children in the United States, but there is mixed evidence that acquiring citizenship for the parents is their goal. According to PolitiFact, the immigration benefits of having a child born in the United States are limited. Citizen children cannot sponsor parents for entry into the country until they are 21 years of age, and if the parent had ever been in the country illegally, they would have to show they had left and not returned for at least ten years; however, pregnant and nursing mothers could receive food vouchers through the federal WIC (Women, Infants and Children) program and enroll the children in Medicaid.

Parents of citizen children who have been in the country for ten years or more can also apply for relief from deportation, though only 4,000 persons a year can receive relief status; as such, according to PolitFact, having a child in order to gain citizenship for the parents is &quot;an extremely long-term, and uncertain, process.&quot; Approximately 88,000 legal-resident parents of US citizen children were deported in the 2000s, most for minor criminal convictions.

==Incidence==
Some critics of illegal immigration claim the United States&#x27; &quot;birthright citizenship&quot; is an incentive for illegal immigration, and that immigrants come to the country to give birth specifically so that their child will be an American citizen. The majority of children of illegal immigrants in the United States are citizens, and the number has risen. According to a Pew Hispanic Center report, an estimated 73% of children of illegal immigrants were citizens in 2008, up from 63% in 2003. A total of 3.8 million illegal immigrants had at least one child who is an American citizen. In investigating a claim by U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, PolitiFact found mixed evidence to support the idea that citizenship was the motivating factor. PolitiFact concludes that &quot;[t]he data suggests that the motivator for illegal immigrants is the search for work and a better economic standing over the long term, not quickie citizenship for U.S.-born babies.&quot;

There has been a growing trend, especially amongst Asian and African visitors from Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Taiwan and Nigeria to the United States, to make use of &quot;Birth Hotels&quot; to secure US citizenship for their child and leave open the possibility of future immigration by the parents to the United States. Pregnant women typically spend around $20,000 to stay in the facilities during their final months of pregnancy and an additional month to recuperate and await their new baby&#x27;s U.S. passport. In some cases, the birth of a Canadian or American child to mainland Chinese parents is a means to circumvent the one-child policy in China; Hong Kong and the Northern Mariana Islands were also popular destinations before more restrictive local regulation impeded traffic. Some prospective mothers misrepresent their intentions of coming to the United States, a violation of U.S. immigration law and as of January 24, 2020 it became U.S. consular policy to deny B visa applications from applicants whom the consular officer has reason to believe are traveling for the primary purpose of giving birth in the United States to obtain U.S. citizenship for their child.

==Controversies==

On August 17, 2006, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Eric Zorn used the term &quot;anchor baby&quot; in reference to Saul Arellano, in a column critical of his mother, who had been given sanctuary at a Chicago church after evading a deportation order. After receiving two complaints, the next day Eric Zorn stated in his defense in his Chicago Tribune blog that the term had appeared in newspaper stories since 1997, &quot;usually softened by quotations as in my column&quot;, and stated that he regretted having used the term in his column and promised not to use it again in the future.

On August 23, 2007, the San Diego, California-area &quot;North County Times&quot; came under criticism from one of its former columnists, Raoul Lowery Contreras, in a column titled &quot;&#x27;Anchor babies&#x27; is hate speech&quot;, for allowing the term &quot;anchor baby&quot; to be printed in letters and opinion pieces.

On April 15, 2014, during a televised immigration debate with San Antonio, Texas, Mayor Julian Castro, then Texas State Senator Dan Patrick came under criticism when he used the term &quot;anchor babies&quot; while describing his own view of some of the immigration issues the state of Texas faced.

On November 14, 2014, CNN Anchor Chris Cuomo used the term on New Day: &quot;Breaking overnight, President Obama has a plan to overhaul the immigration system on his own — an executive order on anchor babies entitling millions to stay in the U.S. Republicans say this would be war. Is the word &#x27;shutdown&#x27; actually being used already?&quot; Chris Cuomo later apologized for the comment saying, &quot;OK, now, do they? Because let&#x27;s think through what this issue actually is on the other side of it. This issue is called the &#x27;anchor babies.&#x27; I used that term this morning. I shouldn&#x27;t have. It&#x27;s ugly and it&#x27;s offensive to what it is. What it really goes to is the root of the most destructive part of our current immigration policy, you&#x27;re splitting up families. They come here, here illegally, they have a baby, and the family gets split up. Maybe the kid stays. We don&#x27;t have a workable formation. This goes to the heart of the Latino vote because it shows a real lack of sympathy. You have to come up with some kind of fix. So why avoid this one? Don&#x27;t you have to take it on?&quot;

In Australia in 2019, then-Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton used &quot;anchor babies&quot; to label the two Australian-born children of the Murugappan asylum seeker family. This comment was criticised by University of Sydney law professor Dr. Vogl, who pointed out that unlike the United States, Australia does not have birthright citizenship, so the term &quot;anchor baby&quot; is not relevant to Australian law. Opposition politician Kristina Keneally, herself born in the United States, labelled the comment as an attempt to import American debates that were not relevant to Australia.

<text>Embassy Row is the informal name for a section of Northwest Washington, D.C., with a high concentration of embassies, diplomatic missions, and diplomatic residences. It spans Massachusetts Avenue N.W. between 18th and 35th street, bounded by Scott Circle to the south and the United States Naval Observatory to the north; the term is often applied to nearby streets and neighborhoods that also host diplomatic buildings, such as Kalorama. 

Of the 177 diplomatic missions in the city, the majority are located on or near Embassy Row, including those of Italy, Australia, India, Greece, Egypt, Ireland, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Due to the large number of well-preserved Gilded Age estates and townhouses, many of which house diplomatic missions or dignitaries, Embassy Row has been protected as part of the Massachusetts Avenue Historic District. Its historic and multicultural character has also made the area a center of tourism and local cultural life.

==History==
Considered Washington&#x27;s premier residential address in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Massachusetts Avenue became known for its numerous mansions housing the city&#x27;s social and political elites. Consequently, the segment between Scott Circle and Sheridan Circle gained the nickname &quot;Millionaires&#x27; Row&quot;.

The Great Depression of 1929 led many to sell their homes; the often illustrious and expansive estates were well-suited for housing diplomatic missions as well as lodges of social clubs, giving Embassy Row its present name and identity. The relocation to Embassy Row of diplomatic representations, many of which had been established in Meridian Hill in previous decades, was further catalyzed by the construction of the British Embassy, commissioned in 1925 and completed in 1930, and the Japanese Embassy, built in 1931. The greatest number of embassies and chanceries moved to Embassy Row and the neighboring Kalorama neighborhood in the 1940s and early 1950s.

On the southeastern section of the row, between Scott Circle and Dupont Circle, many individual houses and mansions were replaced by larger office or apartment buildings between the 1930s and the 1970s. More recently, several prominent think tanks have clustered in that area, which has occasionally been referred to as Think Tank Row.

Many of Embassy Row&#x27;s diplomatic buildings open to the public once a year in May, an initiative nicknamed Passport DC. This event was started in 2007 by the embassies of member states of the European Union, and extended in 2008 to other countries around the world under coordination by Cultural Tourism DC. Within this program, the EU embassies still open on a separate day, labelled EU Open House. A separate program, the Embassy Series, started in 1994 and coordinates concerts organized in the embassy buildings.

Embassy Row is protected as the Massachusetts Avenue Historic District, created in 1974 following controversy about the demolition of historic townhouses on 1722-28 Massachusetts Ave NW. Many of its notable buildings are listed in the DC Inventory of Historic Sites. Because few historic buildings remain on Scott Circle, the eastern boundary of the Historic District was set on 17th Street NW, but, since three embassies are located there and none farther east, Scott Circle is included in this article&#x27;s definition of Embassy Row. The Western boundary used here is identical to that of the Historic District, namely Observatory Circle. However, some (e.g. real estate professionals) describe Embassy Row as extending as far west as Wisconsin Avenue NW.

==Statuary==

The monumental setting of the Row has favored the erection of many memorials and statues. They are erected either on private grounds, many of them by the embassies to showcase a prominent national figure, or on public (federal) land following an Act of Congress, including the successive Circles and several triangular parks created by the intersections between the diagonal avenue and the L&#x27;Enfant Plan grid. A special case is the statue of Winston Churchill, which has one foot on the grounds of the British Embassy and the other on federal land to symbolize the UK-US alliance.

== Other embassies in Washington, D.C. ==

In the immediate vicinity of Embassy Row, many other embassies and diplomatic residences are located within one or two blocks of Massachusetts Avenue on cross streets, particularly R, S, and 22nd Streets NW near Sheridan Circle, and in the Kalorama neighborhood north of Embassy Row. The section of New Hampshire Avenue NW north of Dupont Circle alone is home to the embassies of Argentina, Belarus, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Eswatini, Grenada, Jamaica, Montenegro, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe.

In the early days of Washington, D.C., most diplomats and ambassadors lived on or around Lafayette Square. The first purpose-designed embassy building in Washington was the embassy of the United Kingdom on 1300 Connecticut Avenue, immediately south of Embassy Row, built in 1872 by Sir Edward Thornton on John Fraser&#x27;s design, and demolished in 1931. Thornton&#x27;s choice of location, at a time when Dupont Circle was still almost entirely undeveloped, may be considered the origin of Embassy Row as a diplomatic neighborhood.

In the first three decades of the 20th century, several European legations gathered farther northeast, on a section of 16th Street near Meridian Hill Park. This area was specifically developed by local resident Mary Foote Henderson to attract embassies, and she even aimed at having the residences of the U.S. president and vice-president relocated there. However, the neighborhood was hit hard by the Great Depression, and Embassy Row became a comparatively more attractive location for diplomats in the following decade. Former embassy buildings in the Meridian Hill area include those of France (arch. George Oakley Totten Jr., 1907, now the Council for Professional Recognition); Mexico (arch. Nathan C. Wyeth, 1911, now the Mexican Cultural Institute); the Netherlands (arch. George Oakley Totten Jr., 1922, now the Embassy of Ecuador); Spain (arch. George Oakley Totten Jr., 1923 and addition by Jules Henri de Sibour, 1927; now the Spain-USA Foundation); Egypt (arch. George Oakley Totten Jr., 1924, now Meridian Hall); Italy (arch. Warren and Wetmore, 1925, currently under redevelopment); and Brazil (arch. George Oakley Totten Jr., 1927, later embassy of Hungary and now the Josephine Butler Parks Center). The embassies of Cuba (arch. Macneil &amp; Macneil, 1918), Lithuania (arch. George Oakley Totten Jr., 1909), and Poland (arch. George Oakley Totten Jr., 1910) are still located in the Meridian Hill neighborhood. A bit further up 16th Street, the Embassy Building No. 10, built in the late 1920s, never actually served as an embassy despite being designed as one.

A high-security enclave in Van Ness, one mile north of the Naval Observatory on the federally owned former grounds of the National Bureau of Standards in Cleveland Park, was developed from 1968 as the International Chancery Center. It is home to the embassies of Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Morocco, Monaco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, Slovakia, and the United Arab Emirates.

A number of other embassies are scattered south of Massachusetts Avenue and closer to the National Mall, notably those of Canada, Mexico, Spain, Saudi Arabia, and the European Union. Still others are located in or around Georgetown, such as those of France, Germany, Russia, Sweden, Thailand, Ukraine, and Venezuela. The Caribbean Chancery on 3216 New Mexico Avenue NW hosts the embassies of four English-speaking Caribbean nations.

<doc id="887053" wikidata="Q5179879" url="?curid=887053" title="Cox Communications">
<text>Cox Communications, Inc. (also known as Cox Cable and formerly Cox Broadcasting Corporation, Dimension Cable Services and [[Times-Mirror]] Cable), is an American digital cable television provider, telecommunications and home automation services. It is the third-largest cable television provider in the United States, serving approximately 6.5 million customers, including 2.9 million digital cable subscribers, 3.5 million Internet subscribers, and almost 3.2 million digital telephone subscribers, making it the seventh-largest telephone carrier in the country. Cox is headquartered at 6205 Peachtree Dunwoody Rd in Sandy Springs, Georgia, U.S., in the Atlanta metropolitan area. It is a privately owned subsidiary of Cox Enterprises.

==History==

Cox Enterprises expanded into the cable television industry in 1962 by purchasing a number of cable systems in Lewistown, Lock Haven and Tyrone (all in Pennsylvania), followed by systems in California, Oregon and Washington. The subsidiary company, Cox Broadcasting Corporation (unrelated to the Cox Media Group, which focuses on radio stations and television stations), was not officially formed until 1964, when it was established as a public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The company was renamed to Cox Communications in 1982. It was taken private by Cox Enterprises in 1985.

In 1993, Cox began offering telecommunication services to businesses it was the first multiple system cable operator to do so. This eventually grew into Cox Business, which now represents $1 billion in annual revenue. In 1995, Cox acquired the Times-Mirror cable properties and as a result became a publicly traded company once again.

In 1997, Cox became the first multiple system cable operator to offer phone services to customers following the 1996 Telecom Act. Two years later in 1999, Cox acquired the cable television assets of Media General in Fairfax County and Fredericksburg, Virginia. The following year, Cox Communications acquired Multimedia Cablevision with assets in Kansas, Oklahoma and North Carolina.

In 2004, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors found Cox Communications guilty of violating an agreement with the county which stated that all homes served by Cox within Fairfax County would be digital ready with the new fiber optic network by June 2003. When this term expired with less than 30% of the county having been completed, the Board of Supervisors decided to fine Cox $100 per day from the originally agreed completion date, until work was completed in January 2006. The Board also forbade Cox from raising rates to recover the cost of the fine for a period of 10 years from the actual completion date. The total fine was approximately $93,000. Also in 2004, Cox Communications announced plans to take the company private once again, expressing frustration in the shareholder&#x27;s emphasis on short-term goals. The company was taken private for the second time in 2005.
By November 1, 2005, Cox announced the sale of all of its Texas, Missouri, Mississippi and North Carolina properties, as well as some systems in Arkansas, California, Louisiana and Oklahoma to Cebridge Communications. The sale closed in 2006 and those systems were transitioned by their new owner from Cox branding to Suddenlink Communications.

On May 14, 2007, Cox announced that they had sold their investment in Discovery Communications for the Travel Channel, related assets, and $1.3 billion.

In 2007, DiversityInc magazine named Cox Communications #25 in its Top 50 Companies for Diversity. Cox climbed to the sixth position on Diversity Inc.&#x27;s 2008 list. Also in 2008, Cox was named #8 on the Top 10 Companies for African Americans. Two years later, on November 19, 2010, Cox began offering wireless services in Orange County, California; Omaha, Nebraska; and, in Hampton Roads, Virginia.

In February 2011, Cox Communications completed its Alternative Energy Project which included two fuel cell installations at each of the company&#x27;s San Diego, CA and Rancho Santa Margarita, CA headquarters. Two separate PureCell System 400 kilowatt installations will generate enough onsite power to reduce the company&#x27;s dependence of the local power grid and decrease its carbon footprint.

In September 2011, Cox Home Security was added to their suite of products listed on their website. This new service uses advanced technologies similar to the home security products offered by other MSOs such as Comcast.

In August 2013, Cox launched a new television platform known as Contour, which features recommendations and a user profile system across multiple devices. In 2015, Cox licensed Comcast&#x27;s Xfinity X1 platform (which features more extensive integration of video streaming apps, and a voice control remote); it was deployed in 2016, maintaining the Contour naming. Cox stated that at least 1 million subscribers were on the X1-based Contour as of October 2017.

In 2016, Cox Business reached 3 billion in annual revenue.

In February 2023, it was announced Cox had acquired the New York-headquartered managed cloud services company, Logicworks for an undisclosed sum.

==Other business units==
*Cox Business: Provides business level video, voice and Internet services.
*Cox Media: Advertising sales
*Travel Media, Inc. (Sold): Travel Channel and TravelChannel.com (35%; joint venture with Scripps Networks).

== Cox Charities ==
Cox Communications Virginia created the philanthropic Cox Charities to annually provide grants to nonprofits serving youth. The organizations must have education programs that focus on science and technology, literacy, mentoring and other areas. In the 2016-2017 program, 15 nonprofits received a total of $150,000. They were:
* An Achievable Dream
* ForKids
* Horizons Hampton Roads
* REACH
* The Salvation Army - Hampton Roads Area Command
* The UP Center
* Virginia Peninsula Foodbank
* Educacion Para Nuestro Futuro
* Main Street Child Development Center
* Hopecam
* Fairfax Futures
* Literary Council of Northern Virginia
* Boys and Girls Clubs of Southwest Virginia
* Child Health Investment Partnership of Roanoke Valley
* Total Action for Progress

Other state branches of Cox Communications also donate money annually through a Community Investment Grant program. The money comes from employees and goes to 501(c)(3) organizations. The organizations will differ from state to state, and year to year, but usually also have a focus on education, technology, social issues, and the arts. These programs can be found in Oklahoma (nearly $165,000 in 2017), Arkansas (nearly $100,000 in 2017), Nebraska and Iowa (nearly $90,000 in 2017), and the Southeast region, including parts of Louisiana, Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast, Central Florida and Middle Georgia.

==Privatization==
In 2004, Cox Enterprises announced its intention to purchase those shares of Cox Communications which it did not already own. A $6.6 billion tender offer was completed in December of that year, and Cox Communications has been a wholly owned subsidiary ever since. This was the second time Cox Communications was taken private by Cox Enterprises.

==Residential services==

===Cox Cable TV===
Cox distributes standard definition and high-definition cable television programming, including Digital Cable. Cox launched Digital Cable on its Orange County system in 1997. In February 2008, Cox started to implement switched digital video (SDV) technology in some of their markets. In late 2014, Cox started notifying customers in their Connecticut market that they would be moving to an All Digital Video platform, requiring a small digital adapter (termed a &quot;Cox Mini-Box&quot;) for televisions that were previously connected to an analog only signal.
This same notification was extended to all other major markets in 2016.

====Digital video recorder====
Cox offers digital video recorder service, provided using Motorola, Scientific-Atlanta, Cisco, or previously Moxi equipment depending on the local market.

====On Demand====
Cox offers video on demand service in the majority of its markets under the name &quot;On Demand&quot;. On Demand offerings are fairly standardized, portal-based, and carry VODnets like The Ski Channel, and includes HD offerings and replays of major network series.

===Cox High Speed Internet===
As of 2013, Cox offers cable internet service to over 21.8 million people across 18 states, making it the 4th largest provider of cable internet service in the US (based on coverage area).

Cox offers five levels of high-speed Internet in all of its markets: Starter (10 Mbit/s download/1 Mbit/s upload), Essential (50 Mbit/s download/3 Mbit/s upload), Preferred (150 Mbit/s download/10 Mbit/s upload), Ultimate (300/500 Mbit/s download/10 Mbit/s upload), and Gigablast (900 Mbit/s download/35 Mbit/s upload via coax and 1000 Mbit/s download/1000 Mbit/s upload via fiber). In certain markets they also offer two financial assist plans one being Straight Up, and the other Connect 2 Compete. Cox initially launched high-speed Internet in 1996 in its Orange County infrastructure. Cox licensed the PowerBoost technology from Comcast in 2007 and offers it on the Preferred, Premier, and Ultimate levels of service. Top service download speeds are between 15 and 300 Mbit/s.

* &quot;Soft&quot; monthly bandwidth caps are listed for all four levels of service, and Cox does charge a considerable fee for exceeding data usage limits. 
* In September 2011, Cox announced the availability of a data usage meter for customers to check their data usage.
* In 2011, the FCC released the &quot;Measuring Broadband America&quot; report where it was revealed that many broadband providers provided lower than advertised internet speeds to their consumers. Analysis of the report data showed that Cox Cable only delivered 83.4% of its advertised internet speed (on speeds above 3 Mbit/s) to its customers. 
* Cox blocks incoming traffic on port 80 for residential customers, making it difficult for them to run web servers.

Cox High Speed Internet won the PC Magazine Readers&#x27; Choice Award for High Speed Internet in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, and 2011. In 2014, Cox announced they would begin offering 1 Gbit/s internet speeds under the name &quot;G1GABLAST&quot; in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Omaha, with plans to begin offering it in the rest of their service areas by the end of 2016. They also announced that they would double internet speeds for all customers at no cost at the same time. They began rolling out the new speeds in Phoenix in early October of the same year.

In fall 2016, Cox first launched its Panoramic WiFi service in San Diego, Orange County and Santa Barbara, and it became available nationwide on June 13, 2017.

===Cox Digital Telephone===
Cox offers telephone service in the majority of its services areas. Various technologies, including circuit switched and hybrid VoIP systems, are used depending on service areas. Cox has won multiple J.D. Power and Associates awards for its telephone service.

=== Cox Homelife ===
In 2010 Cox started offering a range of Home Automation and Security service to customers in its Tucson, Arizona market as a trial. In 2011, this product was expanded to Cox&#x27;s entire Arizona market, and was rolled out to additional markets over the next couple of years; it was then renamed as Cox Homelife in all markets. In December 2014, Cox Launched Cox Homelife in Louisiana.

===Cox Business===
Cox Business provides voice, data and video services for more than 260,000 small and regional businesses, including health care providers, K-12 and higher education, financial institutions and federal, state and local government organizations. According to Vertical Systems Group, Cox Business is the fourth-largest provider of business Ethernet services in the U.S.-based on customer ports and the company ranked highest among small and mid-size business data service providers in J.D. Power and Associates telecommunications studies in 2006, 2008 and 2010. In 2013, Cox Business had the third largest business-facing enterprise by revenue (of cable providers who provide business services), with $1.2 billion in revenue as of the third quarter of 2013.

Cox Business is an early adopter of Voice over IP technology and, in 2007, Cox became the first cable provider in North America to deploy a fully owned and managed IP telephony service for businesses, Cox Business VoiceManager. Cox Business is expected to launch Managed IP PBX, SIP Trunking and IP Centrex services in 2011, allowing customers to more efficiently route voice traffic over Internet Protocol. Cox Business currently supports more than 800,000 business phone lines.

===Defunct Cox Wireless===
Cox previously offered mobile phone and wireless services in four United States markets including Orange County, California, Hampton Roads, Virginia, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Omaha, Nebraska. Cox marketed their wireless service as &#x27;Unbelievably Fair&#x27; due to a wireless plan it offered which returned money for unused minutes which it called &quot;Moneyback Minutes.&quot; This allowed customers to receive up to $20 per month added back to their bill in the event that the customer had leftover minutes. Cox Wireless offered a full range of devices manufactured by Motorola, Samsung, HTC, Kyocera, and LG.

Cox Wireless utilized Sprint&#x27;s voice and 3G networks and also had planned to build out their own 4G LTE network.

On May 24, 2011, Cox Communications announced it would decommission its plans to build a 3G wireless network, and would instead offer Sprint service to half of its current footprint and operate as a Sprint MVNO by the end of 2011.

On November 15, 2011, Cox Communications announced it would halt sales of all its wireless branded products and existing Cox branded wireless operations would be decommissioned by March 30, 2012. Cox eventually also retracted its plans to offer wireless services reselling Sprint service as an MVNO.

==Carriage controversies==

=== News Corporation Dispute===
On January 1, 2000, Cox was involved in a retransmission consent dispute with News Corporation (the parent company of the Fox broadcast network, now owned by Fox Corporation), pulling four Fox owned-and-operated stations, after retransmission consent talks between News Corp. and Cox broke down, reportedly because Fox had denied permission for Cox to broadcast programming on its O&amp;O stations unless Cox gave it two channel slots on its digital cable service. The affected stations were WJW-TV in Cleveland, Ohio (now owned by Nexstar Media Group), KTBC in Austin, Texas, KRIV in Houston, Texas, and KDFW in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, off its cable systems in those areas; another Fox O&amp;O WHBQ-TV in Memphis (itself now owned by Imagicomm Communications) was also pulled from its Jonesboro, Arkansas, system (of the mentioned systems; only the Cleveland metropolitan area continues to be served by Cox; the Texas systems were later bought out by Time Warner Cable (now Spectrum) and Comcast; the Jonesboro system was sold to Suddenlink Communications in May 2006). The removal of those stations, which were temporarily replaced with premium service Starz! Family (which was made available to subscribers for free), blacked out Fox programming to 425,000 Cox customers. The blackout lasted six days as the two sides came to an agreement on January 6, and the Fox-owned stations were brought back to the systems. Cox gave $1 refunds of their January cable bill to roughly 90,000 subscribers in Texas and Arkansas as compensation.

===LIN TV-Cox dispute===
In a separate dispute (clumped with the above dispute by media outlets as the &quot;Cox vs Fox&quot; dispute) that occurred around the same time, customers in Hampton Roads, Virginia lost access to LIN TV-owned Fox affiliate WVBT (channel 43) on January 1, 2000; retransmission talks between WVBT and Cox broke down, reportedly due to a demand by WVBT to be placed somewhere between channels 2 and 14 (it had been broadcast on channel 43). Cox refused to move WVBT to a lower channel number; the channel space was filled in the interim by pay channel HBO Family. It was not until February 5 of that year that the station resumed on Cox&#x27;s Hampton Roads system (remaining on channel 43), after an agreement was reached during a ten-hour arbitration session. Cox did not offer rebates to its 335,000 subscribers in Fairfax County, Virginia, and Cleveland, Ohio, who also lost their Fox stations.

=== Nexstar dispute ===
On January 29, 2016, seventeen Nexstar Broadcasting stations were dropped by Cox after failing to reach a new retransmission deal. The contract had expired on December 31, 2015, but the two companies allowed talks to continue until January 22, 2016. The channels were replaced by a screen which accused Nexstar of &quot;demanding a significant fee increase&quot;. In Las Vegas, where the dispute threatened to black out Super Bowl 50 due to local CBS station KLAS-TV being affected by the dispute, Cox announced on February 3, 2016, that it would offer a free preview of the game&#x27;s Spanish-language broadcaster, ESPN Deportes, over Super Bowl weekend. The next day, Cox reached a new deal with Nexstar, and the stations were restored.

=== Neighborhood-wide speed decreases ===
In 2020, Cox lowered the upstream bitrates of entire neighborhoods from 35 Mbit/s to 10 Mbit/s, because they determined that individual users within the neighborhoods had excessive usage.

==Copyright lawsuits==

=== BMG Rights Management ===
On December 17, 2015, Cox was held responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers according to a ruling from a federal jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The ISP was found guilty of willful contributory copyright infringement and ordered to pay music publisher BMG $25 million in damages. This verdict was reaffirmed by the judge on August 8, 2016. On February 14, 2017, Cox was ordered to additionally pay $8.5 million in costs. On November 7, 2016, Cox appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and on February 1, 2018, the court overturned the $25 million verdict due to erroneous jury instructions but upheld its loss of safe harbor protections due to not having a meaningful repeat infringer policy. On August 27, 2018, before the case was scheduled to be tried for a second time, both parties agreed to a confidential settlement.

=== Sony Music, et al. ===
On July 31, 2018, a billion dollar lawsuit was filed against Cox in the same court, before the same judge that handled the BMG case, by 53 record labels, including Sony, Universal, and Warner Brothers. On December 19, 2019, the jury ruled against Cox and awarded $1 billion to the record labels. On June 2, 2020, the judge ruled the jury&#x27;s verdict is not excessive but also ruled that damages should be issued per work, not per copyright, as a single song, such as a mashup, may have multiple copyrights. However, on January 12, 2021, the court backtracked on this point because Cox did not raise it during the jury trial, and thus upheld the $1 billion verdict. The case was appealed to the Fourth Circuit on May 24, 2021. While pending, Cox filed an additional motion for relief with the district court on December 27, 2021, alleging concealed evidence that came to light in a separate lawsuit by the record labels against Charter. This motion was denied on March 23, 2022. A ruling on the appeal to the Fourth Circuit is pending.

==Marketing==
One of Cox&#x27;s marketing trademarks is a fictional animated &quot;spokesman&quot; character named &quot;Digital Max&quot;, used from 2005 through 2008. The phasing out of Digital Max in 2008 was followed by the introduction of the &quot;Digeez&quot;, little digital helpmates featured in many of Cox Communications&#x27; brand commercials until 2013. In 2023, Cox Mobile introduced a CGI sheep named Annie.

<text>Thomas William Lamont Jr. (September 30, 1870 – February 2, 1948) was an American banker.

== Early life ==
Lamont was born in Claverack, New York. His parents were Thomas Lamont, a Methodist minister, and Caroline Deuel Jayne. Since his father was a minister, they moved around Upstate New York a lot and they were not very wealthy. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1888, where he was editor of the school newspaper, &quot;The Exonian&quot;, as well as the school yearbook and literary magazine. He then attended Harvard College.

==Early career ==
At Harvard, he became first freshman editor of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;, which helped him pay off some of his tuition. He graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1892. He met his wife, Florence Haskell Corliss, at the 1890 Harvard commencement. He started working under the city editor for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; two days after he graduated from Harvard in 1892. He married Florence on October 31, 1895 in Englewood, New Jersey.

He also worked for the &quot;Albany Evening Journal&quot;, &quot;Boston Advertiser&quot;, &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, and &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, which paid only $25, while he was at Harvard.

At the &quot;Tribune&quot;, he received many promotions, including night editor and helping the financial editor, which gave him his first taste of the financial world. He left journalism because of the low pay and went into business.

He began working in business for Cushman Bros., which later became Lamont, Corliss, and Company, and turned it into a successful importing and marketing firm. It was an advertising agency that worked for food corporations. The company was in a bad financial status, but Lamont fixed it, and the company changed its name to Lamont, Corliss, and Company. He was partners with his brother-in-law, Corliss. His banking caught the attention of banker Henry P. Davison, who asked Thomas to join the new Bankers Trust. He started as secretary and treasurer and then moved up to being Vice President and then was promoted to director. He rose to the vice presidency of the First National Bank.

He was a member of the Jekyll Island Club on Jekyll Island, Georgia.

In 1918, he purchased the New York Evening Post, of which his brother, Hammond, had been managing editor a decade earlier, from Oswald Garrison Villard. After failing to make a profit, he sold the paper in January, 1922 to a syndicate that was headed by the paper&#x27;s editor, Edwin F. Gay.

== J. P. Morgan ==
On January 1, 1911, he became a partner of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., following Davison to the company.

===World War I===
The company had also started an improvised system so that the Allies could buy supplies from them. In 1917, he joined the Liberty Loan Committee, which helped the treasury sell war bonds to Americans. He also served unofficially as an advisor to a mission to the Allies, led by Edward M. House, as requested by President Woodrow Wilson.

Lamont not only advised the other countries but also went to them. Right before he was going to go to Europe, the Bolsheviks took power in Russia. He and the head of the American Red Cross, William B. Thompson, along with the approval of the British prime minister, Lloyd George, tried to convince America to aid the Bolsheviks so that Russia would stay in the war. However, they were unsuccessful.

===Peace negotiations===
Both he and Norman H. Davis were appointed as representatives of the Treasury Department to the Paris Peace Conference and had to determine what Germany had to pay in reparations. He participated in the committees that drew up the 1924 Dawes Plan and the 1929 Young Plan to reduce the amount paid by Germany.

===Influence===
In the interwar period, he was a spokesman for J.P. Morgan because J.P. Morgan Jr. was retiring. He handled the press and defended the firm during hearings like those of Arsene Pujo that investigated powerful Wall Street bankers.

He was one of the most important agents for the Morgan investments abroad. A member of the Council of Foreign Relations, he was an unofficial advisor to the Wilson, Herbert Hoover, and Franklin Roosevelt administrations. Hoover contacted Lamont about his proposal for a debt repayment moratorium in the 1931 financial crisis. This also has important implications for later events such as his 1932 election campaign. Lamont was elected to both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1932.

===Japan===
Lamont later undertook a semiofficial mission to Japan in 1920 to protect American financial issues in Asia. However, he did not aggressively challenge Japanese efforts to build a sphere of influence in Manchuria; indeed, he supported Japan&#x27;s non-militaristic politics until late into the 1930s.

Ron Chernow won the National Book Award for his book &quot;The House of Morgan&quot; in which he claimed that Lamont had authored the infamous Japanese response to deceive the world about the Mukden incident, which was used as a pretext for Japan&#x27;s invasion of Manchuria. That defied the expressed position of US government and the League of Nations that Japan, not China, was the aggressor.

===Mexico===
Lamont was the chairman of the International Committee of Bankers on Mexico for which he successfully negotiated the De la Huerta-Lamont Treaty. He continued to chair the committee into the 1940s by a series of renegotiations of Mexico&#x27;s foreign debt.

===Italy===
In 1926, Lamont, self-described as &quot;something like a missionary&quot; for Italian fascism, secured a $100 million loan for Benito Mussolini. Despite his early support, Lamont believed the Second Italo-Abyssinian War begun in 1935 was outrageous.

On September 20, 1940, the fascist police shocked Lamont by arresting Giovanni Fummi, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.&#x27;s leading representative in Italy. Lamont worked to secure Fummi&#x27;s release. Fummi was released on October 1 and went to Switzerland.

===Wall Street crash===
On Black Thursday in 1929, Lamont was acting head of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.
Five days prior to the Crash, President Herbert Hoover had contacted Lamont with concerns about the rampant market manipulation by Wall Street insiders, and the systemic risk it presented to the stock market. Lamont reassured the President that there was no cause for concern, and no need for government intervention, saying &quot;The future appears brilliant!&quot;

The market crashed the following Thursday. In an attempt to stop the panic, Lamont organized Wall Street firms to inject confidence back into the stock market through massive purchases of blue chip stocks. The effort failed, and stocks ultimately lost a quarter of their value that week. After the crash unfolded, the Senate Banking Committee found that J.P. Morgan (headed by Lamont), had maintained a &quot;preferential stock list&quot;, to allow for liquidation of stocks during the crash at prices premium to actual market value. Politicians, including Calvin Coolidge, and family members of prominent bankers, were on the list.
=== As chairman ===
Following the reorganization of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. in 1943, Lamont was elected chairman of the board of directors, after Morgan Jr. died, becoming the first non Morgan after George Peabody to chair the bank.

==Charitable work==
Lamont became a generous benefactor of Harvard and Exeter once he had amassed a fortune, notably by funding the building of Lamont Library. At the end of World War II, Lamont made a very substantial donation toward restoring Canterbury Cathedral in England. His widow, Florence Haskell Corliss donated Torrey Cliff, their weekend residence overlooking the Hudson River in Palisades, New York, to Columbia University. It is now the site of the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory.

Upon Florence&#x27;s death, a bequest established the Lamont Poetry Prize.
== Death ==
Lamont died in Boca Grande, Florida, in 1948.

==Personal life==
In 1895, Lamont married Florence Haskell Corliss. Born Englewood, NJ in 1873, Florence graduated from Smith College in 1893 and received an M.A. in Philosophy from Columbia University. Thomas and Florence had 4 children. Their son Corliss was a philosophy professor at Columbia University and an avowed socialist. Another son, Thomas Stilwell Lamont, was later vice-chairman of Morgan Guaranty Trust and a fellow of the Harvard Corporation.

One of his grandsons, Lansing Lamont, was a reporter with &quot;Time&quot; from 1961 to 1974. He published several books, including &quot;You Must Remember This: A Reporter’s Odyssey from Camelot to Glasnost&quot; about his experiences covering the important events of the time, including the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Another grandson, Thomas William Lamont II, served in the submarine service on the and died when the submarine sank in April 1945.

One of his great-grandsons, Ned Lamont, was elected governor of Connecticut in 2018.

==In popular culture==
Lamont is a major character in Nomi Prins&#x27; novel &quot;Black Tuesday&quot; (2011) and in Kit Holland&#x27;s &quot;Soul Slip Peak&quot; (2013).

<text>Donner Pass is a mountain pass in the northern Sierra Nevada, above Donner Lake and Donner Memorial State Park about west of Truckee, California. Like the Sierra Nevada themselves, the pass has a steep approach from the east and a gradual approach from the west.

The pass has been used by the California Trail, First transcontinental railroad, Overland Route, Lincoln Highway and Victory Highway (both later U.S. Route 40 and still later Donner Pass Road), as well as indirectly by Interstate 80. The pass gets its name from the ill-fated Donner Party who overwintered there in 1846.

Today the area is home to a thriving recreational community with several alpine lakes and ski resorts (Donner Ski Ranch, Boreal, and Sugar Bowl). The permanent communities in the area include Kingvale and Soda Springs, as well as the larger community below the pass surrounding Donner Lake.

==History==
To reach California from the east, pioneers had to get their wagons over the Sierra Nevada mountain range. In 1844 the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party followed the Truckee River into the mountains. At the head of what is now called Donner Lake, they found a low notch in the mountains and became the first overland settlers to use the pass. The pass was named after a later group of California-bound settlers. In early November 1846 the Donner Party found the route blocked by snow and was forced to spend the winter on the east side of the mountains. Of the 81 settlers, only 45 survived to reach California; some of them resorting to cannibalism to survive.

On January 13, 1952, 222 passengers and crew aboard a train became stranded about west of Donner Pass at Yuba Pass, on Track #1 adjacent to Tunnel 35 (on Track #2), at about MP 176.5. Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s passenger train &quot;City of San Francisco&quot; was en route westbound through the gap when a blizzard dumped so much snow the train was unable to move forward or reverse. The passengers and crew were stranded for three days until the nearby highway could be plowed sufficiently for a caravan of automobiles to carry them the few miles to Nyack Lodge.

==Central Pacific Railroad==

In the spring of 1868, the Sierra Nevada were finally overcome by the Central Pacific Railroad (CPRR), after almost three years of sustained drilling and blasting through granite, with the successful completion at Donner Pass of its 1,659-foot (506 m) Tunnel #6 (a.k.a. the Summit Tunnel) and associated grade, thus permitting the establishment of commercial transportation &quot;en masse&quot; of passengers and freight over the Sierra for the first time. Following a route first surveyed and proposed by CPRR&#x27;s original Chief Engineer, Theodore D. Judah (1826–1863), the construction of the four tunnels, several miles of snowsheds, and a hand-crafted stone retaining wall 75-foot tall (a.k.a. Chinese or China Wall in recognition of the Chinese builders) necessary to breach Donner Summit constituted the most difficult engineering and construction challenge of the original Sacramento–Ogden CPRR route.


Principally designed and built under the personal, often on-site direction of CPRR&#x27;s Chief Assistant Engineer, Lewis M. Clement (1837–1914), the original (Track 1) summit grade remained in daily use from June 18, 1868, when the first CPRR passenger train ran through the Summit Tunnel, until 1993 when the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) (which operated the CPRR-built Oakland-Ogden line until its 1996 merger with the Union Pacific Railroad (UP)) abandoned the 6.7 mile (10.7 km) section of Track #1 over the summit running between the Norden complex (Shed 26, MP 192.1) and the covered crossovers in Shed #47 (MP 198.8), one mile east of the old flyover at Eder. All traffic has since operated over the Track #2 grade crossing the summit south of Donner Pass through the -long Tunnel #41 running under Mount Judah between Soda Springs and Eder. SP made this change because the railroad considered Track 2 and Tunnel 41 (which was opened in 1925 when the summit section of the grade was finally double tracked) to be easier and less expensive to maintain during the harsh Sierra winters than the Track 1 tunnels and snow sheds over the summit.

In conjunction with major ongoing upgrades and expansions being made to the Port of Oakland in order to better accommodate the rapidly growing North American trade with Asia and the Pacific, the cooperation of UP, the Port&#x27;s principal rail partner, has been sought to &quot;construct a second track and raise tunnel clearances over Donner Pass for container trains linking California with the rest of the country.&quot; This would likely require either a new parallel tunnel next to Tunnel 41 or the replacement of the summit section of Track 1 between the Norden complex and Shed 47; either would increase capacity and effectively eliminate delays currently caused by having to run all east and west bound traffic between Norden and Shed 47 over a single track. (To eliminate bottleneck delays the now single track section between Switch 9 (MP 171.9) at Emigrant Gap and Shed 10 (MP 179.0) west of Cisco would likely also have to be restored to double track.) Improvements were completed on the Sierra grade in November 2009, including increasing of tunnel clearances in 15 restricted tunnels between Rocklin and Truckee and upgrading of signals to CTC, although the original Donner Pass grade (Track 1) was not restored. Since then trains of full-height or , double-stack container cars have run over Donner Pass; some tunnels on Track 2 between Bowman and Colfax were not enlarged, so stack trains in both directions must use the older, tunnel-free Track 1 between those points.
==Highways==
The Lincoln Highway, the first road across America, crosses Donner Pass; this was also a part of the Victory Highway. Interstate 80 was built through this area in the early 1960s. I-80 generally parallels the route of US 40 through the Sierra Nevada, but it crosses the Sierra crest at the Euer Saddle, about north of Donner Pass. Euer Saddle, along with a nearby park on the south side of the freeway, are commonly called &quot;Donner Summit&quot; by the state of California. At () Donner Summit is about higher than Donner Pass, but is wider and has a gentler approach that aided construction to Interstate Highway standards, which do not allow the sharp curves used by the Donner Pass Road. The grade is 3–6% for . The 1920s highway has been preserved as a scenic alternative to I-80.

==Weather==
Winter weather at Donner Pass can be brutal. Precipitation averages per year, and because California has a Mediterranean climate wherein most precipitation falls in the winter, much of it falls as snow. At an average of per year, Donner Pass is one of the snowiest places in the contiguous United States. Four times since 1880 total snowfall at Donner Summit has exceeded and topped in both 1938 and 1952. To take advantage of the heavy snows, the Boreal Ski Resort was built to the north. Ski resorts in the Lake Tahoe area report an average of of snowfall per season. Winds in the pass can also become extreme and wind gusts in excess of are common during winter storms. Winter temperatures in the area drop below several times each year; the all-time record low for California of was recorded at Boca (east of Truckee) in January 1937.

The winter of 1846–47 was especially severe, contributing immensely to the disaster of the Donner Party.
==Recreation==
Sporting activities in the area include backpacking, alpine and cross-country skiing, rock and ice climbing. The original tunnel built by Central Pacific Railroad is home to a large amount of tagging. The region was featured during the early 1990s in snowboarding films by Fall Line Films (FLF) and Standard Films for its easy access to frontcountry and backcountry terrain. However, its fame and quick access from Old Highway 40 or nearby Sugar Bowl Ski Resort has led to a large number of avalanche fatalities, including that of professional snowboarder Jamil Khan.

==Popular culture==
The 1994 western-comedy film &quot;Wagons East&quot; features John Candy as James Harlow, the disgraced former wagon master for the Donner Party.

Albert Bierstadt&#x27;s painting &quot;View of Donner Lake&quot; (1871–72) shows the view of the titular lake from the vicinity of the pass.

Jack Torrance tells his family the story of the Donner Party while driving through the pass in &quot;The Shining.&quot;

Donner Pass is featured in the History Channel special episode, &quot;&quot;: &quot;Westward&quot;. It is also featured in the National Geographic Channel series &quot;Hell on the Highway&quot;, which focuses on the towing and recovery companies working the region.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Lamy (; October 11, 1814 – February 13, 1888), was a French-American Roman Catholic prelate who served as the first Archbishop of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Willa Cather&#x27;s novel &quot;Death Comes for the Archbishop&quot; is based on his life and career (albeit renamed to &quot;Jean-Marie Latour&quot; for artistic license), as is Paul Horgan&#x27;s nonfiction work &quot;Lamy of Santa Fe&quot;. He sometimes anglicised his name to John Baptist Lamy.

== Early life ==

Lamy was born in Lempdes, Puy-de-Dôme, in the Auvergne region of France, 10 km east of the main regional city of Clermont-Ferrand. He completed his classical studies in the minor seminary at Clermont and theological coursework in the Major seminary at Montferrand, where he was trained by the Sulpician Fathers (Society of Saint-Sulpice).

== Career ==

He was ordained a priest on December 22, 1838. After a few months as an assistant priest in his native diocese, in 1839 Lamy asked for and obtained permission to answer the call for missionaries of Bishop John Baptist Purcell, of Cincinnati, Ohio. From 1839 to 1847 he served as the primary missionary priest for Danville in Knox County, Ohio, establishing that town&#x27;s first Catholic church as well as that of Mount Vernon, Ohio.

== Episcopacy ==

While serving as a missionary in North America, serving at several missions in Ohio and Kentucky, on July 23, 1850 he was notified that Pope Pius IX was appointing him as bishop of the recently created Apostolic Vicariate of New Mexico, created as a result of the outcome of the Mexican American War, which created a need for the American Catholic Church to replace prelates and leadership previously provided by the Church in Mexico. At the same time, he was appointed Titular Bishop of Agathonice. He was consecrated a bishop on November 24, 1850 by Archbishop Martin Spalding of Louisville; Bishops Jacques-Maurice De Saint Palais of Vincennes and Louis Amadeus Rappe of Cleveland served as co-consecrators.

After an arduous journey on primitive transportation, Lamy reached Santa Fe in the summer of 1851. As such, Lamy was joining a long list of French people who explored, traded and settled in New Mexico since the 16th century; specifically, French priests dominated New Mexico’s Catholic Church from 1841 to 1914.

Lamy entered Santa Fe on 9 August 1851, and was welcomed by the Governor of the territory, James S. Calhoun, and many other citizens. However, Juan Felipe Ortiz, a Spanish priest who was responsible for administration of the Catholic Church in New Mexico, told Lamy that he and the local clergy did not recognize his authority and would remain loyal to Bishop José Antonio Laureano de Zubiría of the Diocese of Durango, Mexico, who had visited Santa Fe just a few months before. Lamy wrote to Zubiría asking him to explain the change of responsibility to the New Mexico priests. When his request was unanswered, he went in person to Durango to meet with Zubiría, showing him the papal document that appointed Lamy. In light of this, Zubiría had to agree to inform the priests of the change.

On July 23, 1853, the Vicariate of New Mexico was raised to the Diocese of Santa Fe, and Lamy was appointed its first bishop. 
His early efforts as bishop were directed to reforming the New Mexico church, the building of more churches in the territory, the creation of new parishes, and the establishment of schools. He ended the practice of concubinage widely practiced by the local priests and he suppressed religious brotherhood societies within individual communities. He participated in the First Vatican Council from 1869-1870.
Joseph Projectus Machebeuf served as his vicar-general.
Lamy was responsible for the construction of the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi (commonly known as St. Francis Cathedral) and Loretto Chapel. Both churches were built in French styles familiar to Lamy — the Cathedral is Romanesque Revival, while the Chapel is Neo-Gothic. On February 12, 1875, the Diocese of Santa Fe was elevated to an archdiocese with Lamy as its first archbishop. On May 1, 1885, Lamy consecrated Peter Bourgade as bishop; Bourgade would later become the fourth Archbishop of Santa Fe.

Lamy ended his tenure as bishop when he resigned in 1885. He was appointed Titular Archbishop of Cyzicus later that year.

== Death and legacies ==

He died of pneumonia in 1888 and is buried under the sanctuary floor of the basilica. A bronze statue, dedicated in 1915, stands in his memory outside the front entrance of the Basilica, and the village of Lamy, New Mexico, was named after him near the source of the sandstone for the Cathedral.

Lamy was succeeded as Archbishop of Santa Fe by Jean-Baptiste Salpointe, also from Puy-de-Dôme, France.

The Archbishop Lamy&#x27;s Chapel in Santa Fe, built in 1874, survives and is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

Willa Cather&#x27;s novel &quot;Death Comes for the Archbishop&quot; fictionalizes his life, missionary journeys, and erection of the Santa Fe cathedral.

<text>Stewart Graeme Guthrie, GC (22 November 1948 – 13 November 1990) was a New Zealand Police sergeant and a recipient of the George Cross, then the highest award in the British Commonwealth for conspicuous gallantry not in the face of an enemy. He received the award for his role in the police response to the Aramoana massacre, during which he lost his life.

==Aramoana massacre==
Guthrie, a New Zealand Police sergeant in the Armed Offenders Squad, was sole duty officer at Port Chalmers police station on 13 November 1990 when he received a report that a man was firing a weapon indiscriminately at Aramoana, a small seaside township 8 km north-east of Port Chalmers.

Guthrie immediately went to the town and liaised with Police Constable Russell Anderson, who had arrived separately with the fire brigade. New Zealand police are generally unarmed, but because of the serious nature Guthrie had brought a police Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 revolver and armed Anderson with a rifle belonging to a local resident, before trying to apprehend the gunman. By this time, Guthrie had learned the gunman had killed several people.

Guthrie knew the gunman, David Gray, and located him inside his house. Guthrie instructed the constable to cover the front of the house, while he took the more dangerous position at the rear of the property. During this time, Guthrie had kept his control fully informed of the latest situation. Tapes of radio conversations between him and other police who arrived at the scene revealed that he was doing his utmost to minimise the danger to his colleagues.

Gray left his house by the front entrance and went towards Anderson, but retreated through his house when challenged. Guthrie meanwhile had taken cover behind a sand dune, at the rear of a crib next-door to Gray&#x27;s. He was lying with revolver in one hand and police radio in the other, and transmitted when he encountered Gray coming out of the rear of his house. Guthrie challenged the gunman, &quot;Stop, David, or I shoot&quot;, and fired a warning shot into the air. The gunman responded by firing a series of shots, one of which struck Guthrie in the head, killing him. In all, the gunman killed thirteen people and seriously wounded two, before Special Tactics Group police shot him dead the next day. 

==Funeral==
The funeral for Guthrie was held at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 19 November 1990, with full police honours. Around 2,000 people, including 700 police officers, attended. The service and final blessing were given by the Anglican Bishop of Dunedin, the Rt Rev Dr Penny Jamieson, and he received the naval honour of the piping the side, followed by a private cremation.

==Citation==
The citation for Guthrie&#x27;s George Cross was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 18 February 1992, reading:

<text>The Jamestown Jammers were a minor league baseball team based in Jamestown, New York from 1994 until 2014. The team was the Short-Season A classification affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates and played in the New York–Penn League. The team played all of their home games at Russell Diethrick Park.

On August 25, 2014, a week before the end of the 2014 season, it was announced that the team would cease operations in Jamestown and be relocated to Morgantown, West Virginia, beginning in 2015. That year, the club, which is owned by Bob Rich, Jr., began play at Monongalia County Ballpark, as the West Virginia Black Bears.

The Jamestown Jammers intellectual property is separate from the franchise and survived after the minor league franchise relocated. From 2015 to 2018, the Jammers name was used for collegiate summer baseball teams.

==History==

===New York–Penn League===

====Niagara Falls Rapids====
The team was previously based in Niagara Falls, New York as the Niagara Falls Rapids, a Detroit Tigers affiliate. Their home stadium in Niagara Falls was Sal Maglie Stadium. The team played in Niagara Falls from 1989 to 1993.

The team was preceded in Jamestown by the Jamestown Falcons (initially known as the Jamestown Jaguars) and the Jamestown Expos. The Expos had played in Jamestown up until the 1993 season, when the team moved to Vermont and became known as the Vermont Lake Monsters.

In 1994, immediately following the Expos&#x27; departure, the Rapids moved to Jamestown and assumed the name &quot;Jamestown Jammers.&quot; The Jamestown Expos had left the city after the 1993 season, relocating to Vermont. The new team was named the &quot;Jammers&quot; after a fan vote, with the winning name beating out others such as the All-Americans, Furniture Makers, Jimmies, Lakers, Lucys, Muskies and Steamers. The team&#x27;s logo was a Tasmanian devil-esque character. The mascot was a similar character named J.J. Jammer.

In the off-season before the 2006 season, in an attempt to put an end once and for all to the &quot;what is a Jammer?&quot; questions, the Jammers changed their logo to a cartoon grape theme. The new logo represents the strong tradition of grape-growing in Chautauqua County. On June 19, 2006, the eve of opening day, the team officially announced the name of its new mascot: Bubba Grape, the Baseball Ape.

After a decade of affiliation with the Florida/Miami Marlins, the Jammers signed a player development contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 18, 2012.

Although Rich also owns the Buffalo Bisons, a higher-level minor league baseball team in the same media market, he never affiliated the two teams with the same parent club during the Jammers&#x27; time in Jamestown, and as a result, the two teams have always been in separate farm systems.

====Relocation to Morgantown====
Published reports released in March 2013 (and reiterated in August 2014) indicated that the Jammers were the leading candidate for relocation after the league announced it would be relocating one of its franchises to the campus of West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia in 2015. The team&#x27;s new name, the West Virginia Black Bears, was selected shortly after the Jammers&#x27; last game.

Rich, who will continue to own the team, confirmed the news in a press conference on August 25, 2014, as did officials from the city of Jamestown, who indicated that the New York–Penn League had been trying to get out of Jamestown for several years. The league had been in the city continuously since 1960 and intermittently since the league&#x27;s launch in 1939, long after nearby cities such as Bradford, Olean and Wellsville had lost their pro teams; it was one of only two of the league&#x27;s charter cities still with a team, and the other, Batavia, returned its franchise to the league after the 2017 season. Most of the remaining teams in upstate New York below the AAA level are slated for shutdown in 2020. Rich Baseball still had one year remaining on its lease with Diethrick Park, and it is unknown how the team fulfilled the terms of the lease. Attendance declines were a major factor in the team&#x27;s departure; while in 2009, the team was still drawing close to the league average in attendance, the team averaged less than 800 fans per game in 2014 and had lost half of its attendance in the past five years (this may have also been a result of the fans knowing the team was leaving). The other factor in the team&#x27;s departure was the decrepitude of Russell Diethrick Park; other teams in the league were refusing to use the facilities there, and the attendance declines made it impossible to fund upgrades that the city and other entities that used the ballpark also refused to finance.

==Later use of the Jamestown Jammers name in baseball==
Another team bearing the Jamestown Jammers name played in the Prospect League, an amateur collegiate summer baseball league, in 2015. A new Jammers team began play in 2016 as a member of the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League. That team was abruptly shut down after the 2018 season when its owners shifted its focus to teams closer to its home base in Milwaukee, leaving behind the Jammers name for the next ownership group that wants to set up a team in Jamestown.

The nonprofit holding company entrusted with the Jammers intellectual property did not anticipate being able to field a team in 2019 and intended to rejoin the PGCBL in 2020 at the time of the closure. As of April 2019, this timetable remained unchanged. (This would be postponed again to 2021 due to prohibitions on large gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York (state) that did not allow the 2020 season to be played.) In a surprise October 2019 announcement, the new Jamestown baseball team announced it was abandoning the Jammers name and would be soliciting suggestions for a new brand. The new brand, Jamestown Tarp Skunks, was revealed in January 2020.

==Season records==

* – The Jammers and Batavia Muckdogs finished in a virtual tie for first place in the Pinckney Division in the 2008 season; however, the Muckdogs played two fewer games, finishing at 46–28 to the Jammers&#x27; 47–29. The Muckdogs&#x27; .622 winning percentage gave them the division title over the Jammers&#x27; .618.

<text>Soddo (autonym &quot;kəstane&quot; &quot;Christian&quot;; formerly called &quot;Aymälläl&quot; in Western sources, after a particular dialect of it) is a Gurage language spoken by a quarter million people in southeastern Ethiopia. It is an Ethiopian Semitic language of the Northern Gurage subfamily. Its native speakers, the Soddo Gurage people (Kistane), live predominantly in the Soddo district of the Gurage Zone.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
* [ʔ] is mainly heard when in between vowels, or in syllable-initial position before vowels.
* Sounds /p, pʼ, tsʼ/ can also be heard in borrowed words.
* Sounds /k, ɡ, kʼ/ can also have labialized allophones [kʷ, ɡʷ, kʼʷ].
* /b/ can also be heard as a voiced fricative [β] when in intervocalic position.
* /m/ can be heard as [ɱ] when before /f/, and /n/ as [ŋ] when before /k/.

=== Vowels ===
==Grammar==
===Noun===
As in most Ethiopian languages, noun qualifiers generally follow the noun.

The definite article is expressed by the suffix &quot;-i&quot;, e.g.: &quot;goš&quot; &quot;boy&quot; &gt; &quot;goš-i&quot; &quot;the boy&quot;; &quot;ätit&quot; &quot;sister&quot; &gt; &quot;ätiti&quot; &quot;the sister&quot;; &quot;bayyočč&quot; &quot;children&quot; &gt; &quot;bayyočč-i&quot;. If the noun ends in &quot;-a&quot; or &quot;-ä&quot;, it normally loses this vowel when &quot;-i&quot; is suffixed: &quot;angačča&quot; &quot;cat&quot; &gt; &quot;angačč-i&quot; &quot;the cat&quot;. A noun ending in &quot;-i&quot; usually stays the same: &quot;abi&quot; &quot;(the) father, proprietor&quot;. A noun ending in &quot;-e, -o, -u&quot; adds a &quot;y&quot; before the suffix: &quot;ge&quot; &quot;house&quot; &gt; &quot;geʸi&quot; &quot;the house&quot;; &quot;wälläho&quot; &quot;neighbor&quot; &gt; &quot;wällähoʸi&quot; &quot;the neighbor&quot;. If the noun has a qualifier, the article is used with the first element: &quot;maläk&#x27; ge&quot; &quot;big house&quot; &gt; &quot;maläk&#x27;-i ge&quot; &quot;the big house&quot;; &quot;yä-šum-i ge&quot; &quot;the house of the official&quot; (lit. &quot;of-official-the house&quot;); &quot;yä-mät&#x27;t&#x27;-i məss&quot; &quot;the man who came&quot; (lit. &quot;who-came-the man&quot;.)

There is no real indefinite article, though indefiniteness can be expressed by preposing the word &quot;attə&quot; or &quot;k&#x27;una&quot;, meaning &quot;one&quot;.

Nouns have two genders, masculine and feminine, which affect verb concord.

Nouns which are definite objects (direct or indirect) are both marked with the prefix &quot;yä-&quot; or &quot;nä-&quot;: e.g. &quot;yä-geʸi ažžo&quot; &quot;he saw the house&quot;; &quot;yä-zämmihʷan abännət&quot; &quot;he gave it to his brother&quot; (lit. &quot;to-his-brother he-gave-him&quot;). Direct objects may additionally be marked by adding the object suffix pronouns to the verb: e.g. &quot;yabiddi täšakkunnət&quot; &quot;I asked my father&quot; (lit. &quot;my-father-obj. I-asked-him&quot;.)

A possessed noun is marked by the prefix &quot;yä-&quot;, and the possessor precedes the possessed: &quot;yä-šum-i ge&quot; &quot;the house of the official&quot; (lit. &quot;of-official-the house&quot;). If the possessed noun has a preposition prefixed to it, this &quot;yä-&quot; is omitted: &quot;babiddi färäz&quot; rather than *&quot;bä-yä-abiddi färäz&quot; for &quot;on my father&#x27;s horse&quot;.

===Pronoun===

====Personal pronoun====
Possessives can also be formed by simply adding &quot;yä-&quot; to the standalone pronouns, e.g.: &quot;yädähəm t&#x27;əb&quot; &quot;your clan&quot;.

Reflexive pronouns are formed by &quot;äras-&quot;, &quot;gubba-&quot;, &quot;k&#x27;um-&quot; plus the possessive suffixes, e.g. &quot;ädi äras-əddi mät&#x27;afi t&#x27;afkunnət&quot; &quot;I myself wrote the book&quot;.

===Demonstrative pronoun===

Proximal: &quot;zi&quot; &quot;this, these&quot;; &quot;zini&quot; &quot;this one&quot;. E.g.: &quot;zi məss&quot; &quot;this man&quot;, &quot;zi məšt&quot; &quot;this woman&quot;, &quot;zi säbočč&quot; &quot;these men&quot;.

Distal: &quot;za&quot; &quot;that, those, that one, those ones&quot;; &quot;zani&quot; &quot;that one there&quot;. E.g. &quot;tä-za məss goy mät&#x27;t&#x27;ahi&quot; &quot;I came with that man&quot;.

====Interrogative pronoun====

*&quot;ma&quot; &quot;who?&quot; (&quot;man&quot; before the copula): &quot;man mät&#x27;t&#x27;a?&quot; &quot;who came?&quot;
*&quot;yäma&quot; &quot;whose?&quot;
* &quot;mən&quot; &quot;what?&quot;; &quot;yämən&quot; &quot;why?&quot;
* &quot;yitta&quot;, &quot;yittat&quot; &quot;which?&quot; E.g. &quot;yitta bayy mät&#x27;t&#x27;am&quot; &quot;which child came?&quot;
* &quot;yittani&quot; &quot;which one?&quot;

====Indefinite pronoun====

* &quot;(yähonä) säb&quot; &quot;someone, somebody&quot;
* &quot;mannəm (säb)&quot; &quot;any(one)&quot; (&quot;no one&quot; with negative verb)
* &quot;attəm&quot; &quot;any&quot; (=&quot;no one, nothing&quot; with negative verb); &quot;attəmu&quot; &quot;no one&quot; (as pronoun)
* &quot;lela (säb)&quot; &quot;other&quot;
* &quot;yäk&#x27;irrä k&#x27;äy&quot; &quot;other&quot; (lit. &quot;remaining thing&quot;)
* &quot;attə&quot; &quot;a certain&quot;
* &quot;ləyyu&quot; &quot;different&quot;
* &quot;k&#x27;una&quot;, &quot;zam&quot;, &quot;zəč&#x27;ə&quot; &quot;same&quot;
* &quot;äbälo&quot; (f. &quot;äbälit&quot;) &quot;so-and-so&quot;
* &quot;zihom&quot; &quot;such&quot;

&quot;kulləm&quot; = &quot;all&quot; (placed before or after the noun); &quot;kulləm-u&quot;, &quot;bä-mollaw&quot; = &quot;whole&quot;. &quot;yät&#x27;oma&quot; = &quot;only, alone&quot;. &quot;Each, every&quot; is expressed by noun reduplication.

===Copula and existential verbs===

The copula (positive and negative) is irregular in the present tense:

Example: &quot;zämmidi nähä&quot; &quot;you are my brother&quot;.

The past tense (&quot;he was&quot;, etc.) is expressed by the verb &quot;näbbär&quot; conjugated regularly in the perfect; &quot;he was not&quot; etc. is with &quot;annäbär&quot;. The future tense is expressed by the imperfect of &quot;hono&quot;: &quot;yəhonu&quot; &quot;he will be&quot;, etc. The negative future tense is likewise expressed by &quot;tihon&quot;. The present copula in subordinate clauses is expressed by the subordinate perfect of &quot;honä&quot;, e.g.: &quot;däffär yähonä tädi-goy yalfu&quot; &quot;he who is courageous will go with me.

&quot;It is he&quot;, etc. can be expressed by adding an element &quot;-tt&quot; between the pronoun and the copula: e.g. &quot;kʷa-ttə-n&quot; &quot;it is he&quot;.

The existential verb &quot;be at&quot;, &quot;exist&quot; in the present is:

In the past and future, it is expressed just like the copula, with &quot;näbbärä&quot; and &quot;honä&quot;. In subordinate clauses the present is expressed with &quot;-allä&quot; conjugated in the perfect (negative &quot;-lellä&quot;), e.g.: &quot;bämeda yalləmi säbočč araš näm&quot; &quot;the people who are in the field are farmers&quot;.

The possessive verb &quot;he has&quot; etc. is expressed with the existential verb &quot;yino&quot; &quot;it is&quot; (agreeing with the object possessed) plus object suffix pronouns (i.e. &quot;it is to him&quot; etc.)

===Verbs===
A Soddo verb may have anywhere from one to four consonants, or may be a compound with &quot;balo&quot; &quot;say&quot; (e.g. &quot;bək&#x27;k&#x27; balo&quot; &quot;appear&quot;.) In the former case, they fall into three &quot;conjugations&quot; differing in their vowels and in gemination of the imperfect, illustrated for a three-consonant verb:
* &quot;säbbäro&quot;, imperfect &quot;yəsäbru&quot; (&quot;break&quot;)
* &quot;tikkälo&quot;, imperfect &quot;yətikkəlu&quot;
* &quot;č&#x27;affäro&quot;, imperfect &quot;yəč&#x27;affəru&quot;

Derived stems can be formed in several ways:
* reduplicative: e.g. &quot;gäddälo&quot; &quot;kill&quot; &gt; &quot;gədaddälo&quot;. This form has a wide variety of meanings, mostly intensifying the verb in some way.
* passive/reflexive/intransitive &quot;tä-&quot; prefix: e.g. &quot;käffälo&quot; &quot;pay&quot; &gt; &quot;tä-käffälo&quot; &quot;be paid&quot;. A reciprocal action can be expressed by this prefix attached to a transitive verb with the vowel &quot;a&quot; after the first radical, or a reduplicative form, e.g. &quot;tä-gäddäl-mun&quot; or &quot;tä-gdaddäl-mun&quot; &quot;they killed each other&quot;.
* causative or transitive of intransitive verbs &quot;a-&quot;: e.g. &quot;säkkäro&quot; &quot;be drunk&quot; &gt; &quot;a-säkkäro&quot; &quot;get someone drunk&quot;; &quot;näddädo&quot; &quot;burn (intr.)&quot; &gt; &quot;a-näddädo&quot; &quot;burn (tr.)&quot;.
* causative of transitive or passive verbs &quot;at-&quot; (+ &quot;-i-&quot;): e.g. &quot;käddäno&quot; &quot;cover&quot; &gt; &quot;at-kiddäno&quot; &quot;cause to cover&quot; or &quot;cause to be covered&quot;. Added to the &quot;-a-&quot; form, it expresses reciprocity and adjutative (helping): &quot;atgaddälo&quot; &quot;cause to kill one other&quot; or help to kill&quot;.
* Some verbs are formed with initial &quot;ən-&quot; or &quot;tän-&quot;; the only derived stem from these is the &quot;a-&quot; stem, with &quot;a-&quot; replacing &quot;ə-&quot; or &quot;tä-&quot;. E.g. &quot;ənkrättäto&quot; &quot;be bent&quot; &gt; &quot;ankrättäto&quot; &quot;bend&quot;.

There are two tenses/aspects, perfective (past) and imperfective (non-past); each has distinct forms for main versus subordinate clauses, and positive versus negative. There are also distinct jussive, imperative, and impersonal forms.

====Conjugations====

=====Perfect=====
The form with suffixed &quot;-m&quot; is used in subordinate clauses to connect verbs not otherwise connected, in a way analogous to Japanese &quot;-te&quot;; it can be translated as &quot;and&quot;, as a gerund, or as a resultative. The perfect in &quot;-m&quot; followed by &quot;näbbär&quot; forms the pluperfect.

The negative perfect is formed by prefixing &quot;al-&quot;, with vowel change; for the conjugations mentioned above, the resulting forms are &quot;al-säfärä&quot;, &quot;al-täkkälä&quot;, and &quot;al-č&#x27;afärä&quot;.

Examples: &quot;ge aräššo&quot; &quot;he built a house&quot;; &quot;banätäw k&#x27;ən awänna-m bämida tonnaw&quot; &quot;having put butter on the top of his head, he sat outside&quot;.

=====Imperfect=====
Like the perfect, the subordinate forms can take the suffix &quot;-m&quot; to express a series of non-past actions. This can be combined with &quot;näbbär&quot; to express a habitual past action.

Examples: &quot;ahoññ gäbäya nalfu&quot; &quot;today we shall go to the market&quot;; &quot;yəgädəl məss&quot; &quot;the man who kills&quot;; &quot;mas tənäsa-m yibara wawt&#x27;a tək&#x27;ärsi&quot; &quot;she picks up the sleeping mats and begins to remove the dung.&quot;

It can be augmented by &quot;-ən&quot;, with no obvious change in meaning.

Examples: &quot;ahoññ yəmät&#x27;a timäsəl&quot; &quot;it does not seem that he will come today&quot;; &quot;ädahʷan t-aykäfəl alläfo&quot; &quot;he left without paying his debt&quot;.

=====Jussive and Imperative=====
These are negated by the prefix &quot;ay-&quot;: &quot;ayəsfär&quot;, &quot;ayšäkkət&quot;, &quot;aygalb&quot;. The 2nd person forms then change to conform to the others: &quot;attəsfär&quot;, &quot;attəsfer&quot;, &quot;attəsfärəm&quot;, &quot;attəsfärma&quot;.

E.g.:
: &quot;let him take according to his work&quot;
: &quot;don&#x27;t touch someone&#x27;s property&quot;
: &quot;rest and sit down&quot; (sit down quietly)

<text>Paul Smith (born September 4, 1953) is an American comic book artist, known for his work on &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;, &quot;X-Factor&quot;, &quot;American Flagg!&quot;, &quot;Nexus&quot;, &quot;GrimJack&quot; and his creator-owned book, &quot;Leave It to Chance&quot;.

During his 1983 run on &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;, Smith&#x27;s work on issue 173 of that series would prove influential in two ways: It featured the debut of the punk look for the X-Men leader Storm, and Smith&#x27;s cover of that issue would influence both a latter comic book cover and a best-selling poster and retailer standee by artist Arthur Adams.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Kansas City, Missouri, but only lived there three days. His father was a U.S. Naval aviator, and the family moved several times during his childhood. As a young comics fan, Smith particularly admired the work of Steve Ditko on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and Neal Adams on &quot;Batman&quot;.

==Career==
Smith had no formal art training aside from some courses in airbrushing. He began his career as an animation artist on Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In the early 1980s, he filled in on a variety of Marvel Comics titles, including &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; #4, cover dated September 1982, doing the final chapter of an X-Men story. He became the regular artist on &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; starting with issue #56, cover dated December 1982, but left after just two issues so that he could work on &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;.
Marvel entered into an agreement with Smith for him to take over the art duties from Dave Cockrum on &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;, then the biggest selling US comics series, for one year. Smith had emigrated to the East Coast with dreams of drawing Spider-Man and Conan, and realized that his performance on &quot;X-Men&quot; would determine the future of his career. During his run on the series, which lasted from issue #165 – #175, he designed the punk look, complete with black leather outfit and mohawk, for the X-Men leader Storm that debuted in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #173 (October 1983). The change in appearance was inspired by the decision of colleague Walt Simonson to shave off his beard and mustache while on vacation with his wife, &quot;X-Men&quot; editor Louise Simonson. Upon their return, Simonson&#x27;s daughter, Julie, upset at her father&#x27;s new appearance, ran from the room, a reaction that would be mirrored in X-Man Kitty Pryde&#x27;s reaction to Storm&#x27;s new appearance. When the book&#x27;s editors decided to change Storm&#x27;s appearance, Smith submitted a number of designs to them, explaining in a 2008 interview:

I did a number of portraits, all quite lovely and feminine. As a joke, I included a shot of her as Mr. T. You know, the kind of shot where they HAVE to go the other way. Weezie [&quot;X-Men&quot; editor Louise Simonson]&#x27;s response? &#x27;They’re going to hang us whichever way we go. Let&#x27;s commit the murder.&#x27; I argued it was a joke and a monstrously bad idea but, given my departure following 175 was set prior to beginning my run, my vote didn’t count. So I did what I could with what I had left... So we went with the Mohawk ...But once you get into the whole leather and stud thing it was a bad joke that got way out of hand.

Smith&#x27;s cover for issue #173 would prove influential. When editing the 1985 anthology book &quot;Heroes for Hope&quot;, which was intended to benefit famine relief in Africa, editor Ann Nocenti asked artist Arthur Adams to pattern his cover of that book after Smith&#x27;s illustration. This in turn prompted Bob Budiansky to have Adams produce a Wolverine poster with the same type of pose. The image, inked by Terry Austin, became not only a bestselling poster, but an iconic life-size standee for comics shops. Smith&#x27;s splash page for issue #168, of Kitty Pryde in a ski jacket sharply turning towards the reader while yelling, &quot;Professor Xavier is a jerk!&quot;, has been the subject of numerous homages and imitations. He also drew the &quot;X-Men / Alpha Flight&quot; limited series during his run, though it would not be published until later.

A few months after leaving &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;, Smith returned as the regular artist on &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;. He worked on that series from #65 to #73, drawing seven of those issues. Smith&#x27;s brief run on &quot;X-Men&quot; was distinguished by its smooth rendering and minimum of line, and most of it was later reprinted in the &quot;From the Ashes&quot; trade paperback. Eventually his entire &quot;X-Men&quot; run was reprinted in &quot;Essential X-Men&quot; Vol. 4. He bookended the &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; series, pencilling a short Daredevil story in issue #1, and writing, drawing and lettering a sequel to that Daredevil tale in #60, the final issue of the book. Smith had a brief stint on the X-Men spin-off &quot;X-Factor&quot;. Over the subsequent years Smith would return numerous times to work on various books of the &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise.

His other works include &quot;The Golden Age&quot; and the young adults comic &quot;Leave It to Chance&quot;, both collaborations with writer James Robinson. Smith has also contributed art to a number of First Comics titles including &quot;American Flagg!&quot;, &quot;Nexus&quot;, and &quot;GrimJack&quot;.

In 2005 Smith drew the &quot;Kitty Pryde: Shadow and Flame&quot; limited series written by Akira Yoshida.

<text>A search plugin provides the ability to access a search engine from a web browser, without having to go to the engine&#x27;s website first.

Technically, a search plugin is a small text file that tells the browser what information to send to a search engine and how the results are to be retrieved. The ease with which search plugins can be created has led to archives where public contributions can be downloaded, and these can be important in software personalization.

With the introduction of Firefox 2.0 in 2006, search plugins started to offer search suggestions, where terms would appear as the user typed. These are laid out in a menu, and are predicted based on the most likely ending to a word that was midway through being typed. This uses Ajax technology to query the remote website&#x27;s database for most common search terms, and so differs from traditional browser autofill, where the form would typically be completed based on information the user had entered previously.

Most search engines now offer search plugins and these are often paired with download of related software. Among those offering search plugins are Amazon, Google, eBay, Google Maps, Frompo and Reddit, among others.

==Formats==
*OpenSearch is supported by both Mozilla Firefox 2.0 and later, and Internet Explorer 7.
*Most Gecko based browsers support search plugins using a SGML based format.
*Opera supports search plugins using its custom search.ini format.

<doc id="887092" wikidata="Q723877" url="?curid=887092" title="Joseph Lancaster">
<text>Joseph Lancaster (25 November 1778 – 23 October 1838) was an English Quaker and public education innovator. He developed, and propagated on the grounds both of economy and efficacy, a monitorial system of primary education. In the first decades of the 19th century his ideas found application in new schools established in growing industrial centres.

==Early life==
He was born in Southwark, south London, on 25 November 1778, into a large family, the son of Richard Lancaster who had been a soldier and made cane sieves, and his wife Sarah Faulkes who was a shopkeeper. He was interested as a teenager in missionary work in Jamaica. He is said to have run away from home, and to have been returned through naval connections of the minister Thomas Urwick.

Lancaster joined the Society of Friends, with the intention of becoming a teacher.

==Schoolmaster==
In 1798, Lancaster founded a free elementary school, with support from his father. He went on in 1801 to start in Borough Road, Southwark a free school using a variant of the monitorial system.

Lancaster&#x27;s ideas were developed simultaneously with those of Andrew Bell in Madras whose system was referred to as the &quot;Madras system of education&quot;. Without wishing to &quot;detract from he praise so justly due&quot; to Lancaster, Elizabeth Hamilton noted they had been also &quot;anticipated&quot; some forty years before by the Belfast schoolmaster David Manson (1718-1792).

The method of instruction and delivery is recursive. As one student learns the material he or she is rewarded for successfully passing on that information to the next pupil. This method is now commonly known as peer tutoring. The use of monitors was prompted partly by a need to avoid the cost of assistant teachers.

Lancaster wrote &quot;Improvements in Education as it Respects the Industrious Classes of the Community&quot; in 1803. It brought him positive publicity, and the Borough Road school numerous visitors.

==Support==

The Borough Road school called itself the Royal Free School, and Lancaster was granted an audience with George III in 1805, at Weymouth. This apogee of recognition built on the support of John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford, and involved two royal dukes, Kent and Strathearn and Sussex.

Lancaster&#x27;s supporters have been defined as &quot;influential Nonconformists, utilitarian liberals and radicals.&quot; They included Edward Wakefield and James Mill. In his education book &quot;Chrestomathia&quot; (1816), Jeremy Bentham supported a version of the monitorial system, for which he gave both Bell and Lancaster credit, but moved from Lancaster&#x27;s non-sectarian religious stance to a secularism hostile to Anglicanism.

The year 1808 saw the creation of &quot;The Society for Promoting the Lancasterian System for the Education of the Poor&quot;. A major figure in it was William Allen, another Quaker, who acted as treasurer. It went by the name Royal Lancasterian Society. According to Henry Dunn, writing in 1848, the others on the initial committee were William Corston, Joseph Foster (of Bromley), Joseph Fox, John Jackson and Thomas Sturge. This group, without Sturge, raised £5600 for Lancaster&#x27;s school.

Lancaster, himself, travelled the British Isles to advise on his methods.

Addressing a school committee in Belfast he appeared to reduce these to a question of economy. Lancaster described a &quot;mechanical system of education&quot; whereby &quot;above one thousand children may be governed by one master only, at an expense reduced to five shillings per annum&quot;. He did, however, make a stipulation, critical in the Ulster context, that pupils should never be asked whether they belonged to &quot;Church, Meeting, or Chapel&quot;. A year in advance of his visit in 1811, two schools on his model had already been established in Ulster: in Belfast, and in Lisburn.

The merits of the system was debated at length in the pages of the Belfast Monthly Magazine. The editor, the former United Irishman and founder of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, William Drennan, prefaced the discussion with the observation that &quot;notwithstanding the public benefit from making man a machine, we cannot help thinking that the personal enjoyment gained by knowledge of reading, and figures, with the uses to which such knowledge may in future be applied, is in itself a value worth a great deal of cloth, a great many scissors, and a great many pins&quot;.

==Opposition==
The context in England for the Lancasterian school was the array of elementary dame schools (typically fee-paying), charity schools, Sunday schools (such as those set up by Robert Raikes around Gloucester) and the Mendip Hills schools run by the evangelical Hannah More. Sarah Trimmer, involved in the London area in both Sunday school and charity school work, and concerned for the evangelical Anglican parent, attacked Lancaster&#x27;s use of pupil monitors in &quot;A Comparative View of the New Plan of Education Promulgated by Mr. Joseph Lancaster&quot; (1805). &quot;A Churchman&quot;, writing to the &quot;British Critic&quot; in October 1805, commented that

Granting [...] that a dissenter may &quot;teach&quot; only what he calls &quot;the leading and uncontroverted principles of Christianity,&quot; is it not to be feared that the disregard shown to all religious systems and creeds, may so confound the distinctions between right and wrong, that it may eventually occasion the rejection of Christianity altogether?&quot;

After initial successes, the Lancasterian schools were criticized for poor standards and harsh discipline. Lancaster had rejected corporal punishment, but misbehaving children might find themselves tied up in sacks, or hoisted above the classroom in cages. Robert Southey was an opponent of corporal punishment, also: but he wrote in 1812, after giving examples of shaming punishments listed in Lancaster&#x27;s writings:

However objectionable the rod may be [...] it becomes a wise and humane engine of punishment when compared to the yokes and shackles, the cords, and fetters, and cages of Mr. Lancaster.

After Lancaster&#x27;s initial royal recognition, the monarchy turned away in the 1810s, and the Church of England sustained its hostility.

==Controversy and ouster==
Lancaster fell out with the Society over a number of issues. There was poor financial management, and he was imprisoned in a sponging house for debt. According to Francis Place, a committee member from 1812, they had information that Lancaster had been privately beating a number of the boys. Critics accused him of deism and homosexuality. He was ousted from the Society in 1814.
A group of young teachers had come up through the Lancasterian System: Thomas Harrod, James George Penney, John Pickton, John Veevers, John Thomas Crossley. It was Pickton who replaced Lancaster at Borough Road.
The Society renamed itself the British and Foreign School Society (BFSS), a contrast with the Anglican National School System. Lancaster, by then a bankrupt, resented the new name. He still travelled the United Kingdom, lecturing and creating local organisations.

==In the Americas==
In 1818, backed by the mill owner David Holt and other friends, Lancaster and his family sailed to the United States. He had significant American supporters: Roberts Vaux and Robert Ralston in Philadelphia, and DeWitt Clinton in New York. Clinton had founded a Lancasterian school in 1806, prompted by Thomas Eddy, who knew of Lancaster&#x27;s work via Patrick Colquhoun in London. Eddy had recently recruited a BFSS master, Charles Pickton trained by Lancaster, for the New York school, leaving no place for Lancaster himself.

Lancaster helped to start the first model school in Philadelphia to train teachers to implement his system. He also started a school in Baltimore, but it was not financially viable. A Lancasterian school was set up in New Haven in 1822, with the help of Timothy Dwight IV, and was run successfully by John Lowell, an American disciple.

===Venezuela===
Simón Bolívar, the South American revolutionary, had visited the Borough Road School when on a diplomatic visit to England in 1810. At the time it was not clear how successful Bolívar would be in ending Spanish rule in South America, and the British government did not endorse the idea of independence for Spanish colonies. Visiting England was therefore politically disappointing for him, but Lancaster&#x27;s education system was one of the things he found interesting in the country. In 1823 Lancaster apparently felt that living in the tropics would be good for his health, and he took advantage of an opportunity to renew contact with Bolívar, who was by then president of Gran Colombia. Lancaster encountered a soldier with Bolívar&#x27;s Irish Legion, who took a letter for him to Bolívar. Gran Colombia included the territories of present-day Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela. It was to Venezuela where Lancaster sailed with his daughter Betsy and her husband (Lancaster&#x27;s wife had died in 1820). They arrived at the port of La Guaira in May 1824. 

Betsy and her husband moved on to Mexico in February 1825, and did not return, while Lancaster stayed to 1827 in Caracas. There was a small British community in the city. British investors took an interest in Venezuela in the 1820, and a commercial treaty between Great Britain and Gran Colombia was ratified in 1825. However, there was soon evidence that there were limits to what British capital and technology could achieve in the country. The engineer Robert Stephenson visited Venezuela in 1824 with a brief to survey the route of a railway line between La Guaira and Caracas, but the project was considered unviable. As well as his educational work, Lancaster involved himself with Scots settlers based at an agricultural estate called Topo. The Scots were brought to Venezuela in 1825 by John Diston Powles and associates, as part of a project which has been described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as a predictable failure. Lancaster and Robert Ker Porter, the British consul from the end of 1825, concurred in supporting the relocation of the Scots in Canada. However, on other matters Lancaster clashed with Porter, who regarded him as an imposter.

Much of the population in Caracas was illiterate and there was a need for more access to primary education. Lancaster&#x27;s educational work did not go smoothly, however. Some of the problems were attributable to Lancaster himself. His lack of Spanish, for example, impeded his work. Also, Lancaster appears to have moved from his non-sectarian Christian stance to a refusal to teach religion, a position which caused a problem with the council in Caracas, although this was arguably a difficulty caused by the weakness of the Colombian state rather than Lancaster directly. (Bolívar endorsed the separation of church and state in his Cartagena Manifesto, but he struggled to control the vast Gran Colombia).

In 1827 Lancaster married for the second time, with Bolívar attending the wedding. However, Bolívar and Lancaster fell out over non-payment of the promised sum to support the educational work.

Lancaster left Caracas covertly in April 1827, sailing first to Saint Thomas and Saint Croix, and arriving in New Haven in June. He left his wife Mary and her children to make their own way back to Philadelphia.

There was at least one school in Venezuela that retained Lancaster&#x27;s name in the longer term, but the Lancasterian method seems to have had more success in Mexico.

===Canada===
The Rev. Thaddeus Osgood had set up schools using Lancaster&#x27;s system in Lower Canada, one in Quebec in 1814, another in Kingston, Ontario. Lancaster was there in 1829, and opened a school in Montreal, but his attempts to obtain funding floundered and he moved back to the United States.

==Death and legacy==
Lancaster died on 23 October 1838 in New York City from injuries sustained in a street accident.
At the time of his death, between 1,200 and 1,500 schools were said to use his principles.

The BFSS was widely successful in the early part of the 19th century, but the waning popularity of monitorial methods during the 1820s and 1830s meant that it became a more conventional school society. There is just one remaining Lancasterian schoolroom, built to the specifications of Lancaster himself. It is at the British Schools Museum, in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, England.

==Family==
Lancaster married:

#In 1804, Elizabeth Bonner (died 1820), daughter of Henry Bonner of Southwark; they had a daughter, Elizabeth (known as Betsy). Elizabeth suffered from mental illness, and died in Baltimore.
#In 1827, Mary Robinson, in Caracas. She was the widow of John Robinson, a British miniature painter who had moved to Philadelphia in 1817, and had three children from her first marriage. Robinson had been Betsy&#x27;s drawing master in 1819, and died in 1825.

On 20 April 1824, Betsy married Richard Madox Jones in Philadelphia: he had crossed the Atlantic with the Lancasters, and formed part of the household. This wedding took place shortly before the family moved to Caracas. Jones was trained in the System at Borough Road in 1812, and had then taught at Godalming, followed by a period in Cornwall. He became a Lancasterian organiser in Mexico, dying in 1855. Joseph Lancaster&#x27;s descendants still live in Mexico: see Ricardo Lancaster-Jones y Verea.

<text>The Batavia Muckdogs are a collegiate summer baseball team in the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League (PGCBL). They are located in Batavia, a city in Genesee County, New York, United States. Their home field is Dwyer Stadium in the city of Batavia, built after the 1996 season to replace the original Dwyer Stadium (formerly State Street Park, MacArthur Stadium) that opened July 27, 1938 as home to the Batavia Bees, a semi-pro team in the Genesee County League. 

Off and on from 1939 to 2020, they were members of Minor League Baseball&#x27;s New York–Penn League (NYPL). With Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues after the 2020 season, Batavia was not selected to continue in affiliated baseball. They later joined PGCBL for the 2021 season.

==History==
Prior to the current Batavia franchise, professional baseball in the city dates back to 1897 when Batavia played in the New York State League. The Batavia Giants, sometimes referred to as the Reds because of their crimsons uniforms, were the first classified team in the city making their debut - after some rainouts - on May 14, 1897, against the Auburn franchise at a stadium built on Swan Street; future major leaguer Jack Burns batted third and played shortstop. After a rough start to the season, where the team lost their first 9 games, the team released eight players and fired manager Martin Earley. J.J. Benner took over the club as team captain and acting manager, however play did not improve and he was replaced by former major leaguer Joe Hornung who was named player-manager on May 24, he made his debut in the lineup on June 14 at 40 years old, going hitless. After 20 games the team sat at 4–16 and had money troubles where local fans would not pay the 10 cent admission, Hornung left the team on July 9. It was announced on July 24 that the team would move to Geneva, by July 25 the team had left Batavia and become the Geneva Alhambras. That season the Class-C New York State League also consisted of teams in Canandaigua, Cortland, Lyons, Palmyra, and Auburn.

As was popular across the country, Batavia hosted many semi-pro leagues prior too, and after, the Giants left town. This included the Western New York League along with teams in nearby Le Roy, Perry and Warsaw. The Batavia Bees were the popular semi-pro team prior to professional baseball coming back to Batavia in 1939, and they continued play even after the Clippers arrived.

The history of the New York–Penn League originated in Batavia as the league, then known as the Pennsylvania–Ontario–New York League (PONY League), was formed in a local hotel that has since been demolished. Original league cities included Batavia, Bradford, Hamilton, Jamestown, Niagara Falls, and Olean.

The Muckdogs were founded in 1939 as the Batavia Clippers, however the team was not in operation during the 1954–56 and 1960 seasons after dropping out of the league for financial reasons. During the 1957 through 1959 seasons the team was known as the Batavia Indians, upon their final return to the league in 1961 the team was known as the Batavia Pirates until changing their name to the Batavia Trojans in 1966 until 1987.

From 1988 through the 1997 season the team brought back the historic Batavia Clippers name before changing to the Muckdogs in 1998 based on a fan poll that chose the nickname and logo. The &quot;Muckdogs&quot; name was inspired by Genesee County&#x27;s mucklands. Batavia celebrated their 80th anniversary during the 2019 seasons as the only founding member of the league still in existence.

The Muckdogs franchise was surrendered to the league prior to the 2018 season. The team was then operated as a ward of the league.

After the cancelled 2020 minor league season, Major League Baseball took direct control of Minor League Baseball and discontinued short-season play. The Muckdogs were not among the teams invited to remain in affiliated baseball. The city received offers from collegiate summer baseball and semi-professional leagues for 2021. After being purchased by CAN-USA Sports, the Muckdogs joined Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League, a collegiate summer league, for 2021.

==Logo and mascot==
The Muckdogs logo adopted in 1998 is a dog on a crushed fence in the shape of an &quot;M&quot; surrounded by muck with baseballs on either side. The team also has an alternate logo of a B with a dog.

The Muckdogs currently have one mascot, Dewey, however had three mascots who would make appearances throughout the season at Dwyer Stadium in recent years. The team&#x27;s original mascot Maxwell T. Chomper, Homer and Slider.

==Season-by-season record==


==Affiliation==
As the Muckdogs, Batavia was affiliated with the Philadelphia Phillies from 1998, having been already affiliated with the Phillies since 1988, through the 2006 season. Beginning with the 2007 season, the Phillies chose to move their Short-Season A affiliate closer to Philadelphia with the Williamsport Crosscutters. Meanwhile, the Muckdogs signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. Prior to the Cardinals and Phillies affiliation Batavia was also affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1952–53; 1961–65), Detroit Tigers (1968–71), New York Mets (1972–74), and Cleveland Indians (1942–51; 1957–59; 1976–86). The team also fielded a co-op team in 1966 featuring players from 12 different organizations, most notably Cito Gaston of the Atlanta Braves. In 1975, the team fielded another co-op team with players from 8 organizations including Don McCormack from the Philadelphia Phillies. 1987 was the final co-op team in Batavia.

After the 2012 season, the St. Louis Cardinals announced they would move their affiliation to the State College Spikes, who they had been affiliated with before coming to Batavia. On September 28, 2012, the Muckdogs announced they had signed a two-year player development contract with the Miami Marlins who were affiliated with the Jamestown Jammers from 2002 to 2011. Jamestown signed an affiliation agreement with the Pittsburgh Pirates who had left State College.

==Operations/ownership==
From 2008 to 2017 the Rochester Red Wings Triple-A team of the International League was responsible for operating the club. The team had previously been operated by the Genesee County Baseball Club who remained majority owner though the Red Wings gained a share of ownership with each season they operated the franchise with a cap of 50%.

The team has been up for sale since 2010 due to financial losses. In 2016, a sale to an ownership group that intended to relocate the franchise to Waldorf, Maryland, beginning in the 2017 season collapsed when the new owners were unable to secure permission from the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals, as well as the Eastern League and Carolina League. The Orioles&#x27; Class-AA affiliate, the Eastern League&#x27;s Bowie Baysox, are located in nearby Bowie, Maryland; the Nationals&#x27; Class-A affiliate, the Potomac Nationals, are based in nearby Woodbridge, Virginia. A Muckdogs move to Maryland would have impacted those teams&#x27; territorial rights.

===Surrender of franchise===
The Muckdogs ownership group surrendered their franchise to the NYPL on December 19, 2017, after the NYPL declined the Red Wings offer to continue to operate the ball club and the remaining owners could not meet the financial requirements to keep the team solvent. Under the terms of the surrender, if the NYPL sells the franchise, the Red Wings and Genesee County Baseball Club each will receive 45% of the proceeds, with the league keeping a 10% fee for themselves. GCBC will retain the rights to the Batavia Muckdogs name, should the league opt to relocate the franchise to a city other than Batavia. The NYPL did not guarantee the franchise will play in 2018 if a buyer could not be found. GCBC spoke of the possibility of bringing collegiate summer baseball to Batavia in the event the NYPL left.

In January 2018, the New York–Penn League agreed to keep the Muckdogs in Batavia for the 2018 season after agreeing with the City of Batavia on a lease for Dwyer Field. In 2019, the Muckdogs signed a two-year renewal of its affiliation with the Marlins, which the city insisted upon as a condition of keeping the team in Batavia; any new ownership group would still be free to move the team.

As part of the reorganization of minor league baseball, the Muckdogs minor league squad was contracted along with most of the rest of the New York-Penn League prior to the 2021 season. GCBC, in keeping with their 2017 statements, transferred the Muckdogs intellectual property to a new expansion team in the PGCBL. The Muckdogs were one of two NYPL brands to make the transfer at that time (the Auburn Doubledays being the other); the Jamestown Jammers had previously made a similar transition in 2015.

==Record==
Through the 2017 season, Batavia has played 75 seasons of professional baseball in its current location amassing 3,197 wins and 3,532 losses (.475).

The team&#x27;s 3,000th win came in form of a 5–3 decision on June 23, 2012, against the Jamestown Jammers at Russell Diethrick Park in Jamestown, New York. Jamestown was the only other city of the league&#x27;s original six remaining in the circuit, although it does not host the same franchise. Relief pitcher Jose Almarante earned the win.

===Managerial history===
Jack Tighe holds the All-Time record for wins in Batavia with a record of 298 wins and 239 losses in four seasons.
Dann Bilardello is tied for the modern era regular (short-season) record with 126 wins and 99 losses in three seasons, Ángel Espada tied the record in the last game of the 2016 season after four seasons, however Bilardello has one playoff victory as well giving him 127 wins overall. Mike Jacobs was named the Muckdogs manager for the 2017/2018 seasons, Tom Lawless managed the club in 2019.

Gene Baker was the first African-American manager in affiliated baseball during the 1961 season with the Batavia Pirates. Baker also is credited as being the first African-American manager in Major League History when he filled in after ejections, however, Frank Robinson was the first ever hired full time.

====All-time managerial records====
===Most MLB players on a short-season team===
The 1986 Batavia Trojans featured a short-season team record of eight future Major Leaguers on the roster — Jim Bruske, Tommy Hinzo, Tom Lampkin, Troy Neel, Bruce Egloff, Jeff Shaw, Joe Skalski, and Kevin Wickander—while affiliated with the Cleveland Indians. The record has since been broken with 11 by Batavia in 2007.

===No-hitters===
Batavia has been no-hit 15 times and thrown 5 no-hitters, however they are one of only two teams in league history who went on to win a game they had been no hit in when they defeated Newark 2–0 on August 3, 1973, for a record of 5–13 overall. Batavia was also part of the first ever league dual no-hitter where on August 25, 1952, Jim Mitchell of the Batavia Clippers and Frank Etchberger of the Bradford Phillies each no-hit the others team in opposite ends of a double header. The Clippers no-hit effort was not without controversy as it was a change by the official scorer that gave Mitchell his no-no. The Bradford paper reported the ball hit the glove of an outfielder and rolled to the wall where Bradford&#x27;s Tommy Keane was originally given a double, it was then changed to an error after the game. On June 24, 2015, three Batavia pitchers (Gabriel Castellanos, Brett Lilek, Steven Farnworth) combined for the teams first perfect game in history against the Mahoning Valley Scrappers.

==Attendance==

===Largest crowd===

The largest crowd to attend a professional game in Batavia is over 4,000 during the inaugural 1939 season. In more recent years, the two largest crowds happened on July 27, 2019, with 2,779 fans packing the stadium thanks to a promotion from local company Tompkins Insurance that bought anyone who wanted to attend a ticket. On July 29, 2011, 2,445 fans attended a game versus the Staten Island Yankees to see local Rochester native Cito Culver, who scored two runs for the Yankees and also batted another run in.

===Year by year===
As teams move to larger markets, and western New York area residency dwindling, the Muckdogs find themselves ranking last in attendance, though in 2008 a new policy was put forth by the Red Wings management to only report through the gate fans and not add on like several teams do to pad attendance records. Attendance substantially rebounded in 2019 as fans rallied behind the team in a last-ditch effort to save it.

<doc id="887097" wikidata="Q3079266" url="?curid=887097" title="Pyrus calleryana">
<text>Pyrus calleryana, also known as the Callery pear or Bradford pear, is a species of pear tree native to China and Vietnam, in the family Rosaceae. It is most commonly known for its cultivar &#x27;Bradford&#x27; and its offensive odor, widely planted throughout the United States and increasingly regarded as an invasive species.

&quot;Pyrus calleryana&quot; is deciduous, growing to tall, often with a conical to rounded crown. The leaves are oval, long, glossy dark green above and pale beneath. They have long petioles alternately arranged on branches. The white, five-petaled flowers are about in diameter. They are produced abundantly in early spring, before the leaves expand fully.

The fruits (which are often assumed to be inedible due to their abundant, cyanide laced seeds) of the Callery pear are small (less than in diameter), and hard, almost woody, until softened by frost, after which they are readily taken by birds, which disperse the seeds in their droppings. In summer, the shining foliage is dark green and very smooth, and in autumn the leaves commonly turn brilliant colors, ranging from yellow and orange to more commonly red, pink, purple, and bronze. However, since the color often develops very late in autumn, the leaves may be killed by a hard frost before full color can develop.

Callery pears are remarkably resistant to disease or fireblight. However, some cultivars, such as &#x27;Bradford&#x27;, are particularly susceptible to storm damage and are regularly disfigured or killed by strong winds, winter weather, or limb loss due to their naturally rapid growth rate and acute vertical branching.

The species is named after the Italian-French missionary Joseph-Marie Callery (1810–1862), a sinologue who sent specimens of the tree to Europe from China.

==Cultivation==
Numerous cultivars of Callery pear are offered commercially, including &#x27;Aristocrat&#x27;, &#x27;Autumn Blaze&#x27;, &#x27;Bradford&#x27;, &#x27;Capital&#x27;, &#x27;Chanticleer&#x27; (also known as &#x27;Cleveland Select&#x27;), &#x27;New Bradford&#x27;, &#x27;Redspire&#x27;, and &#x27;Whitehouse&#x27;.

===In the United States===
The trees were introduced to the U.S. by the United States Department of Agriculture facility at Glenn Dale, Maryland, as ornamental landscape trees in the mid-1960s. They became popular with landscapers because they were inexpensive, transported well and grew quickly. Lady Bird Johnson promoted the tree in 1966 by planting one in downtown Washington, D.C. &quot;The New York Times&quot; also promoted the tree saying, &quot;Few trees possess every desired attribute, but the Bradford ornamental pear comes unusually close to the ideal.&quot;

In much of North America these cultivars, particularly &#x27;Bradford&#x27;, are widely planted as ornamental trees. The trees are tolerant of a variety of soil types, drainage levels, and soil acidity. Their crown shape varies from ovate to elliptical, but may become asymmetric from limb loss due to excessive and unstable growth rate. The initial symmetry of several cultivars leads to their attempted use in settings such as industrial parks, streets, shopping centers, and office parks. Their dense clusters of white blossoms are conspicuous in early spring, with an odor often compared to rotting fish or semen. Individuals tend to flower young, exhibit quick growth, and create seeds that are dispersed primarily through birds. According to extension specialist Kelly Oten of North Carolina State University, the smell attracts flies which are the primary pollinators rather than bees. At the latitude of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the trees often remain green until mid-November, and in warm autumns, the colors are often bright, although in a cold year they may get frozen off before coloring. In the South, Callery pears tend to be among the more reliable coloring trees.

A famous example of a Callery pear is the one that was found to have survived the destruction of the Twin Towers on 9/11 and was restored to full health subsequently. It is often referred to as &quot;the Survivor Tree&quot;.

==Subtaxa==
The following varieties are currently accepted:
* &quot;Pyrus calleryana&quot; var. &quot;calleryana&quot; – China, Japan, and Vietnam, introduced to the United States and Iraq
* &quot;Pyrus calleryana&quot; var. &quot;fauriei&quot; – Korea
* &quot;Pyrus calleryana&quot; var. &quot;integrifolia&quot; – China
* &quot;Pyrus calleryana&quot; var. &quot;koehnei&quot; – China
* &quot;Pyrus calleryana&quot; var. &quot;lanceata&quot; – China

== As an invasive species ==
The Bradford pear and related cultivars of &quot;Pyrus calleryana&quot; are regarded as invasive species in many areas of the Eastern and Midwestern regions in North America, outcompeting many native plants and trees. In the northeastern United States, wild Callery pears sometimes form extensive, nearly homogeneous stands in old fields, along roadsides, and in similar disturbed areas. The species was first noticed spreading outside of human cultivation in the 1990s, and by the latter half of the 2000s, Callery pear trees were widespread and could be found in habitats ranging from wetlands to forests.

While various cultivars of the Callery pear are commonly planted for their ornamental value, their prolifically produced fruits are taken by birds, which disperse the seeds in their droppings. The various cultivars are generally themselves self-incompatible, unable to produce fertile seeds when self-pollinated, or cross-pollinated with another tree of the same cultivar. However, if different cultivars of Callery pears are grown in proximity (within insect-pollination distance, about 300 ft or 100 m), they often produce fertile seeds that can sprout and establish wherever they are dispersed. The resulting wild individuals, of various genetic backgrounds, can in turn interbreed, producing more viable seed and furthering expansion and dispersal of the wild stand of the species. These plants often differ from the selected cultivars in their irregular crown shape and (sometimes) presence of thorns.

Callery pear is reported as established outside cultivation in 152 counties in 25 states in the United States. While these wild plants are sometimes called &quot;Bradford pear&quot; (for the &#x27;Bradford&#x27; cultivar), they are actually wild-growing descendants of multiple genotypes of &quot;Pyrus calleryana&quot;, and hence more correctly referred to by the common (or scientific) name of the species itself. Currently, the spread of the invasive trees is limited by their intolerance to extreme cold, but they are creeping northward as climate change causes warming temperatures, and have been found as far north as Madison, Wisconsin.

The Bradford pear in particular has become further regarded as a nuisance tree for its initially neat, dense upward growth, which made it desirable in cramped urban spaces. Without corrective selective pruning at an early stage, these weak crotches result in a multitude of narrow, weak forks that are very susceptible to storm damage. Because of this, and the resulting relatively short life span (typically less than 25 years), many groups have discouraged further planting of &#x27;Bradford&#x27; and other similarly structurally deficient Callery pear cultivars (such as &#x27;Cleveland Select&#x27;) in favor of increasing use of locally native ornamental tree species.

It should be recognized that even though P. calleryana is considered an invasive species, there have been cases in which it did not have an impact when introduced as a nonnative species. In young, low-density populations, this tree was found to have no significant effect on species richness or diversity in its surrounding environment. to understand how this species interacts in a given environment, further studies should be considered. 

In 2023, the state of Ohio banned the sale and cultivation of Callery pear trees.

==Uses==
Pear wood (of any species) is among the finest-textured of all fruitwoods. It is prized for making woodwind instruments, and pear veneer is used in fine furniture. Pear wood is also among those preferred for preparing woodcuts for printing, either end-grained for small works or side-grained for larger.

Callery pear has been used as rootstock for grafting such pear cultivars as Comice, Bosc, or Seckel, and especially for Nashi. &quot;Pyrus calleryana&quot; was first introduced into the United States in 1909 and 1916, largely influenced by the dedicated research of Frank N. Meyer, plant explorer for the US Department of Agriculture, commonly known for the discovery of the Meyer lemon, for agricultural experimentation, pre-dating recognition in the 1950s of the species&#x27; potential as an ornamental plant.

<text>U.S. Route 29 or U.S. Highway 29 (US 29) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway that runs for from Pensacola, Florida, to Ellicott City, Maryland, just west of Baltimore, Maryland, in the Eastern United States, connecting the Florida Panhandle to the Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area. The highway takes on an overall northeast–southwest direction, from its southern terminus at US 90 and US 98 in Pensacola to its northern terminus at Maryland Route 99 (MD 99) in Ellicott City.

The section of US 29 between Greensboro, North Carolina, and Danville, Virginia, has been designated as Future Interstate 785 (Future I-785) and has received future Interstate signs in several locations along that route. It will become an official Interstate Highway once improvements have been completed.

From Auburn, Alabama, to Greensboro, I-85 runs parallel to US 29, which serves primarily as a local route along that stretch.

===Florida===

US 29 begins at US 90 and US 98 in downtown Pensacola, Florida. Throughout the state, US 29 is twinned with the unsigned State Road 95 (SR 95).

The entire route in Florida runs within Escambia County. From its terminus north to SR 296, it is known as North Palafox Street. From this point, it is known as Pensacola Boulevard north to Ten Mile Road, approximately north of US 90 Alternate. Between SR 296 and the Molino community, US 29 runs parallel to its former routing, which is now County Road 95A. This former routing continues the name North Palafox Street from SR 296 north to Ten Mile Road.

===Alabama===

US 29, internally designated by the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) as State Route 15 (SR 15), is a southwest-northeast state highway across the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Alabama. SR 15 ends in Brewton at a junction with US 31 (SR 3) and SR 41, but US 29 continues west with US 31/SR 3 to Flomaton and south on SR 113 to the Florida state line.

US 29/SR 15 traverses Alabama in a general northeast–southwest path. It has never been a major route in the state; its significance was completely overshadowed with the completion of I-65 and I-85 during the 1970s. Today, US 29/SR 15 serves primarily to connect numerous smaller towns and cities in the southwest, south-central, and eastern parts of Alabama, notably passing near Troy, Tuskegee, and Auburn universities in the east.

US 29 no longer passes through downtown Auburn or downtown Opelika. The U.S. Highway is concurrent with I-85 from exit 51, south of Auburn, to exit 64, northeast of Opelika. This change was made by ALDOT in the 1990s. Route markers have been appropriately relocated since then.

===Georgia===

US 29 passes through the northern portion of Georgia, starting in Hart County toward Athens and Gwinnett County and then onward to Atlanta. The highway passes by notable universities, such as Georgia Tech and Emory University in Atlanta and the University of Georgia in Athens. US 29 meanders through Hartwell and the Lake Hartwell region near the South Carolina border. From West Point, (just south of LaGrange) at the Alabama–Georgia state line to Downtown Atlanta, SR 8 and SR 14 are paired with US 29 at various points in the state. US 29 to the southwest of Atlanta has been named Roosevelt Highway, since Franklin D. Roosevelt made his final journey northward from Warm Springs along this stretch of highway. Large crowds gathered along US 29 on this day in April 1945 to pay their final respects to the deceased president. Unfortunately, for those who waited along the highway, they missed seeing the president&#x27;s body being transported back to Washington DC on a train that ran on nearby tracks.

===South Carolina===

In South Carolina, US 29 maintains a northeasterly routing, passing through Anderson, Greenville, and Spartanburg.

From Greenville through Greer, US 29 is known as Wade Hampton Boulevard. It is a major commercial artery for both Greer and Taylors. A six-lane highway, the road forms the western border of Bob Jones University and then passes near Chick Springs, a mineral springs that served as the focus of a small but important resort community during the 19th century.

US 29 was built as the main highway between Greenville and the other city of northwestern South Carolina, Spartanburg. The construction of I-85, connecting Greenville to Spartanburg, left US 29 underused until recent decades.

===North Carolina===

In North Carolina, US 29 connects the cities of Gastonia, Charlotte, Concord, Salisbury, High Point, Greensboro, and Reidsville. US 29 routes through Charlotte along Tryon Street, one of the main arteries that runs through Uptown Charlotte. NASCAR&#x27;s Charlotte Motor Speedway is on US 29 where Charlotte and Concord border. After leaving the Charlotte metropolitan area, the road stays parallel with I-85 and concurrent with US 70 and serves as a secondary highway for cities along the Interstate. It stays parallel with I-85 for another before branching off in Greensboro and heading north towards Reidsville and then to Virginia towards Danville. US 29 from Lexington to the Virginia border is considered to be a controlled-access highway.

===Virginia===
In Virginia, part of US 29 is named the Lee Highway. US 29 connects the historic small cities and large towns of west-central Virginia, including Danville, Lynchburg, Charlottesville, Culpeper, and Warrenton, with Fairfax, Falls Church, Arlington, and Washington DC to the northeast and with North Carolina to the southwest.

Along its route in Virginia, US 29 provides significant access to and from several major colleges and universities, including the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, George Mason University in Fairfax, Sweet Briar College in Sweet Briar, and Liberty University, University of Lynchburg, and Randolph College in Lynchburg.

===District of Columbia===
US 29 enters Washington DC via the Key Bridge adjacent to Georgetown University. The designation turns east onto the Whitehurst Freeway, bypassing Georgetown to the south. Upon crossing Rock Creek, the freeway ends, becoming the at-grade K Street. US 29 remains on K Street to 11th Street, where US 29 turns north onto 11th for seven blocks. At Rhode Island Avenue, US 29 turns right. US 29 northbound turns left at 6th Street (touching US 1 where it turns from Rhode Island Avenue to 6th Street); it follows 6th Street for two blocks and then turns left onto Florida Avenue, where it then turns right onto Georgia Avenue. US 29 southbound at this point, however, follows 7th Street to Rhode Island Avenue. The route maintains a northerly routing as it passes through northern Washington DC and enters Maryland. During its alignment with Georgia Avenue, US 29 bypasses the Howard University campus to the west.

===Maryland===

In Maryland, US 29 turns northeast onto Colesville Road, intersects the Capital Beltway (I-495), becomes Columbia Pike, and intersects New Hampshire Avenue (MD 650), MD 200 (Intercounty Connector), MD 198, MD 32, MD 175, MD 100, US 40, and I-70 before terminating at MD 99 in northern Ellicott City.

==History==

Warrenton Turnpike is the former name of US 29 through Prince William County, Virginia. This is the name that was used for this road during the U.S. Civil War. Although the road has been expanded past Manassas into four lanes, it remains a rural two lane highway through Manassas National Battlefield Park, where I-66 carries through traffic. On either side of the road through the battlefield, split rail fences define property borders. The route has also been called the Bill-Beth Highway as it was the name of the children of the original highway developer.

===U.S. Route 170===
U.S. Route 170 (US 170) was the portion of US 29 from US 70 at Charlotte, North Carolina, northeast to Lynchburg, Virginia, from 1926 until 1931, when US 29 became part of the route. The US 170 designation was then removed and the route remained as US 29 only.

==Future==
The freeway stretch of US 29 traveling southwest from Greensboro to Lexington, North Carolina, is currently also signed as I-85 Business (I-85 Bus.) and US 70. On October 5, 2019, the North Carolina Department of Transportation submitted an application to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, and was granted approval, for the removal of the I-85 Bus. designation from the freeway, and the rerouting of US 70 between Greensboro and Thomasville, leaving US 29 on the route. This plan, according to the state, will simplify overhead signage on the freeway and eliminate the confusion between I-85 and I-85 Bus.

<text>Bank Street College of Education is a private school and graduate school in New York City. It consists of a graduate-only teacher training college and an independent nursery-through-8th-grade school. In 2020 the graduate school had about 65 full-time teaching staff and approximately 850 students, of which 87% were female.

==History==
The origins of the school lie in the Bureau of Educational Experiments, which was established in 1916 by Lucy Sprague Mitchell, her husband Wesley Clair Mitchell, and Harriet Merrill Johnson; Lucy Mitchell&#x27;s cousin Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge provided financial support. The bureau was intended to foster research into, and development of, experimental and progressive education, and was influenced by the thinking of Edward Thorndike and John Dewey, both of whom Mitchell had studied with at Columbia University. The bureau was run by a council of twelve members, but Mitchell was its most influential figure until the 1950s. The name of the institution derives from its 1930–1971 location at 69 Bank Street in Greenwich Village.

In 1919 the bureau started a nursery school for children from fifteen to thirty-six months old; Harriet Johnson was the director. The school fed in to the Play School for three- to seven-year-olds run by Caroline Pratt; eight-year-olds were taught in a special class by members of the bureau.

Bank Street College of Education served as an academic consultant during development for Multiplication Rock, the first series of Schoolhouse Rocks!

In 1958, the college received a $1,000,000 grant from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare for a five-year study on how schools for younger children could improve mental health development.

The personal computer word processing application Bank Street Writer (1981) was developed by the college and marketed to school and home computer markets. Its brand extension Bank Street Music Writer (1985) was a music composition application.

Doug Knecht is the current Dean of Children&#x27;s Programs and Head of the School for Children.

== Bank Street School for Children ==
The Bank Street School for Children is a private coed preschool, elementary school, and middle school within the Bank Street College of Education. The school includes children in nursery through eighth grade, split into three divisions: the lower school, for nursery through first grade; the middle school, for second through fourth grades; and the upper school, for fifth through eighth grades. There are 451 children enrolled as students, approximately 50% of which are students of color. The instructors are often current or past students of Bank Street&#x27;s graduate school, which shares a campus with the School for Children—including more than half of the teachers who are alumni.

The School for Children is accredited by the New York State Association of Independent Schools and is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools.

==Bank Street Bookstore==
The Bank Street Bookstore was an Upper West Side community bookstore that sold children&#x27;s books and educational toys and games. It opened in 1970 in the lobby of Bank Street College, and moved to its second location on 112th Street and Broadway shortly thereafter. Its final location was on Broadway and West 107th Street until its closing in August 2020, due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The bookstore also hosted readings, daily story time, and celebrity events, with past guests including Stephen Colbert, Julianne Moore, and author Jeff Kinney.

<doc id="887114" wikidata="Q1348533" url="?curid=887114" title="Tolbert Lanston">
<text>Tolbert Lanston (February 3, 1844 – February 18, 1913) was the American founder of Monotype, inventing a mechanical typesetting system patented in 1887 and the first hot metal typesetter a few years later. 

==Life==
Tolbert Lanston was born into a poor family in Troy, Ohio. He quit school at the age of 15, he was a volunteer in the Federal Army during the Civil War. His last rank was sergeant.

After 1865 he worked at the Pension-Department of the American Government. He worked with Seaton and Herman Hollerith (founder of IBM) on tabulating devices and invented an adding machine which was the first money-maker for Hollerith&#x27;s company. Lanston&#x27;s brother was a printer and evidently that connection caused his interest in automating the laborious task of hand-setting every letter in any or all texts. He resigned his post at the Pension office and devoted the remainder of his life to perfection of his machine. He created the idea but others perfected it and made the Lanston Monotype Machine Company successful. That includes J. Maury Dove, a coal merchant who became president of the company and remained there until his death in 1923, and John Sellers Bancroft, who was the mechanical genius behind the Monotype machine. The story is thoroughly developed in &quot;Tolbert Lanston and the Monotype: The Origin of Digital Typesetting&quot;.

He married Betty G. Herdel in 1866, and they had one son.

In 1896, he received the Elliott Cresson Medal for his invention.
He died in Washington, D.C., on February 18, 1913. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

==The inventor==
Although Lanston was an inventor, he had no education at all as an engineer.

He did start his inventions to create a type-setting machine, first with the financial help of Seaton, later from J. Maury Dove, coal-merchant in Washington.

Letters sent to the Patent-bureau with specifications sent at:

* September 30, 1885, July 3, 1886
* patent nr. 364.521 June 7, 1887
* patent nr. 364.525 June 7, 1887

The idea was to make lead type for printing, with two machines, the first to produce two paper-tapes, these two paper-tapes controlling the second machine to produce the type. Lanston made a series of prototypes.

==Development of the machine==
John Sellers Bancroft of Sellers &amp; Co in Philadelphia was asked to help with the development of the machine.

Bancroft made a series of important improvements. A wedge to govern the width of the character. This wedge makes the same movement as the diecase with the matrices, in one direction. The matrices are ordered in the diecase, each row has only matrices for characters of the same width. The wedge controls the opening in the mould.

Compressed air was used to control the movements of the matrices above the mould of the machine.

This machine was capable to produce filled lines, by controlling the width of the spaces, with two extra wedges. The accuracy of the machine was 2,000 parts in 1 inch.

The first commercial machines were available around 1897. These machines had only room for 132 matrices. A few of these machines were sent to England.

Later types had die-cases with 15*15 and 17*15 or even 16*17 matrices.

<text>Cryoprecipitate, also called cryo for short, or Cryoprecipitate Antihemophilic factor (AHF), is a frozen blood product prepared from blood plasma. To create cryoprecipitate, Plasma is slowly thawed to 1–6 °C. A cold-insoluble precipitate is formed, which is collected by centrifugation, resuspended in a small amount of residual plasma (generally 10–15 mL) and then re-frozen for storage. Cryoprecipitate contains fibrinogen, Factor VIII, Factor XIII and vWF. In many clinical contexts, use of cryoprecipitate has been replaced with use of clotting factor concentrates (where available), but the whole form is still routinely stocked by many hospital Blood bank. Cryo can be stored at −18 °C or colder for 12 months from the original collection date or up to 36 months in Europe if stored below -25 °C. After thawing, single units of cryo (or units pooled using a sterile method) can be stored at 20–24 °C for up to 6 hours. If units of cryo are pooled in an open system, they can only be held at 20–24 °C for up to 4 hours. Presently cryo cannot be re-frozen for storage after it is thawed for use if it is not transfused.

Compatibility testing (Cross-matching) before transfusion of cryoprecipitate are not necessary. However, cryoprecipitate should preferably be ABO compatible with the recipient&#x27;s red cells. ABO-incompatible cryoprecipitate can be used with caution, particularly with large volumes. If a large volume of ABO-incompatible cryoprecipitate is used, the recipient may develop a positive direct antiglobulin test and, very rarely, mild haemolysis. Matching for RhD type is not necessary.

==Medical uses==
Medical uses for giving cryoprecipitate include:
* Hypofibrinogenaemia (low fibrinogen levels), or dysfibrinogenaemia as can occur with massive transfusions.
* Bleeding from excessive anticoagulation – Fresh frozen plasma contains most of the coagulation factors and is an alternative choice when anticoagulation has to be reversed quickly.
* Massive haemorrhage.
* Disseminated intravascular coagulation
* Acute coagulopathy after TBI
Cryoprecipitate should not be used to treat haemophilia, von Willebrand’s disease or deficiencies of Factor XIII or fibronectin except in cases where alternative therapies are unavailable.

A typical adult dose is 10 units of whole blood-derived cryoprecipitate, equivalent to a fibrinogen dose of approximately 3−4 g.

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects reported with the usage of cryoprecipitate include hemolytic transfusion reactions, febrile non-hemolytic reactions, allergic reactions (ranging from urticaria to anaphylaxis), septic reactions, transfusion related acute lung injury, circulatory overload, transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, and post-transfusion purpura.

==Composition==
Each unit (around 10 to 15 mL) typically provides:
* Fibrinogen 150–250 mg, although on average, usually higher
* Factor VIII 80–150 U
* Factor XIII 50–75 U 
* von Willebrand factor 100–150 U
Cryoprecipitate also contains fibronectin; however there are no clear indications for fibronectin replacement.

US standards require manufacturers to test at least four units each month, and the products must have a minimum of 150 mg or more of fibrinogen and 80 IU of factor VIII per unit. European standards require 140 mg or more of fibrinogen, 70 IU of factor VIII and 100 IU of vWF per unit.

== History ==
While the current method for producing cryoprecipitate was developed by Judith Graham Pool from Stanford University in 1964, it was initially approved in 1971 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the name &quot;Cryoprecipitated AHF&quot; for the Hoxworth Blood Center University of Cincinnati Medical Center.

<doc id="887135" wikidata="Q186504" url="?curid=887135" title="The Portrait of a Lady (film)">
<text>The Portrait of a Lady is a 1996 British-American film directed by Jane Campion and adapted by Laura Jones from Henry James&#x27; 1881 novel of the same name.

The film stars Nicole Kidman, Barbara Hershey, John Malkovich, Mary-Louise Parker, Martin Donovan, Shelley Duvall, Richard E. Grant, Shelley Winters, Viggo Mortensen, Valentina Cervi, Christian Bale, and John Gielgud. It received two nominations at the 69th Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actress (Hershey) and Best Costume Design (Janet Patterson).

The film tells the story of Isabel Archer, an innocent young woman of independent means manipulated by her &quot;friend&quot; Madame Merle, and the devious Gilbert Osmond.

==Plot==
Isabel Archer is a woman who has already rejected many suitors, including the wealthy Lord Warburton and Caspar Goodwood, to whom she had initially given hope. Caspar&#x27;s arrival is arranged by Henrietta, a close friend of Isabel who cares for her deeply. Isabel&#x27;s strong character and free-spirited nature are adored by her cousin, Ralph Touchett, who persuades his father, her uncle, to give Isabel money so that she can be rich and independent. Upon her uncle&#x27;s death, Isabel receives a fortune.

Isabel encounters Madame Serena and instantly likes her. Learning about Isabel&#x27;s wealth, Serena decides to arrange a marriage between Isabel and Serena&#x27;s former lover Gilbert Osmond, who lives in Florence, Italy. Gilbert is a widower and has a daughter Pansy, who grew up in a convent and is not allowed to leave the house, even to walk in the garden, when her father is away. Isabel is enchanted by Gilbert and accepts the proposal; however, she is warned by Ralph that Gilbert is a &quot;small man&quot; and Isabel is giving up her dreams to be in a cage with a worthless husband. Isabel is enraged and slaps Ralph, to which he calmly answers that he said what he must, that he loves Isabel, and that he knows he has no hope. It is also evident that he is slowly dying from consumption.

Gilbert is nice to Isabel until after they are married. Isabel finds herself trapped in Rome in an unhappy marriage with a fear of her abusive husband, who gradually disconnects her from all of her friends. Henrietta, Ralph, and Caspar all leave for England. Pansy is also a victim of her father&#x27;s overly protective behavior; she is in love with Rosier, but Gilbert has decided to arrange a marriage between her and Lord Warburton, who is attentive to Pansy just to get closer to Isabel. Isabel sees the mutual love between Pansy and Rosier and is deeply moved. Gilbert sees through Isabel&#x27;s schemes to prevent Pansy from becoming engaged to Warburton, but he is too late; Lord Warburton leaves Italy. Gilbert angrily slaps Isabel and steps on her dress so that she falls on the ground. Serena deeply regrets organizing the fateful union between Gilbert and Isabel.

Isabel learns that Ralph is overtaken by consumption and is on his deathbed. She asks Gilbert to let her go to England to be with her dying cousin but receives a cold and negative answer. Pansy is sent to a convent away from her lover. Isabel is pitied by Gilbert&#x27;s sister, who finally opens Isabel&#x27;s eyes, telling her that Gilbert&#x27;s first wife was childless and Pansy is, in fact, Gilbert and Serena&#x27;s daughter. Isabel finally decides to go against her husband&#x27;s wishes and leave for England. She visits Pansy and proposes to the girl to flee, but Pansy refuses, saying she wants to please her father. In the convent, Isabel also encounters Serena but proudly ignores her attempts to start a conversation. However, at the last minute before Isabel leaves, Serena runs to her - she has guessed Isabel is going to England to Ralph and reveals to Isabel that Ralph is the one who persuaded the uncle to give Isabel her fortune. On Ralph&#x27;s deathbed, Isabel tearfully confesses that he has been her best friend and she loves him. Henrietta and Caspar attend Ralph&#x27;s funeral. In the garden, Caspar tries to persuade Isabel to let go of her fear of her husband. They kiss passionately, but Isabel runs away to the house. She stops before the house door, and leans against it, looking back into the garden.

<doc id="887139" wikidata="Q9654942" url="?curid=887139" title="Pipe wrench">
<text>A pipe wrench is any of several types of wrench that are designed to turn threaded pipe and pipe fittings for assembly (tightening) or disassembly (loosening). The Stillson wrench, or Stillson-pattern wrench, is the usual form of pipe wrench, especially in the US. The Stillson name is that of the original patent holder, who licensed the design to a number of manufacturers; the patent has since expired. A different type of wrench with compound leverage often used on pipes, the plumber wrench, is also called a &quot;pipe wrench&quot; in some places.

==Description==
The Stillson wrench is an adjustable wrench (spanner) with hardened serrated teeth on its jaws. The hard teeth bite into the softer metal of the round pipe and provide the grip needed to turn a pipe, even against fair resistance. The design of the adjustable jaw, which permits a certain amount of intentional play out of square, allows it to bind on the pipe, with forward pressure on the handle pulling the jaws tighter. On some models, two leaf springs, above and below the knurled adjusting knob, help unlock the jaw when pressure on the handle of the wrench is released. 

Pipe wrenches are not intended for regular use on hex nuts or other fittings. However, if a hex nut becomes rounded (stripped) so that it cannot be moved by standard wrenches, a pipe wrench can be used to free the bolt or nut, because the pipe wrench is designed to bite into rounded metal surfaces. 

Pipe wrenches are classified by the length of the handle. They are generally available in sizes from to or larger. They are usually made of forged steel. Today, aluminium might be substituted to reduce the weight of the body of the wrench, although the teeth and jaw remain steel. Teeth and jaw kits (which also contain adjustment rings and springs) can be bought to repair broken wrenches.

== History ==
Daniel C. Stillson (1826-1899), a mechanic at the Walworth Company, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, created the first such wrench. On October 12, 1869, US patent #95,744 was issued to Stillson.

On 17 August 1888, the Swedish inventor Johan Petter Johansson (1853-1943) took out his first patent on the adjustable pipe wrench. The Swedish Patent Office issued the patent again in 1894. The idea emerged after he established his company &quot;Enköpings Mekaniska Verkstad&quot;. Back then, nut dimensions were poorly standardized, so each time a tradesman was out on a job, he needed a trolley to take a set of fixed pipe wrenches with him. Johansson&#x27;s tool could grip nuts of different dimensions.

== Pipe wrench in different countries ==

In South Africa, the terms &quot;bobbejaan spanner&quot; and &quot;baboon spanner&quot; are commonly used, especially for large pipe wrenches. &quot;Bobbejaan&quot; is the Afrikaans term for a baboon.
In Spain and Morocco, they are called &quot;grifa&quot;.

In Mexico they are known and called &quot;stillson&quot; without even using the word &quot;llave&quot; (&quot;wrench&quot;).

In Turkey they are known as &quot;English Keys&quot;.

<doc id="887140" wikidata="Q4472054" url="?curid=887140" title="A. L. Lloyd">
<text>Albert Lancaster Lloyd (29 February 1908 – 29 September 1982), usually known as A. L. Lloyd or Bert Lloyd, was an English folk singer and collector of folk songs, and as such was a key figure in the British folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s. While Lloyd is most widely known for his work with British folk music, he had a keen interest in the music of Spain, Latin America, Southeastern Europe and Australia. He recorded at least six discs of Australian Bush ballads and folk music.

Lloyd also helped establish the folk music subgenre of industrial folk music through his books, recordings, collecting and theoretical writings.

==Early life==
Lloyd was born in the Wandsworth district of London. His father was an AA Patrolman and failed smallholder. His mother sang songs around the house, and according to Lloyd, mimicked the gypsy singers that she had heard. By the age of fifteen his mother had died and his father, an ex-soldier, was a semi-invalid, and Lloyd was sent as an assisted migrant to Australia in a scheme organised by the Royal British Legion. There, from 1924 to 1930, he worked on various sheep stations in New South Wales and it was during this time that he began to write down folksongs he learned. In the outback of New South Wales he discovered that he could access the State Library and order books. His special interests being art and music, he could get a grasp of those topics without seeing a painting or hearing any music. He also bought a wind-up gramophone and began to investigate some of the classical music he had previously read about.

==Career as folklorist==
When Lloyd returned to the UK in 1935, during the Great Depression, in the absence of a permanent job he pursued his interests in studying folk music and social and economic history, doing much of his research at the British Museum; he is quoted as saying that there is &quot;nothing like unemployment for educating oneself&quot;. In 1937, he signed on board a factory whaling ship, the &quot;Southern Empress&quot;, bound for the southern whaling grounds of the Antarctic.

During this decade, Lloyd joined the Communist Party of Great Britain and was strongly influenced by the writings of the Marxist historian, A. L. Morton, particularly his 1938 book &quot;A People&#x27;s History of England&quot;. In 1937, Lloyd&#x27;s article &quot;The People&#x27;s own Poetry&quot; was published in the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; (since 1966 renamed &quot;Morning Star&quot;) newspaper.

In 1938, the BBC hired Lloyd to write a radio documentary about seafaring life, and from then on he worked as a journalist and singer. As a proponent of communism, he was staunchly opposed to Adolf Hitler, and, in 1939, was commissioned by the BBC to produce a series of programmes on the rise of Nazism. Between 1940 and 1950 he was employed as a journalist by &quot;Picture Post&quot; magazine but he left the job in an act of solidarity with one of his colleagues.

By the 1950s, Lloyd had established himself as a professional folklorist—as Colin Harper puts it &quot;in a field of one&quot;. Harper went to note that, at a time when the English folk revival was dominated by young people who wore jeans and pullovers, Lloyd was rarely seen in anything other than a suit (and a wide grin). Ewan MacColl is quoted as describing Lloyd affectionately as &quot;a walking toby jug&quot;. In 1959, Lloyd&#x27;s collaboration with Ralph Vaughan Williams, &quot;The Penguin Book of English Folk Songs&quot;, was published.

The 1956 film &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, directed by John Huston, featured Lloyd singing a sea shanty as the Pequod first sets sail. There is also a brief visual clip of him.

In the early 1960s, Lloyd became associated with an enterprise known as &quot;Centre 42&quot; which arose from Resolution 42 of the 1960 Trades Union Congress, concerning the importance of arts in the community. Centre 42 was a touring festival aimed at devolving art and culture from London to the other main working class towns of Britain. It was led by Arnold Wesker, with MacColl and Lloyd providing the musical content and Charles Parker on production. Centre 42 was important in bringing a range of folk performers to the public attention: Anne Briggs, the Ian Campbell Folk Group, The Spinners and The Watersons.

Lloyd recorded many albums of English folk music, most notably several albums of the Child Ballads with MacColl. He also published many books on folk music and related topics, including &quot;The Singing Englishman&quot;, &quot;Come All Ye Bold Miners&quot;, and &quot;Folk Song in England&quot;. He was a founder-member of Topic Records and remained as their artistic director until his death.

The accompanying book to the Topic Records 70 year anniversary boxed set &quot;Three Score and Ten&quot; includes a short biography and lists two albums he is closely associated with as classic albums, &quot;The Iron Muse&quot; and &quot;Frost and Fire&quot; by The Watersons. Track five on the second CD has Lloyd singing &quot;The Two Magicians&quot; from another album he was closely associated with, being &quot;The Bird in the Bush (Traditional Erotic Songs)&quot;.

Mark Gregory interviewed him in 1970 for the National Library of Australia, and Michael Grosvenor Myer for &quot;Folk Review&quot; magazine in September 1974.

Lloyd died at his home in Greenwich in 1982.

His version of the folk song &quot;Doodle Let Me Go (Yaller Girls)&quot; was used in the credits and trailer of the 2019 film &quot;The Lighthouse&quot;.

<text>Superman: The New Superman Adventures, commonly referred to as Superman 64, is a 1999 action-adventure game developed and published by Titus Interactive for the Nintendo 64. It is based on the television series &quot;&quot; and is the first 3D video game featuring Superman.

In the game, Lex Luthor has trapped Jimmy Olsen, Lois Lane, and Professor Hamilton in a virtual reality version of Metropolis that he created with the help of Brainiac, leaving it up to Superman to save them and dismantle the virtual world. The game shifts between outdoor levels, where the player flies through rings while rescuing civilians, and indoor levels, where the player searches for access cards, activates computers, and battles villains such as Brainiac, Mala, Metallo, Darkseid, and Parasite.

The development of &quot;Superman&quot; began in 1997 and was largely hindered by constraints between Titus and the game&#x27;s licensors, Warner Bros. and DC Comics, leaving little room to refine the gameplay. BlueSky Software attempted to redo the game for the PlayStation, but this version was ultimately canceled, as Titus&#x27;s license with Warner Bros. had expired by the time it was completed. With three E3 presentations and positive press coverage prior to its release, &quot;Superman 64&quot; achieved strong sales and favorable consumer reception; however, critical reviews were extremely negative, criticizing its unresponsive controls, technical flaws, repetitive gameplay, overuse of distance fog, and poor graphics. It is widely regarded as one of the worst video games ever made.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Superman&quot; is a three-dimensional action-adventure platform game in which the player takes on the role of the titular hero, saving the citizens of Metropolis, including Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and Professor Hamilton, from a virtual reality version of the city created by Lex Luthor. This virtual Metropolis is filled with &quot;Kryptonite fog&quot;, an apparent attempt by Luthor to diminish Superman&#x27;s abilities. However, this is actually distance fog, a technique used to mask the game&#x27;s draw distance.

In the main single-player mode, the player assumes the role of Superman, who is challenged by Luthor to complete various tasks and puzzles. Superman can fly, punch enemies, and use his super-strength to lift and carry large objects. Other superpowers, including heat vision, freeze breath, X-ray vision, super speed, and reprogramming (where Superman reprograms an enemy to help fight off other enemies), are accessible only through the collection of power-ups found in certain levels and have limited reserves. If Superman is attacked by enemies, hazards, or comes too close to Kryptonite, his health will decrease. The game ends if Superman loses all his health, requiring the player to restart the current mission. The player also faces game over if a civilian character is attacked or if the time limits imposed on various missions expire before completion.

&quot;Superman&quot; consists of fourteen levels, alternating between outdoor and indoor environments. The indoor levels involve combat, exploring environments to find access codes to locked areas, activating computers, solving puzzles to achieve objectives, and battling villains such as Mala, Metallo, Darkseid, and Brainiac, who is responsible for programming the computers that trap them in Luthor&#x27;s virtual reality. The outdoor stages consist of traveling to the next indoor mission while flying through rings and rescuing civilians from enemies and hazards. Several missions must be completed within time limits. &quot;Superman: The New Superman &quot; features three difficulty modes: Easy, Normal, and Superman. In Easy mode, the player does not need to fly through rings during the ride stages. The penultimate ride stage and penultimate regular stage are playable only in Normal and Superman modes, while the final ride stage and regular stage are accessible only in Superman mode. Despite this, it is possible to complete the game without encountering a single ring if the player starts in Easy mode, as there is an option to switch from Easy to Normal mode that skips the penultimate ride stage, and an option to switch from Normal mode to Superman mode that skips the final ride stage. The time available to complete missions also decreases as the difficulty increases.

The game features two multiplayer modes—a racing mode and a battle mode—allowing play with up to four people. In battle mode, players must defeat their opponents by throwing various weapons and items at them. In racing mode, players control a spaceship while rings are shot from the backside of one opponent.

==Development== 
Eric Caen, one of the founders of the French developer Titus Interactive, secured the rights from WB Licensing to produce a &quot;Superman&quot; game during the development of . After learning about the upcoming show in the Los Angeles offices of Titus, Caen pursued the license since no other company had shown interest. He recalled in a 2015 interview that Warner Bros. &quot;asked me three times if I was sure of what I was doing.&quot; In early 1997, Titus signed a licensing deal with Warner Bros. to develop games based on &quot;Superman: The Animated Series&quot; for the Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Game Boy. The development team for each port consisted of two programmers and six to nine artists. The Game Boy game was completed and released by the end of that year.

The Nintendo 64 game&#x27;s development lasted two years. Caen&#x27;s initial plan envisioned a style of gameplay that only &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; (1996) had attempted before, featuring a 3D open world action-adventure video game that incorporated real-time strategy elements, allowing players to genuinely behave as a superhero. As he explained, &quot;it would stretch the Nintendo 64 to its limits, feature Superman&#x27;s ability to fly and fight, and include all of his superpowers.&quot; However, this concept proved too ambitious for the Nintendo 64&#x27;s limitations. Consequently, less than ten percent of the original design made it into the final product.

Only a few days after the deal was finalized, the Warner Bros. licensing team underwent a change. According to Caen&#x27;s testimony, the new group immediately disliked Titus and the project, attempting to halt its development. Their first demand was to transform &quot;Superman&quot; into a &quot;Sim City&quot;-style game, where Superman would act as the mayor of Metropolis rather than being featured in an action game. Warner Bros. became increasingly coercive after Titus rejected this idea, disregarding any decisions made by the French developer. Often, their rationale for rejection was that Superman would never engage in the activities Titus proposed. Elements that survived, such as Superman swimming underwater, were retained only after Titus staff members presented documentation from the original &quot;Superman&quot; comics.

Several changes were mandated to ensure that Superman was portrayed positively. In addition to limiting Superman&#x27;s powers and removing destructible architecture, the game was set in a virtual world to prevent him from harming &quot;real&quot; people. Although the ring stages were initially intended as tutorial sections, they became a regular part of gameplay due to other changes. These conflicts led to a prolonged production process, where &quot;it took [Titus] months to get every single character approved,&quot; resulting in an inability to address bugs and issues related to collision detection and controls, which would later be criticized in the final product. Near the end of development, Nintendo provided technical support to Titus.

===Pre-release publicity=== 
&quot;Superman&quot; was showcased at three E3 events in 1997, 1998, and 1999. Some publications unofficially referred to the game as &quot;Superman 64&quot; since the 1997 E3 event, as evidenced by its coverage in &quot;Game Informer&quot;. The 1997 presentation did not disclose that the game took place in a virtual world but did reveal its premise: Superman attempting to save Lois and Metropolis from Lex Luthor&#x27;s dangerous creation, the Lexoskel-5000. Additionally, it showcased models of empty rooms, a concept model of Lex Luthor, and highlighted Superman&#x27;s X-ray vision power, which utilized the console&#x27;s graphical capabilities effectively. An &quot;IGN&quot; journalist covering the event found little promise in the game, stating, &quot;For a true fan, the game probably looked great because it was at least something to show, but to the casual observer or the jaded critic, the game just looked poor.&quot; However, &quot;Animation World Network&quot; was more optimistic, asserting that the game appeared to feature &quot;stunning 3D environments, various fight levels, and rescue operations.&quot; At the time of the 1997 E3 showing, the release date was scheduled for late 1997, but it was ultimately delayed.

Titus announced that &quot;Superman&quot; was approximately 85–95% complete in March 1998. However, the game faced further delays following the 1998 E3 showing due to gameplay criticisms. On August 24, Titus released 3D character models and map sheets of the levels. The magazine &quot;GamePro&quot;, describing the game as an &quot;E3 showstopper,&quot; praised its &quot;good-looking graphics&quot;.

In June 1998, &quot;GameFan&quot; published the first screenshots of completed parts of &quot;Superman&quot;, showcasing views of interiors, Metropolis, and the 3D model of Superman. The magazine expressed enthusiasm for the game, with journalist ECM noting that other staff members were &quot;drooling over these first-look shots.&quot; He suggested that the game &quot;could be one of the hotter N64 titles of the year,&quot; even with heavyweights like &quot;Zelda&quot; and &quot;Banjo&quot; on the horizon. He highlighted the game&#x27;s &quot;astounding&quot; visuals—aside from the fog in the Metropolis shots—and stated it was &quot;set to raise the bar on the N64 again&quot; with its &quot;clean textures and smooth animation.&quot; ECM also shared gameplay details, mentioning &quot;an assortment of missions numbering in the twenties&quot; and Superman&#x27;s powers like X-ray and Heat Vision, as well as the inclusion of villains like Brainiac and Bizarro. 

In July 1998, &quot;Gamers&#x27; Republic&quot; reported that &quot;Superman&quot; would consist of 15 stages where the playable character would &quot;beating up bad guys and solving puzzles while trying to find the kryptonite diffusers in each level.&quot; The publication also revealed a four-player battle mode, which it positively compared to &quot;Star Fox&quot;; it praised the level design and the incorporation of Superman&#x27;s powers.

In its August 1998 issue, &quot;Nintendo Magazine&quot; preview coverage indicated that Titus had not yet implemented the non-tutorial ring stages or the virtual world setting within the game&#x27;s plot. The premise was described as Lex Luthor trapping all of Metropolis citizens in a &quot;deadly Kryptonite fog.&quot; Despite this, the magazine expressed optimism for the final product, noting it was &quot;packed with great ideas&quot; and that the four-player mode looked promising. 

In the December issue, which had changed its name to &quot;Nintendo Official Magazine&quot;, a follow-up preview highlighted more of Superman&#x27;s abilities in the game. These included breaking through bricks, lifting cars and humans, punching, and utilizing heat vision and ice breath. The magazine also announced a North American release date of January 1999, with a spring date set for Europe. 

A press release in October 1998 revealed that the release date for &quot;Superman 64&quot; was scheduled for November 16, 1998. The announcement also detailed a &quot;huge promotional campaign&quot; that would include in-store promotions, displays, advertising across television, online, and print media. Promotional items planned for the campaign included standees, t-shirts, game footage, videotapes, and oversized boxes. 

&quot;Superman&quot; was one of only five Nintendo 64 games showcased at the 1999 Tokyo Game Show.

After the critical failure of the Nintendo 64 version, Titus entrusted BlueSky Software with the task of completely redesigning &quot;Superman&quot; for the PlayStation. The game received approval from Sony; however, the license from Warner Bros. had expired, and Titus was unable to secure a new one, resulting in the game&#x27;s cancellation in 2000. According to Caen, after Warner Bros. &quot;forced us to kill the PlayStation version,&quot; the company planned to pay Titus a litigation settlement as compensation for its abusive behavior towards the developer. A build of the game, dated June 22, 2000, was eventually uploaded to MediaFire on November 28, 2020, by Richard Evan Mandel, who announced and linked to the build&#x27;s release via a journal post on his DeviantArt page. Before the DeviantArt page was deleted, a user on the Internet Archive downloaded the build and made it available on the archive.

==Reception==

NPD Group data reported that &quot;Superman&quot; was a top-ten seller in North America during the weeks of June 1999. In July of that same year, Titus announced that &quot;Superman&quot; had become the third best-selling game for the N64. Over 500,000 units were sold. Eric Caen projected in 1998 that sales would reach around a million. Titus also reported that consumer feedback, obtained through a mail-in registration, was &quot;overwhelming[ly] positive,&quot; with &quot;more than 70% of Superman&#x27;s target audience, aged 6 to 11 years, rating the game as an &#x27;A&#x27; title&quot;. This data contradicted &quot;Superman 64&quot;″s contemporary critical reputation, which claimed it was one of the worst games of all time. Matt Casamassina of &quot;IGN&quot; suggested that it was &quot;executed so poorly that it actually serves to butcher the reputation of the prominent action hero.&quot; Casamassina speculated that the developer had not &quot;put forth any priorities for this title other than to finish it,&quot; commenting that the game had a &quot;rushed, careless feel.&quot; Critics from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; noted the wasted potential of a game based on the &quot;Superman&quot; animated series, citing a &quot;great story, interesting characters, plenty of villains,&quot; and the opportunity to fight criminals in 3D landscapes. The multiplayer modes received slightly better reviews than the single-player story mode, although issues with slowdown and difficulty controlling the space pod were noted.

The controls were criticized for being confusing and difficult to use. Commands for various actions were reported to be either unresponsive or inconsistent, particularly regarding flying, landing, and picking up objects. Tim Weaver of &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; complained that &quot;the only way to &quot;stop&quot; flying is to crash into a solid object, preferably a wall,&quot; and that &quot;you always have to press forward to go forward, even if you&#x27;re facing into the camera.&quot; Conversely, &quot;Nintendo Magazine System&quot;, the official Nintendo magazine of Australia, countered these complaints about the flying controls, reasoning that they were simple if the player read the instruction manual. Other technical problems were reported to be common, including bugs, unfavorable camera angles, poor enemy AI, broken frame rates, clipping of environments and objects, and inadequate collision detection.

&quot;AllGame&quot;″s Scott Alan Marriott derogatorily described the gameplay as consisting of &quot;foggy, empty outdoor levels and indoor levels that seem out of place.&quot; Some critics found the missions too easy, unengaging, and nonsensical; &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot;″s John Sczepaniak even went so far as to call them &quot;obscenely stupid&quot;. He and other critics also panned the fights with enemies, which were viewed as ridiculous, with Sczepaniak writing that &quot;melee combat is slow, awkward, and imprecise, leading to much flailing of limbs.&quot; The ring missions were described by Shaun Conlin of &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; as the perfect blend of &quot;monotonous and difficult,&quot; due to their limited margins for error and time constraints. Only a few reviewers suggested that &quot;Superman 64&quot;″s gameplay might have been conceptually good, with &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; stating, &quot;this game&#x27;s got great ideas, but it&#x27;s a super disappointment.&quot; &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; described the missions as action-packed and diverse, while &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; claimed that it was ambitious for a &quot;Superman&quot; game to attempt to be more than just &quot;a brawler with some flight and superpowers thrown in.&quot; Critics found certain concepts unsuitable for a game centered around the titular hero, particularly the mechanic of flying through rings. Conlin noted that the limitations of lives and the need for power-ups were problematic for an invincible superhero with unlimited power.

The graphics were condemned as &quot;basic&quot; and subpar for a Nintendo 64 game released in 1999. The most frequent criticism centered on the excessive distance fog. &quot;Mega Fun&quot; claimed that the fog was an excuse for the developers not to fully utilize the Nintendo 64 console, while Hugh Norton-Smith of &quot;Hyper&quot; remarked that the fog would force players to &quot;pre-empt approaching buildings in order to avoid colliding with them&quot;. The textures were criticized as nearly non-existent and described as &quot;repetitive,&quot; &quot;flat,&quot; and &quot;featureless&quot; for a virtual world setting. Sczepaniak noted that the flat textures of Metropolis made it resemble a Mode 7 background in a Super NES game. &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; highlighted that the game&#x27;s levels lacked adequate lighting, shadows, or a clear perspective, making it difficult for players to judge distances between characters and objects in the environment. Jevon Jenkins of &quot;Game Industry&quot; pointed out that this issue made it challenging to gauge the distance between Superman and enemies, creating an artificial difficulty in combat, which was exacerbated by poor camera angles. He was also dissatisfied with Metropolis&#x27; lack of close-up details &quot;that play a big part in the life of a city.&quot; Reviews also criticized the character animations, including those of Superman, with &quot;AllGame&quot;″s Scott Alan Marriott specifically dismissing Superman&#x27;s punching and flying animations. &quot;Total N64&quot; critic Lee described the intro cinematic as &quot;like a scene from a C64 game in 1985,&quot; and remarked that &quot;the sharp edges of the polygons gave Superman &#x27;pixie&#x27; boots.&quot;

The audio was also criticized. Reviewers, including Joe Fielder from &quot;GameSpot&quot;, noted the repetitiveness of the soundtrack, stating it &quot;would be considered bad for the SNES&quot;. He also remarked that &quot;the sparse voice work even changes at one point, from Man of Steel actors to someone who sounds nothing like the lead of the show&quot;. As Norton-Smith proclaimed, &quot;the soundtrack is more than capable of causing spontaneous aneurysms at 50 paces, and the handful of canned smashing moves do a great job of driving home the horror&quot;. Chris Johnston of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; found the graphics &quot;semi-decent,&quot; albeit &quot;oddly letterboxed,&quot; while Marriott appreciated them for being &quot;colorful&quot; and &quot;simple&quot;. Some reviewers praised the visuals for their closeness to the animated series, as well as the inclusion of its original voice actors. Weaver highlighted Lex Luthor&#x27;s laugh, which &quot;almost made up for &quot;Superman&quot; being so hideous&quot;. The music received lukewarm appreciation, with &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; noting its atmospheric quality but criticizing its lack of stylistic variation throughout the game.

Statements regarding &quot;Superman 64&quot; as one of the worst video games of all time have persisted in later years. The game has appeared on all-time worst lists from various publications, including &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (2013), &quot;The Guardian&quot; (2015), &quot;SVG.com&quot; (2020), and topped the lists of &quot;GameSpy&quot; (2004) and GameTrailers (2006). It has also appeared on worst-of-decade lists from &quot;Filter&quot; and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. It continues to be recognized as the all-time worst of the &quot;Superman&quot; video games, which are generally not well-received. As of 2017, &quot;Superman 64&quot; holds the Guinness World Record for the lowest-rated superhero game, citing its Gamerankings aggregate score of 22.9%. In a report from 2018, &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted, &quot;&quot;Superman 64&quot; has cultivated a fanbase of curious masochists eager to see how bad it really is. Twitch and YouTube host plenty of videos dedicated to the anti-glory of &quot;Superman 64&quot;, some of them created by people who were barely born when it was released.&quot; &quot;Superman 64&quot; ranked number 11 in an &quot;Uproxx&quot; list of the top 100 Nintendo 64 games, based on 250,849 user ratings from various websites. Publication writer Derrick Rossignol expressed confusion over the ranking: &quot;I attribute that to users ironically giving the game many positive ratings over the years. Thankfully, though, those shenanigans don&#x27;t seem prevalent in the data, and Superman is the only notable head-scratcher that I noticed.&quot;

<text>A queen regnant (: queens regnant) is a female monarch, equivalent in rank, title and position to a king. She reigns &quot;suo jure&quot; (in her own right) over a realm known as a kingdom; as opposed to a queen consort, who is married to a reigning king; or a queen &quot;regent&quot;, who is the guardian of a child monarch and rules &quot;pro tempore&quot; in the child&#x27;s stead or instead of her husband who is absent from the realm, be it in sharing power or in ruling alone. A queen &quot;regnant&quot; is sometimes called a woman king. A princess, duchess, or grand duchess regnant is a female monarch who reigns &quot;suo jure&quot; over a principality or (grand) duchy; an empress regnant is a female monarch who reigns &quot;suo jure&quot; over an empire.

A queen regnant possesses all the powers, such as they may be, of the monarchy, whereas a queen consort or queen regent shares her spouse&#x27;s or child&#x27;s rank and titles but does not share the sovereignty of her spouse or child. The husband of a queen regnant traditionally does not share the queen regnant&#x27;s rank, title, or sovereignty and usually holds a lower princely title. However, the concept of a king consort is not unheard of in both contemporary and historical periods.

A queen dowager or empress dowager is the widow of a king or emperor; a queen mother is a queen dowager who is also the mother of a reigning sovereign.

Since the abdication of Margrethe II of Denmark on 14 January 2024, there are currently no female sovereigns in the world. This is the first time this has been the case in over 200 years.

== History ==
The oldest attested queen regnant was the Pharaoh Sobekneferu from the 18th/17th century BC.

In Ancient Africa, Ancient Persia, Asian and Pacific cultures, and in some European countries, female monarchs have been given the title &quot;king&quot; or its equivalent, such as &quot;pharaoh&quot;, when gender is irrelevant to the office, or else have used the masculine form of the word in languages that have grammatical gender as a way to classify nouns. The Roman Empress Irene of Athens sometimes titled herself &quot;basileus&quot; (βασιλεύς), &#x27;emperor&#x27;, rather than &quot;basilissa&quot; (βασίλισσα), &#x27;empress&#x27;, and Mary of Hungary was crowned as &quot;Rex Hungariae&quot;, &quot;King of Hungary&quot; in 1382.

Among the Davidic Monarchs of the Kingdom of Judah, there is mentioned a single queen regnant, Athaliah, though the Hebrew Bible regards her negatively as a usurper. The much later Hasmonean Queen Salome Alexandra (Shlom Tzion) was highly popular.

Accession of a queen regnant occurs as a nation&#x27;s order of succession permits. Methods of succession to kingdoms, tribal chiefships, and such include nomination (the reigning monarch or a council names an heir), primogeniture (in which the children of a monarch or chief have preference in order of birth from eldest to youngest), and ultimogeniture (in which the children have preference in the reverse order of birth from youngest to eldest). The scope of succession may be matrilineal, patrilineal, or both; or, rarely, open to general election when necessary. The right of succession may be open to men and women, or limited to men only or to women only.

The most typical succession in European monarchies from the Late Middle Ages until the late 20th century was male-preference primogeniture: the order of succession ranked the sons of the monarch in order of their birth, followed by the daughters. Historically, many realms like France and the Holy Roman Empire forbade succession by women or through a female line in accordance with the Salic law, and nine countries still do, such countries being Japan, Morocco, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Brunei, Liechtenstein, Bhutan. No queen regnant ever ruled France, for example. Only one woman, Maria Theresa, ruled Austria. As noted in the list below of widely-known ruling queens, many reigned in European monarchies.

A similar system was practised in many of the kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent from the Middle Ages to the Indian independence movement. In many of these kingdoms, adoption was allowed from a relative if a monarch did not have children, and the adopted child could succeed to the throne at the death of the monarch. Often, the wife or mother of a childless king were allowed to succeed to the throne as well and allowed to rule as queen regnants in their own right, until their death, after which the throne passed to the next closest relative. Prominent examples from Indian history include Queen Didda of Kashmir, Razia Sultana, Rudrama Devi, Keladi Chennamma, Ahilyabai Holkar, Velu Nachiyar, Queen Gowri Lakshmi Bayi and Qudsia Begum of Bhopal.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom amended their laws of succession to absolute primogeniture (in which the children of a monarch or chief have preference in order of birth from eldest to youngest regardless of gender). In some cases, the change does not take effect during the lifetimes of people already in the line of succession at the time the law was passed.

In 2011, the United Kingdom and the 15 other Commonwealth realms agreed to remove the rule of male-preference primogeniture. Once the necessary legislation was passed, this means that had Prince William had a daughter first, a younger son would not have become heir apparent.

In 2015, Elizabeth II became the longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state in world history. She was the longest serving incumbent head of state and monarch from 2016 until her death on 8 September 2022.

Following Elizabeth&#x27;s death, Margrethe II of Denmark became the only remaining female monarch of a sovereign state in the world, until her abdication on 14 January 2024. This made it the first time that no female sovereigns have reigned in over 200 years. On the other hand, there are non-sovereign queens, such as Rain Queen Masalanabo Modjadji VII and Māori Queen Ngā Wai Hono i te Pō, who currently reign.

Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant (monarchy of Belgium), and Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange (monarchy of the Netherlands) are currently heirs apparent to the thrones of their respective monarchies, along with Leonor, Princess of Asturias, who is the heir presumptive of the throne of Spain. All four are therefore liable to become queens regnant following the end of the current reigns.

=== East Asia ===
Because there is no feminine equivalent to king and emperor in East Asian languages, different titles are used for female monarchs and female consorts. The titles of female monarchs in East Asia are translated directly as &quot;female king&quot; or &quot;female emperor&quot; and the titles of female consorts in East Asia are translated directly as &quot;king&#x27;s consort&quot; or &quot;emperor&#x27;s consort&quot;. So, the titles of female monarchs in East Asia are the same as those of male monarchs, just indicating that they are women.

In China the term &quot;nǚhuángdì&quot; (女皇帝, &quot;female emperor&quot;), abbreviated as &quot;nǚhuáng&quot; (女皇), has been used for three empresses regnant to assume the title of &quot;huángdì&quot;: Daughter of Xiaoming, Chen Shuozhen and Wu Zetian, because the title &quot;huánghòu&quot; (皇后, &quot;emperor&#x27;s consort&quot;) means only an empress consort. The term &quot;nǚwáng&quot; (女王, &quot;female king&quot;) was also used for queens regnant of of the tribe Sumpa and it is different from the title &quot;wánghòu&quot; (王后, &quot;king&#x27;s consort&quot;) which means a queen consort.

In Korea, the term &quot;yeowang&quot; (Hangul: 여왕, Hanja: 女王, &quot;female king&quot;) was developed to refer to three queens regnant of Silla: Seondeok, Jindeok and Jinseong, because the title &quot;wangbi&quot; (Hangul: 왕비, Hanja: 王妃, &quot;king&#x27;s consort&quot;) means only a queen consort. The term &quot;yeoje&quot; (Hangul: 여제, Hanja: 女帝, &quot;female emperor&quot;) was also used for Yi Hae-won, the titular empress regnant of Korean Empire because the title &quot;hwanghu&quot; (Hangul: 황후, Hanja: 皇后, &quot;emperor&#x27;s consort&quot;) means only an empress consort.

Although Vietnam is a country in Southeast Asia, it used the royal titles of East Asia. The title as a queen regnant of Trưng Trắc was &quot;Nữ vương&quot; (chữ Hán: 女王, &quot;female king&quot;) and the title as an empress regnant of Lý Chiêu Hoàng was &quot;Nữ hoàng&quot; (chữ Hán: 女皇, &quot;female emperor&quot;), and they are different from the titles of female consorts.

In Japan, the title used for two queens regnant of Yamatai: Himiko and Toyo was &quot;joō&quot; (女王, &quot;female king&quot;) and it is different from the title &quot;ōhi&quot; (王妃, &quot;king&#x27;s consort&quot;) which means only a queen consort. The term &quot;jotei&quot; (女帝, &quot;female emperor&quot;) or &quot;josei tennō&quot; (女性天皇, &quot;female heavenly emperor&quot;) has been used for empresses regnant of Japan because the title &quot;kōgō&quot; (皇后, &quot;emperor&#x27;s consort&quot;) means only an empress consort.

Although the Chrysanthemum Throne of Japan is currently barred to women following the Imperial Household Law (Emperor Naruhito&#x27;s daughter Princess Aiko cannot accede to the Chrysanthemum Throne), this has not always been the case; throughout Japanese history, there have been eight empresses regnant. The Japanese imperial succession debate became a significant political issue during the early 2000s, as no male children had been born to the Imperial House of Japan since 1965. Prime Minister Junichirō Koizumi pledged to present parliament with a bill to allow women to ascend the Imperial Throne, but he withdrew this after the birth of Prince Hisahito (Naruhito&#x27;s nephew) in 2006.

<text>Barbara Lynn Herzstein, better known as Barbara Hershey (born February 5, 1948), is an American actress. In a career spanning more than 50 years, she has played a variety of roles on television and in cinema in several genres, including westerns and comedies. She began acting at age 17 in 1965 but did not achieve widespread critical acclaim until the 1980s. By that time, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; referred to her as &quot;one of America&#x27;s finest actresses&quot;.

Hershey won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries/TV Film for her role in &quot;A Killing in a Small Town&quot; (1990). She received Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Mary Magdalene in &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988) and for her role in &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1996). For the latter film, she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and won the Los Angeles Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress. She has won two Best Actress awards at the Cannes Film Festival for her roles in &quot;Shy People&quot; (1987) and &quot;A World Apart&quot; (1988). She was featured in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986), for which she was nominated for the British Academy Film Award for Best Supporting Actress and Garry Marshall&#x27;s melodrama &quot;Beaches&quot; (1988), and she earned a second British Academy Film Award nomination for Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s &quot;Black Swan&quot; (2010).

Establishing a reputation early in her career as a hippie, Hershey experienced conflict between her personal life and her acting goals. Her career suffered a decline during a six-year relationship with actor David Carradine, with whom she had a child. She experimented with a change in stage name to Barbara Seagull. During this time, her personal life was highly publicized and ridiculed. Her acting career was not well established until she separated from Carradine and changed her stage name back to Hershey. In 1990, later in her career, it was reported that she began to keep her personal life private.

==Early life==
Barbara Lynn Herzstein was born in Hollywood, the daughter of Arnold Nathan Herzstein, a horse-racing columnist, and Melrose Herzstein (née Moore). Her father&#x27;s parents were Jewish emigrants from Hungary and Russia, while her mother, a native of Arkansas, was a Presbyterian of Scots-Irish descent.

The youngest of three children, Barbara always wanted to be an actress, and her family nicknamed her &quot;Sarah Bernhardt&quot;. She was shy in school and so quiet that people thought she was deaf. By the age of ten, she proved herself to be an &quot;A&quot; student. Her high-school drama coach helped her find an agent, and in 1965, at age 17, she landed a role on Sally Field&#x27;s television series &quot;Gidget&quot;. Barbara said that she found Field to be very supportive of her in her first acting role. According to &quot;The New York Times All Movie Guide&quot;, Barbara graduated from Hollywood High School in 1966, but David Carradine, in his autobiography, said she dropped out of high school after she began acting.

==Career==
===1960s===
Hershey&#x27;s acting debut, two episodes of &quot;Gidget&quot;, was followed by the short-lived television series &quot;The Monroes&quot; (1966), which also featured Michael Anderson Jr. By this point, she had adopted the stage name &quot;Barbara Hershey&quot;. Although Hershey said the series helped her career, she expressed some frustration with her role, saying: &quot;One week I was strong, the next, weak&quot;. While on the series, Hershey garnered several other roles, including one in Doris Day&#x27;s final feature film, &quot;With Six You Get Eggroll&quot;.

In 1968, Hershey worked in the 1969 Glenn Ford Western &quot;Heaven with a Gun&quot;. On the set, she met and began a romantic relationship with actor David Carradine, who later starred in the television series &quot;Kung Fu&quot; (see Personal life). In the same year, she acted in the controversial drama &quot;Last Summer&quot;, which was based on Evan Hunter&#x27;s eponymous novel. In this film, Hershey played Sandy, the &quot;heavy&quot; who influences two young men (played by Bruce Davison and Richard Thomas) to rape another girl, Rhoda (played by Catherine Burns). Though the film, directed by Frank Perry, received an X rating for the graphic rape scene, Burns earned a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her performance.

During the filming of &quot;Last Summer,&quot; a seagull was killed. &quot;In one scene,&quot; Hershey explained, &quot;I had to throw the bird in the air to make her fly. We had to reshoot the scene over and over again. I could tell the bird was tired. Finally, when the scene was finished, the director, Frank Perry, told me the bird had broken her neck on the last throw.&quot; Hershey felt responsible for the bird&#x27;s death and changed her stage name to &quot;Seagull&quot; as a tribute to the creature. &quot;I felt her spirit enter me,&quot; she later explained. &quot;It was the only moral thing to do.&quot; The name change was not positively received. When she was offered a part opposite Timothy Bottoms in &quot;The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder&quot; (1974) (or &quot;Vrooder&#x27;s Hooch&quot;), Hershey had to forfeit half her salary, $25,000, to be billed under the name &quot;Seagull&quot; because the producers were not in favor of the billing.

===1970s===
In 1970, Hershey played Tish Grey in &quot;The Baby Maker&quot;, a film that explored surrogate motherhood. Criticizing the directing and writing of James Bridges, critic Shirley Rigby said of the &quot;bizarre&quot; film, &quot;Only the performances in the film save it from being a total travesty.&quot; Rigby went on to say, &quot;Barbara Hershey is a great little actress, much, much more than just another pretty face.&quot;

Hershey once said that starring in &quot;Boxcar Bertha&quot; (1972) &quot;was the most fun I ever had on a movie.&quot; The film, co-starring Hershey&#x27;s domestic partner, David Carradine, and produced by Roger Corman, was Martin Scorsese&#x27;s first Hollywood picture. Shot in six weeks on a budget of $600,000, &quot;Boxcar Bertha&quot; was intended to be a period crime drama similar to Corman&#x27;s &quot;Bloody Mama&quot; (1970) or &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967). Although Corman publicized it as an exploitation piece with plenty of sex and violence, Scorsese&#x27;s influence made it &quot;something much more&quot;. Roger Ebert, of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, wrote of the film&#x27;s direction, &quot;Martin Scorsese has gone for mood and atmosphere more than for action, and his violence is always blunt and unpleasant—never liberating and exhilarating, as the New Violence is supposed to be.&quot; A pictorial recreating sexually explicit scenes from the movie appeared in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in 1972.

Hershey&#x27;s experience with Scorsese was extended to another major role for her 16 years later in &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988) as Mary Magdalene. During the filming of &quot;Boxcar Bertha&quot;, Hershey had introduced Scorsese to the Nikos Kazantzakis novel on which the latter film was based. That collaboration resulted in an Academy Award nomination for the director and a Golden Globe nod for Hershey.

By the mid-1970s, Hershey concluded, &quot;I&#x27;ve been so tied up with David [Carradine] that people have forgotten that I am me. I spend 50 percent of my time working with David.&quot; She had, in 1974, guest-starred in a two-part episode of Carradine&#x27;s television series &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. She played, under the direction of Carradine, a love interest to his character, Kwai Chang Caine, during his time at the Shaolin temple. She also appeared in two of Carradine&#x27;s independent directorial projects, &quot;You and Me&quot; (1975) and &quot;Americana&quot; (1983), both of which had been filmed in 1973. Her father, Arnold Herzstein, also appeared in &quot;Americana&quot;.

She publicly acknowledged the desire to be recognized in her own right. Later, in 1974, she did just that, winning a gold medal at the Atlanta Film Festival for her role in the Dutch-produced film &quot;Love Comes Quietly&quot;.

Later in the decade, Hershey starred with Charlton Heston in &quot;The Last Hard Men&quot; (1976). She hoped the film would revive her career after the damage she felt it had suffered while she was with Carradine, believing that the hippie label she had been given was a career impediment. By this time, she had shed Carradine and her &quot;Seagull&quot; pseudonym. Throughout the rest of the 1970s, however, she was appearing in made-for-TV movies that were described as &quot;forgettable&quot;, like &quot;Flood!&quot; (1976), &quot;Sunshine Christmas&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Glitter Palace&quot; (1977), in which she played a lesbian.

===1980s===
Hershey landed a role in Richard Rush&#x27;s &quot;The Stunt Man&quot; (1980), marking a return to the big screen after four years and earning her critical praise. Hershey felt that she would be forever in debt to Rush for fighting with financiers to allow her a part in that film. She also felt &quot;The Stunt Man&quot; was an important transition for her, from playing girls to playing women.

Some of the &quot;women roles&quot; that followed &quot;The Stunt Man&quot; included the horror movie &quot;The Entity&quot; (1982); Philip Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983), in which she played Glennis Yeager, wife of test pilot Chuck Yeager; and &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984), in which she shot Robert Redford&#x27;s character, inspired by a real-life incident where Ruth Ann Steinhagen shot ballplayer Eddie Waitkus. For the role of Harriet Bird, Hershey had chosen a particular hat as her &quot;anchor&quot;. Director Barry Levinson disagreed with her choice, but she insisted on wearing it. Levinson later cast Hershey as the wife of Danny DeVito&#x27;s character in the comedy &quot;Tin Men&quot; (1987).

In 1986, Hershey left her native California and moved with her son to Manhattan. Three days later, she met briefly with Woody Allen, who offered her the role of Lee in &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986). In addition to a Manhattan apartment, Hershey bought an antique home in rural Connecticut. The Allen picture won three Academy Awards and a Golden Globe. The film also earned Hershey a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She described her part as &quot;a wonderful gift&quot;.

Hershey followed &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; with back-to-back wins for Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival for &quot;Shy People&quot; and for her appearance as anti-apartheid activist Diana Roth in &quot;A World Apart&quot; (1988). Her character in the latter film was based on Ruth First. Also in the 1980s, she portrayed Errol Flynn&#x27;s first wife, actress Lili Damita, in the TV movie adaptation of &quot;My Wicked, Wicked Ways: The Legend of Errol Flynn&quot; (1985), which was based on Flynn&#x27;s autobiography. She also played the love interest to Gene Hackman&#x27;s character in the basketball film &quot;Hoosiers&quot; (1986).

Barbara Cloud of the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; gave attribution to Hershey for starting a trend when she had collagen injected into her lips for her role in &quot;Beaches&quot; (1988). Humorist Erma Bombeck said of the movie, which also starred Bette Midler, &quot;I have no idea what &quot;Beaches&quot; was all about. All I could focus on was Barbara Hershey&#x27;s lips. She looked like she stopped off at a gas station and someone said, &#x27;Your lips are down 30 pounds. Better let me hit &#x27;em with some air.

===1990s===
In 1990, Hershey won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Special for her role as Candy Morrison in &quot;A Killing in a Small Town&quot;, which was based on Candy Montgomery&#x27;s acquittal for the death of Betty Gore. Montgomery had killed Gore on Friday, June 13, 1980, in Gore&#x27;s Wylie, Texas, home, by hitting her 41 times with an ax. The jury determined that she did so in self-defense. In preparation for the part, Hershey had a phone conversation with Montgomery. Many of the names of the real-life principals in the case were changed for the movie. The film&#x27;s alternative title was &quot;Evidence of Love&quot;, the name of a 1984 book about the case.

Also in 1990, Hershey drew upon what Woody Allen once described as her &quot;erotic overtones&quot;, portraying a woman who falls in love with her much younger nephew by marriage, played by Keanu Reeves, in the comedic &quot;Tune in Tomorrow&quot;.

In 1991, Hershey played Hanna Trout, the wife of the title character in &quot;Paris Trout&quot; (1991), a made-for-cable television movie. In this Showtime production, Hershey collaborated again with &quot;A Killing in a Small Town&quot; director Stephen Gyllenhaal to play a woman who has an affair with her husband&#x27;s lawyer. Her husband, an abusive bigot (played by Dennis Hopper), is on trial for murdering a young African American girl. The film, which was based on Pete Dexter&#x27;s 1988 National Book Award-winning novel, featured Hopper and Hershey enacting a graphic rape scene that the actress found difficult to view. The picture was described as a &quot;dramatic reach deep into the dark hollows of racism, abuse and murder.&quot; &quot;Paris Trout&quot; was nominated for five Prime Time Emmy Awards, including nods for both Hershey and Hopper.

Later in the year, Hershey played an attorney defending her college roommate for the murder of her husband in the suspenseful whodunit &quot;Defenseless&quot; (1991).

Because of her frequent television appearances, by the end of 1991, Hershey was accused of &quot;selling out to the small screen&quot;. In 1992, Hershey appeared with Jane Alexander in the ABC miniseries &quot;Stay the Night&quot; (1992), prompting Associated Press writer Jerry Buck to write, &quot;Barbara Hershey is a person who jumps back and forth between features and television very easily.&quot; She starred in another TV miniseries in 1993, succeeding Anjelica Huston as Clara Allen in the sequel series &quot;Return to Lonesome Dove.&quot; She was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award for another TV appearance, &quot;The Staircase&quot; (1998). Between 1999 and 2000, she played Dr. Francesca Alberghetti in 22 season-six episodes of the medical TV drama &quot;Chicago Hope.&quot;

Hershey co-starred with Joe Pesci as a nightclub owner in the film drama &quot;The Public Eye&quot; (1992) and as the estranged wife of a homicidal Michael Douglas in the thriller &quot;Falling Down&quot; (1993). Among the other feature films in which she appeared during the 1990s was Jane Campion&#x27;s adaptation of the Henry James novel &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1996). Hershey earned an Oscar nomination and won the Best Supporting Actress award from the National Society of Film Critics for her role as Madame Serena Merle in that picture. In 1995, &quot;Last of the Dogmen&quot;, co-starring Tom Berenger, was released through Savoy Pictures. In 1999, Hershey starred in an independent film called &quot;Drowning on Dry Land&quot;; during production she met co-star Naveen Andrews, with whom she began a romantic relationship that lasted until 2010.

===2000s===
In 2001, Hershey appeared in the psychological thriller &quot;Lantana&quot;. She was the only American in a mostly Australian cast, which included Kerry Armstrong, Anthony LaPaglia, and Geoffrey Rush. Film writer Sheila Johnson said the film was &quot;one of the best to emerge from Australia in years.&quot; Another thriller followed: &quot;11:14&quot; (2003) also featured Rachael Leigh Cook, Patrick Swayze, Hilary Swank, and Colin Hanks. In 2002, she appeared in a two-scene cameo role as the Contessa in the mini-series, Daniel Deronda.

Hershey continued to appear on television during the 2000s, including a season on the series &quot;The Mountain&quot;. In 2008, she replaced Megan Follows in the role of Anne Shirley in &quot;Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning&quot;, the fourth in a series of made-for-TV films based on the character.

===2010s===
Hershey appeared as an American actress, Mrs. Hubbard, in an adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; for the British television series &quot;Poirot&quot; (starring David Suchet), which aired in the United States on Public Broadcast Service in July 2010. Also in 2010, Hershey co-starred in Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s acclaimed psychological thriller &quot;Black Swan&quot; (2010) opposite Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis. The following year, she co-starred in the James Wan horror film &quot;Insidious&quot; (2011). From 2012 to 2013, she had a recurring role in the first two seasons of ABC&#x27;s hit drama &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; as Cora, the Queen of Hearts and mother of the Evil Queen. In 2014, she reprised the role in one episode of the show&#x27;s spin-off &quot;Once Upon a Time in Wonderland&quot;. In 2015, she once more reprised the role when she returned to the show for an episode of its fourth season, and in 2016, she appeared again for two episodes of the show&#x27;s fifth season, most notably its landmark 100th episode.

In A&amp;E&#x27;s series &quot;Damien&quot;, Hershey portrayed series regular Ann Rutledge, the world&#x27;s most powerful woman, who has been given the task to make sure Damien fulfills his destiny as the Antichrist. The role marks Hershey&#x27;s most recent TV gig following &quot;Once Upon a Time, The Mountain, Chicago Hope&quot;, and Lifetime&#x27;s &quot;Left to Die&quot; TV movie.

===2020s===
Hershey&#x27;s more recent films include &quot;The Manor&quot; (2021) and &quot;9 Bullets&quot; (2022).

==Personal life==

In 1968, Hershey met David Carradine while they were working on &quot;Heaven with a Gun&quot;. The pair began a domestic relationship that lasted until 1975. Carradine said that during the rape scene in that movie, he cracked one of Barbara&#x27;s ribs. They appeared in other films together including Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Boxcar Bertha&quot;. In 1972, the couple posed together in a nude &quot;Playboy&quot; spread, recreating some sex scenes from &quot;Boxcar Bertha&quot;.

On October 6, 1972, Hershey gave birth to their son, Free, who changed his name to Tom when he was nine years old in 1982. The relationship fell apart around the time of Carradine&#x27;s 1974 burglary arrest, after he had begun an affair with Season Hubley, who had guest-starred in &quot;Kung Fu&quot;.

During this period, Hershey changed her stage name to &quot;Seagull&quot;. In 1979, a blunt newspaper article from the Knight News Service referenced this period of her life, saying of her acting career that &quot;it looked as if she blew it.&quot; The article referred to Hershey as a &quot;kook&quot; and stated that she was frequently &quot;high on something&quot;. In addition to that criticism, she had been ostracized for breast-feeding her son during an appearance on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, and for breast-feeding him beyond the age of two years.

She said that this period of her life hurt her career: &quot;Producers wouldn&#x27;t see me because I had a reputation for using drugs and being undependable. I never used drugs at all and I have always been serious about my acting career.&quot; After splitting up with Carradine, she changed her stage name back to &quot;Hershey&quot;, explaining that she had told the story of why she adopted the name &quot;Seagull&quot; so many times that it had lost its meaning.

By the time Hershey was 42 in 1990, she was described by columnist Luaina Lee as a &quot;private person who was mired in some heavy publicity when she first became a professional actress.&quot; Yardena Arar, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot;, confirmed that Hershey had become a private person by 1990.

On August 8, 1992, Hershey married artist Stephen Douglas. The ceremony took place at her home in Oxford, Connecticut, where the only guests were their two mothers and Hershey&#x27;s then 19-year-old son, Tom (né Free) Carradine. The couple separated and divorced one year after the wedding.

Hershey began dating actor Naveen Andrews in 1999. During a brief separation in 2005, Andrews fathered a child with another woman. In May 2010, after Andrews won sole custody of his son, the couple announced that they had ended their 10-year relationship six months earlier.

<doc id="887154" wikidata="Q1675140" url="?curid=887154" title="Ray Jardine">
<text>Ray Jardine (born in 1944) is an American rock climber and rock-climbing equipment innovator, who specialized in traditional climbing and big wall climbing. In 1977, Jardine made the first free ascent of &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, which was the first-ever consensus route at the grade of in climbing history. In 1979, with Bill Price, he became the first to free climb the &quot;West Face&quot; of El Capitan in Yosemite Valley. 

Jardine is noted for inventing and developing the spring-loaded camming devices (SLCDs, also called &quot;Friends&quot;) with the late Mark Vallance, which revolutionized traditional climbing in the late 1970s. He is also noted for his major contributions to the ultralight backpacking community through his books and his &quot;make-it-yourself&quot; gear company, Ray-Way Products.

==Early life==
Born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, as a youth, Jardine climbed Colorado&#x27;s Pikes Peak dozens of times, mostly solo, and with the Boy Scouts of America. In 1959, Jardine achieved Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America). During his Junior and Senior years (1959-1961) at General William J. Palmer High School in Colorado Springs, Jardine competed in Gymnastics on the Trampoline. He worked part-time after school at his family&#x27;s plumbing business.

In 1963, at the age of 19, Jardine took a summer job in Yellowstone National Park, and enrolled in his first rock climbing class with instructor Barry Corbet (member of the 1963 Mount Everest expedition), in Grand Teton National Park. In the fall of that year, Jardine enrolled at Northrop University in Los Angeles, California.

During the three years of his formal education at Northrop, Jardine worked evenings as a draftsman at North American Aviation in Los Angeles, California. In the spring of 1967 Jardine graduated from Northrop University with a degree in Aerospace Engineering.

==Professional life==
Immediately following his graduation from Northrop University in 1967, Jardine was hired by Martin Marietta as a specialist in computer-simulated space-flight mechanics, shaping trajectories for earth satellite and interplanetary missions.

==Outdoor sports career==

===Rock climbing===
He began his climbing career in 1963 in the Tetons and climbed in Eldorado Canyon State Park near Boulder, Colorado during the 1960s.

Jardine became active in Yosemite around 1970, and during the 1970s he materially pushed traditional climbing standards in Yosemite by creating new climbing routes that were of a grade never seen before. In 1977, Jardine made the first free ascent of &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, which was the first-ever consensus route at the grade of in climbing history. He used his new SLCDs on the route.

===Sailing and SCUBA===

In 1982, Ray and his wife Jenny sailed around the world in three years aboard their 41-foot ketch &quot;Suka&quot; (an acronym for &quot;Seeking UnKnown Adventures&quot;). During the voyage, they spent six months scuba diving and snorkeling in the Caribbean. Ray is a Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) certified diver.

===Hiking===
In 1991 he discussed ideas related to backpacking with the publication of his &quot;PCT Hikers Handbook&quot;, which described hiking the entire Pacific Crest Trail in a much shorter time, using homemade lightweight gear and techniques including early start times with longer days and more mileage at a slower pace. The book was revised and retitled in 1999 as &quot;Beyond Backpacking&quot;, and revised and retitled again in 2009 as &quot;Trail Life&quot;.

In 1998, according to former GoLite owner Kim Coupounas, it was Ray Jardine who designed the original 12 lightweight backpacking products offered by the startup company, which had a royalty arrangement with Jardine in its early years.

===Polar skiing===
Starting on November 11, 2006, at the Patriot Hills Base Camp on Antarctica, Ray and his wife Jenny skied to the South Pole. They pulled sleds containing their gear and supplies. They traveled for 57 days, covered 750 miles, and reached the South Pole on January 8, 2007.

<text>Wilfred Le Bouthillier (born May 12, 1978) is an Acadian singer from the town of Tracadie-Sheila, New Brunswick, and the winner of both the 2003 edition of &quot;Star Académie&quot;, a French Canadian reality show for aspiring singers, and the 2021 edition of &quot;Chanteurs masqués&quot;, the French Canadian adaptation of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;, along with Marie-Élaine Thibert.

==Life==
He is known simply by his first name, Wilfred. His debut album &quot;Wilfred Le Bouthillier&quot; was released in the autumn of 2003. Produced with the assistance of Cajun singer Zachary Richard, it proved to be an enviable success, selling over 200,000 copies. This is exceptional for a French Canadian artist in Canada. By way of comparison, this would be equivalent to selling more than 8 million copies of an English-language album in the United States.

Among his awards and distinctions, Wilfred has received several &quot;Prix Étoiles&quot; (in Acadie). He took home the Juno Award for Francophone Album of the Year for his debut album, . He was also nominated in several categories during the Quebec l&#x27;ADISQ 2005 gala, including one nomination in the Best Seller category. At the 16th SOCAN gala, his song &quot;, was listed among the top ten most-played francophone songs on the radio.

Wilfred recorded a follow-up album in 2005 called . The first song released from that album, &quot;, reached the top five in the radio BDS countdown while the video also placed the song in the top five on Musique Plus and Musimax (the Francophone version of MuchMusic).

At the end of August 2007, &quot;&quot;, also from the album , was sitting at number seven on Quebec&#x27;s &quot;Top 50 Radio Correspondants Francophone.&quot;

In 2021, Le Bouthillier and Thibert performed together in the first season of &quot;Chanteurs masqués&quot;, the Quebec adaptation of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;, as a pair of lovebirds. Although not a couple in real life, their careers have been closely associated since the start, as Thibert was the runner-up on Le Bouthillier&#x27;s winning season of &quot;Star Académie&quot; and they have often performed together since. They won the competition.

<doc id="887156" wikidata="Q5557442" url="?curid=887156" title="Ghosts of the Great Highway">
<text>Ghosts of the Great Highway is the debut studio album by San Francisco quartet Sun Kil Moon, led by Red House Painters&#x27; founder Mark Kozelek, who composed all of the lyrics and music on this album. The other members are Anthony Koutsos (former drummer for Red House Painters), Geoff Stanfield, and Tim Mooney.

Three of the album&#x27;s songs are named after boxers, following on from &quot;Find Me, Rubén Olivares&quot; from Kozelek&#x27;s debut solo EP &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Singer&quot;. The band name is also a pun on the Korean boxer Sung-Kil Moon. The opening number is named after Judas Priest guitarist Glenn Tipton. The song &quot;Pancho Villa&quot; is a more luscious arrangement of &quot;Salvador Sanchez&quot;.

&quot;Ghosts of the Great Highway&quot; was re-issued as a double CD on February 6, 2007 on Kozelek&#x27;s own label, Caldo Verde Records. The second disc features 6 bonus tracks, including two versions of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Somewhere&quot;, and the instrumental track &quot;Arrival&quot;, which was originally recorded for the movie &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot;. The songs &quot;Carry Me Ohio&quot; and &quot;Lily and Parrots&quot; were featured in the film &quot;Shopgirl&quot;, in which Kozelek made a cameo appearance.

The song &quot;Carry Me Ohio&quot; was listed at #462 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s &quot;Top 500 Songs of the 2000s&quot; list.

==Reception==

Upon its release, &quot;Ghosts of the Great Highway&quot; received critical acclaim.

<doc id="887164" wikidata="Q841776" url="?curid=887164" title="The Assassination Bureau">
<text>The Assassination Bureau Limited (also known The Assassination Bureau in the United States) is a 1969 British Technicolor black comedy adventure film, produced by Michael Relph, directed by Basil Dearden, and starring Oliver Reed, Diana Rigg, Telly Savalas, and Curd Jürgens. It was released in the U.S. by Paramount Pictures and is based on Jack London&#x27;s unfinished novel, &quot;The Assassination Bureau, Ltd&quot;, posthumously published in 1963. Unlike the novel, which is set in the United States, the film is set in Europe.

&quot;The Assassination Bureau Limited&quot; was the penultimate film of Basil Dearden.

The film is set in the Edwardian era. In the film, a female journalist commissions the assassination of the chairman of an organization of assassins. The chairman challenges the members of his organization to kill him. If they fail, he will kill them. He is orchestrating a purge of his organization&#x27;s senior members. 

==Plot==
In London, in 1908, aspiring journalist and women&#x27;s rights campaigner Sonia Winter uncovers an organisation that specialises in killing for money, the Assassination Bureau Limited. To bring about its destruction, she commissions the assassination of the bureau&#x27;s own chairman, Ivan Dragomiloff for £20,000 after being bankrolled by her employer, Lord Bostwick.

Far from being outraged or angry, Dragomiloff is amused and delighted and decides to turn the situation to his own advantage. The guiding principle of his bureau, founded by his father, has always been that there was a moral reason why their victims should be killed; these have included despots and tyrants. More recently, though, his elder colleagues have tended to kill more for financial gain than for moral reasons. Dragomiloff, therefore, decides to accept the commission of his own death and challenge the other board members: Kill him or he will kill them!

He meets Miss Winter at the Albert Memorial and with her in tow, Dragomiloff sets off on a tour of Edwardian Europe, challenging and systematically purging the bureau&#x27;s senior members. Their first stop is Paris where Dragomiloff disguises himself as Le Comte and goes to a brothel. Miss Winter materialises and they hide in a laundry room. The staff outside put a gas pipe into the room, but there is a police raid. They escape down the laundry chute, but leave a booby trap that blows the room up when the door is eventually smashed in, killing Lucoville. Miss Winter is arrested while Dragomiloff sneaks off.

She catches him on a train to Zürich, but Popescu also appears, disguised as a train waiter serving cognac and cigars. He pulls a gun, but Dragomiloff sprays him with fiery brandy, lit by the cigar, burning his face and he jumps off the train and dies. In Zürich the bank manager Weiss pulls a gun on a suspicious-looking customer and throws his bag into the street, thinking it is a bomb. The angry customer leaves, and while Weiss is distracted, Dragomiloff hides a real bomb that kills Weiss.

Next, in Vienna the couple watch a military parade. A man behind them pulls a pistol, but he is trying to assassinate the Archduke watching the parade from a balcony opposite. Dragomiloff disdainfully remarks to Miss Winter that had &quot;The Assassination Bureau&quot; undertaken this &quot;assignment&quot;, the Archduke would not remain alive. In Venice Bureau member Cesare Spado dies after being poisoned by his wife; with the help of her lover Angelo she tries to poison Dragomiloff and have Baron Muntzof kill Miss Winter. Dragomiloff not only survives the attempt on his life, but kills both Angelo and Muntzof and rescues Miss Winter. Eleanora Spado tries to blackmail the Assassination Bureau for money by using her knowledge of its existence; the Bureau&#x27;s response is to deem her expendable and General Pinck kills her with his Luger pistol.

Little do they realise that this is a plot by Miss Winter&#x27;s sponsor, newspaper publisher Lord Bostwick, to take over the bureau, as Bostwick is the bureau&#x27;s vice-chairman and is bitter for having been passed over in favour of the founder&#x27;s son. Bostwick and the other surviving members of the Bureau plan to get rich quick by the &quot;biggest killing&quot; of them all, namely buying stocks in arms companies and then propelling Europe into a world war. Their plan is to assassinate all the European heads of state. They attend a secret peace conference where the kings, emperors, and prime ministers of Europe are trying to avoid a possible war over the assassination of a Balkan prince who had accidentally been killed by a bomb intended for Dragomiloff.

Dragomiloff and Miss Winter uncover the plot, which is to drop a large aerial bomb from a hijacked Zeppelin airship directly onto the castle in Ruthenia where the peace conference is being held. Dragomiloff steals aboard the airship and destroys the bomb, while disposing of Lord Bostwick and the remaining members of his board of directors. He exploits General Pinck&#x27;s one weakness, a sword duel challenge to the death. He is hailed as a hero and later decorated by the heads of state that he has saved. It is implied that Dragomiloff may now wed Miss Winter, since he has been redeemed by his actions.

==Cast==
==Original novel==
The film was based on the Jack London novel, &quot;The Assassination Bureau&quot;. London purchased a storyline from Sinclair Lewis in 1910 and used it as the basis of two short stories and a novel. He was two-thirds of the way through finishing the novel (having written 40,000 words) when he died in 1916. The novel was later completed by Robert L. Fish and finally published in 1963. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called it &quot;delightfully ridiculous&quot;.

==Development==
Film rights were bought and in May 1966 United Artists announced that Burt Lancaster would star in the film. Lancaster, however, pulled out and film rights reverted to Paramount, where it was made by the team of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph; it was their 25th film together.

==Filming==
Filming took place in April 1968.

Michael Flint of Paramount later said the film wound up costing a lot of money &quot;because it was decided that it must be a locomotive&quot;, namely, a sort of film which &quot;would really carry weight with exhibitors and eventually television networks buying batches of our films, by virtue of stars or production value&quot;. He added that in the case of &quot;Assassination Bureau&quot; &quot;we laboured under the delusion that this could be ensured by spending more on &#x27;production value&#x27;&quot;.

By February 1969, the film had not been released. According to Diana Rigg, &quot;the film company is stuck with the rather awkward - for America - title and hasn&#x27;t made up its mind what to do&quot;.

==Home video==
This film was issued on LaserDisc in the mid-1990s. It was also released on VHS at the same time and later on Region 1 DVD. &quot;The Assassination Bureau&quot; was restored and released in 1080p HD on an Arrow Films Special Edition Blu-ray in 2023, which included a new audio commentary track and the short critique &quot;Right Film, Wrong Time.&quot;

<text>Quebec East (also known as Québec-Est and Québec East) was a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1867 to 2004.

While its boundaries changed over the decades, it was essentially made up of the eastern part of Quebec City and was largely of working class composition. It was created in 1867. It was renamed &quot;Québec-Est&quot; in 1966, and &quot;Québec East&quot; in 1996. It was abolished through redistribution 2003 into the ridings of Québec, Louis-Saint-Laurent, and Beauport.

From 1877 to 1958, the riding was represented by only three Members of Parliament (MPs): Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier (1877–1919), senior Cabinet member Ernest Lapointe (1919–1941) and Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent (1942–1958). With Laurier serving as prime minister from 1896 until 1911, and St. Laurent doing likewise from 1948 until 1957, Quebec East became one of two districts to be represented by two sitting prime ministers; the only other to date is Prince Albert.

==Members of Parliament==

<doc id="887179" wikidata="Q933121" url="?curid=887179" title="Colpitts oscillator">
<text>A Colpitts oscillator, invented in 1918 by Canadian-American engineer Edwin H. Colpitts using vacuum tubes, is one of a number of designs for LC oscillators, electronic oscillators that use a combination of inductors (L) and capacitors (C) to produce an oscillation at a certain frequency. The distinguishing feature of the Colpitts oscillator is that the feedback for the active device is taken from a voltage divider made of two capacitors in series across the inductor.

==Overview==

The Colpitts circuit, like other LC oscillators, consists of a gain device (such as a bipolar junction transistor, field-effect transistor, operational amplifier, or vacuum tube) with its output connected to its input in a feedback loop containing a parallel LC circuit (tuned circuit), which functions as a bandpass filter to set the frequency of oscillation. The amplifier will have differing input and output impedances, and these need to be coupled into the LC circuit without overly damping it.

A Colpitts oscillator uses a pair of capacitors to provide voltage division to couple the energy in and out of the tuned circuit. (It can be considered as the electrical dual of a Hartley oscillator, where the feedback signal is taken from an &quot;inductive&quot; voltage divider consisting of two coils in series (or a tapped coil).) Fig. 1 shows the common-base Colpitts circuit. The inductor &quot;L&quot; and the series combination of &quot;C&quot;1 and &quot;C&quot;2 form the resonant tank circuit, which determines the frequency of the oscillator. The voltage across &quot;C&quot;2 is applied to the base-emitter junction of the transistor, as feedback to create oscillations. Fig. 2 shows the common-collector version. Here the voltage across &quot;C&quot;1 provides feedback. The frequency of oscillation is approximately the resonant frequency of the LC circuit, which is the series combination of the two capacitors in parallel with the inductor:
:formula_1
The actual frequency of oscillation will be slightly lower due to junction capacitances and resistive loading of the transistor.

As with any oscillator, the amplification of the active component should be marginally larger than the attenuation of the resonator losses and its voltage division, to obtain stable operation. Thus, a Colpitts oscillator used as a variable-frequency oscillator (VFO) performs best when a variable inductance is used for tuning, as opposed to tuning just one of the two capacitors. If tuning by variable capacitor is needed, it should be done with a third capacitor connected in parallel to the inductor (or in series as in the Clapp oscillator).

===Practical example===
Fig. 3 shows an example with component values. Instead of field-effect transistors, other active components such as bipolar junction transistors or vacuum tubes, capable of producing gain at the desired frequency, could be used.

The common gate amplifier has a low input impedance and a high output impedance. Therefore the amplifier input, the source, is connected to the low impedance tap of the LC circuit L1, C1, C2, C3 and the amplifier output, the drain, is connected to the high impedance top of the LC circuit. The resistor R1 sets the operating point to 0.5mA drain current with no oscillating. The output is at the low impedance tap and can drive some load. Still, this circuit has low harmonic distortion. An additional variable capacitor between drain of J1 and ground allows to change the frequency of the circuit. The load resistor RL is part of the simulation, not part of the circuit.

==Theory==
One method of oscillator analysis is to determine the input impedance of an input port neglecting any reactive components. If the impedance yields a negative resistance term, oscillation is possible. This method will be used here to determine conditions of oscillation and the frequency of oscillation.

An ideal model is shown to the right. This configuration models the common collector circuit in the section above. For initial analysis, parasitic elements and device non-linearities will be ignored. These terms can be included later in a more rigorous analysis. Even with these approximations, acceptable comparison with experimental results is possible.

Ignoring the inductor, the input impedance at the base can be written as

: formula_2

where formula_3 is the input voltage, and formula_4 is the input current. The voltage formula_5 is given by

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the impedance of formula_8. The current flowing into formula_8 is formula_10, which is the sum of two currents:

:formula_11

where formula_12 is the current supplied by the transistor. formula_12 is a dependent current source given by

:formula_14

where formula_15 is the transconductance of the transistor. The input current formula_4 is given by

:formula_17

where formula_18 is the impedance of formula_19. Solving for formula_5 and substituting above yields

:formula_21

The input impedance appears as the two capacitors in series with the term formula_22, which is proportional to the product of the two impedances:

:formula_23

If formula_18 and formula_7 are complex and of the same sign, then formula_22 will be a negative resistance. If the impedances for formula_18 and formula_7 are substituted, formula_22 is

:formula_30

If an inductor is connected to the input, then the circuit will oscillate if the magnitude of the negative resistance is greater than the resistance of the inductor and any stray elements. The frequency of oscillation is as given in the previous section.

For the example oscillator above, the emitter current is roughly 1 mA. The transconductance is roughly 40 mS. Given all other values, the input resistance is roughly

:formula_31

This value should be sufficient to overcome any positive resistance in the circuit. By inspection, oscillation is more likely for larger values of transconductance and smaller values of capacitance. A more complicated analysis of the common-base oscillator reveals that a low-frequency amplifier voltage gain must be at least 4 to achieve oscillation. The low-frequency gain is given by

:formula_32
If the two capacitors are replaced by inductors, and magnetic coupling is ignored, the circuit becomes a Hartley oscillator. In that case, the input impedance is the sum of the two inductors and a negative resistance given by

:formula_33

In the Hartley circuit, oscillation is more likely for larger values of transconductance and larger values of inductance.

The above analysis also describes the behavior of the Pierce oscillator. The Pierce oscillator, with two capacitors and one inductor, is equivalent to the Colpitts oscillator. Equivalence can be shown by choosing the junction of the two capacitors as the ground point. An electrical dual of the standard Pierce oscillator using two inductors and one capacitor is equivalent to the Hartley oscillator.

=== Working Principle ===
A Colpitts oscillator is an electronic circuit that generates a sinusoidal waveform, typically in the radio frequency range. It uses an inductor and two capacitors in parallel to form a resonant tank circuit, which determines the oscillation frequency. The output signal from the tank circuit is fed back into the input of an amplifier, where it is amplified and fed back into the tank circuit. The feedback signal provides the necessary phase shift for sustained oscillation.

The working principle of a Colpitts oscillator can be explained as follows:

* When the power supply is switched on, the capacitors formula_19 and formula_8 start charging through the resistor formula_36 and formula_37. The voltage across formula_8 is coupled to the base of the transistor through the capacitor formula_39.
* The transistor amplifies the input signal and produces an inverted output signal at the collector. The output signal is coupled to the tank circuit through the capacitor formula_40.
* The tank circuit resonates at its natural frequency, which is given by:

:formula_41

Where:

* f = frequency of oscillation
* L = inductance of the inductor
* formula_42 = total capacitance of the series combination of formula_19 and formula_8, given by:

:formula_45

* The resonant frequency is independent of the values of formula_19 and formula_8, but depends on their ratio. The ratio of formula_19 and formula_8 also affects the feedback gain and the stability of the oscillator.
* The voltage across the inductor L is in phase with the voltage across formula_8, and 180 degrees out of phase with the voltage across formula_19. Therefore, the voltage at the junction of formula_19 and formula_8 is 180 degrees out of phase with the voltage at the collector of the transistor. This voltage is fed back to the base of the transistor through formula_39, providing another 180 degrees phase shift. Thus, the total phase shift around the loop is 360 degrees, which is equivalent to zero degrees. This satisfies the Barkhausen criterion for oscillation.
* The amplitude of the oscillation depends on the feedback gain and the losses in the tank circuit. The feedback gain should be equal to or slightly greater than the losses for sustained oscillation. The feedback gain can be adjusted by varying the values of formula_36 and formula_37, or by using a variable capacitor in place of formula_19 or formula_8.

The Colpitts oscillator is widely used in various applications, such as RF communication systems, signal generators, and electronic testing equipment. It has better frequency stability than the Hartley oscillator, which uses a tapped inductor instead of a tapped capacitor in the tank circuit. However, the Colpitts oscillator may require a higher supply voltage and a larger coupling capacitor than the Hartley oscillator.

===Oscillation amplitude===
The amplitude of oscillation is generally difficult to predict, but it can often be accurately estimated using the describing function method.

For the common-base oscillator in Figure 1, this approach applied to a simplified model predicts an output (collector) voltage amplitude given by

:formula_59

where formula_60 is the bias current, and formula_61 is the load resistance at the collector.

This assumes that the transistor does not saturate, the collector current flows in narrow pulses, and that the output voltage is sinusoidal (low distortion).

This approximate result also applies to oscillators employing different active device, such as MOSFETs and vacuum tubes.

<doc id="887184" wikidata="Q1764403" url="?curid=887184" title="Black Dog (Led Zeppelin song)">
<text>&quot;Black Dog&quot; is a song by the English rock band Led Zeppelin. It is the first track on the band&#x27;s untitled fourth album (1971), which has become one of the best-selling albums of all time. The song was released as a single and reached the charts in many countries. It is &quot;one of the most instantly recognisable Zeppelin tracks&quot;, and was included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list (US), and ranked No. 1 in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s (UK) &quot;20 Greatest Guitar Tracks&quot;. The lyrics contain typical bluesman themes of lust, eroticism and betrayal.

==Composition==
===Themes===
The title is a reference to a nameless black Labrador Retriever the band used to see wandering the Headley Grange studio grounds. The dog would disappear in the evening and return exhausted in the early morning, before resting all day and repeating his evening sojourns. Robert Plant believed the lab was spending nights with his &quot;old lady&quot; (dog). Likewise the lyrics are narrated by a man obsessed with a woman, &quot;got a flaming heart can&#x27;t get my fill&quot;, he &quot;can&#x27;t keep away&quot; from her &quot;honey drip&quot;; she reveals her true intention, spending his money, taking his car, &quot;telling her friends she&#x27;s gonna be a star&quot;, at which point the deception becomes clear and he turns cold, saying &quot;a big-legged woman ain&#x27;t got no soul&quot;. The story of lust, eroticism, and ultimately betrayal echoes the traditional reputation of the blues as being the music of the devil, alluded to in the lyric &quot;eyes that shine a burning red&quot;.

===Music===

The song opens with muted sounds of guitars warming up in the background, an idea by Jimmy Page, who also made curious opening sounds in &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot;, he was fond of starting songs in an unexpected way. The sounds are actually recordings of various guitar track openings played simultaneously, creating a &quot;sonic collage&quot; in which the tape can be heard spinning up to speed. Robert Plant then begins singing in a high strong voice, &quot;hey, hey, mama&quot; unaccompanied by music (a cappella). This sets the structure of the song, around a call and response dynamic, between the vocalist and the band, back and forth. It was Jimmy Page&#x27;s idea to start and stop the music, and he was inspired by Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s 1969 song &quot;Oh Well&quot;.

Bassist John Paul Jones, who is credited with writing the main riff, said he was inspired by Muddy Waters&#x27; 1968 album &quot;Electric Mud&quot;. However he retracted this, in 2007, saying that he was confused, and that his main inspiration was actually &quot;The Howlin&#x27; Wolf Album&quot; by Howlin&#x27; Wolf, particularly the repeating riff in &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot;, which Jones and Page sped up.

Jones added complex rhythm changes, that biographer Keith Shadwick describes as a &quot;clever pattern that turns back on itself more than once, crossing between time signatures as it does.&quot; The group had a difficult time with the turnaround, but drummer John Bonham&#x27;s solution was to play it straight through as if there was no turnaround. As Jean-Michel Guesdon notes, the recording contains rhythmic coordination errors, such as between 0:41 and 0:47, when the guitars are not in sync with the drums. He says it was part of the band&#x27;s &quot;genius&quot; to discount these &quot;errors&quot; as &quot;curiosities&quot; ie. characteristic signatures of the song. In live performances, Bonham eliminated the variation so that Robert Plant could perform his &quot;a cappella&quot; vocal interludes and then have the instruments return at the proper time. 

For his guitar parts, Jimmy Page used a Gibson Les Paul and made a complicated series of overdubs through various compressors and other equipment. There was so much distortion, Page later said it sounded like an analog synthesizer.

==Recordings and releases==
The initial backing tracks of &quot;Black Dog&quot; were recorded on 5 December 1970 at Island Studios on Basing Street in London, with recording engineer Andy Johns. It was the band&#x27;s first recording at Island Studios. Further tracks were made at Headley Grange (January 1971), and again at Island Studios (February 1971).

Although played at live concerts since March 1971, its first commercial release was on 8 November 1971, as track #1 side one of the album &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;, which went on to become one of the best-selling albums of all time.

The single followed about a month later, on 2 December 1971 in continental Europe, the United States (via Europe), and Australia. As was their practice, the United Kingdom did not receive the single. &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; is on the B-side.

==Live performances==
&quot;Black Dog&quot; became a staple of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s live concert performances. It was first played live at Belfast&#x27;s Ulster Hall on 5 March 1971, a concert which also featured the first ever live performance of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. It was retained for each subsequent concert tour until 1973. In 1975 it was used as an encore medley with &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;, but was hardly used on the band&#x27;s 1977 US concert tour. It was recalled to the set for the Knebworth Festival 1979 and the 1980 Tour of Europe. For these final 1980 performances, Page introduced the song from stage. &quot;Black Dog&quot; was performed for the final time at the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in 2007, during Led Zeppelin&#x27;s headline set.

==Reception==
In 2004, the song appeared on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list at number 294. In 2010, it was demoted to number 300. Music sociologist Deena Weinstein calls &quot;Black Dog&quot; &quot;one of the most instantly recognisable Zeppelin tracks&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Q&quot; magazine polled an &quot;all-star panel&quot;, who ranked Black Dog as number one in a list of the &quot;20 Greatest Guitar Tracks&quot;.

<text>The great diving beetle (&quot;Dytiscus marginalis&quot;) is an aquatic diving beetle native to Europe and northern Asia, and in the UK is common in Wales, much of England and southern Scotland but less common on chalk and in the far north.
The great diving beetle, true to its name, is a rather large insect. The larvae can grow up to in length, while the adults are generally .

These beetles live in fresh water, either still or slow-running, and seem to prefer water with vegetation. They are dark-coloured (brown to black) on their back and wing cases (elytra) and yellow on their abdomen and legs. The male&#x27;s wing cases are shiny, while those of the female are finely grooved. A voracious predator, this beetle hunts a wide variety of prey including small fish. The first two pairs of legs of the male are equipped with numerous suction cups, enabling them to obtain a secure grip while mating, and on their prey.

They are able fliers, and fly usually at night. They use the reflection of moonlight to locate new water sources. This location method can sometimes cause them to land on wet roads or other hard wet surfaces.

Before they dive, they collect air bubbles in their wing cases which goes through the spiracles. The jaws of a great diving beetle are strong compared to their body size.

The beetle reproduces by laying eggs under water in the mesophyll of an aquatic plant leaf. The incubation period is between 17 and 19 days.

<text>Tracadie-Sheila ( ) is a former town in Gloucester County, New Brunswick, Canada. It is now part of the Regional Municipality of Tracadie.

==History==
==Demographics==
===Population===


===Language ===
== Tourism and culture ==
Located on the Acadian Peninsula, the area has a number of sandy beaches. Val-Comeau, the most popular, is protected as a Provincial Park. The beaches can usually be enjoyed from June until September, when the water is a moderate temperature.

Signage is in French, as most inhabitants of the Acadian Peninsula are predominantly French speaking. The community became known as the hometown of Wilfred Le Bouthillier, winner of the 2003 Quebec reality show &quot;Star Académie&quot;. The success of the young singer, known simply as Wilfred, resulted in a significant rise in tourism to the region.

The town is also home to pop singer Jean-François Breau. Well-known AIDS activist Dr. Réjean Thomas and opera singer Michèle Losier, (both now residing in Montreal), are from the neighbouring village of St-Isidore, part of the greater Tracadie area.

== Economy ==
The region suffers from high unemployment because of its relative isolation from centres of greater population. It depends on federal government assistance to compensate for the weak economic performance of the last decades. Most well-paid jobs tend to be government-related, including teachers, nurses and doctors. Other employers are in the &quot;Parc Industriel&quot;.

Tourism is an important seasonal employer, particularly in the summer months of June, July and August. Thousands of vacationers, mostly from neighbouring Québec, come for the beaches, ocean, and hospitality.

== Transportation ==
The closest public airport is Bathurst Airport (IATA code: ZBF), 75 kilometres west of the town. It is served by Air Canada Jazz with twice daily flights to Montreal.

The community was once served by CN Rail for freight rail transport, but the rail line was abandoned in the 1980s. Today the nearest rail service is at Miramichi or Bathurst with the New Brunswick East Coast Railway; Via Rail Canada provides 6-day/week passenger rail service at Bathurst and Miramichi using its train the &quot;Ocean&quot;, running to Montreal and Halifax.

The town is located on Highway 11 which links the town to Caraquet and Shippagan to the northeast and Miramichi to the southwest. The town is connected to Highway 8 to Bathurst via Highway 365 and Highway 160 through Saint-Isidore and Allardville.

<text>Lincoln: A Novel is a 1984 historical novel, part of the &quot;Narratives of Empire&quot; series by Gore Vidal. The novel describes the presidency of Abraham Lincoln and extends from the start of the American Civil War until his assassination. Rather than focus on the Civil War itself, the novel is centred on Lincoln&#x27;s political and personal struggles. Though Lincoln is the focus, the book is never narrated from his point of view (with the exception of several paragraphs describing a dream Lincoln had shortly before his death); Vidal instead writes from the perspective of key historical figures. He draws from contemporary diaries, memoirs, letters, newspaper accounts, the biographical writings of John Hay and John Nicolay (Lincoln&#x27;s secretaries), and the work of modern historians.

== Style, plot, and themes ==

=== Style ===
The novel is part of Gore Vidal’s ‘Narratives of Empire’ series and joins his other works; Burr (1973), 1876 (1976) and Washington D.C. (1967) as chronicles of America. In the series, Vidal offers works of historical fiction that reinterpret American history starting from the American Revolution to beyond World War II. The book is never narrated from Lincoln’s perspective. Rather, the reader views Lincoln through the eyes of his enemies, friends, political rivalries and even those who sought to kill him. Significant characters include Lincoln’s cabinet secretaries; William Seward, Salmon Chase as well as Kate Sprague, John Hay, Mary Todd Lincoln and David Herold. Much of the writing is presented through dramatic, flamboyant dialogue. Vidal favours this over narration or observational writing, attempting to convey his wit and charisma through his characters. The novel is not simply a work of historical fiction, but with Lincoln&#x27;s personal and political development it is also a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;. Lincoln&#x27;s development starts with the slow mobilisation and unification of his inner Cabinet, climaxes with his military victory and political restoration of the Union and is completed with his assassination

=== Plot ===
The novel commences on February 23, 1861 as Lincoln, the incumbent president, is traveling to Washington for his inauguration. It is in Washington where the majority of the novel is set. Washington is depicted as turbulent and deteriorating with infestations of pests, poor infrastructure, a Capitol building without a dome and an incomplete Washington Monument. The novel comprises Lincoln’s two terms of office through the American civil war. It offers a detailed and extensive narrative, with the book totaling over 650 pages. It focuses on Lincoln&#x27;s efforts to unite and mobilize political adversaries and military strategists to win the war. It is through the various perspectives of other characters that Vidal portrays an ambitious visionary who struggles with an unstable marriage, physical ailments and the failing trust of his fellow cabinet members. The novel also explores Lincoln’s growth as he overcomes these personal and political burdens to triumph and preserve the union. Vidal completes the novel with President Lincoln’s assassination.

=== Themes ===
The central thematic development is the reinterpretation of the idealistic, sentimental ‘Honest Abe.’ Vidal depicts a politically cunning, dictatorial leader whose primary motivation was not the liberation of African American slaves nor adherence to the Constitution, but the preservation of the Union. Vidal even goes far enough to contend that Lincoln held an unshaken belief of white superiority and was willing to &#x27;bend the Constitution,&#x27; although this has been significantly criticised. Vidal believes that it was Lincoln&#x27;s willingness to act unilaterally and suspend democratic principles such as &quot;habeas corpus&quot; that allowed him to succeed in his unflinching pursuit of unification. He jailed hostile newspaper editors, political opponents and even employed the Secret Service to inspect private communications.

Vidal follows the complex politics of the cabinet and congress. Initially, Lincoln faces political opponents who constantly doubt and undermine his leadership. Indeed, many of Congressman viewed Lincoln as mild-mannered and weak. However, as the novel progresses, the reader comes to understand that Lincoln purposely and cleverly masks his true emotions. Vidal contends that Lincoln&#x27;s greatest leadership quality is his introverted nature. Dealing with treacherous politicians, arrogant generals and critics, Lincoln was shrewd and cunning to masterfully navigate the United States to unification as a Republic. Despite the incompetent military strategists and petty, squabbling politicians, Lincoln was aware that his primary goal was to hold the North together for as long as possible. This was because the battle was one of attrition and Lincoln knew that the South&#x27;s smaller population would be exhausted first.

Ultimately, even Lincoln&#x27;s political rivalries come to respect his leadership. William Seward, once a fierce opponent and underminer of Lincoln transforms into a devoted servant.

There were also shortcomings of Lincoln. He is depicted as hopelessly naive in dealing with the remarkable costs of financing the war and dealing with the US Treasury. He also struggles as a father. His son, Robert, confides in Hay and reveals that he feels neglected. He comes to resent his father&#x27;s political ambition that caused him to be so preoccupied and distant. His wife&#x27;s mood swings and insatiable spending further challenge Lincoln&#x27;s stoicism; whilst the marriage is turbulent, the two seem to share a strong bond.

With frequent light-hearted ‘outlandish’ anecdotes and humour, Vidal sought to also explore the human side of Lincoln. Vidal perceived Lincoln&#x27;s humour as a necessity to dealing with his many great burdens.

== Characters ==
=== Mary Todd Lincoln ===
Lincoln deeply loved his wife and struggled greatly with her mental collapse. She is depicted as a vulnerability in Lincoln&#x27;s political tactics, frequently clashing with Congressman.

Nonetheless, Vidal&#x27;s representation of Mary is mostly positive. She is seen as an intelligent and decent person who unfortunately succumbs to fits of insanity characterised by wild mood swings and insatiable spending.

=== John Hay ===
John Hay was Lincoln&#x27;s personal secretary. He is represented as a close friend and confidant of Lincoln. He was a young man at the time of Lincoln&#x27;s presidency and was energetic and high-spirited, even through the more challenging times of the war.

=== William Seward ===
Seward was the U.S Secretary of State and is depicted as a handsome, yet politically cunning rival of Lincoln. Initially Seward was a believer that the Southern States should be allowed to pursue their legal right of independence; however, under Lincoln&#x27;s leadership he came to understand the importance of unification. He was an outspoken member of Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet, and oversaw the war effort.

=== Salmon P. Chase ===
Chase was Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of the U.S Treasury during most of his first term in office, and is depicted as being as interested in developing his candidacy for the 1864 presidential election as he was in his cabinet role. He, like many other politicians, doubted Lincoln&#x27;s leadership ability, believing that only a more radical abolitionist than Lincoln (someone like Chase himself) would be able to guide the country through its time of great peril. Lincoln shrewdly neutralized Chase&#x27;s insurgent candidacy for the Republican nomination in 1864 and Chase is left humbled and with limited prospects.

=== David Herold and John Wilkes Booth ===
Herold and Booth are the coconspirators who devised and successfully executed a plan to assassinate Lincoln.

Herold despises Lincoln&#x27;s attempts at unification. He is depicted as unintelligent and frequently engages in debauchery, visiting brothels in Washington. He fantasizes about being a hero of the Confederacy and even poisoning the President through his job as a pharmacy clerk. He eventually finds a group of like-minded individuals who also seek to kill Lincoln, and it is here where he meets Booth.

John Booth is the assassin of Lincoln. Booth is not as incompetent as Herold, but is also a hate-filled enemy of Lincoln. He seeks to avenge the defeat of the South, and stalks Lincoln throughout the novel, swearing revenge. His narrative climaxes with the assassination of Lincoln and subsequent daring escape.

== Reception ==

The Washington Post wrote a positive review at the time of publication, praising Vidal’s well practiced craftsmanship in skilfully creating a satisfying read. This positive praise was reflected in The New York Review of Books.

In addition, the book was subject to critical backlash, primarily from academic historians.
Roy P. Basler contends that much of Lincoln’s life never happened as told by Vidal. This historical inaccuracy extends to the character’s personalities and physical attributes. Significantly, Vidal faced intense criticism for his depiction of a racist Lincoln, and a syphilitic deranged Mary Todd Lincoln. Despite the novel’s genre of historical narrative, the purported distortion in facts was seen as potentially damaging to the public.

John Alvis published a review of the novel in The Claremont Review of Books. According to Alvis, the book is ‘disappointing for being at bottom inadequate.’ It was contended that Vidal’s novel succumbed to melodrama, historical inaccuracy and sensationalism. The Dean of Lincoln Scholars Richard N. Current took great exception to his novel, starting a running feud with Vidal in the pages of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;.

However, within academic quarters there was also positive reception. Harold Bloom, the Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University, published a review in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, where he called the book ‘superb’ and ‘grand entertainment.’ 
Vidal was also described as an impressive writer who has helped shape popular consciousness and offer an alternative view on the dominant understanding of American society and history.

== Awards ==

In 1985 Vidal was awarded the Benjamin Barondess Award for the novel. The recipient of the award receives a sculpture of Abraham Lincoln, specifically a bust. It is presented annually &quot;to any person or institution and for any contribution to the greater appreciation of the life and works of Abraham Lincoln as decided upon by the award committee.” 

It also was placed on the Torchlight List that recognises 200 works that equip people with concepts to help them comprehend the complexities of the modern world. The list is definitive and was devised by Jim Flynn, a professor who lectures at the University of Otago.

It was also placed on the New York Times Best Seller List in 1984.

==Adaptation==
&quot;Lincoln&quot;, a made-for-TV film based on the novel, first aired in 1988 in two parts on March 27 and March 28. It stars Sam Waterston as Lincoln and Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd Lincoln.

It differed from the book by focussing less on the personal struggle and growth of Lincoln, but more on the war itself. Both the director and lead actress were awarded Emmys for their work on the miniseries.

==Writing and publication==
The book was published in 1984 by Penguin Random House LLC. Vidal claimed that the book was researched and written over a period of 5 years. It largely draws from primary sources, including newspapers, diaries, and letters of the time. Like Vidal&#x27;s other historical fiction works, such as &quot;Washington D.C.&quot; and &quot;Burr: A Novel&quot;, Vidal includes an extraordinary amount of detail, and attempts to follow the documented record closely.

Vidal’s Lincoln was considered a commercial success. It was on The New York Times’ best-seller chart for 22 weeks and sold over 250 000 hard cover copies.
The Afterword of the novel thanks Professor David Herbert Donald of Harvard’s History Department for fact checking the manuscript.

<doc id="887196" wikidata="Q3496948" url="?curid=887196" title="Star Academy (Arabia)">
<text>Star Academy Arab World or Star Academy Arabia, is an Arab world televised talent show, which aired from December 19, 2003, to January 29, 2016. The show features a group of young male and female candidates who are selected from a pan-Arab pool of more than 3,000 and sequestered for four months in &quot;The Academy,&quot; a four-story building in Lebanon, where they live, train, and compete against one another every week. The show became an instant success and every episode a much-watched event across the Arab world.

The show was adapted from a French show of the same name and produced by Dutch company Endemol, Vanilla Productions &amp; PAC Ltd. Star Academy Arab World is based on the Spanish format Operación Triunfo.

The show centers around the 16 candidates who compete in weekly talent competitions, singing, dancing, and acting during on-stage performances. At the end of every week, one contestant is kicked off by a public vote by the viewers.

One of the show&#x27;s highlights are the guest appearances of some of the Arab world&#x27;s most important singers and performers such as Najwa Karam, Angham, Haifa Wahbe, Assala Nasri, Ehab Tawfik, Elissa, Myriam Fares, Nawal Al-Zoghbi, Abdallah Al Rowaished, Wael Kfoury, Latifa, Carole Samaha, Sherine, Saad Lamjarred and many more. The show has also been successful for its reinvention and continuous changes, just as, starting from the third season, the show witnessed guests from international superstars such as Julio Iglesias, Anggun, Karl Wolf, Tina Arena and Chris De Burgh.

==Overview==
Based in Adma, a city north of Beirut, Lebanon, the show is aired for 4 months on the Egyptian TV station CBC and on the Lebanese terrestrial channel LBC and is hosted by Hilda Khalife. The show follows 16 candidates through their weeks living in &quot;The Academy,&quot; training with &quot;teachers,&quot; and performing their talents in live on-stage shows. While many choose to sing, talents are not restricted to vocal performances; acting and dancing are also common talents.

The show takes on a few different formats depending on the day of the week. Every day, there is a one-hour &quot;access&quot; show that goes over the day&#x27;s important and exciting events. On Friday, there is a live performance show where the candidates compete against each other, sometimes alongside famous domestic and international stars, and are voted off one by one. In addition, viewers can tune into &quot;The Academy&quot; 24/7 by watching LBC Reality, a dedicated satellite station.

The concept of the show is training the students in several disciplines: singing, acting, sports, vocalizing, theatre expression, dancing, and musical culture. Then, each Monday, the three weakest students are nominated. The nomination is done by the teaching staff after the candidates undergo an evaluation test the day before Sunday. On Friday, a special live show called &quot;Prime&quot; is broadcast. During the prime show, the candidates perform and sing either by themselves or with guest artists. The three nominated candidates&#x27; initial voting is through the public, done by either phone calls or text messages. The one with the highest percentage of votes returns. The two remaining candidates are then voted on by their fellow candidates, and the one with the most votes remains. The other candidate has to leave the academy immediately. When the overall number of candidates is reduced, the nomination by the professors comes down to two students. At this point, it&#x27;s completely up to the public to vote who is in and who is out, as the remaining candidates do not vote.

The show proved to be immensely popular. As both the LBC and CBC stations provide satellite connections to more than two dozen Arab countries and also to Arab communities throughout the world, it became one of the most popular shows in the Arab-speaking world. In Saudi Arabia in particular, &quot;Star Academy&quot; was a media event so popular that its broadcasts achieved record ratings, emptied streets in major cities like Jedda, animated debates, inspired Mosque sermons, and widely distracted students from focusing on final exams in May 2004. (Al-Humaydan, 2005) CBC And LBCI, the networks airing the show, reaped huge profits from the show but have been unable to replicate the show&#x27;s success with other reality shows.

This debate also caused the indefinite postponing of West Asian edition of &quot;Big Brother&quot;, also known as &quot;Big Brother – Al Raiss&quot;.

==Reception==

===Conservative response===

While the show is immensely popular among viewers, especially in Saudi Arabia, many conservative and religious leaders have criticized the show for promoting anti-Islamic behavior and ideals. &quot;Star Academy&quot; has sparked intense debates over the role of Islam in public life, Western cultural influence, gender relations, and political participation and has subverted Wahhabi notions of social order. In response to countless questions from religious Saudi viewers who questioned whether or not it was religiously haram (prohibited) or halal (permitted) to watch the show and participate in the voting component of &quot;Star Academy&quot;, the Permanent Committee for Scientific Research and the Issuing of Fatwas issued a related fatwa (religious ruling) that prohibited watching, discussing, voting in, or participating in &quot;Star Academy&quot;, as well as urging businessmen not to finance this or any similar show.

According to the Committee, the fatwa was issued because the show carried a number of serious issues including &quot;free mixing of the sexes,&quot; &quot;the wanton display and unveiling on the part of the women displaying their charms,&quot; and blatant promotion of immorality by &quot;making Muslims get used to seeing these shameful scenes that provoke desires and by distancing them from good morals and virtues.&quot; The Committee also declared that simply not watching the show was not sufficient; it is also the duty of all practicing Muslims to advise those who watch or take part in the show that it is against religious law.

Many individuals have also spoken out against the show, citing religious reasoning as well. An Imam as Mecca’s Great Mosque called &quot;Star Academy&quot; a &quot;weapon of mass destruction.&quot; Sahwi activists distributed a series of audiocassette sermons entitled &quot;Satan Academy&quot; while still others created similar sermons that compared the reality show to the virulent virus that had caused severe respiratory syndrome in the population. Religious leaders were not the only one to speak out against the show, though. Al-Riyah published a number of hostile op-eds entitled &quot;Star Academy: A Corrupt Satellite Industry&quot; and &quot;Star Academy… The Other Terrorism&quot; that harshly criticized the show.

===Liberal response===

While there was much criticism of the show by the area’s more conservative members of society, many liberals praised the novel approach to television media. Numerous reporters in Saudi newspapers praised &quot;Star Academy&quot; as an alternative to the extremist dogma that had taken over mass media in the nation. In their view, the show acted as an invitation to dialogue as well as an inspiring lesson in democracy. In a column entitled &quot;Star Academy’s Democracy&quot; a female Saudi journalist wrote that &quot;Arabs sheid away from voting because …[of fraud]… until satellite television… corrupted us by inciting us to vote: &quot;vote you are the referee&quot;…&quot;nominate your favorite candidate&quot;…the Arab viewer has become obsessed with voting because results resemble election results in the United States, where unlike Arab elected, no body wins by 99.9 percent but rather by logical proportions.&quot; 

Other liberals were exasperated by the conservatives’ excessive reaction to Star Academy. Another female journalist writing for Arab news asked &quot;how vulnerable must we be if a TV program can ‘destroy our moral standards and teach our children bad things.&quot; 

A major liberal voice hailed from within the royal family when Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, a major stakeholder in LBC, supported &quot;Star Academy&quot; by sending his private plane to Beirut to bring the winner back to Saudi Arabia.

==A &quot;Patriot Night&quot;==

On 14 February 2005, Rula Sa&#x27;d, the Director of Marketing and Promotions at the LBC acted in her role as &quot;Director of the Academy&quot; to announce to the contestants that Rafiq al-Hariri had been assassinated and that Lebanon was in mourning. This was one of the only instances in the show&#x27;s history that a real-life event had intruded upon The Academy. Like other Lebanese channels, LBC suspended its regular programing to focus all attention on the aftermath of the assassination, including a ten-day hiatus of &quot;Star Academy&quot;. The show resumed on Friday, 25 February with an episode that critics deemed &quot;The Patriotic Night&quot; during which the contestants, along with Arab celebrities and contestants from past seasons, came together and sang a number of patriotic songs in solidarity with the mourning nation. Not once throughout the program was al-Hariri&#x27;s name said; instead, the show was made to be a demonstration of renewed patriotism.

Major controversy began when it came time to vote off that week&#x27;s losing contestant. That week, the three nominees for expulsion included a Bahraini man Ahmad Salaheddin, a Syrian woman Joey Bassous, and a Lebanese man, Samer Doumit. Per contest rules, the public votes to save one contestant, and the remaining two are voted for by the other non nominated contestants. The Bahraini man was rescued by the public, but the Syrian women, despite getting higher ratings than Doumit by the public, was ultimately voted off the show.

The ousting was said to echo the tension that already existed between Syria and Lebanon post-assassination, as there was widespread suspicion that the Syrians were implicated in the crime.

== Seasons ==

=== Star Academy 1 ===
The first season of Star Academy 1 made its debut in early December 2003. The first season ended on 4 April 2004. The winner was the Egyptian candidate, Mohammad Attia.

The inaugural show quickly became popular and tickets for the show became harder to get as the show went on. The students, particularly the Top 8, became household names, and those that made the Top 8 became instant stars. The eight finalists were Mohammad Attia (Egypt), Bashar Al Shatty (Kuwait), Sophia El Mareekh (Morocco), Bahaa&#x27; El Kafy (Tunisia), Ahmed El Sherif (Tunisia), Myriam Attallah (Syria), Mohammad Khalawi (Saudi Arabia) and Cynthia Karam (Lebanon). The teachers were as follows: Wadih Abi Raad, Michael Fadel, Mary Mahfouth, Betty Taoutel, Aida Sabra, Elissar Karakalla and Rola Saad.
At the end of the show, an album featuring the Top 8 was released, as well as a music video for the winner. They then went on a Pan Arab tour, performing concerts in Dubai, Kuwait, Cairo, Alexandria, Amman, Damascus, and Beirut.

Many of them released albums, ranging in various degrees of success. Bashar Al Shatty (Kuwait) has gained much success in his three albums which he released over the last five years. Also being crowned as the most successful teenage singer in the Persian Gulf region was added to his success of being the &quot;Star Academy&quot; finalist. However, the most successful was Ahmed El Sherif (Tunisia), despite coming in the 5th place. His album has been the most successful among all student from &quot;Star Academy&quot;.

* Mohammad Attia (Winner; released one album)
* Bashar Al Shatti (Finalist; released three albums)
* Bahaa&#x27; El Kafy (3rd place; released one album)
* Mohammad Khalawi (4th place; released one album)
* Ahmed El Sherif (5th place; released two albums)
* Sophia El Mareekh (6th place; released one album)
* Cynthia Karam (7th place; no albums released)
* Myriam Attallah (8th place; released multiple songs &amp; albums)

The candidate that took the 9th place, Bruno Tabbal, participated in the &quot;World Best&quot; contest that englobed about 11 countries that have this reality show in their country. He took the 10th place, and the French person, Elodie Frégé, won.

Primes


Tour

Mohamad A, Bashar, Bahaa, Ahmad, Mohamad K, Sophia, Cynthia, and Myriam (the Top 8) were chosen to be part of the tour.

=== Star Academy 2 ===

Hisham, from Saudi Arabia, was declared as the winner this year, even though he was not the critic&#x27;s favorite. He is also the winner with the most nominations in the show&#x27;s history, with a record 4 nominations. Most felt that Amani or Zizi were the better performers overall. Many also felt that this year was a step-down in the quality of students from the previous year, with only Amani, Zizi, and Ahmed being deemed good singers.

Joseph Attieh, who is a radio and TV production student received a trophy, $50,000 in cash and a brand new 2006 car. He was 19 years old and the first Lebanese to win the Title. This year was seen as an improvement over the previous year, and a return to the level of the first season, with many talented students. Some like Hani, Hanaa, and Shayma were deemed just as worthy of winning as Joseph. There were also many other strong performers like Fadi, Khalifa, Rakiya, Maya, and Wajdi.

This year, the show expanded the number of students from 16 contestants, in the two previous years, to 19 students.

===Star Academy 5===
The fifth season of Star Academy began on 25 January 2008. There were several changes in the academy that included a new swimming pool, a basketball court, a trampoline, a pool and tennis table and a newly decorated building. New lessons were added this season including swimming lessons, basketball lessons and music lessons. Another change was the increase in the number of students, from 19 in the previous season to now 20.

The final prime of Star Academy 5 held on 23 May 2008, witnessed the crowning of Nader Guirat, the first winner from Tunis and the Maghreb region.

His victory was somewhat controversial, as Nader Guirat was the first winner of the program to sing primarily in non-Arabic languages (English, French, etc.). Even though he did sing in Arabic on rare occasions, many felt that his Arabic singing was nowhere near up to the standards of the other contestants, and not worthy of a variety show that is primarily in Arabic. Nader is also the first winner to be a nominee without being saved by the public, as he had received a low percentage of votes.

<doc id="887197" wikidata="Q629520" url="?curid=887197" title="Arbelos">
<text>In geometry, an arbelos is a plane region bounded by three semicircles with three apexes such that each corner of each semicircle is shared with one of the others (connected), all on the same side of a straight line (the &quot;baseline&quot;) that contains their diameters.

The earliest known reference to this figure is in Archimedes&#x27;s &quot;Book of Lemmas&quot;, where some of its mathematical properties are stated as Propositions 4 through 8. The word &quot;arbelos&quot; is Greek for &#x27;shoemaker&#x27;s knife&#x27;. The figure is closely related to the Pappus chain.

==Properties==
Two of the semicircles are necessarily concave, with arbitrary diameters and ; the third semicircle is convex, with diameter Let the diameters of the smaller semicircles be and ; then the diameter of the larger semircle is .


===Area===
Let be the intersection of the larger semicircle with the line perpendicular to at . Then the area of the arbelos is equal to the area of a circle with diameter .

Proof: For the proof, reflect the arbelos over the line through the points and , and observe that twice the area of the arbelos is what remains when the areas of the two smaller circles (with diameters , ) are subtracted from the area of the large circle (with diameter ). Since the area of a circle is proportional to the square of the diameter (Euclid&#x27;s Elements, Book XII, Proposition 2; we do not need to know that the constant of proportionality is ), the problem reduces to showing that formula_1. The length equals the sum of the lengths and , so this equation simplifies algebraically to the statement that formula_2. Thus the claim is that the length of the segment is the geometric mean of the lengths of the segments and . Now (see Figure) the triangle , being inscribed in the semicircle, has a right angle at the point (Euclid, Book III, Proposition 31), and consequently is indeed a &quot;mean proportional&quot; between and (Euclid, Book VI, Proposition 8, Porism). This proof approximates the ancient Greek argument; Harold P. Boas cites a paper of Roger B. Nelsen who implemented the idea as the following proof without words.
===Rectangle===
Let and be the points where the segments and intersect the semicircles and , respectively. The quadrilateral is actually a rectangle.
:&quot;Proof&quot;: , , and are right angles because they are inscribed in semicircles (by Thales&#x27;s theorem). The quadrilateral therefore has three right angles, so it is a rectangle. &quot;Q.E.D.&quot;

===Tangents===
The line is tangent to semicircle at and semicircle at .
:&quot;Proof&quot;: Since is a rectangle, the diagonals and have equal length and bisect each other at their intersection . Therefore, formula_3. Also, since is perpendicular to the diameters and , is tangent to both semicircles at the point . Finally, because the two tangents to a circle from any given exterior point have equal length, it follows that the other tangents from to semicircles and are and respectively.

===Archimedes&#x27; circles===
The altitude divides the arbelos into two regions, each bounded by a semicircle, a straight line segment, and an arc of the outer semicircle. The circles inscribed in each of these regions, known as the Archimedes&#x27; circles of the arbelos, have the same size.

== Variations and generalisations ==

The parbelos is a figure similar to the arbelos, that uses parabola segments instead of half circles. A generalisation comprising both arbelos and parbelos is the &quot;f&quot;-belos, which uses a certain type of similar differentiable functions.

In the Poincaré half-plane model of the hyperbolic plane, an arbelos models an ideal triangle.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;arbelos&quot; comes from Greek ἡ ἄρβηλος &quot;he árbēlos&quot; or ἄρβυλος &quot;árbylos&quot;, meaning &quot;shoemaker&#x27;s knife&quot;, a knife used by cobblers from antiquity to the current day, whose blade is said to resemble the geometric figure.

<text>Mount Joffre is a mountain located on the Continental Divide, in Peter Lougheed Provincial Park, Alberta, and Elk Lakes and Height of the Rockies Provincial Parks in British Columbia. The mountain was named in 1918 by the Interprovincial Boundary Survey after Marshal Joseph Joffre, commander-in-chief of the French Army during World War I.

The normal climbing route (UIAA class II) is via the north face, which is covered by the Mangin Glacier.

<doc id="887201" wikidata="Q3548034" url="?curid=887201" title="Ultimatum (game show)">
<text>Ultimatum is a Canadian French language television game show, broadcast from 2001 to 2004 on the TVA network. The show, produced in Montreal, Quebec and is hosted by Yvan Ponton. Its visual style and lighting were largely inspired by the success of the British/American game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;. The rules of the game are different.

==Synopsis and basic rules==

=== Standard game ===
The game was played with five contestants, including a returning champion who was the first &quot;controller&quot;. The controller picked a question category from a set list, then read the question and directed it to another contestant. If the contestant answered correctly, they became the new controller and the outgoing controller lost a &quot;life&quot;. If the contestant answered incorrectly, the controller retained control and the contestant lost a life. Each contestant began the game with three lives, and if they were reduced to zero, were eliminated from the game.

However, each player also had access to a number of &quot;tools&quot; to encourage strategic play. Each tool could be invoked only once by each player over the course of the game. They were:
*&quot;Ricochet&quot;, which could be used by a player who was asked to answer a question to redirect the question to any other contestant (except the controller) as if the controller had asked them directly.
*&quot;Miroir&quot; (mirror), which could also be used by a player who was asked a question, but would instead direct the question back on the controller, reversing the roles.
*&quot;Piege&quot; (trap), which was used by the controller. If a controller found a question they were sure they knew the answer to, they could &quot;trap&quot; another contestant of their choice, answer the question themselves, and, if correct, cost the trapped player a life. If wrong, the trapped player assumed control and the outgoing controller lost a life.

When any of these tools was invoked, or if the contestant had no tools left to use, the host would declare a question to be an &quot;ultimatum&quot;, with more dramatic lighting and more tense background music was played.

After all contestants but one had been eliminated, the remaining contestant was declared the winner, and went on to play the bonus round. At one point during the series the contestant who won the game received .

===Bonus round===
The bonus round pitted the winner of the standard game against the collective brain power of the eliminated contestants, with a bit of a twist: for each life the winner had remaining at the end of the game, they could eliminate an opponent, meaning they would not be allowed to help the rest answer the question. In this fashion, if a winner had all three lives left, the bonus round would effectively be one-on-one.

Later in the run, the bonus round was altered; the contestant chose a category, and was read a question. They had 10 seconds to think and, if they answered correctly, won CA$1,000.

===Tournament play===
On several occasions during the run, a multi-week tournament would be held. The five contestants played every day from Monday through Friday, with the player who won the most money invited back for the finals. Then four additional weeks would be played each with five new contestants. When five finalists had been crowned, those finalists played an additional week against each other, with the winner of the finals receiving CA$40,000.

<text>The Jewish Infantry Brigade Group, more commonly known as the Jewish Brigade Group or Jewish Brigade, was a military formation of the British Army in the Second World War. It was formed in late 1944 and was recruited among Yishuv Jews from Mandatory Palestine and commanded by Anglo-Jewish officers. It served in the latter stages of the Italian Campaign, and was disbanded in 1946.

After the war, some members of the Brigade assisted Holocaust survivors to illegally emigrate to Mandatory Palestine as part of Aliyah Bet, in defiance of British restrictions. Other members formed the vigilante groups Gmul and the Tilhas Tizig Gesheften, which assassinated hundreds of German, Austrian, and Italian war criminals. There were also at least two instances in which Brigade veterans were implicated in the assassinations of Jewish Kapos.

==Background==
===Anglo-Zionist relations===

After the First World War, the British and the French empires replaced the Ottoman Empire as the preeminent powers in the Middle East. This change brought closer the Zionist Movement&#x27;s goal of creating a Jewish state. The Balfour Declaration indicated that the British Government supported the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine in principle, marking the first official support for Zionist aims. It led to a surge of Jewish emigration in 1918–1921, known as the &quot;Third Aliyah&quot;.

The League of Nations incorporated the Declaration in the British Mandate for Palestine in 1922. Jewish immigration continued through the 1920s and 1930s, and the Jewish population expanded by over 400,000 before the beginning of the Second World War.
In 1939, the British Government of Neville Chamberlain appeared to reject the Balfour Declaration in the White Paper of 1939, abandoning the idea of establishing a Jewish Dominion. When the United Kingdom declared war on Nazi Germany in September 1939, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the Jewish Agency, stated: &quot;We will fight the White Paper as if there is no war, and fight the war as if there is no White Paper.&quot;

===Origins of the Jewish Brigade===

Chaim Weizmann, the President of the Zionist Organization (ZO), offered the British government full cooperation of the Jewish community in Mandatory Palestine. Weizmann sought to establish an identifiably Jewish fighting formation within the British Army. His request for a separate formation was rejected, but the British authorized the enlistment of Palestinian volunteers in the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) and in the Pioneer Corps, on condition that an equal number of Jews and Arabs was to be accepted. The Jewish Agency promptly scoured the local Labour Exchange offices to recruit enough Arab unemployed as &quot;volunteers&quot; to match the number of Jewish volunteers, and others were recruited from the lower strata of the Arab population, offering cash bounties for enlistment.

The quality of the recruits was, not surprisingly, abysmally low, with a very high desertion rate particularly among the Arab component, so that at the end, most units ended up formed largely by Jews. The volunteers were formed in a RASC muleteers unit and a RASC Port Operating Company, and in the Pioneers Companies 601 to 609. All but two were lost during the Greece Campaign, with the last two returned to Palestine and disbanded there.
From 1942, a large number of further Palestinian Arab/Jew mixed units were formed, with the same mixed ethnic composition and the same quality problems encountered in the Pioneers Companies. These included six RASC (Jewish) Transport Units, a women&#x27;s Auxiliary Territorial Service and a Woman Territorial Air Force Service and several auxiliaries in local units of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, Royal Engineers and Royal Army Medical Corps.

Nine non-combat infantry companies were raised as part of the Royal East Kent Regiment (&quot;the Buffs&quot;), to be used as guards for prisoners-of-war camps in Egypt. In August 1942 the Palestine Regiment was formed, again plagued by the same mixed recruiting and its associated low quality problems. The regiment was derisively called the &quot;Five Piastre Regiments&quot;, due to the large number of Arab &quot;volunteers&quot; that had enlisted just for the cash bonus provided by the Jewish Agency.

There was no designated all-Jewish, combat-worthy formation. Jewish groups petitioned the British government to create such a force, but the British refused. At that time, the White Paper was in effect, limiting Jewish immigration and land purchases.

Some British officials opposed creating a Jewish fighting force, fearing that it could become the basis for Jewish rebellion against British rule. In August 1944, Winston Churchill agreed to the formation of a &quot;Jewish Brigade&quot;. According to Rafael Medoff, Churchill consented because he was &quot;moved by the slaughter of Hungarian Jewry [and] was hoping to impress American public opinion.&quot;

==Jewish Brigade==
===Creation===

After early reports of the Nazi atrocities of the Holocaust were made public by the Allied powers in the spring and early summer of 1942, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill sent a personal telegram to the US President Franklin D. Roosevelt suggesting that &quot;the Jews... of all races have the right to strike at the Germans as a recognizable body.&quot; The president replied five days later saying: &quot;I perceive no objection...&quot;

After much hesitation, on July 3, 1944, the British government consented to the establishment of a Jewish Brigade with hand-picked Jewish and also non-Jewish senior officers. On 20 September 1944, an official communique by the War Office announced the formation of the Jewish Brigade Group of the British Army. The Jewish Brigade Group headquarters was established in Egypt at the end of September 1944. The formation was styled a brigade group because of the inclusion under command of an artillery regiment.
The Zionist flag was approved as its standard. It included more than 5,000 Jewish volunteers from Mandatory Palestine, organized into three infantry battalions of the Palestine Regiment and several supporting units.
* 1st Battalion, Palestine Regiment
* 2nd Battalion, Palestine Regiment
* 3rd Battalion, Palestine Regiment
* 200th Field Regiment (Royal Artillery)

&quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted The Rev. Dr. Israel Goldstein that the British announcement of the creation of a Jewish Brigade &quot;is a belated but nevertheless welcome token of recognition of the Jewish part in the war effort, particularly the contribution of Jewish Palestine.&quot; &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; lamented, &quot;The announcement that a Jewish Brigade will fight with the British Army is welcome, if five years late. One regrets that the British Government has been so slow to seize a great opportunity.&quot;

===Military engagements===

In October 1944, under the leadership of Brigadier Ernest F. Benjamin, the brigade group was shipped to Italy. It joined the British Eighth Army in November, which was engaged in the Italian Campaign under the 15th Army Group.

The Jewish Brigade took part in the Spring Offensive of 1945. It took positions on the front line for the first time on March 3, 1945 along the south bank of the Senio River, and immediately began engaging in small-scale actions against German forces, facing the 42nd Jäger Division and the 362nd Infantry Division. The brigade carried out aggressive patrolling during which it engaged in numerous firefights in order to improve its positions, clear the south bank of German troops, and take prisoners, and carried out small-scale raids against German positions across the river to test the enemy&#x27;s strength and map out enemy defensive positions.

In one notable raid, it was supported by tanks of the North Irish Horse and South African Air Force fighter aircraft. The South African pilots, many of whom were Jewish, flew in a Star of David formation during their attack run as a tribute to the brigade. During the raid, the brigade&#x27;s infantrymen ran ahead of the tanks and mopped up the German positions, returning with prisoners and greatly impressing the seasoned troops of the North Irish Horse.

The brigade first entered into major combat operations on March 19–20, 1945 at Alfonsine. In its first sustained action on March 19, the brigade killed 19 German soldiers and took 11 prisoner for the loss of 2 dead and 3 wounded in a series of clashes. The brigade then moved to the Senio River sector, where on March 27 it fought against elements of the German 4th Parachute Division commanded by &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Heinrich Trettner.

From April 1-9, the brigade again engaged the Germans in a series of small-scale clashes. It returned to offensive operations during the &quot;Three Rivers Battle&quot;, crossing the Senio River on April 10 and capturing the two positions allocated to it, establishing a bridgehead and widening it the following day. It was assigned to clear out a German redoubt to the left of its position that another Allied unit had failed to capture. The brigade managed to complete the mission in a fierce battle, wiping out all enemy positions in fifteen minutes.

It engaged in a series of small-scale clashes and captured Monte Ghebbio in a battle with German paratroopers. The brigade was then removed from the frontline for rest and refit before the liberation of Bologna (April 21, 1945). The brigade&#x27;s engineering units assisted in bridging the Po River to enable Allied forces to cross it. The Jewish Brigade spent 48 days on the frontline in Italy - March 3 to April 20, 1945.

The commander of the British 10th Corps praised the Jewish Brigade&#x27;s performance:

The Jewish Brigade fought well and its men were eager to make contact with the enemy by any means available to them. Their staff work, their commands and their assessments were good. If they get enough help they certainly deserve to be part of any field force whatsoever.

There are indications that brigade members summarily executed surrendering German soldiers, particularly SS soldiers, in order to take revenge for the Holocaust. Although Brigadier Benjamin urged his troops not to kill surrendering Germans, emphasizing that intelligence gleaned from interrogation of prisoners would hasten the end of the war, he and his staff understood the desire for vengeance among the soldiers, and no Jewish Brigade soldier was ever punished for killing or otherwise mistreating surrendering enemy troops.

The Jewish Brigade was represented among the liberating Allied units at a papal audience. The Jewish Brigade was then stationed in Tarvisio, near the border triangle of Italy, Yugoslavia, and Austria. They searched for Holocaust survivors, provided survivors with aid, and assisted in their immigration to Palestine. They played a key role in the Berihah&#x27;s efforts to help Jews escape Europe for British Mandatory Palestine, a role many of its members were to continue after the Brigade disbanded. Among its projects was the education and care of the Selvino children. In July 1945, the Brigade moved to Belgium and the Netherlands.

During the course of the Second World War, the Jewish Brigade suffered 83 killed in action or died of wounds and 200 wounded. Its dead are buried in the Commonwealth&#x27;s Ravenna War Cemetery at Piangipane.

==Post-war deployment and disbandment==

Tilhas Tizig Gesheften, commonly known by its initials TTG, loosely translated as &quot;kiss [literally, lick] my arse business&quot;, was the name of a group of Jewish Brigade members formed immediately following the Second World War. Under the guise of British military activity, this group engaged in the assassination of Nazis, facilitated the illegal immigration of Holocaust survivors to Mandatory Palestine, and smuggled weaponry to the Haganah.

The Jewish Brigade also joined groups of Holocaust survivors in forming assassination squads known as the Nakam, for the purpose of tracking down and killing former SS and Wehrmacht officers who had participated in atrocities against European Jews. Information regarding the whereabouts of these fugitives was gathered either by torturing imprisoned Nazis or by way of military connections. The British uniforms, military documentation, equipment, and vehicles used by Jewish Brigade veterans greatly contributed to the success of the TTG. The number of Nazis the TTG killed is unknown, but may have been as high as 1,500. There were also at least two instances in which Brigade veterans were implicated in the assassinations of Jewish Kapos. Kangaroo courts executed two Kapos, one by gunshot and another by drowning him in a river.

After assignment to the VIII Corps District of the British Army of the Rhine (Schleswig-Holstein), the Jewish Brigade was disbanded in the summer of 1946.

===Involvement in the Bricha===

Many members of the Jewish Brigade assisted and encouraged the implementation of the Bricha. In the vital, chaotic months immediately before and after the German surrender, members of the Jewish Brigade supplied British Army uniforms and documents to Jewish civilians who were facilitating the illegal immigration of Holocaust survivors to Mandatory Palestine. The most notable example was Yehuda Arazi, code name &quot;Alon,&quot; who had been wanted for two years by the British authorities in Palestine for stealing rifles from the British police and giving them to the Haganah.

In 1945, Arazi and his partner Yitzhak Levy travelled from Mandatory Palestine to Egypt by train, dressed as sergeants from the Royal Engineers. From Egypt, the pair travelled through North Africa to Italy and, using false names, joined the Jewish Brigade, where Arazi secretly became responsible for organising illegal immigration. This included purchasing boats, establishing &quot;hachsharot&quot;, supplying food, and compiling lists of survivors.

When Arazi reached the Jewish Brigade in Tarvisio in June 1945, he informed some of the Haganah members serving in the Brigade that other units had made contact with Jewish survivors. Arazi impressed upon the Brigade their importance in Europe and urged the soldiers to find 5,000 Jewish survivors to bring to Mandatory Palestine. Jewish Brigade officer Aharon Hoter-Yishai recalled that he doubted the existence of 5,000 Jewish survivors. Regardless, the Jewish Brigade accepted Arazi&#x27;s challenge without question. For many Jewish soldiers, this new mission justified their previous service in the British forces that had preceded the creation of the Jewish Brigade.
Another Jewish Brigade soldier actively involved in the Bricha was Israel Carmi, who was discharged from the Jewish Brigade in the autumn of 1945. After a few months, the Secretariat of Kibbutz HaMeuchad approached Carmi about returning to Europe to assist with the Bricha. Carmi&#x27;s previous experience working with survivors made him an important asset for the Bricha movement. He returned to Italy in 1946 and attended the 22nd Zionist Congress in Basel, where he gained insight into how the Berihah operated throughout Europe.

Carmi proposed establishing a second Berihah route across Europe in case the existing route collapsed. He proposed dividing the Bricha leadership into parts: Mordechai Surkis, working from Paris, would be responsible for the financial workings. Ephraim Dekel in Prague would run the administrative element, and oversee the Berihah in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Germany. Carmi, working from Prague, would oversee activities in Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Romania.
Jewish Brigade soldiers, assisting with the Bricha, specifically took advantage of the chaotic situation in post-war Europe to move Holocaust survivors between countries and across borders. Soldiers were intentionally placed by Merkaz Lagolah at transfer points and border crossings to assist the Jewish DPs (displaced persons). For example, Judenberg, a sub-camp of the Mauthausen concentration camp, acted as a Berihah point where Brigade soldiers and partisans worked together to assist DPs. Similarly, in the city of Graz, a Bricha point was centred in a hotel where a legendary Bricha figure, Pinchas Zeitag, also known as Pini the Red or &quot;Gingi,&quot; organised transports westwards to Italy.

One of the Jewish Brigade&#x27;s greatest contributions to the Bricha was the use of their British Army vehicles to transport survivors, up to a thousand people at a time, in truck convoys to Pontebba, the brigade&#x27;s motor depot. These secret transports generally arrived at 2 or 3 a.m., and the Brigade always ensured that DPs were greeted by a soldier or an officer and welcomed into a dining hall with food and tea. Everyone was given a medical examination, a place to sleep, and clean clothing. Within a few days the group was moved to &quot;hachsharot&quot; in Bari, Bologna and Modena. After recuperating and completing their &quot;hachshara&quot; training, the DPs were taken to ports where boats would illegally set sail for Mandatory Palestine. Historians estimate that the Jewish Brigade assisted in the transfer, between 1945 and 1948, of 15,000–22,000 Jewish DPs as part of the Bricha and the illegal immigration movement.

===Military legacy===
In 1948, after the Israeli Declaration of Independence, many Jewish Brigade veterans served with distinction in the Israel Defense Forces during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Many veterans served as high-ranking officers in the Israeli military, with 35 becoming generals.

==Legacy==
===Medals and awards===

Among the brigade&#x27;s soldiers, 78 were mentioned in dispatches, and 20 received military decorations (7 Military Medals, 7 Order of the British Empire medals, 4 Military Crosses, and 2 US awards). Veterans of the Brigade were later entitled to the Volunteer Ribbon and the Fighters against Nazis Medal of the State of Israel.

In October 2018, after a unanimous support vote by the Italian Parliament, the war flag of the Jewish Brigade Group was awarded the Italian &quot;Medaglia d&#x27;Oro al Valor Militare&quot; for its contribution to the liberation of Italy during WW2. The medal was attached to the warflag of the Israeli 7th Armored Brigade, heirs of the Jewish Brigade Group, in a celebration at the Bet Hagdudim (Battalions Museum) in Avihayil.

===Legacy===
The Jewish Brigade inspired numerous memoires, books and films. In 1998, filmmakers Chuck Olin (Director) and Matthew Palm (co-producer) released their award-winning documentary, &quot;In Our Own Hands&quot;. The film aired on PBS in the United States and played in numerous film festivals around the world.

===In popular culture===
In Leon Uris novel &quot;Exodus&quot;, and the subsequent film, protagonist Ari Ben Canaan of the Haganah succeeds in organising the movement of refugees to Palestine, through his experience of action and use of procedures gained during the war as an officer of the Jewish Brigade.

<text>Mount Ball is a mountain located on the Continental Divide, on the borders of Banff and Kootenay national parks in Western Canada. Mt. Ball is the highest peak of the Ball Range in the Canadian Rockies.

The mountain was named in 1858 by James Hector after John Ball, a politician who helped secure funding for the Palliser expedition. The name was officially adopted in 1924 based on Palliser&#x27;s 1863 map of British North America.

Mt. Ball can be ascended from a scrambling route by late summer but involves remote bushwhacking, which limits the number of attempts per year. The trailhead is located at the Marble Canyon Campground in Kootenay National Park.

==Geology==
Mount Ball is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Ball is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. This climate supports glaciers on its slopes. Precipitation runoff from the east slope drains to the Bow River via Redearth Creek, and the west slope drains into tributaries of the Vermilion River.
