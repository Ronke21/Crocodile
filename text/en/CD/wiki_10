<text>The Lockheed Martin Aerial Common Sensor (ACS) platform was a reconnaissance aircraft airframe project for the United States Army (US Army) and United States Navy  (US Navy). The aircraft would have been able to detect troop movements, intercept enemy communications and radar transmissions, and communicate with other aircraft. It would have had synthetic aperture radar, electro-optical and infrared detection instrumentation. The program was cancelled on January 12, 2006.

The Army intended to acquire 34 units, with a further 19 going to the Navy. The initial contract, awarded on August 3, 2004, was valued at $79 million, but total contract value through 2010 would have been $879 million. Beyond that, the total program cost was to reach $7 billion, with only 20–30% going to the platform vendor. The ACS would have replaced three existing Army and Navy platforms—the de Havilland Canada RC-7 ARL, Beechcraft RC-12, Beechcraft RU-21 Guardrail, and Lockheed EP-3E Aries II. Testing was to begin in 2006, and full-rate production would have begun in 2009. While the US Army was fully committed, the US Navy did not and may instead opt for a modified version of the P-8 Poseidon.

The Lockheed Martin entry beat a consortium of Northrop Grumman and Gulfstream Aerospace, using the Gulfstream G450 platform. The competing entry attempted to play up nationalist sympathies, and give the impression of a security risk by using a Brazilian airframe, provided by EMBRAER, using their more affordable, reliable, and cost effective (the latter two being questioned) EMBRAER ERJ 145 platform — Gulfstream&#x27;s airframe did have longer range and could fly at higher altitudes but the acquisition and operational costs (main requirements of DoD for ACS platform) of ERJ 145 were considered much more attractive. Both electronics packages were equivalent and had no major influence in this decision. It was later decided that the ERJ 145 would not suffice due to weight constraints, and thus, while Lockheed was to retain the system integrator role, the Army attempted to re-bid platform entry among several larger aircraft.

EMBRAER were to produce the first five airframes in Brazil (based upon the commercial ERJ 145), while final assembly on following units would have taken place in Jacksonville, Florida, to satisfy Department of Defense workshare requirements. Electronics integration will be conducted by Lockheed Martin at an unannounced site.

Lockheed has faced criticism from the United States Department of Defense (DoD), and specifically, the US Army, for not being able to properly forecast weight issues with the system. The Army claimed in an August 11, 2005 article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that Lockheed could potentially lose the contract if they did not resolve the issue.

ACS was cancelled on January 12, 2006. The Department of Defense paid a contract termination fee of $200 million, nearly all of which was passed on to subcontractors such as Argon ST, Harris Corporation, and L-3 Communications. Most Lockheed Martin and Army personnel were reassigned to other projects.

On November 2, 2006 the US Army revealed it has plans to revive the ACS program in 2009, and conducted an Industry Day in mid-October. The Army continues to envision the ACS program as capable of meeting US Navy ISR needs for a replacement of the EP-3E Aries II.

Boeing is known to have proposed a modified version of the Boeing P-8 Poseidon to fill the ACS role.

The ACS project has since been superseded by EMARSS, based on a smaller aircraft.

<doc id="876028" wikidata="Q5233747" url="?curid=876028" title="David Foreman">
<text>William David Foreman (October 18, 1946 – September 19, 2022) was an American advocate for the conservation of wild lands and wildlife. He was a co-founder of three organizations: Earth First!, the Wildlands Project, and the Rewilding Institute. A prominent member of the radical environmentalism movement beginning in the 1980s, his advocacy and actions shifted in the early 1990s into collaborations with professionals in the field of conservation biology.

== Early life and education ==
William David Foreman was born on October 18, 1946, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. His father was a United States Air Force sergeant and later an air traffic controller. Foreman attended San Antonio Junior College before transferring to the University of New Mexico, from which he graduated in 1967 with a degree in history.

==Early career==
In his early life he was active in conservative politics, campaigning for Barry Goldwater and forming the Young Americans for Freedom conservative youth chapter on his junior college campus. In 1968, Foreman joined the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27; Marine Officer Candidates School in Quantico, Virginia, and received an undesirable discharge after 61 days. He then worked as a teacher at a Zuni Indian reservation in New Mexico, where he also worked as a farrier.

== Activism and environmentalist work ==

===The Wilderness Society===

Between 1973 and 1980, he worked for The Wilderness Society as Southwest Regional Representative in New Mexico and the Director of Wilderness Affairs in Washington, D.C.

===Earth First!===

In April 1980, Foreman and friends Howie Wolke, Ron Kezar, Bart Koehler, and Mike Roselle took a week-long hiking trip in the Pinacate Desert. It was during this trip that Foreman is believed to have coined the phrase &quot;Earth First!&quot; The movement that subsequently bore that name was inspired, in some part, by the writings of Edward Abbey, author of the novel &quot;The Monkeywrench Gang&quot;. The group used direct action tactics, and in contrast with the cautious lobbying efforts of the established environmental organizations, &quot;monkeywrenching&quot;—industrial sabotage traditionally associated with labor struggles—would become the chief tactic of the Earth First! movement in the 1980s. The &quot;Earth First! Journal&quot;, which grew out of the Earth First! newsletter, was edited by Foreman. In its first issue, Foreman set out the organization&#x27;s goals: &quot;We will not make political compromises. Let the other outfits do that. EARTH FIRST will set forth the pure, hard-line, radical position of those who believe in the Earth first.&quot; Some mainstream environmentalists and others accused Foreman of promoting eco-terrorism.

In 1990, Foreman was one of five people arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation following operation THERMCON, in which FBI agents infiltrated an Arizona Earth First! group, encouraging them to sabotage a powerline feeding a water pumping station. While Foreman had no direct role in the attempted sabotage, he ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for handing two copies of &quot;Ecodefense&quot; to an FBI informant, and received a suspended sentence.

By the late 1980s, Earth First! had split into two ideological factions; Foreman and others adhered to a biocentrist view characterized by &quot;apocalyptic biodiversity&quot; but were increasingly challenged by a &quot;millenarianist social justice faction&quot; influenced by the movement&#x27;s Northern California-based members, including Roselle (who was based in Berkeley) and Judi Bari (of Mendocino County). After less than a decade, Foreman left Earth First!, disillusioned by the changing character of the organization. Foreman described himself &quot;a redneck for the environment&quot; and objected to the left-wing, social justice-oriented approach of younger environmental activists who had joined the group. Foreman and his wife, Nancy Morton, publicly split with Earth First! in 1990, writing in a letter at the time that the group had taken on an &quot;overtly counterculture/anti-establishment style&quot; influenced by the group&#x27;s California wing. Roselle, in turn, denounced Foreman as &quot;an unrepentant right-wing thug.&quot;

===After leaving Earth First!===
After leaving Earth First!, Foreman co-founded the Wildlands Network in 1991. The group aimed to establish a network of protected wilderness areas across North America. In 2003, Foreman later created a think tank, the Rewilding Institute. The New Mexico-based institute promoted policy proposals for long-term land conservation.

From 1996 to 1998, he served on the Sierra Club&#x27;s board of directors, but departed after the organization rejected his proposed policy on restrictive immigration.

=== Controversy===
In a 1986 interview, Foreman said the United States should not provide aid for the Ethiopia famine and hunger crisis, but rather, &quot;let nature seek its own balance.&quot; He later clarified his position, stating, &quot;I have serious doubts and nagging questions about conventional &#x27;humanitarian&#x27; foreign aid responses to the increasing problem of famine in the Third World. That is what I was trying to get at in my comments on famine in Ethiopia. In my oft-quoted remark about famine in Ethiopia, however, I failed to clearly make this point. Indeed, I implied through my sloppy, off-the-cuff remark that famine was purely a biological question of too many people and too few resources, completely unrelated to social organization, economic exploitation, or international relations. I also implied that the best possible social response was for us to do nothing, offer no assistance of any kind, and to just let the hungry starve. I very much regret the way I phrased these comments. Standing by themselves, out of context, they sound truly cold hearted.&quot;

Foreman was criticized for his anti-immigration statements, such as when he said, “letting the USA be an overflow valve for problems in Latin America is not solving a thing. It’s just putting more pressure on the resources we have in the USA.&quot; He later sought to clarify his statements by saying, &quot;While I still believe that massive and unlimited immigration into any country is a serious problem, I do not support beefing up the Border Patrol and the other agencies that try to keep Latin Americans out of this country. I do not think that this is a realistic or ethical response to the underlying problem.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;While I agree that the population question can be approached in narrow, racist, and fascistic ways, I strenuously reject the idea that any and all ecologically-grounded concerns about human overpopulation are racist and fascist. Is it racist and fascist, for example, to propose making birth control methods and devices, including the French abortion pill and sterilization, freely available to any woman or man in the world who desires them?&quot; 

Some of the goals of the Wildlands Network have been characterized as &quot;lofty scientific ideals&quot; since it could take 100 years to realize some outcomes. Its founders, including Foreman, replied that they &quot;did not want to compete with existing conservation groups. They wanted to create a framework those groups could work within and a clearinghouse for information and science.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Foreman formerly lived in Tucson, Arizona. He married Debbie Sease in 1976; they subsequently divorced. He married Nancy Morton in 1986, and she died in 2021.

Foreman died in Albuquerque on September 19, 2022, from interstitial lung disease at the age of 75. He remained active in environmentalist causes until his death.

<doc id="876030" wikidata="Q4883312" url="?curid=876030" title="Bell housing">
<text>Bellhousing (aka bell-housing or bell) is a colloquial term for the component that aligns and connects the transmission of a vehicle to its engine, and which covers and protects the flywheel/clutch or flexplate/torque converter. It derives its name from the bell-like shape that those internal components necessitate. The starter motor may mount to it, and it may support clutch and/or shifter linkage.

A Bellhousing may be a separate housing bolted to the gearbox, or it may be an integral portion of the transmission housing, particularly with front wheel drive transmissions. An integral bell has a front bolt pattern that matches the engine to which it will be paired, and a divorced bell additionally has a rear bolt pattern that matches the gearbox to which it will be paired. The use of different bellhousings on a transmission allows the same transmission to be used on multiple engines in multiple applications.

<text>The Courts Act 1971 (c. 23) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the purpose of which was to reform and modernise the courts system of England and Wales, as well as effectively separating the business of the criminal and civil courts.

It established the Crown Court, introduced the posts of circuit judge and recorder, and abolished various local courts across the country. Many of its provisions have since been repealed by the Senior Courts Act 1981, but the essential structure described in the act is still in place.

The first part of the act concerns the new Crown Court. It is established as part of the Supreme Court of Judicature, replacing courts of assize and quarter sessions. The appellate jurisdiction of these courts is transferred, and the new court given exclusive jurisdiction in &quot;trial on indictment&quot;. It is described as a &quot;superior court of record&quot; for England and Wales. This section has now been superseded by the Senior Courts Act 1981.

==History==

&quot;Report of the Royal Commission on Assizes and Quarter Sessions&quot; (Sessional Papers, House of Commons, Cmnd 4153, 1966–69, XXVIII, 433) was published in 1969 and chaired by Dr. Beeching. The Act was based on most of the report recommendations.

The courts abolished by this act are:
* all assize courts
* all quarter sessions
* The Court of Chancery of the County Palatine of Lancaster (merged with the High Court)
* The Court of Chancery of the County Palatine of Durham and Sadberge (merged with the High Court)
* The Mayor&#x27;s and City of London Court (a new county court is established with the same name)
* The Tolzey and Pie Poudre Courts of the City and County of Bristol
* The Liverpool Court of Passage
* The Norwich Guildhall Court
* The Court of Record for the Hundred of Salford
The officers of these courts were generally eligible to become circuit judges.

The post of circuit judge is introduced in the second part of the Act. They sit in the Crown Court and county courts, are appointed by the monarch on the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s advice, and retire at the age of 72 (this has now been changed to 70 by the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993). The Lord Chancellor may also sack a circuit judge on the grounds of &quot;incapacity or misbehaviour&quot;. Judges are to have a salary and pension, and must take an oath of office. The act also introduces part-time Crown Court judges, known as recorders—also appointed by the Lord Chancellor. (Since the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, appointing judges has been reformed and is now done by the Judicial Appointments Commission in England and Wales, and equivalent bodies in Scotland and Northern Ireland.)

The fourth part of the Courts Act governs the selection of juries and related rules; it has since been repealed by the Juries Act 1974. Most of the remainder of the Act is about other miscellaneous administrative provisions relating to appointments, payment, and accommodation; these have almost all been repealed by the Supreme Court Act and other justice legislation.

<text>George Martin Weiss (June 23, 1894 – August 13, 1972) was an American professional baseball executive. Elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971, Weiss was one of the Major Leagues&#x27; most successful farm system directors and general managers during his 29-year-long tenure with the New York Yankees.

Working as the head of the Yankees&#x27; player-development system from 1932 to 1947, he established it as one of the two best in the game, helping the &quot;Bronx Bombers&quot; win nine American League (AL) pennants and eight World Series championships over 16 seasons. Then, during Weiss&#x27; 13 full years as the Yankees&#x27; general manager from October to October , the team won ten AL pennants and seven more World Series titles, compiling a regular-season winning percentage of .622 (1,243–756). He later became the first club president of the New York Mets from to after that expansion franchise was formed.

==Early life and career==
Weiss was born in New Haven, Connecticut, and attended Yale University for a year before dropping out to help run his family&#x27;s grocery store. In 1915, at age 20, he founded the New Haven MaxFeds in the independent Colonial League, an &quot;outlaw&quot; minor league associated with the Federal League. In , Weiss borrowed $5,000 to acquire the New Haven franchise in the established Class A Eastern League; his team was immediately nicknamed the &quot;Weissmen&quot; by local baseball writers. He operated the New Haven club, eventually nicknamed the &quot;Profs&quot; in tribute to Yale, for a decade; it won three league championships between 1920 and 1928. In 1930, Weiss took over the front office of the Baltimore Orioles of the Class AA International League for two seasons.

==New York Yankees==
===Farm system director===
In , at 37, he was hired by Yankees&#x27; owner Jacob Ruppert and general manager Ed Barrow to build up the club&#x27;s farm system, a concept that had been pioneered in the National League by the St. Louis Cardinals and was the linchpin of the Cardinals&#x27; dominance of the senior circuit. Weiss grew the Yankee system from four farm teams in 1931 to 16 by ; then, after a four-year retrenchment caused by World War II, to 20 by . Headed by the Yanks&#x27; longtime top affiliates, the Newark Bears and Kansas City Blues, it churned out many of the players who would lead the Bombers to 15 world championships through , including skeins of four (1936–39) and five (1949–53) straight World Series triumphs. The Weiss farm system produced three Hall of Famers—Yogi Berra, Joe Gordon and Phil Rizzuto (Joe DiMaggio was acquired directly from the independently owned San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League)—as well as longtime stalwarts such as Hank Bauer, Tiny Bonham, Hank Borowy, Bobby Brown, Spud Chandler, Jerry Coleman, Charlie Keller, Johnny Murphy, Joe Page, Vic Raschi and Red Rolfe. The 1937 Bears (third) and 1939 Blues (12th) have been ranked among the top dozen clubs in minor-league history.

Weiss was retained and named a club vice president by the Yankees&#x27; new ownership triumvirate, Larry MacPhail, Dan Topping and Del Webb, when they purchased the team in early 1945. He then served under the new owners for three full seasons, as World War II ended and baseball entered a postwar boom.

As both club president and general manager, MacPhail was the dominant figure in the Yankees&#x27; postwar hierarchy. On October 6, 1947, hours after the Yankees won the seventh and deciding game of the 1947 World Series, MacPhail—a notorious drinker with a combustible temper—unexpectedly announced his resignation from both front-office posts during the victory festivities. In a drunken state, he confronted several officials at the celebration, including both Weiss and Topping. Weiss was sitting at a banquet table with his wife when MacPhail loudly and abruptly fired him as the Yankees&#x27; farm system director. Topping, upon being berated by MacPhail, grabbed him, escorted him to a nearby room, and calmed him down, while Webb, who had witnessed MacPhail&#x27;s tantrum, assured Weiss he would remain with the team. The outburst ended MacPhail&#x27;s baseball career. The next day, October 7, Topping and Webb bought out his one-third share in the Yankees, and promoted Weiss to vice president and general manager.

===General manager===
Although Topping succeeded MacPhail as club president, for all intents and purposes, Weiss became the operating head of the franchise; Topping and Webb largely left day-to-day operations in Weiss&#x27;s hands. In his first major trade as general manager, in February 1948, he acquired left-handed pitcher Eddie Lopat from the Chicago White Sox for three players, including former starting catcher Aaron Robinson; Lopat would win 113 games for the Yanks in his 7 years in the Bronx. After the Yankees finished third, Weiss fired manager Bucky Harris and replaced him with veteran former National League skipper Casey Stengel. The 58-year-old Stengel had never produced a first-division team in nine attempts as manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Braves. But in the 12 years from 1949 through 1960, the Weiss-Stengel tandem would win ten AL pennants and seven world titles (1949–53; 1956; 1958). Even when their five-season run as world champions ended in , the Yankees won 103 regular-season games (to finish second, by eight lengths, to the Cleveland Indians).

The Yankee farm system produced two more Hall of Famers early in Weiss&#x27;s GM tenure, Whitey Ford and Mickey Mantle, and continued to contribute key members of their 1950s teams. When it began to falter somewhat in mid-decade, Weiss swung a series of multiplayer trades with second-division teams, first with the Baltimore Orioles and then, frequently, with the Kansas City Athletics, to keep the Bombers at the forefront of their league. These transactions netted the Yankees top players such as Bob Turley, Don Larsen, Bobby Shantz, Art Ditmar, Ryne Duren, Ralph Terry, Clete Boyer and Héctor López. But they also began to struggle in World Series play, losing to Brooklyn in 1955 and the Milwaukee Braves in 1957. In , they won only 79 of 154 games and fell all the way to third, behind the White Sox and Indians. It was the only season during Weiss&#x27;s time as general manager in which the Bombers failed to win at least 92 games.

He responded by acquiring outfielder Roger Maris from Kansas City in a seven-player transaction in December 1959. A 25-year-old budding star, Maris would win back-to-back American League Most Valuable Player Awards in and and, in the latter year, smash 61 home runs in his record-setting chase of Babe Ruth&#x27;s single-season mark. But by the 1961 season, Weiss was gone from the Yankees&#x27; front office. After Maris helped the 1960 club return to the top of the American League standings, they were again defeated in that year&#x27;s World Series, this time by the Pittsburgh Pirates. In the days following the World Series, both Stengel and Weiss were forced into retirement. A longtime assistant, Roy Hamey, succeeded Weiss as general manager. The Yankees then won four more pennants in succession, along with the 1961 and 1962 World Series.

==New York Mets==
Weiss and Stengel both ended up with the Mets, set to return National League baseball to New York City in 1962, four seasons after the departure of the Dodgers and New York Giants for California. Weiss was named president and &quot;de facto&quot; general manager of the Mets in March 1961, and Stengel followed as manager in . In the expansion draft, Weiss selected a roster composed largely of veterans who had played for and against the last New York editions of the Dodgers and Giants, including Gil Hodges, Roger Craig, Don Zimmer, Gus Bell, Ed Bouchee and Hobie Landrith. He supplemented these drafted players by acquiring former Brooklyn stars Duke Snider, Charlie Neal, Clem Labine and Billy Loes, and veterans Richie Ashburn, Frank Thomas, Gene Woodling and ex-Yankee prospect Marv Throneberry—among many others—during and .

The on-field results were historically poor. The 1962 Mets put up the worst record (40–120) in recent MLB history, and the 1963, 1964 and 1965 teams lost 111, 109 and 112 games. The Met farm system was slow to contribute useful players; by Opening Day 1966, it had yielded Cleon Jones, Ed Kranepool, Tug McGraw, Ron Swoboda and Bud Harrelson, but only Jones and Kranepool saw service before 1965. Weiss also passed on Reggie Jackson in the 1966 Major League Baseball Draft, instead selecting Steve Chilcott.

In his five seasons as general manager, the Mets escaped last place in the National League only in Weiss&#x27;s last year. They compiled a composite record of 260–547 (.322). He retired at age 72 on November 14, 1966, and was succeeded by former Cardinal GM Bing Devine. But despite their poor play, the Mets established a dedicated fan base from their first season in existence, and when they left the dilapidated Polo Grounds for their new home, Shea Stadium, in 1964 they outdrew the pennant-winning Yankees, 1.73 to 1.3 million fans. They would dominate New York baseball attendance until 1976, when their American League rivals moved into a renovated Yankee Stadium and won the pennant.

==Later life and legacy==
Weiss was named &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; Executive of the Year in 1950, 1951, 1952, and 1960. In 1971, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, one of seven selected for that year&#x27;s honor. All of the inductees had been selected by the Veterans Committee; no players were elected through the regular voting process of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America.

Weiss died in Greenwich, Connecticut, at age 78 in 1972. Stengel lamented his death, saying, &quot;George&#x27;s death is a tough thing on baseball. He was successful and great and capable in every way, shape and form. He wasn&#x27;t a terrific mixer but George sure knew how to pick men. Why, you can&#x27;t stay in baseball that long by pulling players out of an icebox.&quot; Yogi Berra said that Weiss could be difficult to deal with, but he praised the emotion that Weiss brought to the game as well as his understanding of the importance of scouting. He was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1982.

With the debut of Elston Howard on April 14, 1955, the Yankees became the sixth of the eight American League teams—and the last of New York City&#x27;s three big-league clubs—to break the baseball color line. According to the book &quot;Yogi Berra: Eternal Yankee&quot;, Weiss at a cocktail party stated loudly that &quot;he would never allow a black man to wear a Yankee uniform.&quot; The Yankees farm system had in place a policy preventing black players from reaching the major league club, according to the book. Howard, the first African-American Yankee, was switched from an outfielder to a catcher, the position at which it would be least likely to break into the major league club, given Berra&#x27;s presence.

Conflicting opinions have since been expressed about the reasons behind the Yankees&#x27; relative tardiness in integrating their playing roster. In their 2016 book, &quot;George Weiss: Architect of the Golden Age Yankees&quot;, authors Burton A. and Benita W. Boxerman devote a full chapter to the issue and explore some of the motivations that have been attributed to Weiss, both during and after his career. They write:

Even though the delay in integrating the Yankees was likely a combination of factors including financial success, outstanding performance, unproductive scouts, and possibly the owners&#x27; bias against Negroes, it was Weiss, the chief decision-maker in the system, who was held responsible for the lack of a black Yankee. Did deep personal bigotries drive his decisions to delay integrating the Yankees as long as he could? Writers such as Roger Kahn and David Halberstam called him vicious and unable to empathize with any players, especially Negroes. It seemed a much more probable scenario that Weiss&#x27;s true reason ... was pretty much what he declared when he was asked point-blank why there were no black Yankees: namely, that he was determined to choose a black player who would fit the &quot;Yankee mould.&quot;

On a contrary note, Steve Goldman, writing in the SBNation Yankee community &quot;Pinstripe Alley&quot; in April 2013, said that Weiss:

... clung to the excuse of so many clubs: We&#x27;re not going to promote just anyone to the majors because they happen to be black; we&#x27;re holding out for someone special ... By that standard, of course, only the black Babe Ruth or Lou Gehrig was going to get the call.

<text>Jules-Paul Tardivel (2 September 1851 – 24 April 1905) was an American–Canadian writer and a promoter of Quebec nationalism.

Tardivel was born in Covington, Kentucky, and sent to Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, for his classical education in the French language. Despite learning French only in his late teens, he became a tireless promoter of French Quebec and detractor of anglicisms.

In July 1874 Tardivel began work in Quebec City on &quot;Le Canadien&quot;, another paper dedicated to the interests of the Conservative Party. In the 1880s, he founded &quot;La Verité&quot;, a weekly newspaper extolling his religious, political and social beliefs. Perennial topics included conspiracy theories (typically aimed at Freemasons, socialists, communists, freethinkers, or any combination thereof), conservative Roman Catholic dogma, the domination of Quebec by English Canada, and the subversive effects of the Boy Scout movement. It survived his death, under the editorship of his son, until it ceased publication circa 1920.

In the 1890s, he wrote a futuristic &quot;roman à clef&quot; about Canadian politics called &quot;Pour la Patrie&quot; (translated into English the 1970s as &quot;For My Country&quot;). In it, he accused John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada, of being a Freemason who conspired with the devil to oppress Quebec and to crush the French language.

<text>Hayduke Lives!, written in 1989 by Edward Abbey, is the sequel to the popular book &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;. It was published posthumously in 1990 in a mildly unfinished state, as Abbey did not complete revision prior to his death. Thus, the book retains much of its author&#x27;s unrefined musings.

&quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; and &quot;Hayduke Lives!&quot; have been reprinted numerous times due to their popularity.

==Summary==

&quot;Hayduke Lives!&quot; picks up several years after the (literal) cliffhanger and escape from the posse at the end of the previous book. It chronicles George Washington Hayduke&#x27;s return to the deserts of southern Utah and northern Arizona, where he continues the sabotage initiated in &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; under numerous aliases, such as The Green Baron, and Fred Goodsell. The enigmatic &quot;Kemosabe&quot; (a hero from Abbey&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Brave Cowboy&quot;) also makes a reappearance, coming to the aid of Hayduke after his escape from the posse.

For a grand finale, Abbey reunites Hayduke with the outlaw-heroes of &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; as they plan the destruction the world&#x27;s largest walking dragline excavator (giant earth mover, also called GEM or Goliath, used for surface mining) while combating a greed-ridden Mormon Bishop in another attempt to save the American Southwest from development. The narrative shifts numerous times between characters neglected by the previous book, including Bishop Love, the wives of Seldom Seen Smith and the FBI agents sent to end the sabotage.

== Earth First! ==

While &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; inspired the creation of the movement Earth First!, the latter is cited in &quot;Hayduke Lives!&quot; (notably in chapters 12, 24 and 27).

In &quot;Hayduke Lives!&quot;, the people active for Earth First! wear t-shirts and banners with slogans such as:

<doc id="876047" wikidata="Q5321958" url="?curid=876047" title="E. J. Lennox">
<text>Edward James Lennox (September 12, 1854 – April 15, 1933) was a Toronto-based architect who designed several of the city&#x27;s most notable landmarks in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including Old City Hall and Casa Loma. He designed over 70 buildings in the city of Toronto.

==Life and career==

The son of Irish immigrants, he studied at the Mechanics&#x27; Institute in Toronto, where he finished first in his class. Upon graduation in 1874, he apprenticed with architect William Irving for five years. He then formed a partnership with fellow architect William Frederick McCaw, before forming his own firm in 1881.

He quickly became one of the most successful architects in Toronto. He rose to the top of his profession when he won the contract for Toronto City Hall in 1886. His caricature can be seen carved in stone on the facade of Old City Hall—he&#x27;s the one with the handlebar moustache.

Many of his buildings were designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, and he was one of the most important figures in bringing that style to Toronto. His creative prowess in the Romanesque Revival style was especially important in The Annex neighbourhood, where Lennox designed the Lewis Lukes House at 37 Madison Avenue in the mid-1880s, pioneering the Annex House. This style of house is indigenous to Toronto, and it blends elements of Romanesque with that of Queen Anne style.

Later in his life, he served as commissioner of the Toronto Transit Commission from 1923 to 1929.

==Legacy==
A small residential street called E.J. Lennox Way is named for him in Unionville, Ontario, behind the former Unionville Congregational Church.

His son Edgar Edward Lennox was also an architect, as well as brother Charles David Lennox, who worked with E. J. Lennox from 1887 to 1915.

Susan M. Lennox great grand daughter of Charles David Lennox and great great niece of E. J. Lennox also an Architect. Graduate of University of Toronto 1992 Bachelor of Architecture. Co-Founder of Lennox Architects Limited Huntsville Ontario with Susana Marques.

<text>Bazooka Tooth is the fourth studio album by American hip hop artist Aesop Rock. It was released on Definitive Jux in 2003.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Bazooka Tooth&quot; received generally favorable reviews from critics. Metacritic gave the album a score of 74 out of 100, based on 16 reviews.

Rollie Pemberton of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called &quot;Bazooka Tooth&quot; &quot;another strong outing from one of underground hip-hop&#x27;s most talented, thanks in no small part to its unprecedented wealth of lyrical depth and individual production style.&quot; Thomas Quinlan of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; commented that &quot;Aesop drops abstract poetry, heartfelt stories and new millennial b-boyisms in his gruff monotone flow.&quot; Francis Henville of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; noted that &quot;the beats feel somewhat restrained, lethargic and lazy&quot; and &quot;they are perfectly suited to Aesop&#x27;s limpid down-tempo rhymes.&quot;

Meanwhile, John Bush of AllMusic felt that &quot;Bazooka Tooth&quot; lacks &quot;the catchy, sample-driven flavor&quot; of &quot;Labor Days&quot;. David Morris of &quot;PopMatters&quot; gave the album an unfavorable review and said, &quot;&quot;Bazooka Tooth&quot; is almost a textbook example of what happens when a previously struggling artist gets a handful of success&quot;.

In 2013, Danny Brown named it one of his 25 favorite albums.

<text>Blair Hull (born September 3, 1942) is an American businessman, investor, and Democratic politician.

Hull founded Hull Trading Company in 1985 and served as the firm&#x27;s Chairman and chief executive officer before selling it to Goldman Sachs in 1999 for $531 million. The company, which leveraged technological innovations and quantitative models, was one of the world&#x27;s premier market-making firms, trading on 28 exchanges in nine countries. Hull went on to found Hull Investments, LLC in 1999 which serves as a family office for three generations of the Hull family, and acts as parent company to a number of financial entities. In 2009, Hull founded Ketchum Trading, LLC, a proprietary trading firm that traded and provided liquidity in futures, options, cash equities and exchange-traded funds. And in 2013, Hull created Hull Tactical Asset Allocation, LLC. HTAA operates an actively managed ETF and utilizes advanced algorithms as well as macro and technical indicators to anticipate future market returns.

Trader Monthly recognized him for having executed one of &quot;The 40 Greatest Trades of All Time&quot; and Worth Magazine named him one of &quot;Wall Street’s 25 Smartest Players.&quot; Hull has also been honored by The Options Industry Council as the 2014 recipient of the Joseph W. Sullivan Options Industry Achievement Award&quot; in recognition of his outstanding lifetime contributions to the growth and integrity of the U.S. options market.

A longtime political activist and donor, Blair Hull sought the Illinois Democratic Party nomination as candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2004 as a champion of universal healthcare and efficiency in government. Barack Obama ultimately won that primary. Blair Hull remains active in the political arena as both an activist and donor. Hull is married to Cynthia Cranmer Erb, and is father to four adult children: Kristin, Megan, Jeff, and Courtney.

==Early life and education==

===Early years===
Blair Hull was born in 1942, the son of Marson Hull and Jean Matlock Hull, and raised in Los Gatos, California—near what would later be called Silicon Valley. After completing high school, Hull went to work on the assembly line of a cannery factory to help support his family, ultimately joining Union Local 679 and earning himself a union card by the age of 19.

During the Vietnam buildup, Hull served six years in the United States Army. After reaching the rank of lieutenant and completing his military service, Blair Hull turned to the classroom, teaching high school level math and physics before becoming a student again himself and going on to higher education with the GI Bill, as his father had done before him.

He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics from the University of California, Santa Barbara, his MBA from Santa Clara University and graduated from the Harvard &quot;Owner/President Management&quot; Program.

While working full-time at a manufacturing company, Hull tested his mathematical and analytical skills at the blackjack tables in Las Vegas, where he proved to be a skilled and disciplined player. Hull took his accumulated winnings to the Pacific Stock Exchange, then to the Chicago financial exchanges. Once there, he established himself as a pioneer in the trading industry, revolutionizing the financial markets through the use of innovative models and state-of-the-art technology.

As Founder of Hull Trading Company, Blair Hull built a business from scratch in Illinois, created hundreds of jobs, and grew his company into one of the most successful trading firms in the country.

==Blackjack==
In 2022, Blair Hull was inducted into the Blackjack Hall of Fame, an organization that honors
the greatest blackjack experts, authors and professional players in history. Hull was a big player in Al Francesco’s blackjack team in the mid-’70s, is responsible for the Hall of Fame’s success in forming its own 501-C3 Charitable Foundation, and is also the recipient of the first “Ed Thorp Lifetime Achievement Award.” 

Trained in mathematics and computer science, Blair Hull first applied his skills and training to advantage play in blackjack, and then went on to develop an empirical model independent of Black–Scholes to use on the financial markets. Throughout the 1970s, Hull honed his system on the casino floors. As one of the “Big Players” on Al Francesco’s storied blackjack team, Blair beat the odds, or rather, beat the house by shifting the edge in his favor. By utilizing mathematical systems - first Edward O. Thorp&#x27;s 10 Count Card system, and later Lawrence Revere&#x27;s Advanced Point Count system - Hull and a team of skilled card players were able to determine when they gained an advantage over the dealer, and how best to bet to exploit that advantage. They consistently turned a profit, and their story is outlined in the book &quot;The Big Player&quot; by Ken Uston.
:::&quot;When Hull played blackjack, he saw it not as a risk-taking endeavor but rather “a clear financial opportunity that other people did not see.” With the right system, blackjack became a positive-expectation game: Statistically speaking, Hull had to win (over the long haul at least). Similarly, he would have been loath to enter the options market without what he perceived as an advantage. At the Pacific Exchange, Hull’s equivalent to card counting was the exploitation of his computer-generated theoretical-value sheets. Based on an option-pricing model of Hull’s own invention (similar to the Black–Scholes model, though he was unaware of their work at the time), the sheets told him what each option was truly worth at a particular stock price—and he would buy or sell accordingly to exploit the spread. The system worked.&quot; –&quot;MBA Jungle&quot;

Hull left the blackjack tables with $25,000 and took his winnings to the markets—first leasing a seat on the Pacific Stock Exchange, then starting a firm on the Chicago financial exchanges.

==Business career==

===Hull Trading Company===
* Hull Trading Company 1985–1999
Blair Hull founded Hull Trading Company in 1985 and served as the firm&#x27;s chairman and CEO.

The company was a global leader in the application of computer technology to listed derivatives trading. Hull developed a proprietary and large scale reliable distributed system architecture, providing automatic real-time pricing, risk management, market making and interconnection with automated options, futures and stock exchanges as they became available. Hull&#x27;s massively scalable software technology was deployed to cover both domestic and international markets as electronic, on-line exchanges became available, while innovative hand-held computer technology was employed at exchanges still requiring execution by floor traders.

:::&quot;The trading room at Hull headquarters looks like NASA mission control. Powerful workstations process streams of financial data, flashing advice to the handhelds carried by Hull traders at the CBOE and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Different workstations track the firm&#x27;s risk profile, sending handheld-equipped traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange instructions about how to use futures contracts to hedge trades being made at the CBOE and the CBOT.
:::The goal of this remarkable technological firepower is simple: not to take big risks but to find sure things. Hull&#x27;s computers search the markets for temporary price imperfections, devise transactions to profit from the imperfections, and hedge those bets to protect against other risks. It&#x27;s a lot like blackjack. &quot;All you need is a mathematical advantage and the controls to ensure that you stay in the game,&quot; Hull argues. &quot;Everything else takes care of itself.&quot; –&quot;Fast Compa&quot;

The firm grew to over 250 employees including financial engineers, physicists, almost 100 software engineers and computer support staff. At its peak, Hull Trading Company moved nearly a quarter of the entire daily market volume on some markets, executed over 7% of the index options traded in the United States, 3% of the equity options, and 1% of all shares traded daily on the New York Stock Exchange.
:::&quot;His computers trade stocks faster than the human eye can see them scroll on a screen. The system is designed to predict patterns that will unfold in the market over periods as short as two minutes. In a business that isn&#x27;t normally modest about its technological savvy, Hull and his automated trading shop are the envy of Wall Street&#x27;s top firms.&quot; – &quot;Worth Magazine&quot;

In 1999, Blair Hull sold his company to Goldman Sachs for $531 million.

* Donor
Blair Hull has been a longtime financial supporter of Democratic causes and candidates across the country campaigning for a wide range of local, state, and national offices.

===2004 U.S. Senate race===

Blair Hull ran in the 2004 Illinois Democratic Primary to be the party&#x27;s United States Senate nominee. The Senate seat had been vacated by retiring Republican Senator Peter Fitzgerald.
Hull&#x27;s candidacy brought a unique background to the crowded Democratic field.

:::&quot;...As a former high school teacher, union worker, and board member of NARAL, [Hull] appeals to important Democratic constituencies; as the lone veteran in the field, he can oppose the war in Iraq unquestioned. His unusual life story, too, sets Hull apart from the drab lawyers, state representatives, and political scions who normally pursue office in Illinois.&quot; – &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;




Hull was unique among the candidate field: he was an Army veteran, had been a card-carrying union member, had taught students as a high school math teacher, and was a successful businessman who had built a business and created jobs in Illinois.
During the campaign, Hull railed against the corporate special interests and their influence in Washington. He advocated universal healthcare, greater efficiency in government, campaign finance reform, and re-importation of prescription drugs.

Hull garnered nationwide attention for inviting scores of prescription-drug dependent senior citizens aboard his campaign buses to travel across the US/ Canada border into Windsor, Ontario where they could purchase their medications at dramatically lower prices. The trips served to focus media attention on the rising costs of American healthcare, and to frame the debate as the campaign moved forward.

Hull largely self-funded his campaign for Senate, spending $29 million of his own money on the race. His early start, compelling profile, considerable fortune, and heavy campaign advertising on television ensured that Hull led the crowded Democratic field for much of the primary race. 
While Hull topped the polls till the final weeks of the campaign, Barack Obama succeeded in winning the election. Blair Hull finished third. Hull&#x27;s numbers dropped late in the race following allegations of marital issues. Hull held the record on the most money self-funded by a candidate in a U.S. Senate primary election until 2024, when U.S. representative David Trone gave his campaign over $40 million during the primary of the 2024 United States Senate election in Maryland. Hull remains active in Democratic politics, both as an activist and a donor.

<text>The Cambridge Folk Festival is an annual music festival, established in 1965, held in the grounds of Cherry Hinton Hall in Cherry Hinton, one of the villages subsumed by the city of Cambridge, England. The festival is known for its eclectic mix of music and a wide definition of what might be considered folk. It occurs over a long weekend (3½ days) in summer at Cherry Hinton Hall. Until 2008 it was sponsored by BBC Radio 2, which broadcast it live, with highlights were recorded and shown later and occasionally live on digital television channel BBC Four from 2002 to 2009 and from 2010 to 2012 on Sky Arts.

== History ==
Recent histories have obscured the early origins of the folk festival. Ken Woollard&#x27;s &quot;1974 Ten years of folk: A history of the Cambridge Folk Festival&quot; mentions three councillors who had an idea for a festival (but does not name them).

Ken Woollard was the first director of the Cambridge Folk Festival in 1965, and continued to work as Festival Organiser and Artistic Director up until his death in 1993. This role was then taken up by Eddie Barcan, who had worked as Ken&#x27;s assistant from 1990. Eddie Barcan was replaced by Rebecca Stewart in 2015

Laing and Newman&#x27;s 1994 book &quot;Thirty Years of the Cambridge Folk Festival&quot; (based in part on conversations with Ken Woollard) acknowledges the three councillors and names them on part of the first page that covers the setting up of festival. These key figures responsible for setting up and founding the Cambridge Folk festival are named as Paul Rayment, Philip Abrams and George Scurfield.

The role of Paul Rayment (1933–2013) is particularly relevant in the origins and establishment of the Cambridge folk festival (in the context of left wing 1960s political developments).

The setting up took about nine months and was developed by Paul Rayment, Philip Abrams and George Scurfield before Ken Woollard was asked to run the festival. In the 1960s the Rayments, Sharkeys, Scurfields and Woollards were all associated with Cambridge Labour Party and the folk club to greater or lesser extents. Jack Sharkey had the original idea which may have been linked to &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot; (1958), the documentary film set at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island, and he involved Paul Rayment. Jack Sharkey also had the idea to hold the festival at Cherry Hinton Hall, and his engagement with folk music was instrumental to the original initiative.

Paul Rayment&#x27;s initiative, drive, commitment and political skill produced the folk festival. In his role as a councillor, he suggested the festival site of Cherry Hinton, managed the electrics of the first festival and volunteered to stay the night in the marquee for the first festival; there was no security. The other key figures who developed the festival were Philip Abrams, a professor of sociology who saw it as a social initiative, and George Scurfield, an author, poet, and politician, whose abilities and sense of adventure and were vital to the establishment of the festival. The 1965 festival was the fruit of a Labour-dominant council in a traditionally conservative area and particularly the endeavours of Paul Rayment. The founding of the Cambridge Folk festival reflects its subsequent diversity when a war hero poet and politician worked with an eminent sociologist and a politically-driven electrician (brought up in a children&#x27;s home) to bring something together representative of the 1960s zeitgeist in Cambridge. This was then handed over and brought to fruition by Ken Woollard, a local firefighter and socialist political activist, to help organise it.

The first festival sold 1400 tickets and almost broke even. Squeezed in as a late addition to the bill was a young Paul Simon who had just released &quot;I Am A Rock&quot;. The festival&#x27;s popularity quickly grew. Woollard continued as Festival organiser and artistic director up until his death in 1993. In 2014 the festival celebrated its 50th event, including artists such as Van Morrison and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor. Until 2015 it was run by Cambridge City Council. It was briefly run by a charity called Cambridge Live. In 2019 it was once again taken over by Cambridge City Council.

The 2024 festival lost money, and in January 2025 it was announced that the 2025 festival, which would have been the 60th anniversary, was cancelled; Cambridge City Council said the funds would be used to &quot;explore new opportunities&quot; for the 2026 festival.

== Current structure ==
Most artists perform more than once over the weekend on the different stages: Stage 1, within a large marquee in front of the main Festival arena; Stage 2, a smaller marquee; a Floor Singers stage at the Coldham&#x27;s Common camp site; and the Club Tent, hosted up to 2022 on the Festival&#x27;s behalf by five local folk clubs, who programmed local artists. From 2023, this longstanding practice was discontinued, and the Festival rebranded the Club Tent as a third stage. There is a small tent called The Hub where young people can practise together or attend workshop sessions. In addition, there is a small marquee in the Flower Garden, which hosts workshops which vary from year to year. Regular fixtures have been the storytelling workshop and, since 2011, the Northumbrian smallpipes workshops run by the band Camus, where festival-goers can try their hand on practice sets of pipes. Elsewhere around the site, local musicians are invited by the festival to provide informal sessions, a regular favourite being the Irish sessions.

== Artists ==
Major figures from the folk world have appeared at the festival, including Martin Carthy, Shirley Collins, Peggy Seeger and John Tams. Recent festivals have also seen other important traditional musicians such as Kathryn Tickell, Kate Rusby, Eliza Carthy, and The Unthanks. Across a wider range of genres have been performances from Judy Collins, Graham Nash, Chumbawamba, Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros and Levellers. 2006&#x27;s line up included Emmylou Harris, Cara Dillon and Seth Lakeman. Artists such as Frank Turner, Mumford &amp; Sons, Laura Marling, Old Crow Medicine Show, Idlewild, Jake Bugg and The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican have also all played at Cambridge in recent years. In celebration of the 50th festival Delphonic Music released a digital audio album featuring tracks from 50 different artists, including Joan Baez, The Proclaimers, Fairport Convention and Loudon Wainwright III.

In 2015, Joan Baez, Joan Armatrading, Wilko Johnson, and Passenger headlined the festival.

Rhiannon Giddens was selected as the second guest curator of the 2018 Cambridge Folk Festival. In 2018, it was announced that Cambridge-born singer Nick Mulvey would be a guest curator for the 2019 festival, selecting five artists for the line-up.

== Releases ==
In 2007 a double album was released &quot;Cool As Folk: Cambridge Folk Festival&quot;, with live recordings by Altan, Kate Rusby, Beth Orton, Martin Simpson, Eliza Carthy, Joan Baez and many others.

In 2011, specialist music book publisher Rufus Stone released a limited edition book by rock art photographer Nick Elliott entitled &quot;TEN – A Decade in Images&quot;. The book features images taken at the festival by Elliott between 2000–2010 and was endorsed by the organisers. It includes quotes from some of the musicians featured in its pages such as Richard Hawley, Julie Fowlis, Sharon Shannon, and Cara Dillon as well as BBC radio presenters Mark Radcliffe and Mike Harding. Elliott released a follow-up book, &quot;50Folk&quot;, in 2014 as a personal celebration of 50 years of the festival.

<text>Captain Paul Delano (June 15, 1775 – February 4, 1842) was an American-born sea captain and a member of the prominent American Delano family.

==Early life==
Delano was born in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, on June 15, 1775, to Nathan Pope Delano and Sarah (née Tripp) Delano.

A descendant of Philip Delano, Paul&#x27;s paternal grandparents Jethro Delano and Elizabeth (née Pope) Delano. His grandfather Jethro&#x27;s younger brother, Thomas Delano, was himself the grandfather of Warren Delano Sr. (the father of Franklin Hughes Delano and Warren Delano Jr., as well as a grandfather of Warren Delano IV, Frederic Adrian Delano, and Sara Delano Roosevelt, the mother of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt).

==Career==
He moved to Chile as Captain of the &quot;Curiacio&quot; where he arrived on June 22, 1819, and became an important part of that country&#x27;s First Chilean Navy Squadron. He came with his two sons, Paul H., and William.

Paul Delano was commissioned as a captain and commanded sixteen troop means of transport of the Freedom Expedition of Perú and later he commanded the &quot;Lautaro&quot;.

In 1822, he became Captain of the port of Valparaíso where he directed the building of the first wharf and the first lighthouse of the port in 1837.

==Personal life==
Delano was married to Ann Ferguson Hinckley. Together, they were the parents of:

* Paul Hinckley Delano (1806–1881), who became Lord Admiral Thomas Cochrane&#x27;s personal aide and, at fourteen years of age, was given command of one of the boarding parties during the capture of the &quot;Esmeralda&quot; (1791) in the port of Callao on 5 November 1820.

Delano died on February 4, 1842, in Talcahuano, Chile.

<text>Compton Petroleum Corporation is a Canadian petroleum company based in Calgary, Alberta. It is a public company actively engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.

The company has faced opposition from some residents of Calgary over plans to drill four sour gas wells very near to the southeast quadrant of the city. The Energy and Utilities Board of Alberta has ruled that in the case of a sour gas leak, a circular evacuation zone with a radius of 5 kilometres extending away from the wells would be used. This area encompasses part of the city of Calgary, as well as many kilometres of the Bow River.

<doc id="876070" wikidata="Q91499" url="?curid=876070" title="Appleseed (manga)">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masamune Shirow. The series follows the adventures of ESWAT members Deunan Knute and Briareos Hecatonchires in Olympus. Like much of Shirow&#x27;s work, &quot;Appleseed&quot; merges elements of the cyberpunk and mecha genres with politics, philosophy, and sociology. The series spans four volumes, released between 1985 and 1989. It has been adapted into an original video animation, three feature films, a 13-episode TV series, and two video games.

In 1986, &quot;Appleseed&quot; received the 17th Seiun Award for Best Manga.

==Plot==
&quot;Appleseed&quot; takes place in the 22nd century, after the non-nuclear Third World War has led to the destruction of a majority of the Earth&#x27;s people. While countries like Great Britain, USA and China have difficulty maintaining order and power, international organizations like the &quot;Sacred Republic of Munma&quot; and &quot;Poseidon&quot; have been established in the aftermath.

The main characters are Deunan Knute and Briareos Hecatonchires, former SWAT members of the LAPD. They are found in the desolated city and invited to join the prestigious ESWAT (Extra Special Weapons And Tactics) organization in the utopian city of Olympus, the new world&#x27;s most powerful state. Roughly one half of Olympus&#x27;s population are bionically augmented.

The series follows Deunan and Briareos as they protect their new home from both foreign and domestic threats to its security.

==Manga==
Originally published in Japan in 1985, Book One &quot;Appleseed: The Promethean Challenge&quot; was published directly to paperback instead of being serialized, a rarity in the Japanese manga market. This was soon followed by the publication of Book Two, &quot;Appleseed: Prometheus Unbound&quot;, Book Three &quot;Appleseed: The Scales of Prometheus&quot; in 1987, and Book Four &quot;Appleseed: The Promethean Balance&quot; in 1989. The fifth volume was serialized in Seishinsha&#x27;s &quot;Comic Gaia&quot; in 1991, but was suspended because, in Masamune Shirow&#x27;s words, &quot;this form of serialization still did not suit &quot;Appleseed&quot;&quot;. Rumors of a possible Book Five still persist today, though Shirow had mentioned that he has no plans of pursuing it for the meantime. From 1988 to 1992, &quot;Appleseed&quot; was published in English by Eclipse Comics in comic book and volume format, packaged by Studio Proteus. The manga is currently published by Dark Horse Comics. In 2004, a special edition compiling the first two volumes was released, under the title &quot;Appleseed 01&amp;02&quot;.


==Adaptations==
* &quot;Appleseed&quot; (1988), animated film directed by Kazuyoshi Katayama
* &quot;Appleseed&quot; (2004), animated film directed by Shinji Aramaki
* &quot;Appleseed Ex Machina&quot; (2007), animated film directed by Shinji Aramaki
* &quot;Appleseed XIII&quot; (2011), animated series directed by Takayuki Hamana and Katsutaka Nanba
* &quot;Appleseed Alpha&quot; (2014), animated film directed by Shinji Aramaki

===Tie-in books===
In November 1988, Bandai published &quot;Appleseed Reader: Shiro Masamune&#x27;s Vsual World&quot; containing live-action depictions of Deunan and Briareos and various background information about world of &quot;Appleseed&quot;.

Shirow produced the &quot;Appleseed Databook&quot;, a detailed look into the history, the people, and the technology found in the world of &quot;Appleseed&quot;, published by Seishinsha in May 1990. The book includes the short story titled &quot;Called Game&quot;. It was released in English by Dark Horse Comics in September 1995. Seishinsha re-released &quot;Appleseed Databook&quot; with additional art as &quot;Appleseed ID&quot; (&quot;Illustration &amp; Data&quot;) in July 2001 and Dark Horse published it in English in December 2007.

&quot;Appleseed Hypernotes&quot; was serialized in &quot;Comic Gaia&quot;, followed by a collected volume in 1996. The &quot;Hypernotes&quot; consist of a four chapter story followed by technical information about the world, mechs, and equipment much like &quot;Appleseed Databook&quot;. An English language version of &quot;Appleseed Hypernotes&quot; was serialized in Dark Horse Comics&#x27; &quot;Super Manga Blast&quot;. One of the terms for &quot;Hypernotes&quot; publication stated that &quot;Appleseed Hypernotes&quot; could not be released in English in collected format. The reason for this is because Shirow was unsatisfied with the work and wanted to fix it before releasing it as a complete book for English readers. Dark Horse eventually released an English trade paperback of &quot;Hypernotes&quot; in October 2007.

===Anime===
In 1988, the manga was adapted into an original animated video of the same name by Kazuyoshi Katayama. It was produced by Bandai Visual and licensed by Books Nippan (U.S. Rendentions in 1991, then in 1995 by Manga Entertainment).

A CGI feature film was released in 2004 titled &quot;Appleseed&quot; and directed by Shinji Aramaki. The sequel to this film, &quot;Appleseed Ex Machina&quot;, was released on October 20, 2007, in Japan and on March 11, 2008 in the United States as a direct-to-video film with Aramaki again directing and John Woo producing. In 2014, a reboot titled &quot;Appleseed Alpha&quot; was announced for a July 22, 2014, release on Blu-ray and DVD after a digital release on July 15, 2014.

A cancelled anime television series known as was originally announced in 2005. The series was slated to be 26-episodes and scheduled to release in summer 2006. The TV series was officially unveiled at 2008 Tokyo International Anime Fair and was being produced by Radix Mobanimation anime studio. The TV series was being directed by Romanov Higa with Haruhiko Mikimoto as character design and Romi Park as voice actress for Deunan Knute. On September 26, 2008, the Robix Mobanimation studio filed a lawsuit against Micott &amp; Basara production company for halting the production without reason and not paying for the production costs. On July 14, 2009, Miccot &amp; Basara countersued Robix Mobanimation studio claiming that there was no unpaid production costs and that Radix unilaterally ended their discussion about the production. On April 18, 2012, the two reached a settlement agreement.

In 2011, a CGI-animated series &quot;Appleseed XIII&quot; premiered, directed by Takayuki Hamana. It was released in Japan as a 13-episode ONA series and were compiled into two theatrical feature films. The first feature film titled, &quot;Appleseed XIII: Tartaros&quot; was released on June 13, 2011. The second titled, &quot;Appleseed XIII: Ouranos&quot; was released on October 24, 2011. During the release of the feature films, limited edition first Blu-ray volumes were being sold in theatres and the episodes were being streamed online.

An action video game titled for the Super Famicom was released on August 26, 1994, and was published by Visit. A PlayStation 2 game titled &quot;Appleseed EX&quot; was developed by Sega and based on the 2004 film adaptation. The game was released in February 2007, as well as the Limited Box set. An online game known as &quot;Appleseed the Online&quot; was released on October 20, 2005; however servers closed on November 13, 2006. A second online game known as &quot;Appleseed Tactics&quot; was released on October 29, 2009. Servers closed on July 15, 2010.

==Reception==
&quot;Appleseed&quot; won the 17th Seiun Award for Best Manga in 1986.

Reviews of the manga series have been seen as positive. Manga Review noted that Shirow&#x27;s works on &quot;Appleseed&quot; are both cool and functional. Anime.com points out that the manga&#x27;s storyline does not detract despite the combination of both action and humor. Helen McCarthy in &quot;500 Essential Anime Movies&quot; stated that the manga &quot;is packed with political, ecological, technical, and literary references and subtexts, but it&#x27;s also an enjoyable science fiction adventure&quot;.

==Legacy==
Director Neill Blomkamp has cited &quot;Appleseed&quot;″s Briareos as an influence on the design of the eponymous character in his 2015 film, &quot;Chappie&quot;.

The French FÉLIN (Fantassin à Équipement et Liaisons Intégrés – Integrated Infantryman Equipment and Communications, an infantry combat system) has a firing capability directly inspired by &quot;Appleseed&quot;.

<text>John Kahn (June 13, 1947 – May 30, 1996) was an American bassist. From 1970 to 1995, Kahn was Jerry Garcia&#x27;s principal musical collaborator outside of the Grateful Dead.

==Biography==

John Kahn was born in Memphis, Tennessee. Adopted at birth by Hollywood talent agents, he grew up in Beverly Hills, California, and was babysat by Marilyn Monroe, who was represented by his father in the early stages of her career. According to spouse Linda Kahn in a 2017 Reddit Ask Me Anything prompt, he began to take piano and music theory classes at 4 and 5, respectively. Following the death of his father at a young age, he was mentored by Mischa Elman, a cousin of his father.

At Beverly Hills High School, he earned a reputation as a talented jazz guitarist. He also composed a symphonic piece, &quot;Western Impressions,&quot; the first orchestral work by a student to be publicly performed by the school&#x27;s orchestra (under the direction of Robert Holmes). In his junior year, Kahn switched to double bass and formed a jazz duo with a pianist, Peter Isackson, who encouraged him to study with Monty Budwig, a member of the house rhythm section at notable Hollywood jazz club Shelly&#x27;s Manne-hole.

After attending the University of Southern California for a semester, he transferred to the San Francisco Conservatory of Music in 1965. During this period, he lived in nearby Sausalito, California, and began to gravitate toward the incipient rock culture of the Haight-Ashbury district. In 1967, he began working as a session musician, specializing in electric bass, with a litany of notable blues, folk, and rock performers, including Mike Bloomfield, Nick Gravenites, Mississippi Fred McDowell, John Lee Hooker, Brewer &amp; Shipley (a longstanding collaboration that encompassed their 1971 Top Ten hit &quot;One Toke Over the Line&quot;), Tom Fogerty, Maria Muldaur (who was in a relationship with Kahn for several years in the 1970s), Al Kooper, Jackie DeShannon and Otis Rush.

Kahn first played with Garcia in May 1970 as the bassist of a jazz rock group that coalesced around Garcia and organist Howard Wales (who facilitated their introduction) during Monday night jam sessions at The Matrix, a San Francisco nightclub of the era; this ensemble would go on to record &quot;Hooteroll?&quot; (1971; credited to Garcia and Wales). He also played acoustic bass in Old &amp; In the Way, a bluegrass supergroup that toured in 1973 and 1974. Along with Kahn, the band featured Garcia on banjo and vocals, future progressive bluegrass luminary David Grisman on mandolin and vocals, songwriter Peter Rowan on guitar and vocals, and Vassar Clements on fiddle.

From 1970 to 1975, Kahn played in the Merl Saunders and Jerry Garcia Band and was an integral part of later iterations of the Garcia/Saunders collaboration, including Legion of Mary (1974–1975) and Reconstruction (1978–1979); the latter group was initially intended to serve as a musical outlet for Kahn during Garcia&#x27;s tours with the Grateful Dead. Kahn was the only founding member of the Jerry Garcia Band (1975–1978; 1980–1995) besides Garcia to remain with the group until its dissolution following the guitarist&#x27;s death in 1995. He played a few gigs with the band after Jerry&#x27;s death, in Santa Cruz and at the Warfield, where he wept on stage along with many in the hall. In addition to serving as the band&#x27;s nominal manager (these responsibilities were delegated to Grateful Dead employees Rock Scully and Steve Parish), he selected the group&#x27;s repertoire in consultation with Garcia. During this period, he also played alongside Garcia in an acoustic duo, Garcia &amp; Kahn (1982-86, 65 gigs), and the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band (1987–1988).

Offstage, Kahn and Garcia maintained a close friendship. Although several figures in Garcia&#x27;s life (including brother Tiff Garcia and Grateful Dead keyboardist Vince Welnick) characterized him as a deleterious influence, daughter Annabelle Garcia was more equanimous: &quot;Yeah, Dad did drugs with John and Linda, but that was just the way it was. They offered my dad a safe haven—a place he could come to get some drugs if he wanted it, and a place to sleep if he needed it, and the company that he needed. [...] John and Linda were very sweet people and I know at least they made my dad feel comfortable.&quot;

Despite underlying acrimony stemming from his relationship with Garcia, Kahn did occasional work for the Grateful Dead, serving as a recording engineer alongside Betty Cantor-Jackson and Bob Matthews for the band&#x27;s aborted &quot;Egypt &#x27;78&quot; live album documenting performances at the Giza Plateau in September 1978. Selections from these concerts were eventually released as &quot;Rocking the Cradle: Egypt 1978&quot; (2008). He also contributed horn arrangements and uncredited organ and additional production to &quot;Shakedown Street&quot; (1978) following the departure of nominal producer Lowell George.

Kahn died of a heart attack in his sleep on May 30, 1996, in Mill Valley, California.

<text>Steeple is a village on the Dengie Peninsula in Essex, England. It is situated just east of Maylandsea and Mayland, on the southern side of the River Blackwater estuary.

A hamlet, within the village of Steeple, on the banks of the River Blackwater is called Stansgate.

==Steeple Church==
The original parish church of St Lawrence, located west of the present building, was destroyed by fire. The current church was built in the centre of the village re-using some materials from the old church.

On the west side of the village, there is a former chapel building of the Peculiar People, built in 1877.

==Stansgate Priory==
Stansgate Priory was a Cluniac Priory built near to the banks of the River Blackwater in about 1120. It was one of many priories closed by Thomas Cromwell in 1534.

==Viscounts Stansgate==
The village has been home to several generations of the Benn family, who were created Viscounts Stansgate in 1942, since about 1900. They live in Stansgate House.

<text>Canico Resource Corp. is a Vancouver, British Columbia-based junior resource company focused on the development of the Onça-Puma nickel laterite project located in Para State, Brazil. This is a large, high-grade, open-pittable deposit which is one of the world&#x27;s best undeveloped nickel projects.

According to the feasibility studies, the plant will have a nominal capacity to produce 57,000 tons of nickel annually, and its development will demand investments of US$1.1 billion. Production startup of the first module was scheduled for 2008.

The company was founded in 2004 and was headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Canico Resource was known for its operations at the Serra dos Carajas mine in Brazil, which was one of the largest iron ore mines in the world. The company was also involved in the exploration and development of other mineral resources in Brazil and other countries in South America.

Canico Resource was acquired by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) in December 2005. CVRD, a Brazilian company, headquartered in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is the largest metals and mining company in the Americas and one of the largest in the global metals and mining industry.

<text>Float is the second studio album by American hip hop artist Aesop Rock. It was released on Mush Records on September 5, 2000. Produced by Aesop Rock himself, Blockhead, and Omega One, it features guest appearances from Slug, Vast Aire, and Doseone.

==Critical reception==

Brad Mills of AllMusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5, calling it &quot;surprising, analytical, darkness, mystery, lyricism, and jealous.&quot; Jon Caramanica of &quot;Spin&quot; gave the album a 7 out of 10, commenting that &quot;Aesop&#x27;s voice is a rich, flat bass cut with a thin growl; through its resonance, he&#x27;s able to explore the variations within a timbre to access a vast emotional range.&quot; Thomas Quinlan of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; gave the album a mixed review, writing: &quot;While there are no bad songs, the consistent similarity between all of the tracks in regards to drum samples and vocal sounds causes the album to have a bit of a tiresome feel as it nears its conclusion.&quot; He added: &quot;The guest MCs add different vocal styles to the album, which helps take your mind off Aesop&#x27;s vocals long enough to appreciate them when they come back.&quot;

In 2014, Joseph Schafer of &quot;Stereogum&quot; named it the 3rd best Aesop Rock record, saying: &quot;The whole record sounds more anxious than his more assured later work, which makes for an exciting listen.&quot;

<doc id="876091" wikidata="Q5489492" url="?curid=876091" title="Frank Selee">
<text>Frank Gibson Selee (October 26, 1859 – July 5, 1909) was an American Major League Baseball manager in the National League (NL). In his 16-year Major League career, he managed the Boston Beaneaters (1890–1901) and Chicago Orphans / Cubs (1902–1905), winning 1,284 games. Selee managed the Beaneaters during their 1890s run of five NL championships. His 1892 and 1898 teams each won 100 games, becoming the first teams to ever achieve the mark in baseball history (only one other team achieved the feat in the 19th century); their 102 wins in each season would not be surpassed by a National League team until 1902. After joining the Orphans, he helped build the team that would become the Cubs dynasty of the 1900s. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Early life==
Selee was born in Amherst, New Hampshire. He was described as a &quot;balding little man with a modest demeanor and a formidable mustache that gave his face a melancholy cast&quot;, and was shy and reticent in public. Selee left a job at a watch manufacturer in Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1884 to form a minor league team in the Massachusetts State League. In 1885 and 1886, he managed the Haverhill team in the New England League. The following year Selee managed the Oshkosh, Wisconsin based Oshkosh Indians franchise in the Northwest League, winning the league championship. In 1888 he was hired to manage at the Omaha Omahogs in the Western Association. In 1889 he led Omaha to the pennant while posting the highest team winning percentage in all of organized baseball, after signing a teenage Kid Nichols to the Omaha roster. Selee&#x27;s managerial success in the minor leagues propelled him to the major leagues in 1890.

==Major league managerial career==
===Boston Beaneaters===
Selee was a rare 19th century major league manager who did not double as a player or rise from the ranks of former players. His only experiences playing professional baseball were brief roster appearances with minor league teams in Waltham and Lawrence, Massachusetts, in 1884. Thereafter his only professional role was as manager.
In Selee&#x27;s first season, he signed Kid Nichols to a major league contract and the Beaneaters finished with a 76–57–1 record, 12 games behind the Brooklyn Bridegrooms. In the following year, the schedule increased to 140 games. His team finished 87–51–2, while winning the National League pennant by games over the Chicago Colts, their first pennant since 1883. In 1892, the schedule increased to 150 games, while having a split season. The Beaneaters went 102–48–2 overall while winning the first half of the season, with the Cleveland Spiders winning the second half; the two teams played a &quot;World&#x27;s Championship Series&quot; at the end of the season, with Boston winning five of the seven games played. They were the first team to ever win 100 games in a single season. In 1893, the Beaneaters went 86–43–2 while winning the league pennant for the third consecutive year, winning by five games over the Pittsburgh Pirates. 

The 1894 season was a disappointment. Though the team had a winning record (83-49), they finished in third place, eight games behind the Baltimore Orioles. The following year, the team went 71–60–2 while finishing in a tie for fifth place with the Brooklyn Grooms and games behind the Orioles. The team rebounded a bit the following year, finishing 74-57-1 and in fourth place, although it was 17 games back of the Orioles. The 1897 season was a return to prominence as they went 93–39–3 while winning the National League pennant by two games over the Orioles. This was their fourth league pennant. After the season, the two teams played in the Temple Cup, with Boston losing in five games. The 1898 team went 102–47–3 while winning the league pennant once again, doing so by six games over the Orioles. This was the fifth and final pennant for Selee and the Beaneaters. As it turned out, it was the peak of his tenure with the team.

The following year the team went 95–57–1, placing second behind Brooklyn. The team finished the 1900 season in fourth place with a record of 66–72–4, the first sub-.500 season under Selee&#x27;s reign and the first for the team since 1886. He closed out his tenure with the Beaneaters in 1901 with a 69–69–2 record and a fifth place finish ( games behind the Pirates). On September 20, he won his 1,000th career game, doing so in the second game of a doubleheader with the Chicago Orphans, winning 7–0. During his years with Boston, he won 1,004 games and lost 649, with 24 ties.

===Chicago Orphans / Cubs===

In 1902, Selee was hired to manage the Chicago Orphans (which served as a name after the team fired famed manager Cap Anson, although they were also known as &quot;Remnants&quot;). Selee managed them to a 68–69–6 record, finishing in fifth place (34 games behind the Pirates), which was an improvement from the team&#x27;s 53–86 record the previous year. The following year the team (in their first season referred to as &quot;Cubs&quot; in print) improved to an 82–56–1 record, finishing in 3rd place, eight games behind the pennant-winning Pirates. They improved to a 93–60–3 record in Selee&#x27;s third season, finishing in second place, 13 games behind the New York Giants. 

With the Cubs, Selee developed the famous Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance infield combination, by converting Frank Chance from catcher to first base, Joe Tinker from third base to shortstop, and Johnny Evers from shortstop to second base. Selee also traded two players to the St. Louis Cardinals to acquire a rookie pitcher named Mordecai &quot;Three Finger&quot; Brown; Brown became a major factor in the Cubs&#x27; post-Selee success and went on to a Hall of Fame career.

The 1905 season was Selee&#x27;s last in the majors, as he resigned in June due to illness; at the time, the Cubs had a record of 37–28, and Chance would lead them to a 92–61 record. It was the third straight season they had finished in the top three in the National League, which was the first time they had three consecutive seasons of first division finishes since the 1885–1891 seasons. Chance would lead the Cubs to four National League titles and two World Series victories during his tenure. The last Cubs&#x27; championship under Chance was in 1910; eight of the top thirteen players from the 1905 squad were major contributors on that 1910 club.

==Later life and legacy== 
Selee managed the Pueblo Indians of the minor league Western League from 1906 to 1908. The team had a losing record each year and never finished higher than fifth place. In 1909, Selee died of consumption (tuberculosis) at the age of 49 in Denver, Colorado, and was interred at Wyoming Cemetery in Melrose, Massachusetts.

In total, Selee had 1,284 victories in 2,180 games as a manager during his 16-year MLB career, with a winning percentage of .598. Twelve of his players went on to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Selee was noted for his ability to assess and hire talented players, which helped earn him five NL titles with the Beaneaters. He repeated the feat in Chicago, where he built the basis for the Cubs&#x27; later success by signing and developing the talents of Frank Chance, Joe Tinker, and Johnny Evers, among others. Baseball historian David Nemec wrote that Selee had &quot;a flair for bending players acquired from here, there and everywhere. [He was] a master at putting together a team better than the sum of its parts.&quot;

In 1999, Selee was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee for his achievements as a manager. According to his bio at the Hall of Fame, &quot;Contrary to the rough tactics of rival clubs like the Baltimore Orioles, Selee encouraged his players to play a more civilized style. His teams surpassed brawnier opponents by hitting behind runners, employing the bunt and utilizing the double steal.&quot; Selee is one of only two people from New Hampshire to be inducted into the Hall of Fame; the other is Carlton Fisk, who was enshrined in 2000.

Selee appeared as a character in the 1991 episode &quot;Batter Up&quot; of the animated &quot;Back to the Future&quot; series, which involved Marty McFly and the Brown children traveling back to 1897 to help one of Marty&#x27;s ancestors, a player for the Beaneaters, to improve his game. Selee was portrayed without his well-known mustache.

<text>SMSQ/E is a computer operating system originally developed in France by Tony Tebby, the designer of the original QDOS operating system for the Sinclair QL personal computer. It began life as SMSQ, a QDOS-compatible version of SMS2 intended for the Miracle Systems QXL emulator card for PCs. This was later developed into an extended version, SMSQ/E, for the Atari ST. It consists of a QDOS compatible SMS kernel, a rewritten SuperBASIC interpreter called SBasic, a complete set of SuperBASIC procedures and functions and a set of extended device drivers originally written for the QL emulator for the Atari ST.

It also integrates many extensions previously only available separately for the QL, like Toolkit II (quite essential SuperBASIC add-on), the Pointer Environment (the QL&#x27;s mouse and windowing system) and the Hotkey System 2.

While SMSQ/E does not run on any unmodified QL, it runs on all of the more advanced QL compatible platforms, from the Miracle Systems (Super)GoldCard CPU plug-in cards to the Q60 motherboard.

== History ==

In late 1995 a German author, Marcel Kilgus, acquired the SMSQ/E sources for adaptation to his QL emulator QPC, which from then on did not emulate any specific QL hardware anymore but employed specially adapted device drivers to achieve a tighter integration and faster emulation.

In 2000, version 2.94 was the first QL operating system that broke free of the bounds of the QL 8 colour screen, introducing GD2 (Graphic Device Interface Version 2), a QL compatible 16-bit high colour graphics sub-system.

Up to version 2.99 the system was exclusively developed by Tony Tebby and Marcel Kilgus. In 2002, Tebby released all of his source code (which doesn&#x27;t include most QPC specific parts), albeit under a license which is not open source under the Open Source Definition.
With this step Tony Tebby finally left the QL scene, but development by volunteers continues to this day.

In early 2013 the current source code was re-released under the BSD license.

Currently SMSQ/E consists of approximately 2000 68k assembler source files containing about 222,000 lines of code.

<text>Golders Green is a London Underground station in Golders Green, north London. It is on the Edgware branch of the Northern line between Brent Cross and Hampstead stations, and is located in Travelcard Zone 3.

The station is located at the crossroads of Finchley Road (A598) and Golders Green Road/North End Road (A502). The station exit is adjacent to Golders Green bus station; a former exit to Finchley Road is now closed. Adjacent to the station is the Golders Green Hippodrome, home to the BBC Concert Orchestra for many years and now the headquarters of a religious organisation.

==History==

Golders Green station was opened by the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR, now part of the Northern line) on 22 June 1907. It was one of the railway&#x27;s two northern terminals (the other being at Archway) and was also the site of the railway&#x27;s depot. At the beginning of the 20th century Golders Green was a small rural hamlet with only a few houses, but the opening of the railway stimulated a rapid building boom causing the number of houses and the population to increase greatly.

To the south of the station in the tunnels beneath Hampstead Heath is the partially built but uncompleted &quot;North End&quot; or &quot;Bull &amp; Bush&quot; station.

Before the First World War plans were made to extend the CCE&amp;HR north from Golders Green to Hendon and Edgware to open up new areas of the Middlesex countryside to development and to create a source of new passengers. The war postponed the construction of the extension and work did not begin until 12 June 1922. The first section of the extension, as far as Hendon Central, opened on 19 November 1923.

Golders Green was the last station on the Northern line to retain semaphore signals, replaced in 1950.

==Today==

The station has three tracks running through it which serve a side platform and two island platforms. The platforms are numbered 1 to 5 with numbers 1 and 2 serving each side of one track and 3 and 4 serving each side of another. Platform 1 (the northbound side platform) is not presently in public use, as it is used by London Underground staff. Platforms 3 and 4 are used for trains terminating at Golders Green, which may then reverse back into London, but this is uncommon, and trains that start at Golders Green Depot continue to Hampstead Station to make their first stop.

Two new lifts were installed during 2008, one on platform 2/3 and one on platform 4/5 to provide step-free access to the platforms. Ticket barriers are in operation.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 13, 83, 102, 139, 183, 210, 226, 240, 245, 260, 268, 328, 460, H2, H3, school route 631 and night routes N5 and N83 serve the station. Several National Express coaches also serve the station.

<doc id="876099" wikidata="Q201582" url="?curid=876099" title="Pindus">
<text>The Pindus (also Pindos or Pindhos; ; ; ) is a mountain range located in Northern Greece and Southern Albania. It is roughly 160 km (100 miles) long, with a maximum elevation of 2,637 metres (8651.5&#x27;) (Mount Smolikas). Because it runs along the border of Thessaly and Epirus, the Pindus range is known colloquially as the &quot;spine of Greece&quot;. The mountain range stretches from near the Greek-Albanian border in southern Albania, entering the Epirus and Macedonia regions in northern Greece down to the north of the Peloponnese. Geologically, it is an extension of the Dinaric Alps, which dominate the western region of the Balkan Peninsula.

== History of the name ==
Historically, the name Pindos refers to the mountainous territory that separates the greater Epirus region from the regions of Macedonia and Thessaly.

According to John Tzetzes (a 12th-century Byzantine writer), the Pindos range was then called Metzovon.

When translated (between 1682/83 and 1689) to a more conversational (colloquial) language the initial praise to St. Vissarion, which was drafted in 1552 by , he wrote: “A mountain called by the Greeks Pindos is the same mountain which is called Metzovon in Barbarian” and further down the same text he adds “this mountain, Metzovon, separates the Ioannina region from the Thessaloniki region.”

By the eighteenth century, there had been identification of the name Metsovo with the Pindos mountain range (in a French encyclopedia of 1756). BY 1825, the traveller John Cam Hobhouse was writing that &quot;…the latter mountains, now known by the name of Metzovo, can be no other than Pindus itself…&quot; while a patriarchal document of 1818 states: &quot;Because the high mountain of Pindos in Epirus, that is commonly called Messovon...&quot;. The word Pindos was used more in literary sources, while the folk name for the mountain range from the Middle Ages up to the 19th century was either &quot;Metsovo&quot; or &quot;the mountains of Metsovo&quot;. Most probably this name was not meant to indicate the whole range as it is meant today, but only its central part between the area of Aspropotamos and the springs of the Aoös River. This part coincides with the mountainous region which the ancient Greeks used to call Pindos.

== Major mountains ==
The most notable mountains in the range are Mount Grammos, Mount Smolikas, Mount Vasilitsa, Tymfi or Gamila, Lakmos or Peristeri, the Athamanika or Tzoumerka mountains, Vardousia, and the Agrafa mountains. Some mountains in Southern Greece are also considered part of the extended Pindus range. Its highest peak is on Mount Smolikas at an altitude of 2,637 meters.

== Population ==
The main groups of Pindus are Epirotes, Roumeliotes, and Vlachs. There are many villages in the Pindus, one of them being Samarina, which boasts one of the highest elevations in Greece. The area had a traditional pastoral economy in which sheep were raised by shepherds who were ethnically Sarakatsani and Aromanian. Many of the villages such as Perivoli and Smixi include communities of Aromanians (Vlachs), originally shepherds and farmers. In recent decades, a number of villages, such as Metsovo, have developed into tourist resorts with ski facilities.

== Transportation ==
The A2 motorway (Egnatia Odos) serves the region and connects it with the rest of Greece.

== Sightseeing ==
Besides the imposing mountainous terrain of the range, two significant gorges in Europe are located in the area: the Vikos Gorge and the Aoos Gorge. Together with the mountain valley of Valia Kalda they have been declared protected regions and constitute the National Park of Northern Pindos. Furthermore, many mountain settlements with long history and unique architecture are located throughout the range.

== Nature and wildlife ==
The Pindus region covers a wide range of elevations and habitats, from deep canyons to steep mountains. The wide range in altitude results in two major forest zones:
* A conifer zone, where trees such as a subspecies of Austrian Pine and the endemic Greek fir, characterise the highest elevations, with juniper woodlands dominating near the timberline.
* A mixed broadleaf forest zone dominates the valleys and canyons of the middle and lower elevations.

Large breeding colonies of herons, spoonbills, egrets, and pelicans fish the waters of the mountain lakes of the Pindus. This is one of the few areas in Europe where the rare Dalmatian pelican can be found. Wolves, jackals, and bears are found in the forests.

=== Ecology ===

The forests of this region have faced many threats over the course of human history, including overgrazing, agriculture, and deforestation. The greatest threats now come from the development of mountain tourism and ski resorts. Because of the instability of the soil on steep mountains, road-building and clear-cutting operations have led to dangerous landslides and the collapse of mountain slopes. Mining for bauxite, overgrazing, and over-collection of plants are also threatening the great biodiversity of this ecoregion.

== National Parks ==
In the Albanian section of the Pindus mountains is Albania&#x27;s newest national park.

=== Vjosa Wild River National Park===

The Vjosa River is Europe&#x27;s first Wild River National Park that was designated on 15 March 2023. The river valley is considered Albania&#x27;s biodiversity hotspot, offering ideal aquatic habitats for over 1,100 species of wildlife, including otters, the endangered Egyptian vulture and the critically endangered Balkan lynx, of which only 15 are estimated to remain.

In the Greek section of the Pindus mountains there are two national parks.

=== Vikos-Aoos National Park===

The Vikos-Aoos National Park is south of the town of Konitsa, in the west part of Zagori region. It includes Mount Tymfi, the Vikos Gorge and the Aoos Gorge. It was created in 1973.

===Pindus National Park===

The Pindus National Park (also known as Valia Kalda) is in a remote area in the northeast of the Pindus mountains, north of the town of Metsovo and south of Perivoli. The park of some 7,000 hectares was established in 1966. There are forests of black pine and beech, and in the higher parts, Bosnian Pine (&quot;Pinus leucodermis&quot;). The park is a refuge for bears, wild cats, and lynxes.
The National Park was selected as main motif for two high value euro collectors&#x27; coins: the €10 Greek Birds and Flowers and Black Pine Trees commemorative coins, minted in 2007. On the obverse of the latter there is a panoramic view of the common black pine trees that are prevalent in the park.

<text>The term parashah, parasha or parashat ( &quot;Pārāšâ&quot;, &quot;portion&quot;, Tiberian , Sephardi , plural: &quot;parashot&quot; or &quot;parashiyot&quot;, also called parsha) formally means a section of a biblical book in the Masoretic Text of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). In common usage today the word often refers to the weekly Torah portion (a shortened form of &quot;Parashat HaShavua&quot;). This article deals with the first, formal meaning of the word. In the Masoretic Text, &quot;parashah&quot; sections are designated by various types of spacing between them, as found in Torah scrolls, scrolls of the books of Nevi&#x27;im or Ketuvim (especially the Megillot), masoretic codices from the Middle Ages and printed editions of the masoretic text.

The division of the text into &quot;parashot&quot; for the biblical books is independent of chapter and verse numbers, which are not part of the masoretic tradition. &quot;Parashot&quot; are not numbered, but some have special names.

The division of &quot;parashot&quot; found in the modern-day Torah scrolls of all Jewish communities is based upon the systematic list provided by Maimonides in Mishneh Torah, &quot;Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and Torah Scrolls&quot;, chapter 8. Maimonides based his division of the &quot;parashot&quot; for the Torah on the Aleppo Codex. The division of &quot;parashot&quot; for the books of Nevi&#x27;im and Ketuvim was never completely standardized in printed Hebrew bibles and handwritten scrolls, though important attempts were made to document it and create fixed rules.

Incorrect division of the text into &quot;parashot&quot;, either by indicating a &quot;parashah&quot; in the wrong place or by using the wrong spacing technique, halakhically invalidates a Torah scroll according to Maimonides.

== Purpose ==

A &quot;parashah&quot; break creates a textual pause, roughly analogous to a modern paragraph break. Such a pause usually has one of the following purposes:
#In most cases, a new &quot;parashah&quot; begins where a new topic or a new thought is clearly indicated in the biblical text.
#In many places, however, the &quot;parashah&quot; divisions are used even in places where it is clear that no new topic begins, in order to highlight a special verse by creating a textual pause before it or after it (or both).
#A special example of #2 is for lists: The individual elements in many biblical lists are separated by &quot;parashah&quot; spacing of one type or another.

To decide exactly where a new topic or thought begins within a biblical text involves a degree of subjectivity on the part of the reader. This subjective element may help explain differences amongst the various masoretic codices in some details of the section divisions (though their degree of conformity is high). It may also explain why certain verses which might seem like introductions to a new topic lack a section division, or why such divisions sometimes appear in places where no new topic seems indicated. For this reason, the &quot;parashah&quot; divisions may at times contribute to biblical exegesis.

== History ==

&quot;Parashot&quot; appear in manuscripts as early as the Dead Sea Scrolls, in which the division is generally similar to that found in the masoretic text. The idea of spacing between portions, including the idea of &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; portions, is mentioned in early midrashic literature and the Talmud. Early masoretic lists detailing the Babylonian tradition include systematic and detailed discussion of exactly where portions begin and which type they are.

As a group, Tiberian Masoretic codices share similar but not identical &quot;parashah&quot; divisions throughout the Bible. Unlike the Babylonian &quot;mesorah&quot;, however, Tiberian masoretic notes never mention the &quot;parashah&quot; divisions or attempt to systematize them. This is related to the fact that the Babylonian lists are independent compositions, while the Tiberian notes are in the margins of the biblical text itself, which shows the &quot;parashot&quot; in a highly visible way.

In the centuries following the Tiberian Masoretic Text, there were ever-increasing efforts to document and standardize the details of the &quot;parashah&quot; divisions, especially for the Torah, and even for Nevi&#x27;im and Ketuvim as time went on.

== Spacing techniques ==
In most modern Torah scrolls and Jewish editions of the Bible, there are two types of &quot;parashot&quot;, an &quot;open portion&quot; (&quot;parashah petuhah&quot;) and a &quot;closed portion&quot; (&quot;parashah setumah&quot;). An &quot;open portion&quot; is roughly similar to a modern paragraph: The text of the previous portion ends before the end of the column (leaving a space at the end of the line), and the new &quot;open&quot; portion starts at the beginning of the next line (but with no indentation). A &quot;closed portion&quot;, on the other hand, leaves a space in the &quot;middle&quot; of the line of text, where the previous portion ends before the space, and the next portion starts after it, towards the end of the line of text.

In some manuscripts and in many printed editions, an &quot;open portion&quot; (&quot;petuhah&quot;) is abbreviated with the Hebrew letter &quot;פ&quot; (&quot;peh&quot;), and a &quot;closed portion&quot; (&quot;setumah&quot;) with the Hebrew letter &quot;ס&quot; (&quot;samekh&quot;), often in place of the visual gap in the line. Rough English equivalents are &quot;P&quot; and &quot;S&quot; respectively.

In masoretic codices and in medieval scrolls, these two spacing techniques allowed for a larger range of options:
* An &quot;open portion&quot; &quot;always started at the beginning of a new line&quot;. This could happen the way described above, but also by leaving a &quot;blank line&quot; between the two portions, thus allowing the previous portion to sometimes entirely fill its last line of text.
* A &quot;closed portion&quot; &quot;never began at the beginning of a line&quot;. This could happen as in modern scrolls (a space in the middle of a line), but also by the previous portion ending before the end of the line, and the new portion beginning on the next line after an indentation.

Open portions often seem to reflect the beginning of a new topic or a major subdivision within a biblical book, while closed portions seem to reflect smaller units or minor subdivisions.

Most printed Hebrew bibles today represent the &quot;parashot&quot; using the more limited techniques found in typical modern Torah scrolls: A space in the middle of a line for a closed portion, and beginning at the start of the next line for an open portion (not a blank line). A notable exception is &quot;The Jerusalem Crown&quot; (The Bible of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2000), whose typography and layout is fashioned after the Aleppo Codex, and follows the medieval spacing techniques for &quot;parashah&quot; divisions by leaving an empty line for {P} and starts {S} on a new line with an indentation.

Medieval Ashkenazic sources beginning with the Mahzor Vitry also refer to a third spacing technique called a &quot;parashah sedurah&quot;. This involved starting a new &quot;parashah&quot; at the same point in the line where the previous &quot;parashah&quot; ended on the line above.

== Halakhic significance ==

=== Validity of scrolls ===
According to the ruling of Maimonides, any error regarding a &quot;parashah&quot; completely invalidates a Torah scroll. This includes a &quot;parashah&quot; in the wrong place, of the wrong type, or a missing &quot;parashah&quot;.

However, there is also a responsum by Maimonides in which he ruled that one may recite a blessing over reading from an invalid scroll, based on the reasoning that the commandment is in the reading itself, not in the text being read from.

Maimonides&#x27; strict ruling that any error in the &quot;parashot&quot; completely invalidates a Torah scroll led to a major halakhic debate that continues to this day. Among those who ruled against Maimonides&#x27; stricture in practice were his son, Abraham Maimonides, Menachem Meiri, Moshe Chalava, Judah Minz, and Ovadia Yosef.

All of the above authorities rule that a scroll containing &quot;parashot&quot; based on alternative scribal traditions that disagree with Maimonides&#x27; list of &quot;parashot&quot; is nevertheless a valid scroll. However, even according to the lenient opinion, a blatant error with no source in any scribal tradition invalidates a Torah scroll.

=== Rules and customs for public reading ===

One basic halakhic rule for public reading of the Torah is that no fewer than three verses at a time be read. As a corollary to this, there is a specific rule regarding &quot;parashot&quot;: One may not leave off reading less than three verses before the end of a &quot;parashah&quot;, nor may one end off reading by starting a new &quot;parashah&quot; but leaving off less than three verses from its beginning.

When a Torah portion is read in public from a scroll as part of the synagogue service, it is divided into smaller sections among several people (for instance, 3 short sections on weekdays or 7 on the Sabbath). The points at which the portion is subdivided often take the &quot;parashot&quot; into account, but there is no hard and fast rule for this.

The selections from Nevi&#x27;im that are read as &quot;haftarot&quot; are based on custom. At times, some of these customs choose the exact beginning or end of a &quot;haftarah&quot; because it coincides with a &quot;parashah&quot; division.

== Torah ==
Due to the influence of Maimonides, &quot;parashah&quot; divisions in the Torah have become highly standardized, and there is close to exact agreement among Torah scrolls, printed Jewish bibles, and similar online texts. The following list thus presents the &quot;parashah&quot; divisions as found in (a) modern Torah scrolls, (b) Maimonides&#x27; Mishneh Torah, and (c) the Aleppo Codex (based on several witnesses besides Maimonides to the &quot;parashot&quot; in its missing parts). Rare inconsistencies between these three sources are explained in footnotes.

The list is constructed as follows:
* Only breaks two sections are listed: Any open or closed &quot;parashah&quot; break, {P} or {S}, must always appear two biblical sections. The symbols {P} and {S} always indicate the status of the &quot;following&quot; section. In Genesis, for instance, &quot;{S} 5:32–6:4 {P}&quot; indicates a &quot;closed&quot; section (&quot;setumah&quot;) because it with {S}. Therefore, no section break is indicated before the portion of a biblical book, or after its portion.
* The five books of the Torah have been broken down into their weekly Torah readings for convenience. The weekly Torah readings always begin at a &quot;parashah&quot; break, with the single exception of &quot;Vayechi&quot; (Genesis 47:28). The division into weekly readings is a prominent feature of the Tiberian masoretic codices along with the division into smaller &quot;parashot&quot;, and they are indicated with a special flourish in the margin parallel to the line in which each one begins.
* Special series of &quot;parashot&quot; used for special types of text (such as chronologies, lists, step-by-step sequences, repeating formulas) are indicated.
* When a &quot;parashah&quot; ignores a chapter break, this is indicated for convenience by spelling out the exact verses from each chapter found in that parashah; for instance: {P} 32:4–33; 33:1–17 {S}. This system allows for immediate calculation of the number verses in the &quot;parashah&quot;, and also facilitates easier comparison between the &quot;parashot&quot; and the chapter divisions.
* Variations found in alternative masoretic traditions (such as in the Leningrad Codex) are provided separately at the end of each book.
* Unusual data (such as an unusually lengthy &quot;parashah&quot;) is underlined to draw special attention, followed by a parenthetical note identifying the contents of the &quot;parashah&quot; at hand.
* The first words of a &quot;parashah&quot; are sometimes provided in Hebrew for clarity, especially for &quot;parashot&quot; that appear within a verse. A prominent example is for the Ten Commandments. The titles of prominent &quot;parashot&quot; mentioned in rabbinic literature are also sometimes given.
*The verse numbering in this list is according to the system commonly found in most Hebrew editions. The numbers in translations (and even in some Hebrew editions such as BHS) may differ slightly.

Symbols:
* {P} = &quot;parashah petuhah&quot; (&quot;open portion&quot;), typically resembles a new paragraph
* {S} = &quot;parashah setumah&quot; (&quot;closed portion&quot;), typically represented as a blank space in the middle of a line
* {-} = no &quot;parashah&quot; break indicated
* {SONG} = Special format for songs; details of the special layout will be described in separate sections.

Each such prophecy begins a new open &quot;parashah&quot; {P} in the Aleppo Codex, with the single exception of the sixth prophecy (14:1) that begins with a closed &quot;parashah&quot; {S}.

== Poetic layout of Psalms, Proverbs and Job ==
The three poetic books of Psalms, Proverbs and Job are collectively known as &quot;Sifrei Emet&quot; (see the article on Ketuvim). These three books share a unique system of cantillation unlike that of the other 21 books in Tanakh, a system designed to highlight the parallelisms in their verses.

In the Tiberian masoretic codices, the unique system of cantillation for &quot;Sifrei Emet&quot; is complemented by a scribal layout unlike that of the rest of the Bible: Instead of the three narrow columns per page typical of these codices, &quot;Sifrei Emet&quot; are written in two wide columns per page. In each line of these wide columns text begins on the right, followed by a gap, and then continued by further text until the left margin of the column. Although there is ample evidence that the scribes attempted to place the gaps in the middle of the lines at the points where the cantillation divides the verses, they often did not succeed in doing so because of space limitations. Modern editions based upon the Aleppo Codex have implemented the idea fully by allowing wide full-page columns for Psalms, Proverbs, and Job.

In poetic layout, &quot;parashah&quot; divisions are typically indicated by a blank line for an open &quot;parashah&quot;. The gaps in the middle of lines are not considered &quot;parashah&quot; divisions, and each scribe formatted the verses as he saw fit for aesthetic and practical reasons. An exception to this rule, however, is for the introductory titles of many individual psalms which are followed by formal &quot;parashah&quot; breaks, often by continuing the text at the beginning of the next line. These formal breaks will be indicated in the list of &quot;parashot&quot; for Psalms.

The special poetic cantillation and layout are &quot;not&quot; implemented for the narrative opening and conclusion of the book of Job (1:1-3:1 and 42:7-17).

== Ketuvim ==
Parashot in Ketuvim are listed here according to the Aleppo codex, with variants from other masoretic traditions noted at the end of each book&#x27;s section. The books of Ketuvim are presented in the order they appear in most printed Hebrew bibles. In Tiberian and early Sephardic masoretic codices (such as the Aleppo Codex) the order is as follows: Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, Ezra–Nehemiah.

The Aleppo codex is largely intact until the word ציון (&quot;Zion&quot;) in Song of Songs 3:11. It is missing the rest of Song of Songs, as well as the final books of &quot;Ketuvim&quot; in their entirety: Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel and Ezra–Nehemiah. It is also missing two folios which included about 10 psalms (15:1–25:1). &quot;Parashot&quot; listed here from its missing parts are according to the notes taken by Joshua Kimhi, who recorded the &quot;parashot&quot; of the Aleppo codex for Rabbi Shalom Shachna Yellin in the nineteenth century. These are indicated by an asterisk. For some of the books that are largely or completely missing, charts have been provided below to allow for easy comparison of the parallel data found in the masoretic manuscripts.

Key to symbols for variants:
* A = Aleppo Codex.
* A* = Aleppo Codex (&quot;parashot&quot; in the lost parts based on Kimhi&#x27;s notes).
* L = Leningrad Codex.
* Y = Cambridge University Library Add. Ms. 1753 (Yemenite). Yeivin regards this manuscript of &quot;Ketuvim&quot; as &quot;a second or third hand copy&quot; of a Tiberian manuscript &quot;no less accurate and reliable than the Aleppo Codex.&quot;
* S1 = Sassoon 1053 (10th century). Yeivin judges this manuscript to be carelessly prepared by comparison with other accurate Tiberian codices.
* L34 = EBP. II B 34 of the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg, a carefully prepared manuscript of &quot;Ketuvim&quot; but with many gaps.
* F = Finfer, Pesah. &quot;Masoret HaTorah VehaNevi&#x27;im.&quot;
** Ff = Finfer, &quot;few books&quot; (קצת ספרים). If a &quot;few books&quot; say one thing and a &quot;few books&quot; another, these are indicated by Ff1 &amp; Ff2.
** Fo = Finfer, &quot;other books&quot; (שאר ספרים).
** C=&quot;Cairo&quot;
** D=&quot;Damascus&quot;
** Finfer also sometimes notes a &quot;tiqqun&quot;.
** {-} Finfer notes that there is no &quot;parashah&quot; break at this verse.
** (-) Finfer doesn&#x27;t list this verse at all.

=== Psalms ===
The Aleppo Codex leaves two empty lines between the five Books of Psalms (following psalms 41, 72, 89, 106). Otherwise there is one blank line between each two psalms, the standard way of indicating an open &quot;parashah&quot; break {P} in poetic layout.

There is no break at all, however, between psalms 114–115, which were apparently considered a single psalm by the scribes. Psalm 119, which has sets of eight verses for each letter of the Hebrew alphabet, has an open &quot;parashah&quot; break (a blank line) between each set of eight verses.

The titles of individual Psalms have formal rules. Symbols for representing these rules are as follows, based on examples:
* 1 {-} = The psalm contains no format title, such as Psalm 1. The entire psalm is written in regular poetic layout.
* 3:1a {S/T} = There is a closed &quot;parashah&quot; within the title verse of a psalm. E.g. the title of psalm 3 is more than minimal, an entire verse containing more than one hemistich. There is a closed &quot;parashah&quot; division after the first hemistich. In masoretic manuscripts, this gap in the middle of the first title verse often closely resembles the poetic layout of the body of the psalm following the title verse.
* 4:1 {P} = The first full verse of a psalm is a title followed by an open &quot;parashah&quot; break, such as in Psalm 4. The text of the body of the psalm starts at the beginning of the next line.
* 11:1a {P} = The beginning of the first verse of a psalm is a title followed by an open &quot;parashah&quot; break in the middle of that verse, such as in Psalm 11. The text of the body of the psalm starts at the beginning of the next line. Besides formal titles, this form is also found after the word &quot;halleluyah&quot; at the beginning of a number of psalms (e.g. Psalm 106).
* 15:1a {S} = There is a closed &quot;parashah&quot; division following a title at the beginning of the first verse of the psalm, such as in Psalm 15. This is also found twice for a full-verse title in Psalms 70:1 {S} and 108:1 {S}.
* 26 {-/T} The beginning of the first verse of a psalm is a title, but there is no &quot;parashah&quot; division, such as in Psalm 26.

* Centered title: &quot;The Proverbs of Solomon&quot; 10:1a (10:1b–19:9). There are no &quot;parashah&quot; divisions following the centered title until 19:10, an unusually large amount of unbroken text (278 verses).

=== Job ===
I. Narrative Opening (1:1–3:1):
* Common layout and regular cantillation: 1:1–5 {P} 1:6–22 {P} 2:1–10 {P} 2:11–13; 3:1.

II. Poetic Disputations: The disputations, which constitute the bulk of the book of Job, employ the special poetic layout in common with Psalms and Proverbs, along its associated poetic cantillation. In Tiberian masoretic codices, the formal title of each individual speech appears in the center of its line, while the body of the reply appears in poetic form (as in Psalms and Proverbs). The break between the title and the body is considered an open &quot;parashah&quot;, and the verse numbers for these titles appear in bold in the list. Blank lines as open &quot;parashot&quot; are also used occasionally, and these are noted as {P}.
* Main Disputation (3:2–32:1):
** Centered titles: 3:2 (Job 3:3–26)
***First cycle: 4:1 (Eliphaz 4:2–21;5:1–27), 6:1 (Job 6:2–30; 7:1–21), 8:1 (Bildad 8:2–22), 9:1 (Job 9:2–35; 10:1–22), 11:1 (Zophar 11:2–20), 12:1 (Job 12:2–25; 13:1–28; 14:1–22)
*** Second cycle: 15:1 (Eliphaz 15:2–35), 16:1 (Job 16:2–22; 17:1–16), 18:1 (Bildad 18:2–21), 19:1 (Job 19:2–29), 20:1 (Zophar 20:2–29), 21:1 (Job 21:2–34), 22:1 (Eliphaz 22:2–30), 23:1 (Job 23:2–17; 24:1–25), 25:1 (Bildad 25:2–6), 26:1 (Job I 26:2–14), 27:1 (Job II 27:2–23; 28:1–28), 29:1 (Job III 29:2–25; 30:1–31; 31:1–40).
** Conclusion of the main disputation: {P} 32:1.
* Elihu (32:2–37:24):
** Introduction: {P} 32:2–5
** Speech: {P} 32:6–22; 33:1–33 (Elihu I). Centered titles: 34:1 (Elihu II 34:2–37), 35:1 (Elihu III 35:2–16), 36:1 (Elihu IV 36:2–33; 37:1–24).
* God and Job (38:1–42:6):
** God: {P} 38:1–41; 39:1–18 {P} 39:19–30.
** God and Job (centered titles): 40:1 (God 40:2), 40:3 (Job 40:4–5).
** God: {P} 40:6–32; 41:1–26 {P}.
** Job (centered title): 42:1 (Job 42:2–6).

III. Narrative Conclusion (42:7–17):
* Common layout and regular cantillation: {P} 42:7 {S} 42:8–17.

=== Song of Songs ===
The Aleppo codex is extant until the word ציון (&quot;Zion&quot;) in Song of Songs 3:11. Bibles that show &quot;parashot&quot; in the Song of Songs based upon the Aleppo Codex (with reconstruction of its missing parts based on Kimhi&#x27;s notes) include two editions following the Breuer method (&quot;Horev&quot; and &quot;The Jerusalem Crown&quot;). The flow of text in such bibles is as follows:
* 1:1–4 {P} 1:5–8 {P} 1:9–14 {S} 1:15–17; 2:1–7 {S} 2:8–13 {S} 2:14 {S} 2:15–17 {S} 3:1–5 {S} 3:6–8 {S} 3:9–11 {S*} 4:1–7 {S*} 4:8–16;5:1 {S*} 5:2–16; 6:1–3 {S*} 6:4–9 {S*} 6:10 {S*} 6:11–12; 7:1–11 {S*} 7:12–14;8:1–4 {S*} 8:5–7 {S*} 8:8–10 {P*} 8:11–14

The Tiberian masoretic codices are nearly identical in the parts at which they show &quot;parashah&quot; breaks in the text. However, while A and L have {S} almost exclusively, Y (which is usually very close to A) shows {P} for the large majority of &quot;parashot&quot;, as shown in the chart below:

=== Ruth ===
In the Tiberian masoretic codices, the only &quot;parashah&quot; found in Ruth is for the short chronology at the end of the book:
* {P} 4:18–22 ואלה תולדות פרץ

Variant:
* While A, Y, L, and Ff1 all have {P} at 4:18, other traditions noted by Finfer differ: F={-}, Ff2={S}.

=== Lamentations ===
The Aleppo codex lacks Lamentations in its entirety. &quot;Parashot&quot; listed here are based upon Kimhi&#x27;s notes on the codex.

* First lamentation (1:1–22): {S} between each of the 22 verses and {P} following the last one.
* Second lamentation (2:1–22): {S} between each of the 22 verses and {P} following the last one.
* Third lamentation (3:1–66): {S} between each of 66 verses and {P} following the last one.
* Fourth lamentation (4:1–22): {S} between each of the 22 verses and {P} following the last one.
* Fifth lamentation (5:1–22): 5:1–18 {P} 5:19–22

Variants:
* In the third lamentation, the Leningrad Codex has {S} between each set of three verses beginning with the same letter.

=== Ecclesiastes ===
The Aleppo codex lacks Ecclesiastes in its entirety. &quot;Parashot&quot; listed here are based upon Kimhi&#x27;s notes on the codex.

* 1:1–11 {P*} 1:12–18; 2:1–26; 3:1
* {S*} Song of the Seasons {SONG*} 3:2–8 {SONG*}
* {S*} 3:9

There are no further &quot;parashah&quot; divisions at all in the rest of the book (3:9-12:14) according to Kimhi&#x27;s notes on the Aleppo Codex, an unusually large amount of unbroken text (170 verses) that is confirmed by Y. The Leningrad codex has a solitary &quot;parashah&quot; break: {S} at 9:11. The following chart compares the meager &quot;parashah&quot; breaks for Ecclesiastes as found in manuscripts:

=== Esther ===
The book of Esther is traditionally read by Jews on the holiday of Purim from a handwritten scroll on parchment that must be halakhically valid. This means that the rules of open and closed &quot;parashot&quot; are of more practical relevance for Esther than for any other book in Nevi&#x27;im or Ketuvim. Despite this—or perhaps because of the large numbers of scrolls of Esther that have been written, and the special attention that has therefore been paid to the problem by rabbis and scribes—manuscripts of Esther and opinions about how they should be written betray a relatively large number of discrepancies regarding the &quot;parashah&quot; divisions.

In the nineteenth century, Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried published a manual for scribes called &quot;Keset HaSofer&quot;, in which he follows the rule that all &quot;parashot&quot; in Esther are closed {S} (&quot;Keset HaSofer&quot; 28:5). This is currently the dominant tradition for Ashkenazic and Sephardic &quot;megillot&quot; (scrolls of Esther) today. But the Tiberian masoretic codices contain both open and closed portions. Also, Yemenite scribes did not entirely adopt the tradition of closed portions, leaving the divisions in many scrolls of Esther similar to what is found in the masoretic codices.

Ganzfried ruled that a scroll of Esther with open portions is invalid, but added that &quot;some authorities validate it&quot; (&quot;Keset HaSofer&quot; 28:5). When discussing these authorities in his additional notes, Ganzfried cites a list open &quot;parashot&quot; found in the book &quot;Orhot Hayyim&quot;, and concludes: &quot;And even though our custom is that all of these are closed, it nevertheless seems that if some or all of these are open one may read from the scroll with a blessing.&quot; These have been listed in the chart below under at &quot;OH&quot; under &quot;Keset HaSofer&quot;, and they are very similar to what is found in the Tiberian masoretic codices.

Most printed Jewish bibles, even those based on manuscripts, show the flow of text in Esther according to the widespread tradition based on &quot;Keset HaSofer&quot; (only closed &quot;parashot&quot;). Such editions include the &quot;Koren&quot; edition (Jerusalem, 1962), Breuer&#x27;s first edition (Jerusalem, 1982) and Dotan&#x27;s editions (which are otherwise based upon the Leningrad Codex). The flow of text in such bibles is as follows:
* 1:1–8 {S} 1:9–12 {S} 1:13–15 {S} 1:16–22 {S} 2:1–4 {S} 2:5–20 {S} 2:21–23 {S} 3:1–7 {S} 3:8–15 {S} 4:1–17; 5:1–14 {S} 6:1–14;7:1–4 {S} 7:5–8 {S} 7:9–10 {S} 8:1–2 {S} 8:3–6 {S} 8:7–14 {S} 8:15–17; 9:1–6
* {S} Haman&#x27;s Sons: {SONG} 9:7–9 {SONG}
* {S} 9:10–28 {S} 9:29–32 {S} 10:1–3

Bibles that show the &quot;parashot&quot; in Esther based upon a reconstruction of the Aleppo Codex include two editions following the Breuer method (&quot;Horev&quot; and &quot;The Jerusalem Crown&quot;). The flow of text in such bibles is as follows:
* 1:1–9 {S*} 1:10–15 {P*} 1:16–22 {P*} 2:1–4 {P*} 2:5–10 {S*} 2:11–20 {S*} 2:21–23 {P*} 3:1–7 {S*} 3:8–15 {S*} 4:1–12 {P*} 4:13–17 {S*} 5:1–2 {S*} 5:3–14 {S*} 6:1–14;7:1–4 {S*} 7:5–8 {S*} 7:9–10 {P*} 8:1–2 {S*} 8:3–6 {S*} 8:7–14 {S*} 8:15–17;9:1–6
* {S*} Haman&#x27;s Sons: {SONG*} 9:7–9 {SONG*}
* {S*} 9:10–19 {S*} 9:20–28 {S*} 9:29–32 {S*} 10:1–3

=== Daniel ===
The Aleppo codex lacks Daniel in its entirety. &quot;Parashot&quot; listed here are based upon Kimhi&#x27;s notes on the codex.

* 1:1–21 {S} 2:1–13 {S} 2:14–16 {S} 2:17–24 {S} 2:25–28 {S} 2:29–30 {S} 2:31–45 {S} 2:46–49 {P} 3:1–18 {P} 3:19–23 {P} 3:24–30 {P} 3:31–33; 4:1–25 {P} 4:26–34 {P} 5:1–7 {S} 5:8–12 {P} 5:13–16 {P} 5:17–30 {P} 6:1–6 {S} 6:7–11 {S} 6:12–14 {P} 6:15 {S} 6:16–29

=== Ezra–Nehemiah ===
The Aleppo codex lacks Ezra–Nehemiah in its entirety. &quot;Parashot&quot; listed here are based upon Kimhi&#x27;s notes on the codex.

== Songs with special layout ==
In addition to the common &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; &quot;parashot&quot;, the masoretic scribal layout employs spaces in an elaborate way for prominent songs found within narrative books, as well as for certain lists. Each such &quot;song&quot; is formatted in its own exact way, though there are similarities between them. These sections include:

Torah
* Song of the Sea (Exodus 15:1–19)
* Song of Moses (Deuteronomy 32)
Nevi&#x27;im
* Canaanite Kings (Joshua 12:9–24)
* Song of Deborah (Judges 5)
* Song of David (II Samuel 22)
Ketuvim
* Song of the Seasons (Ecclesiastes 3:2–8)
* Haman&#x27;s Sons (Esther 9:7–9)
* David&#x27;s Champions (I Chronicles 11:26–47)
* Song of Assaf (I Chronicles 16:8–36)

The following sections discuss the layout and formatting of each of these songs in detail.

=== Haman&#x27;s Sons (Esther) ===
Esther 9:7–9 lists Haman&#x27;s ten sons in three consecutive verses (three names in 7, three in 8, and four in 9). Each name is preceded by the Hebrew particle ואת. The {SONG} format for this list is as follows:
* The last word of verse 9:6 (איש) is purposely planned to be the first word in a new line (at the right margin). This word will begin the first line of text in {SONG} format.
* The first word of 9:7 (the Hebrew particle ואת) is written at the end of the first line in at the left margin. A large gap is thus left between איש and ואת, which forms a closed &quot;parashah&quot; division {S}.
* In the next ten lines of text, the ten names of the sons of Haman appear one after another in the beginning of each line at the right margin, beneath the word איש, while the word ואת appears at the end of each line text (left margin) until the final line. The 11th and final line of text ends with the first word of 9:10 (עשרת).
* There are thus a total of eleven lines of text in {SONG} format, each with a single word at the beginning of the line and a single word at the end. The first (right) column begins with the word איש and the names of Haman&#x27;s 10 sons follow beneath it. The second (left) column has the word ואת ten times, and in the final row it has the first word of 9:10 (עשרת).

The {SONG} format described here originated in the typically narrow columns of the Tiberian masoretic codices, in which a line of text containing only two words at opposite margins with a gap between them appears similar to a standard closed &quot;parashah&quot;. However, in many later scrolls the columns are much wider, such that lines with single words at opposite margins create a huge gap in the middle. In many scrolls these eleven lines are written in very large letters so that they form one full column of text in the megillah.

<text>William Aloysius McGowan (January 18, 1896 – December 9, 1954) was an American umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the American League from 1925 to 1954. McGowan founded the second umpire school in the United States. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992, the first person born in Delaware so honored.

==Early life and career==
McGowan was born and grew up in Wilmington, Delaware. In 1913, he began umpiring in the Tri-State League at the age of 17. He moved on to the Virginia League in 1915, the International League and New York State League in 1916, and the Blue Ridge League in 1917. McGowan served in the United States Armed Forces during World War I in 1918, and then returned to the International League for 1919. Following the 1922 season, McGowan left the International League and joined the umpiring staff of the Southern Association, staying there until 1924.

==Major league baseball==
On April 14, 1925, McGowan umpired his first American League game, a Boston Red Sox-Philadelphia Athletics game at Shibe Park. He umpired third base in that game. He would umpire for 30 seasons, umpiring in eight World Series (1928, 1931, 1935, 1939, 1941, 1944, 1947, and 1950). He also worked four All-Star Games (1933, 1937, 1942, and 1950). He umpired in 2,541 consecutive games, missing a game on September 3, 1940, due to neuritis.

McGowan retired following the 1954 season. His final game was on July 27, between the Chicago White Sox and the New York Yankees at Comiskey Park.

==Off the field==
McGowan spent time writing baseball-related newspaper articles in the offseasons, working for the &quot;New Orleans Item&quot; in the 1920s. McGowan founded what is now known as the Wendelstedt Umpire School in 1938, which was run by Al Somers after his death until 1977, when it was taken over by the Wendelstedt family.

==Death and posthumous honors==
He died at age 58 at his home in Silver Spring, Maryland, after suffering two heart attacks in less than a week. He was buried in Cathedral Cemetery in Wilmington. In 1977 McGowan was inducted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame. He was also elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992 by the Veterans Committee.

Ted Williams called McGowan &quot;Number 1,&quot; considering him the best umpire of his playing days.

<doc id="876126" wikidata="Q1652445" url="?curid=876126" title="Peter of Moscow">
<text>Peter of Moscow (, Peter of Kiev, Peter of Rata, , ; c. 1260 – 20 December 1326) was the Russian metropolitan who moved his see from Vladimir to Moscow in 1325. Later he was proclaimed a patron saint of Moscow. In spite of the move, the office remained officially entitled &quot;Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27;&quot; until the autocephalous election of Jonah of Moscow in 1448.

==Life==
Peter was born in Volhynia (part of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia). His parents were Theodore and Eupraxia. At the age of twelve, young Peter entered a monastery where he learned iconography. The igumen of the monastery had Peter ordained as a hieromonk. After years of ascetic labors at the monastery, the hieromonk Peter, with the blessing of the igumen, left the monastery in search of a solitary place.

He built a cell at the Rata River and began to pursue asceticism in silence. Afterwards, at the place of his ascetic exploits, a monastery was formed, called the Novodvorsk. The Icon of the Most Holy Theotokos “Of St Peter” was so called because it was painted by Peter while he was igumen of the Ratsk monastery near Volhynia. During a visit to the Ratne monastery by Maximus, Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27;, Peter gave him the icon as a gift.

In 1308 king Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia nominated and the Patriarch of Constantinople appointed Peter to the vacant see of Kiev and all Rus&#x27;. Mikhail Yaroslavich, Grand Prince of Vladimir and Tver, wanted to advance his own candidate for this position. Peter&#x27;s nomination caused prolonged animosity between Mikhail and Peter to the point that the latter had to ask for protection from the Prince of Moscow in 1325.

Peter travelled to Constantinople where Patriarch Athanasius consecrated him as Metropolitan of Rus and bestowed on him the hierarchal vestments, staff and icon. Upon his return to Rus&#x27; in 1308, Metropolitan Peter arrived at Kiev after a year, and then proceeded on to Vladimir. During this time of Tatar (Mongol) authority Rus was in turmoil, and Peter was often obliged to change the place of his residence.

Peter transferred his metropolitan duties from depopulated Kiev to Vladimir. In 1325 Metropolitan Peter, at the request of the Grand Prince of Moscow, Ivan Kalita, transferred the metropolitan cathedra-chair from Vladimir to Moscow as part of Ivan&#x27;s relocation. The move strengthened the political position of Moscow and established it as the spiritual capital of fragmented Rus. After Peter&#x27;s move to Moscow, the Cathedral of the Dormition and several other stone churches were built by Ivan Kalita in the Moscow Kremlin. The foundation of the Vysokopetrovsky Monastery in Moscow is ascribed to Peter. He also authored a few sermons and epistles.

Peter died on 21 December 1326. After his canonization by Metropolitan Alexis, his veneration was propagated all over Moscovy. Accordingly, many churches were dedicated to Peter the Metropolitan in Moscow and other cities of Russia. His feast day is celebrated on 24 August (the translation of his relics to the Dormition Cathedral in Moscow) and 5 October (in common with Metropolitans Jonah and Alexis)

<doc id="876129" wikidata="Q245400" url="?curid=876129" title="Zygmunt Wojciechowski">
<text>Zygmunt Wojciechowski (27 April 1900 – 14 October 1955) was a Polish historian and nationalist politician. Born in 1900 in then-Austria, he obtained a doctorate from medieval history at Lviv University. In 1925 he moved to Poznań, where he became a full professor in 1929. In 1934-1939 he became politically involved with the nationalist party Endecja. During occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany he worked in Polish underground opposing German genocide of Poles by providing underground teaching, which was banned by German state and worked on future concept of Polish borders that would provide Poland with safety against any further German aggression. He supported an alliance with Soviet Union and after the war he continued to work as historian in People&#x27;s Republic of Poland and headed Western Institute that studied former Polish territories recovered from Germany and history of Polish-German relations. He was a recipient of Commander&#x27;s Cross and Officer&#x27;s Cross of Order of Polonia Restituta.

== Biography ==
Wojciechowski was born in Stryj near Lviv (Stryi, Ukraine), then Austro-Hungarian Galicia. In World War I he volunteered Piłsudski&#x27;s Legion but was not deployed anymore.

In 1921, Wojciechowski began studying at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów, which had then just been re-incorporated in the re-created Polish state (now Lviv in Ukraine). In 1924, he obtained a doctorate in medieval history, social sciences, and economics, and became assistant professor at the Institute for Auxiliary Sciences of History. In 1924 he published his first concept of the &quot;motherland territories&quot; of Poland. His definition of &quot;Polish motherland&quot; was the areas as acquired by 10th-century Piast Poland in the era of Mieszko I and Boleslaw Krzywousty (Greater Poland, Silesia, Pomerania, Neumark, West Prussia). In 1925, he moved to Poznań, where he first was the deputy holder of the chair for the history of the political system and Ancient Polish law at Adam Mickiewicz University (UAM). The same year, he completed his habilitation with a thesis on the territorial administration of medieval settlements. He became extraordinary (non-tenured) professor in 1929, and full professor in January 1937. From 1939, he was the dean of the university&#x27;s Department of Law and Economics.

===Political activity===

Since 1934, Wojciechowski, a friend of Roman Dmowski (leader of &quot;endecja&quot;), had been one of the main ideologists of the Camp of Great Poland (OWP). He was active in the right-wing All-Polish Youth and the Liga Narodowa. In 1934 he founded the &quot;League of Young Nationalists&quot; (Związek Młodych Narodowców), whose aim was the foundation of an authoritarian, homogenous Polish state, and became its chairman until 1937. From 1937 to 1939 he was the chairman of the &quot;Nation State Movement&quot; (Ruch Narodowo-Panstwowy) In 1937 he called for a strong national state that would be democratic During his political career he opposed Dmowski and the movement he belonged to sought integration with Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s &quot;sanacja&quot; faction, hoping that both main political factions in Poland would unite led by interest in well being of Polish nation However, he considered Dmowski one of the most influential persons of his life.

Wojciechowski initially saw &quot;traces of a modern national thought&quot; in the National Socialism. He initially admired Hitler&#x27;s anti-Jewish policy as a good example for Poland. He accepted the Anschluss of Austria and the Munich Agreement but became more critical of Hitler&#x27;s politics in the course of time. According to Tomasz Kenar he was alarmed by Hitler&#x27;s expansionism but accepted the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria, hoping that it would put Italy against Nazi Germany and into the sphere of Polish alliance. Regarding Munich Agreement he saw Czechoslovakia as too closely allied Soviet Union; while Czechs were in his view natural allies of Poles, their close contacts with the Soviets made such alliance impossible. He remained opposed to German annexation of Czechoslovakia, worried that such event would make Polish military situation difficult. Wojciechowski envisioned a Polish-led block in Central Europe composed of Hungary, Romania, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and in close relationship with Italy, that would oppose both German expansionism and Soviet pressure on these states; he wrote that such alliance would &quot;rescue Christianity&quot; from the threat of &quot;Bolshevik communism&quot; and &quot;hitlerite paganism&quot;. Later on he focused his attention towards Fascist Italy, due to his interest in a &quot;strong state&quot;, &quot;depending on legal norms, in tradition of Roman law&quot;. While nation was for Wojciechowski at time the &quot;greatest good&quot; he didn&#x27;t exhibit racist ideas or anything that would be similar to German &quot;volkisch&quot; elements in his works. During Nazi German occupation of Poland he along with his family sheltered a Jewish woman and in a 1945 publication he condemned the mass murder of Jews by Nazi Germany during the war as &quot;monstrous&quot;

Wojciechowski is described as a co-initiator of the Polish &quot;Western thought&quot; (myśl zachodnia), a &quot;mirror image of the German Ostforschung with a pinch of pan-Slavic sentiment thrown in&quot;. Unlike Ostforschung this movement was marginal in Poland, and limited only to Poznań University, while the Ostforschung was influential and remained (unlike the Poznań thinkers who were in conflict with state authorities both before and after World War II) in friendly relations with Berlin government.
The Polish researchers rejected the state model found in Germany, and preferred Francoist Spain or Salazar&#x27;s Portugal, remaining distrustful of Hitler. They rejected such ideas as biological racism, eugenics and militarism and neo-pagan movement.

===German occupation of Poland===

====Fate during German occupation====
While initially able to escape Germans, he was captured by them in October 1939 and held as hostage along with other Polish intellectuals, craftsmen, politicians and students. The group was held as part of German effort to crush Polish resistance, and they were threatened with murder in case of armed resistance. Every few days, Wojciechowski was allowed to visit home. If he wouldn&#x27;t return, the others would be shot. Eventually he was released two months later, due to his pregnant wife&#x27;s plea. Despite his release, the family faced further reprisals, as it had to flee Poznań as initial ethnic cleansing of Poles from the region was initiated by Nazi German authorities. Wojciechowski eventually found refugee at a friend&#x27;s house in Kraków.

====Underground activity====
During the occupation of Poland in World War II, he was involved with the Polish underground authorities, teaching at the &quot;Uniwersytet Ziem Zachodnich&quot; (&quot;University of the Western Territories&quot;, a part of the necessary underground education system) necessary, as all Poles were forbidden basic schooling as part of German genocide regarding Polish nation. He continued his research, and supervised his students (Zdzisław Kaczmarczyk, Kazimierz Kolańczyk) who finished two dissertations. In 1944 he also headed the Government Delegation for Poland&#x27;s Science Section in the Department of Information, and briefly, after the fall of the Warsaw Uprising, he was the deputy director of the Department. As part of conspiracy during Nazi German occupation he was one of the founding members of Ojczyzna-Omega, a conspiracy movement that gathered surviving (as Germans carried out systematic extermination of Polish educated classes) Polish intellectuals, priests, journalists, lawyers and teachers, who organised charity work, secret education and worked on concepts of post-war Poland; most of the members were Christian democrats and National Democrats. Ojczyzna-Omega envisioned a post-war Poland that would be a democratic, efficiently administrated state populated mainly by Polish majority alongside Jewish population and Slavic groups. The organisation believed that Nazi Germany (which attempted a genocide of Poles) was far more dangerous than Soviet Union and pushed for a compromise with Soviets.

Commissioned by the Union of Armed Struggle, a forerunner of the Home Army, Wojciechowski created a concept of a post-war Polish–German border in 1941, which included an overview of the Polish and Polonizable part of the population in areas between the pre-war border and the Oder-Neisse line. In tune with and probably in charge of Wojciechowski the director of the library of Kórnik at that time prepared the takeover of archives, museums and libraries in the future Western territories. In his designs Wojciechowski wanted to avoid what he defined as the mistakes of the Versailles Treaty. The border at Oder and Lusatian Neisse was essential for him, as he considered it, the historical argument was not decisive here, the safest and most defensible one.

On 17 December 1944 Tomasz Arciszewski, the Polish Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile in London, declared in a Sunday Times interview, that a post-war Poland had no territorial claims towards Stettin (Szczecin) and Breslau (Wrocław) but considers Lviv and Wilna an integral part of the Polish state. This led to a vote of no confidence of the Ojczyzna-group against Arciszewski for this &quot;renunciation of the Polish war aims&quot; and finally to the breakup with the Polish government-in-exile in London. Also in December 1944 he resumed the consequences of the failed Warsaw Uprising that, from his view, had shown, that not the Home Army but only the Red Army was capable to liberate Warsaw.

On 13 February 1945 Wojciechowski met the Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland, Edward Osóbka-Morawski, and handed over a memorandum about the foundation and activities of the Western Institute in which he asked for the support of the institute. The memorandum was addressed to the “Polish government”, thus recognizing the Provisional Government, contrary to the London exile-government, as legitimate. 
Conversely Wojciechowski&#x27;s concept aided the governmental demand to legitimize the Polish acquirements in the West

===Post-war===

In 1945 his book &quot;Poland-Germany. Ten centuries of struggle&quot; (first edition 1933) was reissued. To Wojciechowski the history of Polish-German relations was coined by an eternal struggle against German aggression which was founded on a lack of the ability of Germans to cohabit peacefully with Slavs and their &quot;biological&quot; hatred of everything Slavic. Wojciechowski described his view of the post-war situation:
&quot;There is a new epoch of Slavic march to the west that has replaced the German Drang nach Osten. Who doesn’t understand it, won’t understand the new era and won’t see properly the place of Poland in the new international reality”
Wojciechowski supported a new German-Polish border that would allocate the whole Oder Lagoon up to the river Peene to Poland.

He resumed teaching at UAM. He became a member of the Polish Academy of Learning (PAU) in 1945 and of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) in 1952. In 1944, he established the Western Institute (Instytut Zachodni), an institution dedicated to studying the Polish history of what would become the Recovered Territories. Initially in Warsaw, the institute&#x27;s seat moved to Poznań in 1945. Wojciechowski remained its director until his death in 1955. In 1945, Wojciechowski founded the affiliated journal &quot;Przegląd Zachodni&quot; (&quot;Western Review&quot;) and remained his editor-in-chief until his death in 1955. (An English-language version of the journal under the title Polish Western Affairs was published from 1960 to 1994). From 1948–52, he was also founder and editor-in-chief of the &quot;Journal of Law and History&quot; (&quot;Czasopismo Prawno-Historyczne&quot;), which continues to exist to this day. In his prologue to the bookseries &quot;Old Polish lands&quot; (1948–1957) he explained the purpose of the volumes to the reader:

&quot;Our publication ... is biased; in fact, it is consciously biased. ... We have not gone out of our way to write so-called objective history. Our task was to present the Polish history of those territories and to place the modern Polish reality of those territories within this historical context.&quot;


In 1950, as Poland underwent Stalinization, Wojciechowski was condemned for his &quot;anti-German chauvinism&quot; at a Polish historians conference. Hence the open synthesis of nationalist and communist historiography became less influential, though Polish Marxist publications maintained an anti-German undertone.

Zygmunt Wojciechowski died in Poznań, Poland, he was the father of historian Marian Wojciechowski (1927–2006).

===Recognition===
He was a recipient of Commander&#x27;s Cross and Officer&#x27;s Cross of Order of Polonia Restituta.

In 1984 the Western Institute was eventually named in his honor. In Poland Zygmunt Wojciechowski is recognised today as exceptional historian, and one of people who formed Polish intellectual elites.

<text>A private label, also called a private brand or private-label brand, is a brand owned by a company, offered by that company alongside and competing with brands from other businesses. A private-label brand is almost always offered exclusively by the firm that owns it. However, in rare instances, the brand is licensed to another company. The term often describes products, but can also encompass services.

The most common definition of a private label product is one that is outsourced: company A makes a product for company B, which company B then offers under their brand name. However, it can also define products made in retailer-owned firms. For example, in 2018, The Kroger Company had 60% of its private brands produced by third parties; the remaining 40% was manufactured internally by plants owned by Kroger. Private-label producers are usually anonymous, sometimes by contract. In other cases, they are allowed to mention their role publicly.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;private label&quot; originated in retail, but has since been used in other industries as well. Probably the best-known private-label brands are store brands, which are managed by supermarket and grocery store chains. Examples are Simple Truth by Kroger and Great Value by Wal-Mart. Store brands compete with national brands or name brands, like Coca-Cola or Lay&#x27;s.

The term &quot;private-label product&quot; overlaps with the term &quot;white-label product&quot;. They are sometimes used interchangeably but don&#x27;t mean the same thing. A private-label product is created exclusively for a client, who sets specific demands on what the product or service must contain. A white-label product is not created exclusively for one company, and although white-label manufacturers might offer customizations to their products, these are usually limited. The specifications of a private-label product are set out by the client, whereas a white-label product is more generic and already designed.

==Store brands==
In the supermarket and grocery store industry, the term &quot;private label/brand&quot; is almost always used, even if the same product is sold non-exclusively to multiple retailers with different packaging (&quot;white label/brand&quot;).

A store brand, also called a house brand or, in British English, an own brand, is a private-label brand trademarked and managed by a retailer. This brand is almost always offered exclusively at the chain store that owns it; in rare instances, however, the brand is licensed to another company. Examples of store brands are Simple Truth by Kroger, Great Value by Wal-Mart, Clover Valley by Dollar General, Market Pantry by Target, and Specially Selected by Aldi. Store brands can also be eponymous, or named after the store, such as Joe&#x27;s O&#x27;s cereal by Trader Joe&#x27;s. Store brands compete with national brands, also called premium brands or name brands, with its items sometimes being called brand-name products. Examples are Coca-Cola, Lay&#x27;s, and Kellogg&#x27;s. The general appeal of store-brand products is that they are usually offered at a lower price than their name-brand counterparts.

Most private-label store brand products are manufactured by third parties, but companies owned by the retailer make some. For instance, a vice president of The Kroger Company stated in 2018 that approximately 60% of their private-label products are outsourced. The remaining 40% is manufactured internally: in 2018, Kroger owned 38 plants, including 19 dairy farms, 10 bakeries, and 2 butcheries, strategically spread across the US. Similarly, Safeway Inc. owned 32 plants as of 2012. Most retailers prefer to keep the identity of their suppliers private, and accordingly have non-disclosure clauses in their contracts, making it difficult to determine the producer of a private-label product. In a few cases though, the manufacturer is allowed to mention it publicly, is revealed through a product recall, or in rare instances, is stated on the product itself. For example, the bags of Kirkland Signature coffee by Costco feature the text &quot;Custom roasted by Starbucks&quot;.

Private-label brands emerged in the 19th century. Until the early 20th century, their general focus was on delivering quality at a price below that of the national brands. In the first half of the 20th century, the quality of private brands diluted and their standards dropped. In their competitive struggle against national brands, low prices were considered more important than quality. In the second half of the century, this trend gradually reversed. As quality and visual appearance improved, private labels rose to prominence in the 1970s and &#x27;80s. By the 1990s, they were increasingly seen as a threat to the established brands. Also, from the 1990s onwards, a premiumization of store brands began to occur, giving rise to more expensive premium private labels. A survey conducted by the UK&#x27;s Groceries Code Adjudicator in 2024 noted that retailers were introducing more own-label products and the adjudicator commented that this trend added to management complexities for suppliers.

Generic brands are often associated with store brands. Generic products were first introduced in the United States in 1977, quickly winning market share from national and private-label brands. A 1981 academic article described them as products &quot;without brand names, in very plain packages with simple labels and usually sold at prices below both the national and private brands with which they compete&quot;. Packages of generic products often feature only the name of the type of product it contains, e.g. &quot;Cola&quot; or &quot;Batteries&quot;. Nowadays, the terms &quot;generic brand&quot; and &quot;store brand&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably. The term &quot;generic&quot; can be used as a pejorative toward store brand items that are perceived as bland or cheap.

A private-label brand is often produced by the same company that manufactures the national brand of that product. Different brands target different consumers. For instance, Kimberly-Clark makes Huggies diapers, but also produces a Walmart budget version. Allegedly, some store-brand items are identical to their name-brand counterparts: they are said to be literally the same product, except for the packaging and price. In other cases, a manufacturer can have multiple formulas for one product, creating a private-label version using one method and the national-label version using another. In 2007, a mass-recall of contaminated pet food products brought to light that more than 100 different brands of pet food, both premium- and private-label, were in fact produced by a single company: Menu Foods Inc. in Ontario, Canada. The ingredients and recipes they used differed substantially among brands, depending on what their clients specified.

In the United Kingdom, supermarkets have been criticised for &quot;fake farm&quot; private label brands.

==In fast food==
Fast-food restaurant chains sell their products under their private-label brands. Their core items are usually fries and meat-based items, but they might also offer brownies, muffins, cookies, and salads. These private-brand products are offered alongside national-brand products, such as soft drinks by Coca-Cola or Pepsi, and ice creams co-branded with Oreo or M&amp;M&#x27;s.

==In finance==
A private-label credit card (PLCC) is a type of credit card that can only be used at a specific company or chain of companies. Since this is virtually always a retail business, they are also called store cards. The retailer partners with a bank that issues the cards, funds the credits, and collects payments from customers. The cards themselves are branded with the logo of the store, but not the bank. Examples are the Target Circle Card (formerly Target RedCard) (issued by TD Bank, N.A.), the Walmart Reward Card (issued by Capital One), and the Amazon Store Card (issued by Synchrony Bank). PLCCs also do not carry the logo of the payment network (e.g. Visa or Mastercard), but they do use that network for transactions.

Private-label store credit cards are sometimes compared to but not the same as co-branded credit cards. These cards usually feature the payment network logo, and sometimes the bank&#x27;s logo. Unlike PLCCs, co-branded cards work like &#x27;normal&#x27; credit cards, usable at any place where that type of card is accepted. For instance, warehouse chain Nordstrom offers a Nordstrom Store Card (private label) and a Nordstrom Credit Card (co-branded), both issued by TD Bank, N.A. and using Visa&#x27;s network.

== Benefits of private label ==
* Cost savings– Private label products are often priced lower than their branded counterparts, providing cost savings for consumers.
* Quality control—Retailers have greater control over the quality of private-label products since they work closely with manufacturers to meet their specific requirements. Retailers can ensure that their private-label products meet their quality standards and customer expectations.
* Flexibility and agility– Retailers have greater flexibility and agility in introducing new products and responding to changing market trends with private-label products. They can quickly adapt to consumer preferences, experiment with different product offerings, and capitalize on emerging market opportunities.
* Higher profit margins– Private label products offer retailers higher profit margins than branded products. Since private label products are manufactured directly for the retailer, no intermediary brand costs are involved.

<text>Henri Constant Gabriel Pierné (16 August 1863 – 17 July 1937) was a French composer, conductor, pianist and organist.

==Biography==
Gabriel Pierné was born in Metz. His family moved to Paris, after Metz and part of Lorraine were annexed to Germany in 1871 following the Franco-Prussian War. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire, gaining first prizes for solfège, piano, organ, counterpoint and fugue. He won the French Prix de Rome in 1882, with his cantata &quot;Edith&quot;. His teachers included Antoine François Marmontel, Albert Lavignac, Émile Durand, César Franck (for the organ) and Jules Massenet (for composition).

He succeeded César Franck as organist at Sainte-Clotilde Basilica in Paris from 1890 to 1898. He himself was succeeded by another distinguished Franck pupil, Charles Tournemire. Associated for many years with Édouard Colonne&#x27;s concert series, the Concerts Colonne, from 1903, Pierné became chief conductor of this series in 1910.

His most notable early performance was the world premiere of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Firebird&quot;, at the Ballets Russes, Paris, on 25 June 1910. He remained in the post until 1933 (when Paul Paray took over his duties).

He made a few electrical recordings for Odeon Records, from 1928 to 1934, conducting the L&#x27;Orchestre Colonne, including a 1929 performance of his &quot;Ramuntcho&quot; and a 1931 performance of excerpts from his ballet &quot;Cydalise et le Chevre-pied&quot;.

He died in Ploujean, Finistère.

==Music==

Pierné wrote several operas, choral and symphonic pieces as well as a good deal of chamber music. His most famous composition is probably the oratorio &quot;La Croisade des enfants&quot; based on the book by Marcel Schwob. Also notable are such shorter works as his &quot;March of the Little Lead Soldiers&quot;, which once enjoyed substantial popularity (not only in France) as an encore; the comparably popular &quot;Marche des petits faunes&quot; is from his ballet &quot;Cydalise et le Chèvre-pied&quot;. His chamber work &quot;Introduction et variations sur une ronde populaire&quot; for saxophone quartet is a standard in the saxophone quartet repertoire.

His discovery and promotion of the work of Ernest Fanelli in 1912 led to a controversy over the origins of impressionist music.

==Honours==
Pierné became a member of the Academie des Beaux Arts in 1925. He was made a Commandeur de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur in 1935. His tomb at Père Lachaise Cemetery has a headstone designed by sculptor Henri Bouchard.

Square Gabriel Pierné in Paris is named after him.

<text>William Ambrose Hulbert (October 23, 1832 – April 10, 1882) was an American professional baseball executive who was one of the founders of the National League, considered by many to be baseball&#x27;s first major league, and was also the president of the Chicago White Stockings franchise.

==Biography==
Born in Burlington Flats, New York, Hulbert moved with his family to Chicago two years later where he lived the rest of his life save for a stint at Beloit College beginning in 1851. When he returned to Chicago from school, he married into the family of a successful grocer and expanded the business into the coal trade. A backer of the Chicago White Stockings baseball club of the National Association from its inception in 1871, Hulbert became an officer of the club in 1874 when it resumed play after being forced to sit out two seasons due to the Great Chicago Fire. He assumed the club presidency the next year.

In his brief tenure as a club president in the National Association, Hulbert soon became fed up with the circuit&#x27;s lack of definite structure, organization, and integrity. He was particularly disgusted by the Davy Force case in 1874. Force, the shortstop of the White Stockings that year, was a notorious &quot;contract jumper&quot;, a common occurrence in the National Association in which players would move from team to team each year selling themselves to the highest bidder. Determined to keep his shortstop, Hulbert signed him to a contract for the 1875 season in September, before the 1874 season had concluded, a violation of league rules. In December, Force signed a second contract with the Philadelphia Athletics, and Hulbert protested. The Association Judiciary committee originally awarded Force to Chicago, but at a second meeting in early 1875, after a Philadelphia man had been elected president of the association, the decision was reversed.

Hulbert became convinced that the Eastern ballclubs were conspiring to keep the Western clubs second-class citizens and plotted to overthrow the might of the Boston Red Stockings, which won each association pennant between 1872 and 1875. To do so, he convinced Illinois native and star Boston pitcher Al Spalding to sign with Chicago for the 1876 season and also signed Boston stars Cal McVey, Deacon White, and Ross Barnes and Philadelphia stars Cap Anson and Ezra Sutton, though Sutton later backed out of his deal. The signings were made while the 1875 season was in progress, but Hulbert decided to anticipate league disciplinary action by establishing his own league.

After enlisting the support of Western clubs including the Cincinnati Red Stockings, the St. Louis Brown Stockings, and the Louisville Grays, Hulbert held a meeting with the Eastern clubs of the Mutual of New York, the Athletic of Philadelphia, the Boston Red Stockings, and the Hartford Dark Blues on February 2, 1876, at the Grand Central Hotel in New York City and sold them on his vision for a new league founded on the principles of square dealings, recognition of contracts, and business integrity. He also proposed a more orderly game on the field through prohibitions on drinking, gambling, and Sunday baseball, and more definite organization off it through limiting membership to cities of 75,000 inhabitants or more, giving clubs exclusive territorial rights, and mandating teams to complete a predetermined schedule. The result was the founding of the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs. At the founding meeting, straws were drawn to determine the first president of the circuit, and Hartford president Morgan Bulkeley drew the short straw. He only remained president for one year and took little interest in the affairs of the league, not even bothering to attend the 1877 league meeting. When he did not show up, Hulbert was elected the new president, retaining his presidency of the White Stockings as well.

In his tenure as president from 1877 to his death in 1882, Hulbert ruled with an iron fist and took steps to ensure league integrity and compliance with league rules. His first major act was expelling the New York and Philadelphia clubs from the league for failure to complete their 1876 schedules as required. While losing clubs in the two most populous cities in the United States was a serious blow, the expulsion sent a clear message that the lax adherence to league rules that had plagued the National Association would not be tolerated. Also in response to the New York/Philadelphia scheduling problem, Hulbert ended the practice of clubs determining their schedules through the club secretaries by declaring that the league itself would establish the schedule. Hulbert also instituted the practice of the league hiring of umpires to bolster public perceptions of league integrity.

Perhaps his greatest challenge was dealing with four members of the Louisville ball club who conspired to throw the 1877 pennant. In a move that established a precedent for future handling of dishonest ballplayers, Hulbert banned all four players from the league for life. The banning had a ripple effect across the league that led to the Louisville, St. Louis, and Hartford franchises folding, and the league began to face a crisis as Hulbert was forced to replace these and other teams over the years with clubs from smaller cities such as Providence, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, and Syracuse. In 1879, after the Cincinnati franchise nearly collapsed amid controversy created by having three star players making more money than the rest of the team combined, Hulbert oversaw the imposition of the first reserve rule designed to curb player salaries and prevent players jumping from team to team.

Hulbert&#x27;s final major act as president also involved the Cincinnati franchise. While it was understood from the league&#x27;s inception that beer and Sunday baseball were inappropriate, they were not actually prohibited by league rules, and the Cincinnati club, playing in a city with a large German population fond of beer and Sunday entertainment, practiced both activities to boost revenue. This led the league to pass new rules banning both for the 1881 season and then expelling the unapologetic Cincinnati club for violating a rule that would not go into effect for two more months. This final league expulsion brought the National League its greatest challenge yet, as Cincinnati spearheaded the creation of the rival American Association in 1882 that moved into populous areas abandoned by the NL over the years such as New York and Philadelphia. Hulbert did not live to see this rival franchise begin play, however, dying of a heart attack in 1882 at the age of 49 two weeks before the AA made its debut.

For decades, Hulbert was kept out of the Baseball Hall of Fame despite his critical role in founding the first professional league. This was because when American League founder and first president Ban Johnson was elected to the Hall in 1937, it was decided that an early National League executive should be enshrined as well, and apparently not looking into history too closely, the electors chose to elect Morgan Bulkeley because he was the first president of the league. The Veterans Committee finally enshrined Hulbert in 1995.

Hulbert is buried in Graceland Cemetery under a grave marker designed to look like a baseball. In addition to his name and his birth and death dates, the marker includes the names of the cities that were in the National League at the time of his death.

<text>The Flux Advanced Security Kernel (FLASK) is an operating system security architecture that provides flexible support for security policies. It is a joint venture between the National Security Agency, the University of Utah, and the Secure Computing Corporation project designed to provide a framework for a more secure operating system. Development and implementation started with the Mach microkernel, and has since shifted its focus to the Linux operating system. FLASK is a core framework in security-focused operating systems such as NSA&#x27;s Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), OpenSolaris FMAC and TrustedBSD. This means that SELinux can be thought of as an implementation of FLASK.

<doc id="876150" wikidata="Q5347058" url="?curid=876150" title="Eel River (Wabash River tributary)">
<text>The Eel River is a tributary of the Wabash River in northern Indiana in the United States. Via the Wabash and Ohio rivers, its waters flow to the Mississippi River and ultimately the Gulf of Mexico. The Eel River rises southeast of Huntertown in Allen County and flows southwest through Allen, Whitley, Kosciusko, Wabash, Miami, and Cass counties to join the Wabash at Logansport. The river was called Kineepikwameekwa Siipiiwi - &quot;river of the snake fish&quot; by the Miami people, who inhabited the area at the time of European contact, the English rendered it as &quot;Ke-na-po-co-mo-co&quot;. It is the northern of the two rivers named Eel River within Indiana.

==Origins and history==

===Natural history===
Originating as an &quot;ice-marginal channel&quot; at the edge of the retreating Saginaw Lobe of the Wisconsin Glacier, the Eel River was later buried by the glacier&#x27;s advancing Erie Lobe. As the Erie Lobe retreated, the Eel formed a single stream with what is now upper Cedar Creek in DeKalb and Allen counties. The ancestral Eel River was also fed by glacial meltwater surging under the ice from the southeast through a &quot;tunnel valley&quot; known today as Cedar Creek Canyon. Blockage of the Eel&#x27;s channel by outwash from the canyon and a decline in the volume of meltwater forced the upper Eel to change course into the canyon, creating today&#x27;s Cedar Creek. This is a classic example of stream piracy that shifted almost of land from the Eel-Wabash watershed to that of the St. Joseph-Maumee.

===Indigenous peoples and French exploration===
The waterways were where indigenous peoples settled in prehistoric and historic times, as they were sources of food and water, and the avenues for transportation and trade. The Miami, an Algonquian-speaking people, called the river &quot;Kineepikwameekwa Siipiiwi&quot; or &quot;Ke-na-po-co-mo-co&quot;, meaning &quot;river of the snake fish.&quot; Later French explorers, who also followed the waterways, called it the &quot;Rivière L&#x27;Anguille&quot; (Eel River).
===Political and military history===

Before the United States consolidated its hold on the Northwest Territory, the Eel formed a rough boundary between the Potawatomi tribe on the north and the Miami tribe on the south. In addition, it was an area of competition between French and British colonial forces for decades before the American Revolution. Afterward, the US fought with American Indians in numerous battles sometimes called the Northwest Indian War.

In November 1780, a French militia force under Auguste Mottin de la Balme, who planned to seize a British trading post on the Eel near present-day Columbia City, was destroyed by the Miami led by Chief Michikinikwa, also known as &quot;Little Turtle&quot;. On 19 October 1790, Chief Michikinikwa&#x27;s warriors surprised and virtually annihilated a U.S. force under Colonel John Hardin in the Eel bottomlands southeast of present-day Churubusco.

On 7 August 1791, the Eel was the scene of another battle, when General James Wilkinson destroyed the Miami town of Kenapacomaqua upstream from present-day Logansport.

In September 1812, Colonel James Simrall, acting under orders from General William Henry Harrison, ravaged Miami farms and villages along the Eel in present-day Whitley County. He defeated a Miami force that stood and fought.

<doc id="876156" wikidata="Q528746" url="?curid=876156" title="Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash">
<text>Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash is the second studio album by the London-based, Irish folk punk band the Pogues, released on 5 August 1985. The album reached number 13 on the UK charts. The track &quot;A Pair of Brown Eyes&quot;, based on an older Irish tune, reached number 72 on the UK singles chart. &quot;The Old Main Drag&quot; later appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;.

== Title ==
The album&#x27;s title is taken from a quotation attributed to Winston Churchill: &quot;Don&#x27;t talk to me about naval tradition. It&#x27;s nothing but rum, sodomy, and the lash.&quot; The title was suggested by drummer Andrew Ranken, who said &quot;it seemed to sum up life in our band&quot;.

== Artwork ==
The cover artwork is an altered version of &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;, a Romantic-era painting by Theodore Géricault, with the band members&#x27; heads, painted by Peter Mennim, replacing those of various figures on the raft.

== Recording ==
Elvis Costello, whose manager Jake Riviera approached the band, was originally employed to produce two songs for a single, &quot;A Pair of Brown Eyes&quot; and &quot;Sally MacLennane&quot;, but after recording at Elephant Studios in Wapping was extended Costello agreed to record the entire album. Chevron later said, &quot;The Pogues needed, more than anything, not to be not so much as produced as facilitated. Recording the band as live as possible, but with a great deal of natural acoustic presence in the instruments – was quite a revolutionary thing to do 1985.&quot; Costello said, &quot;I saw my task was to capture them in their dilapidated glory before some more professional producer fucked them up.&quot;

==Critical reception and accolades==
&quot;Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash&quot; received very positive reviews from critics. &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Adam Sweeting said, &quot;The brightest, most intense moments of &quot;Rum ...&quot; aren&#x27;t about particularities of style or delivery. This is, apart from anything else, music to hang on to other people by to stave off brutal fact and the weight of history. While The Pogues make music for drunks as well, probably, as anyone has they&#x27;re also dragging an oft-ignored folk tradition into the daylight with an altogether improbable potency ... &quot;Rum ...&quot; has soul, if not a great deal of innovation, and somewhere among the glasses and the ashtrays lie a few home truths.&quot; &quot;Sounds&quot;″ Jane Simon called &quot;Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash&quot; &quot;the finest slice of story-telling your heart could wish for&quot;. David Quantick of &quot;NME&quot; described the record as &quot;a collection of free-ranging stuff to be sure; from the funereal folk ballad to the near spaghetti-western instrumental, raucous celebration to brown study, cheerful melody to downright strangeness. It&#x27;s never sentimental, it&#x27;s rarely polite, and it&#x27;s certainly not ordinary ... &quot;Rum Sodomy and the Lash&quot; is more than the best record The Pogues could be expected to make at this time. It&#x27;s more than a brilliant example of a band using its resources in an imaginative manner. It&#x27;s probably the best LP of 1985.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote that &quot;none of it would mean much without the songs—some borrowed, some traditional, and some proof that MacGowan can roll out bitter blarney with the best of his role models.&quot;

In a retrospective review, Mark Deming of AllMusic stated that &quot;Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash&quot; &quot;falls just a bit short of being the Pogues&#x27; best album, but was the first one to prove that they were a great band, and not just a great idea for a band.&quot; Daniel Bristow of the Irish music website CLUAS awarded the album an eight out of ten, calling it &quot;a record that will never cease to delight, always a pleasure to hear and highly, highly recommended if you&#x27;re not familiar with it already&quot;. Mark Cooper of &quot;Q&quot; described the record as &quot;a proud, defiant bruise of an album that manages to be both profoundly bleak and immoderately romantic and it remains MacGowan&#x27;s and The Pogues&#x27; finest hour&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot;″s Jon Wilde wrote that &quot;the most startling thing about their second album was the steep ascendancy of MacGowan&#x27;s songwriting&quot;, while &quot;Spin&quot;″s Jon Dolan said that the album contained &quot;some of the purest toothless lyricism in punk-rock history.&quot;

In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; placed &quot;Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash&quot; at number 93 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2012, the album was ranked number 440 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named it the 67th best album of the 1980s. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="876157" wikidata="Q4912534" url="?curid=876157" title="Billy Evans">
<text>William George Evans (February 10, 1884 – January 23, 1956), nicknamed &quot;the Boy Umpire&quot;, was an American umpire in Major League Baseball (MLB) who worked in the American League from 1906 to 1927. He became, at age 22, the youngest umpire in major league history, and later became the youngest to officiate in the World Series at age 25.

Upon his retirement at age 43, his 3,319 career games ranked fifth in major league history; his 1,757 games as a home plate umpire ranked third in AL history, and remain the eighth-most by a major league umpire. He later became a key front office executive for the Cleveland Indians and Detroit Tigers of MLB, the Cleveland Rams of the National Football League, and president of the minor league Southern Association.

In addition to his inside role in the sport, Evans authored countless articles, as well as two books, &quot;Umpiring from the Inside&quot; (1947) and &quot;Knotty Problems in Baseball&quot; (1950). He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973, the third umpire ever selected.

==Formative years==
Evans was born in Chicago. When he was still a child, he relocated with his family to Youngstown, Ohio, where his Welsh-born father became superintendent at a Carnegie steel plant. In Youngstown, the Evans family joined Westminster Presbyterian Church, where Billy Evans attended Sunday school. As a youth, Evans was active in YMCA programs and participated in a neighborhood baseball club called the Youngstown Spiders, a team named in honor of the regionally popular Cleveland Spiders. He gained notability as an athlete at Youngstown&#x27;s Rayen School, excelling at baseball, football, and track. In 1902, Evans enrolled at Cornell University, where he played on a freshman team managed by veteran major league shortstop Hughie Jennings. After two years, his law studies and collegiate sports career came to an end, with the sudden death of his father. Evans returned to Ohio and accepted a job as a sports reporter at the &quot;Youngstown Daily Vindicator&quot;. The paper&#x27;s city editor, Sam Wright, hired Evans on the basis of writing experience he secured as a staff member of his high school yearbook and college newspaper. At the same time, Wright understood that Evans&#x27; varied experiences as an athlete provided him with an in-depth knowledge of sports.

In the early 1900s, while covering a baseball game between the Youngstown Ohio Works club and a team from Homestead, Pennsylvania, Evans was approached by the manager of the local club, ex-major leaguer Marty Hogan, and asked to fill an umpire vacancy. According to Evans&#x27;s obituary, the aspiring reporter, who was on a date with a young woman, &quot;wasn&#x27;t interested until Hogan mentioned he would be paid $15 a week for officiating the game&quot;, a figure equivalent to a week&#x27;s salary at his sportswriting job.

Evans&#x27; ability caught the attention of Charlie Morton, president of the Ohio–Pennsylvania League, and he was offered a full-time position as a league umpire. Evans accepted the job, on the condition that he could retain his position as a sportswriter. In 1906, he received a spectacular career boost from fellow Youngstowner Jimmy McAleer, an ex-major leaguer who was so impressed with the young man&#x27;s ability that he recommended Evans to American League president Ban Johnson. This gesture enabled Evans to move from a Class C Division minor league club to the major leagues.

==Major league umpiring career==
At 22 years of age, Evans was the youngest umpire in major league history; furthermore, he was among those very rare umpires who broke into the major leagues with little previous professional experience. He was regarded as the only umpire of his era who never had played professional baseball himself. After making his debut at Highlanders&#x27; Park in New York City, he went on to umpire for six World Series: 1909, 1912, 1915, 1917, 1919 and 1923. Working in an era during which most major league games used no more than two umpires (and sometimes only one), Evans single-handedly umpired seven double-headers in eight days during the 1907 season. He was the base umpire for Charlie Robertson&#x27;s perfect game on April 30, 1922.

Unlike many umpires, Evans never made claims to infallibility. &quot;I missed a lot of decisions&quot;, he once said. &quot;At the time of making such a decision there was no doubt in my mind as to its correctness. However, a second or two later I felt that I erred and wished I could change my original ruling&quot;. Evans&#x27; humility and impartiality did not always protect him from abusive fans. As sportswriters Daniel Okrent and Steve Wulf observed, &quot;roughness on the field seemed to elicit the same in the stands&quot;. On September 15, 1907, in the midst of a doubleheader between the St. Louis Browns and Detroit Tigers, Evans suffered a skull fracture when a bottle hurled by an angry spectator knocked him unconscious. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the incident as &quot;one of the most disgraceful scenes ever witnessed on a ball field&quot;.

Evans became known as an innovator during more than two decades with the American League. One obituary observed that he &quot;introduced something new to officiating by running down to a base where a play was made so that he would be on top of it&quot;. This approach became a standard practice among major league officials. He was also aware of the increasing demands placed on umpires and strongly advocated formal training for baseball officials. Furthermore, in a game that retained much of the rough-and-tumble atmosphere of earlier decades, Evans &quot;substituted diplomacy for belligerency and proved an arbiter could control a game without threats of physical violence&quot;.
At the same time, he was unwilling to &quot;back down&quot; when physically threatened. In September 1921, Evans was involved in a bloody fistfight with Ty Cobb, who contested one of Evans&#x27; calls. Baseball historian David Anderson noted that the trouble began when Cobb threatened to &quot;whip&quot; Evans &quot;right at home plate&quot;, a move that would have led to Cobb&#x27;s immediate suspension. Evans supposedly invited Cobb to the umpire&#x27;s dressing room for &quot;post-game festivities&quot;, and before long, the two men were brawling beneath the stands as players from both teams looked on. According to some accounts, many of Cobb&#x27;s Detroit Tigers teammates &quot;rooted&quot; for Evans. After the fight, Cobb was suspended for one game, while Evans attended the next several games wearing bandages. Both men had agreed before the fight that they would not report it to league officials, but a word of the incident eventually reached the league president, Ban Johnson. According to sports writers Okrent and Wulf, Johnson responded to news of the incident &quot;with uncharacteristic humor&quot;, saying &quot;only that he was sorry that he missed it&quot;.

For the duration of his career as an umpire, Evans also remained active as a sportswriter. From 1918 to 1928, he served as sports editor of Newspaper Enterprise Association and produced a syndicated sports column titled, &quot;Billy Evans Says&quot;. His staff featured well-known sportswriters Jimmy Powers and Joe Williams.

==Executive career==
Evans retired from umpiring following the 1927 season to become the general manager of the Cleveland Indians, earning a substantial annual salary of $30,000. Baseball historian Bill James observed that Evans was the first front-office executive of a major league team to be officially called a &quot;general manager&quot;. In this capacity, Evans was credited with taking the Indians from a second division to a first division team. He served as general manager for the next eight years, until budget cuts forced him out in 1935. Rumors circulated that Evans&#x27;s decision to leave the Indians was also motivated by a disagreement with the Indians&#x27; manager, Walter Johnson, over the suspension of third baseman Willie Kamm and the release of catcher Glenn Myatt. Johnson allegedly accused Evans of &quot;disloyalty&quot;, while Evans reportedly replied that he refused to be a &quot;yes man&quot;. Evans soon found work as chief scout and head of the Boston Red Sox farm system, but left on October 8, 1940, after the team sold Pee Wee Reese to the Brooklyn Dodgers over his objections.

Shifting sports, Evans returned to Cleveland to become general manager of the Cleveland Rams for the 1941 season. Although the team struggled on the field, it was a financial success, but after failing to come to terms on a new contract, Evans left and spent the next year writing before accepting the position of league president of the Southern Association on December 3, 1942.

During his four years leading the league, the Association thrived despite many other leagues shutting down due to World War II. In his first year, attendance increased by nearly 300,000, and while it dipped slightly in 1944, the threshold of one million people attending league games was again reached the following year.

On December 16, 1946, Evans accepted a contract offer from the Detroit Tigers to become their general manager. One of his first moves was dramatic – selling ageing superstar Hank Greenberg to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Over the next four years, the team had two runner-up finishes to the New York Yankees, but after dropping in the standings during the 1951 season, Evans announced his resignation on July 28 in favor of Tiger legend Charlie Gehringer.

==Private life==
Despite long absences from his residence in Cleveland, Evans was known as a devoted husband and father. He married the former Hazel Baldwin in 1908; the couple had one child, Robert, who became the sports director of a radio station in Miami, Florida. Evans maintained close ties with family members and died while visiting his son in Miami.

Despite his success, Evans remained accessible to friends from his early days in Youngstown. Shortly after Evans&#x27; death, a former high school classmate, E. Allan Lightner, recalled that his late friend &quot;was still the fine clean character that he was in his high school days in Youngstown&quot;. Lightner recalled that, shortly after his final conversation with the retired umpire, Evans sent Lightner an autographed photo of himself with former Detroit Tigers manager Red Rolfe.

==Final years==
By 1952, Evans had unofficially retired, then was injured in an automobile accident in Monroe, Michigan. After recovering, he remained in good health until January 21, 1956, when he suffered a massive stroke while visiting his son. Evans died two days later at the age of 71. Funeral services were held in Cleveland. Evans&#x27; remains were interred at Knollwood Cemetery in Mayfield Heights, Ohio.

==Legacy==
Evans&#x27; contributions to baseball have been widely recognized. In 1946 he was named in the Honor Rolls of Baseball, and in 1973 he became the third umpire elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Evans is honored for the high standard of professionalism he set during his career as an official, and he is credited as a tireless advocate of formal training for umpires. Ironically, as David Anderson observed, Evans might have been denied the opportunity to serve as an official in the major leagues &quot;if the present day umpire school system existed during the Dead Ball Era&quot;. Anderson noted that Evans&#x27; description of the basic qualities required of an effective umpire holds up even today: &quot;Good eyes, plenty of courage – mental and physical – thorough knowledge of the playing rules, more than average portions of fair play, common sense and diplomacy, an entire lack of vindictiveness, plenty of confidence in your ability&quot;.

In 1917 Billy Evans &quot;noted American League Umpire&quot; teamed up with the Spalding Athletic Library for the book, &quot;How to umpire&quot;.

<text>The Small Craft Insignia (more commonly known as the Small Craft Pin) is a military award of the United States Navy.

It was created after the Vietnam War to give recognition to the specially trained naval personnel of the inshore boat units and river assault commands.

The Small Craft Pin (commonly called the &#x27;Coxswain Pin&#x27; or &#x27;Boat Pin&#x27; by U.S. Navy sailors) is issued in gold for officers and silver for enlisted personnel. It shows a small craft circumscribed by anchor flukes on the sides and bottom and a three-star pennant on top. The three stars represent the three main areas of U.S. Navy riverine operations in Vietnam: Game Warden, Market Time, and Sealords (Southeast Asia, Lakes, Oceans, Rivers and Deltas Strategy). Waves under the small craft represent the past, present, and future. The anchor represents the Navy. 

To qualify for the Small Craft insignia, a service member must complete full qualifications at every watch station of a small craft. This normally includes positions as crewman/gunner, engineer, navigator, and coxswain. Enlisted personnel must have served as the Petty Officer in Charge (POIC) of a small craft for six months. Officers must hold the additional qualification of Watch Officer. 

Small Craft Insignia is also worn by Maritime Expeditionary Squadron (MSRON) sailors and Coast Guardsmen attached to MSRON squadrons who qualify as Tactical Craft Coxswain. The Tactical Craft Coxswain is overall responsible for the safety of the craft and crew, as well as tactical movements, and weapons employment. The Tactical Craft Coxswain must complete the Tactical Craft Operations (TCO) PQS, as well as, attend various schools pertaining to navigation, tactical maneuvers, and defense tactics. The Tactical Craft Coxswain possesses weapons release authority and is the ultimate authority on board for all decisions, unless embarked with a Patrol Leader or SOPA (Senior Line Officer Present Afloat). Their authority comes from Article 1033 (Chapter 10 of ALNAV PRECEDENCE, AUTHORITY AND COMMAND) which states: &quot;Authority in a Boat&quot; Except when embarked in a boat authorized by the Chief of Naval Operations to have an officer or petty officer in charge, the senior line officer (including commissioned warrant and warrant officer) eligible for command at sea has authority over all persons embarked therein, and is responsible for the safety and management of the boat.&quot; As such, the Tactical Craft Coxswain is petty officer in charge of a boat authorized by the CNO and may not be relieved of command of the craft unless by their Patrol Leader, or authorizing Commander. 

Sailors who have earned the silver pin while enlisted, then become commissioned officers are authorized to begin wearing the gold pin. (This is the only enlisted device that is authorized to change color upon the wearer&#x27;s commissioning without further qualification.) The pin may be awarded, by default, to any officer given command of a unit that uses small boats, upon receipt of the Command Ashore Pin, regardless of previous qualifications.

The Small Craft Pin is authorized by local commanders and is not considered a warfare qualification badge, such as the Surface Warfare Officer (SWO) insignia. People who served on small craft during World War II may receive the pin by asking the Department of the Navy. 
The Navy maintains a similar pin, the Craftmaster Insignia, for those qualified in the operation of vessels such as Landing Craft Utility, Landing Craft Air Cushioned, large harbor tugs, and various other tugs and barges. It is also awarded to certain staff officers and some midshipmen.

<text>Frederick Emmons Terman (; June 7, 1900 – December 19, 1982) was an American professor and academic administrator. He was the dean of the school of engineering from 1944 to 1958 and provost from 1955 to 1965 at Stanford University. He is widely credited (together with William Shockley) as being the father of Silicon Valley.

In 1951 he spearheaded the creation of Stanford Industrial Park (now Stanford Research Park), whereby the university leased portions of its land to high-tech firms. Companies such as Varian Associates, Hewlett-Packard, Eastman Kodak, General Electric, and Lockheed Corporation moved into Stanford Industrial Park and made the mid-Peninsula area into a hotbed of innovation which eventually became known as Silicon Valley.

==Early life and education==
Terman was born to Lewis Terman and Anna Belle Minton Terman on June 7, 1900, in Indiana, U.S. His father, Lewis Terman, was a eugenicist, a psychologist who studied gifted children and popularized the IQ test in America, and a professor at Stanford University. His mother attended Central Normal College and taught English at a school nearby. In 1895 she met Lewis Terman at the school; the relationship developed over the following years, culminating in marriage on Sept. 15, 1899. They then followed Lewis&#x27; education at Indiana University and Clark University.

At the age of 10, Terman arrived at Stanford when his father joined the psychology faculty. As a boy, his favorite hobby was ham radio.

==Education==
Terman completed his undergraduate degree in chemistry and his master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering at Stanford University. He went on to earn an ScD in electrical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1924 where his advisor was Vannevar Bush, who first proposed what became the National Science Foundation.

==Academic career==
Terman returned to Stanford in 1925 as a member of the engineering faculty. From 1925 to 1941 Terman designed a course of study and research in electronics at Stanford that focused on work with vacuum tubes, circuits (electrical network), and instrumentation. Terman received tenure at Stanford by having the administration match his tenure offer at Cornell University. He hired Charles Litton and Karl Spangenberg, a student of William Littell Everitt. Together they established a vacuum tube laboratory. He also wrote &quot;Radio Engineering&quot; (first edition in 1932; second edition, much improved, in 1937; third edition in 1947 with added coverage of new technologies developed during World War II; fourth edition in 1955 with a new title, &quot;Electronic and Radio Engineering&quot;), one of the most important books on electrical and radio engineering, and to this day a good reference on those subjects. Terman&#x27;s students at Stanford included Oswald Garrison Villard, Jr., Russell and Sigurd Varian, William Hewlett, and David Packard. He encouraged his students to form their own companies and personally invested in many of them, resulting in firms such as Litton Industries, Varian Associates, and Hewlett-Packard. Terman was president of the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1941.

=== War years ===
During World War II, Terman directed a staff of more than 850 at the Radio Research Laboratory at Harvard University. This organization was the source of Allied jammers to block enemy radar, tunable receivers to detect radar signals, and aluminum strips (&quot;chaff, window&quot;) to produce spurious reflections on enemy radar receivers. These countermeasures significantly reduced the effectiveness of radar-directed anti-aircraft fire.

=== Stanford Research Park and Silicon Valley ===
After the war, Terman returned to Stanford and was appointed dean of the School of Engineering. In 1945 he was influential in the creation of a microwave research laboratory at the Stanford School of Physical Sciences. In 1951 he spearheaded the creation of Stanford Industrial Park (now Stanford Research Park), whereby the university leased portions of its land to high-tech firms. Companies such as Varian Associates, Hewlett-Packard, Eastman Kodak, General Electric, and Lockheed Corporation moved into Stanford Industrial Park and made the mid-Peninsula area into a hotbed of innovation which eventually became known as Silicon Valley.

He served as provost at Stanford from 1955 to 1965. During his tenure, Terman greatly expanded the science, statistics and engineering departments in order to win more research grants from the Department of Defense. These grants, in addition to the funds that the patented research generated, helped to catapult Stanford into the ranks of the world&#x27;s first class educational institutions, as well as spurring the growth of Silicon Valley. Terman&#x27;s efforts to create a mutual relationship between Stanford and the tech companies in the surrounding area also significantly contributed to this growth.
Speaking of this effort, Terman said

In 1964, Terman became a founding member of the National Academy of Engineering. In 1966 Terman played a central role in helping the Park Chung Hee Administration establish the Korea Advanced Institute of Science, which later became KAIST. Terman Hall at KAIST was named in his honor in 2004.

==Recognition==

* He was awarded the IRE Medal of Honor in 1950 for &quot;his many contributions to the radio and electronic industry as teacher, author, scientist and administrator&quot;.
* He was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.
* The Frederick Emmons Terman Award was established in 1969 by the American Society for Engineering Education, Electrical and Computer Engineering Division. It is sponsored by Hewlett-Packard and is bestowed annually upon an outstanding young electrical engineering educator.
* The Frederick Emmons Terman Engineering Scholastic Award is presented to the students that rank academically in the top five percent of the graduating senior class from the Stanford University School of Engineering.
* Stanford&#x27;s Terman Engineering Center (1977–2011) was named in his honor.
* Terman Middle School in Palo Alto, California, and the adjacent Terman Park were named after Terman and his father. In 2018, the Palo Alto Unified School District school board unanimously decided to rename the school in honor of Ellen Fletcher after Terman&#x27;s father&#x27;s involvement with the eugenics movement came to the notice of parents and the school board. At the time of the renaming of the middle school, the city of Palo Alto had yet to decide if they would also rename the adjacent park.
* A section of U.S. Route 101 in California near Palo Alto is officially designated and signed as the Frederick E. Terman Memorial Highway.
* A road on the Tektronix Campus in Beaverton, Oregon is named after him.

<text>The Voyages extraordinaires (; ) is a collection or sequence of novels and short stories by the French writer Jules Verne. 

Fifty-four of these novels were originally published between 1863 and 1905, during the author&#x27;s lifetime, and eight additional novels were published posthumously. The posthumous novels were published under Jules Verne&#x27;s name, but had been extensively altered or, in one case, completely written by his son Michel Verne.

According to Verne&#x27;s editor Pierre-Jules Hetzel, the goal of the &quot;Voyages&quot; was &quot;to outline all the geographical, geological, physical, historical and astronomical knowledge amassed by modern science and to recount, in an entertaining and picturesque format ... the history of the universe.&quot;

Verne&#x27;s meticulous attention to detail and scientific trivia, coupled with his sense of wonder and exploration, form the backbone of the &quot;Voyages&quot;. Part of the reason for the broad appeal of his work was the sense that the reader could gain real knowledge of geology, biology, astronomy, paleontology, oceanography, history and the exotic locations and cultures of the world through the adventures of Verne&#x27;s protagonists. This great wealth of information distinguished his works as &quot;encyclopedic novels&quot;.

The first of Verne&#x27;s novels to carry the title &quot;Voyages Extraordinaires&quot; was &quot;The Adventures of Captain Hatteras&quot;, which was the third of all his novels.

The works in this series are adventure stories, some with overt science fiction elements (e.g., &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;) or elements of scientific romance (e.g., &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;).

==Theme==
In a late interview, Verne affirmed that Hetzel&#x27;s ambitious commission had become the running literary theme of his novel sequence:

However, Verne made clear that his own object was more literary than scientific, saying &quot;I do not in any way pose as a scientist&quot; and explaining in another interview:

==Publication==
In the system developed by Hetzel for the &quot;Voyages Extraordinaires&quot;, each of Verne&#x27;s novels was published successively in several different formats. This resulted in as many as four distinct editions of each text (labeled here according to current practice for Verne bibliographies): 
* Éditions pré-originales (pre-original editions): Serialization in a periodical, usually Hetzel&#x27;s own biweekly &quot;Magasin d&#x27;Éducation et de récréation&quot; (&quot;Magazine of Education and Recreation&quot;, founded 1864). The serialized installments were illustrated by artists on Hetzel&#x27;s staff, such as Édouard Riou, Léon Benett, and George Roux.
* Éditions originales (original editions): complete unillustrated texts published in book form at 18mo size. (Similar versions in the slightly larger 12mo size, with illustrations taken from the serialization, are also considered &quot;éditions originales.&quot;)
* Cartonnages dorés et colorés (gilded and colored bindings): Complete editions of the text, published in &quot;grand in-8º&quot; (&quot;large octavo&quot;) book form with a lavishly decorated cover. These deluxe editions, designed for Christmas and New Year&#x27;s markets, include most or all of the illustrations from the serializations.

==Continued appeal==
Jules Verne remains to this day the most translated science fiction author in the world as well as one of the most continually reprinted and widely read French authors. Though often scientifically outdated, his &quot;Voyages&quot; still retain their sense of wonder that appealed to readers of his time, and still provoke an interest in the sciences among the young.

The &quot;Voyages&quot; are frequently adapted into film, from Georges Méliès&#x27; fanciful 1902 film &quot;Le Voyage dans la Lune&quot; (aka &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;), to Walt Disney&#x27;s 1954 adaptation of &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot;, to the 1956 version of ‘’Around the World in 80 Days’’, starring Cantinflas, then 2004 version of &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; starring Jackie Chan. Their spirit has also continued to influence fiction to this day, including James Gurney&#x27;s Dinotopia series and &quot;softening&quot; Steampunk&#x27;s dystopianism with utopian wonder and curiosity.

==List of novels==
Most of the novels in the &quot;Voyages&quot; series (except for &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot;, &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, and &quot;The Purchase of the North Pole&quot;) were first serialized in periodicals, usually in Hetzel&#x27;s &quot;Magasin d&#x27;Éducation et de récréation&quot; (&quot;Magazine of Education and Recreation&quot;). Almost all of the original book editions were published by Pierre-Jules Hetzel in octodecimo format, often in several volumes. (The one exception is &quot;Claudius Bombarnac&quot;, which was first published in a grand-in-8º edition.)

What follows are the 55 novels published in Verne&#x27;s lifetime with the most common English-language title for each novel. The dates given are those of the first publication in book form.

<text>A motorcycle club is a group of individuals whose primary interest and activities involve motorcycles. A motorcycle group can range as clubbed groups of different bikes or bikers who own same model of vehicle like the Harley Owners Group.

There are a great many brand clubs, i.e. clubs dedicated to a particular marque, including those sponsored by various manufacturers, modeled on the original brand club, the Harley Owners Group. There are also large national independent motorcycle clubs, for example, the BMW Motorcycle Owners of America, and the Dominar Owners Club (DOC), an exclusive motorcycle group for Bajaj Dominar bikes only. There are also specific clubs for women, such as the Women&#x27;s International Motorcycle Association, and clubs for lesbians and gays, such as Dykes on Bikes.

Clubs catering for those interested in vintage machines such as the Vintage Motor Cycle Club are also popular as well as those centered on particular venues. Clubs catering for riders&#x27; rights such as the Motorcycle Action Group, and charities like The Royal British Legion Riders Branch and the Armed Forces Bikers Veterans Charity are also popular. Many affiliate with an umbrella organization, such as the British Motorcyclists Federation in the UK, or FEMA in Europe. Producing national and local branch club magazines and events are typical activities of such clubs.

Other organizations whose activities primarily involve motorcycles exist for specific purposes or social causes such as the Patriot Guard Riders, who provide funeral escorts for military veterans, and Rolling Thunder, which advocates for troops missing in action and prisoners of war. While neither of the latter two groups require a motorcycle for membership, they are motorcycling-oriented and much of their activity involves rides.

There are numerous religiously oriented clubs such as the Christian Motorcyclists Association, a biker ministry, charities such as Freewheelers EVS, which use motorcycles to provide an out-of-hours emergency medical courier service, and clubs which attract membership from specific groups, such as the Blue Knights Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club, for law enforcement personnel.

In the United Kingdom, two charities (the Institute of Advanced Motorists and RoSPA Advanced Drivers and Riders) have significant-sized motorcycle clubs with trained volunteers to promote roadcraft and help riders pass an advanced driving test.

== History ==
One of the first motorcycle clubs was the New York Motorcycle Club, which in 1903 merged with the Alpha Motorcycle Club of Brooklyn to become the Federation of American Motorcyclists. Later, the Motorcycle and Allied Trades Association (M&amp;ATA) formed a Rider Division which spun off into the American Motorcyclist Association.

==American Motorcyclist Association==
The American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) is the largest American motorcyclist organization. It serves as an umbrella organization for local clubs and sporting events. As of 2015, the AMA had over 200,000 members and over 1,200 chartered clubs.

==MCs and MCCs==
The abbreviations MC and MCC are both used to mean &quot;motorcycle club&quot; but have a special social meaning from the point of view of the &quot;outlaw&quot; or &quot;one percenter&quot; motorcycling subculture. MC is generally reserved for those clubs that are mutually recognized by other MC or outlaw motorcycle clubs. This is indicated by a motorcyclist wearing an MC patch, or a three-piece patch called colors, on the back of their jacket or riding vest. Outlaw or one percenter can mean merely that the club is not chartered under the auspices of the American Motorcyclist Association, implying a radical rejection of authority and embracing of the &quot;biker&quot; lifestyle as defined and popularized since the 1950s and represented by such media as &quot;Easyriders&quot; magazine, the work of painter David Mann and others. In many contexts the terms overlap with the usual meaning of &quot;outlaw&quot; because some of these clubs, or some of their members, are recognized by law enforcement agencies as taking part in organized crime.

Outside of the outlaw motorcyclist subculture, the words &quot;&quot; carry no pejorative meaning beyond the everyday English definition of the words – a club involving motorcycles, whose members come from every walk of life. Thus, there are clubs that are culturally and stylistically nothing like outlaw or one percenter clubs, and whose activities and goals not similar to them at all, but still use three-part patches or the initials MC in their name or insignia.

<text>Albert Joseph Barlick (April 2, 1915 – December 27, 1995) was an American umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the National League for 28 seasons (1940–1943, 1946–1955, 1958–1971). Barlick missed two seasons (1944–45) due to service in the United States Coast Guard and two seasons (1956–57) due to heart problems. He umpired seven World Series and seven All-Star Games.

Barlick was known for a strong voice and for booming strike calls. After he left active umpiring in 1971, Barlick became an umpire scout and supervisor. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in .

==Early life==
Barlick was born in Springfield, Illinois. His father, an Austrian immigrant, worked for 50 years at a Peabody coal mine. Barlick dropped out of high school after two years to support his family. He joined the Civilian Conservation Corps, and spent six months in Washington and six months in Wisconsin. When Barlick&#x27;s brother died, he returned to the coal mine to assist his father.

Barlick said that he did not play much baseball as a youngster, but that he often watched the game. During a coal mine strike, a 19-year-old Barlick was offered $1 ($) to umpire his first game. He played outfield in semipro baseball, but he was described as &quot;mediocre.&quot; In August 1936, the Class-D Northeast Arkansas League was in need of a replacement umpire, and hired Barlick for the last 4 weeks of the season. In 1937, Barlick was hired by the Class-B Piedmont League, moved to the Eastern League in 1939, and was promoted to the International League later that season.

==MLB career==
===Early career===
Late in the 1940 season, NL umpire Bill Klem was unable to work due to an ankle injury, so Barlick was hired as a replacement. He made his debut in a doubleheader at Shibe Park on September 8. Barlick was offered a contract for the 1941 season, and was 26 years old at the start of the season, making him one of the youngest MLB umpires in history. Before the 1941 season, Klem had strongly endorsed Barlick, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s going to be the greatest umpire in baseball history. He has a love of his work, a pride in it and the physical qualifications. Young? Certainly. But there&#x27;s something wrong with an umpire who serves a long time in the minors.&quot;

Barlick made his first ejection on July 27 of that year, when Brooklyn Dodgers catcher Herman Franks objected to Barlick&#x27;s strike zone. Barlick was selected as an umpire for the 1942 All-Star Game at the Polo Grounds.

Barlick joined the Coast Guard in November 1943, during World War II. He spent most of the next two years assigned to an 83-foot cutter based at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut. He was discharged in 1945, having earned the rank of Seaman First Class.

===Return from the Coast Guard===
Barlick returned to umpiring in 1946, when he umpired his first World Series. Klem repeated his endorsement of Barlick that year. &quot;There&#x27;s a fellow who&#x27;s going to be one of the great all-time umpires. He&#x27;s got everything and knows how to handle himself. Before I saw him, I predicted he&#x27;d be a great umpire just from what I heard about him.&quot; In 1947, Barlick was the first base umpire during Jackie Robinson&#x27;s MLB debut. In 1949, Barlick was again chosen as an umpire for the 1949 All-Star Game. He began the game at home plate, although when it became time for the umpires to rotate, as was customary during All-Star games, Barlick left the game, leaving the right field line uncovered; no reason was given for his departure.

In August 1949, Barlick ruled a forfeit at Shibe Park in a game between the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Giants. Fans had become irate over a call made by Barlick&#x27;s crew member George Barr and they littered the field with fruit, soda bottles and paper. The ruling constituted the first major league forfeit since 1942.

Before the 1956 season, Barlick was hospitalized in Illinois for treatment of a heart problem. League president Warren Giles characterized the issue as a minor heart ailment, but newspaper reports held that Barlick would not be ready for opening day that year. After he sat out the entire 1956 season, a March 1957 article reported that the heart issue would probably cause him to miss that season as well. He returned to the field for the 1958 season.

===Later career===
In 1961, the &quot;Sporting News&quot; polled managers and coaches to determine the best umpires in the major leagues. Barlick was voted as the most respected umpire in the National League, as well as the best caller of balls and strikes, best on the bases, best knowledge of rules, best at being in the right position and most serious-minded. Barlick stated that the poll was a disgrace due to the lack of qualifications of the writers and the nature of the categories, which included &quot;most sarcastic&quot;, &quot;hardest to talk to&quot;, &quot;biggest grandstander&quot;, and &quot;worst pop-off&quot;.

In 1963, the league instructed umpires to crack down on balks by pitchers. A few weeks after ejecting pitcher Bob Shaw due to an argument about balks, Barlick called Fred Fleig, the secretary of the National League, and said, “I&#x27;m fed up with the whole thing and I am going to quit and go home.” On June 17, 1963, Giles announced that there had been a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; and that Barlick would relax at his home for a few days before rejoining his umpire crew.

After the 1963 season, Barlick took a job as a public relations representative at Springfield&#x27;s Water, Light and Power Department. However, he returned as an umpire for the 1964 season. Barlick&#x27;s crew worked the first game at the Houston Astrodome in 1965. In 1966, Barlick missed nine games after his mother, Louise, died in Springfield. He missed the last two weeks of the 1966 season due to high blood pressure. After the 1968 season, Barlick accompanied the St. Louis Cardinals on a five-week tour of Japan. In 1969, Barlick was the crew chief for the first-ever National League Championship Series. In 1970, he umpired the final game at Forbes Field, as well as the first game at Riverfront Stadium.

In 1971, Barlick was awarded the Umpire of the Year Award at the Al Somers Umpire School, which was based on a poll of other MLB umpires. He stated that the award was &quot;very special,&quot; and that it was &quot;a true, honorable, sincere award because it is given to an umpire by umpires.&quot; The 1971 season was Barlick&#x27;s final year of umpiring, and he skipped the final series of the season at the advice of his fellow umpires. Barlick retired with seven All-Star Game appearances (1942, 1949, 1952, 1955, 1959, 1966, 1970), as well as seven World Series (1946, 1950, 1951, 1954, 1958, 1962, 1967).

Barlick had been known for his very loud calls behind home plate. Subsequent MLB officials, including Dusty Boggess and Dutch Rennert, said that they tried to imitate him when they became umpires.

===Supervisor and scout===
After retiring from umpiring, Barlick was hired by the league to supervise and scout umpires, a job he held for 22 years. Barlick scouted many umpires who wound up having long careers, and was, according to Bruce Froemming, “very proud of the staff he built.” Sportswriter Jerome Holtzman wrote that Barlick was outspoken when defending the league&#x27;s umpires to NL president Warren Giles and baseball commissioner Ford Frick. When the umpires went on strike at the conclusion of the 1984 regular season, Barlick and fellow supervisor Ed Vargo were located in the dugouts during the playoffs to assist the replacement umpires with questions over rules.

==Later life==
In 1989, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee. Manager Leo Durocher and umpire Bill McGowan were also considered by the committee that year, but the group could only vote in one non-player per year. Barlick had been under consideration by the committee for several years before his election. In his induction speech, Barlick said, &quot;My dreams are fulfilled far beyond my expectations.&quot;

Barlick wore uniform number 1 when the NL adopted them for its umpires in 1970; however, the league retired number 3 in Barlick&#x27;s honor after his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989.

On December 27, 1995, Barlick collapsed at his home. He was taken to Memorial Medical Center in Springfield, where he died. A wife, Jennie, and two children survived him. Barlick was cremated.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Barlick as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Coast Guard during World War II.

<doc id="876197" wikidata="Q676620" url="?curid=876197" title="Autopsy (band)">
<text>Autopsy is an American death metal band formed in Contra Costa County, California, in 1987 by Chris Reifert and Eric Cutler. The group disbanded in 1995 and reunited in 2009. The band&#x27;s hometown is in Concord, California.

==History==
===Initial career===
Autopsy was formed in August 1987 by Chris Reifert and Eric Cutler, shortly after Reifert&#x27;s departure from Death. The band recorded a demo that year, &quot;Demo &#x27;87&quot;, before Danny Coralles joined in 1988 immediately prior to the recording of their second demo, &quot;Critical Madness&quot;, and along with Reifert and Cutler, would be a constant in the band&#x27;s lineup. The band signed to Peaceville Records and released their debut album, &quot;Severed Survival&quot; in 1989. These early recordings featured a pioneering death metal style that adopted a slower, doom metal influenced sound. The next full-length, &quot;Mental Funeral&quot;, continued in this style and has since been cited by many other death metal musicians as particularly influential. Having completed a successful European tour soon after &quot;Mental Funeral&quot;, the band reentered the studio to record the &quot;Fiend for Blood&quot; EP, which was followed by their third full-length, &quot;Acts of the Unspeakable&quot;, which featured shorter songs and a more grindcore influenced sound. A difficult US tour in 1993 led to the decision to disband Autopsy after the recording of a final album. &quot;Shitfun&quot;, released in early 1995, was heavily influenced by hardcore punk and would prepare fans for Abscess, previously a side-project of Danny Coralles and Chris Reifert, which would become their main band after Autopsy&#x27;s demise.

Autopsy was featured in the 2005 music documentary &quot;&quot; when the film&#x27;s narrator and star, Sam Dunn read aloud a verse from the band&#x27;s song &quot;Charred Remains&quot;.

===Reunion===
After several years of speculation regarding an Autopsy reunion, and denial of the possibility, the band members briefly reunited in September 2008 to record two new tracks for the special edition of their 1989 debut &quot;Severed Survival&quot;. They later reconvened to the Maryland Deathfest in 2009. After Abscess broke up in June 2010, Autopsy immediately announced that they had permanently reunited. They released &quot;The Tomb Within&quot; EP in September 2010, &quot;Macabre Eternal&quot; in 2011, &quot;Born Undead&quot; DVD in 2012, &quot;The Headless Ritual&quot; in 2013 and &quot;Tourniquets, Hacksaws and Graves&quot; in 2014. Autopsy released the EP &quot;Skullgrinder&quot; on November 27, 2015. They released the EP &quot;Puncturing the Grotesque&quot; on December 15, 2017.

In December 2021, the band announced they were working on a new album, which was tentatively due for release in 2022. On July 27, 2022, the band revealed their new album, &quot;Morbidity Triumphant&quot;, would be released on September 30. On August 31, 2023, the band announced their ninth studio album, &quot;Ashes, Organs, Blood and Crypts&quot;, would be released on October 27.

==Musical style and influences==
Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic categorized Autopsy as a death metal band with &quot;grindcore tendencies&quot;, and described their sound as a &quot;&quot; fusion of thrash, doom and death metal. Autopsy&#x27;s music alternates between rapid and slow passages, breaking from typical death metal fashion of the time of the genre&#x27;s infancy. According to Chris Krovatin of Kerrang, &quot;The band’s constant swing between noisy traditional racket and dissonant doom moved away from metal&#x27;s beats-per-minute arms race and reveled in the bodily weirdness that was at the heart of the genre&#x27;s growth throughout the ’90s.&quot;

Chris Reifert&#x27;s drumming has been called &quot;clunky&quot; and has been compared to &quot;the sound of a garbage bag hitting the side of a dumpster&quot;. As a vocalist, Reifert uses both screams and death growls in the band&#x27;s music.

Autopsy has cited Trouble and Saint Vitus as early influences. The band also draws influence from punk rock, and is known for the &quot;brutal simplicity&quot; of its rhythm section.

The members of Autopsy are film fans, particularly &quot;anything dark and gory&quot;, and hence, the band&#x27;s lyrics draw on horror and slasher film-style violence. Guitarist Eric Cutler said the band&#x27;s sound is &quot;like a soundtrack for a horror movie&quot;. Chris Reifert recalled, &quot;We would go to the video store and rent the goriest movies we could find and watch them over and over, rewinding the gore scenes several times in a row, cackling like maniacs. So, we couldn’t help but be influenced by them.&quot; Examples of films that have influenced the band&#x27;s lyrics include &quot;Truth or Dare&quot;, &quot;Gates of Hell&quot;, &quot;Rawhead Rex&quot;, &quot;Hellraiser&quot;, and &quot;From Beyond.&quot;

==Legacy==
Along with fellow Bay Area band Possessed and Reifert&#x27;s previous group Death, Autopsy have been considered a pioneering band in the death metal genre. Early bands such as Entombed, Dismember, Gorefest, Immolation, Cannibal Corpse and Deicide have all credited Autopsy as an influence in their sound. In addition, Autopsy have helped to pioneer death-doom.

<text>Prins Hendrik Ende Desespereert Nimmer Combinatie Zwolle, commonly known as PEC Zwolle, is a Dutch professional football club based in Zwolle, Netherlands. They play in the Eredivisie, the top tier of Dutch football. They have played in the Eredivisie for a total of 22 seasons, reaching sixth place in 2015. They won the KNVB Cup in 2014 and also reached the final in 1928, 1977 and 2015.

This is the second incarnation of the club; its predecessor of the same name went bankrupt in 1990. The current club was founded immediately afterwards as FC Zwolle before renaming back to PEC Zwolle in 2012.

==History==
===Introduction===
PEC was founded on 12 June 1910, the name being an abbreviation of PH EDN Combinatie (PH EDN Combination). The club was formed by a merger of Prins Hendrik (1 April 1906; Prince Henry) and Ende Desespereert Nimmer (1904; And Never Despair). PEC has been a professional football club since 23 February 1955. The club name was changed to PEC Zwolle in 1971 and to PEC Zwolle &#x27;82 in 1982. Instantly after the bankruptcy a new name was chosen for the new club: FC Zwolle. On 14 April 2012, after the promotion, the club name was changed back to PEC Zwolle.

===PEC===
PEC was one of Zwolle&#x27;s three top football clubs, along with ZAC (founded in 1893) and Zwolsche Boys (1918). ZAC was associated with the local high society, Zwolsche Boys were associated with the working class, while PEC was the club of the local middle class. There was considerable rivalry between these three clubs, especially between Zwolsche Boys and PEC. Not only were their stadiums within walking distance from each other, the clubs frequently met each other in league matches.

===PEC Zwolle===
Despite this rivalry, PEC and Zwolsche Boys merged in 1969, taking the name PEC. In 1971, this became PEC Zwolle, in an attempt to promote the image of the city of Zwolle. In 1977, PEC Zwolle reached the finals of the KNVB Cup, losing to Twente in extra time, and missed out on promotion to the Eredivisie by one point. In 1978, the club won the Dutch first division title and was promoted to the Eredivisie for the first time in its history. In its first season in the Eredivisie, the club finished eighth, which remained PEC Zwolle&#x27;s highest ever league position until finishing sixth in 2014–15. Their most impressive result that season was a 0–1 away victory at PSV. These results were achieved by a talented group of players bought from other clubs, such as Rinus Israël. The money for this came from the Slavenburg&#x27;s bank, which was led by FC Zwolle chairman Jan Willem van der Wal. By 1982, the club had built up a debt of six million guilders and was on the verge of bankruptcy.

===PEC Zwolle &#x27;82===
Real estate developer Marten Eibrink took over power in PEC Zwolle in 1982. He managed to end the debt and restructured the club, which was epitomized by a change in the name: PEC Zwolle &#x27;82. He also had the club&#x27;s stadium renovated and decided to name the stadium&#x27;s main stand the Johan Cruyff Stand, because Johan Cruyff had played his last official match against PEC Zwolle &#x27;82 on 13 May 1984. Eibrink brought legendary players like Piet Schrijvers, Johnny Rep and Cees van Kooten to the club. The club managed to revive, but the revival was short-lived. In 1985, PEC Zwolle &#x27;82 were relegated to the Dutch first division, largely due to an injury-ridden main squad. They managed to return after only one season, having finished in second place. That team was led by the coach Co Adriaanse and the player Foeke Booy. Eibrink, however, grew increasingly disappointed in sponsors and local authorities, accusing them of not loving the club in the way that he did, and he left the club in 1988. Despite a promising start to the 1988–89 season, the club finished in 16th place, which meant that it was relegated to the First Division. The financial crisis worsened, as sponsors refused to invest in the club any longer. The players&#x27; wages could not be paid, and a debt to the Slavenburg&#x27;s bank appeared which had been overseen by the board for around ten years. This led to the club&#x27;s bankruptcy in March 1990.

===FC Zwolle===
After the bankruptcy, it was decided that the club had to sever all ties with the troubled finances of the past and make a fresh start. The club got a new name (FC Zwolle), a new organisational structure, new sponsors, new club colours (blue-white shirts with white shorts instead of green-white shirts with black shorts) and a new crest. The first years of the &#x27;new&#x27; club were hard, but after 1992–93, a new team filled with talents such as Jaap Stam (who would later play for PSV, Manchester United, Lazio, Milan and Ajax), Bert Konterman (Feyenoord and Rangers), Johan Hansma (Heerenveen) and Henri van der Vegt (Udinese) played attractive and successful football. In 1992–93, FC Zwolle narrowly missed promotion to the Eredivisie. In the KNVB Cup, FC Zwolle reached the quarter-finals, losing to Feyenoord in a penalty shootout.

After many failed attempts in the play-offs, FC Zwolle finally managed to secure a return to the Eredivisie by winning the First Division in 2002. In the 2002–03 Eredivisie season, the club finished in 16th place and escaped relegation via the play-offs. A year later, they made a miserable start to the season, and had scored only seven points halfway through the season. An impressive run, with victories over the likes of SC Heerenveen and AZ, proved in vain, as FC Zwolle dropped from a 16th place (which would have placed them in the play-offs) to the 18th place (direct relegation) on the last day of the season. They lost 7–1 away at Feyenoord, while their rivals Vitesse and Volendam managed to beat their opponents Utrecht and RBC Roosendaal.

At the beginning of the 2004–05 season, FC Zwolle was considered one of the favourites for the title in the First Division, along with Sparta Rotterdam. However, it was another club from the province of Overijssel, Heracles Almelo, that won the title. FC Zwolle finished the season in fourth place, and had to play play-off matches against the second- and sixth-placed teams of the First Division (Sparta and Helmond Sport) and the 17th-placed team of the Eredivisie, De Graafschap. They finished bottom of their group, with one point from six matches, while Sparta won the group and clinched promotion and De Graafschap was relegated.

The 2005–06 season started well, with FC Zwolle fighting for the league&#x27;s top spot in the first months. However, the results dwindled in November and December. Angry supporters threatened trainer-coach Hennie Spijkerman after a 0–5 home defeat against Excelsior, and Spijkerman resigned a few days later. The club&#x27;s chairman announced that he would crack down on the supporters involved, and said that some had already received stadium bans of up to 9 years. Spijkerman&#x27;s assistant trainer Harry Sinkgraven finished the season, leading the club to the play-offs, in which Eredivisie side Willem II proved too strong.

Former Feyenoord and Ajax player Jan Everse, who had already trained the club between 1996 and 1999, was presented as the new trainer-coach. He was faced with financial problems at the club, and the departure of key striker Santi Kolk. Many players from the club&#x27;s youth teams were brought into the main squad, with mixed results. The team ended at the ninth place of the table during the 2006–07 season.

During the 2010–11 season, FC Zwolle held the top spot for a long time, but had to leave the title to RKC Waalwijk. Zwolle ended in 2nd place and did not achieve promotion. The 2011–12 season was more successful. FC Zwolle won the title and secured their return to the Eredivisie in the 2012–13 season.

===First trophies and European appearance===

Shortly after winning the championship of the Eerste Divisie, the club announced that the name will be changed to &quot;PEC Zwolle&quot; again.

In 2014, under the guidance of new head coach Ron Jans, PEC Zwolle earned their first major silverware by winning the KNVB Cup, beating league champions Ajax 5–1 in the final. Thus, PEC Zwolle qualified for the UEFA Europa League for the first time. On 3 August 2014, PEC Zwolle also won the 2014 Johan Cruijff Schaal (Dutch Supercup) by defeating AFC Ajax, this time by 1–0.

By winning the KNVB Cup, PEC Zwolle qualified for the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League. In the play-off round, Zwolle played AC Sparta Prague and after a 1–1 draw in Zwolle it lost 3–1 in Prague, losing 2–4 on aggregate.

=== Time during the Eredivisie ===
After winning the KNVB Cup 2014, PEC Zwolle managed to reach the finals again in 2015. This time they played against FC Groningen and lost with 2 - 0.

The years following this, Zwolle was relatively stable. During the year 2017 with the new head coach John van &#x27;t Schip, PEC Zwolle experienced one of the most successful years ever, being third place during the winter break. However, following the winter break, Zwolle experienced the complete opposite of what it had before; it lost all matches and eventually ended at the 9th place in 2018. The season 2018/2019 Zwolle had a very disastrous start. During the winter break of 2018/2019, Zwolle was on struggling to stay in the Eredivise, being on the 15th place. Coach John van &#x27;t Schip was fired after this. During the year 2018, Zwolle got the fewest points in the Eredivisie; 26 points.

New coach Jaap Stam replaced his successor and managed to save Zwolle. He won with 3 - 1 against Feyenoord, 0 - 2 against Heracles Almelo, and 4 - 3 against FC Utrecht. At the end of the season 2018/2019, Zwolle ended at the 13th place, preventing relegation.

The 2 seasons following 2018/2019, PEC Zwolle repeatedly narrowly avoids relegation, ending at the 15th and 13th place. However, during the season 2021/2022, PEC Zwolle had a disastrous season once again. The coach Art Langeler quit and his assistant quit as well. This time, Dick Schreuder was enlisted as head coach to rescue Zwolle from relegation. Despite his initial successes, he failed to prevent relegation and Zwolle ended at the 18th place in 2022, being relegated to the second division in the Netherlands.

===Short and record-breaking return to the Eerste Divisie===
On 3 March 2023, Zwolle gained a 13–0 win over FC Den Bosch in a league game, as the team broke a broad series of records in the process. Firstly, the match became the largest win in the history of the Eerste Divisie, as well as the second largest one in the history of Dutch football (&quot;ex aequo&quot; with Ajax&#x27;s 0–13 away win over VVV-Venlo in October 2020). Secondly, Zwolle became the first Dutch team since August 2002 (Heracles Almelo being the previous record-breaker) to close the first half of an official match with a 7–0 lead. In the same game, Zwolle player Apostolos Vellios scored three goals in almost twelve minutes since the starting kick-off, before netting another one later in the game: as a result, the Greek striker scored the fastest hat-trick in the history of the Dutch second tier. PEC player Lennart Thy claimed the top goalscorer&#x27;s award in the Eerste Divisie for the season, having scored 23 goals in 36 appearances. Zwolle won immediate promotion back to the Eredivisie at the end of the season, finishing second in the league table.

==Stadiums==

===Oosterenkstadion===

The old stadium was built in 1934 and demolished in 2007. It was located at Business park Oosterenk. Since the completion in 1934 two different clubs played in the stadium. &quot;PEC&quot; from 1934 till 1957, Zwolsche Boys from 1957 till 1970. Since 1970 &quot;PEC&quot; played its games at the Oosterenk Stadium. The stadium had to be demolished because the new stadium is located at the same spot as the Oosterenk Stadium is.
===PEC Zwolle Stadion===

Officially since 29 August 2009, the stadium is no longer under construction. Construction started at 9 March 2007. The first game in the new stadium was against MVV. The final score was 0–0. The first goal scored in the new stadium was by FC Zwolle player Bram van Polen, coming on 22 August 2008 against Cambuur.

===IJsseldelta Stadion===
On 12 July 2012, the club officially announced the new name for their home ground, which is now called IJsseldelta Stadion.

=== MAC³PARK stadion ===
The name of the stadium was on 1 July 2016 changed to MAC³PARK stadion.

==Rivalries==

PEC Zwolle&#x27;s biggest rival is Go Ahead Eagles. Both clubs are located at the river IJssel, hence the name &quot;IJsselderby&quot;.

==Domestic results==
Below is a table with FC Zwolle&#x27;s domestic results since the introduction of professional football in 1956.


PEC Zwolle made it to the final round of the national cup four times. They only won in 2014. The first final was in 1928 against Racing Club Heemstede. The final score was 2–0. The second time they made it to the final was in 1977. The opponent that time was FC Twente. They lost 3–0 after extra time. The third time was in 2014, when they beat Ajax 5–1, subsequently claiming the cup for Zwolle for the first time in their history. The last time was in 2015 against FC Groningen. Final score 2–0.

<text> (from , &quot;science or learning&quot;, and &quot;universal&quot;) is a hypothetical universal science modelled on mathematics envisaged by Descartes and Leibniz, among a number of other 16th- and 17th-century philosophers and mathematicians. For Leibniz, it would be supported by a &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot;. John Wallis invokes the name as title in his &quot;Opera Mathematica&quot;, a textbook on arithmetic, algebra, and Cartesian geometry.

== History ==

Descartes&#x27; most explicit description of &quot;mathesis universalis&quot; occurs in &quot;Rule Four&quot; of the &quot;Rules for the Direction of the Mind&quot;, written before 1628. Leibniz attempted to work out the possible connections between mathematical logic, algebra, infinitesimal calculus, combinatorics, and universal characteristics in an incomplete treatise titled &quot;Mathesis Universalis&quot; in 1695.

Predicate logic could be seen as a modern system with some of these &quot;universal&quot; qualities, at least as far as mathematics and computer science are concerned. More generally, &quot;mathesis universalis&quot;, along with perhaps François Viète&#x27;s algebra, represents one of the earliest attempts to construct a formal system.

One of the perhaps most prominent critics of the idea of &quot;mathesis universalis&quot; was Ludwig Wittgenstein and his philosophy of mathematics. As Anthropologist Emily Martin notes: 

== René Descartes ==
In Descartes&#x27; corpus the term &quot;mathesis universalis&quot; appears only in the &quot;Rules for the Direction of the Mind&quot;. In the discussion of &quot;Rule Four&quot;, Descartes&#x27; provides his clearest description of &quot;mathesis universalis&quot;:

== Gottfried Leibniz ==
In his account of &quot;mathesis universalis&quot;, Leibniz proposed a dual method of universal synthesis and analysis for the ascertaining truth, described in &quot;De Synthesi et Analysi universale seu Arte inveniendi et judicandi&quot; (1890).

=== &quot;Ars inveniendi&quot; ===
&quot;Ars inveniendi&quot; (Latin for &quot;art of invention&quot;) is the constituent part of &quot;mathesis universalis&quot; corresponding to the method of synthesis.

=== &quot;Ars combinatoria&quot; ===
Leibniz also identified synthesis with the &quot;ars combinatoria&quot;, viewing it in terms of the recombination of symbols or human thoughts.

=== &quot;Ars judicandi&quot; ===
&quot;Ars judicandi&quot; (Latin for &quot;art of judgement&quot;) is the constituent part of &quot;mathesis universalis&quot; corresponding to the method of analysis.

<text>Tyntesfield ()
is a Victorian Gothic Revival country house and estate near Wraxall, North Somerset, England. The house is a Grade I listed building named after the Tynte baronets, who had owned estates in the area since about 1500. The location was formerly that of a 16th-century hunting lodge, which was used as a farmhouse until the early 19th century. In the 1830s a Georgian mansion was built on the site, which was bought by English businessman William Gibbs, whose huge fortune came from guano used as fertilizer. In the 1860s Gibbs had the house significantly expanded and remodelled; a chapel was added in the 1870s. The Gibbs family owned the house until the death of Richard Gibbs, 2nd Baron Wraxall in 2001.

Tyntesfield was purchased by the National Trust in June 2002, after a fundraising campaign to prevent it being sold to private interests and ensure it would be open to the public. The house was opened to visitors for the first time just 10 weeks after the acquisition, and as more rooms are restored they are added to the tour.

The mansion was visited by 356,766 people in 2019.
==History==

===Background===
The land on which the house and its estate were developed was originally part of the Tynte family estate. The family had lived in the area since the 1500s, but their primary residence was Halswell House in Goathurst, near Bridgwater.

By the late 1700s, John Tynte owned what is now the Tyntesfield estate; at that time the house was approached by an avenue of elm trees, planted after they were bequeathed in the 1678 will of Sir Charles Harbord to the people of Wraxall in memory of two boys he had apprenticed from the village. The Tyntes had originally lived on the estate, but by the early 1800s, John had made Chelvey Court in Brockley his principal residence. Tyntes Place was downgraded to a farmhouse and leased to John Vowles. In 1813, George Penrose Seymour of the adjoining Belmont estate purchased the property and gave it to his son, the Rev. George Turner Seymour. He in turn built a new Georgian mansion on the site of the former Saddler&#x27;s Tenement, and demolished the old farmhouse. Further remodelling was undertaken by Robert Newton of Nailsea.

===Purchase by the Gibbs family===
In 1843, the property was bought by businessman William Gibbs, who made his fortune in the family business, Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons. From 1847 the firm had an effective monopoly in the import and marketing to Europe and North America of guano from Peru as a fertilizer. This was mined by indentured Chinese labour on the Chincha Islands in conditions which the Peruvian government acknowledged in 1856 had degenerated &quot;into a kind of Negro slave trade&quot;. The firm&#x27;s profits from this trade were such that William Gibbs became the richest non-noble man in England.

Throughout his life, William Gibbs and his wife Matilda Blanche Crawley-Boevey (known as Blanche), principally lived in London, for the greater part of his marriage at 16 Hyde Park Gardens, which the family owned until Blanche&#x27;s death. But as he travelled regularly on business to the Port of Bristol he required a residence in the area; thus it was, in 1843, he came to buy Tyntes Place, which he subsequently renamed Tyntesfield. Within a few years of making his purchase, Gibbs began a major programme of rebuilding and enlarging of the mansion.

The architectural style selected for the rebuilding was a loose Gothic combining many forms and reinventions of the medieval style. The choice of Gothic was influenced by William and Blanche Gibb&#x27;s Anglo-Catholic beliefs as followers of the Oxford Movement. This wing of the Anglican Church advocated the view set out in the architect Augustus Pugin&#x27;s 1836 book &quot;Contrasts&quot;, which argued for the revival of the medieval Gothic style, and &quot;a return to the faith and the social structures of the Middle Ages&quot;. The Oxford Movement, of which both Pugin and Gibbs were disciples, later took this philosophy a step further and claimed that the Gothic style was the only architecture suitable for Christian worship. Thus it became a symbolic display of Christian beliefs and lifestyle, and was embraced by devout Victorians such as Gibbs. The completion of the mansion&#x27;s chapel further accentuated the building&#x27;s medieval monastical air so beloved by the Oxford Movement&#x27;s devotees. When completed, the ecclesiastical design was reinforced by a dominating square tower with a steeply pitched roof adorned by four tourelles, which was demolished in 1935.

===Redevelopment===

In 1854 William Gibbs commissioned John Gregory Crace, an interior decorator he was already using elsewhere, to redesign and decorate the principal rooms at Tyntesfield. These new designs included gilded panelling, woodwork, moulding and chimneypieces all in the Gothic style.

Rebuilding work did not begin in earnest until 1863, when William Gibbs had the property substantially remodelled in a Gothic Revival style. William Cubitt &amp; Co. were the builders and John Norton was the architect. Norton&#x27;s design enveloped the original house. He added an extra floor, two new wings and towers. Norton emphasised the importance of architectural continuity in restoration and rebuilding relating to several historical periods. As a result, while some walls remained plain, others were adorned with Gothic and naturalistic carvings to fit in with the previous architectural styles.

====Design====
The house is built of two types of Bath stone, and is highly picturesque, bristling with turrets and possessing an elaborate roof. The combined effect of the architecture and chosen materials has been described by journalist Sir Simon Jenkins as &quot;severe&quot;. During restoration, stonemasons either conserved or, on occasion, copy-carved new sections, carving new mouldings to replace standard architectural elements that formed the weathering, as well as repointing most of the miles of lime pointing. All stone was accurately matched to the original, with Veyzeys quarry near Tetbury providing Cotswold oolitic limestone. The house, which includes the servants&#x27; wing and the chapel, was made a Grade II* listed building in 1973, and has since been upgraded to Grade I.

The front (facing east over the gardens towards Backwell Hill) and north (entrance courtyard) are faced in one shade of ochreous Bath Stone, while the south (rear), which is mainly allocated to the service area and servants quarters, is faced in cheaper red-tinged Draycott marble rubble, and has some plastered finishes. All façades have many Gothic main windows, Tudor oriel windows, chimneys and attic dormers. Norton topped the design with an irregular roof, its various pitches and gables emphasising the building&#x27;s asymmetrical architecture. The final external addition was a huge ironwork conservatory by Hart, Son, Peard and Co. to the rear. The result was described by novelist Charlotte Mary Yonge, a cousin of Blanche Gibbs, as &quot;like a church in spirit&quot;.

The interiors were also in the Gothic style. Crace was again engaged to remodel the interiors, in some places extending or adapting his initial works, in others providing new schemes. Other notable features of the house are glass by James Powell and Harry Ellis Wooldridge, ironwork by Hart, Son, Peard and Co. and mosaics by Salviati. George Plucknett was Cubitt&#x27;s foreman, who was related to James Plunkett of Collier and Plucknett, furniture makers of Warwick. The result was that Gibbs ordered a number of specially commissioned pieces from the firm, including a fully fitted bathroom for his wife. All of these fine pieces of craftsmanship were added to by Gibb&#x27;s expanding collection of artworks.

While the reconstruction on the house was being undertaken, William Gibbs had rented Mamhead Park in Devon. The total cost of redevelopment to create a house with 23 main bedrooms and 47 in total including servants&#x27; accommodation came to £70,000 (equivalent to £ in ). The sum was equivalent to 18 months&#x27; gross profit from all of Gibbs&#x27;s business interests. After completion of the main building works, Gibbs created more cash by selling shares in Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons to his nephew Henry Hucks Gibbs (later Lord Aldenham), which enabled him to purchase two adjoining properties – including Belmont to the east from his nephew George Lewis Monck Gibbs – to create a farming estate, founded on dairy production and forestry management. Added to further by later land purchases, at its peak the Tyntesfield estate spanned over , encompassing of forest, from Portishead in the north to south of the valley in which the main house lay. The house and estate employed more than 500 workers.

===Chapel===

Gibbs&#x27; final addition to Tyntesfield was added between 1872 and 1877, when he commissioned Arthur Blomfield to add a Gothic chapel to the north side of the house. Modelled on the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, it housed an organ by William Hill &amp; Sons, and below a vault in which Gibbs intended to be buried. However, combined opposition from both the vicar of the local All Saints Church, Wraxall and the church&#x27;s patron, a member of the Gorges family, led to the Bishop of Bath and Wells decreeing that he would not sanction the consecration of Tyntesfield&#x27;s chapel, through fears that it would take power away from the local population fully into Gibb&#x27;s hands. Despite this, the chapel formed a central part of life at Tyntesfield, and prayers were said twice-daily by the family and their guests. Throughout their period of residence, the family would also open the chapel to local people on an annual basis, often during Rogation days and at Christmas. In praise of the resultant final building, Yonge described the chapel as the final completion of the Tyntesfield project, providing &quot;a character to the household almost resembling that of Little Gidding&quot;. The Little Gidding community in Huntingdonshire was much idealized by 19th-century Anglo-Catholics.

==Owners==

===William Gibbs: 1846–75===

Seven children were born to William and Matilda. All were devout Anglicans, with William and his wife being supporters of the Oxford Movement. He was a major benefactor of Keble College, Oxford, and dedicated the later part of his life to philanthropic works. Also being teetotal, he added to the estate&#x27;s holding by buying the local Failand Inn, which enabled him to control any riotous behaviour (it was sold to Courage Brewery in 1962 by the 2nd Lord Wraxall). William Gibbs died in the house on 3 April 1875. After a service at the estate chapel on 9 April, 30 estate workers carried his coffin to All Saints Church, Wraxall. He is buried within the family plot in the church grounds.

===Antony Gibbs:1875–1907===
The estate then passed to William&#x27;s eldest son Antony. After graduating with a Master of Arts degree from Exeter College, Oxford, he joined the North Somerset Yeomanry where he attained the rank of Major. He married Janet Louisa Merivale on 22 June 1872, and returned to Tyntesfield to manage the family estate. Antony held various positions of authority, including Justice of the Peace and later Deputy lieutenant of Somerset. The couple had 10 children.

During the 1880s, Antony had Henry Woodyer redesign the hallway staircase. This allowed more light to permeate the lower floors from the glazed lantern roof, and hence turn the hallway into a reception room. Woodyer also extended the Dining Room by taking in part of the original housekeeper&#x27;s room. Crace&#x27;s original wallpaper – a British imitation of Japanese paper, that itself imitated Spanish tooled leather – was lightened by a 14-year-old apprentice who hand-painted in a cream background. The sideboard, which had been commissioned from Collier and Plucknett, was further extended. New items were also ordered from Collier and Plucknett. Simultaneously, Antony had electricity installed, an early UK example of houses being lit in this way. Antony spent the first night after turning on the electrical system watching the main entrance light, to ensure that it did not create a fire and was hence safe for his family. At some point between 1868 and 1884 a water hydraulic lift was installed by Waygood and Co., the remains of which were discovered in 2008. A wooden lift car was discovered on the ground floor and a spanning sheave in the roof space.

===George Abraham Gibbs, 1st Baron Wraxall: 1907–31===

George Abraham Gibbs, 1st Baron Wraxall served as a colonel in the North Somerset Yeomanry and served in the Boer War campaign. On his return to England he married the Hon. Victoria Florence de Burgh Long; the couple moved to Clyst St George in Devon. Between 1918 and 1928, he served as MP for Bristol West and was elevated to the peerage as Baron Wraxall in 1928, for which his appointment as Treasurer of the Household had been instrumental.

Under his ownership, the Drawing Room was redecorated in a Renaissance Revival Venetian style, In the process, Crace&#x27;s stencilling was over painted and then covered by damasked silk, the Norton fireplace was removed, the furniture replaced with Edwardian pieces, and the carpet dyed by Sketchleys. In 1917, to assist the war effort, the ironwork conservatory was razed, and its ironwork melted down for ammunition.

Survived by a daughter, Albina, George&#x27;s first wife died at Tyntesfield from influenza in 1920. In 1927, George married Ursula Mary Lawley, a daughter of Sir Arthur Lawley (later the 6th and last Baron Wenlock). The couple had two sons, George (known as Richard) and Eustace. George died at Tyntesfield on 28 October 1931, aged 58.

===Ursula, Lady Wraxall: 1931–79===

Lord Wraxall&#x27;s widow, Ursula, Lady Wraxall, was left with two children under two years of age, little income, and a large estate. Noted for her efficiency and practicality, when the clock tower, the focal point of the house, needed substantial repairs in 1935 to overcome dry and wet rot, she simply had it disassembled, stored the metal parts for possible later usage and realigned the roof as if the clock tower had never existed.

During the Second World War, Clifton High School was relocated to the property, and in 1941 the U.S. Army Medical Corps established a facility for wounded soldiers, known as the 74th General Hospital, in the estate grounds. The construction of this temporary tented village resulted in the US Army Engineers breaching what was then England&#x27;s longest holly hedge. With many tents later replaced by prefabricated buildings and some nissen huts, at one point in the war following D-Day it became the largest US Army hospital in Europe. During the hostilities, management of the estate&#x27;s farmland was assumed by the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), leaving Lady Wraxall only the Home Farm.

Bombs often landed on the estate during the blitz of Bristol. In September 1940, during a raid on the Bristol Aeroplane Company factory at Filton, bombs cut off the estate&#x27;s water supply, and during a later raid, one bomb badly damaged the lantern roof light over the hallway. In 1946, after the end of the war, Lady Wraxall applied to the Ministry of Defence for a repair grant, but was turned down. As a result, damp, and latterly birds, entered the house through the roof light, until the house came into the ownership of the National Trust and was repaired.

===Richard Gibbs, 2nd Baron Wraxall: 1979–2001===

George Richard Lawley Gibbs, known as Richard, was born on 16 May 1928, and was educated at Eton College and Sandhurst. He spent eight years with the Coldstream Guards. He never married and was succeeded by his brother, Sir Eustace Gibbs, a diplomat, who became the third Baron Wraxall.

Richard died unmarried in 2001 from complications arising from an asthma attack, having reduced his usage of the substantial accommodation within Tyntesfield to just three rooms.

==National Trust purchase==
Concerned with the demolition and desecration of various historic country houses since the end of the Second World War – 450 great houses were completely demolished in England between 1945 and 1955 – in the 1970s the National Trust commissioned architect Mark Girouard to catalogue and assess the remaining Victorian country houses across the United Kingdom for significance and structural integrity. He published his findings in a report, and later in the book &quot;The Victorian Country House&quot;, which in the revised second edition of 1976 included Tyntesfield as allowing access. With the Trust as a result placing Tyntesfield second on its list of priorities for preservation, Girouard said of the property:
In his later life, Richard Gibbs recognised that the diverse interests of the large family, and the need to invest heavily in even basic refurbishment of the house to make it weather-secured and habitable, would require the family to sell Tyntesfield. Recognising also that substantial death duties would become payable on his death, Richard drew up a will based around a trust that would allow his fortune to pass to the surviving children of his brother and half sister, a total of 19 beneficiaries.

When Richard died, the trust he had set up stated that, should the trustees agree by majority that the estate should be sold, such a sale should be completed within 12 months, and to the highest bidder. The house and estate of of farmland, of woodlands, plus 30 houses and cottages, were listed for sale by Savills in three main lots (total estimated at £15 million); with Christie&#x27;s contracted to secure the sale of the house and estate contents via a separate auction (total estimated at a further £15 million).

Having not bought a country house since the 1991 purchase of Chastleton House, which took seven years to open to the public, and competing with no special status amongst the bidders, the rumoured competitors to the Trust were listed by the media to have included composer Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber, and pop stars Madonna and Kylie Minogue. However, the new Director-General of the National Trust, Fiona Reynolds, launched a £35 million appeal in May 2002 via the &quot;Save Tyntesfield&quot; campaign, with support from designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, newsreader Jon Snow and several top architects and historians. The Trust&#x27;s appeal collected £8.2 million in just 100 days, with: £3 million+ from the public; and two substantial anonymous donations of £1 million and £4 million. The Trust also received funding from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, totaling £17.4 million after negotiations with its chair, Liz Forgan, its largest single grant ever which caused some controversy. The National Lottery has earmarked a further £25 million for the major conservation work that is needed.

As a result of the auction, the former &quot;Tyntesfield Estate&quot; no longer exists. The National Trust purchased only the main central part of the Estate which comprises the house, the kitchen garden, and the park. The trust also sold off additional lands. The resultant preserved house and surrounding gardens sat on a total of of land are now simply known as Tyntesfield. Charlton Farm, is now home to Children&#x27;s Hospice South West, which provides palliative care to children with terminal illnesses. Charlton House was sold into private hands, having been since 1927 the home of the Downs School.

===Initial conservation===
After taking ownership in 2002, National Trust staff secured the house and gardens, preserving them and the contents, and then catalogued the contents of the house which had been collected by the four generations of the family. Starting out with a staff of 30 volunteers, by 2013 the total of employed and volunteer staff exceeded 600, more than the number engaged by any other National Trust property.

The initial conservation work focused around weatherproofing the house. The repair of the roof, which is 20 times the size of the average British family&#x27;s home, was made possible by the erection of an extensive free-standing scaffold roof structure. At the height of the restoration works, of scaffolding tubes covered the building&#x27;s entire exterior. This allowed repairs and restoration to take place over 18 months, including the final restoration of the original bold red and black tiled geometric diaper pattern. The entire property was rewired with special cabling, copper sheathed (fire and rodent proofed). Much of the original lead piping was replaced and a fireproofing scheme, mainly through the design of a suitable compartmentation system was designed and implemented. Interior scaffolding was installed in the high hallway to repair the lantern rooflight, and to provide access to other high points of the interior. These initial works cost more than £10 million, much of which was raised through donations via the &quot;Save Tyntesfield&quot; campaign and the sale of lottery tickets to visitors.

The Trust had been reluctant to allow visitors to the house while work was underway, especially taking into account the costs of Health and Safety requirements and the delays these could cause to the essential preservation works. But the need for cash dictated the answer, and the Trust learnt that, through giving the public close access to the preservation works, they actually gave more additional donations as a result of seeing where their money was going and how they were making a difference.

==Estate==
===House interior===

Principal rooms include the Library, Drawing Room, Billiard Room, Dining Room and Chapel. During restoration, the National Trust, for the first time, allowed visitors to become involved in the restoration process and &quot;witness the challenge of bringing Tyntesfield back to life.&quot;

The Library is regarded as the most important gentleman&#x27;s library in the possession of the Trust. The carpet and some of the furnishings in the Library were designed by Crace, whilst the book collection is the most extensive Victorian library collection owned by the Trust.

The centre of the house is occupied by the hallway and staircase, which show the greatest number of changes since the original design.

Once the Trust took ownership, scaffolding was placed in the hallway to repair the roof lantern. While this was in place the architectural paint analyst Lisa Oestreicher was able to examine the decorative scheme that had been used in the spaces and room frequented by the public. Three principal phases were identified: 1860s original; 1870s updates and adaptions; 1887–90 redecoration, which returned the main spaces to the original green colours and motifs created by Crace. Once lantern repairs were complete, the Trust replaced the elderly chenille carpet destroyed by contractors working for Christie&#x27;s with a new Wilton carpet with a replica design by Linney Cooper, bought with £45,000 from public lottery donations.

===Contents===

Christie&#x27;s originally estimated the house contents at in excess of 10,000 items, but by 2008 a total of 30,000 items had been listed including: William Butterfield designed silver; original print books by Pugin and John Ruskin; an unexploded Second World War bomb; a jewel-encrusted chalice; a roll of 19th-century flock wallpaper; and a coconut with carved face and hair. By 2013 the inventory had risen to 47,154 items, with still more rooms to unpack and catalog.

===Paintings===
Many of the family&#x27;s extensive collection of paintings, most sourced from Spain by William, were donated to the Trust. In part this was due to their poor condition, which involved not just water but also ironically guano damage. The most important painting in the collection is the 17th-century work by Alonso de Llera Zambrano of St Lawrence, which hangs in the middle of one of the walls of the hall. It was cleaned and repaired by local art conservators Bush and Berry, who are based in a chapel William Gibbs built in the village of Flax Bourton. In 2011 the Trust bought the painting &quot;The Mater Dolorosa (Mother of Sorrows)&quot; by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo at Christie&#x27;s auction in New York, which had hung at Tyntesfield since William purchased it until some time after 1910.

===Home Farm Visitor Centre===
The Home Farm buildings were built in the 1880s, split over two levels. To the south is a two-storey covered yard with a timber roof structure, used for the rearing of farm animals. On the upper level is the main yard, where to the east and west are two wings, one side of which housed the former piggery. The farm offices make up the north wing, to fully enclose the square but gently south-sloping yard.

The Grade II*listed buildings needed full renovation, which took a secondary priority in the Trust&#x27;s plans after the house. The Trust have converted the buildings into an integrated and self-contained visitor centre, which opened in mid-2011 with:
*Upper yard:
**Demonstration area: country crafts from visiting crafts people
**Plant centre: excess plants raised by the gardeners are sold to raise funds
**Farm-themed play area
**Secondhand books stall: proceeds from which raise funds for the Trust
*Restaurant: the former two-story covered yard has been fully renovated and converted into a cafe/restaurant; it also houses the gift shop. A new-build staircase, lift and bridge walkway all in steel provide access from the upper yard
*A separate building to the east provides power and heat to the visitor centre, using a combination of solar thermal panels, photovoltaic cells and a biomass boiler.

===Park===

The house sits within of parkland, which the Trust gained from the auction and retained around the property to preserve the house within its environment. The wooded park leads down a tree-lined drive to balustraded terraces, and paths lead to the rose garden, summer houses, the aviary and the former concrete-lined lake, which has been empty since the Second World War.
From the latter part of the nineteenth century onwards, William Gibbs and descendants added interesting specimens to the existing trees in the two areas of parkland to the South and West of the house and gardens. The estate now has fourteen Champion Trees on The Tree Register. 

A five-year project by the National Trust, underway in 2022, to conserve ancient, veteran and notable trees, in a number of sites across Bristol, included Tyntesfield. The Tyntesfield site is of additional national significance because its many ancient and veteran trees support populations of rare, vulnerable and endangered invertebrates. 

===Kitchen garden===
The kitchen garden includes glasshouses and frames, the large classical Orangery and quarters for the gardeners.

===Orangery===

The Grade II*listed Orangery was once the architectural focal point of the kitchen garden complex. But when the Trust bought the property, the Orangery was in such a precarious state of deterioration that it was on English Heritage&#x27;s Heritage at Risk Register in the highest priority category, A.

Built in 1897, it is a rare surviving example of a late Victorian orangery in the Classical style, constructed from ashlar and red brick. It has a seven-bay east/west plan with central entrances and three bays north–south, topped by a fully glazed ironwork hipped-roof. An entablature with protruding horizontal geison sits above Ionic half-column supports and corner pilasters. The centre entrance bay on the west front towards the kitchen garden breaks forward as a portico, with pairs of giant engaged columns and broken pediment with a small oculus. Between each pair of columns are large round-headed windows with Gibbs surrounds and keystones.

To preserve and restore the Orangery, the Trust teamed-up with City of Bath College and Nimbus Conservation Ltd in an innovative partnership, whereby 12 trainee stonemasons worked alongside professional craftsmen to hone their skills and carry out the specialist stonework needed. The Trust also introduced workshops for other restoration professionals, academics and eventually opened them to interested members of the public, where all were educated in a hands-on environment in the skills required to repair the building. For this crafts-based training initiative, in 2011 the Trust won a &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; sponsored English Heritage Angel Award.

The budget for the works was £420,000, with initial work focused on stabilising the foundations and lower masonry. Much of this was achieved through the injection of stabilising materials into the foundations, which needed time to cure and solidify. Works then progressed to the walls and roof, and finally the decorative embellishments. Today, while part of the Orangery is a dedicated café, the rest is used for training new craftsmen and restoration specialists.

===Aviary===
The aviary at Tyntesfield is situated to the west of the house, adjacent to the footings of the old conservatory. It was built in 1880 to house exotic birds, but was converted into a playhouse for Doreen, the first Lord Wraxall&#x27;s daughter. The aviary is considered one of the most distinctive features of the estate, and is Grade II listed.

===Sawmill===

Located on a site originally occupied by a foreman&#x27;s office when the land was used for quarrying, the new sawmill building was completed in 1899, providing electricity via two enclosed steam engines and pneumatic power across the estate. The engines were housed in what is now called the Engine Room, while the Lantern Room held multiple lead acid batteries. After opening, the decision was made to relocate the estate&#x27;s entire sawmill to the building, to enable better access to electrical power. The steam engines were replaced by diesel generators, and electricity was provided from the national grid post-WW2. In the 1960s, the sawmill was decommissioned and all wood sold to third party contractors to be converted into sawn wood products.

Under the Trust&#x27;s ownership the sawmill has been renovated and converted into a combined learning, educational and rentable function space for businesses and members of the public. It is most often used by National Trust staff and volunteers to educate visiting school groups. The building now houses the biomass boiler for the main house, which saves 141 tonnes of CO2 a year over the old oil-fired boiler. Another section of the former wood shed was used as a new roost site for bat species, creating a &quot;bat palace&quot;. The centre was opened in May 2009 by Dame Jenny Abramsky, Chair of the Heritage Lottery Fund, who partially funded the works.

===Wildlife===
====Bats====
Ten of the seventeen species of UK bat are found on the property, eight within the structure of the house alone. Species found include the rare and threatened lesser horseshoe bat and greater horseshoe bat. Maintenance work is timed to fit in with hibernating and mating schedules, and new roosts are created during any building work. Visitors may see some of the property&#x27;s bats on a closed-circuit television system.

==Visitor access==
Visitor access to Tyntesfield is via the B3128 road. The nearest train station is away at Nailsea and Backwell. Bus services are available from Bristol. The grounds include six geocaching trails.

==In popular culture==
In 2002, after its purchase by the National Trust but before its opening to the public, the house and its contents were explored in the Oxford Films documentary, &quot;The Lost World of Tyntesfield&quot;, hosted by art historian Dan Cruickshank. The house was featured in the 2017 film &quot;Crooked House&quot;, an adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel of the same name starring Glenn Close, Terence Stamp, Max Irons and Christina Hendricks. It also featured in the BBC television series &quot;Sherlock&quot; in the episode &quot;The Abominable Bride&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the episode &quot;Hide&quot;.

<text>Typical elements of a [[Window manager|[[Window (computing)|window]]]]. The [[window decoration]] is either drawn by the window manager or by the client. The drawing of the content is the task of the client.
A window manager is system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface. Most window managers are designed to help provide a desktop environment. They work in conjunction with the underlying graphical system that provides required functionality—support for graphics hardware, pointing devices, and a keyboard—and are often written and created using a widget toolkit.

Few window managers are designed with a clear distinction between the windowing system and the window manager. Every graphical user interface based on a windows metaphor has some form of window management. In practice, the elements of this functionality vary greatly. Elements usually associated with window managers allow the user to open, close, minimize, maximize, move, resize, and keep track of running windows, including window decorators. Many window managers also come with various utilities and features such as task bars, program launchers, docks to facilitate halving or quartering windows on screen, workspaces for grouping windows, desktop icons, wallpaper, an ability to keep select windows in foreground, the ability to &quot;roll up&quot; windows to show only their title bars, to cascade windows, to stack windows into a grid, to group windows of the same program in the task bar in order to save space, and optional multi-row taskbars.

== History ==
In 1973, the Xerox Alto became the first computer shipped with a working WIMP GUI. It used a stacking window manager that allowed overlapping windows. However, this was so far ahead of its time that its design paradigm would not become widely adopted until more than a decade later. While it is unclear if Microsoft Windows contains designs copied from Apple&#x27;s classic Mac OS, it is clear that neither was the first to produce a GUI using stacking windows. In the early 1980s, the Xerox Star, successor to the Alto, used tiling for most main application windows, and used overlapping only for dialogue boxes, removing most of the need for stacking.

The classic Mac OS was one of the earliest commercially successful examples of a GUI that used a sort of stacking window management via QuickDraw. Its successor, macOS, uses a somewhat more advanced window manager that has supported compositing since Mac OS X 10.0, and was updated in Mac OS X 10.2 to support hardware accelerated compositing via the Quartz Compositor.

GEM 1.1, from Digital Research, was a operating environment that included a stacking window manager, allowing all windows to overlap. It was released in the early 1980s. GEM is famous for having been included as the main GUI used on the Atari ST, which ran Atari TOS, and was also a popular GUI for MS-DOS prior to the widespread use of Microsoft Windows. As a result of a lawsuit by Apple, Digital Research was forced to remove the stacking capabilities in GEM 2.0, making its window manager a tiling window manager.

During the mid-1980s, Amiga OS contained an early example of a compositing window manager called &quot;Intuition&quot; (one of the low-level libraries of AmigaOS, which was present in Amiga system ROMs), capable of recognizing which windows or portions of them were covered, and which windows were in the foreground and fully visible, so it could draw only parts of the screen that required refresh. Additionally, Intuition supported compositing. Applications could first request a region of memory outside the current display region for use as bitmap. The Amiga windowing system would then use a series of bit blits using the system&#x27;s hardware blitter to build a composite of these applications&#x27; bitmaps, along with buttons and sliders, in display memory, without requiring these applications to redraw any of their bitmaps.

In 1988, Presentation Manager became the default shell in OS/2, which, in its first version, only used a command line interface (CLI). IBM and Microsoft designed OS/2 as a successor to DOS and Windows for DOS. After the success of Windows 3.10, however, Microsoft abandoned the project in favor of Windows. After that, the Microsoft project for a future OS/2 version 3 became Windows NT, and IBM made a complete redesign of the shell of OS/2, substituting the Presentation Manager of OS/2 1.x for the object-oriented Workplace Shell that made its debut in OS/2 2.0.

== Examples ==

=== X window managers ===
On systems using the X window system, there is a clear distinction between the window manager and the windowing system. Strictly speaking, an X window manager does not directly interact with video hardware, mice, or keyboards – that is the responsibility of the display server.

Users of the X Window System have the ability to easily use many different window managers – Metacity, used in GNOME 2, and KWin, used in KDE Plasma Workspaces, and many others. Since many window managers are modular, people can use others, such as Compiz (a 3D compositing window manager), which replaces the window manager. Sawfish and awesome on the other hand are extensible window managers offering exacting window control. Components of different window managers can even be mixed and matched; for example, the window decorations from KWin can be used with the desktop and dock components of GNOME.

X window managers also have the ability to re-parent applications, meaning that, while initially all applications are adopted by the root window (essentially the whole screen), an application started within the root window can be adopted by (i.e., put inside of) another window. Window managers under the X window system adopt applications from the root window and re-parent them to apply window decorations (for example, adding a title bar). Re-parenting can also be used to add the contents of one window to another. For example, a flash player application can be re-parented to a browser window, and can appear to the user as supposedly being part of that program. Re-parenting window managers can therefore arrange one or more programs within the same window, and can easily combine tiling and stacking in various ways.

=== Microsoft Windows ===
Microsoft Windows has provided an integrated stacking window manager since Windows 2.0; Windows Vista introduced the compositing Desktop Window Manager (dwm.exe) as an optional hardware-accelerated alternative. In Windows, since GDI is part of the kernel, the role of the window manager is tightly coupled with the kernel&#x27;s graphical subsystems and is largely non-replaceable, although third-party utilities can be used to simulate a tiling window manager on top of such systems. Since Windows 8, the Direct3D-based Desktop Window Manager can no longer be disabled. It can only be restarted with the hotkey combination Ctrl+Shift+Win+B.

Windows Explorer (explorer.exe) is used by default as the &quot;shell&quot; in modern Windows systems to provide a taskbar and file manager, along with many functions of a window manager; aspects of Windows can be modified through the provided configuration utilities, modifying the Windows Registry or with 3rd party tools, such as WindowBlinds or Resource Hacker.

A complete X Windows Server, allowing the use of window managers ported from the unixoid world can also be provided for Microsoft Windows through Cygwin/X even in &quot;multiwindow&quot; mode (and by other X Window System implementations). Thereby, it is easily possible to e.g. have X Window System client programs running either in the same Cygwin environment on the same machine, or on a Linux, BSD Unix etc. system via the network, and only their GUI being displayed and usable on top of the Microsoft Windows environment.

Note that Microsoft and X Window System use different terms to describe similar concepts. For example, there is rarely any mention of the term &quot;window manager&quot; by Microsoft because it is integrated and non-replaceable, and distinct from the &quot;shell&quot;. The Windows Shell is analogous to the desktop environment concept in other graphical user interface systems.

=== ChromeOS ===
Since 2021 ChromeOS is shipped with its own window manager called Ash. Chromium and ash share common codebase. In the past one could run it by using on any compatible systems.

== Types ==
Window managers are often divided into three or more classes, which describe how windows are drawn and updated.

=== Compositing window managers ===
Compositing window managers let all windows be created and drawn separately and then put together and displayed in various 2D and 3D environments. The most advanced compositing window managers allow for a great deal of variety in interface look and feel, and for the presence of advanced 2D and 3D visual effects.

=== Stacking window managers ===
All window managers that have overlapping windows and are not compositing window managers are stacking window managers, although it is possible that not all use the same methods. Stacking window managers allow windows to overlap by drawing background windows first, which is referred to as the painter&#x27;s algorithm. Changes sometimes require that all windows be re-stacked or repainted, which usually involves redrawing every window. However, to bring a background window to the front usually only requires that one window be redrawn, since background windows may have bits of other windows painted over them, effectively erasing the areas that are covered.

=== Tiling window manager ===
Tiling window managers paint all windows on-screen by placing them side by side or above and below each other, so that no window ever covers another. Microsoft Windows 1.0 used tiling, and a variety of tiling window managers for X are available, such as i3, awesome, and dwm.

=== Dynamic window manager ===
Dynamic window managers can dynamically switch between tiling or floating window layout. A variety of dynamic window managers for X are available.

== Features and facilities of window managers ==

;Autohide
: An autohide facility enables menubars to disappear when the pointer is moved away from the edge of the screen.

;Borders
: A border is a window decoration component provided by some window managers, that appears around the active window. Some window managers may also display a border around background windows.

;Context Menu
: Some window managers provide a context menu that appears when an alternative click event is applied to a desktop component.

;Desktop Wallpaper
: Some window managers provide a desktop wallpaper facility that displays a background picture in the root window.

;Focus Stealing
: Focus stealing is a facility some window managers provide. It allows an application not in focus to suddenly gain focus and steal user input intended for the previously focused application.

;Iconification
: An iconification facility lets users minimize running applications to a desktop icon or taskpanel icon.

;Joined Windows
: Some window managers provide a joined windows facility that lets user join application window frames together.

;Keyboard Equivalents
: Some window managers provide keyboard equivalents that enables the keyboard to replicate mouse functionality.

;Menubar
: A menubar provides the facility to launch programs via a menu and may contain additional facilities including a start button, a taskbar, and a system tray.

;Menu Panel
: A menu panel a component of some window managers that provides the facility to launch programs using a menu. A menu panel is similar to a menubar, but appears as a floating panel, rather than a horizontal or vertical bar.
: The menu panel may contain additional facilities including a start button, a task panel, and a system tray.

;Mouse focus
: The mouse focus model determines how the pointing device affects the input focus within the window manager. The focus model determine which component of the graphical user interface is currently selected to receive input as the pointer is moved around the screen.

;Mouse warping
: Mouse warping is a facility that centres the pointer on the current application as it is made active.

;Multiple Desktops
: A window manager may provide a multiple desktops facility. This enables switching between several root window desktops. This prevents clutter of the root window, because applications can run on different desktops.

;Pager
: Some window managers provide a pager tool that provides the facility to switch between multiple desktops. The pager may appear as an onscreen window or as a gadget in the taskbar or taskpanel.

;Plugins
: Some window managers have a modular construction that enables plug-in modules to provide features as required.

;Rollup
: A rollup facility enables windows to appear as just a titlebar on the desktop.

;Root Menu
: Some window managers provide a root menu, which appears when the root window or desktop background is touched.

;Shortcuts
: Some window managers provide a shortcut facility that lets users place icons on the root window that access specific programs or facilities.

;Tabbed Windows
: Some window managers provide a tabbed windows facility that groups applications together in common frames.

;Task Switching
: The window manager may provide various task switching facilities that let the user change the currently focused application, including:

:* Changing the mouse focus using a pointing device
:* Keyboard task switching facilities (for example, by pressing Alt-Tab)
:* Clicking on the task in a taskbar or taskpanel

;Taskbar
: Some window managers provide a taskbar that shows running applications. The taskbar may show all applications that are running including those that have been minimized, and may provide the facility to switch focus between them. The taskbar may be incorporated into a menubar on some window managers.

;Task Panel
: A task panel is similar to a taskbar, but appears as a floating panel, rather than a horizontal or vertical bar.

;Start Button
: A start button is a desktop widget that provides a menu of programs that can be launched. The start button is typically placed on a menubar at the bottom of the screen.

;Notification Area
: A Notification Area is used to display icons for system and program features that have no desktop window. It contains mainly icons to indicate status information and notifications such as arrival of a new mail message. Some systems may also show a clock in the Notification Area.

;Title Bars
: A titlebar is a window decoration component some window managers provide at the top of each window. The titlebar is typically used to display the name of the application, or the name of the open document, and may provide title bar buttons for minimizing, maximizing, closing or rolling up of application windows.

;Title Bar Buttons
: Title bar buttons are included in the titlebar of some window managers, and provide the facility to minimize, maximize, rollup or close application windows. Some window managers may display the titlebar buttons in the taskbar or task panel, rather than in a titlebar.

;Virtual Desktop
: A virtual desktop (also called a scrolling desktop) is a facility some window managers provided that lets the desktop be larger than the actual screen

=== Windows navigation ===
An active window is the currently focused window in the current window manager. Different window managers indicate the currently-active window in different ways and allow the user to switch between windows in different ways. For example, in Microsoft Windows, if both Notepad and Microsoft Paint are open, clicking in the Notepad window will cause that window to become active. In Windows, the active window is indicated by having a different colored title bar. Clicking is not the only way of selecting an active window, however: some window managers (such as FVWM) make the window under the mouse pointer active—simply moving the mouse is sufficient to switch windows; a click is not needed.

Window managers often provide a way to select the active window using the keyboard as an alternative to the mouse. One typical key combination is Alt+Tab, used by Windows and KDE (by default, though this is user-configurable); another is apple key-tilde, used by Macintosh. Pressing the appropriate key combination typically cycles through all visible windows in some order, though other actions are possible.

Many, though not all, window managers provide a region of the screen containing some kind of visual control (often a button) for each window on the screen. Each button typically contains the title of the window and may also contain an icon. This area of the screen generally provides some kind of visual indication of which window is active—for example, the active window&#x27;s button may appear “pushed in”. It is also usually possible to switch the active window by clicking on the appropriate button. In Microsoft Windows, this area of the screen is called the &quot;taskbar&quot;; in Apple Macintosh systems this area of the screen is called the dock.

The active window may not always lie in front of all other windows on the screen. The active window is simply the window to which keys typed on the keyboard are sent; it may be visually obscured by other windows. This is especially true in window managers which do not require a click to change active windows: FVWM, for example, makes active the window 
under the mouse cursor but does not change its Z-order (the order in which windows appear, measured from background to foreground). Instead, it is necessary to click on the border of the window to bring it to the foreground. There are also situations in click-to-focus window managers such as Microsoft Windows where the active window may be obscured; however, this is much less common.

<text>Julius Caesar Burrows (January 9, 1837November 16, 1915) was a U.S. Representative and a U.S. Senator from the state of Michigan.

==Early life and education==
Burrows was born in North East, Pennsylvania, and moved then with his parents to Ashtabula County, Ohio. He attended district school, Kingsville Academy, and Grand River Institute in Austinburg, Ohio. 1853 - 1854 found him teaching at the Madison Seminary. He studied law and was admitted to the bar at Jefferson, Ohio, in 1859. He moved to Richland, Michigan, in 1860. He was principal of the Richland Seminary and commenced the practice of law in nearby Kalamazoo in 1861.

==Military and legal careers==
Burrows raised an infantry company in 1862 to fight in the American Civil War and served as its captain until the fall of 1863. He was elected circuit court commissioner in 1864 and was prosecuting attorney for Kalamazoo County 1866-1870. He declined appointment as supervisor of internal revenue for Michigan and Wisconsin in 1868.

== Political life ==
In 1872, Burrows was elected as a Republican from Michigan&#x27;s 4th congressional district to the U.S. House of Representatives for the 43rd Congress, serving from March 4, 1873, to March 3, 1875. He was chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Navy.

Burrows was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1874, but was subsequently elected to the 46th and 47th Congresses, serving from March 4, 1879, to March 3, 1883. He was chairman of the Committee on Territories in the 47th Congress.

Burrows is sometimes cited as a contributing factor in why New Mexico was delayed in achieving statehood. In an 1876 debate, Burrows, an admired orator, spoke forcefully in favor of a bill intended to protect the civil rights of freed black slaves. Stephen B. Elkins, the New Mexico Territory Delegate to Congress, arrived late, just as Burrows was finishing. Unaware of the full import of Burrows&#x27; speech, Elkins shook his colleague&#x27;s hand in congratulations, a gesture that many southern congressmen interpreted as support for the civil rights legislation. As a result, Elkin&#x27;s handshake with Burrows is blamed for costing New Mexico several Southern Democratic votes which had been needed to achieve statehood. While Colorado achieved statehood in 1876, New Mexico remained a territory for another 36 years.

Burrows was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1882. He won re-election in 1884 to the 49th Congress, and subsequently to the five succeeding Congresses. He represented Michigan&#x27;s 4th district from March 4, 1885, until March 3, 1893, and the 3rd district from March 4, 1893, until his resignation on January 23, 1895, having been elected U.S. Senator. He was chairman of the Committee on Levees and Improvements of Mississippi River in the 51st Congress.

Burrows was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Francis B. Stockbridge and was reelected in 1899 and 1905, serving from January 24, 1895, to March 3, 1911.

He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1910. He was chairman of the Committee on Revision of the Laws of the United States in the 54th through 56th Congresses and of the Committee on Privileges and Elections in the 57th through 61st Congresses. He also served on the Lodge Committee which investigated war crimes in the Philippine–American War. He was on the imperialist faction led by Henry Cabot Lodge in support of the Philippine–American War. He was also a member of the National Monetary Commission and its vice chairman 1908-1912.

After this, Burrows retired from active business pursuits and political life. He died in Kalamazoo and is interred in Mountain Home Cemetery there.

<text>Samuel Shem is the pen name of the American psychiatrist Stephen Joseph Bergman (born 1944). His main works are &quot;The House of God&quot; and &quot;Mount Misery&quot;, both fictional but close-to-real first-hand descriptions of the training of doctors in the United States.

Of Jewish descent, Bergman was a Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College, Oxford in 1966, and was tutored by Denis Noble FRS, cardiac physiologist and later head of the Oxford Cardiac Electrophysiology Group. In an address to Noble&#x27;s retirement party at Balliol, he related that Noble&#x27;s response to Bergman&#x27;s attempt to become a writer was to ply him with copious sherry. He graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Medical School.

He was an intern at Beth Israel Hospital (subsequently renamed Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) ,which inspired the book &quot;The House of God&quot;.

As of 2017, Bergman is a member of the faculty of the New York University School of Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center.

Shem&#x27;s play &quot;Bill W. and Dr. Bob&quot; had an Off Broadway run at New World Stage in New York City. It ran for 132 performances and closed on June 10, 2007. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an insightful new play.&quot;

<doc id="876236" wikidata="Q831533" url="?curid=876236" title="List of men's national association football teams">
<text>This is a list of the men&#x27;s national association football teams in the world. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) is the world&#x27;s most important governing body for association football. A majority of national association football teams in the world are members of FIFA or one of its affiliated continental confederations. A majority of them also represent sovereign states with wide international recognition, with 188 of 195 United Nations (UN) member and observer states holding membership of FIFA. A notable exception is the United Kingdom, which is not a member of FIFA in its own right but is represented in the governing body by the teams of its four constituent countries. Other UN members and one observer state have either held membership in a confederation in the past and subsequently lost it, or have never belonged to either FIFA or one of its recognised confederations.

Membership of FIFA and its confederations also includes national teams representing a few states with limited international recognition, one associated state with no UN membership, a significant number of dependent territories, and a limited number of autonomous areas. A majority of states with limited recognition, however, have no membership of FIFA or any of its confederations.

This list divides national teams into three main groups:

* Teams that are either members of FIFA (211 teams), or have membership in a FIFA-affiliated continental confederation without being members of FIFA itself (11 teams).
* Teams that are not members of FIFA or any continental federation, but which represent UN member and observer states. This group includes four United Nations member states and one observer state (5 teams).
* Teams representing states with limited international recognition and no membership of FIFA or a confederation (6 teams), plus one representing an associated state with no membership of FIFA or a confederation.

This list excludes other teams described by their supporters as &#x27;national&#x27;, which represent specific ethnic groups, cultural/historical regions, separatist or autonomist movements, speakers of specific languages, and micronations. These teams have historically participated in matches and tournaments outside FIFA&#x27;s recognition, though some of them have sporadically or regularly played in friendly matches and tournaments against FIFA members.

Some national teams with FIFA membership have disappeared due to belonging to a sovereign state or dependent territory which split into two or more states or territories (examples include the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, or the Netherlands Antilles), or by part of the territory becoming independent (such as the Ireland national football team, which ceased to exist as such after reaching a compromise with FIFA and recognising the Republic of Ireland national football team as representative of the independent part of Ireland). Other teams have disappeared by virtue of the states or territories they represented forming a new state by joining another entity or entities (examples include the teams representing Tanganyika and Malaya, which merged with other former colonies to respectively form the Tanzania and Malaysia football teams), or becoming part of an already existing state (as is the case with East Germany, which joined West Germany to form the unified Germany football team). In several cases the football records of dissolved teams are considered by FIFA as belonging to a successor entity (the Russia national team, for example, carries over the records of the Soviet Union national team). Defunct teams are listed on this page for historical purposes.

Even if only members of FIFA and its affiliated confederations are taken into account, there are more national association football teams in the world than those of any other sport.

== Members of FIFA affiliated confederations ==
This section lists the current:

* 211 men&#x27;s national football teams affiliated to FIFA, through their national football associations.
* 11 men&#x27;s national football teams who have membership in one of FIFA&#x27;s affiliated continental confederations, but are not members of FIFA.

FIFA members are eligible to enter the FIFA World Cup and matches between them are recognised as official international matches. Based on their match results over the previous four-year period, the FIFA Men&#x27;s World Rankings, published monthly by FIFA, compare the relative strengths of the national teams.

Some national teams that are members of a confederation but not FIFA members compete in confederation-level and subregional tournaments. These teams, however, are not allowed to participate in the World Cup.

The six confederations are:

* Asia – &quot;Asian Football Confederation&quot; (AFC) 
* Africa – &quot;Confederation of African Football&quot; (CAF)
* North and Central America and the Caribbean – &quot;Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football&quot; (CONCACAF)
* South America – &quot;South American Football Confederation&quot; (CONMEBOL)
* Oceania – &quot;Oceania Football Confederation&quot; (OFC)
* Europe – &quot;Union of European Football Associations&quot; (UEFA)

FIFA runs the World Cup as a tournament for national teams to find the world champion. Each confederation also runs its own championship to find the best team from among its members:

*AFC – AFC Asian Cup
*CAF – Africa Cup of Nations
*CONCACAF – CONCACAF Gold Cup
*CONMEBOL – Copa América
*OFC – OFC Men&#x27;s Nations Cup
*UEFA – UEFA European Football Championship

The Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA) organises competitions between Arab League member nations. All 22 national governing bodies that form UAFA are also members of both FIFA and either the AFC or CAF. National teams from UAFA member countries are noted in the list below. The Arab Cup is the top championship tournament for national teams, organised historically by UAFA and by FIFA since 2021.

The Confederation of Independent Football Associations (ConIFA) is an organisation for teams representing unrecognised states, subnational regions, and stateless minorities, as well as teams from recognised states that have not managed to gain entry into FIFA. ConIFA is a successor to the Nouvelle Fédération-Board (N.F.-Board), which also organised tournaments for non-FIFA member teams. While none of the current ConIFA members are also members of FIFA, a few former members simultaneously held associate membership in one of the confederations affiliated with it. These teams are also noted in the list below. The ConIFA World Football Cup is the top tournament for ConIFA member nations.

=== AFC (Asia) ===
Due to the geographical size of Asia, the AFC is subdivided into five sub-federations:

*West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) – represents countries at the western extremity of the continent, except Israel.
*East Asian Football Federation (EAFF) – represents nations in East Asia, plus Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.
*Central Asian Football Association (CAFA) – represents countries in Central Asia, comprising Afghanistan, Iran, Russia and most of Soviet Central Asia, except Kazakhstan.
*South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) – represents countries in South Asia.
*ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) – represents countries in Southeast Asia, plus Australia.

== National teams not affiliated to FIFA confederations ==
The national football teams included in this section are not members of FIFA, or of any of its affiliated continental confederations. The teams are not eligible to enter the FIFA World Cup or any continental confederation championships. FIFA&#x27;s statutes do not allow member teams to compete against these sides without FIFA&#x27;s prior permission. Several national associations for teams included in this section are members of ConIFA; these are indicated in the lists below.

This section lists:
* 5 teams representing sovereign states which are member states of the United Nations or non-member observer states with the United Nations General Assembly.
* 8 teams representing states which are not members of the United Nations.

===Unaffiliated United Nations states===

Three UN members and one UN General Assembly observer state do not have any sort of membership in FIFA or any continental federation, but have fielded national association-organised teams in unofficial friendly matches or in tournaments held outside the auspices of FIFA. Another UN member state, while being officially represented in FIFA and UEFA by the teams of its constituent nations, has also fielded a team representing the entire state in exhibition matches. The national teams of these five states are listed below.
* 
* 1
* 2
* 3
# National governing body was previously a member of the N.F.-Board and ConIFA.
# National governing body has been an associate member of the OFC in the past, but does not currently appear to be part of the confederation. 
# The United Kingdom (UK) is not a member of FIFA or UEFA in its own right, being represented instead by the teams of its four constituent nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales). However, an exhibition UK team has played a small number of friendly matches. The UK has also been represented in the Summer Olympic and Summer Universiade football competitions by its own national teams.
Two UN member states (the Marshall Islands and Nauru), have never fielded a national association-organised football team.

=== Unaffiliated non-UN states ===
Three states with limited international recognition and no UN membership are members of both FIFA and an affiliated confederation: the Republic of China (as Chinese Taipei), Kosovo, and Palestine. The Cook Islands is an associated state with no UN membership, but it is a member of both FIFA and the OFC. The national teams representing these states are all listed above.

A further seven associated, de facto, or partially recognised states with no UN membership have fielded football teams in non-FIFA football tournaments or FIFA-unsanctioned friendly matches. None of these states, however, are currently members of FIFA or any of its affiliated continental confederations. The teams representing these states are listed below.
* Abkhazia1

* 2
* 1,3
* 1
* 1
* 4
* Western Sahara1,3

# National governing body is currently a member of ConIFA.
# National governing body was previously an associate member of the OFC (membership revoked in March 2021).
# National governing body was previously a member of the N.F.-Board.
# National governing body was previously a member of ConIFA (2015-unknown).

===Others===

Many other teams compete in representative football outside of FIFA&#x27;s oversight, and some of these claim &#x27;national&#x27; status. Historically FIFA did not tightly define &quot;country&quot; and as such twenty-three current FIFA members represent subnational and dependent territories, as well as three representing states with limited international recognition. A further nine overseas, dependent, and autonomous territories with close ties to a sovereign state do not have membership in FIFA, but are members of one of its affiliated confederations (either in a full or associate capacity). 
In 2016 however, FIFA made changes to its statutes to define &#x27;country&#x27; as &quot;an independent state recognized by the international community&quot;, which has made membership of FIFA harder for aspirant national teams. Nonetheless, several organisations exist to encourage, facilitate or promote representative football outside of FIFA, and many of their members claim the status of national football teams:
* Confederation of Independent Football Associations (CONIFA)
* International Island Games Association (IIGA)
* Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA)
* Indian Ocean Island Games 
* Pacific Games

== Defunct National football teams ==
These national teams no longer exist due to the dissolution of the nation or territory that they represented. Only teams that held FIFA membership at some point are included on the table.

<text>The House of God is a 1978 satirical novel by Samuel Shem (a pseudonym used by psychiatrist Stephen Bergman). The novel follows a group of medical interns at a fictionalized version of Beth Israel Hospital over the course of a year in the early 1970s, focusing on the psychological harm and dehumanization caused by their residency training. The book, described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as &quot;raunchy, troubling and hilarious&quot;, was viewed as scandalous at the time of its publication, but has since acquired a cult following and is frequently included in the discussion of humanism, ethics, and training in medicine.

==Storyline==

Dr. Roy Basch is an intelligent but naive former Rhodes Scholar and BMS (&quot;Best Medical School&quot;)-educated intern (&#x27;tern&#x27;) working in a hospital called the House of God after having completed his medical studies at BMS. Basch is poorly prepared for the grueling hours and the sudden responsibilities with limited guidance from senior attending physicians. He begins the year on a rotation supervised by an enigmatic and iconoclastic senior resident who goes by the name &quot;The Fat Man&quot;. The Fat Man teaches him that the only way to keep patients in good health and to survive psychologically is to break the rules. The Fat Man provides his interns with wisdom such as his own &quot;Laws of the House of God&quot;. One of his teachings is that in the House of God, most of the diagnostic procedures, treatments, and medications received by the patients known as &quot;gomers&quot; (see Glossary, below) actually harm these patients instead of helping them. Basch becomes convinced of the accuracy of the Fat Man&#x27;s advice and begins to follow it. Because he follows the Fat Man&#x27;s advice and does nothing to the &quot;gomers&quot;, they remain in good health. Therefore, his team is recognized as one of the best in the hospital and he is recognized as an excellent intern by everyone even though he is breaking the rules.

Later, the Fat Man must leave for a rotation with another team. Roy is then supervised by a more conventional resident named Jo who—unlike the Fat Man—follows the rules, but unknowingly hurts the &quot;gomers&quot; by doing so. Basch survives the rotation with Jo by claiming to perform numerous tests and treatments on the &quot;gomers&quot; while doing nothing to treat them. These patients again do well, and Basch&#x27;s reputation as an excellent intern is maintained.

During the course of the novel, working in the hospital takes a psychological toll on Basch. His personality and outlook change, and he has outbursts of temper. He has adulterous trysts with various nurses and social service workers (nicknamed the &quot;Sociable Cervix&quot;), and his relationship with his girlfriend Berry suffers. A colleague, Wayne Potts, commits suicide. Potts had been constantly badgered by the upper hierarchy and haunted by a patient—nicknamed &quot;The Yellow Man&quot; (due to the jaundice from his fulminant necrotic hepatitis)--who goes comatose and eventually (after months) dies possibly because Potts had not put him on steroids. Basch secretly euthanizes a patient called Saul the leukemic tailor, whose illness had gone into remission but was back in the hospital in incredible pain and begging for death. Basch becomes more and more emotionally unstable until his friends force him to attend a mime performance by Marcel Marceau, where he has an experience of catharsis and helps him recover his emotional stability.

By the end of the book, it turns out that the psychiatry resident, Cohen, has inspired most of the year&#x27;s group of interns—as well as two well-spoken policemen, Gilheeney and Quick—to pursue a career in psychiatry. The terrible year convinces most of the interns to receive psychiatric help themselves. The book ends with Basch and Berry vacationing in France before he begins his psychiatry residency, which is how the book begins as well; the entire book is a flashback. But even while vacationing, bad memories of the House of God haunt Basch. Basch is convinced that he could not have gotten through the year without Berry, and he asks her to marry him.

==Laws of the House of God==
;The Fat Man&#x27;s laws
;Roy Basch&#x27;s further laws
==Context and impact==
The book takes place during the Watergate scandal, and follows such events as the resignation of Spiro T. Agnew and Richard Nixon.

A 2019 short essay by Shem and an accompanying online documentary document the origins of the book and the characters upon which it is based. The story is autobiographical, as the BMS is a thinly veiled Harvard Medical School (commonly called HMS), and The House of God represents the Beth Israel Hospital, now a part of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, one of the HMS-affiliated hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts; &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Hospital&quot; (MBH) represents Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).

According to the author, many older physicians were offended by the work.
Many of the terms defined in the book (see glossary) have since become widely known and used in medical culture.

The journal Academic Medicine argued &quot;The House of God&quot; was revolutionary in that it brought to light paradoxical issues of care in modern medicine. Patients (in the book under Putzel) who were not acutely ill could nevertheless be admitted to the hospital and undergo multiple invasive procedures, creating a revenue stream for the hospital but exposing the patient to risk and discomfort, and demoralizing the residents. Reimbursement rules have been changed to prohibit this practice under value-based purchasing (see Pay for performance (healthcare)). JAMA (the Journal of the American Medical Association) has a distinct collection of hundreds of articles titled &quot;Less Is More&quot; that discuss multiple areas of medicine where standard interventions seem to hurt patients. Furthermore, a 2011 essay proposes that the book was an impetus for limiting medical resident work hours.

==Glossary==
===Nouns===
* Gomer: An acronym meaning &quot;get out of my emergency room&quot;. The acronym is used to refer to a patient who is frequently admitted to the hospital with complicated but uninspiring and incurable conditions.
* LOL in NAD: &quot;Little old lady in no apparent distress&quot;. An elderly patient who following a minor fall or illness, would be better served by staying at home with good social support rather than being admitted into a hospital. (Compare &quot;NAD&quot; = &quot;no abnormality detected&quot; or &quot;no apparent distress&quot; (used to record the absence of abnormal signs on examination.)
* Zebra: A very unlikely diagnosis in which a more common disease is a more likely cause of a patient&#x27;s symptoms. The term is derived from the common admonition that &quot;if you hear hoof beats, think horses, not zebras&quot;.

===Verbs===
* Buff the charts: To make a patient look well-treated in the charts or medical records without actually providing any treatment.
* Turf: To find any excuse to refer a patient to a different department or team.
* Bounce: To return a &quot;turfed&quot; patient to the department that referred him or her.

==Cultural references==
===References to life===
In-jokes abound in the work. One of the principal characters is &quot;Eat My Dust&quot; Eddie, a doctor so-called because of the saying ed on his jacket. His name often is abbreviated as EMD, which is also the acronym of the feared, often terminal, cardiac event &quot;electromechanical dissociation&quot; (EMD), otherwise known as pulseless electrical activity (PEA).

===References by other works===
In 1984, &quot;The House of God&quot; was made into a film. The film was never released in theaters or on VHS/DVD, but was shown on HBO multiple times. It starred Charles Haid as The Fat Man, Tim Matheson as Roy, and featured Bess Armstrong, Ossie Davis, Sandra Bernhard, and Michael Richards in supporting roles.

The TV medical sitcom-drama &quot;Scrubs&quot; features numerous references to &quot;The House of God&quot;, which was reading material for some of the show&#x27;s writers. &quot;Turfing&quot;, &quot;Bouncing&quot; and &quot;Gomers&quot; occasionally feature in the show&#x27;s dialogue. In the episode &quot;My Balancing Act&quot;, Dr. Cox uses the term &quot;zebra&quot;. In the episode &quot;My Student&quot;, J.D. quotes the medical student rule: &quot;A famous doctor once said, &#x27;Show me a med student that only triples my work, and I&#x27;ll kiss his feet.&#x27;&quot; One episode focuses on Dr. Dorian saving a patient by &quot;doing nothing,&quot; which is a major theme of the novel.

==Sequel==
Shem has published three sequels to &quot;The House of God&quot;: &quot;Mount Misery&quot;, &quot;Man&#x27;s 4th Best Hospital&quot;, and &quot;Our Hospital&quot;.

<doc id="876244" wikidata="Q2742493" url="?curid=876244" title="Bonda (snack)">
<text>Bonda is a deep-fried South Indian potato snack that has various sweet and savory versions in different regions. The most common is &quot;aloo bonda&quot; (potato &quot;bonda&quot;), and other region-specific variations include potato replaced with sweet potato, tapioca, grated pineapple, green peas, paneer, or other ingredients including rice.

== History ==
A recipe for bonda (as &quot;parika&quot;) is mentioned in &quot;Manasollasa&quot;, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.

==Preparation==
The process of making a spicy bonda involves making a potato filling that is dipped in gram flour batter and deep-fried.

&quot;Bonda&quot; has a sweet and a spicy variant. 

Some regional variants in Kerala replace the potato with tapioca (tapioca &quot;bonda&quot;) or sweet potato and some onion, hard-boiled egg (&quot;mutta Bonda&quot;), masala, minced meat and other ingredients.

In Tamil Nadu, &quot;bonda&quot; is made from black gram (&quot;ulundu&quot;) batter.

In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as &quot;bondalu&quot; or &quot;poornalu&quot;.

Vegetable &quot;bonda&quot; is a dish of Udupi cuisine where fresh green peas and other finely chopped vegetables like French beans, carrots and coriander leaves are used as filling. &quot;Goli baje&quot; (also known as Mangalore &quot;bonda&quot; or Mangalore bajji) is another variant from Karnataka. This &quot;bonda&quot;, however, is made from maida flour (refined flour).

<text>Frontier Flying Service (d/b/a Ravn Connect) was an American airline headquartered in Fairbanks, Alaska, United States. It operated an extensive network of year-round scheduled commuter services and postal services to Alaska bush communities, primarily north of Fairbanks, as well as charter services to the lower 48 and Canada.

Its main base was in Fairbanks (Fairbanks International Airport), with hubs in Utqiagvik (Wiley Post–Will Rogers Memorial Airport), Anchorage (Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport), Kotzebue (Ralph Wien Memorial Airport) and Bethel (Bethel Airport).

==History==
Frontier Flying Service was established in 1950 by retired Air Force Colonel Richard McIntyre, catering to Alaska bush communities as a scheduled mail carrier for Wien Air Alaska, as well as providing charters throughout Alaska. In 1974, Frontier was purchased by John Hajdukovich.

In 2005 the airline merged with Cape Smythe Air Services, taking on their routes and retaining the Frontier Flying Service name.

During the spring of 2008 Frontier Flying Service began the process of merging with Hageland Aviation Services, the companies continue to operate separate certificates with Frontier Flying Service providing service between major hubs and focus communities with the Beech 1900C aircraft while Hagleand Air Service provides point to point service out of the hubs and focus communities to smaller villages, both companies do business under the name &quot;Frontier Alaska&quot; and have begun merging resources and operations at all their shared airports. This merger makes Frontier Alaska the largest commuter passenger carrier in the state of Alaska (by fleet size and number of routes).

On July 8, 2008, Seattle-based Alaska Airlines announced Frontier Flying Service (d.b.a Frontier Alaska) as a new code share partner beginning in the fall of 2008.

On February 27, 2009, Frontier Flying Service&#x27;s holding company, Frontier Alaska, acquired rival Era Aviation of Anchorage, Alaska.

By 2014, with the fleet rationalization and post acquisition of Era Aviation almost complete by the HoTH Airline group, Frontier Flying Service performed the mission of flying cargo and passenger charters for the other Ravn branded companies, Corvus Airlines and Hageland Aviation, but also utilizing the branding of Ravn Connect.

After the bankruptcy of Ravn Alaska the assets were sold &quot;in pieces&quot; to other airlines of Alaska in July 2020.

==Fleet==
The Frontier Flying Service fleet consisted of the following aircraft ():

<doc id="876246" wikidata="Q1240022" url="?curid=876246" title="Donald Kennedy">
<text>Donald Kennedy (August 18, 1931 – April 21, 2020) was an American scientist, public administrator, and academic. He served as Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (1977–1979), President of Stanford University (1980–1992), and Editor-in-Chief of &quot;Science&quot; (2000–2008). Following this, he was named president emeritus of Stanford University; Bing Professor of Environmental Science and Policy, emeritus; and senior fellow of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.

==Early life and education==
Donald Kennedy was born on August 18, 1931, in New York City, the son of Barbara Bean and William Dorsey Kennedy. He attended Dublin School through high school and went on to attend Harvard University, where he received an A.B. degree in 1952, an M.S. degree in 1954, and a Ph.D. in 1956, all in Biology. His doctoral dissertation was titled &quot;Studies on the Frog Electroretinogram&quot;.

==Career==

=== Teacher ===
From 1956 to 1960, Kennedy taught biology at Syracuse University, receiving tenure by 1960. His research included the patterns of neural action in crayfish, demonstrating some of the connection principles among nerve cells that impose the sequences underlying a behavioral event. Kennedy showed that some single neurons, which he termed &quot;command&quot; neurons, could produce a complex, fixed-action pattern of locomotory behavior.

Arriving at Stanford University as an assistant professor in 1960, Kennedy was granted tenure in 1962. In 1967 he was appointed chairman of the Department of Biology in the School of Humanities and Sciences. He was one of the founding faculty in the Program in Human Biology. Kennedy served ten years on the board of directors of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, where he served as director from 1973 to 1977.

=== FDA Commissioner ===
For 26 months he served as Commissioner of the United States Food and Drug Administration during the Carter Administration, appointed by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Joseph Califano, in April 1977. In the next two-plus years Kennedy and the FDA dealt with issues such as the fallout from the attempt to ban saccharin, and the risks of antibiotic resistance in humans from agricultural antibiotic use and worked on provisions of the proposed Drug Regulation Reform Act of 1978.

=== Stanford presidency ===
After stepping down from the FDA in June 1979, Kennedy returned to Stanford, where he served as provost. In 1980 he became president of Stanford University and served in that position until 1992. While president, he inaugurated overseas campuses in Kyoto, Japan, and Oxford, England, the Institute for International Studies, the Stanford Center for the Humanities, the Haas Public Service Center, and the Stanford-in-Washington campus. One of his focuses was on improving the quality of undergraduate education. In the mid-1980s, he led a $1.1 billion fundraising effort to improve the facilities of the university, and the total raised was $1.2 billion. In 1990 Kennedy hosted Mikhail Gorbachev on an international visit to Stanford. In 1990 he received the American Academy of Achievement’s Golden Plate Award at a ceremony in Chicago, Illinois. Over his tenure, Kennedy fostered the growth of the university&#x27;s endowment to $2 billion, which was the fifth-largest in the United States. He also led Stanford to divest all investments in South Africa during apartheid after student protests, and changed the &quot;Western Culture&quot; credit requirements to &quot;Cultures, Ideas, and Values&quot; in an attempt to encompass non-Western cultures.

Kennedy resigned in 1992 following congressional hearings over whether the university improperly billed the government for research expense as part of the Stanford Indirect Costs Controversy, which included billing for widening his bed and for the purchase of antiques for his home. The issue was settled out of court, and led to no charges. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Stanford University and the Navy ... settled [the] fraud case involving research expenses, with the university repaying a small fraction of the Navy&#x27;s original claim and the Navy saying that an investigation had found no wrongdoing by the university.&quot; Following his presidency, Kennedy wrote a memoir entitled &quot;A Place in the Sun: A Memoir&quot;.

=== Later career ===
He remained at Stanford after resigning from the presidency. In 1997 Kennedy published the book &quot;Academic Duty&quot;, which advocated for university professors to pay more attention to the teaching part of their duties, and to make an effort to connect their research with the wider public. From 2000 until 2008, he was editor-in-chief of &quot;Science&quot;, the weekly published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2010, he received Wonderfest&#x27;s Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization. Kennedy was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Academy for the Advancement of Science, the American Philosophical Society, and the California Academy of Sciences. According to his Stanford biography, Kennedy&#x27;s research interests related to &quot;policy on such trans-boundary environmental problems as: major land-use changes; economically-driven alterations in agricultural practice; global climate change; beyond coal; and alternative energy sources&quot;. He was president emeritus of Stanford University, Bing Professor of Environmental Science and Policy, and emeritus and senior fellow of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies by courtesy.

==Personal life and death==
Kennedy&#x27;s first marriage, to Jeanne Dewey, ended in divorce. In 1987, Kennedy married Robin Hamill. Kennedy had two children from his first marriage and two stepchildren with Hamill.

Kennedy had a stroke in 2015 and in 2018 moved to Gordon Manor, a residential care home in Redwood City, California. He died there from COVID-19 on April 21, 2020, at age 88, during the COVID-19 pandemic in California.

<doc id="876251" wikidata="Q1240416" url="?curid=876251" title="Donald Tresidder">
<text>Donald Bertrand Tresidder (April 7, 1894 – January 28, 1948) was the fourth president of Stanford University, serving from 1943 until his sudden death in 1948. He also had a longstanding association with Yosemite National Park.

==Early life==
Donald Bertrand Tresidder was born on April 7, 1894 in Tipton, Indiana. He was the only son of John Treloar Tresidder, a prominent physician who was born in Cornwall, and Sarah Daunt.

==Yosemite==
At the age of 20, Tresidder took a trip with his sister to Southern California, but due to washed-out railroad tracks, they ended up visiting Yosemite Valley instead. During his time there, he had the opportunity to meet several faculty members from Stanford University, who convinced him to enroll at the university.

During his visit to Yosemite, Tresidder also met his future wife, Mary Curry, the daughter of David and Jennie Curry, who were the owners of Camp Curry. Tresidder spent his summers working in Yosemite, taking on various jobs such as a porter, among others. However, he was briefly fired for taking his future wife rock climbing on the backside of Half Dome. Tresidder and Mary Curry got married on June 17, 1920.

After graduating from Stanford, Tresidder became the president of Yosemite Park and Curry Company. During his tenure, he oversaw the construction of new roads, the establishment of the Badger Pass Ski Area, and the Ahwahnee Hotel, which was built in 1927 and is now recognized as a National Historic Landmark.

For many years, Tresidder assumed the role of the Squire at the Bracebridge Dinner, a grand Christmas feast held annually on Christmas Day at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite. His wife, Mary Curry Tresidder, played the role of Lady Bracebridge. In 1929, Tresidder invited photographer Ansel Adams to take over as the director of the Dinner, a responsibility that Adams willingly accepted.

==Stanford==
Tresidder later described himself on arrival at Stanford as an undergraduate: &quot;a gangling youth from the Midwest, wearing a jacket with sleeves too short to cover his long arms, shambling nervously up Palm Drive carrying a battered suitcase. But each student he passed waved and spoke to him cheerfully. At last he encountered President (David Starr) Jordan. The president tipped his broadbrimmed hat, bowed and greeted the young man from Indiana. Tresidder never forgot that welcome.&quot;

He earned his M.D. from Stanford Medical School in San Francisco; however, he never practiced medicine. While attending medical school he was a member of Phi Chi medical fraternity.

While serving as president of the Yosemite concession, he was active as a Stanford supporter, raising funds and serving as co-chair of the 50th anniversary celebration. In 1942 he became president of the Stanford board of trustees. When Stanford president Ray Lyman Wilbur retired, he took over as president.

He served as president of Stanford from 1943 until 1948 and brought the school through the difficult years of World War II. He often said that his main job at Stanford was fundraising for the school. Tresidder set up a professional fundraising organization and streamlined administrative and accounting practices. He established a scholarship program and upgraded the music program to a full department. Tresidder also abolished the sorority system on campus in 1944, after female students voted to support the move, saying there was &quot;serious disunity&quot; between women who pledged sororities and women who lived in dormitories.

Tresidder also helped establish the Stanford Research Institute. The organization&#x27;s first director, William F. Talbot, was initially instructed by Tresidder to avoid work that would conflict with the university&#x27;s interests, particularly federal contracts that might attract political pressure. The drive to find work and the lack of support from Stanford University faculty caused the new research institute to violate this directive six months later through the pursuit of a contract with the Office of Naval Research. As a result, Talbot was fired and replaced by Jesse Hobson, who had previously led the Armour Research Foundation, but the pursuit of contract work remained.

Tresidder died of a heart attack at The St. Regis Hotel in New York City on January 28, 1948, while on University business.

==Recognition==

* Tresidder Peak in Yosemite National Park is named for him. 
* The Tresidder Memorial Union at Stanford University, dedicated in 1962, is named for him.
* The Tresidder Bollards, also at Stanford University, are named for him.
* The Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite has a Mary Curry Tresidder suite and an Underwood/Tresidder suite which incorporates the Tresidder Library.

<doc id="876255" wikidata="Q577001" url="?curid=876255" title="Calculus ratiocinator">
<text>The calculus ratiocinator is a theoretical universal logical calculation framework, a concept described in the writings of Gottfried Leibniz, usually paired with his more frequently mentioned &quot;characteristica universalis&quot;, a universal conceptual language.

== Two views ==
There are two contrasting points of view on what Leibniz meant by &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot;. The first is associated with computer software, the second is associated with computer hardware.

=== Analytic view ===
The received point of view in analytic philosophy and formal logic, is that the &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot; anticipates mathematical logic—an &quot;algebra of logic&quot;. The analytic point of view understands that the &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot; is a formal inference engine or computer program, which can be designed so as to grant primacy to calculations. That logic began with Frege&#x27;s 1879 &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; and C.S. Peirce&#x27;s writings on logic in the 1880s. Frege intended his &quot;concept script&quot; to be a &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot; as well as a &quot;universal characteristics&quot;. That part of formal logic relevant to the &quot;calculus&quot; comes under the heading of proof theory. From this perspective the &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot; is only a part (or a subset) of the &quot;universal characteristics&quot;, and a complete &quot;universal characteristics&quot; includes a &quot;logical calculus&quot;.

=== Synthetic view ===
A contrasting point of view stems from synthetic philosophy and fields such as cybernetics, electronic engineering, and general systems theory. It is little appreciated in analytic philosophy. The synthetic view understands the &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot; as referring to a &quot;calculating machine&quot;. The cybernetician Norbert Wiener considered Leibniz&#x27;s &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot; a forerunner to the modern day digital computer:

Leibniz constructed just such a machine for mathematical calculations, which was also called a &quot;stepped reckoner&quot;. As a computing machine, the ideal &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot; would perform Leibniz&#x27;s integral and differential calculus. In this way the meaning of the word, &quot;ratiocinator&quot; is clarified and can be understood as a mechanical instrument that combines and compares ratios.

Hartley Rogers saw a link between the two, defining the &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot; as &quot;an algorithm which, when applied to the symbols of any formula of the &quot;characteristica universalis&quot;, would determine whether or not that formula were true as a statement of science&quot;.

A classic discussion of the &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot; is that of Louis Couturat, who maintained that the &quot;characteristica universalis&quot; — and thus the &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot; — were inseparable from Leibniz&#x27;s encyclopedic project. Hence the &quot;characteristics&quot;, &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot;, and encyclopedia form three pillars of Leibniz&#x27;s project.

<doc id="876262" wikidata="Q3149921" url="?curid=876262" title="Incivility">
<text>Incivility is a general term for social behaviour lacking in civility or good manners, on a scale from rudeness or lack of respect for elders, to vandalism and hooliganism, through public drunkenness and threatening behaviour. The word &quot;incivility&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;incivilis&quot;, meaning &quot;not of a citizen&quot;.

The distinction between plain rudeness, and perceived incivility as threat, will depend on some notion of civility as structural to society; incivility as anything more ominous than bad manners is therefore dependent on appeal to notions like its antagonism to the complex concepts of civic virtue or civil society. It has become a contemporary political issue in a number of countries.

== Uncivil communication ==
Civil behavior requires that people communicate with respect, restraint, and responsibility, and uncivil communication occurs when people fail to do so. Universal pragmatics, a term coined by Jürgen Habermas, suggests that human conflict arises from miscommunication, so communicative competence is needed to reduce conflict. Communication competence &quot;involves the ability to communicate in such a way that: (1) the truth claim of an utterance is shared by both speaker and hearer; (2) the hearer is led to understand and accept the speaker’s intention; and (3) the speaker adapts to the hearer’s world view.&quot; If people disagree about the truth or appropriateness of their interaction, conflict will occur.

According to Habermas, we should establish communicative norms that lead to rational conversations by creating the social coordination needed for interactants to pursue their goals while recognizing the truth or appropriateness of their interaction. Such norms, or social rules, include: &quot;all participants must be allowed to speak freely, all participants must be allowed to speak for themselves (to enable them to establish their own ethos or &quot;selfhood&quot;), and that communication should be equal, with no one participant commanding more attention from the others than is afforded to them on their turn.&quot;

Some examples of uncivil communication include rude gestures, vulgar language, interrupting, and loudly having private discussions in public spaces. Recent poll data suggests that Americans believe uncivil communication is a serious problem, and believe it has led to an increase in physical violence. The 2013 study on &quot;Civility in America: A Nationwide Survey&quot;, conducted by global public relations firm Weber Shandwick and public affairs firm Powell Tate in partnership with KRC Research found that 70 percent of Americans believe incivility has reached crisis proportions. Of those who expect civility to worsen, 34 percent blame Twitter. The study found that Americans encounter incivility, on average, 17.1 times per week, or 2.4 times per day. Some studies suggest that uncivil communication may have real consequences, including increased health problems due to stress, decreased work productivity, more auto accidents caused by aggressive driving, and vandalism.

== Political incivility ==
Political incivility is different from the everyday incivility described above. According to face negotiation theory, politeness norms require us to avoid challenging others, but political incivility is different because, since it is specific to the political sphere, contestation of views and confrontation are required for a democracy to occur. According to Thomas Benson, &quot;Where there is disagreement, there is a risk of incivility; in many cases, incivility is itself a tactic in political discourse, employed as an indicator of sincerity, as the marker of the high stakes in a disagreement.&quot;

Civil discourse is &quot;the free and respectful exchange of different ideas&quot;. Eight out of 10 Americans believe that the lack of civil discourse in the political system is a serious problem. Eighty-two percent of American respondents to a 2011 survey felt that political advertisements were too &quot;nasty&quot; and 72 percent believed that political commercials that attacked the opponent were &quot;inappropriate&quot;. Research has linked political incivility to reduced trust in the legitimacy of political candidates, political polarization, and policy gridlock. Campaigns and politicians are not the only avenues for incivility, however. The public also participates in civil discourse, and incivility. Incivility in these contexts can lead to the breakdown of political discourse, and exclude certain people or groups from the discussion. If people or groups are systematically excluded from the discussion, the democratic nature of that discussion is called into question.

In his article &quot;The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article (1964)&quot;, Habermas explains that the public sphere is &quot;a realm of our social life in which something approaching public opinion can be formed… Although state authority is so to speak the executor of the political public sphere, it is not a part of it.&quot; Political incivility threatens the features of the rhetorical model of the public sphere, which include:
# It is discourse-based as opposed to class-based.
# Norm of reasonableness, meaning the success of an argument depends on participants agreeing that it makes sense.
# It &quot;emphasizes indeterminate bracketing of discursive exchanges&quot;, meaning the public sphere is made up of many smaller conversations that happen independently of each other.
# Values communication that leads to shared judgments.

Political incivility threatens the future of the rhetorical model of the public sphere because it fractures that sphere into counter-publics, which may or may not interact with each other. According to Papacharissi (2004), &quot;Incivility can then be operationalized as the set of behaviors that threaten democracy, deny people their personal freedoms, and stereotype social groups.&quot;, all of which could result from the violation of the features of the rhetorical model of the public sphere. People or groups may be systematically shut out of the mainstream political discourse, which makes that discourse less democratic, as certain voices are then missing from that discourse. Examples of incivility in political discourse include, but are not limited to, name calling, derisive or disrespectful speech and vulgarity, intentional lies, and misrepresentation. Another type of uncivil behavior is &quot;outrage speech&quot;, which includes name calling, insulting, character assassination, mockery, and emotional displays. There are disagreements among researchers about whether or not emotional speech – using anger, fear, or hatred – should be considered uncivil. Some researchers view some emotional speech as civil unless it threatens democracy in some way, while other researchers view emotional speech itself as a disruption to democracy, and push for a purely rational view of civility.

Stryker et al. assert that &quot;political incivility is usefully distinguished from interpersonal politeness outside of politics.&quot; Their research found consensus among survey respondents concerning the types of political speech and behavior that &quot;count&quot; as &quot;political incivility&quot;. Papacharissi echoes this sentiment, stating that &quot;civility should be redefined as a construct that encompasses, but also goes beyond, politeness.&quot;

==Workplace incivility==

A 2011 report in &quot;USA Today&quot; defined workplace incivility as &quot;a form of organizational deviance... characterized by low-intensity behaviors that violate respectful workplace norms, appearing vague as to intent to harm.&quot; Researchers had announced at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association that &quot;Workplace incivility is on the rise. Uncivil behaviors are characteristically rude and discourteous, displaying a lack of regard for others&quot;, which can lead to distress for those experiencing this treatment. Incivility is distinct from violence. Examples of workplace incivility include insulting comments, denigration of the target&#x27;s work, spreading false rumors, and social isolation. Cortina (2008) conceptualizes incivility that amounts to covert practices of sexism and/or racism in the workplace as selective incivility. For example, Ozturk and Berber (2022) demonstrate significant evidence of subtle racism in UK workplaces, where racialized professionals appear to be the main targets of selective incivility.

==Marketing incivility==
At one time, a number of automotive audio manufacturers engaged in marketing incivility with their products, which included Sony with its &quot;Disturb The Peace&quot; tagline.

An aggregation of academic and community outreach activities, the JHCP aimed at assessing the significance of civility, manners and politeness in contemporary society. The JHCP has been reconstituted as The Civility Initiative at Johns Hopkins, which Dr. Forni now directs. This Web site is designed to introduce Dr. Forni&#x27;s work on civility and to offer links to related material (http://sites.jhu.edu/civility/index.html).
* The Civility Project is a voluntary, grassroots movement of people from diverse backgrounds who agree that, at this critical time in America&#x27;s history, solutions to our most pressing problems will be found only through a more civil exchange of ideas. A web-based organization, CivilityProject.org hopes to promote more civility in public discourse. Mark DeMoss and long-time Clinton advisor Lanny Davis launched The Civility Project (http://www.CivilityProject.org) earlier 2009.
* Choose Civility is an ongoing community-wide initiative, led by Howard County Library, to position Howard County, Maryland as a model of civility. The project intends to enhance respect, empathy, consideration and tolerance in Howard County (http://www.choosecivility.org).
* The National Civility Center is a not-for-profit organization established in 2000 to help people make their communities better places to live. They believe that a comprehensive approach to community improvement—one that engages all local stakeholders around shared ideas and a unified plan for action—can help community members and organizations become more effective at solving tough social issues (http://www.civilitycenter.org).
* The Institute for Civility believes there are two key threats to the effectiveness and efficiency of our governing process today. A nation experiencing both polarization and citizen apathy is a nation at risk. The institute works to reduce polarization in society by focusing on the very public civility (or lack of it!) in the governing process by facilitating dialogue, teaching respect, and building civility (http://www.instituteforcivility.org/ and http://www.civilityblog.org/).
* &quot;The Civility Institute&quot; (http://www.civilityinstitute.com), founded by Dr. Benet Davetian (author of Civility-A Cultural History), conducts research on civility and provides consultations for institutions, schools, corporations. The goal of the institute is to offer beneficiaries with a practical understanding of the social psychology of civility and how civility can be increased without interfering with the mandates of a competitive society.</text><links>

<doc id="876263" wikidata="Q470468" url="?curid=876263" title="Lawrence Krauss">
<text>Lawrence Maxwell Krauss (born May 27, 1954) is a Canadian-American theoretical physicist and cosmologist who taught at Arizona State University (ASU), Yale University, and Case Western Reserve University. He founded ASU&#x27;s Origins Project in 2008 to investigate fundamental questions about the universe and served as the project&#x27;s director.

Krauss is an advocate for public understanding of science, public policy based on sound empirical data, scientific skepticism, and science education. An anti-theist, Krauss seeks to reduce the influence of what he regards as superstition and religious dogma in popular culture. Krauss is the author of several bestselling books, including &quot;The Physics of Star Trek&quot; (1995) and &quot;A Universe from Nothing&quot; (2012), and chaired the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; Board of Sponsors. 

Upon investigating allegations about sexual misconduct by Krauss, ASU determined that Krauss had violated university policy, and did not renew his Origins Project directorship for a third term in July 2018. Krauss retired as a professor at ASU in May 2019, at the end of the following academic year. He currently serves as president of The Origins Project Foundation. Krauss hosts &quot;The Origins Podcast with Lawrence Krauss&quot; and 
publishes a blog titled &quot;Critical Mass&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Krauss was born on May 27, 1954, in New York City, but spent his childhood in Toronto. He was raised in a household that was Jewish but not religious. Krauss received undergraduate degrees in mathematics and physics with first-class honours at Carleton University in Ottawa in 1977, and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1982.

==Career==
After some time in the Harvard Society of Fellows, Krauss became an assistant professor at Yale University in 1985 and associate professor in 1988. He left Yale for Case Western Reserve University in 1993 when he was named the Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics, professor of astronomy, and chairman of the physics department until 2005. In 2006, Krauss led the initiative for the no-confidence vote against Case Western Reserve University&#x27;s president Edward M. Hundert and provost John L. Anderson by the College of Arts and Sciences faculty. On March 2, 2006, both no-confidence votes were carried: 131–44 against Hundert and 97–68 against Anderson.

In August 2008, Krauss joined the faculty at Arizona State University as a foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at the Department of Physics in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. He also became the director of the Origins Project, a university initiative &quot;created to explore humankind&#x27;s most fundamental questions about our origins&quot;. In 2009, he helped inaugurate this initiative at the Origins Symposium, in which eighty scientists participated and three thousand people attended.

Krauss appears in the media both at home and abroad to facilitate public outreach in science. He has also written editorials for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. As a result of his appearance in 2002 before the state school board of Ohio, his opposition to intelligent design has gained national prominence.

Krauss attended and was a speaker at the Beyond Belief symposia in November 2006 and October 2008. He served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama&#x27;s first (2008) presidential campaign and, also in 2008, was named co-president of the board of sponsors of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;. In 2010, he was elected to the board of directors of the Federation of American Scientists, and in June 2011, he joined the professoriate of the New College of the Humanities, a private college in London. In 2013, he accepted a part-time professorship at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics in the physics department of the Australian National University.

Krauss is a critic of string theory, which he discusses in his 2005 book &quot;Hiding in the Mirror&quot;. In his 2012 book &quot;A Universe from Nothing&quot; Krauss says about string theory &quot;we still have no idea if this remarkable theoretical edifice actually has anything to do with the real world&quot;. Released in March 2011, another book titled &quot;Quantum Man: Richard Feynman&#x27;s Life in Science&quot;, while &quot;A Universe from Nothing&quot;with an afterword by Richard Dawkinswas released in January 2012, and became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller within a week. Originally, its foreword was to have been written by Christopher Hitchens, but Hitchens grew too ill to complete it. The paperback version of the book appeared in January 2013 with a new question-and-answer section and a preface integrating the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider. On March 21, 2017, his newest book, &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told—So Far: Why Are We Here?&quot; was released in hardcover, paperback, and audio version.

A July 2012 article in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, written by Krauss, indicates how the Higgs particle is related to our understanding of the Big Bang. He also wrote a longer piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; explaining the science behind and significance of the particle.

In January 2019, Krauss became President of the Origins Project Foundation, a non-profit corporation intended to host public panel discussions on science, culture, and social issues. On June 21, 2019, a new video podcast, &quot;The Origins Podcast with Lawrence Krauss&quot;, launched with Krauss as host. The first episodes included dialogues with Ricky Gervais, Noam Chomsky, and Jenny Boylan.

In 2024, Krauss edited &quot;The War on Science&quot;, a collection of essays from prominent scholars addressing threats to academic freedom and scientific progress. Contributors include Richard Dawkins, Steven Pinker, Jordan Peterson and Alan Sokal. The book was published through the conservative Christian imprint Post Hill Press.

==Scientific work==
Krauss mostly works in theoretical physics and has published research on a variety of topics within that field. In 1995 he proposed that the energy-density of the universe was dominated by the energy of empty space. In 1998 this prediction was confirmed by two observational collaborations and in 2011 the Nobel Prize was awarded for their discovery. Krauss has formulated a model in which the Universe could have potentially come from &quot;nothing&quot;, as outlined in his 2012 book &quot;A Universe from Nothing&quot;. He explains that certain arrangements of relativistic quantum fields might explain the existence of the Universe as we know it while disclaiming that he &quot;has no idea if the notion [of taking quantum mechanics for granted] can be usefully dispensed with&quot;. As his model appears to agree with experimental observations of the Universe (such as its shape and energy density), it is referred to by some as a &quot;plausible hypothesis&quot;. His model has been criticized by cosmologist and theologian George Ellis, who said it &quot;is not tested science&quot; but &quot;philosophical speculation&quot;.

Initially, Krauss was skeptical of the existence of the Higgs boson. However, after it was detected by CERN, he researched the implications of the Higgs field on the nature of dark energy.

==Activism==

Krauss has argued that public policy debates in the United States should have a greater focus on science. He criticized Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson&#x27;s statements on science, writing that Carson&#x27;s remarks &quot;suggest he never learned or chooses to ignore basic, well-tested scientific concepts&quot;.

Krauss has described himself as an antitheist and takes part in public debates on religion. Krauss is featured in the 2013 documentary &quot;The Unbelievers&quot;, in which he and Richard Dawkins travel across the globe speaking publicly about the importance of science and reason as opposed to religion and superstition. He has participated in many debates with religious apologists, including William Lane Craig and John Lennox.

In his book &quot;A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing&quot; (2012), Krauss discusses the premise that something cannot come from nothing, which has often been used as an argument for the existence of a prime mover. He has since argued in a debate with John Ellis and Don Cupitt that the laws of physics allow for the Universe to be created from nothing. &quot;What would be the characteristics of a universe that was created from nothing, just with the laws of physics and without any supernatural shenanigans? The characteristics of the universe would be precisely those of the ones we live in.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, however, he states that he has never claimed that &quot;questions about origins are over&quot;. According to Krauss, &quot;I don&#x27;t ever claim to resolve that infinite regress of why-why-why-why-why; as far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s turtles all the way down&quot;.

==Honors==
In an interview with Krauss in the &quot;Scientific American&quot;, science writer Claudia Dreifus called Krauss &quot;one of the few top physicists who is also known as a public intellectual.&quot; Krauss is one of very few to have received awards from all three major American physics societies: the American Physical Society, the American Association of Physics Teachers, and the American Institute of Physics. In 2012, he was awarded the National Science Board&#x27;s Public Service Medal for his contributions to public education in science and engineering in the United States.

==Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein==
In 2006, Krauss helped to organize a conference on gravity, funded by a foundation of financier and later convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The conference was held on St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Later, while Krauss was the director of the Origins Project, it received $250,000 from an Epstein foundation called &quot;Enhanced Education&quot;. 

Krauss defended Epstein after his 2008 guilty plea of procuring for prostitution a girl below age 18. In 2011, Krauss told an interviewer, &quot;As a scientist I always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I&#x27;ve never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people...I don&#x27;t feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.&quot;

Harvard Professor Steven Pinker said that Krauss was one of several colleagues who invited him to &quot;salons and coffee klatsches&quot; that included Epstein.

==Allegations of sexual misconduct==
In a February 2018 article describing allegations that &quot;range from offensive comments to groping and non-consensual sexual advances&quot;, BuzzFeed reported a variety of sexual misconduct claims against Krauss, including two complaints from his years at Case Western Reserve University. Krauss responded that the article was &quot;slanderous&quot; and &quot;factually incorrect&quot;. In a public statement, he apologized to anyone he made feel intimidated or uncomfortable, but stated that the BuzzFeed article &quot;ignored counter-evidence, distorted the facts and made absurd claims about [him].&quot; Case Western Reserve responded to the student complaint by restricting Krauss&#x27;s access to campus, although by the time the sanctions began he had already left for ASU.

ASU stated that they had not received complaints from faculty, staff, or students before the BuzzFeed article but subsequently began an internal investigation regarding an accusation that Krauss grabbed a woman&#x27;s breast while at a convention in Australia. Investigators interviewed two eyewitnesses, and two other witnesses who immediately spoke with the unnamed woman. The witnesses described the woman as troubled and shocked. The woman told investigators that &quot;she did not feel victimized, felt it was a clumsy interpersonal interaction and thought she had handled it in the moment.&quot; ASU found that the preponderance of evidence suggested that Krauss had violated the university&#x27;s policy against sexual harassment by grabbing a woman&#x27;s breast without her permission. As a result, Krauss was not renewed as director of the Origins Project and the university moved its staff to a project run by planetary scientist Lindy Elkins-Tanton, formally ending the Origins project.

In response to the university determination, Krauss produced a 51-page appeal document responding to the allegations, including a counter-claim that a photo claimed to be of Krauss grabbing a woman&#x27;s breast was actually showing his hand moving away from the woman.

Several organizations also canceled scheduled talks by Krauss. Krauss resigned from the position of chair of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; Board of Sponsors when informed that its other members felt his presence was distracting &quot;from the ability of the Bulletin to effectively carry out [its] work&quot;.

Following the ASU investigation, Krauss was placed on paid administrative leave starting in March of 2018 and was recommended for dismissal by the dean of the department. He later retired from ASU at the end of the 2018–2019 academic year.

Krauss has authored or co-authored more than three hundred scientific studies and review articles on cosmology and theoretical physics.

<text>Norbert Brainin, OBE (12 March 1923 in Vienna – 10 April 2005 in London) was the first violinist of the Amadeus Quartet, one of the world&#x27;s most highly regarded string quartets.

Because of Brainin&#x27;s Jewish origin, he was driven out of Vienna after Hitler&#x27;s Anschluss of 1938, as were Amadeus violinist Siegmund Nissel and violist Peter Schidlof. Brainin and Schidlof met in a British internment camp. Like many Jewish refugees, they had the misfortune of being confined by the British as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; after reaching the UK. Brainin was released after a few months, but Schidlof remained in the camp, where he met Nissel. Finally Schidlof and Nissel were released, and the three were able to study with violin pedagogue Max Rostal, who taught them free of charge. Brainin won the 1946 Carl Flesch International Violin Competition, which Rostal co-founded.

It was through Rostal that they met cellist Martin Lovett, and in 1947 they formed the Brainin Quartet, which was renamed the Amadeus Quartet in 1948. They became one of the most celebrated quartets of the 20th century; its members were awarded numerous honours, including:

* Officer of the Order of the British Empire, presented by the Queen (1960)
* Doctorates from the Universities of London, York, and Caracas
* The highest of all German awards, the Grand Cross of Merit
* The Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art (1974)

The quartet disbanded in 1987 on the death of Schidlof, whom the surviving members considered irreplaceable. Brainin continued to perform as a soloist, often with pianists Günter Ludwig and Maureen Jones. In 1992, he performed a benefit concert in Washington, D.C. for then-jailed presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche.

His instruments included the &quot;Rode&quot; Guarnerius del Gesu of 1734, the &quot;Chaconne&quot; Stradivarius of 1725 and the &quot;Gibson&quot; Stradivarius of 1713.

<doc id="876272" wikidata="Q473367" url="?curid=876272" title="Ammonal">
<text>Ammonal is an explosive made up of ammonium nitrate and aluminium powder. TNT is added to create T-ammonal which improves properties such as brisance. The mixture is often referred to as Tannerite, which is a brand of ammonal. 

The ammonium nitrate functions as an oxidizer and the aluminium as fuel. The use of the relatively cheap ammonium nitrate and aluminium makes it a replacement for pure TNT.

The mixture is affected by humidity because ammonium nitrate is highly hygroscopic. Ammonal&#x27;s ease of detonation depends on fuel and oxidizer ratios, 95:5 ammonium nitrate and aluminium being fairly sensitive, however not very oxygen balanced. Even copper metal traces are known to sensitize bulk amounts of ammonium nitrate and further increase danger of spontaneous detonation during a fire, most likely due to the formation of tetramines. More oxygen balanced mixtures are not easily detonated, requiring a fairly substantial shock, though it remains more sensitive than trinitrotoluene and C-4.

The detonation velocity of ammonal is approximately .

==History==
From early 1916, the British Army employed ammonal for their mines during World War I, starting with the Hawthorn Ridge mine during the Battle of the Somme, and reaching a zenith in the mines in the Battle of Messines which were exploded on 7 June 1917 at the start of the Third Battle of Ypres (also known as the Battle of Passchendaele). Several of the mines in the Battle of Messines contained 30,000 lbs (over 13.6 tonnes) of ammonal, and others contained 20,000 lbs (over 9 tonnes). The joint explosion of the ammonal mines beneath the German lines at Messines created 19 large craters, killing 10,000 German soldiers in one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history. Not all of the mines laid by the British Army at Messines were detonated, however. Two mines were not ignited in 1917 because they had been abandoned before the battle, and four were outside the area of the offensive. On 17 July 1955, a lightning strike set off one of these four latter mines. There were no human casualties, but one cow was killed. Another of the unused mines is believed to have been found in a location beneath a farmhouse, but no attempt has been made to remove it.

Ammonal used for military mining purposes was generally contained within metal cans or rubberised bags to prevent moisture ingress problems. The composition of ammonal used at Messines was 65% ammonium nitrate, 17% aluminium, 15% trinitrotoluene (TNT), and 3% charcoal. Ammonal remains in use as an industrial explosive. Typically, it is used for quarrying or mining purposes.

ETA, a Basque separatist organisation, used 250 kg of ammonal in a car bomb in its attack on the Zaragoza barracks on 11 December 1987 in Zaragoza, Spain.

==Proportions==
A T-ammonal mixture previously used in hand grenades and shells has the proportions (by mass):
* ammonium nitrate 58.6%
* aluminium powder 21%
* charcoal 2.4%
* TNT 18%

<doc id="876280" wikidata="Q868884" url="?curid=876280" title="Constitution Act, 1867">
<text>The Constitution Act, 1867 (), originally enacted as the British North America Act, 1867 (BNA Act), is a major part of the Constitution of Canada. The act created a federal dominion and defines much of the operation of the Government of Canada, including its federal structure, the House of Commons, the Senate, the justice system, and the taxation system. In 1982, with the patriation of the Constitution, the British North America Acts which were originally enacted by the British Parliament, including this Act, were renamed. However, the acts are still known by their original names in records of the United Kingdom. Amendments were also made at this time: section 92A was added, giving provinces greater control over non-renewable natural resources.

The long title is &quot;An Act for the Union of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and the Government Thereof; and for Purposes Connected Therewith.&quot;

==History==
==Preamble and Part I==
The act begins with a preamble declaring that the three provinces New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Province of Canada (which later became Ontario and Quebec) have requested to form &quot;one Dominion...with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom&quot;. This description of the Constitution has proven important in its interpretation. As Peter Hogg wrote in &quot;Constitutional Law of Canada&quot;, some have argued that, since the United Kingdom had some freedom of expression in 1867, the preamble extended this right to Canada even before the enactment of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; in 1982; this was a supposed basis for the Implied Bill of Rights. In &quot;New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia&quot;, the leading Canadian case on parliamentary privilege, the Supreme Court of Canada grounded its 1993 decision on the preamble. Moreover, since the UK had a tradition of judicial independence, the Supreme Court ruled in the &quot;Provincial Judges Reference&quot; of 1997 that the preamble shows judicial independence in Canada is constitutionally guaranteed. Political scientist Rand Dyck criticized the preamble in 2000, saying it was &quot;seriously out of date&quot;. He claimed the act &quot;lacks an inspirational introduction&quot;.

The preamble to the act is not the Constitution of Canada&#x27;s only preamble. The &quot;Charter&quot; also has a preamble.

Part I consists of just one extant section. Section 1 gives the short title of the act as &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. Section 2, repealed in 1893, originally stated that all references to the Queen (then Victoria) equally apply to all her heirs and successors.

==Part II: Union==

The act established the Dominion of Canada by uniting the North American British &quot;Provinces&quot; (colonies) of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. Section 3 established that the union would take effect within six months of passage of the act and Section 4 confirmed &quot;Canada&quot; as the name of the country (and the word &quot;Canada&quot; in the rest of the act refers to the new federation and not the old province).

Section 5 listed the four provinces of the new federation. Those were formed by dividing the former Province of Canada into two: its two subdivisions, Canada West and Canada East, renamed Ontario and Quebec, respectively, become full provinces in Section 6. Section 7 confirmed that the boundaries of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are not changed. And Section 8 provided that a national census of all provinces must be held every ten years.

== Part III: Executive Power ==

Section 9 confirms that all executive authority &quot;of and over Canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen&quot;. In section 10, the Governor General or an administrator of the government, is designated as &quot;carrying on the Government of Canada on behalf and in the Name of the Queen&quot;. Section 11 creates the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. Section 12 states that the statutory powers of the executives of the former provinces of Upper Canada, Lower Canada, Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick continue to exist, until modified by subsequent legislation. To the extent those pre-Confederation statutory powers now came within provincial jurisdiction, they could be exercised by the lieutenant governors of the provinces, either alone or by the advice of the provincial executive councils. To the extent the pre-Confederation statutory powers now came within federal jurisdiction, they could be exercised by the Governor General, either with the advice of the Privy Council or alone. Section 13 defines the Governor General in Council as the governor general acting with the advice of the Privy Council. Section 14 allows the Governor General to appoint deputies to exercise their powers in various parts of Canada. The Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces in Canada continues to be vested in the King under Section 15. Section 16 declares Ottawa to be the seat of government for Canada.

== Part IV: Legislative Power ==

The Parliament of Canada comprises the King and two chambers (the House of Commons of Canada and the Senate of Canada), as created by section 17. Section 18 defines its powers and privileges as being no greater than those of the British parliament. Section 19 states that Parliament&#x27;s first session must begin six months after the passage of the act.

=== Senate ===

The Senate has 105 senators (Section 21), most of whom represent (Section 22) one of four equal divisions: Ontario, Quebec, the Maritime Provinces and the Western Provinces (at the time of the Union, there were 72 senators). Section 23 lays out the qualifications to become a senator. Senators are appointed by the governor general under Section 24 (which until the 1929 judicial decision in &quot;Edwards v Canada (AG)&quot; was interpreted as excluding women), and the first group of senators was proclaimed under section 25. Section 26 allows the Crown to add four or eight senators at a time to the Senate, divided among the divisions, but according to section 27 no more senators can then be appointed until, by death or retirement, the number of senators drops below the regular limit of 24 per division. The maximum number of senators was set at 113, in Section 28. Senators are appointed for life (meaning until age 75 since 1965), under Section 29, though they can resign under Section 30 and can be removed under the terms of section 31, in which case the vacancy can be filled by the governor general (Section 32). Section 33 gives the Senate the power to rule on its own disputes over eligibility and vacancy. The speaker of the Senate is appointed and dismissed by governor general under Section 34. Quorum for the Senate is (initially) set at 15 senators by Section 35, and voting procedures are set by Section 36.

=== House of Commons ===

The composition of the Commons, under Section 37, consists of 308 members: 106 for Ontario, 75 for Quebec, 11 for Nova Scotia, 10 for New Brunswick, 14 for Manitoba, 36 for British Columbia, 4 for Prince Edward Island, 28 for Alberta, 14 for Saskatchewan, 7 for Newfoundland and Labrador, 1 for Yukon, 1 for the Northwest Territories, and 1 for Nunavut. The House is summoned by the governor general under Section 38. Section 39 forbids senators to sit in the Commons. Section 41 divides the provinces in electoral districts and Section 41 continues electoral laws and voting qualifications of the time, subject to revision. Section 44 allows the house to elect its own speaker and allows the House to replace the speaker in the case of death (Section 45) or prolonged absence (47). A speaker is required to preside at all sittings of the House (46). Quorum for the house is set at 20 members, including the speaker by Section 48. Section 49 says that the speaker cannot vote except in the case of a tied vote. The maximum term for a house is five years between elections under Section 50. Section 51 sets out the rules by which Commons seats are to be redistributed following censuses, allowing for more seats to be added by section 52.

=== Money votes and royal assent ===
&quot;Money bills&quot; (dealing with taxes or appropriation of funds) must originate in the Commons under Section 53 and must be proposed by the governor general (i.e. the government) under section 54. Sections 55, 56, and 57 allow the governor general to assent to in the Queen&#x27;s name, withhold assent to or &quot;reserve&quot; for the &quot;signification of the Queen&#x27;s pleasure&quot; any bill passed by both houses. Within two years of the governor general&#x27;s royal assent to a bill, the Queen-in-Council may disallow the act; and within two years of the governor general&#x27;s reservation, the Queen-in-Council may assent to the bill.

== Part V: Provincial Constitutions ==
The basic governing structures of the provinces are laid out in Part V of the act. (Specific mentions are made to the four founding provinces, but the general pattern holds for all the provinces.)

=== Executive power ===
Each province must have a lieutenant governor (Section 58), who serves at the pleasure of the governor general (Section 59), whose salary is paid by the federal parliament (Section 60), and who must swear the oath of allegiance (Section 61). The powers of a lieutenant governor can be substituted for by an administrator of government (Sections 62 and 66). All provinces also have an executive council (Sections 63 and 64). The lieutenant governor can exercise executive power alone or &quot;in council&quot; (Section 65). Section 68 establishes the seats of government of the first four provinces (Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick), but also allows those provinces to change their seats of government.

=== Legislative power ===

==== Ontario and Quebec ====
Sections 69 and 70 establishes the Legislature of Ontario, comprising the lieutenant governor and the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, and Sections 71 to 80 establishes the Parliament of Quebec, which at the time comprised the lieutenant governor, the Legislative Assembly of Quebec (renamed in 1968 to the National Assembly of Quebec), and the Legislative Council of Quebec (since abolished). The legislatures are summoned by the Lieutenant Governors (Section 82). Section 83 prohibits provincial civil servants (excluding cabinet ministers) from sitting in the provincial legislatures. Section 84 allows for existing election laws and voting requirements to continue after the union. Section 85 sets the life of each legislature as no more than four years, with a session at least once every twelve months under Section 86. Section 87 extends the rules regarding speakers, by-elections, quorum, etc., as set for the federal House of Commons to the legislatures of Ontario and Quebec.

==== Nova Scotia and New Brunswick ====
Section 88 simply extends the pre-union constitutions of those provinces into the post-Confederation era.

=== Other ===
Section 90 extends the provisions regarding money votes, royal assent, reservation and disallowance, as established for the federal Parliament to the provincial legislatures but with the governor general in the role of the Queen-in-Council.

== Part VI: Division of Powers ==

The powers of government are divided between the provinces and the federal government and are described in sections 91 to 95 of the act. Sections 91 and 92 are of particular importance, as they enumerate the subjects for which each jurisdiction can enact a law, with section 91 listing matters of federal jurisdiction and section 92 listing matters of provincial jurisdiction. Sections 92A and 93 and 93A are concerned with non-renewable natural resources and education, respectively (both are primarily provincial responsibilities). Section 94 leaves open a possible change to laws regarding property and civil rights, which so far has not been realized. Sections 94A and 95, meanwhile, address matters of shared jurisdiction, namely old age pensions (section 94A) and agriculture and immigration (section 95).

=== Peace, order and good government ===
Section 91 authorizes Parliament to &quot;make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the provinces&quot;. Although the text of the act appears to give Parliament residuary powers to enact laws in any area that has not been allocated to the provincial governments, subsequent Privy Council jurisprudence held that the &quot;peace, order, and good government&quot; power is in a delimited federal competency like those listed under section 91 (see e.g. &quot;AG Canada v AG Ontario (Labour Conventions)&quot;, [1937] AC 326 (PC)).

In 2019, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal sided with the federal government in a 3–2 split on the &quot;Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act&quot;, allowing an expansion of the federal government&#x27;s taxation power over the provinces in the wake of the climate change crisis, concurrently as Parliament joined with other national legislatures in declaring that the nation was in a &quot;climate emergency&quot; on 17 June. In Grant Huscroft&#x27;s dissenting opinion on the Court of Appeal for Ontario, he provides that &quot;counsel for Canada conceded that the act was not passed on the basis that climate change constitutes an emergency&quot;.

=== First Nations, Inuit and Métis ===

Section 91(24) of the act provides that the federal government has the legislative jurisdiction for &quot;Indians and lands reserved for the Indians&quot;. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC), formerly known as Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), has been the main federal organization exercising this authority.

This empowered the Canadian government to act as if the treaties between the Indigenous peoples and the British Crown preceding Confederation did not exist. The Treaty of Niagara of 1764 bound the Crown and the Indigenous peoples of the Great Lakes basin together in a familial relationship, a relationship that exists to this day, exemplified by First Nations attendance at the coronation of King Charles III. Treaty rights would be incorporated into the 1982 Constitution.

=== Criminal law ===

Section 91(27) gives Parliament the power to make law related to the &quot;criminal law, except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction, but including the procedure in criminal matters&quot;. It was on this authority that Parliament enacted and amends the Criminal Code.

However, under section 92(14), the provinces are delegated the power to administer justice, &quot;including the constitution, maintenance, and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and criminal jurisdictions, and including procedure in civil matters in both courts&quot;. This provision allows the provinces to create the courts of criminal jurisdiction and to create provincial police forces such as the OPP and the Sûreté du Québec (SQ).

As a matter of policy dating back to Confederation, the federal government has delegated the prosecutorial function for almost all criminal offences to the provincial Attorneys General. Crown Prosecutors appointed under provincial law thus prosecute almost all Criminal Code offences across Canada.

Section 91(28) gives Parliament exclusive power over &quot;penitentiaries&quot; while section 92(6) gives the provinces powers over the &quot;prisons&quot;. This means that offenders sentenced to two years or more go to federal penitentiaries while those with lighter sentences go to provincial prisons.

=== Property and civil rights ===
Section 92(13) gives the Provinces the exclusive power to make law related to &quot;property and civil rights in the province&quot;. In practice, this power has been read broadly to give the provinces authority over numerous matters such as professional trades, labour relations, and consumer protection.

=== Marriage ===
Section 91(26) gives the federal government power over divorce and marriage. On this basis, Parliament can legislate on the substantive law of marriage and divorce. However, the provinces have power over the procedural law governing the solemnization of marriage (section 92(12)).

There are also several instances of overlap in laws relating to marriage and divorce, which in most cases is solved through interjurisdictional immunity. For instance, the federal &quot;Divorce Act&quot; is valid legislation, even though the &quot;Divorce Act&quot; has some incidental effects on child custody, which is usually considered to be within the provincial jurisdictions of &quot;civil rights&quot; (s. 92(13)) and &quot;matters of a private nature&quot; (s. 92(16)).

=== Works and undertakings ===

Section 92(10) allows the federal government to declare any &quot;works or undertakings&quot; to be of national importance, and thereby remove them from provincial jurisdiction.

=== Education (Sections 93 and 93A) ===

Sections 93 and 93A give the Provincial Provinces power over the competency of education, but there are significant restrictions designed to protect minority religious rights. This is due that it was created during a time when there was a significant controversy between Protestants and Catholics in Canada over whether schools should be parochial or non-denominational. Section 93(2) specifically extends all pre-existing denominational school rights into the post-Confederation era.

=== Section 94 ===
Section 94 allows for the provinces that use the British-derived common law system, in effect all but Quebec, to unify their property and civil rights laws. This power has never been used.

=== Old Age Pensions (Section 94A) ===
Under Section 94A, the federal and provincial governments share power over Old Age Pensions. Either order of government can make laws in this area, but in the case of a conflict, provincial law prevails.

=== Agriculture and Immigration (Section 95) ===

Under Section 95, the federal and provincial governments share power over agriculture and immigration. Either order of government can make laws in this area, but in the case of a conflict, federal law prevails.

== Part VII: Judicature ==
The authority over the judicial system in Canada is divided between Parliament and the provincial Legislatures.

=== Parliament&#x27;s power to create federal courts ===
Section 101 gives Parliament power to create a &quot;general court of appeal for Canada&quot; and &quot;additional Courts for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada&quot;. Parliament has used this power to create the Supreme Court of Canada and lower federal courts. It has created the Supreme Court under both branches of s. 101. The lower federal courts, such as the Federal Court of Appeal, the Federal Court, the Tax Court of Canada and the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada are all created under the second branch, i.e. as &quot;additional Courts for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada&quot;.

=== Provincial power to create courts ===
Section 92(14) gives the provincial legislatures the power over the &quot;Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction&quot;. This power includes the creation of both the superior courts, both of original jurisdiction and appeal, as well as inferior tribunals.

Superior courts are known as &quot;courts of inherent jurisdiction&quot;, as they receive their constitutional authority from historical convention inherited from the United Kingdom.

===Section 96 courts===
Section 96 authorizes the federal government to appoint judges for &quot;the Superior, District, and County Courts in each Province&quot;. No provinces have district or county courts anymore, but all provinces have superior courts. Although the provinces pay for these courts and determine their jurisdiction and procedural rules, the federal government appoints and pays their judges.

Historically, this section has been interpreted as providing superior courts of inherent jurisdiction with the constitutional authority to hear cases. The &quot;section 96 courts&quot; are typically characterized as the &quot;anchor&quot; of the justice system around which the other courts must conform. As their jurisdiction is said to be &quot;inherent&quot;, the courts have the authority to try all matters of law except where the jurisdiction has been taken away by another court. However, courts created by the federal government under section 101 or by the provincial government under 92(14) are generally not allowed to intrude on the core jurisdiction of a section 96 court.

The scope of the core jurisdiction of section 96 courts has been a matter of considerable debate and litigation. When commencing litigation a court&#x27;s jurisdiction may be challenged on the basis that it does not have jurisdiction. The issue is typically whether the statutory court created under section 101 or 92(14) has encroached upon the exclusive jurisdiction of a section 96 court.

To validate the jurisdiction of a federal or provincial tribunal it must satisfy a three-step inquiry first outlined in &quot;Reference Re Residential Tenancies Act (Ontario)&quot;. The tribunal must not touch upon what was historically intended as the jurisdiction of the superior court. The first stage of inquiry considers what matters were typically exclusive to the court at the time of Confederation in 1867. In &quot;Sobeys Stores Ltd. v. Yeomans&quot; (1989) the Supreme Court stated that the &quot;nature of the disputes&quot; historically heard by the superior courts, not just the historical remedies provided, must be read broadly. If the tribunal is found to intrude on the historical jurisdiction of the superior court, the inquiry must turn to the second stage which considers whether the function of the tribunal and whether it operates as an adjudicative body. The final step assesses the context of the tribunal&#x27;s exercise of power and looks to see if there are any further considerations to justify its encroachment upon the superior court&#x27;s jurisdiction.

===Constitutional jurisdiction===
Not all courts and tribunals have jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges. The court, at the very least, must have jurisdiction to apply the law. In &quot;N.S. v. Martin; N.S. v. Laseur&quot; (2003) the Supreme Court re-articulated the test for constitutional jurisdiction from &quot;Cooper v. Canada&quot;. The inquiry must begin by determining whether the enabling legislation gives explicit authority to apply the law. If so, then the court may apply the constitution. The second line of inquiry looks into whether there was implied authority to apply the law. This can be found by examining the text of the act, its context, and the general nature and characteristics of the adjudicative body.

See Section Twenty-four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for the jurisdiction of the &quot;Charter&quot;.

== Part VIII: Revenues; debts, assets; taxation ==

This Part lays out the financial functioning of the government of Canada and the provincial governments. It establishes a fiscal union where the federal government is liable for the debts of the provinces (Sections 111–116). It establishes the tradition of the federal government supporting the provinces through fiscal transfers (Section 119). It creates a customs union which prohibits internal tariffs between the provinces (Sections 121–124). Section 125 prevents one order of government from taxing the lands or assets of the other.

== Part IX: Miscellaneous ==
Section 132 gives the federal Parliament the legislative power to implement treaties entered to by the British government on behalf of the Empire. With the acquisition of full sovereignty by Canada, this provision has limited effect.

Section 133 establishes English and French as the official languages of the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of Quebec. Either language can be used in the federal Parliament and the National Assembly of Quebec. All federal and Quebec laws must be enacted in both languages, and both language versions have equal authority.

== Part X: Admission of Other Colonies ==

Section 146 allows the federal government to negotiate the entry of new provinces into the Union without the need to seek the permission of the existing provinces. Section 147 establishes that Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland would have 4 senators upon joining Confederation.

==Small bill of rights==

The act does not include a written bill of rights and judicial theory on an implied bill of rights did not emerge until the 20th century.
Canadian constitutional scholar Peter Hogg identified several rights provided in various sections of the act that he termed the &quot;small bill of rights&quot;: section 50 limits the duration of a House of Commons of Canada to a maximum of five years; sections 51 and 52 require readjustment of seats in the House of Commons following each census to guarantee proportionate representation of all provinces; section 86 requires Parliament and all legislatures sit at least once per year; section 93 provides, notwithstanding provincial jurisdiction over education in Canada, the right to separate schools for either Protestant or Catholic minorities; section 99 establishes a right for judges to serve during good behaviour unless removed by the governor general under advice from Parliament; section 121 prohibits customs duties and tariffs on inter-provincial trade; section 125 exempts governments in Canada from paying most taxes; and section 133 provides for bilingualism in the legislative and judicial branches of the federal and Quebec governments (see below).

Many of these rights were repeated or expanded in sections 4, 5, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 of the &quot;Charter&quot;. Section 29 of the &quot;Charter&quot; does not repeat or establish new rights for separate schools but reaffirms the right to separate schools provided under the 1867 Act.

===Language rights===
Although the act does not establish English and French as Canada&#x27;s official languages, it does provide some rights for the users of both languages in respect of some institutions of the federal and Quebec governments.

Section 133 allows bilingualism in both the federal Parliament and the Quebec legislature, allows for records to be kept in both languages, and allows bilingualism in federal and Quebec courts. Interpretation of this section has found that this provision requires that all statutes and delegated legislation be in both languages and be of equal force. Likewise, it has been found that the meaning of &quot;courts&quot; in Section 133 includes all federal and provincial courts as well as all tribunals that exercise an adjudicative function.

These rights are duplicated in respect to the federal government, but not Quebec, and extended to New Brunswick, by sections 17, 18 and 19 of the Charter of Rights; Sections 16 and 20 of the Charter elaborate by declaring English and French to be the official languages and allowing for bilingual public services.

==Canada Day==
The anniversary of the act&#x27;s entry into force and creation of the Dominion of Canada on 1 July 1867 is observed annually as Canada Day (known as Dominion Day prior to 1982) and is celebrated as Canada&#x27;s national holiday.

<doc id="876290" wikidata="Q3046143" url="?curid=876290" title="ESPNews">
<text>ESPNews (pronounced &quot;ESPN News,&quot; stylized ESPNEWS) is an American multinational digital cable and satellite television network owned by ESPN Inc., a joint venture between The Walt Disney Company (which owns a controlling 80% stake) and Hearst Communications (which owns the remaining 20%).

Known as &quot;ESPN3&quot; in its planning stages and proposed as early as 1993, the channel launched on November 1, 1996, and originally featured a rolling news format with 24-hour coverage of sports news and highlights. Since 2010, the network has largely shifted away from this format, and now primarily carries television simulcasts of ESPN Radio shows, encores of ESPN&#x27;s weekday lineup of studio programs, and overflow event programming in the event of conflicts with ABC or the other ESPN networks.

, ESPNEWS is available to approximately 36 million pay television households in the United States—down from its 2013 peak of 76 million households.

==Format and programming==
ESPNews is typically offered on the digital tiers of U.S. cable providers, and is carried as a premium channel in some areas, satellite providers offer it on their standard package. Some regional sports networks that are not associated with Fox Sports Networks had previously aired ESPNews during the overnight or morning hours to provide a pseudo-national sportscast to their viewers, and to fill time that would otherwise be taken up by paid programming or other lower-profile programs, though as vertical integration has occurred with the sports networks now owned by Comcast (with NBC Sports) and Charter Communications, ESPNews programming has been dropped from these networks; however, its programming is still carried during the overnight hours on MASN2. If a national ESPN broadcast is blacked out in a particular market, the ESPN broadcast will usually be replaced by ESPNews.

The network was formerly simulcast on ESPN during coverage of major breaking sports news before that network expanded &quot;SportsCenter&quot; into additional daytime slots in 2008, additionally, ABC&#x27;s early morning newscast, &quot;America This Morning,&quot; previously ran a highlights segment rundown featuring sports news headlines and highlights of the previous night&#x27;s sporting events presented by an ESPNews overnight anchor.

The channel&#x27;s BottomLine ticker was formerly more in-depth than the versions used by ESPN&#x27;s other networks. It contained not only scores, but also statistics and brief news alerts about the day&#x27;s sports headlines. However, in June 2010, the network switched to the standard BottomLine and screen presentation used by all other ESPN networks in preparation for the launch of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; broadcasts.

On November 11, 2006, the channel marked its 10-year anniversary, programming commemorating the occasion included a montage of highlights covering the past 10 years in sports. The network began airing &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on nights when sporting event telecasts on ESPN and ESPN2, such as college football or Major League Baseball games, were scheduled to overrun into the program&#x27;s regular timeslots on ESPN and ESPN2&#x27;s own sports analysis programs, which until 2010 would be the only incidences in which &quot;SportsCenter&quot; would be carried over to ESPNews.

XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio both provide channels with audio simulcasts of ESPNEWS, with the network&#x27;s television advertisements replaced with radio ads from each service. On February 4, 2008, XM rebranded its channel as &quot;ESPN Xtra,&quot; and added radio programs from local ESPN Radio affiliates as well as the audio simulcast of ESPNEWS.

In August 2010, telecasts of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on ESPNews increased in frequency, now airing whenever ESPN or ESPN2 were unable to air the program due to scheduling conflicts, along with an afternoon expansion of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; to the channel&#x27;s afternoon schedule rather than rolling &quot;ESPNews&quot;-branded coverage, while ESPN and ESPN2 carry sports talk and debate programming. &quot;The Beat&quot; (a show showing pop culture and sports action to the tune of a beat) was shown while &quot;SportsCenter&quot; aired on ESPN at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time until its cancellation in July 2011, and replacement by a rebroadcast of the ESPN2 sports talk program &quot;SportsNation&quot;. By early 2013, the only other programs featured on ESPNews were &quot;Highlight Express&quot; (a half-hour program showing the previous day&#x27;s sports highlights, running from 10:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time in the afternoon), and the overnight soccer program &quot;ESPNFC Press Pass&quot;. The network also airs programming under the &quot;College Football Live&quot; banner on Saturday afternoons during college football season, a whip-around program similar to ESPN Goal Line, which gives live look-ins to multiple college football games happening simultaneously.

On June 13, 2013, &quot;Highlight Express&quot; was canceled due to low ratings and company-wide downsizing, leaving the overnight &quot;ESPNFC Press Pass&quot;, produced primarily for ESPN International, as the only program on the network that was exclusively broadcast (within the U.S.) on ESPNews, that program was removed from the schedule in August 2013, after it was supplanted by a new ESPN2 program simply titled &quot;ESPN FC&quot;. Additional runs of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and other same-day airings of ESPN sports debate programming or the newsmagazine &quot;&quot; now fill the network&#x27;s schedule, along with encores such as &quot;Friday Night Fights&quot;, as well as programming affected by sports-induced pre-emptions and overruns such as &quot;Olbermann&quot; during the US Open. The highlights and segment package for &quot;America This Morning&quot; came under the purview of the late-night &quot;SportsCenter&quot; team from Los Angeles from that day forward.

On November 29, 2017, as part of an expected announcement of 150 behind the scenes staffs being laid off from the network, ESPN announced that the primetime &quot;SportsCenter&quot; editions carried in primetime on ESPNews would be terminated after November 30, 2017 to cut costs (breaking sports news coverage will be maintained when needed). They were replaced by a block of reruns of ESPN and ESPN2&#x27;s daytime talk programs, including &quot;Around the Horn&quot;, &quot;Highly Questionable&quot;, &quot;Outside the Lines&quot;, &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot;, and &quot;SportsNation&quot;.

In March 2019, ESPNews premiered &quot;Daily Wager&quot;, a new weekday studio show devoted to sports betting. In August 2019, it was announced that &quot;Daily Wager&quot; would move to ESPN2 on August 20, 2019, and that a new L-bar featuring betting lines and other statistics would be displayed on ESPNews during non-event programming, and on ESPN2 during &quot;Daily Wager&quot;. The feature was part of ESPN&#x27;s partnership with Caesars Entertainment.

===Use as an overflow feed for live coverage===
ESPNEWS ran a simulcast of ESPN Radio&#x27;s &quot;Mike and Mike in the Morning&quot; from 2004 to 2005, the program moved to ESPN2 in 2006, although it still occasionally airs on ESPNEWS when live sports events (such as tennis&#x27; French Open or Wimbledon) air on ESPN2. When ESPN2 televised the 2009 US Open tennis tournament, &quot;SportsNation&quot; aired on ESPNEWS instead from August 31, 2009 to September 11, 2009.

As ESPN Classic&#x27;s carriage declined more into specialty cable tiers due to bandwidth conservation concerns and low viewership, along with no high-definition channel ever being established before its demise on December 31, 2021, ESPNEWS became the primary overflow network for situations in which ESPN and ESPN2 carry live sports coverage, with ESPNU, the ACC Network and SEC Network being limited to college sports overflow situations.

* The network aired two National Invitation Tournament college basketball games on March 25, 2013 that were originally scheduled to air on ESPN, which instead aired an NBA game telecast between the Miami Heat and the Orlando Magic (a game in which the Heat extended its winning streak to 27 games).
* Another NBA overflow of the late game of that night&#x27;s ESPN doubleheader aired partially two days later on March 27, 2013 due to ESPN2 already carrying coverage of the 2013 NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament until the first game on ESPN ended, with ESPN having an extended post-game show for the first game due to the Heat&#x27;s aforementioned winning streak ending at the hands of the Chicago Bulls.
* Coverage of the NCAA women&#x27;s softball preliminary tournament aired on ESPNEWS on May 18, 2013, due to NBA playoff coverage on ESPN and X Games Barcelona coverage on ESPN2.
* The network&#x27;s most apparent overflow use has been with the NASCAR Nationwide Series in 2013. On April 26, 2013, ESPNEWS carried full live coverage of the Toyota Care 250 at Richmond International Raceway, due to NBA playoff coverage on ESPN, with the 2013 NFL draft&#x27;s second night airing on ESPN2. The Kentucky 300 on September 21, 2013 from Kentucky Speedway was also moved over to ESPNEWS due to college football games airing on both ESPN networks.
* On August 31, 2013, ESPNEWS aired three college football games, including the Kentucky–Western Kentucky game live from LP Field in Nashville, presumably due to all other ESPN networks being fully booked for college games at that time. ESPN Goal Line also has been expanded onto additional cable systems through new carriage agreements struck by The Walt Disney Company in early 2013, making the Goal Line simulcast unneeded.
* ESPN&#x27;s coverage of Wimbledon was often moved to ESPNews in 2014 due to their coverage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
* ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the Wisconsin v. USC Holiday Bowl was moved to ESPNews in 2015.
* ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the northeast regional NCAA hockey tournament, due to the NCAA Women&#x27;s basketball tournament on ESPN, NCAA baseball and softball on ESPN2 and NCAA lacrosse and other regional games of the NCAA hockey tournament on ESPN-U in 2018.
* Also due to live coverage on ESPN and ESPN2 of the NCAA Women&#x27;s basketball tournament, ESPNews showed the rest of the day&#x27;s Miami Open quarterfinal and semifinal coverage that was shown on ESPN2 before primetime coverage of the basketball tournament.
*&quot;Olbermann&quot; was also carried live on ESPNEWS on weeknights if sports coverage on ESPN2 overflowed into that program&#x27;s regular time slot.
* The network aired game 6 in the first round of the 2018 NBA playoffs on April 27, 2018 between the Toronto Raptors and the Washington Wizards due to ESPN airing coverage of the 2018 NFL draft (which would later shift to ESPN2) and later airing another first-round game between the Indiana Pacers and Cleveland Cavaliers. Additionally, this game was also simulcast on NBA TV using the ESPN feed.
* In June 2018, it was announced that six National Women&#x27;s Soccer League matches through the end of the 2018 season would air on ESPNews, as part of its broadcast arrangement with fellow Disney/Hearst venture A&amp;E Networks and Lifetime.
* Game 3 of the semifinal round of the 2018 WNBA Playoffs between the Atlanta Dream and Washington Mystics aired on ESPNEWS due to a college football game (Western Kentucky–Wisconsin) on ESPN and the third round of the US Open airing on ESPN2. As with the Raptors–Wizards playoff game mentioned earlier, this game was also simulcast on NBA TV using the ESPNews feed including the BottomLine ticker which was displayed above their own ticker.

Additionally, ESPNEWS simulcasted ESPN Deportes&#x27; coverage of the 2018 Supercopa de España, the first time it has aired Spanish-language programming although the BottomLine ticker continued to be displayed in English.

==ESPN Radio segment==
In 2007, ESPNEWS began broadcasting a half-hour segment of ESPN Radio programming on Sunday mornings. The broadcast includes three commentators (a retired coach, a retired player, and an analyst) to break down the events of the featured sport, while an on-screen graphical list of standings, statistical leaders, and other statistics of the featured sport is displayed, the upper-right of the screen shows sports highlights (usually of the player or team of discussion), a fan comment board appears at the bottom of the screen, above the ESPNEWS BottomLine.

==High definition==
ESPNEWS operates a high-definition simulcast feed, which broadcasts in 720p (the default resolution format for The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s television properties) and was launched on March 30, 2008. Originally, the layout and graphics were reworked specifically for viewing on widescreen television sets, offering additional content not available on the channel&#x27;s standard-definition feed. It utilized reworked HD sideline graphics, a descendant of the &quot;Rundown&quot; used on overnight editions of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on ESPN, which wrapped around the top left and bottom of the widescreen picture. The HD Sideline offered the display of textual information, headshots, news and scores, while still delivering video highlights in the HD format.

The enhanced format was discontinued in June 2010 and the channel now broadcasts in near-fullscreen 16:9, with regular gray-and-red graphics similar to those used by the other ESPN channels. The move was made to &quot;accommodate the high number of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;s that moved to the network during the World Cup.&quot;

On May 20, 2012, ESPNEWS switched the presentation of its standard definition feed from 4:3 to a downscaled widescreen letterbox version of the HD feed, becoming the last ESPN network with a HD companion channel to make the conversion to a full-widescreen presentation. ESPNEWS HD was added to Dish Network on March 18, 2014, as part of a new carriage agreement that ended a four-year dispute that removed existing HD simulcast feeds of Disney-owned channels.

==International versions==
While not operating under the ESPN name, CTV Specialty Television (which is partly owned by ESPN) operates RDS Info, a French-language sister network to Réseau des sports (RDS) (which in turn, is a sister network to the English language TSN), which maintains a sports news format and ticker similar to that used by ESPNews, and carries continuous broadcasts of &quot;Sports 30&quot; (RDS&#x27;s equivalent of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;). Until October 2011, when RDS2 was launched, RDS Info was also used as a part-time secondary outlet for RDS in the event of scheduling conflicts. It has since served as an occasional tertiary outlet for RDS programming, similar to the role now served by ESPNews.

ESPN Star Sports (a joint venture between ESPN International and Star TV) operated an Asian version of ESPNews that was launched in November 2009 in Singapore on Singtel&#x27;s Mio TV and later expanded to other areas, including Hong Kong, where it was launched in August 2011 on PCCW&#x27;s Now TV. It was renamed Fox Sports News in 2013, following News Corporation&#x27;s full take over of ESPN Star Sports, before it was closed down in 2017.

<doc id="876294" wikidata="Q829645" url="?curid=876294" title="Borel functional calculus">
<text>In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Borel functional calculus is a &quot;functional calculus&quot; (that is, an assignment of operators from commutative algebras to functions defined on their spectra), which has particularly broad scope. Thus for instance if &quot;T&quot; is an operator, applying the squaring function &quot;s&quot; → &quot;s&quot;2 to &quot;T&quot; yields the operator &quot;T&quot;2. Using the functional calculus for larger classes of functions, we can for example define rigorously the &quot;square root&quot; of the (negative) Laplacian operator or the exponential formula_1

The &#x27;scope&#x27; here means the kind of &quot;function of an operator&quot; which is allowed. The Borel functional calculus is more general than the continuous functional calculus, and its focus is different than the holomorphic functional calculus.

More precisely, the Borel functional calculus allows for applying an arbitrary Borel function to a self-adjoint operator, in a way that generalizes applying a polynomial function.

== Motivation ==
If &quot;T&quot; is a self-adjoint operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space &quot;H&quot;, then &quot;H&quot; has an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors of &quot;T&quot;, that is
formula_2

Thus, for any positive integer &quot;n&quot;,
formula_3

If only polynomials in &quot;T&quot; are considered, then one gets the holomorphic functional calculus. The relation also holds for more general functions of &quot;T&quot;. Given a Borel function &quot;h&quot;, one can define an operator &quot;h&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) by specifying its behavior on the basis:
formula_4

Generally, any self-adjoint operator &quot;T&quot; is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator; this means that for many purposes, &quot;T&quot; can be considered as an operator
formula_5
acting on &quot;L&quot;2 of some measure space. The domain of &quot;T&quot; consists of those functions whose above expression is in &quot;L&quot;2. In such a case, one can define analogously
formula_6

For many technical purposes, the previous formulation is good enough. However, it is desirable to formulate the functional calculus in a way that does not depend on the particular representation of &quot;T&quot; as a multiplication operator. That&#x27;s what we do in the next section.

== The bounded functional calculus ==
Formally, the bounded Borel functional calculus of a self adjoint operator &quot;T&quot; on Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; is a mapping defined on the space of bounded complex-valued Borel functions &quot;f&quot; on the real line,
formula_7
such that the following conditions hold

* is an involution-preserving and unit-preserving homomorphism from the ring of complex-valued bounded measurable functions on R.
* If ξ is an element of &quot;H&quot;, then formula_8 is a countably additive measure on the Borel sets &quot;E&quot; of R. In the above formula 1&quot;E&quot; denotes the indicator function of &quot;E&quot;. These measures νξ are called the spectral measures of &quot;T&quot;.
* If denotes the mapping &quot;z&quot; → &quot;z&quot; on C, then: formula_9

This defines the functional calculus for &quot;bounded&quot; functions applied to possibly &quot;unbounded&quot; self-adjoint operators. Using the bounded functional calculus, one can prove part of the Stone&#x27;s theorem on one-parameter unitary groups:

As an application, we consider the Schrödinger equation, or equivalently, the dynamics of a quantum mechanical system. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian operator &quot;H&quot; models the total energy observable of a quantum mechanical system S. The unitary group generated by &quot;iH&quot; corresponds to the time evolution of S.

We can also use the Borel functional calculus to abstractly solve some linear initial value problems such as the heat equation, or Maxwell&#x27;s equations.

=== Existence of a functional calculus ===
The existence of a mapping with the properties of a functional calculus requires proof. For the case of a bounded self-adjoint operator &quot;T&quot;, the existence of a Borel functional calculus can be shown in an elementary way as follows:

First pass from polynomial to continuous functional calculus by using the Stone–Weierstrass theorem. The crucial fact here is that, for a bounded self adjoint operator &quot;T&quot; and a polynomial &quot;p&quot;,
formula_10

Consequently, the mapping
formula_11
is an isometry and a densely defined homomorphism on the ring of polynomial functions. Extending by continuity defines &quot;f&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) for a continuous function &quot;f&quot; on the spectrum of &quot;T&quot;. The Riesz-Markov theorem then allows us to pass from integration on continuous functions to spectral measures, and this is the Borel functional calculus.

Alternatively, the continuous calculus can be obtained via the Gelfand transform, in the context of commutative Banach algebras. Extending to measurable functions is achieved by applying Riesz-Markov, as above. In this formulation, &quot;T&quot; can be a normal operator.

Given an operator &quot;T&quot;, the range of the continuous functional calculus &quot;h&quot; → &quot;h&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is the (abelian) C*-algebra &quot;C&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) generated by &quot;T&quot;. The Borel functional calculus has a larger range, that is the closure of &quot;C&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) in the weak operator topology, a (still abelian) von Neumann algebra.

== The general functional calculus ==

We can also define the functional calculus for not necessarily bounded Borel functions &quot;h&quot;; the result is an operator which in general fails to be bounded. Using the multiplication by a function &quot;f&quot; model of a self-adjoint operator given by the spectral theorem, this is multiplication by the composition of &quot;h&quot; with &quot;f&quot;.

 h(t) \ d\nu_{\xi} (t), \quad \text{for} \quad \xi \in \operatorname{dom} S&lt;/math&gt;}}

The operator &quot;S&quot; of the previous theorem is denoted &quot;h&quot;(&quot;T&quot;).

More generally, a Borel functional calculus also exists for (bounded) normal operators.

== Resolution of the identity ==
Let formula_12 be a self-adjoint operator. If formula_13 is a Borel subset of R, and formula_14 is the indicator function of &quot;E&quot;, then formula_15 is a self-adjoint projection on &quot;H&quot;. Then mapping
formula_16
is a projection-valued measure. The measure of R with respect to formula_17 is the identity operator on &quot;H&quot;. In other words, the identity operator can be expressed as the spectral integral
:formula_18.

Stone&#x27;s formula expresses the spectral measure formula_19 in terms of the resolvent formula_20:
:formula_21

Depending on the source, the resolution of the identity is defined, either as a projection-valued measure formula_19, or as a one-parameter family of projection-valued measures formula_23 with formula_24.

In the case of a discrete measure (in particular, when &quot;H&quot; is finite-dimensional), formula_25 can be written as
formula_26
in the Dirac notation, where each formula_27 is a normalized eigenvector of &quot;T&quot;. The set formula_28 is an orthonormal basis of &quot;H&quot;.

In physics literature, using the above as heuristic, one passes to the case when the spectral measure is no longer discrete and write the resolution of identity as
formula_29
and speak of a &quot;continuous basis&quot;, or &quot;continuum of basis states&quot;, formula_28 Mathematically, unless rigorous justifications are given, this expression is purely formal.

<doc id="876297" wikidata="Q7541370" url="?curid=876297" title="Slopping out">
<text>Slopping out is the manual emptying of human waste when prison cells are unlocked in the morning. Inmates without a flush toilet in the cell have to use other means (formerly a chamber pot, then a bucket, now often a chemical toilet) while locked in during the night. The reason that some cells do not have toilets is that they date from the Victorian era and were therefore not designed with plumbing. As a result, there is no space in which to put a toilet, together with the expense and difficulty of installing the necessary pipes.

==Dirty protest==
During the late 1970s, Provisional IRA volunteers protested against conditions of internment at HM Prison Maze by refusing to slop out and instead smearing their faeces on the cell walls. This was later referred to as the dirty protest, part of several acts of disobedience within the &quot;H-Blocks&quot; culminating in the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike.

==Phasing out==

Slopping out was allegedly abolished in England and Wales by 1996, although &quot;Private Eye&quot; in 2011 reported that Prisons Inspector Nick Hardwick stated that it still persisted at HMP Gloucester.

It was scheduled to be abolished in Scotland by 1999. Due to budget restraints the abolition was delayed, and by 2004 prisoners in five of Scotland&#x27;s sixteen prisons still had to slop out. Slopping out ended in HM Young Offenders Institution Polmont in 2007, leaving HM Prison Peterhead as the last Scottish prison where prisoners did not have access to plumbing; 300 prisoners had to use chemical toilets due to the difficulty of installing modern plumbing in the prison&#x27;s granite structure. Peterhead ultimately closed in December 2013.

Slopping out is still in practice in prisons in the Republic of Ireland. Speaking at the launch of the Irish Human Rights Commission&#x27;s Annual Report for 2009, the Green Party Junior Minister for Integration Mary White said it was time to move on from the Victorian practice. Slopping out was eradicated in Dublin&#x27;s Mountjoy Prison by the end of 2013 and in Cork Prison in 2016. However, the practice continues at Limerick Prison.

==Other==
A &quot;potwalloper&quot; was a trusty prisoner who made sure the buckets were emptied and cleaned each morning. He did not do the cleaning himself, but he was responsible for making sure that other prisoners did.

<doc id="876298" wikidata="Q969855" url="?curid=876298" title="James Burke (gangster)">
<text>James Burke (July 5, 1931 – April 13, 1996), also known as &quot;Jimmy the Gent&quot;, was an American gangster and Lucchese crime family associate who is believed to have organized the 1978 Lufthansa heist, the largest cash robbery in American history at the time. He was believed to be responsible for the deaths of those involved in the months after the robbery.

Following the testimony of Henry Hill, Burke was convicted in 1982, of conspiracy charges related to his involvement in the 1978–79 Boston College basketball point-shaving scandal, and sentenced to 12 years in prison. While in prison, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to another 20 years. He died of cancer at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, twelve years before he would have been eligible for parole. The movie Goodfellas reference to ‘ Jimmy Conway’ being eligible for parole in 2004 was not, as per the New York Department of Corrections ‘Find An Inmate’, an accurate statement of when Burke fell due to be considered for parole. 

Burke inspired the character Jimmy &quot;The Gent&quot; Conway, one of the main characters of the 1990 film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, played by Robert De Niro.

==Early life==
At the age of two, Burke was placed in a foster home and was exposed to violence and sexual abuse while in the care of dozens of foster parents. At the age of 13, an altercation with his foster parents while riding in a car resulted in a crash and the death of his foster father.

In 1962, Burke married his girlfriend Mickey but discovered that she was being bothered by an ex-boyfriend. On their wedding day, police found the ex-boyfriend&#x27;s remains, in over a dozen pieces, strewn around the inside of his car. He is the father of Lufthansa heist aide Frank James Burke (who was murdered in 1987), Jesse James Burke, and Catherine Burke (who married Bonanno crime family member Anthony Indelicato).

==Criminal activities==
As Burke was of Irish descent, he was ineligible to become a &quot;made man&quot; in the Italian-American Mafia, so he was limited to being an associate under capo Paul Vario. During the 1950s, Burke was involved with various illegal activities, such as distributing untaxed cigarettes and liquor. Burke became a mentor to Thomas DeSimone, Henry Hill, and Angelo Sepe, during the 1960s. Burke owned the South Ozone Park, Queens tavern Robert&#x27;s Lounge.

In November 1972, Burke and Hill were arrested for beating Gaspar Ciaccio in Tampa, Florida. Ciaccio allegedly owed a large gambling debt to their friend, union boss Casey Rosado. They were charged with extortion, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg. Burke was paroled after six years and resumed his criminal career, as did Hill, who was released two years prior. 
Both Hill and Burke began trafficking illegal narcotics, despite a ban by the Lucchese family, who feared their associates becoming informants in exchange for a lesser sentence, which is exactly what Hill did in 1980.

===Murder of William &quot;Billy Batts&quot; Bentvena===
In the book &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, Henry Hill said that after William &quot;Billy Batts&quot; Bentvena was released from prison in 1970, they threw a &quot;welcome home&quot; party for Bentvena at Robert&#x27;s Lounge, which was owned by Burke. Hill stated that Bentvena saw Tommy DeSimone and jokingly asked him if he still shined shoes and DeSimone perceived it as an insult. DeSimone leaned over to Hill and Burke and said &quot;I&#x27;m gonna kill that fuck.&quot; Two weeks later, on June 11, 1970, Bentvena was at The Suite, a nightclub owned by Hill. Late in the night, with the bar club nearly empty, DeSimone pistol-whipped Bentvena. Hill said that before DeSimone started to beat Bentvena, DeSimone yelled, &quot;Shine these fucking shoes!&quot;

After Bentvena was beaten and presumed killed, DeSimone, Burke, and Hill placed his body in the trunk of Hill&#x27;s car for transport. They stopped at DeSimone&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house to get a shovel and lime. They started to hear sounds from the trunk, and when they realized that Bentvena was still alive, DeSimone and Burke stopped the car and beat him to death with the shovel and a tire iron. Burke had a friend who owned a dog kennel in Upstate New York, and Bentvena was buried there.

About three months after Bentvena&#x27;s murder, Burke&#x27;s friend sold the dog kennel to housing developers, and Burke ordered Hill and DeSimone to exhume Bentvena&#x27;s corpse and dispose of it elsewhere. In &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, Hill said the body was eventually crushed in a mechanical compactor at a New Jersey junkyard, which was owned by Clyde Brooks. However, on the commentary for the film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, he states that Bentvena&#x27;s body was buried in the basement of Robert&#x27;s Lounge, a bar and restaurant owned by Burke, and only later was put into the car crusher.

===Lufthansa heist===
The Lufthansa heist was planned by Burke and carried out by several associates. The plot began when bookmaker Martin Krugman told Burke&#x27;s associate Henry Hill that Lufthansa flew in currency to its cargo terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The information had originally come from Louis Werner, a worker at the airport who owed Krugman $20,000 for gambling debts () and from his co-worker Peter Gruenwald.

Burke decided on Tommy DeSimone, Angelo Sepe, Louis Cafora, Joe Manri, Paolo LiCastri and Robert McMahon as the robbers. Burke&#x27;s son Frank would drive one of the backup vehicles and Parnell &quot;Stacks&quot; Edwards&#x27;s job was to dispose of the van afterwards. Depending on their role in the robbery, each participant was to receive $10,000 to $50,000. However, those amounts were based on the estimated haul, which was only $2 million compared to the actual take of $5.875 million. Werner was to receive a flat 10% of the take.

On December 11, 1978, an estimated $5.875 million (equivalent to $ million in ) was stolen, with $5 million in cash and $875,000 in jewelry, making it the largest cash robbery committed on American soil at the time.

Burke is also alleged to have either committed or ordered the murders of many of the robbers to avoid being implicated in the heist. The first was Edwards, on December 18, after he failed to get rid of the robbery van. Burke was never implicated or charged in the robbery, and the stolen cash and jewelry were never recovered.

===Boston College point shaving scandal===
In 1980, Burke was arrested for a parole violation. In 1982, Burke was convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to 12 years in prison for his involvement with the 1978–79 Boston College basketball point-shaving scandal, based primarily on the testimony of former mob associate Henry Hill. Hill&#x27;s testimony in federal court resulted in a total of fifty convictions in this and other cases, including those of Burke and their boss, capo Paul Vario. While Burke was serving that sentence, he was charged with the 1979 murder of drug dealer Richard Eaton. He was convicted at a trial in which Hill testified and was sentenced in 1985 to a further 20 years in prison.

Burke&#x27;s son Frank James Burke, a cocaine dealer and associate in the Gambino crime family, was shot dead at the age of 26 by another drug dealer, Tito Ortiz, after arguing with two men outside the Suncrest Tavern on Liberty Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn on May 18, 1987.

==Death==
Burke was serving his sentence in Wende Correctional Facility in Alden, New York, when he developed cancer. He died on April 13, 1996, while being treated at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York. Had he lived, he would have been eligible for parole on November 3, 2008 Burke was buried at Saint Charles Cemetery in East Farmingdale, New York.

==Aftermath==
James Burke was portrayed by Robert De Niro in the 1990 Martin Scorsese film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, renamed Jimmy Conway.

Burke was played by John Mahoney in the 1991 television film &quot;The 10 Million Dollar Getaway&quot;, which details the events of the Lufthansa Heist. Donald Sutherland also portrayed Burke for the 2001 television film &quot;The Big Heist&quot;.

In 2013, possible human remains were unearthed by the FBI and NYPD organized crime investigators at his former home.

In October 2014, Burke&#x27;s involvement in the Boston College Point Shaving Scandal was discussed in the ESPN &quot;30 for 30&quot; episode &quot;Playing for the Mob.&quot; Ray Liotta, who played Henry Hill in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, is the narrator of the documentary.

<text>Eadgifu of Kent (also Edgiva or Ediva; in or before 903 – in or after 966) was the third wife of Edward the Elder, King of Wessex.

==Biography==
Eadgifu was the daughter of Sigehelm, Ealdorman of Kent, who died at the Battle of the Holme in 902. She married Edward in about 919 and became the mother of two sons, Edmund I of England, later King Edmund I, and Eadred of England, later King Eadred, and two daughters, Saint Eadburh of Winchester and Eadgifu. She survived Edward by many years, dying in the reign of her grandson Edgar.

According to a charter issued by Eadgifu in the early 960s (S 1211), her father, Sigehelm, had given Cooling in Kent to a man called Goda as security for a loan of thirty pounds. The charter claims that Sigehelm had repaid the loan prior to departing for the Battle of the Holme, bequeathing the land to Eadgifu. Goda denied receiving payment and refused to surrender the estate, despite the decision of the witan that Eadgifu could claim it should she swear a public oath as to her father&#x27;s repayment (which she did at Aylesford). Eadgifu attained possession of Cooling six years after her father&#x27;s death, when her friends persuaded King Edward to intervene. Edward ultimately declared Goda&#x27;s lands forfeit and gave all the charters of ownership to Eadgifu. However, she returned almost all the estates to Goda, an act which Matthew Firth argues was driven by Eadgifu&#x27;s desire to avoid ongoing conflict with a powerful political rival. She did, however, retain the lands at Cooling and another estate at place called Osterland, as well as all of Goda&#x27;s charters. Some time after this her marriage to Edward took place. After Edward&#x27;s death, Goda asked King Æthelstan to intercede with Eadgifu, who subsequently returned the charters to Goda but retained the Cooling and Osterland estates.

She disappeared from court during the reign of her step-son, King Æthelstan, but she was prominent and influential during the reign of her two sons and attested many of their charters. In charter S 562, a grant to her by Eadred of land at Felpham in Sussex issued in 953, she is described as &quot;famula Dei&quot;, suggesting that she may have taken religious vows while continuing to live on her own estates. Given that the estate at Felpham had come into the ownership of Shaftesbury Abbey by the time of the Domesday Survey in the 1080s, Susan Kelly suggests Eadgifu may have become an associate of that house.

Following the death of her younger son Eadred in 955, she was deprived of her lands (or at least those that has been disputed with Goda) by her eldest grandson, King Eadwig. This may have been because she took the side of his younger brother, Edgar, in the succession dispute between their factions. When Edgar succeeded on Eadwig&#x27;s death in 959 she recovered some lands and received generous gifts from her grandson, but she never returned to her prominent position at court. She is last appears in the historical record as a witness to charter S 745, the New Minster, Winchester refoundation charter, in 966.

She was known as a supporter of reforming churchmen and appears in the hagiographies of St Dunstan, the archbishop of Canterbury, and St Æthelwold, the bishop of Winchester. She was also a known benefactor of churches, granting the estates at Cooling and Osterland to Christ Church Canterbury once she regained them in Edgar&#x27;s reign, and gifting lands to Abingdon and Ely abbeys.

<text>Kirk Edward Herbstreit (; born August 19, 1969) is an American sportscaster and former college football player. He serves as an analyst for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;College GameDay&quot;, a television program covering college football, and provides color commentary on college football games on ESPN and ABC and Thursday night NFL games on Prime Video. For his TV work, Herbstreit has won five Sports Emmy Awards in various categories. He appeared annually as a commentator in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;NCAA Football&quot; video game series, including after a ten-year hiatus.

From 1989 to 1993, Herbstreit played football as a quarterback for the Ohio State Buckeyes. He played in several games his junior season, and was the starting quarterback throughout his senior season.

==Playing career and subsequent activities in Ohio==
Herbstreit graduated from Centerville High School in Centerville, Ohio, a suburb of Dayton. As a quarterback for the Elks, he was the Ohio Gatorade Player of the Year as a senior. He also was a standout basketball and baseball player.

Herbstreit was the first player to commit to the Ohio State Buckeyes after the hiring of John Cooper as head coach in 1988. Herbstreit was a four-year letterman as a quarterback at Ohio State University from 1989 to 1993. After waiting his turn behind Greg Frey and Kent Graham, Herbstreit finally led the team as a senior in 1992. That year, he was a co-captain (along with linebacker Steve Tovar) and voted team MVP. Herbstreit passed for 1,904 yards that season, including four 200-plus-yard games, before losing to the Georgia Bulldogs in the Florida Citrus Bowl. Herbstreit set the Ohio State record for pass completions (28) in the rivalry game against Michigan, throwing for 271 yards in a 13–13 tie in 1992. The record stood until 2006, when it was broken by Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith. Herbstreit graduated from Ohio State in 1993 with a degree in business administration.

Herbstreit&#x27;s father, Jim Herbstreit, was a co-captain (along with offensive tackle Jim Tyrer) of the 1960 Ohio State team, and later an assistant coach at Ohio State under Woody Hayes. When Herbstreit was named co-captain in 1992, the two became only the second father-and-son duo to have each been Ohio State captains. (James and Jeff Davidson were the first in 1989; Pepper and Dionte Johnson became the third in 2007.)

He also is known for a 2009 case in which he sued the IRS for changing an implied policy of allowing deductions for house donations to the fire department for training purposes.

Herbstreit is actively involved in multiple charities including the Buckeye Cruise for Cancer and The Make A Wish Foundation Ultimate Sports Auction.
He has lent his name to the Kirk Herbstreit National Kickoff Classic in Columbus, Ohio, and Arlington, Texas. According to the website, the Kickoff Classic &quot;pits high school teams from the states of Ohio and Texas against prep football powerhouses from across the nation&quot; over the Labor Day weekend. The games in Ohio are usually held at Ohio Stadium, while the games in Texas are held at AT&amp;T Stadium.

==Broadcasting career==

Herbstreit joined ESPN in September 1995 as a college football sideline analyst. The following year he joined &quot;College GameDay,&quot; an ESPN program with which he has become almost synonymous, as a lead analyst. He continues to serve in that role alongside host Rece Davis and fellow analysts Desmond Howard, Pat McAfee, Lee Corso, and Nick Saban. He also serves as the lead game analyst for ESPN and ABC, a responsibility that sees him travel to ESPN&#x27;s biggest game that week for ABC Saturday Night Football to call the marquee game alongside former &quot;GameDay&quot; host and longtime colleague Chris Fowler and sideline reporter Holly Rowe.

Herbstreit was nominated for a 1997 Sports Emmy Award as television&#x27;s top studio analyst and wrote a weekly in-season column, &quot;Inside The Game With Kirk Herbstreit,&quot; for &quot;The Sporting News&quot;.

A frequent contributor to ESPN.com and &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot;, Herbstreit has worked as a color commentator for ESPN&#x27;s Thursday night college football games.

In July 2007, Herbstreit served as a panelist for the series &quot;Who&#x27;s Now&quot; alongside Keyshawn Johnson and Michael Wilbon.

Herbstreit contributes to the 97.1 The Fan, an ESPN Radio affiliate out of Columbus, Ohio.

In 2018, Herbstreit was announced to replace Jon Gruden for night one of ESPN&#x27;s NFL Draft coverage, as Gruden left to return to the then-Oakland, now Las Vegas Raiders. When ABC picked up rights to air the first two nights of the Draft, Herbstreit moved to ABC&#x27;s coverage with his &quot;GameDay&quot; colleagues.

In 2020, Herbstreit announced the first game of the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; Kickoff Week doubleheader alongside Chris Fowler. A week later, Herbstreit and Rece Davis worked a special &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; MegaCast on ESPN2 for the Saints–Raiders game, the first ever NFL game to be played in Las Vegas, on the night in which &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; celebrated its 50th anniversary. In 2022, Fowler and Herbstreit again called the first game of an &quot;MNF&quot; doubleheader, this time during the final week of the 2021 season.

On March 23, 2022, Herbstreit was announced as the new color commentator for &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; on Prime Video, alongside NFL play-by-play announcer Al Michaels. That same day, Herbstreit agreed to an extension of his contract with ESPN to allow him to continue on &quot;GameDay&quot;, Saturday Night Football, and the NFL Draft, to go along with his new NFL duties for Amazon.

==Personal life==
Herbstreit met his wife Alison at Ohio State, where she was a cheerleader. They were married in 1998 and have four sons. The Herbstreits moved from Ohio to Nashville in 2011, but now split time between there and Cincinnati where their youngest son, Chase, plays quarterback for St. Xavier High School.
 His twin sons, Jake and Tye, were athletes at Montgomery Bell Academy. Tye played football as a walk-on at Clemson University; Jake walked on at Clemson before transferring to Ohio State to focus on academics. Herbstreit has another son, Zak, who joined the Ohio State football team as a preferred walk-on in 2021, as a tight end.

Herbstreit is a Christian. When asked about the role faith plays in his life, he said, “Everything. I try to every day walk that path.“

His hobbies include playing EA Sports video games, and working out. Herbstreit is a horse racing fan, and also follows Ohio sports teams like the Cincinnati Bengals, Columbus Blue Jackets, and Cincinnati Reds. Herbstreit was featured prominently in &quot;How We Lookin&#x27;?,&quot; a documentary about the life and career of longtime Reds broadcaster Marty Brennaman.

Herbstreit was a vocal advocate of bringing back the NCAA Football series, which had not had a new entry since 2013. When the series returned in 2024, Herbstreit was included as one of the in-game commentators.

He has four golden retrievers, one of whom, Ben, traveled with him to games. Ben, who was a certified emotional support animal, was considered a &quot;fan favorite&quot; until his death in November 2024 due to leukemia. Joe Biden sent Herbstreit a letter offering his condolences. Following Ben&#x27;s passing, Ben&#x27;s younger brother Peter started to travel with Herbstreit and began appearing on &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; and &quot;College GameDay&quot;.

<text>Edgar Evertson Saltus (October 8, 1855 – July 31, 1921) was an American writer known for his highly refined prose style. His works paralleled those by European decadent authors such as Joris-Karl Huysmans, Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio and Oscar Wilde.

Under the pseudonym Myndart Verelst, Saltus translated works by Balzac, Théophile Gautier, and Prosper Mérimée; he also wrote using the name Archibald Wilberforce. 

==Early life and education==
Edgar Saltus was born in New York City on October 8, 1855, to Francis Henry Saltus and his second wife, Eliza Evertson, both of Dutch descent. He attended St. Paul&#x27;s in Concord, New Hampshire. After two semesters at Yale University, Saltus entered Columbia Law School in 1878, graduating with a law degree in 1880.

==Career==
He wrote two books on philosophy: &quot;The Philosophy of Disenchantment&quot; (1885) focused on philosophical pessimism and in particular the philosophy of Schopenhauer and Eduard von Hartmann, while &quot;The Anatomy of Negation&quot; (1886) tried &quot;to convey a tableau of anti-theism from Kapila to Leconte de Lisle&quot;.

After a conversion experience, the once anti-theist and pessimist credited Ralph Waldo Emerson with having transformed his views. In an 1896 &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; column, he wrote, &quot;I began to see, and what to me was even more marvelous, I began to think.&quot; In time, he became a member of the Theosophical Society, an organization that studied, synthesized and experimented with the more esoteric concepts and practices of world religions.

==Personal life==
Saltus was married three times. He married his first wife, Helen Sturgis Read, in 1883 (divorced, 1891). At the church in the English Embassy in Paris, he married in 1895 Elsie Welch Smith (separated, 1901; died, 1911). Saltus married his third wife, author Marie Flores Giles, in 1911. Saltus had a three-year love affair in the 1890s with heiress Aimée Crocker, confirmed in her memoir &quot;And I&#x27;d Do It Again&quot; (1936).

Saltus and his first wife appeared in the 1887 first edition of the New York, &quot;Social Register&quot;.

His elder half-brother Francis Saltus Saltus was a minor poet. Both brothers are buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

==Legacy==
Acclaimed by fellow writers in his day, Saltus fell into obscurity after his death.

His novel &quot;The Paliser Case&quot; was adapted to film in 1920, and his novel &quot;Daughters of the Rich&quot; was filmed in 1923.

&quot;Edgar Saltus: The Man&quot;, a biography by Marie Saltus, Edgar&#x27;s third wife, was published in 1925. &quot;Edgar Saltus&quot;, a critical study by Claire Sprague, appeared in 1968.

The writer and photographer Carl Van Vechten, was instrumental in convincing Saltus&#x27;s daughter, Elsie Saltus Munds, to donate to Yale what is now known as the Edgar Saltus Papers, consisting of thirty-eight first editions, two of them inscribed, and eighteen letters written in 1918.

A descendant through his wife Elsie, French-born James de Beaujeu Domville, was a major theatrical producer and Canadian cultural commissioner focused on the film industry.
