<text>Justin Vivian Bond (born May 9, 1963) is an American singer-songwriter and actor, who is transgender. Described as &quot;the best cabaret artist of [their] generation&quot; and a &quot;tornado of art and activism&quot;, they first achieved prominence under the pseudonym of Kiki DuRane in the stage duo Kiki and Herb, an act born out of a collaboration with long-time co-star Kenny Mellman. With a musical voice self-described as &quot;kind of woody and full with a lot of vibration&quot;, Bond is a Tony-nominated (2007) performer who has received GLAAD (2000), Obie (2001), Bessie (2004), Ethyl (2007), and a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists (2012) awards. In 2024, Bond was named a MacArthur Fellow.

==Early life==
Bond grew up in Hagerstown, Maryland.

As &quot;a trans kid in a small town&quot;, Bond recalls feeling &quot;I wasn&#x27;t being accepted for who I was, but at the time I didn&#x27;t even have the words to express who I was.&quot; Meanwhile, they were taking voice lessons and singing in church and in the local community theatre.

Bond studied theater at Adelphi University on Long Island from 1981 to 1985. They saw Simon and Garfunkel in concert in Central Park, but it was visiting Carnegie Hall for the first time to see Judy Collins that invoked the realization that &quot;I had escaped my hometown and was finally beginning to live the life I&#x27;d dreamed of.&quot;

==Early career==
After graduation, Bond worked briefly at &quot;Details&quot; magazine. Returning to Maryland, they found roles in regional dinner theaters, often doubling as a server. Bond moved to San Francisco in 1988.

Bond started out clerking in a gay bookstore, and at some point, adopted the stage name of Justin.

A turning point occurred when Kate Bornstein cast Bond in her play &quot;Hidden: A Gender&quot;, using the life of the French, intersex person Herculine Barbin as an autobiographical device. Bond &quot;was not sure [they] could really pull off playing a girl,&quot; according to Bornstein, and feared the censure of &quot;[their] gay male friends.&quot; With the assistance of Kenny Mellman, they created the lounge act Dixie McCall&#x27;s Patterns for Living around the persona of actress and singer Julie London. The duo played a number of gigs, both in and out of character; three years after attending Pride for the first time, Bond was hosting the show at the end of the parade. In 1993, Bond hosted the first San Francisco Drag King Contest at the DNA Lounge with Elvis Herselvis. In 1994, they appeared on film for the first time, as Amphetamine in John Moritsugu&#x27;s &quot;Mod Fuck Explosion&quot;, and again the following year in &quot;Fanci&#x27;s Persuasion&quot;.

==Trans-Atlantic cabaret==

===Kiki and Herb: 1993–2007===
Bond is best known for originating the role of washed-up lounge singer Kiki DuRane, &quot;an alcoholic battle-axe with a throat full of razor-blades.&quot; Kiki&#x27;s equally-damaged accompanist Herb, played by pianist Kenny Mellman, made up the other half of the duo, billed as Kiki and Herb. Critics lauded both the performance and the edgy, eclectic repertoire. Described in one place as &quot;tragically hip&quot;, the inspiration arose &quot;out of my own trauma regarding AIDS and so many people dying,&quot; according to Bond. &quot;All our friends were dying of AIDS, and it was a way to get out all our rage,&quot; said Mellman.

Bond moved to New York City in 1994 in the midst of crackdown on queer clubs by then-mayor Rudy Giuliani. Journalist John Russell saw in Kiki &quot;an icon to rival Hedwig.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Kiki &quot;the town&#x27;s most endearingly unhinged chanteuse&quot;, comparing Bond favorably to more conventional performers for whom &quot;the point is never the prettiness of the voice.&quot; Bond has said that &quot;I think that the reason people liked Kiki so much is that she had just about everything wrong with her.&quot;

Kiki and Herb met with more critical acclaim and developed a cult following. They received their first &quot;New York Times&quot; review for &quot;Have Another&quot;, (1999), a show that earned a GLAAD media award the following year. They performed extensively, namely in London&#x27;s Soho Theatre and Queen Elizabeth Hall and New York&#x27;s The Knitting Factory and Carnegie Hall, as well as a host of other venues worldwide. Their numerous collaborators included Debbie Harry of Blondie, comedian Sandra Bernhard, and Antony of Antony and the Johnsons. Their recordings included the Christmas album, &quot;Do You Hear What We Hear?&quot; (2000), and &quot;Kiki and Herb Will Die for You: Live at Carnegie Hall&quot; (2005). In 2004, Bond and Mellman did a cameo in the Sony Pictures release &quot;Imaginary Heroes&quot;, with script by Dan Harris. Appearing alongside Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, and Emile Hirsch, the duo reprised the Melanie Safka composition &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Kind of Night&quot; from &quot;Do You Hear What We Hear?&quot; Their stage act was captured on video in &quot;Kiki and Herb Live at the Knitting Factory&quot; (2007). They toured twice in the U.S., including the 2007 &#x27;Year of Magical Drinking Tour.&#x27;

The duo traveled repeatedly to London, where Bond continued to work on an MA in scenography at Central St. Martin&#x27;s College of Art and Design when not performing. London shows included &quot;Where Are We Now?&quot;, &quot;Kiki &amp; Herb: There&#x27;s a Stranger in the Manger&quot;, and &quot;Kiki &amp; Herb Mount The President&quot;, the latter performed aboard in the River Thames. Bond had a Top 20 Single on the UK alternative chart and was named one of England&#x27;s fifty funniest people by &quot;Time Out London&quot;. The mockumentaries titled &quot;Kiki and Herb on the Rocks&quot; (2005) and &quot;Kiki and Herb Reloaded&quot; (2005) followed the pair to London and around the UK, respectively.

Their show &quot;Kiki &amp; Herb: Alive on Broadway&quot; ran for five weeks in 2006, and was nominated for a 2007 Tony for Special Theatrical Event. One critic noted that onstage they are &quot;Alive with a capital A, with all the human vitality and fallibility that that implies.&quot; A poster on tribe.net reported hearing them mentioned on an episode of &quot;Will and Grace&quot; early in 2006, noting that &quot;now they have crossed over.&quot;

After closing on Broadway, Bond returned for the final, American tour. This was followed by a return to Carnegie Hall for a one-night show on December 12, 2007, billed as &quot;Kiki and Herb: The Second Coming – A Christmas Concert&quot;.

===Solo career: 1993–present===

Before retiring Kiki in 2008, Bond was touring nationally and abroad, appearing in film, and recording under the name of Justin Bond.

Bond&#x27;s first album was the result of an improvised concert with experimental, electronic sound artist Bob Ostertag and a Japanese turntablist from the Tokyo noise underground, Otomo Yoshihide, at San Francisco&#x27;s Great American Music Hall in 1997. They already appeared on two tracks (&quot;Not Your Girl&quot; and &quot;The Man in the Blue Slip&quot;) on Ostertag&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Fear No Love&quot;, sharing co-lead vocals duties with Mike Patton. Other guests on the record were Fred Frith and Lynn Breedlove. At the behest of the record label Asphodel, an album was recorded in this location and in studio at Toast, with additional tracks and musicians added later. Because Otomo spoke little English and could not understand what Bond was saying, he watched the recording engineer through the glass and &quot;when I see he laugh, I play something funny.&quot; The album was released under the Seeland label in 1999 as &quot;PantyChrist&quot;, with a European, promotional tour. Although it failed commercially, Ostertag viewed it from an artistic standpoint as &quot;one of my most successful projects.&quot;

Bond released a five-track EP &quot;Pink Slip&quot; in June 2009 featuring four original songs (&quot;The New Depression&quot;, &quot;May Queen&quot;, &quot;The Puppet Song&quot;, &quot;Michael in Blue&quot;) and a cover of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Arpeggi/Weird Fishes&quot;. &quot;Pink Slip&quot; was recorded at Le Poisson Rouge and Bond hoped income from the EP would help fund the recording of an album. Both of the albums were self-financed, and both were the result of a collaboration with pianist/producer Thomas Bartlett of the band Doveman. The first, &quot;Dendrophile&quot; (2011), contained a mix of original compositions and covers modeled on a type of &quot;early-&#x27;70s folk-pop variety album&quot; in the spirit of Judy Collins, featuring a duet with English singer-songwriter Beth Orton. Bond used Kickstarter to finance the release of a second album, &quot;Silver Wells&quot;, in 2012. The album was conceived as an homage to the 1970 Joan Didion novel &quot;Play it as it Lays&quot;.

In 2012, Bond toured nationally with lesbian-feminist, spoken-word collective Sister Spit. promoting the new album. Later that year, they opened the holiday show &quot;Snow Angel&quot;.

In June 2006, Bond appeared with David Hoyle in &quot;When David Met Justin&quot; at London&#x27;s Bush Hall. Performing with the House of Whimsy Players at The Kitchen in October, Bond staged &quot;Re:Galli Blond (A Sissy Fix)&quot;, &quot;a self-penned musical spectacle of transgender oppression and uplift.&quot; They also appeared in Paul Festa&#x27;s &quot;Apparition of the Eternal Church&quot; (2006).

Bond has hosted the Weimer New York variety show since its inception in 2007. &quot;Justin Bond Is Close to You&quot; reinterpreted Karen Carpenter&#x27;s album &quot;Close to You&quot; as part of Joe&#x27;s Pub in the Park in Central Park in 2007, later moving to Australia&#x27;s Sydney Opera House.

In 2008, the GLAAD-nominated show Lustre premiered at PS122 in the East Village, then toured the UK with stops in London and Manchester as part of the It&#x27;s Queer Up North Arts Festival. In December 2008, Bond appeared at London&#x27;s Southbank Centre in &quot;Sinderella&quot;, written by Martyn Jacques of the Tiger Lillies.

&quot;Justin Bond: Christmas Spells&quot; opened in December 2010 at Abrons Arts Center on Grand Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. The two-part show included a trademark cabaret performance of holiday tunes, showcasing an original composition &quot;Could Baby Jesus in His Manger Foresee the Hate Sprung from That Night?&quot; This was followed by a theatrical adaptation of a short story by gender-theorist Kate Bornstein. In December 2015, an EP titled &quot;Christmas Spells&quot; was released, including three songs (&quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;, &quot;Remember (Christmas)&quot; and &quot;Christmas Spells&quot;).

Bond starred as Warhol superstar Jackie Curtis in &quot;Jukebox Jackie&quot; as part of the 50th anniversary season of La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club between May and June 2012. &quot;I&#x27;ve always been really interested in Jackie, Holly Woodlawn, and Candy Darling,&quot; they recounted in an interview at the time, &quot;because they, along with Renée Richards and Christine Jorgensen, were the first famous trans people. When I was young, they were really the only trans people to which I had been exposed.&quot; According to Bond, the project originated as a revival of one of Jackie&#x27;s &quot;crazy, amphetamine-fueled&quot; plays, but Bond (and director Scott Wittman) &quot;couldn&#x27;t really make sense of them&quot; and turned to reportage instead. &quot;I always liked Jackie,&quot; they said, &quot;because Jackie wasn&#x27;t willing to say &#x27;I am a woman trapped in a man&#x27;s body,&#x27; she&#x27;d say &#x27;I&#x27;m trans, I&#x27;m not a man. I&#x27;m not a woman. I&#x27;m Jackie.&#x27; Which, by the way, was the last line of the show.&quot;

Bond&#x27;s show &quot;Mx America&quot; was slated to open in Australia in February 2013.

Beginning in January 2014, Bond appeared alongside Stephen Spinella in the Classic Stage Company production of the Bertolt Brecht play &quot;A Man&#x27;s a Man&quot; (&quot;Man Equals Man&quot;), with new music by Duncan Sheik. The show ran off-Broadway at the company&#x27;s theater on 13th Street in Manhattan&#x27;s East Village, with Bond playing the part of Leokadia Begbick, a role originated by Brecht&#x27;s wife Helene Weigel.

In December 2014, Bond&#x27;s performed in &quot;Star of Light! An Evening of Bi-Polar Witchy Wonder&quot;, which opened at Joe&#x27;s Pub on Lafayette near Manhattan&#x27;s Astor Place.

In 2006, Bond appeared in the film &quot;Shortbus&quot;. In the movie, directed by fellow Radical Faerie John Cameron Mitchell, they played the mistress of ceremonies at the eponymous avant-garde salon Shortbus, singing the Scott Matthew number &quot;In the End&quot; to the music of the Hungry March Band.

Jake Shears, lead singer of Scissor Sisters, has cited the Kiki and Herb Christmas Show as inspiration. Bond and Shears became friends, with the Scissor Sisters fronting for Kiki and Herb at The Knitting Factory. Bond appeared in the 2017 Music Box Theatre performance of the &quot;Tales of the City&quot; musical, with score by Shears.

In 2008, Bond participated in a Christmas show at the Knitting Factory that included Rufus Wainwright, members of Wainwright&#x27;s family, Emmylou Harris, Lou Reed, Velvet Underground, and performance artist Laurie Anderson. Revelation Films released the concert DVD in November 2009 under the title &quot;A Not So Silent Night (Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle/Rufus &amp; Martha Wainwright)&quot;. In May 2011, they appeared with various artists in A Celebration of Kate McGarrigle at New York City&#x27;s Town Hall to commemorate the passing of the Wainwrights&#x27; mother, who had succumbed to cancer the previous year. A DVD was released in 2013. In August 2012, Bond officiated at Rufus Wainwright&#x27;s Long Island wedding.

==Activism==

Bond participated in the original Gay Shame event in New York in 1998, performing as Kiki and Herb and recorded in the Scott Berry documentary &quot;Gay Shame &#x27;98&quot;. On September 25, 2012, they hosted a special edition of Weimar as a fundraiser for the reelection of U.S. President Barack Obama. In November, Bond announced a performance to benefit the Ali Forney Center for LGBT youth in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Ahead of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they appeared in a video by Brooklyn-based Potpourri of Pearls, protesting Russian mistreatment of LGBT persons.

==Other projects==
In July 2009 Bond made an appearance on the Logo TV comedy series &quot;Jeffery &amp; Cole Casserole&quot;, playing a Catholic nun who serves as the principal of the show&#x27;s all-girl Catholic school.

In 2012, Bond announced the creation of a signature fragrance by Ralf Schwieger, a &quot;trans-scent&quot; for all genders named The Afternoon of a Faun after the French poem and modernist ballet of the same name, and issued under the French label . It was launched in February 2013, at Manhattan&#x27;s Museum of Arts and Design on Columbus Circle.

Bond received a 2012 Lambda Literary Award for the memoir &quot;Tango: My Childhood Backwards and in High Heels&quot;. Also in 2012, powerHouse Books released &quot;Susie Says&quot;, a picture book combining Gina Garan photos of the 1970s fashion doll, Susie Sad Eyes, with bon mots from Bond&#x27;s Twitter account.

In the summer of 2014, Bond curated and emceed a cabaret season at the Spiegeltent at the Bard SummerScape Festival in the Hudson Valley, New York. They are set to reprise this emcee role in summer 2015, with guests including Alan Cumming, Suzanne Vega, Martha Wainwright, Stephen Merritt, and Lea Delaria.

In July 2020 Bond was announced as part of the cast of Audible&#x27;s adaptation of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; series, playing the role of Desire of the Endless.

==Personal life==
Bond is transgender and has said, &quot;for me to claim to be either a man or a woman, feels like a lie. My identity falls somewhere in the middle and is constantly shifting.&quot; They undergo feminizing hormone therapy to appear more feminine, and reported feeling great as a result, noting that &quot;I like the way my body looks. Emotionally, it&#x27;s evened me out.&quot; They do not intend to undergo sex reassignment surgery, explaining that &quot;I like my penis, and I am keeping it, but I am creating a transbody—a physical record on my body and a medical record that I am a transgendered person.&quot; In 2011, Bond adopted the middle name of Vivian, identifying as Justin Vivian Bond instead of Justin Bond. They use the gender-inclusive honorific Mx. (in place of Ms./Mr.) and neopronoun v (with vself instead of her/himself), a reference to Bond&#x27;s middle name.

In concert at the end of 2014, Bond disclosed having received an invitation to return home for Thanksgiving, conditional upon leaving behind &quot;that fake woman.&quot; Acknowledging that &quot;a lot of trans-kids get kicked out of their homes,&quot; they mused. &quot;I didn&#x27;t until I was 51. So I think I&#x27;m gonna make it.&quot; Elsewhere, they have said that &quot;if it wasn&#x27;t for my family and the rage they engendered in me, I wouldn&#x27;t be here.&quot;

==Recognition and influence==
Bond was referenced in the 1999 Le Tigre song &quot;Hot Topic&quot;.

<text>Forrest Custer Smithson (September 26, 1884 – November 25, 1962) was an American athlete, winner of 110 m hurdles at the 1908 Summer Olympics.

Born in Portland, Oregon, Smithson was a student of theology from Oregon State University and an AAU champion in 1907 and 1909 in the hurdles.

At London, the main favourites were Smithson&#x27;s teammates John Garrels and Arthur Shaw, who had earlier equaled Alvin Kraenzlein&#x27;s world record of 15.2 seconds. The 110 m hurdles were not contested on a track as usual but on a special path in the stadium grass. Only Americans reached the final, which was contested on the last day of the London Games. Smithson defeated Garrels and set a new world record of 15.0 seconds.

Forrest Smithson died in Contra Costa County, California, aged 78.

==Bible story==
There is a widespread story about Smithson winning the gold medal while carrying a Bible in his left hand (ostensibly to protest against the decision to run the 110 m hurdles final on a Sunday). At first, neither the 110 m hurdles heats nor the final were scheduled or planned to take place on Sunday. The story was not mentioned in the newspapers. This story is based on a picture published in the official report, which was taken during the final.

The fact was that Forrest Smithson was a strong Christian and often ran with a Bible in his hand to point people to the source of his strength and inspiration; his relationship with Jesus Christ.

<doc id="888127" wikidata="Q1431963" url="?curid=888127" title="Rx Bandits">
<text>Rx Bandits are a band based in Seal Beach, California, United States. The band formed in 1995 in Orange County, California. They have appeared on the Vans Warped Tour, at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, and The Bamboozle. In the UK they have appeared at Reading/Leeds Festival &amp; Slam Dunk Festival.

==History==

===Early years (1995-1999)===
Originally known as The Pharmaceutical Bandits, the band began their career by participating in the third wave ska revival of the 1990s. In 1996, they released their first studio album, the self-produced &quot;Demo(nstration)&quot;. In 1997, they released &quot;Those Damn Bandits&quot;, which featured guest appearances by Jimmy the Robot of the Aquabats and Chris Colonnier of Jeffries Fan Club and The Forces of Evil. Noting the Bandits&#x27; potential, a Los Angeles Times review of the album said &quot;Now comes a young, talented ska band, the Pharmaceutical Bandits. It would be OK with me if the Grinch spared them but swiped their ska records and left a shelf of Who, Clash, Bob Marley, Elvis Costello and Neil Young.&quot; Matt Embree attended Los Alamitos High School, which was an incubator for other third wave ska bands such as Reel Big Fish, Save Ferris, and The Scholars.

===Drive-Thru years (1999-2006)===
In 1998, the band released &quot;Halfway Between Here and There&quot;. On this album, the band began to branch out beyond the third wave ska sound.

The album&#x27;s success allowed them to tour with well-known acts such as The Bloodhound Gang, Goldfinger, and Reel Big Fish, and later to headline shows with up-and-comers such as New Found Glory and Freakdaddy frequently opening for them.

In 1999, the album was re-released with a new track list, 2 remastered songs, and new artwork. The &#x27;99 release was released under the band&#x27;s new name—Rx Bandits.

In the time between &quot;Halfway Between Here and There&quot; and their next release, &quot;Progress&quot;, bassist Franz Worth and saxophonist Noah Gaffney left the band. Worth was replaced by James Salomone, formerly of My Superhero. Gaffney&#x27;s position was left open. In June 2000, the band toured the US with Edna&#x27;s Goldfish and the Gadjits.

With 2001&#x27;s &quot;Progress&quot;, the band continued to expand their sound. The album contained the song &quot;Analog Boy&quot;, which was made into one of their three music videos. At this point, the band consisted of Embree, Tsagakis, Balling, and Salomone. The album included a number of guest performers, including former member Noah Gaffney.

Shortly after the release of the album, Chris Sheets joined the band on trombone as well as Steve Choi on guitar and keyboards. Choi had played keyboards on the demos for Progress, but when it came time to record, they decided instead to have Rich Zahniser of The Hippos, who was touring with the band, play on the album. Chris Colonnier also played with the band at times, filling the same role as Zahniser. Soon after they gained the new members, James Salomone and Rich Balling left the band. They had many temporary replacements for Salomone, most notably Johnny Tsagakis, Chris&#x27; younger brother, but eventually Joe Troy, a longtime friend of Embree, who helped to write the song &quot;What If?&quot; on &quot;Halfway Between Here and There,&quot; joined the band as their bass player. Balling was replaced by saxophonist Steve Borth, who had played formerly in the popular East Bay ska punk band Link 80. Their line-up of Embree, Tsagakis, Sheets, Choi, Troy and Borth would go on to create the next two albums, &quot;The Resignation&quot; and &quot;...And the Battle Begun&quot;.

2003 saw the release of &quot;The Resignation&quot;, a CD/DVD combination. Guitars, bass, drums, and some keyboards were all recorded live in studio, and vocals, horns, percussion and additional keyboard parts were then overdubbed. The band allowed themselves a limited number of takes for each part, and once a take was recorded it was left as it was - no punch-ins were allowed. Embree shared songwriting duties with Steve Choi, whereas Embree had previously been responsible for all of the band&#x27;s material. &quot;The Resignation&quot; became the first album to debut the Billboard 200. It was charted No. 5 on the Top Heatseekers chart.

Musically, the album continued to branch out beyond &quot;Progress&quot; into new musical territory, including experimentation with unconventional time signatures. &quot;The Resignation&quot; featured overtly political lyrics as the band evolved even further from their ska-punk days as the Pharmaceutical Bandits, a subject that drummer Chris Tsagakis commented on in an interview conducted by former member Rich Balling for Skratch Magazine:

The album cover of &quot;The Resignation&quot; is an original composition called &quot;Predictable&quot; by Aaron Nagel, a Bay Area artist and member of both Link 80 and DESA.

In 2004, the band released a DVD of live performances that were filmed during their many live shows. It was one of the first released on Embree&#x27;s Mash Down Babylon Record label (aka MDB Records). It contains two Easter Eggs: a performance of the song &quot;Up to No Good&quot;, the only song recorded during the sessions for &quot;The Resignation&quot; that was not included on the album as well as studio footage of the band working on the album. During the DVD&#x27;s slide show, the background music is performed by Apotheke, a side project run by several members of the band.

===MDB/Sargent House===
&quot;...And the Battle Begun&quot; was initially released online on June 24, 2006, and was made available for purchase during the band&#x27;s 2006 US Tour. The album&#x27;s title refers to the poetry of Lord Byron, in which the phrase appears repeatedly.

The album was originally slated to be released in 2005 through Drive-Thru Records (with one album left on their contract), but for unspecified reasons, the band and label chose to part ways, causing lengthy delays in the release date. Finally free of any legal setbacks, the CD was made available via online order from MDB Records and on specified tour dates. Officially it debuted in retail stores in October 2006, after which the band performed a Northeastern CD release tour to promote the album.

On June 28, 2006, the band announced via their MySpace page that saxophone player and backup vocalist Steve Borth had left the Rx Bandits to pursue his own band, Satori. This announcement came in the midst of their 2006 US Summer Tour to the surprise of many fans. Borth played his final show with the Rx Bandits on Tuesday, June 27, 2006, at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City.

In conjunction with Refused TV, the Bandits recorded a music video for the title track off &quot;...And the Battle Begun&quot;. It is only their second music video since the making of a video for &quot;Analog Boy&quot; in 2001, and their first independently produced video for the song &quot;I Will Live&quot; on the Those Damn Bandits album. The &quot;I Will Live&quot; video was never officially released, although some bootleg copies still exist.

They released their live set from the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival 2007 exclusively on the iTunes Store. &quot;Live from Bonnaroo 2007&quot; is currently only available for download from the U.S. iTunes Store.

During the summer of 2008 the band did a headlining tour with support from Portugal. The Man, Maps &amp; Atlases, Kay Kay and His Weathered Underground and Facing New York.

Cathy Pellow of Sargent House announced via the Rx Bandits fan site plans for a live DVD featuring their live performance at the Glasshouse in Pomona, CA on August 22, 2008, as well as interviews and footage from the writing and recording for the next album. That writing and rehearsing process saw the departure of Chris Sheets, leaving the band a four-piece and without horns for the first time in its history.

===&quot;Mandala&quot; (2009-2011)===
&quot;Mandala&quot; was released as a digital download on July 14, 2009, and the CD was released on July 21, 2009, on Sargent House. They then headed out on a co-headlining tour with Dredg with revolving support from Good Old War, Zechs Marquise and As Tall As Lions. This album peaked No. 117 on the Billboard 200.

On January 4, 2010, the band announced some U.S. tour dates starting in March with support from Zechs Marquise and The Builders And The Butchers. This tour featured a 3-night stand at The Gramercy Theatre in New York City, where they performed (in their entirety) &quot;The Resignation&quot;, &quot;...And The Battle Begun&quot;, and &quot;Mandala&quot; on each respective night (an album per show). They recruited some close friends to play horns for these shows. In September 2010, they had a similar run of shows at The Troubador in Los Angeles. The full album shows from The Troubador were recorded live and the audio was released by the band via flashdrive.

===Last Summer Tour (2011)===
On April 12, 2011, the band announced that their forthcoming summer U.S. tour would be their last. A brief statement was given by the band:

The tour was composed of 36 shows spanning from May 4, 2011, to August 7, 2011.

Fans first believed the announcement to mean that the band was breaking up when, in fact, they are simply stopping their summer tours. Steve Choi has confirmed this in a &quot;Playmaker&quot; interview:

===Brazilian Tour (2012)===
On May 30, 2012, Rx Bandits announced that they would be performing a series of dates in Brazil during the summer, effectively ending their year-long hiatus.

===&quot;The Resignation&quot; Tenth Anniversary Tour and New EP (2013)===
Rx Bandits toured the United States during the summer of 2013 to mark the tenth anniversary of the release of &quot;The Resignation&quot;. The band released an EP featuring covers of The Police, Blonde Redhead, Weezer, Fugazi, and King Crimson.

===&quot;Gemini, Her Majesty&quot; (2014)===
During their special acoustic performance in their hometown of Long Beach, California on December 14, 2013, Embree stated that a new album is halfway written and Rx Bandits will be together again.

The band released a demo recording on January 26, 2014, through PledgeMusic. The track is tentatively titled, &quot;Ready Eddie&quot; . The official cut of the track has since been released, and is called &quot;Stargazer&quot;, the first track recorded for the new album.

On June 6, 2014, the band announced via Twitter that their new album will be called &quot;Gemini, Her Majesty&quot;, and it was released on July 22, 2014.

In December 2014 the band played two nights at The Glasshouse in Pomona, CA. The first night was dedicated to playing through Gemini, Her Majesty in its entirety, followed by a six-song encore set with horn players. The second night was a fan-made setlist featuring the horn section again, including many older fan favorites from The Resignation.

In 2015, the band toured with Circa Survive for their &quot;Juturna&quot; 10-year anniversary tour. Drummer Chris Tsagakis was unable to tour during this time, and his role was filled by Javier Torres. The band played as a four piece on this tour, and no horn players were present.

In 2016, the band embarked on a 10-year anniversary tour of &quot;And the Battle Begun&quot;, which featured Matt Embree and Steve Choi, but with Javier Torres on drums and Matt Fazzi on bass. Long-time bassist Joe Troy was absent from the tour. Chris Tsagakis stated that he was no longer touring with the band to focus on being a father. Andrew Bornstein also played trombone on this tour, as well as Dennis Passley on saxophone. Since this tour, the band has remained inactive and there seem to be no future plans to tour. Since then, Matt Embree has filled in on tours for numerous bands, and is currently touring with the band Dispatch. He also recorded/engineered the latest Dan P and the Bricks&#x27; album.

In 2019, the band announced they would be performing at the House of Blues in Anaheim, California on January 24, 2020, with support from Anthony Green and VIS.

In 2022, the band toured with Nova Charisma.

On November 10, 2023, Steve Choi, on the &#x27;Football, Beer &amp; Punk Rock Podcast&#x27;, confirmed the band are working on a new album and are back with Sargent House.

On November 15, 2023, the band announced via &#x27;X&#x27; (formerly Twitter) that they would be performing a series of 8 shows across the U.S. in March 2024 for the 20-year anniversary of The Resignation.

==Side projects==
Over the years, several members found time for side projects.

Embree and Chris Tsagakis can also be found in The Sound of Animals Fighting as “Walrus” and “Lynx,” respectively. The group was founded by former Rx Bandits trombonist Rich Balling. Joe Troy, Chris Sheets, and Steve Choi have performed live with the band, which also includes Anthony Green (Saosin, Circa Survive) and Craig Owens (Chiodos vocalist) as well as members of Finch and Days Away.

Steve Borth played with the Northern California skacore band, Link 80, signed to Asian Man Records. He later started the reggae/rocksteady band Satori which has also featured Embree on bass, members of The Exit, and Chris Murray.

Steve Choi collaborated with Asian Man Records founder Mike Park in both The Chinkees and The Bruce Lee Band. The Rx Bandits were featured as Park&#x27;s Bruce Lee Band during the recording of the Beautiful World EP. Choi is also a member of the band Machines, in which he plays the drums.

September 9, 2008 saw the release of Matt Embree&#x27;s acoustic side project, entitled Love You Moon. The album consists solely of Matt on the acoustic guitar with the exception of 3 tracks where Chris Tsagakis assists on drums. This album was presold at the Rx Bandits&#x27; concurrent tour. He also released an EP of covers entitled &quot;Maracay&quot; during the last Rx tour. The album was recorded during a trip to Venezuela and all proceeds went to Doctors Without Borders.

Embree and Tsagakis have also played guitar and drums, respectively, with Lauren Coleman in her project, Pebaluna. The three met when she was recording in the Elizabethan in late 2005.

Matt Embree can also be heard on other projects such as those of the hip-hop group Seekret Socyetee, 2 Drunk&#x27;n Poets, and V.I.T.A.L. Emcee&#x27;s solo album, &quot;The Secret of the Invisible Man&quot;, all of which have been released on Embree&#x27;s MDB Records.

Tsagakis is recording and performing solo material under the name C-Gak. He also released an album under the moniker of Technology.

Embree also started a new group with Lisa Papineau named ME &amp; LP. They released their first EP Chez Raymond on August 9, 2011, and toured the West Coast.

Choi is currently producing bands, recently working with Silver Snakes, Gardening Not Architecture and The Velvet Teen.

Embree and Tsagakis released an album as Biceratops in November 2012.

<text>Mississippi Nights was a music club in St. Louis, Missouri. It opened on October 11, 1976 and was located at 914 N 1st Street, on the western bank of the Mississippi River, four blocks north of the Gateway Arch in Laclede&#x27;s Landing.

Concerts at the venue, which held up to 1,000 people, were often &quot;all ages&quot; events, with just over one percent restricted to patrons 21 and over.

The club is the subject of on the album &quot;Venue Songs&quot; by They Might Be Giants. George Thorogood &amp; the Destroyers&#x27; album &quot;&quot; features tracks recorded at Mississippi Nights.

==Closure==
In early 2003, rumors began circulating that the club would close to make way for Horseshoe St. Louis (at the time known as Lumière Place), a new casino development. The rumors were confirmed in early 2007, and the last show was held on January 19, 2007.

The last band to play on its stage was The Urge fronted by a band member from Mudworm, which also played. The Urge sold out 93 of 100 shows at Mississippi Nights.

<text>The Navy Commendation Star or Navy Letter of Commendation Star was a Department of the Navy personal military decoration issued as ribbon device which was authorized in 1918 to be &quot;placed&quot; on the World War I Victory Medal. A inch silver star was issued to any service member of the Navy and Marine Corps who had been cited and commended by the Secretary of the Navy for performance of duty. Among the recipients of the Commendation Star was future Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz.

The Navy Commendation Star was placed on the suspension and service ribbon of the World War I Victory Medal, above all battle clasps. When the star was worn on the medal&#x27;s service ribbon, the star was placed before all bronze service stars. The Navy Commendation Star was identical to the United States Army Citation Star which also was a inch silver star worn on the World War I Victory Medal to denote a soldier (or a marine or Navy corpsman attached to the Second Division), was cited for gallantry in action and awarded a citation. Unlike the Citation Star, however, the Navy Commendation Star could not be converted to the Silver Star Medal (1932).

At the start of the Second World War, the Navy Commendation Star was declared obsolete and none were issued between 1941 and 1945. In the 1950s, the Department of the Navy began accepting applications from eligible World War I veterans authorized a Navy Commendation Star for conversion to the Navy Commendation Ribbon with Metal Pendant, and in 1960, to the Navy Commendation Medal. In 1994, an authorized Navy Commendation Star could be exchanged for the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal.

<doc id="888137" wikidata="Q1049712" url="?curid=888137" title="Texians">
<text>Texians were Anglo-American residents of Mexican Texas and, later, citizens of the Republic of Texas. Today, the term is used to identify early Anglo settlers of Texas, especially those who supported the Texas Revolution. Mexican settlers of that era are referred to as Tejanos, and American citizens of the modern State of Texas regardless of race and ethnicity are known as Texans.

==History==

===Colonial settlement===
Many different settler groups came to Texas over the centuries. Spanish colonists in the 17th century linked Texas to the rest of New Spain. French and English traders and settlers arrived in the 18th century, and more numerous German, Dutch, Swedish, Irish, Scottish, Scots-Irish, and Welsh settled in the years leading up to Texas independence in 1836. Before Texas became a sovereign state in 1836, Texian referred to any resident, of any race, color or language.

In 18341836, the Texian Army was organized for the Texas Revolution of independence from Mexico, a nation which had won its independence from Spain in 1821. Although the Texian army was predominantly made up of Anglo-Americans who traced their ancestries to Colonial America, it was a diverse group of people from many different nations and states. The Texian Army was composed of Tejano volunteers, volunteers from the Southern United States; and immigrants directly from Europe including countries like England, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Portugal, and what is now the Czech Republic. Used in this sense, terms like &quot;Texian Army&quot;, &quot;Texian forces&quot;, or &quot;Texian troops&quot; would refer to any of the inhabitants of Texas, in that era, who participated in the Texas Revolution.

===Republic of Texas===
Texian was a popular demonym, used by Texas colonists, for all the people of the Republic of Texas (1836–1846), before it became a U.S. state. This term was used by early colonists and public officials, including many Texas residents, and President Mirabeau Lamar frequently used it to foster Texas nationalism.

Over time, the English-speaking Americans in Texas began to champion the usage of &quot;Texan&quot; instead of &quot;Texian&quot;. Overwhelming numbers in the United States used the term Texan. Due to the 19th-century influx of Americans into the Republic and later U.S. state of Texas, Texan became the standard term after 1850. 

The &quot;Texas Almanac&quot; of 1857 bemoaned the shift in usage, saying 
&quot;Texian...has more euphony, and is better adapted to the conscience of poets who shall hereafter celebrate our deeds in sonorous strains than the harsh, abrupt, ungainly, appellation, Texan—impossible to rhyme with anything but the merest doggerel.&quot; The &quot;Almanac&quot; continued to use the earlier term until 1868. Many who had lived through the times of Revolution and Republic continued to call themselves Texians into the 20th century.

<doc id="888140" wikidata="Q2714114" url="?curid=888140" title="Stock and flow">
<text>Economics, business, accounting, and related fields often distinguish between quantities that are stocks and those that are flows. These differ in their units of measurement. A &quot;stock&quot; is measured at one specific time, and represents a quantity existing at that point in time (say, December 31, 2004), which may have accumulated in the past. A &quot;flow&quot; variable is measured over an interval of time. Therefore, a flow would be measured &quot;per unit of time&quot; (say a year). Flow is roughly analogous to rate or speed in this sense.

For example, U.S. nominal gross domestic product refers to a total number of dollars spent over a time period, such as a year. Therefore, it is a flow variable, and has units of dollars/year. In contrast, the U.S. nominal capital stock is the total value, in dollars, of equipment, buildings, and other real productive assets in the U.S. economy, and has units of dollars. The diagram provides an intuitive illustration of how the &quot;stock&quot; of capital currently available is increased by the &quot;flow&quot; of new investment and depleted by the &quot;flow&quot; of depreciation.

==Stocks and flows in accounting==
Thus, a stock refers to the value of an asset at a balance date (or point in time), while a flow refers to the total value of transactions (sales or purchases, incomes or expenditures) during an accounting period. If the flow value of an economic activity is divided by the average stock value during an accounting period, we obtain a measure of the number of turnovers (or rotations) of a stock in that accounting period. Some accounting entries are normally always represented as a flow (e.g. profit or income), while others may be represented both as a stock or as a flow (e.g. capital).

A person or country might have stocks of money, financial assets, liabilities, wealth, real means of production, capital, inventories, and human capital (or labor power). Flow magnitudes include income, spending, saving, debt repayment, fixed investment, inventory investment, and labor utilization. These differ in their units of measurement.
Capital is a stock concept which yields a periodic income which is a flow concept.

==Comparing stocks and flows==

Stocks and flows have different units and are thus not &quot;commensurable&quot; – they cannot be meaningfully &quot;compared, equated, added, or subtracted.&quot; However, one may meaningfully take &quot;ratios&quot; of stocks and flows, or multiply or divide them. This is a point of some confusion for some economics students, as some confuse taking ratios (valid) with comparing (invalid).

The ratio of a stock over a flow has units of (units)/(units/time) = time. For example, the debt to GDP ratio has units of years (as GDP is measured in, for example, dollars per year whereas debt is measured in dollars), which yields the interpretation of the debt to GDP ratio as &quot;number of years to pay off all debt, assuming all GDP devoted to debt repayment&quot;.

The ratio of a flow to a stock has units 1/time. For example, the velocity of money is defined as nominal GDP / nominal money supply; it has units of (dollars / year) / dollars = 1/year.

In discrete time, the change in a stock variable from one point in time to another point in time one time unit later (the first difference of the stock) is equal to the corresponding flow variable per unit of time. For example, if a country&#x27;s stock of physical capital on January 1, 2010 is 20 machines and on January 1, 2011 is 23 machines, then the flow of net investment during 2010 was 3 machines per year. If it then has 27 machines on January 1, 2012, the flow of net investment during 2010 and 2011 averaged formula_1 machines per year.

In continuous time, the time derivative of a stock variable is a flow variable.

==More general uses==

Stocks and flows also have natural meanings in many contexts outside of economics, business and related fields. The concepts apply to many conserved quantities such as energy, and to materials such as in stoichiometry, water reservoir management, and greenhouse gases and other durable pollutants that accumulate in the environment or in organisms. Climate change mitigation, for example, is a fairly straightforward stock and flow problem with the primary goal of reducing the stock (the concentration of durable greenhouse gases in the atmosphere) by manipulating the flows (reducing inflows such as greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, and increasing outflows such as carbon dioxide removal). In living systems, such as the human body, energy homeostasis describes the linear relationship between flows (the food we eat and the energy we expend along with the wastes we excrete) and the stock (manifesting as our gain or loss of body weight over time). In Earth system science, many stock and flow problems arise, such as in the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the water cycle, and Earth&#x27;s energy budget. Thus stocks and flows are the basic building blocks of system dynamics models. Jay Forrester originally referred to them as &quot;levels&quot; rather than stocks, together with &quot;rates&quot; or &quot;rates of flow&quot;.

A stock (or &quot;level variable&quot;) in this broader sense is some entity that is accumulated over time by inflows and/or depleted by outflows. Stocks can only be changed via flows. Mathematically a stock can be seen as an accumulation or integration of flows over time – with outflows subtracting from the stock. Stocks typically have a certain value at each moment of time – e.g. the number of population at a certain moment, or the quantity of water in a reservoir.

A flow (or &quot;rate&quot;) changes a stock over time. Usually we can clearly distinguish inflows (adding to the stock) and outflows (subtracting from the stock). Flows typically are measured over a certain interval of time – e.g., the number of births over a day or month.

===Accounting, finance, etc.===
===Other contexts===
==Calculus interpretation==
If the quantity of some &quot;stock&quot; variable at time formula_2 is formula_3, then the derivative formula_4 is the &quot;flow&quot; of changes in the stock. Likewise, the &quot;stock&quot; at some time formula_5 is the integral of the &quot;flow&quot; from some moment set as zero until time formula_5.

For example, if the capital stock formula_7 is increased gradually over time by a flow of gross investment formula_8 and decreased gradually over time by a flow of depreciation formula_9, then the instantaneous rate of change in the capital stock is given by

: formula_10

where the notation formula_11 refers to the flow of net investment, which is the difference between gross investment and depreciation.

==History==
The distinction between a stock and a flow variable is elementary, and dates back centuries in accounting practice (distinction between an asset and income, for instance). In economics, the distinction was formalized and terms were set in , in which Irving Fisher formalized capital (as a stock).

Polish economist Michał Kalecki emphasized the centrality of the distinction of stocks and flows, caustically calling economics &quot;the science of confusing stocks with flows&quot; in his critique of the quantity theory of money (circa 1936, frequently quoted by Joan Robinson).

The company is a primarily direct reinsurer and is represented in all major reinsurance markets worldwide through a network of more than 40 offices. Gen Re is a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

* Moody&#x27;s Financial Strength Rating: Aa1

&quot;General Re Corporation&quot; is the holding company for Gen Re&#x27;s global reinsurance and related operations. It owns &quot;General Reinsurance Corporation&quot;, &quot;General Re Life Corporation&quot; and &quot;General Reinsurance AG&quot;, the direct reinsurers which conduct business as Gen Re. In addition, the insurance, reinsurance and investment management companies in the General Re group include: &quot;Gen Re Intermediaries&quot;, &quot;NEAM&quot;, &quot;General Star&quot;, &quot;Genesis&quot;, &quot;USAU&quot; and &quot;Faraday&quot;.

==History==
General Reinsurance Corporation’s history began in 1921 as the &quot;General Casualty and Surety Reinsurance Corporation&quot;, before it took over the U.S. business of the Norwegian Globe Insurance Company of Christiania, Norway.

In 1923, American investors acquired the company and changed the name to &quot;General Reinsurance Corporation&quot;.

In 1928, the &quot;General Alliance Corporation&quot; was organized to acquire and hold the shares of General Reinsurance Corporation, as well as a half interest in the holdings of the &quot;Royal Exchange Assurance Group (London)&quot; in the &quot;United British Insurance Co., Ltd.&quot; 

In 1929, the General Alliance Corporation owned all the stock of General Reinsurance Corporation, and jointly with the Royal Exchange Group, a controlling interest in the United British. The United British Insurance Co., Ltd. established a U.S. branch that transacted casualty reinsurance as a &quot;running mate for the General, and has the same management as the General. The two companies transact practically all forms of casualty and surety reinsurance and constitute the first example of a &#x27;Group&#x27; in the history of American casualty reinsurance.&quot;

Also in 1929, General Reinsurance affirmed that it would be only a direct reinsurer. In 1945, General Reinsurance merged with &quot;Mellon Indemnity Corporation&quot;. In 1954, the company created the first professional casualty facultative reinsurance department. Property facultative followed, beginning in 1956. North America branch offices were opened during this time. In the 1950s, General Reinsurance began writing reinsurance internationally, expanding in this area during the 1960s and 1970s. The company continued to grow through the next two decades, opening more U.S. and Canada branch offices and making various acquisitions. The company moved its headquarters from New York City to Greenwich, Connecticut in 1974, and then to Stamford, Connecticut in 1984. In 1980, &quot;General Re Corporation&quot;, the parent holding company, was formed and listed on the New York Stock Exchange as GRN.

In 1994, General Reinsurance Corporation formed an alliance with what was then &quot;Cologne Re&quot; (Kölnische Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft, which was founded in 1846), now &quot;General Reinsurance AG&quot;. In 1998, General Re Corporation was acquired by &quot;Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&quot;, and in 2003 General Reinsurance Corporation and Cologne Re began marketing under the brand name of &quot;Gen Re&quot;. In 2009, General Reinsurance Corporation completed its purchase of Cologne Re, whose name was changed to General Reinsurance AG in 2010.

===AIG Securities Fraud===

In October 2000, some Wall Street analysts questioned the decline in American International Group (AIG) loss reserves. In an effort to quell these concerns, AIG entered into two sham reinsurance transactions with Cologne Re Dublin, a subsidiary of General Reinsurance, that had no economic substance but were designed to add $500 million in phony loss reserves to AIG’s balance sheet in the fourth quarter of 2000 and first quarter of 2001.

In 2005, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer began an investigation into the two reinsurance transactions. Soon afterwards, AIG came under market pressure, and admitted it had undertaken what could be construed as securities fraud. The staff admitted that the two reinsurance transactions had inflated AIG’s balance sheet and propped up AIG’s stock price. In the resultant stock crash, investors lost $500 million in investments.

Cologne Re Dublin&#x27;s CEO, John Houldsworth, agreed to turn state&#x27;s witness for the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission, in agreement for a plea bargain. Houldsworth then pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit securities fraud, resultantly facing a sentence of up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. The final sentencing was placed on hold, subject to consequential SEC prosecutions.

The DOJ subsequently undertook successful prosecutions against four former Gen Re executives and one former AIG executive: CEO Ronald Ferguson was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $200,000; CFO Elizabeth Monrad was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $250,000; Senior Vice President Christopher Garand was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and fined $150,000; Senior Vice President and Assistant General Counsel Robert Graham was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and fined $100,000; AIG&#x27;s Vice President Christian Milton was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $200,000.

In 2009, in front of U.S. District Judge Christopher Droney in Hartford, Houldsworth apologized. As a result, he was fined $5,000 and ordered to perform 400 hours of community service during a two-year probation period.

On August 1, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the five Gen Re and AIG defendants’ convictions and remanded the defendants for a new trial, holding that the reported drop in share prices could not be attributed to the two reinsurance deals.

====Resolution====
&quot;In June 2012, the U.S. government agreed to not pursue any further legal action against the former Gen Re executives pursuant to deferred prosecution agreements that have since expired and are no longer in effect. As a result, the government matter is fully and finally resolved. Civil litigation related to the AIG matter has also been fully and finally resolved. The lead plaintiffs and Gen Re reached a settlement agreement which the court approved pursuant to a final order entered on September 11, 2013.&quot;

==Office locations==
Gen Re&#x27;s headquarters are in Stamford, Connecticut.

In North America, Gen Re also operates in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Hartford, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Montreal, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, South Portland, St. Paul and Toronto.

Gen Re further operates in Latin America (Mexico City, São Paulo), Europe/Middle East (Cologne, Copenhagen, Dubai, London, Madrid, Milan, Moscow, Paris, Vienna), Africa (Cape Town, Johannesburg), Asia (Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo) and Australasia (Auckland, Sydney).

<doc id="888152" wikidata="Q765087" url="?curid=888152" title="Fruit of the Loom">
<text>Fruit of the Loom is an American company that manufactures clothing, particularly casual wear and underwear. The company&#x27;s world headquarters are located in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Since 2002, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway.

Products manufactured by Fruit of the Loom itself and through its subsidiaries include clothing (t-shirts, hoodies, jackets, sweatpants, shorts and lingerie), and sports equipment (softballs and basketballs) manufactured and commercialized by Spalding.

== Company profile ==
Fruit of the Loom is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of underwear, printable T-shirts and fleece for the activewear industry, casualwear, women&#x27;s jeanswear, and childrenswear. The company employs more than 32,400 people worldwide.

The company is a vertically integrated manufacturer. In 2006, Fruit of the Loom acquired Russell Brands, LLC, a global company whose brands included Russell Athletic, Brooks Running, and Spalding, among other names in athletic wear. The purchase amount was $600 million.

=== Logo misconception ===
The company&#x27;s logo has been the subject of a misconception amongst the public. The company&#x27;s logo comprises a red apple, leaves, green grapes, purple grapes, and white currants (or yellow gooseberries), but not a cornucopia. In July 2023, a Snopes reporter said that a search of newspaper advertisements between the 1920s and 2020s revealed none that depicted a cornucopia, despite many consumers recalling that the trademark did contain one. The misconception is often cited as an example of the Mandela Effect.

==History==
===Rhode Island beginnings===
The origin of the Fruit of the Loom company dates back to 1851 in Rhode Island, when textile mill owner Robert Knight and his brother Benjamin established the &quot;B.B. and R. Knight Corporation&quot; after they acquired the Pontiac Mills in Warwick, Rhode Island. In 1856, the company introduced the brand name &quot;Fruit of the Loom&quot;, while producing its first muslins.

A friend of Robert Knight named Rufus Skeel owned a small shop in Providence that sold cloth from Knight&#x27;s mill. Skeel&#x27;s daughter painted images of apples and applied them to the bolts of cloth. The ones with the apple emblems proved most popular. Knight thought the labels would be the perfect symbol for his trade name, Fruit of the Loom – an expression referring to clothes, paralleling the phrase &quot;fruit of the womb&quot;, which can be traced back to the Bible (Psalm 127:3).

In 1871, just one year after the first trademark laws were passed by Congress, Knight received trademark number 418 for the brand &quot;Fruit of the Loom&quot;. Much of its athletic outerwear was sold under the &quot;Pro Player&quot; label, a now defunct division.

===20th century===

The company was part of Northwest Industries, Inc., until NWI was purchased by William F. Farley in 1985 and renamed Farley Industries, Inc.

Farley served as president, CEO, and majority shareholder for 15 years. Fruit of the Loom&#x27;s sales revenue rose from approximately US$500 million at the time of NWI&#x27;s purchase (equivalent to $ billion in ) to roughly US$2.5 billion nearly 15 years later (equivalent to $ billion in ), about a three-fold increase after inflation. Debt financing proved difficult to manage, however, even as dollar sales revenue quintupled.

On March 23, 1987, the company sold its subsidiary General Battery to Exide Corporation.

In the 1990s, the American textile industry overall experienced widespread downsizing in the wake of North American Free Trade Agreement and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

In 1995, Chairman Farley announced that the company would close six plants in the Southeastern United States, and cut back operations at two others. Operations were moved to cheaper plants abroad. 3,200 workers, or about 12 percent of its American work force, were laid off. Farley also announced that company earnings fell 22 percent, despite a 10 percent increase in sales.

In 1999, Fruit of the Loom filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, shortly after posting a net loss of $576.2 million. including structuring the company into an off-shore entity in the Cayman Islands to avoid taxes.

===21st century===
The company was bought from bankruptcy by Berkshire Hathaway Corporation, controlled by investor Warren Buffett, who wanted the valuable brand. He agreed in January 2002 to purchase the company for approximately $835 million in cash. The deal was concluded on April 29, 2002. A condition of the purchase required that former COO and then interim CEO John Holland remain available to be the CEO for the company.

The company purchased Russell Brands, LLC, effectively taking the former competitor private, in a deal valued at $598.3 million that was completed August 1, 2006.

The company announced the purchase of VF Corporation&#x27;s intimate apparel company named Vanity Fair Intimates for $350 million in cash on January 23, 2007. This company was renamed Vanity Fair Brands and is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary.

In 2010, Rick Medlin was named president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom. Longtime CEO John Holland became the company&#x27;s chairman. In 2014, the company closed its Jamestown, Kentucky, plant, which had once been the second manufacturing plant in the state, and laid off all 600 employees. The company acknowledged it was moving the plant&#x27;s operations to Honduras to reduce production costs.

In December 2016, Melissa Burgess Taylor was named chairman and CEO of Fruit of the Loom by Buffett after the death of Rick Medlin.

<text>Pampered Chef is a multinational multi-level marketing company that offers a line of kitchen tools, food products, and cookbooks for preparing food in the home.

It has a worldwide direct sales force of about 35,000 in addition to 400 corporate staff. The company is headquartered in Addison, Illinois, and operates in five countries: the United States, Germany, Canada, Austria, and France.

==History==
Doris Christopher founded Pampered Chef in 1980 in the basement of her suburban Chicago home. Christopher came up with a party plan to offer kitchen tools directly to consumers through in-home cooking demonstrations, a concept first popularized by Tupperware. The company expanded to Canada in 1996, the UK in 1999, Germany in 2000, Austria in 2019, and France in 2020.

The company was acquired in 2002 by Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway corporation. On October 30, 2014, Berkshire Hathaway appointed long time advisor Tracy Britt Cool to the position of CEO. According to Direct Selling News, &quot;the company’s revenue has fallen from $320 million in 2015 to $280 million in 2018.&quot; In March 2020, the company&#x27;s COO, Andrew Treanor, took over on the role of CEO. Nevena Srebreva, in turn, took over the CEO role in May 2024. She was Pampered Chef&#x27;s Chief Field &amp; International Officer prior to that. 

The company closed its UK business, and wound down UK operations as of December 31, 2015.

== Products ==

In 1990, Pampered Chef released a product known as the Valtrompia bread tube. The product is a metal tube in which refrigerated bread dough can be baked into a narrow, scalloped-edge loaf. As of the late 1990s, the product is available in five shapes—flower, square, heart, scalloped, and star. The bread is baked with the tube placed upright in the oven, allowing the bread to rise vertically along the tube.

== Lawsuit ==
In April 2023, Pampered Chef was sued for alleged data sharing and sharing video viewing history from people visiting the company website with Google and Facebook. In June 2023, Pampered Chef settled the lawsuit claiming they did share video viewing history of users.

<text>Paul David Graf (April 16, 1950 – April 7, 2001) was an American actor, best known for his role as Sgt. Eugene Tackleberry in the &quot;Police Academy&quot; series of films.

== Early life and education ==
Graf was born in Zanesville, Ohio, and later moved to Lancaster, Ohio, and graduated from Lancaster High School. He studied theatre at Otterbein College in Westerville, a suburb of Columbus, Ohio, where he graduated in 1972. He attended graduate school at Ohio State University until 1975, when he dropped out to pursue his acting career.

== Acting career ==
Graf made his first television appearance as a contestant on the game show &quot;The $20,000 Pyramid&quot; in December 1979, where he teamed with actress Patty Duke. He would later appear on subsequent versions of the show as a celebrity contestant, twice with Duke. As a struggling actor in the early 1980s, he also took small roles in popular TV shows, including &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, &quot;Airwolf&quot;, &quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot; and &quot;The A-Team&quot;.

He made his film debut in 1981 when he played Gergley in the drama &quot;Four Friends&quot;. Graf later played the trigger-happy Eugene Tackleberry in the 1984 comedy &quot;Police Academy&quot;, and starred in each of the sequels. In 1986, Graf had a role as Councilman Harlan Nash on the short-lived sitcom &quot;He&#x27;s the Mayor&quot;. In 1990, Graf appeared in the final two episodes of the series Beauty and the Beast. In 1992, Graf returned to play a minor role as a police officer again for the comedy series &quot;Seinfeld&quot; during its fourth-season episode &quot;The Ticket&quot; and also appeared on &quot;Night Court&quot;. He played Tackleberry for the final time in a guest appearance on the short-lived &quot;Police Academy: The Series&quot;. Also in November 1992, Graf appeared on &quot;Family Matters&quot; where he played Sgt. Shiska.

Graf made various guest appearances following his role in the &quot;Police Academy&quot; series, including a recurring role in &quot;The West Wing&quot;, several appearances in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode (&quot;The 37s&quot;) and &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. In the latter series, he played a Klingon called Leskit in the fifth-season episode &quot;Soldiers of the Empire&quot;.

Graf was Lt. Weismann in the movie &quot;Suture&quot; in 1993 and Ralph Brinker in the Disney Channel movie &quot;Brink!&quot; in 1998.

Graf made a guest appearance in an episode of the short-lived ABC sitcom &quot;Teen Angel&quot; as a camp leader for Steve Beauchamp&#x27;s little sister Katie, in the 1997–1998 season. In 2000, he made an appearance on &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; as a paramedic who accidentally swapped pagers with Amanda Bynes. He also made an appearance on &quot;Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; season 2 episode 20 as a reporter for the Daily Planet.

Graf had a small role in 1995&#x27;s &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot;, portraying Alice&#x27;s boyfriend Sam Franklin, the butcher. In 1996, Graf made a guest appearance in &quot;Promised Land&quot;, which was a spinoff of &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. He played the role of a grieving husband whose wife died while working for a company and he went there trying to find answers to her death.

Graf guest starred in several episodes of ABC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Step By Step&quot; in the 1990s. He also starred in the second episode of the third season of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Home Improvement&quot; as angler Chuck Norwood. Some of his last acting performances were two guest appearances as The Pentagon staff member Colonel Chase in the series &quot;The West Wing&quot; (&quot;The Drop-In&quot; and &quot;The Portland Trip&quot;) and as Jacques Douche in the &quot;Son of the Beach&quot; TV series episode &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. Graf&#x27;s last acting role was the Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;The Amanda Show&quot;, just three months before his death.

==Screen Actors Guild==
Besides his acting, Graf was a representative of the Screen Actors Guild. As well as serving as a Hollywood union rep, he was on SAG&#x27;s national board, TV-theatrical steering committee, and national disciplinary review committee. Graf sought fair treatment for his fellow actors and actresses, which included efforts for better working conditions for the acting community.

==Personal life==
Graf married Kathryn Graf in 1983. They had two sons.

==Death==
While attending his brother-in-law&#x27;s wedding in Phoenix, Arizona, on April 7, 2001, Graf died from a sudden heart attack at the age of 50. Graf is buried at Forest Rose Cemetery in Lancaster, Ohio.

<doc id="888170" wikidata="Q314245" url="?curid=888170" title="Jason Becker">
<text>Jason Eli Becker (born July 22, 1969) is an American composer and former guitarist. At the age of 16, he became part of the Shrapnel Records-produced duo Cacophony with his friend Marty Friedman, and they released two albums, &quot;Speed Metal Symphony&quot; (1987) and &quot;Go Off!&quot; (1988). Since the dissolution of Cacophony in 1989, Becker has undertaken a solo career, releasing seven albums since his 1988 debut &quot;Perpetual Burn&quot;. He later joined David Lee Roth&#x27;s solo band and recorded one album with him, &quot;A Little Ain&#x27;t Enough&quot;.

Becker&#x27;s performing career was cut short by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which he was diagnosed with in 1989. By 1996, Becker had lost the ability to speak, and he now communicates with his eyes via a system developed by his father. He continues to compose with the aid of a computer and has since released &quot;Collection&quot; in 2008 and &quot;Triumphant Hearts&quot; in 2018, as well as various compilations.

== Biography and career ==
=== Early years ===
Becker was born in Richmond Hospital on 23rd Street on July 22, 1969, and raised in Richmond, California, by his parents, Gary and Patricia (Heffley) Becker. His maternal grandfather was actor Wayne Heffley. He was exposed to the guitar at an early age by both his father and his uncle who were guitar players. He absorbed all kinds of music from around the world and melded different aspects of each style into his playing. He cited Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen as early influences.

===Cacophony and solo career===
Becker started out playing alongside Marty Friedman in the Mike Varney-produced duo, Cacophony. Together, they put out two albums, &quot;Speed Metal Symphony&quot; and &quot;Go Off!&quot; and toured Japan and the U.S. While they never went mainstream in the U.S., they proved popular enough in Europe to sell out almost every performance. In 1989 Becker joined David Lee Roth&#x27;s solo band, having released his first solo album titled &quot;Perpetual Burn&quot; in 1988, while Friedman joined Megadeth in 1990. He has since released the albums &quot;Perspective&quot;, &quot;Collection&quot; and &quot;Triumphant Hearts&quot;, as well as two albums of demos, entitled &quot;The Raspberry Jams&quot; and &quot;The Blackberry Jams&quot;.

===Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosis===
In 1989, Becker joined David Lee Roth&#x27;s solo band to work on his third album &quot;A Little Ain&#x27;t Enough&quot;, replacing Steve Vai, who left the band to record and tour with Whitesnake. While preparing for the album, Becker began to feel what he called a &quot;lazy limp&quot; in his left leg. He was soon diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease) and was given three to five years to live. He finished the recording using lighter gauge guitar strings and other techniques, which made it easier for him to play with his weakening hands. Although he managed to finish the album, he did not join the supporting tour due to his inability to perform on stage; former Lizzy Borden guitarist Joe Holmes took Becker&#x27;s place on tour.

His ALS gradually robbed him of his ability to play guitar, to walk, and eventually his ability to speak. He now communicates with his eyes via a system developed by his father. Due to the nature of the disease, he remains mentally sharp and, with the aid of a computer, continues composing. In the back of the &quot;Perspective&quot; CD case, Becker states &quot;I have Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. It has crippled my body and speech, but not my mind.&quot; His medical condition has remained stable since 1997. In 2003, Becker posted on his website that he was feeling better and had gained some weight, while the folder for his 2008 album &quot;Collection&quot; also mentions an upcoming book.

===&quot;Perspective&quot; and &quot;Raspberry Jams&quot;===
In 1996, Becker released an album called &quot;Perspective&quot;, an instrumental album composed by him (with the exception of Bob Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Meet Me in the Morning&quot;). The writing of the music had been started before ALS completely disabled his abilities. By using guitar, and, later, when he was unable to use both hands, a keyboard, he continued to compose while his disease worsened. However, when Becker could no longer even play the keyboard, his friend and music producer Mike Bemesderfer helped him with a music-composing computer program that reads movements of his head and eyes, enabling Becker to continue to compose after he lost control of the rest of his body.

Three years later, Becker released &quot;Raspberry Jams&quot; (1999) and &quot;Blackberry Jams&quot; (2003); the first contained various unreleased demo tracks, and the latter contained demo tracks and alternate versions of songs that were later reworked and published on other albums.

Two tribute albums to Jason Becker have been issued. Titled &quot;Warmth in the Wilderness I&quot; and &quot;Warmth in the Wilderness II,&quot; they feature guitarists such as Steve Vai, Paul Gilbert, Marty Friedman, Joe Becker, Rusty Cooley, and Mattias Eklundh. The album profits were sent to Becker to help him with his medical finances.

===&quot;Collection&quot;===

On November 4, 2008, Shrapnel Records released a new Becker album entitled &quot;Collection&quot;. The album includes three new songs in addition to some older recordings (some previously unreleased) and features Marty Friedman, Greg Howe, Joe Satriani, Michael Lee Firkins, Steve Vai, and Steve Hunter.
===&quot;Boy Meets Guitar&quot;===
On August 20, 2010, Becker declared that he was considering releasing an album of music he recorded when he was in his teenage years. He released this album, titled &quot;Boy Meets Guitar&quot;, in 2012.

===&quot;Triumphant Hearts&quot;===
In October 2016, Becker launched a campaign to fund an album, which was initially estimated for release in July 2017. The campaign raised more than $100,000. The album, &quot;Triumphant Hearts&quot;, was released on December 7, 2018.

==Musical style==
Considered a virtuoso guitarist and one of the top players of his time, Becker studied the works of violinist Niccolò Paganini and was a playing partner with Marty Friedman. He later arranged Paganini&#x27;s 5th Caprice, performing it during an instructional guitar video. Becker&#x27;s compositions often include high speed scalar and arpeggio passages—trademarks of his shred style of guitar playing. Often incorporating advanced techniques such as sweep picking, alternate picking, artificial harmonic accenting, tapping and hybrid picking; he was among the leaders of the field during the technical shred guitar and neoclassical metal trend of the mid to late 1980s and is still respected and honored by his musician peers today. The song &quot;Serrana&quot; appearing in the album &quot;Perspective&quot;, is an example of his sweep-picking skills. He demonstrated the arpeggio sequence during a clinic at the Atlanta Institute of Music. A video of this performance first appeared on his &quot;Hot Licks&quot; guitar instructional video.

==Influence on other guitarists==
Many guitarists cite Becker&#x27;s playing as an influence, including Nita Strauss, Guthrie Govan, Herman Li, Chris Broderick, and Daniel Mongrain, among others.

==Media==
Becker has appeared on many magazine covers throughout his career, including the February 1991 issue of &quot;Guitar for the Practicing Musician&quot; along with Jim Martin of Faith No More, the June 1991 issue of &quot;Young Guitar&quot;, and the July 2012 issue of &quot;Guitar Player&quot;, among others. He was also extensively interviewed for the 2017 book, &quot;Shredders!: The Oral History Of Speed Guitar (And More)&quot;, by author Greg Prato.

==Equipment==
Becker&#x27;s first guitar was a Franciscan acoustic. Prior to joining Cacophony in 1987, Becker worked his way through the Franciscan, a Takamine acoustic, a Fender Musicmaster, and finally, a black &quot;Dan Smith&quot; era Fender Stratocaster (likely a 1982 or 1983 model) with a DiMarzio Steve Morse humbucker in the bridge (seen in the &quot;Black Star&quot; video, ). On his message board, Becker said &quot;I recorded SMS [Speed Metal Symphony] with my Strat.&quot;

For his next guitar, Becker said on his message board &quot;Mike Varney got Hurricane to endorse us after we recorded Speed Metal Symphony. I liked how they were like Strats, only beefier.&quot;

On &quot;Perpetual Burn&quot;, Becker said on his message board: &quot;I used my white and black Hurricane guitar for everything. For clean tone I went direct. For dirty tone I used a 100 Watt Marshall with a Boss Super Overdrive pedal.&quot;

The Moridira Hurricane guitar he used is called a Limited Edition LTD.2 model, believed to be made in Japan. (It is not a Hurricane EX series, which appears to be lower quality.) His LTD.2 was a &quot;strat copy&quot;, but with a HSS pickup setup, a 24-fret rosewood fingerboard, and unique Floyd Rose where you do not have to cut the strings. For pickups, Becker said on his message board: &quot;I just used the stock pickups it came with.&quot; The pickups were Japanese-made pickups.

While Becker is pictured with a blue Hurricane guitar on the cover of &quot;Perpetual Burn&quot;, he did not use this blue guitar on the album. Differences on this guitar from his first Hurricane include DiMarzio pickups, a maple fretboard, and 24 frets. (Marty Friedman recorded the whammy parts of his song &quot;Dragon Mistress&quot; using Becker&#x27;s blue Hurricane, one of the rare times Marty has recorded whammy work.)

For the second Cacophony album, Becker switched over to Carvin gear, utilizing 2 DC Series models, one in a trans blue finish with flamed maple top, and another one in a solid burgundy finish (This is the guitar seen in the famous &quot;Yo Yo&quot; video from the 1989 Japan tour with Cacophony). Both have double cutaway bodies, Kahler locking tremolo systems, six in line machine heads and two Carvin humbucker pickups. He used these up until he was diagnosed with ALS in 1989.

During the sessions for &quot;A Little Ain&#x27;t Enough&quot;, Becker used various Carvin, Ibanez, ESP and Valley Arts guitars, as well as a Les Paul on some tracks and a Gibson acoustic for select things. Becker has also been pictured with a few Hamer superstrats as well. From 1989 to 1991, Becker used various guitars, most notably a Peavey custom model with the numbered fretboard markers. Also used were an Ibanez Custom Shop guitar (probably based on an RG), a custom from Performance Guitars, a couple of various unknown Strat style guitars and a black Hurricane with three single coil pickups.

Becker has allowed Paradise Guitars USA to release a Jason Becker signature guitar. It is similar in appearance to the numbered Peavey, but with a different headstock shape.

Becker used various types of amplifiers in his music. Before joining Cacophony, he used a small Peavey Studio Pro 40 with the older style Peavey vertical silver stripes on the grille cloth. During his early days Becker was also seen with a red Marshall JCM800 head and 4x12 cabinet.

For the first Cacophony album, Becker used an ADA MP1 preamp. He recorded Perpetual Burn with a borrowed 1970s Marshall half stack and a BOSS Super Overdrive and Cacophony&#x27;s second album was recorded with a Carvin X100B stack.
For the David Lee Roth album &quot;A Little Ain&#x27;t Enough&quot;, Becker used &quot;eight different Marshall amps.&quot; He also used the SX300H head at some point during that era. After Cacophony, Becker used various amps, including a &quot;Fender M80&quot;, an unknown Marshall amp, an ADA preamp and possibly the aforementioned Peavey combo.

Becker typically used Dean Markley and SIT strings.

===Paradise Guitar===
In 2008 Paradise Guitars worked with Becker to design a Jason Becker signature guitar. The design is based on the Peavey with colored number fret inlays. Features include an alder body, maple neck with steel 2-way truss rod, maple 16&quot; radius fingerboard, 24 jumbo thin frets with colored number fret marker inlays, black Floyd Rose Pro Style floating Tremolo with Floyd Rose Tremolo stop, Sperzel red satin tuners, 14-degree tilt-back headstock with black Paradise logo and matching tremolo and electronics plates. The pickups are DiMarzio pickups; a PAF Pro-Custom in the neck colored yellow and red, a DP116 HS-2 in the middle colored green, and a Tone Zone-Custom in the bridge colored pink and blue. These colored pickups complement the colored inlays and seem to give the guitar a rainbow effect. There is also a red five-way switch and purple 1–11 volume knob.

===Kiesel/Carvin Tribute Guitars===
In 2012, Carvin worked with Becker to design the JB200C Jason Becker Tribute, a guitar that is modeled after the original DC200 guitar he used toward the latter part of his career.

In 2015, Kiesel Guitars, which took over Carvin&#x27;s guitar manufacturing, worked with Becker to release a second tribute model, called the JB24 &quot;Numbers&quot; guitar. It is the third incarnation of his &quot;Numbers&quot; guitar, previously released by Peavey and Paradise guitars.

For the official launch of Becker&#x27;s signature Seymour Duncan Perpetual Burn Humbucker and the Carvin JB24 numbers guitar, Danny Young was chosen as the guitarist for both performances due to his stylistic resemblance to Becker and Paganini. The Perpetual Burn performance was played on the Carvin JB200C.

== Documentary film ==
A feature-length documentary film about Becker entitled &quot;Jason Becker: Not Dead Yet&quot;, was released in 2012. The film includes interviews with Becker, his family and friends, and the various musicians he has worked with, including Marty Friedman, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Richie Kotzen, and Steve Hunter.

<doc id="888171" wikidata="Q3487950" url="?curid=888171" title="Capitonym">
<text>A capitonym is a word that changes its meaning (and sometimes pronunciation) when it is capitalized; the capitalization usually applies due to one form being a proper noun or eponym. It is a portmanteau of the word &quot;capital&quot; with the suffix &quot;-onym&quot;. A capitonym is a form of homograph and – when the two forms are pronounced differently – is also a form of heteronym. In situations where both words should be capitalized (such as the beginning of a sentence), there will be nothing to distinguish between them except the context in which they are used.

Although some pairs, such as &quot;march&quot; and &quot;March&quot;, are completely unrelated, in other cases, such as &quot;august&quot; and &quot;catholic&quot;, the capitalized form is a name that is etymologically related to the uncapitalized form. For example, &quot;August&quot; derives from the name of Imperator Augustus, who named himself after the word &quot;augustus&quot;, whence English &quot;august&quot; came. Likewise, both &quot;Catholic&quot; and &quot;catholic&quot; derive from a Greek adjective meaning &quot;universal&quot;.

Capital letters may be used to differentiate between a set of objects, and a particular example of that object. For instance in astronomical terminology a distinction may be drawn between a moon, any natural satellite, and the Moon, the natural satellite of Earth.

==In English==
===Philosophical, religious, and political terms===
A particular example of where capitonyms are prominent is in terminology relating to philosophy, religion, and politics. Capitalized words are often used to differentiate a philosophical concept from how the concept is referred to in everyday life, or to demonstrate respect for an entity or institution.

Words for transcendent ideas in the Platonic sense are often capitalized, especially when used in a religious context. Examples include &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Beauty&quot;, &quot;Truth&quot; or &quot;the One&quot;.

The word &quot;god&quot; is capitalized to &quot;God&quot; when referring to the single deity of monotheistic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, or Islam, and common to capitalize pronouns related to God (He, Him, His, etc.) as well; this practice is followed by many versions of the Bible, such as the NKJV. In this tradition, possessive pronouns are also capitalized if one is quoting God; &quot;My&quot; and &quot;Mine&quot; are capitalized, which should not be done when a human speaks. The pronouns &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Your&quot;, and &quot;Yours&quot; are also sometimes capitalized in reference to God. Other distinctions sometimes made include &quot;church&quot; (meaning a building) and &quot;Church&quot; (meaning an organization or group of people), and the liturgical &quot;Mass&quot;, versus the physical &quot;mass&quot;.

As political parties are often named after philosophies or ideologies, a capital letter is used to differentiate between a supporter of the philosophy, and a supporter of the party, for instance &quot;Liberal&quot;, a supporter of any Liberal Party, and &quot;liberal&quot;, a supporter of the philosophy of liberalism. Terms such as &quot;small-l liberal&quot; may be used to indicate the concept that an individual supports. Similar examples are conservative/Conservative, democrat/Democrat, libertarian/Libertarian, republican/Republican, socialist/Socialist, communist/Communist, and a supporter of labour/Labour.

===List of capitonyms in English===
The following list includes only &quot;dictionary words&quot;. Personal names (&quot;Mark&quot;/&quot;mark&quot;, &quot;Will&quot;/&quot;will&quot;), place-names (&quot;China&quot;/&quot;china&quot;, &quot;Turkey&quot;/&quot;turkey&quot;), company names (&quot;Fiat&quot;/&quot;fiat&quot;), names of publications (&quot;Time&quot;/&quot;time&quot;) etc. are all excluded as too numerous to list. Adjectives distinct from placenames (e.g. &quot;Polish&quot;/&quot;polish&quot;) are allowed. Pairs in which one word is simply a secondary meaning of the other – e.g. &quot;Masonry&quot; (secret society), which is in essence a peculiar use of the word &quot;masonry&quot; (wall building) – are omitted.

=== Example in poetry ===
The poem &quot;Job&#x27;s Job&quot; from Richard Lederer&#x27;s &quot;The Word Circus&quot; is an example of the use of capitonyms:

==Other languages==
In other languages there are more, or fewer, of these pairs depending on that language&#x27;s capitalization rules. For example, in German, where all nouns are capitalized, there are many pairs such as &quot;Laut&quot; &#x27;sound&#x27; ~ &quot;laut&quot; &#x27;loud&#x27; or &quot;Morgen&quot; &#x27;morning&#x27; ~ &quot;morgen&quot; &#x27;tomorrow&#x27;. In contrast, in Italian, as well as Spanish, very few words (except proper names) are capitalized, so there are extremely few, if any, such pairs. An example in Spanish is &quot;Lima&quot; (city) ~ &quot;lima&quot; &#x27;file (tool)&#x27; or &#x27;lime (fruit)&#x27;. In Portuguese, an example is &quot;Peru&quot; (country) ~ &quot;peru&quot; &#x27;turkey&#x27; (bird).

<text>A minister of state is a junior cabinet minister in the Cabinet of Canada, usually given specific responsibilities to assist a senior cabinet minister in a specific area. A secretary of state also holds many similar responsibilities in assisting senior cabinet members, being members of the Ministry and the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. A secretary of state is legally a minister of state styled as secretaries. However, secretaries of state are considered junior to ministers of state and are not members of Cabinet.

==History==
The title &quot;Minister of State&quot; was created during the government of Pierre Trudeau in 1971 under the &quot;Ministries and Ministers of State Act&quot;. This act allows for the creation of two different types of ministers of state. Sections 2 through 10 allow for the creation of a ministry of state, which is a temporary government department established by separating parts of departments created by law. A minister of state can be the head of such a ministry. Sections 11 and 12 of the act allow for the creation of a minister of state who &quot;may be assigned by the Governor in Council to assist any minister or ministers having responsibilities for any department or other portion of the public service of Canada in the carrying out of those responsibilities&quot;. The latter has become far more common and, by and large, the former has fallen into disuse.

Under Brian Mulroney and his successors, the title of Minister of State without any responsibilities attached has been used to appoint what had previously been called ministers without portfolio. Ministers of State are also members of the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada, as is required for them to be a part of the ministry.

During the government of Jean Chrétien, assistants to senior cabinet ministers were often styled as secretary of state, considered junior to ministers of state, and were not members of Cabinet. Under Chrétien, the title &quot;minister of state&quot;, with a specific policy responsibility, was usually given to either a Cabinet minister, in addition to his or her other responsibilities, or to the deputy prime minister, government house leader or leader of the government in the Senate. Chrétien also had parliamentary secretaries, ranking below secretaries of state, who were set to two-year terms and the post was used as a reward for weary backbenchers. Their duty was to answer questions and table reports on behalf of ministers when they were unable to be present in the house.

Paul Martin eliminated the position of secretary of state and reverted to using the title &quot;minister of state&quot; for junior cabinet ministers. The day he took office, Martin realigned various government departments. However, this can be done by changing the law only so, in reality, he set up various ministries of state headed by ministers of state. All such ministries of state and their ministers were styled as proper ministers of permanent departments. Over the course of his government, most of these departments were created in law and the ministers of state became ministers of the new departments as their empowering legislation received royal assent.

When Stephen Harper became Prime Minister on February 6, 2006, he did not include any ministers of state in his cabinet. Derek Burney, the head of Harper&#x27;s transition team, noted to the press that this was intentional: ministers of state and the role of Deputy Prime Minister were omitted to create a cabinet of full equals. In actuality, Harper did appoint a number of ministers of state in order to give certain ministers responsibilities outside of their portfolios; however, all of these ministers of state were also full Cabinet ministers and their formal titles were styled so as to omit &quot;of state&quot;. On January 4, 2007, Harper added five secretaries of state to his ministry thus reviving the practice of appointing junior ministers outside of the Cabinet. On October 30, 2008, Harper added 11 ministers of state to his Cabinet. On January 4, 2011, Harper added one minister of state to his Cabinet to a total of 12. In 2015, the 29th cabinet led by Justin Trudeau, formed and updated several ministries including the formation of Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities from the previous junior position Minister of State (Sport).

<doc id="888181" wikidata="Q2892698" url="?curid=888181" title="Brownie Wise">
<text>Brownie Wise (; May 25, 1913 – September 24, 1992) was a pioneering American saleswoman largely responsible for the success of the home products company Tupperware, through her development of the &quot;party plan&quot; system of marketing. She initially worked as a salesperson for Stanley Home Products to supplement her income, before switching to selling Tupperware. Wise was vice president of Tupperware Home Parties between 1951 and 1958 when she was fired by Tupperware&#x27;s founder Earl Tupper.

== Early life ==
Wise was born Brownie Mae Humphrey on May 25, 1913, in Buford, Georgia, to Jerome and Rose Stroud Humphrey. When Wise was two years old, her parents divorced, making her mother a single parent. Her mother worked as an organizer for a hat makers&#x27; union, often traveling for months at a time, leaving Wise in the care of her aunt. Wise dropped out of school in her teens, and by the age of fourteen was delivering speeches at union rallies. She met her future husband, Robert W. Wise, at the Texas Centennial Exposition in 1936. After marrying later that year, they moved to Detroit, where their only child, Jerry, was born in 1938. Robert was often violent; in one case, he threw a bottle of acid at his mother-in-law. Their marriage lasted less than five years before Brownie filed for divorce and was awarded custody of her son.

==Career==

After her divorce, Wise moved to Dearborn, Michigan, where she lived with her mother. During World War II, they turned their attic into a living space for airmen. At the war&#x27;s height, their basement was used as a first-aid clinic for injured soldiers. Wise worked as an executive secretary at Bendix Aviation, an aircraft manufacturing company, and was a columnist for &quot;The Detroit News&quot;, writing under the pen name &quot;Hibiscus&quot;. After the war ended, Wise started working as a salesperson for Stanley Home Products using the party plan marketing system. Eventually, Wise wanted to work as an executive in the company, but its founder, Frank Beveridge, told her not to &quot;waste her time&quot;, informing her that management was &quot;no place for a woman&quot;.

After leaving Stanley Home Products, she found Tupperware to be a product with broad appeal and began selling it at home parties. Wise urged her distributors to demonstrate the products to potential customers, even throwing containers to show their durability. By October 1949, Wise had recruited 19 dealers to work with her in Detroit. In 1949, Wise and her sales team sold over $150,000 ($ in 2021) of Tupperware, more than any store, and Wise was offered distribution rights to Florida. Wise moved to Fort Lauderdale, where she set up a company named Patio Parties. Earl Tupper, the founder of Tupperware, invited Wise to be vice president of Tupperware Home Parties in 1951. On Wise&#x27;s suggestion, Tupperware was removed from stores and exclusively sold using the party plan.

Tupperware&#x27;s sales in 1952 were over $2 million, a significant increase from the previous year. That year Wise was paid a salary of $20,933 ($ in 2021), and the company bought a lakeside house for her near its headquarters in Kissimmee. Starting in 1954, Wise organized Jubilee, an annual sales conference where top-performing saleswomen would be awarded expensive gifts. Each Jubilee had its theme; for example, the 1954 event was themed around the Wild West, featuring a &quot;Big Dig&quot; where participants could dig up items like jewellery and televisions. The same year, Wise was the first woman to appear on the cover of &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;. Wise was also a writer for the monthly company magazine &quot;Tupperware Sparks&quot;.

In 1957, Wise published her autobiography &quot;Best Wishes, Brownie Wise&quot;. This, along with Wise receiving credit for Tupperware&#x27;s success in the media, estranged her from Tupper. Wise was accused of &quot;undermining the company&#x27;s image&quot; when she reportedly used a Tupperware container as a dog dish, and she was forced out of the company by Tupper in January 1958. She filed a lawsuit against the company for $1.6 million for breach of contract, eventually settling for $30,000. Wise owned no stock and many of her possessions, including her Florida house, were company property. Tupper removed all mentions of Wise from company history and buried remaining copies of her autobiography in a pit near Tupperware&#x27;s headquarters. Later that year, Tupper sold the company to Rexall for $16 million, divorced his wife, and moved to Costa Rica.

== Life after Tupperware ==
Wise founded her own party-plan cosmetics company, Cinderella International, the year after leaving Tupperware, but it was unsuccessful and closed down less than a year later. She was appointed as CEO of Viviane Woodard Cosmetics in 1960 but was still unable to replicate her success at Tupperware. She later worked as a consultant and in real estate.

In her later years, Wise was active in church and worked as a ceramist. She died on September 24, 1992, in Florida, where she lived and owned land near Lake Tohopekaliga, after a long illness.

==Legacy==

Wise was to be portrayed by Sandra Bullock in a movie based on the book &quot;Tupperware Unsealed&quot;, written by Bob Kealing.

In 2016, the Tupperware company donated $200,000 to Florida&#x27;s Osceola County to establish a conservation area and a &quot;Brownie Wise Park&quot; on an island in Lake Tohopekaliga.

<doc id="888183" wikidata="Q3498988" url="?curid=888183" title="Hanscom Air Force Base">
<text>Hanscom Air Force Base (AFB) is a United States Air Force base located predominantly within Bedford, Massachusetts, with portions extending into the adjoining towns of Lincoln, Concord and Lexington. The facility is adjacent to Hanscom Field which provides general aviation and charter service.

Hanscom AFB is a part of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, one of six centers under Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center is the single center responsible for total life cycle management of Air Force weapon systems and is headquartered at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The host unit at Hanscom is the 66th Air Base Group (66 ABG) assigned to AFMC.

A portion of the base is listed as a census-designated place by the U.S. Census Bureau for statistical purposes. The resident population as of 2020 was 1,516 at the 2020 census.

==Overview==
A non-flying base, Hanscom Air Force Base is named after Laurence G. Hanscom (1906–1941), a pilot, aviation enthusiast, and State House reporter who was killed in a plane crash at Saugus, Massachusetts. Hanscom was a reporter for the Boston Globe, Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette and the Wilmington (MA) News. Hanscom was active in early aviation, founding the Massachusetts Civil Air Reserve. At the time of his death, Hanscom had been lobbying for the establishment of an airfield in Bedford. The base was named in his honor on 26 June 1941.

Hanscom Field, a civilian general-aviation airport adjacent to the Air Force Base, and Massport are the primary operators of the air field and runways. Less than one percent of the air traffic at Hanscom Field is military aircraft.

==History==

===World War II===
Hanscom Air Force Base began its existence while the United States was considering its entry into World War II. In May 1941, the Massachusetts Legislature authorized the purchase of a large tract of farmland spanning the borders of the towns of Bedford, Lincoln, Concord and Lexington for a Boston Auxiliary Airport. Funds to build the new airport were contributed by the federal government, which had appropriated $40 million to build 250 new civil airports across the United States that could serve for future national defense.

In mid-1942, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts leased the Bedford airport to the War Department for use by the Army Air Forces. Fighter squadrons trained there in 1942 through 1943. The 85th Fighter Squadron and the 318th Fighter Squadron, who trained at Bedford on the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, went on to combat in North Africa and Europe.

In February 1943, the airport was renamed Laurence G. Hanscom Field in honor of a Massachusetts-born pilot and aviation enthusiast who had been a reporter for the Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette. Hanscom had died in February 1941, in an aircraft accident in Saugus, Massachusetts, while he was lobbying vigorously at the State House for the establishment of the airport at Bedford.

Later in the war, the Bedford Army Air Field served as a site for testing new radar sets developed by MIT&#x27;s Radiation Laboratory. It was this secondary wartime activity at Hanscom that gave rise to the base&#x27;s postwar role.

===Cold War===
Since 1945 Hanscom has emerged as the Air Force&#x27;s center for the development and acquisition of electronic systems. The base has also played a significant role in the creation of a national high-technology area around Route 128.

World War II established the key military importance of radar. In 1945, when the MIT and Harvard wartime laboratories were dissolved, the Army Air Forces aimed to continue some of their programs in radar, radio and electronic research. It recruited scientists and engineers from the laboratories, and its new Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories (AFCRL) took over MIT&#x27;s test site at Hanscom Field.

By 1950, the Air Force was working closely with MIT to develop a new air defense system for the continental United States. Expanding its facilities at Hanscom Field was a step to accomplishing this massive project. After some negotiation, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed in May 1952 to cede land on one side of the airport to the federal government and to give a 25-year renewable lease on the airfield itself.

The first buildings for the new MIT Lincoln Laboratory at Hanscom were completed in 1952, and the Air Force&#x27;s electronic and geophysics laboratories in Cambridge started to migrate out to its own new facilities in Bedford in 1954. The airfield&#x27;s runways were reconfigured and expanded in 1953, and new hangars, headquarters and facilities were built. To provide test and evaluation for Lincoln Lab&#x27;s new &quot;Cape Cod&quot; experimental air defense system, Hanscom&#x27;s 6520th Test Support Wing logged thousands of hours of flying time. In April 1960, the 3245th Air Base Wing was organized to undertake routine support around the base.

The Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense computer system, completed in the early 1960s, revolutionized air defense and also contributed significantly to advances in air traffic control systems. As the SAGE system matured, the Air Force developed a number of advanced command, control and communications systems.

In 1961 the Electronic Systems Division (ESD) was established at Hanscom Field in order to consolidate the management of the Air Force&#x27;s electronic systems under one agency. Since that time, the ESD (re-designated the Electronic Systems Center in 1992) has been the host organization on the base. The 3245th Air Base Wing was redesignated as the 3245th Air Base Group on 1 July 1964, remaining responsible to the ESD.

While Hanscom&#x27;s role in system acquisition flourished after the 1950s, its operational mission gradually diminished. As of September 1973, all regular military flying operations at Hanscom ceased. The following year the Air Force terminated its lease of the airfield portion of Hanscom Field, which reverted to state control, but retained the right to use the field. The Air Force re-designated its own acreage surrounding the field as the Laurence G. Hanscom Air Force Base. In 1977 the name was shortened to the present Hanscom Air Force Base.

The base saw a second wave of construction during the 1980s. The Electronic Systems Division put up four new systems management engineering facilities (the O&#x27;Neill, Brown, Shiely and Bond buildings). For base personnel, there were new service facilities—medical, youth and family support centers—as well as additional housing and a temporary lodging facility.

===Post Cold War===

Since July 1992, Hanscom and the Electronic Systems Center (ESC) have been part of the Air Force Materiel Command. In 1994 the Air Force designated ESC as the Air Force Center of Excellence for Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I). The 3245th Air Base Group was redesignated the 647th Support Group on 1 October 1992, and then the 647th Air Base Group (647th ABG) on 1 October 1993. The 647th ABG was then inactivated on 1 October 1994, and its mission taken up by the 66th Air Base Wing.

The Standard Systems Group at Gunter Annex, Maxwell AFB, Ala.; the 38th Engineering Installation Wing at Tinker AFB, Okla.; the Materiel Systems Group at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio; and lastly the Cryptologic Systems Group at Kelly AFB, Texas; were all attached to ESC between 1993 and 1996 in order to consolidate related functions in AFMC under the center, and to support its expanded mission. Subsequent reorganizations changed the groupings, but all the above organizations (though renamed) except the 38th EIW remained under Hanscom&#x27;s reporting chain.

In 2004, ESC was reorganized into a named wing, group and squadron unit, to better reflect the organization of the Air Force as a whole. In 2006, the wings, groups and squadrons were given numbered designations. In 2010, ESC reverted to an organization of program offices and the 38th Engineering Installation Wing (by then a group) was reassigned. New Air Force standards caused the 66th Air Base Wing, because of its size, to be redesignated the 66th Air Base Group.

In June 2011, the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Directorate moved from Hanscom to Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, and the Space Vehicles Directorate moved to Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, closing more than 60 years of laboratory presence on Hanscom.

The Electronic Systems Center as an organization was realigned in July 2012, and became a part of the newly created Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

===Incidents/accidents===

The B-25 bomber which crashed into the Empire State Building on 28 July 1945, took off from Hanscom.

<doc id="888187" wikidata="Q1788785" url="?curid=888187" title="War chest">
<text>A war chest is a metaphor for any collection of tools or money intended to be used in a challenging or dangerous situation. Historically, it referred to an actual chest located in the homes or barracks of soldiers or military leadership, in which arms and armor were stored. Traveling armies, such as that of Hannibal, collected the spoils of war and used them to negotiate with others to resolve conflicts through economic exchange rather than violence. In the modern era, the term refers to amassed funds, expertise, and/or equipment which allows a person or organization to survive a challenging situation.

==Etymology==

In arms and armor, a war chest is a container for the personal weapons and protective gear of a citizen-soldier, kept in the household, and is the origin of the term. The term&#x27;s modern meaning originates with the medieval practice of having a chest, literally, filled with money to open in time of war.

==In politics==
In politics, a war chest is funding obtained from donors well in advance of a campaign, usually accumulated by an incumbent for either re-election or to contest a more advanced office, or provided by a wealthy candidate to their own campaign. The possession of such excess funds may discourage otherwise viable candidates from a primary or general election challenge.

==In business==
In business a war chest, or cash mountain is a stash of money set aside to deal with unexpected changes in the business environment, or to use when expansion possibilities arise.

Today companies can use accumulated cash or rely on quickly raised debt which costs less to carry when you do not need it. This is not always a reasonable substitute, as the credit available to a company typically drops as a result of the same actions that require the war chest to be opened.

Companies can redistribute their war chests to shareholders by issuing larger or special dividends, or more commonly through share buyback operations. Companies do this because if actually held in cash, the companies will be earning a low rate of return in the money markets, whereas they could be using the funds to invest in more profitable projects. If they continue not to invest the funds, shareholders may sell the company&#x27;s shares and make it vulnerable to a takeover. This would place the current management&#x27;s jobs at risk.

==In professional sports==
In club association football, it refers to the transfer budget that the club&#x27;s manager has been allotted for acquisition of new players by the club&#x27;s chairman, board of directors, owner or investors.

==Related terms==
Similar terms are also referred to as surplus cash, cash reserves, emergency reserves, acquisition funds, rainy day funds, or undistributed earnings within different contexts.

A typical club is in the range of long, weighs between , is slim at the &quot;handle&quot; end, and has its center of balance nearer the wider &quot;body&quot; end. The definition of a club is somewhat ambiguous; sticks or rods are allowed under the current Juggling Information Service rules for juggling world records.

A juggling club&#x27;s shape is similar to a bowling pin&#x27;s and an Indian club&#x27;s. Modern juggling clubs are, however, distinct from these objects because they differ in the materials they are made of, the way they are constructed, their weight and weight distribution, and are therefore not usually interchangeable.

== Types ==
Juggling clubs are manufactured from different materials and construction methods and can therefore be divided into a number of broad types. 

=== Wood clubs ===
Early 20th century clubs were made entirely of wood: they had solid handles with large bodies which were hollowed to reduce weight. This style of club was manufactured by Edward Van Wyck and Harry Lind and are most often called American style juggling clubs because of their size and shape. In Europe, juggling clubs were constructed using solid cork bodies with wood handles or were very thin profiled solid wood clubs which were actually more stick-like in their construction.

===Plastic clubs===
With the invention of various plastics constructing juggling clubs was made easier and mass production of a variety of club sizes, shapes, weights and colours began.

==== One-piece clubs ====
One-piece plastic clubs are constructed as a single plastic moulded prop. The handle and body are therefore made from the same material and the club is hollow. One-piece clubs are very durable and are cheaper than composite or multi-piece clubs to make and buy. Despite these virtues, one-piece clubs are less popular among jugglers than multi-piece ones because the handles do not have any give making them occasionally more painful to catch.

==== Multi-piece clubs ====
Multi-piece or composite clubs are constructed using a number of parts of different materials. The core of the club is an internal rod, usually of wood but sometimes metal which provides a uniform structure about which the body and handle of the club can be attached. The body is made of a single moulded shape of plastic and the handle is made of a wrapping of either thin flexible plastic or sometimes cloth. The wrapped construction of the handle creates a more flexible grip making these clubs easier to catch during long periods of juggling. Foam ends attached to the top of the body and round or semi-conical knobs attached to the base of the handle protect the club&#x27;s ends from impacts. This design was pioneered by Jay Green in the 1960s with off the shelf components. It was refined by Brian Dube, beginning in 1975 with the first custom production moulds. Multi-piece clubs are made in both a thin European style or larger bodied American style and in various lengths, generally ranging from .

====Club decoration====
Both one-piece and multi-piece clubs are often decorated with coloured tape or with specific decorations created by the club manufacturers. The range of decoration include full body and handle decoration in various colours including glitter variations and &quot;European&quot; decorations which only decorate parts of the club.

==Basic juggling==
The basic pattern of club juggling, as in ball juggling, is the cascade. Clubs are thrown from alternate hands; each passes underneath the other clubs and is caught in the opposite hand to the one from which it was thrown. At its simplest, each club rotates once per throw but double, triple or multiple spins are frequently performed.

==Tricks==
A wide variety of tricks which are beyond the normal cascade pattern are possible with clubs. Most ball-juggling tricks can be performed with clubs, though they are generally more difficult to learn because of the size of the clubs and the extra complexity added by their rotation. However, for tricks involving juggling a basic cascade under other constraints, such as while unicycling or blindfolded, club juggling is easier, given the lower accuracy required to make each catch.

===Unique club tricks===

Juggling clubs are used to perform unique tricks which are not possible with other juggling props like balls and rings. Examples of these include chin rolls, helicopter spins, various types of traps, and various types of throws unique to clubs because of the shape and spin of these props.

A flourish is a trick in which a performer spins the club around the fingers of one hand. The club actually makes two revolutions around its center of gravity, once on the medial side of the juggler&#x27;s hand and once on the lateral side.

== Passing ==

Clubs are the prop of choice for passing between jugglers. There are many reasons for this but some of the key ones are: juggling clubs have a larger catching area than balls; the variety of tricks that can be performed exceed either ball or ring passing; and they are visually more noticeable when viewed by an audience.

Beginners club passing is generally done with six clubs between two jugglers, each passing a single club to their partner every fourth beat. The passes are made from one juggler&#x27;s right hand to the other juggler&#x27;s left hand, so the clubs travel perpendicular to both jugglers. This basic pattern is called four count or every-others.

More advanced club passing can involve more objects, more jugglers and more intricate patterns. A notation for describing club passing patterns, called causal notation, was developed by Martin Frost of the Stanford Juggling Research Institute. The other main notation style is that of &quot;four-handed siteswap&quot; - a variation of basic siteswap.

==Combat/gladiators==
Combat, often known as Gladiators in Europe, is a popular competitive group juggling activity. A &quot;last man standing&quot; competition, the participating jugglers maintain a base level of juggling, normally a three club cascade, within a limited area. Participants who drop a club, or go out of bounds, have lost the round and are expected to remove themselves (and their clubs if necessary) from the competition area. The rules of combat juggling vary from country to country and juggling convention to convention. The most common rules do not allow participants to deliberately come into body to body contact with each other but they are allowed to use their clubs to interfere with other participants&#x27; cascades. Multiple rounds may be played, with the winner being the first to win a set number of rounds, or the person with the most wins by a set end time.

==Records==
The world record for most clubs juggled (i.e., longest time or most catches with each club at minimum being thrown and caught at least twice without dropping) is eight clubs for 16 catches, achieved by Anthony Gatto in 2006, Willy Colombaioni in 2015, Spencer Androli in 2022, and Moritz Rosner in 2023 (Moritz Rosner got 18 catches). The record for most clubs flashed (i.e., each prop thrown and caught only once) is nine, achieved by Eivind Dragsjø in 2016 (11 Catches).

<doc id="888192" wikidata="Q910479" url="?curid=888192" title="Fire triangle">
<text>The fire triangle or combustion triangle is a simple model for understanding the necessary ingredients for most fires.

The triangle illustrates the three elements a fire needs to ignite: heat, fuel, and an oxidizing agent (usually oxygen). A fire naturally occurs when the elements are present and combined in the right mixture. A fire can be prevented or extinguished by removing any one of the elements in the fire triangle. For example, covering a fire with a fire blanket blocks oxygen and can extinguish a fire. In large fires where firefighters are called in, decreasing the amount of oxygen is not usually an option because there is no effective way to make that happen in an extended area.

==Fire tetrahedron==

The fire tetrahedron represents the addition of the chemical chain reaction to the three already present in the fire triangle. 

Combustion is a chemical reaction that feeds a fire more heat and allows it to continue. Once a fire has started, the resulting exothermic chain reaction sustains the fire and allows it to continue until or unless at least one of the elements of the fire is blocked:

* foam can be used to deny the fire the oxygen it needs
* water can be used to lower the temperature of the fuel below the ignition point, or to remove or disperse the fuel.
* halon can be used to remove free radicals and create a barrier of inert gas in a direct attack on the chemical reaction responsible for the fire.
*carbon dioxide can be used to push the oxygen it needs since it is heavier 

When the fire involves burning metals like lithium, magnesium, titanium, etc. (known as a class-D fire), it becomes even more important to consider the energy release. Because the metals react faster with water than with oxygen and thereby more energy is released, putting water on such a fire results in the fire getting hotter or even exploding. Carbon dioxide extinguishers are ineffective against certain metals such as titanium. Therefore, inert agents (e.g. dry sand) must be used to break the chain reaction of metallic combustion.

In the same way, as soon as one of the four elements of the tetrahedron is (entirely) removed, combustion stops.

==Oxidizer==
The oxidizer is the other reactant of the chemical reaction. In most cases, it is the ambient air, and in particular one of its components, oxygen (O2). By depriving a fire of air the fire can be extinguished, such as when covering the flame of a small candle with an empty glass. To the contrary, if air is blown over a wood fire (as with bellows), the fire is activated by the introduction of more air.

Some chemicals, such as fluorine gas, perchlorate salts such as ammonium perchlorate, or chlorine trifluoride, act as oxidizers, sometimes more powerful ones than oxygen itself. A fire based on a reaction with these oxidizers can be very difficult to put out until the oxidizer is exhausted; that leg of the fire triangle cannot be broken by normal means (i.e., depriving it of air will not smother it).

In certain cases such as some explosives, the oxidizer and combustible are the same (e.g., nitroglycerin, an unstable molecule that has oxidizing parts in the same molecule as the oxidizeable parts).

The reaction is initiated by an activating energy — in most cases, it is heat. Several examples include friction, as in the case of matches, heating an electrical wire, a flame (propagation of fire), or a spark (from a lighter or from any starting electrical device). There are also many other ways to bring sufficient activation energy including electricity, radiation, and pressure, all of which will lead to a temperature rise. In most cases, heat production enables self-sustainability of the reaction, and enables a chain reaction to grow. The temperature at which a liquid produces sufficient vapor to get a flammable mix with self-sustainable combustion is called its flash-point.

==Extinguishment of the fire==
To stop a combustion reaction, one of the three elements of the fire triangle must be removed.

Without sufficient heat, a fire cannot begin, and it cannot continue. Heat can be removed by the application of a substance which reduces the amount of heat available to the fire reaction. This is often water, which absorbs heat for phase change from water to steam. Introducing sufficient quantities and types of powder or gas in the flame reduces the amount of heat available for the fire reaction in the same manner. Scraping embers from a burning structure also removes the heat source. Turning off the electricity in an electrical fire removes the ignition source.

Without fuel, a fire will stop. Fuel can be removed naturally, as where the fire has consumed all the burnable fuel, or manually, by mechanically or chemically removing the fuel from the fire. Fuel separation is an important factor in wildland fire suppression, and is the basis for most major tactics, such as controlled burns. The fire stops because a lower concentration of fuel vapor in the flame leads to a decrease in energy release and a lower temperature. Removing the fuel thereby decreases the heat.

Without sufficient oxygen, a fire cannot begin, and it cannot continue. With a decreased oxygen concentration, the combustion process slows. Oxygen can be denied to a fire using a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher, a fire blanket or water.

==Role of water in firefighting==
The water can have two different roles. In the case of a solid combustible, the solid fuel produces pyrolyzing products under the influence of heat, commonly radiation. This process is halted by the application of water, since water is more easily evaporated than the fuel is pyrolyzed. Thereby energy is removed from the fuel surface and it is cooled and the pyrolysis is stopped, removing the fuel supply to the flames. In fire fighting, this is referred to as surface cooling.

In the gas phase, i.e. in the flames or in the smoke, the combustible can not be separated from the oxidizer, and the only possible action consists of cooling down. In this case, water droplets are evaporated in the gas phase, thereby lowering the temperature and adding water vapour making the gas mixture non combustible. This requires droplets of a size less than about 0.2 mm. In fire fighting, this is referred to as gas cooling or smoke cooling.

Cases also exist where the ignition factor is not the activation energy. For example, a smoke explosion is a very violent combustion of unburned gases contained in the smoke created by a sudden fresh air input (oxidizer input). The interval in which an air/gas mix can burn is limited by the explosive limits of the air. This interval can be very small (kerosene) or large (acetylene).

Water cannot be used on certain type of fires:
*Fires where live electricity is present – as water conducts electricity it presents an electrocution hazard.
*Hydrocarbon fires – as it will only spread the fire because of the difference in density/hydrophobicity. For example, adding water to a fire with an oil source will cause the oil to spread, since oil and water do not mix. However, using a foam/water mix in a specific application method is acceptable.
*Metal fires – as these fires produce huge amounts of energy (up to 7.550 calories/kg for aluminium) and water can also create violent chemical reactions with burning metal (possibly even serving as an additional oxidizing agent).

Since these reactions are well understood, it has been possible to create specific water-additives which will allow:
*A better heat absorption with a higher density than water.
*Carrying free radical catchers on the fire.
*Carrying foaming agents to enable water to stay on the surface of a liquid fire and prevent gas release.
*Carrying specific reactives which will react and change the nature of the burning material.

Water-additives are generally designed to be effective on several categories of fires (class A + class B or even class A + class B + class F [Class K in North America]), meaning a better global performance and usability of a single extinguisher on many different types of fires (or fires that involve several different classes of materials).

== Multi-scale fire triangles for wildland fires ==

In the context of wildland fire, the fire triangle can be scaled up to apply to fire spread over landscapes (scales of days and several kilometres) and recurrence of fire over time (scales of decades and hundreds of kilometres). Thus, while heat is important to ignite a flame, topography is important for aiding fire spread especially by preheating upslope fuels, and ignitions sources are important to help explain recurrence on longer time scales. Similarly, while oxygen is relevant to sustain a flame, weather and associated winds feed oxygen into a spreading fire, and the longer-term pattern of weather is summarized as climate. Lastly, &quot;fuels&quot; is the term to describe what burns in a single flame to the range of materials burnt in a spreading wildfire, but fuels vary over larger space and time scales in what is called vegetation.

At the smallest scale, the combustion fire triangle, individual fuel particles are ignited once at a critical temperature, and fire transfers energy to the nearest surroundings. Combustion events range on the scale of several seconds to a couple of days and their effects are monitored at the quadrant scale. The largest scale, in contrast, describes the fire regime concept. Global climate change drives many of the factors involved in the &#x27;wildfire&#x27; and the &#x27;fire regime&#x27; triangles. For example, with respect to the fire regime, a particular vegetation type will support a characteristic fire in terms of recurrence, intensity, seasonality and biological effects; a change in vegetation type will have implications for a changing fire regime.

<doc id="888193" wikidata="Q2980880" url="?curid=888193" title="Kullu district">
<text>Kullu is a district in Himachal Pradesh, India. It borders Shimla district to the south, Mandi and Kangra districts to the west, Kinnaur to the east and the Lahaul and Spiti district to the north and east. The largest valley in this mountainous district is the Kullu Valley. The Kullu valley follows the course of the Beas River, and ranges from an elevation of 833m above sea level at Aut to 3330m above sea level at the Atal Tunnel South Portal, below the Rohtang Pass. The town of Kullu, located on the right side of the Beas River, serves as the administrative headquarters of the Kullu district. The Kullu district also incorporates several riverine tributary valleys of the Beas, including those of the Parvati, Sainj, and Tirthan rivers, and thus some regions somewhat distant from the Kullu valley. The economy of the district relies mainly on horticulture, agriculture, tourism, and traditional handicrafts.

== History ==
The ancient seat of the kings of the kingdom of Kullu was the Naggar Castle, about 12 km north of the present-day town of Kullu, and was thought to have been built in the late 15th century. Raja Jagat Singh (who ruled Kullu between 1637–72) moved the capital in the middle of the 17th century from Naggar to Sultanpur, within today&#x27;s Kullu town.

Kullu ended being an independent kingdom upon the invasion by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1839. Following, in turn, the takeover of the Sikh Empire by the British Empire, Kullu was ceded by the Sikhs to the British in 1846, whereupon it became a tehsil of the British-administered Kangra district (in turn a part of the Punjab Province, British India). The head of Kullu&#x27;s royal family had been granted the Waziri Rupi by the Sikh emperor along with the title &#x27;Rai&#x27;, and this continued throughout the British period. Naggar Castle was exchanged by Raja Gyan Singh of Kullu for a rifle with Major Hay, the first Assistant Commissioner of the then-newly acquired British territory of Kullu. The Rupi Palace in Sultanpur is still used as home by the descendants of Kullu&#x27;s royal family.

Upon the Independence of India, until 1960, Lahaul and Spiti continued being parts of the Kullu tehsil, as had also been the case during the British rule. In 1960, Lahaul and Spiti became a separate district. Kullu became a district of Punjab in 1963, and on November 1, 1966, it became a district of Himachal Pradesh, through the Punjab Reorganisation Act of 1966.

Since the British times, the various government offices and other government institutions built around the Dhalpur grounds, in the heart of the Kullu town, have formed the nerve centre of the district administration in Kullu district.

== Demographics ==

According to the 2011 census Kullu district has a population of 437,903, roughly equal to the nation of Malta. This gives it a ranking of 553rd in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 14.65%. Kullu has a sex ratio of 942 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 80.14%. 9.45% of the population lives in urban areas. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes make up 28.01% and 3.84% of the population respectively.

At the time of the 2011 census, census, 44% of the population in the district declared Kullui as their first language, 23% opted for Pahari, 10% chose Seraji, 7.8% – Hindi, 3.2% – Mandeali, 2.5% – Nepali, 2.3% – Lahauli, 0.92% – Punjabi, 0.87% – Kangri, 0.84% – Kinnauri, and 0.41% – Tibetan.

== Administrative ==
The administrative headquarters of the Kullu district lies at Kullu. The Kullu district has the following administrative divisions:
*Sub divisions in Kullu: Kullu, Banjar, Manali Anni and Nirmand
*Constituencies : Kullu, Banjar, Manali and Anni 
*Development Blocks: Kullu, Naggar, Banjar, Anni, Nirmand and Bhuntar
*Tehsils in Kullu: Kullu, Banjar, Manali, Anni, Nirmand, Bhuntar(Kullu) and Sainj(Banjar)
*
*Sub-Tehsils in Kullu: Jari(Kullu) and Nithar(Nirmand)
*Panchayat Samities: Kullu, Naggar, Banjar, Anni &amp; Nirmand
*Gram Panchayats: 70 in Kullu tehsil, 40 in Naggar tehsil, 36 in Banjar tehsil, 32 in Anni tehsil, 26 in Nirmand tehsil. 
*Zila Parishad: 1 (Kullu)
*Nagar Parishad: 2 (Kullu and Manali)
*Nagar Panchayats: 2 (Bhuntar and Banjar)
== Politics ==
Electorally, at the State level, Kullu contains four of the 68 assembly constituencies of the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly, namely Manali, Kullu, Banjar, and Anni. 

At the Central level, Kullu is a part of the Mandi Lok Sabha Constituency, one of the four such constituencies that represent the state of Himachal Pradesh in the Lok Sabha.

== Transport ==

=== By road ===
The main highway running through the Kullu district is the National Highway 3, formerly known as National Highway 21. The segment of this highway through the Kullu district begins at Aut and ends at the Atal Tunnel. This highway runs in a roughly south-north direction. To evade the usually heavy traffic between Kullu and Manali, one can take the road along the left bank of the Beas River at Kullu, so as to arrive in Manali via Naggar.

=== By air ===
The Kullu district has an airport at Bhuntar, capable of accommodating small aircraft. There are helipads at Manali, Palchan, Kullu (Dhalpur ground), and Naggar.

=== By railway ===
The Kullu district is not connected through railways.

== Economy ==
Agriculture and horticulture are the predominant sources of livelihood in the Kullu district. Wheat, maize, vegetables, and garlic are the main crops grown. Most agriculture in this mountainous district is done in the form of terrace farming. Most of this agricultural activity is subsistence level. Horticulture, particularly apple farming, has been more profitable in Kullu district. But both these activities are being negatively influenced by climate change. Cannabis farming has also been a lucrative though illegal source of income in the district, particularly since the 1980s. Forests play an important role in securing local livelihoods in the Kullu district, in the form of timber and various non-timber forest products. The district is also rich in medicinal herbs. No major minerals are found in the district. However, the district is rich in hydroelectric potential, and has several major hydroelectric projects, including the Parbati hydroelectric project. Some valleys in the district contain historic seasonal migration routes of the Gaddi and Gujjar transhumant communities. Tourism is a major source livelihood at many places in the Kullu district, in the form of hotels, homestays, restaurants, travel agencies, shops, dhabas, guiding services, cooks, porters, and taxi services. Tourism has had a major ecological footprint in the district. The handloom-based production and sale of Kullu shawls is also important in some parts of the Kullu district. Service sector industries, in field such as tourism, education, floriculture, and livestock and poultry farming have a good scope of growth in the district. There is no large-scale industry in the Kullu district. Geographic constraints and difficulty of access inhibit the growth of industries in the Kullu district.

== Institutions for Himalayan knowledge ==
&quot;[This section does not cover the schools, colleges, and universities of Kullu district.]&quot;

The Kullu district is rich in both ecological wealth and cultural and historical heritage. At the same time, Kullu is not far from regions such as the Trans-Himalayas and Tibet, and lies on an important historic trade route from Punjab to Ladakh and Central Asia. In modern times, these features of the Kullu valley have drawn many researchers, scientists, artists, and seekers of other kinds to it.

The Urusvati Himalayan Research Institute was the first institution in the Kullu region, dedicated to research on various sciences and mysticism in the Himalayas. The Roerich family established this centre in 1928 at Naggar upon their return from their Central-Asian Expedition. By World War II, the institute had become defunct. Nonetheless, the site of the former institute, a part of the Roerich estate in Naggar, continues to operate a library and some exhibitions.

The Himalayan Institute of Cultural and Heritage Studies (HICHS), until early 2023, was based in Katrain village, 30 km north of Kullu. This institution used to offer curated heritage walks in the Kullu valley; conducted on-site and online courses related to Himalayan cultures, religions, iconography, and architecture, and hosted weekly online talks by scholars and artists from India and around the world whose work featured the Himalayas. The institute has relocated to Bigri village, Shimla district.

At present, there are two institutions in Kullu that are active in generating and preserving Himalaya-specific knowledge:

* Himalayan Regional Centre of the GB Pant Institute of Himalayan Environment and Development - This institution is based in Mohal, about 6 km south of Kullu. It was established in Kullu in 1992, and shifted to Mohal in 1993. This government institution conducts research and informs policy on various issues related to climate change, mountain ecology, traditional ecological knowledge, and rural livelihoods.
* Himachal Pradesh Craftsmanship and Design Innovation Institute NORTH - This institute is based in Naggar, 22 km north of Kullu. It was established in 2017. This institution works to preserve Kullu&#x27;s traditional kathkuni architectural style.

==Attractions==

Particularly since the onset of the unrest in Kashmir in the 1980s, the Kullu region has gained in significance as a tourist destination. The Kullu valley is known as the &quot;Valley of the Gods&quot; or &quot;Dev Bhumi&quot; because almost every village in the valley has a local deity and annual festivities around them. The following is a non-exhaustive list of historical, cultural, religious, scenic, and ecological places of interest in the Kullu district.

Its construction was started in 2000 and completed in 2017. It is a continuation of a monastery of the same name in Tibet, which was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.
* Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP) -This national park is spread over in Banjar sub-division of Kullu District. The park is drained by the Sainj, Tirthan, Jiwa Nala, and Parvati rivers. It is home to many different and often rare kinds of birds, mammals, insects, and vegetation. The park was created in 1984 and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2014.

* Kasol - A village in the Parvati valley that is popular among backpackers; also known as &#x27;Little Israel&#x27; for being very popular among young Israeli tourists.
* Khanag - This village in Anni tehsil has an old rest house with a memorial to the English travel writer Penelope Chetwode, who died in a remote part of the Kullu district in April 1986. Chetwode loved the Kullu valley, and is known for her book &quot;Kulu: the End of the Habitable World&quot;.

These include a language different from the rest of the Kullu region; worship of Jamlu devta, a god considered somewhat hostile by the Kullu Pantheon; a complex system of local-self governance; a weaker prevalence of caste distinctions, and a strong belief of contact with people outside the village being highly polluting. The village is much more connected to the outside world than it was in the 1950s, when Colin Rosser conducted perhaps the earliest detailed research on this village.
* Manali - Perhaps the most famous tourist destination of the Kullu valley. This town includes a Mall Road, the Hadimba Temple, a Tibetan market, and Old Manali, besides hundreds of hotels, resorts, and restaurants. Near Manali are sites like the Solang valley (common site for adventure and winter sports), the hot springs at Vashisht, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Mountaineering and Allied Sports, and the Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment.

Naggar also has the Roerich&#x27;s Memorial House, and the Nicholas Roerich and Svetsolav Roerich Art Gallery. The Russian scholar, artist, and mystic Nicholas Roerich lived at this site from the late 1920s till his death here in 1947. Naggar also has several old temples, built in the shikhara and pagoda styles.
* Nirmand - One of the largest villages of Himachal Pradesh. Recorded in the Nirmand Copper Plate (7th century A.D.), and known for its ancient temples, including one dedicated to Parshurama.
* Raghunath Temple - In the 17th century, Raja Jagat Singh of Kullu committed a great mistake. To atone for the sin, he sent a senior courtier to Ayodhya for a statue of Lord Raghunath - Lord Ram. This temple was built in 1651 A.D. by Raja Jagat Singh to house the image, which continues to be greatly revered. Every year, the international fair Dussehra is celebrated with local deities in honour of Lord Raghunath.
* Rohtang Pass - The Kullu valley connects with the Lahul and Spiti district via Rohtang Pass, situated at from Manali city. In 2020, the Atal Tunnel was inaugurated, which bypasses the Pass and dramatically reduces the distance and effort required in getting from the Kullu valley to the Lahaul and Spiti valleys. But the pass continues to be a tourist attraction. Permits are required to visit the pass.
* Rupi Palace - Located in Sultanpur, Kullu, this palace was originally built in 1660 A.D. by Raja Jagat Singh. It was badly damaged in the Kangra earthquake of 1905, and was subsequently rebuilt. It is the residence of the descendants of Kullu&#x27;s royal family.

* Tirthan WLS - A Wildlife Sanctuary located in Banjar subdivision offering numerous flora and fauna species

=== Festivals ===

The origins of Kullu&#x27;s version of Dussehra lie in the mid-seventeenth century. It typically takes place in the month of October, which overlaps with the traditional period of the white lunar half of the month of Ashvin. It includes a rath yatra, a week-long congregation of deities from all parts of the Kullu region (including distant parts such as Banjar and Nirmand), a series of cultural performances, and a large fair that lasts several weeks.

<doc id="888194" wikidata="Q228760" url="?curid=888194" title="Street-legal vehicle">
<text>Street-legal, road-legal, or road-going, refers to a vehicle such as a car, motorcycle, or light truck that is equipped and licensed for use on public roads, being therefore roadworthy. This will require specific configurations of lighting, signal lights, and safety equipment. Some specialty vehicles that will not be operated on roads, therefore, do not need all the features of a street-legal vehicle; examples are a vehicle used only off-road (such as a sandrail) that is trailered to its off-road operating area, and a racing car that is used only on closed race tracks and therefore does not need all the features of a street-legal vehicle. As well as motor vehicles, the street-legal distinction applies in some jurisdictions to track bicycles that lack street-legal brakes and lights. Street-legality rules can even affect racing helmets, which possess visual fields too narrow for use on an open road without the risk of missing a fast-moving vehicle.
==Conditional==
Some vehicles may be street-legal only in certain areas, routes or use cases, such as UTVs or tractors only allowed on-road in rural areas or driving between different off-road areas/private properties. Enduro dirt bikes on dirt/gravel roads in National parks for personal recreational use. Small engine motorcycle/moped or microcars/quadricycle only allowed on (low speed) streets and not (high speed) highways. Vehicles imported from another country for testing, display or remanufacturing. Rally cars or trophy trucks, immediately before, during and immediately after rallies.

==Canada==
In Canada, all ten provinces follow a consistent set of national criteria issued by Transport Canada for specific equipment required as part of a street-legal vehicle. In some provinces, the &quot;Highway Traffic Act&quot; is a matter of provincial jurisdiction; provinces with such an Act include Ontario, Manitoba, and Newfoundland and Labrador.

Many but not all U.S.-model vehicles do qualify for import to Canada, but must meet requirements for items such as daytime running lights (standard on Canadian-market vehicles since 1991, but not required in the U.S.), anti-theft immobilisers, and anchorage points for child seats. Cars from other countries (such as the UK) typically do not qualify, as standards are too widely divergent from those in Canada.

==India==

Requirements for manufacturing, registering, and operating motor vehicles in India are codified by the Central Motor Vehicles Rules (CMVR), as maintained by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. Street-legal two-, three-, and four-wheeled vehicles must comply with structure, safety equipment, and operating conditions in CMVR 93–125.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, vehicles must pass the Single Vehicle Approval (SVA) scheme, a pre-registration inspection for cars and light goods vehicles that have not been type-approved to British or European standards. Since August 2001, there have been two levels of SVA, those being &#x27;standard&#x27; and &#x27;enhanced&#x27;. The standard SVA is applied to vehicles such as left-hand drive vehicles, personally imported vehicles, amateur-built vehicles and armoured vehicles, to name a few. Vehicles which do not fall into one of the standard SVA categories for example a vehicle of right-hand drive require enhanced SVA in addition to standard SVA inspections.

The SVA is in the process of being replaced by the Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA).

==United States==
In the United States, the individual states have the authority to determine, by means of statutes and regulations, which types of vehicles are permitted on public streets, as a function of police power. Vehicles that are considered street-legal in the U.S. include automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles. Some vehicles that are not generally sold for on-road driving such as all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and golf carts can potentially be adapted for street use, if permitted by state law.

Most requirements for automobiles are largely consistent between U.S. states. A notable exception is California emission control, which has traditionally been more strict than that in other states. Common requirements for automobiles include structure (examples: hood) and safety equipment (examples: headlamps and bumpers).

Common requirements for motorcycles include side view mirrors and a dedicated seat in order to transport a passenger. However, states vary widely on other equipment such as turn signals.

<doc id="888195" wikidata="Q4496151" url="?curid=888195" title="Louis Hartz">
<text>Louis Hartz (April 8, 1919 – January 20, 1986) was an American political scientist, historian, and a professor at Harvard, where he taught from 1942 until 1974. Hartz&#x27;s teaching and various writings—books and articles—have had an important influence on American political theory and comparative history.

==Early years==
Hartz was born in Youngstown, Ohio, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, but grew up in Omaha, Nebraska. After graduating from Technical High School in Omaha, he attended Harvard University, financed partly by a scholarship from the &quot;Omaha World Herald&quot;.

==Academic career==
Hartz graduated in 1940, spent a year traveling abroad on a fellowship, and returned to Harvard as a teaching fellow in 1942. He earned his doctorate in 1946 and became a full professor of government in 1956. Hartz was known at Harvard for his talented and charismatic teaching. He retired in 1974 because of ill health.

===&quot;The Liberal Tradition in America&quot;===
Hartz is best known for his classic book &quot;The Liberal Tradition in America&quot; (1955), which presented a view of the United States’s past that sought to explain its conspicuous absence of ideologies. Hartz argued that American political development occurs within the context of an enduring, underlying Lockean liberal consensus, which has shaped and narrowed the landscape of possibilities for U.S. political thought and behavior. Hartz attributed the triumph of the liberal worldview in America, amongst other reasons, to:
*its lack of a feudal past (and which would account for the absence of a struggle to overcome a conservative internal order); 
*its vast resources and open space; 
*the liberal values of the original settlers, who represented only a narrow middle-class slice of European society.

Hartz also wanted to explain the failure of socialism to become established in America, and he believed that Americans&#x27; widespread and generally consensual acceptance of classic liberalism was the major barrier.

===&quot;The Founding of New Societies&quot;===
Hartz edited and wrote substantial sections of &quot;The Founding of New Societies&quot; (1964), wherein he developed and expanded upon his “fragment thesis.” Hartz developed this thesis from the idea that those nations which originated as settler colonies are “fragments” of the original European nation that founded them. Hartz called them fragments because these colonies, in a sense, froze the class structure and underlying ideology prevalent in the mother country at the time of their foundation and did not experience the further evolution experienced in Europe. He considered Latin America and French Canada to be fragments of feudal Europe; the United States, English Canada, and Dutch South Africa to be liberal fragments; and Australia and English South Africa to be &quot;radical&quot; fragments (incorporating the nonsocialist working class radicalism of Britain in the early 19th century).

==Later years and death==
Hartz led a normal life until a sudden unexplained emotional disturbance changed his entire personality in 1971. He refused all medical help. He divorced in 1972, rejected all his friends, and feuded intensely with students, faculty and administrators. In 1974 he resigned from Harvard, but his scholarly skills and interests continued to remain strong. Hartz spent his last years living in London, New Delhi, New York City, then Istanbul, where he died of an epileptic seizure in January 1986.

==Legacy==
In 1956, the American Political Science Association awarded Hartz its Woodrow Wilson Prize for &quot;The Liberal Tradition in America&quot;, and in 1977 gave him its Lippincott Prize, designed to honor scholarly works of enduring importance. The book remains a key text in the political science graduate curriculum in American politics in universities today, in part because of the extensive, longrunning criticism and commentary that Hartz&#x27;s ideas have generated.

The Canadian context of Hartz&#x27;s fragment thesis was disseminated and elaborated upon by Gad Horowitz, in the latter’s essay &quot;Conservatism, Liberalism and Socialism in Canada: An Interpretation&quot; (1966). Horowitz&#x27;s use and interpretation of Hartz has been influential in Canadian political theory, and was still being actively debated well into the 21st century.

In Australia, Hartz&#x27;s fragment thesis &quot;received respectful attention, but ... did not win assent or committed followers&quot;, according to historian John Hirst. It was applied to early colonial history by feminist historian Miriam Dixson in &quot;The Real Matilda&quot; (1976), in which she traced gender relations in colonial New South Wales to the culture of the proletarian fragment identified by Hartz. In 1973, the &quot;Australian Economic History Review&quot; dedicated an issue to analysis of Hartz&#x27;s theory.

<doc id="888197" wikidata="Q2547918" url="?curid=888197" title="Griqualand West">
<text>Griqualand West is an area of central South Africa with an area of 40,000 km2 that now forms part of the Northern Cape Province. It was inhabited by the Griqua people – a semi-nomadic, Afrikaans-speaking nation of mixed-race origin, who established several states outside the expanding frontier of the Cape Colony. It was also ancestral home to the Tswana and Khoisan peoples.

In 1873 it was proclaimed as a British colony, with its capital at Kimberley, and in 1880 it was annexed by the Cape Colony. When the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, Griqualand West was part of the Cape Province but continued to have its own &quot;provincial&quot; sports teams.

==Early history==
The indigenous population of the area were the Khoi-khoi and Bushmen peoples, who were hunter-gatherers or herders. Early on they were joined by the agriculturalist Batswana, who migrated into the area from the north. They comprised the majority of the population throughout the region&#x27;s history, up until the present day. By the early 19th century the whole area came to be dominated by the powerful Griqua people, who gave the region its name.

==Independent Griqua state==
===Origins of the Griqua people===
The Griqua are a mixed people who originated in the intermarriages between Dutch colonists in the Cape and the Khoikhoi already living there. They turned into a semi-nomadic Afrikaans-speaking nation of horsemen who migrated out of the Cape Colony and established short-lived states on the Colony&#x27;s borderlands, similar to the Cossack states of imperial Russia.

The Dutch East India Company (VOC) did not intend the Cape Colony at the Southern tip of Africa to become a political entity. As it expanded and became more successful, its leaders did not worry about frontiers. The frontier of the colony was indeterminate and ebbed and flowed at the whim of individuals. While the VOC undoubtedly benefited from the trading and pastoral endeavours of the trekboers, it did little to control or support them in their quest for land. The high proportion of single Dutch men led to their taking indigenous women as wives and companions, and mixed-race children were born. They grew to be a sizeable population who spoke Dutch and were instrumental in developing the colony.

These children did not attain the social or legal status accorded their fathers, mostly because colonial laws recognised only Christian forms of marriage. This group became known as Basters, or bastards. The colonists, in their paramilitary response to insurgent resistance from Khoi and San people, readily conscripted the Basters into commandos. This ensured the men became skilled in lightly armed, mounted, skirmish tactics.

===Griqua migrations===
Equipped with guns and horses, many of the Basters who were recruited to war chose instead to abandon their paternal society and to strike out and live a semi-nomadic existence beyond the Cape&#x27;s frontier. The resulting stream of disgruntled, Dutch-speaking, trained marksmen leaving the Cape hobbled the Dutch capability to crew their commandos. It also created belligerent, skilled groups of opportunists who harassed the indigenous populations the length of the Orange River. Once free of the colonies, these groups called themselves the Oorlam. In particular, the group led by Klaas Afrikaner became notorious. He attracted enough attention from the Dutch authorities to cause him to be rendered to the colony and banished to Robben Island in 1761.

One of the most influential of these Oorlam groups was the &quot;Griqua&quot;. In the 19th century, the Griqua controlled several political entities which were governed by Kapteins or Kaptyns (Dutch for &quot;Captain&quot;, i.e. leader) and their Councils, with their own written constitutions. The Griqua had also largely adopted the Afrikaans language before their migrations.

Adam Kok I, the first Kaptein of the Griqua and recognised by the British, was originally a slave who had bought his own freedom. He led his people north from the interior of the Cape Colony. Probably because of discrimination against his people, they again moved north—this time outside the Cape, taking over areas previously controlled by San and Tswana people. This area, where most of the Griqua nation settled, was near the Orange River, just west of the Orange Free State, and on the southern skirts of the Transvaal. It came to be called Griqualand West, and the territory was centered on its capital &quot;Klaarwater&quot;, later renamed Griekwastad (&quot;Griquatown&quot;).

===Waterboer dynasty and Griqualand West===
While much of the Griqua people now settled, many remained nomadic, and Adam Kok&#x27;s people later split into several semi-nomadic nations. After a significant schism, a portion of the Griqua nation migrated to the south-east under the leadership of Adam Kok&#x27;s son Adam Kok II (to the south-east they were later to found Philippolis and then Griqualand East.

In the original area, which now came to be called Griqualand West, Andries Waterboer took over control and founded the powerful Waterboer dynasty. The Waterboer Kapteins ruled the region until the influx of Europeans accompanying the discovery of diamonds, and to some degree afterwards too.
In 1834, the Cape Colony recognized Waterboer&#x27;s rights to his land and people. It signed a treaty with him to ensure payment for the use of the land for mining. In both Griqualands, East and West, the Griqua were demographically outnumbered by the pre-existing Bantu people and, in some areas, by European settlers, and thus the two Griqualands maintained their Griqua identity only through political control.

==Diamond fields and land disputes==

In the years 1870–1871 a large number of diggers moved into Griqualand West and settled on the diamond fields near the junction of the Vaal and Orange rivers. This was land through which the Griqua regularly moved with their herds and it was additionally situated in part on land claimed by both the Griqua chief Nicholas Waterboer and by the Boer Republic of the Orange Free State.

In 1870, Transvaal President Marthinus Wessel Pretorius declared the diamond fields as Boer property and established a temporary government over the diamond fields. The administration of this body was not satisfactory to the Boers, the diggers, the Griqua or the indigenous Tswana. Tension rapidly grew between these parties until Stafford Parker, a former British sailor, organised a faction of the diggers to drive all of the Transvaal officials out of the area.

===Diggers Republic (1870–71)===
At the settlement of Klipdrift, on 30 July 1870 Stafford Parker declared the independent Klipdrift Republic (also known as the Digger&#x27;s Republic and the Republic of Griqualand West) and was also chosen as president. Klipdrift was promptly renamed &quot;Parkerton&quot; after the new president, who began to collect taxes (often at gunpoint). Factions in the Republic also implored the British Empire to impose its authority and annex the territory.

By December of the same year about 10 000 British settlers made their home in the new republic. The republic sat next to the Vaal River, but existed for an extremely short time. During the following year, Boer forces unsuccessfully attempted to regain the territory through negotiation. British Governor Sir Henry Barkly was asked to mediate. Barkly set up the Keate Committee to hear evidence and, in the famous &quot;Keate Award&quot;, ruled against the Boer Republics and in favour of Nicholas Waterboer.

==Direct British rule (1871–1880)==
At this juncture, Waterboer offered to place the territory under the administration of Queen Victoria.
The offer was accepted, and on 27 October 1871 the district, together with some adjacent territory to which the Transvaal had laid claim, was proclaimed (under the name of Griqualand West Colony) British territory.

===Further territorial disputes===

Territorial disputes continued, even after the British annexation. When the annexation had taken place, a party in the Orange Free State volksraad had wished to go to war with Britain but the wiser counsels of its president prevailed. The Orange Free State did not abandon its claims, believing that the diamond fields were the means of restoring the credit and prosperity of the Free State. Griqualand West was not financially viable, and carried with it enormous public debt. The matter continued for a considerable time and caused immense tension in southern Africa.

In the face of claims from the Orange Free State and the Griqua authorities, the &quot;Griqualand West Land Court&quot; was established in 1875, under Justice Andries Stockenström.
Waterboer&#x27;s claims to the diamond fields, strongly presented by his agent David Arnot, were based on the treaty concluded by his father with the British in 1834 and on various arrangements with the Kok chiefs; the Orange Free State based its claim on its purchase of Adam Kok&#x27;s sovereign rights and on long occupation. The difference between proprietorship and sovereignty was confused or ignored. That Waterboer exercised no authority in the disputed district was admitted.
In a crucial finding Stockenström ruled that, as the Griqua people were nomadic, the Griqua chiefs (or &quot;captains&quot;) were rulers over a people, but not over a fixed territory. The Griqua people had also only arrived in this part of southern Africa a little over 50 years before, in the early nineteenth century. The Griqua captains therefore did not automatically get the right to own &amp; develop all of the land through which they moved, but only those areas in which they would settle. Other areas they could continue to move through, but were not given automatic title to own and develop. This resulted in the denial of many of the titles issued by the powerful Griqua Captain Nicolaas Waterboer, outside of his core areas around Griquatown and Albania, were also denied. It also effectively ruled in favour of the Orange Free State.
A furore resulted, as accusations were leveled that Stockenström was biased, and sympathetic towards the Orange Free State President Johannes Brand.

A form of resolution eventually came about in July 1876, when Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, at that time secretary of state for the colonies, granted the Free State payment &quot;in full satisfaction of all claims which it considers it may possess to Griqualand West.&quot;

In the opinion of Dr Theal, who has written the history of the Boer Republics and has been a consistent supporter of the Boers, the annexation of Griqualand West was probably in the best interests of the Orange Free State. &quot;There was,&quot; he states, &quot;no alternative from British sovereignty other than an independent diamond field republic.&quot; At this time, largely owing to the exhausting struggle with the Basutos, the Free State Boers, like their Transvaal Republic neighbours, had drifted into financial straits. A paper currency had been instituted, and the notes, known as &quot;bluebacks&quot;, soon dropped to less than half their nominal value. Commerce was largely carried on by barter, and many cases of bankruptcy occurred in the state. But as British annexation in 1877 saved the Transvaal from bankruptcy, so did the influx of British and other immigrants to the diamond fields, in the early 1870s, restore public credit and individual prosperity to the Boers of the Free State. The diamond fields offered a ready market for stock and other agricultural produce. Money flowed into the pockets of the farmers. Public credit was restored. &quot; Bluebacks &quot; recovered par value, and were called in and redeemed by the government. Valuable diamond mines were also discovered within the Orange Free State, of which the one at Jagersfontein is the richest. Capital from Kimberley and London was soon provided with which to work them.

===Pressure on the Cape Colony to annex the territory===
After annexing Griqualand West, the British initially attempted to incorporate it into the Cape Colony, and put significant pressure on the Cape Government to annex it. The new Prime Minister of the Cape, John Molteno refused, citing the enormous public debt of the territory, as well as objections from portions of the indigenous and settler communities of Griqualand.

Local control continued to pass increasingly from the Griqua kaptijns into the hands of the growing digger community of the diamond fields. The prospect of complete dis-empowerment in a &quot;Diamond Fields Republic&quot; became a significant concern of the remaining Griqua.

Under pressure, the embattled Griqua leader Nicolaas Waterboer send a formal request to the Cape Government to request incorporation; a request that coincided with renewed pressure on the Cape Government to agree to the union.

==Union with Cape Colony (1880)==

On being presented with a request from Nicholas Waterboer for union with the Cape Colony, there had begun a protracted debate over whether Griqualand West should be joined to the Cape in a confederation, or whether it should be annexed to the Cape Colony in a total union. The former view was supported by Lord Carnarvon and the British Colonial Office in London – as a first step to bringing all of southern Africa into a British-ruled confederation.
The latter view was put forward by the Cape Parliament, particularly by its strong-willed Prime Minister John Molteno, who had initially opposed any form of union with the unstable and heavily indebted territory, and now demanded evidence from Britain that the local population would be consulted in the process. Suspicious of British motives, in 1876 he travelled to London as plenipotentiary to make the case that union was the only viable way that the Cape could administer the divided and underdeveloped territory, and that a lop-sided confederation would be neither economically viable, nor politically stable. In short, Griqualand West should either be united with the Cape, or kept totally independent from it.
After striking a deal with the Home Government and receiving assurances that local objections had been appeased, he passed the Griqualand West Annexation Act on 27 July 1877.

The act specified that Griqualand West would have the right to elect four representatives to the Cape parliament, two for Kimberley and two for the Barkly West region. This number was doubled in 1882 (&quot;Act 39 of 1882&quot;).
The Cape Government also enforced its non-racial system of Cape Qualified Franchise. This meant that all resident males could qualify for the vote, with the property-ownership qualifications for suffrage applied equally, regardless of race. This was welcomed by the Griqua, but rejected by the recently arrived diggers of the Kimberley diamond fields.
In the judiciary, the local Griqua attorney-general reported to the Cape Supreme Court, which got concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court of Griqualand West in the territory.

The implementation of the act was set for 18 October 1880, when Griqualand West was formally united with the Cape Colony, followed soon afterwards by Griqualand East.
==Current==
Today, Basters are a separate ethnic group of similarly mixed origins living in south-central Namibia; Northern Cape at Campbell and Griquatown; (the historic territory of Griqualand West); the Western Cape (around the small le Fleur Griqua settlement at Kranshoek); and at Kokstad.

The total Griqua population is unknown. The people were submerged by several factors. The most important factor were the racist policies of the Apartheid era, during which many of the Griqua people took on the mantle of &quot;Coloured&quot; fearing that their Griqua roots might place them at a lower level with than the blacks.

Genetic evidence indicates that the majority of the present Griqua population is descended from European, Khoikhoi and Tswana ancestors, with a small percentage of Bushman ancestry.

<text>Special K is an American brand of breakfast cereal and meal bars originally manufactured by Kellogg&#x27;s. The cereal was introduced to the United States in 1955. It is made primarily from grains such as lightly toasted rice, wheat and barley. Special K used to be marketed primarily as a low-fat cereal that can be eaten to help one lose weight. Following the 2023 spinoff of Kellogg&#x27;s North American cereal division, the cereal is manufactured by WK Kellogg Co for the United States, Canada, and Caribbean markets. The former Kellogg&#x27;s, renamed Kellanova, continues to manufacture the cereal for the rest of the world and the meal bars for all markets.

== Special K Challenge ==
The Special K brand previously advocated the &quot;Special K Challenge.&quot; The goal of this challenge was to help an individual lose six pounds in two weeks; this loss was achieved by eating specific Special K products throughout the day. The diet began with a single serving of any Special K cereal, accompanied with 2/3 cup of skim milk and a side of fruit. The second meal of the diet included either a Special K Protein Meal Bar, Special K Protein Shake, or another serving of Special K cereal with 2/3 cup of skim milk and a side of fruit. The third meal of the day could be consumed normally, without any Special K restrictions. Throughout the day, an individual is allotted two Special K snacking times, eating any of the following specified snacks: Special K Protein Meal Bars, Special K Protein Shakes, Special K Breakfast Shakes, Special K Protein Granola Bars, Special K Crackers, Special K Cracker Chips, or Special K Popcorn. For any additional snack servings, an individual could consume fruits and vegetables. During the challenge, drinks could be consumed normally.

Critics of the Special K diet feel that it may leave dieters feeling hungry because of its limited food options and deter people from sticking to the diet. The diet has been criticised for being too low in protein, fiber, vegetables, and fruits. The diet does not include guidance on how to change unhealthy overeating or lack of exercise and their importance to maintaining weight loss.

==Nutrition==
In the United States, Special K Original has 120 calories per 31g cup serving. One serving contains 0.5g fat, 23g carbohydrates, 4g sugar, and 6g protein. In the United Kingdom, Special K Original is 17% sugar, meaning a 30g serving contains 5g of sugar.

In the UK in 2014, an advertising campaign focused on a study run in collaboration with the Department of Human Sciences at Loughborough University, requiring overweight volunteer subjects to replace two meals a day with a bowl of the cereal, for a period of two weeks. At the conclusion of the study three-quarters of participants experienced fat loss.

==Varieties==
In the US, Special K cereal currently comes in fifteen different varieties: Original, Chocolatey Delight, Chocolatey Strawberry, Cinnamon Pecan, Red Berries, Vanilla Almond, Fruit &amp; Yogurt, Brown Sugar Gluten Free, Oats &amp; Honey, Touch of Honey Granola, Chocolate Almond, Cranberry Granola, Protein, Cinnamon Sugar Crunch Protein, Blueberry Lemon, and
Apple Cinnamon Crunch (Seasonal).

In the UK &amp; Ireland, Special K cereal comes in ten different varieties:
Original, Red Berries, Hazelnut &amp; Almond, Milk Chocolate, Strawberry and Chocolate, Fruit &amp; Nut, Creamy Berry Crunch, Peach &amp; Apricot, and
Yoghurty.

==Meal replacement==

In the US, Special K provides meal replacements in two forms: protein meal bars and protein shakes.

There are eleven varieties of Special K Protein Meal Bars: Mocha Crunch Protein, Chocolate Peanut Butter, Strawberry, Double Chocolate, Chocolatey Chip, Honey Almond, Cranberry Walnut, Chocolate Caramel, Chocolatey Brownie, and Chocolatey Dipped Mint.

There are eight varieties of Special K Protein Shakes: Milk Chocolate, Strawberry, French Vanilla, Rich Chocolate, Strawberry Banana, Chocolate Mocha, Vanilla Cappuccino, and Raspberry Cheesecake.

==Snacks==
Kellogg&#x27;s Special K snacks are marketed as low-fat alternatives to regular snacks. There are several varieties of Special K snacks, including Special K Protein Granola Bars, Special K Breakfast Shakes, Special K Cereal Bars, Special K CrackerChips, Special K Popcorn, and Special K Crackers.

There are four varieties of Special K Protein Granola Bars: Chocolatey Peanut Butter, Dark Chocolate, Greek Yogurt &amp; Fruit, and Almond Honey Oat.

There are five varieties of Special K Breakfast Shakes: Chocolate Mocha Coffee House, Vanilla Cappuccino Coffee House, Chocolate Delight,
Red Berries, and French Vanilla.

There are two varieties of Special K Cereal Bars: Red Berries, and Chocolatey Pretzel.

There are five varieties of Special K Cracker Chips: Sea Salt, Cheddar, Sour Cream &amp; Onion, Barbecue, and Salt &amp; Vinegar.

There are two varieties of Special K Popcorn: Kettle Corn and White Cheddar.

There is one variety of Special K Crackers: Multi-grain.

==Beverages==
===Special K2O Protein Water===

Kellogg&#x27;s Special K2O Protein Water was a beverage released in September 2006 by the Kellogg Company. It was produced in several flavors and has been marketed as a weight-control and weight-loss product. The product was re-launched in 2007 by the Kellogg Company. The product is no longer available. Special K2O Protein Water was available in several flavors, including Strawberry Kiwi, Lemon Twist, and Tropical Blend. Marketed as a low-calorie alternative protein drink, a 16-ounce bottle of K2O contains 5 grams of protein, 10% DV of calcium, and 50 calories. The product has also been marketed as a weight-loss product, and has been marketed as part of &quot;The Special K Challenge&quot; and &quot;Feeling good never looked better&quot; advertising campaigns.

On August 15, 2007, Kellogg&#x27;s re-launched Special K2O Protein Water with enhanced graphics and a new flavor, Mixed Berry. In addition to the 5 grams of protein, the product was formulated with 5 grams of soluble fiber, from polydextrose, and 20% DV each of vitamins B3 (Niacin), B6, and B12 while maintaining 50 calories. The product was also manufactured in a powdered form as a drink mix that is sold in packets, which is then added to water. The powdered product has 30 calories, 5 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving. The powdered mix has also been marketed as a weight-control product.

===Special K Protein Shakes===
Kellogg&#x27;s produces Special K Protein Shakes.

==Controversies==
=== Canada ===
Until mid-2014, Kellogg&#x27;s used a special Special K formula that was different in Canada from that used in the U.S. This formulation was similar to the original Special K introduced in the US in 1955. With the June 2014 closure of Kellogg&#x27;s London, Ontario plant, Canadians now eat Special K that is made in the U.S.

=== Denmark ===
Denmark has outlawed the addition of vitamins in Kellogg&#x27;s products since 2004. Danish health officials banned cereals containing added vitamins because they claimed Kellogg&#x27;s Special K wanted to add extremely high levels of vitamin B6, calcium, folic acid, and iron, which would reach toxic levels when eaten on a daily basis. Young children risk liver and kidney damage while the fetuses of pregnant women could suffer complications.

=== The Netherlands ===
In an episode aired on October 15, 2009, the Dutch television show &quot;&quot;, followed up one of Kellogg&#x27;s Special K nutritional claims, namely the addition of iron. The show provided evidence that the iron was not nutritional ionic iron—as it occurs in natural foods like spinach—but was, in fact, metallic iron. The nutritional experts in the show agreed that metallic iron should not be part of a diet. After the airing, the Dutch food authority nuanced the claims made in the TV program, claiming there are no health risks. They also challenged the claim that the cereal could contain &quot;shredded bites,&quot; and responded that iron powder is suitable for human consumption.

=== United States ===
In late February 2013, the company recalled three sizes of the Special K Red Berries in the US which may have contained pieces of glass.

<doc id="888207" wikidata="Q35245" url="?curid=888207" title="Etymology">
<text>Etymology ( ) is the study of the origin and evolution of words—including their constituent units of sound and meaning—across time. In the 21st century a subfield within linguistics, etymology has become a more rigorously scientific study. Most directly tied to historical linguistics, philology, and semiotics, it additionally draws upon comparative semantics, morphology, pragmatics, and phonetics in order to attempt a comprehensive and chronological catalogue of all meanings and changes that a word (and its related parts) carries throughout its history. The origin of any particular word is also known as its &quot;etymology&quot;.

For languages with a long written history, etymologists make use of texts, particularly texts about the language itself, to gather knowledge about how words were used during earlier periods, how they developed in meaning and form, or when and how they entered the language. Etymologists also apply the methods of comparative linguistics to reconstruct information about forms that are too old for any direct information to be available. By analyzing related languages with a technique known as the comparative method, linguists can make inferences about their shared parent language and its vocabulary. In this way, word roots in many European languages, for example, can be traced back to the origin of the Indo-European language family.

Even though etymological research originated from the philological tradition, much current etymological research is done on language families where little or no early documentation is available, such as Uralic and Austronesian.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;etymology&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek word (), itself from (), meaning , and the suffix , denoting .

The &quot;etymon&quot; refers to the predicate (i.e. stem or root) from which a later word or morpheme derives. For example, the Latin word , which means , is the etymon of English &quot;candid&quot;. Relationships are often less transparent, however. English place names such as &quot;Winchester&quot;, &quot;Gloucester&quot;, &quot;Tadcaster&quot; share different forms of a suffix that originated as the Latin .

&quot;Reflex&quot; is the name given to a descendant word in a daughter language, descended from an earlier language. For example, Modern English heat is the reflex of the Old English . Rarely, this word is used in reverse, and the reflex is actually the root word rather than the descendant word. However, this usage is usually filled by the term &quot;etymon&quot; instead. A reflex will sometimes be described simply as a &quot;descendant&quot;, &quot;derivative&quot; or &quot;derived&quot; from an etymon (but see below).

&quot;Cognates&quot; or &quot;lexical cognates&quot; are sets of words that have been inherited in direct descent from an etymological ancestor in a common parent language. &quot;Doublets&quot; or &quot;etymological twins&quot; or &quot;twinlings&quot; (or possibly triplets, and so forth) are specifically cognates within the same language. Although they have the same etymological root, they tend to have different phonological forms, and to have entered the language through different routes.

A &quot;root&quot; is the source of related words within a single language (no language barrier is crossed).
Similar to the distinction between &quot;etymon&quot; and &quot;root&quot;, a nuanced distinction can sometimes be made between a &quot;descendant&quot; and a &quot;derivative&quot;.

A &quot;derivative&quot; is one of the words which have their source in a root word, and were at some time created from the root word using morphological constructs such as suffixes, prefixes, and slight changes to the vowels or to the consonants of the root word. For example: &quot;unhappy&quot;, &quot;happily&quot;, and &quot;unhappily&quot; are all derivatives of the root word &quot;happy&quot;. The terms &quot;root&quot; and &quot;derivative&quot; are used in the analysis of morphological derivation within a language in studies that are not concerned with historical linguistics and that do not cross the language barrier.

== Methods ==

Etymologists apply a number of methods to study the origins of words, some of which are:
* Philological research. Changes in the form and meaning of the word can be traced with the aid of older texts, if such are available.
* Making use of dialectological data. The form or meaning of the word might show variations between dialects, which may yield clues about its earlier history.
* The comparative method. By a systematic comparison of related languages, etymologists may often be able to detect which words derive from their common ancestor language and which were instead later borrowed from another language.
* The study of semantic change. Etymologists must often make hypotheses about changes in the meaning of particular words. Such hypotheses are tested against the general knowledge of semantic shifts. For example, the assumption of a particular change of meaning may be substantiated by showing that the same type of change has occurred in other languages as well.

== Types of word origins ==
Etymological theory recognizes that words originate through a limited number of basic mechanisms, the most important of which are language change, borrowing (i.e., the adoption of loanwords from other languages); word formation such as derivation and compounding; and onomatopoeia and sound symbolism (i.e., the creation of imitative words such as &quot;click&quot; or &quot;grunt&quot;).

While the origin of newly emerged words is often more or less transparent, it tends to become obscured through time due to sound change or semantic change. Due to sound change, it is not readily obvious that the English word &quot;set&quot; is related to the word &quot;sit&quot; (the former is originally a causative formation of the latter). It is even less obvious that &quot;bless&quot; is related to &quot;blood&quot; (the former was originally a derivative term meaning &#x27;to mark with blood&#x27;).

Semantic change may also occur. For example, the English word &quot;bead&quot; originally meant &#x27;prayer&#x27;, and acquired its modern meaning through the practice of counting the recitation of prayers by using small objects strung together (beads). One type of semantic change involves the quotidianisation of metaphor.
Thus the word &quot;trauma&quot;, the predecessors of which apparently referenced an &quot;open hole&quot; in the body, has passed through some metaphorical stage or stages and now often refers to some sort of psychological wound.

== History ==
The search for meaningful origins for familiar or strange words is far older than the modern understanding of linguistic evolution and the relationships of languages, which began no earlier than the 18th century. Etymology has been a form of witty wordplay, in which the supposed origins of words were creatively imagined to satisfy contemporary requirements. For example, the Greek poet Pindar (born ) employed inventive etymologies to flatter his patrons. Plutarch employed etymologies insecurely based on fancied resemblances in sounds. Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &#x27; was an encyclopedic tracing of &quot;first things&quot; that remained uncritically in use in Europe until the sixteenth century. &#x27; is a grammatical encyclopedia edited at Constantinople during the 9th century, one of several similar Byzantine works. The 13th-century &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, as written by Jacobus de Voragine, begins each hagiography of a saint with a fanciful excursus in the form of an etymology.

=== Sanskrit ===

In ancient India, Sanskrit linguists and grammarians were the first to undertake comprehensive analyses of linguistics and etymology. The study of Sanskrit etymology has provided Western scholars with the basis of historical linguistics and modern etymology. Four of the most famous Sanskrit linguists are:
* Yāska ()
* Pāṇini ()
* Kātyāyana (6th-4th centuries BCE)
* Patanjali (2nd century BCE)

These were not the earliest Sanskrit grammarians, but rather followed an earlier line of scholars who lived several centuries earlier, who included Śākaṭāyana (814–760 BCE), and of whom very little is known. The earliest of attested etymologies can be found in the Vedas, in the philosophical explanations of the Brahmanas, Aranyakas, and Upanishads.

The analyses of Sanskrit grammar done by the previously mentioned linguists involved extensive studies on the etymology (called or in Sanskrit) of Sanskrit words, because the ancient Indians considered sound and speech itself to be sacred and, for them, the words of the Vedas contained deep encoding of the mysteries of the soul and God.

=== Greco-Roman ===
One of the earliest philosophical texts of the Classical Greek period to address etymology was the Socratic dialogue &quot;Cratylus&quot; () by Plato. During much of the dialogue, Socrates makes guesses as to the origins of many words, including the names of the gods. In his odes, Pindar spins complimentary etymologies to flatter his patrons. Plutarch (&quot;Life of Numa Pompilius&quot;) spins an etymology for , while explicitly dismissing the obvious, and actual &quot;bridge-builder&quot;:
The priests, called Pontifices... have the name of Pontifices from , powerful because they attend the service of the gods, who have power and command overall. Others make the word refer to exceptions of impossible cases; the priests were to perform all the duties possible; if anything lays beyond their power, the exception was not to be cavilled. The most common opinion is the most absurd, which derives this word from pons, and assigns the priests the title of bridge-makers. The sacrifices performed on the bridge were amongst the most sacred and ancient, and the keeping and repairing of the bridge attached, like any other public sacred office, to the priesthood.

=== Medieval ===

Isidore of Seville compiled a volume of etymologies to illuminate the triumph of religion. Each saint&#x27;s legend in Jacobus de Voragine&#x27;s &quot;Golden Legend&quot; begins with an etymological discourse on their name:
 Lucy is said of light, and light is beauty in beholding, after that S. Ambrose saith: The nature of light is such, she is gracious in beholding, she spreadeth over all without lying down, she passeth in going right without crooking by right long line; and it is without dilation of tarrying, and therefore it is showed the blessed Lucy hath beauty of virginity without any corruption; essence of charity without disordinate love; rightful going and devotion to God, without squaring out of the way; right long line by continual work without negligence of slothful tarrying. In Lucy is said, the way of light. 

=== Modern era ===
Etymology in the modern sense emerged in the late 18th-century European academia, in the context of the Age of Enlightenment, although preceded by 17th-century pioneers such as Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn, Gerardus Vossius, Stephen Skinner, Elisha Coles, and William Wotton. The first known systematic attempt to prove the relationship between two languages on the basis of similarity of grammar and lexicon was made in 1770 by the Hungarian, János Sajnovics, when he attempted to demonstrate the relationship between Sami and Hungarian.

The origin of modern historical linguistics is often traced to William Jones, a Welsh philologist living in India, who in 1782 observed the genetic relationship between Greek and Latin. Jones published his &quot;The Sanscrit Language&quot; in 1786, laying the foundation for the field of Indo-European studies. However, as early as 1727, a Jesuit missionary in India, père Gargam, theorized that Sanskrit could be a &quot;mother tongue arrived from another country&quot; for Telugu and Kannada because they contained many of the same Sanskrit terms; and in a letter to Abbé Barthélemy of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres in 1767, another Jesuit missionary in India, père Gaston-Laurent Coeurdoux, posed the question of the origin of the Sanskrit language and systematically argued his hypothesis of a &quot;commune origine&quot; of Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek, even putting Sanskrit terms and their Latin equivalents in columns. Although they sent many Sanskrit-related texts to the Bibliothèque du roi, such as literary translations, grammars, dictionaries, and other works, the Jesuit Missionaries in the Carnatic Region between 1695-1762, including Jean Calmette, Coeurdoux, Gargam, Jean François Pons, and others, have only recently begun receiving more attention in modern scholarship for their early contributions to fields like Indo-European Studies, historical linguistics, and comparative philology. 

The study of etymology in Germanic philology was introduced by Rasmus Rask in the early 19th century and elevated to a high standard with the &quot;&quot; (&quot;German Dictionary&quot;) compiled by the Brothers Grimm. The successes of the comparative approach culminated in the Neogrammarian school of the late 19th century. Still, Friedrich Nietzsche used etymological strategies (principally and most famously in &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot;, but also elsewhere) to argue that moral values have definite historical origins, where the meaning of concepts such as good and evil are shown to have changed over time according to the value-system that appropriates them. This strategy gained popularity in the 20th century, and philosophers, such as Jacques Derrida, have used etymologies to indicate former meanings of words to de-center the &quot;violent hierarchies&quot; of Western philosophy.

== Notable etymologists ==
* Ernest Klein (1899–1983), Hungarian-born Romanian-Canadian linguist, etymologist
* Marko Snoj (born 1959), Indo-Europeanist, Slavist, Albanologist, lexicographer, and etymologist
* Anatoly Liberman (born 1937), linguist, medievalist, etymologist, poet, translator of poetry and literary critic
* Michael Quinion (born )

<text>See&#x27;s Candy Shops, Inc., doing business as See&#x27;s Candies, is an American manufacturer and distributor of candy, particularly chocolates. It was founded by Charles See, his wife Florence, and his mother Mary in Los Angeles, California, in 1921. The company is now headquartered in South San Francisco, California. See&#x27;s kitchens are located at its headquarters and are also maintained at its original factory in Los Angeles, where there are also retail shops. It also has an office in Carson, California. The company has been owned by Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway Corporation since 1972.

==Location and market area==
The See&#x27;s Candies company primarily sells its products at its own stores, along with those of fellow Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary, Nebraska Furniture Mart. See&#x27;s Candies operates more than 200 stores in the following U.S. states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. Most See&#x27;s Candies stores are found in shopping centers. However, the company also operates a number of stand-alone stores, along with stores inside airport terminals across the United States. More than 70% of the company&#x27;s stores are in California. There are also stores outside the U.S. in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea (taking advantage of the proximity of its main plant to San Francisco International Airport). Seasonallyprimarily during the year-end holiday shopping seasonSee&#x27;s also offers its product in select markets in kiosks at malls and other shopping centers.

See&#x27;s sells its product outside these areas directly to consumers via mail order catalog and online orders, in order to control the age of its product. 

See&#x27;s Candies temporarily suspended operations in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first such suspension since World War II, when it became difficult to acquire sugar and other ingredients due to the war effort. The company began to restore operations a month later, after implementing appropriate safety precautions. 

See&#x27;s Candies opened a store in Abu Dhabi in Nation Towers in 2020.

==History==
Charles Alexander See II (1882–1949) arrived in the United States from Canada in 1921 with his wife Florence MacLean Wilson See (1885–1956) and his widowed mother Mary Wiseman See (1854–1939). Mary See had developed the recipes that became the foundation of the See&#x27;s candy business while helping run her husband&#x27;s hotel on Tremont Island, one of the Thousand Islands, in Ontario, Canada.

The family opened the first See&#x27;s Candies shop and kitchen at 135 North Western Avenue in Los Angeles in November 1921. They had twelve shops by the mid-1920s and operated thirty shops during the Great Depression. See&#x27;s first white and black &quot;all porcelain&quot; store was opened in Bakersfield, California, on May 1, 1941.

In 1936, See&#x27;s opened a shop in San Francisco. It moved operations to make creams and truffles (60% of product sales) to South San Francisco in order to take advantage of the location&#x27;s cold weather.

Laurance A. See&#x27;s divorce from his wife Elizabeth led to a landmark community property opinion in 1962 by Chief Justice Roger J. Traynor of the California Supreme Court for a unanimous court. According to the opinion, Laurance worked for See&#x27;s Candies, Inc. for the entirety of the twenty-one years of his marriage, served as president of its retail subsidiary for most of that time, and &quot;received more than $1,000,000 in salaries from the two corporations&quot;. The &quot;See&quot; case is still included in 21st century textbooks for future lawyers and financial advisers.

In 1972, the See family sold the company, which generated $4 million in pre-tax profit that year, to Berkshire Hathaway for $25 million. On January 3, 1972, Blue Chip obtained a controlling interest in See&#x27;s Candy Shops. Blue Chip later acquired 100% of See&#x27;s for an overall price of $25 million. Wesco Financial Corporation was an 80.1% owned subsidiary of Blue Chip Stamps until its complete merger into Berkshire Hathaway in 2011. Warren Buffett has called See&#x27;s &quot;the prototype of a dream business.&quot; (2007) At a 1996 luncheon in San Francisco, Charlie Munger revealed that See&#x27;s was the first high quality business that Berkshire ever bought. Previous to that point, Berkshire had focused on undervalued assets that could be bought cheaply. The See&#x27;s acquisition influenced their commitment to buying businesses with a strong reputation and brand recognition.

See&#x27;s production and warehouse workers are unionized. 

The &quot;couverture&quot; chocolate used by See&#x27;s is provided by the nearby Guittard Chocolate Company, and nuts come from Mariani Nut Company of nearby Winters, California. On June 20, 2012, See&#x27;s Candies was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records for the world&#x27;s largest lollipop, a giant chocolate lollipop weighing and measuring long, wide, and high, equivalent to 145,000 regular-size lollipops. The previous largest lollipop record stood at .

== In popular culture ==

In 1952, Lucille Ball and Vivian Vance spent a half day at the See&#x27;s Candies store on La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles, learning to dip chocolates and work the production line, in preparation for the &quot;Job Switching&quot; episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. The episode, which featured Lucy and Ethel getting jobs in a chocolate factory, became one of the most popular in the show&#x27;s history.

Singer Cher was working at See&#x27;s in 1962 when she met Sonny Bono; she quit her job to become his housekeeper.

In a 1987 Kidsongs video &quot;What I Want to Be&quot;, the Kidsongs Kids visit the See&#x27;s Candies factory during &quot;The Candy Man&quot; song sequence.

In 1994, at a See&#x27;s Candies location in South San Francisco, a driver delivering a bulk order of chocolate fell asleep while his truck was hooked up to one of the vats and pumping; the adjacent El Camino Real and Spruce Avenue were flooded with chocolate. Workers had to shovel it away from the storm drains once the fog had cooled it.

A factory was visited to research the Sugar Rush sequence for Wreck-It Ralph.

See&#x27;s Candies was featured by Huell Howser in &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot; Episode 908.

Every year the South San Francisco facility mounts oversized holiday decorations atop its plant for Christmas, Thanksgiving, Valentine&#x27;s Day, Mothers&#x27; Day, and Independence Day.

On Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher&#x27;s 2020 Netflix show, &quot;Never Have I Ever&quot;, main character Devi Vishwakumar&#x27;s mother keeps a cabinet of See&#x27;s Candies as housewarming/hostess gifts.

<text>Plain Old Documentation (pod) is a lightweight markup language used to document the Perl programming language as well as Perl modules and programs.

==Design==
Pod is designed to be a simple, clean language with just enough syntax to be useful. It purposefully does not include mechanisms for fonts, images, colors or tables. Some of its goals are:
* Easy to parse
* Easy to convert to other formats, such as XML, TeX or Markdown
* Easy to incorporate sample code
* Easy to read without a pod formatter (i.e. in its source-code form)
* Easy to write in

An extended version of pod that supports tables and footnotes called PseudoPOD has been used by O&#x27;Reilly &amp; Associates to produce several Perl books, most notably &quot;Programming Perl&quot; by Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen, and Jon Orwant.

Pod makes it easy to write manual pages, which are well suited to user-oriented documents. In contrast, other documentation systems, such as Python&#x27;s Docstring or Java&#x27;s Javadoc, though they can be used for user documentation, are designed to facilitate generating developer-oriented documentation about the source code for a software project.

==Use==

Pod is the language used for most documentation in the Perl world. This includes Perl itself, nearly all publicly released modules, many scripts, most design documents, many articles on Perl.com and other Perl-related web sites,
and the Parrot virtual machine.

Pod is rarely read in the raw, although it is designed to be readable without the assistance of a formatting tool. Instead, it is read with the perldoc tool, or converted into Unix man pages or Web-standard HTML pages.

It is also possible to use pod in other contexts than Perl. For example, to add simple documentation to bash scripts, which can then be easily converted to man pages. Such uses rely on language-specific hacks to hide the pod part(s), such as (in bash) prefixing the POD section with the line codice_1 which works by calling bash&#x27;s no-op codice_2 command, with the whole block of Pod as a here document as input to it.

Pure pod files usually have the extension codice_3, but pod is mostly used directly in Perl
code, which typically uses the codice_4 and codice_5 extensions. (The Perl
interpreter&#x27;s parser is designed to ignore pod in Perl code.) In source code files, the documentation is generally placed after the codice_6 marker (which also helps syntax highlighting in some editors to display it as comments).

Pod can easily be converted to other formats, for example some of the various Wiki formats like: WikiWikiWeb, Kwiki, TWiki, UseModWiki, TiddlyWiki, Textile, MediaWiki, MoinMoin or Confluence using Pod::Simple::Wiki.

==Example==

This document is syntactically correct pod, which attempts to follow the major conventions on section naming as well.
==Formatting details==

Pod files are written in an ASCII-compatible encoding, such as Latin-1 or UTF-8. A pod parser always assumes that the file it is parsing doesn&#x27;t start with pod; it ignores all lines
until it sees a pod directive. pod directives must come at the beginning of a line, and all begin with an equal sign. The pod parser will then assume that all following lines are pod, until it encounters a line consisting of the &quot;=cut&quot; directive. Any content following that is ignored until the parser encounters another pod directive. Thus, pod can be intermixed with executable source code if the language&#x27;s parser knows how to recognize and ignore pod.

Pod content is divided into paragraphs by empty lines. Paragraphs that begin with whitespace characters—tabs or spaces—are considered to be &quot;verbatim paragraphs&quot;, and are left completely unformatted; these are used for sample code, ASCII art, etc. Paragraphs that begin with an equal sign are &quot;command paragraphs&quot;; the sequence of alphanumeric characters immediately following the equal sign is treated as a pod directive, and the rest of the paragraph is formatted according to that directive. Some directives also affect the following paragraphs. If a paragraph starts with something besides an equal sign or whitespace, it&#x27;s considered an &quot;ordinary paragraph&quot;.

Both ordinary paragraphs and the contents of command paragraphs are parsed for formatting codes. Formatting in pod is very plain; it&#x27;s mainly limited to bold, italic, underlined, monospaced, and a few other formats. There is also a code for linking between pod documents or to another section within the same document. Formatting codes consist of either:

* A single uppercase letter, followed by a less-than sign (&lt;), the content to be formatted, and a greater-than sign (&gt;), e.g. codice_7, &quot;or&quot;
* A single uppercase letter, two or more less-than signs («), a space, the content to be formatted, another space, and the same number of greater-than signs as were used before, e.g. codice_8. This form is often used for code snippets containing a greater-than sign, which would otherwise end the formatting code.

Commands in pod include four levels of headings, bulleted and numbered lists, and commands to mark sections as being in another language. The latter feature allows for special formatting to be given to parsers that support it.

<text>Teledyne Technologies Incorporated is an American industrial conglomerate. It was founded in 1960, as Teledyne, Inc. by Henry Singleton and George Kozmetsky.

From August 1996 to November 1999, Teledyne existed as part of the conglomerate Allegheny Teledyne Incorporated – a combination of the former Teledyne, Inc. and the former Allegheny Ludlum Corporation. On November 29, 1999, three separate entities, Teledyne Technologies, Allegheny Technologies, and Water Pik Technologies, were spun off as free-standing public companies. Allegheny Technologies retained several companies of the former Teledyne, Inc. that fit with Allegheny&#x27;s core business of steel and exotic metals production.

At various times, Teledyne, Inc. owned more than 150 companies with interests as varied as insurance, dental appliances, specialty metals, and aerospace electronics, but many of these had been divested prior to the merger with Allegheny. The new Teledyne Technologies was initially composed of 19 companies that were earlier in Teledyne, Inc. By 2011, Teledyne Technologies had grown to include nearly 100 companies.

==Segments==
Teledyne Technologies operates with four major segments: Digital Imaging, Instrumentation, Engineered Systems, and Aerospace and Defense Electronics.

===Digital imaging===

This segment handles sponsored and central research laboratories for a range of new technologies, as well as development and production efforts in digital imaging products for government applications. Included are infrared detectors, cameras, and opto-mechanical assemblies.

===Instrumentation===
This segment provides monitoring and control instruments for marine, environmental, scientific, industrial, and defense applications as well as harsh environment interconnect products.

===Engineered systems===
This segment provides systems engineering and integration, advanced technology application, software development, and parts to space, military, environmental, energy, chemical, biological and nuclear systems, and missile defense requirements. It also designs and manufactures hydrogen gas generators, thermoelectric and fuel-based power sources, and small turbine engines.

===Aerospace and defense electronics===
This segment provides complex electronic components and subsystems for communication products, including defense electronics, data acquisition and communications equipment for air transport and business aircraft, and components and subsystems for wireless and satellite communications, as well as general aviation batteries.

==History==
In June 1960, Henry Singleton and George Kozmetsky, both previously executives with Litton Industries, formed a firm named Instrument Systems located in Beverly Hills, California. Arthur Rock, one of America&#x27;s first and most successful venture capitalists, financed the startup with a $450,000 investment. Their basic plan was to build a major firm centering on microelectronics and control system development, primarily through acquiring existing companies.

===Early years===
In October 1960, the first acquisition was made by purchasing the majority of stock in Amelco, a small electronics manufacturing plant. Within a short time, rights to the name Teledyne and its associated logo were bought. In addition to Amelco, two other electronics manufacturing firms were acquired, and by the end of 1960, Teledyne had about 400 employees and of floor space devoted to engineering development and manufacturing. Teledyne stock was first offered to the public in May 1961. During its first full fiscal year of operations ending in October 1961, Teledyne had sales of $4,491,000 with a net income of $58,000.

Teledyne’s growth continued in 1962, with the acquisition of companies primarily through equity agreements. Internally, Teledyne Systems was formed as the centerpiece of the firm’s aerospace systems business, diversifying the business base into government contracts with NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). By the end of the second fiscal year, Teledyne sales had increased 230 percent and net income by about 570 percent.

Over the next three years, new companies were acquired in microwave and power electrical products – including the first consumer products. Teledyne Controls was established, moving the Company into the field of hydraulics. Teledyne entered the optics field with the acquisition of Kiernan Optics, producing windows for the Apollo spacecraft and infrared optical domes for missiles.

In early 1965, Teledyne had a major breakthrough in winning a large contract from the U.S. Navy for the Integrated Helicopter Avionics System (IHAS), giving Teledyne a name in the military market. This caused a major jump in the stock price, from $15 to $65. By the end of the fiscal year, Teledyne had acquired 34 companies, sales were $86.5 million with net income of $3.4 million, there were about 5,400 employees, assets reached $66.5 million, and there were near 8 million outstanding shares of stock.

===Major growth years===
A new era for Teledyne started in 1966. In June, Kozmetsky left to become dean of the School of Business Administration at the University of Texas. In July, Vanadium-Alloy Steel Company (Vasco), including its subsidiary Allvac, was merged into Teledyne. This expanded the company into the Eastern U.S. and started the formation of material technologies as a major business activity of Teledyne. With the merger, Singleton turned his position of president over to George A. Roberts, a close friend from Naval Academy days, who had headed Vasco.

Singleton, now assisted by Roberts, continued in acquiring new companies. In 1967, one of the largest of these was Brown Engineering, a firm with about 3,500 employees headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama. With NASA and DoD contracts for engineering services and research, Brown Engineering added a new line of business for Teledyne. Ryan Aeronautical in San Diego, was acquired in 1968. Continental Motors was primarily owned by Ryan, and this acquisition brought Teledyne into the piston-powered engine business with both commercial and military customers.

In the remainder of the 1960s, Teledyne acquired some 90 more companies. A number of these businesses were in consumer products, such as Water Pik, Acoustic Research with high-fidelity speakers, and Olson Electronics, a mail order retailer founded in 1927, in Akron, Ohio, as Olson Co., by Irving, later including brothers, Sidney and Philip, that operated retail stores across America. Packard Bell Corporation had both consumer and government sales in computers and television receivers. A number of electronic product lines and smaller acquisitions were consolidated in Teledyne Electronics and Teledyne Microelectronic Technologies. Two acquired firms, &quot;Geophysical Exploration&quot; and &quot;Geotronics&quot;, brought Teledyne into off-shore drilling and earth-science instrumentation fields. Twenty-one acquired companies were in the metals business, including Wah Chang Corporation and &quot;Cast Products&quot;, and this led to the acquisition of firms producing industrial machines and machine tools. Other diverse acquisitions included Monarch Rubber, Sewart Seacraft, Isotopes, Radar Relays, Getz Dental, and the agreement with Subaru to market Wisconsin engines.

Singleton also added a diverse group of financial institutions, giving Teledyne contact and intimacy with the capital world. These included thrift and loan banks and insurance firms dealing with property, workers compensation, casualty, and life insurance. Most of the insurance investments were later consolidated into the Argonaut and Unitrin subsidiaries, and were ultimately spun off as independent companies.

Teledyne was divided into groups, and by the end of the 1960s, there were 16 groups with 94 profit centers in 120 locations. Company presidents were given considerable freedom in their operations, but corporate maintained close financial control and capital management. Teledyne sales in 1969 were $2.7 billion and net income was $372 million. The stock had a 2-for-1 split during 1967 and the same split in 1969.

As Teledyne moved into its second decade, some 150 firms had been acquired. Singleton then essentially stopped direct acquisition of companies and began investments in stock of technical firms. By the end of the second decade, Teledyne owned 31 percent of Curtiss-Wright, 24 percent of Litton, as well as significant portions of a number of other well-known companies. This stock was mainly held by the insurance subsidiaries.

In the &quot;bear&quot; market of the early 1970s, Teledyne stock fell from about $40 to less than $8; Singleton saw this as an opportunity to buy back Teledyne stock. In buybacks from October 1972 to February 1976, 22 million shares were repurchased at $14 to $40 – well above the market price. This raised the value of Teledyne stock, eventually increasing to near $175 at the end of the decade. In this period, annual income increased by 89 percent and net income by 315 percent. Stockholders who had remained through the buyback achieved a phenomenal gain of about 3,000 percent.

===Peak and decline===
Going into its third decade, Teledyne sales passed the $3 billion mark in 1980, with industrial products leading in both sales and net income. In the race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, government sales reached almost $800 million. The first significant slump in Teledyne business began in 1985. Sales for 1984 had been about $3.49 billion, but decreased to around $3.26 billion the next year and remained essentially flat for the remainder of the decade.
In April 1986, Singleton, who was then 69 years old, turned the position of CEO over to Roberts, but remained as Board Chairman. During 1988, Teledyne faced a number of legal problems, none of which were the direct result of wrongdoings of Singleton or Roberts. After agreeing to plead guilty to officials in Teledyne Electronics having made false statements, Teledyne was fined $17.5 million.

After guiding Teledyne for 29 years, Singleton retired as an employee and officer in April 1989. Nevertheless, that was a peak year for Teledyne sales ($3.53 billion) and earnings ($392 million). Teledyne stock price reached $388.88. Total employment also peaked at near 43,000.

Henry Singleton retired as Teledyne Chairman in 1991, and was replaced by George Roberts; William P. Rutledge was named president and CEO. Roberts then retired in 1993 and was replaced by Rutledge; Donald B. Rice, previously Secretary of the U.S. Air Force, was then named president and CEO. Many companies had been sold during the prior several years, and in 1993, through consolidations, the number was further reduced from 65 to 18. In January 1995, Teledyne Electronic Systems was sold to Litton Industries, essentially ending the business on which Teledyne had originally been formed.

In the early 1990s, while the company underwent these turnovers in leadership, two lawsuits were brought against Teledyne by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act. The suits charged the company with falsifying test reports for relay devices sold to the US government for weapons and spacecraft use, and with padding government contract cost estimates. In April 1994, Teledyne settled both cases for $112.5 million, at the time one of the largest settlements by military contractors in a qui tam case.

In late 1994, Teledyne was subjected to a hostile takeover attempt by WHX Corporation. This was successfully challenged, but the Teledyne pension fund had a surplus of $928 million and this was of wide interest. To forestall further hostile takeovers, Allegheny Ludlum, a steel and specialty metal firm, offered to serve as a white knight friendly acquirer. On August 15, 1996, an agreement was reached to merge Teledyne with Allegheny Ludlum, forming Allegheny Teledyne, Inc. (ATI), with headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

After some reorganization, ATI operated with three segments: Aerospace and Electronics, Specialty Metals, and Consumer Products. The former Teledyne high-technology companies were mainly in the A&amp;E Segment, led by Robert Mehrabian. ATI eventually decided to spin off the segments into independent entities, and on November 29, 1999, Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, and Water Pik Technologies, Inc., were formed.

===21st century renewal===
With Robert Mehrabian as chairman, CEO, and president, Teledyne Technologies (or simply Teledyne, as it is most often called) was initially composed of 19 companies, all dating (in some form) from the original Teledyne, Inc. There were about 5,800 employees, including some 1,400 engineers and scientists. One of these companies, Ryan Aeronautical, was sold to Northrop Grumman before the end of 1999 to raise initial operating capital.

In November 1999, Teledyne acquired certain assets of &quot;Mattituck Aviation Corporation&quot;, a privately owned aftermarket supplier and piston engine rebuilder and overhauler to the general aviation marketplace.

Headquarters was initially in the Century City district of Los Angeles, but was later moved to one of the city&#x27;s suburbs, Thousand Oaks. The Thousand Oaks location was the site of the Rockwell Scientific Company (formerly Rockwell International Science Center). Teledyne acquired Rockwell Scientific in 2006, and continued doing scientific and industrial research at the site (as Teledyne Scientific Company), in addition to having its corporate offices there.

In 2000, its first full year of operation, Teledyne Technologies had sales of $795.1 million and net income of $40.5 million. The renewed Teledyne operated in much the same manner as Singleton’s early Teledyne, functioning as a conglomerate with growth mainly due to acquisitions. In 2010, the sales were $1,644.2 million with net income of $120.5 million, a cumulative financial growth in the decade of approximately 100 percent. About 44 percent of the 2010 sales were derived from contracts with agencies of, or prime contractors to, the U.S. government. By the start of 2011, there were near 100 companies, functioning in a wide range of products and services.

Teledyne reported third quarter 2019 net sales of $802.2 million, a 10.6% increase compared to 2018.

On 4 January 2021, it was announced Teledyne Technologies would acquire FLIR Systems for $8 billion.

In 2021, Teledyne MEMS, which is in part composed by Teledyne DALSA, was ranked second in global revenues in the MEMS field.

In October 2023, Teledyne Technologies acquired Xena Networks, a high-speed terabit Ethernet validation, assurance, and production test solutions provider.

Teledyne Technologies was sanctioned by the Chinese government on December 5, 2024 due to arm sales to Taiwan.

<text>The Battle of Liège (5–16 August 1914) was the opening engagement of the German invasion of Belgium and the first battle of the First World War. The city of Liège was protected by a ring of modern fortresses, one of several fortified cities to delay an invasion to allow troops from the powers which had guaranteed Belgian neutrality to assist the Belgian Army in the expulsion of the invaders.

The German 1st Army arrived late 5 August 1914 and captured the city on 7 August when Erich Ludendorff drove in and convinced the garrison to surrender. The surrounding forts fought on and several attacks by German infantry were costly failures. Super-heavy siege guns arrived and destroyed the forts one by one; the last fort surrendered on 16 August.

The siege of Liège may have delayed the German invasion of France by four to five days. Railways in the Meuse river valley needed by the German armies in eastern Belgium were closed for the duration of the siege and German troops did not appear in strength before the city of Namur at the confluence of the Sambre and Meuse rivers until 20 August. With the experience gained at Liège, the German 2nd Army completed the Siege of Namur in two days.

==Background==
===Strategic developments===

====Belgium====
Belgian military planning was based on an assumption that other powers would expel an invader. The likelihood of a German invasion did not lead to France and Britain being seen as allies or for the Belgian government to intend to do more than protect its independence. The Anglo-French Entente (1904) had led the Belgians to perceive that the British attitude to Belgium had changed and that it was seen as a British protectorate. A General Staff was formed in 1910 but the (Chief of the General Staff), Lieutenant-Général Harry Jungbluth was retired on 30 June 1912 and not replaced until May 1914 by Lieutenant-General Chevalier de Selliers de Moranville who began planning for the concentration of the army and met railway officials on 29 July.

Belgian troops were to be massed in central Belgium, in front of the national redoubt ready to face any border. On mobilisation, the King became Commander-in-Chief and chose where the army was to concentrate. Amid the disruption of the new rearmament plan, the disorganised and poorly trained Belgian soldiers would benefit from a central position, to delay contact with an invader but it would also need fortifications for defence, which were on the frontier. A school of thought wanted a return to a frontier deployment in line with French theories of the offensive. Belgian plans became a compromise in which the field army concentrated behind the Gete River with two divisions forward at Liège and Namur.

====Germany====

German strategy had given priority to offensive operations against France and a defensive posture against Russia since 1891. German planning was determined by numerical inferiority, the speed of mobilisation and concentration and the effect of the vast increase of the power of modern weapons. Frontal attacks were expected to be costly and protracted, leading to limited success, particularly after the French and Russians modernised their fortifications on the frontiers with Germany. Alfred von Schlieffen, Chief of the Imperial German General Staff (, OHL) from devised a plan to evade the French frontier fortifications with an offensive on the northern flank, which would have a local numerical superiority and obtain rapidly a decisive victory. By such a manoeuvre was intended to pass swiftly through Belgium, between Antwerp and Namur and threaten Paris from the north. Helmuth von Moltke the Younger succeeded Schlieffen in 1906 and was less certain that the French would conform to German assumptions. Moltke adapted the deployment and concentration plan, to accommodate an attack in the centre or an enveloping attack from both flanks as variants, by adding divisions to the left flank opposite the French frontier, from the which were expected to be mobilised in the (western army). The main German force would still advance through Belgium to attack southwards into France, the French armies would be enveloped on their left and pressed back over the Meuse, Aisne, Somme, Oise, Marne and Seine rivers, unable to withdraw into central France. The French would either be annihilated by the manoeuvre from the north or it would create conditions for victory in the centre or in Lorraine on the common border.

====Declarations of war====
At midnight on the German government sent an ultimatum to Russia and announced a state of during the day; the Ottoman government ordered mobilisation and the London Stock Exchange closed. On 1 August the British government ordered the mobilisation of the navy, the German government ordered general mobilisation and declared war on Russia. Hostilities commenced on the Polish frontier, the French government ordered general mobilisation and next day the German government sent an ultimatum to Belgium, demanding passage through Belgian territory, as German troops crossed the frontier of Luxembourg. Military operations began on the French frontier, Libau was bombarded by a German light cruiser and the British government guaranteed naval protection for French coasts. On 3 August the Belgian Government refused German demands and the British Government guaranteed military support to Belgium, should Germany invade. Germany declared war on France, the British government ordered general mobilisation and Italy declared neutrality. On 4 August the British government sent an ultimatum to Germany and declared war on Germany at midnight on Central European Time. Belgium severed diplomatic relations with Germany and Germany declared war on Belgium. German troops crossed the Belgian frontier and attacked Liège.

===Tactical developments===

====Liège forts====

Liège is situated at the confluence of the Meuse which, at the city, flows through a deep ravine and the Ourthe River, between the Ardennes to the south and Maastricht (in the Netherlands) and Flanders to the north and west. The city lies on the main rail lines from Germany to Brussels and Paris, which Schlieffen and Moltke planned to use in an invasion of France. Much industrial development had taken place in Liège and the vicinity, which presented a considerable obstacle to an invading force. The main defences were a ring of twelve forts from the city, built in 1892 by Henri Alexis Brialmont, the leading fortress engineer of the nineteenth century. The forts were sited about apart to be mutually supporting but had been designed for frontal, rather than all-round defence.

The forts were five large triangular (Barchon, Fléron, Boncelles, Loncin and Pontisse), four small triangular (Evegnée, Hollogne, Lantin and Liers) and two small square forts (Chaudfontaine and Embourg). The forts were built of concrete, with a surrounding ditch and barbed-wire entanglements; the superstructures were buried and only mounds of concrete or masonry and soil were visible. The large forts had two armoured turrets with two guns each, one turret with two guns and two cupolas with a howitzer each. Four retractable turrets contained a  quick-firer each, two before the citadel and two at the base. A retractable searchlight was built behind the turret with a range of . Small forts had a howitzer cupola and three of the quick-firers. The heavy guns and quick-firers used black powder ammunition, long superseded in other armies, which raised clouds of smoke and obscured the view of the gunners. The guns had the greatest range at but the black powder smoke limited the realistic range to about . The forts contained magazines for the storage of ammunition, crew quarters for up to and electric generators for lighting. Provision had been made for the daily needs of the fortress troops but the latrines, showers, kitchens and the morgue had been built in the counterscarp, which could become untenable if fumes from exploding shells accumulated, because the forts were ventilated naturally.
The forts could communicate with the outside by telephone and telegraph but the wires were not buried. Smaller fortifications and trench lines in the gaps between the forts had been planned by Brialmont but had not been built. The fortress troops were not at full strength and many men were drawn from local guard units, who had received minimal training due to the reorganisation of the Belgian army begun in 1911, which was not scheduled to be complete until 1926. The forts also had soldiers and of the 3rd Infantry Division and 15th Infantry Brigade to defend the gaps between forts, fortress troops and members of the paramilitary , equipped with rifles and machine-guns. The garrison of men and was insufficient to man the forts and field fortifications. In early August 1914, the garrison commander was unsure of the troops which he would have at his disposal, since until 6 August, it was possible that all of the Belgian army would advance towards the Meuse.

The terrain in the fortress zone was difficult to observe from the forts because many ravines ran between them. Interval defences had been built just before the battle but were insufficient to stop German infiltration. The forts were also vulnerable to attack from the rear, the direction from which the German bombardments were fired. The forts had been designed to withstand shelling from guns which, in 1890, were the largest mobile artillery in the world but the concrete used was not of the best quality and by 1914 the German army had the first of the much larger 420 mm howitzers, (L/12 14 ) and could call on Austro-Hungarian 305 mm howitzers ( M. 11). The Belgian 3rd Division (Lieutenant-General Gérard Léman) along with the attached 15th Infantry Brigade defended Liège. The division comprised five brigades and various other formations with troops and 

====Army of the Meuse====
The Army of the Meuse (General Otto von Emmich) consisted of the 11th Brigade of III Corps (Major-General Friedrich von Wachter), the 14th Brigade of IV Corps (Major-General Friedrich von Wussow), the 27th Brigade of VII Corps (Colonel Benno von Massow), the 34th Brigade of IX Corps (Major-General Richard von Kraewel), the 38th Brigade of X Corps (Colonel Oertzen) and the 43rd Brigade of XI Corps (Major-General Hülsen). The cavalry component consisted of (II Cavalry Corps [HKK II]), Lieutenant-General Georg von der Marwitz), consisting of the 2nd (Major-General Friedrich von Krane), 4th (Lieutenant-General Otto von Garnier) and the 9th (Major-General Karl-Ulrich von Bülow) cavalry divisions. (A German Cavalry Corps was not an army corps in the conventional sense but the largest German cavalry unit that operated in 1914 and was known as a .) The Army of the Meuse had with and howitzers, accompanied by Erich Ludendorff as an observer for the General Staff.

==Prelude==

===German preparations===
In August 1914, the Germans realised that the garrison at Liège would be larger than anticipated and that prompt mobilisation had given the Belgians time to make progress on the defences between the forts. Six reinforced brigades and II Cavalry Corps under the X Corps commander were to be ready on 4 August, the third day of mobilisation, at Aachen, Eupen, and Malmedy to conduct the . The 2nd Army Quartermaster General, Major-General Erich Ludendorff, was assigned to the X Corps staff as he was familiar with the plan, having been the Chief of the Deployment Department of the General Staff. On the night of the force was to make a surprise attack, penetrate the fortress ring, capture the town and the road and rail facilities. The invasion began on 4 August; aeroplanes, cavalry and cyclists went ahead of the infantry, with leaflets requesting calm from Belgian civilians. On the right flank, II Cavalry Corps with the cavalry and the 34th Infantry Brigade, advanced to take the crossings over the Meuse at Visé, to reconnoitre towards Brussels and Antwerp and prevent the Belgian army from interfering with the attack on Liège.
The advance into Belgium took place in suffocating hot weather; roadblocks slowed German progress; cavalry found that the bridge at Visé had been blown and were engaged by small-arms fire from the west bank. Jäger pushed the Belgians out of the village but the bridging train of the 34th Brigade was delayed and fire from the Liège forts made the area untenable. The 27th, 14th and 11th brigades reached their objectives from Mortroux to Julémont, Herve and Soiron. The 9th Cavalry Division, followed by the 2nd and 4th Cavalry divisions, advanced south of the Vesdre river though many obstructions, gained footholds over the Ourthe and captured the bridge at Poulseur. The 38th Brigade reached Louveigne and Theux and the 43rd Brigade reached Stoumont and La Gleize. During a night made difficult by sniping from &quot;civilians&quot; and bombardment by the forts, the brigades prepared to close up to the jumping-off points for the attack next day. The cavalry of &quot;Division Garnier&quot; was unable to cross the river at Lixhe until due to artillery fire from Liège and the 34th Brigade managed to cross by only by leaving behind the artillery and supplies.

The 27th Brigade reached its jumping-off positions from Argeteau to St. Remy and La Vaux and had mortars commence firing at the forts in the afternoon; an attack on Fort Barchon was repulsed. The 14th and 11th brigades reached their objectives with some fighting at Forêt and in the south, the 9th Cavalry Division rested its horses and held the crossings of the Ourthe and Amblève rivers. Guarding the attacking corps from cavalry reported to be between Huy and Durbuy, rather than push on to take the Meuse crossings between Liège and Huy; the southern brigades closed up to the Ourthe at Esneux, Poulseur and Fraiture. By the evening of 5 August, the &quot;coup de main&quot; was ready but it was obvious that no surprise could be obtained, given the resistance of the Belgian army &quot;and civilians&quot; in densely populated country, where movement had been slowed by hedges and fences. An envoy was sent to the fortress commander in Liège, who replied with (&quot;You must fight your way through&quot;). Emmich considered that delay would benefit the defenders and continued with the plan for a swift attack.

===Belgian defensive preparations===

On 30 July, the Chief of the Belgian General Staff proposed a plan to counter a violation of Belgian territory by the German army, by assembling the field army astride the Gete River between Hannut, Sint-Truiden, Tienen, Hamme and Mille. The King rejected this, as it was directed only at a German invasion and ordered a deployment further west from Perwez, Tienen, Leuven and Wavre. On 1 August, the Belgians decided to place a division each in Liège and Namur and on 3 August, the two fortresses were left to resist an invasion as best they could, while the rest of the field army protected Antwerp and waited for intervention by France and Britain, the other guarantors of Belgian neutrality. At Liège, Léman had the 3rd Division and the 15th Brigade of the 4th Division, which had arrived from Huy on the night of and increased the garrison to Léman deployed the infantry against attacks from the east and south.

===Plan of attack===
The terrain and fortresses at Liège favoured an attack by &quot;coup de main&quot; because the gaps between the forts had not been maintained and some areas were cut by deep ravines, immune to bombardment by the fortress artillery. The General Staff assumed a Belgian garrison of in peacetime with of the . The plan required the 34th Brigade to attack between Forts Loncin and Pontisse, the 27th Brigade to break through between the Meuse and Fort Evegnée on the east bank, the 14th Brigade to penetrate between Forts Evegnée and Fléron and the 11th Brigade between Fléron and Chaudfontaine as the 38th and 43rd brigades attacked between the Ourthe and Meuse; the II Cavalry Corps was to envelop the fortress and assemble to the north-west. The terrain made an advance across country impractical, so the attackers were to form marching columns behind vanguards, with slung rifles only to be used on officers&#x27; orders; white armbands and a password were to be used for recognition. The outer fortress defences were to be bypassed in the dark, so that Liège could be attacked during the day.

==Battle==

===German attack, 5/6 August===

In the north, the 34th Brigade (Major-General von Kraewel) had eight battalions, less their artillery, as the rest of the brigade was on the far side of the Meuse being ferried over. The attack began on 6 August at from the village of Hermée and was bombarded with shrapnel shell by the Belgian artillery, which disorganised the infantry. A German battalion turned against Pontisse and the rest fought their way into Herstal, where a house-to-house fight against Belgian troops &quot;and civilians&quot; began and then took Préalle under flanking fire from forts Liers and Pontisse. Troops under Major von der Oelsnitz got into Liège and nearly captured General Léman, the Military Governor before being killed or captured. By dawn the brigade was on high ground north-west of Herstal, with its units mixed up and having suffered many casualties. Belgian troops counter-attacked from Liège and the troops were bombarded by Liers and Pontisse until when Kraewel ordered a retreat, which had to run the gauntlet between the forts and suffered many more casualties. The retreat continued all the way back to the Meuse at Lixhe, with 
The advance of the 27th Brigade (Colonel von Massow) was hemmed in by houses, hedges and fences which made flanking moves extremely difficult. The force was bombarded by the guns of forts Wandre and Barcheron at a defensive position beyond Argenteau, where disorganisation and confusion led to the Germans firing on each other as well as the Belgians. By dawn the brigade had reached Fort Wandre but the arrival of Belgian reinforcements led Massow to order a withdrawal to Argenteau. On the left, a second column was held up at Blegny, east of Fort Barcheron and retired to Battice, when the fate of the other columns became known. To the south-east, the 11th Brigade (Major-General von Wachter) attacked through St. Hadelin and Magnée, where it was also strung out in a narrow column by buildings along the road. Small-arms fire forced the Germans between the houses and delayed the advance, which did not reach Romsée until where the Belgian 14th Regiment had been able to prepare defences. The Belgians were defeated but only after artillery had been brought forward; the advance towards Beyne-Heusay bogged down. Uncertainty about the flanks led Wachter to order a retirement to ravines east of Magnée, to gain cover against the bombardment from forts Pieron and Chaudfontaine.
South of the Vesdre, the 38th Brigade (Major-General von Hülsen) advance had begun on 5 August at with the 43rd Brigade in reserve. The attackers were severely bombarded while still on the start-line and a thunderstorm, roadblocks and difficult forest paths made the advance harder. At Esneux and Poulseur, German supplies were looted &quot;by Belgian civilians&quot; and had to be rescued. An engagement began in woods east of Fort Boncelles; Hülsen was wounded and Belgian small-arms fire at the rear of the column, threw it into confusion. The Belgian defences were captured by the morning of 6 August but the brigades had become mingled; Boncelles village was captured but fire from the fort forced the Germans into woods to the north-west. Attacks were made later against high ground south and south-west of Ougrée. Skirmishing went on all day, with many casualties around Fort Boncelles; as ammunition ran short, the 43rd Brigade retreated to Fontin and the 38th Brigade withdrew to Lince. The attacks from the north and south had failed and a raid by Zeppelin Cologne, at had little effect. The airship had been fired on by the Belgian artillery and was wrecked near Bonn, while making a forced landing due to loss of gas.

In the centre, the 14th Brigade (Major-General von Wussow) advanced at led by Emmich and Ludendorff and made a rapid advance to Retinne, where Belgian troops covered the road with machine-guns and forced the Germans under cover with many casualties. Wussow and a regimental commander were wounded; Ludendorff took over and rallied the survivors, the Belgians were outflanked and taken. At Queue-du-Bois, the advance was stopped during house-to-house fighting, until two howitzers were brought up and the village was captured around dawn. By noon, the brigade had reached high ground near a Carthusian convent and saw a white flag flying on the Citadel over the river. An officer was sent forward to investigate and found that the flag was unauthorised and was repudiated by Léman. Attempts were made to contact flanking units but communications to the rear had been cut and no ammunition had been delivered, which left the force of isolated during the night.

During the morning of 7 August, Emmich made &quot;a desperate and bold decision&quot; that the bridges in Liège were undefended and ordered the town to be occupied. Infantry Regiment 165 ( von Oven) crossed the river over the bridge and reached the north-western gate without resistance, taking several parties of Belgian infantry prisoner. Ludendorff, motoring ahead of Infantry Regiment 27 under the impression that the Citadel had been captured, found that he was alone with the garrison and bluffed them into surrender. The town and the Meuse bridges had been captured with most of the railway lines intact. Emmich sent officers to make contact with the other brigades and the 11th Brigade began an advance into Liège at noon, through artillery fire from Fort Chaudfontaine, was in the town by evening and formed a defensive line along the west side. The 27th, 24th and the rest of the 11th Brigade entered the town and operations began to capture the forts.

===Belgian defence, 5–7 August===

On the morning of 5 August, Captain Brinckman, the German Military Attaché at Brussels, met the Governor of Liège under a flag of truce and demanded the surrender of the fortress. Léman refused (&quot;&quot; [Fight your way through]) and an hour later, German troops attacked the east bank forts of Chaudfontaine, Fléron, Évegnée, Barchon and Pontisse; an attack on the Meuse, below the junction with the Vesdre, failed. A party of German troops managed to get between Fort de Barchon and the river Meuse, then was forced to retreat by the Belgian 11th Brigade. From the late afternoon into the night, the German infantry attacked in five columns, two from the north, one from the east and two from the south. The attacks were supported by heavy artillery but the German infantry were repulsed with great loss.

The attack at the Ourthe forced back the defenders between the forts, before counter-attacks by the 12th, 9th and 15th Brigades checked the German advance. Just before dawn, a small German raiding party tried to abduct the Governor from the Belgian headquarters in Rue Ste Foi. Alarmed by gunfire in the street, Léman and his staff rushed outside and joined the guard platoon fighting the raiding party, which was driven off with twenty dead and wounded left behind. German cavalry moved south from Visé to encircle the town; German cavalry patrols had been operating up to west of Liege, leading Léman to believe that the German II Cavalry Corps was encircling the fortified area from the north, though in fact the main body of that force was still to the east and did not cross the Meuse until 8 August, when the reservists had arrived. Believing he would be trapped, Léman decided that the 3rd Infantry Division and 15th Infantry Brigade should withdraw westwards to the Gete, to join the Belgian field army.
On 6 August, the Germans carried out the first air attack on a European city, when a Zeppelin airship bombed Liège and killed nine civilians. Léman believed that units from five German corps confronted the defenders and assembled the 3rd Division between forts Loncin and Hollogne to begin the withdrawal to the Gete during the afternoon and night of The fortress troops were concentrated in the forts, rather than the perimeter and at noon, Léman set up a new headquarters in Fort Loncin, on the western side of the city. German artillery bombarded the forts and Fort Fléron was put out of action when its cupola-hoisting mechanism was destroyed by the bombardment. On the night of German infantry were able to advance between the forts and during the early morning of 7 August, Ludendorff took command of the attack, ordered up a field howitzer and fought through Queue-du-Bois to the high ground overlooking Liège and captured the Citadel of Liège. Ludendorff sent a party forward to Léman under a flag of truce to demand surrender but Léman refused.

==Siege==

===8–16 August===

Bülow gave command of the siege operations at Liège to the VII Corps commander (General Karl von Einem) with the IX and X Corps under his command. The three corps had been ordered to advance over the Belgian border on 8 August. At Liège, on 7 August, Emmich sent liaison officers to make contact with the brigades scattered around the town. The 11th Brigade advanced into the town and joined the troops there on the western fringe. The 27th Brigade arrived by 8 August, along with the rest of the 11th and 14th brigades. Fort Barcheron fell after a bombardment by mortars and the 34th Brigade took over the defence of the bridge over the Meuse at Lixhe. On the southern front, the 38th and 43rd Brigades retreated towards Theux after a false report that Belgian troops were attacking from Liège and Namur. On the night of Einem ordered that Liège be isolated on the eastern and south-eastern fronts by the IX, VII and X corps as they arrived and allotted the capture of Forts Liers, Pontisse, Evegnée and Fléron to IX Corps and Chaudfontaine and Embourg to VII Corps as X Corps guarded the southern flank.
Before the orders arrived, Fort Evegnée was captured after a bombardment. IX Corps isolated Fort Pontisse on 12 August and began a bombardment of Forts Pontisse and Fléron during the afternoon, with coastal mortars and Big Bertha siege howitzers. The VII Corps heavy artillery began to fire on Fort Chaudfontaine, Fort Pontisse was surrendered and IX Corps crossed the Meuse to attack Fort Liers. Fort Liers fell in the morning of 14 August and the garrison of Fort Fléron surrendered in the afternoon, after a bombardment. The X Corps and the 17th Division were moved to the north and VII Corps to the south of the Liège–Brussels railway and on 15 August, a bombardment began on the forts to the west of the town. Fort Boncelles fell in the morning and Fort Lantin in the afternoon and Fort Loncin was obliterated in a magazine explosion; Léman was captured. Forts Hollogne and Flémalle were surrendered on the morning of 16 August after a short bombardment.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
By the morning of 17 August, the German 1st Army, 2nd Army and 3rd Army were free to resume their advance to the French frontier. The Belgian field army withdrew from the Gete towards Antwerp from 18 to 20 August and Brussels was captured unopposed on 20 August. The siege of Liège had lasted for eleven days, rather than the two days anticipated by the Germans. For Belgian resistance in the east of the country had delayed German operations, which gave an advantage to the Franco-British forces in northern France and in Belgium. In (1921) Wolfgang Förster wrote that the German timetable of deployment had required its armies to reach a line from Thionville to Sedan and Mons by the 22nd day of mobilisation (23 August), which was achieved ahead of schedule. In &quot;Bulletin Belge des Sciences Militaires&quot; (September 1921), a four-day delay was claimed. John Buchan wrote


In the first volume of (1925), the German official historians wrote that the Battle of Liège had ended just in time for the German armies to begin their march up the Meuse valley. The Aix-la-Chapelle–Liège railway line was operational by 15 August, although repairs had been necessary at the Nasproue tunnel and the line at Verviers, where had been crashed together. The efforts of the 14th Brigade, Emmich and Ludendorff were commended and the value of the super-heavy artillery was noted. In 1926 James Edmonds, the British official historian, recorded that General Alexander von Kluck had considered that a delay of 4 to 5 days had been caused by the resistance of the Liège garrisons. The most advanced corps of the 1st Army reached a line from Kermt to Stevoort and Gorsem, west of Aachen (Aix La Chapelle), from 7 to 17 August and the resistance of the Liège garrisons may have stopped the Germans from reaching the area by 10 August. General Karl von Bülow, commander of the 2nd Army, wrote that Liège had been besieged by six composite brigades and a cavalry corps and on 10 August, OHL had hoped to begin the advance to the French border three days later but that the siege delayed the march until 17 August.
In 1934, the British historian Charles Cruttwell, wrote of &quot;brave Belgian resistance&quot; at Liège, which surprised the Germans but did not interfere with their plans and that demolitions of railway tunnels and bridges were a more serious cause of delay. Sewell Tyng wrote in 1935 that the southward advance of the German armies had begun on 14 August, after all of the forts on the right bank had fallen. The eleven-day siege had been a &quot;bitter disappointment&quot; to the German commanders; there had been failures of co-ordination, which had led to several incidents of German infantry firing on each other. Liaison between the infantry and their commanders was inadequate; attacking before the super-heavy artillery was ready had caused a disproportionate number of casualties. Tyng wrote that the delay imposed on the Germans was about although various authorities had claimed anything from no delay to five days. In 2001, Hew Strachan wrote that the German advance had been delayed by because the concentration of German active corps had taken until 13 August. Liège was awarded the French in 1914. The effect of German and Austrian super-heavy artillery on French and Belgian fortresses in 1914 led to a loss of confidence in fortifications; much of the artillery of fortress complexes in France and Russia was removed to reinforce field armies. At the Battle of Verdun in 1916, the resilience of French forts proved to have been underestimated.

===Casualties===
In 2009 Herwig wrote that the Belgian army had at Liège and that by 8 August the German attackers had suffered Other sources give Belgian killed or wounded and 

===Subsequent operations===
On 5 August the 4th Division at Namur, received notice from Belgian cavalry that they were in contact with German cavalry to the north of the fortress. More German troops appeared to the south-west on 7 August. OHL had, on the same day, ordered the 2nd Army units assembled near the Belgian border, to advance and send mixed brigades from the IX, VII and X corps to Liège immediately. Large numbers of German troops did not arrive in the vicinity of Namur until too late to forestall the arrival of the 8th Brigade, which having been isolated at Huy, had blown the bridge over the Meuse on 19 August and retired to Namur. During the day the Guards Reserve Corps of the German 2nd Army arrived to the north of the fortress zone and the XI Corps of the 3rd Army, with the 22nd Division and the 38th Division, arrived to the south-east.

A siege train, including one and four Austrian howitzers accompanied the German troops and on 20 August, Belgian outposts were driven in. Next day, the German super-heavy guns began to bombard the eastern and south-eastern forts. The Belgian defenders had no means of keeping the German siege guns out of range or engaging them with counter-battery fire. By evening two forts had been seriously damaged and after another the forts were mostly destroyed. Two Belgian counter-attacks on 22 August were defeated and by the end of 23 August, the northern and eastern fronts were defenceless, with five of the nine forts in ruins. The Namur garrison withdrew at midnight to the south-west and eventually managed to rejoin the Belgian field army at Antwerp; the last fort was surrendered on 25 August.

<text>Classic Albums Live is a concert series based in Toronto, Ontario, in which musicians perform a classic rock album in its entirety. The series was founded in 2003 by Craig Martin, a musician who had previously produced a series of boutique cabaret shows as well as composed music for television and film.

The musicians go to great lengths to faithfully recreate every sound on the original album. They have performed with orchestras, sitarists, choirs and schools. The shows are treated like recitals with the album being performed in its entirety followed by a &#x27;greatest hits&#x27; set of the featured artist.

In recent years, the series has presented concerts in a variety of cities, including Orlando, Florida, Melbourne, Florida, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Akron, La Mirada, Jacksonville, Gainesville, Lakeland, Coral Springs, New York, New Jersey, Dallas, Houston, Uncasville, Connecticut, Las Vegas, Nevada, and Rochester, New York. On 17 December 2006, Classic Albums Live performed the entire 213-song Beatles song catalogue in one 13-hour concert at the Phoenix Concert Theatre in Toronto.

A different line-up performs each album. There is a group of core musicians who are frequently part of the performances, including Nick Hildyard, Rob Phillips, Lindsay Clark, Leslea Keurvorst, Troy Feener, Clifton David, Dom Polito, David Love, Doug Inglis and Marty Morin. Occasionally, more famous Canadian musicians are brought in as well, including Mia Sheard, Kim Bingham, Nicholas Walsh, and ex-members of Moist. In some venues, they will bring in local musicians to fill needed spots. For example, on 16 June 2006, the group performed the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; album at the Hard Rock Live in Orlando; they brought in the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra to fill in on the orchestral parts.

When performing in Toronto, they usually play at Massey Hall. The producer of Classic Albums Live has created a musical called Gig which will run in 2016.

<text>Yogic marriage is a tradition of Hindu marriage done within Shaivite sadhakas and sadhvis, to enable them to get positive energy from yajnas and homas. Though a sexual relation is not excluded in this form of marriage, it is consummated only in exceptional circumstances. It is the simplest of Hindu marriages, done before Shiva by taking an oath in the name of Shiva and chanting &quot;Omkara Bindu Samyuktam, Nityam Dhyayati Yoginah; Kamadam Mokshadam Chaiva Omkaraya Namo Namaha&quot;.

<doc id="888256" wikidata="Q256992" url="?curid=888256" title="Perdita Felicien">
<text>Perdita Felicien (born August 29, 1980) is a Canadian retired hurdler. Felicien is the 2003 World champion in the 100 metres hurdles and 2004 World indoor champion in the 60 metres hurdles. She also won silver medals at the 2007 World Championships, the 2010 World Indoor Championships, and twice at the Pan American Games. Her best time for the 100 metres hurdles of 12.46 secs from 2004 still stands as the Canadian record.

==Early life==
Born in Oshawa, Ontario, Felicien carries her mother&#x27;s maiden name, whose origins are in the Caribbean island nation of Saint Lucia. Her mother named her &quot;Perdita&quot; after she heard the name on the TV game show, &quot;The Price is Right.&quot;

Felicien moved to Pickering, Ontario, where, as a student, she began competing in track and field events at her school. She was motivated to join the school&#x27;s track and field team after receiving an Award of Excellence in the Canada Fitness Award Program in grade 3. At first, she competed in the 100m dash, inspired by Donovan Bailey and Bruny Surin of Canada, later adding the 200m dash and long jump. Felicien dedicated herself to hurdling at Pine Ridge Secondary School and won the Ontario high-school hurdling championship in 1998. That year she added the first of two consecutive Canadian junior championships. Her performance at a scholastic meet in Ohio brought offers of athletic scholarships from a number of U.S. universities, from which she chose the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she enrolled in the study of kinesiology.

==Career==
Coached by Gary Winckler, in her first year competing at the university level, Felicien earned All-American honors and in the 100m hurdles set the record for the fastest time by a freshman in NCAA history for the event. The following year she was ranked No. 1 in the 100 m hurdles by the NCAA for the entire outdoor season, and was the first Illinois athlete ever to win a national championship during both the indoor and outdoor seasons. Her performance earned her the first of three consecutive University of Illinois Female Athlete of the Year awards, and she was voted the U.S. Track Coaches Association National Female Outdoor Athlete of the Year.

An undefeated Felicien won her second consecutive 100 m hurdles national title in 2003. She became the first University of Illinois female athlete to be named the Big Ten Conference &quot;Athlete of the Year&quot;, and also earned NCAA Female Track &amp; Field Athlete of the Year honors. Felicien blossomed into a major force on the international hurdling scene, topping off her season by winning the women&#x27;s 100 m Hurdles Final at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics in Paris, France. With that win, Felicien became Canada&#x27;s first ever female world gold medallist and the first female in Illinois track &amp; field history to win a gold medal in an individual event at the World Championships. She was named Canada&#x27;s female athlete of the year – the first track athlete to capture that honor in 25 years.

A much-anticipated showdown with hurdling great Gail Devers took place in March 2004. Felicien set a new record in defeating the three-time hurdles world champion in the 60 m hurdle final at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Budapest, Hungary. She chalked up six straight wins leading up to the Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, where she was expected to win gold in the 100 m hurdles on August 24, especially after Devers pulled out with an injury. Unexpectedly, in the event final, Felicien failed to clear the first hurdle and fell into the adjacent lane, knocking down the Russian competitor, Irina Shevchenko, and taking her out of the race and a chance at an Olympic medal, much to the obvious dismay of Shevchenko.

Felicien returned to the track and had some success, winning medals at the world championships alongside her teammate Priscilla Lopes-Schliep. In 2007, she won a silver medal at the world championships in the 100 metre hurdles.

Felicien did not compete in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China due to a foot injury. In August 2008, she was a guest commentator for CBC Television&#x27;s 2008 Olympics coverage of hurdles.

During the summer of 2011, Felicien relocated to the University of Calgary in Alberta to train under the tutelage of former national team head coach, Les Gramantik, and her old coach, Gary Winckler. She also partnered with Jessica Zelinka, ranked the sixth-best heptathlete in the world. In June 2012, Felicien failed to qualify for the Canadian Olympic team for the 2012 London Olympics. She had finished third in the 2012 Canadian Olympic trials for track and field, in the 100m hurdles event, under protest. However, she false started, and was disqualified.

Felicien retired from competition in 2013. She went back to school to study journalism, and was a writer/reporter with &quot;CHCH News&quot; in Hamilton, Ontario. She was part of the broadcasting team for the Toronto 2015 PanAm Games coverage. In 2018, Felicien joined the CBC TV network broadcasting the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang in South Korea and later the Tokyo Olympics (2021).

Since 2020, Felicien has been the host of &quot;All-Round Champion&quot;, a TV series produced by Marblemedia for TV Ontario and BYU TV.

==Charity==
Felicien is a supporter of Count Me In, the largest youth-run organization in Canada. She spoke at the 2013 Count Me In Conference in Toronto.

She is also an active ambassador for Right To Play.

<text>84, Charing Cross Road is a 1970 book by Helene Hanff. It is an memoir composed of letters from the twenty-year correspondence between the author and Frank Doel, chief buyer for Marks &amp; Co antiquarian booksellers, located at the eponymous address in London. It was later adapted into a 1975 television play, a 1976 radio drama, a 1981 stage play, and a 1987 film.

==Background==
Hanff was in search of obscure classics and British literature titles that she had been unable to find in New York City when she noticed an ad in the &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot;. She first contacted the shop in 1949 and it fell to Doel to fulfil her requests. In time, a long-distance friendship developed between the two and between Hanff and other staff members, as well, with an exchange of Christmas packages, birthday gifts and food parcels to help with the post-World War II food shortages in Britain. Their letters included discussions about topics as diverse as the sermons of John Donne, how to make Yorkshire Pudding, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the coronation of Elizabeth II. Hanff postponed visiting her English friends until too late; Doel died in December 1968 from peritonitis from a burst appendix, and the bookshop eventually closed in December 1970. Hanff did finally visit Charing Cross Road and the empty shop in the summer of 1971, a trip recorded in her 1973 book &quot;The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street&quot;.

==The shop&#x27;s site today==
The five-story building where Marks &amp; Co. was located during the events of the book still exists . A circular brass plaque on a pilaster on the street frontage acknowledges the story and marks the site. The premises were occupied by a music and CD shop in the early 1990s, and later other retail outlets. In 2009 they housed a Med Kitchen restaurant; and now form part of a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant. In New York, the apartment house at 305 East 72nd Street, near Second Avenue, Hanff’s home from 1956 and from where she wrote her later letters, has been renamed “Charing Cross House” in her honor.

==Adaptations==

===Television===
Hugh Whitemore adapted &quot;84, Charing Cross Road&quot; for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot;, a television anthology series. It was first broadcast on 4 November 1975, starring Frank Finlay and Anne Jackson.

===Theatre===
In 1981, James Roose-Evans adapted it for the stage and it was first produced at the Salisbury Playhouse with a cast headed by Rosemary Leach as Hanff and David Swift as Doel. It transferred to the West End, where it opened to universally ecstatic reviews. It toured nationally and was performed by Miriam Karlin in 1990 and later by Rula Lenska and Bill Gaunt. It returned to the Salisbury Playhouse in 2015, running 5–28 February with Clive Francis and Janie Dee in the lead roles. It was also performed at the Cambridge Arts Theatre in 2018 by Clive Francis and Stefanie Powers, before embarking on a UK tour.

After fifteen previews, the Broadway production opened to mixed reviews on 7 December 1982 at the Nederlander Theatre with Ellen Burstyn and Joseph Maher. It ran for 96 performances.

===Radio===
Virginia Browns adapted the story for BBC Radio drama, and it was broadcast on Radio 3 on 15 January 1976, with Margaret Robertson as Hanff and Lyndon Brook as Doel. The play was produced by Christopher Venning.

James Roose-Evans again adapted the play for a 1992 BBC radio production starring Frank Finlay, who had played Doel in the 1975 TV production, and Miriam Karlin and a 2007 production starring Gillian Anderson and Denis Lawson, broadcast on Christmas Day on BBC Radio 4.

===Film===

Whitemore returned to the project to write the screenplay for the 1987 film adaptation starring Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins. The &quot;dramatis personae&quot; were expanded to include Hanff&#x27;s Manhattan friends, the bookshop staff, and Doel&#x27;s wife Nora, played by Judi Dench. Bancroft won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Dench was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and Whitemore for BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

The Chinese-Hong Kong film &quot;Book of Love&quot; or &quot;Finding Mr. Right 2&quot; (Chinese: 北京遇上西雅圖之不二情書) (2016) references, and is loosely inspired by, &quot;84, Charing Cross Road&quot;.

<doc id="888262" wikidata="Q7404057" url="?curid=888262" title="Salem Chalabi">
<text>Salem Chalabi (aka &quot;Sam Challabi&quot;) (born 13 August 1963, in Baghdad) is an Iraq-born, British- and American-educated lawyer. He was appointed as the first General Director of the Iraqi Special Tribunal, set up in 2003 to try Saddam Hussein and other members of his regime for crimes against humanity. His appointment, by an order signed by Paul Bremer, the head of the occupation authority, was widely criticized for perceived nepotism (his uncle, Ahmed Chalabi, was critically involved in the US-led war against Iraq and Hussein) and he himself lacked any significant trial experience (he was a corporate securities lawyer). He was ultimately dropped from the Tribunal after an arrest warrant was issued for investigation into his role in the murder of a director-general of the Iraqi Ministry of Finance who was investigating Chalabi family properties acquired in Iraq; the charge was ultimately dismissed citing lack of evidence.

==Biography==

Salem Chalabi was educated in Britain and in the United States. His uncle Ahmed Chalabi was the controversial leader of the Iraqi National Congress and former member of the Iraq Interim Governing Council and a Deputy Prime Minister; he is also &quot;a former banker in Jordan who fled the country in 1989 before he could be arrested in connection with a $200 million financial scandal. He was later tried in his absence and sentenced by a Jordanian court to 22 years in prison on 31 charges of embezzlement, theft, misuse of depositor funds, and currency speculation.&quot; Salem studied at Bedford School in England and at Yale University (where he was on the Rugby Team and a member of the controversial Rockingham Club), graduating in 1985. In 1993 he received a J.D. degree from the Northwestern University School of Law. He worked for Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius in New York and lastly for Clifford Chance in London, in both instances as a corporate lawyer specialising in capital markets. Salem joined the Dubai office of Stephenson Harwood (Middle East) LLP in 2014 as a partner.

Mr. Chalabi was a member, immediately before the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, of the Department of State sponsored Future of Iraq project, to which he was appointed as rapporteur of the Transitional Justice Working Group.

Questions about conflicts of interest swirled around Sam Chalabi. Returning to Iraq in April 2003 he founded the controversial Iraqi International Law Group. Chalabi set up this &quot;marketing partnership&quot; with L. Marc Zell, the former law partner of Douglas J. Feith, the Pentagon&#x27;s undersecretary for policy. Zell was to help lead American and Russian clients interested in reconstruction to Sam Chalabi&#x27;s firm, which would in turn help them to meet U.S. and Iraqi officials&quot;. Zell, born in the United States, moved with his family to the Jewish settlement of Alon Shevut on the West Bank in 1988, at the start of the first Palestinian uprising, acquiring Israeli nationality. His Jerusalem based firm, whose staff produced the content of the Iraqi International Law Group&#x27;s website, cites as one of its main activities assisting Israeli companies to do business abroad.

&quot;In interviews, Sam Chalabi spoke of his daily contacts with his uncle [Ahmed Chalabi], and the fact that one of his 26 first cousins was the Iraqi minister of trade.&quot; Sam Chalabi also played an important role in the new government: as an advisor on the writing of commercial laws and a national constitution, among other issues.

After &quot;an outpouring of publicity&quot;, Sam Chalabi disbanded the partnership, saying, &quot;I have to be more careful about the appearance of a conflict of interest.&quot;&quot;.

== Iraqi special tribunal ==

With the capture of Saddam Hussein on December 13, 2003, an Iraqi Special Tribunal was announced, with Salem placed in charge by an order signed by L. Paul Bremer III, the head of the occupation authority. As such, Salem was responsible for the setting up and the administration of the tribunal, including the nomination of judges and prosecutors; he also arranged for the judges to visit the Slobodan Milošević&#x27; tribunal at the Hague.

However, on August 8, 2004, while Salem was in London, a warrant was issued in Iraq for his arrest, for his alleged involvement in the May 28, 2004, death of Haithem Fadhil, director-general of the Iraqi Ministry of Finance. On the same day, a warrant was issued for the arrest of his uncle, Ahmed Chalabi, on money counterfeiting charges. However, those charges were dropped in late September 2004, with Judge Zuhair al-Maliki citing lack of evidence. The charges against Salem Chalabi were dropped in December 2004, citing lack of evidence.

On September 7, 2004, it was reported that Chalabi had been removed or was about to be removed from his post as head of the tribunal. On September 19, 2004, the New York Times quoted Iraqi interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi as saying that he had received Salem&#x27;s resignation.

Mr. Chalabi was engaged as the head of the Iraq practice of DLA Piper until 2014.

<doc id="888263" wikidata="Q469836" url="?curid=888263" title="Audrey Mestre">
<text>Audrey Mestre (11 August 1974 – 12 October 2002) was a French world record-setting freediver.

== Early life ==

Mestre was born in Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis, to a family of snorkeling and scuba diving enthusiasts. She began swimming when she was a baby. She became a seasoned scuba diver by age thirteen but did not get full certification until her sixteenth birthday due to French law. She was still in her teens when her family moved to Mexico City and, fluent in the Spanish language, she eventually studied marine biology at a university in La Paz, Mexico.

== Relationship with Francisco &quot;Pipín&quot; Ferreras ==

In 1996 her interest in underwater sports led to her meeting free-diver Francisco &quot;Pipín&quot; Ferreras. They developed a relationship and Mestre soon moved to Miami, Florida to live with Ferreras. There, she took up serious free-diving and with Ferreras as her instructor was soon reaching record depths. In 1999 the two diving aficionados married and the following year, off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Audrey Mestre broke the female world record by free diving to a depth of 125 meters (410 ft) on a single breath of air. A year later she broke her own record, by descending to 130 meters (427 ft).

== Death ==
In October 2002, Mestre died in an early attempt to break the 160 meters NLT (No Limit) free-diving AIDA International&#x27;s world record that Tanya Streeter had established a few weeks before on August 17, 2002 (at that time this was both men and women&#x27;s official AIDA record).

On October 4, 2002, with a dive team under her husband&#x27;s supervision, she made a practice dive off Bayahibe Beach in the Dominican Republic to a record depth of 166 meters (545 ft). After more deep dive practices, on October 12 she prepared to attempt a dive to 171 meters. On reaching 171 meters she opened the valve on the air tank to inflate the lift bag which would raise her rapidly to the surface but the cylinder had no air in it. A rescue diver arrived and inflated the lift bag with his air supply but the bag did not rise fast enough due to insufficient inflation, a strong current, and the riser rope being non-vertical. A dive that should have been no more than three minutes resulted in her remaining underwater for more than eight and a half minutes. By the time her husband put on scuba gear and dived down to bring her unconscious body to the surface it was too late and she was pronounced dead at a hospital on shore.

The dive was controversial and heavily criticized as the setup did not match common freediving safety standards. Much of the diving community&#x27;s critique targeted her husband Ferreras, who had hurried an underfunded organization for this record attempt. The attempt had been previously planned for a later date, and had too few safety divers, not enough proper rescue equipment, and no doctors at sea or shore. Ferreras was in charge of Mestre&#x27;s lift bag air tank and did not allow any members of the team to check that the tank had been filled. Mestre was not recovered to the surface until nine minutes into her dive. She had a pulse at the surface, but there were no medical doctors available to treat her and minutes were wasted with Ferreras attempting to resuscitate her in the water. A 2003 article, written by Gary Smith for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, titled &quot;Rapture of the Deep,&quot; chronicled the dramatic rise and ultimate tragedy of Mestre. An ESPN documentary film written and directed by Alison Ellwood in 2013 included video footage of the incident and interviews with crew members and staff.

== Awards and accolades ==
Audrey Mestre was cremated, her ashes scattered at sea. In 2002, she was inducted posthumously into the Women Divers Hall of Fame, and in August 2004 a book that tells her story was written by her husband and published under the title &quot;The Dive: A Story of Love and Obsession&quot; ().

In 2013, Mestre&#x27;s life and career were chronicled in ESPN&#x27;s &quot;No Limits&quot; as part of their &quot;Nine for IX&quot; series.

Later on, Altfater served as the squadron navigating officer of the 1st destroyer division of the Baltic Fleet (1909–1910). During World War I, as Captain 2nd Rank Altfater was one of two liaison officers for the Imperial Russian Navy at the Tsar&#x27;s Supreme Headquarters (the Stavka), where he had responsibility for advising on command appointments in the Baltic Fleet. He was later head of the Military Administration under the Commander-in-chief of the Northern Fleet. In October 1917, Altfater was promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral. 

After the October Revolution, he joined the Soviets. In February 1918, Altfater was appointed assistant to the head of the Naval Headquarters. He participated in peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk as a naval technical adviser to the Soviet delegation. In April, Altfater became a board member at the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Naval Affairs. In October, he became a member of the Revolutionary Military Council (Реввоенсовет, &quot;Revvoyensovet&quot;) and appointed Commander-in-chief of the Soviet Naval Forces. 

Altfater died of a heart attack in Moscow on 20 April 1919. On receiving the news about his death, Leon Trotsky said that &quot;the Red Fleet lost a tireless, competent, energetic and honest worker&quot;. He is buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow.

<text>A cantilever bridge is a bridge built using structures that project horizontally into space, supported on only one end (called cantilevers). For small footbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams; however, large cantilever bridges designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel, or box girders built from prestressed concrete. 

The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice, as it can span distances of over , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework.

== Origins ==

Engineers in the 19th century understood that a bridge that was continuous across multiple supports would distribute the loads among them. This would result in lower stresses in the girder or truss and meant that longer spans could be built. Several 19th-century engineers patented continuous bridges with hinge points mid-span. The use of a hinge in the multi-span system presented the advantages of a statically determinate system and of a bridge that could handle differential settlement of the foundations. Engineers could more easily calculate the forces and stresses with a hinge in the girder.

Heinrich Gerber was one of the engineers to obtain a patent for a hinged girder (1866) and is recognized as the first to build one. The Hassfurt Bridge over the Main river in Germany with a central span of 124 feet (38 metres) was completed in 1867 and is recognized as the first modern cantilever bridge.

The High Bridge of Kentucky by C. Shaler Smith (1877), the Niagara Cantilever Bridge by Charles Conrad Schneider (1883) and the Poughkeepsie Bridge by John Francis O&#x27;Rourke and Pomeroy P. Dickinson (1889) were all important early uses of the cantilever design. The Kentucky River Bridge spanned a gorge that was 275 feet (84 metres) deep and took full advantage of the fact that falsework, or temporary support, is not needed for the main span of a cantilever bridge.

The Forth Bridge is a notable example of an early cantilever bridge. This bridge held the record for longest span in the world for twenty-nine years until it was surpassed by the Quebec Bridge. The engineers responsible for the bridge, Sir Benjamin Baker and Sir John Fowler, demonstrated the structural principles of the suspended span cantilever by sitting in chairs and supporting their colleague, Kaichi Watanabe, in between them, using just their arms and wooden poles. The suspended span, where Watanabe sits, is in the center. The wooden poles resist the compression of the lower chord, while the outstretched arms support the tension of the upper chord. The placement of the brick counterweights demonstrates the action of the outer foundations.
== Function ==

A simple cantilever span is formed by two cantilever arms extending from opposite sides of an obstacle to be crossed, meeting at the center. In a common variant, the suspended span, the cantilever arms do not meet in the center; instead, they support a central truss bridge which rests on the ends of the cantilever arms. The suspended span may be built off-site and lifted into place, or constructed in place using special travelling supports.

A common way to construct steel truss and prestressed concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a balanced cantilever; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing arms are called anchor arms. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, there are four cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms that extend away from the obstacle. Because of the need for more strength at the balanced cantilever&#x27;s supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The Commodore Barry Bridge is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.

Steel truss cantilevers support loads by tension of the upper members and compression of the lower ones. Commonly, the structure distributes the tension via the anchor arms to the outermost supports, while the compression is carried to the foundations beneath the central towers. Many truss cantilever bridges use pinned joints and are therefore statically determinate with no members carrying mixed loads.

Prestressed concrete balanced cantilever bridges are often built using segmental construction.

== Construction methods==
Some steel arch bridges (such as the Navajo Bridge) are built using pure cantilever spans from each side, with neither falsework below nor temporary supporting towers and cables above. These are then joined with a pin, usually after forcing the union point apart, and when jacks are removed and the bridge decking is added the bridge becomes a truss arch bridge. Such unsupported construction is only possible where appropriate rock is available to support the tension in the upper chord of the span during construction, usually limiting this method to the spanning of narrow canyons.

<doc id="888281" wikidata="Q950725" url="?curid=888281" title="Penrhyn atoll">
<text>Penrhyn (also called Tongareva, Māngarongaro, Hararanga, and Te Pitaka) is an atoll in the northern group of the Cook Islands in the south Pacific Ocean. The northernmost island in the group, it is located at north-north-east of the capital island of Rarotonga, 9 degrees south of the equator. Its nearest neighbours are Rakahanga and Manihiki, approximately to the southwest. Once one of the most heavily populated atolls, it was almost completely depopulated by Peruvian slavers in 1864.

==Geography==
Penrhyn is a roughly circular coral atoll with a circumference of approximately , enclosing a lagoon with an area of . The atoll is atop the highest submarine volcano in the Cook Islands, rising from the ocean floor. The atoll is low-lying, with a maximum elevation of less than . The total land area is .

The atoll rim consists of 18 major islets. Clockwise, from the northwest, these are:
* Tokerau
* Painko
* Ruahara
* Takuua
* Veseru
* Tuirai
* Pokerekere Islet
* Kavea
* Temata
* Patanga
* Tepuka
* Ahu a Miria
* Atutahi
* Moturakina
* Atiati
* Mangarongaro
* Moananui Islet
* Matunga
* Tekasi

==History==

Polynesians are believed to have lived on Penrhyn since 900 or 1000 AD. According to oral tradition, the island was fished up by Vatea, using part of his thigh as bait, and has been inhabited since the time of creation. Other legends tell of the island being visited by various ancestors of Tangiia-nui of Rarotonga on their way from Samoa to Tahiti. Other ancestors came from Aitutaki and Rakahanga. The Polynesians named the atoll &quot;Tongareva&quot; (&quot;Tonga floating in space&quot;, &quot;Tonga-in-the-skies&quot; and &quot;Away from the South&quot;).

Europeans first encountered the island in 1788, when the &quot;Lady Penrhyn,&quot; commanded by Captain William Crofton Sever, passed by the island on 8 August while returning from delivering the first convicts to Australia. It was later visited by the Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue in April 1816, and then by the American brig USS &quot;Porpoise&quot;, under command of Lieutenant Commander Cadwalader Ringgold, as part of the United States Exploring Expedition in February 1841. The brig &quot;Chatham&quot; ran aground at Penrhyn during a storm in January 1853, resulting in some of the crew being stranded on the island for almost a year. One of them, the trader Edward Henry Lamont, documented his stay in &quot;Wild Life among the Pacific Islanders&quot;. The London Missionary Society, which had begun missionary activities in the Cook Islands from 1821, sent a group of three Polynesian missionaries to Penrhyn in 1854.

Robert Louis Stevenson visited Penrhyn in May 1890.

===Slavery===
In the early 1860s, Penrhyn was almost completely depopulated by Peruvian blackbirding expeditions. In 1862, the ship &quot;Adelante&quot; took hundreds of Tongarevans aboard, ostensibly to transport them to a nearby island as agricultural workers. The Tongarevans went willingly: coconut blight had led to famine, while the local missionaries saw work overseas as a way of bring money to the atoll to pay for larger churches. Once on board, they were shackled in the hold and guarded day and night. 253 survived the voyage to reach Callao, Peru, where they were sold for between $100 and $200 each. Further slaving expeditions followed, and in total, 472 Tongarevans were sold in Peru.

===Foreign claims===
Penrhyn was officially annexed for Great Britain by Captain Sir William Wiseman of HMS &quot;Caroline&quot; on 22 March 1888. The island was considered to have a strategic location on the route of a proposed Trans-Pacific telegraphic connection between Canada and Australia.

The Cook Islands were a British protectorate 1888 to 1900, when annexed to New Zealand, until independence in 1965 when residents chose self-government in free association with New Zealand.

From 1856 to 1980, the United States claimed sovereignty over the island under the Guano Islands Act. That claim had never been recognised by Britain and the Cook Islands. New Zealand sovereignty was recognised during World War II U.S. military operations involving the islands. On 11 June 1980, in connection with establishing the maritime boundary between the Cook Islands and American Samoa, the United States signed Cook Islands–United States Maritime Boundary Treaty acknowledging that Penrhyn was under Cook Islands sovereignty.

===World War II===
In early 1942, Japanese advances had placed the South Pacific air ferry route&#x27;s initial path at some risk so that an alternate route was directed. In March, Leif J. Sverdrup was determined for a tour of suitable islands for local labour that could help build an airfield. U.S. Navy Seabees began work on a runway in July 1942, with aviation gasoline storage tanks added to the completed field. Two additional runways were added later. During the war, U.S. Navy PBY &quot;Catalina&quot; and USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers were stationed on the island, along with about a thousand support personnel. A communications link through the island was established by the U.S. Army Signal Corps. American forces were withdrawn in September 1946.

The U.S. Army vessel &quot;Southern Seas&quot; struck an uncharted reef on 22 July 1942 and was severely damaged with flooded engine rooms and abandoned in Taruia Pass while on an island charting assignment in support of the construction. The ship was later salvaged by the Navy and commissioned for naval use.

===Cyclone Pat===
In February 2010, much of Omoka was damaged by Cyclone Pat, but there were no serious casualties. The village school was demolished, and the community was left without teaching facilities. Tongareva&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Craft Guild loaned their meeting house; however, this meant that five classes ranging from 3 to 16 years old had to be taught in a single room. New Zealand Aid paid completely for a new school to be constructed, called Meitaki Poria.

==Demographics==

Penrhyn was formerly one of the most densely inhabited atolls in Polynesia, with an estimated pre-European population of 2,000. Depopulation by slavers reduced this to just 88 people, and its population on annexation by New Zealand was just 420.

===Villages===
All of the habitable islets were previously occupied, with Moananui home to two rival settlements. Following the arrival of the missionaries, the population concentrated around the churches in four villages. Two of these villages were subsequently abandoned due to depopulation by slavers.

Today, Penrhyn Atoll has two villages. The main village of Omoka, the seat of Penrhyn Island Council, is on Moananui Islet, on the western rim of the atoll, north of the airport. The village of Te Tautua is on Pokerekere Islet (also known as Pokerere or Tautua), on the eastern rim.

The inhabitants of the island are Christians, with 92% of the population belonging to the Cook Islands Christian Church, while the remaining 8% adhere to the Roman Catholic Church.

==Economy and resources==

The World War II airstrip is still used today as Tongareva Airport, with its initial 3,000-meter runway reduced to 1,700 meters. Weekly flights to the atoll by Air Rarotonga are subject to frequent cancellations due to a lack of passengers or lack of fuel on Penrhyn for the return flight.

A large passage in the lagoon allows inter-island ships to enter the lagoon, and the island has become popular as a stopover for yachts crossing the Pacific from Panama to New Zealand. The inter-island Taio Shipping company visits the island approximately every three months.

The locally produced Rito hats are woven from fibre from young coconut leaves, which are stripped, boiled and dried, resulting in a fine white leaf. Called rito weaving, the traditional items woven are Sunday church fans, small baskets and hats, the hats originally being copies of the ones the sailors wore. Weaving is an economic activity in both villages; both traditional and artificial dyes may be used.

===Black pearl farming===
Black pearl farming, together with mother of pearl, was previously the only significant economic activity on the island. Pearl farming began in 1997–1998. In 2000, algal blooms spread around the lagoon, and a virus killed the pearl oysters. The stocks never recovered, and the final harvest was in 2003, resulting in significant losses of equipment, outlay and resources.

===Food===
The present population of the island relies on the ocean for most of their food as well as locally grown plants such as coconut, pawpaw, breadfruit and &quot;puraka&quot; (yam). Every morning (except on Sundays), men from the island head out in small tin boats to spear or trawl for fish for their families. The islanders&#x27; diet is supplemented with imported rice and flour shipped in from Rarotonga or Hawai&#x27;i. The boats are infrequent (usually every 3 months).

===Energy===
Electricity has been supplied by a generator in each village (Omoka 65 KVA, Te Tautua 35 KVA); these have been installed by Australian Aid. Provision of diesel fuel required two long sea voyages: Auckland to Rarotonga, then onwards to the northern Cooks Islands (ships travelled 7,000 km each way). To save fuel, electricity was always turned off overnight (11 pm to 6 am). The New Zealand Government (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade) decided to assist the Cook Islands Government by funding solar power arrays in all the northern atolls. The Aid programme &quot;Uira Natura ko Tokerau&quot; was for NZ$20 million. The build was by PowerSmart Solar of New Zealand. Construction began on 23 February 2015, each village was solar powered by the end of May 2015. Some work is possibly still ongoing for all northern atolls to be on renewable energy.

The Omoka solar farm and Te Tautua solar farm now provide 126 kW and 42 kW, respectively.

<doc id="888284" wikidata="Q187698" url="?curid=888284" title="Takeo Kurita">
<text>was a vice admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during World War II. Kurita commanded IJN 2nd Fleet, the main Japanese attack force during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the largest naval battle in history.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Takeo Kurita was born in Mito city, Ibaraki Prefecture, in 1889. He was sent off to Etajima in 1905 and graduated from the 38th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1910, ranked 28th out of a class of 149 cadets. As a midshipman, he served on the cruisers and . On being commissioned as ensign in 1911, he was assigned to .

After his promotion to sub-lieutenant in 1913, Kurita served on the battleship , destroyer and cruiser . Kurita became a lieutenant on 1 December 1916, and served on a number of ships: protected cruiser , destroyers and . He also served as either the chief torpedo officer or executive officer on &quot;Minekaze&quot;, , and . In 1920, he was given his first command: the destroyer &quot;Shigure&quot;. In 1921, he assumed command of .

Promoted to lieutenant commander in 1922, Kurita captained the destroyers , , and . As commander from 1927, he commanded the destroyer , 25th Destroyer Group and 10th Destroyer Group.

As captain from 1932, he commanded the 12th Destroyer Group, the cruiser , and from 1937 the battleship .

Kurita became a rear admiral on November 15, 1938, commanding the 1st Destroyer Flotilla then the 4th Destroyer Flotilla. He was in command of the 7th Cruiser Division at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

===World War II===
====Early campaigns====
Kurita&#x27;s 7th Cruiser Division participated in the invasion of Java in the Dutch East Indies in December 1941, and in the Indian Ocean Raid where he led a fleet of six heavy cruisers and the light carrier that sank 135,000 tons of shipping in the Bay of Bengal. During the Battle of Midway (serving under Nobutake Kondō), he lost the cruiser . Kurita was promoted to vice admiral on 1 May 1942, and was reassigned to the 3rd Battleship Division in July.

In the Guadalcanal Campaign, Kurita led his battleships in an intense bombardment of Henderson Field on the night of 13 October, firing 918 heavy high explosive shells at the American airfield. This was the single most successful Japanese attempt to incapacitate Henderson Field by naval bombardment and allowed a large transport convoy to resupply forces on Guadalcanal the next day relatively unmolested. Kurita later commanded major naval forces during the Central Solomon Islands campaign and during the Battle of the Philippine Sea. In 1943, Kurita replaced Admiral Kondō as the commander of IJN 2nd Fleet.

====Battle of Leyte Gulf====
It was as Commander-in-Chief of the IJN 2nd Fleet dubbed &quot;Center Force&quot; during the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea and the Battle off Samar (both part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf) for which Kurita is best known. The IJN 2nd Fleet included the largest and most heavily armed battleships in the world, and . Additionally, the IJN 2nd Fleet included the older battleships , , and , 10 cruisers and 13 destroyers. Critically, however, the IJN Second Fleet did not include any aircraft carriers.

Kurita was a dedicated officer, willing to die if necessary, but not wishing to die in vain. Like Isoroku Yamamoto, Kurita believed that for a captain to &quot;go down with his ship&quot; was a wasteful loss of valuable naval experience and leadership. When ordered by Admiral Soemu Toyoda to take his fleet through the San Bernardino Strait in the central Philippines and attack the American landings at Leyte, Kurita thought the effort a waste of ships and lives, especially since he could not get his fleet to Leyte Gulf until five days after the landings, leaving little more than empty transports for his huge battleships to attack. He bitterly resented his superiors, who, while safe in bunkers in Tokyo, ordered him to fight to the death against hopeless odds and without air cover. For his part, Toyoda was aware that the plan was a major gamble, but as the Imperial Japanese Navy fleet was running out of fuel and other critical supplies, he felt that the potential gain offset the risk of losing a fleet that was about to become useless in any event.

=====Ambush in the Palawan Passage=====
While his fleet was en route from Brunei to attack the American invasion fleet, Kurita&#x27;s ships were attacked in the Palawan Passage by U.S. submarines. damaged the heavy cruiser and sank Kurita&#x27;s flagship, the heavy cruiser , forcing him to swim for his life while sank the heavy cruiser . Kurita was plucked from the water by a destroyer and transferred his flag to the &quot;Yamato&quot;, but Kurita&#x27;s dunking did him little good, especially since he had only recently recovered from a severe case of dengue fever, and no doubt contributed to the fatigue which may have influenced his subsequent actions.

=====Battle of the Sibuyan Sea=====
While in the confines of the Sibuyan Sea and approaching the San Bernardino Strait, Kurita&#x27;s force underwent five aerial attacks by U.S. carrier planes which damaged several of his ships, including &quot;Yamato&quot;. Constant air attacks from Admiral William &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey&#x27;s 3rd Fleet scored two bomb hits on &quot;Yamato&quot;, reducing her speed, and numerous torpedo and bomb hits on &quot;Musashi&quot;, mortally wounding her. They also scored a number of damaging near misses on other vessels, reducing fleet speed to 18 knots. Knowing that he was already six hours behind schedule and facing the possibility of a sixth attack in the narrow confines of the San Bernardino Strait, Kurita requested air support and turned his fleet west away from Leyte Gulf.

Thus began a chain of events that continues to engage historians and biographers to this day. Halsey, believing that he had mauled Kurita&#x27;s fleet and that the Japanese Center Force was retreating, and believing that he had the orders and authorization to do so, abandoned his station guarding General MacArthur&#x27;s landing at Leyte Gulf and the San Bernardino Strait, in order to pursue Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa&#x27;s Northern Fleet of Japanese carriers that were sent as a decoy to lure the Americans away from Leyte. But before doing so, in fact before Ozawa&#x27;s force had been sighted, Halsey had sent a message announcing a &quot;battle plan&quot; to detach his battleships to cover the exit of the strait. With the decision to attack Ozawa, this battle plan was never executed and the heavy ships went north with the carriers. The battle plan called for detaching the battleships to guard San Bernardino Strait, which meant that Halsey&#x27;s flagship, the battleship , would have been detached too, leaving him behind while Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher chased the carriers. Unfortunately for Halsey, after an hour and a half without further air attacks Kurita turned east again at 1715 towards San Bernardino Strait and the eventual encounter with Kinkaid&#x27;s forces in Leyte Gulf.

=====Battle off Samar=====
Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, Commander 7th Fleet and responsible for protecting the landing forces, assumed that Halsey&#x27;s &quot;battle plan&quot; was a deployment order and that Task Force 34 (TF 34) was actually guarding San Bernardino Strait. Kinkaid thus concentrated his battleships to the south in order to face the Japanese &quot;Southern Force&quot;. During the night of 24–25 October 1944, Kurita changed his mind again, and turned his ships around and headed east again, toward Leyte Gulf. On the morning of 25 October, Kurita&#x27;s fleet, led by &quot;Yamato&quot;, exited San Bernardino Strait and sailed south along the coast of Samar. Thirty minutes after dawn, the battleships of the Imperial Japanese Navy sighted &quot;Taffy 3&quot; — a task unit of Kinkaid&#x27;s covering forces that consisted of six escort carriers, three destroyers and four destroyer escorts, commanded by Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague. Taffy 3 was intended to provide shore support and anti-submarine patrols, not to engage in fleet action against battleships.

Believing he had chanced upon the carriers of the American 3rd Fleet, Kurita immediately ordered his battleships to open fire. Recognizing that his best chance depended upon destroying the aircraft carriers before they could launch their aircraft, Kurita gave the order for &quot;general attack&quot; rather than take the time to reform his ships for action with the enemy. Kurita then compounded his error by ordering his destroyers to the rear to prevent them from obstructing his battleships&#x27; line of fire, preventing them from racing ahead to cut off the slower American carriers. Concern that his destroyers would burn too much fuel in a flank speed stern chase of what Kurita presumed were 30-knot fleet carriers also played a part in Kurita&#x27;s decision. However, at the moment Taffy 3 was sighted, Center Force was in the midst of changing from nighttime scouting to daytime air defense steaming formation. Kurita&#x27;s ships thus charged uncoordinated into action and Kurita quickly lost tactical control of the battle, a situation not helped by poor visibility, intermittent rain squalls and a wind direction favorable to the Americans, who immediately began to make smoke for additional concealment.

Kurita&#x27;s forces mauled Taffy 3, sinking the escort carrier , the destroyers and , and the destroyer escort , and inflicting significant damage on most of the other ships. But continual air attacks by aircraft from Taffy 3 and Taffy 2 stationed farther south and a determined counterattack by the U.S. escorts served to further confuse and separate Kurita&#x27;s forces. Kurita, whose flagship fell far behind early in the battle while avoiding a torpedo salvo from USS &quot;Hoel&quot;, lost sight of the enemy and many of his own ships. Meanwhile, the courageous efforts of the Taffies had cost him three heavy cruisers: , , and . Many of his other ships had also been hit and most had suffered casualties from the relentless strafing. After about two and a half hours in action with Taffy 3, Kurita ordered his force to regroup on a northerly course, away from Leyte.

By this time, Kurita had received news that the Japanese Southern Force, which was to attack Leyte Gulf from the south, had already been destroyed by Kinkaid&#x27;s battleships. With &quot;Musashi&quot; gone, Kurita still had four battleships but only three cruisers remaining, all of his ships were low on fuel and most of them were damaged. Kurita was intercepting messages that indicated Admiral Halsey had sunk all four carriers of the &quot;Northern Force&quot; and was racing back to Leyte with his battleships to confront the Japanese fleet, and that powerful elements of 7th Fleet were approaching from Leyte Gulf. After steaming back and forth off Samar for two more hours, Kurita, who had been on &quot;Yamato&quot;″s bridge for nearly 48 hours by this point, and his chief of staff Tomiji Koyanagi decided to retire and retreated back through the San Bernardino Strait.

Kurita&#x27;s ships were subjected to further air attack the rest of the day and Halsey&#x27;s battleships just missed catching him that night, sinking the destroyer , which had remained behind to save the survivors from &quot;Chikuma&quot;. Kurita&#x27;s retreat saved &quot;Yamato&quot; and the remainder of the IJN 2nd Fleet from certain destruction, but he had failed to complete his mission, attacking the amphibious forces in Leyte Gulf. The path had been laid open to him by the sacrifices of the Northern and Southern Forces, but closed again by the determination and courage of the Taffies.

===After Leyte and postwar===

Kurita was criticized by some elements in the Japanese military for not fighting to the death. In December, Kurita was removed from command. In order to protect him against assassination, he was reassigned as commandant of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy.

Following the Japanese surrender, Kurita found work as a scrivener and masseur, living quietly with his daughter and her family. He was found by an American naval officer after the war where he was interviewed for the Analysis Division of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey. 
With Kurita&#x27;s address in hand, a young American naval officer got out of a jeep and spotted the unimposing figure tending to his garden chores. Years later, he still vividly recalled the moment: &quot;It really made an impression of me. The war was just over. Less than a year before Kurita had been in command of the largest fleet that was ever put together, and there he was out there chopping potatoes.&quot;
Kurita never discussed politics or the war with his family or others, except to conduct a brief interview with a journalist, Masanori Itō, in 1954 when he stated that he had made a mistake at Leyte by turning away and not continuing with the battle, a statement he later retracted. In retirement, Kurita made twice-yearly pilgrimages to Yasukuni Shrine to pray for his dead comrades-in-arms. In 1966, he was present at the deathbed of his old colleague, Jisaburō Ozawa, at which he silently wept.

It was not until he was in his 80s that Kurita began to again speak of his actions at Leyte. He claimed privately to a former Naval Academy student (and biographer), Jiro Ooka, that he withdrew the fleet from the battle because he did not believe in wasting the lives of his men in a futile effort, having long since believed that the war was lost.

Kurita died in 1977 at age 88, and his grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Fuchu, Tokyo.

<text>Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson (born Luther Robinson; May 25, 1878 – November 25, 1949), was an American tap dancer, actor, and singer, the best known and the most highly paid black entertainer in the United States during the first half of the 20th century. His long career mirrored changes in American entertainment tastes and technology. His career began in the age of minstrel shows and moved to vaudeville, Broadway theatre, the recording industry, Hollywood films, radio, and television.

According to dance critic Marshall Stearns, &quot;Robinson&#x27;s contribution to tap dance is exact and specific. He brought it on its toes, dancing upright and swinging,&quot; adding a &quot;hitherto-unknown lightness and presence.&quot; His signature routine was the stair dance, in which he would tap up and down a set of stairs in a rhythmically complex sequence of steps, a routine that he unsuccessfully attempted to patent. He is also credited with having popularized the word &quot;copacetic&quot; through his repeated use of it in vaudeville and radio appearances.

He is famous for his dancing with Shirley Temple in a series of films during the 1930s, and for starring in the musical &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; (1943), loosely based on his own life and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. He used his popularity to challenge and overcome numerous racial barriers. Robinson was one of the first minstrel and vaudeville performers to appear as black without the use of blackface makeup, as well as one of the earliest Black performers to perform solo, overcoming vaudeville&#x27;s two-color rule. Additionally, he was an early black headliner in Broadway shows. Robinson was the first black performer to appear in a Hollywood film in an interracial dance team (with Shirley Temple in &quot;The Little Colonel&quot;, 1935), and the first black performer to headline a mixed-race Broadway production.

Robinson came under heavy criticism for his apparent tacit acceptance of racial stereotypes of the era, with some critics calling him an Uncle Tom. He strongly resented this, and his biographers suggested that critics were underestimating the difficulties faced by black performers engaging with mainstream white culture at the time, and ignoring his many efforts to overcome racial prejudice. In his public life, Robinson led efforts to persuade the Dallas Police Department to hire its first black policeman; lobby President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during World War II for equal treatment of black soldiers; and stage the first integrated public event in Miami, a fundraiser which was attended by both black and white city residents.

Robinson was a popular figure in both black and white entertainment worlds of his era, and is remembered for the support that he gave to fellow performers, including Fred Astaire, Eleanor Powell, Lena Horne, Jesse Owens and the Nicholas Brothers. Sammy Davis Jr. and Ann Miller credited him as a teacher and mentor, Miller saying that he &quot;changed the course of my life.&quot; Gregory Hines produced and starred in a biographical movie about Robinson for which he won the NAACP Best Actor Award.

Despite being the highest-paid black performer of the time, Robinson died penniless in 1949, his funeral paid for by longtime friend Ed Sullivan. In 1989, Congress designated Robinson&#x27;s birthday of May 25 as National Tap Dance Day.

==Early life==
Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson was born Luther Robinson in Richmond, Virginia on May 25, 1878, to Maxwell, a machinist, and Maria Robinson, a church choir director. He and his younger brother William were raised in Richmond&#x27;s Jackson Ward neighborhood. His grandmother Bedelia Robinson, formerly enslaved, raised him after both of his parents died tragically in 1884: his father died from chronic heart disease and his mother from unknown causes. Details of his early life are known only through legend, much of it perpetuated by Robinson himself. He claimed that he was christened Luther, a name that he did not like. He forced his younger brother William that they should exchange names, and they eventually did.
His brother subsequently adopted the name of Percy and achieved recognition as a musician under that name.

==Career==
=== Early days===
At the age of five, Robinson began dancing for small change, appearing as a &quot;hoofer&quot; or busker in local beer gardens and in front of theaters for tossed pennies. A promoter saw him performing outside the Globe Theater in Richmond and offered him a job as a &quot;pick&quot; in a local minstrel show. At that time, minstrel shows were staged by white performers in blackface. Pickaninnies were cute black children at the edge of the stage singing, dancing, or telling jokes.

In 1890, at the age of 12, Robinson ran away to Washington, D.C., where he did odd jobs at Benning Race Track and worked briefly as a jockey. In 1891, he was hired by Whallen and Martel, touring with Mayme Remington&#x27;s troupe in a show titled &quot;The South Before the War&quot;, performing again as a pickaninny, despite his age. He travelled with the show for over a year before growing too mature to play the role credibly. He later teamed up with a young Al Jolson, with Jolson singing while Robinson danced for pennies or to sell newspapers.
In 1898, he returned to Richmond where he joined the United States Army as a rifleman when the Spanish–American War started. He received an accidental gunshot wound from a second lieutenant who was cleaning his gun.

===Vaudeville===
On March 30, 1900, Robinson entered a buck-and-wing performance contest at the Bijou Theatre in Brooklyn, New York, winning a gold medal and defeating Harry Swinton, star of the show &quot;In Old Kentucky&quot; and considered the best dancer of his day. The resulting publicity helped Robinson to get work in numerous travelling shows, sometimes in a troupe, more frequently with a partner, though not always as a dancer (Robinson also sang and performed two-man comedy routines).

By 1912, Robinson was a full partner in the duo, which had become primarily a tap-dancing act, booked on both the Keith and Orpheum Circuits. The team broke up in 1914, and vaudeville performer Rae Samuels, who had performed in shows with Robinson, convinced him to meet with her manager (and husband), Marty Forkins. Under Forkins&#x27; tutelage, Robinson matured and began working as a solo act, increasing his earnings to an estimated $3,500 per week. Forkins accomplished this by inventing an alternate history for Robinson, promoting him as already being a solo act. This technique succeeded, making Robinson one of the first performers to break vaudeville&#x27;s two-coloured rule, which forbade solo Black acts.

When the U.S. entered World War I, the War Department set up a series of &quot;Liberty Theatres&quot; in the training camps. The Keith Circuit and Orpheum Circuit underwrote vaudeville acts at reduced fees, but Robinson volunteered to perform gratis for thousands of troops, in both black and white units of the expeditionary forces, receiving a commendation from the War Department in 1918.

Throughout the early 1920s, Robinson continued his career on the road as a solo vaudeville act, touring throughout the U.S. and most frequently visiting Chicago, where Marty Forkins, his manager, lived. From 1919 to 1923, he was fully booked on the Orpheum Circuit and was signed full-time by the Keith Circuit in 1924 and 1925. In addition to being booked for 50 to 52 weeks (an avid baseball fan, he took a week off for the World Series), Robinson did multiple shows per night, frequently on two different stages. In 1926 Robinson made a short tour of UK variety theatres, headlining at the Holborn Empire and, during the week of July 19, the Brighton Hippodrome.

===Tap Dance Style===
As mentioned, the chapter of Stearns&#x27; &quot;Bill Robinson: Up on the Toes&quot; titled &quot;Jazz Dance&quot; (1966) describes how Robinson introduced dancing &quot;up on the toes&quot; to tap dance. This was a new addition to King Rastus Brown&#x27;s popular &quot;flat-footed wizardry.&quot; Moving primarily from the waist down, Robinson maintained impressive control of his body. Pete Nugent is said to have remarked &quot;Robinson was the absolute tops in &quot;control&quot;.&quot; That Robinson infrequently dropped his heels marked a significant change in popular tap technique. Due to his adroit ability to be both light on his feet and distinct in his percussive taps, Robinson was called the &quot;Father of Tapology.&quot;

In 1918 at the Palace Theatre in New York, Robinson performed the stair dance. Claims regarding the origin of the stair dance were highly disputed; however, Robinson was widely credited with the dance because he made it popular. The dance involved &quot;a different rhythm for each step each one reverberating with a different pitch and the fact that he had a special set of portable steps enhanced his claim to originating the dance.&quot; The popularity of the stair dance led Robinson to file for a patent through the U.S. Patent Office in Washington D.C., ultimately to no avail; however the lack of a patent did not diminish Robinson&#x27;s professional command of the stair dance. The entertainment community began to associate the stair dance exclusively with Robinson as the routine became a standard part of his performances in 1921. Haskins reports that dancer Fred Stone sent Robinson a check for having performed the routine.

Robinson&#x27;s talents transcended his famous stair dance. The steps were not essential to Robinson&#x27;s performances; rather, Robinson would naturally shift into &quot;a little skating step to stop-time; or a scoot step, a cross-over tap&quot; or many other tap steps involved in his particular movement. Robinson changed rhythmic meter and tap steps and syncopated breaks seamlessly. Often Robinson would talk to his audience, share anecdotes, and act as if he were surprised by the action of his feet. His amusing personality was essential to his performances and popularity. Robinson is said to have consistently performed in split-soled wooden shoes, handcrafted by a Chicago craftsman.

===Broadway===
In 1928, a white impresario, Lew Leslie, produced &quot;Blackbirds of 1928&quot; on Broadway, a black revue for white audiences starring Adelaide Hall and Bill Robinson along with Aida Ward, Tim Moore and other black stars. The show originally did not include Robinson; only after three weeks of lukewarm reception did Leslie add Robinson as an &quot;extra attraction.&quot; The show then became a huge success on Broadway, where it ran for over a year to sell-out performances. On stage, Adelaide Hall and Robinson danced and sang a duet together, captivating their audiences. From then on, Robinson&#x27;s public role was that of a dapper, smiling, plaid-suited ambassador to the white world, maintaining a connection with the black show-business circles through his continuing patronage of the Hoofers Club, an entertainer&#x27;s haven in Harlem. So successful was Adelaide Hall&#x27;s collaboration with Bojangles, that they appeared together on stage at the prestigious Palace Theatre (Broadway) before they were teamed up together again by Marty Forkins (Robinson&#x27;s manager) to star in another Broadway musical titled, &quot;Brown Buddies,&quot; that opened in 1930 at the Liberty Theatre, where it ran for four months before commencing a road tour of the States.

In 1939, Robinson returned to the stage in &quot;The Hot Mikado&quot;, a jazz version of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. The show opened at the Broadhurst Theatre, with Robinson cast in the role of the Emperor. His rendition of &quot;My Object All Sublime&quot; stopped the show and produced eight encores. After Broadway, the show moved to the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, and was one of the great hits of the fair. August 25, 1939, was named &quot;Bill Robinson Day&quot; at the fair.

Robinson&#x27;s next Broadway show, &quot;All in Fun&quot; (1940), was with an all-white cast. Despite having Imogene Coca, Pert Kelton, and other stars, the show received poor reviews at out-of-town tryouts in New Haven and Boston. When the white stars and co-producers Phil Baker and Leonard Sillman withdrew, Robinson became the star, the first time an African-American headlined an otherwise all-white production. Although the reviewers were enthusiastic about Robinson, they panned the show, and it failed to attract audiences. &quot;All in Fun&quot; closed after four performances.

Robinson&#x27;s next foray on Broadway was the musical comedy &quot;Memphis Bound&quot;, which opened in May 1945. This production used an all-Black cast, including Robinson (who had top billing), Avon Long, Billy Daniels, Ada Brown, and Sheila Guyse. Robinson played the boat pilot and then Sir Joseph Porter in the play-within-a-play of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. Critics widely praised Robinson&#x27;s performance and especially his dancing, with his stair dance cited as a high point of the show.

===Film career===
After 1932, black stage revues waned in popularity, but Robinson remained in vogue with white audiences for more than a decade in some fourteen motion pictures produced by such companies as RKO, 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures. Most of them had musical settings, in which he played old-fashioned roles in nostalgic romances.

==== Early films ====
Robinson&#x27;s film debut was in the 1930 musical &quot;Dixiana&quot;. RKO was formed in part by a merger of the Keith and Orpheum theater circuits, with whom Robinson had performed as a headliner for many years. He was cast as a specialty performer in a standalone scene. This practice, customary at the time, permitted Southern theaters to remove scenes containing black performers from their showings of the film. &quot;Dixiana&quot; was followed by Robinson&#x27;s first starring role, in &quot;Harlem Is Heaven&quot; (1932), which sometimes is cited as the first film with an all-black cast, even though all-black silent films preceded it and the cast of &quot;Harlem Is Heaven&quot; includes a white actor with a speaking part, as well as a few white extras. The movie was produced in New York and did not perform well financially, leading Robinson to focus on Hollywood-produced movies after that.

====Shirley Temple====

The idea for bringing a black dancer to Fox to star with Temple in &quot;The Little Colonel&quot; was first proposed by Fox head Winfield Sheehan after a discussion with D. W. Griffith. Sheehan set his sights on Robinson but, unsure of his ability as an actor, arranged for a contract that was void if Robinson failed the dramatic test. Robinson passed the test and was brought in to star with Temple and to teach her tap dancing. They quickly hit it off, as Temple recounted years later:

Robinson walked a step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he shortened his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn&#x27;t looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his attention to what I was doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his eyes wide and rows of brilliant teeth showing in a wide smile. When he took my hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. &quot;Can I call you Uncle Billy?&quot; I asked. &quot;Why sure you can,&quot; he replied...&quot;But then I get to call you darlin.&#x27;&quot; It was a deal. From then on, whenever we walked together it was hand in hand, and I was always his &quot;darlin.&#x27;&quot;

Temple had appeared in five films released in 1934 and had performed a tap routine with James Dunn in &quot;Stand Up and Cheer!&quot; After Robinson was signed by 20th Century Fox, it was decided that he would perform his famous stair dance with Temple. While Robinson liked the idea, he quickly realized that he could not teach his complex stair dance to a seven-year-old in the few days permitted by the shooting schedule. Instead, he taught Temple to kick the riser (face) of each stairstep with her toe. After watching her practice his choreography, Robinson modified his routine to mimic her movements, so that it appeared on film that she was imitating his steps. The sequence was the highlight of the film.

Robinson and Temple became the first interracial dance partners in Hollywood history. The scene was controversial for its time, and was cut out in the South along with all other scenes showing the two making physical contact. Temple and Robinson appeared in four films together: &quot;The Little Colonel&quot;, &quot;The Littlest Rebel&quot;, &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot; and &quot;Just Around the Corner&quot;.

Robinson and Temple became close friends as a result of his dance coaching and acting with her. Robinson carried pictures of Temple with him wherever he traveled, and Temple considered him a lifelong friend, saying in an interview &quot;Bill Robinson treated me as an equal, which was very important to me. He didn&#x27;t talk down to me, like to a little girl. And I liked people like that. And Bill Robinson was the best of all.&quot;

====Other films====
Robinson refused to play stereotypical roles imposed by Hollywood studios. In a small vignette in &quot;Hooray for Love&quot; (1935), he played a mayor of Harlem modeled after his own ceremonial honor; in &quot;One Mile from Heaven&quot; (1937), he played a romantic lead with African-American actress Fredi Washington after Hollywood had relaxed its taboo against such roles for Blacks.

Robinson appeared opposite Will Rogers in &quot;In Old Kentucky&quot; (1935), the last movie Rogers made before his death in an airplane crash. Robinson and Rogers were good friends, and after Rogers&#x27; death, Robinson refused to fly, instead travelling by train to Hollywood for his film work. 

==== &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; ====
Robinson&#x27;s final film appearance was a starring role in the 1943 Fox musical &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;. Lena Horne co-starred as Robinson&#x27;s love interest, and the movie also featured Fats Waller in his final movie appearance before his death, playing with Cab Calloway and his orchestra. The Nicholas Brothers are featured in the film&#x27;s final dance sequence, performing to Calloway&#x27;s &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jive&quot;, in what Fred Astaire called &quot;the greatest movie musical number he had ever seen.&quot;

In 2001, &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

===Radio and sound recordings===
From 1936 until his death in 1949, Robinson made numerous radio and occasional television appearances. The distinctive sound of Robinson&#x27;s tap dancing was frequently featured, but Robinson also sang, made sound effects, and told jokes and stories from his vaudeville acts. He also addressed the audience directly, something very rare for a black radio performer in that era.

Robinson also made several recordings, including one in which he demonstrated each of his tap steps and their corresponding sounds. It was also on the radio and in his recordings that Robinson introduced and popularized a word of his own invention, &quot;copasetic&quot;, which he had used for years in his vaudeville shows, and which was added to &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; in 1934.

===Final appearances===
The last theatrical project for Robinson was to have been &quot;Two Gentlemen from the South&quot;, with James Barton as the master and Robinson as his servant, in which the black and white roles reverse and eventually the two come together as equals, but the show did not open.

Robinson&#x27;s final public appearance in 1949, a few weeks before his death, was as a surprise guest on Ted Mack&#x27;s &quot;The Original Amateur Hour&quot;, in which he emotionally embraced a competitor on the show who had tap-danced for the audience. A friend remarked &quot;he was handing over his crown, like him saying &#x27;this is my goodbye.&#x27;&quot;

==Personal life and death==

Little is known of Robinson&#x27;s first marriage to Lena Chase in 1907. They separated in 1916, and the divorce was finalized in 1922. His second wife was Fannie S. Clay whom he married shortly after his divorce from Chase. They divorced in 1943. His third marriage was in 1944 to Elaine Plaines in Columbus, Ohio, and they remained together until Robinson&#x27;s death in 1949. There were no children from any of the marriages.

Political figures and celebrities appointed Robinson an honorary mayor of Harlem, a lifetime member of policemen&#x27;s associations and fraternal orders, and a mascot of the New York Giants. Robinson reciprocated with open-handed generosity and frequently credited the White dancer James Barton for his contribution to his dancing style.

Despite being the highest-paid black performer of the first half of the 20th century, earning more than US$2 million during his lifetime, Robinson died penniless on November 25, 1949, from heart failure. His funeral was arranged and paid for by longtime friend and television host Ed Sullivan. Robinson lay in repose at the 369th Infantry Regiment Armory in Harlem, where an estimated 32,000 people filed past his open casket to pay their last respects. The schools in Harlem were closed for a half-day so that children could attend or listen to the funeral, which was broadcast over the radio. Reverend Adam Clayton Powell Sr. conducted the service at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, and New York Mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer gave the eulogy. His honorary pallbearers were Duke Ellington, Joe Lewis, Bob Hope, Jackie Robinson, Joe DiMaggio, and Irving Berlin. Robinson is buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens, Brooklyn, New York.

==Legacy==

Robinson was a popular figure in both black and white entertainment worlds of his era, and is remembered for the support that he gave to fellow performers, including Fred Astaire, Eleanor Powell, Lena Horne, Jesse Owens and the Nicholas Brothers.

Robinson was successful despite the obstacle of racism. A favorite Robinson anecdote is that he seated himself in a restaurant and a customer objected to his presence. When the manager suggested that it might be better if Robinson leave, he smiled and asked, &quot;Have you got a ten-dollar bill?&quot; Politely asking to borrow the manager&#x27;s note for a moment, Robinson added six $10 bills from his own wallet and mixed them up, then extended the seven bills together, adding, &quot;Here, let&#x27;s see you pick out the colored one&quot;. The restaurant manager served Robinson without further delay.

Robinson co-founded the New York Black Yankees baseball team in Harlem in 1936 with financier James &quot;Soldier Boy&quot; Semler. The team was a successful member of the Negro National League until it disbanded in 1948 after Major League Baseball was desegregated.

In 1989, a joint U.S. Senate/House resolution declared National Tap Dance Day to be May 25, the anniversary of Bill Robinson&#x27;s birth.

Robinson was inducted into the National Museum of Dance&#x27;s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 1987.

==Popular myths, legends, and misconceptions==
There are several commonly cited anecdotes about Robinson that are likely the result of conflicting stories put out by Robinson&#x27;s second wife Fanny, or his manager, Marty Forkins, or by various show business associates of Robinson. There are also numerous documented instances in which Robinson gave conflicting stories to news reporters at different times.

According to his biographer, Robinson had previously served in the Spanish–American War, where he sustained an accidental gunshot wound. He was 36 when the U.S entered World War I, and received a letter of commendation from the War Department for his work during the war in boosting morale at training camps in the United States, not overseas.

It has further been claimed that, along with serving in the trenches in World War I, Robinson was also the drum major for the 369th Hellfighters Band and led the regimental band up Fifth Avenue on the 369th&#x27;s return from overseas.

While numerous sources repeat the claim of Bill Robinson&#x27;s appointment as drum major in the 369th Regiment Band, this is not mentioned in either &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;, the Bill Robinson biography by Jim Haskins and N.R. Mitgang, or &quot;A Life in Ragtime&quot;, the biography of James Reese Europe, the leader of the 369th regimental band.

===The origin of the nickname &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;===
Tales about the origin of Robinson&#x27;s nickname varied across the color line, a consequence of differing opinions of him by black and white people. To whites, for example, his nickname &quot;Bojangles&quot; meant happy-go-lucky, while the Black variety artist Tom Fletcher claimed it was slang for &quot;squabbler.&quot; Robinson himself said he got the nickname as a child in Richmond, which is the most commonly-accepted version.

===Marriage to Fanny Clay===
The date and location of Robinson&#x27;s second marriage to Fanny Clay, or even the year they met, is uncertain because the couple gave different dates and locations in interviews, possibly because they were worried about unfavorable publicity about the marriage occurring so soon after Robinson&#x27;s divorce. Robinson&#x27;s biographer estimates that they met in late 1920 and were married in early 1922.

===First Meeting with Marty Forkins===
Robinson&#x27;s meeting with Marty Forkins, the man who became his manager, is said to have occurred when Robinson, working as a waiter, spilled soup on Forkins. After Robinson&#x27;s death, Forkins and his wife Rae Samuels admitted that Samuels made the introduction after having seen Robinson perform with his partner George Cooper. Their explanation was that the story was made up in order to obscure Robinson&#x27;s and Cooper&#x27;s partnership, and to more effectively promote Robinson as a solo act. The ruse was successful, making Robinson one of the early solo acts to break vaudeville&#x27;s two-colored rule, which required African-American performers to work in pairs.

===Legendary dance contest===
A dance contest among Robinson and three other dance legends (typically Ray Bolger, Fred Astaire, and James Barton) in which Robinson emerges the victor is recounted in many places, but no verifiable source can be found describing where and when the contest might have taken place.

===Copacetic===
Robinson is given credit for having popularized the word copacetic and claimed to have invented it while still living in Richmond. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; lists the origins of the word as &quot;unknown&quot; and documents the earliest written use of the word in 1919 by the newspaperman and author Irving Bacheller in his serialized book &quot;A Man for the Ages&quot;; this was followed by uses in 1926 by Carl Van Vechten in his novel &quot;Nigger Heaven&quot;, in 1934 in &quot;Webster&#x27;s New International Dictionary&quot; and by John O&#x27;Hara in his novel &quot;Appointment in Samarra&quot;. Haskins&#x27; biography of Robinson states &quot;Bill was shelling peas at the Jefferson Market, a &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot; reporter asked him how he was, and the reply just popped into his head: &#x27;I&#x27;m copasetic. The word was not popularized until Robinson used the term as an opening for his vaudeville and radio performances. The word was used in films Robinson made with Shirley Temple in the 1930s.

===World record for running backward ===
One of Robinson&#x27;s methods for generating publicity in cities where he was not the headliner was to engage in &quot;freak sprinting&quot; races, such as running backward. In 1922, Robinson set the world record for running backward (100 yards in 13.5 seconds). The record stood until 1977, when Paul Wilson ran the distance in 13.3 seconds. Although Robinson&#x27;s speed running backwards is undisputed, the circumstances in which this feat was accepted as a world record are unclear, and were likely the result of a staged publicity event rather than a sanctioned athletic contest.

===The song &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;===
Jerry Jeff Walker&#x27;s 1968 folk song &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot; has been misinterpreted as a song about Robinson; it indirectly refers to Robinson through the lead character&#x27;s use of his nickname &quot;Bojangles,&quot; a reference to both being adept at tap dance. According to Walker, a street performer in the New Orleans first precinct jail who called himself Bo Jangles was the subject of the song. In the song, the street performer is a heavy drinker and has a dog that died; Walker also noted that the street-performer Bo Jangles was white. By Robinson&#x27;s own account and those of his friends, he neither smoked nor drank (although he was a frequent and avid gambler), and he never had a dog.

==Controversies==

=== Uncle Tom roles ===
Robinson came under heavy criticism for playing stereotyped roles, and took offense at such claims. Once, after being called an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; in the newspaper &quot;The New York Age&quot;, Robinson went to its office in Harlem, pistol in hand, demanding to see the editor. In his eulogy at Robinson&#x27;s funeral, Rev. Adam Clayton Powell argued against the claim that Robinson was an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; figure, focusing on Robinson&#x27;s ability as an entertainer and a man who transcended color lines.

In 1973, the film historian Donald Bogle refers to Robinson&#x27;s role in &quot;The Littlest Rebel&quot; and other Shirley Temple movies as the &quot;quintessential Uncle Tom.&quot; Other critics noted that such criticism fails to account for the genuine affection and chemistry between Robinson and Temple that came through on the screen and that the role represented a breakthrough for Hollywood stereotypes in that it was the first time a black man was made the guardian of a white life. Bogle later moderated his criticism by noting that the reliable, articulate Uncle Billy character in &quot;The Littlest Rebel&quot; was a cut above the characters portrayed by Lincoln &quot;Stepin Fetchit&quot; Perry.

Haskins explains that critics calling Robinson an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; often disregarded the discriminatory limitations Robinson endured and combated throughout his career. In addition to the impact of Jim Crow policies and the Depression, Haskins writes, &quot;That Bill traveled, at least professionally, in increasingly white circles was not so much a matter of choice as one of reality.&quot; Having overcome numerous policies inhibiting his success to reach an unmatched level of stardom, Robinson had limited venue opportunities for a performer of his caliber.

In 1933, Robinson was named an honorary Mayor of Harlem for his philanthropic contributions to his community and for his renowned success. He took this role seriously, performing over 3,000 benefits in the course of his career, aiding hundreds of unorganized charities and individuals.

=== Trial and imprisonment ===
On March 21, 1908, as a result of a dispute with a tailor over a suit, Robinson was arrested in New York City for armed robbery. On September 30, he was convicted and sentenced to 11 to 15 years hard labor at Sing Sing prison. Robinson had failed to take the charges and trial seriously and paid little attention to mounting a defense. After his conviction, Robinson&#x27;s partner George Cooper organized his more influential friends to vouch for him and hired a new attorney who produced evidence that Robinson had been falsely accused. Although he was exonerated at his second trial and his accusers were indicted for perjury, the trial and time spent in the Tombs (Manhattan&#x27;s prison complex) affected Robinson deeply. After he was released, he made a point of registering his pistol at the local police station of each town where he performed. Robinson&#x27;s second wife, Fanny, also sent a letter of introduction with complimentary tickets and other gifts to the local police chief&#x27;s wife in each town ahead of Robinson&#x27;s engagements.

===Jesse Owens===
After Jesse Owens returned from the 1936 Olympics, Robinson befriended him. Despite his fame from his four Olympic track wins, undermining Adolf Hitler&#x27;s claims of Aryan supremacy, Owens found most of the offers that had been made to employ him had been nothing more than publicity stunts that had no substance. Robinson was the one exception, finding work for Owens within a few months of his return to the U.S. Robinson also introduced Owens to his manager, Marty Forkins, who secured a series of demonstration races for Owens which were viewed by many as degrading to the dignity of an Olympic athlete, most notably an event in Cuba in which Owens raced against a horse. As a result, Forkins and Robinson were viewed as having taken advantage of Owens. According to Forkins’ son, Robinson had told Owens that he should start running demonstration races that would both earn money for him and keep him in the public eye. Robinson had done many such races (including a race in which he set the world record for running backwards) and did not view them as undignified. Moreover, the events paid Owens well and provided him with a source of funds when no one else was offering him employment or helping him financially. Owens made a gift to Robinson of one of his four Olympic gold medals, as a gesture of gratitude for the help Robinson had given him.

=== &quot;Café Metropole&quot; and Jeni Le Gon ===
In 1937, Robinson caused a stir in the Harlem community by choosing Geneva Sawyer, a white dancer, as his dance partner over Jeni Le Gon in the Twentieth Century Fox film &quot;Café Metropole&quot; (1937). Le Gon had danced with him in &quot;Hooray for Love&quot; (1935) and had received favorable reviews. Sawyer had been Shirley Temple&#x27;s dance coach during the time Temple and Robinson made movies together, and Sawyer had taken tap lessons from Robinson while he was teaching Temple and choreographing her routines. Robinson suggested to the producers that Sawyer could be cast as his partner if she wore blackface. Le Gon&#x27;s career suffered as a result, and she never worked with Robinson again. Although the scene was shot with Sawyer in blackface, the studio became convinced that a mixed-race adult couple dancing together would be too controversial. Both scenes with Robinson were cut from the final version of the movie, and the deleted scenes were only released in 2008 as part of a Fox DVD boxed set of Tyrone Power movies.

<doc id="888303" wikidata="Q113422" url="?curid=888303" title="Diane de France">
<text>Diane de France, &quot;suo jure&quot; Duchess of Angoulême (25 July 1538 – 11 January 1619) was the natural (illegitimate) daughter of Henry II of France and his Italian lover Filippa Duci. She played an important political role during the French Wars of Religion and built the Hôtel d&#x27;Angoulême in Paris. She was the favorite of her half-brother, Henry III of France.

==Birth and early life==
Born 25 July 1538, Diane de France was the illegitimate daughter of eighteen-year-old dauphin Henry and Filippa Duci (), the daughter of a minor Italian nobleman of Fossano in the Piedmont. Her father was in Moncalieri in northern Italy on a military campaign. It is not known whether she was born at court or was brought there when still very young. At court, her care and upbringing were entrusted to Henry&#x27;s mistress, Diane de Poitiers.

Diane&#x27;s father treated her well: her household included a governess, tutors, maids of honor, chamber valets, and even a tailor. She learned to write in excellent French, the proof of which can be seen in the large number letters that still survive. She also learned Italian (the second language of the court), Spanish, and enough Latin for religious ceremonies. Her artistic education was not neglected: she also learned to play lute and other instruments, and to sing.

She was not formally legitimised until much later, in 1572 (not 1547 as previously believed).

==First marriage==
On 13 February 1552, when Diane de France was thirteen, a contract was signed by which she married Orazio Farnese, Duke of Castro (). The wedding ceremony on 15 February 1553 was attended by Orazio&#x27;s brother Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and included masquerades and carnival banquets. She became a widow five months later, on 18 July 1553, when Orazio was killed while serving with French forces at the siege of Hesdin. She spent her period of mourning at the Château de Chantilly, home of Anne de Montmorency, Connétable de France, then returned to court in the service of Catherine de Medici.

==Second marriage==
Diane&#x27;s second marriage was to François de Montmorency, eldest son of Anne de Montmorency, by a contract of 3 May 1557 and a ceremony that took place on 4 June 1557 at the Château de Villers-Cotterêts. They had a son, named Anne after his grandfather, born by late September 1560 but dead before 15 October.

On 22 June 1563, after the death of her father and then her half-brother Francis II, the new king, her half-brother Charles IX gave her, by &quot;lettres patentes&quot; signed at the Château de Vincennes, the Duchy of Châtellerault. The annual revenues of about 6,000 livres were meant to compensate for the gift of 50,000 écus promised for her first marriage but never paid from the royal treasury. The revenues from this duchy were far less than what she was owed. After the death of Charles, Diane became a favourite of the new king, her other half-brother Henri III. In February 1576, he signed additional &quot;lettres patentes&quot;, giving her the lands and &quot;seigneuries&quot; of Coucy and Folembray, including the Château de Folembray (both in today&#x27;s &quot;département&quot; of Aisne), as well as some other estates in the Bourbonnais.

Diane was widowed for a second time in 1579, after helping make her husband a leader of the politiques, a moderate Roman Catholic group in France.

==Later life==
In August 1582, Henry III gave her the Duchy of Angoulême in exchange for that of Châtellerault, making her Duchess of Angoulême in appanage (during her lifetime only). The new title came with increased wealth, so in 1584 she started building a new Paris residence, the Hôtel d&#x27;Angoulême (now the Hôtel Lamoignon). Construction was likely interrupted by the Wars of Religion, and only completed with a second phase of construction in 1611. 

Diane also enjoyed much respect at the court of Henry IV, King of France, and superintended the education of his son Louis XIII.

Diane died on 11 January 1619 in Paris. Her surviving letters reveal her as a woman of great courage and tolerance.

<doc id="888313" wikidata="Q2373170" url="?curid=888313" title="Nancy (comic strip)">
<text>Nancy is an American comic strip, originally written and drawn by Ernie Bushmiller and distributed by United Feature Syndicate and Andrews McMeel Syndication. Its origins lie in &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot;, a strip Bushmiller inherited from its creator Larry Whittington in 1925. After Fritzi&#x27;s niece Nancy was introduced in 1933, &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot; evolved to focus more and more on Nancy instead of Fritzi. The new strip took the old one&#x27;s daily slot, while &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot; continued as a Sunday comic, with &quot;Nancy&quot; taking the Sunday slot previously filled by Bushmiller&#x27;s &quot;Phil Fumble&quot; strip beginning on October 30, 1938.

== History ==
=== 1922 to 1982 ===
The character of Nancy, a precocious eight-year-old, first appeared in the strip &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot;, a comic about a professional actress and her family and friends. Larry Whittington began &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot; in 1922, and it was taken over by Bushmiller three years later. On January 2, 1933, Bushmiller introduced Fritzi&#x27;s niece, Nancy. In 1949, he was quoted as saying that he originally intended Nancy &quot;just as an incidental character and I planned to keep her for about a week and then dump her ... But the little dickens was soon stealing the show and Bushmiller, the ingrate, was taking all the bows.&quot; Nancy became the focus of the daily strip, which was renamed for her in 1938 after Lawrence W. Hager, the editor of the Owensboro, Kentucky &quot;Inquirer-Messenger&quot; (now the &quot;Messenger-Inquirer&quot;), lobbied for the change; Sluggo Smith, Nancy&#x27;s friend from the &quot;&quot; had been introduced earlier that year, and the strip&#x27;s popularity rose. Comics historian Don Markstein ascribed the strip&#x27;s success to Bushmiller&#x27;s &quot;bold, clear art style, combined with his ability to construct a type of gag that appealed to a very broad audience.

Fritzi Ritz became a secondary character, although her solo strip continued as a Sunday-only strip, where her relationship with Phil Fumble (who&#x27;d been featured in his own Sunday topper strip since 1932) was an ongoing presence until his departure in 1968. &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot; continued as a Sunday feature (with &quot;Nancy&quot; as a topper) until that year when it too was replaced with &quot;Nancy&quot; permanently. At its peak in the 1970s, &quot;Nancy&quot; ran in more than 880 newspapers, before falling to 79 shortly before Guy Gilchrist&#x27;s departure from the strip in 2018.

=== 1982 to 2018 ===
After Bushmiller&#x27;s death in 1982, the strip was produced by different writers and artists. Mark Lasky briefly handled the daily strip in 1982/1983 until his death from cancer at age 29. Al Plastino worked on Sunday episodes of &quot;Nancy&quot; from 1982 to 1984 after Bushmiller died. During that period, David Letterman showed on TV a &quot;Nancy&quot; panel with Plastino&#x27;s signature and made a joke about Plastino as a superhero name. (Letterman&#x27;s writers were apparently unaware that Plastino was known for his superheroes.)

The daily strip was handed to Jerry Scott in 1983 and the Sunday in 1985. Scott gradually started to draw the strip in a much different, more modern style than other incarnations. In an interview in 2024, Scott said that he had never been an enthusiast of &quot;Nancy&quot; and only accepted the job as a way of breaking in to the newspaper strip industry, so after about a year he felt burnt out on imitating Bushmiller&#x27;s style and wanted to try his own approach. In 1994, the syndicate sought a replacement for Scott; applicants included Ivan Brunetti and Gary Hallgren. In 1995, Guy and Brad Gilchrist were given control of the strip; Guy Gilchrist subsequently became the sole writer and illustrator.

* Guy (and Brad) Gilchrist: September 3, 1995 – February 18, 2018

=== 2018 to present ===
After 22 years, Gilchrist&#x27;s last &quot;Nancy&quot; strip came out on February 18, 2018, which involved the marriage between the characters of Fritzi Ritz and Phil Fumble. The strip resumed on April 9 with a &quot;21st-century female perspective&quot; by Olivia Jaimes (a pen name), the strip&#x27;s first female creator. At the time of the announcement, 75 newspapers still ran the strip. Jaimes said, &quot;Nancy has been my favorite sassy grouch for a long time. I&#x27;m excited to be sassy and grouchy through her voice instead of just mine&quot; and &quot;the Nancy I know and love is a total jerk and also gluttonous and also has big feelings and voraciously consumes her world&quot;. Comics historian Tom Spurgeon described Jaimes as funny and talented, with an approach to the character that both breaks with and pays homage to Bushmiller&#x27;s version.

In the process, Jaimes updated the content of the strip, such as Nancy frequently using her smartphone and attending robotics classes. The September 3, 2018, strip spawned an Internet meme, depicting Nancy riding a hoverboard using two phones, one of which was attached to a selfie stick, and proclaiming that &quot;Sluggo is .&quot; Jaimes described her aim with that strip to &quot;most upset the person who likes me the least ... somebody who&#x27;s like, &#x27;Nancy sucks now&#x27; ... what I imagine my greatest hater would despise most is Nancy interacting with every piece of technology using words you don&#x27;t understand.&quot;

In May 2024 Jaimes announced that she would take &#x27;a temporary break&#x27; from &quot;Nancy&quot;, and that a host of guest artists would take the strip on for limited periods. The first artist to do so was Leigh Luna, starting with a Sunday page on 23 June 2024. The second was Shaenon K. Garrity, starting with a strip on Monday, 8 July 2024. The third was Caroline Cash, starting with a strip on Monday, 22 July 2024. Jaimes resumed working on &quot;Nancy&quot; on Monday, 2 September 2024.

== Art styles ==
The artists who followed Bushmiller drew in a range of styles that deviated distinctly from his deceptively simple approach. Despite the changes in art style over the years, however, it is Bushmiller&#x27;s work that is still most closely identified with the strip.

Bushmiller refined and simplified his drawing style over the years to create a uniquely stylized comic world. &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&quot; illustrates its entry on &quot;comic strip&quot; with a &quot;Nancy&quot; cartoon. Despite the small size of the reproduction, both the art and the gag are clear, and an eye-tracking survey once determined that &quot;Nancy&quot; was so conspicuous that it was the first strip most people viewed on a newspaper comics page.

In a 1988 essay, &quot;How to Read Nancy&quot;, Mark Newgarden and Paul Karasik offered a probing analysis of Bushmiller&#x27;s strip:
Comics theorist Scott McCloud described the essence of Nancy:
Cartoonist Wally Wood described &quot;Nancy&quot;″s design more succinctly: &quot;By the time you decided not to read it, you already had.&quot;

== Characters ==
===Primary characters===

* Nancy Ritz, a typical and somewhat mischievous eight-year-old girl. She encourages her friend Sluggo to improve himself and is instantly jealous of any other girls who pay attention to him. During Gilchrist&#x27;s run, she was portrayed as living in Three Rocks, Tennessee (a suburb of Nashville) although her home town was unspecified by other artists. Bushmiller located her home as 220 Oak Street next to Elm Avenue. She attends Central Elementary School in the Jaimes version. Aside from creating Nancy as Fritzi&#x27;s niece, Bushmiller claimed to know nothing about her lineage, adding &#x27;Very occasionally, I get curious kids asking me, but I don&#x27;t know what to tell them.&#x27;
* Fritzi Ritz, Nancy&#x27;s paternal aunt, with whom she lives. When Nancy initially appeared in the &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot; comic strip, Fritzi was living with her father, George. The Fritzi character was gradually phased out in the mid-1980s before being dropped entirely by the end of the decade but returned as a main character in 1995 when the strip was taken over by brothers Brad and Guy Gilchrist. In the current version of &quot;Nancy&quot;, Fritzi acts as Nancy&#x27;s full-time carer.
* Sluggo Smith, Nancy&#x27;s best friend, introduced in 1938. Sluggo is Nancy&#x27;s age and is a poor ragamuffin-type from the wrong side of the tracks. He has sometimes been described as Nancy&#x27;s boyfriend and indeed the GoComics website features an article describing Nancy and Sluggo&#x27;s relationship as &#x27;a romance for the ages.&#x27; He has often been portrayed as lazy, and his favourite pastime seems to be napping; in 1976 Bushmiller told a reporter who asked how Sluggo supported himself: &quot;I assume he delivers groceries on Saturday, or something like that.&quot; In the Gilchrist version, Sluggo lives at 720 Drabb Street in an abandoned house he found and according to a storyline in 2013 strips, is taken care of by truck driver &quot;uncles&quot; Les and More, who discovered that he had lived in an orphanage; his mother died after he was born, and his father died serving his country. Sluggo&#x27;s Uncle Vince is shady and his rich Aunt Maggie in California doesn&#x27;t care about him because he reminds her of when she was poor. Gilchrist&#x27;s Sluggo ran away from the orphanage, his cousin Chauncey gave him $200 and he took the train as far as Three Rocks. Jaimes&#x27; version of Sluggo is very different: he is thoughtful, a dedicated reader, and his living conditions are not shown. There is also very little to suggest that he is Nancy&#x27;s boyfriend in the Jaimes version of the strip, although they are often seen in conversation together and Sluggo is anxious to please Nancy.

===Secondary characters===
* Agnes and Lucy, Nancy&#x27;s identical twin friends in the Jaimes version. Agnes, the more wily twin, wears her hair down, and Lucy, the more idealistic and artistic twin, wears her hair up.
* Amal, Magnet School student who was opposing team captain during a basketball competition (Jaimes version).
* Art camp counselor, an unnamed character in the Jaimes version, who is a very physically fit art teacher.
* Dae-hyun: &quot;Dae-hyun was first introduced in the [May 16, 2020] &quot;Nancy&quot;. He is a student at the Magnet School who also works as an announcer. His hobbies are studying and skateboarding. His favorite food is pizza.&quot; (Jaimes version).
* Derek, the number one socializer at the Magnet School (Jaimes version). 
* Devon P., Robotics Competition opponent from North Elementary School (Jaimes version).
* Estella, new Robotics Club member in the Jaimes version, a tech whiz who loves cute and small things (e.g., robots, puppies, tourbillons, Poochie, bows, Esther&#x27;s grumpiness, etc.).
* Esther, a girl in Nancy&#x27;s class in the Jaimes version. Introduced in 2018, she has a patchy relationship with Nancy.
*Grandma, Nancy&#x27;s grandmother in the Jaimes version.
*Jerome, Magnet School student who writes poignant short stories (Jaimes version). 
* Judy, Nancy&#x27;s cousin who looks like her.
* Leon, Magnet School student (Jaimes version).
* Lyle, a blonde male classmate of Nancy&#x27;s in the Jaimes version, who nearly always wears sandals with socks, regardless of the weather.
* Marigold, Sluggo&#x27;s tomboy cousin.
* Melissa Bangles, one of Nancy&#x27;s teachers in the Jaimes version, who had thwarted hopes of a basketball career.
* Mildred, originally Esther&#x27;s and then also Nancy&#x27;s rival in the Jaimes version. She used to go to a nearby magnet school that Esther used to also attend. She now attends Central Elementary and is in Nancy&#x27;s math class.
* Nita, Nancy&#x27;s math and robotics teacher, a character in the Jaimes version whose internal monologue often reflects on the difficulty and rewards of teaching.
* Old man, an unnamed character in the Jaimes version, a cranky oldster who has been affectionately dubbed &quot;Ernest Dangit&quot; by some fans.
* Oona Goosepimple, the spooky-looking child who lives in a haunted house down the road from Nancy&#x27;s house. She originally appeared only in the comic book version of the strip, during John Stanley&#x27;s tenure in the late 1950s and early 1960s. She appeared in the actual comic strip for the first time on October 16, 2013.
* Pee Wee, a neighborhood toddler who is known for his extreme literalness.
* Phil Fumble, Fritzi&#x27;s boyfriend. When Nancy debuted in the &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot; comic strip, Fritzi had a procession of boyfriends, such as &quot;Wally&quot;. Phil Fumble was the subject of his own strip by Bushmiller. He was written out in 1968 but made a reappearance in the November 27, 2012, strip, and became a regular character as of early January 2013, with the intention of furthering his relationship with Aunt Fritzi. Phil and Fritzi married in Gilchrist&#x27;s last strip. This character does not currently appear in Jaimes&#x27; version of the strip.
* Poochie, Nancy&#x27;s dog (white with a large black spot on its back and black ears). A white dog with a black patch on its back and one black ear, identified by Nancy as hers, first appeared in the strip on January 13, 1933, however this dog was known as &#x27;Woofy&#x27;. Poochie was first seen in the Jaimes version of the strip on June 27, 2018, although she was not mentioned by name in the Jaimes version until September 23, 2019. Poochie is regarded by Nancy and Fritzi as foolish, but she often outsmarts them. 
*Pussycat, Nancy&#x27;s adopted stray cat, who does not currently appear in the Jaimes version of the strip. Nancy first attempted to adopt an (unnamed) cat on January 18, 1933.
* Rollo Haveall, the stereotypical but nonetheless friendly rich kid. In the early 1940s, the strip&#x27;s &quot;rich kid&quot; was known as Marmaduke and in 2013, Rollo&#x27;s father&#x27;s name is given as Rollo Marmaduke Sr.
* Spike Kelly (a.k.a. Butch), the town bully who frequently fights with Sluggo, but does not always win out.

== Awards ==
Bushmiller won the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Humor Comic Strip Award for 1961 and the Society&#x27;s Reuben Award for Best Cartoonist of the Year in 1976.

In 1995, the strip was selected as one of the 20 in the &quot;Comic Strip Classics&quot; series of commemorative U.S. postage stamps.

== Comic books ==
There were first several Fritzi Ritz comic stories in comics published by United Feature Syndicate. These include &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot; No. 1 (1948), 3–7 (1949), #27–36 (1953–1954); &quot;United Comics&quot; #8–36 (1950–1953); &quot;Tip Topper Comics&quot; #1–28 (1949–1954); St John published &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot; #37–55 (1955–1957). Dell published &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot; #56–59 (1957–1958)

Nancy appeared in comic books—initially in a 1940s comic strip reprint title from United Feature, later St. John Publications and later in a Dell comic written by John Stanley. Titled &quot;Nancy and Sluggo&quot;, United Feature published #16–23 (1949–1954), St. John published #121–145 (1955–1957). Titled &quot;Nancy&quot;, until retitled &quot;Nancy and Sluggo&quot; with issue No. 174, Dell published #146–187 (1957–1962). (Hy Eisman produced some of Dell&#x27;s Nancy stories in 1960–61. Gold Key published #188–192 (1962–1963). Dell also published &quot;Dell Giants&quot; devoted to Nancy (#35, No. 45 and &quot;Traveltime&quot;), and a &quot;Four Color&quot; #1034. Nancy and Sluggo also appeared in stories in &quot;Tip Top Comics&quot; published by United Feature (#1–188), St. Johns (#189–210), and Dell (#211–225), &quot;Sparkler&quot; #1–120 (1941–1954) and &quot;Sparkle&quot; #1–33 (1953–1954) published by United Feature. Fritzi Ritz and Nancy appeared in several &quot;Comics on Parade&quot; (#32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 55, 57, 60–104) published by United Feature.

&quot;Nancy&quot; was reprinted in the British comic paper &quot;The Topper&quot;, between the 1950s and the 1970s. &quot;Nancy&quot; also had its own monthly comic book magazine of newspaper reprints in Norway (where the strip is known as &quot;Trulte&quot;) during 1956–1959.

== Animation ==
Nancy was featured in two animated shorts by the Terrytoons studio in 1942: &quot;Doing Their Bit&quot; and &quot;School Daze&quot;. A third cartoon, &quot;Nancy&#x27;s Little Theatre&quot;, was announced with a release date of October 16, 1942, but seems not to have been completed; &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; was the only trade journal to include it in booking listings, and later pulled it.

In 1971, several newly created Nancy and Sluggo cartoons appeared on the Saturday morning cartoon series &quot;Archie&#x27;s TV Funnies&quot;, which starred the Archie Comic Series characters running a television station. Nancy appeared along with seven other comic strip characters: Emmy Lou, Broom-Hilda, Dick Tracy, The Dropouts, Moon Mullins, the Captain and the Kids and Smokey Stover. The series lasted one season. In 1978, she was also featured in several segments of Filmation&#x27;s animated show &quot;Fabulous Funnies&quot;, a repackaging of &quot;Archie&#x27;s TV Funnies&quot; material minus the Archie characters wraparounds.

== Foreign versions ==

&quot;Nancy&quot; has been translated into a variety of languages, often with changes to characters&#x27; names. In Sweden, the strip is called &quot;Lisa och Sluggo&quot;. In French, Nancy is called Philomène in Canada, and Zoé in France, where the strip is called &quot;Arthur et Zoé&quot; (Arthur being the French name of Sluggo). Nancy also appeared on the back cover of the popular Arabic children magazine &quot;Majid&quot; during the 80s, she was known as Moza while Sluggo was portrayed as her brother Rashoud. In Mexico she is known as Periquita, while Sluggo is called Tito. In Brazil, Nancy and Sluggo were called Xuxuquinha and Marciano in the 60s and in the following decade as Tico and Teca (Sluggo and Nancy respectively).

== Cultural references ==
Bushmiller&#x27;s artwork has inspired other artists:

;Comics
* Cartoonist Bill Griffith has used the characters and emulated Bushmiller&#x27;s style frequently in his &quot;Zippy the Pinhead&quot;.
* Cartoonist Scott McCloud developed a card game, 5-card Nancy, in which players use random panels of &quot;Nancy&quot; to create their own stories. McCloud also included a Nancy cameo in his book &quot;Understanding Comics&quot;. When describing the &quot;non-sequitur&quot; transition type, several unrelated images appear between panels. One is an upside-down picture of Nancy being struck by lightning with the caption &quot;Danger&quot;.
* Cartoonist Mark Newgarden has included Nancy in his work.
*&quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; cartoonist Stephan Pastis (known for using other comic characters in his strip) portrayed Nancy and Sluggo as extras to replace Rat and Goat during the 2003 &quot;Pearls Labor Dispute&quot;.
* &quot;Mad&quot; has run several parodies, including &quot;Nansy&quot;, in which Nancy is transformed into the main character of several other comic strips, including &quot;Donald Duck&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; and &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, all with that same hyphen-nose and frizzy hairdo. Also in &quot;Mad&quot;, Bushmiller gets the hardboiled treatment: &quot;If Mickey Spillane Wrote Nancy&quot;.
* Quino&#x27;s &quot;Mafalda&quot; bears a strong resemblance to the earlier &quot;Nancy&quot;, which Quino mocks in one strip, where Miguelito buys a Nancy magazine and shows it to Mafalda noticing the resemblance, only for Mafalda to retort (off-frame) that she looks more like his grandmother.
* Cartoonist Max Cannon often includes Stubbo, a boy drawn in Bushmiller&#x27;s style, in his &quot;Red Meat&quot; strip.
* German cartoon duo Katz &amp; Goldt (Stephan Katz and Max Goldt) appear as Sluggo and Nancy in their comics &quot;Homage to Ernie Bushmiller&quot; (2004) and &quot;Forty Million&quot; (2018)
* The daily comic Mutts by Patrick McDonnell includes as a recurring character a young girl named Bushy, who has the same hairstyle as Nancy. McDonnell&#x27;s panel art strongly resembles Bushmiller&#x27;s as well.

<doc id="888315" wikidata="Q7950372" url="?curid=888315" title="WHPR-FM">
<text>WHPR-FM (88.1 FM) is an Urban Oldies and Talk radio station based in Highland Park, Michigan, owned and operated by R. J.&#x27;s Late Night Entertainment Corporation.

==History==
The station was founded May 21, 1954 by the Highland Park School District; the studio and transmitter were located at Highland Park High School, with the facilities operated by high school students to provide educational radio broadcasting to the community.

When the high school relocated in 1977, the Wayne County Community College District took over the facility as well as the HPHS buildings. On December 20, 1994, the college closed down the campus, and the station was sold to R.J. Watkins, owner of local low-powered station W33BY (then on channel 68 as W68CH). Under Watkins, he reformulated the station as a local station that served the African-American community in the Highland Park area. Under Watkins, the station would relocate its studios and transmitters to its current facility at the corner of Victor and Brush Streets (near the intersection of Woodward Avenue and the Davison Freeway) in Highland Park.

==Violations==
WHPR-FM was admonished by the FCC in 2001 for running advertising contrary to its status as a &quot;Noncommercial Educational Station.&quot; In 2011, the station was fined $22,000 for numerous violations, including relocating its transmitter without FCC authorization, failure to keep a public file and not having any EAS equipment in use (the station&#x27;s EAS decoder was stored in a closet).

<text>Aerojet Rocketdyne is a subsidiary of American defense company L3Harris that manufactures rocket, hypersonic, and electric propulsive systems for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. Aerojet traces its origins to the General Tire and Rubber Company (later renamed GenCorp, Inc. as it diversified) established in 1915, while Rocketdyne was created as a division of North American Aviation in 1955. Aerojet Rocketdyne was formed in 2013 when Aerojet and Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne were merged, following the latter&#x27;s acquisition by GenCorp, Inc. from Pratt &amp; Whitney. Aerojet Rocketdyne was acquired by L3Harris in July 2023 for $4.7 billion.

== History ==
=== Background: Aerojet ===

Several decades after it began manufacturing rubber products, General Tire &amp; Rubber diversified into broadcasting and aeronautics.

In the 1940s, the Aerojet company began experimenting with various rocket designs. For a solid-fuel rocket, they needed binders, and turned to General Tire &amp; Rubber for assistance. General became a partner in the company.

Radio broadcasting began with the purchase of several radio networks starting in 1943. In 1952, its purchase of WOR-TV expanded the broadcast business into television. In 1953, General Tire &amp; Rubber bought the RKO Radio Pictures movie studio. All of its media and entertainment holdings were organized into the RKO General division.

Due to the studio and rocket businesses, General Tire &amp; Rubber came to own a great deal of property in California. Its internal facilities management unit began commercializing its operations, landing General Tire &amp; Rubber in the real estate business. This started when Aerojet-General Corporation acquired approximately of land in Eastern Sacramento County. Aerojet converted these former gold fields into one of the premier rocket manufacturing and testing facilities in the Western world. However, most of this land was used to provide safe buffer zones for Aerojet&#x27;s testing and manufacturing operations. Later, as the need for these facilities and safety zones decreased, the property became available for other uses. Located northeast of Sacramento along U.S. Highway 50, the properties were valuable, being in a key growth corridor in the region. Approximately of the Aerojet lands are now being planned as a community called Easton. Easton Development Company LLC was formed to assist in the process.

=== Background: Rocketdyne ===

In 1955, North American Aviation spun off Rocketdyne, a developer of rocket motors that built upon research conducted into the German V-2 Rocket after World War II. Rocketdyne would become a major supplier for NASA, producing the Rocketdyne F-1 engine for the Saturn V rocket of the Apollo Space Program as well as the RS-25 engine of the Space Shuttle program and its successor the Space Launch System (SLS) program. 

Aerojet Rocketdyne engines have contributed to every successful NASA Mars mission, including powering the launch, entry, descent, and landing phases of the Perseverance rover mission.

=== Name change ===

In 1984, General Tire created a parent holding company, GenCorp, Inc., for its various business ventures.

The main subsidiaries were:
* General Tire and Rubber
* RKO General, the broadcast arm of the conglomerate;
* DiversiTech General, a manufacturer of tennis balls and polymer products, including automotive soundproofing and home wallpapers.
* Aerojet General, a defense (missile) contractor.

Through its RKO General subsidiary, the company also held stakes in:
* Frontier Airlines.
* RKO bottlers, which operated Pepsi-Cola distributorships; and several resorts and hotels, including the Westward Look resort in Tucson, Arizona.

=== Disconglomeration ===
Faced with a hostile takeover attempt, among other difficulties, GenCorp, Inc. shed some of its long-held units in the late 1980s.

RKO General ran into difficulties with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) during license renewal proceedings in the late 1980s. The FCC was reluctant to renew the broadcast licenses, due to widespread lying to advertisers and regulators. As a result of the protracted proceedings, GenCorp sold RKO General&#x27;s broadcast properties beginning in 1987.

GenCorp, Inc. also sold its former flagship, General Tire, to German tire manufacturer Continental AG in order to concentrate on Aerojet.

In 1999, GenCorp, Inc. spun off its Decorative &amp; Building Products and Performance Chemicals businesses. GenCorp, Inc. formed OMNOVA Solutions Inc. into a separate, publicly traded company, and transferred those businesses into it.

GenCorp, Inc.&#x27;s two remaining businesses, as of 2008, were Aerojet and Easton Real Estate.

=== Pension problems and leadership changes ===
GenCorp, Inc. withdrew its over-funded pension during the real estate boom years of 2006 and 2007. The real estate bust caused an underfunding of the pension plan of over $300 million. This caused a freeze of its pension plan on February 1, 2009, and an end to 401(k) match on January 15, 2009. The move was expected to save the company 29 million a year.

In March 2008, hedge fund Steel Partners II, which owned 14% of GenCorp, Inc., made an agreement that saw Terry J. Hall step down as CEO and gave Steel Partners II control of three board seats plus the selection of the new CEO (who would also hold a board seat). Steel Partners II had previously attempted a hostile takeover in 2004, and forced the deal after complaining about &quot;significant underperformance and deterioration of share price&quot;. Aerojet President J. Scott Neish was named interim CEO.

In January 2010, Scott Seymour, the former head of Northrop Grumman Integrated Systems from 2002 to 2008, was appointed permanent CEO of GenCorp, Inc. and Neish resigned.

=== Aeronautics expansion ===

In July 2012, GenCorp, Inc. agreed to buy rocket engine producer Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne from United Technologies Corporation for $550 million. The FTC approved the deal on June 10, 2013, and it closed on June 17.
 GenCorp, Inc. was later renamed &quot;Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc&quot; on April 27, 2015.

=== Abandoned acquisition by Lockheed Martin ===
On December 20, 2020, it was announced that Lockheed Martin would acquire the company for $4.4 billion. The acquisition was expected to close in first quarter of 2022, but this received opposition from Raytheon Technologies. Later the FTC sued to block this deal on a 4–0 vote in January 2022 on grounds that this would eliminate the largest independent maker of rocket motors and Lockheed subsequently abandoned the deal in February 2022.

=== Acquisition by L3Harris ===
In December 2022, L3Harris Technologies agreed to buy the company for $4.7 billion in cash. The acquisition was completed in July 2023. L3Harris named former CTO Ross Niebergall as president of the new Aerojet Rocketdyne business segment, which would now be headquartered in Palm Bay, Florida.

== Products ==
=== Current engines ===
* RS-25 (LH2/LOX) – Previously known as the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME), it was the reusable main engine developed by Rocketdyne for the now-retired Space Shuttle. Remaining RS-25D engines are planned for use on early Space Launch System rocket launches after which an expendable version, RS-25E will be developed for follow-on SLS launches.
* RL10 (LH2/LOX) – Developed by Pratt &amp; Whitney and currently used on the Centaur upper stage for the Atlas V. It is also currently used on the Space Launch System on the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) and will be used on the Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) in the future. Formerly used on the upper stage for the Delta IV, the Centaur upper stage for Titan, the S-IV upper stage for the Saturn I, the vertical-landing McDonnell Douglas DC-X &quot;Delta Clipper&quot;. It was intended to serve as the main propulsion engine for the proposed Altair lunar lander. Two RL-10 engines are used on Centaur V upper stage of ULA Vulcan.
* R-4D (MMH/NTO) – 100 lbf (exact thrust depends on variant) hypergolic thruster, originally developed by Marquardt as RCS thrusters for the Apollo SM and LM. Currently used as secondary engines on the Orion European Service Module, and as apogee motors on various satellite buses.
* MR103G — 0.2 lb hydrazine monopropellant thruster
* MR111g — 1 lb hydrazine monopropellant thruster
* MR106L — 5-7 lb hydrazine monopropellant thruster
* MR107M — 45 lb hydrazine monopropellant thruster
* Blue Origin CCE (solid rocket motor or SRM) — the Blue Origin New Shepard Crew Capsule Escape Solid Rocket Motor is built by Aerojet Rocketdyne.

=== Former production engines and others ===

* Rocketdyne F-1 (RP-1/LOX) – The main engine of the first stage of the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program. The most powerful single combustion chamber liquid-propellant rocket engine ever developed.
* Rocketdyne J-2 (LH2/LOX) – Used on the upper stage of the Saturn IB and second and upper stages of Saturn V.
* SJ61 (JP-7/ingested air) – A dual-mode ramjet/scramjet engine flown on the Boeing X-51 hypersonic demonstration vehicle.
* AJ10 (Aerozine 50/N2O4) – Second stage engine for the Delta II, used as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engine for the Space Shuttle, and the main engine for the European Orion Service Module.
* AR1 (RP-1/LOX) – A proposed thrust RP-1/LOX oxidizer-rich staged combustion cycle engine.
* Rocketdyne H-1 (RP-1/LOX) – A first stage engine flown on the Saturn I and Saturn IB launch vehicles.
* RS-27 (RP-1/LOX) – A first stage engine flown on the Delta 2000 launch vehicle.
* RS-27A (RP-1/LOX) – A first stage engine flown on the Delta II and Delta III.
* RS-68 (LH2/LOX) – A first stage engine flown on the Delta IV, designed as a simplified version of the RS-25 due to its expendable usage. It is the largest hydrogen-fueled rocket engine ever flown.
*J-2X (LH2/LOX) – An engine that was originally being developed for the Ares I&#x27;s upper stage before the cancellation of the Constellation program. The engine was considered for the Space Launch System&#x27;s Exploration Upper Stage before being replaced with a cluster of four RL10s. It is based on the Rocketdyne J-2.
* Baby Bantam (RP-1/LOX) – An thrust engine. In June 2014, Aerojet Rocketdyne announced that they had &quot;manufactured and successfully tested an engine which had been entirely 3D printed&quot;.
* AJ-26 (RP-1/LOX) – Rebranded and modified NK-33 engines imported from Russia. Used as first stage engine for the Antares before being replaced by the RD-181.
* AJ-60A (Solid – HTPB) – A solid rocket motor formerly used for the Atlas V launch vehicle, until being replaced by the Northrop Grumman GEM-63 in 2021.
*AR-22 (LH2/LOX) – An engine in development from 2017 to 2020 for the XS-1 spacecraft, also known as the Phantom Express. The engine is based on the RS-25 and utilizing parts remaining in Aerojet Rocketdyne and NASA inventories from earlier versions of the RS-25. Two of the engines would have been built for the spaceplane. Boeing pulled out of the project in January 2020, effectively ending it.

=== In development ===

==== X3 ion thruster ====
On 13 October 2017, it was reported that Aerojet Rocketdyne completed a keystone demonstration on a new X3 ion thruster, which is a central part of the XR-100 system for the NextSTEP program. The X3 ion thruster was designed by the University of Michigan and is being developed in partnership with the University of Michigan, NASA, and the Air Force. The X3 is a Hall-effect thruster operating at over 100 kW of power. During the demonstration, it broke records for the maximum power output, thrust and operating current achieved by a Hall thruster to date. It operated at a range of power from 5 kW to 102 kW, with electric current of up to 260 amperes. It generated 5.4 newtons of thrust, &quot;which is the highest level of thrust achieved by any plasma thruster to date&quot;. A novelty in its design is that it incorporates three plasma channels, each a few centimeters deep, nested around one another in concentric rings. The system is and almost in diameter.

=== Other notable products ===

==== Multi-mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator ====
Aerojet Rocketdyne is the prime contractor to the US Department of Energy for the Multi-mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator. The first flight MMRTG is currently powering the Mars Curiosity Rover, and a second flight unit powers the Perseverance Rover.

<text>This is a list of governors of the [[Bahamas]]. The first English settlement in the Bahamas was on Eleuthera. In 1670, the king granted the Bahamas to the lords proprietors of the Province of Carolina, but the islands were left to themselves. The local pirates ruled a &quot;de facto&quot; &#x27;Privateers&#x27; Republic&#x27; for several years; in 1717 the Bahamas became a British crown colony, and the pirates were driven out.

During the American War of Independence, the Bahamas were briefly occupied by both American and Spanish forces. In 1964, the Bahamas achieved self-governance, and, in 1973, full independence.

<text>Operation Freshman was the codename given to a British airborne operation conducted in November 1942 during World War II. It was the first British airborne operation using Airspeed Horsa gliders, and its target was the Vemork &quot;Norsk Hydro&quot; hydrogen electrolysis plant in Telemark, Norway which produced heavy water as a by-product.

By 1942, the German nuclear weapons programme had come close to being able to develop a nuclear reactor, but for the reactor to function it would require a great deal of heavy water. The source of the heavy water was the Norsk Hydro plant, which had been occupied since 1940.
When the British government learned of the German nuclear developments, it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the heavy water required to develop a nuclear weapon. Several plans were discussed and discarded as impractical; it was decided that a small airborne force composed of sappers from the Royal Engineer units attached to 1st Airborne Division would land by glider, a short distance from the plant, demolish it with explosives and then escape over the Norwegian border into Sweden. After an extensive training period, the airborne force took off in two aircraft–glider combinations on the night of 19 November 1942. Both the gliders and tugs were operated by aircrews attached to HQ No. 38 Wing RAF.

The tugs and gliders managed to reach the Norwegian coast, but neither was able to reach their objective. The first pair suffered from navigational difficulties and severe weather, which resulted in the tow rope snapping and the first glider crash-landing, with its Halifax tug aircraft returning to base. Three airborne troops were killed and the survivors were captured shortly after the crash. The second pair fared even worse, with both the aircraft and glider crashing into a mountain after the aircraft flew low in search of the first glider. Both members of the glider crew were killed instantly, while one soldier passenger died soon afterwards from his injuries. Those who survived the crashes were captured by German forces and killed as a result of Wehrmacht&#x27;s Commando Order, which stated that any Allied personnel captured while involved in commando operations were to be killed immediately. At the end of the war, the Wehrmacht personnel involved were tried, sentenced to death and executed for their part in the murders.

==Background==
The German government began development of an atomic weapons programme after two scientists, Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch, declared in the February 11 1939 issue of the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; that atomic fission was possible and could release immense amounts of energy. By September 1941, the German scientists assigned to the programme had determined how a nuclear reactor could be developed. This required significant quantities of heavy water to act as a neutron moderator to encase the uranium which would be used to provide the material for a nuclear weapon. Heavy water was extremely scarce and difficult to produce, and Germany only possessed a small amount which had been produced in laboratories. Norway possessed a large stockpile which was produced by the Vemork &quot;Norsk Hydro&quot; chemical plant near the village of Rjukan, but the Norwegian government would not sell more than three gallons of heavy water a month, becoming suspicious of the sudden increase in demand for the water by the German government. When Norway was invaded and occupied by Germany in April 1940 this obstruction ended; the Vemork plant was captured and began producing heavy water for the German atomic weapons programme. Production of heavy water was slowed initially due to the effects of the fighting in Norway and a drought in the area, which led to a lack of water to provide hydroelectric power for the plant. Once the weather improved and snow began to melt, providing enough water to create sufficient hydroelectric power, production continued.

By mid-1942 it had come to the attention of the British government that the plant had begun to produce large quantities of heavy water and was stockpiling it for later use. The decision was therefore taken that the plant and the stockpiles of heavy water would have to be destroyed in order to impede the German programme. Several methods for destroying the plant were considered. The first was a mass raid by Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers, but this was rejected due to the difficulty in locating the plant during night bombing, the principal bombing tactic used by the RAF at the time, and the heavy casualties that would be inflicted on the local Norwegian population during a night raid. An attack by Norwegian saboteurs was also ruled out, as was landing troops by PBY Catalina flying boat on Lake Møsvatn, from the target, the latter due to the steepness of the surrounding mountain slopes and the inability of flying boats to land on the ice. It was decided that a raid by glider-borne airborne troops would have the greatest chance of success. The area around the plant would be difficult to land on, but a possible landing site for gliders was located near the Møsvatn dam, although it would require considerable skill on the part of the glider pilots in order to land safely.

==Preparations==

===Operation Grouse===
In March 1942 the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) had recruited Einar Skinnarland, a Norwegian engineer who worked at the Møsvatn dam. Skinnarland had successfully sailed to Britain and was parachuted back to Telemark after ten days of intensive training. Having several contacts within Vemork he was able to roughly identify the disposition of German troops and other defences. Additionally SOE decided to send an advance party of Norwegian agents into Telemark, and began intensively training a four-man team over the summer. The party, code-named Operation Grouse, was led by Jens-Anton Poulsson and also included Knut Haugland, Claus Helberg and Arne Kjelstrup. The Norwegians, all people local to the area with exceptional outdoors skills, underwent extra outdoor training in Scotland as well as learning the skills necessary to operate in occupied territory; including sabotage, radio transmitting and &quot;irregular warfare&quot;.

The Grouse team were ready to be inserted by October. Several flights were made but aborted due to bad weather, before the team finally dropped on 18 October. The team landed at Fjarefit on the Hardangervidda (a large wilderness avoided by the German forces) and spent the next 15 days trekking towards Møsvatn, where they made contact with Skinnarland&#x27;s brother, Torstein. Once they had established contact with London the party began making preparations for the arrival of the British commandos. A suitable glider landing site was chosen south west of Møsvatn dam and the team reconnoitred the area to help Combined Operations decide the best way to attack the plant.

====German defences====
The geography of the area around the village and the plant meant that attacking the plant and destroying the existing stocks of heavy water would be extremely difficult. Both were situated in a deep valley which possessed thickly–forested sides that rose almost vertically from a narrow river–bed, and which was overlooked by Gaustatoppen, a mountain approximately high; the plant itself had been built on a broad rock shelf above the river bed.

Einar Skinnarland had observed the German defences over the summer and passed the information back to SOE. Later reconnaissance by Torstein Skinnarland and the Grouse team was also transmitted to London in the weeks leading up to the operation. In early October Generaloberst Nikolaus von Falkenhorst, the commander in chief of the German forces in Norway, had visited the plant. While there he warned the local garrison that he believed the plant was a likely target for British commando raids, but crucially he did not have the resources to increase the manpower there. Although Einar Skinnarland had observed a garrison of 100 men in the village of Rjukan, 20 at the dam and about 55 near the main plant during the summer, by October this had been reduced to about 12 at the plant, 12 at the dam and approximately 40 in Rjukan. Most of the men were elderly or infirm Austrians under the command of an elderly captain, although well trained German regulars periodically passed through Telemark. Skinnarland also believed that Gestapo agents were in the area.

The Germans had erected three iron hawsers across the valley to prevent low flying bombing raids but on the ground most of their defences were positioned to prevent an assault from the ridge above the plant, the direction from which they believed an attack was most likely. Minefields and booby traps predominantly protected this side of the plant, but there were also searchlights on the roof and a machine gun nest near the entrance. A single bridge crossed the steep gorge in front of the plant, but was normally only protected by two guards. There were 300,000 German troops in Norway at this time and reinforcements could quickly be called into the area, which would complicate the commandos&#x27; escape to the Swedish border.

===Planning===
The Headquarters staff of Combined Operations at the War Office was tasked with devising a plan for the glider-borne assault on the plant, as it had been with previous airborne and commando operations, such as Operation Biting. This was the first British airborne operation ever to use gliders; all previous operations had been conducted solely with parachutists. The staff decided that although gliders would be the most suitable for the operation due to the heavy loads to be carried by the airborne troops, and the possibility that they could be widely dispersed if they were dropped by parachute, the airborne troops would still be trained for a possible parachute insertion if the landing zone for the gliders was found to be unsuitable. Because of the complicated and technical nature of the operation, which would see the plant rigged with explosives and then detonated, it was believed that a minimum of twelve to sixteen men was required, and that they would all have to be skilled engineers. The important nature of the operation also led to the force being doubled in order to duplicate it, to ensure that even if half of the force were killed, the survivors would have the necessary skills to complete the operation. The selected troops were volunteer parachutists chosen from the sappers of 9th Field Company (Airborne) Royal Engineers and 261st Field Park Company (Airborne) Royal Engineers attached to 1st Airborne Division, because the only parachute-trained Royal Engineers unit in existence at the time, 1st Parachute Squadron Royal Engineers, was already deployed in North Africa with 1st Parachute Brigade. Both of the duplicated units that were to participate in the operation were to be commanded by officers from the Royal Engineers; the first by Lieutenant A.C. Allen and the second by Second-Lieutenant M.D. Green, who was later replaced by Lieutenant D.A. Methven when he was injured during a training accident three days before the operation was to begin.

The Royal Air Force unit selected to transport the sappers was 38 Wing, which was commanded by Group Captain T.B. Cooper; it was provided with a special allotment of three Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers for the operation, which were the only British aircraft in existence at the time which were capable of towing Horsa gliders the distance required and then returning to their base. The SOE agents selected a landing zone for the sappers, which was approximately from the Norsk Hydro plant and could not be observed by German patrols. The plan for the operation called for the sappers to land in the two gliders at the landing zone, guided in by the SOE agents equipped with Eureka radio beacons. Once they had successfully landed, the sappers would be escorted to the plant by the SOE agents, demolish the plant and its stocks of heavy water, and then cross the Norwegian border into neutral Sweden.

Combined Operations initially suggested the men should fight their way to the Swedish border, but MI9 believed their chances of survival were better if they attempted to disguise themselves as Norwegians and travel in pairs. In order to facilitate their escape the men were provided with civilian clothes (to be worn after the operation), simple Norwegian phrases (in the hope no German they encountered would speak Norwegian) and escape sets containing money and maps. They were also ordered to shave any moustaches and grow their hair long in order to blend in with Norwegian men.

===Training===
Training began in early October in Wales and was designed to be extremely arduous, not only to ensure that those who took part were at the peak of their physical and mental fitness, but also to eliminate any men unable to cope with the long marches and difficult terrain that would be encountered during the operation. When this portion of the training had been completed, the sappers were then transferred to the area around Fort William in Scotland, where they were familiarised with a hydroelectric plant similar in design to the one in Norway, and received training on the most efficient way to plant explosives in the Norsk Hydro plant to cause maximum damage.

Training also took place at Port Sunlight, where they were shown how to destroy large condensers of the kind found in the plant. The sappers were given detailed briefings on the plant and the surrounding area, and were trained on large models and mock-ups of the buildings that the plant was composed of, all based on information provided by the SOE agents who had arrived earlier in the month. Because the operation was considered to be extremely important, and its results vital to the Allied war effort, security efforts were extremely thorough. A cover story was provided for the sappers as they conducted their training; a rumour was spread that they were training to compete against a company of American engineers in a fictional &#x27;Washington Cup&#x27; athletic event, which involved a long route march to be completed either by glider or parachute, followed by a complex demolition task and finally a demanding endurance test. The departure airfield was also sealed off to civilians and non-essential military personnel, and all mail and telephone calls were censored.

==Operation==
After their training had been completed, on 17 November the sappers were transported to RAF Skitten, Killimster in Scotland, with the operation scheduled to commence two days later. On the evening of 19 November, Group Captain Cooper, with the aid of a Norwegian meteorologist and regular reports from the SOE agents stationed near the landing zone, decided that although the weather was not perfect, it would be best to launch the operation that night; Cooper believed that if it were delayed, the weather might deteriorate on subsequent days and prevent the operation from being conducted entirely. The first aircraft–glider combination took off from the airfield at 17:50, with the second following at 18:10; after circling the airfield several times the two combinations headed out across the North Sea towards their objective.

===The first combination===
The first combination flew through poor weather conditions and managed to reach Norway and fly towards its objective. During the flight over Norway the Rebecca receiver, which was supposed to pick up the transponder signal from the Eureka beacons being used by the Norwegian SOE agents, developed a mechanical problem and was unable to pick up the signal. This left the aircrew with only map-reading available to locate the landing zone, but the poor weather made this almost impossible.

On a second attempt to find the correct area, the combination flew into thick clouds approximately northwest of Rjukan, and ice began to form on both aircraft and glider, as well as the towing rope connecting the two. At this point the combination began to lose altitude, and the towing rope snapped, setting the glider free; low on fuel, the aircraft was forced to turn back after signaling to Skitten at 23:55 that it had released the glider, and only just succeeded in landing back in Britain. Shortly after releasing the glider, the aircraft broadcast a second message, &quot;Glider in sea&quot;, indicating the air crew&#x27;s belief that the glider had crashed. The Royal Navy was asked to begin a search-and-rescue mission, but had no ships in the area; an aerial search of the area was instead conducted, but did not find the glider.

The glider crash-landed in an area called Fyljesdal, overlooking Lysefjord. Of the seventeen men on board, three were killed outright.

Thorvald Fylgjedalen, a local farmer, found some of the injured soldiers from the glider, but knew no English, and was unable to communicate with them. Nonetheless, Fylgjedalen and his neighbour Jonas Haaheller decided that they would assist the wounded soldiers, and did not contact the German authorities. After contacting more of the local residents, the soldiers asked for their assistance in escaping to Sweden, but Haaheller and others convinced them that this would be impossible, as it would involve travelling across the entirety of Norway. Thus, the Norwegians sheltered and gave medical attention to the injured soldiers, but did not allow any of them to leave. The Norwegians also burned all of the maps and documents from the glider crash before the Germans could arrive, and managed to keep the entire operation secret for almost twenty-four hours.

German soldiers, including troops from both the Waffen SS and the Army, arrived the next afternoon on two boats from a nearby camp. They took the British soldiers prisoner, and departed with them on the boats. Despite the grave injuries suffered by some of the soldiers, they were still forced to walk under their own power and ride in the unsheltered boats in the cold. The dead soldiers were buried in a shallow grave.

===The second combination===

The second combination managed to reach the coast of Norway, but fared even worse than the first combination; because of a turn in the weather, the tow aircraft (second Halifax) piloted by Flight Lieutenant Roland Parkinson, RCAF, released the glider and then crashed into a mountain at Hestadfjell in high winds, rain and hail. All of the aircrew were killed instantly. Workmen in the area heard the plane pass overhead shortly before crashing and alerted the German authorities, who arrived quickly. Finding no survivors, the Germans threw the bodies of the aircrew into a nearby bog and left the area.

Released just before the tow aircraft crashed, the second glider spiralled out of control and crash-landed in the mountains between Helleland and Bjerkreim. The two RAAF pilot and copilot of the glider, Norman Davies and Herbert Fraser, were killed instantly and the rest were injured to varying degrees, one of whom, 25 year old Driver Ernest Pendlebury, died soon after. The survivors were unwilling to leave the seriously wounded so two of the British soldiers left the crash site to search for help. After searching for some time, they arrived in the hamlet of Helleland about from where they had crashed, and made contact with one of the local residents, Trond Hovland. The soldiers told Hovland about their injured comrades, and asked if he could help them find a doctor. Hovland agreed to help, but informed them that the nearest doctor lived away, in the town of Egersund. In order to contact him, Hovland would have to use the telephone system, controlled by the German authorities, which would alert them to the presence of the soldiers. Believing that there was no alternative, the soldiers agreed to contact the Germans, expecting that they would be taken as prisoners of war. A party from the Norwegian Labour Service arrived at the crash site shortly afterwards and helped tend to the injured soldiers who burned all of their sensitive documents and materials. A German party arrived about twenty minutes later. Unwilling to abandon the wounded and doubting their chances of escaping to Sweden, Lieutenant Allen chose to surrender, believing that they would be treated as POWs. Underneath their uniforms, the soldiers wore civilian clothing and had been told to grow their hair and beards. With this, and the fact that sabotage equipment was found, Colonel Probst, the head of the Wehrmacht in the Stavanger district, had all survivors executed as partisans at the German camp at Slettebø near Egersund.

==Aftermath==
The Allies were unaware of the fate of the operation until they intercepted a German communiqué stating that two gliders and one aircraft had been forced down, and the crews engaged and annihilated. On 11 December they received a message from an SOE agent explaining that the second glider&#x27;s occupants had all been shot. Many of the details about the fate of the two glider combinations were only discovered after the war had ended.

None of the soldiers or aircrew who survived the crashes remained alive for very long. Of the soldiers from the first glider, three of the four injured men were tortured by the Gestapo and later killed by Stabsarzt [Dr] Werner Fritz Seeling who injected air into their bloodstreams. The fourth injured man was shot in the back of the head the next day. All four bodies were dumped at sea. The five uninjured men were held at Grini concentration camp until 18 January 1943, when they were taken to nearby woods, blindfolded and executed by the Gestapo. The German Wehrmacht and the Gestapo argued over the fate of the prisoners from the second glider. The Wehrmacht believed they should be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention, but in the end the survivors were interrogated and executed within a few hours of their capture at the German barracks at Bekkebø. They were taken into nearby woods and shot one by one, each being forced to listen to the man before him being executed. Their bodies were stripped and thrown into an unmarked grave. All of the executions were conducted in accordance with the Commando Order issued by the Wehrmacht High Command in October 1942, which stated that all Allied commando troops were to be killed immediately upon capture. The local Norwegian population were unable to prevent the prisoners being executed, but tended the graves of the dead until the end of the war.

Although the Allied soldiers believed that they had burnt all of their maps, one from the second glider was missed. When the Germans found it they were able to identify the Vemork plant as the target and increased their defence accordingly. German reprisals started instantly and 200 armed Gestapo agents swept into Rjukan where they arrested 21 Norwegians for questioning, but the members of &quot;Operation Grouse&quot; slipped away into the wilderness of Hardangervidda. They later contributed to the successful Operation Gunnerside in February 1943, when a small team of Norwegian SOE agents were parachuted into the area and destroyed much of the heavy water equipment in Vemork plant. The plant eventually resumed operation, but further bombing raids ensured it produced little heavy water for the German atomic weapons programme.

Although the operation had been a failure, it demonstrated the range, flexibility and possibilities of airborne forces and glider operations, and also highlighted equipment failures that were rectified for later operations. This included developing a new version of the Rebecca-Eureka homing device system, the Mk II, which was ready by 1943 and proved to be very successful when used in later airborne operations; during Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity, aircraft that used the system reported a 95% success rate.
When 1st Airborne Division arrived in Norway in May 1945, they were informed of the fate of the prisoners, and cooperated with the Norwegian government to have the men buried with full military honours. The five from the first glider were re-interred at the Commonwealth War Graves plot at Vestre Gravlund near Oslo. The second glider&#x27;s occupants were reburied at Eiganes churchyard in Stavanger and the Halifax aircrew were reburied at Helleland.

The head of the Gestapo in Oslo, who had signed the order for the prisoners&#x27; executions, killed himself several days prior to 1st Airborne Division&#x27;s arrival in May 1945, but several Wehrmacht personnel implicated in the decision to execute the prisoners were put on trial and found guilty: Dr Seeling was shot 10 January 1946 at Akershus Prison, Oslo; Hauptscharführer Erich Hoffman was hanged 15 May 1946 in Hameln, Germany; whilst Unterscharführer Fritz Feuerlein who had shot a prisoner in the back of the head was sentenced to life imprisonment but was extradited to the Soviet Union for alleged abuse conducted against Soviet prisoners. The commander of the German forces in Norway – Generaloberst Nikolaus von Falkenhorst – was also found guilty of two of the Freshman deaths during his war crimes trial. Sven Hedin intervened on his behalf on 4 December 1946, with the argument that von Falkenhorst had likewise striven to pardon the ten Norwegians condemned to death. The sentence was later commuted to twenty years&#x27; imprisonment. Falkenhorst was released from Werl Prison on 23 July 1953, due to bad health and died in 1968.

<text>Triggerfish Twist is a 2002 crime novel by Tim Dorsey, the fourth in his series featuring Serge A. Storms.

==Plot summary==
Jim Davenport is transferred to his company&#x27;s branch in Tampa, Florida. He and his wife Martha are initially excited by the move and the beauty of their new neighborhood on Triggerfish Lane, but the reality proves to be disturbing: the Davenports&#x27; neighbors are a strange bunch of eccentrics, and crime is much worse than they had thought. These neighbors eventually include brutal-but-charismatic criminal Serge Storms, spiteful cocaine-addicted stripper Sharon Rhodes, and drug addict Seymour &quot;Coleman&quot; Bunsen, who move into the rental home across from the Davenports after Sharon and Coleman&#x27;s brainless antics accidentally burn down Serge&#x27;s home.

Jim&#x27;s troubles begin while he is waiting in a bank drive-through, when an armed robber mistakes Jim&#x27;s Suburban for his getaway vehicle and jumps in, threatening Jim and his infant daughter with a gun. Jim manages to overpower the robber, breaking his neck when a faulty airbag inflates in his face. Jim does not know that the robber was the youngest of five brothers, and the remaining four are released from prison on a technicality and begin looking for revenge. FDLE Agent Mahoney, obsessed with capturing Serge, convinces his boss to let him travel to Tampa, ostensibly to warn Jim.

When Jim returns to work, his consulting employer is acquired by a different company, which alters its corporate policy to make Jim the primary scapegoat for corporate layoffs. Jim is unable to adjust to his new role and is eventually fired.

Serge, despite his criminal lifestyle, develops a great liking and admiration for Jim, even considering proposing marriage to Sharon to emulate Jim&#x27;s success as a family man. Jim likes Serge as well, but Martha senses something strange about Serge and orders him to stay away.

At least three subplots intertwine with and lead up to the novel&#x27;s climax:
*While browsing the library at the University of Tampa, Serge is mistaken for a professor, and his impromptu lectures on Florida history and culture become so popular among the student body that the Dean asks Serge to deliver the commencement address.
*John Milton, a substitute teacher turned bank teller turned car salesman, is fired from his last job and decides to take revenge on Jim, the person assigned official blame for his firing from the bank. 
*Ambrose Tarrington III, a bankrupt former millionaire, lives in a small house on Triggerfish Lane, but mimics the attitude of wealth so well that he is constantly treated to test drives of luxury cars, free lunches from eager bank executives, and the use of mansions being offered for sale. Mistaking Ambrose&#x27;s act for reality, Serge kidnaps him for ransom.

Events come to a head at the Davenports&#x27; Fourth of July costume party, which includes the four criminal McGraw brothers taking the party hostage and Serge and Mahoney reluctantly teaming up to save the guests. Jim, normally passive to a fault, is driven to defend his family by snatching a gun and shooting two of the brothers.

The novel ends with the principal characters being featured on an episode of the Bill Maher show, which Serge (on the run from the police and still pursuing the $5 million briefcase featured in &quot;Florida Roadkill&quot;) calls into to express his sincere admiration for men with wives and children, declaring it a tougher job than anything Serge has had to cope with.

== Continuity ==
*The book takes place in the summer of 1997, somewhere in the midst of the events of &quot;Florida Roadkill&quot;; at the end of that novel, both Coleman and Sharon are dead.
*Several characters from &quot;Triggerfish Twist&quot;, including the Davenports, reappear in &quot;Atomic Lobster&quot;, taking place approximately ten years later.

<doc id="888336" wikidata="Q1468857" url="?curid=888336" title="Stitch! The Movie">
<text>Stitch! The Movie is a 2003 American direct-to-video animated science fiction comedy film produced by Walt Disney Television Animation and Rough Draft Korea, released on August 26, 2003. It is produced by Tony Craig, Jess Winfield, and Roberts &quot;Bobs&quot; Gannaway; Gannaway also co-wrote and co-directed with Winfield and Craig, respectively. It is the second film released in the &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; franchise and the third film chronologically, taking place after the 2002 first film and (by later extension) the 2005 direct-to-video sequel &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch&quot;. The film also serves as the backdoor pilot of the spin-off sequel series &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;, which Craig, Winfield, and Gannaway executive produced and debuted the following month. The story is an introduction to Dr. Jumba Jookiba&#x27;s 625 experiments (made prior to Stitch) that he created with the financing of Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel.

== Plot ==
Stitch has been trying to adapt to life with Lilo in Hawaii, but has a hard time fitting in without causing more disasters. Lilo tries to encourage him by saying he&#x27;s one-of-a-kind, which just makes him feel worse, as he desires others who he could consider his &quot;cousins&quot;. Meanwhile, ex-captain Gantu is hired by Jumba&#x27;s former partner, a diminutive creature resembling a cross between a hamster, gerbil, and rabbit named Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel to retrieve the other 625 experiments. Gantu goes to Earth and abducts Jumba, finding and taking a blue pod with the number 625 on it; Stitch and Lilo take Jumba&#x27;s spaceship and engage Gantu in battle, only to be defeated and fall back to Earth.

Back at their house, Lilo, Stitch, and Pleakley find the container Jumba was hiding. Pleakley realizes that it contains the other 625 experiments, in dehydrated pods, and warns them not to tell anyone or put the experiments in water, aware of how dangerous they are. Deliberately disobeying his orders, Stitch and Lilo retrieve the container and hydrate one of the experiments, the electricity-based Experiment 221, who promptly escapes into the night. Jumba is being held captive on the ship of Dr. Hämsterviel, who demands the experiments handed over to him believing they&#x27;re his. Unable to intimidate Jumba, Hämsterviel activates Experiment 625 to attack him. However, despite 625 having all of Stitch&#x27;s powers, he is incredibly lazy and a terrible coward, prioritizing making sandwiches above all else. Meanwhile, Pleakley is able to make contact with Hämsterviel&#x27;s ship via telephone, who proceeds to demand a ransom of the other 624 experiments in return for Jumba. Nani calls Cobra Bubbles to seek his assistance while Lilo and Stitch go out to find 221. They manage to track down 221 at a nearby hotel and successfully catch him with a glass vase; Stitch soon befriends him, realizing he&#x27;s finally found a &quot;cousin&quot; of his own.

The rendezvous time arrives and Pleakley and Cobra show up to trade the container for Jumba, but Hämsterviel is annoyed to find one is missing. Lilo and Stitch soon arrive with 221, announced she has named it &quot;Sparky&quot;, and declares that it and all the experiments are a part of their &quot;ohana&quot;. They set Sparky free and break Jumba from his bonds, just as Cobra signals the Grand Councilwoman&#x27;s ship to rise out of the nearby ocean to blast Hämsterviel. Lilo protests, since he still has the other experiments, so Sparky uses his electrical abilities to disrupt the power on the ship, allowing Hämsterviel and Gantu to escape on their ship with the experiments, as Lilo, Stitch, and Sparky stow away.

Inside the ship, Lilo and Stitch manage to swipe the container and in the ensuing struggle, it ends up releasing the dehydrated pods, which rain down and scatter all throughout Hawaii. Having captured the two, Hämsterviel reveals his plans to clone Stitch a thousand times over, as he&#x27;s strapped to a weight just heavier he can lift, while Gantu puts Lilo in a teleportation pod to send her to an intergalactic zoo. Before Stitch is vivisected by a laser for the cloning process, Sparky short-circuits the cloning machine, breaking him free, allowing the two to strap Hämsterviel to the device before they rescue Lilo.

Lilo, Stitch, and Sparky then short-circuit Gantu&#x27;s ship, causing it to crash near a waterfall on Kauai. Landing Hämsterviel&#x27;s ship back at the rendezvous point, they give Sparky a new home powering the Kīlauea Lighthouse, which hasn&#x27;t been running in years. They then persuade the Grand Councilwoman to let them rehabilitate the other 623 experiments. The Councilwoman places Hämsterviel under arrest, and grants Lilo and Stitch the task of tracking down the other experiments. At that moment, Experiments 202, 529, 455, 489, and 390 are activated by various means, and Lilo and Stitch drive off in Jumba&#x27;s dune buggy, beginning the events of the series.

After the credits, Jumba and Pleakley hope to go home with the Grand Councilwoman this time, but they are left stranded on Earth once again.

==Production==
Presented by Walt Disney Pictures and produced by Walt Disney Television Animation, &quot;Stitch! The Movie&quot; is the lead-in to &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;.

At some point, there was a decision to only have Stitch&#x27;s name in the titles of both the film and the subsequent series, which was planned to be called &quot;Stitch! The TV Series&quot;. Eventually, this was abolished, resulting in both this film and &quot;The Series&quot; having mismatched names. The &quot;Stitch!&quot; name (with exclamation point) was used as the title for an anime series five years after this film&#x27;s release.

==Critical reception==
In a 2019 list of direct-to-video sequels, prequels, and &quot;mid-quels&quot; to Disney animated films, Petrana Radulovic of &quot;Polygon&quot; ranked &quot;Stitch! The Movie&quot; tenth out of twenty-six films, the lowest of the &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; sequel films on her list. Radulovic wrote that she liked the message of Stitch finding his family, but criticized it for not being as funny as the original &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; film, stating that &quot;some of the [mundane] charm of &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;[...]is lost in favor of chasing a new alien [Sparky] and introducing the rabbitlike villain [Hämsterviel] who just wants world domination.&quot;

In a similar list in 2020, Lisa Wehrstedt of &quot;Insider&quot; ranked &quot;Stitch! The Movie&quot; seventeenth out of twenty-five films, which was also the lowest of the &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; sequels on her list. Wehrstedt wrote that she believed the film&#x27;s premise did not warrant a full feature film, and its finale was too &quot;open-ended&quot; to have &quot;Stitch! The Movie&quot; &quot;work as a stand-alone film like the rest of the &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; sequels.&quot; However, she nonetheless claimed that &quot;everything in the &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; world has an irresistible charm that propels it up many ranks considering what its plot and animation quality would be able to achieve without a bunch of cute little monsters.&quot;

At the 31st Annie Awards, &quot;Stitch! The Movie&quot; was nominated for the Annie Award for Best Animated Home Entertainment Production but lost to &quot;The Animatrix&quot;.

<text>The Dixie Network was a commercial radio broadcasting network operating in Tennessee and Mississippi beginning in 1946 and ending in December 1973. Three of the six AM stations had the letters &quot;DX&quot; within their call signs, such as WDXI in Jackson, Tennessee, WDXE-AM-FM, Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, and WDXN, Clarksville, Tennessee. These letters gave rise to usage of the term &quot;Dixie Stations&quot;.

==History==
Headquartered in Jackson, Tennessee, the stations were incorporated as separate corporations, each one founded by Aaron B. Robinson, Sr., principal owner and chief executive officer. The stations were: WCMA, Corinth, Mississippi, 1946; WENK, Union City, Tennessee, 1947; WDXI, Jackson, Tennessee, 1948; WDXE, Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, 1951; WTPR, Paris, Tennessee, 1951; WDXL, Lexington, Tennessee, 1954; WDXN, Clarksville, Tennessee, 1954; and WDXI-TV, Jackson, Tennessee, 1955. WDXL had been built in 1954 using equipment acquired when Robinson bought and shut down Jackson station WPLI the year prior; it was sold off the following year.

Dixie Network stations were known for a high degree of professionalism for small market operations. Always focused on local news and local community events, the stations and their personnel were known and respected for civic awareness and contributions.

Mr. Robinson, 55 years of age, died unexpectedly in December 1961. Under his will and testament, Robinson Enterprises, including the Dixie Network, were administered by the Trust Department of the former National Bank of Commerce in Jackson. J. Kenneth (Ken) Marston, manager of WDXE, was chosen by stockholders and National Bank of Commerce to assume general management of the Dixie Network beginning January 1962. WDXI-TV was sold to Bahakel Broadcasting Corporation of Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1966. The call sign became WBBJ-TV at that time.

In addition to community service by the respective stations management was known for participation in radio industry efforts beyond their station responsibilities.
John E. Bell, manager, WCMA, Corinth, Mississippi served as President of the Mississippi Broadcast Association. J. Kenneth Marston, Sr. served as President of the Tennessee Association of Broadcasters. Still later, WDXI manager Charles R. Simms, served as President of the Tennessee Association of Broadcasters. Marston also was elected to the National Association of Broadcasters board of directors in 1970 Edward B. Fritts, who began his broadcast career at WENK, Union City, Tennessee, was elected President of The National Association of Broadcasters, Washington, D.C., where he led the national trade association with distinction.

Some station programming included &quot;Dateline Dixie, news of the South for those in the South&quot;. T.N.T, temperature news and time with the outcue for many events including remotes broadcasts was &quot;This is Dixie&quot;. The stations signed on by playing &quot;Dixie&quot;.

The Dixie Network was wound down in the early 1970s; each station was sold under favorable conditions and concluded by close of business on December 31, 1973. At that time, Ken Marston was chosen by Tennessee radio and television broadcasters to transition the Tennessee Association of Broadcasters into a full-time trade association and establish its office and operations in Nashville. TAB had previously been an outgrowth of the University of Tennessee Knoxville.

<text>The Royal Earlswood Hospital, formerly The Asylum for Idiots and The Royal Earlswood Institution for Mental Defectives, in Redhill, Surrey, was the first establishment to cater specifically for people with developmental disabilities. Previously they had been housed either in asylums for the mentally ill or in workhouses.

== History ==

In 1847, Ann Serena Plumbe took an interest in the plight of those with neurodevelopmental disabilities, or &quot;idiots&quot; as they were termed at the time, and began to discuss what could be done to assist them. In discussion with Dr John Conolly (of the Hanwell Asylum) and Rev Dr Andrew Reed (a philanthropist and founder of several orphanages) they determined to educate such people. Reed toured Europe to gather information on institutions serving the purpose and in October the project to found The Asylum for Idiots, as it was originally called, began with the appointment of a board of management.

A property known as Park House in Highgate was purchased in March 1848 and the first patients were admitted in April 1848, including a 13 year-old Andrew Reed Plumbe. The building quickly proved too small, so in 1850 an 155-acre site was purchased at Earlswood Common, near Redhill, and a public appeal launched to raise funds for the building of a model &#x27;Asylum for Idiots&#x27; to house 400 residents. Queen Victoria subscribed 250 guineas in the name of the Prince of Wales who became a life member. The hospital was designed by William Bonython Moffat and built by John Jay. Prince Albert took a special interest from the beginning. He laid the foundation stone in June 1853 and opened the Asylum in June 1855. In 1862 Queen Victoria conferred a Royal charter on the asylum. One notable inmate in the early years of the asylum was artist James Henry Pullen (1835–1916).

John Langdon Down (after whom Down&#x27;s syndrome – known in the US as Down syndrome – was named) was medical superintendent of the hospital from 1855 to 1868. At this time patients slept in fifteen-bed dormitories and there was one member of staff to each seven patients. Tuberculosis accounted for the majority of deaths in the institution. Two new wings were completed in 1873. Andrew remained at Earlswood until his death in 1881, aged 45.

The asylum was renamed The Royal Earlswood Institution for Mental Defectives in June 1926. Nerissa and Katherine Bowes-Lyon, who were nieces of the Queen Mother and first cousins of the Queen, were placed in the hospital in 1941. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948.

Following the introduction of Care in the Community, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in March 1997. The site was redeveloped for residential use and is now known as Royal Earlswood Park.

A number of the buildings are listed: these include the main building, the workshop and the gate lodges.

==The Royal Earlswood Museum==
The Royal Earlswood Museum was located at the Belfry Shopping Centre nearby in Redhill. It illustrated the history and development of the asylum and contained works by former inmate, James Henry Pullen. The museum is now closed and in 2012 its collections and artefacts were donated to the Langdon Down Museum of Learning Disability in Teddington, Richmond upon Thames. The museum&#x27;s archives are located in the Surrey History Centre in Woking.

<doc id="888341" wikidata="Q5461573" url="?curid=888341" title="Florida Roadkill">
<text>Florida Roadkill is a black comedy crime novel by Tim Dorsey, the first in his series centered around the character Serge A. Storms. It was published in 1999 by William Morrow and Company, an imprint of HarperCollins.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Roadkill&quot; is set in 1997, against the backdrop of that year&#x27;s World Series in which the Florida Marlins won a stunning upset in Miami, Florida.

The book begins &quot;in media res&quot;, with the discovery of three corpses in South Florida, whose murders are eventually described as the book reveals the events preceding them, starting 11 months before the World Series.

== Synopsis ==
Intelligent but sociopathic criminal Serge Storms meets up with heartless stripper Sharon Rhodes and brainless drug addict Seymore &quot;Coleman&quot; Bunsen, who become his travelling companions and partners in crime. After one of Sharon&#x27;s customers, an oversexed orthodontist named George Veale, brags that his hands are insured for $5 million, Serge hatches a plan to defraud the insurance company and steal the entire settlement from Veale. The injury inflicted on Veale&#x27;s hand (by a chainsaw) is grisly enough to convince the insurance company to pay out, but Veale panics, withdraws the entire amount from the bank, and hides the suitcase containing the cash in the trunk of a rental car being driven by two vacationing friends, Sean and David. Before Veale can retrieve the case, he is kidnapped by Serge and Co., who tie him up in a Cape Canaveral motel and kill him with an elaborate Rube Goldberg-type booby trap triggered by the vibrations of the nearby launch of the Space Shuttle Columbia.

Further complications arise when it is revealed that the insurance company is actually bankrupt of legitimate earnings, and the money paid to Veale was earmarked for delivery to a minor cocaine cartel. In a panic, the CEO of the company, Charles Saffron, details a private investigator and a series of bounty hunters to track down the suitcase, while himself evading a squad of enforcers sent by the cartel.

As they close in on the money, and already weary of the other&#x27;s company, Serge and Sharon each separately decide to kill the other. Serge ambushes Sharon first, suffocating her by spraying liquid tire sealant down her throat. Later, the enforcers storm Serge and Coleman&#x27;s hotel room in Key West, killing Coleman but missing Serge, who kills two of the three enforcers and escapes with a non-lethal gunshot wound. The last enforcer is killed by detective Susan Tchoupitoulas, who has been tracking Serge and Coleman. When Susan confronts Serge in the hotel&#x27;s lobby, he recognizes her as the daughter of a Hillsborough County Sheriff&#x27;s deputy whose life he saved thirteen years ago. Serge discards his own gun and walks out of the lobby, wagering (correctly) that Susan will not shoot an unarmed man.

A comic subplot deals with three bikeless bikers — Stinky, Ringworm and Cheese-Dick — who have been rejected from every biker group they have encountered and are on the down and out. They find an odd sort of niche as hired muscle in a retirement community, but are ultimately forced out by the community&#x27;s owner, who wants the seniors kept as miserable as possible to extort money from them. The three bikers spend several days aboard a yacht on loan from the owner, but are marooned as soon as they have exhausted the engine&#x27;s fuel (having no grasp of sailing or marine navigation). Stinky accidentally shoots Cheese-Dick with a flare gun while rummaging through the yacht&#x27;s emergency gear, and a short while later, Ringworm and Stinky are both abducted by another boater, who ties them to cinder blocks and drowns them at sea.

A second, more serious subplot follows Sean and David, unaware of the $5 million in the trunk of their car, on their unsuccessful fishing trip to Key West, which includes stopping in Miami to watch the final game of the World Series. Saffron, believing he has finally found the drug money, follows them on their sight-seeing trip to Fort Jefferson, but all three of them are abducted by the same boater, who turns out to be Max Minimum, the disgraced manager of the retirement community, and secretly a perverted serial killer. Minimum pushes Saffron and Sean overboard, but David overpowers him with a head butt, causing Minimum to choke to death on the Barbie doll he had wedged in his mouth. Saffron drowns, but David deliberately tips himself and his cinder block overboard, managing to save both Sean and himself. After they return to Key West, Susan takes their statements, then treats them to dinner, where she and David develop an attraction to each other. They drive home, still unaware that the $5 million is concealed in the trunk of their car, or that Serge is still feverishly searching the county for them.

=== Johnny Vegas ===
Several of Dorsey&#x27;s novels feature one or more failed attempts by his recurring character, Johnny Vegas, to finally lose his virginity. In this novel, Johnny regularly trolls the seaside parties of South Beach in a Cigarette boat whose colors mislead spectators into thinking it belongs to Dan Marino:
*Johnny lures a young college student onto his boat and is close to having sex with her, when she sees a bloated corpse float up with a chain around his neck (later revealed to be that of either Stinky or Ringworm);
*While Serge, Coleman and Sharon are touring South Beach, Sharon hitches a ride on Johnny&#x27;s boat, and offers to have sex with him, but they are interrupted when a miniature caiman, that Serge bought at a gift shop and Coleman mistakenly placed in their hotel&#x27;s freezer, thaws out and bites her ankle ferociously. She blames Johnny for the snafu and re-joins Serge and Coleman.

== Continuity ==
*A number of minor characters (such as Bradley Xeno, the boat captain, and McJagger, the retirement community operator) make minor appearances in the following book, &quot;Hammerhead Ranch Motel&quot;, which also features a passing reference to Stinky, Cheese-Dick and Ringworm.
*Dorsey&#x27;s later novel &quot;Triggerfish Twist&quot; was published three years later, but the events of that novel take place at some unspecified point during the events of &quot;Florida Roadkill&quot; (as Dorsey&#x27;s web site puts it, he didn&#x27;t know what he was doing and killed too many characters he later decided he needed).

<doc id="888344" wikidata="Q3823481" url="?curid=888344" title="The Passion of New Eve">
<text>The Passion of New Eve is a novel by Angela Carter, first published in 1977. The book is set in a dystopian United States where civil war has broken out between different political, racial and gendered groups. A dark satire, the book parodies primitive notions of gender, sexual difference and identity from a post-feminist perspective. Other major themes include sadomasochism and the politics of power. Carter described the book as feminist black comedy.

==Background==
Carter began work on &quot;The Passion of New Eve&quot; in January 1972, inspired in part by the Greek myth of Tiresias, who was turned into a woman as a punishment from the goddess Hera. Originally, the book had the title &quot;The Great Hermaphrodite&quot; and was set in ancient Rome; she later moved the setting to a post-apocalyptic United States.

==Plot summary==

At the start of the novel, Evelyn, a male English professor, is taking up a new post in a university in New York. His tribute to Tristessa de St Ange, a (fictional) American silent movie star, on his last night in England is to be given fellatio by a girl he takes to see one of her films.

He arrives in a dystopian New York, a city in its last stages of rotting death, overrun by huge rats and human emotions distilled to their most primeval. The job that he has been offered at a university falls through after the school is taken over by a militant black rebel group. He is then left destitute in the middle of New York with very little money and no job. Evelyn then befriends a Czech neighbour, Baroslav, who is an alchemist. Baroslav is killed by a group of men in the city and Evelyn is then left alone. On a late night run to the local drug store he meets Leilah. He becomes fascinated with Leilah, an exotic young African-American night club dancer, and he follows her home through the city. He lives with her and they have a short sexual relationship where he frequently abuses her. He makes no emotional link, seeing her only in terms of sex. He writes to his parents and finds out that he is left a lot of money from a recently deceased relative. He becomes repelled by Leilah after he impregnated her, and he then abandons her to a voodoo abortionist. The abortion goes wrong and Leilah is put in hospital. Evelyn is expected to pay a large fee for Leilah&#x27;s hospital bills, but only plans on using some of the money. The rest Leilah gets from selling her fur coats. After Evelyn withdraws the money to pay for the bill, he is mugged and beaten by a group of young men. At the last moment, they are scared away before they can find the wad of cash Evelyn has taped under his genitals. He sends Leilah red roses, then rents a bulletproof car and heads straight to the desert, leaving everything behind including Leilah.

Evelyn seeks out the clean, clear desert and is captured by a woman from the subterranean female city of Beulah and dragged across the sandscape to encounter Mother, a mother goddess figure who fashioned herself with the surgeon&#x27;s knife. She operates on Evelyn, removing his genitals and implants a fully functioning vagina and ovaries, as well as giving him breast augmentation surgery. She plans on impregnating him with a new Messiah, using his own sperm that she harvested from him before the operation. The transformation from male to female seems to be absolute, despite the fact that Eve struggles to learn to become the woman that her body is, and from this point on she is referred to only in female pronouns.

Eve escapes but is captured, raped, and enslaved by Zero, a cruel male cult leader and &quot;poet&quot; with only one eye and one leg. His harem are all passive, slavish &quot;wives&quot; who he whips unless they talk in grunts and honour their bedfellows, the pigs. Zero leads Eve on a search for the silent film star Tristessa, an embodiment of beauty, sorrow, and loneliness, whom he hates obsessively, because he believes Tristessa has made him infertile. Tristessa was Evelyn&#x27;s first object of desire in his boyhood, and Eve still has her own obsession with this figure.

Zero leads his dungaree-clad harem to the glass palace of Tristessa and invades the beautiful gothic pile, discovering Tristessa herself laid out in a room surrounded by waxwork effigies in coffins. However she is alive and only when Zero tracks her down to the top of one of the towers and cuts her thong do the gang discover that Tristessa is male.

Upon discovering this, Zero and his wives create a mock-up wedding ceremony and marry the two, forcing Tristessa to rape Eve. Eve and Tristessa escape, killing Zero and his harem with Tristessa&#x27;s spinning glass palace. They escape back into the desert where they imbibe each other&#x27;s newly discovered sexuality and fall in love through their realisation that they are Tiresias. Tristessa is shot by a passing band of soldiers. Their Colonel is 14 years old and scared of the dark. They &quot;rescue&quot; Eve, but she escapes and encounters Leilah in a new guise of Lilith, vagabond rebel leader.

Lilith takes Eve to the coast to meet with Mother again, here they see a crazy old lady on a beach—a manifestation of ageing superficiality: dirty, caked in make-up, with piled high golden locks, singing old musical songs and living on vodka and cold tinned food and defecating in the bushes behind her deck chair.

Eve realises that Leilah never objectively existed but was only a manifestation of his own lusts and corruption.

Lilith tells Eve she must go and meet The Mother and pushes her into a cleft in the rocks that metamorphoses into the uterus of time. Eve progresses through the increasingly deep and warm subterranean rock pools to her rebirth. The amber Eve discovers in one of the caves and holds in her hands liquifies into ancient pine forests and primeval species.

Eve is then symbolically reborn, guided by Leilah, and rejects her chauvinistic male past.

Eve emerges onto a beach by Lilith, who leaves her to go back and fight with her rebels, saying Eve cannot join her because she is pregnant. Eve swaps the gold alchemical on a neck chain that Lilith has given her for the purple skiff belonging to the crazed old woman and takes the boat and sails away.

<text>Southeast Europe or Southeastern Europe is a geographical sub-region of Europe, consisting primarily of the region of the Balkans, as well as adjacent regions and archipelagos. There are overlapping and conflicting definitions of the region, due to political, economic, historical, cultural, and geographical considerations.

Sovereign states and territories that may be included in the region are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia (alternatively placed in Central Europe), Greece (alternatively placed in the broader region of Southern Europe), Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania (alternatively placed in Eastern Europe), Serbia, and the European part of Turkey (alternatively placed in the broader region of Southern Europe, also in Western Asia with the rest of the country). Sometimes, Cyprus (most often placed in West Asia), Hungary (most often placed in Central Europe), Moldova (most often placed in Eastern Europe), and Slovenia (most often placed in Central Europe) are also included due to cultural or historical factors and affiliation.

The largest cities of the region are Istanbul, Athens, Bucharest, Sofia, and Belgrade.

==Definition==
The first known use of the term &quot;Southeast Europe&quot; was by Austrian researcher Johann Georg von Hahn (1811–1869) as a broader term than the traditional Balkans, a concept based on the boundaries of the Balkan Peninsula. Countries described in 2004 by &quot;Istituto Geografico De Agostini&quot; as being entirely within the Balkan region, are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Montenegro, and North Macedonia.

However from the 1990s onwards, in part due to the negative historical and political connotations of the term &quot;Balkans&quot;, (especially since the military conflicts of the 1990s in Yugoslavia in the western half of the region) the term &quot;Southeast Europe&quot; is becoming increasingly popular.

===&quot;Standing Committee on Geographical Names&quot;===

The German (Standing Committee on Geographical Names), which develops and recommends rules for the uniform use of geographical names, proposes two sets of boundaries. The first follows international borders of current countries. The second subdivides and includes some countries based on cultural criteria. The following countries are included in their classification &quot;Southeastern Europe&quot;:

*Albania
*Bosnia and Herzegovina
*Bulgaria
*Cyprus
*Greece
*Montenegro
*Moldova
*North Macedonia
*Romania
*Serbia

In this classification, Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia are included in Central Europe, while Turkey (East Thrace) is classified outside of main Europe. 

===&quot;CIA World Factbook&quot;===

In the &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot;, the description of each country includes information about &quot;Location&quot; under the heading &quot;Geography&quot;, where the country is classified into a region. The following countries are included in their classification &quot;Southeast Europe&quot;:

*Albania
*Bosnia and Herzegovina
*Bulgaria
*Croatia
*Kosovo
*Montenegro
*North Macedonia
*Romania
*Serbia
*Turkey (East Thrace)

In this classification, Moldova is included in Eastern Europe and Greece is included in Southern Europe. Hungary and Slovenia are included in Central Europe.

==Notable groupings of states==
*The Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe (SPSEE) included Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia as member partners.
*The South-East European Cooperation Process (SEECP) includes Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey as member partners.
*The Southeast European Cooperative Initiative (SECI) includes Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey as member partners.
*The Southeast European Law Enforcement Center (SELEC) includes Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Turkey as member states.
*The EU-co-funded South East Europe Transnational Cooperation Programme includes the whole territory of Albania, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and parts of Italy and Ukraine as part of the &quot;programme area&quot;.
*The Police Cooperation Convention for Southeast Europe (PCC SEE) includes Albania, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia as member states.
*Studies of the World Bank treat Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Moldova, North Macedonia, Romania and Serbia as the eight South Eastern European countries (SEE8).
*A 2006 publication of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) listed Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Moldova, Romania and Serbia and Montenegro as &#x27;south-eastern European countries&#x27;.
*The World Bank does not include the EU countries in its reports, and lists only Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia (SEE6).
*UNHCR&#x27;s Regional Office in South Eastern Europe currently lists Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Montenegro as part of &#x27;South Eastern Europe&#x27;.

<text>Nicholas Robert Turner (26 August 1940 – 10 November 2022) was an English musician best known as a member of space rock pioneers Hawkwind. Turner played saxophone and flute, as well as being a vocalist and composer. While with Hawkwind, Turner was known for his experimental free jazz stylisations and outrageous stage presence, often donning full makeup and Ancient Egypt-inspired costumes.

==1940–1969: Early years==
Turner was born in Oxford in August 1940 to a theatrical family, although his father was working in a munitions factory. At the age of 13 his family moved to the Kent seaside resort of Margate where he worked at the local funfair during the summer holiday season, befriending another seasonal worker Robert Calvert. His first influences were rock and roll and the films of James Dean.

Turner went on to complete an engineering course and then undertook one voyage in the Merchant Navy. He then set about travelling around Europe picking up menial jobs, and it was during a stint as a roustabout in a travelling music circus in 1967 that he made the acquaintance of Dave Brock in Haarlem, the Netherlands.

Turner had two years of clarinet and saxophone lessons in the early 1960s but never considered himself good enough to pursue them seriously. Whilst travelling around Europe he encountered some free jazz players in Berlin who impressed upon him the importance of expression over technical proficiency, and it was then that he decided that what he &quot;wanted to do was play free jazz in a rock band&quot;.

==1969–1976 and 1982–1984: Hawkwind==

Turner, owning a van, had originally offered his services as a roadie to the newly formed Hawkwind. However, when the band discovered his passion for the saxophone he was offered a position in the band to add to the overall weirdness of their sound.


Of his playing, Turner admitted that &quot;it&#x27;s the overall feel rather than the individual parts of the music that we&#x27;re interested in. I don&#x27;t have any illusions about my technical ability. I tend to use it as an electronic medium rather than an instrument&quot;. He became an active and vocal member of the band, pulling in friends such as Dik Mik, Calvert and Barney Bubbles, and involving the band in community and charity projects, sometimes to the chagrin of the others.
&quot;NME&quot; – September 1972

Turner was a member of the band during their most commercially successful and critically acclaimed period, writing or co-writing some of their most popular songs such as &quot;Brainstorm&quot; and &quot;Master of the Universe&quot;. However, complaints about his playing over other members of the band despite numerous requests to modify his behaviour eventually led to his dismissal in November 1976.

In 1982 during the recording of &quot;Choose Your Masques&quot;, Brock invited Turner to the recording sessions and he was asked to front the band for the album&#x27;s tour. Turner&#x27;s second stint in the band lasted just over 2 years and although the band did not undertake any studio recording together, he was featured on live albums including &quot;Zones&quot;, &quot;This Is Hawkwind, Do Not Panic&quot; and the band’s first released concert video, Night of the Hawks. Although some live albums and videos were released, the band did not undertake any studio recording. At the end of 1984 while preparing material for &quot;The Chronicle of the Black Sword&quot; album, he was sacked once again.

==1977–1986: Sphynx and Inner City Unit==

After his first departure from Hawkwind, Turner holidayed in Egypt and while visiting the Great Pyramid of Giza he was given three hours inside the King&#x27;s Chamber to record some flute music. On returning to England, Steve Hillage cleaned up the tapes and assembled the Sphynx band featuring Hawkwind&#x27;s Alan Powell, Gong&#x27;s Mike Howlett and Tim Blake, and Harry Williamson to record music augmenting the original flute tracks while Turner adapted lyrics from the Egyptian Book of the Dead. The album was released as &quot;Xitintoday&quot; on Charisma Records in 1978 and the band toured, played festivals including Deeply Vale Festivals (later released as a CD), Glastonbury Festival (part of which was broadcast on BBC television) and his own themed &quot;Bohemian Love-In&quot; all day festival at the Roundhouse.

With Williamson he conceived the &quot;Nuclear Waste&quot; single featuring many of the Sphynx musicians and a lead vocal by Sting. He then guested on the album &quot;Fairy Tales&quot; by Williamson and Gilli Smyth&#x27;s project Mother Gong, and out of this he, Mo Vicarage and Ermanno Ghisio-Erba (a.k.a. Dino Ferari) formed Inner City Unit (ICU) with Trev Thoms and Dead Fred. Thoms and Ghisio-Erba had previously played together in Steve Took&#x27;s Horns who had played their only gig at the &quot;Bohemian Love-In&quot;. The Horns were managed by Tony Landau, a friend of Turner&#x27;s since adolescence, and were fronted by former Tyrannosaurus Rex percussionist Steve Peregrin Took, who would later make guest lead vocal appearances with ICU alongside his former Horns bandmates. Inner City Unit recorded the albums &quot;Pass Out&quot; and &quot;Maximum Effect&quot; before collapsing due to certain members drug problems. Turner and Dead Fred had stints in Hawkwind before regrouping to release the albums &quot;New Anatomy&quot;, &quot;The President Tapes&quot; and the EP &quot;Blood and Bone&quot;.

==1987–1999==
Turner&#x27;s next project was Nik Turner&#x27;s Fantastic All Stars, a saxophone and Hammond organ driven jazz and rhythm and blues band. They gigged for several years, eventually releasing the album &quot;Kubanno Kickasso!&quot;.

Turner and Twink got together for some impromptu live performances under the name Pinkwind, two CDs of which were released on Twink&#x27;s own record label without the permission of Turner.

In 1993 Turner was approached by Pressurehed and Helios Creed to record another version of his Sphynx project using the original flute tracks, resulting in the album &quot;Sphynx&quot;. This partnership then developed further, regularly touring in the US performing a set of Hawkwind-centred material sometimes featuring Genesis P-Orridge, Jello Biafra and former Hawkwind members Simon House, Del Dettmar and Powell. One studio album &quot;Prophets of Time&quot; was released in 1994 followed by the live CD and DVD &quot;Space Ritual 1994 Live&quot; and another live CD &quot;Past or Future?&quot; in 1996. Out of this set of musicians formed the band Anubian Lights, centred on Len Del Rio and Tommy Greñas from Pressurehed with contributions from Turner, Dettmar and House, as did the band Spiral Realms centred on House and Rio.

==2000–2022==

On 21 October 2000, at the Brixton Academy, a &#x27;Hawkestra&#x27; event took place, featuring nearly all past members of Hawkwind. Disagreements between various participants led to any restaging of the event being unlikely, but Turner did stage a further event under the banner The Greasy Truckers Party featuring members of the Hawkestra&#x27; on 21 October 2001 at the London Astoria. Out of this a loose band formed, performing further gigs and eventually using the name xhawkwind.com. An appearance at Guilfest in 2002 led to confusion as to whether this actually was Hawkwind, sufficiently irking Brock into taking legal action to prohibit Turner from trading under the name Hawkwind, a case which Turner lost. The band settled on the name Space Ritual and are still currently active. Nik also made an impromptu appearance during the first Reggae Festival of Wales in 2003, joining the Goldmaster Allstars and Jamaican vocalist Alton Ellis.

Turner resurrected another version of Inner City Unit with Thoms, performing irregular gigs. He also fronted the &quot;psychedelic latino-funk&quot; band Galaktikos. He continued to attend festivals playing and guesting whenever possible and was an eager contributor to other band&#x27;s projects, such as recording an album and touring with US space rockers Spaceseed in 2004, and live appearances with UK dance outfit Akahum at BGG Shareholders Party &amp; HEADS Haiti Benefit show. Living in Carmarthen, he often busked playing his saxophone in Cardiff city centre during weekend nights.

After playing at &quot;Hawkfan Festival&quot; in Hamburg in 1997 and the Space and Rock Festival – Rocksjon, Jönköping, Sweden in 1998 with the Finnish space rock group Dark Sun, they moved to play at Tavastia Club, Helsinki, Finland. This resulted in the live album, &quot;Ice Ritual&quot;, which was released in 2000.

In 2008 Nik Turner was invited to Space Mirrors collective as a guest member. Since that time he recorded flute and saxophone on three Space Mirrors releases: &quot;Majestic-12: A Hidden Presence&quot; (2009), &quot;Dreams of Area 51&quot; (2011) and &quot;In Darkness They Whisper&quot; (2012).

Turner also provided flute for Dodson and Fogg, a folk rock project released in 2012. After a chance meeting with Mr H, a Welsh jazz/blues singer-songwriter, at Brecon Jazz Festival in 2012, where Turner and Mr H performed a free improvised jazz session, Mr H invited Turner to feature on his fourth album, &quot;Poets, Balladeers and Cheats&quot;. In October 2012, Turner entered Berryhill Studios in Monmouthshire, and performed an improvised alto saxophone session on seven of Mr H&#x27;s compositions, which were released in the spring of 2013.

In March 2013 Turner turned up at the SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas playing an official SXSW gig at Rebels Honky Tonk bar billed as Nik Turner (ex-Hawkwind) playing predominantly &quot;Space Ritual&quot; songs. He also guested on stage with The Soft Moon at Hotel Vegas the previous night. Turner also played saxophone and narrated &quot;Brainstorm&quot; on the &quot;Warfare&quot; album (2017 High Roller Records). In March 2019 he appeared in Austin, Texas, with ex-Hawkwind members Alan Powell and Michael Moorcock in an event called Hawkfest,
At the Laugharne Weekend 2019, Damo Suzuki played the Fountain Inn with his all-star Sound Carriers which included Euros Childs and New Order drummer Stephen Morris. Nik Turner joined them at the end of their set.

==Personal life and death==
Turner died on 10 November 2022, at the age of 82.

<text>Barathrum is a Finnish black-doom metal band, formed in 1990. The band&#x27;s name is Latin for &quot;pit&quot; or &quot;abyss&quot;. The first letters of their eight full-length albums spell &quot;HEIL SOVA&quot; - referring to the band&#x27;s frontman, Demonos Sova, who is the only original member of the band. Their music is stylistically similar to early black metal acts such as Venom and Celtic Frost. Their lyrics deal with occult and religious themes.

==History==

Barathrum was founded at Kuopio, Finland under a name of Darkfeast, which was changed into Barathrum the year after. 

Barathrum recorded several demos during the years 1991-1993. After the demos, Barathrum signed to an underground German record label called Nazgul’s Eyrie Productions which released low budget studio albums &quot;Hailstorm&quot; (1995), &quot;Eerie (1995)&quot; and &quot;Infernal&quot; (1997) before the label went hiatus and left Barathrum as an unsigned artist. 

The band signed to Spinefarm Records record label in 1998 and released five albums, ”Legions Of Perkele” (1998), &quot;Saatana&quot; (1999), ”Okkult&quot; (2000), &quot;Venomous&quot; (2002) and ”Anno Aspera: 2003 Years After Bastard’s Birth” making Barathrum one of the most prominent bands in Finnish black metal scene.

After the years of hiatus, the band was signed to Finnish underground record label Saturnal Records and released their ninth full-length album &quot;Fanatiko (2017)&quot; in April 28th 2017.

<doc id="888372" wikidata="Q1630360" url="?curid=888372" title="Provisions of Oxford">
<text>The Provisions of Oxford were constitutional reforms to the government of late medieval England adopted during the Oxford Parliament of 1258 to resolve a dispute between Henry III of England and his barons. The reforms were designed to ensure the king adhered to the rule of law and governed according to the advice of his barons. A council of fifteen barons was chosen to advise and control the king and supervise his ministers. Parliament was to meet regularly three times a year. 

Like the earlier Magna Carta, the Provisions of Oxford demonstrated the ability of the barons to press their concerns in opposition to the English monarchy. Henry&#x27;s failure to abide by the reforms sparked the Second Barons&#x27; War, which ended with Henry&#x27;s victory and the restoration of royal authority. The Provisions of Oxford were annulled in 1266 by the Dictum of Kenilworth. 

==Background==
Henry III became king in 1216 when he was still a child, so a regency government was appointed. William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke and hereditary Lord Marshal, was given the title (Latin for &quot;governor of the king and of the kingdom&quot;) until his death in 1219. The regency ended in 1223 when the king was declared of age. After the death of Marshal, the government was led by a succession of chief ministers, first Hubert de Burgh (1219–1232) and then Peter des Roches (1232–1234). Both of these ministers alienated the baronage by their accumulation of power and wealth for themselves and their families, ultimately leading to their removal from power.

Appointing ministers was traditionally a royal prerogative, but a precedent had been established by Henry&#x27;s regency government of seeking the consent of Parliament. With their links to the magnates and established traditions and procedures, the great offices had functioned as a check on royal power. Under Roches, the Crown adopted a policy of subordinating the great offices (justiciar, chancellor, treasurer) to the offices of the royal household (chamberlain, keeper of the Wardrobe). The chief justiciarship lost most of its powers and was reduced to supervising the judiciary. The office was left vacant after Stephen de Segrave was dismissed in 1234. In 1238, the Lord Chancellor Ralph Neville was deprived of the great seal, which was entrusted to Wardrobe clerks. After Neville&#x27;s death, the seal was entrusted to keepers and the chancellorship remained vacant. With the great seal in Henry&#x27;s custody, &quot;the king was relieved of all constraint save such as the more elastic methods of his domestic clerks might impose&quot;.

After 1240, the king&#x27;s closest counselors were foreigners—Queen Eleonor&#x27;s Savoyard relatives and Henry&#x27;s Lusignan half-brothers. Among the barons, an opposition party formed to oppose a royal government controlled by foreigners. There was also opposition to the King&#x27;s demands for taxation to pay off his debts and to the so-called Sicilian business, Henry&#x27;s unrealistic plans to conquer the Kingdom of Sicily for his second son, Edmund Crouchback.

==Drafting==
In the spring of 1258, Henry sought financial aid from Parliament and was confronted by a group of barons who insisted on reforms. The King agreed to the appointment of a committee of twenty-four members, twelve selected by the Crown and twelve by the barons. 

Five of Henry&#x27;s nominees were foreigners, and the Earl of Surrey was married to a sister of the Lusignan brothers. Among those chosen by the magnates, only Simon de Montfort was a foreigner. The Twenty-four presented their reform programme at the Oxford Parliament held in June 1258.

==Reforms==
The provisions fit into three categories: (1) appointment and control of principal ministers, (2) the king&#x27;s council, and (3) parliament.

=== Ministers ===
The office of justiciar was revived. In the past, the justiciar had been the king&#x27;s chief minister and viceroy whenever he was in Normandy. After the loss of the Angevin Empire during the reign of King John, however, the office had fallen into disuse. The new justiciar would be an ex officio member of the king&#x27;s council and have authority over the judiciary, including the right to hear appeals from all other courts, whether royal or baronial. He was to hold office for one year and was responsible to the king&#x27;s council for his conduct. According to historian George Sayles, &quot;[t]his was a most serious departure from previous practice, for it placed at the head of the judiciary a minister virtually independent of the king.&quot; Hugh Bigod, who was acceptable to both the king and the barons, was made justiciar. 

The chancellor and treasurer were also limited to one year in office, and like the justiciar were not to take direct orders from the king. Control of royal finance was given to the exchequer, so the king was unable to divert revenues for his own spending. Local offices, such as sheriff and escheator, were also to be under annual term limits. Sheriffs were to be chosen from among local knights rather than outsiders and paid so they would not need to take bribes. New castellans were to be appointed and given custody of royal castles.

=== King&#x27;s council ===

The king&#x27;s council was reformed to more effectively advise and control the king. The Twenty-four selected fifteen counsellors (nine representing the barons) who were to advise the king on all matters. The Fifteen were:

# Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester
# Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester
# Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk
# John du Plessis, 7th Earl of Warwick
# Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford
# William de Forz, 4th Earl of Albemarle
# Peter of Savoy
# John fitzGeoffrey
# Peter de Montfort
# Richard Grey
# Roger Mortimer
# James Audley
# Boniface of Savoy, Archbishop of Canterbury
# Waltere Cantilupe, Bishop of Worcester
# John Mansel

While the Fifteen controlled the king&#x27;s council, they were not the only members. The justiciar, treasurer and chancellor were always members, as were other ministers and judges. In addition, the king could still include other advisers. In fact, it was impossible for the Fifteen to constantly be on hand to advise the king. At routine council meetings, the Fifteen were represented by two or three of their number who would decide if any business was important enough to summon the full Fifteen. In addition, the chancellor was made to swear that he would not seal any important grant without the assent of a majority of the Fifteen.

=== Parliament ===
It was decided that &quot;there be three parliaments a year ... to treat of the common wants of the kingdom, and of the king&quot;. Attending three regular parliaments each year would have been a burden for the barons. Therefore, the Twenty-four asked the parliament assembled at Oxford to choose twelve representatives who would attend the regular parliaments. This provision was not meant to limit attendance at parliament to only the twelve; rather, it guaranteed that there would be a minimum representative attendance. Recommendations for an inquest into local (mis-)government and further measures of reform were also set out.

==Implementation==

A written confirmation of the agreement was sent to the sheriffs of all the counties of England in three languages: Latin, French and, significantly, Middle English. The use of the English language was symbolic of the anglicisation of the government of England and an antidote to the Francization which had taken place in the decades immediately before. The Provisions were the first government documents to be published in English since the Norman Conquest two hundred years before.

The reforms implemented by the Fifteen were not limited to changes in government. They also included control of the royal household. The barons determined not only the household&#x27;s senior members, such as the stewards, but also the lower servants, such as cooks. A humiliated Henry was essentially treated as if he were a minor.

The Provisions of Oxford were confirmed and extended in 1259 by the Provisions of Westminster.

==Failure==
The Provisions of Oxford were overthrown by Henry, helped by a papal bull, in 1261, seeding the start of the Second Barons&#x27; War (1263–1267). The king was defeated at the Battle of Lewes in 1264, and Simon de Montfort became the real ruler of England for the next twelve months. However, Henry was still king, and the rebels never considered removing him. Instead, Montfort called a Parliament to sanction a new form of government to control the king. The Parliament held in June 1264 approved the appointment of three electors (Montfort; Stephen Bersted, Bishop of Chichester; and Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester). These men were to choose a council of nine, by whose advice the king was to rule. The electors could replace any of the nine as they saw fit, but the electors themselves could only be removed by Parliament.

Ultimately, the war was won by the king and his royalist supporters, and the Provisions of Oxford were annulled for the last time in 1266 by the Dictum of Kenilworth. Nonetheless, the administrative and legislative reforms the barons had initiated were taken up and confirmed in the Statute of Marlborough.

== Historical analysis ==
The 1258 Provisions had a significant effect upon the development of the English common law, limiting in part the expansion of royal jurisdiction by way of the number of available writs, but in the main confirming the importance of the common law of the land for all, from king to commoner.

There were weaknesses to this constitutional framework. Most significantly was the lack of any method to prevent future misconduct by the king or those following his orders. Historian G. O. Sayles notes,

Neither the new role of the king nor the powers of the Fifteen was ever defined. Legal scholar Ann Lyon reflected that the provisions &quot;have the feel, as with many of the first fumblings towards constitutional change which occur in the medieval period, and indeed much later, of being incompletely thought through.&quot;

<text>The Richardson Highway is a highway in the U.S. state of Alaska, running 368 miles (562 km) and connecting Valdez to Fairbanks. It is marked as Alaska Route 4 from Valdez to Delta Junction and as Alaska Route 2 from there to Fairbanks. It also connects segments of Alaska Route 1 between the Glenn Highway and the Tok Cut-Off. The Richardson Highway was the first major road built in Alaska.

== History ==

===Early Years and Exploration===
Indigenous trade routes existed in the region going from Prince William Sound to the north of the Alaska Range into the Alaskan Interior starting at least 5000 years ago. The majority of the trade was facilitated by the Ahtna, but also included the Eyak and Sugpiaq to the south, and the Tanana Athabaskans to the north. The route of the Richardson Highway primarily follows part of this old trade network. Prospectors heard rumors of this ancient trade route and it encouraged them to explore the Interior to try to find a route to the gold fields in the Klondike area.

In 1885, Lieutenant Henry Allen&#x27;s party crossed the eastern Alaska Range from the mouth of the Copper River to the Tanana River via Suslota Pass, the first non-natives to do so. In his report, he noted that it would be possible to build a road between Prince William Sound to the Yukon River. Shortly after his expedition, gold discoveries in the late 1880s to mid 1890s north of the Alaska Range, such as in the Fortymile Mining District, at Birch Creek near Circle, and in the western Yukon, put pressure on the US Congress to explore Alaska. In March of 1898, the US Department of War funded three expeditions to explore Southcentral Alaska. Edwin Glenn led the expedition ordered to explore from Prince William Sound to Cook Inlet for routes between the Susitna and Copper rivers then northward to the Tanana River. Attached to the expedition was geologist Walter Mendenhall from the USGS. They would eventually cross Isabel Pass, who were also the first recorded non-natives through that route, but fell short 15-20 miles from the Tanana River. This pass received very little attention at the time.

===Valdez-Eagle Trail===
Concurrently, Captain William Abercrombie was ordered to explore from Valdez northward to the Copper River and tributaries of the Tanana River. By 1899, the Army ordered Captain Abercrombie to build a military road from Valdez to Copper Center then onto Eagle. Before winter of 1899, they had completed a 93 mile trail suitable for packhorses through Keystone Canyon and past Thompson Pass to the Tonsina River. By 1901, the pack trail was completed, and provided an &quot;all-American&quot; route to the Klondike gold fields. The total distance of the road was about 409 miles (660 km). After the rush ended, the Army kept the trail open in order to connect its posts for communication at Fort Liscum, in Valdez, and Fort Egbert, in Eagle. One way message times were generally around 6 months from the Yukon to Washington, D.C. By 1904, the completion of the WAMCATS allowed near instantaneous communication from Fort Egbert to the US Capitol using an all American telegraph system.

===Valdez-Fairbanks Trail===
The Fairbanks Gold Rush in July of 1902 drew attention away from the Klondike region, drawing prospectors to Fairbanks. These new travelers would follow the established Valdez-Eagle Trail until the Gakona River, and then utilize Ahtna trading trails through Isabel Pass to the Tanana Valley and finally unto Fairbanks. Most traffic using this route was during the winter with pack trains or sled dogs, since animals would tear up moss if it wasn&#x27;t frozen, hampering travel. Travel to the area during the summer was via riverboats. The new traffic also enticed many to build roadhouses along the route, although many faced difficulty keeping them profitable.

Along with the previous gold discoveries, the Fairbanks Gold Rush prompted the US Congress to send a senatorial party in 1903 to Alaska to hear testimony. At Eagle, Lieutenant William Mitchell told the party his estimated $2 million cost of building a road between Eagle to the Tanana River crossing, near Tok, then onto the Chena River confluence with the Tanana River. He suggested a route from Copper Center to the Tanana River crossing would be more cost effective. The senatorial party also met with Judge James Wickersham and Fairbanks resident Abraham Spring, both pushing for government led roadbuilding, opining that the miners could build feeder roads if a central road was built.

===Road Building and Modernity===
In early 1904, Congress passed legislation to build roads throughout Alaska. After surveys by the Army Corps of Engineers during the summer of that year, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Major Wilds Richardson as the head of the Alaska Road Commission to supervise the construction of a wagon road from Valdez to Fairbanks starting in 1905. Richardson suggested dividing the trail into 3 sections, the first from Valdez to Copper Center along Abercrombie&#x27;s route, the second from the mouth of the Delta River to Fairbanks, and the third connecting the two from Copper Center to Isabel Pass. By 1909, eggs, cranberries, cattle, and other groceries were shipped up the trail in the winter to Fairbanks. Although Richardson contended with low funds and difficult construction, the road was finished in 1910.

During the construction, the government hired failed gold prospectors as well as regular construction workers. The income from this work allowed many of the prospectors to leave Alaska.

Although automobiles and motorcycles were shipped to Fairbanks and Valdez sometime after 1908, it is unknown when the first motorized vehicle was used on the highway. BY 1909, cars were used at either end of the highway. Attempts were made in 1909 to use a motorcycle to cross the entirety of the highway, but storms and mechanical issues proved too much. On July 29th, 1913, Bobby Sheldon and two prospectors, John Ronan and John Ferguson, began the trip from Fairbanks at approximately 10:30pm in a modified Model T. They arrived at Valdez four days later, at around 11pm on August 2nd, after taking a detour to Chitina. A second vehicle made by the White Motor Company from the Alaska Road Commission with representatives manufacturer left the day before Bobby Sheldon&#x27;s party, and arrived in Fairbanks on August 6th.

The rise of motorized travel led the road to be upgraded to automobile standards in the 1920s. To finance continued maintenance and road construction, the Alaska Road Commission instituted tolls for commercial vehicles in 1933 of up to $175 per trip, which were collected at the Tanana River ferry crossing at Big Delta. When the tolls were further increased in 1941 to boost business for the Alaska Railroad, disgruntled truckers nicknamed &quot;gypsies&quot; started a rogue ferry service in order to evade the toll.

The Alaska and Glenn highways, built during World War II, connected the rest of the continent and Anchorage to the Richardson Highway at Delta Junction and Glennallen respectively, allowing motor access to the new military bases built in the Territory just prior to the war: Fort Richardson in Anchorage, and Fort Wainwright adjacent to Fairbanks. The bridge at Big Delta, the last remaining gap, was built as part of the Alaska Highway project.

The southern end was only open during summers until 1950, when a freight company foreman who lived near the treacherous Thompson Pass plowed the snow himself for an entire season to prove the route could be used year-round. The highway was paved in 1957.

The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, built in 1973-1977, mostly parallels the highway from Fairbanks to Valdez.

==Roadhouses==
Due to the rugged nature of the early highway, roadhouses were built every 15-20 miles. These ranged from a tents on platforms to properly built cabins with separated rooms. Most were heated by woodstoves and sourced water from nearby lakes or streams. Food ranged from bleak to scrumptious, depending on nearby game availability and gardens at each outpost. Hay and water for horses were also provided. Around 30 roadhouses existed, but this would change each year as they route of the highway changed and business would open and close.

==Recent and future improvements==

* During the 1990s, the highway was upgraded from Fairbanks to the main gate at Eielson AFB, making this stretch a 4-lane divided road. Intersections with other roads, however, are still almost entirely at-grade.
* Under SAFETEA-LU, Alaska Route 2 from the Canadian border to Fairbanks, comprising parts of the Richardson and Alaska Highways, has been declared a High Priority Corridor (Corridor 67). What this means for the distant future is not yet certain; although SAFETEA-LU does explicitly provide federal funds for upgrading the road to 4 lanes and divided, from Salcha to Delta Junction.

==Interstate Highway System==
Richardson Highway is part of the unsigned part of the Interstate Highway System east of Fairbanks. The entire length of Interstate A-2 follows Route 2 from the George Parks Highway (Interstate A-4) junction in Fairbanks to Tok, east of which Route 2 carries Interstate A-1 off the Tok Cut-Off Highway to the international border. Only a short piece of the Richardson Highway in Fairbanks is built to freeway standards.

<text>USS &quot;Broome&quot; (DD-210/AG-96) was a &quot;Clemson&quot;-class destroyer in the United States Navy. She was named after Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel John L. Broome.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Broome&quot; was launched 14 May 1919, by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia; sponsored by Miss Mary Josephine Heyworth Broome, granddaughter of Lieutenant Colonel Broome, and commissioned 31 October 1919.

==Service history==
&quot;Broome&quot; left New York Navy Yard in May 1920 for duty in European waters. She cruised between English and French ports, as well as in the Baltic Sea and Mediterranean. At the end of the year, she reported to the Asiatic Fleet. After two years, she returned to the United States and went out of commission at San Diego 30 December 1922.

&quot;Broome&quot; was recommissioned 5 February 1930 and thereafter served actively with the fleet in the Pacific until 1939, except for a period in reduced commission during 1934. In May 1939, &quot;Broome&quot; arrived at Norfolk Navy Yard for duty in the Atlantic. In 1941, she was attached to Destroyer Division 63, Patrol Force, and operated with the Neutrality Patrol on the United States East Coast. Later that year, she served as a convoy escort between Iceland and the United States.

From January 1942 until May 1945, &quot;Broome&quot; engaged in convoy escort, patrol, and training operations in U.S. East Coast, Icelandic, Canadian, and Caribbean waters. In addition, she escorted several trans-Atlantic convoys to North Africa and the United Kingdom.

==Convoys escorted==
==Disposal==
On 4 May 1945 &quot;Broome&quot; arrived at Charleston Navy Yard for overhaul and on 23 May her designation was changed to AG-96. On 10 June 1945, as a unit of the Atlantic Fleet attached to the Operational Training Command, she reported for duty at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, where she served until December 1945. On 10 December she proceeded to Philadelphia and commenced her pre-inactivation overhaul. &quot;Broome&quot; was decommissioned 20 May 1946 and sold 20 November 1946.

As of 2015, no other U.S. Navy ship has been named &quot;Broome&quot;.

<doc id="888375" wikidata="Q8034847" url="?curid=888375" title="Workforce Investment Act of 1998">
<text>The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA, ) was a United States federal law that was repealed and replaced by the 2014 Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.

==Purpose==
The Workforce Investment Act is a federal act that &quot;provides workforce investment activities, through statewide and local workforce investment systems, that increase the employment, retention, and earnings of participants, and increase occupational skill attainment by participants, and, as a result, improve the quality of the workforce, reduce welfare dependency, and enhance the productivity and competitiveness of the Nation.&quot;
The law was enacted to replace the Job Training Partnership Act and certain other Federal (outlined below in History) and job training laws with new workforce investment systems (or workforce development). The law was enacted during Bill Clinton&#x27;s second term and attempts to induce business to participate in the local delivery of Workforce Development Services through Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs) which were to be chaired by private sector members of the local community. A majority of Board members were also required to represent business interests.

==History==
===Job Training and Partnership Act of 1982===
The federal Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982 was the predecessor of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. This law used federal funding to implement programs that prepared youth and unskilled adults for entry into the workforce and provided employment-related services for disadvantaged individuals. For each succeeding fiscal year, programs such as adult and youth programs, federally administered programs, summer youth employment training programs and training assistance for dislocated workers were carried out.

===Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973===
The Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 consolidated all existing federal job-training programs. This act offered work to low-income individuals, long-term unemployed individuals, and out-of-high school individuals. Training and full-time jobs in the public service were provided for unemployed, underemployed, and disadvantaged individuals. In order to decentralize control of federally controlled job training programs, the Act provided funds to state and local governments through federal grants.

===Rehabilitation Act of 1973===
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 authorized: (a) the formula grant programs of vocational rehabilitation, supporting employment, independent living, and client assistance; (b) a variety of training and service-discretionary grants administered by the Rehabilitation Administration; and (c) research activities that were administered by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research.
Also, this Act prohibited discrimination on the basis of disability and expanded special Federal responsibilities and training programs within the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.

===Manpower Development Training Act of 1962===
The Manpower Development Training Act of 1962 originated when President John F. Kennedy told legislators that &quot;Large scale unemployment during a recession is bad enough, but large scale unemployment during a period of prosperity would be intolerable.&quot; This act dealt with this situation by promoting a professional training plan and providing major Federal Funding to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in order to improve the technical training of the unemployed and underemployed labor in the postwar period. The professional training plan provided federal funding to retain workers displaced because of technological change and for classroom and on-the-job-training targeted to low-income individuals and welfare recipients.

===Wagner Peyser Act of 1933===
The Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933 established a nationwide employment system of public employment offices. These offices were known as the employment service and were created for cooperation of the States in the promotion of system to aid employment.

==Mission and goals==

The main goal of the WIA is to create a system that provides a means to increase employment, retention, and earnings of individuals. Accomplishing this goal is dependent on the services the WIA provides to increase occupational skill attainment by participants. The WIA is split into five titles that outline how the WIA accomplishes this goal.

===Title one===

Title one of the Act authorizes state workforce investment boards, as well as local workforce investment boards. In order to measure how well people are doing in the program, title one requires the use of certain standards for success. Title one also authorizes a one-stop delivery system to be used in the program. This system sets up one place participants can go in their local area to get both job training and referrals. National programs such as jobs corps, Native American, migrant, and veterans programs are also authorized in title one.

===Title two===

Title two sets up systems to help adults reach certain literacy levels in order to be successful in the workforce. Adult education is provided to help adults reach a minimum of an 8th grade reading level before entering the workforce.

===Title three===

Grants and contracts are authorized in title three to provide and conduct the following training, projects, and services. Grants provide academic training to individuals that provide rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities. Training to maintain and upgrade basic skills and knowledge of the people providing service delivery and rehabilitation technology services is provided under title three. Grants and contracts are also authorized to conduct special projects and demonstrations that include research and evaluation that expand rehabilitation services. Additionally, vocational rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities who are migrant or seasonal farmworkers is provided. Grants are also used to initiate recreational programs for individuals with disabilities to aid them in employment, mobility, socialization, independence, and community integration. Lastly, grants and contracts are authorized to provide training and information to individuals with disabilities and their representatives. This training should develop skills necessary for individuals with disabilities to gain access to rehabilitation systems and statewide workforce investment systems and become active decision makers in the rehabilitation process.

===Title four===
Title four amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in order to work with the WIA to accomplish the goal of helping people return to the workforce. Title four creates a national council on disability, which is appointed by the president, to link rehabilitation programs to state and local workforce development systems. Members of this council are individuals with disabilities, parents or guardians of individuals with disabilities, or other individuals who have substantial knowledge or experience relating to disability policy or programs. The function of this council is to guarantee that people with disabilities have access to local and state workforce development systems in order to provide equal opportunity.

===Title five===
Title five provides general provisions by which the WIA can accomplish its goals. Title five states that the WIA is a state unified plan. Incentive grants will be rewarded to states exceeding negotiated performance levels and defined indicators of performance.

==Provisions==
The provisions of the Act were delineated into five subchapters:

==Funding and budget==

Each state receives a different amount from the federal government for their budget under the Workforce Investment Act. The amount in the budget is dependent on the size of population for each State. Utah gets $1.5 million each year from the federal government. Due to the fact that Utah has a relatively small population, compared to other states, the budget stays with the state instead of being distributed to local areas. In larger states, such as California, the budget is much larger and is divided out to local boards. The budget, regardless of the state, can be used for the following three main &quot;streams&quot;:

===Adults===
The Secretary of Labor reserves Twenty percent of funds for National Emergency Grants, dislocated worker demonstration efforts, and technical assistance.

===Dislocated workers===
The remaining 60 are allocated to local areas, while 15 percent being reserved for statewide activities, and 25 percent for State rapid response efforts.

===Youth===
Eighty five percent of youth funds are allocated to local areas. Fifteen percent are reserved for statewide activities, and funds appropriated in excess of $1 billion (up to $250 million) will be used by the U.S. Department of Labor to fund Youth Opportunity grants.
States can merge the fifteen percent set-asides for statewide activities from the three separate funding streams if they choose to do so (for example, state set-aside funds from the adult stream may be used for statewide youth activities.) Also, with the approval of the Governor, local areas may transfer 20 percent between adult and dislocated workers funding streams.

==Subsequent actions==
The law was slightly amended by the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Amendments of 1998 and the Higher Education Amendments of 1998.

The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (H.R. 803; 113th Congress) was enacted on July 22, 2014. It seeks to consolidate job training programs under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) and will streamline the process of receiving services from three levels (core, intensive, and training) into a single process, allowing clients to receive needed services earlier in the process. In addition, it will push those providing WIA services to collaborate more with the Vocational Rehabilitation programs in order to provide more services for people with disabilities into a single funding stream. It also amended the Wagner-Peyser Act, reauthorized adult-education programs, and reauthorized programs under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The various job programs are authorized for six years with a requirement that they record and report on how many people get new jobs through their participation in the programs. The new regulations are currently in draft form and will not be finalized till January 2016.

<doc id="888381" wikidata="Q4041406" url="?curid=888381" title="Inner City Unit">
<text>Inner City Unit were a London based popular music group active from 1979 through to 1985, their music style encompassing psychedelia and punk rock. They recorded four studio albums, one studio EP and one compilation album of previously unreleased material.

The group were established by ex-Hawkwind saxophonist Nik Turner, joined by bassist and keyboardist Phil Reeves (known as Dead Fred). Trev Thoms was the guitarist of the first incarnation and Steve Pond the second. Ermano Ghisio-Erba (known as Dino Ferari) and Mick Lee (known as Mick Stupp) were the drummers. Andy Anderson (drums) and Michael Vickerage (known as Mo Vicarage) (keyboards) played live and recorded with the group in the early days. Barry Downes (known as Baz Magneto), GP Wayne (known as Little Bit), Dave Anderson and Nazar Alikhan had stints with the group playing bass.

Since their split, various members have got together on occasions to record or play live using the name.

==History==

===Formation 1977–1979===
In 1977, after Nik Turner had been dismissed from Hawkwind, he traveled to Egypt and made some portable recordings playing flute in the King&#x27;s Chamber of Great Pyramid of Giza. With producer Steve Hillage he worked these recordings into the album &quot;Xitintoday&quot; (exit into day) with contributions from members of Gong, Harry Williamson and Andy Anderson. His group performed live as Sphynx.

With Williamson he conceived the protest single &quot;Nuclear Waste&quot; issued as Fast Breeder and the Radio Actors, with vocals from Sting, and then contributed to the album &quot;Fairy Tales&quot; by Williamson and Gilli Smyth&#x27;s group Mother Gong. On this session he met keyboardist Michael Vickerage (known as Mo Vicarage) and drummer Ermano Ghisio-Erba (known as Dino Ferari), both of whom would be pulled into Turner&#x27;s band. Erba brought in guitarist Trev Thoms with whom he had played in Steve Took&#x27;s Horns, Thoms in turn brought in keyboard player Phil Reeves (known as Dead Fred), the two having played in Steve Gibbons Band together. The new name Inner City Unit had been suggested to Turner by his close friend, the graphic designer Barney Bubbles.

===First incarnation 1979–1982===
The group recorded four tracks at Foel Studios in April, with &quot;Solitary Ashtray&quot; (originally titled &quot;Solitary Astrid&quot;) issued as a single on their own Riddle Records imprint, backed with a dub version titled &quot;So__t_ry As__id&quot;; the remaining three tracks (&quot;Watching the Grass Grow&quot;, &quot;Cars Eat With Auto Face&quot; and &quot;Alright On The Flight&quot;) would later be included on the &quot;Punkadelic&quot; compilation. The group debuted at a gig in Liverpool, then appeared at the 1979 Glastonbury Festival and at the first Futurama (The World&#x27;s First Science Fiction Music Festival) on 9 September in Leeds.

By the end of 1979, the line-up of Turner, Thoms and Reeves had been joined by Barry Downes (known as Baz Magneto, bass) and Mick Lee (known as Mick Stupp, drums). They cut demos of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Polyethylene&quot; for Polydor Records in December, but no deal was forth-coming - these tracks would also be included on the &quot;Punkadelic&quot; album. They recorded the album &quot;Pass Out&quot; at Nick Lowe&#x27;s UK Pro Studios with Paul Riley, also issued on Riddle Records with a sleeve by Bubbles. The album consisted of new recordings of the previous tracks, with covers of the two popular Turner compositions for Hawkwind, &quot;Master of the Universe&quot; and &quot;Brainstorm&quot;, as well as a cover of &quot;Nuclear Waste&quot;. 

The non-album single &quot;Paradise Beach&quot; (based on Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot;) was released in March. Steve Redman (known as Speed Machine) momentarily replaced Downes. Turner appeared with The Stranglers on &quot;Nice &#x27;n&#x27; Sleazy&quot; at Rainbow Theatre London on 3 and 4 April for &quot;The Stranglers and Friends – Live in Concert&quot;. Turner guested on Sham 69&#x27;s &quot;The Game&quot; and his group supported Sham 69 on a British tour, with G.P. Wayne (known as Little Bit) filling in on bass. Soon after Wayne and Stupp left, with Erba rejoining and Reeves playing bass as well as keyboards.

Bubbles had been given studio time at Phoenix Studios and requested the four-piece, along with Robert Calvert, record versions of his favourite 1960s garage/psychedelic rock songs. 13 tracks formed the first side of an album titled &quot;Ersatz&quot; attributed to The Imperial Pompadours, while the second side consisted of a nightmare sound collage pieced together of Wagnerian performances and readings from &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. Turner and Thoms both guested on Calvert&#x27;s &quot;Hype&quot; album.

In 1981, the band recorded the album &quot;The Maximum Effect&quot; at Trident Studios with Howard Massey for Avatar Records, with sleeve by Bubbles and photographer Brian Griffin, with a guest appearance by The Damned&#x27;s Captain Sensible. It included the singles &quot;Beer, Baccy, Bingo and Benidorm!&quot; (extended holiday version) with an appearance from the comedian Max Wall and &quot;Bones of Elvis&quot; with a contribution from cornetist Bill Boston. It also included covers of The Shangri-Las &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot;, the jazz standard &quot;In the Mood&quot; recorded by Glenn Miller, and &quot;Sid&#x27;s Song&quot; being a traditional English folk song known variously as &quot;Newlyn Town&quot;, &quot;Roving Blade&quot; or &quot;Wild and Wicked Youth&quot;. This line-up also contributed the tracks &quot;Raj Neesh&quot; and &quot;Human Beings&quot; to the various artists compilation album &quot;Hawkwind, Friends and Relations&quot;.

By mid-1982 the band were struggling with some members drug problems, Huw Lloyd-Langton filling in on guitar at times in Thoms absence. In July Flicknife Records released the album &quot;Punkadelic&quot; compiled from various previously unreleased recordings, including a cover of Jan and Arnie&#x27;s &quot;Gas Money&quot;, and the tracks &quot;God Disco&quot; and &quot;Disco Tango&quot; from a side project involving Andreas Wyden.

Turner was invited back into Hawkwind for their &quot;Choose Your Masques&quot; tour and pulled Reeves in with him. While in Hawkwind, they would perform live versions of &quot;Watching the Grass Grow&quot; (a recording from Stonehenge Free Festival 1984 appearing on &quot;This Is Hawkwind, Do Not Panic&quot;) and &quot;Human Beings&quot; adapted as &quot;Ghost Dance&quot; (on &quot;Hawkwind Anthology&quot;).

===Second incarnation 1984–1985===
After Turner and Reeves departure from Hawkwind, they regrouped with guitarist Steve Pond (who had sometimes augmented the earlier live group playing synthesiser) and bass player Dave Anderson to record &quot;New Anatomy&quot; at Foel Studios with Brian Snelling for Anderson&#x27;s Demi Monde Records, with sleeve design by Nazar Alikhan. Pond programmed a LinnDrum for the album but Stupp returned for the supporting live dates. It included a cover of Johnny Burnette and The Rock and Roll Trio&#x27;s &quot;Lonesome Train (On A Lonesome Track)&quot; and the traditional folk tune &quot;Wildhunt&quot;. &quot;Help, Sharks!&quot; had a promotional video recorded for it, included on the &quot;Pirates of the Panasoniks&quot; (Jettisoundz) various artists compilation VHS tape, but the song was not issued as a single. The band toured the album from January 1985 onward, but conflict with Anderson resulted in his departure, Reeves playing both bass and keyboards.

In May they recorded the &quot;Blood and Bone&quot; 12&quot; EP at Boilerhouse Studios with Nick Green for Jettisoundz Records, followed quickly in July by the album &quot;The President Tapes&quot; at Alaska Studios with Iain O&#x27;Higgins for Flicknife. Sleeves were designed by Mary Cason. &quot;Blood And Bone&quot; contained a cover of Red Crayola&#x27;s &quot;Hurricane Fighter Plane&quot;. &quot;The Presidents Tapes&quot; included the track &quot;Stonehenge Who Knows&quot; originally written for Hawkwind&#x27;s &quot;The Earth Ritual Preview&quot; project. Four tracks from The Imperial Pompadours album were re-recorded: Vince Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Brand New Cadillac&quot; and The Nightcrawlers&#x27; &quot;Little Black Egg&quot; on the EP; Terry Noland&#x27;s &quot;There Was Fungus Among Us&quot; and The Fe-Fi-Four Plus 2&#x27;s &quot;I Wanna Come Back (From the World of LSD)&quot; on the album. Alikhan joined the band on bass for the live dates in support of the releases, but the band fell apart by the end of the year.

===Post-ICU===
Reeves, Pond and Stupp continued using the name The Maximum Effect issuing the self-released 7&quot; single &quot;Espana&quot; backed with &quot;The Wrecker&quot;. Stupp would leave, and the remaining two were joined by Cason to act as a backing band for Calvert at his Queen Elizabeth Hall appearance on 1 October 1986, followed by a tour of Britain.

In the 1990s, Thoms used the Inner City Unit name for his own band with original drummer Erba, releasing one album &quot;Now You Know the Score&quot; as Judge Trev&#x27;s Inner City Unit.

In 2001, a version of ICU combining members from the first two incarnations played two shows. A fourth version of the band played the closing party of the 2006 FennerFest in Slough.

The final ICU tour proper happened in 2016 with the band comprising Nik Turner (Vocals, Sax), Steve Pond (guitar,vocals), Nazar Ali-Khan (bass) and Kevin Walker (drums). 

==Critical reception==
AllMusic&#x27;s retrospective review assessed &quot;Pass Out&quot; as &quot;one of the freshest sounding of all post-&#x27;70s spin-offs from [Hawkwind].&quot;

The group&#x27;s support slot for The Psychedelic Furs on 21 September 1980 at Lyceum Ballroom was reviewed by Dante Bonutto for &quot;Record Mirror&quot; as &quot;a real hoot, a five piece plus two strong girlie chorus who thankfully didn&#x27;t take themselves too seriously. But then when you play a ska version of the 1812 Overture and hurl handfuls of rotting flora into the audience I don&#x27;t suppose you can really afford to. Still, after the stark catastrophe of Ludus they were certainly a healthy blast of oxygen.&quot;

Malcolm Dome in &quot;Record Mirror&quot; thought &quot;The Maximum Effect&quot; a &quot;pure music hall eccentricity laced with modern rock idioms... a cross between the Goons, Max Miller, early Stranglers fury and Hawkwind style phrasing... The result, at best, is sharply cynical and bitingly effective.&quot; He highlights &quot;Bones of Elvis&quot; and &quot;Beer, Baccy, Bingo and Benidorm&quot; which &quot;hidden in with the humour is a decided strain of desperation that hits home very solidly indeed... But, sadly, there is an inconsistency running through ME that at times exasperates. So what promised to be an effective new humourist album ends up as adequate but no more.&quot; AllMusic retrospectively acknowledges &quot;The faithful declare &quot;Maximum Effect&quot; to be Inner City Unit&#x27;s finest hour - and... it&#x27;s impossible to disagree... only the group&#x27;s growing penchant for &quot;obvious&quot; humo[u]r detracting from some excellent performances. &quot;Maximum Effect&quot; sounds practically state of the art.&quot;

Attila the Stockbroker (using the name John Opposition) reviewed &quot;Punkadelic&quot; for &quot;Sounds&quot; as &quot;weird and wonderful&quot; while noting its &quot;diversity of styles&quot;. AllMusic assessed the album as &quot;Should one wish to make comparisons, the &quot;regular&quot; versions... are more complete than those included here... [but] this set is just as enjoyable as anything else the band released.&quot;

Andy Ross in &quot;Sounds&quot; assessed &quot;New Anatomy&quot; poorly as &quot;While ICU score full marks for variety... the overall standard of composition is average, the production limp, and the singing anaemic.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s retrospective assessment is also critical, declaring &quot;they turned in one of the most disappointing records in the entire Hawkwind family tree, a disheveled, featureless, and melody-less gaggle of half-songs highlighted by two numbers (&quot;Birdland&quot; and &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;) but so hamstrung by the other eight that, even today, it&#x27;s difficult to discern quite what they were trying to do.&quot;

&quot;Sounds&quot; classed &quot;The President Tapes&quot; as a &quot;wiggy-brilliant album [but] no go on the breaking new barriers.&quot; Dave Thompson reviewed the album for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as &quot;something of an acquired taste... stands guilty of not taking itself seriously... These songs, like the band who created them, are oddballs and, as such, should be cherished.&quot; Thompson&#x27;s retrospective review for AllMusic is consistent with his contemporary analysis, being &quot;up there with the very best music the band ever made, a tightly focused but, simultaneously, deliciously loose collection of riffs, rhythms, and - best of all - ideas that thoroughly corral all the promise that the band ever radiated without losing sight of the anarchy that was its stock in trade.&quot;

==Other activities==
Turner started his rhythm and blues and jazz rock outfit Nik Turner&#x27;s Fantastic Allstars in the late 1980s. They eventually released an album &quot;Kubanno Kickasso!&quot; in 2001.

Stupp played with many different bands with varying styles, moving from drums to guitar over time.

In the 1980s, original guitarist Thoms started the three-piece heavy metal band Atomgods which, for a while, also featured Pond on bass. Thoms died of pancreatic cancer on 8 December 2010.

Pond and Reeves played together as Krankschaft, they released an album of Robert Calvert songs under this name, joined by Mick Stupp on drums for the live album &quot;Sonic Rock Solstice 2010&quot;. Following Reeves&#x27;
Departure in 2011 Pond recruited the rhythm section of Alex Tsentides (bass, Ex The Enid) and Kevin walker (Drums) They stopped playing all ICU and Calvert Material and released 3 Albums of their own material, they continue to play the UK festival circuit. Often playing an ICU song or two in tribute to Turner and Thoms.

<doc id="888385" wikidata="Q3244437" url="?curid=888385" title="Stanley Peak (Ball Range)">
<text>Stanley Peak is a mountain located in the Ball Range, at the northeastern section of Kootenay National Park, in the Canadian Rocky Mountains (British Columbia, Canada). The mountain was named in 1901 by its first climber, the English explorer Edward Whymper, after Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, the sixth Governor-General of Canada. There are sources that date the naming in 1912 after Stanley H. Mitchell, Secretary-Treasurer of Alpine Club of Canada.

The peak is visible from the Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 93. Stanley Glacier on the northeast face of the peak can be seen up close by following a hiking trail into a hanging valley between the peak and a southern outlier of Storm Mountain.

Stanley Peak can be ascended from a scrambling route by late summer but involves much routefinding among the many ledges and gullies on the north face. Climbing routes (UIAA III) travel the north and northeast faces.

== Other BC peaks ==
There are another two peaks in British Columbia called Stanley Peak. One is 2,935 m high, located at the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District (), 24 km north-west from Keyhole Falls and 62 km west from Gold Bridge. The other is 2,030 m high, in the Stikine Region () (90 km north-west from Skagway, Alaska United States).

==Geology==
Stanley Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods that was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, the mountain is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 °C with wind chill factors below -30 °C.

<doc id="888387" wikidata="Q629689" url="?curid=888387" title="Impaled Nazarene">
<text>Impaled Nazarene is a Finnish extreme metal band that started as black metal but have incorporated elements of grindcore, thrash metal and death metal, and have grown more towards hardcore punk.

==History==
The band formed in November 1990, with founding members Mika Luttinen, Kimmo Luttinen, Mika Pääkkö, Ari Holappa and Antti Pihkala. The band gained national success when their debut album, &quot;Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz&quot;, entered the Finnish charts.

The band was infamous for their apparent hatred of the Norwegian black metal scene back the early 1990s; however, the band now seems to have disassociated themselves from that dislike. Luttinen later affirmed that &quot;We have absolutely nothing against Norwegians. I even made up with Euronymous before he was killed so just forget this thing, it is ancient history&quot;.

Impaled Nazarene stopped wearing corpse paint in the mid-1990s when black metal exploded, with Luttinen explaining that &quot;we felt it was time distance ourselves a bit from the ridiculous ideas and statements that were circulating around the whole scene back then. And look around, we are not alone who have done this. Even Norwegian bands have dropped paint and other shit and are concentrating on the music instead of childish statements&quot;.

With the release of &quot;Suomi Finland Perkele&quot;, Impaled Nazarene dropped some of their aggression and made a stylistic shift, but this direction ended with the removal of Kimmo Luttinen from the line-up. Mika Luttinen explained his dissatisfaction with Kimmo and how the band changed under his guidance:

After growing increasingly unpolished in delivery, the band made a shift, beginning with &quot;Nihil&quot; (2000) and the accession of Children of Bodom guitarist Alexi Laiho, towards a sound that has been described as &quot;a benzedrine-fueled combination of thrash metal and Iron Maiden&quot;. Luttinen explained that Laiho&#x27;s role was critical: &quot;it was clear that now that we had finally two guitar players that we kind of like wanted to get away from that punky kind of writing style and started just wanting to get more back to the metal feeling&quot;.

Their ninth studio album, &quot;Pro Patria Finlandia&quot;, was a popular import album for Japan. Impaled Nazarene have toured with bands including Cannibal Corpse, Mayhem and Dark Tranquility, traversing four continents and over thirty countries.

On 16 March 2003, guitarist Teemu Raimoranta died falling off a bridge onto the ice below, in what was described as &quot;an alcohol-related accidental fall&quot;.

On 15 January 22, the band announced that – after almost 15 years in the lineup – Tomi Ullgrén had left the band, citing busy work schedules that interfere with the band&#x27;s rehearsal schedule.

==Lyrical content==
For most of their history, Impaled Nazarene has focused on Finnish nationalism (for instance in their song &quot;Total War - Winter War&quot; about the Soviet-Finnish war in 1939 and 1940), and have demonstrated a strong anti-communist bent, as exemplified in their song &quot;Healers of the Red Plague&quot; on &quot;Rapture&quot;. Other lyrics revolve around war and Satanism. When asked about the hints of humour previously manifest in the lyrics, Luttinen affirmed that this was limited to &quot;Suomi Finland Perkele&quot;: &quot;There will be no humour, we are not some fucking joke. If people find my lyrics funny, then, well, something is most certainly wrong in their heads&quot;. The band has also maintained a tradition of including at least one song on every album which has the word &quot;goat&quot; in the title, which Luttinen considers a &quot;trademark&quot; of the band:

Impaled Nazarene&#x27;s &quot;Nihil&quot; (2000) is the only album that has been subject to a ban. However, this has caused additional problems for the band as, according to Luttinen, &quot;Somebody seem to have really something against us and unfortunately that somebody has power enough to get our shows cancelled&quot;. Luttinen has been critical of the performance bans that the band has suffered in Germany and Poland, which he made explicit in the lyrics for &quot;Manifest&quot; (2007). In response to a question about the lack of sexual themes on &quot;Manifest&quot;, Luttinen responded:

In June 2017 the hardcore festival Ieperfest in Ypres (Ieper), Belgium, removed Impaled Nazarene from the line up after threats of violence from protesters. The reason for the protest was the band&#x27;s lyrics condoning homophobia and rape. The festival organizers issued the following statement:

In November 2024, there was a stir about the Eindhoven pop venue Effenaar in the Netherlands, after it had booked the band for the Eindhoven Metal Meeting on December 13 and 14. A petition &#x27;no far-right bands in the Effenaar&#x27;, in which the arrival of Impaled Nazarene was strongly condemned, was signed more than a thousand times.

<text>The Kabye (also known as Kabiye, Kabre, Cabrai), are a people living in the north central mountains and northern plains of Togo. They speak the Kabiye language. The Kabye are primarily known for farming and cultivation of harsh, dry, infertile lands of Togo. They grow cotton, millet and yams.

Kabye people also live in northwestern Benin near the Togolese border. The Logba or Lugba people of Benin are closely related to the Kabye. Broadly defined and subgroups included, the Kabiye people are the second largest ethnic group in Togo after the Ewe people, and they dominate the Togolese government and military.

==Society and culture==
The Kabye are a patrilineal society that has been primarily devoted to subsistence farming. In contemporary economy, many are migrant labor.

===Evala wrestling===

Evala is a form of traditional wrestling practised mainly by the Kabyé of northern Togo, in West Africa. Competitors meet yearly at a festival following a retreat marking the initiation of young men into adulthood.

Evala is the penultimate element of this initiation rite, during which young men are separated from their families for one week, residing in special huts where they are fed and subject to mental training. Prior to wrestling, participants go on a pilgrimage which involves climbing three mountains; those who do not complete it are not initiated into adulthood. Although wrestlers are initiated regardless of whether they win or not, losing is considered shameful to the family name. The last of these initiation rites is circumcision.

==Notable people==
The country&#x27;s former president, Gnassingbé Eyadema, who took power in a coup, was of Kabye ethnicity. Togo is now led by Eyadema&#x27;s son, Faure Gnassingbé.

Angèle Patassé, the Togolese-born former First Lady of the Central African Republic, was also a member of the Kabye people.
