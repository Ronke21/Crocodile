<text>A lens space is an example of a topological space, considered in mathematics. The term often refers to a specific class of 3-manifolds, but in general can be defined for higher dimensions.

In the 3-manifold case, a lens space can be visualized as the result of gluing two solid tori together by a homeomorphism of their boundaries. Often the 3-sphere and formula_1, both of which can be obtained as above, are not counted as they are considered trivial special cases.

The three-dimensional lens spaces formula_2 were introduced by Heinrich Tietze in 1908. They were the first known examples of 3-manifolds which were not determined by their homology and fundamental group alone, and the simplest examples of closed manifolds whose homeomorphism type is not determined by their homotopy type. J. W. Alexander in 1919 showed that the lens spaces formula_3 and formula_4 were not homeomorphic even though they have isomorphic fundamental groups and the same homology, though they do not have the same homotopy type. Other lens spaces (such as formula_5 and formula_6) have even the same homotopy type (and thus isomorphic fundamental groups and homology), but not the same homeomorphism type; they can thus be seen as the birth of geometric topology of manifolds as distinct from algebraic topology.

There is a complete classification of three-dimensional lens spaces, by fundamental group and Reidemeister torsion.

== Definition ==

The three-dimensional lens spaces formula_2 are quotients of formula_8 by formula_9-actions. More precisely, let formula_10 and formula_11 be coprime integers and consider formula_12 as the unit sphere in formula_13. Then the formula_14-action on formula_8 generated by the homeomorphism
:formula_16
is free. The resulting quotient space is called the lens space formula_2.

This can be generalized to higher dimensions as follows: Let formula_18 be integers such that the formula_19 are coprime to formula_10 and consider formula_21 as the unit sphere in formula_22. The lens space formula_23 is the quotient of formula_21 by the free formula_25-action generated by
:formula_26
In three dimensions we have formula_27

===Properties===
The fundamental group of all the lens spaces formula_28 is formula_29 independent of the formula_19.

The homology of the lens space formula_28 is given by formula_32

Lens spaces are locally symmetric spaces, but not (fully) symmetric, with the exception of formula_33 which is symmetric. (Locally symmetric spaces are symmetric spaces that are quotiented by an isometry that has no fixed points; lens spaces meet this definition.)

== Alternative definitions of three-dimensional lens spaces ==
The three dimensional lens space formula_2 is often defined to be a solid ball with the following identification: first mark &quot;p&quot; equally spaced points on the equator of the solid ball, denote them formula_35 to formula_36, then on the boundary of the ball, draw geodesic lines connecting the points to the north and south pole. Now identify spherical triangles by identifying the north pole to the south pole and the points formula_37 with formula_38 and formula_39 with formula_40. The resulting space is homeomorphic to the lens space formula_2.

Another related definition is to view the solid ball as the following solid bipyramid: construct a planar regular &quot;p&quot; sided polygon. Put two points &quot;n&quot; and &quot;s&quot; directly above and below the center of the polygon. Construct the bipyramid by joining each point of the regular &quot;p&quot; sided polygon to &quot;n&quot; and &quot;s&quot;. Fill in the bipyramid to make it solid and give the triangles on the boundary the same identification as above.

== Classification of 3-dimensional lens spaces ==

Classifications up to homeomorphism and homotopy equivalence are known, as follows. The three-dimensional spaces formula_42 and
formula_43 are:
#homotopy equivalent if and only if formula_44 for some formula_45;
#homeomorphic if and only if formula_46.
If formula_46 as in case 2., they are &quot;obviously&quot; homeomorphic, as one can easily produce a homeomorphism. It is harder to show that these are the only homeomorphic lens spaces.

The invariant that gives the homotopy classification of 3-dimensional lens spaces is the torsion linking form.

The homeomorphism classification is more subtle, and is given by Reidemeister torsion. This was given in as a classification up to PL homeomorphism, but it was shown in to be a homeomorphism classification. In modern terms, lens spaces are determined by &quot;simple&quot; homotopy type, and there are no normal invariants (like characteristic classes) or surgery obstruction.

A knot-theoretic classification is given in :
let &quot;C&quot; be a closed curve in the lens space which lifts to a knot in the universal cover of the lens space. If the lifted knot has a trivial Alexander polynomial, compute the torsion linking form on the pair (C,C) – then this gives the homeomorphism classification.

Another invariant is the homotopy type of the configuration spaces – showed that homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic lens spaces may have configuration spaces with different homotopy types, which can be detected by different Massey products.

<text>John M. Reynolds (February 26, 1788May 8, 1865) was an American lawyer and politician from the state of Illinois who served in all three governmental branches.

One of the original four justices of the Illinois Supreme Court (1818–1825), Reynolds won several elections to the Illinois House of Representatives (1826–1830, 1846–1848, and 1852–1854, when he was Speaker of the House), United States House of Representatives (1834–1837 and 1839–1843) and the fourth Illinois Governorship (1830–1834). He was also a major general in the Illinois militia during the Black Hawk War.

Reynolds published &quot;Pioneer History of Illinois&quot; and a large autobiography titled &quot;My Own Times&quot;.

==Early life==
Reynolds was born in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. His father, Robert Reynolds and his mother, née Margaret Moore, were both natives of Ireland, from which country they emigrated to the United States in 1785, arriving first at Philadelphia. When Reynolds was about six months old, his parents emigrated with him to Tennessee, where many of their relatives had already located, at the base of the Copper Ridge Mountain, about northeast of the present city of Knoxville. After experiencing raids from Native Americans, the Reynolds moved into the interior of the state in 1794. They were poor, and brought up their children to habits of manual industry.

In 1800 the family moved to near Kaskaskia, Illinois, where Reynolds spent most of his childhood. As part of his upbringing, he adopted the principle and practice of total abstinence from intoxicating liquors. In 1807 the family made another move, this time to the Goshen Settlement, at the foot of the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River southwest of Edwardsville.

At the age of twenty, Reynolds attended college for two years near Knoxville, Tennessee, where he had relatives, taking courses in classical studies. He then studied law in Knoxville; health problems forced him back to Illinois, but he afterward returned to college and law in Knoxville. In the fall of 1812 he was admitted to the bar at Kaskaskia, and began practicing law in Cahokia, Illinois, opening his first law office there over the winter of 1813–1814. About this time he also learned the French language, which he regarded as being superior to all others for social intercourse.

==Military service==
 He also served as Judge Advocate. For this service, Reynolds became known as the &quot;Old Ranger&quot;. In 1814, Reynolds opened a law office in the old French village of Cahokia, then the county seat of St. Clair County.

==Politics==
In the fall of 1818, John Reynolds was elected an associate justice of the Illinois Supreme Court by the Illinois General Assembly. In 1822, he was joined on the court by Thomas Reynolds, but both were defeated for re-election in 1824; John Reynolds went on to become Governor of Illinois in 1830 and Thomas Reynolds became Governor of Missouri in 1840. Despite some biographies stating that the two men were brothers or uncle and nephew, a 1961 historical journal letter states that the two were not related: John Reynolds had a brother named Thomas Reynolds — or Thomas Michael Reynolds in one of his obituaries — but that brother owned a livery stable and dry goods store in Belleville; neither John nor his brother Thomas were any relation to the Thomas that served with John on the Supreme Court.

In 1818, John Reynolds was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the United States Senate. In 1826, he was elected a member of the Illinois House of Representatives for the first time, serving until 1830. Although aligning himself with the Jacksonian Democrats, his moderation earned him respect from both pro-Jackson and anti-Jackson factions.

In August 1830, Reynolds was elected governor of Illinois and took office on December 6, 1830, giving an inaugural address that advocated for free popular education, general internal public improvements, the completion of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and the improvement of the Chicago harbor. He also advocated and recommended the completion of the first state penitentiary at Alton, at the direct cost of the state. The most significant event of his administration was the Black Hawk War in 1832. He called out the militia, and was field commander, often appearing in person on the battle-grounds. He was recognized by U.S. President Andrew Jackson as Major-General, and was authorized to make treaties with the Native Americans. Asiatic Cholera was a prominent feature of Reynolds&#x27; gubernatorial term.

On November 17, 1834, Reynolds resigned as governor, having been elected to the United States House of Representatives for the Twenty-third Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Charles Slade. He was reelected to the Twenty-fourth Congress, serving from December 1, 1834, to March 3, 1837. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1836 to the Twenty-fifth Congress. He was subsequently elected to the Twenty-sixth and Twenty-seventh Congresses, serving from March 4, 1839, to March 3, 1843.

In 1837, while out of Congress and in company with a few others, he built the first railroad in the Mississippi Valley, about six miles (10 km) long, leading from his coal mine in the Mississippi bluff to the bank of the river opposite St. Louis. Not having the funds to purchase a locomotive, the railroad was operated by horse-power. The next spring, the company sold out at great loss.

In 1839 Reynolds was appointed one of the Canal Commissioners and traveled to Philadelphia to raise funds for that purpose. During that year, he also made a tour of Europe with his wife. He introduced the Latter-day Saint Prophet, Joseph Smith to President Martin Van Buren when Smith was seeking redress for the grievances that the Latter-day Saints suffered in Missouri. This was done by Reynolds with the hope of winning the votes of the growing number of Latter-day Saints in Illinois in latter political contests.

Reynolds was elected in 1846 for one term as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives from St. Clair County; during this term he caused to be built the first macadamized road in the state, from Belleville to St. Louis. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Illinois Senate in 1848. He was again elected to the Illinois House in 1852, serving as Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives.

He was an unsuccessful candidate for Illinois State Superintendent of Schools in 1858, and then engaged in newspaper work.

In 1860, aged and infirm, Reynolds attended the Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina, as an anti-Douglas delegate, instead supporting John C. Breckinridge in the U.S. presidential election. Against Republican Abraham Lincoln that year, he published his support for Douglas. His correspondence before and during the American Civil War showed a sympathy for secession.

==Personal life==
Reynolds married twice, to Catherine Dubuque in 1817 and to Sarah E. Wilson in 1836, and had no children. He died in Belleville in May 1865, shortly after the Civil War, and his body was laid there in Walnut Hill Cemetery.

<doc id="885730" wikidata="Q1321123" url="?curid=885730" title="Plot twist">
<text>A plot twist is a literary technique that introduces a radical change in the direction or expected outcome of the plot in a work of fiction. When it happens near the end of a story, it is known as a twist ending or surprise ending. It may change the audience&#x27;s perception of the preceding events, or introduce a new conflict that places it in a different context. A plot twist may be foreshadowed, to prepare the audience to accept it, but it usually comes with some element of surprise. There are various methods used to execute a plot twist, such as withholding information from the audience, or misleading them with ambiguous or false information. Not every plot has a twist, but some have multiple lesser ones, and some are defined by a single major twist.

Since the effectiveness of a plot twist usually relies on the audience&#x27;s not having expected it, revealing a plot twist to readers or viewers in advance is commonly regarded as a &quot;spoiler&quot;. Even revealing the fact that a work contains plot twists – especially at the ending – can also be controversial, as it changes the audience&#x27;s expectations. However, at least one study suggests that this does not affect the enjoyment of a work.

Many television series, especially in crime fiction, use plot twists as a theme in every episode and some base their whole premise on the twist; for example, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;.

==Early examples==
An early example of the romance genre with multiple twists was the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; tale &quot;The Three Apples&quot;. It begins with a fisherman discovering a locked chest. The first twist occurs when the chest is broken open and a corpse is found inside. The initial search for the murderer fails, and a twist occurs when two men appear, separately claiming to be the murderer. A complex chain of events finally reveals the murderer to be the investigator&#x27;s own slave.

==Mechanics==

Literary analysts have identified several common categories of plot twists, based on how they are executed.

===Anagnorisis===
&quot;Anagnorisis&quot;, or discovery, is the protagonist&#x27;s sudden recognition of his or her own or another character&#x27;s true identity or nature. Through this technique, previously unforeseen character information is revealed. A notable example of anagnorisis occurs in &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;: Oedipus kills his father and marries his mother in ignorance, learning the truth only toward the climax of the play. The earliest use of this device as a twist ending in a murder mystery was in &quot;The Three Apples&quot;, a medieval &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; tale, where the protagonist Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya discovers by chance a key item towards the end of the story that reveals the culprit behind the murder to have been his own slave all along.

===Flashback===
Flashback, or analepsis, a sudden, vivid reversion to a past event, surprises the reader with previously unknown information that solves a mystery, places a character in a different light, or reveals the reason for a previously inexplicable action. The Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Marnie&quot; employed this type of surprise ending. Sometimes this is combined with the above category, as the flashback may reveal the true identity of one of the characters, or that the protagonist is related to one of the villain&#x27;s past victims, as Sergio Leone did with Charles Bronson&#x27;s character in &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; or Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s &quot;The Odessa File&quot;.

===Cliffhanger===
A cliffhanger or cliffhanger ending, is a plot device in fiction which features a main character in a precarious or difficult dilemma or confronted with a shocking revelation at the end of an episode of serialized fiction. A cliffhanger is hoped to incentivize the audience to return to see how the characters resolve the dilemma. A notable example is in the 1980 Star Wars film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; where protagonist Luke Skywalker who initially believed that the antagonist Darth Vader had killed his father, Anakin after Obi-Wan Kenobi told it to him in &quot;A New Hope&quot; is shocked and horrified when the latter tells him that he himself is his father Anakin, with the revelation eventually being fully dealt with and resolved in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983).

===Unreliable narrator===
An unreliable narrator twists the ending by revealing, almost always at the end of the narrative, that the narrator has manipulated or fabricated the preceding story, thus forcing the reader to question his or her prior assumptions about the text. This motif is often used within noir fiction and films, notably in the film &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;. An unreliable narrator motif was employed by Agatha Christie in &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;, a novel that generated much controversy due to critics&#x27; contention that it was unfair to trick the reader in such a manipulative manner. Another example of unreliable narration is a character who has been revealed to be insane and thus causes the audience to question the previous narrative; notable examples of this are in the Terry Gilliam film &quot;Brazil&quot;, Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s &quot;Fight Club&quot; (and David Fincher&#x27;s film adaptation), Gene Wolfe&#x27;s novel &quot;Book of the New Sun&quot;, the second episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Premonition&quot;, the 1920 German silent horror film &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;, Iain Pears&#x27;s &quot;An Instance of the Fingerpost&quot;, &quot;Shutter Island&quot; and Kim Newman&#x27;s &quot;Life&#x27;s Lottery&quot;. The term &quot;unreliable narrator&quot; is sometimes applied to films (such as the aforementioned &quot;Brazil&quot; and &quot;Shutter Island&quot;) which do not feature any voice-over narration in a conventional sense, but whose protagonists are still considered &quot;narrators&quot; in the sense that the film is presented from their perspective and the audience mainly encounters the narrative and diegesis through that character&#x27;s point of view.

===Peripeteia===
Peripeteia is a sudden reversal of the protagonist&#x27;s fortune, whether for good or ill, that emerges naturally from the character&#x27;s circumstances. Unlike the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; device, peripeteia must be logical within the frame of the story. An example of a reversal for ill would be Agamemnon&#x27;s sudden murder at the hands of his wife Clytemnestra in Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;The Oresteia&quot; or the inescapable situation Kate Hudson&#x27;s character finds herself in at the end of &quot;The Skeleton Key&quot;. This type of ending was a common twist ending utilised by &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, most effectively in the episode &quot;Time Enough at Last&quot; where Burgess Meredith&#x27;s character is robbed of all his hope by a simple but devastating accident with his eyeglasses. A positive reversal of fortune would be Nicholas Van Orton&#x27;s suicide attempt after mistakenly believing himself to have accidentally killed his brother, only to land safely in the midst of his own birthday party, in the film &quot;The Game&quot;.

===&quot;Deus ex machina&quot;===
&quot;Deus ex machina&quot; is a Latin term meaning &quot;god from the machine.&quot; It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot. In Ancient Greek theater, the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; (&#x27;ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός&#x27;) was the character of a Greek god literally brought onto the stage via a crane (μηχανῆς—&quot;mechanes&quot;), after which a seemingly insoluble problem is brought to a satisfactory resolution by the god&#x27;s will. The term is now used pejoratively for any improbable or unexpected contrivance by which an author resolves the complications of the plot in a play or novel, and which has not been convincingly prepared for in the preceding action; the discovery of a lost will was a favorite resort of Victorian novelists.

===Red herring===
A red herring is a false clue intended to lead investigators toward an incorrect solution. This device usually appears in detective novels and mystery fiction. The red herring is a type of , a device intended to distract the protagonist, and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film &quot;&quot; cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as red herrings in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. 

In the bestselling novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, the misdeeds of a key character named &quot;Bishop Aringarosa&quot; draw attention away from the true master villain (&quot;Aringarosa&quot; literally translates as &quot;pink herring&quot;). In the William Diehl novel &quot;Primal Fear&quot; (also adapted into a film), a defendant named Aaron Stampler is accused of brutally murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. He is revealed to have a dissociative identity disorder, and is not executed on plea of insanity. Near the end, Aaron&#x27;s lawyer discovers that he feigned his insanity to avoid the death penalty. Agatha Christie&#x27;s classic &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. 

The complete second timeline of the sixth season of the television series &quot;Lost&quot; is a red herring: initially, this second timeline seems to be an alternate timeline in which Oceanic 815 never crashes (the main timeline revolves around the crashing of such plane on an island). However, one of the last scenes reveals that this timeline is &quot;a place&quot; where the characters of the series meet after they have died, similar to the Bardo or Limbo concept. A red herring can also be used as a form of false foreshadowing.

=== False protagonist ===
A false protagonist is a character presented at the start of the story as the main character, but then disposed of, usually killed to emphasize that they will not return. An example is &quot;Psycho&quot;&#x27;s Marion Crane (portrayed by Janet Leigh), who is brutally murdered about halfway through the film. Another instance is the film &quot;Executive Decision&quot;, in which the special-forces team leader, played by highly-billed action star Steven Seagal, is killed shortly after the mission begins. The character of Casey Becker (played by then A-list actress Drew Barrymore) in &quot;Scream&quot; is killed in the first fifteen minutes. An example in literature and television is Ned Stark in the &quot;Game of Thrones franchise,&quot; who is killed before the end of the first book/season, despite receiving the most focus of the ensemble of characters.

===Non-linear narrative===
A non-linear narrative works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order. This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator Odysseus. &quot;The Aeneid&quot;, another epic poem, uses a similar approach; it begins with the main protagonist, Aeneas, telling stories about the end of the Trojan War and the first half of his journey to Dido, queen of Carthage. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, &quot;Sin City&quot;, &quot;Saw IV&quot;, &quot;Premonition&quot;, &quot;Arrival&quot;, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;Memento&quot;, &quot;Babel&quot;, the television shows &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot;, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Westworld&quot;, the book &quot;Catch-22&quot;, and &quot;WandaVision&quot;.

===Reverse chronology===
Reverse chronology works by revealing the plot in reverse order, i.e., from final event to initial event. Unlike chronological storylines, which progress through causes before reaching a final effect, reverse chronological storylines reveal the final effect before tracing the causes leading up to it; therefore, the initial cause represents a &quot;twist ending&quot;. Examples employing this technique include the films &quot;Irréversible&quot;, &quot;Memento&quot;, &quot;Happy End&quot; and &quot;5x2&quot;, the play &quot;Betrayal&quot; by Harold Pinter, and Martin Amis&#x27; &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow&quot;. Stephen Sondheim and George Furth&#x27;s &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; and the 1934 Kaufman and Hart play that inspired it both tell the story of the main characters in reverse order.

<text>The All-Ireland Senior Football Championship (SFC) () is the premier inter-county competition in Gaelic football. County teams compete against each other and the winner is declared All-Ireland Champions.

Organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), the championship has been contested every year except one since 1887.

The final is played by the 35th Sunday of the year at Croke Park in Dublin, with the winning team receiving the Sam Maguire Cup. For the majority of its existence, the All-Ireland Championship has been played on a straight knockout basis whereby once a team loses they are eliminated from the championship. In more recent years, the qualification procedures for the championship have changed several times. Currently, qualification is limited to teams competing in 6 feeder competitions; the finalists of the 4 provincial championships: Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster, the Tailteann Cup holders and the best non-qualified National Football League teams to make the 16 team group stage.

Thirty three teams currently participate in the All-Ireland Championship, with Kerry, Dublin, Galway and Cavan being the most successful teams in their respective provinces.

The title has been won by 19 different counties, 17 of whom have won the title more than once. The all-time record-holders are Kerry, who have won the championship on 38 occasions. Armagh are the current title holders, defeating Galway by 1–11 to 0–13 in the 2024 final.

==History==
The first Championship to be held featured club teams who represented their respective counties after their county championship. The 21 a-side final was between Commercials of Limerick and Young Irelands of Louth. The final was played in Beech Hill, Donnybrook (not Bird Avenue) on 29 April 1888 with Commercials winning by 1–4 to 0–3. Unlike later All-Ireland competitions, there were no provincial championships, and the result was an open draw.

The second Championship was unfinished owing to the American Invasion Tour. The 1888 provincial championships had been completed (Tipperary, Kilkenny and Monaghan winning them; no Connacht teams entered) but after the Invasion tour returned, the All-Ireland semi-final and final were not played. English team London reached the final four times in the early years of the competition (1900–1903).

In 1892, inter-county teams were introduced to the All-Ireland Championship. Congress granted permission for the winning club to use players from other clubs in the county, thus the inter-county teams came into being. The rules of hurling and football were also altered: goals were made equal to five points, and teams were reduced from 21 to 17 a-side.

The 1903 Championship brought Kerry&#x27;s first All-Ireland title. They went on to become the most successful football team in the history of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.

Unlike in other European countries, such as neighbouring England, where annual sports events were cancelled during the twentieth century due to the First and Second World Wars, the All-Ireland Championship has been running continuously since 1887, with the final running since 1889 (the 1888 competition was played but no final was held due to the Invasion mentioned above). The competition continued even in spite of the effects on the country of the Civil War and the Second World War (the National Football League was not held during the latter). In 1941, the All-Ireland Championship was disrupted by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease but the postponed Leinster final were later rescheduled.

The duration of certain championship matches increased from 60 to 80 minutes during the 1970s. They were settled at 70 minutes after five seasons of this in 1975. This applied only to the provincial finals, All-Ireland semi-finals and finals.

The first half of the twentieth century brought the rise of several teams who won two or more All-Ireland titles in that period, such as Kildare, Mayo, Cavan, Wexford and Roscommon. In the 1990s, a significant sea change took place, as the All-Ireland was claimed by an Ulster team in four consecutive years (1991–1994). Since then Ulster has produced more All-Ireland winning teams than any other province.

The All-Ireland Qualifiers were introduced in 2001. Later that year, the 2001 final brought victory for Galway who became the first football team to win an All-Ireland by springing through &quot;the back door.&quot; In 2013, Hawk-Eye was introduced for Championship matches at Croke Park. It was first used to confirm that Offaly substitute Peter Cunningham&#x27;s attempted point had gone wide 10 minutes into the second half of a game against Kildare. 2013 also brought the first Friday night game in the history of the Championship – a first round qualifier between Carlow and Laois.

In recent years further changes have been made to the structure of the championship. In 2018 the Super 8s were introduced, where the four provincial champions and the four-round 4 qualifier winners would be split into two groups of four teams. Each team plays their group rivals once, with the top two teams progressing to the All-Ireland Semi-Finals. In 2022 a two-tier format will be adopted for the championship. Division 3 and 4 teams from the National Football League that fail to reach a provincial final will not proceed to the All-Ireland qualifiers and will instead play in the Tailteann Cup.

=== Format history ===

==== Historic format (1888–2000) ====
For the first All-Ireland championship in 1887, the competition was played on an open draw knockout basis. From 1888, the provincial system was introduced, whereby the counties in each of Ireland&#x27;s four provinces would play each other on a knockout basis to find provincial champions. These four champions would meet in the All-Ireland semi-finals. The structure outlined above was adopted in 2001 to allow more games to be played, but still retain provincial championships and the knockout structure, resulting in every game continuing to be a meaningful fixture, with no dead-rubber league format matches being played out.

==== Quarter-finals format (2001–2017) ====
From 2001 to 2017, the Championship was played using the Quarter-finals format. Under this format, Provincial matches would take place during the months of May, June and July. The winners of each of the four Provincial Championships would earn a place in the All-Ireland Quarter-Finals, which would take place in the month of August. Replays would be played for all drawn matches, not just drawn Provincial Finals and drawn All-Ireland Finals. Extra-time would only be used for Replays and Qualifier Matches. If the teams were still level after extra time, the qualifier match would go to a replay or in the case of replays, another replay would take place.

The qualifiers series (also referred to as the &quot;back door&quot;) for teams that did not win their provincial championships would take place in the months of June and July with the winning four teams of Round 4 playing the four Provincial Champions in the All-Ireland Quarter Finals.

* All-Ireland Quarter-Finals: The four Provincial Champions would be drawn against the winning four teams from Round 4 of the All-Ireland Qualifiers. If a match finished with both teams level, a replay would take place. The four winning teams qualify for the All-Ireland Semi-Finals.
* All-Ireland Semi-Finals: The All-Ireland Semi-Finals would take place in August and be contested by the four winners of the All-Ireland Quarter Finals. If a match ended with both teams level, a replay would take place. The two winning teams qualify for the All-Ireland Final.
* All-Ireland Final: The two remaining teams would meet in the All-Ireland Final, usually on the third Sunday in September. The winning team is crowned All-Ireland Champions.

==== Single-tier championship format (2018–2019) ====
This championship was identical to the format above, though with no second-tier championship all teams who failed to win their provincial final were eligible to play in the qualifiers. The qualifiers took place over four rounds rather than two, and the four winners of the fourth round proceeded to the All-Ireland Super 8s. As in the format above, the further a team progressed in their provincial championships the later the round they entered the qualifiers. The All-Ireland Super 8s were a round-robin group stage, featuring four teams placed into two groups. The two-highest ranked teams from each group were drawn into an All-Ireland Semi-final, which was followed by the All-Ireland Final.

==== Return to single-elimination format (2020–2022) ====
Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 and 2021 championships returned to the historic single-elimination format. Teams that were eliminated in their provincial championships did not access the qualifiers, which were cancelled, and the &quot;Super 8&#x27;s&quot; were removed in favour of a straight-knockout semi-final and final. In 2022 a smaller back door system took place then Knockout (2001–2017) or Super 8 (2018–2019) there was a knock out Tailteann Cup in 2022 as well.

==== Integration with the league and Tailteann Cup (2023–) ====
In 2023, the format of the championship was again altered. Under this system, approved at a Special Congress of the GAA in February 2022, the results in the National Football League (held in January through to March of each year) would have an impact on counties&#x27; progression in the championship. After the conclusion of the four provincial championships, whose structures remain unaltered, there would be a round-robin competition for 16 teams, split evenly into four. The groups would be made up of the four provincial champions and four runners-up, joined by a further eight teams based on their overall ranking from the league. The four group winners would automatically qualify for the All-Ireland Quarter Finals, and the four remaining spots in the quarter-finals are determined by playoff-matches between the second and third placed teams. The quarter finals, semi-finals and final are then played under the traditional single-elimination format. Furthermore, the 16 teams that fail to qualify for the round-robin stage would compete in the second-tier Tailteann Cup, which is also played via round-robin groups and single-elimination finals.

===== Revamp again for 2026 =====
A potential new format for the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship (SFC) is under consideration[3], with a single alternative structure gaining significant support. The proposal is set to be discussed at a GAA Central Council meeting took place in Donegal on February 22nd 2025. The format, inspired by systems previously used in 16-team county championships, emerged as the most favoured option during a recent consultation process involving GAA counties.

Key Features of the Proposed Format
The alternative format retains the provincial championships and introduces a new pathway for teams advancing to the All-Ireland series. After the completion of the provincial competitions, the eight provincial finalists would join the top seven National Football League teams and the Tailteann Cup winners in the first round of the Sam Maguire Cup. The outcome of this round would determine the placement of teams into two groups: winners and losers.

Quarter-Final Qualification

The winners of the provincial winners&#x27; group would secure direct qualification for the All-Ireland quarter-finals. The remaining quarter-final spots would be contested between the provincial losers’ group winners and the losers of the provincial winners&#x27; group.

Game Structure

The proposed format involves 27 games across six rounds, a reduction from the current 35 games over seven rounds. This streamlining is aimed at easing scheduling pressure and creating a clearer gap between the league and the provincial championships.

Minimum Games Guarantee

Counties would be assured at least three championship games, down from the four currently guaranteed. This will occur in the 2026 season.

== Format ==

=== Counties ===
The county is a geographical region in Ireland, and each of the thirty-two counties in Ireland organise their own Gaelic games affairs through a County Board. The county teams play in their respective Provincial Championships (reflective of the four Irish provinces) in Connacht (which also includes teams from London and New York), Leinster, Munster, and Ulster. Kilkenny is currently unique among the 32 Irish county associations in not participating in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. The Provincial Championships operate through a knock-out cup competition format.

=== Stadia and locations ===
== List of finals ==
Typically, over the four Sundays of September, All-Ireland Finals in men&#x27;s football, ladies&#x27; football, hurling and camogie take place at Croke Park, the national stadium of the GAA. Two grades are played on each final day, the &quot;senior&quot; team and the &quot;minor&quot; team (consisting of younger players, under the age of 18, who have participated in that year&#x27;s All-Ireland Minor Football Championship). Guests who attend these events include the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach and other important dignitaries. The football final is considered the pinnacle event of this period.

The final game of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship takes place on the third Sunday of September. The men&#x27;s decider regularly attracts crowds of over 80,000. The winning team captain receives the Sam Maguire Cup. The current champions are Armagh.

Due to COVID-19 and the related State restrictions, the 2020 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final was staged on Saturday, 19 December, two weeks after the semi-finals.

For the first time since 2000, the football championship was a sudden-death scenario, while the hurling championship – completed on Sunday, 13 December – contained a backdoor format.

===Performances by province===
=== Roll of honour statistics ===

* Although Wexford were the first county to win four consecutive All-Ireland Senior Football Finals (1915–18), historically Kerry has been the most successful football team in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. As of 2023, Kerry has won the competition on 38 occasions, winning in four consecutive years twice (1929–1932 and 1978–1981) and also for three consecutive years twice (1939–1941 and 1984–1986). Dublin follows Kerry on the competition roll of honour with 31 wins, although up to the 1950s much of the success of Dublin teams was based on teams who had many non-Dublin born players playing.
* Dublin joined the &quot;four in a row&quot; club in 2018 by winning the competition consecutively since 2015. As of 2019, Dublin became the first team to win the competition five times in a row. And in 2020, Dublin won a sixth consecutive title. Galway were the first team from the western province of Connacht to win an All-Ireland title, doing so in 1925. The 1933 final brought victory for Cavan, who became the first team from the northern province of Ulster to win an All-Ireland title.
* Two teams have won the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship as part of a double with that year&#x27;s All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, namely Cork (1890 and 1990) and Tipperary (1895 and 1900). The championship has never been won by a team from outside Ireland, though London have played in five finals.
* Armagh are the reigning champions, winning their second ever title, having defeated Galway in the 2024 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final.

<doc id="885736" wikidata="Q285693" url="?curid=885736" title="Hosius of Corduba">
<text>Hosius of Corduba (–359), also known as Hosius the Confessor, Osius or Ossius, was a bishop of Corduba (now Córdoba, Spain) and an important and prominent advocate for Homoousion Christianity during the period when the Arian controversy divided early Christianity.

He probably presided at the First Council of Nicaea and also presided at the Council of Serdica.

After Lactantius, he was the closest Christian advisor to Emperor Constantine the Great and guided the content of public utterances, such as Constantine&#x27;s &quot;Oration to the Saints&quot;, addressed to the assembled bishops.

He is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Church and Oriental churches, with the title of confessor of the faith, being commemorated with a feast day on 27 August.

==Life==
He was born in Corduba in Hispania, a province of the Roman Empire. Elected to the see of Corduba about 295, he narrowly escaped martyrdom in the persecution of Maximian. In 300 or 301 he attended the provincial Synod of Elvira (his name appearing second in the list of those present), and upheld its severe canons concerning such points of discipline as questions concerning clerical marriage, and the treatment of those who had abjured their faith during the recent persecutions. The Council appears to have had Novatianist tendencies and held a strict view that refused readmission to those baptized Christians who had denied their faith or performed the formalities of a ritual sacrifice to the pagan gods under pressures of persecution.
In 313 he appeared at the court of Constantine the Great, mentioned by name in a constitution directed by the emperor to Caecilianus of Carthage in that year. He is not listed among the attendees of the Synod of Arles of 314, but may have been in attendance upon the emperor, who was engaged in his first war with Licinius in Pannonia. As early as 320 or 321 Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, convoked a council at Alexandria at which more than one hundred bishops from Egypt and Libya anathematized Arius, his deacon. In autumn 324 Hosius was the bearer of Constantine&#x27;s letter to Bishop Alexander and Arius, in which he urged them to reconcile. After the Synod in Alexandria, Hosius led another synod in Antioch probably on the occasion of the election of Eustathius, after the death of Philogonius on November 324. In this synod, bishops supporting Arius were suspended and a general synod was announced which would be held in Ancyra. Emperor Constantine eventually moved the convocation to the First Council of Nicaea which opened on 20 May 325. Hosius probably presided over it, as his name appears first on the list of participants. Hosius ostensibly supported Alexander of Alexandria against Arius. After the council, Hosius returned to his diocese in Spain.

For nearly 50 years Hosius was one of the foremost bishops of his time. He was held in universal esteem and exercised great influence. After Constantine&#x27;s death in 337, Eusebius of Nicomedia, an Arian and friend of the Imperial family, was named to the see of Constantinople. In his new role as patriarch, Eusebius and his supporters brought pressure to bear upon Constantius II to expel Athanasius of Alexandria, a staunch anti-Arian, for a second time from his diocese. Eusebius urged the emperor to have Hosius, a supporter of Athanasius, summoned to Milan, where the Bishop of Cordoba declined to condemn Athanasius. Hosius so impressed the emperor that he was authorized to return home.

Hosius had a prominent role to play at the Council of Serdica, which began in the summer, or, at latest, in the autumn of 343, proved by the fact that he was the first to sign the Acts of this council.

Continued pressure from Eusebius led to Constantius&#x27; writing a letter demanding whether Hosius alone was going to remain obstinate in his support of Athanasius. In reply, Hosius sent his courageous letter of protest against imperial interference in Church affairs (353), preserved by Athanasius which led to Hosius&#x27; exile in 355 to Sirmium, an imperial center in Pannonia (in modern Serbia). From his exile he wrote to Constantius II his only extant composition, a letter justly characterized by the French historian Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont as displaying gravity, dignity, gentleness, wisdom, generosity and in fact all the qualities of a great soul and a great bishop.

Subjected to continual pressure from the Eusebian party, Hosius signed the homoean formula adopted by the Third Council of Sirmium in 357, which involved communion with the homoeans (Acacians) but not the condemnation of Athanasius. He was then permitted to return to his Hispanic diocese, where he died in 359.

There is a letter from Pope Liberius to him from .

<doc id="885739" wikidata="Q160653" url="?curid=885739" title="Listeriosis">
<text>Listeriosis is a bacterial infection most commonly caused by &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, although &quot;L. ivanovii&quot; and &quot;L. grayi&quot; have been reported in certain cases. Listeriosis can cause severe illness, including severe sepsis, meningitis, or encephalitis, sometimes resulting in lifelong harm and even death. Those at risk of severe illness are the elderly, fetuses, newborns, and those who are immunocompromised. In pregnant women, it may cause stillbirth or spontaneous abortion, and preterm birth is common. Listeriosis may cause mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis and fever in anyone.

&quot;Listeria&quot; is ubiquitous and is primarily transmitted via the oral route after ingestion of contaminated food products, after which the bacteria penetrates the intestinal tract to cause systemic infections. The diagnosis of listeriosis requires the isolation of the causative bacteria from the blood or the cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment includes prolonged administration of antibiotics, primarily ampicillin and gentamicin, to which the organism is usually susceptible.

==Signs and symptoms==

The disease primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, pregnant women, and newborns. Rarely, people without these risk factors can also be affected. A person with listeriosis usually has fever and muscle aches, often preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. Almost everyone who is diagnosed with listeriosis has an invasive infection, meaning that the bacteria spread from their intestines to their bloodstream or other body sites. The disease may occur as long as two months after eating contaminated food.

The symptoms vary with the infected person:
* High-risk people other than pregnant women: Symptoms can include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions.
* Pregnant women: Pregnant women typically experience only a mild, flu-like illness. However, infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn.
* Previously healthy people: People who were previously healthy but were exposed to a very large dose of &quot;Listeria&quot; can develop a noninvasive illness in which the bacteria do not spread into their bloodstream or other body sites. Symptoms can include diarrhea and fever.

If an animal has eaten food contaminated with &quot;Listeria&quot; and does not have any symptoms, most experts believe that no tests or treatment are needed, even for people at high risk for listeriosis.

==Cause==
&quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; is ubiquitous in the environment. The main route of acquisition of &quot;Listeria&quot; is through the ingestion of contaminated food products. &quot;Listeria&quot; has been isolated from raw meat, dairy products, vegetables, fruit, and seafood. Soft cheeses, unpasteurized milk and unpasteurised pâté are potential dangers; however, some outbreaks involving post-pasteurized milk have been reported.

Rarely listeriosis may present as cutaneous listeriosis. This infection occurs after direct exposure to &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; by intact skin and is largely confined to veterinarians who are handling diseased animals, most often after a listerial abortion.

It can be more common in patients with hemochromatosis.

&quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; is believed to enter the host cells once it reaches the gastrointestinal tract within the human body. The pathogen recognizes eukaryotic receptors on the surface of a host cell and enters the cell through phagocytosis. The pathogen then resides in phagocytic vacuoles, or phagosomes, until it enters the cytoplasm by disrupting the phagosome membrane. Within the cytoplasm, the bacteria replicate and then initiate what is called an actin propulsion system, or host cell actin polymerization to penetrate neighboring host cells. This system allows the bacteria to utilize actin from the host cell to adhere to the cell surface, protrude through the cell surface forming a pseudopod, and penetrate the neighboring cells. This penetrating pseudopod is taken up into the neighboring cell through phagocytosis, a transient double-membrane phagosome is formed around it, then the bacteria escapes from the phagosome and begins the cycle again. It is at this stage that the patient may experience febrile gastroenteritis. As the disease continues to escalate, bacteremia occurs when the &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; that enter host cells within the gastrointestinal tract enter the bloodstream and translocate to other major organs of the body. In healthy individuals, &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; bacterium in the bloodstream are taken up by macrophages and eliminated from the body, however, in immunocompromised individuals the pathogen permeates through the body, inducing numerous conditions leading to the fatal nature of listeriosis infection. In the liver, this condition causes subclinical pyogranulomatous hepatitis, in the central nervous system this causes meningoencephalitis, in pregnant individuals this causes placentitis, and the state of bacteremia escalates to sepsis.

&quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; is classified in the phylum Actinobacteria and is of the order Bacillales with other gram-positive, low GC content and facultative anaerobic bacteria. Besides the genus &quot;Listeria&quot;, the genera &quot;Bacillus&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; also exist in this order, indicating that species within these genera are closely related. These genera contain other severe disease-causing bacterium such as &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot; (anthrax) and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA).  

==Diagnosis==

In CNS infection cases, &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; can often be cultured from the blood or from the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid).

==Prevention==
The main means of prevention is through the promotion of safe handling, cooking, and consumption of food. This includes washing raw vegetables and cooking raw food thoroughly, as well as reheating leftover or ready-to-eat foods like hot dogs until steaming hot.

Another aspect of prevention is advising high-risk groups such as pregnant women and immunocompromised patients to avoid unpasteurized pâtés and foods such as soft cheeses like feta, Brie, Camembert cheese, and bleu. Cream cheeses, yogurt, and cottage cheese are considered safe. In the United Kingdom, advice along these lines from the Chief Medical Officer posted in maternity clinics led to a sharp decline in cases of listeriosis in pregnancy in the late 1980s.

Another method of controlling the presence of the Listeriosis-causing pathogen &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; is by spraying foods with the additive product Listex P100 bacteriophage, which infects and kills the cells through what is called the lytic cycle, eliminating that pathogen from the food. Many food production companies spray their products with this bacteriophage before packaging because it does not alter the flavor, color, or quality of the food. Studies have shown that Listex P100 is successful at eliminating &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; from raw salmon fillet tissue, catfish fillets, fruit, surface-ripened soft cheese, hot dogs, cooked and slices of turkey breast meat, smoked salmon, mixed seafood, chocolate milk, mozzarella cheese brine, iceberg lettuce, cabbage, and sausage. In addition, no genetic resistance to P100 phage has been reported from present studies on Listeria isolates. 

==Treatment==
Bacteremia should be treated for 2 weeks, meningitis for 3 weeks, and brain abscess for at least 6 weeks. Ampicillin generally is considered antibiotic of choice; gentamicin is added frequently for its synergistic effects. The overall mortality rate is 20–30%; of all pregnancy-related cases, 22% resulted in fetal loss or neonatal death, but mothers usually survive.

==Epidemiology==

Incidence in 2004–2005 was 2.5–3 cases per million population a year in the United States, where pregnant women accounted for 30% of all cases.
 Of all non-perinatal infections, 70% occur in immunocompromised patients. Incidence in the U.S. has been falling since the 1990s, in contrast to Europe where changes in eating habits have led to an increase during the same time. In the EU, it has stabilized at around 5 cases per annum per million population, although the rate in each country contributing data to EFSA/ECDC varies greatly.

There are four distinct clinical syndromes:
* Infection in pregnancy: &quot;Listeria&quot; can proliferate asymptomatically in the vagina and uterus. If the mother becomes symptomatic, it is usually in the third trimester. Symptoms include fever, myalgias, arthralgias and headache. Miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm labor are complications of this infection. Symptoms last 7–10 days.
* Neonatal infection (granulomatosis infantiseptica): There are two forms. One, an early-onset sepsis, with &quot;Listeria&quot; acquired in utero, results in premature birth. &quot;Listeria&quot; can be isolated in the placenta, blood, meconium, nose, ears, and throat. Another, late-onset meningitis is acquired through vaginal transmission, although it also has been reported with caesarean deliveries.
* Central nervous system (CNS) infection (neurolisteriosis): &quot;Listeria&quot; has a predilection for the brain parenchyma, especially the brain stem, and the meninges. It can cause cranial nerve palsies, encephalitis, meningitis, meningoencephalitis and abscesses. Mental status changes are common. Seizures occur in at least 25% of patients.
* Gastroenteritis: &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; can produce food-borne diarrheal disease, which typically is noninvasive. The median incubation period is 21 days, with diarrhea lasting anywhere from 1–3 days. Affected people present with fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal nausea or diarrhea, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions.

&quot;Listeria&quot; has also been reported to colonize the hearts of some patients. The overall incidence of cardiac infections caused by &quot;Listeria&quot; is relatively low, with 7–10% of case reports indicating some form of heart involvement. There is some evidence that small subpopulations of clinical isolates are more capable of colonizing the heart throughout the infection, but cardiac manifestations are usually sporadic and may rely on a combination of bacterial factors and host predispositions, as they do with other strains of cardiotropic bacteria.

==Notable outbreaks==
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are about 1,600 cases of listeriosis annually in the United States. Compared to 1996–1998, the incidence of listeriosis had declined by about 38% by 2003. However, illnesses and deaths continue to occur. On average from 1998 to 2008, 2.4 outbreaks per year were reported to the CDC. Some notable ones are listed below.

=== 2002 United States outbreak ===
A large outbreak occurred in 2002, when 54 illnesses, 8 deaths, and 3 fetal deaths in 9 states were found to be associated with the consumption of contaminated turkey deli meat.

=== 2008 Canadian listeriosis outbreak ===
An outbreak of listeriosis in Canada linked to a Maple Leaf Foods plant in Toronto, Ontario killed 22 people.

=== 2011 United States listeriosis outbreak ===
On September 14, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned consumers not to eat cantaloupes shipped by Jensen Farms from Granada, Colorado due to a potential link to a multi-state outbreak of listeriosis. At that time Jensen Farms voluntarily recalled cantaloupes shipped from July 29 through September 10, and distributed to at least 17 states with possible further distribution.

On September 26, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a total of 72 persons had been infected with the four outbreak-associated strains of &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; which had been reported to the CDC from 18 states. All illnesses started on or after July 31, 2011.

On September 30, 2011, a random sample of romaine lettuce taken by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration tested positive for listeria on lettuce shipped on September 12 and 13 by an Oregon distributor to at least two other states—Washington and Idaho.

By October 18, the CDC reported that 12 states were linked to listeria in cantaloupe and that 123 people had been sickened. A final count on December 8 put the death toll at 30: Colorado (8), Indiana (1), Kansas (3), Louisiana (2), Maryland (1), Missouri (3), Nebraska (1), New Mexico (5), New York (2), Oklahoma (1), Texas (2), and Wyoming (1). Among persons who died, ages ranged from 48 to 96 years, with a median age of 82.5 years. In addition, one woman pregnant at the time of illness had a miscarriage.

=== 2015 United States listeriosis outbreak ===
On March 13, 2015, the CDC announced that state and local health officials, CDC, and Food and Drug Administration were collaborating to investigate an outbreak of listeriosis in Kansas. The joint investigation found that certain Blue Bell Creameries ice cream products, including bars, scoops and cookies, were the likely source for some or all of these illnesses. Upon further investigation, the CDC said Blue Bell ice cream had evidence of &quot;Listeria&quot; bacteria in its Oklahoma manufacturing plant as far back as March 2013. The outbreak led to 3 deaths in Kansas.

Blue Bell was the nation&#x27;s third most popular ice cream brand. The items came from the company&#x27;s production facility in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. The CDC stated that all five of the sickened individuals, including the three older people who died, were receiving treatment at the same Kansas hospital before developing the listeriosis, suggesting their infections with the &quot;Listeria&quot; bacteria were nosocomial (acquired, while eating the products, in the hospital). Their pre-existing weakened conditions might help to explain the higher mortality rate in these cases (60%, versus the more normal 20–30%).

On April 20, 2015, Blue Bell issued a voluntary recall of all its products, citing further internal testing that found &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; in an additional half gallon of ice cream from the Brenham facility.

=== 2015–18 European listeriosis outbreak ===
On 5 July 2018 the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; reported that at least four major supermarket retailers had issued major product recalls as a result of a large supplier confirming possible contamination of frozen vegetables sourced from Hungary. The supplier, Greenyard Frozen UK, reported to the UK&#x27;s Food Standards Agency that the factory in which the food was processed had been shut down by the Hungarian Food Chain Safety Office, after which the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued updates stating that at least five EU member states (UK, Austria, Denmark, Finland and Sweden) were affected. Between June 2015 and July 2018, 9 people had reportedly died as a result of listeriosis, of a total of 47 confirmed cases.

In an update on the EFSA website, it was stated that the contamination had supposedly been present since at least 2015, and as a result, the Hungarian Food Chain Safety Office had prohibited the marketing of all affected frozen vegetables and frozen vegetable packs produced by the plant in Baja between August 2016 and June 2018. This followed a previous study that found the majority of &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; isolates had been found in a 2017 sample of various frozen vegetables, with a minority found in a 2016 sample and a small number found in a 2018 sample. The study suggested that the strain identified (&quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; serogroup IVb, multi-locus sequence type 6 (ST6)) was likely persisting through standard cleaning operations and disinfection procedures, and that since common production lines were in operation, cross-contamination was an additional concern.

=== 2017–18 South African listeriosis outbreak ===

In early December 2017, an outbreak of listeriosis was reported by the South African Department of Health. As of 4 March 2018, with 967 people infected and 180 deaths, this was the largest listeriosis outbreak in history. The source was traced to processed meat products produced at a Tiger Brands Enterprise plant in Polokwane.

=== 2018 Australia listeriosis outbreaks ===

On 2 March 2018, the New South Wales Food Authority confirmed that investigations into a listeriosis outbreak in rockmelons (cantaloupes) began in January. The cantaloupes had infected people from Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania, after being grown on a farm in the Riverina region of NSW.

As of 2 March 2018, 13 of 15 cases had been confirmed as originating from listeria-infected cantaloupes, and of the 15 people infected, 3 had died. Later victims included a fourth person on 7 March and a Victorian man in his 80s on 16 March. A miscarriage was also linked to listeriosis. Seventeen cases had been confirmed as of 7 March.

In July 2018, a number of countries, including Australia, issued recalls of frozen vegetables due to &quot;Listeria&quot;.

=== 2019 Spain listeriosis outbreak ===
In August 2019, an outbreak was declared in several provinces in Andalusia, southern Spain, as a result of the consumption of a contaminated batch of processed meat products. As of 19 August 2019, 80 people had been diagnosed and 56 were hospitalized (43 of them in the province of Seville),
As of 20 August, 114 people were diagnosed, 18 pregnant women in hospital, and the first confirmed death (a 90-year-old woman);

although the total figure of hospitalized reduced to 53. In addition, eight miscarriages have been related to the outbreak. Spanish Minister of Health María Luisa Carcedo declared that the outbreak had expanded out of the Andalusian Autonomous Community, with one confirmed case in Extremadura and five suspected cases in Extremadura and Madrid. The Minister specified that, although new cases could appear as a consequence of the long incubation period, the contaminated product had been withdrawn. As of 21 August 2019, 132 people were diagnosed and 23 pregnant women in hospital. On 22 August an international alert was declared.

=== 2022 United States listeriosis outbreak ===
On November 9, 2022, the CDC announced that &quot;Listeria&quot; in deli meats and cheeses had been linked to at least 16 cases of listeriosis, including 13 hospitalizations and 1 death. Cases were known from Maryland, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey and California.

=== 2024 Canadian listeriosis outbreak ===
In July 2024, listeriosis was found in contaminated Silk and Walmart Great Value brand nut milks and a mandatory recall was issued. As of August 12, 2024, the Public Health Agency of Canada has linked &quot;Listeria&quot; in nut milk products to at least 20 cases of listeriosis, including 3 deaths in Ontario between August 2023 and July 2024.

=== 2024 United States listeriosis outbreak ===

In 2024, 59 people in the United States fell ill, and 10 died, due to an outbreak associated with deli meats.
=== 2024 United States listeriosis outbreak ===

In 2024, 6 people in the United States were hospitalized, and 3 died, due to an outbreak associated with an improperly cleaned ice cream machine used to make milkshakes at a burger restaurant.

<text>The Ananke group is a group of retrograde irregular satellites of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Ananke and are thought to have a common origin.

Their semi-major axes (distances from Jupiter) range between 19.2 and 21.8 Gm, their orbital inclinations between 144.3° and 155.5°, and their orbital eccentricities between 0.09 and 0.30.

The members of the Ananke group are:
The International Astronomical Union (IAU) reserves names ending in -e for all retrograde moons, including this group&#x27;s members.

==Origin==
The Ananke group is believed to have been formed when an asteroid was captured by Jupiter and subsequently fragmented by a collision. This belief is founded on the fact that the dispersion of the mean orbital parameters of the core members is very small and can be accounted for by a small velocity impulse (15 &lt; δV &lt; 80 m/s), compatible with a single collision and breakup.

Based on the sizes of the satellites, the original asteroid may have been about 28 km in diameter. Since this value is near the approximate diameter of Ananke itself, it is likely the parent body was not heavily disrupted. 

Available photometric studies put this in doubt, however, and suggest that secular resonance has mixed the Ananke and Pasiphae groups: three of the moons of the former family (Harpalyke, Praxidike and Iocaste) display similar grey colours (average colour indices: B−V = 0.77 and V−R = 0.42) while Ananke itself is on the boundary between grey and light red.

<doc id="885757" wikidata="Q941481" url="?curid=885757" title="Jean Hardouin">
<text>Jean Hardouin (; ; ; 23 December 1646 – 3 September 1729), was a French priest and classical scholar who was well known during his lifetime for his editions of ancient authors, and for writing a history of the ecumenical councils. However, he is best remembered now as the originator of a variety of unorthodox theories, especially his opinion that a 14th Century conspiracy forged practically all literature traditionally believed to have been written before that era. He also denied the genuineness of most ancient works of art, coins, and inscriptions. Hardouin&#x27;s eccentric ideas led to the placement of a number of his works on the Index of Forbidden Books.

Although Hardouin has been called &quot;pathological&quot; and &quot;mad,&quot; he was only an extreme example of a general critical trend of his time, following authors like Baruch Spinoza, Thomas Hobbes or Jean Daillé, who had started to identify and discard mistaken attributions or datings of medieval documents or Church writings.

== Biography ==
He was born at Quimper in Brittany. Having acquired a taste for literature in his father&#x27;s book-shop, he sought and obtained admission into the order of the Jesuits in around 1662 (when he was 16). In Paris, where he went to study theology. He ultimately became librarian of the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in 1683, and he died there.

His first published work was an edition of Themistius (1684), which included no fewer than thirteen new orations. On the advice of Jean Garnier (1612–1681) he undertook to edit the &quot;Natural History&quot; of Pliny for the Dauphin series, a task which he completed in five years. Aside from editorial work, he became interested in numismatics, and published several learned works on this subject, all marked by a determination to be different from other interpreters. When a fellow Jesuit once spoke to Hardouin about the shock his &quot;paradoxes and absurdities&quot; had given to the public, Hardouin brusquely replied, &quot;do you think I would have got up at 4 AM all my life just to say what others have already said before me?&quot; His works on this topic include: &quot;Nummi antiqui populorum et urbium illustrati&quot; (1684), &quot;Antirrheticus de nummis antiquis coloniarum et municipiorum&quot; (1689), and &quot;Chronologia Veteris Testamenti ad vulgatam versionem exacta et nummis illustrata&quot; (1696).

Hardouin was appointed by the ecclesiastical authorities to supervise the &quot;Conciliorum collectio regia maxima&quot; (1715); but he was accused of suppressing important documents and including apocryphal ones, and by the order of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris (then in conflict with the Jesuits) the publication of the work was delayed. After his death, a collection of works &quot;Opera varia&quot; appeared in Amsterdam in 1733. René-Joseph de Tournemine remarked in a review of this volume that if the anonymous editors had truly loved Hardouin, they would have left these works unpublished, and that that is what Hardouin&#x27;s friend Pierre Daniel Huet would have done, who once said that Hardouin had laboured for forty years to ruin his own reputation without being able to accomplish it.

== Ideology ==
===Concept of atheism===
In 17th Century France, the term &quot;atheism&quot; was frequently applied in a broad sense not only to those who denied or questioned the existence of God, but also to those who entertained erroneous ideas of the nature of God, denied God&#x27;s providential government of the world or the existence of an afterlife with rewards and punishments, rejected Christianity, rejected sound Christian theology, or led immoral lives. The most noteworthy work which appeared in the 1733 &quot;Opera varia&quot; was Hardouin&#x27;s &quot;Athei detecti&quot; (&quot;The Atheists Exposed&quot;), in which the atheists in question were Cornelius Jansen, André Martin, Louis Thomassin, Nicolas Malebranche, Pasquier Quesnel, Antoine Arnauld, Pierre Nicole, Blaise Pascal, René Descartes, Antoine Le Grand, and Pierre-Sylvain Régis. According to Hardouin, classical philosophical theology which identified God with transcendentals such as &quot;being&quot; and &quot;truth,&quot; or as &quot;infinitely perfect being,&quot; was atheistic. The &quot;Athei detecti&quot; was followed by an afterword titled &quot;Réfléxions importantes&quot; in which Hardouin undertook to demonstrate that atheism and Cartesianism are one and the same.

===Biblical theories===
Contrary to the received view that the Latin Vulgate edition of the New Testament was translated from the extant Greek text, Hardouin argued that all the books of the New Testament were originally written in Latin, or at least were translated into Latin with the approval of the authors from Hebrew or Greek originals which have been lost. Hardouin also argued that Jesus Christ himself spoke Latin on a daily basis, interpreting passages in the Gospels where Jesus&#x27; very words are recorded in Aramaic to indicate that this was not the language which he usually spoke.

In an essay published in 1708, later reprinted as an appendix to his commentary on the New Testament, Hardouin explained his interpretation of the incident at Antioch. According to the Gospels, Jesus gave his disciple Simon son of Jonah a new name given in Aramaic and Greek versions as &quot;Cephas&quot; and &quot;Peter.&quot; Paul the Apostle writes in the Epistle to the Galatians of a time when &quot;Cephas&quot; came to Antioch, and Paul rebuked him to his face. Most ancient and modern commentators on this passage have taken for granted that the man who was rebuked is the Cephas who was one of the twelve disciples and is also called Peter. However, motivated by Protestant and Jansenist polemicists&#x27; use of the incident at Antioch as an objection against the supremacy and infallibility of Peter (and therefore of the pope as Peter&#x27;s successor), Hardouin defends the opinion expressed by a few ancient authors that Paul rebuked another man who happened to also be named Cephas. Albert Pighius had earlier defended the same position. In the fifth and sixth chapters of his essay, Hardouin went so far as to assert that if one grants that Peter was rebuked by Paul, it would follow that Peter was guilty of heresy, and all faith in the sacred scriptures would be upset. This excess of zeal led to the placement of the commentary on the Index.

 argued against Hardouin&#x27;s thesis. Augustin Calmet, O.S.B., agreed with Boileau, and Francesco Antonio Zaccaria cites several other Catholic and Protestant authors who wrote against Hardouin, one of whom branded Hardouin&#x27;s opinion with the theological censures of &quot;error, temerity, insipidity, childishness, and imprudence.&quot; Most Catholic theologians of the 18th and 19th centuries followed Pighius and Hardouin. This position had fallen out of favour among Catholic exegetes by the 20th Century, but has been defended by Clemens M. Henze, C.Ss.R., as recently as 1958.

Most recent critical scholarship on the New Testament has remained dismissive of a distinction between Peter and Cephas. Bart Ehrman defended the opinion that Peter and Cephas were different people in a 1990 article, which was rebutted by Dale Allison. Ehrman has more recently expressed doubts about the opinion he defended in his article, especially because of Allison&#x27;s point that it is improbable that two prominent figures in the early Christian community both had the name Peter/Cephas, as there is only one recorded instance of the use of Cephas as a personal name, and no evidence of the use of Peter as a personal name, prior to the Christian tradition of Jesus&#x27; assignment of this name to Simon.

===Views on ancient and medieval literature===
Hardouin recalled that in August 1690, he began to suspect some of the works of St Augustine of Hippo and his contemporaries of being inauthentic, and by May 1692 he had &quot;uncovered everything.&quot; Hardouin came to believe that for the first thirteen hundred years of Christianity, Christian doctrine had been handed down by an unwritten oral tradition, and books on theology had not been written; in the 14th century, all of the works of the Church Fathers as well as the medieval Scholastics had been counterfeited by &quot;atheist&quot; monks under the direction of a certain &quot;Severus Archontius&quot; for the sake of introducing heresy into the Church.

Accordingly, Hardouin believed the entire history of the Church from Pope Linus to the invention of the printing press to be fictitious; when asked Hardouin why he had written his history of the ecumenical councils despite believing that none of the councils prior to the Council of Trent had taken place, he replied, &quot;God and I only know.&quot;

Hardouin also believed that nearly all ancient secular literature was likewise manufactured to support the fraud, as he first publicly intimated in his work &quot;On the Coins of the Herods,&quot; writing, &quot;let me propose here the conjecture of a man who has always been no silly inventor of conjectures, yet now perhaps is more suspicious than is reasonable and too greatly indulging his own cleverness. Let everyone take it for what he will. He has discovered—as he lately was whispering to me—that a band of certain men existed I know not how many centuries ago, who took up the task of composing ancient history as we now have it, because none of it existed then; he knows well what their era and their workshop were; and for this affair they had the help of Cicero, Pliny the Elder, Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics,&quot; and Horace&#x27; &quot;Satires&quot; and &quot;Epistles;&quot; for he thinks that these, as I fear he will persuade no-one, are the only authentic monuments out of Latin antiquity, except for a very few inscriptions, and some of the &quot;fasti.&quot;&quot; According to Hardouin, all other pre-modern literature was written in the same style of Greek or of Latin, far inferior to the style of the few genuine classical authors, which proved that all these works were composed in the same era, and he took any factual contradictions with the works he admitted as genuine as proof of the forgers&#x27; ignorance.

Tournemine composed a work titled &quot;Twelve Impossibilities of Father Hardouin&#x27;s System&quot; which is now lost. In 1707, launched an investigation into Hardouin&#x27;s system at the behest of the Jesuit Superior General, Michelangelo Tamburini. Nearly a dozen Jesuits wrote to Tamburini, all opining that Hardouin&#x27;s ideas were so dangerous to the Society of Jesus and the Catholic Church as to warrant their suppression.

Maturin Veyssière La Croze, a Protestant author, assailed Hardouin&#x27;s system in a work written in French, and then another printed in Latin. La Croze interpreted Hardouin&#x27;s &quot;Severus Archontius&quot; as a thinly veiled reference to Frederick II. Hardouin&#x27;s &quot;Opera selecta&quot; published at Amsterdam in 1708 presented his system to the public in its clearest form yet.

The publication of the &quot;Opera selecta&quot; forced Hardouin&#x27;s superiors to make their disapproval of his system public. In February 1709, a &quot;Declaration&quot; appeared in the &quot;Mémoires pour l&#x27;Histoire des Sciences &amp; des beaux-Arts&quot; (generally known as the &quot;Journal de Trévoux&quot;) signed by Le Tellier and the superiors of the Jesuit houses in Paris, and attesting to Tamburini&#x27;s approval of the statement as well, in which they said that the Amsterdam edition contained works they wished had never seen the light of day or would fall into oblivion. In particular, the signers wrote, &quot;we reject as pernicious the paradox of the inauthenticity of the Greek text of Scripture, of the works of the Greek Fathers and of the Latin Fathers, and of other ecclesiastical monuments commonly recognised in the Church as genuine.&quot; They also regarded Hardouin&#x27;s ideas on the dating of secular works of literature as &quot;an unsustainable chimera,&quot; and especially condemned Hardouin&#x27;s denial of the antiquity of secular works which were quoted by the Church Fathers. The declaration was followed by a statement signed by Hardouin himself, writing, &quot;I sincerely subscribe to the whole content of the above declaration; in good faith, I condemn in my works what it condemns in them; and in particular, what I had said about an impious faction which some centuries ago had fabricated most ecclesiastical or secular works, which had passed up to now as ancient.&quot; Hardouin promised never to say anything either by spoken word or in writing which would be either directly or indirectly contrary to the retraction.

The Amsterdam edition was afterwards printed with an added &quot;protestation&quot; by Hardouin to the effect that the edition was unauthorised and unrevised by him; Hardouin also stressed La Croze&#x27; concession that Hardouin had not yet &quot;explicitly proposed&quot; that the Greek and Latin Fathers were inauthentic, and accused La Croze of attacking &quot;not what he saw in my books, but what he believed himself to see there.&quot; Hardouin protested that he believed nothing about either the Greek or the Latin Fathers but what &quot;the Roman Church, the most learned critics, and the ablest Catholic theologians&quot; believed, and as for secular authors, he only believed, as the best critics do, that among authors who are authentically ancient there are some whose date one can reasonably doubt, but if Hardouin&#x27;s thoughts had been peculiar, he says it would be a flagrant injustice to attribute them to the Society of Jesus as a group. Hardouin&#x27;s protestation was followed by a reply from the printer insisting that he had faithfully printed these works as they came to him, and while he had offered to supplement the edition with any retraction or correction Hardouin wished to add, or sell the edition to another printer for the cost of his expenses, he would not alter the text as it stood, because his sales would be harmed if readers perceived the edition to be incomplete.

Despite Hardouin&#x27;s public retraction, it is evident that Hardouin continued to hold the same ideas, as he expounded them further in his &quot;Ad censuram scriptorum veterum prolegomena&quot; which were certainly written after 1714, judging by their references to an episcopal pastoral letter of 1712 and to Hardouin&#x27;s own &quot;Conciliorum collectio.&quot; In the &quot;Prolegomena,&quot; Hardouin also admits the authenticity of Plautus and of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues,&quot; and identifies the only extant works of ancient Greek literature as the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the histories of Herodotus, but strikes Cicero from his list, saying that his works also were composed by the conspirators. Upon their publication in 1766, the &quot;Prolegomena&quot; were savagely reviewed by Christian Adolph Klotz, who sarcastically wrote that his own time was so lacking in bad books and foolish men that it had proven necessary to wipe off the dust in which Hardouin&#x27;s manuscript deservingly laid and deliver it to men who had never asked or looked for it.

Though admitting the authenticity of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot; and &quot;Eclogues,&quot; Hardouin devoted a special treatise to discrediting the authenticity of the &quot;Aeneid.&quot; Likewise, though Hardouin admitted the authenticity of Horace&#x27; &quot;Epistles&quot; and &quot;Satires,&quot; he composed a work purportedly demonstrating the spuriousness of the &quot;Odes,&quot; the &quot;Epodes,&quot; the &quot;Carmen saeculare,&quot; and the &quot;Ars poetica.&quot;

In a four-volume manuscript critical discussion of the &quot;Summa theologiae,&quot; Hardouin denied St Thomas Aquinas&#x27; authorship of the work, which he said was written by an atheist, and questioned the existence of Aquinas himself. Hardouin perceived anachronisms and heterodoxy in the &quot;Divine Comedy,&quot; which he believed had been falsely attributed to Dante Alighieri by its true author, a follower of John Wycliffe. Hardouin also detected heresy in the putative works of one of the most respected Jesuit theologians, St Robert Bellarmine; Hardouin declared Bellarmine&#x27;s commentary on the Psalms the work of a godless man, and believed it was a work of Severus Archontius&#x27; monks which remained unpublished before Bellarmine was tricked into allowing it to be published under his name. Hardouin ascribed a similar origin to Bellarmine&#x27;s devotional works &quot;On the Eternal Felicity of the Saints,&quot; &quot;The Groaning of the Dove,&quot; &quot;The Mind&#x27;s Ascent to God,&quot; &quot;The Seven Words of the Lord,&quot; and &quot;The Art of Dying Well,&quot; as well as the hymn &quot;Pater superni luminis,&quot; and he also denied the authenticity of Bellarmine&#x27;s &quot;Controversies on the Sacraments.&quot;

In the 1713–4 Boyle Lectures, Benjamin Ibbot cited Hardouin&#x27;s belief in the spuriousness of nearly all ancient literature as an example to demonstrate that the opinion of one prestigious author in the face of an otherwise universal consensus did not lend credibility to such patently absurd ideas.

The historian Isaac-Joseph Berruyer had his &quot;Histoire du peuple de Dieu&quot; condemned for having followed this theory, which has a modern heir in the Russian mathematician Anatoly Timofeevich Fomenko, whose conclusions being based on proprietary methods of statistical textual analysis and computational astronomy are even more radical, but considered to be pseudoscientific.

<text>John Hazard Reynolds (June 21, 1819September 24, 1875) was an American attorney and politician from New York. He was most notable for his service as a United States representative from New York, serving one term from 1859 to 1861.

==Early life==
John H. Reynolds was born in Moreau, New York on June 21, 1819, the fourth child of Luthena (Potter) Reynolds farmer and lumberman George Reynolds. He attended the public schools of Sandy Hill, New York (now Hudson Falls) and Bennington, Vermont. Reynolds engaged in civil engineering and took part in the construction of the Saratoga and Whitehall Railroad and Boston and Albany Railroad. He then returned to school at the Kinderhook Academy, from which he graduated in 1840. Reynolds studied law with attorney William H. Tobey of Kinderhook, was admitted to the bar, and began to practice as Tobey&#x27;s partner in 1843.

==Career==
Reynolds moved to Albany in 1851, where he practiced law in partnership with John V. L. Pruyn. In 1854, he began a partnership with Clark B. Cochrane and Hamilton Harris.

=== Congress ===
Reynolds was a Democrat opposed to the expansion of slavery. During the Bleeding Kansas controversy, Reynolds ran successfully for a seat in the United States House of Representatives as an Anti-Lecompton Democrat. He served in the 36th Congress, March 4, 1859 to March 3, 1861. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1860.

=== Later career ===
After leaving Congress, Reynolds resumed practicing law in Albany. After Cochrane&#x27;s 1867 death, Reynolds and Harris continued to practice as partners. In 1873, Reynolds was appointed a commissioner of the New York Court of Appeals.

==Death and burial==
Reynolds died in Kinderhook on September 24, 1875. He was buried at Kinderhook Cemetery in Kinderhook.

==Family==
In 1843, Reynolds married Margaret Ann Whiting. They were the parents of six children: Charles Whiting: William H. Tobey; George; John H. Jr.; James Adger; and Margaret Whiting.

<text>Themistius ( ; 317 – c. 388 AD), nicknamed Euphrades (, &quot;eloquent&quot;), was a statesman, rhetorician and philosopher. He flourished in the reigns of Constantius II, Julian, Jovian, Valens, Gratian and Theodosius I, and he enjoyed the favour of all those emperors, notwithstanding their many differences and the fact that he himself was not a Christian. He was admitted to the senate by Constantius in 355, and he was prefect of Constantinople in 384 on the nomination of Theodosius. Of his many works, thirty-three orations of his have come down to us, as well as various commentaries and epitomes of the works of Aristotle.

==Early life==
Themistius was born in Paphlagonia and taught at the Colchian Academy in Phasis. Several of his orations mention his father Eugenius, a distinguished philosopher from whom he received supplemental training. Themistius devoted himself chiefly to Aristotle, though he also studied Pythagoreanism and Platonism. His early commentaries on Aristotle were published without his consent and won him a high reputation. After passing his youth in Asia Minor and Syria, Themistius met Constantius II during the emperor&#x27;s visit to Ancyra in Galatia in 347. On this occasion Themistius delivered his first extant oration, &quot;Peri Philanthropias&quot;.

== Career ==
It was not long after that he moved to Constantinople, where, apart from a short sojourn in Rome, he resided for the rest of his life. Themistius taught philosophy in the eastern capital for twenty years. In 355 he was inducted into the Senate of Constantinople, on the basis of a letter of recommendation from Constantius. The letter is still extant, and contains high praise both of Themistius and of his father Eugenius. Also preserved is Themistius&#x27; response, an oration of thanks delivered in the senate early in 356. In 357 he gave two further speeches honouring Constantius, although a state visit to Rome made the emperor unavailable to hear them in person. The orator was nonetheless rewarded with a bronze portrait statue. In 361 he was appointed to praetorian rank by a decree still extant. Themistius may have served as proconsul of Constantinople in 358; if so, he was the last to hold that office, before the position was elevated to the status of urban prefect.

Constantius died in 361; but Themistius, as a philosopher and pagan, naturally retained the favour of Julian, who spoke of him as the worthy senator of the whole world, and as the first philosopher of his age. The Suda states that Julian made Themistius prefect of Constantinople; but this is disproved by the speech delivered by Themistius, when he was really appointed to that office under Theodosius. Shortly before the death of Julian in 363, Themistius delivered an oration in honour of him, which is no longer extant, but which is referred to at some length by Libanius, in a letter to Themistius. In 364 he went, as one of the deputies from the senate, to meet Jovian at Dadastana, on the border of Galatia and Bithynia, and to confer the consulate upon him; and on this occasion he delivered an oration, which he afterwards repeated at Constantinople, in which he claims full liberty of conscience to practice any religion. In the same year he delivered an oration at Constantinople, in honour of the accession of Valentinian I and Valens, in the presence of the latter. His next oration is addressed to Valens, congratulating him on his victory over Procopius in June 366, and interceding for some of the rebels; it was delivered in 367. In the next year he accompanied Valens to the Danube in the second campaign of the Gothic war, and delivered before the emperor, at Marcianopolis, a congratulatory oration upon his &quot;Quinquennalia&quot;, 368. His next orations are to the young Valentinian II upon his consulship, 369, and to the senate of Constantinople, in the presence of Valens, in honour of the peace granted to the Goths, 370. On March 28, 373, he addressed to Valens, who was then in Syria, a congratulatory address upon the emperor&#x27;s entrance on the tenth year of his reign. It was also while Valens was in Syria, that Themistius addressed to him an oration by which he persuaded him to cease from his persecution of the Catholic party. In addition to these orations, which prove that the orator was in high favour with the emperor, we have the testimony of Themistius himself to his influence with Valens.

In 377 he was in Rome, apparently on an embassy to Gratian, to whom he delivered an oration entitled &quot;Erotikos&quot;. On the association of Theodosius I in the empire by Gratian, at Sirmium, in 379, Themistius delivered an elegant oration, congratulating the new emperor on his elevation. Of his remaining orations some are public and some private; but few of them demand special notice as connected with the events of his life. In 384, (about the first of September), he was made prefect of Constantinople, an office which had been offered to him, but declined, several times before. He only held the prefecture a few months, as we learn from an oration delivered after he had laid down the office, in which he mentions, as he had done even six years earlier, and more than once in the interval, his old age and ill-health. From the thirty-fourth oration we also learn that he had previously held the offices of &quot;princeps senatus&quot; and &quot;praefectus annonae&quot;, besides his embassy to Rome; in another oration he mentions ten embassies on which he had been sent before his prefecture; and in another, composed probably about 387, he says that he has been engaged for nearly forty years in public business and in embassies. So great was the confidence placed in him by Theodosius, that, though Themistius was not a Christian, the emperor, when departing for the West to oppose Magnus Maximus, entrusted his son Arcadius to the tutorship of the philosopher, 387–388. Nothing is known about Themistius after this time; and he may have died around 388. Besides the emperors, he numbered among his friends the chief orators and philosophers of the age, Christian and pagan. Not only Libanius, but Gregory of Nazianzus also was his friend and correspondent, and the latter, in an epistle still extant, calls him the &quot;king of arguments.&quot;

==Work==

The orations of Themistius, extant in the time of Photius (9th century), were thirty-six in number. Of these, thirty-three have come down to us in Greek. Two of them, however, (Orations 23 and 33, and perhaps Oration 28) are not fully preserved, and one (Oration 25) is a brief statement, not a full oration. Modern editions of the Orations have thirty-four pieces, because a Latin address to Valens has been included as Oration 12. It is now believed though that this Latin address is a 16th-century creation. The final oration (Oration 34) was discovered as recently as 1816 by Angelo Mai in the Ambrosian Library at Milan. There are, in addition, a few other fragments which may come from lost Orations, as well as an additional work which survives in Syriac and another preserved in Arabic.

The philosophical works of Themistius must have been very voluminous; for Photius tells us that he wrote commentaries on all the books of Aristotle, besides useful abstracts of the &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;, the books &quot;On the Soul&quot;, and the &quot;Physics&quot;, and that there were works of his on Plato; &quot;and, in a word, he is a lover and eager student of philosophy.&quot; The Suda mentions his epitome of the &quot;Physics&quot; of Aristotle, in eight books; of the &quot;Prior Analytics&quot;, in two books; of the &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;, in two books; of the treatise &quot;On the Soul&quot;, in seven books; and of the &quot;Categories&quot; in one book.

The epitomes which survive are:
*On the &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;
*On the &quot;Physics&quot;
*On Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;On the Soul&quot;
*On Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;On the Heavens&quot;, in a Hebrew translation only
*On the &quot;Metaphysics&quot; 12, in a Hebrew translation only

In addition to these works, two surviving anonymous paraphrases were mistakenly attributed to him in the Byzantine era, and are now assigned to a Pseudo-Themistius:
*On the &quot;Prior Analytics&quot;
*On the &quot;Parva Naturalia&quot;

His paraphrases of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;, &quot;Physics&quot; and &quot;On the Soul&quot; are valuable; but the orations in which he panegyrizes successive emperors, comparing them to Plato&#x27;s true philosopher, and even to the Idea itself, are intended to flatter. Boëthius describes him as, (or ) .

In philosophy Themistius was an eclectic. He held that Plato and Aristotle were in substantial agreement, that God has made men free to adopt the mode of worship they prefer, and that Christianity and Hellenism were merely two forms of the one universal religion.

<doc id="885776" wikidata="Q824133" url="?curid=885776" title="The Cable Guy">
<text>The Cable Guy is a 1996 American satirical black comedy thriller film directed by Ben Stiller and written by Lou Holtz Jr. It stars Jim Carrey as an eccentric cable installer who becomes overly intrusive in the life of a customer (Matthew Broderick); Leslie Mann, George Segal, Diane Baker and Jack Black appear in supporting roles. It was released in the United States on June 14, 1996.

The film was a box office success, grossing over $100 million, though not to the extent of many of Carrey&#x27;s previous films. It received mixed reviews from critics, but has since attained a cult following.

==Plot==
Architect Steven Kovacs moves into an apartment after a failed marriage proposal to his girlfriend Robin Harris. When the cable installer, Ernie &quot;Chip&quot; Douglas, arrives, Steven acts on advice from his friend Rick and bribes him to get him free movie channels. Chip makes Steven one of his preferred customers and, in return for his services, asks if he can see Steven socially, which Steven begrudgingly agrees to. On a visit to the city&#x27;s central satellite dish, Chip confides to Steven about being raised by television when he was young, as his father was absent and his mother used television as a &quot;babysitter&quot;.

Chip proceeds to intrude more and more on Steven&#x27;s life, alienating him from his friends, leaving multiple messages on his answering machine and installing an expensive home theater system as a gift. Steven rejects the gift but agrees to let Chip use his apartment to host a party for all of his preferred customers, where Steven has sex with a young woman whom Chip later reveals was a prostitute he hired for Steven. Upon this revelation, Steven angrily ejects Chip from his apartment. To make amends, Chip tracks down Robin, who is dating another man who he beats up and tells to stay away, and upgrades her cable, ostensibly as a gift from Steven. Robin decides to get back together with Steven as a result, but when Steven finds out Chip&#x27;s hand in reuniting him with Robin, Steven politely ends his friendship with Chip.

Devastated, Chip sets out on a series of vengeful acts; he has Steven arrested for possession of stolen property, embarrasses him at a family gathering, and has him fired from his job by transmitting a recorded private conversation in which Steven insults his boss onto the company&#x27;s computers. He also reveals that his name is Larry Tate. Rick investigates the name and finds that he was fired from the cable company for using fake names and stalking customers. Steven receives a phone call from the cable guy, who tells him he is paying Robin a visit, making Steven rush to Robin&#x27;s apartment. Finding it empty, Steven calls the police and tells them to hurry to where the cable guy has taken her: the central satellite dish.

Arriving at the satellite dish first, Steven rescues Robin from the cable guy, who, as the police arrive, climbs to the top of the dish proclaiming that he must &quot;kill the babysitter&quot; to prevent others from becoming like him. He falls into the dish and cuts the television signal to the entire city, but survives. He apologizes to Steven for being a bad friend; Steven forgives him and asks for his real name, which he says is Ricky Ricardo. As he is airlifted away, one of the paramedics addresses him as &quot;buddy&quot;; when he asks if that&#x27;s true and the paramedic confirms it, the cable guy smiles deviously, thinking he has found a new &quot;friend&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
First-time screenwriter Lou Holtz Jr. had the idea for &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; while working as a prosecutor in Los Angeles, declaring that he once saw a cable company employee in the hallway of his mother&#x27;s apartment building and started thinking, &quot;What&#x27;s he doing here so late?&quot; The screenplay became the subject of a bidding war, won by Columbia Pictures at a price of $750,000, plus a $250,000 additional bonus if the movie got made. The role of the Cable Guy was originally sold with Chris Farley attached to star, but he later dropped out due to scheduling difficulties. Adam Sandler was also considered for the role of the Cable Guy.

Jim Carrey joined the production, receiving a then record $20 million to star. Following Carrey&#x27;s signing, Columbia Pictures hired Judd Apatow to produce. Columbia rebuffed Apatow&#x27;s interest in directing, but accepted his suggestion to invite Ben Stiller on whose &quot;Ben Stiller Show&quot; Apatow had worked. Stiller was considered to play the Steven Kovacs character before it was offered to Matthew Broderick.

The original screenplay by Lou Holtz Jr. was a lighter comedy, described by Apatow as &quot;a &quot;What About Bob?&quot; annoying friend movie&quot; where the Cable Guy was a likeable loser who intrudes upon the cable subscriber&#x27;s life, but never in a physically threatening way. Carrey, Apatow and Stiller liked the setup of &quot;somebody who is really smart with technology invading somebody&#x27;s life&quot;, and opted to add slapstick and darker tones, changing into a satire of thrillers such as &quot;Cape Fear&quot;, &quot;Unlawful Entry&quot; and &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot;. The dialogue would also fit Carrey&#x27;s style of comedy.

Holtz wrote four additional drafts, each one darker than the previous, before leaving the project and giving Apatow the opportunity to take over the writing. Apatow and Stiller visited Carrey as he was filming &quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot; in South Carolina, and over a few days, riffed a lot of the set pieces that were added to the script, and further explored how Carrey wanted to perform the character. Apatow took the film to the Writers Guild for arbitration to get a writing credit but ultimately Holtz retained sole credit for the script. Apatow expressed frustration at not getting credit but acknowledged that as he was also a producer on the film, the Writers Guild requirements are set very high to protect writers.

The final script had elements so disturbing that Columbia heard many complaints regarding certain scenes. In turn, Apatow declared that the studio did not specifically order removals, &quot;but we took [the scenes] out as part of the natural evolution of our creative process&quot;. Stiller stated that he shot every scene with &quot;a dark version and a light version&quot;, and that he was surprised that the studio did not object to the violent ending.

The fight sequence at Medieval Times between Chip (Jim Carrey) and Steven (Matthew Broderick) is an homage to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Amok Time&quot;—including the use of Vulcan weapons (&quot;lirpa&quot;), the dialogue, and the background music. Director Ben Stiller is an admitted Trekkie.

==Release==
=== Box office ===
The film grossed $19,806,226 on its opening weekend, ranking number one ahead of &quot;The Rock&quot;. At the time, it had the highest opening weekend for a Ben Stiller film, holding this record until 2000 when &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; surpassed it. It grossed a total $60,240,295 in the North American domestic market, and $42,585,501 outside the United States, making a total of $102,825,796 worldwide gross, but failed to reach domestic projected numbers Jim Carrey brought to his previous movies. Apatow said &quot;people looked at it as a failure because it didn&#x27;t make even more money.&quot; Despite the critical perception that the movie was a disappointment, it made a profit in excess of its $47 million production budget.

The film was released in the United Kingdom on July 12, 1996, and opened on #2, behind &quot;&quot;.

=== Home media ===
The film was released on VHS on December 3, 1996, DVD on September 15, 1997, and a 15th anniversary Blu-ray release on March 1, 2011. Sony re-issued the latter format as a manufacture-on-demand title on December 17, 2019.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; holds an approval rating of 55% based on 80 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;&quot;The Cable Guy&quot;″s dark flashes of thought-provoking, subversive wit are often—but not always—enough to counter its frustratingly uneven storytelling approach.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 56 based 28 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;C+&quot; on scale of A to F.

&quot;The Cable Guy&quot; has been regarded as having a darker tone than most of Carrey&#x27;s previous work. While the character may seem goofy at first, similar to previous Carrey roles, he later turns more sinister and scary. Audiences and film critics had mixed reactions to the change. The film was on J. Hoberman&#x27;s Top 10 best of the year. Roger Ebert included &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; in his worst of the year list for 1996, though colleague Gene Siskel disagreed, calling it &quot;a very good film. [Carrey&#x27;s] best since &quot;The Mask&quot;&quot;. Ebert found Carrey&#x27;s &quot;bizarre&quot; and &quot;creepy&quot; performance undermined the entire story, and felt the movie was more of a dark comedy than was necessary.

In spite of its mixed reception, the film has achieved a cult following, and has been credited for helping Carrey pursue more serious roles such as &quot;The Truman Show&quot; and &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot;. Carrey named the movie one of his favorites that he worked on:I have odd favorites that may not be for kids, but &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; is one of my favorite movies. I think Ben Stiller did an amazing job, and it&#x27;s populated with the greatest comedy actors of our day when they were just coming into their power. I love that character. That character is all of us: we were all raised by the TV.

Ben Stiller calls &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; the &quot;most educational and spirit-building&quot; failure of his career. Despite its initial flop, he says, &quot;the making of it was a pure creative experience&quot; thanks to Jim Carrey&#x27;s boldness. He reflects, &quot;It was pretty shocking, mainly because I never experienced such a high-profile project not doing well.&quot; But the experience taught him invaluable lessons: &quot;You learn that it sometimes goes well and it sometimes doesn’t,&quot; and that success isn’t always immediate. Ultimately, Stiller finds fulfillment in the film&#x27;s lasting impact: &quot;I have found it [has a life], more so than other movies I made that were more &#x27;successful.&#x27;&quot;

===Accolades===
== Soundtrack ==

The Cable Guy: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on May 21, 1996, via Work Group. It consists of previously unreleased songs, largely of alternative rock and heavy metal bands, and includes the first solo recording by Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains fame. The soundtrack includes Jim Carrey&#x27;s version of Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; which was performed by him in the film. It also includes a song from $10,000 Gold Chain, a side project of Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready. White Zombie&#x27;s &quot;More Human than Human&quot; is featured in a dramatic scene of the film but was not included on the soundtrack release.

Cantrell&#x27;s &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; served as the soundtrack&#x27;s promotional vehicle and was released as a single, peaking at No. 14 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It had a music video that featured various footage from &quot;Cable Guy&quot; in a dark manner typical of Cantrell&#x27;s style. It also had Jim Carrey&#x27;s haunting face reaching out of a television screen observing Cantrell. The music video was included as a bonus feature on the 15th-anniversary edition Blu-ray of &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; in 2011.

While the album as a whole was not well received, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; positively &quot;rocks as hard as any Alice in Chains track&quot;. The track &quot;Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand&quot; gained popularity for its appearance in the film and reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart in 1996.

===Track listing===
== In popular culture ==

<doc id="885785" wikidata="Q1766120" url="?curid=885785" title="Nowlan Park">
<text>Nowlan Park (; ), known for sponsorship reasons as UPMC Nowlan Park, is the principal Gaelic Athletic Association stadium in Kilkenny, Ireland. Named after James Nowlan, the longest serving President of the GAA, the stadium hosts major hurling matches and is home to the Kilkenny hurling team. It opened in 1927, replacing St. James Park.

==Facilities==
The stadium consists of the following stands:
*Old Stand (O&#x27;Loughlin Road) mainly bench-seats (uncovered, planning for a new roof submitted after storm damaged the old roof in 2014) (The new roof completed in late 2014 and opened in early 2015)
*Paddy Grace Stand (New Stand, Hebron Road) mainly bench-seats (covered)
*Ted Carrol Stand (country end) 4,000 plastic seats (covered)
*City Terrace (covered)
The target capacity under the Kilkenny GAA 2010-15 plan was 30,000. A large portion of the Old Stand&#x27;s roof was blown off during a violent storm on 12 February 2014. The rest was removed for health and safety reasons.

==Hurling==
History was made at Nowlan Park on 7 June 2014 when Kilkenny versus Offaly was broadcast on Sky Sports, the first time a Championship fixture of any kind was broadcast live to a UK-wide audience. British viewers were reported to have been &quot;amazed and confused [...] bemused but impressed [...] amused and confounded&quot; after catching a glimpse of the broadcast.

==Other uses==

Nowlan Park also serves as a concert venue, with festivals featuring performers such as Andrea Bocelli, Rod Stewart, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Paul Simon, Bryan Ferry, James Taylor, Shania Twain, Dolly Parton, and in July 2013 it played host to the European tour finale of Bruce Springsteen. Bruce Springsteen is due to play the venue again on 12 May 2024 as part of the Springsteen and E Street Band 2023 Tour.

Nowlan Park was also included in Ireland&#x27;s bid to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Nowlan Park was used as a drive-through test centre.

==Naming rights==
It was announced, in October 2019, that the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) had agreed a naming-rights deal with the Kilkenny County Board. Running for 10 years, from 2019, the sponsorship deal involved the rebranding of the ground to &quot;UPMC Nowlan Park&quot;.

<text>Sirius Systems Technology was a personal computer manufacturer in Scotts Valley, California. It was founded in 1980 by Chuck Peddle and Chris Fish, formerly of MOS Technology and capitalized by Walter Kidde Inc. In late 1982 Sirius acquired Victor Business Systems (known for its calculators and cash registers) from Kidde and changed its name to [[Victor Technology|Victor Technologies]]. It made the Victor/Sirius series of personal computers. The company made a public stock offering in the first half of 1983, but went into Chapter 11 protection from bankruptcy before the end of 1984. The company&#x27;s assets were acquired by Datatronic AB, a Swedish software/hardware distribution company headed by . Gabrielsson signed a distribution deal with Kyocera, which began to supply PC clones to Victor.

==Victor 9000 / Sirius 1==
The Victor 9000 (distributed in the UK by British company Applied Computer Techniques as the ACT Sirius 1, and in Australia by Barson Computers as the Sirius 1) was designed by Peddle, who had also designed the first Commodore PET. His team began work in January 1981 and showed a prototype in April. It appeared for the first time at the show in Munich, Germany, in late 1981. Chuck Peddle used two of his Commodore contacts to set up two subsidiaries in continental Europe. David Deane (France) and Jürgen Tepper (Germany) were both ex-Mannesmann Tally whom Chuck had met while negotiating an OEM deal for printers.

The Victor 9000/Sirius 1 ran CP/M-86 and MS-DOS but did not claim to be IBM PC compatible. It offered a higher resolution screen and 600 KB/1.2 MB floppy drives. Advertisements cited the graphics, multiple operating systems, 128 KB of RAM, and high-quality audio. One striking difference between it and other machines on the market at the time was the fact that the disc utilized a form of zoned constant linear velocity (ZCLV) (using 9 different speed-zones selected out of 15 supported by the hardware) with a variant of zone bit recording (ZBR) (11 to 19 sectors depending on zone) to spun at different speeds according to where the data was stored, running slower towards the outer edge of the disc in such a way that bit density (bits per cm passing the head), rather than rotational speed, was approximately constant. This, combined with group-coded recording (GCR), allowed standard floppy disks to hold more data than others at the time, 600 KB on single- and 1.2 MB on double-sided floppies compared with 140–160 KB per side of other machines such as the Apple II and early IBM PC, but disks made at constant bit density were not compatible with machines with standard drives. The Victor 9000&#x27;s 800x400 resolution screen (based on a Hitachi 46505 CRT controller chip - equivalent to a Motorola 6845), 896 KB of memory (RAM), programmable keyboard and character set were also far ahead of the competition.

While unsuccessful in North America, Victor 9000 became the most popular 16-bit business computer in Europe, especially in Britain and Germany, while IBM delayed the release of the PC there. Its success led to the ACT Apricot. ACT outsold the Sirius/Victor subsidiaries and also led the way in proving that application software was the key to sales. Most sales across Europe went through small systems houses rather than computer shops.

The Victor 9000 was also distributed in the UK under that name by DRG Business Machines in Weston-super-Mare, who dealt with Victor Technologies in the US direct. It was not a particularly successful venture as ACT had already established a brand name and a loyal dealer base.

===Reception===
&quot;BYTE&quot; called the Victor 9000 &quot;an excellent microcomputer with an outstanding array of standard features&quot;. It praised the high-quality video and large array of software available from Victor, while criticizing the high price of peripherals compared to the many third-party options on the IBM PC.

<doc id="885788" wikidata="Q1529450" url="?curid=885788" title="Judah II">
<text>Judah II or Nesi&#x27;ah I was a Jewish sage who lived in Tiberias in the Land of Israel, in the middle of the third century CE.

He is mentioned in the classical works of Judaism&#x27;s Oral Torah, the Mishnah and Talmud. There he is variously called &quot;Judah,&quot; &quot;Judah Nesi&#x27;ah&quot; (= &quot;ha-Nasi&quot;), and occasionally &quot;Rabbi&quot; like his grandfather, Judah haNasi. As Judah III is also designated as &quot;Judah Nesi&#x27;ah,&quot; it is often difficult, sometimes impossible, to determine which one of these patriarchs is referred to.

==Biography==
===Youth===
Various stories of Judah&#x27;s youth, referring to him and his brother Hillel, have been preserved. As youths, Judah and Hillel visited Cabul and Biri, each time behaving in ways which offended the local population.
===Relations with other scholars===
He had especially friendly relations with Hoshaiah. Together with Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, he assisted at Laodicea in the reception of a female proselyte into Judaism. Jonathan b. Eleazar was his companion at the baths of Gadara. The relations between the patriarch and Rabbi Yochanan, the leader of the Academy of Tiberias, seem to have been friendly; Yochanan accepted the regular material support offered to him by Judah. Yochanan also induced Judah to visit Shimon ben Lakish, who had fled from Tiberias in consequence of having made offensive remarks in regard to the dignity of the patriarchate, and invite him to return.

On another occasion, it was Shimon ben Lakish who succeeded in softening Judah&#x27;s indignation toward a daring preacher, Jose of Maon, who had denounced the rapacity of the patriarchal house. Shimon ben Lakish, moreover, seems to have exhorted the patriarch to unselfishness, saying &quot;Take nothing, so that you will have to give nothing [to the Roman authorities]&quot;. Simeon ben Lakish also reminded Judah of the need of providing for elementary education in the various cities, referring to the saying, &quot;A city in which there are no schools for children is doomed to destruction&quot;.

===Standing among other scholars===
Judah&#x27;s authority as patriarch was not absolute: he could not carry out his intention of omitting the fast-day of Tisha B&#x27;Av when it fell on the Sabbath. He was not regarded by his contemporaries as their equal in scholarship, as appears from a curious meeting between him and R. Yannai.

However, Judah was not so unimportant as might appear from this, since Shimon ben Lakish (who was not his pupil) hands down a whole series of halakhic teachings in the name of &quot;Judah Nesi&#x27;ah&quot;. Shimon ben Lakish doubtless survived Judah and repeated his traditions. Shimon handed down also some of Judah&#x27;s aggadic teachings. The passage (Nazir 20c) referring to Simeon ben Lakish as &quot;sitting before Judah&quot; and explaining a midrash does not refer to him as a pupil, but as a member of the college. This view is supported by Avodah Zarah 6b, which speaks of Shimon as &quot;sitting before Judah Nesi&#x27;ah&quot;; here the patriarch asks Shimon what to do in a certain case, and Shimon clearly appears as the better halakhist, not as Judah&#x27;s pupil.

Judah&#x27;s relations to the scholars of his time appear from the following disagreement between Judah and the rabbis: &quot;One said: &#x27;The time is adapted to the leader [&quot;parnas&quot;]&#x27;; the other said: &#x27;The leader is adapted to the time&#x27;&quot;. It was probably Judah who said that the leader is adapted to the time, and that he must not be blamed for his own incapacity. In the above-mentioned meeting between Judah and Jose of Maon it was Jose who said, &quot;As the time, so the prince.&quot;

On another occasion, Judah openly confessed his incapacity. Once during a drought he had ordered a fast and prayed in vain for rain. Thereupon he said, &quot;What a difference between Samuel of Ramah and Judah, the son of Gamaliel! Woe to the time which has such a tent-peg, and woe to me that I have come at such a time!&quot; Rain soon fell in consequence of this self-abasement.

===Relations with Origen===
Grätz identifies Judah&#x27;s brother Hillel, with the &quot;patriarch Joullos&quot; (&#x27;Ιοῦλλος πατριάρχης), with whom Origen conversed at Caesarea on Biblical subjects. But as Hillel himself was not a patriarch, it may be assumed that it was Judah who conversed with Origen. Origen probably misread ΙΟϒΛΟΣ (&quot;Joulos&quot;) for ΙΟϒΔΑΣ (&quot;Joudas&quot;). This assumption agrees with the above-mentioned statement about Hoshaiah&#x27;s close relations with the patriarch, for it may be assumed as a fact that Hoshaiah had contact with Origen at Caesarea.

==Teachings==

In halakhic tradition, Judah II was especially known by three ordinances decreed by him and his academy; one of these ordinances referred to a reform of the divorce laws. Especially famous was the decree permitting the use of oil prepared by pagans, incorporated in the Mishnah with the same formula used in connection with decrees of Judah haNasi—&quot;Rabbi and his court permitted&quot;. This ordinance, which abrogated an old law, was recognized as authoritative in Babylonia by Samuel, and subsequently by Rav, who at first hesitated to accept it. Simlai, the famous aggadist, tried to induce Judah to abrogate also the prohibition against using bread prepared by pagans. Judah, however, refused to do so, alleging that he did not wish his academy to be called the &quot;losing court&quot;.

<doc id="885790" wikidata="Q360069" url="?curid=885790" title="Bengbu">
<text>Bengbu () is a city in northern Anhui Province, China. Its population was 3,296,408 registered residents at the 2020 census. 1,968,027 lived in the built-up area made of four Bengbu urban districts and Fengyang County in Chuzhou Prefecture, largely being conurbated. Its name means &quot;Clam Wharf&quot; in Chinese, echoing its former reputation as a freshwater pearl fishery.

==Administration==
The prefecture-level city of Bengbu administers seven county-level divisions, including four districts and three counties.
These are further divided into 74 township-level divisions, including 36 towns, 19 townships and 19 subdistricts.

==Geography==
Bengbu is located in the southeast of the North China Plain, on the Huai River. The built up urbanized area is divided into two parts: greater Bengbu on the south bank of the river and little Bengbu on the north bank. Dragon Lake is on the East side of the urbanized area. On the other side of the lake is the university district, containing four institutions of higher learning.

==Climate==
The area has a four-season humid subtropical climate with strong monsoon influences (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cwa&quot;), cool, sometimes cold, winters, and hot and humid summers. The area lies in a climatic transition zone, as it is on the Qin Ling−Huai River boundary between the climatic regimes of northern and southern China. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . A majority of the annual precipitation occurs from June to August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 44% in March to 56% in August, the city receives 2,168 hours of bright sunshine annually.

==History==

In ancient times, the Dongyi peoples inhabited this area and were collectively known as the Huaiyi after the Huai River. During the late Western Zhou Period and the early Spring and Autumn period, the Dongyi became increasingly sinicized. During the late Spring and Autumn period, the once-powerful Dongyi state of Xu was pressured from all directions and destroyed through a series of wars with its neighbors, such as the Chu State and the Wu State. Another Dongyi State was the small Zhongli State, which was a part of the Huaiyi Confederation led by the State of Xu. Tombs belonging to the royalty of the Zhongli State were discovered in excavations between 2005 and 2008 near Fengyang. Eventually, the Huaiyi peoples were assimilated.

Bengbu has always been a hub of water and land communications in Anhui province, and a major distribution centre for the Huai basin.

In 1948, during the Chinese Civil War, the Communist People&#x27;s Liberation Army won a decisive victory over Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist (KMT) forces near Bengbu, in the Huaihai Campaign.

==Economy==

===Industry===
Bengbu is now a famous food city in Anhui province. Food-related industries account for 44% of the city&#x27;s industrial production. The city&#x27;s other industries include engineering works, textiles, glass making, chemicals, and electronics. The light textile holds an important position in the industrial structure.

===Agriculture===
Bengbu is teeming with oil, vegetables, meat and aquatic products. Bengbu is a large producer of peanuts. The pomegranates from Huaiyuan (a county of Bengbu), have a high reputation in China. In Wuhe (a county of Bengbu), the crabs are also famous.

==Culture==
Pollution in the village of Qiugang, a suburb of Bengbu, was the subject of the 2010 film &quot;The Warriors of Qiugang&quot;, an 83rd Academy Awards nominee. The Bengbu Stadium is located in the city. The 15,000-capacity stadium is used mostly for football matches.

==Food==
Bengbu cuisine, along with northern Anhui cuisine, is similar to cuisine from nearby Henan and Shandong provinces, as well as Xuzhou cuisine in northern Jiangsu province.

==Transportation==

The city is on the Jinghu Railway, with hourly direct trains to Beijing, Shanghai and other large cities. Bengbu South Railway Station is served by the high-speed Beijing-Shanghai Railway.

Bengbu Airport, which was relocated from the city&#x27;s central urban area around the turn of the 21st century, is now operated only as a military airport. A new commercial airport is under construction in the district north of the Huai river.

Construction on the Bengbu Metro started in 2019 and is due to be completed in 2023.

<text>Judah III (or Nesi&#x27;ah II; Hebrew: יהודה נשיאה; יודן נשיאה), Yudan Nesiah, was a prominent Jewish sage, who held the office of &quot;Nasi&quot; of the ancient Jewish Sanhedrin between about 290 and 320 CE (fourth generation of amoraim).

==Biography==
He was the son of Gamaliel IV, and grandson of Judah II. 

It is often difficult to know when the Mishna and Talmud are referring to Judah II or Judah III; they do not clearly distinguish between them. Since the title &quot;Nesi&#x27;ah&quot; was borne by both, which of the two in any citation is meant by &quot;Judah Nesi&#x27;ah&quot; can be gathered only from internal evidence, especially from the names of the scholars mentioned in the context. 

He was a pupil of R. Johanan bar Nappaha (d. 279). In a question regarding the time of the new moon, which he sent to Rav Ammi, he introduces a teaching taught to him by Johanan with the words: &quot;Know that R. Johanan has taught us thus all his life long&quot;.

Judah III commissioned Johanan&#x27;s pupils Ammi and Assi, who directed the Academy of Tiberias in the Land of Israel, after Eleazar ben Pedat&#x27;s death, to organize the schools for children in the Palestinian cities. Ammi especially appears as his councilor in aggadic questions. He also visited the baths of Gadara with Ammi.

Ammi, however, protested against the number of fast-days which Judah set in times of trouble, saying that the community should not be overburdened. Once Helbo, a pupil of the above-mentioned Samuel ben Nahman, requested Judah, who had absented himself from a fast-day service held in the public square of the city, to take part in the service, which would thereby become more efficacious. The prominent amora Jeremiah is said to have reproached Judah in a letter for hating his friends and loving his enemies.

Germanus, Judah&#x27;s Roman slave, is mentioned several times.

The most important event of Judah III&#x27;s patriarchate was the visit of the emperor Diocletian to Palestine. One Friday the patriarch was called upon hurriedly to visit Diocletian at Caesarea Philippi, and his extraordinarily quick journey to there from Tiberias gave rise to a legend in which the aged Samuel ben Nahman appears. On the Church father Epiphanius&#x27; reference to the patriarch, see Grätz.

When Judah III died (c. 320), Hiyya bar Abba compelled his colleague Zeira, who was of priestly descent, to ignore, in honor of the dead patriarch, the laws to be observed by kohanim. This scene took place in the &quot;synagogue of the vine&quot; at Sepphoris; hence it is to be assumed that Judah III was buried at Sepphoris. He was succeeded by his son Hillel II.

Jewish tradition holds that Judah III was interred at Ovnit.

<text>PS &quot;Maid of the Loch&quot; is the last paddle steamer built in the United Kingdom. She operated on Loch Lomond for 29 years. As of 2022, she was being restored near Balloch pier.

She is presently on the slipway near Balloch Pier undergoing extensive repairs to her hull, complete paddle restoration and will be coated in her original livery of white, green waterline and buff coloured funnel before being launched again into Loch Lomond. While under restoration, the &quot;Maid of the Loch&quot; has been open to the public every Saturday and Sunday Easter to October, and closed throughout the winter.

==Construction==
&quot;Maid of the Loch&quot; is the last of a long line of Loch Lomond steamers that began about 1816, within four years of Henry Bell&#x27;s pioneering passenger steamboat service on the River Clyde. In 1950 the British Transport Commission, owner of the newly nationalised railways, made the decision to replace the &quot;Princess May&quot; and &quot;Prince Edward&quot; with a new paddle steamer, to be the largest inland waterway vessel ever in Britain.

&quot;Maid of the Loch&quot; was built by A. &amp; J. Inglis of Glasgow, launched on 5 March 1953, and entered service later that year. She is a &quot;knock down&quot; ship: that is, after assembly at the shipyard she was dismantled, and shipped to the loch by rail to Balloch at the south end of the loch, and there the sections were reassembled on a purpose built slipway. The tonnage measures , and the length is . The two-cylinder compound diagonal steam engine is less advanced than had the more usual type installed on steamers such as the , but was considered suitable for the limited area of operations.

&quot;Maid of the Loch&quot; was painted white with a buff funnel. She was initially operated by the Caledonian Steam Packet Company. In later years she had a series of owners. 

==Services==

&quot;Maid of the Loch&quot; provided a service from Balloch pier, initially to Ardlui at the north end of the loch, but later her last call was a few miles short of this at Inversnaid and she would cruise to the head of the loch. She was transferred to the Scottish Transport Group in 1969; then in 1973 to Caledonian MacBrayne.

As with other steamers, cost pressures led to her being laid up after a last commercial sailing on 31 August 1981. One problem was that some of the piers on the loch would become unusable, either because of poor state of repair, or silting making the area around them too shallow; some of these piers had not been built to take a vessel as large as the &quot;Maid of the Loch&quot;. A series of attempts to return the vessel to service under a succession of owners was unsuccessful, and she presented a sad sight gradually deteriorating at the side of the loch.

==Restoration==

In 1992 Dumbarton District Council bought the &quot;Maid of the Loch&quot; and restoration work started. In 1995 the Council supported a group of local enthusiasts in setting up a charitable organisation, the Loch Lomond Steamship Company, to take over ownership and carry on restoration. She became ready for static operation with a cafe/bar and function suite in autumn 2000.

The key to the restoration was the repair and refurbishment of the slipway adjacent to the pier at Balloch. There not being any connection to the sea it was not possible to take the ship to a dry dock for repairs to the hull so a slipway with a steam-operated cable-hauled cradle had been built. This had fallen into disrepair by the 1990s and eventually a Heritage Lottery Fund grant was awarded along with assistance from Scottish Enterprise Dunbartonshire, and West Dunbartonshire Council. This enabled the paddle steamer to be lifted out of the water on 27 June 2006.

Fundraising continued for the next stages of the restoration including donations from the Wolfson Foundation, the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society and £950,000 from the Scottish Government&#x27;s Regeneration Capital Grant Fund, amongst others. There had been the suggestion that if Loch Lomond Steamship Company raised £1.7 million by June 2018, that the Heritage Lottery Fund would donate £3.8 million towards the restoration, however in September 2018 it was announced that the Heritage Lottery Fund had decided against this donation.

In January 2019 an unsuccessful attempt was made to winch the &quot;Maid of the Loch&quot; out of the water onto her slipway but the ship snapped its ties and slid back into the loch, however a second attempt in July 2021 with a new carriage was successful. Restoration work continued on the ship, with her interiors being returned to their original 1950s appearance while adding modern conveniences such as a lift between decks, and also enabling her engines and paddles to turn slowly fed by a package boiler mounted on the pier.

In 2019 the project was set back due to the failed bid to the National Lottery Fund. However, it received £950k from the Scottish Government and £50k from the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society. This funding was used as described above. The charity built a new, more robust Slipway carriage using funds supplied by a variety of sources, most notably, Historic Environment Scotland as the slipway and the Steam Winch House form a Grade A listed structure.

<doc id="885805" wikidata="Q1056684" url="?curid=885805" title="Synod of Pistoia">
<text>The Synod of Pistoia was a 1786 diocesan synod in the Catholic diocese of Pistoia, then part of the territory of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. It was convoked by its bishop Scipione de&#x27; Ricci under the patronage and active support of the Habsburg-Lorraine Grand Duke Leopold. The synod adopted a series of decrees of Febronian or Gallican tendency, against the background of Enlightenment thinking. Leopold hoped the synod&#x27;s resolutions would be taken up by a &quot;national&quot; council and increase state autocratic control over the Church in Tuscany. However, in 1787 the ensuing synod of bishops rejected the Pistoia decrees, and in 1794 Pope Pius VI condemned 85 of them, leading Ricci to recant.

==Circular letter==
On January 26, 1786 the Grand Duke issued a circular letter to the bishops of Tuscany, suggesting certain &quot;reforms&quot;, especially in the matter of the revival of the holding of diocesan synods, the purging of the missals and breviaries of legends, the assertion of episcopal as against papal authority, the curtailing of the privileges of the monastic orders, and improved education for the clergy.

In spite of the hostile attitude of the great majority of the Tuscan bishops, on July 31, 1786 Bishop de Ricci issued a summons to a diocesan synod, which was solemnly opened on the September 18. In convoking the synod, he invoked the authority of Pius VI, who had previously recommended a synod as the normal means of diocesan renewal. It was attended by 233 beneficed secular priests and 13 regulars and decided with practical unanimity on a series of decrees which, had it been possible to carry them into effect, would have involved drastic changes in the Tuscan Church on the lines advocated by Febronius.

==Decrees==
The first decree (&quot;Decretum de fide et ecclesia&quot;) declared that the Catholic Church had no right to introduce new dogmas, but only to preserve in its original purity the faith once delivered by Christ to His apostles, and was infallible only so far as it conforms to Holy Scripture and true tradition; the Church, moreover was a purely spiritual body and had no authority in things secular. Other decrees denounced the supposed abuse of indulgences, of festivals of saints, and of processions and proposed revised regulations; others again enjoined the closing of shops on Sunday during divine service, the introduction of the vernacular tongue into the Roman Rite, the issue of editions of liturgical texts for the devotional use of the people that had parallel translations in the vernacular, and recommended the abolition of all monastic orders except that of St. Benedict, the rules of which were to be brought into harmony with modern ideas; nuns were to be forbidden to take vows before the age of 40. The last of the decrees proposed the convocation of a national council. 

Overall, the synod&#x27;s measures incorporated demands made previously by the Jansenist party, opposing for example devotion to the Sacred Heart, though the synod cannot be said to have been Jansenist in essence. Some of its proposals had already been Church law for centuries, others were moderate pastoral measures, others concerned matters well beyond the authority of any diocesan body and others were in any case more in the nature of &quot;fillers&quot; to make up a heady and high-sounding revolutionary manifesto. The driving force was the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, as was evident to the clergy faced with the synod&#x27;s draft proposals, who understandably took discretion to be the better part of valour. Bishop Ricci seized his moment, and seems to have adhered with enthusiasm to the event, but at the same time he had limited choice given the domination of the absolutist regime in Tuscany, a small state, but backed by the international power wielded by the Habsburg-Lorrainers.

==Assembly in Florence==
The synod&#x27;s decrees were issued together with a pastoral letter of Bishop Ricci, and were warmly approved by the Grand Duke, at whose instance a &quot;national&quot; synod of the Tuscan bishops met at Florence on April 23, 1787. At this point, however, the plan stalled. The temper of this new assembly, like its composition, was wholly different. The bishops refused to allow a voice to any not of their own order, and in the end the decrees of Pistoia were supported by only three bishops.

Notwithstanding, as a propaganda tool in an ideological war, the acts of the synod of Pistoia were published in Latin and Italian at Pavia in 1788.

Pius VI commissioned four bishops, assisted by theologians of the secular clergy, to examine the Pistoia resolutions, and deputed a congregation of cardinals and bishops to pass judgment on them. These condemned the synod and declared eighty-five of its propositions to be erroneous and dangerous. The synod&#x27;s teachings were finally condemned by the papal bull &quot;Auctorem fidei&quot; of August 28, 1794. De&#x27; Ricci, deprived of the personal support of the Grand Duke (who had in the meantime become Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II), under pressure from Rome, and threatened with mob violence as a suspected destroyer of holy relics, resigned his see in 1791, and lived in Florence as a private gentleman until his death. In May 1805, upon the return of Pope Pius VII from Paris, he signed an act of submission to papal authority.

==Legacy==

The Melkite Greek Catholic Church held the Synod of Qarqafe in 1806 which ratified and adapted the Synod of Pistoia for the Melkite church.

<text>Mark Kamins (April 11, 1950 – February 14, 2013) was an American record producer, remixer, and disc jockey famous for his role in the New York club scene. He is best known for helping launch the career of singer Madonna by bringing her to Sire Records and producing her debut single &quot;Everybody&quot; in 1982.

== Life and career ==
Kamins attended Elizabeth Irwin High School in New York City. He grew up with songwriter Bob Thiele Jr. and they went to school with jazz drummer Denardo Coleman and photographer Amy Arbus.

As a teenager, Kamins worked at a record shop, Record Connection, where he met DJs and that led to his first DJing gig at the nightclub Le Jardin. After Kamins graduated from college in 1976, he went to London where his then-girlfriend worked at Virgin Megastore. At the shop, he met someone who offered him a job in Greece and he ended up DJing in Athens for a year at a club called Anabella&#x27;s. When he returned to New York, he got a job at a rock club called Trax on 72nd Street and Columbus Avenue.

In 1979, Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records, heard Kamins Djing at Trax and hired him to do A&amp;R for the label. He signed the Waitresses and Was Not Was to Island records.

When Jim Fouratt and Rudolf Pieper opened the first Danceteria nightclub in 1980, they hired Kamins as a DJ. When the club closed, he was hired by Steve Mass to DJ at the Mudd Club on White Street. He later returned to work at the second Danceteria on 21st Street.

Around this time, Kamins began remixing songs. His first remix was &quot;Big Business&quot; (1981) by David Byrne. He suggested the instrumental for &quot;Pull Up to the Bumper&quot; (1981) by Grace Jones. &quot;That was a B-Side of a Junior Tucker song. It was just a Sly &amp; Robbie dub track that was hanging around. I gave it to Grace to write some lyrics on it, and she came up with &quot;Pull Up to the Bumper.&quot;

In 1982, Madonna, then an aspiring singer gave Kamins the demo tape of her song &quot;Everybody&quot; at Danceteria. They became romantically involved and Kamins played her music for Blackwell in hopes to sign her but he said, &quot;I&#x27;m not gonna sign my A&amp;R guy&#x27;s girlfriend.&quot; Kamins then sent the tape to Seymour Stein, head of Sire Records. Stein was impressed with the song and asked to meet Madonna while he was admitted to Lenox Hill Hospital, ultimately signing her to a singles deal. Kamins produced Madonna&#x27;s debut single &quot;Everybody&quot; which was released in October 1982.

Kamins remixed &quot;A Nite Out&quot; (1983) and &quot;Peacetrain&quot; (1984) by Urban Blight. In 1984, Kamins recorded the Beastie Boys. He produced the 1985 album &quot;Pigs and Battleships&quot; by Quando Quango. In 1985, Steve Rubell hired Kamins as DJ at the opening week of the Palladium nightclub, but his style didn&#x27;t work well at the club and he was fired after the opening night.

Kamins opened his own venue, The Harem, where live Turkish musicians would play along with instrumental house tracks that he would play.

On February 14, 2013, Kamins died at the age of 57 after he suffered &quot;a massive coronary&quot; in Guadalajara, Mexico, where he had been teaching. He was survived by a son.

<text>Johannes Stöffler (also &quot;Stöfler, Stoffler, Stoeffler&quot;; 10 December 1452 – 16 February 1531) was a German mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, priest, maker of astronomical instruments and professor at the University of Tübingen.

==Life==
Johannes Stöffler was born on 10 December 1452 in Justingen (now part of Schelklingen) on the Swabian Alb. Having received his basic education at the Blaubeuren monastery school, he registered at the newly founded University of Ingolstadt on 21 April 1472, where he was consequently promoted Baccalaureus in September 1473 and Magister in January 1476. After finishing his studies he obtained the parish of Justingen where he, besides his clerical obligations, concerned himself with astronomy, astrology and the making of astronomical instruments, clocks and celestial globes. He conducted a lively correspondence with leading humanists - for example, Johannes Reuchlin, for whom he made an equatorium and wrote horoscopes.

In 1499, Stöffler predicted that a deluge would cover the world on 20 February 1524. In 1507, at the instigation of Duke Ulrich I, he received the newly established chair of mathematics and astronomy at the University of Tübingen, where he excelled in rich teaching and publication activities and finally was elected rector in 1522. By the time of his appointment, he already enjoyed a virtual monopoly in ephemeris-making in collaboration with Jacob Pflaum, continuing the calculations of Regiomontanus through 1531, and then through 1551, the latter being published posthumously in 1531.

His treatise on the construction and the use of the astrolabe, entitled &quot;Elucidatio fabricae ususque astrolabii&quot;, was published in several editions and served astronomers and surveyors for a long time as a standard work.

Philipp Melanchthon and Sebastian Münster rank among his most famous students. Stöffler died of the plague in Blaubeuren on 16 February 1531 after an epidemic forced the division and relocation of his university to the surrounding countryside in 1530. He was buried in the choir of the collegiate church (Stiftskirche) in Tübingen.

<doc id="885814" wikidata="Q5121669" url="?curid=885814" title="Circular knitting">
<text>Circular knitting or knitting in the round is a form of knitting that creates a seamless tube. Work in the round is begun by casting on stitches as for flat knitting but then joining the ends of that row of stitches to form a circle. Knitting is worked in rounds (the equivalent of the rows in flat knitting), which forms the tube by winding around in a helix.

Historically, circular knitting was done using a set of four or five double-pointed needles. Modern knitters may instead use a circular needle, which resembles a pair of short knitting needles connected by a cable between them. Circular knitting can also be performed by knitting machines: a double-bed machine can be set up to knit on its front bed in one direction and then its back bed on the return, which creates the tube. Specialized knitting machines for sock-knitting use individual latch-hook needles to make each stitch in a round frame.

Many types of sweaters are traditionally knit in the round. Planned openings (arm holes, necks, cardigan fronts) are temporarily knitted with extra stitches, reinforced if necessary. Then the extra stitches are cut to create the opening, and are stitched with a sewing machine to prevent unraveling. This technique is called steeking.

== Magic loop technique ==
Invented by Sarah Hauschka and first described in Beverly Galeskas’s booklet &quot;The Magic Loop&quot;, this technique uses a long circular knitting needle (for instance 40 inches) to knit projects (of any circumference substantially less than the needle length) in the round. The key is pulling a loop of extra cable out between the stitches halfway through the round.

The magic loop technique also allows knitting two-at-a-time projects like pairs of socks or the sleeves of sweaters. This knitting both pieces at once makes it easier to render the two as similar as possible.

==Spool and machine circular knitting== 

Spool knitting is a form of circular knitting using pegs rather than needles, one peg per stitch. A variant automates the stitching action, thus producing a hand-crank circular knitting machine. Commercial knitting machines are heavy-duty powered versions of the hand-cranked ones; they may knit multiple threads at once, for speed.

<doc id="885817" wikidata="Q698387" url="?curid=885817" title="Febronianism">
<text>Febronianism was a powerful movement within the Catholic Church in Germany, in the latter part of the 18th century, directed towards nationalising Catholicism, restricting the power of the papacy in favour of the episcopate, and reunion of dissident churches with the Catholic Church. Its thrust broadly corresponded to that of Gallicanism in France. describes Febronianism, in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, as a politico-ecclesiastical system, ostensibly purposed to facilitate reconciliation of Protestant entities with the Catholic Church by curbing the Holy See&#x27;s power.

== Origin of name ==
The name is derived from the pseudonym &quot;Justinus Febronius&quot; adopted by Johann Nikolaus von Hontheim, coadjutor bishop of Trier, in publishing his book &quot;&quot;. Using Gallican principles imbibed from the canonist Zeger Bernhard van Espen at the University of Louvain, Hontheim moved to a radicalism far outstripping traditional Gallicanism. His theory of ecclesiastical organisation aimed to negate within the Catholic Church the unique authority vested in the bishop of Rome&#x27;s administration. In 1738 Hontheim went to Koblenz, as an official to the Archbishop-Elector of Trier. Archbishops of Trier were simultaneously princes and prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire. According to Walter Alison Phillips, writing in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, he thereby had ample opportunity to observe how the internal affairs of the Holy Roman Empire were subject to the Roman Curia&#x27;s meddling. This, most notably, was in negotiations preceding the elections, at which Hontheim assisted, of Holy Roman Emperors Charles VII and Francis I. On these two occasions, it appears, what had prompted his critically reviewing papal pretensions was the Papal Nuncio; his extreme claims and interference in matters before the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s electoral college. Hontheim published the results under his pseudonym. The book aroused considerable excitement and controversy at the time.

== Overview ==
The main propositions defended by Febronius were as follows. The constitution of the Church is not, by Christ&#x27;s institution, monarchical, and the pope, though entitled to a certain primacy, is subordinate to the universal Church. Though as the &quot;centre of unity&quot; he may be regarded as the guardian and champion of the ecclesiastical law, and though he may propose laws, and send legates on the affairs of his primacy, his sovereignty (&quot;&quot;) over the Church is not one of jurisdiction, but of order and collaboration (&quot;&quot;). The Roman (ultramontane) doctrine of papal infallibility is not accepted by the other Catholic Churches and, moreover, has no practical utility. The Church is based on the one episcopacy common to all bishops, the pope being only first among equals.

It follows that the pope is subject to general councils, in which the bishops are his colleagues (&quot;conjudices&quot;), not merely his consultors; nor has he the exclusive right to summon such councils. The decrees of general councils need not be confirmed by the pope nor can they be altered by him; on the other hand, appeal may be made from papal decisions to a general council. As for the rights of the popes in such matters as appeals, reservations, the confirmation, translation and deposition of bishops, these belong properly to the bishops in provincial synods, and were usurped by the papacy gradually as the result of a variety of causes, notably of the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals. The Pseudo-Isidorean Decretals, also known as the False Decretals, are a set of false documents included in a collection of canon law, some concerning the relations of the political and ecclesiastical powers, composed about the middle of the ninth century by an author who used the pseudonym &quot;Isidore Mercator&quot;. Louis Saltet, in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, wrote that the forgeries bear some of the blame for the distorted view of ecclesiastical antiquity in the Middle Ages, and they blurred the whole historical perspective.

For the health of the Church it is therefore necessary to restore matters to their condition before the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals, and to give to the episcopate its due authority. The main obstacle to this is not the pope himself, but the Curia, and this must be fought by all possible means, especially by thorough popular education (&quot;&quot;), and by the assembling of national and provincial synods, the neglect of which is the main cause of the Church&#x27;s woes. If the pope will not move in the matter, the princes, and notably the emperor, must act in co-operation with the bishops, summon national councils even against the popes will, defy his excommunication, and in the last resort refuse obedience in those matters over which the papacy has usurped jurisdiction.

== Reception of Febronianism ==
The views of Febronius were not original. In the main they were those that predominated in the Council of Constance and the Council of Basel in the 15th century; but they were backed by Hontheim with such a wealth of learning, and they fit so well into the intellectual and political conditions of the time, that they found a widespread acceptance. The identity of Febronius was known in Rome almost as soon as it was published; but it was some years later, in 1778, that Hontheim was called to retract. Meanwhile, no steps were taken against Hontheim personally, who was well known in Rome.

Lauchert wrote that in three later volumes Hontheim defended his book, as &quot;Febronius&quot; and various other pseudonyms, against a series of attacks. In addition to &quot;Judicium academicum&quot; from the University of Cologne (1765), refutations appeared from a large number of Catholic authors, Lauchert lists titles by Pietro Ballerini, Tommaso Maria Mamachi, and Francesco Antonio Zaccaria. There were also refutations written from a Protestant standpoint, to repudiate the idea that a diminution of papal power was all that was necessary to bring the Protestants back into union with the Catholic Church, for instance Lauchert lists titles by Karl Friedrich Bahrdt, Johann Friedrich Bahrdt, and Karl Gottlob Hofmann.

The book was formally condemned, 27 February 1764, by Pope Clement XIII. By a 21 May 1764 brief, Pope Clement XIII commanded all the bishops of Germany to suppress the book. The papal condemnation met with a very mixed reception; in some dioceses the order to prohibit the book was ignored, in others action upon it was postponed pending an independent examination, in yet others (nine or ten prelates, among them the Elector of Trier) it was at once obeyed for political reasons, though even in these the forbidden book became the breviary of the governments. Lauchert wrote that despite the ban, the book, harmonizing as it did with the spirit of the times, was a tremendous success and was reprinted in German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese.

The first measures against Hontheim were taken by Pope Pius VI, who urged Prince Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, Elector of Trier, to induce Hontheim to recall the book; Wenceslaus threatened to deprive not only Hontheim but all his relatives of their offices. His initial recantation was rejected by the Holy See. Hontheim, after prolonged effort, much wavering and correspondence, signed a recantation; Wenceslaus forwarded Hontheim&#x27;s corrected and revised, 15 November 1778, recantation to the Holy See. Lauchert wrote Hontheim&#x27;s recantation was not sincere as evident from his subsequent actions; his &quot;&quot;, written to justify his recantation to the public, shows Hontheim had not relinquished his ideas. This book was purported to be a proof that his submission had been made of his own free will; it carefully avoided all the most burning questions, rather tended to show as his correspondence proves that Hontheim had not essentially shifted his standpoint; but Rome, from that time forward, left him in peace and removal of the censure followed that year.

The Febronian doctrine, in fact, exactly fitted the views of the German bishops, which were by no means disinterested. The German bishops were at this time great secular princes rather than Catholic prelates; with rare exceptions, they made no pretense of carrying out their spiritual duties; they shared to the full in the somewhat shallow Enlightenment of the age. As princes of the Empire they had asserted their practical independence of the emperor; they were irked by what they considered the unjustifiable interference of the Curia with their sovereign prerogatives, and wished to establish their independence of the pope also. In the ranks of the hierarchy, then, selfish motives combined with others more respectable to secure the acceptance of the Febronian position.

Among secular rulers the welcome given to it was even less equivocal. Even so devout a sovereign as Maria Theresa of Austria refused to allow Febronius to be forbidden in the Habsburg dominions; her son, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, applied the Febronian principles with remorseless thoroughness. In Venice, in Tuscany, in Naples, in Portugal, they inspired the vigorous efforts of enlightened despots to reform the Church from above; and they gave a fresh impetus to the movement against the Jesuits, which, under pressure of the secular governments, culminated in the Suppression of the Society of Jesus by Pope Clement XIV in 1773.

According to Lauchert, the first attempt to give Febronian principles a practical application was made in Germany at the Koblenz Conference of 1769, where the three ecclesiastic prince-electors, through their delegates, and under the directions of Hontheim, compiled a list of thirty grievances against the Curia, in consonance with the principles of the &quot;Febronius&quot;; and after submitting them to Joseph II, had forwarded them to the new pope, Clement XIV. These articles, though Febronius was prohibited in the archdioceses, were wholly Febronian in tone; and, indeed, Hontheim himself took an active part in the diplomatic negotiations which were their outcome.

An attempt was made to realize the principles of the &quot;Febronius&quot; on a large scale in Austria, where under Joseph II a national Church was established according to the plan outlined. Joseph&#x27;s brother, Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, made efforts in the same direction in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Lauchert wrote that it was Austrian canonists who contributed most towards the compilation of a new law code regulating the relations of Church and State, which was used under Joseph II; especially noteworthy were the textbooks on canon law prescribed for the Austrian universities, and compiled by Paul Joseph von Riegger, by Josef Johann Nepomuk Pehem, and by Johann Valentin Eybel.

Febronius inspired the proceedings of two ecclesiastical assemblies, both held in the year 1786: the resolutions adopted along these lines at the reforming Synod of Pistoia, under Bishop Scipione de&#x27; Ricci were repudiated by the majority of the bishops of the country; more significant was the Congress of Ems, at which the three ecclesiastic prince-electors of Cologne, of Mainz and of Trier and the Prince-Bishop of the Archbishopric of Salzburg and in conformity with the basic principles of the &quot;Febronius&quot;, made a fresh attempt to readjust the relations of the German Church with Rome, with a view to securing for the former a greater measure of independence; they also had their representatives draw up twenty-three articles of the celebrated &quot;Punctation of Ems&quot;, subsequently ratified and issued by the archbishops. This document was the outcome of several years of controversy between the archbishops and the Papal Nuncios, aroused by what was considered the unjustifiable interference of the latter in the affairs of the German dioceses.

In drawing up the &quot;Punctation of Ems&quot; he took no active part, but it was wholly inspired by his principles. It consisted of twenty-three articles, which may be summarized as follows. Bishops have, in virtue of their God-given powers, full authority within their dioceses in all matters of dispensation, patronage and the like; papal bulls, briefs, etc., and the decrees of the Roman Congregations are only of binding force in each diocese when sanctioned by the bishop; nunciatures, as hitherto conceived, are to cease; the oath of allegiance to the pope demanded of bishops since Pope Gregory VII&#x27;s time is to be altered so as to bring it into conformity with episcopal rights; annates and the fees payable for the pallium and confirmation are to be lowered and, in the event of the pallium or confirmation being refused, German archbishops and bishops are to be free to exercise their office under the protection of the emperor; with the Church tribunals of first and second instance (episcopal and metropolitan) the Apostolic Nuncio to Cologne is not to interfere, and, though appeal to Rome is allowed under certain national safe-guards, the opinion is expressed that it would be better to set up in each archdiocese a final court of appeal representing the provincial synod; finally the emperor is prayed to use his influence with the pope to secure the assembly of a national council in order to remove the grievances left unredressed by the Council of Trent.

The &quot;Punctation of Ems&quot;, however, achieved no practical results.

Whether these manifestos would have led to a reconstitution of the Catholic Church on permanently Febronian lines must for ever remain doubtful. The French Revolution intervened; the German Church went down in the storm; and in 1803 the secularizations carried out by order of the First Consul put an end to the temporal ambitions of its prelates. Febronianism indeed, survived. Karl Theodor von Dalberg, prince primate of the Confederation of the Rhine, upheld its principles throughout the Napoleonic epoch and hoped to establish them in the new Germany to be created by the Congress of Vienna. He sent to this assembly, as representative of the German Church, Bishop Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg, who in his Bishopric of Constance had not hesitated to apply Febronian principles in reforming, on his own authority, the services and discipline of the Church. But the times were not favourable for such experiments. The tide of reaction after the Revolutionary turmoil was setting strongly in the direction of traditional authority, in religion as in politics; and that ultramontane movement which, before the century was ended, was to dominate the Church, was already showing signs of vigorous life. Moreover, the great national German Church of which Dalberg had a vision with himself as primate did not appeal to the German princes, tenacious of their newly acquired status as European powers. One by one these entered into concordats with Rome, and Febronianism from an aggressive policy subsided into a speculative opinion. As such it survived strongly, especially in the universities (Bonn especially had been, from its foundation in 1774, very Febronian), and it reasserted itself vigorously in the attitude of many of the most learned German prelates and professors towards the question of the definition of the Catholic dogma of Papal infallibility in 1870. It was, in fact, against the Febronian position that the decrees of the First Vatican Council were deliberately directed, and their promulgation marked the triumph of the ultramontane view. In Germany, indeed, the struggle against the papal monarchy was carried on for a while by the governments on the Kulturkampf, the Old Catholics representing militant Febronianism. The latter, however, since Otto von Bismarck &quot;went to Canossa,&quot; have sunk into a respectable but comparatively obscure sect, and Febronianism, though it still has some hold on opinion within the Church in the chapters and universities of the Rhine provinces, is practically extinct in Germany. Its revival under the guise of Modernism drew from Pope Pius X in 1908 the scathing condemnation embodied in the encyclical &quot;Pascendi dominici gregis&quot;.

<text>Scrooged is a 1988 American Christmas fantasy black comedy film directed by Richard Donner and written by Mitch Glazer and Michael O&#x27;Donoghue. Based on the 1843 novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens, &quot;Scrooged&quot; is a modern retelling that follows Bill Murray as Frank Cross, a cynical and selfish television executive who is visited by a succession of ghosts on Christmas Eve intent on helping him regain his Christmas spirit. The film also stars Karen Allen, John Forsythe, John Glover, Bobcat Goldthwait, Carol Kane, Robert Mitchum, Michael J. Pollard, and Alfre Woodard.

&quot;Scrooged&quot; was filmed on a $32 million budget over three months in New York City and Hollywood from December 1987 to March 1988. Murray returned to acting for the film after taking a four-year hiatus following the success of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, which he found overwhelming, although he had a minor role in &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;. Murray worked with Glazer and O&#x27;Donoghue on reworking the script before agreeing to join the project. The production was tumultuous, as Murray and Donner had different visions for the film. Murray described his time on the film as &quot;misery&quot;, while Donner called Murray &quot;superbly creative but occasionally difficult&quot;. Along with Murray&#x27;s three brothers, Brian, John and Joel, &quot;Scrooged&quot; features numerous celebrity cameos.

The film&#x27;s marketing capitalized on Murray&#x27;s &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; role, referring to his encounters with ghosts in both films. &quot;Scrooged&quot; was released on November 23, 1988, and grossed over $100 million worldwide. The film received a positive response from test audiences, but was met with a mixed response upon its release from critics who found the film either too mean-spirited or too sentimental. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Makeup, but lost to the fantasy-comedy film &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;.

Since its release, &quot;Scrooged&quot; has become a regular television Christmastime feature, with some critics calling it an alternative to traditional Christmas films, and others arguing that &quot;Scrooged&quot; was ahead of its time, making it relevant in the modern day. It has appeared on various lists of the best Christmas films.

== Plot ==
On December 23, Frank Cross, the ruthless and cynical president of IBC television, is preoccupied with ensuring the success of his extravagant live broadcast of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; scheduled for Christmas Eve. He launches a violent, fear-mongering advertisement for the show, and fires meek executive Eliot Loudermilk for questioning its content.

That night, Frank is visited by the ghost of his mentor Lew Heyward, who died an unloved miser and regrets not performing good deeds while alive. Lew warns a terrified Frank that he will soon be visited by three ghosts to help him avoid the same fate. Frank&#x27;s phone then mysteriously dials Claire Phillips, his ex-girlfriend. Claire visits Frank at his office, but he is too preoccupied with production issues to give her his attention. Meanwhile, Frank&#x27;s erratic behaviour leads his boss, Preston Rhinelander, to assign Brice Cummings, an ambitious acquaintance, to assist with the production. Frank deduces that Brice wants to replace him.

On Christmas Eve, Frank is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past, a chain-smoking taxi driver. The Ghost takes Frank back to his childhood Christmas in 1955, where a young Frank finds comfort in television shows to escape the neglect of his father, who dismisses Christmas traditions. Transported to 1968, a young adult Frank works through the IBC office Christmas party but also meets and falls in love with Claire. By 1971, however, his growing selfishness, workaholism, and disregard for Claire&#x27;s feelings have driven her away. Returned to the present, Frank visits Claire at the homeless shelter she runs, refusing to believe someone could be genuinely altruistic. When Claire offers to help him, Frank mocks her work and the homeless individuals she assists, including a man named Herman. He advises Claire to prioritize herself over others.

The Ghost of Christmas Present, a violent fairy, takes Frank to the apartment of his loyal assistant Grace. There, Frank witnesses her struggles to support her large family, including her youngest son Calvin, who has remained mute since witnessing his father&#x27;s death. Frank is then shown his brother, James, who, despite celebrating Christmas with his loved ones, still misses Frank&#x27;s presence after years of declined Christmas invitations and impersonal gifts. The Ghost abruptly abandons Frank in a utility space under a sidewalk, with Herman&#x27;s frozen corpse. Desperate to escape, Frank breaks through a boarded door, finding himself transported to the production set minutes before broadcast. Overwhelmed, Frank retires to his office, while Brice takes over the production.

Having since been left by his wife, who took their child, a despondent and armed Eliot arrives to kill Frank, who flees into an elevator, where he is met by the Grim Reaper-like Ghost of Christmas Future. The Ghost transports Frank to a bleak future: Calvin has been institutionalized, and Claire, having followed Frank&#x27;s advice, is now a vain and selfish socialite. Finally, Frank is shown his own cremation ceremony, attended only by James and his wife. In terror, Frank finds himself inside the coffin as it is consumed by flames, only to be jolted back to the elevator, face-to-face with Eliot.

Having experienced a profound transformation, Frank jubilantly rehires Eliot with a pay increase. With Eliot&#x27;s help, he takes over the production set, locks Brice in the control room, and interrupts the live broadcast to share his newfound appreciation for life and his belief that it is never too late to change. Frank publicly apologizes to Grace, James, and the cast and crew for his past behavior and delivers a heartfelt plea to Claire. Watching the broadcast, Claire is moved and rushes to the network with help from the Ghost of Christmas Past. As they reunite, Calvin, inspired by Frank&#x27;s words, speaks for the first time, saying, &quot;God bless us, everyone.&quot; Frank leads the crew and audience in singing &quot;Put a Little Love in Your Heart&quot; as the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, Future, Lew, and Herman look on with approval.

== Production ==
=== Development ===

&quot;Scrooged&quot; was filmed on a $32 million budget over three-and-a-half months on sets in Hollywood. Exterior shots of the IBC building were filmed outside of the Seagram Building in New York City. Murray considered himself &quot;rusty&quot; after having left acting for four years following the release of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. He described the success of that film as a phenomenon that would forever be his biggest success, compounded by the failure of &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1984) making him feel &quot;radioactive&quot; and resulting in him avoiding making movies temporarily.

Murray had the opportunity to work on &quot;Scrooged&quot; over two years earlier but was enjoying his break from work. When he did feel a desire to return to acting, he said the &quot;scripts were just not that good&quot;, and he returned to the &quot;Scrooged&quot; project as he found the idea of making a funny Scrooge appealing. Murray was paid $6 million for his role. Producer Art Linson justified the figure by saying that for each year Murray stayed away from films, his audience draw and therefore fee potentially increased. At the time, Linson said that aside from Eddie Murphy, Murray&#x27;s was the only other name that could draw $10 million of tickets in the opening three to four days.

Murray wanted several changes to the script once he joined the project; among other changes, the romantic plot with Karen Allen&#x27;s Claire was expanded, and the family scenes were reworked as Murray felt they were &quot;off&quot;. Murray worked with scriptwriters Michael O&#x27;Donoghue and Mitch Glazer (whom Murray had previously worked with on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;) until Murray was confident enough to begin filming. O&#x27;Donoghue and Glazer found the film&#x27;s denouement, in which Murray reveals his redemption live on TV, to be the most difficult to write. They settled on the example of Christmas Eve in New York, where people are nice to each other for one night, believing it to be a &quot;miracle we could live with&quot;.

Murray was concerned with how he should portray the scene, with Glazer telling him to follow the script. Wanting a central acting moment, however, Murray gave an emotional and intense performance, deviating from his marked positions and improvising his speech. Glazer and O&#x27;Donoghue thought that the actor was suffering a mental breakdown. After he was finished, the crew applauded Murray, but O&#x27;Donoghue remarked &quot;What was that? The Jim Jones hour?&quot; Donner turned and punched O&#x27;Donoghue in the arm, leaving him bruised for a week.

The production was rife with conflict between Murray and Donner. Murray described the experience as having a &quot;fair amount of misery&quot; and said &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one; I still have trouble talking about [&quot;Scrooged&quot;]&quot;, describing working on a &quot;dusty, smelly, and smokey&quot; set, feeling alone, and even coughing up blood due to the fake snow being used. He also admitted to feeling pressure from being the solo star of a film compared to previous productions like &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, as he was on set mostly every day while some actors would make brief cameos requiring only a day or two of work.

Donner himself said that he had never worked with Murray before and met up with him for drinks before accepting the project to see if they would get along; they did. The director was more positive about their relationship, describing Murray as &quot;superbly creative but occasionally difficult - as difficult as any actor.&quot; Donner said that Murray was always in a professional mental state on set, believing it made him stressed, so the crew would do &quot;silly things&quot; to improve morale. Donner had not worked with an improvisational comedian like Murray before, who ad-libbed many of his lines, saying &quot;you don&#x27;t direct [Murray], you pull him back&quot;.

In a 1990 interview with Roger Ebert, Murray said that &quot;Scrooged&quot; &quot;could have been a really, really great movie. The script was so good... [Donner] kept telling me to do things louder, louder, louder. I think he was deaf.&quot; In a later 1993 interview, Murray said that he and Donner had different visions for the type of film &quot;Scrooged&quot; would become, adding that there was potentially only one take in the finished film that was his.

In a 1989 interview, Murray said, &quot;He shot a big, long, sloppy movie&quot;, describing how a lot of filmed content was not present in the film&#x27;s final cut. For his part, O&#x27;Donoghue later said that Donner did not understand comedy, omitting the script&#x27;s subtler elements for louder and faster moments. He estimated that only 40% of his and Glazer&#x27;s original script made it into the final film and the surviving content was &quot;twisted&quot;. The final cut of the film runs for 97 minutes.

=== Casting ===
Bill Murray said that &quot;being the meanest person in the world&quot; as Frank Cross was fun. He described his challenge as having an edge but then completing Cross&#x27;s transformation into a decent person at the end. Murray said &quot;being a decent person is not that hard. But acting like one is.&quot; Carol Kane&#x27;s ghost was intended to have a body double for ballet scenes until set designer saw Kane rehearsing the dance and convinced Donner that the resulting scene would be funnier with Kane&#x27;s &quot;horrible&quot; dancing.

Donner and Murray said that Kane would sometimes experience long crying periods during filming, caused by frustration over her violent scenes. Murray also endured some physical pain during his encounters with Kane&#x27;s character, insisting that she actually hit him during their scenes together, and at one point tearing the inside of his lip when Kane pulled his lip too hard. Kane herself said &quot;I hit Bill Murray with a toaster, and with my wings, and I kicked him in areas that weren&#x27;t pleasant for him. I had fun. I don&#x27;t think it was as fun for Bill, because he was the victim! I did what the stunt people told me, but when I had to flap my wings in his face, I really couldn&#x27;t control them.&quot;

The film also features Murray&#x27;s three brothers; Joel Murray cameos as a party guest, Brian Doyle-Murray plays Frank&#x27;s father, and John Murray plays his on-screen brother James. The film also features the final appearance of the Solid Gold Dancers. Comedian Sam Kinison was considered for the role of the Ghost of Christmas Past before it went to musician David Johansen, a personal friend of Murray&#x27;s. Robert Mitchum cameos as Frank&#x27;s boss Preston Rhinelander; the actor was not interested in the small role, but Donner asked him to meet with Murray, who convinced him to take the part. Lee Majors cameos as himself in the film after being contacted directly by Donner. Majors appears in the opening scene helping to save Santa Claus. Majors was armed with a stripped-down M134 Minigun, the same one featured in &quot;Predator&quot;, which he found difficult to carry due to its weight.

== Soundtrack ==
In 1989, A&amp;M Records released the soundtrack to &quot;Scrooged&quot;, which features nine songs. Seven of the songs were released as singles: Put a Little Love in Your Heart (October 1988), &quot;The Love You Take&quot; (December 1988), &quot;The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)&quot; December 1988 &quot;We Three Kings of Orient Are&quot;, A Wonderful Life,
Sweetest Thing 1988 Christmas Must Be Tonight.

The rendition of &quot;Put a Little Love in Your Heart&quot; by Al Green and Annie Lennox spent 17 weeks in the U.S. music charts, peaking at number 9 on January 14, 1989.

== Release ==
The film&#x27;s marketing made references to Murray&#x27;s role in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, with taglines including &quot;Bill Murray is back among the ghosts, only this time, it&#x27;s three against one&quot;. &quot;Scrooged&quot; premiered in Los Angeles, California on November 17, 1988, followed by its public release on November 23, 1988.

=== Box office ===
&quot;Scrooged&quot; was a moderate box office hit on release in the United States. It earned $18.6 million during its release over its Thanksgiving-extended opening weekend in the United States at 1,262 theaters. It was the highest earning film that weekend, ahead of &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; ($8.1 million) and &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; ($6.3 million), both in their second weekend, and made &quot;Scrooged&quot; the fourth highest-opening weekend of the year.

The second weekend saw an over 40% drop, taking $7.5 million. Over the Christmas holiday period itself, the film had fallen to ninth place, behind &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; and &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;. The film left theaters after eight weeks with a total gross of $60.3 million, making it the 13th highest-grossing film of 1988.

The film grossed $40 million overseas for a worldwide total of $100.3 million.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Scrooged&quot; was released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1989 and DVD in 1999. The DVD version was scheduled for re-release on October 31, 2006 as the &quot;Yule Love It!&quot; edition. This version was to include commentary by Donner, &quot;On the set with Bill Murray&quot;, Murray&#x27;s message from the ShoWest exhibitors convention, and other featurettes including &quot;The Look of &quot;Scrooged&quot;&quot;, &quot;Updating Ebeneezer&quot;, &quot;Bringing the Ghosts to Life&quot; and &quot;Christmas to Remember&quot;. Although Paramount promoted the &quot;Yule Love It!&quot; edition with images of a custom DVD case and a retail price as late as September that year, it missed its release date and it remains unreleased. The reason for this has not been disclosed.

&quot;Scrooged&quot; was released on Blu-ray on November 1, 2011. The release featured a 1080p resolution transfer of the original film and DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 quality sound. The release was criticized for only including the film&#x27;s theatrical trailer, with Collider&#x27;s Phil Brown saying &quot;there must be some incredible behind-the-scenes stories to tell.&quot; In August 2023, Paramount Home Entertainment announced the 4K version of &quot;Scrooged&quot;, being released November 7, 2023 for the film&#x27;s 35th anniversary.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
Pre-release audience screenings in Summer 1988 were positive, with 93% of those surveyed rating the film as &quot;very good&quot;, the highest rating studio Paramount Pictures had received at the time. Press screenings nearer to release however were met with responses ranging from ovations to disgruntlement. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

On release, reviews were similarly mixed. Roger Ebert called it one of the most &quot;disquieting, unsettling films to come along in quite some time&quot;, saying that it portrays pain and anger more than comedy. &quot;Empire&quot;″s William Thomas called it a slick and cynical update of Dickens’s tale, but that it is only funny when Murray&#x27;s character is being a &quot;complete bastard&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Joe Brown said that it was a &quot;sprawling mess&quot;, but that he liked it. Brown said that &quot;Scrooged&quot; was unlikely to become a seasonal tradition like &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946) and &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1947), considering that it would age poorly and either scare or be too adult for child audiences.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″s Sheila Benson said the film&#x27;s opening is its high-point, featuring the parody IBC lineup of &quot;Robert Goulet&#x27;s Cajun Christmas&quot; and &quot;The Night the Reindeer Died&quot;, but as the film progresses the laughs become more sporadic and the tone becomes darker. Benson said that the film is a &quot;mass of sharp, well-deserved paper cuts&quot; to the entertainment industry, citing Murray&#x27;s character whose life knowledge is based on the Golden Age of Television, and Mitchum&#x27;s character who wants to add elements to the network shows that attract pet audiences, but Benson lamented that these details were never expanded upon.

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said that the story was uproarious and sometimes vitriolic, labeling it a scathing satire of the entertainment industry, that was a &quot;wild and wooly holiday feast that should scrape off the competition&quot;. Their review continued that &quot;Scrooged&quot; features &quot;wickedly amusing flashbacks&quot;, but also some overwrought comic misfires. The &quot;Radio Times&quot; John Ferguson appreciated the film, calling it a &quot;joyously black Christmas treat&quot;, but once the &quot;sentimentality starts seeping in&quot;, it seems like a misstep. A 2007 review by &quot;Den of Geek&quot; agreed, saying that the film and Murray are at their best before the redemption begins, and that the only film to come close to capturing Murray&#x27;s vitriol was &quot;Bad Santa&quot; (2003).

Jonathan Rosenbaum called &quot;Scrooged&quot; an ironic film, for seemingly condemning the commercialization of Christmas while also capitalizing on it, taking on the moral message of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, &quot;without sacrificing its yuppie priorities for an instant&quot;. Rosenbaum cited the ending in particular, wherein Frank gives his Christmas message, causing Karen to leave the needy homeless to come to his side, and both are watched over approvingly by Herman, a homeless man who froze to death. Ebert and &quot;Empire&quot; concurred about the ending. Ebert said that the necessary words are spoken by the characters, but it lacks heart, continues at embarrassing length, and seems like an onscreen breakdown. &quot;Empire&quot; also called the ending embarrassing and beyond Murray&#x27;s capabilities. Conversely, the BBC&#x27;s Ben Falk said it is hard not to join in singing at the end.

Critics were divided by Murray&#x27;s performance. Falk said that Murray is a comic genius at his best, and Brown said that he created a credible, comic character. Ferguson said that the first part of &quot;Scrooged&quot; featured Murray at &quot;his sour faced best&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called him &quot;hilariously convincing&quot; and &quot;impressively sinister&quot; as the TV executive, saying that his hip and sassy performance gives the film energy, nuttiness and charm. Their review said that his deadpan, cutting style was hilarious, but that he layers the character&#x27;s histrionics with inner sensibility that makes his eventual redemption believable and uplifting.

Conversely, Ebert said that Murray looks genuinely unhappy, and lacked the lightness and good cheer lurking beneath previous performances. Ebert also criticized Murray&#x27;s ad-libbing, blaming it for being at odds with, and blocking the flow of the story. Benson said that Murray imbued Frank Cross&#x27;s worst attributes with sincerity, making his redemption difficult to accept.

Carol Kane was praised for her performance, with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; referring to her as a &quot;certified hoot&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Sara Vilkomerson saying that she &quot;steals the show&quot; from Murray. Benson said that watching her fragile, winged character pummel Murray was &quot;strangely satisfying&quot;, although the joke eventually wore out. Benson was more positive on Woodard, saying that she offered the film&#x27;s one completely persuasive performance.

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; also praised Woodard, Mitchum, and John Glover&#x27;s credible portrayal of a sleazy executive. Both &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and Brown appreciated Goldthwait&#x27;s role, with Brown calling it &quot;twitchingly touching&quot;. Thomas called Johansen&#x27;s Ghost of Christmas Past a &quot;bonus&quot;, but he and Benson lamented the &quot;king&#x27;s ransom of actors&quot; that were wasted. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said that Elfman&#x27;s music is &quot;full blast with holiday spirit&quot;, and singled out J. Michael Riva&#x27;s production design, calling it &quot;dead on the mark funny&quot;.

O&#x27;Donoghue was very critical of the finished film. He said, &quot;We wrote a fucking masterpiece. We wrote &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934). We wrote a story that could make you laugh and cry. You would have wanted to share it with your grandchildren every fucking Christmas for the next 100 years. The finished film was a piece of unadulterated, unmitigated shit.&quot;

=== Awards ===
Make up artists Thomas R. Burman and Bari Dreiband-Burman were responsible for the film&#x27;s single nomination at the 61st Academy Awards for Best Makeup, losing to &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Since its release, &quot;Scrooged&quot; has become a cult classic and a Christmas classic, being regularly shown on television during the holiday period. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Whitney Pastorek called it an immortal classic and argued that it is the most underrated Christmas movie. Pastorek said that the film is &quot;both crude and sentimental, resonant and ludicrous...&quot;Scrooged&quot; is the perfect holiday movie for bitter, reluctant, closet Christmas lovers&quot;. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;″s Maura Johnston said that the film was ahead of its time which allowed it to remain relevant years later.

&quot;PopMatters&quot; said that their view of the ongoing commercialization of Christmas, and the film&#x27;s anticipation of marketing tactics aimed at pets watching television, made the film more relevant now than at the time of its release. In 2012, &quot;Den of Geek!&quot; described it as the &quot;finest Christmas comedy of all time&quot;. Al Green&#x27;s and Annie Lennox&#x27;s &quot;Put a Little Love in your Heart&quot; is also played regularly at Christmas despite not being about or mentioning Christmas. O&#x27;Donoghue disavowed the film before his death, stating that the script was much funnier than what ended up on screen.

Contemporary review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes offers a score of based on reviews—an average rating of , which provides the consensus: &quot;&quot;Scrooged&quot; gets by with Bill Murray and a dash of holiday spirit, although it&#x27;s hampered by a markedly conflicted tone and an undercurrent of mean-spiritedness.&quot; The film also has a score of 38 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 14 critics indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

In 2015, IGN named it the 11th-best holiday movie of all time. In 2016, &quot;Empire&quot; listed &quot;Scrooged&quot; as the seventh-best Christmas film, and in 2017, &quot;Time Out&quot; and &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; listed it as, respectively, the 12th-best and 23rd best. That same year, Collider named it the fifth-best adaptation of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, calling it is easily the best non-traditional translation of the story, and saying that it uses &quot;a classic tale of redemption as the framework for a satire of modern culture&#x27;s desire to embrace the irredeemable&quot;.

In 2018, &quot;The Ringer&quot; said that even 30 years after its debut, the film represented the perfect Christmas movie, saying it is &quot;loud, cartoonish, and misanthropic, but... remarkably well-suited for our fraught present moment&quot;. David Johansen&#x27;s New York Dolls bandmate Arthur Kane was sent into a jealous rage after seeing Johansen&#x27;s prominent role in &quot;Scrooged&quot;, reacting by beating his wife and attempting suicide by jumping from a third-story window.

<doc id="885835" wikidata="Q191704" url="?curid=885835" title="Conglomerate (geology)">
<text>Conglomerate () is a sedimentary rock made up of rounded gravel-sized pieces of rock surrounded by finer-grained sediments (such as sand, silt, or clay). The larger fragments within conglomerate are called clasts, while the finer sediment surrounding the clasts is called the matrix. The clasts and matrix are typically cemented by calcium carbonate, iron oxide, silica, or hardened clay.

Conglomerates form when rounded gravels deposited by water or glaciers become solidified and cemented by pressure over time. They can be found in sedimentary rock sequences of all ages but probably make up less than 1 percent by weight of all sedimentary rocks. They are closely related to sandstones in origin, and exhibit many of the same types of sedimentary structures, such as tabular and trough cross-bedding and graded bedding.

Fanglomerates are poorly sorted, matrix-rich conglomerates that originated as debris flows on alluvial fans and likely contain the largest accumulations of gravel in the geologic record.

Breccias are similar to conglomerates, but have clasts that have angular (rather than rounded) shapes.

== Classification of conglomerates ==
Conglomerates may be named and classified by the:
* Amount and type of matrix present
* Composition of gravel-size clasts they contain
* Size range of gravel-size clasts present
The classification method depends on the type and detail of research being conducted.

A sedimentary rock composed largely of gravel is first named according to the roundness of the gravel. If the gravel clasts that comprise it are largely well-rounded to subrounded, it is a &quot;conglomerate.&quot; If the gravel clasts that comprise it are largely angular, it is a breccia. Such breccias can be called sedimentary breccias to differentiate them from other types of breccia, e.g. volcanic and fault breccias. Sedimentary rocks that contain a mixture of rounded and angular gravel clasts are sometimes called breccio-conglomerate.

===Texture===
Conglomerates contain at least 30% of rounded to subangular clasts larger than in diameter, e.g., granules, pebbles, cobbles, and boulders. However, conglomerates are rarely composed entirely of gravel-size clasts. Typically, the space between the gravel-size clasts is filled by a mixture composed of varying amounts of silt, sand, and clay, known as &quot;matrix&quot;. If the individual gravel clasts in a conglomerate are separated from each other by an abundance of matrix such that they are not in contact with each other and &quot;float&quot; within the matrix, it is called a paraconglomerate. Paraconglomerates are also often unstratified and can contain more matrix than gravel clasts. If the gravel clasts of a conglomerate are in contact with each other, it is called an orthoconglomerate. Unlike paraconglomerates, orthoconglomerates are typically cross-bedded and often well-cemented and lithified by either calcite, hematite, quartz, or clay.

The differences between paraconglomerates and orthoconglomerates reflect differences in how they are deposited. Paraconglomerates are commonly either glacial tills or debris flow deposits. Orthoconglomerates are typically associated with aqueous currents.


===Clast composition===
Conglomerates are also classified according to the composition of their clasts. A conglomerate or any clastic sedimentary rock that consists of a single rock or mineral is known as either a monomict, monomictic, oligomict, or oligomictic conglomerate. If the conglomerate consists of two or more different types of rocks, minerals, or combination of both, it is known as either a polymict or polymictic conglomerate. If a polymictic conglomerate contains an assortment of the clasts of metastable and unstable rocks and minerals, it is called either a petromict or petromictic conglomerate.

In addition, conglomerates are classified by source as indicated by the lithology of the gravel-size clasts If these clasts consist of rocks and minerals that are significantly different in lithology from the enclosing matrix and, thus, older and derived from outside the basin of deposition, the conglomerate is known as an extraformational conglomerate. If these clasts consist of rocks and minerals that are identical to or consistent with the lithology of the enclosing matrix and, thus, and derived from within the basin of deposition, the conglomerate is known as an intraformational conglomerate.

Two recognized types of intraformational conglomerates are shale-pebble and flat-pebble conglomerates. A shale-pebble conglomerate is a conglomerate that is composed largely of clasts of rounded mud chips and pebbles held together by clay minerals and created by erosion within environments such as within a river channel or along a lake margin. Flat-pebble conglomerates (edgewise conglomerates) are conglomerates that consist of relatively flat clasts of lime mud created by either storms or tsunami eroding a shallow sea bottom or tidal currents eroding tidal flats along a shoreline.

===Clast size===
Finally, conglomerates are often differentiated and named according to the dominant clast size comprising them. In this classification, a conglomerate composed largely of granule-size clasts would be called a granule conglomerate; a conglomerate composed largely of pebble-size clasts would be called a pebble conglomerate; and a conglomerate composed largely of cobble-size clasts would be called a cobble conglomerate.

==Sedimentary environments==
Conglomerates are deposited in a variety of sedimentary environments.

===Deepwater marine===
In turbidites, the basal part of a bed is typically coarse-grained and sometimes conglomeratic. In this setting, conglomerates are normally very well sorted, well-rounded and often with a strong A-axis type imbrication of the clasts.

===Shallow marine===
Conglomerates are normally present at the base of sequences laid down during marine transgressions above an unconformity, and are known as basal conglomerates. They represent the position of the shoreline at a particular time and are diachronous.

===Fluvial===
Conglomerates deposited in fluvial environments are typically well rounded and poorly sorted. Clasts of this size are carried as bedload and only at times of high flow-rate. The maximum clast size decreases as the clasts are transported further due to attrition, so conglomerates are more characteristic of immature river systems. In the sediments deposited by mature rivers, conglomerates are generally confined to the basal part of a channel fill where they are known as &quot;pebble lags&quot;. Conglomerates deposited in a fluvial environment often have an AB-plane type imbrication.

===Alluvial===

Alluvial deposits form in areas of high relief and are typically coarse-grained. At mountain fronts individual alluvial fans merge to form braidplains and these two environments are associated with the thickest deposits of conglomerates. The bulk of conglomerates deposited in this setting are clast-supported with a strong AB-plane imbrication. Matrix-supported conglomerates, as a result of debris-flow deposition, are quite commonly associated with many alluvial fans. When such conglomerates accumulate within an alluvial fan, in rapidly eroding (e.g., desert) environments, the resulting rock unit is often called a &quot;fanglomerate&quot;.

===Glacial===
Glaciers carry a lot of coarse-grained material and many glacial deposits are conglomeratic. tillites, the sediments deposited directly by a glacier, are typically poorly sorted, matrix-supported conglomerates. The matrix is generally fine-grained, consisting of finely milled rock fragments. Waterlaid deposits associated with glaciers are often conglomeratic, forming structures such as eskers.

==Examples==
An example of conglomerate can be seen at Montserrat, near Barcelona. Here, erosion has created vertical channels that give the characteristic jagged shapes the mountain is named for (Montserrat literally means &quot;jagged mountain&quot;). The rock is strong enough to use as a building material, as in the Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey.

Another example, the Crestone Conglomerate, occurs in and near the town of Crestone, at the foot of the Sangre de Cristo Range in Colorado&#x27;s San Luis Valley. The Crestone Conglomerate consists of poorly sorted fanglomerates that accumulated in prehistoric alluvial fans and related fluvial systems. Some of these rocks have hues of red and green.

Conglomerate cliffs are found on the east coast of Scotland from Arbroath northwards along the coastlines of the former counties of Angus and Kincardineshire. Dunnottar Castle sits on a rugged promontory of conglomerate jutting into the North Sea just south of the town of Stonehaven.

Copper Harbor Conglomerate is found both in the Keweenaw Peninsula and Isle Royale National Park in Lake Superior.

Conglomerate may also be seen in the domed hills of Kata Tjuta, in Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory or in the Buda Hills in Hungary.

In the nineteenth century a thick layer of Pottsville conglomerate was recognized to underlie anthracite coal measures in Pennsylvania.

===Examples on Mars===
On Mars, slabs of conglomerate have been found at an outcrop named &quot;Hottah&quot;, and have been interpreted by scientists as having formed in an ancient streambed. The gravels, which were discovered by NASA&#x27;s Mars rover Curiosity, range from the size of sand particles to the size of golf balls. Analysis has shown that the pebbles were deposited by a stream that flowed at walking pace and was ankle- to hip-deep.

==Metaconglomerate==
Metamorphic alteration transforms conglomerate into metaconglomerate.

<doc id="885841" wikidata="Q418946" url="?curid=885841" title="Colistin">
<text>Colistin, also known as polymyxin E, is an antibiotic medication used as a last-resort treatment for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections including pneumonia. These may involve bacteria such as &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, or &quot;Acinetobacter&quot;. It comes in two forms: colistimethate sodium can be injected into a vein, injected into a muscle, or inhaled, and colistin sulfate is mainly applied to the skin or taken by mouth. Colistimethate sodium is a prodrug; it is produced by the reaction of colistin with formaldehyde and sodium bisulfite, which leads to the addition of a sulfomethyl group to the primary amines of colistin. Colistimethate sodium is less toxic than colistin when administered parenterally. In aqueous solutions, it undergoes hydrolysis to form a complex mixture of partially sulfomethylated derivatives, as well as colistin. Resistance to colistin began to appear as of 2015.
Common side effects of the injectable form include kidney problems and neurological problems. Other serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, muscle weakness, and &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;-associated diarrhea. The inhaled form may result in constriction of the bronchioles. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the fetus. Colistin is in the polymyxin class of medications. It works by breaking down the cytoplasmic membrane, which generally results in bacterial cell death.
Colistin was discovered in 1947 and colistimethate sodium was approved for medical use in the United States in 1970. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies colistin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. It is derived from bacteria of the genus &quot;Paenibacillus&quot;.
==Medical uses==

=== Antibacterial spectrum ===
Colistin has been effective in treating infections caused by &quot;Pseudomonas, Escherichia&quot;, and &quot;Klebsiella&quot; species. The following represents minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms:
* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;: 0.12–128 μg/mL
* &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;: 0.25–128 μg/mL
* &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;: ≤0.06–16 μg/mL

For example, colistin in combination with other drugs is used to attack &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; biofilm infection in lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis. Biofilms have a low-oxygen environment below the surface where bacteria are metabolically inactive, and colistin is highly effective in this environment. However, &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; reside in the top layers of the biofilm, where they remain metabolically active. This is because surviving tolerant cells migrate to the top of the biofilm via pili and form new aggregates via quorum sensing.

=== Administration and dosage ===

==== Forms ====
Two forms of colistin are available commercially: colistin sulfate and colistimethate sodium (colistin methanesulfonate sodium, colistin sulfomethate sodium). Colistin sulfate is cationic; colistimethate sodium is anionic. Colistin sulfate is stable, whereas colistimethate sodium is readily hydrolysed to a variety of methanesulfonated derivatives. Colistin sulfate and colistimethate sodium are eliminated from the body by different routes. With respect to &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, colistimethate is the inactive prodrug of colistin. The two drugs are not interchangeable.
* Colistimethate sodium may be used to treat &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, and it has come into recent use for treating multidrug-resistant &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; infection, although resistant forms have been reported. Colistimethate sodium has also been given intrathecally and intraventricularly in &quot;Acinetobacter baumannii&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; meningitis and ventriculitis Some studies have indicated that colistin may be useful for treating infections caused by carbapenem-resistant isolates of &quot;Acinetobacter baumannii&quot;.
* Colistin sulfate may be used to treat intestinal infections, or to suppress colonic flora. Colistin sulfate is also used in topical creams, powders, and otic solutions.
* Colistin A (polymyxin E1) and colistin B (polymyxin E2) can be purified individually to research and study their effects and potencies as separate compounds.

==== Dosage ====
Colistin sulfate and colistimethate sodium may both be given intravenously, but the dosing is complicated. The different labeling of the parenteral products of colistin methanesulfonate in different parts of the world was noted by Li et al. Colistimethate sodium manufactured by Xellia (Colomycin injection) is prescribed in international units, whereas colistimethate sodium manufactured by Parkdale Pharmaceuticals (Coly-Mycin M Parenteral) is prescribed in milligrams of colistin base:
* Colomycin 1,000,000 units is 80 mg colistimethate;
* Coly-mycin M 150 mg colistin base is 360 mg colistimethate or 4,500,000 units.

Because colistin was introduced into clinical practice over 50 years ago, it was never subject to the regulations that modern drugs are subject to, and therefore there is no standardised dosing of colistin and no detailed trials on pharmacology or pharmacokinetics. The optimal dosing of colistin for most infections is therefore unknown. Colomycin has a recommended intravenous dose of 1 to 2 million units three times daily for patients weighing 60 kg or more with normal renal function. Coly-Mycin has a recommended dose of 2.5 to 5 mg/kg colistin base a day, which is equivalent to 6 to 12 mg/kg colistimethate sodium per day. For a 60 kg man, therefore, the recommended dose for Colomycin is 240 to 480 mg of colistimethate sodium, yet the recommended dose for Coly-Mycin is 360 to 720 mg of colistimethate sodium. Likewise, the recommended &quot;maximum&quot; dose for each preparation is different (480 mg for Colomycin and 720 mg for Coly-Mycin). Each country has different generic preparations of colistin, and the recommended dose depends on the manufacturer. This complete absence of any regulation or standardisation of dose makes intravenous colistin dosing difficult for the physician. 

Colistin has been used in combination with rifampicin; evidence of &quot;in vitro&quot; synergy exists, and the combination has been used successfully in patients. There is also &quot;in vitro&quot; evidence of synergy for colistimethate sodium used in combination with other antipseudomonal antibiotics.

Colistimethate sodium aerosol (Promixin; Colomycin Injection) is used to treat pulmonary infections, especially in cystic fibrosis. In the UK, the recommended adult dose is 1–2 million units (80–160 mg) nebulised colistimethate twice daily. Nebulized colistin has also been used to decrease severe exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and infection with &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;.

=== Resistance ===
Resistance to colistin is rare, but has been described. , no agreement exists about how to define colistin resistance. The uses a MIC cut-off of 2 mg/L, whereas the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy sets a MIC cutoff of 4 mg/L or less as sensitive, and 8 mg/L or more as resistant. No standards for describing colistin sensitivity are given in the United States.

The first known colistin-resistance gene in a plasmid which can be transferred between bacterial strains is &quot;mcr-1&quot;. It was found in 2011 in China on a pig farm where colistin is routinely used and became publicly known in November 2015. The presence of this plasmid-borne gene was confirmed starting December 2015 in South-East Asia, several European countries, and the United States. It is found in certain strains of the bacteria &quot;Paenibacillus polymyxa&quot;.

India reported the first detailed colistin-resistance study, which mapped 13 colistin-resistant infections recorded over 18 months. It concluded that pan-drug-resistant infections, particularly those in the bloodstream, have a higher mortality. Multiple other cases were reported from other Indian hospitals. Although resistance to polymyxins is generally less than 10%, it is more frequent in the Mediterranean and South-East Asia (Korea and Singapore), where colistin resistance rates are increasing. Colistin-resistant &quot;E. coli&quot; was identified in the United States in May 2016.

A recent review from 2016 to 2021 fount that E. coli is the dominant species harbouring mcr genes. Plasmid - mediated colistin resistance is also conferred upon other species that carry different genes resistant to antibiotics. The emergence of the &quot;mcr-9&quot; gene is quite remarkable.

Use of colistin to treat &quot;Acinetobacter baumannii&quot; infections has led to the development of resistant bacterial strains. They have also developed resistance to the antimicrobial compounds LL-37 and lysozyme, produced by the human immune system. This cross-resistance is caused by gain-of-function mutations to the &quot;pmrB&quot; gene, which controls the expression of lipid A phosphoethanolamine transferases (similar to &quot;mcr-1&quot;) located on the bacterial chromosome. Similar results have been obtained with &quot;mcr-1&quot; positive &quot;E. coli&quot;, which became better at surviving a mixture of animal antimicrobial peptides &quot;in vitro&quot; and more effective at killing infected caterpillars.

Not all resistance to colistin and some other antibiotics is due to the presence of resistance genes. Heteroresistance, the phenomenon wherein apparently genetically identical microbes exhibit a range of resistance to an antibiotic, has been observed in some species of &quot;Enterobacter&quot; since at least 2016 and was observed in some strains of &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; in 2017–2018. In some cases this phenomenon has significant clinical consequences.

== Adverse reactions ==
The main toxicities described with intravenous treatment are nephrotoxicity (damage to the kidneys) and neurotoxicity (damage to the nerves), but this may reflect the very high doses given, which are much higher than the doses currently recommended by any manufacturer and for which no adjustment was made for pre-existing renal disease. Neuro- and nephrotoxic effects appear to be transient and subside on discontinuation of therapy or reduction in dose.

At a dose of 160 mg colistimethate IV every eight hours, very little nephrotoxicity is seen. Indeed, colistin appears to have less toxicity than the aminoglycosides that subsequently replaced it, and it has been used for extended periods up to six months with no ill effects. Colistin-induced nephrotoxicity is particularly likely in patients with hypoalbuminemia.

The main toxicity described with aerosolised treatment is bronchospasm, which can be treated or prevented with the use of β2-adrenergic receptor agonists such as salbutamol or following a desensitisation protocol.

== Mechanism of action ==
Colistin is a polycationic peptide and has both hydrophilic and lipophilic moieties. These cationic regions interact with the bacterial outer membrane by displacing magnesium and calcium bacterial counter ions in the lipopolysaccharide. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions interact with the cytoplasmic membrane just like a detergent, solubilizing the membrane in an aqueous environment. This effect is bactericidal even in an isosmolar environment.

Colistin binds to lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids in the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It competitively displaces divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) from the phosphate groups of membrane lipids, which leads to disruption of the outer cell membrane, leakage of intracellular contents and bacterial death.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
No clinically useful absorption of colistin occurs in the gastrointestinal tract. For systemic infection, colistin must therefore be given by injection.
Colistimethate is eliminated by the kidneys, but colistin is eliminated by non-renal mechanism(s) that are as of yet not characterised.

== History ==
Colistin was first isolated in Japan in 1949 by Y. Koyama, from a flask of fermenting &quot;Bacillus&quot; &quot;polymyxa&quot; var. &quot;colistinus&quot;, and became available for clinical use in 1959.

Colistimethate sodium, a less toxic prodrug, became available for injection in 1959. In the 1980s, polymyxin use was widely discontinued because of nephro- and neurotoxicity. As multi-drug resistant bacteria became more prevalent in the 1990s, colistin started to get a second look as an emergency solution, in spite of toxicity.

Colistin has also been used in agriculture, particularly in China from the 1980s onwards. Chinese production for agriculture exceeded 2700 tons in 2015. China banned colistin use for livestock growth promotion in 2016.

==Biosynthesis==
The biosynthesis of colistin requires the use of three amino acids: threonine, leucine, and 2,4-diaminobutryic acid. The linear form of colistin is synthesized before cyclization. Non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis begins with a loading module and then the addition of each subsequent amino acid. The subsequent amino acids are added with the help of an adenylation domain (A), a peptidyl carrier protein domain (PCP), an epimerization domain (E), and a condensation domain (C). Cyclization is accomplished by a thioesterase. The first step is to have a loading domain, 6-methylheptanoic acid, associate with the A and PCP domains. Now with a C, A, and PCP domain that is associated with 2,4-diaminobutryic acid. This continues with each amino acid until the linear peptide chain is completed. The last module will have a thioesterase to complete the cyclization and form the product colistin.

<text>Johann Nikolaus von Hontheim (January 27, 1701 – September 2, 1790) was a German priest and coadjutor bishop of Trier, and a
historian/theologian. He is remembered as Febronius, the pseudonym under which he wrote his 1763 treatise &quot;On the State of the Church and the Legitimate Power of the Roman Pontiff&quot; and which gave rise to febronianism.

==Biography==
Born in Trier, he belonged to a noble family which had been for many generations connected with the court and government of the Electors of Trier, his father, Kaspar von Hontheim, was receiver-general of the Electorate. At the age of twelve, young Hontheim was given by his maternal uncle, Hugo Frederick von Anethan, canon of the collegiate church of St Simeon (which at that time still occupied the Roman Porta Nigra at Trier), a prebend in his church, and on May 13, 1713, he received the tonsure. He was educated by the Jesuits at Trier and at the universities of Trier, Leuven, and Leiden, taking his degree of doctor of laws at Trier in 1724. The works of the Louvain professor Zeger Bernhard van Espen and his Gallican doctrine had a great influence on Hontheim.

During the following years, he traveled in various European countries, spending some time at the German College in Rome; in 1728, he was ordained a priest, and, formally admitted to the chapter of St. Simeon in 1732, he became a professor of the Pandects at the University of Trier.

In 1738 he was sent on official duty by the Elector to Coblenz, where he discharged the duties of official and president of the Grand Séminaire of that city. In that capacity, he had plenty of opportunities to study the effect of the influence of the Roman Curia on the internal affairs of the Empire, notably in the negotiations that preceded the elections of the emperors Charles VII and Francis I, in which Hontheim took part as an assistant to the electoral ambassador. It appears that it was the claims of the papal nuncio on these occasions, and his interference in the affairs of the electoral college, that first suggested to Hontheim that a critical examination of the basis of the papal involvement was needed (the results of which he afterwards published to the world under the pseudonym of Febronius).

In 1747, broken down by overwork, he resigned his position as an official and retired to St. Simeon, of which he was elected dean in the following year. In May 1748 he was appointed by the archbishop-elector Francis George von Schönborn as his auxiliary bishop, being consecrated at Mainz, in February 1749, under the title of bishop of Myriophiri &quot;in partibus&quot;. Upon Hontheim as auxiliary bishop and vicar-general fell the whole spiritual administration of the diocese; this work, in addition to that of pro-chancellor of the university, he carried on single-handed until 1778, when Jean-Marie Cuchot d&#x27;Herbain was appointed his coadjutor. On April 21, 1779, he resigned the deanery of St. Simeon&#x27;s on the grounds of old age.

He was a man of short stature, energetic, hard-working, pious, and generous. He died on September 2, 1790, at Château de Montquintin near Orval, an estate which he had purchased. He was buried at first in St. Simeon&#x27;s; but the church was ruined by the French during the revolutionary wars and never restored, and in 1803 the body of Hontheim was transferred to that of St Gervasius.
==Historian==
As a historian, Hontheim&#x27;s reputation rests on his contributions to the history of Trier. During the period of his activity as an official at Coblenz he found time to collect a vast mass of printed and manuscript material, which he afterwards embodied in three works on the history of Trier. Of these, the &quot;Historia Trevirensis diplomatica et pragmatica&quot; was published in 3 folio volumes in 1750, the &quot;Prodromus historiae Trevirensis&quot; in 2 volumes in 1757. Besides a history of Trier and its constitution, they give a large number of documents and references to published authorities. A third work, the &quot;Historiae scriptorum et monumentarum Trevirensis omptissima collectio&quot;, remains in manuscript in the city library of Trier. These books, the result of an enormous labor in collation and selection in very unfavorable circumstances, entitle Hontheim to the fame of a pioneer in modern historical methods.

It is, however, as Febronius that Hontheim is best remembered. His 1763 treatise &quot;On the State of the Church and the Legitimate Power of the Roman Pontiff&quot; offered Europe the &quot;foremost formulation of the arguments against papal absolutism in Germany&quot;. The author of the book was known in Rome almost as soon as it was published, but it was not until some years afterwards (1778) that he was called on to retract. Threatened with excommunication and faced with the prospect of his relations losing their offices, Hontheim, after much vacillation and correspondence, signed a submission which was accepted in Rome as satisfactory. The removal of the censure followed (1781) when Hontheim published in Frankfurt what purported to be proof that his submission had been made of his own free will (&quot;Justini Febronii acti commentarius in suam retractationem&quot;, etc.). This book, however, which carefully avoided all the most burning questions, rather tended to show – as indeed his correspondence proves – that Hontheim had not essentially shifted his opinion.

<doc id="885845" wikidata="Q5769836" url="?curid=885845" title="Hiring hall">
<text>In organized labor, a hiring hall is an organization, usually under the auspices of a labor union, which has the responsibility of furnishing new recruits for employers who have a collective bargaining agreement with the union. It may also refer to a physical union hall, the office from which the union may conduct its activities.

The employer&#x27;s use of the hiring hall may be voluntary, or it may be compulsory by the terms of the employer&#x27;s collective agreement with a union. Exclusive use of a hiring hall effectively turns employers into a &quot;closed shop&quot; because employees must join the union before they can be hired.

Arguments in favor of the institution include that the presence of a hiring hall places the responsibility on the union to ensure that its members are suitably qualified and responsible individuals before assigning them to an employer. The union will often enforce a basic code of conduct among its members to ensure smooth operation of the hiring hall (to prevent members from double-booking, for example). If a hiring hall is reputable, the relationship between the union and the employer can be relatively harmonious. There are arguments that this actually benefits contractors who hire employees for the duration of a specific job. This is primarily due to the union handling qualifications and other eligibility requirements. Additionally, the union will also maintain employment records on the individual, meaning that behavior issues from other employers can be documented and reacted to. Thus there is a strong incentive to maintain good conduct to keep union membership. Workers benefit from having a more stable source of benefits such as insurance and pension plans. Contractors are still responsible for paying into these plans, but union members are more protected from lapses in coverage.

== Usage by industry ==
In the early 1900s hiring practices in the precarious maritime industry varied, ranging from outright criminal corruption, to favoritism and employer hiring agencies. With the passage of the 1935 Wagner Act, union hiring halls replaced previous hiring procedures. It shifted power towards unions, including a preference for union membership. In cases where union-membership was a legal prerequisite for being hired, this is called a closed-shop. While corruption was reduced, it still allowed for union corruption, for example dispelling dissidents or dual-union members. The Taft-Hartley Act intended to reduce union influence or discrimination here to non-union members, effectively curbing closed-shop practices while permitting union hiring halls to continue to exist.

In building and construction trade, due to the scattered nature of workplaces and bidding projects, both the employees and employers have a symbiotic need for steady employment and skilled labor respectively, which are facilitated in the various craft union controlled hiring halls.

Employment in the film industry in the 1950s became more differentiated, due to anti-trust rulings, e.g United States v. Paramount Pictures which divested studios from exclusive contracts with specific theaters. Film production itself became heavily distributed, with post-production, editing being fulfilled by different contracts rather than centrally. Recruiting talent was no longer based on employment in a single firm, but through a roster that measured seniority within the industry. These rosters were maintained by talent guilds and unions such as IATSE, SAG-AFTRA, Actors&#x27; Equity Association.

Uber has been described as a for-profit hiring hall, to the benefit of Uber, rather than the drivers.

The prevalence of compulsory hiring hall arrangements in Canada varies from trade to trade and from province to province, since labor law there is under provincial jurisdiction. The situation in Europe also varies from country to country.

<doc id="885850" wikidata="Q2300314" url="?curid=885850" title="Jersey barrier">
<text>A Jersey barrier, Jersey wall, or Jersey bump is a modular concrete or plastic barrier employed to separate lanes of traffic. It is designed to minimize vehicle damage in cases of incidental contact while still preventing vehicle crossovers resulting in a likely head-on collision. Jersey barriers are also used to reroute traffic and protect pedestrians and workers during highway construction. They are named after the U.S. state of New Jersey which first started using the barriers as separators between lanes of a highway in the 1950s. 

The barriers are also known as a K-rail, a term stipulated in the California Department of Transportation specification for temporary concrete traffic barriers which first started using concrete median barriers in the mid-1940s. 

Over time, different variants were created. Taller variants, such as the Ontario Tall Wall, proved more effective at stopping vehicles and had the added advantage of blocking most oncoming headlights. More modular variants, including plastic water-filled barriers, have been created.

==Development and use==

Although it is not clear exactly when or where the first concrete median barriers were used, concrete median barriers were used in the mid-1940s on U.S. Route 99 on the descent from the Tehachapi Mountains in the Central Valley south of Bakersfield, California. This first generation of concrete barriers was developed to minimize the number of out-of-control trucks penetrating the barrier and eliminate the need for costly and dangerous median barrier maintenance in high-accident locations with narrow medians.

The Jersey barrier, also called New Jersey wall, was developed in the 1950s (introduced in current form in 1959), at Stevens Institute of Technology, New Jersey, United States, under the direction of the New Jersey State Highway Department to divide multiple lanes on a highway. A typical Jersey barrier stands tall and is made of steel-reinforced poured concrete or plastic. Many are constructed with the embedded steel reinforcement protruding from each end, allowing them to be incorporated into permanent emplacements when linked to one another by sections of fresh concrete poured on-site.

Their widespread use in road construction has led to wide application as a generic, portable barrier during construction projects and temporary rerouting of traffic into stopgap carpool and rush-hour reversing highway lanes.

Most of the original barriers constructed in New Jersey in the 1950s and early 1960s were not &quot;modular&quot;; they were formed from concrete poured in place. Many of the first installations (Route 46 in Bergen County and Passaic County, for instance) were about tall, much shorter than modern heights. Some dividers on county or local roads may have been lower than that, since they replaced a raised concrete rumble strip that would dissuade, but not prevent, traffic crossing from one lane to another. Route 46 had a rumble strip in many places before the higher barrier was gradually installed. These lower dividers are visible in old photographs. When the Bergen Mall was first opened in Paramus, New Jersey, rumble strip dividers were extensively used on the roadway (Forest Avenue) that separated the grocery stores from the mall proper.

The design of the Jersey barrier was specifically intended to minimize damage in incidental accidents and reduce the likelihood of a car crossing into oncoming lanes in the event of a collision. In common shallow-angle hits, sheet-metal damage is minimized by allowing the vehicle tires to ride up on the lower sloped face. Head-on vehicle collisions are minimized by gradually lifting the vehicle and pivoting it away from oncoming vehicles and back into traffic heading in its original direction.

The New Jersey Turnpike Authority developed and tested a similar, but heavily reinforced, design. This barrier design has been credited with effectively containing and redirecting larger vehicles, including semi-trailer (tractor-trailer) trucks. The states of New York, Massachusetts and New Jersey have adopted the taller barrier for their roads, as compared to the standard suggested by the Federal Highway Administration.

Designs with two rectangular notches at the bottom (through the short axis) allow for forklift-style lifting by front-end loaders. Barriers meant for short-term placement, especially in military and security barrier uses, might include steel rebar loops embedded in the top surface for rapid hook-and-cable system lifting.

The 2010 G-20 Toronto summit used modified modular Jersey barriers with wired fencing bolted onto the concrete. The fence used the barrier as sturdy base to prevent protesters from toppling the fence around the security zone at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.
The U.S. military nicknamed the devices &quot;Qaddafi Blocks&quot; after truck bomb attacks in Beirut in 1983 resulted in more widespread use in military installations. Sometimes they are deployed to form a chicane to slow vehicular traffic arriving at military installations or other secure areas. During the US occupation of Iraq jersey barriers were set up in cities as form of urban warfare to combat Iraqi resistance.

The Ohio Department of Transportation mandates specific design requirements for their precast concrete barrier walls. The department has marked all compliant precast concrete barrier walls with &quot;350&quot;, indicating that they adhere to the requirements laid out in the National Cooperative Highway Research Program&#x27;s Report 350. Without this marking, a barrier wall is not approved for use in Ohio.

==Variations==
Modern variations include the constant-slope barrier and the F-shape barrier. The F-shape is generally similar to the Jersey barrier in appearance, but is taller, with somewhat different angles.

The UK equivalent is the concrete step barrier.

First tested in 1968 by the then Department of Highways in Ontario, Canada, the Ontario Tall Wall is a variant of the Jersey barrier. Standing at , it is taller than the standard Jersey barrier. Ontario&#x27;s Ministry of Transportation has been replacing guiderails (steel guardrail and steel box-beam) with these tall wall barriers on 400-series highways since the early 1990s, while the City of Toronto is doing likewise on portions of the Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway.

===Plastic Jersey barriers===
Hollow polyethylene barriers have been developed for short-term applications where portability is important. These plastic barriers are normally filled with water after placement on-site to provide a moderate level of crash protection, then emptied prior to removal. They are not designed to deflect vehicles, so vehicles may penetrate the barriers. These barriers can also be filled with sand at the cost of reduced portability.

<doc id="885854" wikidata="Q5021202" url="?curid=885854" title="California ballot proposition">
<text>In California, a ballot proposition is a referendum or an initiative measure that is submitted to the electorate for a direct decision or direct vote (or plebiscite). If passed, it can alter one or more of the articles of the Constitution of California, one or more of the 29 California Codes, or another law in the California Statutes by clarifying current or adding statute(s) or removing current statute(s).

Measures can be placed on the ballot either by the California State Legislature or via a petition signed by registered voters. The state legislature can place a state constitutional amendment or a proposed law change on the ballot as a referendum to be approved by voters. Under the state constitution, certain proposed changes to state laws may require mandatory referendums, and must be approved by voters before they can take effect. A measure placed on the ballot via petition can either be a vote to veto a law that has been adopted by the legislature (an optional referendum or &quot;people&#x27;s veto&quot;) or a new proposed law (initiative).

==Overview==

There are three forms of direct democracy in California state elections: mandatory referendums (part of the Constitution of California since 1856), optional referendums, and initiatives. 

The initiative and optional (or facultative) referendum were introduced as Progressive Era reforms in 1911, by a constitutional amendment called Proposition 7. According to the Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute at USC, Gov. Hiram Johnson supported the creation of this process to balance the power that corporations, specifically Southern Pacific Railroad, had over legislators. In 2022, with Democrats having a super-majority in both houses of the legislature, corporations have been using this process to challenge the power that unions and other progressive activists currently yield in the legislature. 

California Senate Bill 202, passed in 2011, mandated that initiatives and optional referendums can appear only on the November general election ballot, a statute that was controversial at the time, being seen as a self-serving, single-party initiative; the November general election rule for initiatives and optional referendums has nevertheless persisted.

===Initiatives===
The minimum number of signatures for an initiative petition is at least 8 percent (for an amendment to the state constitution) or 5 percent (for a statute) of the number of people who voted in the most recent election for governor. For 2020 and 2022, the minimum number of required signatures needed to be collected is 623,212 for a proposed statute, and 997,139 for a proposed constitutional amendment.

The filing fee for submitting an initiative to the ballot was increased from $200 to $2,000 following the signing of a law in September 2015. This fee is refunded if the proposition makes it to the ballot. The $200 fee had been originally set in 1943, and the State Legislature felt that it needed to be increased to discourage people from proposing frivolous or improper measures for the ballot.

Before initiative proponents may gather signatures, the Attorney General prepares an official title and summary for the proposed law, and the California Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Office submits a report on its estimated fiscal effects. There is a 30-day public review period that begins after the Attorney General receives the submission and the filing fee, where any member of the public may submit public comments on the proposed initiative. The Attorney General then prepares the official title and summary after the public review period. The Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Office has 50 days after receiving the final version of the proposed measure to prepare its report, and the Attorney General has 15 days after receiving these fiscal estimates to send the final official version of the title and summary to both the Secretary of State and the initiative proponents.

After gaining approval, proponents have 180 days to gather the required number of signatures (the Secretary of State sets the official deadline within one day after receiving the title and summary from the Attorney General). Proponents usually seek at least 50 percent more than the legal minimum number of signatures to compensate for possible duplicate or otherwise invalid signatures.

Proponents who have gathered at least 25 percent of the required number of signatures must immediately submit a written statement to the Secretary of State certifying they have done so. This is to allow time for each chamber in the State Legislature to assign the proposed initiative to its appropriate committees and schedule public hearings on it. However, the Legislature cannot amend the proposed initiative or prevent it from being added to the ballot once it qualifies.

After all the signed petitions have been collected, proponents need to turn them in to each appropriate county elections official (i.e. all the signatures from those in Alameda County need to be submitted to the Alameda County elections official, Los Angeles County signatures need to be turned in to the LA County elections official, and so on). Each county then has eight working days after receiving the signed petitions to report the raw count of signatures to the Secretary of State, who then determines if the counties can proceed with verifying the signatures or if the initiative proponents failed to get the required number of signatures.

In verifying the signatures, the counties first take a random sample of 3 percent or 500 of the signatures, whichever is greater, and have 30 working days to report their findings to the Secretary of State. If a county received less than 500, it is to verify all of them. If the statewide random sample total projects more than 110 percent of the required number of signatures, the initiative automatically qualifies; if less than 95 percent, it fails; and if it is between 95 and 110 percent, the Secretary of State then orders a check of all the signatures. If required, the counties then have another 30 working days to do a full check.

The cut-off time to go through this entire process, have all the signatures verified and get on a particular ballot is 131 days before that election. An initiative that qualifies by this deadline is first classified by the Secretary of State as &quot;eligible&quot; for the upcoming statewide ballot; those that qualify after this deadline are &quot;eligible&quot; for the following statewide ballot. Proponents still have the option to withdraw an initiative that is &quot;eligible&quot; for the ballot. The Secretary of State only uses the &quot;qualified&quot; classification in this particular case to mean when the initiative is on the official list that will appear on the ballot, which is prepared and certified on that 131-day mark.

Ballots that record neither a &quot;yes&quot; nor a &quot;no&quot; on the proposition are ignored, and of the remaining votes, &quot;yes&quot; votes must exceed &quot;no&quot; votes for the proposition to pass. In other words, the majority of voters required for passage refers to a majority of those voting on that proposition, rather than a majority of those voting in the election held at the same time, or a majority of those who are registered to vote. If the proposition passes, it becomes a part of the state constitution (if it is a proposed amendment) or the state&#x27;s statutes (if it is a proposed statute), in the latter case having the same legal effect as if it had been passed by the state legislature and signed by the governor.

===Mandatory referendum===
Under California law, certain types of bills passed by the State Legislature and signed by the Governor must be submitted to the voters as a referendum at the next statewide election. Legislative bills that require mandatory referendums include state constitutional amendments, bond measures, and amendments to previously approved voter initiatives. More than 50 percent of the voters must then support these amendments or new laws on the ballot for them to go into effect.

===Optional referendum===
Laws already adopted by the state legislature may be vetoed by means of a referendum. This is also known as a &quot;petition referendum&quot; or &quot;people&#x27;s veto&quot;. The process is similar to an initiative as noted above, except that it is an already passed law submitted as a petition to the Attorney General. The proponent, however, only has 90 days after the law in question is enacted to submit the request to the Attorney General for a circulating title and summary, gather the signatures, and file the petitions with the county elections officials; otherwise, it must go through the initiative process, submitted as a proposed amendment.

Laws that are ineligible for optional referendums include urgency statutes, statutes calling elections, and statutes providing for tax levies or appropriations for usual, current state expenses.

To qualify on the ballot, a referendum petition must be signed by at least five percent of the number of voters in the previous gubernatorial election. The signature checking process by the counties is basically the same as the initiative process. The counties take a random sample of 3 percent or 500 of the signatures, whichever is greater. If the statewide random sample total projects more than 110 percent of the required number of signatures, the referendum automatically qualifies; if less than 95 percent, it fails; and if it is between 95 and 110 percent, a full check of all the signatures is performed.

Unlike initiatives which must qualify 131 days before the election to appear on the ballot, a referendum can qualify up to 31 days before. If the referendum receives more &quot;no&quot; votes than &quot;yes&quot; votes, the law is repealed.

As of 2020, only 94 optional referendums proposed since 1912 had received a circulating title and summary, and of those only 52 qualified for the ballot.

==Proposition numbering==
Originally, ballot propositions were given a number starting at one each election. This tended to be confusing as often famous initiatives such as Proposition 13 in 1978 might be confused with another initiative in a later year if there were more than twelve proposals on the ballot in any given year. Starting with the November 1982 ballot, the proposition numbers were not re-used but continued to increment every election, eventually resulting in proposition numbers exceeding 200 by the 1996 election. For the November 1998 ballot, the count was reset back to one. It is now reset every ten years.

==Conflicting propositions==
Under Article II, Section 10(b) of the California Constitution, &quot;If provisions of 2 or more measures approved at the same election conflict, those of the measure receiving the highest affirmative vote shall prevail.&quot; However, those provisions that do not conflict with the winning proposition may still go into effect. To get around this loophole, many initiatives include so-called &quot;poison pill&quot; clauses, specifying which provisions are voided in the other propositions.

The rule in the constitution was clarified in 1990 by the California Supreme Court in its ruling in &quot;Taxpayers to Limit Campaign Spending v. Fair Political Practices Commission&quot;:

When two or more measures are competing initiatives, either because they are expressly offered as &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; alternatives or because each creates a comprehensive regulatory scheme related to the same subject, section 10(b) mandates that only the provisions of the measure receiving the highest number of affirmative votes be enforced.

The Court was concerned that attempts to combine the non-conflicting provisions in such competing initiatives would result in regulatory schemes completely different from what the electorate understood or intended.

==Criticisms==
Criticism has been raised of the initiative process, suggesting that with trends toward lower voter turnouts, and evidence for voter disinterest in candidates and issues other than in presidential elections, that a &quot;direct democracy system specifically designed to be inflexible&quot; might be infeasible to continue as a way to make important California public policy decisions.

Issues have also been raised regarding the narrowing of democratic access imposed by the high cost of conducting initiatives and referendums, and by the challenges raised by attempting comprehensive governance in the face of individual, non-comprehensive (and sometimes at least partially contrary) initiatives. Generally, because of California&#x27;s size and population, proponents of a ballot initiative or referendum need significant amounts of money and resources to first gather the required number of petition signatures, and then campaign across the state for the effort&#x27;s passage. The wealthy and large special interest groups can afford to do so (or to sponsor the opposition campaigns), a process that can be cost-prohibitive to most other organizations and individual citizens.

With regard to the cumulative effect of stand-alone propositions passed by voters (see also the preceding section), complaint has been raised that they collectively limit the state legislature in dealing with issues comprehensively, e.g. in the overall shaping of public policy, or the overall management of the state budget. For example, legislators trying to pass a state budget must work around both Proposition 13&#x27;s inflexible limits on taxes and Proposition 98&#x27;s school-funding guarantee.

<doc id="885857" wikidata="Q358173" url="?curid=885857" title="Steingrímur Hermannsson">
<text>Steingrímur Hermannsson (pronounced ; 22 June 1928 – 1 February 2010) was an Icelandic politician who served as prime minister of Iceland from 1983 to 1987, and again from 1988 to 1991. He was the chairman for the Progressive Party from 1979 to 1994.

Steingrímur&#x27;s father, Hermann Jónasson also served as Iceland&#x27;s prime minister from 1934 to 1942 and again from 1956 to 1958. Steingrímur&#x27;s son, Guðmundur Steingrímsson ran as the chairman for his own party in the 2013 parliamentary election.

==Early childhood==

Steingrímur&#x27;s father was Hermann Jónasson, another former Prime Minister. Being the son of a prominent official, Steingrímur enjoyed a relatively care-free upbringing in a country stricken by the Great Depression. As a young boy he had an exceptional proximity to Iceland&#x27;s World War II politics, overhearing state affairs being discussed in his father&#x27;s living room.

==Education==

Not wanting to follow his father&#x27;s footsteps into politics, Steingrímur went to the U.S. in 1948. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from Illinois Institute of Technology in 1951 and a master&#x27;s degree from Caltech in 1952. After returning to his native country and experiencing troubles both in his private life and business career, he eventually entered politics in the 1960s. He was elected to the Althing (Icelandic Parliament) in 1971 for the Progressive Party, the party of his father. He became party chairman in 1979.

==Politics==

Steingrímur served as Prime Minister from 1983 to 1987 and again from 1988 to 1991. He also served for a time as Minister of Justice, Ecclesiastical Affairs and Agriculture (1978–79), Minister of Fisheries and Communications (1980–83) and Minister of Foreign Affairs (1987–88). He was chairman of the Progressive Party from 1979 to 1994. After that he was governor of the Central Bank of Iceland until his retirement in 1998.

===International affairs===

Internationally, his greatest moment as Prime Minister came in 1986, when he hosted the Reykjavík Summit of Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan. Although not considered a success at the time, the summit paved the way for the ending of the Cold War, and the Icelandic government&#x27;s management of the event was widely commended. In 1991, during the January Events in Lithuania, Steingrímur expressed strong support for Vytautas Landsbergis, Chairman of Lithuanian Parliament. Shortly after, Iceland was the first country to recognize the independence of Lithuania from Soviet Union.

Steingrímur first kept a low profile in his retirement, rarely voicing his opinion of current affairs. He was however a founding member of Heimssýn, an organization opposed to Iceland&#x27;s entry of the European Union, and became increasingly critical of the Progressive Party&#x27;s policies. He gave public support to &quot;The Iceland Movement&quot;, an &quot;ad hoc&quot; environmental movement which ran (unsuccessfully) in the 2007 Althing elections, appearing in campaign advertisements on TV. As a result of these activities, he mostly lost the informal status of the Progressive party&#x27;s &quot;Grand Old Man&quot;.

In his last years Steingrímur was a well liked and respected elder statesman, and was considered as a potential candidate for the 1996 presidential elections. But he quickly declined that honour, stating his intention to retire at the age of 70. His memoirs, published in three volumes in 1998–2000, became bestsellers.

By 2007, Steingrímur had left the Progressive Party, after it had turned more to the right and he appeared in TV-ads advertising the Icelandic Movement party.

During an eulogy made by former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney at George H. W. Bush&#x27; state funeral in 2018, Mulroney joked about Steingrímur&#x27;s often long speaches.

==Family==

Steingrímur was twice married and had six children. His youngest son, Guðmundur Steingrímsson was active in Icelandic politics between 2007 and 2016. He first ran for the Althing in the 2007 elections, for the Social Democratic Alliance. In early 2009, however, he switched sides and joined his grandfather&#x27;s and father&#x27;s Progressive Party and got elected. Then switched again and got elected in 2013 for his own party as a chairman, Bright Future, where he attempted to become a prime minister just like his father and grandfather.

His eldest children, John, Ellen, and Neil Hermannsson reside in the United States with their own children, all of whom have been to Iceland.

<text>A defter was a type of tax register and land cadastre in the Ottoman Empire.

==Etymology==
The term is derived from Greek , literally &#x27;processed animal skin, leather, fur&#x27;, meaning a book, having pages of goat parchment used along with papyrus as paper in Ancient Greece, borrowed into Arabic as &quot;:&quot; , meaning a register or a notebook.

==Description ==

The information collected could vary, but &quot;tahrir defterleri&quot; typically included details of villages, dwellings, household heads (adult males and widows), ethnicity/religion (because these could affect tax liabilities/exemptions), and land use. The defter-i hakâni was a land registry, also used for tax purposes. Each town had a defter and typically an officiator or someone in an administrative role to determine whether the information should be recorded. The officiator was usually some kind of learned man who had knowledge of state regulations. The defter was used to record family interactions such as marriage and inheritance. These records are useful for historians because such information allows for a more in-depth understanding of land ownership among Ottomans. This is particularly helpful when attempting to study the daily affairs of Ottoman citizens.

Some Ottoman officials responsible for these tax registries were known as &quot;defterdars&quot;.

== Daftars in India ==

Records of this kind are known as &quot;daftars&quot; in Northern India as well, for instance the &quot;Peshwa&#x27;s daftar&quot; of Pune.

<doc id="885860" wikidata="Q589905" url="?curid=885860" title="Red Adair">
<text>Paul Neal &quot;Red&quot; Adair (June 18, 1915 – August 7, 2004) was an American oil well firefighter. He became notable internationally as an innovator in the specialized and hazardous profession of extinguishing and capping oil well blowouts, both land-based and offshore.

==Early life and education==
Adair was born in Houston, Texas, the son of an Irish immigrant blacksmith and his wife. He attended Reagan High School.

==Military service and career==
During World War II, Adair served with the US Army, in a bomb disposal unit. After the war ended, he started working in the oil industry. He started his career working for Myron Kinley, the &quot;original&quot; blowout/oil firefighting pioneer. They pioneered the technique of using a V-shaped charge of high explosives to snuff the fire by the blast. This was known as the Munroe effect, which Adair knew was used with bazookas and the atom bomb.

In 1959 he founded Red Adair Co. Inc. During the course of his career, Adair helped extinguish more than 2,000 land and offshore oil well, natural gas well, and similar spectacular fires. He gained global attention in 1962 when he fought a fire at the Gassi Touil gas field in the Algerian Sahara nicknamed the Devil&#x27;s Cigarette Lighter, a pillar of flame that burned from 12:00 pm November 13, 1961, to 9:30 am on April 28, 1962. In December 1968, Adair sealed a large gas leak at an Australian gas and oil platform off Victoria&#x27;s southeast coast.
In 1977, he and his crew, including Asger &quot;Boots&quot; Hansen and Manohar &quot;Man&quot; Dhumtara-Kejriwal, contributed to capping the biggest oil well blowout to have occurred in the North Sea. At the time this was the largest offshore blowout worldwide, in terms of volume of crude oil spilled. This took place at the Ekofisk Bravo platform, located in the Norwegian sector and operated by Phillips Petroleum Company, now ConocoPhillips.

In 1978, Adair&#x27;s top lieutenants Hansen and Ed &quot;Coots&quot; Matthews left to found a competitor company, Boots &amp; Coots International Well Control Inc.

In 1988, Adair helped to extinguish the UK sector Piper Alpha oil platform fire in the North Sea. At age 75, Adair participated with extinguishing the oil well fires in Kuwait set by retreating Iraqi troops after the Gulf War in 1991.

Adair retired in 1993, and sold The Red Adair Service and Marine Company to Global Industries. His top employees (Brian Krause, Raymond Henry, Rich Hatteberg) left in 1994 and formed their own company, International Well Control (IWC).

Adair died in Houston in 2004 at the age of 89. He is buried in a crypt at Forest Park Lawndale in Houston.

==Family==

He was survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.

==Legacy==

*The 1968 John Wayne movie &quot;Hellfighters&quot; was based loosely upon the feats of Adair during the 1962 fire in the Sahara.
*Adair received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1980.
*The History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Modern Marvels&quot; episode on &quot;Oil Well Firefighting&quot; was one of Adair&#x27;s last interviews prior to his death. The episode was broadcast after Adair&#x27;s death and was dedicated to his memory.
*The Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;Mysteries at the Museum&quot; &quot;Most Explosive&quot; episode (2014) features a segment on Adair&#x27;s success in 1961 in stopping the burning gas line in the Algerian Sahara Desert; it was nicknamed &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Cigarette Lighter&quot;. 
*He was a longtime member of Lakewood Yacht Club.
*In Season 2, Episode 6 of MacGyver (2016 TV series), Red Adair’s life, particularly the “Devil&#x27;s Cigarette Lighter” incident, is shown to be an inspiration for character Jack Dalton and explains why he knows so much about oil well fires when the team is tasked with stopping one in Nigeria.

<doc id="885861" wikidata="Q320442" url="?curid=885861" title="Omar Cabezas">
<text>Omar Cabezas Lacayo (born 1950 in León, Nicaragua) is a Nicaraguan author, revolutionary and politician. He was a commander in the guerrilla war against Anastasio Somoza Debayle, and prominent Sandinista party member. He wrote a personal account of his days as a guerrilla fighting the Somoza dynasty entitled &quot;Fire From the Mountain&quot; (published in Nicaragua as &quot;La montaña es algo mas que una inmensa estepa verde&quot;).

This personal testimony can be read as a bildungsroman, or &quot;novela de formación&quot; in Spanish. In it, Cabezas learns about life, about social injustice, about women, and about the difficulty of overthrowing a dictatorship. He struggles against nature; an infection he suffers from being on the mountain puts his life in jeopardy. He overcomes numerous obstacles in his quest to bring down the brutal US-supported thirty year Somoza dynasty in an environment defined by terror and hope (such as the violent shootout between the military and the Sandinista militant Julio Buitrago). Cabezas&#x27; story is about an idealist man in a time when it meant something to be heroic. It is also known for being the first major work in the Nicaraguan vernacular, rather than formal Spanish.

Cabezas would later write a sequel, &quot;Canción de amor para los hombres&quot;.

Cabezas was a member of the Sandinista government, until he was stripped of his positions in 1987, following disagreement with other leading Sandinistas. He was elected to the National Assembly in the 1990 elections, and continues as a public figure to this day.

<doc id="885863" wikidata="Q7133913" url="?curid=885863" title="Parachute (Guster album)">
<text>Parachute is the first album by the band Guster, released in 1994. Four thousand copies were released under the band name Gus (the band had to change its name shortly afterward when another artist signed a record contract under that name). Those copies are considered very rare by Guster fans. 

Originally released in April 1994, the album was produced by Mike Denneen and was re-released in November 14, 1995. The stuffed animal on the cover of the album is a childhood toy of the percussionist Brian Rosenworcel and is lovingly referred to as &quot;The Big Friend&quot;. It has become a mascot of sorts for the band.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; named the album the best local debut of 1994.

<text>Streets of Fire is a 1984 American action crime neo-noir film directed by Walter Hill, from a screenplay by Hill and Larry Gross. Described on the poster and in the opening credits as &quot;A Rock &amp; Roll Fable&quot;, the film combines elements of the automobile culture and music from the 1950s with the fashion style and sociology of the 1980s. Starring Michael Paré, Diane Lane, Rick Moranis, Amy Madigan, Willem Dafoe, Deborah Van Valkenburgh, E.G. Daily, and Bill Paxton, the film follows ex-soldiers Tom Cody (Paré) and McCoy (Madigan) as they embark on a mission to rescue Cody&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Ellen Aim (Lane), who was kidnapped by Raven Shaddock (Dafoe), the leader of an outlaw motorcycle gang called The Bombers.

&quot;Streets of Fire&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on June 1, 1984, to mixed reviews from critics and was a box office failure, grossing $8 million against its $14.5 million budget.

==Plot==
In Richmond, a city district in a near future dystopian time period that resembles the 1950s (labelled &quot;another time, another place&quot;), Ellen Aim, lead singer of the rock band Ellen Aim and the Attackers, has returned home for a concert. The Bombers, a biker gang from another part of town called the Battery, led by Raven Shaddock, crash the concert and kidnap Ellen.

Witnessing this is Reva Cody, who telegrams her brother Tom, an ex-soldier and Ellen&#x27;s ex-boyfriend, asking him to come home. Upon his return, Tom defeats a small gang of greasers and takes their car. Reva tries to convince Tom to rescue Ellen, but he refuses. Tom then goes to a local tavern, the Blackhawk, where he meets a tomboyish mechanic and ex-soldier named McCoy and lets her stay with him and Reva. That night, Tom has a change of heart and agrees to talk to Ellen&#x27;s manager and current boyfriend, Billy Fish, about rescuing her.

While Reva and McCoy go to the diner where Reva works, Tom acquires a cache of weapons, including a pump action shotgun, a revolver, and a lever action rifle. Tom meets Billy at the diner, and Billy agrees to pay him $10,000, but Tom also requires that Billy accompany him into the Battery to get Ellen, since he used to live there. McCoy also talks Tom into cutting her in for 10% in exchange for her help.
In the Battery, they go to Torchie&#x27;s, a club where Billy used to book bands and where Raven has Ellen tied up in an upstairs bedroom. McCoy enters and is led upstairs by one of the Bombers, whom she knocks out before holding Raven and some of his gang members at gunpoint. Meanwhile, Tom creates a diversion outside by shooting the gas tanks on the gang&#x27;s motorcycles, and then rescues Ellen. Tom sends Ellen off with McCoy and Billy in the convertible, telling them to meet him at the Grant Street underpass and blows up the gas pumps outside a bar. Raven confronts Tom and warns him that he will be coming for Ellen and for him, too. Tom escapes on the one intact motorcycle and meets up with the others.

The group is joined by &quot;Baby Doll&quot;, a fan of Ellen&#x27;s, who warns them that the police are looking for the people who were behind the attack at Torchie’s. To escape, the group hijacks the tour bus of a doo-wop group called the Sorels. The bus is eventually stopped by a police blockade. Billy tries to get rid of the corrupt police officers by bribing them, but Tom and McCoy have to resort to holding the police at gunpoint and shooting up their vehicles. The group, along with the Sorels, ditch the bus and take a train back to Richmond.

Raven meets with Ed Price, the head of the police department, and promises him no more trouble if he arranges for Tom to meet with him alone. Price plans on arresting Raven, so he tells Tom to get out of town, so as to avoid any more violence. Tom goes to the hotel where Ellen and Billy are staying to collect his reward, but he takes only McCoy&#x27;s cut and throws the rest back at Billy. As Tom storms out, Ellen follows and the two embrace in the rain. After having sex, Tom and Ellen discuss the possibility of eloping.

Price, with reinforcements, is just about to arrest Raven, but is ambushed by an overwhelming number of Bombers. Meanwhile, Ellen is on a train with Tom and McCoy, believing that Tom is leaving with her, but Tom knocks out Ellen and returns to town to confront Raven. Tom and Raven duel using sledgehammers and their fists, with Tom ultimately being victorious. The defeated gang carries their leader away. Later, at a concert, the Sorels open for Ellen and her band. Tom bids farewell to Ellen, promising that he’ll always be there for her if she needs him. Ellen performs on stage, while Tom rides off with McCoy.

==Production==
===Development===
The concept for &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; came together during the making of &quot;48 Hrs.&quot;, and reunited director Walter Hill with 
screenwriter Larry Gross, and producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver, all of whom worked together on that production. Gross later recalled:

&quot;Streets of Fire&quot; began in the euphoria of knowing that Paramount really liked &quot;48&quot; and wanted to be in business with us if they could. What happened was that after we screened that cut for Paramount, Larry looked at Walter and said, &quot;Paramount is pregnant; let&#x27;s get something and set it up right away.&quot; Walter knew what he meant—that we were in a great position here—so he said, &quot;We can do this two ways: present an idea now and get a deal done, or write a script on spec and get a lot more money.&quot; Walter proudly considers himself a capitalist, so he suggested we do the latter.
According to Hill, the film&#x27;s origins came out of a desire to make what he thought was a perfect film when he was a teenager, and put in all of the things that he thought were &quot;great then and which I still have great affection for: custom cars, kissing in the rain, neon, trains in the night, high-speed pursuit, rumbles, rock stars, motorcycles, jokes in tough situations, leather jackets and questions of honor&quot;.

According to Gross, Hill wanted to make a film about a comic book hero, but since he did not like &quot;any of the comic books&quot; he had read, he wanted it to be an original character. &quot;He wanted to create his own &#x27;comic book movie&#x27;, without the source material actually being a comic book&quot;, said Gross, which led to the creation of Tom Cody.

===Writing===
The four men began planning &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; while completing &quot;48 Hrs&quot;. Gross published a diary from the shoot of &quot;48 Hours&quot; which had an entry dated 12 August 1982, the night before filming on that movie started:
Walter presents me with a page of notes he&#x27;s prepared for a new script. It will be the first in a series of adventures of an action hero he&#x27;s had it in his mind to create for a long time. The character&#x27;s name is Tom Cody. And Walter has it in his head to create a franchise about him...introducing him as The Stranger. He asks me if I&#x27;m interested in writing the script with him...I ask him is the Pope Catholic? Larry [Gordon] and Joel [Silver] would be along on this ride. Suits me.
During &quot;48 Hours&quot;, Gross said he thought that Hill had received &quot;a bum rap on the woman question&quot; over the years. &quot;People think that he doesn&#x27;t like women and he knows that&#x27;s not true. I think that&#x27;s going to be demonstrated even more clearly in his next films. He told me he&#x27;s going to do this new thing: he&#x27;s going to put a female character right in the centre of the narrative.&quot;

Gross later said they were affected &quot;as everyone was at the time&quot; by the success of &quot;Flashdance&quot; and they decided during writing that the film would be a musical:
We said this movie is a stylized movie, it&#x27;s not so different from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal&#x27;s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like &quot;New York City&quot;—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: &quot;in a galaxy long ago&quot;, a futuristic past. That was in our heads...there&#x27;s the past and there&#x27;s the future, sort of.
Hill thought &quot;the audience will go with you when you set up an abstract world with teenage values and play out a drama within this. It was kind of real but it wasn&#x27;t really. I always said whenever someone says fantasy they immediately think of more Disney-esque. The idea of a hard hitting drama in a fantasy world, that was kind of different at the time... I always thought of it as a musical. They kind of saw it worked in the world of an MTV video.&quot;

Gross says he and Hill were also influenced by the teen films of John Hughes. 
We were in the universe of the teenage movie. Teenage reality. So we said here&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to be weird about the world of our movie: No one&#x27;s going to be over 30. The world is a high school, essentially. And Tom Cody will be the football hero. And Willem Dafoe is the greaser. Remember: You had John Hughes at the time, and then you had Coppola making two high school movies: &quot;The Outsiders&quot; and &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;. So Walter said we’re going to make a high school movie that&#x27;s also going to be a comic book and also going to be a musical.
Gross says Hill did not want the film to be too violent. As a result, it was decided that no blood would be shown and none of the characters would die. &quot;He&#x27;d say it would be inappropriate to direct this movie if there were any blood&quot;, said Gross. &quot;We’re in the world of Cocteau, we’re in the world of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. This is a fairy tale. Now...he neglected to mention that some fairy tales are very violent.&quot;

Gross and Hill would work out their ideas in detail. Gross would do a draft and Hill would rewrite it. &quot;He did not love creating scripts from scratch; he loved rewriting.&quot; By this stage however, Gross and Hill had worked together so closely Gross says &quot;I began to develop a strong sense for knowing how to sound like he did.&quot;

===Financing===
When the script was finished, they sent it to Paramount. Gross says that Jeff Berg, Hill&#x27;s agent, Larry Gordon, and Michael Eisner, head of production at Paramount, &quot;got into some kind of a fight when the script was finished. We learned later that, I believe, Eisner rejected it on the grounds that it was too similar to Indiana Jones. Conceptually. So they didn&#x27;t pull the trigger and Berg ended up selling it to Universal.&quot;

They submitted the script to Universal executive Bob Rehme in January 1983, and by the end of the weekend, the studio had greenlit the production. This was the fastest greenlight Hill had ever received for a film, and he owed the decision to the box office success of &quot;48 Hours&quot;.

===The title===
The film&#x27;s title came from a song written and recorded by Bruce Springsteen on his 1978 album &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;. Negotiations with Springsteen for rights to the song delayed production several times. Originally, plans were made for the song to be featured on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, to be sung by Ellen Aim at the end of the film, but when Springsteen was told that the song would be re-recorded by other vocalists, he withdrew permission for the song to be used. Jim Steinman was brought in to write the opening and closing songs, and &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; was replaced by &quot;Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young&quot;. The studio claimed that they replaced Springsteen&#x27;s song because it was a &quot;downer&quot;.

===Casting===
When it came to casting the movie, Hill wanted to go with a young group of relative unknowns. Gross says &quot;There was always the idea that we were going to discover a new Steve McQueen, you know? A young, white guy who would ride a motorcycle and have a carbine over his shoulder and be a mainstream icon.&quot;

Among the actors they saw for the role of Tom Cody were Tom Cruise, Eric Roberts, and Patrick Swayze. Gross says they wanted Cruise and made him an offer, but he had already accepted another role.

Hill heard about Michael Paré from the same agent who recommended Eddie Murphy to him for &quot;48 Hrs&quot; (his then-girlfriend and later wife Hildy). At the time he was cast in March 1983, Paré had appeared in two films, &quot;Eddie and the Cruisers&quot; and &quot;Undercover&quot;, which had not yet been released. For Hill, Paré &quot;had the right quality. He was the only actor I found who was right for the part ...a striking combination of toughness and innocence.&quot; Paré said of his character, &quot;He&#x27;s someone who can come in and straighten everything out.&quot;

The character of Ellen Aim was written as a 28-year-old woman. Gross says they wanted Daryl Hannah, but were unable to do a deal in time. Diane Lane read for the part when she was 18. Hill was reluctant to cast her because he felt that she was too young for the role. Hill met Lane in New York City and she auditioned for him in black leather pants, a black mesh top and high-heeled boots. He was surprised with her &quot;total commitment to selling herself as a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll star&quot;. The actress had been in more than 10 films by the time she did &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;. She described her character as &quot;the first glamorous role I&#x27;ve had&quot;. Hill was so impressed with her work on the film that he wrote additional scenes for her during the shoot.

&quot;We were very excited about Diane Lane because she was starring in two excitedly hyped Francis Ford Coppola pictures that were being done in Oklahoma&quot;, says Gross. &quot;So we had the approval of sort of picking the person that Francis Ford Coppola picked.&quot;

Amy Madigan originally read for Reva, Cody&#x27;s sister, and told Hill and Silver that she wanted to play the role of McCoy which, she remembers, &quot;was written to be played by an overweight male who was a good soldier and really needed a job. It could still be tough and strong and have a woman do it without rewriting the part.&quot; Hill liked the idea and cast her.

Willem Dafoe was recommended by Kathryn Bigelow, who had recently directed him in &quot;The Loveless&quot; (1981). Bigelow was dating David Giler, a collaborator and friend of Hill at the time. Gross later said he thought Dafoe &quot;may have been the best thing about the film.&quot;

===Filming===
Production began on location in Chicago in April 1983, then moved to Los Angeles for 45 days, and finally two weeks at a soap factory in Wilmington, with additional filming taking place at Universal Studios. Shooting wrapped on August 18, 1983. All 10 days of filming in Chicago were exteriors at night, on locations that included platforms of elevated subway lines and the depths of Lower Wacker Drive. For Hill, the subways and their look was crucial to the world of the film and represented one of three modes of transportation—the other two being cars and motorcycles.

While shooting in Chicago, the production was plagued by inclement weather that included rain, hail, snow, and a combination of all three. The subway scenes were filmed on location in Chicago at many locations, including LaSalle Street (Blue line), Lake Street (Green line), Sheridan Road (Red, Purple lines), and Belmont Avenue (Red, Brown, and Purple lines). The Damen Avenue stop (Blue line, at Damen, North, and Milwaukee avenues) was used.

Production designer John Vallone and his team constructed an elevated train line on the backlot of Universal Studios that perfectly matched the ones in Chicago. The film crew tarped-in the New Street and Brownstone street sets to double for the Richmond District setting, completely covering them so that night scenes could be filmed during the day. This tarp measured 1,240 feet long by 220 feet wide over both sets, and cost $1.2 million to construct. However, this presented unusual problems. The sound of the tarp flapping in the wind interfered with the actors’ dialogue. Birds who had nested in the tarp provided their own noisy interruptions.

The exterior of the Richmond Theater where Ellen Aim sings at the beginning of the film was shot on the backlot, with the interior done in the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles for two weeks. The Ardmore Police roadblock was filmed near 6th street in East Los Angeles, near the flood basin. Although three districts are seen, the city has a total of five districts: the Richmond, the Strip, the Battery, the Cliffside, and the Bayside. An additional district, Ardmore, also appears in the film, but it may be a separate municipality as it is not prefaced with &quot;the&quot;.

The production employed 500 extras to play the citizens of the Richmond District. Cinematographer Andrew Laszlo shot the film with very low light, giving the images a stark, &quot;low-tech&quot; quality. The choreography for the two songs Ellen Aim sings and the one by the Sorels was done by Jeffrey Hornaday. The lighting for these concert scenes were done by Mark Brickman, who also lit concerts for Bruce Springsteen and Pink Floyd. In addition, 12 1950 and 1951 model Studebakers were used as police cars. More than 50 motorcycles and their drivers were featured as the Bombers, and were chosen from 200 members of real Los Angeles-based clubs like The Crusaders and The Heathens.

According to Laszlo, the film&#x27;s style was dictated by the story. The Richmond&#x27;s look was very soft and the colors did not call attention to themselves. The light in The Battery was contrasting and harsh, with vivid colors. Argyle prints and plaids are used in the Parkside District, and neon lights color the Strip.

Hill later said he felt &quot;humbled&quot; by the shoot:
I think I thought I could handle things. Didn&#x27;t know how to shoot music. Music had been important in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn&#x27;t seem to work it out without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don&#x27;t get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn&#x27;t have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don&#x27;t think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.
Due to the choreography and setups in between takes of every scene, the climactic four-minute showdown between Cody and Raven took a considerable time to shoot. Paré estimated it as four weeks:
Willem and I shot that for two weeks, and then Walter shot it for another two week with the stunt guys. That whole scene was a Walter thing. He had to do something like that, especially after what he had done in &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1975).

Michael Paré later recalled:

You gotta realize that, out of the whole cast, nobody was over thirty. Diane Lane was, I think, eighteen. It was an enormous Hollywood production. My manager had me hire a limousine to pick me up at home and take me to work. I was like, &quot;Jesus, this is incredible. This is... Hollywood. The real Hollywood. The Hollywood they make movies about.&quot; ... It was scary. And Walter isn&#x27;t the kind of guy who works well with kids. He&#x27;s a cowboy. He&#x27;s like John Ford. &quot;Don&#x27;t ask me how to act! I&#x27;m a director!&quot; (Laughs)

Paré also said he had troubles with Rick Moranis:

Rick Moranis drove me out of my mind. There&#x27;s this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can&#x27;t do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk around, and they can say whatever they want. I&#x27;m just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they...want, and you can&#x27;t do anything to stop them...He&#x27;s this weird looking little guy who couldn&#x27;t get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he says to me is &quot;Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?&quot; That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver&#x27;s office. And I was like, &quot;Oh...this is not going to go well.&quot; But he was one of Joel&#x27;s dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn&#x27;t that sharp. I wasn&#x27;t ready for that kind of crap.

Paré said that the original draft of the script had Tom Cody kill Raven with a knife. &quot;Walter really liked the idea because it had Tom Cody winning at all costs.&quot; However, this was changed to a fair fight to ensure a PG rating.

Paré did not always work well with Hill:

I think Walter is a writer at heart. Writers aren&#x27;t always that good at communicating in person. He&#x27;s also a tough son-of-a-bitch. He&#x27;s like a cowboy. His director&#x27;s chair was made out of leather and on the back of it read &quot;Lone Wolf&quot;. He used to frequent gun clubs and he wasn&#x27;t a very delicate guy...We were doing a love scene. When they said &quot;We need to loop the love scene.&quot; I really freaked out. I had never done a love scene before...I really needed help to get through it. I panicked, and Joel Silver, called Walter and somehow persuaded him to come over and direct me through the ADR. &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; was a big picture for me, and I was overwhelmed. I think that bothered Walter. I think he thought that I was a needy guy. He was used to working with actors who had experience like Nick Nolte or David Carradine. I&#x27;ve always wondered why Walter has never wanted to work with me again. I think he was too much of gentlemen to tell me that I was too needy at the time.

E. G. Daily, who played Baby Doll, says it was &quot;a very frustrating thing for me&quot; to not sing in the film &quot;Because Diane Lane was singing, and I remember thinking &#x27;Ah!&#x27; It was so frustrating for me. It was painful. Because I wanted to be on that stage singing with those guys...But back then I always played those quirky characters. I didn&#x27;t get those fancy leads. I got those best friend of the leads, quirky, funny characters. Hookers with a heart of gold. Weirdos.&quot;

Gross and Hill met with the editors on the weekends and looked at footage. Gross recalls that about five weeks into the 14-week shoot:

I turned to Walter and said &quot;This movie is somewhat weirder than we thought...We just didn&#x27;t anticipate what the combination of elements was going to be. We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn&#x27;t fully grasp how strong it would be, in terms of the combination of elements. In a way, I think &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; was about expanding &quot;The Warriors&quot; concept to a bigger stage. But when expanding it to a bigger scale, it changed. The movie&#x27;s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning of things and made it more of a fairy tale...&quot;The Warriors&quot;, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It&#x27;s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it&#x27;s very artificial at the same time... We did that again, but we put the emphasis on the artifice. And we didn&#x27;t fully...I want to say we had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than we should have. I don&#x27;t know. I can&#x27;t put everything together about what didn&#x27;t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn&#x27;t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we&#x27;d had Tom Cruise, we might have had a success. But our commitment to be stylized was thorough and conscious and maybe too extreme for the mainstream audience.

Gross also wrote that &quot;there was a chance of something great, but early fundamental disappointment with key personnel (in that case the star, Michael Paré) steeled all of us to face the chance that it might not turn out that way.&quot;

==Music==
The soundtrack album was released by MCA Records on May 29, 1984 and features the hit single &quot;I Can Dream About You&quot; by Dan Hartman.

==Release==
===Reaction===
Larry Gross recalls the filmmakers were optimistic prior to release:

We all knew in our hearts that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had compensated adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom&#x27;s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, there were a couple of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It&#x27;s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Streets of Fire&quot; fared poorly at the box office, opening in 1,150 theaters on June 1, 1984, and grossing $2.4 million during its first weekend. After 10 days, it made $4.5 million, while fellow opener &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; grossed $34.8 million in the same time.

Gross says Hill was making &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; at the time. &quot;Joel got off the phone with Universal and said, &#x27;We&#x27;re dead.&#x27; We sat down, I remember, in a little park. In downtown LA. And we started giggling, in that way people do when things are terrible...there&#x27;s the song in the movie called &#x27;Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young&#x27;. And I remember, in the park, Joel saying, &#x27;Today Is What It Means to be Dead&#x27;.&quot;

The film went on to make a total of $8 million in North America, compared to a production budget of $14.5 million.

&quot;I was shattered when the film didn&#x27;t perform&quot;, said Gross. &quot;That broke my heart...I hoped, by the time the movie finished, that it would be whipped into a shape and design that would have a real impact. And then it didn&#x27;t, and that was sad.&quot;

===Critical response===
 On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film holds a score of 59 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s screenplay as being misogynistic and &quot;problematically crude.&quot;

Gary Arnold wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that as &quot;romantic leads, Paré and Lane are pretty much a washout&quot;, and that &quot;most of the action climaxes are treated as such throwaways that you begin to wonder if they bored the director.&quot;

Jay Scott wrote in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that &quot;when &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; is speeding by like Mercury on methedrine, the rush left in its wake cancels out questions of content. But the minute the momentum slows, it&#x27;s another story—a story about a movie with no story at all.&quot;

In an essay for &quot;Film Comment&quot;, David Chute wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s probably impossible not to enjoy the movie. No director holds a candle to Hill for sheer visceral expertise. But the moods didn&#x27;t linger. It&#x27;s such a hard-shelled picture that it barely has moods.&quot;

Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; 3 stars out of a possible 4, praising the soundtrack and set design, and noting the &quot;broadly symbolic&quot; performances which embodied a struggled between good and evil. He also wrote: &quot;the language is strange, too: It&#x27;s tough, but not with 1984 toughness. It sounds like the way really mean guys would have talked in the late 1950s, only with a few words different—as if this world evolved a slightly different language.&quot;

===Legacy===
Screenwriter Larry Gross said the film has been influential:

Whatever is good, bad or indifferent about &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;, it had a huge impact on other filmmakers. The two movies that came out in the years after that are completely saturated in the iconography of &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; are &quot;RoboCop&quot; and &quot;Se7en&quot;. &quot;Se7en&quot;″s taking place in another world. It&#x27;s not New York. It&#x27;s not Chicago. A world where it&#x27;s raining all the time. Always dark. Always night, just about. Those are two very successful movies that figured out how to do the stylization with the appropriate amount of gore that they hooked the audience. And I think that if we&#x27;d done more gore, our chances of hooking the audience would be greater.

&quot;Streets of Fire&quot; has a number of similarities to Capcom&#x27;s hit 1989 beat &#x27;em up video game &quot;Final Fight&quot;. In a 2007 interview, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine asked the game&#x27;s designer Akira Nishitani about the similarities. Nishitani said that, at the time, the team were not &quot;aware of &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;, but I&#x27;ve Googled it and there does indeed seem to be something familiar about it&quot; but that &quot;this style of story was very popular back then&quot; and many &quot;fighting games made use of it&quot; so &quot;I guess we were part of that crowd!&quot; Conversely, Akira Yasuda (the game&#x27;s planner) states on his personal website that he based &quot;Final Fight&quot; protagonist Cody Travers on Michael Paré&#x27;s Tom Cody.

&quot;Streets of Fire&quot; also inspired early anime set in cyberpunk and other associated genres. The OVA miniseries &quot;Megazone 23&quot; and the original OVA version of &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; are both notable examples of this. At one point, the main character in the former even watches the movie in-universe, while the opening sequence to the latter&#x27;s first episode is heavily lifted from that of the film.

===Accolades===

==Possible sequels==
&quot;Streets of Fire&quot; was intended to be the first in a projected trilogy titled &quot;The Adventures of Tom Cody&quot;, with Hill&#x27;s tentatively titling the two sequels &quot;The Far City&quot; and &quot;Cody&#x27;s Return&quot;.

The &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; script concluded with the expectation that &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; will be followed by &quot;The Long Night, Book Two in The Adventures of Tom Cody&quot;.

Paré later recalled:

They told me that it was going to be a trilogy. What happened was that all of the people that made &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; left Universal Studios and went to 20th Century Fox. It was made at Universal, so they owned the rights to the story. So it was left behind. I was told by Joel Silver that the sequel was going to be set in the snow, and the following film would be set in the desert.

However, the film&#x27;s failure at the box office put an end to the project. In an interview, shortly after the film&#x27;s release, Paré said, &quot;Everyone liked it, and then all of a sudden they didn&#x27;t like it. I was already worried about whether I should do the sequel or not.&quot;

===&quot;Road to Hell&quot;===
An unofficial sequel titled &quot;Road to Hell&quot; was made in 2008, directed by Albert Pyun, and with Paré playing Tom Cody, and Deborah Van Valkenburgh playing his sister Reva Cody.

<text>Goldfly is the second studio album by the rock band Guster, released in 1997. The album was recorded in December 1996 at the House of Blues Studios in Encino, California. It sold around 20,000 copies as an independent release, before being picked up by Sire Records. The Sire version was remixed by Mike Shipley.

There are three versions of the album. The original, rare, independently released version has the hidden song &quot;Melanie&quot; before the first song. The version released on Hybrid/Sire Records has the hidden song as the eleventh track. The third version, distributed to members of Guster&#x27;s rep program, is a bad CD pressing of the album which contains &quot;Melanie&quot; as the first track, while &quot;Getting Even&quot; and &quot;Bury Me&quot; are combined as a single track.

<doc id="885886" wikidata="Q212726" url="?curid=885886" title="Mirizzi's syndrome">
<text>Mirizzi&#x27;s syndrome is a rare complication in which a gallstone becomes impacted in the cystic duct or neck of the gallbladder causing compression of the common hepatic duct, resulting in obstruction and jaundice. The obstructive jaundice can be caused by direct extrinsic compression by the stone or from fibrosis caused by chronic cholecystitis (inflammation). A cholecystocholedochal fistula can occur.

==Presentation==
Mirizzi&#x27;s syndrome has no consistent or unique clinical features that distinguish it from other more common forms of obstructive jaundice. Symptoms of recurrent cholangitis, jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, and elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase may or may not be present. Acute presentations of the syndrome include symptoms consistent with cholecystitis.

Surgery is extremely difficult as Calot&#x27;s triangle is often obliterated and the risks of causing injury to the CBD are high.

==Pathophysiology==
Multiple and large gallstones can become impacted in the Hartmann&#x27;s pouch of the gallbladder, leading to chronic inflammation—which leads to compression of the common bile duct (CBD), necrosis, fibrosis, and ultimately fistula formation into the adjacent common hepatic duct (CHD) or common bile duct (CBD). As a result, the CHD/CBD becomes obstructed by either scar or stone, resulting in obstructive jaundice. It can be divided into four types.

Type I – No fistula present

* Type IA – Presence of the cystic duct
* Type IB – Obliteration of the cystic duct

Types II–IV – Fistula present

* Type II – Defect smaller than 33% of the CHD diameter
* Type III – Defect 33–66% of the CHD diameter
* Type IV – Defect larger than 66% of the CHD diameter

==Diagnosis==
Imaging by ultrasonography, MRCP, or CT scan usually make the diagnosis. MRCP can be used to define the lesion anatomically prior to surgery.
Occasionally Mirizzi&#x27;s syndrome is diagnosed or confirmed on ERCP when requested to alleviate obstructive jaundice or cholangitis by means of an endoscopically placed stent, or when USS has been wrongly reported as choledocolithiasis.

==Treatment==
Simple cholecystectomy is suitable for type I patients. For types II–IV, subtotal cholecystectomy can be performed to avoid damage to the main bile ducts. Cholecystectomy and bilioenteric anastomosis may be required. Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy has shown good outcome in some studies.
==Epidemiology==
Mirizzi&#x27;s syndrome occurs in approximately 0.1% of patients with gallstones. It is found in 0.7 to 2.5 percent of cholecystectomies.

It affects males and females equally, but tends to affect older people more often. There is no evidence of race having any bearing on the epidemiology.

==Eponym==
It is named for Pablo Luis Mirizzi (1893–1964), an Argentinian physician. Mirizzi was educated and trained in his hometown and later visited some of the best hospitals throughout the United States for further education and training. Mirizzi specialized in abdominal and thoracic surgery and would write prolifically on related surgical topics.

He also made guest appearances in television series such as &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, and &quot;Bergerac&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Geoffrey Dyson Palmer was born on 4 June 1927 in North Finchley, Middlesex. He was the son of Frederick Charles Palmer, who was a chartered surveyor, and Norah Gwendolen (née Robins). He attended Highgate School from September 1939 to December 1945. He served as a corporal instructor in small arms and field training in the Royal Marines during his national service from 1946 to 1948, following which he briefly worked as an unpaid trainee assistant stage manager.

==Career==
Palmer&#x27;s early television appearances included multiple roles in episodes of &quot;The Army Game&quot; (Granada Television), two episodes of &quot;The Baron&quot; and as a property agent in &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; (1966). After a major break in John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;West of Suez&quot; at the Royal Court with Ralph Richardson, he acted in major productions at the Royal Court and for the National Theatre Company and was directed by Laurence Olivier in J. B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;Eden End&quot;. Palmer found the play so dull, however, that he was deterred from a stage career. 

Two BBC sitcom roles brought him attention in the 1970s: the hapless brother-in-law of Reggie Perrin in &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot; (1976–79), and the phlegmatic dentist Ben Parkinson in &quot;Butterflies&quot; (1978–1983).

In 1978, Palmer appeared as organized crimelord Simon Sinclair in London Weekend Television&#x27;s hard-hitting police drama &quot;The Professionals,&quot; the episode entitled &quot;Where the Jungle Ends.&quot;

Palmer played Doctor Price in the &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; episode &quot;The Kipper and the Corpse&quot; (1979), determined to have breakfast amidst the confusion caused by the death of a guest and Fawlty&#x27;s inept way of handling the emergency. In 1986, Palmer appeared as Donald Fairchild in the first series of an ITV sitcom, &quot;Executive Stress&quot;, alongside Penelope Keith. He later left, and was replaced by Peter Bowles.

Palmer later starred opposite Judi Dench for over a decade in another BBC sitcom, &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; (1992–2005). In 1997, he also appeared with Dench in the James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies,&quot; in which he portrayed Admiral Roebuck to Dench&#x27;s M, and &quot;Mrs Brown&quot;, playing Sir Henry Ponsonby to Dench&#x27;s Queen Victoria.

Palmer&#x27;s voice-over skills led to frequent work in commercials. Campaigns he was involved with include the &#x27;Slam in the Lamb&#x27; ads for the Meat &amp; Livestock Commission and the Audi commercials in which he was heard using the phrase &quot;Vorsprung durch Technik&quot;. As a narrator, he worked on the BBC series&#x27; &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; and &quot;Grumpy Old Holidays&quot;, as well as narrating the audiobook version of Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, released in 2005 as a podcast by Penguin Books. He narrated the documentary series &quot;Little England&quot;, and he continued to appear in productions written by &quot;Reggie Perrin&quot; creator David Nobbs, the last of these being the radio comedy &quot;The Maltby Collection&quot; broadcast from 2007.

In the 2006 DVD series &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;, Palmer partnered Rae Borras in a series of episodes based on Izaak Walton&#x27;s 1653 &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;. In 2007, he recorded &quot;The Diary of a Nobody&quot; by George Grossmith and Weedon Grossmith as an online audiobook. In December 2007, Palmer appeared in the role of the Captain in &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot;, the Christmas special episode of the BBC science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;; Palmer previously appeared in the classic era of the show in the Third Doctor serials &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot; (1970) (as Masters) and &quot;The Mutants&quot; (1972) (as the Administrator). In March 2009, he joined in a sketch with the two double acts Armstrong and Miller and Mitchell and Webb for Comic Relief. In 2011, he played the reactionary father-in-law of the eponymous clergyman of &quot;Rev.&quot; in its Christmas episode.

==Personal life and death==
Palmer married Sally Green in 1963. They had a daughter, Harriet, and a son, Charles, a television director. Palmer was a longtime resident of Lee Common in the Chiltern Hills, Buckinghamshire, and enjoyed fly fishing in his spare time. At the time of his death, he resided in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire.

Palmer died peacefully at his home on 5 November 2020, aged 93.

==Awards and recognition==
In the New Year&#x27;s Honours List published 31 December 2004 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to drama. A drawing of Palmer by Stuart Pearson Wright is in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London.

<text>Lost and Gone Forever is the third studio album by the band Guster, released in September 1999. It was recorded earlier that year in Sausalito, California, and Bearsville, New York. In 1999, Ryan Miller claimed that Guster took the album&#x27;s title &quot;from the popular folk song &#x27;Oh My Darling, Clementine and &quot;chose it because we felt it reflected the lyrical content of the record.&quot; According to Guster&#x27;s own website, other titles considered for the album included (jokingly) &quot;The Ides of Guster&quot;, &quot;When Guster Attacks&quot;, &quot;Senior Week&quot; and &quot;Book on Tape&quot;. All of the drums on this album were played by hand (no sticks).

In February 2012, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine named &quot;Lost and Gone Forever&quot; the 79th greatest album of the 1990s.

<text>Sobibór () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Włodawa, within Włodawa County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland. It lies close to the Bug River, which forms the border with Belarus and Ukraine.

==Overview==

Sobibór is approximately south-east of Włodawa and east of the regional capital Lublin. To the south and west is the protected area called Sobibór Landscape Park.

During World War II, the Nazi Sobibor extermination camp was built outside the village. The number of Jews gassed and cremated there between April 1942 and October 14, 1943 is estimated at 250,000. At present, the site of Jewish martyrology is the location of the Sobibór Museum branch of the Majdanek State Museum, devoted to the memory of atrocities committed by Nazi Germany at the Sobibór death camp during the Holocaust in Poland.

<text>Roanne (; ; ) is a commune in the Loire department, central France.

It is located northwest of Lyon on the river Loire. It has an important Museum, the &quot;Musée des Beaux-arts et d&#x27;Archéologie Joseph-Déchelette&quot; (French), with many Egyptian artifacts.

==Economy==
Roanne is known for gastronomy (largely because of the famous Troisgros family), textiles, agriculture and manufacturing tanks.

Roanne station has rail connections to Clermont-Ferrand, Saint-Étienne, Moulins and Lyon.

The Roanne region produces, particularly, fresh red wines designated as of the &quot;Cote Roannaise.&quot;

==History==

The toponymy is Gaulish, &quot;Rod-Onna&quot; (&quot;flowing water&quot;) which became &quot;Rodumna&quot;, then &quot;Rouhanne&quot; and &quot;Roanne&quot;. The town was sited at a strategic point, the head of navigation on the Loire, below its narrow gorges. As a trans-shipping point, its importance declined with the collapse of long-distance trade after the fourth century. In the twelfth century, the site passed to the comte du Forez, under whose care it began to recover. An overland route led to Lyon and the Rhône, thus Roanne developed as a transshipping point between Paris and the Mediterranean in early modern France, when waterways were at least as important as roads.

The renewed navigation on the Loire encouraged the export of local products: wines, including casks of Beaujolais that had been shipped overland, ceramics, textiles, and after 1785, coal from Saint-Étienne, which had formerly been onloaded upstream at Saint-Rambert, since river improvements at the beginning of the century. Sturdy goods were rafted downriver on &quot;sapinières&quot; that were dismantled after use. Half the population of seventeenth and eighteenth-century Roanne depended in some way on this transportation economy: merchants and factors, carriers, carpenters and coopers, master-boatmen and their journeymen and oarsmen, and waterfront laborers (Braudel p360f).

Roanne was one of the first towns served by railroad, with the opening, 15 March 1833, of the terminal on the right bank at the port of Varennes of the third line, from Andrézieux. Following came the opening of the canal from Roanne to Digoin (1838), which placed the city in the forefront of the French Industrial Revolution.

In 1917 the arsenal was established at Roanne, and from 1940 a new industry developed, producing rayon and other new fibers. In the post-industrial phase that set in during the 1970s, Roanne struggled to find new industry and attract tourism.

The 18th-century actor, playwright and revolutionary Antoine Dorfeuille (1754–1795) was murdered in Roanne.

==Population==

==Sports==
The city is home to Chorale Roanne Basket, two-time champion of France&#x27;s top basketball league LNB Pro A. The team plays its home games at the Halle André Vacheresse.

<doc id="885911" wikidata="Q6382996" url="?curid=885911" title="Keep It Together (album)">
<text>Keep It Together is the fourth studio album by the band Guster, released in June 2003. The album was recorded from 2001 to 2003 in Bearsville, New York, New York City, Burbank, California, and Shokan, New York. This is the first album by Guster with Brian Rosenworcel on kit drums instead of hand percussion. &quot;Keep It Together&quot; went through several working titles, including &quot;Bitch Magic&quot;, &quot;Olympia Dukakis&quot; and &quot;Come Downstairs &amp; Say Hello&quot;.

According to the album&#x27;s liner notes, Joe Pisapia contributed guest vocals on &quot;Jesus on the Radio&quot; and Ben Kweller did the same on &quot;I Hope Tomorrow Is Like Today&quot;. Pisapia officially joined the band in 2003.

The track &quot;Red Oyster Cult&quot; refers to the name of the American rock band Blue Öyster Cult.

A UK re-release included two bonus tracks, &quot;Say That to My Face&quot; and &quot;Starless Heaven&quot;. 

The record sold 267,000 copies by late 2005, according to Nielsen Soundscan.

==Track listing==
All music composed by Guster, except where noted.

When the band plays &quot;Jesus on the Radio&quot; live, they often play it &quot;unplugged&quot;, without any instruments or microphones plugged in.

&quot;Keep It Together&quot; can be heard at the end of the season 1 &quot;The O.C.&quot; episode, &quot;The Rescue&quot;.

&quot;I Hope Tomorrow Is Like Today&quot; can be heard in the film &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; and in the &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; episode &quot;Lois&#x27; Sister&quot;.

== The Meowstro Sings — Guster&#x27;s Keep It Together ==

The Meowstro Sings — Guster&#x27;s Keep It Together features all but one of the tracks from &quot;Keep It Together&quot;, with the vocals replaced by simulated cat meows. According to the band, the meows were sung by Guster&#x27;s monitor engineer at the time, Matt Peskie. The tracks were then released online, in an effort to deter downloading of legitimate tracks. The &quot;meow mixes&quot; gained a following from some fans, and were made available to &quot;Keep It Together&quot; purchasers through a link hidden on that album.

The Meowstro is featured in &quot;Melanie&quot;, which appeared on the 2004 Guster album &quot;Live 6/17/04 Myrtle Beach, SC&quot;. The studio version of &quot;Melanie&quot; appears on &quot;Goldfly&quot; also includes some meowing, but not by the Meowstro. Guster released the single &quot;Carol of the Meows&quot; for the 2004 holiday season, a recording of the traditional &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot; given the same treatment.

<text>The 2004 Democratic National Convention featured a variety of speakers, ranging from former presidents to rising newcomers.

==Monday, July 26th==

===Quotes===
* &quot;Democrats and Republicans have very different and honestly held ideas on that choices we should make, rooted in fundamentally different views of how we should meet our common challenges at home and how we should play our role in the world. Democrats want to build an America of shared responsibilities and shared opportunities and more global cooperation, acting alone only when we must. We think the role of government is to give people the tools and conditions to make the most of their lives. Republicans believe in an America run by the right people, their people, in a world in which we act unilaterally when we can, and cooperate when we have to. They think the role of government is to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of those who embrace their political, economic, and social views, leaving ordinary citizens to fend for themselves on matters like health care and retirement security. Since most Americans are not that far to the right, they have to portray us Democrats as unacceptable, lacking in strength and values. In other words, they need a divided America—but we don&#x27;t.&quot; —Bill Clinton
* &quot;Strength and wisdom are not opposing values.&quot;—Bill Clinton
* &quot;And so I say to you and to others around the world, whether they wish us well or ill — do not underestimate us Americans. We lack neither strength nor wisdom.&quot; —Jimmy Carter
* &quot;I&#x27;ll be candid with you. I had hoped to be back here this week under different circumstances, running for reelection. But you know the old saying — you win some, you lose some. And then there&#x27;s that little-known third category.&quot; —Al Gore
* &quot;Take it from me — every vote counts. In our Democracy, every vote has power. And never forget — that power is yours. Don&#x27;t let anyone take it away or talk you into throwing it away. And let&#x27;s make sure that this time every vote is counted.&quot; —Al Gore

===Quotes===
* &quot;I’ve seen their desire to take our country back for the American people. I saw it in a college student in Pennsylvania who sold her bicycle and sent us a check for one hundred dollars with a note that said, &quot;I sold my bicycle for democracy.&quot; I saw it in a woman from Iowa who handed me fifty dollars — all in quarters. She saved it from her monthly disability check, because she wanted to make America well again. And I saw it in the 19-year-old from Alabama who had never been involved in politics before he got in his car and drove up to Vermont, because he didn&#x27;t feel like he was being heard in Washington. He was just one of so many. They learned that politics was too important to be left to the politicians. They didn&#x27;t just pack their bags—they backed their hopes that we can take our country back. And you know what? We will.&quot; —Howard Dean
* &quot;Words can be cheap in a political year, we all know that. But I&#x27;m going to borrow some familiar ones, to tell you that we need John Kerry as president — because we need a uniter, not a divider, in the White House. We need John Kerry as president because it&#x27;s time to restore honor and dignity to the White House — to have a president whose whole life is a testament to his goodness and decency, to his courage under fire. We need John Kerry as president of the United States of America, because he will fight for working families, and help America to be what it ought to be.&quot; —Richard Gephardt
* &quot;Today, more than two centuries after the embattled farmers stood and fired the shot heard &quot;round the world&quot;, the ideals of our founders still resonate across the globe. Young people in other lands — inspired by the liberty we cherish — linked arms and sang &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; when the Berlin Wall fell, when apartheid ended in South Africa, and when the courageous protests took place in Tiananmen Square. The goals of the American people are every bit as high as they were more than two hundred years ago. If America is failing to reach them today, it&#x27;s not because our ideals need replacing, it&#x27;s because our President needs replacing.&quot; —Edward M. Kennedy
* &quot;I learned something then, and I believe it still. There is a value in taking a stand whether or not anyone may be noticing and whether or not it is a risky thing to do. And if even those who are in danger can raise their lonely voices, isn&#x27;t more required of all of us, in this land where liberty had her birth? In America, the true patriots are those who dare speak truth to power.&quot; —Teresa Heinz Kerry
* &quot;I was elected mayor at age 31 because I dared mighty things for the citizens of my city.&quot; —Kwame Kilpatrick
* A twelve-year-old founder of Kidsforkerry. Org addressed the delegates. She scolded Dick Cheney for his use of an expletive in a public remark to U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy. &quot;When our vice president had a disagreement with a Democratic senator, he used a really bad word. If I said that word, I would be put in a timeout. I think he should be put in a timeout.&quot; —Ilana Wexler

===Quotes===

* &quot;My fellow Americans, I don&#x27;t need to tell you that the world is a dangerous place. We are reminded of that in our everyday lives — and we have seen it on the streets and in the subways and airports outside this convention. Al Qaeda is the heir to enemies we have defeated before — today&#x27;s equivalent of Nazis and fascists who hate the values at the core of the American way of life: democracy and pluralism, diversity and tolerance, innovation and achievement, strength and freedom. And the fate of Al Qaeda will be the same as those other tyrants and thugs—we will defeat them.&quot; —Bill Richardson
* &quot;This is not about a party. It is about living up to the promise of America. The promise of America says that we will guarantee quality education for all children, and not spend more for metal detectors than computers in our schools. The promise of America guarantees health care for all of its citizens, and does not force seniors to travel to Canada to buy prescription drugs they cannot afford here. The promise of America provides that those who work in our health care system can afford to be hospitalized in the very beds that they clean everyday. The promise of America is government that does not seek to regulate your behavior in the bedroom but to guarantee your right to provide food in the kitchen. The promise of America is that we stand for human rights – whether it&#x27;s fighting slavery in Sudan, AIDS in Lesotho, or police brutality in this country. The promise of America is one immigration policy for all who seek to enter our shores, whether they come from Mexico, Haiti, or Canada. The promise of America is that every citizen&#x27;s vote is counted and protected, and election schemes do not decide elections.&quot; —Al Sharpton
* &quot;As I ran for president, I hoped that one child would come out of the ghetto like I did, could look at me walk across the stage with governors and senators and know they didn&#x27;t have to be a drug dealer, they didn&#x27;t have to be a hoodlum, they didn&#x27;t have to be a gangster. They could stand up from a broken home, on welfare, and they could run for president of the United States.&quot; —Al Sharpton
* &quot;There is not a liberal America, and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. There is not a black America, and a white America, a Latino America, an Asian America. There is the United States of America.&quot; —Barack Obama

===Quotes===
* &quot;During the course of this campaign, I&#x27;ve heard people talk about John Kerry the father and John Kerry the public servant as if they were two people divided. But, I can assure you all they are truly one and the same. I know his values-revealed in quiet 11 p.m. phone calls of frustration from what he&#x27;s seen at work, or the simple reminder that we never turn our backs on those in need. What drives my father to serve is exactly what has made this public servant the father I&#x27;m proud of, look up to, and love.&quot; —Vanessa Kerry
* &quot;To every little girl her father is a hero. It&#x27;s taken some getting used to, that my father actually is one. And not just in the obvious ways. Because he likes to listen as much as he likes to talk; because he&#x27;s studious in the way someone is when everything in the whole world interests them; because he leads by example; because he trusts people with the truth and doesn&#x27;t pander or play to our baser instincts.&quot; —Alexandra Kerry

<doc id="885919" wikidata="Q953855" url="?curid=885919" title="Def Jam Vendetta">
<text>Def Jam Vendetta is a 3D professional wrestling fighting video game developed by AKI Corporation and EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts under the EA Sports BIG label. It was released for the GameCube and PlayStation 2 in April 2003. The game is the first main installment in EA&#x27;s &quot;Def Jam&quot;-licensed hip-hop video game series. It was the publisher&#x27;s first attempt at a wrestling video game since &quot;WCW Backstage Assault&quot;. Several Def Jam hip-hop artists were featured in &quot;Def Jam Vendetta&quot;, including DMX, Method Man, Redman, Ludacris, N.O.R.E., Capone, Scarface, Ghostface Killah, Keith Murray, WC, Joe Budden and DJ Funkmaster Flex. Christina Milian was featured in the game as &quot;Angel&quot;. &quot;Def Jam Vendetta&quot; was followed up by a direct sequel in 2004, titled &quot;Def Jam: Fight for NY&quot;.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Def Jam Vendetta&quot; features a largely unmodified AKI engine, used in the company&#x27;s &quot;Virtual Pro Wrestling&quot; games and its spinoffs with some minor &quot;button mashing&quot; elements added and more of an arcade than a simulation. The game plays very similarly to &quot;WWF No Mercy&quot;, and features a lengthy story mode that allows you to level up and enhance one of four player characters in your quest to become the most well known star in the urban fighting league and fight the undefeated underground boss, D-Mob (voiced by actor Christopher Judge).

Players can win in one of three ways; pin, submission or KO. Pins are done by pinning the opponent for 3 seconds before he can kick out. The player can trap opponents in holds that gradually weaken one of their body parts (head, body, legs and arms). This hold can be broken by touching the ropes. If one of those gauges reaches empty, the bones get broken and that player submits &amp; automatically loses. Players can attack their opponent to build up a power gauge, letting them activate &#x27;Blazin&#x27; mode. If the player successfully grabs an opponent in this state, he can perform a special move. If the opponent&#x27;s health is low enough, they will be KO&#x27;d.

===Characters===
&quot;Def Jam Vendetta&quot; features 46 playable characters, including real-life hip hop artists signed to Def Jam at the time, as well as original characters. Christina Milian appears as Angel Rodriguez, a non-playable character. Japanese rappers Dabo and S-Word appear exclusively in the game&#x27;s Japanese release.
==Plot==
The player (or the Protagonist) can choose to play as one of four street fighters: Briggs, a dishonorably discharged soldier; Proof, an ex-superbike racer; Tank, a massive Japanese fighter, and the DJ Spider, although the story is the same for each of them.

Upon selecting their street fighter, the Protagonist is called to help out their friend Manny by taking his place in a street fight. Once the Protagonist wins a certain number of fights, they fight the rapper Scarface. Once the Protagonist defeats him, they get their first girlfriend, Deja. Other girls come up to the Protagonist every couple of street fights, and eventually the Protagonist chooses one to be their new girlfriend, resulting in them fighting each other.

N.O.R.E. challenges the Protagonist to a fight at &quot;Grimeyville&quot; in LeFrak City, Queens, New York City. The Protagonist arrives and nearly gets into a fight with D-Mob (Chris Judge). Not long after the fight, Manny signs himself and the Protagonist up for a tag team tournament. After a while, the Protagonist is challenged by Ludacris to a fight in Club Luda. Afterwards, D-Mob claims the Protagonist and Manny are nothing, adding that if anyone in the club wants power and respect, they must beat him at the Def Jam tournament. Manny tells the Protagonist to stop fighting, but is ignored.

DMX challenges the Protagonist, but must first overcome The Dragon House&#x27;s offer. They then fight Method Man and Redman in the tag team tournament finale. Afterwards, the Protagonist fights DMX, and upon winning, receives an email from his girlfriend Angel who was taken by D-Mob, saying they need to talk. When they arrive at The Face Club, it is revealed that D-Mob sent House, Pockets and Snowman to stop them from coming to the Def Jam tournament. The Protagonist defeats them, but Manny knocks him out and joins D-Mob against his will. Waking up, the Protagonist enters the tournament and defeats their best fighters. D-Mob attempts to shoot the Protagonist but Manny takes the bullet and survives. The Protagonist triumphs over D-Mob and gets Angel back. As the Protagonist walks out and makes amends with Manny, D-Mob is arrested, leading directly into &quot;Def Jam: Fight for NY&quot;.

==Reception==

By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Def Jam Vendetta&quot; had sold 750,000 copies and earned $30 million in the United States. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 82nd highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of the &quot;Def Jam&quot; series reached 1.8 million units in the United States by July 2006.

&quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; gave it a score of all four stars and stated: &quot;Electronic Arts deserves kudos for breathing new life into the aging fighting genre with this title&#x27;s fresh approach&quot;. However, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave it a score of six out of ten and said: &quot;If only DMX could sic his pit bulls on you, Funkmaster Flex burst your eardrums ID&#x27;ing himself, or Redman burn you with a blunt&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a C+ and called it &quot;an uninspired wrestling title that lacks Def Jam&#x27;s trademark sheen&quot;.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Def Jam Vendetta&quot; the best PlayStation 2 game of April 2003.

During the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Def Jam Vendetta&quot; for &quot;Console Fighting Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance - Female&quot; for Christina Milian&#x27;s vocal role as Angel, and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance - Male&quot; for Method Man&#x27;s vocal portrayal of himself.

<doc id="885922" wikidata="Q3511351" url="?curid=885922" title="Philip Effiong">
<text>Philip Efiong (also spelled Effiong, 18 November 1925 – 6 November 2003) was a Nigerian military officer who was the 1st Vice President and the 2nd and last president of the Republic of Biafra during the Nigerian Civil War from 1967 to 1970.

==Early life==
Born in Ibiono Ibom in present-day Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria, on 18 November 1925, Philip Effiong joined the Nigerian Armed Forces on 28 July 1945. The UK later commissioned him for duty in the Rhine, West Germany. He was then transferred to the Nigeria Army Ordnance Corps; then to England for further training after a peace-keeping stint in the Republic of Congo in 1961. He was Nigeria&#x27;s first Director of Ordnance. 

==Biafra==
Efiong became Chief of General Staff of Biafra under Head of State, Odumegwu Ojukwu during the Nigeria-Biafra war.

The tactics of the Nigerian military during the war included economic blockade and deliberate destruction of agricultural land. Even before the war, the area was a net importer of food, depending on income from its oil fields to feed its populace.

With the blockade cutting off oil revenue and agricultural destruction reducing food production, the result was mass dislocation and starvation of the populace. Two to three million people are thought to have died in the conflict, mostly through starvation and illness.

When Biafra&#x27;s military resistance collapsed, Ojukwu fled to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

==Effiong became acting Biafra Head of State==

Efiong assumed leadership in this situation of turmoil, starvation, and collapse. He became acting Head of State of Biafra on 8 January 1970 and on 12 January announced surrender.

==Effiong&#x27;s Speech to Gowon==

On 15 January 1970 at Dodan Barracks in Lagos, in the presence of General Yakubu Gowon, Effiong announced the end of the Biafran conflict.

&quot;I, Major-General Phillip Efiong, Officer Administering the Government of the Republic of Biafra, now wish to make the following declaration:
That we affirm that we are loyal Nigerian citizens and accept the authority of the Federal Military Government of Nigeria.
That we accept the existing administrative and political structure of the Federation of Nigeria.
That any future constitutional arrangement will be worked out by representatives of the people of Nigeria.
That the Republic of Biafra hereby ceases to exist.&quot;

At the time of the surrender, Effiong believed that the situation was hopeless and that prolonging the conflict would have led only to the further destruction and starvation of the people of Biafra. At that time Effiong said, &quot;I am convinced now that a stop must be put to the bloodshed which is going on as a result of the war. I am also convinced that the suffering of our people must be brought to an immediate end.&quot;

Nnaemeka L. Aneke wrote, &quot;General Efiong’s handling of Biafra’s surrender is one of the most tactical and devoted maneuvers ever seen on the Nigerian scene. Those who do not appreciate the depth of it may not have appreciated what was at stake as Biafra capitulated.&quot; Many observers had expected wholesale retribution at war&#x27;s end.

==Later life==
In a 1996 interview, Effiong reflected on those events:

:I have no regrets whatsoever of my involvement in Biafra or the role I played. The war deprived me of my property, dignity, my name. Yet, I saved so many souls on both sides and by this, I mean Biafra and Nigeria. . . .

:I felt that I played a role which has kept this country united till today. . . .

:At the end of it all when I saw they (Biafran soldiers) could no longer continue and Ojukwu had fled, I did what was ideal after wide consultation . . . 

Efiong died 6 November 2003, at the age of 77.

<text>The 1966 Lunar Orbiter 2 robotic spacecraft mission, part of the Lunar Orbiter Program, was designed primarily to photograph smooth areas of the lunar surface for selection and verification of safe landing sites for the Surveyor and Apollo missions. It was also equipped to collect selenodetic, radiation intensity, and micrometeoroid impact data.

==Mission summary==
The spacecraft was placed in a cislunar trajectory and injected into an elliptical near-equatorial lunar orbit for data acquisition after 92.6 hours&#x27; flight time. The initial orbit was at an inclination of 11.8 degrees. The perilune was lowered to five days later after 33 orbits. A failure of the amplifier on the final day of readout, December 7, resulted in the loss of six photographs. On December 8, 1966 the inclination was altered to 17.5 degrees to provide new data on lunar gravity.

The spacecraft acquired photographic data from November 18 to 25, 1966, and readout occurred through December 7, 1966. A total of 609 high-resolution and 208 medium-resolution frames were returned, most of excellent quality with resolutions down to . These included a spectacular oblique picture of Copernicus crater, which was dubbed by the news media as one of the great pictures of the century. The photo was taken on the 23rd November at an altitude of 45km. Accurate data were acquired from all other experiments throughout the mission. Three micrometeorite impacts were recorded. The spacecraft was used for tracking purposes until it impacted upon the lunar surface on command at 3.0 degrees N latitude, 119.1 degrees E longitude (selenographic coordinates) on October 11, 1967.

In 2011, NASA&#x27;s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) was able to locate and image the precise impact point of the spacecraft. The debris from an impact angle of 45 degrees or more spreads out like butterfly wings.

<doc id="885929" wikidata="Q1070563" url="?curid=885929" title="Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel">
<text>The Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel (CBBT, officially the Lucius J. Kellam Jr. Bridge–Tunnel) is a bridge–tunnel that crosses the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay between Delmarva and Hampton Roads in the U.S. commonwealth of Virginia. It opened in 1964, replacing ferries that had operated since the 1930s. A major project to dualize its bridges was completed in 1999, and in 2017 a similar project was started to dualize one of its tunnels.

With of bridges and two tunnels, the CBBT is one of only 14 bridge–tunnel systems in the world and one of three in Hampton Roads. It carries US 13, which saves motorists roughly and hours on trips between Hampton Roads and the Delaware Valley and points north compared with other routes through the Washington–Baltimore Metropolitan Area. , over 140 million vehicles have crossed the CBBT.

The CBBT was built and is operated by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel District, a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia governed by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel Commission in cooperation with the Virginia Department of Transportation. Its construction was financed by toll revenue bonds, while operating and maintenance expenses are recovered through tolls. In 2002, a Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) study commissioned by the Virginia General Assembly concluded that &quot;given the inability of the state to fund future capital requirements of the CBBT, the District and Commission should be retained to operate and maintain the Bridge–Tunnel as a toll facility in perpetuity&quot;.

The tunnel sections addressed concerns that a bridge failure across critical shipping lanes would block not only shipping but navy access.

A similarly named Chesapeake Bay Bridge crosses the Chesapeake Bay farther north in Maryland connecting Annapolis and Kent Island.

==History==

===Geographic background===
In December 1606, the Virginia Company of London sent an expedition to North America to establish a settlement in the Colony of Virginia. After sailing across the Atlantic Ocean from England, they reached the New World at the southern edge of the mouth of what is now known as the Chesapeake Bay. They named the two flanking Virginia points of land /capes like gateposts at the entrance to the long extensive estuary after the sons of their king, James I, the southern Cape Henry, for the eldest and presumed heir, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, and the northern Cape Charles, for his younger brother, Charles, Duke of York (the future King Charles I). A few weeks later they established their first permanent settlement on the southern, mainland, side of the bay, several miles upstream along the newly named James River at Jamestown on the northern shore on a close-in island for protection, the first permanent settlement in English North America.

Across the bay, the area north of Cape Charles was located along what became known later as the Delmarva Peninsula. As it bordered the Atlantic Ocean to its east, the region became known as Virginia and neighboring Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore. As the entire colony grew, the bay was a formidable transportation obstacle for exchanges with the Virginia mainland on the Western Shore. One of the eight original shires of Virginia, Accomac Shire was established there in 1634, eventually becoming the two counties of modern times, Accomack County in the north and Northampton County to the south. In comparison to mainland regions, commerce and growth was limited by the need to cross the Bay. Consequently, little industrial base grew there, with the oceanfront peninsula staying predominantly rural with small towns and villages oriented towards life on the waters, and most residents made their living by farming and working as watermen, both on the bay (locally known as the &quot;bay side&quot;) and in the Atlantic Ocean (&quot;sea side&quot;).

===Ferry system===
For the first 350 years, ships and ferry systems provided the primary transportation.

From the early 1930s to 1954, the Virginia Ferry Corporation (VFC), a privately owned public service company managed a scheduled vehicular (car, bus, truck) and passenger ferry service between the Virginia Eastern Shore and Princess Anne County (now part of the City of Virginia Beach) on the mainland Western Shore in the South Hampton Roads area. This system, connecting portions of US 13, was known as the Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry. In 1951, the northern terminus in Delmarva was relocated to a location now within Kiptopeke State Park.

Despite an expanded fleet of large and modern ships by the VFC in the 1940s and early 1950s which were eventually capable of as many as 90 one-way trips each day, the crossing suffered delays due to heavy traffic and inclement weather.

In 1954, the Virginia General Assembly created a political subdivision, the Chesapeake Bay Ferry District and its governing body, the Chesapeake Bay Ferry Commission. The commission was authorized to acquire the private ferry corporation through bond financing, to improve the existing VFC ferry service.

When the CBBT opened, much of the ferry equipment and vessels used by the Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry VFC service was sold and moved north to be redeployed to start the Cape May–Lewes Ferry across the mouth of the Delaware Bay between Cape May, New Jersey and Lewes, Delaware. It still serves transit needs, but the number of pleasure trip passengers increased as the coastal beach resorts developed and grew crowded with vacationers in the next decades, partly due to the improved swifter transportation with highway, bridge, and tunnel access in the region of three states.

===Studying a fixed crossing===
In 1956, the General Assembly authorized the Ferry Commission to conduct feasibility studies for the construction of a fixed crossing. The conclusion of the study indicated that a vehicular crossing was feasible.

Consideration was given to service between the Eastern Shore and both the peninsula and South Hampton Roads. Eventually, the shortest route, extending between the Eastern Shore and a point in Princess Anne County at Chesapeake Beach (east of Little Creek, west of Lynnhaven Inlet), was selected. An option to also provide a fixed crossing link to Hampton and the peninsula was not pursued.

The selected route crosses two Atlantic shipping channels: the Thimble Shoals Channel to Hampton Roads and the Chesapeake Channel to the northern Chesapeake Bay. High-level bridges were initially considered for traversing these channels. The United States Navy objected to bridging the Thimble Shoals Channel because a bridge collapse (possibly by sabotage) could cut Naval Station Norfolk off from the Atlantic Ocean. Maryland officials expressed similar concerns about the Chesapeake Channel and the Port of Baltimore.

To address these concerns, the engineers recommended a series of bridges and tunnels known as a bridge–tunnel, similar in design to the Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel, which had been completed in 1957, but on a considerably longer and larger facility. The tunnel portions, anchored by four artificial islands of approximately each, would be extended under the two main shipping channels. The CBBT was designed by the engineering firm Sverdrup &amp; Parcel of St. Louis, Missouri.

===Original construction===

In mid-1960, the Chesapeake Bay Ferry Commission sold $200 million in toll revenue bonds (equivalent to $ billion in dollars) to private investors, and the proceeds were used to finance the construction of the bridge–tunnel. Funds collected by future tolls were pledged to pay the principal and interest on the bonds. No local, state, or federal tax funds were used in the construction of the project.

Construction contracts were awarded to a consortium of Tidewater Construction Corporation and Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corporation. The steel superstructure for the high-level bridges near the north end of the crossing were fabricated by the American Bridge Division of United States Steel Corporation. Construction of the bridge–tunnel began in October 1960 after a six-month process of assembling necessary equipment from worldwide sources.

The tunnels were constructed using the technique refined by Ole Singstad with the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, whereby a large ditch was first dug for each tunnel, into which was lowered pre-fabricated tunnel sections cable-suspended from overhead barges. Interior chambers were filled with water to lower the sections, the sections then aligned, bolted together by divers, the water pumped out, and the tunnels finally covered with earth.

The construction was accomplished under the severe conditions imposed by nor&#x27;easters, hurricanes, and the unpredictable Atlantic Ocean. During the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962, much of the partially completed work and a major piece of custom-built equipment, a pile driver barge called &quot;The Big D&quot;, were destroyed. Seven workers were killed at various times during the construction. In April 1964, 42 months after construction began, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel opened to traffic and the ferry service discontinued.

The Ferry Commission and transportation district it oversees, created in 1954, were later renamed for the revised mission of building and operating the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel. The CBBT district is a public agency, and it is a legal subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The bridge–tunnel is supported financially by the tolls collected from the motorists who use the facility.
Eastern Shore native, businessman, and civic leader Lucius J. Kellam Jr. (1911–1995) was the original commission&#x27;s first chairman. In a commentary at the time of his death in 1995, the Norfolk-based &quot;Virginian-Pilot&quot; newspaper recalled that Kellam had been involved in bringing the multimillion-dollar bridge–tunnel project from dream to reality.

Before it was built, Kellam handled a political fight over the location, and addressed concerns of the U.S. Navy about prospective hazards to navigation to and from the Norfolk Navy Base at Sewell&#x27;s Point.

Kellam was also directly involved in the negotiations to finance the ambitious crossing with bonds. According to the newspaper article, &quot;there were not-unfounded fears that (1) storm-driven seas and drifting or off-course vessels could damage, if not destroy, the span and (2) traffic might not be sufficient to service the entire debt in an orderly way. Sure enough, bridge portions of the crossing have occasionally been damaged by vessels, and there was a long period when holders of the riskiest bonds received no interest on their investment.&quot;

An icon of eastern Virginia politics, Kellam remained chairman and champion of the CBBT throughout the hard times, and the bondholders were eventually paid as toll revenues caught up with expenses. He continued to serve until he was over 80 years old, finally retiring in 1993. He had held the post for 39 years.

The facility was renamed in Kellam&#x27;s honor in 1987, over 20 years after it opened.

===Bridge dualization (1999)===

At a cost of $197 million, new parallel two-lane trestles were built both to alleviate traffic and for safety reasons. Immediately after completion of the parallel trestles, traffic was diverted to them and the original trestles and roadway underwent a $20 million retrofit, repairing the wear and tear of 35 years of service and upgrading certain features, such as repaving the road surface. The older portion of the facility was then reopened on April 19, 1999.

The 1995–1999 project increased the capacity of the above-water portion of the facility to four lanes, added wider shoulders for the new southbound portion, facilitated needed repairs, and provided protection against a total closure should a trestle be struck by a ship or otherwise damaged (which had occurred twice in the past); partially for this reason, the parallel trestles are not located immediately adjacent to each other, reducing the chance that both would be damaged during a single incident.
===Thimble Shoal Tunnel dualization (projected 2027)===

In 2013, the CBBT Commission approved a project to construct a second tunnel under the Thimble Shoal channel for an estimated cost of $756 million. The project received three bids, all of which would use a tunnel boring machine. The winning company was German-based Herrenknecht, whose machine was long. The machine, nicknamed &quot;Chessie&quot; in a naming contest, was capable of moving forward through soil at per minute, or about per day. At that rate, it was estimated that the tunnel would be dug within about one year. Construction work began in 2017 to prepare the location of the tunnels. The affected pier, shop, and restaurant were closed in September 2017. The machine was built in 2018, after some delays, and was shipped to Virginia. After boring, the machine will also be adding the circular concrete segments which will be delivered into the tunnel via mine cars one at a time. Construction was scheduled to finish in 2023. By August 2022, the second tunnel at Thimble Shoal had been delayed to 2027.

* Soil removal: the approximate amount of soil to be removed by the tunnel boring machine (TBM) is .
* Concrete sections: The tunnel will consist of approximately 9,000 individual concrete pieces. Approximately of concrete will be needed to make the tunnel sections.

===Chesapeake Channel Tunnel dualization (projected 2035–2040)===

At the northern end, a parallel Chesapeake Channel Tunnel will be added to finish the entire length to become a four-lane highway from shore to shore. This project is marked to begin in 2035, which would possibly be open for traffic in 2040, assuming there are no setbacks or delays.

In 2021, the United States Department of Transportation loaned $338.6 million to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel District through the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, with funds provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The loan would help pay for the construction of both parallel tunnels.

==Operations, maintenance, and regulations==

Toll collection facilities are located at both ends of the facility. Tolls are paid in each direction. As of 2024, the toll for cars (without trailers) traveling along the CBBT is $16 for off-peak or $21 for peak times (Friday through Sunday from May 15 to September 15). Should a car make a return trip within 24 hours of the first, the second trip across costs $6/$1 for off peak/peak season, but only with an EZ-Pass; cash or card payers must pay full fare. Motorcycles pay the same toll as cars without trailers. All other vehicles are charged based on size and purpose and are not subject to the return-trip discount. All tolls must be paid either in cash, debit/credit card, by scrip tickets issued by the CBBT, or via E-ZPass electronic toll collection. The bridge–tunnel began accepting Smart Tag/E-ZPass payments on November 1, 2007.

All toll lanes including E-ZPass-only lanes are gated for safety concerns and to turn around inadmissible vehicles. For example:
* Strong winds have blown over certain vehicles. Therefore, some vehicles are banned when the wind speed exceeds . Level 6 wind restrictions with hurricane-force winds (at least , i.e., approaching the wind speed of a Category 1 hurricane, which is at least ), and other inclement weather conditions ban all traffic.
* Hazardous materials and compressed gas require various restrictions and inspections to safeguard the tunnels.
* Both tunnels have a height limit of . An over-height truck in April 2007 severely damaged the tunnels. Repairs took three weeks.
* Should police activities, accidents, or closures stop traffic from moving freely, gates prevent drivers from entering and then being forced to either back up within the narrow space or to wait too long in the middle of the bridge–tunnel.

The bridge–tunnel management prohibits bicycles but offers a shuttle van for $15. Cyclists must call ahead.

It is mandatory that the bridge be checked and serviced every five years. Since servicing the bridge takes about five years, the process is a continuous cycle.

The CBBT is the only automobile transportation facility in Virginia with its police department. By original charter from the state, it has authority to enforce the laws of Virginia. Emergency call boxes are spaced at half-mile (0.8 km) intervals.

==Tourism==

The CBBT promotes the bridge–tunnel as not only a transportation facility to tourist destinations to the north and south, but as a destination itself. For travelers headed elsewhere, the bridge–tunnel can save more than of driving for those headed between Ocean City, MD; Rehoboth Beach, DE, Fenwick Island, DE, and Wilmington, DE (and areas north) and the Virginia Beach area or the Outer Banks of North Carolina, according to the CBBT district. Unlike the Interstate Highways that travelers would avoid by taking the bridge–tunnel, the roads in the shortcut have traffic lights.

On the Delmarva peninsula to the north of the bridge, travelers may visit nearby Kiptopeke State Park, Eastern Shore National Wildlife Refuge, Fisherman Island National Wildlife Refuge (closed to the public), Assateague Island National Seashore, NASA&#x27;s Wallops Flight Facility, campgrounds and other vacation destinations. To the south are tourist destinations around Virginia Beach, including First Landing State Park, Norfolk Botanical Garden, Virginia Beach Maritime Historical Museum, Atlantic Wildfowl Heritage Museum, and the Virginia Aquarium and Maritime Science Center.

A scenic overlook is located at the north end of the bridge and was formerly located at South Thimble Island, near the south end. At South Thimble Island, passing ships may include U.S. Navy warships, nuclear submarines, and aircraft carriers, as well as large cargo vessels and sailing ships. A restaurant and gift shop on the island opened in 1964, along with the Sea Gull Pier. Bluefish, trout, croaker, flounder, and other species have been caught from the pier. Since birds use the habitat created by the bridges and islands of the CBBT, birders have travelled to the bridge–tunnel to see them at South Thimble Island and the scenic overlook at the north end. As part of the Thimble Shoal Channel Tunnel twinning, the building housing the restaurant and gift shop closed and access to the pier was prohibited starting at the end of September 2017. The building will be demolished and not replaced, and the pier will reopen to the public at the end of the project in 2027.

==Dimensions==
Among the key features of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel are two tunnels beneath the Thimble Shoals and Chesapeake navigation channels and two pairs of side-by-side high-level bridges over two other navigation channels: North Channel Bridge ( clearance) and Fisherman Inlet Bridge ( clearance). The remaining portion comprises of low-level trestle, of causeway, and four artificial islands.

The CBBT is long from shore to shore, crossing what is essentially an ocean strait. Including land-approach highways, the overall facility is long ( from toll plaza to toll plaza) and despite its length, there is a height difference of only from the south to north end of the bridge–tunnel.

Artificial islands, each approximately in size, are located at each end of the two tunnels. Between North Channel and Fisherman Inlet, the facility crosses at grade over Fisherman Island, a barrier island that is part of the Eastern Shore of Virginia National Wildlife Refuge administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The columns that support the CBBT&#x27;s trestles—called piles—would stretch for about if placed end-to-end, roughly the distance between New York City and Philadelphia.

== Incidents ==
The CBBT has been closed three times for multiple days after being struck by watercraft:
* In December 1967, coal barge &quot;Mohawk&quot; broke anchor and struck the bridge, closing it for two weeks for repairs.
* On January 21, 1970, the USS &quot;Yancey&quot; (AKA-93), a United States Navy attack cargo ship carrying 250 people, was at anchor near the bridge–tunnel. During a gale with winds gusting in excess of , the &quot;Yancey&quot; dragged its anchors and hit the bridge stern first, knocking out a segment of trestle. There were no vehicles on the bridge at the time of the impact, and no one was injured. During the 42 days it took to replace the damaged span, the Navy offered a free shuttle service for commuters using helicopters and LCUs.
* In 1972, the bridge was again impacted by a barge that had broken loose, closing it for two weeks while the span was repaired.

Other, less significant strikes have caused shorter closures while the affected structures are inspected—most recently, a four hour closure after a barge strike in June 2011.

, there have been 16 incidents of vehicles running off the bridge and into the water. In 2017, a truck plowed through the barriers into the sea below; the driver was rescued but died en route to the hospital. In December 2020, a dairy truck crashed through the guardrail near mile 14. Witnesses saw the driver drifting in the water—estimated to be about —but were unable to rescue him. Despite an extensive search, he remained missing until April 2021, when his body washed up over south at Cape Hatteras National Seashore between Salvo and Avon. A second truck following the dairy truck encountered strong wind gusts just prior to the accident that blew it into the other lane.

<text>Mateo Albéniz, also known as Mateo Antonio Pérez de Albéniz (c. 175523 June 1831) was a Spanish composer, theorist, and priest. He is not related to the better-known composer Isaac Albéniz, but he was the father of Pedro Albéniz. He is identified by the name Pedro Albéniz in some older biographical sources and was said to have died in 1821.

He was born in the Basque region. He held a post as Maestro de Capilla in San Sebastián and in Logroño from 1795 to 1800, when he returned to San Sebastián (where he died) until his retirement in 1829.

He composed masses, vespers, motets, and other church music, never published, and a book of solfeggi (published at St. Sebastian, 1800). Albéniz also wrote for the harpsichord and fortepiano. The work by which he is best known today is the &quot;Sonata in D major&quot;, of which a popular transcription for guitar has been made.

<text>United Kingdom Independent Broadcasting (UKIB) is an affiliation of three British independent television production companies and broadcasters. The primary function of its predecessor, the Independent Television Companies Association (ITCA), was to represent independent British television interests as a member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The current members of UKIB are the ITV network centre, the 4 ITV licence holders, Channel 4, and S4C.

== History ==

UKIB was formed in 1981, when the Association of Independent Radio Contractors (AIRC) was admitted as an active member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). It replaced the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), formerly the Independent Television Authority (ITA) as the second British EBU member.
Once ITCA was admitted as a fully active EBU member, the AIRC joined with UKIB to form the Commercial Radio Companies Association (CRCA) in June 1996. In July 2006, it merged with the Radio Advertising Bureau to form Radiocentre, the industry body for UK commercial radio. Following the merger, CRCA cancelled its EBU membership.

The IBA continued to exist until it was disbanded by the Broadcasting Act 1990, which replaced it with the Independent Television Commission (ITC) and the Radio Authority.

== Members ==

=== Digital channels ===
Besides the main ITV, Channel 4, and S4C channels, there are several digital-only channels (ITV2, ITV3, ITV4, CITV and ITVBe) owned by ITV plc and E4, More4, Film4, 4seven and 4Music (now extinguished) operated by Channel 4.

== Eurovision Song Contest ==
The &#x27;s entries in the Eurovision Song Contest have been entered by the BBC each time. However, the &#x27;s Junior Eurovision Song Contest entries were broadcast and selected by ITV from to , before ITV withdrew in due to low viewing figures. ITV were also set to host the contest in Manchester, but pulled out of hosting due to financial and scheduling issues, as well as the previous years poor viewing figures. The contest was eventually held in Lillehammer, Norway.

S4C announced on 9 May 2018 that would debut at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018 held in Minsk, Belarus. However, S4C withdrew from the contest in , citing the COVID-19 pandemic as the reason for their withdrawal, and have not returned since. On 25 August 2022, it was confirmed that the United Kingdom would return to the contest in in Yerevan, Armenia, with the BBC replacing ITV as the country&#x27;s broadcaster.

<doc id="885936" wikidata="Q6750" url="?curid=885936" title="Berliet">
<text>Berliet was a French manufacturer of automobiles, buses, trucks and military vehicles among other vehicles based in Vénissieux, outside of Lyon, France. Founded in 1899, and apart from a five-year period from 1944 to 1949 when it was put into &#x27;administration sequestre&#x27; it was in private ownership until 1967 when it then became part of Citroën, and subsequently acquired by Renault in 1974 and merged with Saviem into a new Renault Trucks company in 1978. The Berliet marque was phased out by 1980.

==Early history==

Marius Berliet started his experiments with automobiles in 1894. Some single-cylinder cars were followed in 1900 by a twin-cylinder model. In 1902, Berliet took over the plant of Audibert &amp; Lavirotte in Lyon. Berliet started to build four-cylinder automobiles featured by a honeycomb radiator and steel chassis frame was used instead of wood. The next year, a model was launched that was similar to contemporary Mercedes. In 1906, Berliet sold the licence for manufacturing his model to the American Locomotive Company.

Before World War I, Berliet offered a range of models from 8 CV to 60 CV. The main models had four-cylinder engines (2412 cc and 4398 cc, respectively), and there was a six-cylinder model of 9500 cc. A 1539 cc model (12 CV) was produced between 1910 and 1912. From 1912, six-cylinder models were made upon individual orders only.

==First World War==
The First World War led to a massive increase in demand. Berliet, like Renault and Latil, produced trucks for the French army. The military orders placed major demands on the factory&#x27;s capacity, necessitating major investment in production plant and factory space.

In 1915 a site was purchased between Vénissieux and Saint-Priest in order to build a new principal factory.

The Berliet CBA became the iconic truck on the Voie Sacrée, supplying the battle front at Verdun during 1916. 25,000 of these 4/5 ton Berliet trucks, originally launched in 1914, were ordered by the French army. During 1916 40 of them were leaving the plant each day. Under license from Renault, Berliet were also producing shells and battle tanks at this time. The number of workers employed increased to 3,150.

By 1917 the value of annual turnover had multiplied fourfold since the start of the war, and a new legal structure was deemed appropriate. The company became the Société anonyme des Automobiles Marius Berliet.

==Between two wars==
After the war the manufacturer reoriented part of its production back to passenger cars, but Berliet nevertheless found themselves with excess capacity, as the army was no longer buying all the trucks the factory could produce, and overall output halved.

===Shrinking the range===
Marius Berliet responded to the outbreak of peace by deciding to produce just a single type of truck and a single type of car, which represented a departure from his pre-war market strategy. The single truck on which Berliet focused was the 5 ton CBA that had served the nation so well during the war.

===An ill-judged short-cut===
The passenger car to be produced, exhibited on the Berliet stand at the 15th Paris Motor Show in October 1919, was the 3296cc (15HP/CV) &quot;Torpedo&quot; bodied &quot;Berliet Type VB&quot; of modern appearance. Marius Berliet was not one to miss a trick: rather than devote time and engineering talent to developing a new car for the new decade, he obtained and copied an American Dodge. The Dodge was famously robust, and the Berliet copy was well received in March 1919 when it had its first public outing, locally, at the Lyon Trade Fair. The headlights were mounted unusually high and the simple disc wheels were large, giving the car a pleasing &quot;no nonsense&quot; look. Particularly attractive was the price of just 11,800 francs in October 1919. Unfortunately, however, the Berliet engineers failed to ensure that the steel used in the car&#x27;s construction was of the same quality as the North American steel used for the Dodge, and this resulted in serious problems for the early customers of the &quot;Berliet Type VB&quot; and serious reputational damage to the company.

===Bankruptcy and recovery===
The factory had been set up to produce the &quot;Berliet Type VB&quot; at the rate of 100 cars per day which would have been an ambitious target under any circumstances. The rapid drop-off in demand for what at this stage was the manufacturer&#x27;s only passenger car model that followed the quality issues plunged the business into financial difficulties, with losses of 55 million francs recorded in one year. Survival was in doubt, and Berliet was placed in judicial administration in 1921. Marius Berliet himself had held 88% of the share capital, but was unable to pay off all the company&#x27;s creditors and the firm therefore fell into the hands of the banks. Berliet was nevertheless able to retain operational control. During the ensuring decade, supported by a sustained recovery in demand that in turn reflected an effective model strategy after 1922, Berliet was able to pay off his debtors and, in 1929, to regain financial control over the business from the banks.

===A full range for 1925===
By the middle of the decade the manufacturer was again exhibiting a full range of automobile models at the 1924 October Motor Show, although at this stage they all featured four cylinder engines including even the 3958cc &quot;4-litre&quot; with its impressive cylinder dimensions of 95 x 140 mm. The range for 1925 was as follows:
:* &quot;Type VI&quot;: Launched 1924 with a 1,160cc (7HP/CV) ohc engine. Wheelbase &quot;&lt;br&gt;Listed prices Oct 1924: 16,260 francs (bare chassis), 21,500 francs (Torpedo), 25,500 francs (berline/saloon/sedan)&quot;
:* &quot;Type VRC&quot; with a 2,603cc (12 HP/CV) sidevalve engine. Wheelbase &quot;&lt;br&gt;Listed prices Oct 1924: 20,600 francs (bare chassis), 26,500 francs (Torpedo), 34,000 francs (berline/saloon/sedan)&quot;
:* &quot;Type VM&quot; with a 3,296cc (16 HP/CV) sidevalve engine. Wheelbase &quot;&lt;br&gt;Listed prices Oct 1924: 24,800 francs (bare chassis), 33,000 francs (Torpedo), 41,650 francs (berline/saloon/sedan)&quot;
:* &quot;Type VRK / 2½-litre&quot; with a 2,480cc (16 HP/CV) ohv engine. Wheelbase &quot;&lt;br&gt;Listed prices Oct 1924: 30,000 francs (bare chassis), 46,500 francs (Torpedo), 48,500 francs (berline/saloon/sedan)&quot;
:* &quot;Type VK&quot; with a 3,958cc (18 HP/CV) ohv engine. Wheelbase &lt;br&gt;Listed &quot;prices Oct 1924: 48,500 francs (bare chassis only)&quot;

From 1925 the manufacturer was producing its own car bodies.

===Pushing up market===
New six-cylinder models followed in 1927. By October 1928, just twelve months before the Wall Street crash crystallized a savage downturn for the western economies, three of the four cars offered for 1929 on the Berliet stand at the Paris Motor Show, were powered by six cylinder engines. The range for 1929 was as follows:

:* &quot;9CV&quot;: 1.5-litre 4-cylinder engine. Wheelbase 
:* &quot;10CV&quot;: 1.8-litre 6-cylinder engine. Wheelbase 
:* &quot;11CV&quot;: 2.0-litre 6-cylinder engine. Wheelbase 
:* &quot;20CV&quot;: 4.0-litre 6-cylinder engine. Wheelbase 

The largest of these, with its four-litre engine, was still listed by the manufacturer in March 1929, but was only available &quot;to special order&quot;. However, by this time the manufacturer was also developing, for 1930, a &quot;16CV&quot; 2.8-litre six-cylinder model.

===The 1930s===
In 1930 Berliet experimentally installed a diesel engine in one of their old CBA trucks, and in 1931 a batch of diesel powered Berliet GD2s was produced.

From 1933, only four-cylinder models (1600 cc and 2000 cc) were offered. The last new Berliet sedan was first exhibited at the Paris Motor Show in October 1933 but only launched in the summer of 1934. The new car received a proper name, and the Berliet Dauphine 11CV was powered by a 1,990 cc (11CV) engine. For 1939 Berliet stopped producing car bodies and the last few hundred Berliet Dauphines, produced in the first half of 1939, used the body of a Peugeot 402 with a custom-made Berliet hood/bonnet and radiator grille.

==Second World War and aftermath==

Regular passenger car production ceased in 1939 and after World War II, the company produced trucks only, with buses added to the range later. However, more than 20 brand-new sedans were in the factory when the Germans requisitioned it in June 1940, and these were immediately put into service. After the liberation, from late 1944 to early 1945, about 50 sedans were assembled from parts on hand, and in 1946, the last 15 sedans were completed by the Geneva agents. The company was given back to the family in 1949, but to Marius Berliet&#x27;s son Paul following the founder&#x27;s death earlier that year. The Berliet GLR truck became the first new post-war product.

In his 1975 book, &quot;Vichy France: old guard and new order: 1940-1944&quot;, Robert Paxton contrasted the fate of the Berliet truck factory in Lyon, which remained in Marius Berliet&#x27;s family possession, despite his having manufactured 2,330 trucks for the Germans. — and the fate of Louis Renault&#x27;s factories, which had also been seized — suggesting that the Renault factory might have been returned to Louis Renault and his family, had he lived longer. Marius Berliet, who died in 1949, had however &quot;stubbornly refused to recognize legal actions against him after the war.&quot; As it happened, Renault&#x27;s were the only factories permanently seized by the French government.

After a small start with diesel engines in 1931, Berliet (and their customers) gradually abandoned petrol engines. In 1963, only 234 of the 15,325 Berliet vehicles built still received petrol engines.

Berliet manufactured the largest truck in the world in 1957, the T100 6X6 with either and from a Cummins V12 engine. Available as a 6WD Dumptruck or 6X6 Roadtractor for Europe and North Africa it was designed in 10 months at the factory in Courbevoie, outside of Paris, with a second example built in 1958 and two further T100s built in 1959.

Later on a separate company called MOL Trucks of Hooglede, Belgium bought the design rights of some original Berliet models of the 1970s and started to manufacture their own original MOL model range consisting of medium to large 4X4, 6X6 and 8X8 lorries and roadtractors. Their design and engineering was entirely based on selected former Berliet units.

==Citroën, Renault and demise==
In August 1967, it was reported that Berliet had been taken over by Citroën, Berliet share holders receiving Citroën shares in return for their Berliet stock. In 1966, Berliet&#x27;s final year as an independent, they had produced approximately 17,000 units. Following the take-over the merged company stated that Citroën-Berliet would command 58% of France&#x27;s market for commercial vehicles above 6 tons. Citroën itself had been owned by Michelin since 1934 following a cash crisis of its own.

By this time, Michelin owned both Citroën and Berliet. However, after the 1973 oil crisis, Michelin decided to divest itself of these two companies in order to concentrate on its tire business. Thus, in 1974 Berliet was sold to Renault, while Citroën was sold to Peugeot. Renault then proceeded to merge Berliet with Saviem to form Renault Véhicules Industriels in 1978.

After the merger, the Berliet name was phased out and another French marque came to an end by the late 1970s, with the last Berliet bus in production, the 1971 PR100, continuing to be sold as a Renault until 1993. Other products that survived the merger include the 1973 VXB-170 4x4 armoured personnel carrier for the French Army and others. Another of Berliet&#x27;s last projects was a six-cylinder light diesel engine, which entered production in 1977 and had become Renault V.I.&#x27;s 06.20 (&quot;120 bore&quot;) engine by 1982.

<doc id="885937" wikidata="Q7272623" url="?curid=885937" title="Quisp">
<text>Quisp is a sugar-sweetened breakfast cereal from the Quaker Oats Company. It was introduced in 1965 and continued as a mass-market grocery item until the late 1970s. Subsequently, the Quaker Oats Company marketed Quisp sporadically, and with the advent of the Internet, began selling it primarily online. Quisp made its return to supermarkets as a mass-market grocery item in late 2012.

Quaker Oats initially marketed Quisp with a sister brand, Quake. Television commercials featuring both brands were produced by Jay Ward, the producer of &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;.

==History==

Quisp and Quake were originally released in 1965 in the United States by the Quaker Oats Company and generally advertised together (during the same commercial) with their character mascots competing against each other. The ads were cartoons created by Jay Ward, who also created the cartoon characters Rocky and Bullwinkle, Dudley Do-Right, Hoppity Hooper and many others, and the Quisp ads used some of the same voice actors as the &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; series, including Daws Butler as the voice of Quisp and William Conrad as the voice of Quake. 

In an interview, Ward&#x27;s creative partner Bill Scott described Ward&#x27;s involvement in cereal advertising: &quot;When the cereal company approached Jay about doing this stuff — I think it was in 1961 — he said, &#x27;We’ll only do it as long as it’s fun.&#x27;&quot;

Quisp was depicted as a diminutive alien with antennae that functioned as a propeller enabling him to fly. The Crown Prince of Planet Q, he was dressed in a green boilersuit with a &quot;Q&quot; belt buckle on his black belt, and, like moon men Gidney and Cloyd of Ward&#x27;s &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, was armed with a scrooch gun. In contrast, the more &quot;earthy&quot; Quake was portrayed as a tall, musclebound red-headed miner wearing blue pants, black work-boots, a red t-shirt emblazoned with a blue &quot;Q&quot;, a yellow miner&#x27;s helmet with a headlamp, a wristband on his right arm and a purple cape. 

The commercials often asked children to choose which cereal was better, and to compete over taste or premiums. The competition reached its peak in 1972, when a series of commercials asked kids to vote for which cereal should remain on the shelves. In 1969, Quake was given a makeover, slimming down and swapping his lighted miner&#x27;s hard hat for an Australian bush hat and cape. Quisp was the winner and Quake cereal was discontinued, but Quake himself introduced a new sidekick, an orange kangaroo named Simon and a new orange-flavored cereal called Quake&#x27;s Orange Quangaroos. In 1976, Quaker Oats ran another contest, this time asking children to choose between Quisp and Quangaroos. Quisp won again and Quangaroos was discontinued.

Around 1979, Quisp was discontinued due to low sales. It was reintroduced in 1985, then again in the 1990s and in 2001, where it was relaunched as the &quot;first Internet cereal&quot;. Consumers were encouraged to visit the Quisp Web site to view animated endings to cartoons on the back of the cereal box. The online Flash animation was produced by John Kricfalusi and Spümcø, featuring Quisp and his sidekick Quunchy (voiced by Corey Burton and Matt Danner, respectively).

Quisp remained in limited distribution for some time, with Quaker Oats distributing the product in &quot;guerrilla displays&quot; that would appear in a store and last until the product sold out. Even in the late 2010s, it could occasionally be found in grocery and discount chains such as Dollar General, Grocery Outlet, Marc&#x27;s, SuperTarget, and Food Lion. Quaker Oats also sold Quisp directly to the public through an online store.

==Description==
Quisp is a baked paste of corn meal and syrup shaped like saucers. The taste is similar to that of Cap&#x27;n Crunch, also made by Quaker Oats. Quake cereal was produced by the same process and ingredients, but shaped like gears. Packaging as of 2012 carries the tagline on the front panel, &quot;Crunchy Corn Cereal&quot;, and on side panels, &quot;QUAZY Energy Cereal&quot;.

==Ingredients==
Main ingredients: Corn flour, sugar, oat flour, brown sugar, coconut oil, salt. Vitamins and other additives: niacinamide, reduced iron, zinc oxide, yellow 5, yellow 6, thiamin mononitrate, pyridoxine hydrochloride, BHT, riboflavin, folic acid.

<text>The Lunar Orbiter 3 was a spacecraft launched by NASA in 1967 as part of the Lunar Orbiter Program. It was designed primarily to photograph areas of the lunar surface for confirmation of safe landing sites for the Surveyor and Apollo missions. It was also equipped to collect selenodetic, radiation intensity, and micrometeoroid impact data.

==Mission summary==
The spacecraft was placed in a cislunar trajectory and injected into an elliptical near-equatorial lunar orbit on February 8 at 21:54 UT. The orbit was with an inclination of 20.9 degrees and a period of 3 hours 25 minutes. After four days (25 orbits) of tracking the orbit was changed to . The spacecraft acquired photographic data from February 15 to 23, 1967, and readout occurred through March 2, 1967. The film advance mechanism showed erratic behavior during this period resulting in a decision to begin readout of the frames earlier than planned. The frames were read out successfully until March 4 when the film advance motor burned out, leaving about 25% of the frames on the takeup reel, unable to be read.

A total of 149 medium resolution and 477 high resolution frames were returned. The frames were of excellent quality with resolution down to . Included was a frame of the Surveyor 1 landing site, permitting identification of the location of the spacecraft on the surface. The future landing site of Apollo 14 including Cone crater, was photographed by the orbiter. Accurate data were acquired from all other experiments throughout the mission. The spacecraft was used for tracking purposes until it struck the lunar surface on command at 14.3 degrees N latitude, 97.7 degrees W longitude (selenographic coordinates) on October 9, 1967.

<text>Ernst Gottlieb Baron or Ernst Theofil Baron (17 February 1696 – 12 April 1760), was a German lutenist, composer and writer on music.

Baron was born in Breslau into the family of Michael Baron, a maker of gold lace who expected his son to follow in his footsteps. Baron showed an inclination to music from an early age, and later made it his profession. He studied lute from about 1710 with a Bohemian named Kohott. He attended the Elisabeth Gymnasium in Breslau, and from 1715 the University of Leipzig, where he studied philosophy and law.

He spent the period from 1719 to 1728 in travels from one small court to another. He visited Halle, Köthen, Schleiz, Saalfeld and Rudolstadt, arriving in Jena in 1720 and remaining for two years. Later he travelled to Kassel, Fulda, Würzburg, Nuremberg and Regensburg, returning in 1727 to Nuremberg where he published his &quot;Historisch-theoretische und practische Untersuchung des Instruments der Lauten&quot;, the work for which he is principally remembered. In 1728 he replaced the lutenist Meusel, who had recently died in a horseback riding accident, at the court of Gotha. He held that post for four years. After the death of the Duke of Gotha he moved on to Eisenach.

In 1737 he visited Merseburg, Köthen and Zerbst, and eventually joined the musical ensemble of Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia as a theorbist. He was immediately granted permission to go to Dresden to purchase a theorbo. In Dresden he received tuition from the lutenists Sylvius Leopold Weiss and I.A. Hofer.

After Frederick&#x27;s accession in 1740, Baron continued to serve as theorbist in the royal musical establishment, and remained at this post until his death in Berlin.

==Writings==
Baron’s &quot;Untersuchung&quot; is a valuable source of information about lutenists and lute playing in the late Baroque era. It is divided into two main parts. The first deals with the history of the lute, and contains important references to contemporary players. The second is devoted to the practice of the instrument.

Baron’s other writings, currently incompletely studied, supplement the &quot;Untersuchung,&quot; and explore other subjects.

<text>The Hour of Bewilderbeast is the debut studio album by British musician Badly Drawn Boy, released on 26 June 2000. Damon Gough, who performs as Badly Drawn Boy, wrote, produced, and played several instruments on the album&#x27;s eighteen tracks, several of which also feature accompaniment by members of the British indie rock bands Alfie and Doves. &quot;The Hour of Bewilderbeast&quot; was released to great critical acclaim and went on to win the 2000 Mercury Prize, and has sold 455,000 copies in the United Kingdom as of September 2011.

==Release==
The cover art, designed by Andy Votel, is a collage loosely based on Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s drawing &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;. For the American release of the album, the album&#x27;s cover was altered to remove a photograph of American actor and director Woody Allen, which was unauthorized by the copyright owners of the photograph. In addition, the song &quot;Magic in the Air&quot; was re-recorded with new instrumental parts to replace a section of the song utilizing lyrics taken from the 1987 song &quot;Love Is Contagious&quot; by R&amp;B singer Taja Sevelle, after Sevelle&#x27;s publishing company BMG objected to the use of the lyrics.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;The Hour of Bewilderbeast&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim. On the review aggregate site Metacritic, the album holds a score of 78 out of 100, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Michael Hubbard of MusicOMH felt that the album &quot;deserves to do well for many more reasons than the act&#x27;s name, excellent though it is&quot;, and that &quot;a surprise is set loose with every track&quot;. Calling the album a &quot;concise tour through the gentler side of British songwriting history&quot;, Brent DiCrescenzo of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that the varied instrumentation &quot;[attaches] insect wings to the lovely songs&quot; and concluded that with &quot;The Hour of Bewilderbeast&quot;, &quot;Badly Drawn Boy proves what shallow saps American liberal arts majors can be behind a guitar.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush stated that Gough had written and produced &quot;over a dozen excellent songs of baroque folk-pop for his album debut, and the many gems can&#x27;t help but shine through all the self-indulgence&quot;, highlighting Gough&#x27;s use of humour in his lyrics.

&quot;Alternative Press&quot; stated that &quot;The Hour of Bewilderbeast&quot; gives &quot;as full a portrait as possible of Gough&#x27;s musical and personal life,&quot; while David Browne, writing in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, called the album an &quot;intimate hour that&#x27;s far from bewildering.&quot; Pat Blashill of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; compared Gough to Elliott Smith and Nick Drake and wrote that &quot;like Drake, he&#x27;s mastered the art of evoking melancholy without slathering on too much sentimentality.&quot; Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; drew similar comparisons to Drake, while noting that Gough &quot;never succumbs to Drake&#x27;s sad solipsism, though, favoring an expansive reach emotionally and musically.&quot; In a more mixed assessment, &quot;Spin&quot;″s Barney Hoskyns wrote that &quot;Gough&#x27;s dewy little tunes are mere scribblings in the margins of alt-folk&#x27;s dog-eared hook-book, while his too-cool-to-care singing is drip-dry dreary&quot; and that &quot;The Hour of Bewilderbeast&quot;, when compared to Elliott Smith&#x27;s &quot;Figure 8&quot;, makes Gough &quot;look like an imposter.&quot;

&quot;The Hour of Bewilderbeast&quot; appeared on several year-end lists. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked the album at number 18 on its list of the top 20 albums of 2000. &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album at number 4 on its list of the 50 best albums of 2000. In addition, the album received the 2000 Mercury Prize, a prize Gough was favoured to win. When Gough received the prize, he tossed the prize money on the ground and said: &quot;I always assumed I was never going to win because good things don&#x27;t happen to good people normally.&quot;

The album was also listed in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>The Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 140-2, (FIPS PUB 140-2), is a U.S. government computer security standard used to approve cryptographic modules. The title is &quot;Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules&quot;. Initial publication was on May 25, 2001, and was last updated December 3, 2002.

Its successor, FIPS 140-3, was approved on March 22, 2019, and became effective on September 22, 2019. FIPS 140-3 testing began on September 22, 2020, and the first FIPS 140-3 validation certificates were issued in December 2022. FIPS 140-2 testing was still available until September 21, 2021 (later changed for applications already in progress to April 1, 2022), creating an overlapping transition period of more than one year. FIPS 140-2 test reports that remain in the CMVP queue will still be granted validations after that date, but all FIPS 140-2 validations will be moved to the Historical List on September 21, 2026 regardless of their actual final validation date.

== Purpose ==

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued the FIPS 140 Publication Series to coordinate the requirements and standards for cryptography modules that include both hardware and software components. Protection of a cryptographic module within a security system is necessary to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the information protected by the module. This standard specifies the security requirements that will be satisfied by a cryptographic module. The standard provides four increasing qualitative levels of security intended to cover a wide range of potential applications and environments. The security requirements cover areas related to the secure design and implementation of a cryptographic module. These areas include cryptographic module specification; cryptographic module ports and interfaces; roles, services, and authentication; finite state model; physical security; operational environment; cryptographic key management; electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC); self-tests; design assurance; and mitigation of other attacks.

Federal agencies and departments can validate that the module in use is covered by an existing FIPS 140-1 or FIPS 140-2 certificate that specifies the exact module name, hardware, software, firmware, and/or applet version numbers. The cryptographic modules are produced by the private sector or open source communities for use by the U.S. government and other regulated industries (such as financial and health-care institutions) that collect, store, transfer, share and disseminate sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information. A commercial cryptographic module is also commonly referred to as a hardware security module (HSM).

==Security levels==
FIPS 140-2 defines four levels of security, simply named &quot;Level 1&quot; to &quot;Level 4&quot;. It does not specify in detail what level of security is required by any particular application.

===Level 1===
Security Level 1 provides the lowest level of security. Basic security requirements are specified for a cryptographic module (e.g., at least one Approved algorithm or Approved security function shall be used). No specific physical security mechanisms are required in a Security Level 1 cryptographic module beyond the basic requirement for production-grade components. An example of a Security Level 1 cryptographic module is a personal computer (PC) encryption board.

===Level 2===
Security Level 2 improves upon the physical security mechanisms of a Security Level 1 cryptographic module by requiring features that show evidence of tampering, including tamper-evident coatings or seals that must be broken to attain physical access to the plaintext cryptographic keys and critical security parameters (CSPs) within the module, or pick-resistant locks on covers or doors to protect against unauthorized physical access.

===Level 3===
In addition to the tamper-evident physical security mechanisms required at Security Level 2, Security Level 3 attempts to prevent the intruder from gaining access to CSPs held within the cryptographic module. Physical security mechanisms required at Security Level 3 are intended to have a high probability of detecting and responding to attempts at physical access, use or modification of the cryptographic module. The physical security mechanisms may include the use of strong enclosures and tamper-detection/response circuitry that zeroes all plaintext CSPs when the removable covers/doors of the cryptographic module are opened.

===Level 4===
Security Level 4 provides the highest level of security. At this security level, the physical security mechanisms provide a complete envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical access. Penetration of the cryptographic module enclosure from any direction has a very high probability of being detected, resulting in the immediate deletion of all plaintext CSPs.

Security Level 4 cryptographic modules are useful for operation in physically unprotected environments. Security Level 4 also protects a cryptographic module against a security compromise due to environmental conditions or fluctuations outside of the module&#x27;s normal operating ranges for voltage and temperature. Intentional excursions beyond the normal operating ranges may be used by an attacker to thwart a cryptographic module&#x27;s defenses. A cryptographic module is required to either include special environmental protection features designed to detect fluctuations and delete CSPs, or to undergo rigorous environmental failure testing to provide a reasonable assurance that the module will not be affected by fluctuations outside of the normal operating range in a manner that can compromise the security of the module.

==Operating platform==
For Levels 2 and higher, the operating platform upon which the validation is applicable is also listed. Vendors do not always maintain their baseline validations.

== Cryptographic Module Validation Program==
FIPS 140-2 establishes the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) as a joint effort by the NIST and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) for the Government of Canada

Security programs overseen by NIST and CSE focus on working with government and industry to establish more secure systems and networks by developing, managing and promoting security assessment tools, techniques, services, and supporting programs for testing, evaluation and validation; and addresses such areas as: development and maintenance of security metrics, security evaluation criteria and evaluation methodologies, tests and test methods; security-specific criteria for laboratory accreditation; guidance on the use of evaluated and tested products; research to address assurance methods and system-wide security and assessment methodologies; security protocol validation activities; and appropriate coordination with assessment-related activities of voluntary industry standards bodies and other assessment regimes.

== FIPS 140-2 testing in this program ==
The FIPS 140-2 standard is an information technology security approval program for cryptographic modules produced by private sector vendors who seek to have their products certified for use in government departments and regulated industries (such as financial and health-care institutions) that collect, store, transfer, share and disseminate sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information.

Tamper evident FIPS 140-2 security labels are utilized to deter and detect tampering of modules.

== Laboratories doing the testing==
All of the tests under the CMVP are handled by third-party laboratories that are accredited as Cryptographic Module Testing laboratories by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). Vendors interested in validation testing may select any of the twenty-one accredited labs.

NVLAP accredited Cryptographic Modules Testing laboratories perform validation testing of cryptographic modules. Cryptographic modules are tested against requirements found in FIPS PUB 140–2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. Security requirements cover 11 areas related to the design and implementation of a cryptographic module. Within most areas, a cryptographic module receives a security level rating (1–4, from lowest to highest), depending on what requirements are met. For other areas that do not provide for different levels of security, a cryptographic module receives a rating that reflects fulfillment of all of the requirements for that area.

== Validation ==

An overall rating is issued for the cryptographic module, which indicates:
# the minimum of the independent ratings received in the areas with levels, and
# the fulfillment of all the requirements in the other areas.

On a vendor&#x27;s validation certificate, individual ratings are listed, as well as the overall rating.

NIST maintains validation lists for all of its cryptographic standards testing programs (past and present). All of these lists are updated as new modules/implementations receive validation certificates from NIST and CSE. Items on the FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2 validation list reference validated algorithm implementations that appear on the algorithm validation lists.

== Compliance ==
In addition to using a valid cryptographic module, encryption solutions are required to use cipher suites with approved algorithms or security functions established by the FIPS 140-2 Annex A to be considered FIPS 140-2 compliant.

== Annexes ==
FIPS PUB 140-2 Annexes:

* Annex A: Approved Security Functions (Draft October 12, 2021)
* Annex B: Approved Protection Profiles (Draft June 10, 2019)
* Annex C: Approved Random Number Generators (Draft October 12, 2021)
* Annex D: Approved Key Establishment Techniques (Draft October 12, 2021)

==Reception==
Steven Marquess has posted a criticism that FIPS 140-2 validation can lead to incentives to keep vulnerabilities and other defects hidden. CMVP can decertify software in which vulnerabilities are found, but it can take a year to re-certify software if defects are found, so companies can be left without a certified product to ship. As an example, Steven Marquess mentions a vulnerability that was found, publicised, and fixed in the FIPS-certified open-source derivative of OpenSSL, with the publication meaning that the OpenSSL derivative was decertified. This decertification hurt companies relying on the OpenSSL-derivative&#x27;s FIPS certification. By contrast, companies that had renamed and certified a copy of the open-source OpenSSL derivative were not decertified, even though they were basically identical, and did not fix the vulnerability. Steven Marquess therefore argues that the FIPS process inadvertently encourages hiding software&#x27;s origins, to de-associate it from defects since found in the original, while potentially leaving the certified copy vulnerable.

In recent years, CMVP has taken steps to avoid the situation described by Marquess, moving validations to the Historical List based on the algorithms and functions contained in the module, rather than based on the provenance.

<doc id="885956" wikidata="Q1066381" url="?curid=885956" title="Lunar Orbiter 4">
<text>Lunar Orbiter 4 was a robotic U.S. spacecraft, part of the Lunar Orbiter Program, designed to orbit the Moon, after the three previous orbiters had completed the required needs for Apollo mapping and site selection. It was given a more general objective, to &quot;perform a broad systematic photographic survey of lunar surface features in order to increase the scientific knowledge of their nature, origin, and processes, and to serve as a basis for selecting sites for more detailed scientific study by subsequent orbital and landing missions&quot;. It was also equipped to collect selenodetic, radiation intensity, and micrometeoroid impact data. 

==Mission summary==
The spacecraft was placed in a cislunar trajectory and injected into an elliptical near polar high lunar orbit for data acquisition. The orbit was with an inclination of 85.5 degrees and a period of 12 hours.

After initial photography on May 11, 1967 problems started occurring with the camera&#x27;s thermal door, which was not responding well to commands to open and close. Fear that the door could become stuck in the closed position covering the camera lenses led to a decision to leave the door open. This required extra attitude control maneuvers on each orbit to prevent light leakage into the camera which would ruin the film. On May 13 it was discovered that light leakage was damaging some of the film, and the door was tested and partially closed. Some fogging of the lens was then suspected due to condensation resulting from the lower temperatures. Changes in the attitude raised the temperature of the camera and generally eliminated the fogging. Continuing problems with the readout drive mechanism starting and stopping beginning on May 20 resulted in a decision to terminate the photographic portion of the mission on May 26. Despite problems with the readout drive the entire film was read and transmitted. The spacecraft acquired photographic data from May 11 to 26, 1967, and readout occurred through June 1, 1967. The orbit was then lowered to gather orbital data for the upcoming Lunar Orbiter 5 mission.

A total of 419 high-resolution and 127 medium-resolution frames were acquired, which covered 99% of the Moon&#x27;s near side at resolutions from . Accurate data was acquired from all other experiments throughout the mission. Radiation data showed increased dosages due to solar particle events producing low energy protons. The spacecraft was used for tracking until it struck the lunar surface due to the natural decay of the orbit no later than October 31, 1967, between 22 and 30 degrees W longitude.

<doc id="885960" wikidata="Q1780030" url="?curid=885960" title="Debutante">
<text>A debutante, also spelled débutante ( ; from , ), or deb is a young woman of aristocratic or upper-class family background who has reached maturity and is presented to society at a formal &quot;debut&quot; ( , ; ) or possibly debutante ball. Originally, the term indicated that the woman was old enough to be married, and one purpose of her &quot;coming out&quot; was to display her to eligible bachelors and their families with a view to marriage within a select circle.

A debutante ball, sometimes called a coming-out party, is a formal ball that includes presenting debutantes during the social season, usually during the spring or summer. Debutante balls may require prior instruction in social etiquette and appropriate morals.

==Austria==

Vienna, Austria, maintains the most active formal ball season in the world. From 1 January to 1 March, no fewer than 28 formal balls, with a huge variety of hosts, are held in Vienna. Many are for specific nationalities, like the Russian Ball or the Serbian Saint Sava ball; social groups like the Hunter&#x27;s Ball or Verein Grünes Kreuz ball, or trade groups like the Coffee Roasters or Doctors Ball. Some of these balls also have debutantes. However, the two that are best known for their debutantes are the Officer&#x27;s Ball and the Vienna Opera Ball.

The is considered to be the direct successor of Vienna&#x27;s Imperial Court Ball. The modern version was founded in 1919, by the association Alt-Neustadt, an association of graduates of the Theresian Military Academy. They have organized the ball publicly since 1926. The Ball is held on the third Friday of January across the twenty-three salons of the Vienna Hofburg Palace and includes nine bands of different styles of music, military formations, and dancing troupes from around the world. The patron is the President of the Republic and it is hosted by the Chief of the Defense Staff. The entrance and presentation of the 80 debutantes is the highlight of the opening event, followed by the presentation of ministers of state, then the Diplomatic Corps, and finishes with the debutantes leading the first formal Viennese waltz to the music of &quot;The Blue Danube&quot;. The ladies are from the nobility, daughters of senior ranking military officers, or female officers in the Austrian military. They are presented to the Minister of Defense. The dress code is evening dress: floor-length gowns for women, and white tie and tails for men or mess dress uniform for military members. The final ceremonial is the blowing of the hunt horns and takes place at 4 o&#x27;clock in the morning.

The Vienna Opera Ball is held in the auditorium of the Vienna State Opera which is turned into a large ballroom. On the eve of the event, the rows of seats are removed from the stalls, and a new floor, level with the stage, is built. The ball does not start until around 10 pm when the Austrian president and his guests enter the imperial balcony. Their arrival is heralded by trumpets. The Austrian national anthem is played followed by the European anthem. There are performances of the state opera ballet company and classical arias sung by the opera stars. These are normally a small selection of Italian opera and famous Austrian pieces. The highlight of the opening ceremony is the introduction of 180 debutante couples. These are carefully selected young women and men who have successfully completed an application program and a strict classical dance choreography organised by the Elmayer dance school. The debutantes are led into the opera house to the sounds of Carl Michael Ziehrer&#x27;s Fächerpolonaise. The dress code is evening dress: white tie and tails for men; strictly floor-length gowns for women. White opera gloves are still mandatory for female debutantes at the Vienna Opera Ball.

==Australia==
Australia inherited the practice of debutante presentation from the British monarchy, with colonial governors and Governors-General of Australia responsible for organizing events in the early decades.

In modern Australia, debutante balls (or colloquially &quot;deb balls&quot;) are usually organised by high schools, church groups or service clubs, such as Lions or Rotary. The girls who take part are in either Year 10, 11 or 12 at high school (i.e. aged between 15 and 18). The event is often used as a fund-raiser for local charities.

The Australian debutante wears a white or pale-coloured gown similar to a wedding dress. However, the dress does not come with a train on the skirt, and the debutante does not wear a veil. The boy wears black tie or another formal dress suit.

It is customary for the female to ask a male to the debutante ball, with males not being able to &quot;do the deb&quot; unless they are asked, similar to a Sadie Hawkins Dance. The debutantes and their partners must learn how to dance in ballroom style. Debutante balls are almost always held in a reception centre, school hall, the function room of a sporting or other community organisation, e.g. RSL club, or ballroom. Usually they are held late in the year and consist of dinner, dancing, and speeches.
==Canada==
Canada inherited the practice of debutante presentation to the local representative of the British monarch. By 1867, events were held by the Governor General of Canada in the chambers of the Senate of Canada.

Canadian debutantes often travelled to the United Kingdom to be presented at the Court of St James&#x27;s. The last debutante to be presented was Canadian Sandra Seagram.

==United Kingdom==
In early modern times, marriage in the UK was an economic transaction that required a dowry for the woman, who would not inherit her father&#x27;s estate. The Protestant Reformation eliminated convents where less desirable daughters could be sent and avoid the expense of buying a desirable husband. To more efficiently match unmarried women of relatively high-status families to eligible bachelors, Queen Elizabeth I established the tradition of summoning them for formal presentation to the British monarch. 

In 1780, King George III organized the first Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Ball at the Court of St James&#x27;s in honour of his wife&#x27;s birthday and to counter criticism that the couple was too frugal. This began the tradition of the British social season beginning with presentation of debutantes at royal court.

In the Victorian era, those who wanted to be presented at court required a former debutante, i.e. a lady who had previously been presented to the sovereign, to apply on their behalf for permission. Such recommendations were often made by the mother of a young woman, or her mother-in-law if she was married. As eligibility expanded beyond British nobles, wealthy American families would sometimes pay British noblewomen to allow their daughters to become debutantes in the UK. If the application was accepted, they would be sent a royal summons from the Lord Chamberlain to attend the presentation on a certain day. According to &quot;Debrett&#x27;s&quot;, the proceedings on that day always started at 10 am. In addition to debutantes, older women, and married women who had not previously been presented, could be presented at court.

On the day of the court presentation, the debutante and her sponsor would be announced, the debutante would curtsy to the monarch, and she would leave without turning her back.

After the widespread availability of suitably white fabric in the Victorian era, the court dress was traditionally a white evening dress, but shades of ivory and pink were acceptable. The dress featured short sleeves and the young woman also wore long white gloves, a veil attached to the hair with three white ostrich feathers, and a train, which the debutante would hold on her arm until she was ready to be presented. Debutantes would wear pearls, but many would also wear jewellery that belonged to the family.

After the debutantes had been presented to the monarch, they would attend the social season. The season consisted of events such as afternoon tea parties, polo matches, races at Royal Ascot, and balls. Many debutantes would also have their own &quot;coming-out party&quot; or, alternatively, a party shared with a sister or other member of family.

Debutante presentations were cancelled in 1921 due to a coal miners&#x27; strike, and abbreviated in 1936 due to the impatience of King Edward VIII.

The last debutantes were presented at the Court of St James&#x27;s in 1958, after which Queen Elizabeth II abolished the ceremony; Princess Margaret, the Queen&#x27;s sister, acidly remarked, &quot;We had to put a stop to it. Every tart in London was getting in&quot;, as British society was becoming more egalitarian. More &quot;bluestocking&quot; debutantes went to college after their debuts, and participants had been complaining about the physical and financial burden. Attempts were made to keep the tradition going by organising a series of parties for young women who might otherwise have been presented at court in their first season (to which suitable young men were also invited) by Peter Townend. However, the withdrawal of royal patronage made these occasions decreasingly significant, and scarcely distinguishable from any other part of the social season. The last Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Ball under Elizabeth II was in 1976. It has since been revived under the patronage of the Duke of Somerset; debutantes bow to the Queen Charlotte&#x27;s birthday cake. The monarchy took a more populist approach, emphasizing the Victorian tradition of garden parties, to which Elizabeth invited people from all backgrounds.

===In popular culture===
The expression &quot;debutante&quot;, or &quot;deb&quot; for short, has continued to be used, especially in the press, to refer to young women of marriageable age who participate in a semi-public, upper class social scene.

The expression &quot;deb&#x27;s delight&quot; is applied to good-looking, unmarried young men from similar backgrounds.

==United States==
===American debutante balls===
The United States inherited its debutante traditions from the United Kingdom. George Washington, the first president of the newly independent country, held debutante presentations in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. These events continued for Washington elites into the 20th century. In the Roaring Twenties, the more democratic tradition of the high school prom became popular, which is a dance where attendance is open to everyone, not merely high-status families.

Today, a cotillion or debutante ball in the United States is a formal presentation of young women, debutantes, to &quot;polite society&quot;, typically hosted by a charity or society. Those introduced can vary from the ages of 16 to 18 (younger ages are more typical of Southern regions, while older are more commonplace in the North). In some areas, 15- and 16-year-olds are called &quot;junior debutantes&quot;. Some families hold parties for their daughters alone; these &quot;debutante parties&quot; or &quot;coming-out parties&quot; might be combined with those for a small number of girls. The events are sometimes known as debutante cotillion balls and are held for middle schoolers as a chance to teach manners.

One of the most prestigious, most exclusive, and most expensive debutante balls in the world is the invitation-only International Debutante Ball held annually at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City, where girls from prominent world families are presented to high society. The International Debutante Ball has presented princesses, countesses, baronesses and many European royalty and aristocrats as debutantes to high society, including Princess Katarina of Yugoslavia, Vanessa von Bismarck (great-great-granddaughter of Otto von Bismarck), Princess Natalya Elisabeth Davidovna Obolensky (granddaughter of the Prince Ivan Obolensky, who was the Chairman of the International Debutante Ball and himself the grandson of John Jacob Astor IV – founder of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel), Princess Ines de Bourbon Parme, Countess Magdalena Habsburg-Lothringen (great-great-granddaughter of Empress Elisabeth &quot;Sisi&quot; of Austria) and Lady Henrietta Seymour (daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Somerset).

Daughters and granddaughters of billionaire businessmen, high-ranking politicians, such as United States presidents, senators and congressmen, and ambassadors have also been presented at the International Debutante Ball; for example, Tricia Nixon, Julie Nixon, Jennie Eisenhower, Ashley Walker Bush (granddaughter of President George H. W. Bush and niece of President George W. Bush), Lucinda Robb (granddaughter of President Lyndon B. Johnson), Christine Colby (daughter of CIA director William Colby), Hollister Knowlton, Charlotte and Catherine Forbes (granddaughters of Malcolm Forbes), and Christina Huffington (daughter of Arianna Huffington of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;). Ivanka Trump (daughter of Donald Trump) was invited but chose not to attend.

To gain admission to a debutante ball, debutantes must usually be recommended by a distinguished committee or sponsored by an established member of élite society, typically their mothers or other female relatives. Wearing white gowns and satin or kid long gloves, the debutantes stand in a receiving line, and are introduced individually to the audience. After the debutante is announced, she is walked around the stage, guided by her father who presents her. Her younger male escort joins her and escorts her to make way for the next. Each debutante brings at least one escort, sometimes two.

Many debutante balls select escorts and pair them with the debs to promote good social pairings. Cotillions may be elaborate formal affairs and involve not only &quot;debs&quot; but also junior debutantes, escorts and ushers, and flower girls and pages. Every debutante must perform a curtsy, also known as the St. James Bow or a full court bow to the attendees. The exception are Texas debutantes who are presented at the International Debutante Ball at New York City&#x27;s Waldorf Astoria Hotel, who perform the &quot;Texas Dip&quot;. This gesture is made as the young woman is formally presented. Debutante balls exist in nearly every major city in the United States. They occur more frequently and are larger affairs in the American South.

The Savannah Cotillion Club&#x27;s Christmas Cotillion in Savannah, Georgia, first held in 1817, is the oldest debutante ball in the United States. Many cities such as Dallas and Atlanta have several balls in a season. Dallas, for example, has a ball sponsored by the traditional Idlewild organization. Some balls sponsored by modern organizations, such as the Dallas Symphony Orchestra Presentation Ball and La Fiesta de las Seis Banderas, raise money to benefit charities.

The National Cotillion and Thanksgiving Ball of Washington, DC., hosted by Mary-Stuart Montague Price, has met every November for over 60 years with proceeds going to Children&#x27;s Hospital. Debutantes can formally participate in the ball for up to three years, wearing different colors each time to express their increasing sophistication: debutantes wear white, post-debutantes wear black, and the post-post debutantes wear red.

Another &quot;Old South&quot; debutante ball is the St. Cecilia Society Ball held annually in Charleston, South Carolina. This ball is described in Alexandra Ripley&#x27;s novel, &quot;Scarlett&quot;, the sequel to Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;. The Society was formed in 1766 as a private subscription concert organization. Over the next fifty-four years, its annual concert series formed the most sophisticated musical phenomenon in North America. Its musical patronage ended in 1820. Today the St. Cecilia Society flourishes is one of South Carolina&#x27;s oldest and most exclusive social institutions. Today the St. Cecilia Society hosts the annual debutante ball. The society admits only those men whose fathers or brothers are members. The women must be from these families. In New Orleans, Louisiana, a debutante is usually presented at a ball during the Carnival season. Other southern debutante balls include the North Carolina Debutante Ball in North Carolina and the Bal du Bois and Richmond German Christmas Dance in Virginia.

In New York City, there are still several deb balls, including the international one described above. Charity and social balls include the Infirmary (benefits the local hospital), the Society of Mayflower Descendants Ball, and the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York Ball (founded 1835). As an alternative to a ball, and more frequent in the North, a young woman&#x27;s family might hold a &quot;coming-out party&quot; for her.

Unlike the formal balls, which are held during the social season in spring or summer, the individual &quot;coming-out party&quot; may be held at any time of the year. Some are scheduled around such occasions as the debutante&#x27;s birthday, or graduation from high school or university. In theory, the only women who could be invited would be those who had already made their débuts, thus affording a sort of rank-order to the debutante season. &quot;Old-money&quot; families often send their preteen sons and daughters to dancing classes, called cotillion, and etiquette lessons in preparation for these parties, which launch their children into society and act as major networking events. Even less grand debutante balls typically require debs to attend a few lessons in social dance, comportment, and in executing their curtsy.

Since the early 20th century, the African-American community organized its own tradition of social organizations, some of which sponsor similar charitable events and activities. They hold their own cotillions and debutante balls for their upper classes. Successful African Americans could meet and make connections with others of their status at such events, and make social, political and economic connections for the young women and men in their families. These formal cotillion and debutante balls still thrive as among the most traditional events of the African-American upper class. An example is Les Femmes Douze, founded in 1964 in Las Vegas.

Various Ukrainian émigré organizations in the United States, such as the Ukrainian American Medical Association of North America, the Ukrainian Engineers&#x27; Society of America, Plast Ukrainian Scouting Organization, and the Ukrainian American Youth Association have hosted annual black-tie debutante balls since after the Second World War. They are used to raise funds for charities and to introduce young Ukrainian ladies between the ages of 16 and 18 to their local ethnic Ukrainian communities. Ukrainian American debutante balls take place in American cities with substantial populations of Ukrainians, such as Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Newark, and Washington D.C. Beside the traditional waltz of the debutantes, one of the highlights of these balls is the Kolomyjka, which usually takes place past midnight. Every guest may spontaneously demonstrate their skills in Ukrainian dances, such as the Hopak or Arkan. Kolomyjka dances tend to last upwards of a half-hour of nonstop folk dancing. Afterward traditional black-tie ball dances are revived.

The dress code is white tie and tails for men, and strictly floor-length pure white ball gown for women. Long white gloves are commonly worn by female debutantes and are considered a symbol of upper-class femininity.

===Debutante balls in U.S. television and films===
Several television series focused on young people from wealthy families include episodes with debutante events. &quot;The Debut,&quot; an episode of &quot;The O.C.&quot; (a drama about wealthy Californians), featured a representation of an American debutante ball. &quot;Hi, Society,&quot; (season 1, episode 10), &quot;They Shoot Humphreys, Don&#x27;t They?,&quot; (season 3, episode 9), &quot;Riding in Town Cars with Boys (season 5, episode 10), and &quot;Monstrous Ball&quot; (season 6, episode 5) of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, also from &quot;The O.C.&quot; creator Josh Schwartz, features a debutante ball in New York City. &quot;Presenting Lorelai Gilmore&quot;, an episode of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; shows Rory Gilmore as a debutante. She makes her debut at a Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) debutante ball that her grandmother helped put together. In &quot;The Critic&quot;, Jay Sherman&#x27;s younger sister Margo is persuaded to attend her debutante ball. In &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;, the titular character&#x27;s mother, Beatrice, is shown attending her debutante ball as a young adult through flashbacks in the season 4 episode &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow&quot;.

In the premiere of &quot;The City&quot;, Whitney Port&#x27;s reality show, her co-worker Olivia Palermo describes her first pair of Manolo Blahnik shoes, which she wore to her &quot;Deb&quot; at the age of 18. The first season of &quot;The Summer I Turned Pretty (TV series)&quot; revolves around the town&#x27;s annual debutante ball, a plot that was not present in the book series it was based on.

Crime dramas have investigated début-related crimes. &quot;Zoo York,&quot; an episode of &quot;&quot;, featured the CSI team investigating the murder of a debutante. Medical examiner Evan Zao says that he had attended a debutante ball. &quot;Debut&quot;, an episode of &quot;Cold Case&quot;, tells the story of a young girl who is murdered the night of her debutante ball. In an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, entitled &quot;Streetwise&quot;, detectives investigated the rape and murder of a debutante.

Films with debutante themes include &quot;Metropolitan&quot; (1990), Whit Stillman&#x27;s feature film, a comedy of manners set during the deb season in Manhattan, and &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; (2003), in which Amanda Bynes plays an American teen whose estranged father is a British lord, and who is presented at a coming-out party. Bynes is also featured in &quot;She&#x27;s The Man&quot;, in which the main character attends a debutantes preparation program and finally a ball. &quot;Something New&quot;, a romantic comedy, has a scene of upper-class African Americans at a cotillion on the West Coast. &quot;The Debut&quot; (2001), a film on contemporary Filipino-American life, explores a wide variety of cultural themes through an informal debutante event.

The 1991 film &quot;The Addams Family&quot; is centered on the reconciliation of Gomez and Fester Addams. They had a falling out as teenagers at a debutante ball. In the film &quot;Little Women&quot; (1994), a &quot;coming-out&quot; party is given. Aunt March talks to Marmee about when Meg will be introduced into society.

&quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot; (2020) includes a scene at a debutante ball at Johnston–Felton–Hay House in Macon, Georgia.

==Latin America==
In Mexico, Dominican Republic, Panama, Puerto Rico and Paraguay, debutantes are young girls who take part in a &quot;Festival de Debutantes&quot;, or a &quot;Quince Años&quot;, held for their fifteenth birthdays. &quot;Quinceañera&quot; parties are also held in the United States among Latino communities from these nations.

In Brazil and Mexico, such events are called &quot;Baile de Debutante&quot; (Spanish and Portuguese) or &quot;Festa de Debutante&quot; (only Portuguese), or &quot;Quince Años&quot; (Spanish) or &quot;Quinze Anos&quot; (Portuguese).

In Panama, the Debutante Ball is organized by Damas Guadalupanas. It is a charity event held at Club Union. It takes place when girls are seniors in high school (17–18 years old). This follows the Quince Años, which takes place when they are 15.

<text>Lunar Orbiter 5, the last of the &quot;Lunar Orbiter series&quot;, was designed to take additional Apollo and Surveyor landing site photography and to take broad survey images of unphotographed parts of the Moon&#x27;s far side. It was also equipped to collect selenodetic, radiation intensity, and micrometeoroid impact data and was used to evaluate the Manned Space Flight Network tracking stations and Apollo Orbit Determination Program.

==Mission summary==
The spacecraft was placed in a cislunar trajectory and on August 5, 1967 was injected into an elliptical near polar lunar orbit with an inclination of 85 degrees and a period of 8 hours 30 minutes. On August 7 the perilune was lowered to , and on August 9 the orbit was lowered to a , 3 hour 11 minute period.

The spacecraft acquired photographic data from August 6 to 18, 1967, and readout occurred until August 27, 1967. A total of 633 high resolution and 211 medium resolution frames at resolution down to were acquired, bringing the cumulative photographic coverage by the five Lunar Orbiter craft to 99% of the Moon&#x27;s surface. Accurate data were acquired from all other experiments throughout the mission. The spacecraft was tracked until it struck the lunar surface on command at 2.79 degrees S latitude, 83 degrees W longitude (selenographic coordinates) on January 31, 1968.

Features on the near side of the Moon that were photographic targets included Petavius, Hyginus, Messier, Tycho, Copernicus, Gassendi, Vitello, Mons Gruithuisen Gamma, Prinz, Aristarchus, Vallis Schroteri, Marius Hills, Montes Apenninus, Rimae Plato, Sinus Aestuum, Hipparchus, Rimae Sulpicius Gallus, Rimae Calippus, Censorinus, Dionysius, and the future landing site of Apollo 11.

<doc id="885972" wikidata="Q61954719" url="?curid=885972" title="Bacitracin">
<text>Bacitracin is a polypeptide antibiotic. It is a mixture of related cyclic peptides produced by &quot;Bacillus licheniformis&quot; bacteria, that was first isolated from the variety &quot;Tracy I&quot; (ATCC 10716) in 1945. These peptides disrupt Gram-positive bacteria by interfering with cell wall and peptidoglycan synthesis.

Bacitracin is primarily used as a topical preparation, as it can cause kidney damage when used internally. It is generally safe when used topically, but in rare cases may cause hypersensitivity, allergic or anaphylactic reactions, especially in people allergic to neomycin.

In 2022, it was the 323rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 100,000 prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
 Bacitracin is used in human medicine as a polypeptide antibiotic and is &quot;approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in chickens and turkeys,&quot; though use in animals contributes to antibiotic resistance.

As bacitracin zinc salt, in combination with other topical antibiotics (usually polymyxin B and neomycin) as an ointment (&quot;triple antibiotic ointment,&quot; with the brand name Neosporin), it is used for topical treatment of a variety of localized skin and eye infections, as well as for the prevention of wound infections. A non-ointment form of ophthalmic solution is also available for eye infections.

=== Spectrum of activity and susceptibility data ===
Bacitracin is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic. It targets Gram-positive bacteria, especially those that cause skin infections. The following represents susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms.

* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; – ≤0.03 μg/mL – 700 μg/mL
* &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot; – 0.25 μg/mL – &gt;16 μg/mL
* &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; – 0.5 μg/mL – &gt;16 μg/mL

== Mechanism of action ==

Bacitracin interferes with the dephosphorylation of C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate, and a related molecule known as bactoprenol pyrophosphate; both of these lipids function as membrane carrier molecules that transport the building-blocks of the peptidoglycan bacterial cell wall outside of the inner membrane.

== History ==
Bacitracin was isolated by Balbina Johnson, a bacteriologist at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. Its name derives from the fact that a compound produced by a microbe in young Margaret Tracy&#x27;s (1936–1994) leg injury showed antibacterial activity.

&quot;One strain isolated from tissue debrided from a compound fracture of the tibia was particularly active. We named this growth-antagonistic strain for the patient, &quot;Tracy I.&quot; When cell-free filtrates of broth cultures of this bacillus proved to possess strong antibiotic activity and to be non-toxic, further study seemed warranted. We have called this active principle &quot;Bacitracin.&quot;

Bacitracin was approved by the US FDA in 1948.

== Synthesis ==
Bacitracin is synthesised via nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), which means that ribosomes are not directly involved in its synthesis. The three-enzyme operon is called BacABC, not to be confused with BacABCDE of bacilycin synthesis.

== Composition ==
Bacitracin is composed of a mixture of related compounds with varying degrees of antibacterial activity. Notable fractions include bacitracin A, A1, B, B1, B2, C, D, E, F, G, and X. Bacitracin A has been found to have the most antibacterial activity. Bacitracin B1 and B2 have similar potencies and are approximately 90% as active as bacitracin A.

== Society and culture ==
=== Controversies ===
Claims that bacitracin is a protein disulfide isomerase inhibitor are disputed by &quot;in vitro&quot; studies.

<text>Stephen Frederick Eustace Frost (born 28 December 1955) is an English actor and comedian, best known for his work on &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; as well as several projects with comedy partner Mark Arden.

==Early life==
Frost was born in Redruth, Cornwall, and is the son of the abstract artist Terry Frost and brother of painter Anthony Frost.

He joined Banbury School (now Wykham Park Academy) in north Oxfordshire, part of Stanbridge Hall, in September 1967. The school had become comprehensive that term, but only in name; the buildings largely remained. The school transitioned over years. He played rugby for his county at age 16, and badminton locally, and athletics, in the AAA five star scheme. His brother Simon was also athletic. He took part in many school drama productions, in the sixth form, with his brothers Simon and Matthew. In the sixth form he grew a beard, and worked with the National Youth Theatre. He won a playwright award from the Royal Court Theatre. The head of the school drama group was Brian Derbyshire; the teacher left the school at the same time as Stephen, in July 1974.

He passed two O-levels, Geography and Physics. He passed one A level, Geography. His headteacher was Harry Judge. He lived at 2 Old Parr Road from 1963 to 1974. In 1974 family moved to Newlyn in Cornwall. He attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama with Art Malik (and his wife Gina Rowe), Mark Arden and actors Jeremy Gittins and Robert McCulley.

==Career==
===Work with Mark Arden===
Frost is known for his work in the 1980s with Mark Arden as part of the double act The Oblivion Boys on &quot;Saturday Live&quot;. Veterans of the alternative comedy scene, he and Arden appeared in &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, and later had their own TV series &quot;Lazarus and Dingwall&quot; on BBC2. They played the lead roles in the 1987 revival of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play, &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; at the Piccadilly Theatre. They also played two robbers in &#x27;Big Deal&#x27; series 2, in the episode &#x27;Popping Across The Pond&#x27;.

In 1994 the Oblivion Boys starred opposite the comedy duo Raw Sex (Simon Brint and Rowland Rivron) in the partially-improvised comedy film &quot;There&#x27;s No Business...&quot;.

The duo appeared in a series of British TV advertisements ending with the catchphrase &quot;I bet he drinks Carling Black Label&quot;. One spoofed the &quot;launderette&quot; commercial for Levi&#x27;s in which Nick Kamen stripped to his underwear; in their pastiche, Arden and Frost played launderette customers who were stripped entirely, with just strategically placed books maintaining their modesty.

===Solo work===
Without Arden, Frost has appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, and the improvisation show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;. He has appeared on three episodes of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; (there was a 13-year gap between his second and third appearance) and on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. He also appeared as Dirk in Tony Bagley&#x27;s series &quot;Married&quot;.

He played two small roles in &quot;Blackadder&quot;: a prison guard in the first-series episode &quot;Witchsmeller Pursuivant&quot;, and the overly cheerful head of a firing squad in the episode &quot;Corporal Punishment&quot; of &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;. He also appeared in the comedy series &quot;Mr. Bean&quot;, starring Rowan Atkinson, in the episode entitled &quot;Mr. Bean Rides Again&quot; in one of the skits where Mr. Bean is on a train.

In 2003 he appeared in a production of &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; alongside Bill Bailey.

Frost appeared alongside Tony Hawks and Angus Deayton in the 2012 feature film &quot;Playing the Moldovans at Tennis&quot;.

===Currently===
Frost is a regular on the London comedy circuit. He is also a veteran of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and Glastonbury Festival.

Frost still appears regularly with The Comedy Store Players in The Comedy Store, London.

<text>U.S. Route 15 or U.S. Highway 15 (US 15) is a United States Numbered Highway, serving the states of South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York. The route is signed north–south, from US 17 Alternate (US 17 Alt.) in Walterboro, South Carolina, north to Interstate 86 (I-86)/New York State Route 17 (NY 17) in Corning, New York.

US 15 is one of the original U.S. Highways from 1926.

===South Carolina===

Starting at US 17 Alt. in Walterboro, US 15 goes east, running parallel to I-95 and across I-26. Then it turns north and crosses I-95. Just before the town of Santee, US 15 converges with US 301. In Santee, the two highways merge with I-95 at exit 98 and all three cross Lake Marion. At exit 102, US 15/US 301 split off from I-95 and go into the town of Summerton. US 15 then separates from US 301 and heads mainly north to city of Sumter. From there, it continues north, crosses I-20, and goes through the cities of Bishopville and Hartsville to the town of Society Hill. It is here that US 401 joins US 15 and both go to the North Carolina border.

===North Carolina===
US 15/US 401 continues to Laurinburg, at which US 401 splits off and US 15 runs concurrent with US 501. US 1 briefly merges with US 15/US 501 through Aberdeen and Sanford. The route continues north of Sanford with North Carolina Highway 87 toward Pittsboro. Past Pittsboro, US 15/US 501 goes toward Chapel Hill and skirts around the southeastern edge of the city and then across I-40 to Durham. (Prior to the construction of the Chapel Hill bypass, US 15 ran through Chapel Hill, and, as of 2018, there is a &quot;Jefferson Davis Highway&quot; marker on Franklin Street, Chapel Hill&#x27;s main street.) Here, US 15 Business (US 15 Bus.)/US 501 Bus. split from US 15/US 501. Before the business routes rejoin on the other side of Durham, I-85 merges into US 15 Bus. Then, I-85/US 15 go north. Right after crossing Falls Lake at exit 186, US 15 splits off to the east. US 15 runs parallel to I-85, going through the city of Creedmoor. It then crosses back over I-85, goes through the city of Oxford, on through Bullock, and then to the North Carolina–Virginia state line.

Virginia&#x27;s section of US 15 starts in Mecklenburg County. Not far from the state line, it crosses a narrow finger of Kerr Lake. The highway goes through the town of Clarksville and merges very briefly with US 58/State Route 49 (SR 49) and then crosses over the main body of Kerr Lake. US 15 continues a little ways and merges with US 360. The two highways go on to the town of Keysville. After Keysville, US 15 branches off and goes to the town of Farmville. After a brief merge with US 460, US 15 goes through the towns of Dillwyn, New Canton (on the James River), Fork Union, and Palmyra before crossing I-64 at Zion Crossroads. After passing the Interstate, US 15 goes through the towns of Gordonsville (with a quick merge with US 33) and Orange, and then on to Culpeper. After Culpeper, US 15 runs concurrent with US 29. In Warrenton, they briefly merge with US 17. South of Gainesville, US 15 breaks off and crosses I-66. From there, it goes on to Leesburg and then to the state line.

===Maryland===

US 15 starts in Maryland at Point of Rocks, crossing the Potomac River and then merges into US 340 just south of Frederick. In Frederick, US 40 merges with US 15 for a very short distance. From there, US 15 goes through Thurmont and on to the Maryland–Pennsylvania border.

===Pennsylvania and New York===


US 15 enters Pennsylvania south of Gettysburg. US 15 Bus. (Emmitsburg Road) goes through Gettysburg, while US 15 bypasses the borough; the bypass continues to York Springs. US 15 passes through Dillsburg before becoming a freeway near Grantham and the Messiah University campus.

US 15 continues as a freeway until it intersects US 11 and Pennsylvania Route 581 in Camp Hill. US 15 runs concurrent with US 11, passing Harrisburg on the west shore of the Susquehanna River. The concurrency ends at Shamokin Dam, where US 11 splits and follows the North Branch Susquehanna River, and US 15 follows the West Branch Susquehanna River north toward Williamsport where it passes through Lewisburg and the campus of Bucknell University (which is partially bisected by the highway). In the future, US 15 and US 11 will diverge in Selinsgrove, from which US 15 will proceed north on a road currently under construction and connect back to its current alignment near Winfield. US 11 will be joined to a business loop of US 15 instead of the main route.

The segment from Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to the northern terminus at I-86 and NY 17 in Painted Post, New York, has been completely upgraded to Interstate standards, except for one access road at milemarker 150.1, in preparation for the eventual transition to designation as I-99, as has the US 15/I-86 interchange. The segment of US 15 in New York runs parallel to the Tioga River from the state line to its current northern terminus at I-86 and NY 17 exit 44 at the junction of the Tioga and Cohocton rivers in Painted Post, west of downtown Corning. The entire length of US 15 in New York is signed concurrently with I-99.

==History==
Until 1974, US 15 continued north of NY 17 and entered Painted Post on North Hamilton Street. At what is now the junction of County Route 41 and NY 415 in downtown Painted Post, US 15 turned north onto NY 415. At the northern terminus of NY 415, located at NY 15 and NY 21 south of Wayland, US 15 followed the current routing of NY 15 into downtown Rochester, where it terminated at NY 31.

US 15 has shed considerable length in near-continuous realignment and regrading over the years. Prior to the completion of the Tioga Creek flood-control project, hastened by the flooding caused after Hurricane Agnes along the Pennsylvania and New York segments of US 15 in June 1972, US 15 passed through many small towns in Pennsylvania as it passed from Lawrenceville, at the New York border, to West Milton, where the road begins to follow the west bank of the Susquehanna River. Originally a winding two-lane road over numerous mountains, US 15 now bypasses many small towns such as Sebring, Blossburg, Covington, Canoe Camp, and Hepburnville. In the 1970s, the challenging two-lane alignment was expanded in some areas to four lanes by building a second set of lanes. Now, for some stretches, the &quot;old&quot; road is the northbound side and in other sections, the southbound side.
Near Mansfield, Pennsylvania, the old US 15 alignment is now a access road leading to a boat ramp, built where the old road now disappears into the Tioga Reservoir. Near Tioga, Pennsylvania, drivers crossing the tall concrete bridge can see where a two-lane road (formerly US 15), still marked with double yellow lines, disappears into the water.

==Scenic Byway==
In October 2009, a portion of US 15 from Charlottesville, Virginia, to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, was designated a National Scenic Byway by the U.S. secretary of transportation. The byway will be known as the Journey Through Hallowed Ground. With this designation, the route and historic sites along the route are now eligible for preservation grants.

<doc id="886000" wikidata="Q7095717" url="?curid=886000" title="Open-question argument">
<text>The open-question argument is a philosophical argument put forward by British philosopher G. E. Moore in §13 of &quot;Principia Ethica&quot; (1903), to refute the equating of the property of goodness with some non-moral property, X, whether natural (e.g. pleasure) or supernatural (e.g. God&#x27;s command). That is, Moore&#x27;s argument attempts to show that no moral property is identical to a natural property. The argument takes the form of a syllogism modus tollens:

: Premise 1: If X is good by definition, then the question &quot;Is it true that &quot;X&quot; is good?&quot; is meaningless.

: Premise 2: The question &quot;Is it true that &quot;X&quot; is good?&quot; is not meaningless (i.e. it is an open question).

: Conclusion: X is not (analytically equivalent to) good.

The type of question Moore refers to in this argument is an identity question, &quot;Is it true that X is &quot;Y&quot;?&quot; Such a question is an &quot;open question&quot; if it can be asked by a person who knows what the words mean; otherwise it is &quot;closed.&quot; For example, &quot;I know he is a vegan, but does he eat meat?&quot; would be a closed question. However, &quot;I know that it is pleasurable, but is it good?&quot; is an open question; the answer cannot be derived from the meaning of the terms alone.

The open-question argument claims that any attempt to identify morality with some set of observable, natural properties will always be liable to an open question, and if so, then moral facts cannot be reduced to natural properties and that therefore ethical naturalism is false. Put another way, Moore is saying that any definition of good in terms of a natural property will be invalid because to question it would be to ask a closed question, since the two terms mean the same thing; however, an open question can always be asked about any such attempted definition, it can always be questioned whether good is the same thing as pleasure, etc. Shortly before (in section §11), Moore had said if good is defined as pleasure, or any other natural property, &quot;good&quot; may be substituted for &quot;pleasure&quot;, or that other property, anywhere where it occurs. However, &quot;pleasure is good&quot; is a meaningful, informative statement; but &quot;good is good&quot; (after making the substitution) is a mere uninformative tautology.

==Objections and rejoinders==

===Begging the question===

The idea that Moore begs the question (i.e. assumes the conclusion in a premise) was first raised by William Frankena. Since analytic equivalency, for two objects X and Y, logically results in the question &quot;Is it true that X is Y?&quot; being meaningless (by Moore&#x27;s own argument), to say that the question is meaningless is to concede analytic equivalency. Thus Moore begs the question in the second premise. He assumes that the question is a meaningful one (i.e. that it is an open question). This begs the question and the open-question argument thus fails.

In response to this, the open-question argument can be reformulated. The Darwall-Gibbard-Railton reformulation argues for the impossibility of equating a moral property with a non-moral one using the internalist theory of motivation. Goodness, on this account, is the property which ideally gives rise to certain internal states (motivations, sentiments, desires to act), but is not, itself, equivalent to those states.

The internalist, or Humean, theory of motivation (belief–desire–intention model) is the view that if one has a reason to act, one must have some desire which would be fulfilled by that act, compared to the externalist theory of motivation, which holds that we may have reasons to act absent any accompanying desire. According to internalism, moral motivation comes from the (global) benefit or utility of moral sentiments or actions. On the other hand, externalism holds that moral properties give us reasons for acting independent of desire or utility. If internalism is true, then the OQA may avoid begging the question against the naturalist by claiming that the moral properties and the motivations to act belong to different categories, and therefore, necessarily are not analytically equivalent. That is, it remains an open question whether the properties which do give rise to certain sentiments &quot;ought&quot; to guide our actions in that way. To argue for the special motivational effects of moral beliefs is to commit the fallacy of special pleading.

===Meaningful analysis===

The main assumption within the open-question argument can be found within premise 1. It is assumed that analytic equivalency will result in meaningless analysis. Thus, if we understand Concept C, and Concept C* can be analysed in terms of Concept C, then we should grasp concept C* by virtue of our understanding of Concept C. Yet it is obvious that such understanding of Concept C* only comes about through the analysis proper. Mathematics would be the prime example: mathematics is tautological and its claims are true by definition, yet we can develop new mathematical conceptions and theorems. Thus, X (i.e. some non-moral property) might well be analytically equivalent to the good, and still the question of &quot;Is &quot;X&quot; good?&quot; can be meaningful. Ergo premise 1 does not hold and the argument falls.

===Frege sense–reference distinction===
Sense and reference are two different aspects of some terms&#x27; meanings. A term&#x27;s &quot;reference&quot; is the &quot;object&quot; to which the term refers, while the term&#x27;s &quot;sense&quot; is the &quot;way&quot; that the term refers to that object.

There is a difference between the sense of a term and its reference (i.e. the object itself). Thus, we can understand a claim like &quot;goodness is identical with pleasure&quot; as an &quot;a posteriori&quot; identity claim similar to &quot;Water is H2O&quot;. The question &quot;This is H2O but is it water?&quot; is intelligible and so, in that limited sense, whether or not water is H2O is an open question; note that this does not address the issue of significance. But that does not lead us to conclude that water is not H2O. &quot;Water is H2O&quot; is an identity claim that is known to be true &quot;a posteriori&quot; (i.e., it was discovered via empirical investigation). Another example is &quot;redness&quot; being identical to certain phenomena of electromagnetism. This is discovered by empirical investigation. Similarly, many moral naturalists argue that &quot;rightness&quot; can be discovered as an &quot;a posteriori&quot; truth, by investigating the different claims, like that of pleasure being the good, or of duty being the good.

This is done by invoking rightness and wrongness to explain certain empirical phenomena, and then discovering &quot;a posteriori&quot; whether maximizing utility occupies the relevant explanatory role. For example, they argue that since right actions contingently have certain effects e.g. being causally responsible for a tendency towards social stability—so it follows we can fix the term &quot;right&quot; refer to the empirical description &quot;the property of acts, whatever it is, that is causally responsible for their tendency towards social stability.&quot; With this description for &quot;right,&quot; we can then investigate which acts accomplish this: e.g. those actions that maximize utility. We can then conclude that we have learned that &quot;right&quot; refers to &quot;maximizing utility&quot; through &quot;a posteriori&quot; means.

The Frege sense–reference distinction can be understood in layman&#x27;s terms by using the analogy of the Masked Man. A citizen living on the frontiers of the Wild West is told by the sheriff that his brother is the Masked Man who has recently been robbing banks. The citizen protests that he understands who his brother is, and who the Masked Man is supposed to be, and can meaningfully ask, &quot;Is my brother the Masked Man?&quot; Obviously, analytic equivalency is of no relevance here. The matter is an empirical one, which the citizen must investigate a posteriori. The absurdity of dismissing the claim as such is apparent.

== Solutions to the Paradox of Analysis ==

=== The Linguistic Solution ===
The linguistic solution proposed by Max Black states that a in fact can equal b and be informative because the information you gain from a definition is which expressions pick out the same concept. For example, saying that someone is a bachelor is equivalent to saying that the person can be equally well described by the phrase &quot;an unmarried man&quot;. Even though the two expressions mean the same thing, what we have learned is that the combination of letters that make up the word &quot;bachelor&quot; picks out the same concept as the particular combination of spaces and letters as &quot;an unmarried man&quot;. Similarly consider the math example of 3x7=21 and 1x21=21. It is certainly true that &quot;3x7&quot; and &quot;1x21&quot; pick out the same number and as a result, would not say that no information was gained by saying 3x7=1x21. We would not say this because we have learned that the expression &quot;3x7&quot; picks out the same number as the expression &quot;1x21&quot;. Overall, this solution aims to say that we do gain knowledge from definitions, but that knowledge is linguistic.

=== The &quot;Explicit Knowledge&quot; Solution ===
The &quot;explicit knowledge&quot; solution comes from philosophers Mark Balaguer and Terry Horgan. The goal of the &quot;explicit knowledge&quot; solution is to say that a good analysis will take someone from being able to implicitly apply the concept correctly, to being able to explicitly explain and know why their application is correct. The information we gain then, is how to make explicit what we before only knew implicitly. Take a circle for example. Most children and adults if you ask them to pick which things are circles would be able to. However, if you ask them what the definition of a circle is, most people will struggle. The definition of a circle is &quot;a plane figure bounded by one curved line, and such that all straight lines drawn from a certain point within it to the bounding line, are equal. The bounding line is called its circumference and the point, its centre.&quot; To someone who knows implicitly what a circle is, upon hearing this definition will say, &quot;of course&quot; or &quot;that makes sense&quot; because they had the implicit knowledge. All the definition, or analysis, did, was to make explicit what the children and adults already implicitly knew about the concept of &quot;circle&quot;. Therefore, the solution says that an analysis is informative because it creates explicit knowledge to those who only had implicit knowledge of the concept prior to knowing the definition.

<doc id="886010" wikidata="Q7755676" url="?curid=886010" title="The Outlets at Orange">
<text>The Outlets at Orange (former names The Block at Orange and The City Shopping Center) is an open-air outlet mall in the city of Orange, California, in northern Orange County developed by The Mills Corporation and now owned by Simon Property Group. The anchor stores in this outlet are Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s, Guitar Center, AMC Theatres, Neiman Marcus Last Call, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom Rack, Gap, and Bloomingdale&#x27;s.

== History ==
===The City===
From 1970 to 1996, the site was home to an enclosed mall called The City Shopping Center, featuring anchor stores J. C. Penney and San Diego–based Walker Scott, which would in 1974 become a May Co. branch. It targeted middle income residents, office workers and visitors to nearby Disneyland. The City Shopping Center was the centerpiece of The City, an edge city mixed-use development; in or just outside the mall were two hotels, several office buildings, two movie theaters (City Center Theatres and UA the Movies), gym, three full-service restaurants and a pizzeria, Pepperoni square (owned by Larrys Pizza in Fullerton) which was sold and became Clubhouse Pizza: Sports and Games, a foreign currency exchange and a post office. The roads around the mall had &quot;City&quot; in their names because they were built as part of that complex.

Only two miles away, the small Santa Ana Fashion Square mall was renamed MainPlace/Santa Ana and vastly expanded, growing from one department store anchor (Bullock&#x27;s) to three in September 1987 and business at The City started declining rapidly by the start of the 1990s. May Company opened a new store at MainPlace in May 1991 and closed its store at The City in July of that year. JCPenney, The City&#x27;s other major anchor, closed in February 1995. The mall was closed and demolished in late 1996.

===Block at Orange===
Mills purchased the site, originally considering converting the City mall to one of their Mills malls named &quot;City Mills,&quot; but instead built an outdoor lifestyle center with outlets, restaurants, and entertainment facilities most likely because there was another Mills mall in Southern California (Ontario Mills) already under development. The center&#x27;s old slogan was &quot;The Block at Orange... It Ain&#x27;t Square.&quot; It was The Mills Corporation&#x27;s first outdoor mall not to have the &quot;Mills&quot; name. The Block officially opened in November 1998.

Ron Jon Surf Shop closed in 2008 and was replaced by Neiman Marcus Last Call. Virgin Megastore, Hilo Hattie and Steve &amp; Barry&#x27;s closed in 2009. These anchors were replaced with Off Broadway Shoes, H&amp;M, Thrill It Fun Center and Guitar Center. Borders closed in 2011 due to the chain&#x27;s liquidation, and was replaced by Sports Authority, but Sports Authority at the mall was liquidated along with the rest of the company&#x27;s stores starting May 18, 2016, due to Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. Furniture &amp; Beyond briefly occupied the former Sports Authority space but closed less than a year later. The mall has one of the few remaining Vans Skate Parks in the country, as most of the other skateparks closed or were sold to another brand in the early 2000s.

Like other Mills properties, The Block at Orange was acquired by the Simon Property Group in 2007.

===Outlets at Orange===
In 2011, &quot;The Block at Orange&quot; was renamed &quot;The Outlets at Orange&quot;.

The Outlets at Orange underwent two phases of expansion on the east side of the mall. The first phase included a new Nordstrom Rack store which was completed in 2013. The second phase was completed in 2016 which included five new stores such as Gap Factory Store, Polo Ralph Lauren, and Orange County&#x27;s first Bloomingdale&#x27;s Outlet. The second phase was supposed to bring 12 new stores but only 5 came because stores such as Bloomingdale&#x27;s wanted larger spaces.

Outlets at Orange was, for a long time, the only outlet mall in Orange County with the next nearest outlet malls being Citadel Outlets in Commerce, 23 miles away near Central Los Angeles. The Outlets at San Clemente opened in 2015, and though nine miles further away than Citadel, provided more significant competition as it took away Orange&#x27;s status as the only outlet mall in Orange County.

The former Virgin Megastore was featured in &quot;Borat&quot; where Borat attempts to kidnap Pamela Anderson.

<doc id="886011" wikidata="Q1995396" url="?curid=886011" title="Marc'Antonio Ingegneri">
<text>Marc&#x27;Antonio Ingegneri (also spelled Ingegnieri, Ingignieri, Ingignero, Inzegneri) (c. 1535 or 1536 – 1 July 1592) was an Italian composer of the late Renaissance. He was born in Verona and died in Cremona. Even though he spent most of his life working in northern Italy, because of his stylistic similarity to Palestrina he is often considered to be a member of the Roman School of polyphonic church music. He is also famous as the teacher of Claudio Monteverdi.

Not much is known about his early life, but he probably had family from Venice, and he likely studied with Cipriano de Rore at Parma, and Vincenzo Ruffo at Verona. Sometime around 1570 he moved to Cremona, and established a reputation there as a composer and instrumentalist. He may have been an organist, and is known to have been a string player. In 1581 he became &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of the cathedral there, and he apparently remained in this position for the rest of his life. While at this position he is known to have taught Claudio Monteverdi, who became important to the transition into the Baroque period.

Ingegneri was close friends with Bishop Nicolò Sfondrato, later Pope Gregory XIV, who was intimately involved with the reforms of the Counter-Reformation and the Council of Trent, and this influence is present in his music, which usually shows the simplification and clarity of the Palestrina style. Indeed, his book of twenty-seven &quot;Responsoria&quot; was long misattributed to Palestrina. However, some of his music quite ignores the reformist &quot;dicta&quot; of the Council; most notorious is a four-voice motet &quot;Noe noe&quot;, which is a double canon by inversion, in which it would require an exceedingly keen ear to hear the text: and intelligibility of the text was the one demand made by the Council of Trent of any composer of sacred polyphony.

His masses are simple, short, and relatively homophonic, often outdoing Palestrina for clarity and simplicity. His madrigals tend to be conservative, frankly ignoring the innovations of composers such as Luzzaschi and Marenzio who were experimenting with vivid chromaticism and word-painting around the same time.

He wrote two books of masses, in 1573 and 1587; at least three books of motets (others may have been lost); and eight books of madrigals, for four to six voices.

<doc id="886015" wikidata="Q7629435" url="?curid=886015" title="Style of the British sovereign">
<text>The precise style of the British sovereign is chosen and proclaimed by the sovereign, in accordance with the Royal Titles Act 1953. The current sovereign, King Charles III, was proclaimed by the Privy Council (on his behalf) in 2022 to have acceded to the throne with the style:

==Early history==
The Anglo-Saxon kings of England used numerous different styles, including &quot;King of the Anglo-Saxons&quot; and &quot;King of the English&quot;. Grander variations were adopted by some monarchs; for example, Eadred () used &quot;King of the Anglo-Saxons, Northumbrians, pagans and Britons&quot;. These styles were sometimes accompanied by extravagant epithets; for instance, Æthelstan () was &quot;King of the English, raised by the right hand of the Almighty to the Throne of the whole Kingdom of Britain&quot;.

In Scotland the title of the monarch was usually &quot;King/Queen of Scots&quot; rather than &quot;of Scotland&quot; (although the latter was sometimes used).

William I (), the first Norman monarch of England, used the simple &quot;King of the English&quot;. His successor, William II, was the first consistently to use &quot;by the Grace of God&quot;. Henry I added &quot;Duke of the Normans&quot; in 1121, though he had seized Normandy from his brother Robert in 1106. In 1152 Henry II acquired many further French possessions through his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine; soon thereafter, he added &quot;Duke of the Aquitanians&quot; and &quot;Count of the Angevins&quot; to his style.

&quot;King of the English&quot;, &quot;Duke of the Normans&quot;, &quot;Duke of the Aquitanians&quot; and &quot;Count of the Angevins&quot; remained in use until King John ascended the throne in 1199, when they changed to &quot;King of England&quot;, &quot;Duke of Normandy&quot;, &quot;Duke of Aquitaine&quot; and &quot;Count of Anjou&quot;, respectively. John, furthermore, was already the titular ruler of Ireland; therefore, he added &quot;Lord of Ireland&quot; to his style.

In 1204 England lost both Normandy and Anjou. Nevertheless, they did not renounce the associated titles until 1259. French territory once again became the subject of dispute after the death of the French King Charles IV in 1328. Edward III claimed the French throne, arguing that it was to pass to him through his mother Isabella, Charles IV&#x27;s sister. In France, however, it was asserted that the throne could not pass to or through a woman. Edward III began to use the title &quot;King of France&quot; (dropping &quot;Duke of Aquitaine&quot;) after 1337. In 1340 he entered France, where he was publicly proclaimed King. In 1360, however, he agreed to relinquish his title to the French claimant. Though he stopped using the title in legal documents, he did not formally exchange letters confirming the renunciation with the French King. In 1369 Edward III resumed the title, claiming that the French had breached their treaty.

Henry V invaded France, but agreed to the Treaty of Troyes, whereby he was recognised as the Heir and Regent of France, in 1420. He died in 1422, to be succeeded by his infant son, who became Henry VI. Shortly after his accession, Henry VI also inherited the French throne. By the 1450s, however, England had lost all its territories in France, with the exception of Calais. The claim to the title of &quot;King of France&quot; was nonetheless not relinquished until the creation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801, by which time the French monarchy had been overthrown by the French Revolution.

After 1422, the royal style remained unchanged for almost a century. Numerous amendments, however, were effected during Henry VIII&#x27;s reign. After Henry wrote a book against the Protestant Martin Luther, Pope Leo X rewarded him by granting the title &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;. After disagreements with the Papacy over his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Henry VIII broke away from the Roman Catholic Church, establishing the Church of England in 1533. Pope Paul III rescinded the grant of the title &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;, but Henry continued to use it. In 1535 Henry added &quot;of the Church of England in Earth, under Jesus Christ, Supreme Head&quot; to his style in 1535; a reference to the Church of Ireland was added in 1536. Meanwhile, advised that many Irish people regarded the pope as the true temporal authority in their nation, with the king of England acting as a mere representative, Henry VIII changed &quot;Lord of Ireland&quot; to &quot;King of Ireland&quot; in 1542. All changes made by Henry VIII were confirmed by an English act of Parliament passed in 1544.

Mary I, Henry VIII&#x27;s Catholic daughter, omitted &quot;of the Church of England and also of Ireland in Earth Supreme Head&quot; in 1553, replacing it with &quot;etc.&quot;, but the phrase remained part of the official style until an Act of Parliament to the contrary was passed in 1555. In the meantime Mary had married the Spanish prince Philip. The monarchs adopted a joint style, &quot;King and Queen of England and France, Naples, Jerusalem and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Princes of Spain and Sicily, Archdukes of Austria, Dukes of Milan, Burgundy and Brabant, Count and Countess of Habsburg, Flanders and Tyrol&quot;, acknowledging both Mary&#x27;s and Philip&#x27;s titles. Further changes were made after Philip became King of Spain and Sicily upon his father&#x27;s abdication.
When the Protestant Elizabeth I ascended the throne, she used the simpler &quot;Queen of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.&quot;. The &quot;etc.&quot; was added in anticipation of a restoration of the supremacy phrase, which never actually occurred.

After James VI of Scotland, ascended the English throne, the official style changed to &quot;King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.&quot;; his mother Mary, Queen of Scots, had already laid claim to these titles (in a different order, jointly with Francis II of France, then with the King&#x27;s father, Lord Darnley), but she was beheaded by her Protestant opponent, Elizabeth I. In 1604 James VI made a proclamation permitting the use of &quot;King of Great Britain&quot; instead of &quot;King of England and Scotland&quot;. This new style, though commonly used to refer to the King, was never statutory; therefore, it did not appear on legal instruments. It did, however, appear on the inscriptions on coins.

==Union and after==
The kingdoms of England and Scotland were formally united into a single Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 by the Act of Union. Queen Anne consequently assumed the style &quot;Queen of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.&quot;. It remained in use until 1801, when Great Britain and Ireland combined to become the United Kingdom. George III used the opportunity to drop both the reference to France and &quot;etc.&quot; from the style. It was suggested to him that he assume the title &quot;Emperor&quot;, but he rejected the proposal. Instead, the style became &quot;King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Defender of the Faith&quot;.

The style used by Victoria in her proclamation to &quot;the Princes, Chiefs and People of India&quot; in 1858 was: &quot;Victoria, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the Colonies and Dependencies thereof in Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and Australasia, Queen, Defender of the Faith&quot;.

In 1876 &quot;Empress of India&quot; was added to Queen Victoria&#x27;s titles by the Royal Titles Act 1876, so that the Queen of the United Kingdom, the ruler of a vast empire, would not be outranked by her own daughter, Victoria, who had married the heir to the German Empire (an empire by the necessity of establishing a federal monarchy in which several kings wished to retain their royal titles despite their subjugation to a different monarchy). Her successor, Edward VII, changed the style in 1901, by the Royal Titles Act, to reflect the United Kingdom&#x27;s other colonial possessions, adding &quot;and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas&quot; after &quot;Ireland&quot;. In general usage the monarch came to be called the King-Emperor, especially in the Crown&#x27;s overseas possessions and in British India and the princely states.

==Dominions and Commonwealth realms==
In 1922 the Irish Free State gained independence. In 1927 the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 changed the description &quot;of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas&quot; to &quot;of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas&quot;. The 1927 Act was also significant for opening the door to dominions (later Commonwealth realms) having the right to determine their own style and title for the sovereign, a right which was first exercised in 1953.

The designation &quot;Emperor of India&quot; was dropped from the royal style in 1948 after the independence of India and Pakistan a year earlier, even though King George VI remained king of the dominion of India until 1950, when it became a republic within the Commonwealth. The dominion of Pakistan existed between 1947 and 1956, when it too became a republic within the Commonwealth. Similarly, although the republic of Ireland was constituted in 1949, &quot;Great Britain and Ireland&quot; was not replaced with &quot;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot; until 1953. In the same year the phrase &quot;Head of the Commonwealth&quot; was also added, and &quot;British Dominions beyond the Seas&quot; was replaced with &quot;other Realms and Territories&quot;. Thus, the style of the present sovereign is &quot;By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of His other Realms and Territories King, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith&quot;.

Also in 1953, separate styles were adopted for each of the realms over which the sovereign reigned (the Commonwealth realms). Most realms used the form &quot;Queen of ... and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth&quot;, omitting the title &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;. Australia, New Zealand and Canada all included a reference to the United Kingdom as well as &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;, but now all of them have dropped the reference to the United Kingdom, and only New Zealand retains the title &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;. (Australia dropped both the reference to the United Kingdom and &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; in 1973; Canada dropped both of them in January 2024; New Zealand dropped the reference to the United Kingdom in 1974.) Canada also publishes an official style in the French language.

==List of changes to the royal style== 
The proclamation of Elizabeth II, in 1953, was made in English and in Latin.

===English sovereigns===
* In 1521 English replaced Latin as the official language of the regnal style.
* ... &quot;and of the Church of England and also of Ireland on Earth Supreme Head&quot; omitted in formal use in early 1554 (omission retroactively approved by an act of Parliament assented to 16 Jan 1555)

===Scottish sovereigns===

The earliest recorded style of the monarchs of what is now Scotland varies: sometimes it is &quot;King of the Picts&quot;, sometimes &quot;King of Fortriu&quot;, and sometimes &quot;King of Alba&quot;. Only after 900 does the latter title become standard. From the reign of David I, the title became either &quot;rex Scottorum&quot; (&quot;King of Scots&quot;) or &quot;rex Scotiae&quot; (&quot;King of Scotland&quot;).

The former term was the most common, but the latter was used sometimes. James VI and I proclaimed himself &quot;King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland” by Royal Proclamation, but this was not accepted by the English Parliament. The last three monarchs of Scotland—William II (William III of England), Mary II and Anne—all used &quot;King/Queen of Scotland&quot; in preference to &quot;of Scots&quot;.

<doc id="886036" wikidata="Q2632427" url="?curid=886036" title="Ethical intuitionism">
<text>Ethical intuitionism (also called moral intuitionism) is a view or family of views in moral epistemology (and, on some definitions, metaphysics). It is foundationalism applied to moral knowledge, the thesis that some moral truths can be known non-inferentially (i.e., known without one needing to infer them from other truths one believes). Such an epistemological view is by definition committed to the existence of knowledge of moral truths; therefore, ethical intuitionism implies cognitivism.

As a foundationalist epistemological position, ethical intuitionism contrasts with coherentist positions in moral epistemology, such as those that depend on reflective equilibrium.

Despite the name &quot;ethical intuitionism&quot;, ethical intuitionists need not (though often do) accept that intuitions of value (or of evaluative facts) form the foundation of ethical knowledge; the common commitment of ethical intuitionists is to a non-inferential foundation for ethical knowledge, regardless of whether such a non-inferential foundation consists in &quot;intuitions&quot; as such.

Throughout the philosophical literature, the term &quot;ethical intuitionism&quot; is frequently used with significant variation in its sense. This article&#x27;s focus on foundationalism reflects the core commitments of contemporary self-identified ethical intuitionists.

Sufficiently broadly defined, ethical intuitionism can be taken to encompass cognitivist forms of moral sense theory. It is usually furthermore taken as essential to ethical intuitionism that there be self-evident or &quot;a priori&quot; moral knowledge; this counts against considering moral sense theory to be a species of intuitionism. (see the Rational intuition versus moral sense section of this article for further discussion).

== History ==

===Early intuitionism===
While there were ethical intuitionists in a broad sense at least as far back as Thomas Aquinas, the philosophical school usually labelled as ethical intuitionism developed in Britain in the 17th and 18th centuries. Early intuitionists like John Balguy, Ralph Cudworth, and Samuel Clarke were principally concerned with defending moral objectivism against the theories of Thomas Hobbes. Later, their views would be revived and developed by Richard Price and pitted against the moral sense theory of Francis Hutcheson, himself sometimes considered a sentimentalist intuitionist. Immanuel Kant&#x27;s moral philosophy would be received in Britain as a German analog to Price, though according to R. M. Hare it is questionable whether Kant is an intuitionist.

===Henry Sidgwick===

In the 19th century, ethical intuitionism was considered by most British philosophers to be a philosophical rival of utilitarianism, until Henry Sidgwick showed there to be several logically distinct theories, both normative and epistemological, sharing the same label. For Sidgwick, intuitionism is about intuitive, i.e. non-inferential, knowledge of moral principles, which are self-evident to the knower. The criteria for this type of knowledge include that they are expressed in clear terms, that the different principles are mutually consistent with each other and that there is expert consensus on them. According to Sidgwick, commonsense moral principles fail to pass this test, but there are some more abstract principles that pass it, like that &quot;what is right for me must be right for all persons in precisely similar circumstances&quot; or that &quot;one should be equally concerned with all temporal parts of one’s life&quot;. The most general principles arrived at this way are all compatible with &quot;utilitarianism&quot;, which is why Sidgwick sees a harmony between &quot;intuitionism&quot; and &quot;utilitarianism&quot;. There are also less general intuitive principles, like the duty to keep one&#x27;s promises or to be just, but these principles are not universal and there are cases where different duties stand in conflict with each other. Sidgwick suggests that we resolve such conflicts in a utilitarian fashion by considering the consequences of the conflicting actions. Inspired by Sidgwick, 20th century philosopher C.D. Broad would coin the term &quot;deontological ethics&quot; to refer to the normative doctrines associated with intuitionism, leaving the phrase &quot;ethical intuitionism&quot; free to refer to the epistemological doctrines.

===Intuitionism in analytic philosophy===

Ethical intuitionism was popular in the early twentieth century, particularly among British analytic philosophers. H.A. Prichard gave a defense of the view in his &quot;Does Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake?&quot; (1912), wherein he contended that moral philosophy rested chiefly on the desire to provide arguments starting from non-normative premises for the principles of obligation that we pre-philosophically accept, such as the principle that one ought to keep one&#x27;s promises or that one ought not to steal. This is a mistake, Prichard argued, both because it is impossible to derive any statement about what one ought to do from statements not concerning obligation (even statements about what is &quot;good&quot;), and because there is no need to do so since common sense principles of moral obligation are self-evident.

Prichard was influenced by G.E. Moore, whose &quot;Principia Ethica&quot; (1903) argued famously that &quot;goodness&quot; was an indefinable, non-natural property of which we had intuitive awareness. Moore originated the term &quot;the naturalistic fallacy&quot; to refer to the (alleged) error of confusing goodness with some natural property, and he deployed the Open Question Argument to show why this was an error. Unlike Prichard, Moore thought that one could derive principles of obligation from propositions about what is good.

W. D. Ross&#x27;s intuitionism was influenced both by Prichard and Moore. He holds that we can know moral truths through intuition, for example, that it is wrong to lie or that knowledge is intrinsically good. Intuitions involve a direct apprehension that is not mediated by inferences or deductions: they are self-evident and therefore not in need of any additional proof. This ability is not inborn but has to be developed on the way to reaching mental maturity. But in its fully developed form, we can know moral truths just as well as we can know mathematical truths like the axioms of geometry or arithmetic. This self-evident knowledge is limited to general principles: we can come to know the prima facie duties this way, e.g. that, generally speaking, one should keep one&#x27;s promises and refrain from harming others. But intuition is unable to reveal one&#x27;s &quot;absolute&quot; duty in a particular situation: what one should do all things considered. All we can do is consult perception to determine which prima facie duty has the highest normative weight in this particular case, even though this usually does not amount to knowledge proper due to the complexity involved in most specific cases.

Ethical intuitionism suffered a dramatic fall from favor by the middle of the century, due in part to the influence of logical positivism, in part to the rising popularity of naturalism in philosophy, and in part to philosophical objections based on the phenomenon of widespread moral disagreement. C. L. Stevenson&#x27;s emotivism would prove especially attractive to Moorean intuitionists seeking to avoid ethical naturalism. In the later parts of the 20th century, intuitionism would have few adherents to speak of; in Bernard Williams&#x27; words: &quot;This model of intuition in ethics has been demolished by a succession of critics, and the ruins of it that remain above ground are not impressive enough to invite much history of what happened to it.&quot;

===Contemporary developments===

Some recent work suggests the view may be enjoying a resurgence of interest in academic philosophy. Robert Audi is one of the main contemporary supporters of ethical intuitionism. His 2005 book &quot;The Good in the Right&quot; claims to update and strengthen Rossian intuitionism and to develop the epistemology of ethics. Michael Huemer&#x27;s book &quot;Ethical Intuitionism&quot; (2005) also provides a recent defense of the view. Furthermore, authors writing on normative ethics often accept &quot;methodological intuitionism&quot; as they present allegedly obvious or intuitive examples or thought experiments as support for their theories.

==Definitional issues==
Because it was not until Sidgwick that it was clear there were several distinct theses sharing the label &quot;ethical intuitionism&quot;, the term has developed many different connotations. This is liable to cause confusion; for example, G.E. Moore&#x27;s &quot;Principia Ethica&quot; is often considered a &quot;locus classicus&quot; defense of ethical intuitionism, yet Moore explicitly refuses the label because of the large number of differences between his own views and traditional intuitionists.

===Inessential connotations===
Traditionally, intuitionism was often understood as having several other commitments:

# Moral realism, the view that there are objective facts of morality (as held by Mark Platts).
# Ethical non-naturalism, the view that these evaluative facts cannot be reduced to natural fact.
# Classical foundationalism, i.e., the view that intuited moral beliefs are: infallible (indefeasible), indubitable (irresistibly compelling), incorrigible, certain, or understandable without reflection.
# The view that moral properties are &quot;simple&quot; (as held by G.E. Moore).
# The view that moral truths are knowable &quot;only&quot; by intuition.
However, none of these positions are essential to the view; most ethical intuitionists (such as G.E. Moore and W. D. Ross) simply happen to have held those views as well.

Furthermore, intuitionists are often understood to be essentially committed to the existence of a special psychological faculty that reliably produces true moral intuitions. Few intuitionists, however, have explicitly required such a faculty exist, and some, such as Richard Price, would have explicitly denied it exists.

====Pluralism====
Secondly, sometimes the term &quot;ethical intuitionism&quot; is associated with a pluralistic, deontological position in normative ethics, a position defended by most ethical intuitionists, with Henry Sidgwick and G.E. Moore being notable exceptions.

===&quot;Intuitivism&quot;===
Robert Audi points out that in applied ethics, philosophers frequently appeal to intuitions to justify their claims, even though they do not call themselves intuitionists. Audi hence uses the label &quot;intuitivists&quot; to refer to people who are intuitionists without labeling themselves as such.

On this broad understanding of intuitionism, there are only a few ways someone doing moral philosophy might &quot;not &quot;count as an intuitionist. First, they might really refrain from relying on intuitions in moral philosophy altogether (say, by attempting to derive all moral claims from claims about what certain individuals desire). Second, they might deny foundationalism in favor of (say) coherentism. Third, they might be non-cognitivists, holding that moral &quot;beliefs&quot; aren&#x27;t really beliefs at all.

== Rational intuition versus moral sense ==
Some use the term &quot;ethical intuitionism&quot; in moral philosophy to refer to the general position that we have some non-inferential moral knowledge—that is, basic moral knowledge that is not inferred from or based on any proposition. However, it is important to distinguish between empiricist versus rationalist models of this. Some, thus, reserve the term &quot;ethical intuitionism&quot; for the rationalist model and the term &quot;moral sense theory&quot; for the empiricist model. However, the terminology is not ultimately important, so long as one keeps in mind the relevant differences between these two views.

Generally speaking, rationalist ethical intuitionism models the acquisition of such non-inferential moral knowledge on &quot;a priori&quot;, non-empirical knowledge, such as knowledge of mathematical truths; whereas moral sense theory models the acquisition of such non-inferential moral knowledge on empirical knowledge, such as knowledge of the colors of objects (see moral sense theory).

=== Rational intuition ===

The rationalist version of ethical intuitionism models ethical intuitions on &quot;a priori&quot;, non-empirically-based intuitions of truths, such as basic truths of mathematics. Take for example the belief that two minus one is one. This piece of knowledge is often thought to be non-inferential in that it is not grounded in or justified by some other proposition or claim. Rather, one who understands the relevant concepts involved in the proposition that two minus one is one has what one might call an &quot;intuition&quot; of the truth of the proposition. One intuits the truth of the proposition, rather than inferring it. Likewise, the ethical intuitionist claims that basic moral truths—whether they are principles (such as &quot;don&#x27;t kill people&quot;) or judgments (such as &quot;it is wrong to kill people&quot;)—are known without inference, and in particular they are known via one&#x27;s rational intuition.

Some rationalist ethical intuitionists characterize moral &quot;intuitions&quot; as a species of belief that are &quot;self-evident&quot; in that they are justified simply by virtue of one&#x27;s understanding of the proposition believed. Others characterize &quot;intuitions&quot; as a distinct kind of mental state, in which something &quot;seems&quot; to one to be the case (whether one believes it or not) as a result of intellectual reflection. Michael Huemer, for example, defines &quot;intuition&quot; as a sort of seeming:

Reasoning sometimes changes how things seem to us. But there is also a way things seem to us prior to reasoning; otherwise, reasoning could not get started. The way things seem prior to reasoning we may call an &#x27;initial appearance&#x27;. An initial, &quot;intellectual&quot; appearance is an &#x27;intuition&#x27;. That is, an intuition that &quot;p&quot; is a state of its seeming to one that &quot;p&quot; that is not dependent on inference from other beliefs and that results from thinking about &quot;p&quot;, as opposed to perceiving, remembering, or introspecting. An ethical intuition is an intuition whose content is an evaluative proposition. (§5.2)

Regardless of one&#x27;s definition of rational intuition, intuitionists all agree that rational intuitions are not justified by inference from a separate belief.

=== Moral sense ===

Another version—what one might call the empiricist version—of ethical intuitionism models non-inferential ethical knowledge on sense perception. This version involves what is often called a &quot;moral sense&quot;. According to moral sense theorists, certain moral truths are known via this moral sense simply on the basis of experience, not inference.

One way to understand the moral sense is to draw an analogy between it and other kinds of senses. Beauty, for example, is something we see in some faces, artworks and landscapes. We can also hear it in some pieces of music. We clearly do not need an independent aesthetic sense faculty to perceive beauty in the world. Our ordinary five senses are quite enough to observe it, though merely observing something beautiful is no guarantee that we can observe its beauty. In the same way, a color-blind person is not necessarily able to perceive the green color of grass although he is capable of vision. Suppose we give a name to this ability to appreciate the beauty in things we see: one might call it the &quot;aesthetic sense&quot;. This aesthetic sense does not come automatically to all people with perfect vision and hearing, so it is fair to describe it as something extra, something not wholly reducible to vision and hearing. As the aesthetic sense informs us about what is beautiful, we can analogically understand the &quot;moral sense&quot; as informing us of what is good. A modern example of a moral sensation is the impression of wrongness felt when one sees puppies being kicked.

<text>Decretals () are letters of a pope that formulate decisions in ecclesiastical law of the Catholic Church.

They are generally given in answer to consultations but are sometimes given due to the initiative of the pope himself. These furnish, with the canons of the councils, the chief source of the legislation of the church, and formed the greater part of the &quot;Corpus Iuris Canonici&quot; before they were formally replaced by the &quot;Codex Iuris Canonici&quot; of 1917. However, Cardinal Pietro Gasparri led the papal commission for the revision of canon law and later on published a guide to the &quot;fontes&quot; (sources) used in the 1917 code. Many canons in this code can easily be retraced in their relationship to and dependency on medieval decretals as well as Roman law.

In themselves, the medieval decretals form a very special source which throws light on medieval conflicts and the approaches to their solution. They are sometimes concerned with very important issues touching on many aspects of medieval life, for example: marriage or legal procedure.

==Definition and early history==

In a wider sense, the Latin term &quot;decretalis&quot; (in full: &quot;epistola decretalis&quot;) signifies a pontifical letter containing a decretum, or pontifical decision.

In a narrower sense, it denotes a decision on a matter of discipline.

In the strictest sense of the word, it means a papal rescript (&quot;rescriptum&quot;), an answer of the pope when he has been appealed to or his advice has been sought on a matter of discipline.

Papal decretals are therefore not necessarily general laws of the church, but frequently the pope ordered the recipient of his letter to communicate the papal answer to the ecclesiastical authorities of the district to which he belonged; and it was their duty then to act in conformity with that decree when analogous cases arose. It is generally stated that the most ancient decretal is the letter of Pope Siricius (384–398) to Himerius, Bishop of Tarragona in Spain, dating from 385; but it would seem that the document of the fourth century known as &quot;Canones Romanorum ad Gallos episcopos&quot; is simply an &quot;epistola decretalis&quot; of his predecessor, Pope Damasus (366–384), addressed to the bishops of Gaul. The decretals ought to be carefully distinguished from the canons of the councils; from pontifical documents touching on Catholic doctrine, from the &quot;constitutiones&quot;, or pontifical documents given &quot;motu proprio&quot; (documents issued by the pope without being asked or being consulted upon a subject).

Finally, under the name &quot;decretals&quot; are known certain collections, containing especially, but not exclusively, pontifical decretals. These are the canonical collections of a later date than the &quot;Decretum&quot; of Gratian (about 1150). The commentators on these collections are named &quot;decretalists&quot;, in contradistinction to the &quot;decretists&quot;, or those who commented upon the &quot;Decretum&quot; of Gratian. Eventually some of these collections received official recognition; they form what is now known as the &quot;Corpus Juris Canonici&quot;. An account follows of the collections of decretals, particularly of those of Pope Gregory IX.

Decretals are known by the first two Latin words that begin the letter, called the incipit.

== Decretal collections ==
The early collections of decretals were not commissioned by the popes. A number of bishops collected decretals and tried to organize them into collections. Burchard of Worms and Ivo of Chartres made influential collections. From the &quot;Collectio Francofurtana&quot; (around 1180) onwards, collections get a more systematic character, and a school appears, the decretalists, who compile, organise and study the decretals as the basis of canon law. In quick succession, four so-called &quot;compilationes&quot; appeared between 1191 and 1226, as a sign of the growing importance of papal decretals. The fifth compilation, the &quot;Compilatio Quinta&quot;, was made by the canonist Tancred (d. about 1235) for Honorius III in 1226, who sent it immediately to the University of Bologna. It was organized into five books.

Pope Gregory IX commissioned the Dominican Raymund of Peñafort to edit a comprehensive collection of papal decretals. This collection of nearly 2,000 decretals appeared in 1234 as the &quot;Decretales Gregorii IX&quot;, also known as the &quot;Liber Extra&quot;, which was also immediately sent to the universities of Bologna and Paris. In 1298, Pope Boniface VIII published the next major collection of decretals. He entrusted three canonists with its redaction. This collection is known as the &quot;Liber Sextus&quot;.
In the 14th century, a few small collections followed: the &quot;Constitutiones Clementinae&quot; or Clementines (1317), edited by Anastasius Germonius and published by pope John XXII, and the &quot;Extravagantes Johannes XXII&quot; (1325–1327).

Collections are known as systematic or primitive, the chief distinguishing characteristic being the use of headings to organize the work. This organizational scheme makes a collection systematic.

===&quot;Quinque Compilationes Antiquae Decretalium&quot;===
The &quot;Decretum&quot; of Gratian was considered in the middle of the 12th century as a &quot;corpus juris canonici,&quot; i. e. a code of the ecclesiastical laws then in force. As such however, it was incomplete and many new laws were made by succeeding popes; hence the necessity of new collections. Five of these collections exhibited pontifical legislation from the &quot;Decretum&quot; of Gratian to the pontificate of Gregory IX (1150–1227). These are known as the &quot;Quinque compilationes antiquæ&quot;. On account of their importance they were made the text of canonical instruction at the University of Bologna and, like the &quot;Decretum&quot; of Gratian, were glossed (notes bearing on the explanation and interpretation of the text were added to the manuscripts).
The first collection, the &quot;Breviarium extravagantium&quot; or summary of the decretals not contained in the &quot;Decretum&quot; of Gratian (&quot;vagantes extra Decretum&quot;), was compiled by Bernardus Papiensis in 1187–1191. It contains papal decretals to the pontificate of Clement III inclusive (1187–1191). The compilation known as the third (&quot;Compilatio tertia&quot;), written however prior to the second collection (&quot;Compilatio secunda&quot;), contains the documents of the first twelve years of the pontificate of Innocent III (8 January 1198—7 January 1210), which are of a later date than those of the second compilation, the latter containing especially the decretals of Clement III and Celestine III (1191–1198). The &quot;Compilatio tertia&quot; is the oldest official collection of the legislation of the Roman Church; for it was composed by Cardinal Petrus Collivacinus of Benevento by order of Innocent III (1198–1216), by whom it was approved in the Bull &quot;Devotioni vestræ&quot; of 28 December 1210.

The second compilation, also called &quot;Decretales mediæ&quot; or &quot;Decretales intermediæ&quot;, was the work of a private individual, the Englishman John of Wales (Johannes de Walesio, Walensis or Galensis). Around 1216, an unknown writer formed the &quot;Compilatio quarta&quot;, the fourth collection, containing the decretals of the pontificate of Innocent III which are of a later date than 7 January 1210 and the canons of the Fourth Lateran Council held in 1215. Finally, the fifth compilation is, like the third, an official code, compiled by order of Honorius III (1216–1227) and approved by this pope in the Bull &quot;Novæ causarum&quot; (1226 or 1227).
Several of these collections contain decretals anterior to the time of Gratian, but not inserted by him in the &quot;Decretum&quot;. Bernard of Pavia divided his collection into five books arranged in titles and chapters. The first book treats of persons possessing jurisdiction (&quot;judex&quot;), the second of the civil legal processes (&quot;judicium&quot;), the third of clerics and regulars (&quot;clerus&quot;), the fourth of marriage (&quot;connubium&quot;), the fifth of delinquencies and of criminal procedure (crimen). In the four other collections the same logical division of the subject-matter was adopted.

===&quot;Decretales Gregorii IX&quot;===

Pope Gregory IX ordered in 1230 his chaplain and confessor, Raymond of Peñaforte (Pennafort), a Dominican, to form a new canonical collection destined to replace all former collections.

===Later collections===

The decretals of the successors of Gregory IX were also arranged in collections, of which several were official, notably those of popes Innocent IV, Gregory X and Nicholas III, who ordered their decretals to be inserted among those of Gregory IX. In addition to these, several unofficial collections were drawn up. The inconveniences which Gregory IX had wished to remedy presented themselves again. For this reason, Boniface VIII made a new collection of decretals which he promulgated by the Papal Bull &quot;Sacrosanctæ&quot; of 3 March 1298. This is the &quot;Sextus Liber Decretalium&quot;; it has a value similar to that of the Decretals of Gregory IX. Boniface VIII abrogated all the decretals of the popes subsequent to the appearance of the Decretals of Gregory IX which were not included or maintained in force by the new collection; but as this collection later than that of Gregory IX, it modifies those decisions of the latter collection which are irreconcilable with its own.

Clement V also undertook to make an official collection, but death prevented him from perfecting this work. His collection was published by John XXII on 25 October 1317, under the title of &quot;Liber Septimus Decretalium&quot;, but it is better known under the name of &quot;Constitutiones Clementis V&quot; or &quot;Clementinæ&quot;. This is the last official collection of decretals. The two following collections, the last in the &quot;Corpus Juris Canonici&quot;, are the work of private individuals. They are called &quot;Extravagantes&quot;, because they are not included in the official collections. The first contains twenty Constitutions of John XXII, and is named &quot;Extravagantes Joannis XXII&quot;; the second is called &quot;Extravagantes communes&quot; and contains the decretals of different popes commonly met with in the manuscripts and editions. They were brought to their modern form by Jean Chappuis in 1500 and 1503.

===&quot;Extravagantes&quot;===

This term (Latin Extra &#x27;outside&#x27; + vagari &#x27;to wander&#x27;) is employed to designate some papal decretals not contained in certain canonical collections, which possess a special authority: they are not found in the Decree of Gratian or the three official collections of the &quot;Corpus Juris&quot; (the Decretals of Gregory IX, the Sixth Book of the Decretals and the Clementines).
The term was first applied to those papal documents which Gratian had not inserted in his &quot;Decree&quot; (about 1140), but yet were obligatory upon the whole church, also to other decretals of a later date, and possessed of the same authority. Bernardus Papiensis designated under the name of &quot;Breviarium Extravagantium&quot; or Digest of the &quot;Extravagantes&quot;, the collection of papal documents which he compiled between 1187 and 1191. Even the Decretals of Gregory IX (published 1234) were long known as the &quot;Liber&quot; or &quot;Collectio Extra&quot;, i.e. the collection of the canonical laws not contained in the &quot;Decree&quot; of Gratian.
This term is now applied to the collections known as the &quot;Extravagantes Joannis XXII&quot; and the &quot;Extravagantes communes&quot;, both of which are found in all editions of the &quot;Corpus Juris Canonici&quot;. When Pope John XXII (1316–1334) published the decretals known as the Clementines, there already existed some pontifical documents, obligatory upon the whole church but not included in the &quot;Corpus Juris&quot;. This is why these Decretals were called &quot;Extravagantes&quot;. Their number was increased by the inclusion of all the pontifical laws of later date, added to the manuscripts of the &quot;Corpus Juris&quot;, or gathered into separate collections.

In 1325, Zenselinus de Cassanis added a gloss to twenty constitutions of Pope John XXII, and named this collection &quot;Viginti Extravagantes pap Joannis XXII&quot;. The others were known as &quot;Extravagantes communes&quot;, a title given to the collection by Jean Chappuis in the Paris edition of the &quot;Corpus Juris&quot; (1499 1505). He adopted the systematic order of the official collections of canon law and classified in a similar way the &quot;Extravagantes&quot; commonly met with (hence &quot;Extravagantes communes&quot;) in the manuscripts and editions of the &quot;Corpus Juris&quot;.
This collection contains decretals of the popes Martin IV, Boniface VIII (notably the celebrated Bull &quot;Unam Sanctam&quot;), Benedict XI, Clement V, John XXII, Benedict XII, Clement VI, Urban V, Martin V, Eugene IV, Callistus III, Paul II and Sixtus IV (1281–1484). Chappuis also classified the &quot;Extravagantes&quot; of John XXII under fourteen titles, containing in all twenty chapters. These two collections are of lesser value than the three others which form the &quot;Corpus Juris Canonici&quot;; they possess no official value, nor has custom bestowed such on them. On the other hand, many of the decretals comprised in them contain legislation obligatory upon the whole church such as the Constitution of Paul II, &quot;Ambitios&quot;, which forbade the alienation of ecclesiastical goods. This is however not true of all of them; some had even been formally abrogated at the time when Chappuis made his collection; three decretals of John XXII are reproduced in both collections.
Both the collections were printed in the official (1582) edition of the &quot;Corpus Juris Canonici&quot;. This explains the favour they enjoyed among canonists. For a critical text of these collections, see Friedberg, &quot;Corpus Juris Canonici&quot; (Leipzig, 1879, 1881), II.

===False Decretals===

The Pseudo-Isidorean Decretals (or False Decretals) are a set of extensive and influential medieval forgeries, written by a scholar or group of scholars known as Pseudo-Isidore. They aimed to defend the position of bishops against metropolitans and secular authorities by creating false documents purportedly authored by early popes, together with interpolated conciliar documents.

<doc id="886059" wikidata="Q5421432" url="?curid=886059" title="Explosive Ordnance Disposal Badge">
<text>The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Badge is a military badge of the United States Armed Forces which recognizes those service members, qualified as explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) technicians, who are specially trained to deal with the construction, deployment, disarmament, and disposal of high explosive munitions including other types of ordnance such as nuclear, biological and chemical weapons along with improvised explosive devices (IED) and improvised nuclear devices (IND). Also known as the “EOD Badge” or &quot;Crab&quot;, the decoration is issued by the United States Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. The EOD Badge is the only occupational badge awarded to all five services under the United States Department of Defense.

First created in the 1950s, the EOD Badge is issued in three levels and is identical for all branches of service. Although each service has its own requirements the basic EOD badge is issued upon completion of explosive handling training and/or between 18–24 months of on-the-job field training. The Senior EOD Badge is issued after 3–5 years as an explosive ordnance specialist and the Master Explosive Ordnance Disposal Badge is issued after 7–15 years of service in a senior supervisory position.

==The Meaning of the EOD Badge==
The &quot;crab&quot;, as it is commonly known, is the only joint service badge and can only be earned upon successful completion of the 42-week course at the Naval School of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (NAVSCOLEOD) located at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Prior to attending NAVSCOLEOD, Navy service members attend Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center (NDSTC) in Panama City, FL for a 9 week EOD Diver Course. Additionally the Naval students will attend the maritime ordnance section known as &quot;Area 8&quot; followed by Underwater division. After NAVSCOLEOD, Navy service members attend a 3-4 week course to earn &quot;jump wings&quot; at the Army&#x27;s Ft. Moore, GA. Army service members will attend a course at Fort Gregg-Adams, Virginia for 7 weeks before attending NAVSCOLEOD.

The Wreath
Symbolic of the achievements and laurels gained minimizing accident potentials through the ingenuity and devotion to duty of its members. It is in memory of those EOD personnel who gave their lives while performing EOD duties.

The Bomb
Copied from the design of the World War II Bomb Disposal Badge, the bomb represents the historic and major objective of the EOD attack, the unexploded bomb. The three fins represent the major areas of nuclear, conventional and chemical/biological interest.

Lightning Bolts
Symbolize the potential destructive power of the bomb and the courage and professionalism of EOD personnel in their endeavors to reduce hazards as well as to render explosive ordnance harmless.

The Shield
Represents the EOD missionto prevent a detonation and protect the surrounding area and property to the utmost.

==Navy designation and warfare qualification==

Prior to 1 June 2006, enlisted members of United States Navy that qualified as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Warfare Specialist were authorized to wear the warfare qualification as well as have (EOD) listed after their rating designator. For example, if Bob Jones was a Hull Technician First Class Petty Officer (Explosive Ordnance Disposal Warfare Specialist), then his title would be HT1 (EOD) Bob Jones.

As of 1 June 2006 for E6-E9 and 1 October 2006 for E1-E5, U.S. Navy EOD Technicians have become their own rating within the Navy. Only after being qualified as a Senior EOD Technician, is the technician designated as an EOD Warfare Specialist. An example would be: Petty Officer First Class Bob Jones, who is a Senior EOD Technician, would have his title read EOD1 (EWS) Bob Jones.

In 2007, the Special Operations Officer Community was rechristened &quot;Explosive Ordnance Disposal,&quot; a change which the Navy felt also needed to be reflected in the EOD Officer warfare device as well. The new officer insignia is identical to the Master EOD warfare device, but is gold in color.

<doc id="886061" wikidata="Q1271828" url="?curid=886061" title="Mickey Finn (percussionist)">
<text>Michael Norman Finn (3 June 1947 – 11 January 2003) was an English musician. He was best known as the percussionist and sideman to Marc Bolan in his band Tyrannosaurus Rex (on one album, &quot;A Beard of Stars&quot;) and later the 1970s glam rock group T. Rex. After Bolan&#x27;s death and T. Rex&#x27;s demise, he worked as a session musician for The Blow Monkeys and The Soup Dragons.

==Career==

Finn was born in Thornton Heath, Surrey. After he joined Tyrannosaurus Rex in late 1969, it was rumoured that Bolan had hired Finn for his good looks, and because he admired his motorcycle, rather than for his musical ability. Finn was unable to recreate the complex rhythmical patterns of his predecessor, Steve Peregrin Took, and was effectively hired as much for a visual foil for Bolan as for his drumming. The BBC news commented on this, saying &quot;Marc Bolan was supposed to have said of Finn: &#x27;He can&#x27;t sing... but he looks superb.

Mickey Finn stated, on a radio show in Denmark on which he and Marc Bolan were appearing as guest DJs, that his big influence in percussion was the prolific Master Henry Gibson from Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s band. In 1969–1971, Finn&#x27;s contribution to Bolan&#x27;s music, as bongocero, backing vocalist and occasional bass guitarist, was essential, because T. Rex started off as Tyrannosaurus Rex, a duo and Marc needed a replacement for Took. Something of a character both on and off stage, Finn was often to be seen wearing a hat (including a green bowler), a trademark that was adopted by a significant proportion of T. Rex fans.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Finn made a handful of guest appearances with the West London rock band, Checkpoint Charlie, fronted by Mick Lexington.

In 1991, he joined the Croydon R&amp;B band, WD40, which had a fluid line-up based around his old friend, drummer Stewart Childs, Colin Goody (harp, vocals), and Pete Robins (guitar, vocals). The band then added guitarists, percussionists, etc. as required, but Finn was forced to retire after about 12 months due to failing health. A couple of live tracks survive from this line up. Finn was also invited to play at the Marc Bolan 50th Anniversary gig organized by Mick Gray (ex-T. Rex tour manager and roadie), to celebrate what would have been Bolan&#x27;s 50th birthday at the Cambridge Corn Exchange on 30 September 1997. 

Finn returned to the mainstream music scene in 1997, fronting Mickey Finn&#x27;s T. Rex with Paul Fenton and Jack Green, playing old T. Rex songs until his death. He played on one live album by the band, Renaissance (2002).

==Death==
Finn died in Croydon, Surrey, on 11 January 2003, aged 55. His manager, Barry Newby commented that it was likely that Finn&#x27;s illness and death were due to liver and kidney problems but it was not confirmed at the time of the interview. In 2020, Finn was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of T. Rex with Bolan, Steve Currie and Bill Legend.

<text>Juan de Torquemada (Ecclesiastical Latin: Johannes de Turre cremata, various spellings) O.P. (1388 – 26 September 1468), Spanish ecclesiastic, defender of Jewish conversos, has been described as the most articulate papal apologist of the fifteenth century. He was an uncle of Tomás de Torquemada, afterwards notorious as the persecuting Grand Inquisitor.

==Life==
Juan de Torquemada was born in Valladolid, Spain. &quot;There is a general historical consensus that the family were former Jews&quot;. Though those converso origins are very often stated without providing any source, they are &quot;based primarily on Hernando del Pulgar’s statement that Juan de Torquemada’s &quot;abuelos&quot; were converts from the Jewish faith&quot;. As a &quot;converso&quot;, Pulgar is considered to have made this assertion out of hate for Juan de Torquemada’s nephew, Tomás de Torquemada. However, a 2020 study of all of Juan de Torquemada’s ancestors found no Jewish converts in his family. At an early age he joined the Dominican Order, and soon distinguished himself for learning and devotion. In 1415 he accompanied the general of his order to the Council of Constance. Thereafter he proceeded to the University of Paris to study and took his doctorate degree in theology in 1423. After teaching for some time in Paris, he became prior of the Dominican house in Valladolid, and then in Toledo.

Torquemada attended the Council of Basel (1431–1449) as a representative of his order and of the King of Castile. At the Council of Basel, he was one of the ablest supporters of the viewpoint of pope Eugene IV and the Roman curia. He was rewarded with the office of Master of the Sacred Palace (4 March 1435), and later with a cardinal&#x27;s hat in 1439. Torquemada participated in the Council of Florence, speaking on theological issues involving the eastern churches and defending papal primacy in a debate with Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini. He also worked on behalf of Pope Eugene on missions to Germany and France before settling in the Roman Curia. As Cardinal of San Sisto, Torquemada supported papal Crusade policy in opposition to the Ottoman Turks.

In 1449 Toledo an unpopular tax law caused an insurrection against a weak government, during which a mob burned the house of a &quot;new Christian&quot; tax collector. (These &quot;new Christians&quot;, or &quot;conversos&quot;, were persons of Jewish descent professing Christianity; their sincerity was doubted by some.) A faction led by one Pedro Sarmiento imposed a law that deprived &quot;conversos&quot; of government and church posts and disqualified them from testifying in legal proceedings. The legal status of &quot;conversos&quot; thus came into question. The dispute spread outside Castile and came to the attention of Pope Nicholas V. On the urging of Torquemada the Pope issued a bull condemning discrimination against &quot;conversos&quot;; he excommunicated Sarmiento and some of his followers. In 1450 Torquemada published a tract — a &quot;sharp and relentless&quot; theological attack — in which he labelled Sarmiento and his followers as Midianites and Ishmaelites, the biblical enemies of the Israelite people, comparing them to the evil persecutor Haman. Torquemada&#x27;s defence of &quot;conversos&quot; was successful in Rome, but not eventually in Castile. (Juan de Torquemada was an uncle of the Inquisitor, Tomás de Torquemada. It has been argued that the latter&#x27;s persecution of crypto-Jews was motivated by a sense of insecurity about his own origins.)

Torquemada has been described as the most articulate papal apologist of the fifteenth century. The medieval papacy&#x27;s supremacy was challenged both by Hussites (early Protestants) and by conciliarists (who held that an ecumenical council of the Church had more authority than a pope). The Council of Basel had attempted to depose Pope Eugenius IV. Torquemada attacked both these positions in his &quot;Summa de ecclesia&quot; (1453).

Torquemada promoted reform of religious houses of his order and of monasteries. In 1456, the new Pope Callixtus III, aka Alfonso de Borja, gave him, in commendam, the position of Abbot of the monastery of Santa Scolastica in Subiaco. This connection may explain his interest in the importation of printing into Rome. The cardinal wrote extensively on behalf of papal primacy. Most notably, his &quot;Summa de ecclesia&quot; defended the Church against the Hussites and the Roman pontiff against conciliarism.

Torquemada became cardinal priest of Santa Maria in Trastevere (1446–1460), then cardinal bishop of Palestrina (1460–1463), and last cardinal bishop of Sabina (1463–1468). He participated in four papal elections, casting the deciding vote in the election of Pope Nicholas V (1447–1455). 
He died at Rome in 1468 and was buried at Santa Maria sopra Minerva.

A painting by Antoniazzo Romano showing the Annunciation has in its background Torquemada presenting girls who received dowry funds from a guild he founded to the Virgin Mary. (At an earlier age he was painted by Fra Angelico in a Crucifixion scene now at Harvard University&#x27;s Fogg Museum.)

==Works==
Torquemada&#x27;s principal works are:

*&quot;Meditationes, seu Contemplationes devotissimae&quot; (Rome, 1467)
*&quot;In Gratiani Decretum commentarii&quot; (4 vols., Venice, 1578)
*&quot;Expositio brevis et utilis super toto psalterio&quot; (Mainz, 1474)
*&quot;Quaestiones spirituales super evangelia totius anni&quot; (Brixen, 1498)
*&quot;Symbolum pro informatione Manichaeorum (El bogomilismo en Bosnia) (Publicaciones del Seminario Metropolitano de Burgos. Serie B)
* &quot;Tractatus contra Madianitas et Ismaelitas: defensa de los judíos conversos&quot;, (Publicaciones del Seminario Metropolitano de Burgos. Serie B, v. 2) (Burgos, 1957).
*&quot;Summa ecclesiastica&quot; (Salamanca, 1550) [or &quot;Summa de ecclesiastica potestate&quot;] or &quot;&quot;Summa de ecclesia&quot; (&quot;Summa de Ecclesia una cum eiusdem apparatu nunc primum in lucem edito, super decreto Papae Eugenii IIII in concilio Florentino de Unione Graecorum&quot; - Venetiis [Venice]: apud Michaelem Tramezinum, 1561).
The &quot;Summa de ecclesia&quot; has the following topical books:
#&quot;De universa ecclesia&quot;
#&quot;De Ecclesia romana et pontificis primatu&quot;
#&quot;De universalibus conciliis&quot;
#&quot;De schismaticis et haereticis&quot; (divided into two parts, on schism &amp; on heresy).

His &quot;De conceptione deiparae Mariae&quot;, libri viii. (Rome, 1547), was edited with preface and notes by E. B. Pusey (London, 1869 seq.) in opposition to Pope Pius IX&#x27;s definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception.

Other works include polemical tracts and sermons.

Torquemada&#x27;s &quot;Meditationes&quot; was the first illustrated book published in Italy. The first edition of the book was published in 1467 in Rome by Ulrich Han.

<doc id="886077" wikidata="Q2915577" url="?curid=886077" title="IBM 1400 series">
<text>The IBM 1400 series are second-generation (transistor) mid-range business decimal computers that IBM marketed in the early 1960s. The computers were offered to replace tabulating machines like the IBM 407. The 1400-series machines stored information in magnetic cores as variable-length character strings separated on the left by a special bit, called a &quot;wordmark,&quot; and on the right by a &quot;record mark.&quot; Arithmetic was performed digit-by-digit. Input and output support included punched card, magnetic tape, and high-speed line printers. Disk storage was also available.

Many members of the series could be used as independent systems, as extensions to IBM punched-card equipment, or as auxiliary equipment to other computer systems. Some, however, were intended for specific applications or were economical only as independent systems.

== History ==
The 1401, announced on October 5, 1959, is the first member of the IBM 1400 series. It was the first computer to deploy over 10,000 units. The IBM 1410 has a similar design, but with a larger address space. The IBM 1460 is logically, but not physically, identical to a 1401 with all of the options, with 16,000 characters of memory, and twice as fast. The 1240 is a banking system, equivalent to the 1440 system with MICR support. The IBM 7010 is logically, but not physically, identical to a 1410, and twice as fast.

Members of the 1400 series include:

* IBM 1240 - 1963 banking system
* IBM 1401 - 1959
* IBM 1410 - 1960
* IBM 1420 - 1962 high-speed bank transit system
* IBM 1440 - 1962
* IBM 1450 - 1968 Bank Data Processing System for small banks
* IBM 1460 - 1963
* IBM 7010 - 1962

Peripherals used with 1400 series machines included:

* Card reader/punches: IBM 1402, IBM 1442, IBM 1444
* Printers: IBM 1403, IBM 1404, IBM 1443, IBM 1445
* 7-track tape drives: IBM 729, IBM 7330, IBM 7335
* Disk drives: IBM 1301, IBM 1311, IBM 1405 RAMAC
* Check processing IBM 1210
* Paper tape input/output
* Console typewriter IBM 1407, IBM 1447

== Compatible systems ==
IBM provided several models compatible (or nearly so) with the 1401.
* 1460 is twice as fast, and many special features of 1401 were standard.
* 1440 was a popular lower-cost alternative, although not fully compatible with the 1401.
* 1240, 1420, 1450 are systems specially designed for banking.
* 1410 is a much faster system in the same spirit as 1401, but with significant differences, such as larger memory (up to 100,000 characters), more index registers (fifteen), and additional instructions. A remarkable feature in the pre-microprogramming era was a &quot;compatibility mode&quot; switch that allows it to run 1401 programs without change.
* 7010 is a faster and exactly compatible version of 1410.
* The IBM System/360 Model 30 could be ordered with a 1401 compatibility microprogram feature. Several 1400 series peripherals were adapted for use with System/360.

Honeywell&#x27;s Honeywell 200 provided approximate 1401 compatibility through a combination of architectural similarity and software support.

== Field and character coding ==
With the 1400 series, the smallest addressable unit in core-storage is called a character.
The 1400 stores alphameric characters internally in binary-coded decimal (BCD) form, spanning six bits called BA8421. When the character is an operation code or is the first character in a field, another bit, called the &quot;word mark&quot;, is included. An odd parity bit, called &quot;C&quot;, is also included.

Arithmetic is 10-based with the one&#x27;s position at the high- and the most-significant decimal digit at the low-address end of a multi-digit field, thus of ″big-endian″ style. This pertains for both, the (possibly indexed) address calculation for the access of operands and for the various operands of the arithmetic instructions. Whereas an address field in an instruction, designating an operand, is of fixed length (which depends on the size of the storage), the numeric operands of arithmetic instructions may be of arbitrary (positive) length. The word mark approach allows the 1410 to access a field (depending on the instruction to be performed) at either end, so that the most efficient access can be chosen. This way, the compiler of a higher-level programming language has to take care of the initial increment of the operand address (by operand length minus 1) for example, for add, subtract, or multiply instructions.

== Programming languages ==
Programming languages for the 1400 series included Symbolic Programming System (SPS, an assembly language), Autocoder (a more fully featured assembly language), COBOL, FORTRAN, Report Program Generator (RPG), and FARGO.

== Retirement ==
The 1400 series was replaced by System/360 and, later, by low-end machines like the IBM System/3, System/32, System/34, System/36, System/38, and AS/400.

The 1400s were officially withdrawn in the early 1970s, however some 1400-series peripherals were still marketed with third-generation systems.

Two 1401 computers have been restored to full operational status at the Computer History Museum.

<doc id="886085" wikidata="Q294988" url="?curid=886085" title="AMD K5">
<text>The K5 is AMD″s first x86 processor to be developed entirely in-house. Introduced in March 1996, its primary competition was Intel&#x27;s Pentium microprocessor. The K5 was an ambitious design, closer to a Pentium Pro than a Pentium regarding technical solutions and internal architecture. However, the final product was closer to the Pentium regarding performance, although faster clock-for-clock compared to the Pentium.

==Technical details==

The K5 was based upon an internal highly parallel RISC processor architecture with an x86 decoding front-end. The K5 offered good x86 compatibility and the in-house-developed test suite proved invaluable on later projects. All models had 4.3 million transistors, with five integer units that could process instructions out of order and one floating-point unit. The branch target buffer was four times the size of the Pentium&#x27;s and register renaming helped overcome register dependencies. The chip&#x27;s speculative execution of instructions reduced pipeline stalls. It had a 16 KB four-way set-associative instruction cache and an 8 KB data cache. The floating-point divide and square-root microcode were mechanically proven.
The floating-point transcendental instructions were implemented in hardware and were faithful to true mathematical results for all operands.

==Performance==
The K5 project represented an early chance for AMD to take technical leadership from Intel. Although the chip addressed the right design concepts, the actual engineering implementation had its issues. The low clock rates were, in part, due to AMD&#x27;s limitations as a &quot;cutting edge&quot; manufacturing company at the time, and in part due to the design itself, which had many levels of logic for the process technology of the day, hampering clock scaling. Additionally, while the K5&#x27;s floating-point performance was regarded as superior to that of the Cyrix 6x86, it was slower than that of the Pentium, although offering more reliable transcendental function results. Because it was late to market and did not meet performance expectations, the K5 never gained the acceptance among large computer manufacturers that the earlier Am486 and later AMD K6 enjoyed.

== Features ==

== Models ==

There were two revisions of the K5 architecture, internally called the SSA/5 and the 5k86, both released with the K5 label. The original set of &quot;SSA/5&quot; CPUs had its branch prediction unit disabled and additional internal waitstates added; these issues were remedied with the &quot;5k86&quot;, resulting in up to 30% better performance clock for clock. The &quot;SSA/5&quot; line ran from 75 to 100 MHz; the &quot;5k86&quot; line ran from 90 to 133 MHz. However, AMD used what it called a PR rating, or performance rating, to label the chips according to their suggested equivalence in integer performance to a Pentium of that clock speed. Thus, a 116 MHz chip from the second line was marketed as the &quot;K5 PR166&quot;. Manufacturing delays caused the PR200&#x27;s arrival to nearly align with the release of K6. Since AMD did not want the two chips competing, the K5-PR200 only arrived in small numbers.

<text>George Cassander (or Cassant) (1513 – 3 February 1566) was a Flemish Catholic theologian and humanist.

==Life==
Born at Pittem near Bruges, he went at an early age to Leuven, where he graduated in 1533. In 1541 he was appointed professor of belles-lettres at Bruges, but resigned two years later, partly from a natural desire to travel for instruction, and partly in consequence of the opposition aroused by his pro-Reformation views.

On his journeys, which were undertaken in the company, and at the expense of his friend, Cornelius Wouters, he visited Rome, and in 1544 came to Cologne, where he settled permanently in the summer of 1549. He soon abandoned the classics for the study of the Bible and ecclesiastical questions, and had already published several classical, Biblical, and patristic treatises, when in 1556 he commenced a series of liturgical works. After a profound study of the points of difference between the Catholic and reformed churches, he devoted himself to the project of reunion, thus anticipating the efforts of Gottfried Leibniz.

Jacques Auguste de Thou described Cassander as &quot;...modest, void of arrogance; and he was as ardent in his wishes for a religious union, and made as many concessions for the accomplishment for this object, as could be expected from a person who continued in the Catholic communion.&quot; 

He died at Cologne on 3 February 1566. The collected edition of his works was published in 1616 at Paris.

==Works==
Cassander&#x27;s activity in promoting religious peace between Catholics and Protestants began in 1561 with the publication of his anonymous book: &quot;De officio pii viri in hoc religionis dissidio&quot;. This work, written at the request of the jurist, François Baudouin, and submitted by him to the Colloquy of Poissy (Sept., 1561), gave offence to both sides. While holding that no one, on account of abuses, has a right utterly to subvert the Church, Cassander does not disguise his dislike of those who exaggerated the papal claims. He takes his standpoint on Scripture explained by tradition and the fathers of the first six centuries. He did not expect full reconciliation but proposed that Churches agree on &quot;the elements of Apostolic doctrine&quot;.

At a time when controversy drowned the voice of reason, such a book pleased neither party; but as some of the German princes thought that he could heal the breach, the emperor Ferdinand asked him to publish his &quot;Consultatio de Articulis Fidei lute, Catholicos et Protestantes Controversis&quot; (1565), in which, like Newman at a later date, he tried to put a Catholic interpretation upon the Augsburg Confession. Cassander proposed basing belief on Scripture as interpreted by the Fathers of the first six centuries where necessary in the case of doubtful texts. 

In 1564, Cassander went to Duisburg at the Emperor&#x27;s request to address the question of infant baptism and the Anabaptists. 

While never attacking dogma, and even favoring the Roman church on the ground of authority, he criticizes the papal power and makes reflections on practices. The work, attacked violently by the Leuven theologians on one side, and by Calvin and Beza on the other, was put on the Roman Index in 1617.
