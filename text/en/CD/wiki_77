<text>Janet Chisholm (6 May 1929 – 23 July 2004), born Janet Anne Deane, was a British MI6 agent during the Cold War.

==Early life==
She was born in Kasauli, India to a Royal Engineers officer. She was educated Queen Anne&#x27;s School, Caversham, in Berkshire, where she learnt Russian. She then studied French at Grenoble University. After school, she worked in London as a secretary before joining the Allied Control Commission and moving to West Germany. There she met her future husband, Ruari Chisholm, and began working for British Intelligence.

Her husband was a spy who headed the MI6 station in Moscow but worked under the guise of a visa officer. When Oleg Penkovsky offered Soviet military secrets to MI6, she became the go-between. Outwardly, Janet was an ordinary mother of four children. She would meet Penkovsky in a local park and he would offer what appeared to be sweets, but were actually disguised documents containing military secrets about the Soviet nuclear weapons arsenal.

Their cover was eventually blown by another British agent, George Blake, who defected to the Soviets. Penkovsky was quickly arrested and later executed, while the Chisholms were deported. Controversy surrounds Penkovsky&#x27;s death, with many believing that MI6 put him in danger after Blake confessed all to the Soviet officials. For their part, MI6 maintained that he insisted on continuing to feed the British information even after his life was threatened.

The Chisholms went on to work in Singapore and twice in South Africa until Ruari&#x27;s retirement. He had planned to write a memoir but died of malaria before he could begin. Janet continued to travel around the world until well into her 70s. She refused to talk about her experiences in Russia and took all of the secrets she learned to the grave.

==Portrayal in popular culture==
Chisholm was portrayed by Lucy Liemann in the 2007 BBC Television docudrama &quot;Nuclear Secrets&quot;. The programme included covert KGB photographs showing Janet Chisholm meeting Oleg Penkovsky.

<doc id="896839" wikidata="Q50805" url="?curid=896839" title="WrestleMania I">
<text>WrestleMania (sequentially known as WrestleMania I) was the inaugural WrestleMania and inaugural professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event (only in selected areas), produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on March 31, 1985, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The attendance for the event was 19,121. The event was seen by over one million viewers through closed-circuit television, making it the largest pay-per-view showing of a wrestling event on closed-circuit television in the United States at the time.

The event consisted of nine professional wrestling matches. In the main event, Hulk Hogan and Mr. T defeated Paul Orndorff and Roddy Piper. Also, Wendi Richter (accompanied by manager Cyndi Lauper) defeated Leilani Kai to win the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship, and Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik defeated The U.S. Express (Mike Rotundo and Barry Windham) to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. Celebrity guests included former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali as referee, baseball player/manager Billy Martin as ring announcer, and musician-actor Liberace as timekeeper.

==Production==

The attendance at the event was 19,121. In addition, the event was seen by over one million viewers through closed-circuit television, making it the largest wrestling event on closed-circuit television in the United States at the time. A technical glitch ended the closed circuit broadcast early into the showing at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. To appease angry fans who pelted the screen with garbage, WrestleMania was broadcast in its entirety on local ABC affiliate WTAE-TV two weeks later.

WWF announcer Gene Okerlund sang the national anthem, and Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura performed commentary. Okerlund also did interviews backstage, and Alfred Hayes did interviews near the entrance to the locker room, right outside the ring. Howard Finkel was the ring announcer. The opening theme for the event was the instrumental portion of the Phil Collins and Philip Bailey hit &quot;Easy Lover&quot;, while the closing theme for the credits was &quot;Axel F&quot; by Harold Faltermeyer. Celebrity guests in attendance included Billy Martin, Cyndi Lauper, Mr. T, Muhammad Ali, and Liberace accompanied by The Rockettes.

===Background===
During the 1980s, World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s main competition in the professional wrestling industry was from Jim Crockett Promotions. Vince McMahon countered Jim Crockett&#x27;s successful Starrcade annual events, which began airing in 1983, by creating the WrestleMania franchise. A rights agreement which Barry Diller, head of USA Network co-owner Paramount, pushed by 1983 also allowed for better access to programming at the Madison Square Garden, including on any regional pay television network.

For the first WrestleMania, McMahon began cross promoting with MTV, which aired two wrestling specials. The first one was &quot;The Brawl to End It All&quot;, aired on July 23, 1984, in which a match from a live Madison Square Garden broadcast was shown on MTV. Wendi Richter, allied with Cyndi Lauper, defeated The Fabulous Moolah, backed by Lou Albano, to win the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship on the card. At &quot;The War to Settle the Score&quot;, which aired on February 18, 1985, Leilani Kai, accompanied by Moolah, defeated Richter, again accompanied by Lauper, to win the Women&#x27;s Championship. Aside from Lauper, other celebrities also appeared during the buildup to and at the event; most notably Muhammad Ali, Liberace (with The Rockettes), and Major League Baseball manager Billy Martin all appeared during the main event.

WrestleMania would become considered the WWF&#x27;s flagship event. It has since become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. Following the advent of Survivor Series in 1987 and then Royal Rumble and SummerSlam in 1988—WWF&#x27;s four original pay-per-views—the four would eventually be dubbed the &quot;Big Four&quot;. WrestleMania would eventually be described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment.

===Storylines===

The card consisted of nine matches that resulted from scripted storylines. Three championships were defended at WrestleMania: the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship, WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship and the WWF World Tag Team Championship. 

Prior to the event, Greg &quot;The Hammer&quot; Valentine had feuded with Tito Santana over the Intercontinental Heavyweight belt. Valentine defeated Santana on September 24, 1984, for the championship. Mike Rotunda and Barry Windham won the WWF Tag Team Championship three months before WrestleMania from the team of Adrian Adonis and Dick Murdoch.

In the months leading up to the first WrestleMania, &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper began a talk-show segment on WWF television entitled &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot;. On one episode of the show, he hit Jimmy Snuka over the head with a coconut, leading to a feud between the two men. As part of the storyline, Piper recruited &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob Orton to be his bodyguard. On another episode of Piper&#x27;s Pit, Piper spoke out against the burgeoning Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling connection, which led to a confrontation with Hulk Hogan. In February 1985, the two men faced each other at &quot;The War to Settle the Score&quot;, where Hogan won by disqualification after interference by Paul Orndorff and Mr. T. Their on-going feud led to their match at WrestleMania.

As part of the promotion for the event, Hogan appeared on &quot;Hot Properties&quot; four days prior to WrestleMania, where he put host Richard Belzer into a front chinlock —a move that cuts off the flow of blood to the brain. Belzer, however, fell to the floor unconscious and began to bleed profusely. His injury required eight stitches. Belzer later sued Hogan for $5 million, but they eventually settled out of court. The night before WrestleMania, Hogan and Mr. T hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to help promote the event.

==Event==

===Preliminary matches===

Gene Okerlund opened the event by singing the national anthem. The originally intended singer, a celebrity guest that Okerlund and Vince McMahon refused to name, failed to appear.
The first match was between Tito Santana and The Executioner (Buddy Rose). Santana won the match after applying a figure four leglock on The Executioner, which was a shot at current Intercontinental Champion Greg Valentine, as the figure four was his finishing move as the first WrestleMania match ended in submission.

Following the match, King Kong Bundy (accompanied by Jimmy Hart) and Special Delivery Jones made their way to the ring. After crushing his opponent against the turnbuckle and landing on him stomach-first, Bundy pinned Jones. The WWF&#x27;s official time for the match is a then-record time of nine seconds (a record since surpassed by The Rock defeating Erick Rowan at WrestleMania 32), although the match actually lasted 24 seconds.

The next match was between Ricky Steamboat and Matt Borne. Steamboat took the early advantage in the match-up, until Borne flipped him over and slammed him to the mat using a belly-to-belly suplex. After performing a flying crossbody Steamboat pinned Borne for the win.

After the match ended, David Sammartino, accompanied by his father Bruno Sammartino, and Brutus Beefcake, accompanied by Johnny Valiant, made their way to the ring. The action favoured both contestants, as each wrestler alternated having the advantage. After Beefcake threw David Sammartino out of the ring, Valiant lifted him up and slammed him to the cement floor. He then pushed Sammartino back into the ring before being attacked by Bruno. A short while later, all four men began fighting in the ring, and the match ended in a no-contest.
The first championship defense of WrestleMania was between Junkyard Dog and the reigning WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Greg Valentine, who was accompanied to the ring by his manager Jimmy Hart. Junkyard Dog began the match in the offensive position, performing headbutts and punches on Valentine. As the action went back and forth, Hart climbed on the ring apron, where Valentine accidentally hit him. Later, Valentine pinned Junkyard Dog with his feet on the ropes for leverage, which is an illegal maneuver. As a result, Tito Santana ran down to the ring and explained to the referee what had happened and the match was restarted. Junkyard Dog eventually won the match by count-out as Valentine failed to re-enter the ring. Valentine, however, kept his title as titles do not change hands through count-out.
The following match was for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik, accompanied to the ring by Freddie Blassie, challenged the reigning champions, The U.S. Express (Mike Rotundo and Barry Windham), who were accompanied by Lou Albano. The U.S. Express dominated the early part of the match until Volkoff and The Sheik began to gain the offensive advantage over Rotundo. Rotundo then tagged in Windham, who performed a bulldog on The Sheik. After nearly being pinned, The Sheik hit Windham in the head with Blassie&#x27;s cane as the referee had his back turned. After Volkoff got the pin, Volkoff and The Sheik were crowned as the new tag champions, becoming the first people to win a championship at WrestleMania.

===Main events===
The next match on the card was a $15,000 Body Slam Challenge between André the Giant and Big John Studd, who was accompanied by Bobby Heenan. The stipulation of the match was that André the Giant had to body slam Studd to win $15,000, and if he failed, he would be forced to retire. After beginning the match in the defensive position, André countered with chops and a headbutt. From then on André controlled the match and after weakening Studd&#x27;s knees with multiple kicks, André was able to lift Studd over his shoulders and execute a body slam to win the match. After André collected his prize money, he started throwing the money out to the audience. Heenan, however, grabbed the bag holding the remainder of the winnings and ran from ringside. As a result of the match, André was able to continue his career and his WWF undefeated streak was unscathed.
After all the men had left ringside, it was time for the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship match between Wendi Richter, managed by singer Cyndi Lauper, and Leilani Kai, managed by former champion The Fabulous Moolah. Shortly after the match began, Moolah grabbed Richter as she was outside on the floor, but Lauper saved her from an attack. Kai then performed a flying crossbody from the top rope, but Richter used Kai&#x27;s momentum to roll-up Kai in a pinning position. With this pin, Richter became the new Women&#x27;s Champion.
The main event and last match of the night pitted Hulk Hogan, the reigning WWF World Heavyweight Champion, and Mr. T, accompanied by Jimmy Snuka, against &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper and &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; Paul Orndorff, accompanied by &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob Orton. Professional boxer Muhammad Ali was the special guest referee (on the outside of the ring), New York Yankees manager Billy Martin was the guest ring announcer while Liberace (accompanied by The Rockettes) was the guest time keeper. First, Piper, Orndorff, and Orton made their way to the ring as drums and bagpipes played, causing the crowd to boo. Crowd favorites Hogan, Mr. T, and Snuka made their way to the ring next. The match began with Mr. T and Piper in the ring and the two traded blows. Midway through the match, all four men began brawling in the ring, and Muhammad Ali punched Piper in an attempt to restore order. After the match&#x27;s order was restored, Orndorff and Piper had the offensive advantage. As Orndorff locked Hogan into a full nelson, Orton climbed the top rope to attempt to knock out Hogan. Instead, Orton mistakenly hit Orndorff, and Hogan pinned him to win the match. In frustration, Piper knocked out the in-ring official, Pat Patterson, before he and Orton retreated backstage leaving Orndorff alone in the ring with Hogan, Mr. T, and Snuka.

==Aftermath==
Approximately three months after WrestleMania, on July 6, 1985, Greg Valentine lost the Intercontinental Championship back to Tito Santana in a cage match. At about the same time, Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik lost the WWF Tag Team Championship back to The U.S. Express. They held the titles until August, when the team of Brutus Beefcake and Greg Valentine, later known as the Dream Team, became the new champions.
On July 8, 1985, Don Muraco won the inaugural King of The Ring tournament by defeating the Iron Sheik in the finals. 
After André the Giant defeated Big John Studd at the event, Studd formed a tag team with King Kong Bundy, and the duo faced André and Hulk Hogan on a number of occasions. Later, the team of Studd and Bundy teamed up in Handicap matches—a two against one wrestling match—against André, which renewed the feud between André and Studd.

In late 1985, Wendi Richter lost her WWF Women&#x27;s Championship in controversial fashion. She wrestled a masked female wrestler known as The Spider Lady, who pinned Richter to win the title. After the match, the Spider Lady was revealed as the Fabulous Moolah. This finish was a screwjob, i.e. one participant (in this case Richter) was unaware of the planned title change. Richter left the WWF shortly after, and Moolah held the title for approximately two years.

In a new storyline after WrestleMania, Roddy Piper began training Bob Orton as a boxer. Hulk Hogan accepted a challenge on the behalf of Mr. T to face Orton in a match on the February 15, 1986 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event V&quot;. After Mr. T won the match, Orton and Piper attacked him, leading to a boxing match at WrestleMania 2 between Piper and Mr. T. At the second annual WrestleMania, Piper was disqualified in the Fourth round.

The main event of WrestleMania would also be the last time that a tag team match would main event the show until WrestleMania 39 in 2023 when Jimmy and Jey Uso defended the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship against Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn in the main event of Night 1, in what would be the first time a tag team championship would be defended in the main event.

==Reception==
John Powell of &quot;Slam! Wrestling&quot; rated the event as average, citing that it &quot;wasn&#x27;t the greatest&quot;. Despite his overall rating, he praised several moments, including Orton hitting Orndorff with his cast, King Kong Bundy&#x27;s win, and André the Giant throwing the money into the crowd. Powell listed Mr. T wrestling as his least favorite moment of the pay-per-view, saying the main event match, in which Mr. T took part, was humorous despite its lack of technical wrestling. &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; awarded the main event match its annual PWI Match of the Year honor. The event was included in a July 2007 special that aired on the MSG Network titled &quot;The 50 Greatest Moments at Madison Square Garden&quot;, ranking at No. 30.

In the December 2002 issue of &quot;Wrestling Digest&quot;, the main event match-up was listed as number five in the most memorable twenty-five matches of the past twenty-five years. Echoing John Powell&#x27;s thoughts, Kevin Eck of &quot;Wrestling Digest&quot; stated, &quot;The match itself was far from a technical-wrestling classic, but it delivered in terms of entertaining the crowd.&quot; In another &quot;Wrestling Digest&quot; article, written by Keith Loria, the main event was ranked third in the top ten matches in WrestleMania history. In contrast to Powell, Loria believed that Mr. T &quot;proved to be an adequate grappler&quot;.

==Results==

The WWF&#x27;s official time for the match is a then-record time of nine seconds (a record since surpassed by The Rock defeating Erick Rowan at WrestleMania 32), although the match actually lasted 24 seconds.

<text>In psychology, a projective test is a personality test designed to let a person respond to ambiguous stimuli, presumably revealing hidden emotions and internal conflicts projected by the person into the test. This is sometimes contrasted with a so-called &quot;objective test&quot; / &quot;self-report test&quot;, which adopt a &quot;structured&quot; approach as responses are analyzed according to a presumed universal standard (for example, a multiple choice exam), and are limited to the content of the test. The responses to projective tests are content analyzed for meaning rather than being based on presuppositions about meaning, as is the case with objective tests. Projective tests have their origins in psychoanalysis, which argues that humans have conscious and unconscious attitudes and motivations that are beyond or hidden from conscious awareness.

==Theory==
The general theoretical position behind projective tests is that whenever a specific question is asked, the response will be consciously formulated and socially determined. These responses do not reflect the respondent&#x27;s unconscious or implicit attitudes or motivations. The respondent&#x27;s deep-seated motivations may not be consciously recognized by the respondent or the respondent may not be able to verbally express them in the form and structure demanded by the questioner. Advocates of projective tests stress that the ambiguity of the stimuli presented within the tests allow subjects to express thoughts that originate on a deeper level than tapped by explicit questions, and provide content that may not be captured by responsive tools that lacks appropriate items. After some decrease in interest in the 1980s and 1990s, newer research suggesting that implicit motivation is best captured in this way has increased the research and use of these tools.

==Projective hypothesis==
This holds that an individual puts structure on an ambiguous situation in a way that is consistent with their own conscious and unconscious needs. It is an indirect method- testee is talking about something that comes spontaneously from the self without conscious awareness or editing.
*Reduces temptation to fake 
*Does not depend as much on verbal abilities 
*Taps both conscious and unconscious traits 
*Focus is clinical perspective - not normative - but has developed norms over the years

==Common variants==
===Rorschach===

The best known and most frequently used projective test is the Rorschach inkblot test. This test was originally developed in 1921 to diagnose schizophrenia. Subjects are shown a series of ten irregular but symmetrical inkblots, and asked to explain what they see. The subject&#x27;s responses are then analyzed in various ways, noting not only what was said, but the time taken to respond, which aspect of the drawing was focused on, and how individual responses compared to other responses for the same drawing. It is important that the Rorschach test and other projective tests be conducted by experienced professionals to ensure validity and consistency of results. The Rorschach was commonly scored using the Comprehensive System (CS), until the development of the newer scoring system, the Rorschach Performance Assessment System (R-PAS) in 2011. In an influential review, the Rorschach Inkblot Test using the CS method has been labeled as a &quot;problematic instrument&quot; in terms of its psychometric properties.

The new scoring system has stronger psychometric properties than the CS, and, like the CS, allows for a standardized administration of the test which is something that is lacking in a majority of projective measures. Additional psychometric strengths present with the R-PAS include updated normative data. The norms from the CS were updated to also include protocols from 15 other countries, resulting in updated international norms. The CS international norm data set was based on fewer countries, most of which were European only. The new international norms provide a better representation of the Western hemisphere and westernized countries. Concerning differences in administration of the task across both scoring systems, a critical issue with CS administration was addressed in the development of the R-PAS. Following CS administration procedure, it was common to obtain too few or too many responses per card which could result in an invalidated protocol (due to too few responses) or in error. The new administration procedure introduced in the R-PAS requires the clinician to initially tell the examinee that they should provide two or three responses per card, and allows the clinician to prompt for additional responses if too few are given, or to pull cards away if too many are given. Therefore, the new administration procedure addresses the critical issue of number of responses that was prevalent with use of the CS administration procedure. The CS administration procedure prevented clinicians from prompting for more responses or pulling cards when too many responses were provided. An additional psychometric improvement concerns the presentation of obtained scores. With the R-PAS system, it is now possible to change scores to percentiles and convert percentiles to standard scores which can be presented visually and allow for easy comparison to the normative data. With the CS, this was not possible and it was more difficult to compare results to normative comparison groups. Lastly, the R-PAS scores have been shown to possess similar and sometimes stronger inter-rater reliability than was seen in scores from the CS. This means that when different clinicians score the same protocol, they are quite likely to derive the same interpretations and scores.

===Holtzman Inkblot Test===

This is a variation of the Rorschach test, but uses a much larger pool of different images. Its main differences lie in its objective scoring criteria as well as limiting subjects to one response per inkblot (to avoid variable response productivity). Different variables such as reaction time are scored for an individual&#x27;s response upon seeing an inkblot.

===Thematic apperception test===

Another popular projective test is the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) in which an individual views ambiguous scenes of people, and is asked to describe various aspects of the scene; for example, the subject may be asked to describe what led up to this scene, the emotions of the characters, and what might happen afterwards. A clinician will evaluate these descriptions, attempting to discover the conflicts, motivations and attitudes of the respondent. A researcher may use a specific scoring system that establishes consistent criteria of expressed thoughts and described behaviors associated with a specific trait, e.g., the need for Achievement, which has a validated and reliable scoring system. In the answers, the respondent &quot;projects&quot; their unconscious attitudes and motivations into the picture, which is why these are referred to as &quot;projective tests.&quot; Although the TAT is a commonly used psychological assessment instrument, its validity as a personality assessment test has been questioned. In contrast, it has high reliability and validity when used in research with larger samples.

===Draw-A-Person test===

The Draw-A-Person test requires the subject to draw a person. The results are based on a psychodynamic interpretation of the details of the drawing, such as the size, shape and complexity of the facial features, clothing and background of the figure. As with other projective tests, the approach has very little demonstrated validity and there is evidence that therapists may attribute pathology to individuals who are merely poor artists. A popular review has concluded that its scientific status &quot;can best be declared as weak&quot;. A similar class of techniques is kinetic family drawing.

===Animal Metaphor Test===

The Animal Metaphor test consists of a series of creative and analytical prompts in which the person filling out the test is asked to create a story and then interpret its personal significance. Unlike conventional projective tests, the Animal Metaphor Test works as both a diagnostic and therapeutic battery. Unlike the Rorschach test and TAT, the Animal Metaphor is premised on self-analysis via self-report questions. The test combines facets of art therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and insight therapy, while also providing a theoretical platform of behavioral analysis. The test has been used widely as a clinical tool, as an educational assessment, and in human resource selection. The test is accompanied by an inventory, The Relational Modality Evaluation Scale, a self-report measure that targets individuals&#x27; particular ways of resolving conflict and ways of dealing with relational stress. These tests were developed by Dr. Albert J Levis at the Center for the Study of Normative Behavior in Hamden, CT, a clinical training and research center.

===Sentence completion test===

Sentence completion tests require the subject to complete sentence &quot;stems&quot; with their own words. The subject&#x27;s response is considered to be a projection of their conscious and/or unconscious attitudes, personality characteristics, motivations, and beliefs. However, there is evidence that sentence completion tests elicit learned associations rather than unconscious attitudes. Thus, respondents answer &quot;black&quot; when presented with the word, &quot;white,&quot; or &quot;father&quot; when presented with the word &quot;mother,&quot; according to Soley and Smith.

===Picture Arrangement Test===

Created by Silvan Tomkins, this psychological test consists of 25 sets of 3 pictures which the subject must arrange into a sequence that they &quot;feel makes the best sense&quot;. The reliability of this test has been disputed, however. For example, patients with schizophrenia have been found to score as more &quot;normal&quot; than patients with no such mental disorders.
Other picture tests include:
* Thompson version
* CAT (animals) and CAT-H (humans) 
* Senior AT 
* Blacky pictures test - dogs
* Picture Story Test - adolescents 
* Education Apperception Test -attitudes towards learning 
* Michigan Picture Test - children 8–14 
* TEMAS - Hispanic children
* Make-A-Picture-Story (MAPS) - make own pictures from figures, 6 years and older

===Word Association Test===
Word association testing is a technique developed by Carl Jung to explore complexes in the personal unconscious. Jung came to recognize the existence of groups of thoughts, feelings, memories, and perceptions, organized around a central theme, that he termed psychological complexes. This discovery was related to his research into word association, a technique whereby words presented to patients elicit other word responses that reflect related concepts in the patients&#x27; psyche, thus providing clues to their unique psychological make-up 

===Graphology===

Graphology is the pseudoscientific analysis of the physical characteristics and patterns of handwriting purporting to be able to identify the writer, indicating psychological state at the time of writing, or evaluating personality characteristics.

Graphology has been controversial for more than a century. Although supporters point to the anecdotal evidence of positive testimonials as a reason to use it for personality evaluation, most empirical studies fail to show the validity claimed by its supporters.

The Teste Palográfico (Palographic Test) is a personality test used frequently in Brazil.

==Validity==
Projective tests are criticized from the perspective of statistical validity and psychometrics. Most of the supporting studies on the validity of projective tests are poor or outdated. Proponents of projective tests claim there is a discrepancy between statistical validity and clinical validity.

In the case of clinical use, they rely heavily on clinical judgment, lack statistical reliability and statistical validity and many have no standardized criteria to which results may be compared, however this is not always the case. These tests are used frequently, though the scientific evidence is sometimes debated. There have been many empirical studies based on projective tests (including the use of standardized norms and samples), particularly more established tests. The criticism of lack of scientific evidence to support them and their continued popularity has been referred to as the &quot;projective paradox&quot;.

Responding to the statistical criticism of his projective test, Leopold Szondi said that his test actually discovers &quot;fate and existential possibilities hidden in the inherited familial unconscious and the personal unconscious, even those hidden because never lived through or because have been rejected. Is any statistical method able to span, understand and integrate mathematically all these possibilities? I deny this categorically.&quot;

Other research, however, has established that projective tests measure things that responsive tests do not, though it is theoretically possible to combine the two, e.g., Spangler, 1992. Decades of works by advocates, e.g., David C. McClelland, David Winter, Abigail Stewart, and, more recently, Oliver Schultheiss, have shown clear validity for these tools for certain personality traits, most especially implicit motivation (as contrasted with self-attributed or &quot;explicit&quot; motivation, which are conscious states), and that criticisms of projective tools based on techniques used for responsive tools is simply an inappropriate method of measurement. Moreover, Soley and Smith report that when used with larger Ns in research, as opposed to the clinical assessment of an individual, projective tests can exhibit high validity and reliability.

==Concerns==
===Assumptions===
*The more unstructured the stimuli, the more examinees reveal about their personality.
*Projection is greater to stimulus material that is similar to the examinee
*There is an &quot;unconscious.&quot;
*Subjects are unaware of what they disclose
*Provides information about personality that is not obtainable through self-report measures
*Subjects are projecting their personality onto the ambiguous stimuli they are interpreting

===Situation Variables===
*Age of examiner
*Specific instructions
*Subtle reinforcement cues
*Setting/privacy 

==Terminology==
In 2006 the terms &quot;objective test&quot; and &quot;projective test&quot; came under criticism in the &quot;Journal of Personality Assessment.&quot; The more descriptive &quot;rating scale or self-report measures&quot; and &quot;free response measures&quot; are suggested, rather than the terms &quot;objective tests&quot; and &quot;projective tests,&quot; respectively. Additionally, there are inherent biases implied in the terminology itself. For example, when individuals use the term &quot;objective&quot; to describe a test, it is assumed that the test possess accuracy and precision. Conversely, when the term &quot;projective&quot; is used to describe a test, it is assumed that these measures are less accurate. Neither of these assumptions are fully accurate, and have led researchers to develop alternative terminology to describe various projective measures. For example, it has been proposed that the Rorschach be labeled as a &quot;behavioral task&quot; due to its ability to provide an in vivo or real life sample of human behavior. It is easy to forget that both objective and projective tests are capable of producing objective data, and both require some form of subjective interpretation from the examiner. Objective testing, such as self-report measures, like the MMPI-2, require objective responses from the examinee and subjective interpretations from the examiner. Projective testing, such as the Rorschach, requires subjective responses from the examinee, and can in theory involve objective (actuarial) interpretation.

==Uses in marketing==
Projective techniques, including TATs, are used in qualitative marketing research, for example to help identify potential associations between brand images and the emotions they may provoke. In advertising, projective tests are used to evaluate responses to advertisements. The tests have also been used in management to assess achievement motivation and other drives, in sociology to assess the adoption of innovations, and in anthropology to study cultural meaning. The application of responses is different in these disciplines than in psychology, because the responses of multiple respondents are grouped together for analysis by the organisation commissioning the research, rather than interpreting the meaning of the responses given by a single subject.

==Uses in business==
Projective techniques are used extensively in people assessment; besides variants of the TAT, which are used to identify implicit motive patterns, the Behavioral Event Interview pioneered by American psychologist David McClelland and many of its related approaches (such as the Critical Incident Interview, the Behavioral Interview, and so on) is fundamentally a projective tool in that it invites someone to tell a specific story about recent actions they took, but does not ask leading questions or questions with yes or no answers.

<doc id="896847" wikidata="Q1508161" url="?curid=896847" title="George Rennie (sculptor)">
<text>George Rennie (23 April 1801 – 22 March 1860) was a Scottish sculptor, and Member of Parliament (MP) for Ipswich, and patron of the arts, who served as Governor of the Falkland Islands between 1847 and 1855.

==Life==
George Rennie was born on 23 April 1801 in Phantassie, East Lothian, Scotland, to the agriculturist George Rennie by Marion Rennie (maiden name). He was a nephew of the engineer John Rennie.

Rennie studied sculpture in Rome before he returned to Britain to exhibit statues and busts at the Royal Academy, and three times at the Suffolk Street Gallery, from 1828 to 1837. His most important works at the academy were: &quot;A Gleaner&quot; and &quot;Grecian Archer&quot; (both 1828); &quot;Cupid and Hymen&quot; (which depicts Cupid blowing the torch of Hymen) which is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum; and busts of Bertel Thorvaldsen and his uncle John Rennie (1831). His commended 1833 works included: &quot;The Archer&quot; (which he afterwards presented to the Athenaeum Club, London, and a bust of the artist David Wilkie. He exhibited &quot;The Minstrel&quot; in 1834. Rennie&#x27;s 1836 suggestion to Sir William Ewart that he form a Parliamentary Committee provoked the creation of schools of design at Somerset House. He assisted the efforts of Joseph Hume to obtain public freedom of access to all monuments and works of art that were in public either buildings or museums.

Rennie from 1841 to 1842 was Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Ipswich. His election was in May 1842 voided, and he in May 1842 withdrew from the 1847 general election to enable the election of Hugh Adair. He in 1842 proposed the &#x27;New Edinburgh&#x27; for a Scottish settlement in New Zealand, the development of which is now called Dunedin. Rennie on 15 December 1847, was invested as Governor of the Falkland Islands, from which he returned to England in 1855. He died in London on 22 March 1860.

Rennie&#x27;s sons included: Richard Rennie, Chief Justice of the British Supreme Court for China and Japan; and William Hepburn Rennie, Auditor-General of Hong Kong and Lieutenant-Governor of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

<doc id="896857" wikidata="Q3064497" url="?curid=896857" title="Hayward Fault Zone">
<text>The Hayward Fault Zone is a right-lateral strike-slip geologic fault zone capable of generating destructive earthquakes. The fault was first named in the Lawson Report of the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake in recognition of its involvement in the earthquake of 1868. This fault is about long, situated mainly along the western base of the hills on the east side of San Francisco Bay. It runs through densely populated areas, including Richmond, El Cerrito, Berkeley, Oakland, San Leandro, Castro Valley, Hayward, Union City, Fremont, and San Jose.

The Hayward Fault is parallel to the San Andreas Fault, which lies offshore and through the San Francisco Peninsula. To the east of the Hayward Fault lies the Calaveras Fault. In 2007, the Hayward Fault was discovered to have merged with the Calaveras Fault east of San Jose at a depth of , with the potential of creating earthquakes much larger than previously anticipated. Some geologists have suggested that the Southern Calaveras should be renamed as the Southern Hayward.

North of San Pablo Bay is the Rodgers Creek Fault, which was shown in 2016 to be linked with the Hayward Fault under San Pablo Bay to form a combined Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault that is long, stretching from north of Healdsburg through Santa Rosa down to Alum Rock in San Jose. Another fault further north, the Maacama Fault, is also considered to be part of the &quot;Hayward Fault subsystem&quot;.

While the San Andreas Fault is the principal transform boundary between the Pacific plate and the North American plate, the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault takes up its share of the overall displacement of the two plates.

==Tectonic setting==

The Pacific plate is a major section of the Earth&#x27;s crust, gradually expanding by the eruption of magma along the East Pacific Rise to the southeast. It is also being subducted far to the northwest into the Aleutian Trench. In California, the plate is sliding northwestward along a transform boundary, the San Andreas Fault, toward the subduction zone. At the same time, the North American plate is moving southwestward relative to the Earth&#x27;s core, but southeastward relative to the Pacific plate, due to the latter&#x27;s much faster northwestward motion. The westward component of the North American plate&#x27;s motion results in some compressive force along the San Andreas and its associated faults, thus helping lift the Pacific Coast Ranges and other parallel inland ranges to the west of the Central Valley, in this region most notably the Diablo Range. The Hayward Fault shares the same relative motions of the San Andreas. As with portions of other faults, a large extent of the Hayward Fault trace is formed from a narrow complex zone of deformation which can span hundreds of feet in width.

The transform boundary defined by the San Andreas Fault is not perfectly straight, and the stresses between the Pacific and North American plates are diffused over a wide region of the West, extending as far as the Walker Lane east of the Sierra Nevada. The Hayward Fault is one of the secondary faults in this diffuse zone, along with the Calaveras Fault to the east and the San Gregorio Fault, west of the San Andreas.

The complete fault zone, including the Rodgers Creek fault, is divided by seismologists into three segments – Rodgers Creek, Northern Hayward, and Southern Hayward. It is expected that these segments may fail singly or in adjacent pairs, creating earthquakes of varying magnitude. The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) in concert with other government agencies has sponsored the analysis of local conditions and the preparation of maps indicative of the destructive potential of these earthquakes. The various ABAG maps shown below represent some of the more likely possible combinations.

While there are indications that a substantial earthquake on a nearby parallel fault can release stress and so also decrease the near-term probability of an earthquake, the opposite appears to be true concerning sequential segments. A release on a major segment can substantially increase the likelihood of an earthquake on an adjacent fault segment, increasing the likelihood of two major regional earthquakes within a period of a few months.

===Rodgers Creek Fault Zone===
The connection between the Rodgers Creek Fault Zone and the Hayward Fault Zone was unclear until 2015 when a survey of the floor of San Pablo Bay found that the ends of the two faults were smoothly linked between Point Pinole and Lower Tubbs Island. An alternate prior hypothesis suggested that the Hayward Fault and Rodgers Creek Fault were probably connected by a series of &quot;en echelon&quot; fault strands beneath San Pablo Bay. The new finding means that the Rodgers-Hayward system together could produce a quake with a magnitude as high as 7.2. It is also considered possible that a major seismic event on either fault may involve movement on the other, either concurrently or within an interval of up to several months. The Association of Bay Area Governments has prepared ground shaking maps that include a possible concurrent scenario (these are shown below).

In October 2016, scientists found definitive evidence that the Rodgers Creek Fault and the Hayward Fault are linked together under San Pablo Bay. A simultaneous rupture of the connected Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault – about 118 mi (190 km) long from just north of Healdsburg down to Alum Rock in San Jose – could result in a major earthquake of magnitude 7.4 that &quot;would cause extensive damage and loss of life with global economic impact&quot;. It has been suggested that the name &quot;Rodgers Creek Fault&quot; be retired and that the entire 118 mi (190 km) fault be known as the &quot;Hayward Fault&quot;.

===Calaveras Fault===

The Calaveras Fault is continuous from the Sunol area south to Hollister. It was long believed that there was no connection between the Hayward Fault and the Calaveras, but geological studies (particularly the examination of very small and deep earthquakes) suggest that the two may be connected. If true, this link would have significant implications for the potential maximum strength of earthquakes on the Hayward, since this strength is determined by the maximum length of the fault rupture and this rupture could extend beyond the juncture point and so include some portion of the Calaveras. (This potential is not shown in the shake intensity maps shown below.)

==Earthquakes==

The largest quake on the Hayward Fault in &quot;recorded&quot; history occurred in 1868, with an estimated magnitude of 7.0. It occurred on the southern segment of the fault, receiving its name (some decades later) from the nascent town of Hayward where it was determined the quake&#x27;s epicenter was located. However, the 1868 quake caused much damage throughout the then sparsely settled Bay Area, including the city of San Francisco. In fact, the 1868 event became known as the &quot;Great San Francisco earthquake&quot; until the larger tremor in 1906.

Many seismologists believe that the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which occurred on the San Andreas fault, reduced the stress on many faults in the Bay Area including the Hayward fault, creating an &quot;earthquake shadow&quot;: a quiescent period following a major earthquake. Since the 1906 San Andreas event there have been no moderately strong earthquakes on the Hayward fault as were seen before that earthquake. It also appears likely that this quiet period in the earthquake shadow is ending, as projected by the rate of plate motion and the stress state of other faults in the region.

The 1868 earthquake occurred well before the East Bay region was extensively urbanized. The following year, in 1869, the William Meek Estate became one of the first developments in the area, built on 3,000 acres (12 km2) in what became known as the Cherryland district of Eden Township. Recent renovations of the Meek Mansion have revealed that with the 1868 earthquake still fresh in minds of residents of the time, some unusual diagonal bracing was built into the original construction. Although its magnitude was less than the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the intensity of shaking experienced in the Hayward area may have been greater than in 1906 due to the proximity of the Hayward Fault.

Earlier earthquakes have been detected by trench exposure and associated radiocarbon dating. Combined with the historic record, the last five major events were in 1315, 1470, 1630, 1725, and 1868, which have intervals of about 140 years (note that 2018 is 150 years from the major 1868 event). The longest time was the 160-year period between 1470 and 1630. In 2028, it will have been 160 years since the 1868 event.

==Probability of future activity==
United States Geological Survey (USGS) scientists state that a major earthquake occurring on the zone is &quot;increasingly likely&quot;. When the next major earthquake occurs on the fault, damage will be catastrophic. More than 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars in property exists in the affected area, and more than 165 billion US dollars in damage would likely result if the 1868 earthquake were to reoccur. Since the fault runs through heavily populated areas, more than 5 million would be affected directly. Water could be cut off to 2.4 million people living in California&#x27;s San Francisco Bay Area.

For the thirty years following 2014, the probability of there being one or more magnitude 6.7+ earthquakes on the Hayward Fault during that time frame was estimated at 14.3 percent. This is compared to 6.4 percent for the San Andreas Fault, which can have larger earthquakes but is farther away from a significant portion of the urbanized parts of the Bay Area. Earlier (January 2008) assessments suggest that the Hayward, Rodgers Creek, and Calaveras faults may be more likely to fail in the next few decades than previously thought.

The 140th anniversary of the 1868 event was in 2008, and the average time between the last five major events is also averaged at 140 years. Recent estimates of the damage potential of a major Hayward Fault earthquake by a professional risk management firm indicate the potential for huge economic losses, of which only a small percentage is insured against earth movement. (Earthquake insurance is not only quite expensive, it tends to be burdened with large deductibles – at least 15 percent).

Depending upon seasonal weather conditions at the time of a major event a seismic event could be followed by urban wildfires compounded by damage to water systems or massive landslides in saturated soils. In addition to direct damage the effects on commerce due to damaged infrastructure would also be substantial. Experience with large area urban destruction such as caused by earthquake, hurricane, and firestorms has shown that complete rebuilding can take up to a decade, owing to various factors.

The progressively more severe reports and estimates of event probability and consequences have awakened a broad interest in training people for emergency response. It is becoming widely understood that professional fire fighting, police, and medical services will be overwhelmed by a major event and that neighbors will have to assist each other as best they can. Several jurisdictions in the affected area have implemented volunteer Community emergency response team programs to augment the professional response services.

In 2012, USGS scientists said the fault was due for another magnitude 6.8 to 7.0 earthquake, with the California Geological Survey concurring, stating they believe there is a 31 percent chance of a magnitude-6.7 earthquake or greater along the Rodgers Creek-Hayward Fault in the next 30 years.

In March 2015, the United States Geological Survey released &quot;UCERF3: A New Earthquake Forecast for California&#x27;s Complex Fault System&quot;. The UCERF3 represents the best available science to date, and it now considers &quot;multifault ruptures&quot; and &quot;fault readiness&quot;, in addition to historical seismicity, in the calculus of earthquake forecasting. The upshot, for those who live in the San Francisco Bay Area, is that experts say there is a 72% chance of experiencing a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake before 2045. Moreover, they had a 51% chance of a M≥7 (threshold to be considered a &quot;major&quot; quake), a 20% chance of a M≥7.5 and a 4% chance of a M≥8 (a &quot;great&quot; quake) when all the mapped faults in the region are taken in to account.

==Fault effects==
===Fault creep===

The surface of the fault is creeping at less than 0.5 cm (0.2 in) per year in the regions of concern. Extreme southern regions of the fault are creeping more quickly, perhaps sufficiently to prevent fault rupture there, but mostly the creep is insufficient to relieve the accumulating forces upon most of the fault and so will not prevent a large earthquake. The creep is sufficient to displace roads, curbs, and sidewalks and so visibly reveal the surface trace in many locations. Creep damage to asphalt road surfaces will usually appear as a series of echelon cracks. Creep effects may be seen also in older structures crossing the fault, some of which have been fitted with expansion joints to accommodate this slow motion.

===Earthquake shaking===
The magnitude of an earthquake, as indicated on a seismic scale, is roughly proportional to the length of the rupture, while the ground motion in the region surrounding the fault is highly dependent upon the local soil conditions, somewhat upon the distance and relationship to the progression of the fault rupture, and (as recently recognized in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake) reflected energy from deep discontinuities in the Earth&#x27;s structure. The area affected by an earthquake is also dependent upon the density and uniformity of the soils surrounding the fault.
:*Recent examination of damage reports from the 1868 event suggest that the rupture over only portions of the Northern and Southern Hayward fault could generate a magnitude 7.0 event, far more powerful than either the 6.5 event shown here or the 6.7 previously recognized as a likely maximum.
:&quot;The terms used by ABAG for shaking intensity differ from the official descriptions of the Mercalli intensity scale, being somewhat softened (perhaps due to the extensive local experience with earthquakes), with terms such as &quot;Rather Strong&quot; becoming &quot;Light&quot;, and &quot;Ruinous&quot; and &quot;Disastrous&quot; becoming variations of &quot;Violent&quot;.

====Bayside soil conditions====

The Hayward fault is considered to be particularly dangerous due to the poor soil conditions in the alluvial plain that drops from the East Bay Hills to the eastern shoreline of San Francisco Bay. At the lower elevations near the bay the soil is mostly water saturated mud and sand, placed in the early 20th century as fill in marsh areas. This soil tends to amplify the effects of an earthquake and so producing significantly greater ground motion. Additionally, the soil itself can fail, turning into a liquid mud from the agitation, a mud unable to support buildings erected upon once-firm soil. This region is also covered with dense low-rise urban development, most of which was built soon after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and long before even moderately earthquake resistant construction practices had been developed in the late 1920s.

Further improvement in the construction of resistant structures and the development of retrofitting method have only recently been developed, largely in response to the effects of the 1971 Sylmar, 1989 Loma Prieta, and 1994 Northridge events in California – none of which were hugely catastrophic, but each of which caused loss of life in structures not thought to be vulnerable, and so increased public, engineering, and government awareness of the need for specific remediations and construction methods required for improved life safety.

Although many structures have undergone seismic retrofitting there are a large number of dangerous unreinforced masonry (mostly brick) structures and chimneys, which can be extremely hazardous to occupants in a large earthquake, and a large number of buildings which are either not bolted to their foundations or with soft stories that are insufficiently resistant to shear forces. Foundation and soft story weaknesses are easily remediated in most cases, but this is only effective if the work is competently done, with proper attention to minor details such as nailing patterns and proper connections. Local surveys of recently completed work have exposed deficient workmanship in a number of cases involving household retrofits.

====Landslides====

There are many small active landslides and evidence of numerous large archaic landslides in the Berkeley Hills. Such areas may be stable only under present conditions. There is the possibility that a large earthquake could trigger very large earth flows, particularly if the soils are seasonally saturated with water, possibly rendering extensive areas unbuildable. (See the Virtual tour – Google Earth Flyover below.)

===Potentially impacted structures and features===
Many structures near the bay shore on either side would probably be severely affected by either a major Hayward Fault rupture or a nearby San Andreas Fault rupture. Severe effects were seen in both Oakland and northern San Francisco from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, even though this event was not extremely large and was centered a significant distance away in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Most of the severe effects of that event were due to poorly responding soil conditions and design deficiencies in large structures. Only a portion of the structural deficiencies in the larger area have been addressed, and the surface motion effects of a large event are likely to be far more severe than seen in the Loma Prieta event.

====Freeways and overcrossings====
Many modifications have been made to freeway structures to reduce life hazards during seismic events. Significant adverse conditions remain which can cause disruption with possible long-term effects upon critical traffic infrastructure despite these modifications.

Warren Freeway portion of Highway 13

In its northern extent, the Hayward Fault lies directly beneath the portion of Highway 13 (the &quot;Warren Freeway&quot;) that is south of its intersection with Highway 24 and north of its terminal connection with Interstate 580 (the &quot;MacArthur Freeway&quot;). In this rift valley there are a number of elevated street crossings in the Montclair District that cross the fault.

Highway 24

State Highway 24, connecting Oakland to Orinda, Lafayette, and Walnut Creek through the Caldecott Tunnel, is composed of extensive earth fill at the location where the fault is crossed. An earthquake may cause minor landsliding on some slopes of the freeway, and the plastic movement of the fill would likely disrupt the pavement if the movement here of the surface displacement is substantial, possibly presenting a hazard to motorists and shutting down the highway for a while. More extensive disruption and greater hazard could be caused by the failure of elevated structures, both those over which the highway passes and overcrossings of the freeway, of which there are two nearby. As elsewhere in the area, such structures have undergone extensive retrofitting for safety.

Highways 80 and 880 and the Port of Oakland

A severe earthquake is likely to disable the offshore causeway portions of Interstate Highway 80 (the Eastshore Freeway), since it is built on fill placed in the 1930s atop mudflats whose upper layers were deposited in the 19th century as a result of extensive hydraulic gold mining in the distant Sierra Nevada mountain foothills. This soft mud is expected to amplify earthquake shaking, and the mud supporting the heavy fill may liquefy, and so possibly cause major disruption of the highway due to failure by sinking of the highway and by differential movement of large sections. (More modern construction for these conditions employs linked and &quot;floating&quot; – in mud – lightweight concrete and plastic foam box structures to support a road.) Similar conditions underlie the eastern approach roads to the Bay Bridge. Better, but still locally poor soils underlie the portion of Interstate Highway 880 that extends to the South Bay region from the MacArthur Maze. As the bulk of cargo containers from the Port of Oakland travel on these two roads, the disabling of both would cause severe disruption of West Coast import and export goods, owing to the consequent overloading of other West Coast container handling ports.

Highway 580

A major route for commuters traveling from Southern Alameda County, the San Joaquin Valley and the East Bay hills to downtown Oakland and San Francisco, Interstate 580 crosses the fault, and runs very close to the fault between the intersections with State Route 13 (the Warren Freeway) and Interstate 238.

====San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge====

The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake caused a failure of a single section of the upper deck of the eastern span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, which closed the bridge for 30 days. A replacement of the eastern span was completed in August 2013. Engineers and much of the public had long recognized that a strong earthquake centered close to the bridge on either the Hayward or San Andreas faults could cause a complete collapse of the eastern span.

====Railroads====
Parallel to the Eastshore Freeway and inland only two blocks is a four-track railroad route used for general freight traffic, including that generated by the Port of Oakland (Union Pacific and BNSF railroads) and by Amtrak passenger traffic to the Pacific Northwest and eastward through Reno and Salt Lake City. Along the north shore of Contra Costa County, substantial amounts of pressurized liquid gas, flammable liquids, caustic materials, and various toxics are stored temporarily in bulk railcars adjacent to passenger and freight traffic mainlines, with great potential hazards should a derailment occur. Derailments have often occurred during major earthquakes, both directly by tipping and by roadbed failures; industrial accidents involving these materials have caused extensive health hazards in the mixed residential–industrial areas of Richmond.

====Bay Area Rapid Transit====
In addition to extensive modifications to over crossings and elevated structures, largely to prevent dismantling due to shaking or destruction by soil failure, several other unique system feature require special treatment.

Transbay tube

BART trains travel between San Francisco and Oakland through an underwater tube structure. The tube is composed of welded plate steel segments. Each oval outer section carries two inner train tubes of circular cross section and a central rectangular access and rescue tunnel, with the void between elements filled with concrete. The segments were sunk into a ditch dredged through bay mud and covered with rock fill, and then pumped free of water upon completion, making the resulting tube somewhat buoyant, but held in place with a rock overfill. Subsequent seismic analysis indicated the possibility that the overfill could fail due to agitation, allowing the buoyant tube to float upward, misaligning the tracks and possibly overstressing the bolted connections. This potential problem has been addressed by vibratory compaction of the overfill covering the tube. Additional stabilization includes the driving of large pilings and the connection of additional restraints.

Slip joint

The transbay tube terminates at an under-bay slip joint near the Embarcadero Station in San Francisco. The designed slip margin has been reduced by half due to unforeseen settlement of the tube structure. The projected worst-case motion at this joint has been determined to be beyond that for which the joint is presently capable, which could cause severe structural problems and mud and water entry into the tube and adjacent subway systems. This is to be corrected at great expense – first estimated at $142 million but expected to cost far more – probably the largest single cost item in the list of BART seismic retrofits.

Berkeley Hills Tunnel

In June 2006 Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) management announced that they have elected not to modify the Berkeley Hills Tunnel, which actually penetrates the Hayward Fault, arguing that it would be cheaper (and less disruptive to current operations) to rebore a misaligned portion after the fact than to protect riders (either by extensive modifications of the tunnel or by replacing it with a higher bore) against the small likelihood that a train (or two) would crash into or be cut in two by a major slippage of the fault. Modified train scheduling to prevent multiple train exposure at faults has been determined by BART engineers to be impractical due to variations in train passage, but automated event-related realtime train operational response is considered practical (see below).

Seismic sensor network

BART has installed and continues to enhance a network of seismic sensors (an earthquake warning system) to trigger a system halt in the event of a major event, this to include automated event progression analysis to determine the best action with regard to individual trains for maximum safety (a fault rip can take up to several tens of seconds to completely propagate from the epicenter to the more distant affected locations). Such sensor networks and warning devices have a potential to reduce the hazards from falling objects and furnishings provided that the people notified are well trained in appropriate responses (similar to the Cold War&#x27;s &quot;duck and cover&quot; training of schoolchildren).

====Refineries====
Of primary concern with respect to the Hayward Fault is the huge Chevron Richmond Refinery in Richmond. Although founded on better ground than most of the shoreline, this refinery has extensive crude oil and finished product docks and pipelines extending into the bay, which could produce catastrophic spills into the bay, with the potential to adversely affect hundreds of miles of sensitive wetlands. Dismantling of high pressure and temperature process units and the consequent fire danger to personnel and equipment could produce substantial economic consequences for the western states. Large liquid storage tanks are protected by berms that are designed to contain the contents should a tank fail under normal conditions. Similar process and product conditions exist at other refineries further inland near Martinez, but mostly these plants are exposed to earthquakes from other faults.

====Fuel pipelines====
Gasoline is continuously shipped under pressure from Richmond and Martinez area refineries through Kinder Morgan Energy Partners pipelines which run under heavily populated East Bay urban areas to tank terminals near San Jose Airport in North San Jose. Aviation fuels are piped from these same refineries to the Oakland Airport. A number of spills have previously occurred due to landslides and such spill and related toxic and flammable material release may be prevalent in a major seismic event. A November 9, 2004, construction accident on this pipeline system in Walnut Creek killed five people. As seen in other worldwide pipeline ruptures, even an instantaneous stop of pumping would take several minutes to significantly lower pipeline pressure after a break, and would likely result in the release of significant amounts of flammable liquid fuels. Chevron also has a petroleum products pipeline that crosses the fault.

Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company has numerous gas distribution lines crossing or near the Hayward Fault. Several PG&amp;E gas transmission pipelines also cross the fault. After the San Bruno pipeline explosion, which was unrelated to seismic activity, it took PG&amp;E crews 95 minutes to stop the gas flow to both ends of that failed pipeline.

====Bay Area water supplies====
East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) supplies water to 800,000 East Bay customers who live west of the Berkeley Hills. Prior to the adoption and implementation of a $200 million seismic improvement project all of the water for these customers went through one vulnerable tunnel that crosses the Hayward Fault near the Caldecott Tunnel. As part of this project, that tunnel – the Claremont Tunnel – was seismically retrofitted. Additionally, EBMUD created a second route to bring water to these west-of-the-hills customers through the Southern Loop Bypass near Castro Valley. The Southern Loop was completed in 2002, while the seismic retrofitting of the Claremont tunnel was completed in February 2007.

The Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, which supplies 270 to 315 million gallons of water per day to the City of San Francisco and other Bay Area communities, directly crosses the Hayward Fault in Fremont. A 2002 report by the Bay Area Economic Forum suggests that a breakdown in the aqueduct due to an earthquake could cut off Hetch Hetchy water to the Bay Area for 60 days. In addition to depriving 85% of San Francisco residents of their drinking water, this would cut off supplies for firefighting and water-intensive industry, causing economic damage of $17.2–28.7 billion. Extensive reconstruction work at the Hayward Fault crossing includes a multi-sectioned tunnel structure to allow shear without collapse, this is to contain a section of water pipe with ball joints and a slip joint.

====Lake Temescal====
The fault continues north under the eastern margin of Lake Temescal and its dam, which is unlikely to fail since it has been completely reinforced by the extensive earth fill supporting the subsequently improved Highway 24.

====University of California, Berkeley====

Many of the structures at the UC Berkeley academic campus have been self-rated as having &quot;poor&quot; earthquake performance. Numerous chemical, radiological, and biohazardous materials are present (in relatively small quantities) on campus and on the associated Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in the hills above the university. However, the university has undertaken an extensive retrofitting project over the past decade to systematically retrofit all academic buildings on Campus to withstand a significant earthquake.

Memorial Stadium

Further north the fault passes under the lengthwise midline of the football field of California Memorial Stadium at the University of California, Berkeley. Fault creep since 1923 offset the original walls at the north and south ends 13 inches (33 cm).

Extensive upgrades over a recent eighteen-month interval have addressed the life safety issues, including replacement of the football players&#x27; facilities, and an extensive seismic retrofit of those sections not subject to fault shearing. The work was the subject of several lawsuits from neighborhood and environmental groups, who were concerned about such extensive construction on top of a major fault. During the reconstruction, the Cal Bears have played at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco for one season. The modifications completed in Summer 2012 involved the cutting of the stadium into four independent sections, followed by the demolition of the two segments directly over the rubble zone. The north and south ends are formed of new bridging sections that rest upon floating mats (foundations that do not penetrate the surface, rather sitting upon plastic sheets over level graded gravel and sand) where they pass over and near the fault, with appropriate sliding connections between the sections for the safety of spectators and the ability to absorb the relative rotation between the east and west fixed sections and the new north and south mobile sections.

====Electrical and communication system disruption====
Affected areas are likely to be without electrical power for an extensive period. This in turn can make fuel supplies for vehicles and emergency generators unavailable locally and impact both domestic water, industrial water, sewage plants, and drainage pumping. Due to the extensive use of point of sale scanners and registers in supermarkets this could also impact the ability of stores to sell essential items such as groceries and to preserve frozen food items, as well as terminating cable TV and most internet access.

Cellphone and most landline telephone service, while theoretically survivable for a short time on battery and emergency power, could instead suffer immediate disruption from ground shaking effects.

====Cities affected====
Some of the cities in the eastern bay shore and south bay region near this fault include Richmond, El Cerrito, Berkeley, Albany, Emeryville, Kensington, Oakland, Piedmont, San Leandro, San Lorenzo, Castro Valley, Hayward, Union City, Fremont, Newark, Milpitas, Niles, and portions of San Jose.

Similar dangerous soil conditions and insufficiently resistant buildings are also on the southern, western and northern boundaries of San Francisco and San Pablo bays and would also be severely affected by a major earthquake on the Hayward fault. As that portion includes the so-called Silicon Valley, the potential economic disruption due to destruction of works in progress and the dismantling of microelectronics fabrication plants could have an economic effect extending worldwide. The current estimates of the probability of a major earthquake on any of the numerous regional faults range up to 70 percent within the thirty-year period 2000–2029. A recent &quot;quiet period&quot; following many years of minor activity is considered to be particularly ominous by many, although geologists have not yet been able to predict earthquakes with any useful accuracy. They do warn that all residents of the region should be prepared for a large event and its subsequent effects (e. g., lack of water, firefighting, first aid, electricity, motor and heating fuels, etc.) and that much life-safety protective work remains to be done.

===Retrofits for survivability===
It is primarily the likelihood of a severe earthquake on the Hayward or San Andreas faults that has spurred a substantial effort to retrofit and sometimes replace large structures at risk, particularly the eastern and western spans of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the San Francisco and Oakland city halls, and numerous elevated rail, road, and pedestrian structures and overpasses. Much work remains to be done in the region and progress is being hampered by budget constraints imposed by trickle down federal-state-regional deficits, design and construction delays due to state and local political bickering over design, and unexpectedly high steel and cement costs due to the extensive construction work being done in China. Nonetheless, Bay area cities and counties have long expected a major earthquake and as a result all building in the past 30 years has been required to adhere to strict guidelines regarding earthquake resistance. Of all the earthquake prone regions of the world, the San Francisco Bay Area is among the most prepared structurally for the eventuality of a major quake while remaining grossly unprepared in both civil response planning and in the retrofitting of older buildings.

===Virtual tour===
The Google Earth website, in cooperation with the United States Geological Survey, has prepared a virtual helicopter tour of the fault, with much additional information available through the tour. Potentially dangerous landslide areas are also marked, showing great areas beyond the fault that could be rendered uninhabitable by a major event.

===Special exhibit===
Fremont Earthquake Exhibit: &quot;The Hayward Fault Exposed&quot;

This geotourism exhibit (April through October 2006, now closed) featured a 12- to deep pit exposing the Hayward Fault, which could be viewed &quot;face to face&quot; from a shaded platform by descending a staircase. Significant features were noted and marked. Similar trench excavations are used in the determination of the frequency and magnitude of prehistoric earthquakes and to determine the location of latent faults as part of the science of Paleoseismology
*Extensive additional interpretive material concerning the geology and seismology of the Bay Area was presented for viewing, most of which is currently accessible online.
*Funding and organization for a permanent exhibit at this location is being actively sought, with planning in progress.


===In popular culture===
The Tom Wolfe novel &quot;A Man in Full&quot; features a fictional major earthquake on the Hayward Fault as a deus ex machina method (freeing a major character from prison) and plot development point.

The James Bond movie &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985) involved a plot, referred as &quot;Main Strike&quot;, by Max Zorin to detonate explosives along the Hayward Fault, San Andreas Fault and at the &quot;geological lock&quot; to flood the two faults with water from nearby lakes and cause both faults to move causing a &quot;double earthquake&quot; that would destroy Silicon Valley, all in order for Zorin to monopolize the microchip market.

<text>Kendall VanHook Bumpass (November 6, 1809 – 1885) was a cowboy and early settler, who, in 1865, broke through the surface of a scalding hot mudpot in an active geothermal area and consequently lost a leg by amputation. The geothermal area was later named &quot;Bumpass Hell&quot;, and is today located in Lassen Volcanic National Park in California.

<text>The BPF Party (; ) is a banned political party in Belarus. It was &quot;de facto&quot; established after the split of the social movement Belarusian Popular Front (abbr. BPF; , ) in 1999. The Belarusian Popular Front was founded during the Perestroika era by members of the Belarusian intelligentsia, including Vasil Bykaŭ. Its first and most charismatic leader was Zianon Pazniak.

After a 2005 decree by president Alexander Lukashenko on the restriction of the usage of the words &#x27; (&quot;Belarusian&quot;) and&#x27; (&quot;National&quot;, &quot;Popular&quot;, &quot;People&#x27;s&quot;) in the names of political parties and movements, the party had to change its official name to &quot;BPF Party&quot;.

==Early history==
The Belarusian Popular Front was established in 1988 as both a political party and a cultural movement, following the examples of the Popular Front of Estonia, Popular Front of Latvia and the Lithuanian pro-democracy movement Sąjūdis. Membership was declared open to all Belarusian citizens as well as any democratic organization.

Its alleged goals are democracy and independence through national rebirth and rebuilding after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The main idea of the Front was the revival of the national idea, including a revival of the Belarusian language. Initially, its orientation was pro-Western with a great deal of scepticism towards Russia. 

The party was in favour of removing Russian as an official language in Belarus. Russian became an official language following the 1995 Belarusian referendum, at the beginning of Lukashenko&#x27;s rule, when a proposal for making Russian a state language received 83.3% support from the turnout.
Among the significant achievements of the Front was the uncovering of the burial site of Kurapaty near Minsk. The Front claims that the NKVD performed extrajudicial killings there.

Initially, the Front had significant visibility because of its numerous public actions that almost always ended in clashes with police and KGB. It was BPF parliamentarians who convinced the Supreme Council of Belarus (the interim Belarusian parliament) to restore the historical Belarusian symbols: the white-red-white flag and the &quot;Pahonia&quot; coat of arms. During Soviet-times people faced arrest in the streets for displaying white-red-white symbols in Belarus.

In 1994 the BPF formed a so-called &quot;shadow&quot; cabinet consisting of 100 BPF intellectuals. Its first Prime Minister was . It originally contained 18 commissions that published ideas and proposed laws and plans for restructuring the government and economy. Its last economic reform proposal was published in 1999. In opposition to Alexander Lukashenko&#x27;s government, the party supports Belarus&#x27; entry into NATO and the European Union.

==1999 split==
In the late 1990s, the Popular Front split into two parties, both of which claim to be the legitimate continuation of the original BPF. The party&#x27;s conservative wing under Zianon Pazniak became the Conservative Christian Party – BPF () while the moderate majority became today&#x27;s BPF Party.

==Modern history, participation in elections==
At the 2004 legislative election the party was part of the People&#x27;s Coalition 5 Plus (&quot;Narodnaja Kaalicyja Piaciorka Plus&quot;), which did not secure any seats. These elections fell (according to the OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission) significantly short of OSCE commitments. Universal principles and constitutionally guaranteed rights of expression, association and assembly were seriously violated, calling into question the Belarusian authorities’ willingness to respect the concept of political competition on a basis of equal treatment. According to this mission, the principles of an inclusive democratic process, whereby citizens have the right to seek political office without discrimination, candidates to present their views without obstruction, and voters to learn about them and discuss them freely, were largely ignored.

In October 2005 Alaksandar Milinkievič, a candidate proposed by the BPF and Zialonyja (Belarusian Green Party) was elected the common democratic candidate for the 2006 Presidential election.

During the 2010 presidential election the BPF Party nominated its own candidate for the presidency, Ryhor Kastusiou, who was then the Deputy Chairman of the BPF Party. According to the official results, he gained 1.97% of the votes.

In 2011, following an internal conflict, more than 90 further members left BPF Party, including several prominent veterans of the original Belarusian Popular Front, such as Lyavon Barshchewski, Jury Chadyka, Vincuk Viačorka. This was sometimes described as a &quot;second split&quot; of the Belarusian Popular Front.

In the Congress in September 2017, the new party leader Ryhor Kastusioŭ has been elected. The Congress decided also to nominate Alaksiej Janukievič and Belarusian-American attorney to the presidential office in the next elections. The final decision about the only candidate has to be made in the future.

On 12 April 2021, Kastusiou was reported to have been arrested by the Belarusian KGB as part of its crackdown on protestors following the results of the 2020 Belarusian presidential election. Officially Kastusiou and BPF members were accused of trying to organise an illegal coup (in which president Alexander Lukashenko was to be assassinated); the Russian FSB together with the KGB have claimed their arrests did prevent the coup to happen. On 5 September 2022, Kastusiou was sentenced to 10 years in jail by the Minsk Regional Court.

On 14 August 2023 the BPF Party was banned by the Supreme Court of Belarus.

==International relations==
The party became an associate member of the International Democracy Union in 2007.

It was an observer member of the European People&#x27;s Party until 2017. Since 7 April 2017 the party is a member of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe. Its youth wing, BPF Youth, is a member of the European Young Conservatives.

<text>Kataklysm is a Canadian death metal band. As of 2024, they have released fifteen studio albums, two EPs, and two DVDs. Kataklysm received their first Juno Award (the Canadian equivalent of the Grammy) for Best Album of the Year in the &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; category for their 2015 album &quot;Of Ghosts and Gods&quot;.

== Biography ==
Kataklysm was formed in Montreal, Quebec in September 1991. Early in their career, the band became known for their fast and technical brand of death metal, referred to as the &quot;Northern Hyperblast&quot;. Nuclear Blast discovered the band in 1992 after the release of their debut demo, &quot;The Death Gate Cycle of Reincarnation&quot;, which received significant acclaim in the underground metal scene. In 1994, Kataklysm signed with Nuclear Blast and released their first EP, &quot;The Mystical Gate of Reincarnation&quot;, followed by their debut album, &quot;Sorcery&quot;, in 1995. In 1996, they released their second full-length album, &quot;Temple of Knowledge&quot;, which included their first music video for the track &quot;The Awakener&quot;. However, following the album&#x27;s release, founding member and lead vocalist Sylvain Houde left the band, citing emotional difficulties related to the end of a romantic relationship. Bassist Maurizio Iacono subsequently took over as vocalist, with Stephane Barbe replacing him as bassist. This shift also marked a change in the band&#x27;s musical direction, with Iacono and founding guitarist JF Dagenais assuming creative leadership.

In 1998, Kataklysm released their third studio album, &quot;Victims of this Fallen World&quot;—Iacono&#x27;s first as vocalist—which featured a more groove-oriented and melodic approach to death metal. The 2000 album &quot;The Prophecy (Stigmata of the Immaculate)&quot; further refined this style, reducing the chaotic elements of their earlier work and incorporating stronger thrash metal influences. Their 2001 release, &quot;&quot;, continued to add melodic elements to their death metal sound, earning them further critical acclaim. In 2002, the band released &quot;Shadows &amp; Dust&quot;, widely regarded as one of their most successful albums. It received overwhelmingly positive reviews and marked an increase in sales compared to their previous releases. This album was also their first to chart in countries such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and included one of their most recognisable tracks: &quot;In Shadows &amp; Dust&quot;.

Two years later, in 2004, the band released &quot;Serenity in Fire&quot;. The album was notable for the temporary absence of drummer Max Duhamel, who was replaced by Martin Maurais due to an injury. &quot;Serenity in Fire&quot; was well received and included two of the band&#x27;s most iconic tracks: &quot;As I Slither&quot; and &quot;The Ambassador of Pain&quot;. Duhamel recovered in time to perform on the band&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;In the Arms of Devastation&quot;, released in 2006. This album was a significant success, with sales exceeding 50,000 units and achieving the band&#x27;s highest charting positions up to that point. 

The subsequent album, &quot;Prevail&quot;, demonstrated Kataklysm&#x27;s continued rise in popularity, with sales again surpassing 50,000 units. The single &quot;Taking the World by Storm&quot; became the band&#x27;s most-watched track on YouTube, garnering over three million views. In 2008, Kataklysm performed at the UK&#x27;s Bloodstock festival, sharing the stage with headliners Nightwish and Dimmu Borgir.

The band released their eleventh studio album, &quot;Waiting for the End to Come&quot;, on October 29, 2013, followed by their twelfth album, &quot;Of Ghosts and Gods&quot;, on July 31, 2015. Both albums received widespread acclaim. Kataklysm&#x27;s thirteenth studio album, &quot;Meditations&quot;, was released in June 2018. &quot;Meditations&quot; became the band&#x27;s first album to chart on the Billboard Top 100, peaking at #61. It also marked their highest charting positions in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and their native Canada.

Kataklysm released their fourteenth studio album, &quot;Unconquered&quot;, on September 25, 2020. Three weeks prior to the album&#x27;s release, the band announced that drummer Oli Beaudoin had departed and was replaced by James Payne. The band continued touring Europe in 2023.

Their fifteenth album, &quot;Goliath&quot;, was released on August 11, 2023.

<doc id="896863" wikidata="Q50817" url="?curid=896863" title="WrestleMania III">
<text>WrestleMania III was the third annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). The event was held on March 29, 1987, at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan. There were 12 matches, with the main event featuring Hulk Hogan successfully defending the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against André the Giant.

WWF claimed that paid attendance was 93,173, which would have made it the largest crowd for a WWF event as well as the largest recorded attendance of a live indoor event in North America at the time; however, retrospective analyses of the event have determined the actual attendance to be around 78,000. The event is considered to be the pinnacle of the 1980s wrestling boom, with almost one million fans watching the event at 160 closed-circuit locations in North America and the number of people watching via pay-per-view estimated at several million. The WWF generated $1.6 million in ticket sales, and pay-per-view revenue was estimated at $10.3 million, setting a record for the time. The promotion&#x27;s only event with an official higher attendance was WrestleMania 32, held at AT&amp;T Stadium in 2016. The record for the largest indoor event stood until January 27, 1999, when it was surpassed by the papal mass with Pope John Paul II at the TWA Dome in St. Louis, Missouri, which drew an audience of 104,000.

==Production==
===Background===

WrestleMania is considered the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF, now WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. Unlike the previous year&#x27;s WrestleMania 2, WrestleMania III was only scheduled to be held at one location. It was scheduled to be held on March 29, 1987, at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan.

===Storylines===
Like the previous WrestleMania events, WrestleMania III was promoted for several months in advance. The main feud stemmed from André the Giant&#x27;s heel turn and betrayal of his friend, the WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, which began on an episode of &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; when WWF President Jack Tunney presented Hogan with a trophy for being the WWF World Heavyweight Champion for three years, and André, his good friend, came out to congratulate him but cryptically remarked: &quot;Three years to be a champion, it&#x27;s a long time&quot;. A week later on another episode of &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot;, Tunney presented André with a visibly smaller trophy for being &quot;undefeated in the WWF for 15 years&quot;, and Hogan came out to congratulate André, but before The Giant could speak, Hogan ended up being the focal point of the interview. Annoyed by this, André walked out during Hogan&#x27;s congratulation speech. A week later on yet another &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; segment, Jesse Ventura hinted he knew something about André, but wasn&#x27;t telling. This infuriated Piper and the two nearly came to blows before Ventura asserted that he could produce André the next week, asking Piper, &quot;Can you produce Hogan?&quot;. Piper agreed and nervously asked Hogan later on, who agreed. The following week, Hogan was on &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; first when André walked out with Bobby Heenan, a long-time adversary of Hogan and André. He announced himself to be André&#x27;s new manager. André then challenged Hogan to a title match at WrestleMania III and attacked Hogan, ripping off Hogan&#x27;s T-shirt and crucifix necklace.

Another main feud leading up to the event was between Ricky Steamboat and the Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage. The feud began during a title match between the two when Savage attacked Steamboat as he greeted fans at ringside. Savage then pushed Steamboat over the security rail and delivered an elbow shot that thrust Steamboat&#x27;s throat into the rail and dropped the ring bell onto his throat from the top rope, injuring his larynx and sending him to the hospital. This resulted in a long, bitter feud that lasted for six months, included several bloody match-ups, and finally culminated at WrestleMania. George Steele was in Steamboat&#x27;s corner, having developed a crush on Savage&#x27;s valet, Miss Elizabeth.

Billy Jack Haynes and Hercules&#x27; feud started when Bobby Heenan continuously taunted Haynes, telling him that Hercules was the real master of Haynes&#x27; finishing move, the full nelson; which came to a boiling point when Hercules attacked Haynes on an edition of &quot;Superstars of Wrestling&quot;, which led to their match at WrestleMania. This battle was advertised as the &quot;Full Nelson Challenge.&quot;

Another heated feud leading up to this event was between Harley Race and the Junkyard Dog. When The &quot;WWF Wrestling Classic&quot; became the &quot;King of the Ring&quot; tournament, Harley Race went on to win the tournament and began referring to himself as King Harley Race, and coming to the ring in a royal crown and cape to the ceremonial accompaniment of the classical music piece, &quot;Great Gates of Kiev&quot; by Modest Mussorgsky. After each of his victories, Race forced his defeated opponent to bow and kneel before him. Usually, Race&#x27;s manager, Bobby Heenan, forced the defeated opponent to bow and kneel by grabbing his hair. Junkyard Dog protested Race&#x27;s self-proclaimed monarchy in the WWF and stated there would never be a complete ruler in the WWF, which led to a match on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event IX&quot;, in which the King and his manager both tried to make Junkyard Dog bow for them. This set the stage for the WrestleMania match, which included the stipulation that the loser had to bow to the winner.

On January 26, 1987, The British Bulldogs lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to The Hart Foundation in a match that saw the Dynamite Kid so debilitated with a back injury that he was virtually carried to the ring by Davey Boy Smith and did not see any physical activity after being knocked out by the Harts&#x27; manager, Jimmy Hart, who had hit him with his megaphone as the match began. Danny Davis was the referee and allowed The Hart Foundation to use illegal double-team maneuvers. After being given some time off for Dynamite to recuperate, the Bulldogs continued their rivalry with The Hart Foundation when they teamed up with Tito Santana against the Foundation and the referee-turned-wrestler Danny Davis in a six-man tag team match at WrestleMania III. The match was billed as a revenge match with Santana&#x27;s inclusion due to Davis being the referee in the Boston Garden in early 1986 when he had lost the Intercontinental title to the Macho Man who used a foreign object to get the win.

Rock singer and Detroit native Alice Cooper was in Jake Roberts&#x27; corner during his match with The Honky Tonk Man managed by Jimmy Hart. The Honky Tonk Man had attacked Roberts with a guitar on Roberts&#x27; interview segment, &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;, which legitimately injured Roberts&#x27; neck. This event began Roberts&#x27; turn into a babyface as well as the feud between the wrestlers, which culminated in their WrestleMania match.

The feud between Adrian Adonis and Roddy Piper began when, following a leave of absence from the WWF in mid-1986, Piper returned to find his &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; segment replaced by &quot;The Flower Shop&quot;, a segment hosted by then-effeminate wrestler Adrian Adonis. Piper, who returned as a face, spent weeks crashing Adonis&#x27; show and trading insults, leading to a showdown between the two segments that ended with Piper being assaulted and humiliated by Adonis, Piper&#x27;s former bodyguard Bob Orton, and Don Muraco. The trio left Piper with his face covered in red lipstick, lying in the middle of the remnants of the destroyed Piper&#x27;s Pit set. In response, Piper stormed the set of Adonis&#x27; show and destroyed it with a baseball bat. This led to their Hair vs. Hair match at WrestleMania III, which was billed as Piper&#x27;s retirement match from wrestling before becoming a full-time actor.

==Event==
WWF owner Vince McMahon claims that as he was about to announce &quot;Welcome to WrestleMania III,&quot; he felt the spirit of his father Vincent J. McMahon, who had died three years earlier. After McMahon welcomed the audience, he introduced Aretha Franklin, who opened the show singing a rendition of &quot;&quot;America the Beautiful&quot;.&quot;

The first match of the night was The Can-Am Connection (Rick Martel and Tom Zenk) versus Bob Orton Jr. and The Magnificent Muraco (with Mr. Fuji). This match ended when Martel gave Muraco a high cross-body with Zenk on his hands and knees giving Muraco what Gorilla Monsoon called &quot;A little high school trip from behind&quot; allowing Martel to get the win for his team.

The next match that aired was Hercules (with Bobby Heenan in his corner) against Billy Jack Haynes in the &quot;Full Nelson Challenge.&quot; The match ended when Haynes locked Hercules in the full nelson outside the ring and both were counted out. After the match, Heenan assaulted Haynes by kneeing him in the back after Haynes had applied the full nelson to Hercules outside the ring. Haynes then chased Heenan into the ring, where Hercules blindsided Haynes with his chain, hitting him a number of times before locking a bloodied Haynes into his own full nelson.

The Mixed Tag Team Match between King Kong Bundy and his professional wrestling midget team of Lord Littlebrook and Little Tokyo against Hillbilly Jim and his own team of the Haiti Kid and Little Beaver was next. The rules were that only midgets could fight midgets and that neither Bundy nor Hillbilly was allowed to attack the midgets, though at one point, Bundy tagged in and Little Beaver refused to tag out immediately, even hitting the &quot;Walking condominium&quot; with a dropkick to no effect before bailing with a tag to Hillbilly Jim. King Kong Bundy&#x27;s team was disqualified when Bundy attacked Little Beaver because Bundy was not supposed to be in the ring with the midgets. After Beaver had attacked Bundy on occasion during the match, he finally got caught and Bundy attacked Little Beaver, hitting him with a body slam before dropping an elbow across his chest.

The &quot;Loser Must Bow&quot; match between the Junkyard Dog and Harley Race (with Bobby Heenan and The Fabulous Moolah) followed. Prior to the match, Gene Okerlund interviewed Heenan, Race, and Moolah backstage, where Moolah predicted that Junkyard Dog would have to bow to the King as he is supposed to do. Bobby then gave Moolah the crown and told her to put it on the King&#x27;s head after the match, &quot;As only the Queen of Wrestling can do&quot;. Junkyard Dog came out to the ring to a big ovation in the Silverdome. During the match, the two battled back and forth, with Race even trying unsuccessfully to give the prone Dog a falling headbutt which naturally failed. Following this, Race recovered enough to give the Junkyard Dog a belly to belly suplex when he was distracted by Bobby Heenan to get the win. Due to the pre-match stipulation, JYD did a little bow and then hit Race from the blindside with a steel chair to a rousing ovation from the crowd. After attacking Race, Junkyard Dog took the King&#x27;s royal robe and left the ring with it in hand to a standing ovation.

The next match was The Dream Team (Brutus Beefcake and Greg Valentine), with Luscious Johnny V and Canadian strongman Dino Bravo in their corner, against The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers (Jacques and Raymond). Ray Rougeau started off the match by locking up with Beefcake. The two men later tagged out, and Valentine brawled with Jacques Rougeau as Bravo looked on from the outside of the ring. Raymond performed a sleeper hold on Valentine and was followed by Beefcake jumping off the ropes and accidentally hitting The Hammer with a double axe handle. The Rougeau Brothers gave Valentine a double team move, but the referee was arguing with Beefcake. The match ended when Dino Bravo jumped off the top rope and hit Raymond while he was pinning Valentine, then rolling Valentine on top of him for the win. The Dream Team argued for most of the match, which led to Valentine, Bravo and Luscious Johnny departing together, without Beefcake.

Footage of an interview with Rowdy Roddy Piper was aired as Piper made his way to the ring to face Adrian Adonis, who was accompanied by Jimmy Hart, in Piper&#x27;s retirement match. Piper and Adonis began the match by attacking each other with Piper&#x27;s belt. Adonis put a sleeper hold on Piper in the middle of the ring and released the hold prior to Piper&#x27;s arm going down for a 3rd time, thinking that he won the match. When Jimmy Hart got in the ring to celebrate with Adonis, Brutus Beefcake came to the ring to help Piper recover, and Piper attacked Adonis and performed a sleeper hold of his own. Piper got the victory, and after the match was over, Brutus got in the ring and cut Adrian Adonis&#x27; hair as Piper held Jimmy Hart down. After being woken by Beefcake and seeing himself in the mirror he had brought to the ring that Piper was holding, Adonis hit the mirror and chased Piper around the ring before leaving the ring in embarrassment with Hart using his jacket to cover Adonis&#x27; head.

Up next was a six-man tag team match featuring former referee Danny Davis (in his debut as a WWF wrestler) and the WWF Tag Team Champions, The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart), against The British Bulldogs (Dynamite Kid and Davey Boy Smith) and Tito Santana with Matilda the Bulldog in their corner. As a referee, Davis&#x27; bias towards heel wrestlers had led to the Bulldogs losing the tag titles to the Harts and also led to Santana losing the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship to Randy Savage. The Bulldogs had many near-falls, yet Neidhart broke up most of them. After all three members of the Bulldogs/Santana team had got a measure of revenge on Davis, all six wrestlers ended up brawling in the ring. Danny Davis recovered and hit Davey Boy with Jimmy Hart&#x27;s megaphone and pinned him for the win.

Butch Reed, making his pay-per-view debut, against Koko B. Ware, was the following match. Reed won the match with a rollup, (and a handful of tights), after a high cross-body from Koko. After the contest, Reed&#x27;s manager Slick got in the ring and attacked Koko B. Ware with his cane, but Tito Santana quickly rushed to the ring and stopped Slick, and ripped some of his clothes off. Slick retreated as Reed got back in the ring, only for Reed to get a double drop kick from Koko and Santana.
The next contest was a title match involving reigning WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion, Randy Savage (with Miss Elizabeth) and Ricky Steamboat (with George Steele). The match itself lasted for nearly fifteen minutes. At one point, Savage was about to use the ring bell as a weapon, but was stopped by Steele, who knocked him off of the top rope. When Savage attempted to give Steamboat a scoop slam, Steamboat reversed it into a small package to get the win and become the new WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion, marking the first time in WrestleMania history that the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship changed hands. This match is considered by many to be one of the greatest matches in WWE history.

The tenth match of the night was between The Honky Tonk Man (with Jimmy Hart) and Jake Roberts, who along with his pet Python &quot;Damien&quot;, had Detroit native Alice Cooper in his corner. When Jake went for the DDT, Honky Tonk Man&#x27;s manager Jimmy Hart pulled Roberts&#x27; legs, and the Honky Tonk Man rolled up Roberts from behind, held on to the ropes, and pinned him for the win. After the match, Roberts narrowly missed hitting Honky with his own guitar, smashing it against a ring post and causing Honky to run off down the aisle, leaving Hart alone in the ring. Alice Cooper got in the ring and, with Roberts&#x27; holding Hart in a Full Nelson, attacked him with Roberts&#x27; python Damien.

Ring announcer Howard Finkel then introduced Gene Okerlund to the crowd. Okerlund then announced the reported attendance of the event, which set a new indoor-attendance record of 93,173.

The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff (with Slick) were in action next, against The Killer Bees (Jim Brunzell and B. Brian Blair). Slick asked all of the fans to rise to respect Nikolai Volkoff&#x27;s singing of the Soviet National Anthem, and when Volkoff began singing, Jim Duggan came to the ring with his two-by-four, which had a tiny American flag attached to it, got on the microphone and said that Volkoff was not going to sing because America is the land of the free and the home of the brave. While the match ensued, Duggan stayed at ringside. When The Iron Sheik locked a camel clutch on Brunzell, Duggan, who was chasing Volkoff around the ring and finally into it, stopped and hit an unsuspecting Sheik across the back with his 2x4 in front of the referee, resulting in The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff winning the bout by disqualification.

===Main event===

In what has since been billed as the &quot;biggest main event in sports entertainment,&quot; the final match pitted WWF World Heavyweight Champion, Hulk Hogan defending the title against André the Giant. Howard Finkel introduced the guest ring announcer, Bob Uecker, who in turn introduced the guest timekeeper, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; host Mary Hart. The fans booed André heavily and pelted him and his manager Bobby Heenan with trash as they rode the cart to the ring. In contrast, Hogan, who walked to the ring, came out to a huge ovation. Approximately one minute into the match, Hogan attempted to body slam André, but he was unable to lift The Giant and nearly lost the match when Andre fell on him and almost pinned him. After the match had battled back and forth, André gave Hogan an Irish whip to the far side of the ring and attempted a big boot on Hogan, but Hogan ducked it and came off the ropes to give André a clothesline to take him off his feet for the first time in the match. Hogan then &quot;Hulked up&quot; and scoop slammed the Giant before hitting the ropes and executing his leg drop pin to get the win and retain the championship.

==Reception==
The event has received positive reviews. In the years after WrestleMania III, the Savage vs. Steamboat match has been ranked by critics and other wrestlers as one of the greatest matches in professional wrestling. &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; named it 1987&#x27;s Match of the Year. IGN ranked it at number 6 in their Top 20 Matches in WrestleMania History. Steamboat described the match as &quot;the moment in time that defined me as a wrestler.&quot; Thomas Golianopoulos of &quot;Complex Sports&quot; ranked it at number two in his list of the 50 Greatest Matches in WrestleMania History, citing that &quot;Both guys worked lightning fast and everything from Steamboat&#x27;s aggressiveness to the involvement of George &quot;The Animal&quot; Steele played off their part.&quot; David Otunga picked it as WWE.com&#x27;s Five-Star Match of the Week in December 19, 2012.

The main event between Hulk Hogan and André the Giant is regarded as one of the pivotal matches in the history of the WWE, with Hogan&#x27;s body slam on André having become an iconic moment of both wrestlers&#x27; careers as well as of the 1980s professional wrestling boom overall. Despite its historic importance, the match was also criticized for its quality. At the time, it received a negative four star rating from Dave Meltzer and the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; named it the &quot;Worst Worked Match of the Year.&quot; Meltzer would later increase his rating to one star out of five. In 2020, 411Mania&#x27;s Larry Csonka gave the match one star, stating &quot;The match is not good in any way shape or form; but is one I completely appreciate for its historical importance.&quot; Kevin Pantoja, also a writer for 411Mania, gave the match two stars in 2019, stating &quot;Technically, this isn&#x27;t any good. However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nearly as bad as some people do&quot;.

There have been numerous claims since WrestleMania III that the quoted attendance figure of 93,173; which established a world record attendance for an indoor event was false and that the real attendance figure was only around 78,000. The record would be broken by WrestleMania 32 in 2016. Meltzer pointed that 78,000 is attributed to Zane Bresloff, the local promoter for the event.

Officially, WrestleMania III ranks as the second highest attended event in WWE history behind WrestleMania 32 at the AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas in 2016 with an official figure of just over 101,000 in attendance, although Meltzer claims the actual number was between 93–94,000.

==Aftermath==
Roddy Piper went on to film &quot;Hell Comes to Frogtown&quot; and &quot;They Live&quot; and made sporadic appearances on television before finally returning to host a &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; segment at WrestleMania V. Piper continued to be active in professional wrestling at various points for more than two decades. The first televised match between André and Hogan after WrestleMania III was on The Main Event I on NBC on February 5, 1988, drawing a record 33 million viewers, making it the most-watched match in North American professional wrestling history. The angle surrounding this match was that after winning the match, André ended Hogan&#x27;s four-year reign as WWF champion with the help of a worked screwjob finish involving twin referees Earl and Dave Hebner. Their feud culminated in a rematch at WrestleMania IV as part of a tournament to crown a new champion (both ended up being disqualified during the match for using a steel chair in front of referee Joey Marella). The Hogan/Andre match at WrestleMania IV was the first-ever WrestleMania rematch.

Randy Savage continued to challenge Ricky Steamboat for the Intercontinental title in rematches at house shows across the country. Steamboat eventually lost the title to The Honky Tonk Man, and not long after, Savage became a face and feuded with Honky Tonk over the title. On September 4, 1987, Randy Savage won the King of the Ring  by defeating King Kong Bundy.

Twenty years later, WrestleMania 23 celebrated WrestleMania III by returning to the Detroit metropolitan area, showing footage from WrestleMania III, having Aretha Franklin (&quot;Who&#x27;s Zoomin&#x27; Who?&quot; by Franklin was the theme song to WrestleMania III) sing &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;, and having Kane scoop slam The Great Khali. WrestleMania 23 had the highest buyrate of any WrestleMania in history, before getting beaten by WrestleMania XXVIII.

Also in 2007, WrestleMania III was re-released on DVD. The DVD included pre-WrestleMania interviews and matches, including the battle royal from &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event X&quot; that Hercules won, and optional pop-up trivia facts about the event.

WrestleMania III was re-released on DVD on March 12, 2013. Fox Sports 1 later rebroadcast the event on May 12, 2020.

<doc id="896865" wikidata="Q3545359" url="?curid=896865" title="Bronze Tiger">
<text>Bronze Tiger is a character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Dennis O&#x27;Neil, Leopoldo Durañona, and Jim Berry, he first appeared in &quot;Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter&quot; #1 (May 1975) during the Bronze Age of Comics.

The character is often portrayed as an anti-hero or villain and is commonly depicted as an African-American grandmaster martial artist within the DC Universe alongside related characters, Richard Dragon and Lady Shiva. Turner has gained recognition as one of the premier martial artists, assassins, and spies on Earth. Over time, he has developed close associations with Batman, the League of Assassins, and various other titles and characters in the DC Universe. Notably, he has been involved with the Suicide Squad and served as a love interest for the superheroine Vixen.

The character has made appearances in various forms of media, including animated features like &quot;Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Notably, Bronze Tiger became a recurring character in the television series &quot;Arrow&quot;, portrayed by Michael Jai White, who also provided the character&#x27;s voice in other animated adaptations.

==Publication history==
Bronze Tiger first appeared in &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Fists&quot;, a novel by Dennis O&#x27;Neil and Jim Berry which starred Richard Dragon.

Bronze Tiger&#x27;s first DC Comics appearance was in &quot;Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter&quot; #1 (April/May 1975).

==Fictional character biography==

===Early years===
Born as Benjamin Turner, Ben comes from an upper-middle-class black neighborhood in Central City. When he was only 10 years old, he saw a burglar attacking his parents, and he proceeded to kill the man with a kitchen knife. In an effort to control the rage inside him, Turner turns to martial arts (and eventually, crime). After some time, Turner decides to travel to the far East to finally come to terms with his demons. There, he meets the O-Sensei, and studies under him, together with later recruit Richard Dragon. The meeting between Turner and Dragon starts the series &quot;Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter&quot;. Sometime after, they are approached by Barney Ling, from the organization known as G.O.O.D. (Global Organization of Organized Defense), and their (reluctant) working for Ling served as the basis for the &quot;Kung Fu Fighter&quot; series.

A flashback in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #39 (1981) shows Richard Dragon discovering that Turner has been brainwashed into becoming the Bronze Tiger by Professor Ojo, then used by Barney Ling (who turns out to be a traitor). Dragon and Turner prove to be equals in the fight, which only ends when Ling is accidentally knocked out a window.

===League of Assassins===
Later, in &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; #38, Turner&#x27;s further career is shown, wherein he and Dragon are hired by King Faraday to work for the C.B.I. (Central Bureau of Intelligence). Assigned to take down the League of Assassins, Dragon and Turner are discovered by the League, who kill Turner&#x27;s fiancée, Myoshi, and proceed to brainwash Turner. Turner was rid of his demons by channeling them into the identity of the Bronze Tiger, a masked assassin working for the League.

During this time, he also trains the assassin David Cain&#x27;s daughter, Cassandra, together with other members of the League. As the Bronze Tiger, Turner developed a fearsome reputation in the world, his identity remaining a secret to everyone but the League.

As the Bronze Tiger, Ben was feared worldwide, and the Sensei was smart enough to ensure that Ben hardly ever took off the mask, sending him on a new mission as soon as he finished another. For a time, his identity was secret, and he became one of the most wanted criminals, the Bronze Tiger being a professional assassin, killing on three continents.

Learning of Bronze Tiger&#x27;s true identity, King Faraday set up a rescue squad of Rick Flag and Nightshade. They retrieved the Tiger, and he was deprogrammed by Amanda Waller, who would later run the Suicide Squad.

===&quot;Suicide Squad&quot;===
Waller recruits Turner for the Suicide Squad, setting him up to become the team&#x27;s leader. Still, he ends up the team&#x27;s second-in-command under Rick Flag. On the team&#x27;s first mission, the Tiger faces Ravan, whom he cripples but refuses to kill. Turner develops a relationship with Vixen while a member of the Squad&#x27;s support crew, Flo Crawley, nurses a crush on him. Meeting Ravan again later, Turner convinces him to join the Squad, and the two become an effective fighting duo.

The &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; was mostly populated by villains, but the Tiger is one of the Squad&#x27;s &#x27;good&#x27; members, meant to balance out the cast of characters. He often enforces Waller&#x27;s rules, such as forcing various Squad members to wear devices designed to force good behavior. A Bronze Tiger solo story appeared as a Bonus Book in &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; #21 (December 1988).

The nigh-corrupting nature of the Squad eventually leads to Flag&#x27;s departure and seeming death in a nuclear explosion. Turner becomes the leader of the team, a role in which he excels, often disobeying direct orders to save the lives of his team (even if they were &quot;expendable&quot;). The Squad member Duchess, in reality, the Apokoliptian soldier Lashina, betrays the team and takes many, including Flo, to Apokolips. Flo does not survive the kidnapping.

Turner is eventually confronted by his superiors about his actions, and in the ensuing meeting, Turner&#x27;s mind snaps. He flees, traveling back to the East (leaving Vixen in the process), where he spends some time as a janissary.

Eventually, Amanda Waller reforms the Squad and again recruits Turner. In the interim, Turner has become a deeply troubled man, one who distances himself from Vixen and was constantly egging on Ravan to confront him. In a mission shortly after the team had reformed, Vixen is hurt, which unlocks Turner&#x27;s feelings for her once more. He mostly returns to his old state of mind. Vixen later leaves the team, telling Turner she no longer loves him but wishes him well.

In the team&#x27;s last mission, the Squad struggles to free a small island nation from the tyranny of its seemingly immortal ruler. The team must pass through a forest known for causing hallucinations. While the others experience their own mind trips, Bronze Tiger faces himself. Defeating himself and thereby exorcising his demons, Turner once again becomes a complete person. The tyrant is later defeated by Waller.

Shortly after leaving the Squad, Turner is part of Bruce Wayne&#x27;s search for Jack Drake and Shondra Kinsolving, who had been kidnapped. He teams up with Green Arrow and Gypsy, a member of Justice League Task Force. Gypsy becomes romantically involved with Tiger. He later becomes her mentor in martial arts.

In a story arc of the &quot;Batgirl&quot; title in 2005, Cassandra Cain begins a search for her birth mother, who she believes is Lady Shiva. She tracks down Turner in Detroit, where he has opened the &quot;Tiger Dojo&quot;. Both come to terms with Turner&#x27;s involvement in Cassandra&#x27;s training, and he expresses his pride in her becoming a hero. Bronze Tiger meets with Batman shortly afterward. He has to stop a group of villains and avenge his master.

===World War III and beyond===
In the &quot;World War III&quot; event, Bronze Tiger is shown to have retired but is coaxed back into action by Amanda Waller.

In &quot;Checkmate&quot; (vol. 2) Bronze Tiger rescues Rick Flag from a secret Quraci prison, where Flag had been imprisoned for four years. Notably, he is seen wearing a variant of his costume while with the League of Assassins, complete with a tiger head mask (according to writer Nunzio DeFilippis he wears the mask to prove it no longer has any power over him). Afterward, Amanda Waller appears at the Tiger Dojo, revealing to Ben that she leaked the information about Flag&#x27;s whereabouts. She then enlists their aid in tracking down a supposedly rogue Suicide Squad team, a team which, in reality, was being run by Flag and Turner at Waller&#x27;s behest.

In &quot;Countdown&quot; #39, Bronze Tiger is among the Suicide Squad members trying to bring in Pied Piper and the Trickster.

In &quot;Gotham Underground&quot;, Bronze Tiger is among the members of the Suicide Squad arresting Two-Face, Mad Hatter, Hugo Strange, and Scarecrow. While frisking Scarecrow, he is gassed by the escaping villain, revealing a previously undiscovered fear of insects.

Bronze Tiger appears in a &quot;Blackest Night&quot;-related one-shot entitled &quot;Blackest Night: Suicide Squad&quot; #67 (part of a series of one-shots operating as extra issues to long-since canceled ongoing series). He works with fellow Suicide Squad members Count Vertigo and Rick Flag to bring down a Mexican drug lord. When the Secret Six attempt to break into Belle Reve, Bronze Tiger squares off with Catman to see who is the superior feline-themed martial artist.

===The New 52===
In the New 52 reboot, Bronze Tiger is a high-ranking grandmaster within the League of Assassins. Alongside other assassins like Lady Shiva, Cheshire, Rictus, and December Graystone, he kidnaps Jason from the Outlaws. on account Talia al Ghul revealed to him years ago that Jason is the only one capable of stopping the Untitled, who seek the powerful Well of Sins in the League&#x27;s sacred city. Bronze Tiger and the assassins battle Arsenal, who has been deceived by the Untitled, granting them entry. Although they are initially defeated, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul absorbs their powers through the Well of Sins, becoming a powerful entity. Bronze Tiger allows Cheshire to aid the Outlaws due to her feelings for Arsenal, and when Ra&#x27;s is depowered by Red Hood, he advises him to retreat.

Bronze Tiger also features prominently as a major antagonist in the 2014 &quot;Deathstroke&quot; comic book series. In the &quot;Gods of War&quot; storyline, it is revealed that Bronze Tiger shares a close friendship with the revised version of Slade Wilson, also known as Deathstroke. He is an ally of the covert team known as the Dead Bastards, composed of intelligence operatives believed to be deceased. The team carries out black ops missions for Interpol and the CIA, particularly those deemed ethically challenging. Within the storyline, Bronze Tiger assumes the role of a deep-cover sleeper agent, pledging his loyalty to a man who identifies himself as Odysseus. This individual is revealed to be Slade Wilson&#x27;s metahuman father, who employs his powers to seize control of the League of Assassins. Alongside Shiva, Bronze Tiger serves as one of Odysseus&#x27; trusted lieutenants. Their objective is to locate Jericho and merge his powers with Odysseus&#x27;, thereby granting him the ability to manipulate entire populations to his will. Ultimately, Odysseus is killed by his own son, Slade Wilson, and Bronze Tiger is freed from the mind control and sleeper agent programming that had influenced his actions.

Bronze Tiger also appears in the &quot;Grayson&quot; comic book series, where the character is a member of the Syndicate. The Syndicate is a clandestine group composed of the world&#x27;s most skilled spies, dedicated to maintaining order among various intelligence agencies. In the series, Dick Grayson, known as Agent 37, is framed for the murder of Nemesis, and suspicions arise regarding Spyral&#x27;s activities under the leadership of Helena Bertinelli, also known as Matron. The Syndicate intervenes to prevent a conflict between intelligence agencies. However, when Helena is left with no other choice when she believes that Grayson and Tiger (Agent 1 of Spyral and their top spy) have betrayed her, she forcibly enlists their aid. Consequently, the Syndicate hunts them down while working to prevent the resurrection of Otto Netz, the dangerous spymaster known as the original Agent Zero. As the Syndicate clashes with Grayson and Tiger at Spyral&#x27;s headquarters, the true culprit behind Nemesis&#x27; murder is revealed to be Maxwell Lord and Checkmate. Lord had utilized double agents Alia (Agent Seven of Spyral) and Tiger to eliminate Nemesis, inciting a conflict that would eliminate Spyral. Lord also sought to obtain Spyral&#x27;s Minos file, which contained the secret identities of Justice League members. Ultimately, the Syndicate is defeated by Midnighter.

== Characterization ==
The character is widely regarded as one of the most highly skilled martial artists in the DC Universe. Within this fictional universe, Bronze Tiger&#x27;s combat abilities are stated to be on par with esteemed martial artists such as Lady Shiva and Richard Dragon. Additionally, the character has been depicted and acknowledged to surpass Batman in the realm of hand-to-hand combat. Within various storylines throughout his publication history, the character has prevailed or contended against various other adversaries of renown martial prowess, including Deathstroke, Black Canary, and Rick Flag Jr.

=== Allies and friends ===
Having collaborated with heroes and villains alike, Bronze Tiger has cultivated a network of allies spanning both sides of the alignment spectrum:

* Deathstroke: Initially, the characters were portrayed as adversaries when Ben was a member of Task Force X. However, following the events of Flashpoint, it is indicated that Slade and Ben developed a friendship in the past prior to him becoming a more infamous assassin. Bronze Tiger affectionately refers to Slade as his &quot;drinking buddy&quot;, and Slade often addresses him as &quot;Tiggs&quot;.
* Batman: In their initial encounters, Bronze Tiger found himself in conflict with Batman as he was brainwashed under the control of the League of Assassins. Their battles ensued, and Bronze Tiger held the upper hand in both instances. He was also responsible for the initial disappearance of Batwoman. However, as their interactions progressed, a profound respect developed between Batman and Bronze Tiger. They became sparring partners and friends, with Ben being aware of Batman&#x27;s true identity. Batman affectionately refers to him as &quot;Big Cat&quot; and recognizes Bronze Tiger as a superior and swifter fighter during their training sessions.
* Dick Grayson: Before the events of Flashpoint, Richard Dragon indicated that Ben had a familiarity with Nightwing. He spoke highly of Nightwing&#x27;s combat abilities and vouched for his assistance in combating the Circle of Six. In subsequent appearances within the new continuity, the characters crossed paths again when Grayson was operating undercover as Agent 37 in Spyral. During this time, Ben found Grayson somewhat irritating due to his insistence on referring to him as &quot;Bronze Tony the Tiger&quot;.
* Cheshire: One of the most renowned assassins globally, the character was subordinate to Bronze Tiger in their respective histories within the League of Assassins following the New 52 reboot. Ben developed a sense of concern for Jade, which led him to allow her to covertly aid the Outlaws after she developed feelings for one of their members, Arsenal. Despite Jade&#x27;s betrayal, which put her at odds with Ra&#x27;s al Ghul and the League of Assassins, Ben&#x27;s care for her persisted.

=== Bronze Tiger&#x27;s students ===
As a premier martial artist, Bronze Tiger has trained several other fighters in the DC Universe:

* Richard Dragon: In the 2004 &quot;Richard Dragon&quot; series, an alternative portrayal depicts Richard as Bronze Tiger&#x27;s martial arts student during his formative years. They shared a close friendship, and it is suggested that Ben played a role in bestowing upon Richard the moniker of &quot;Richard Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Dragon&quot;.
* Cynthia Reynolds: Before the events of Flashpoint, Cynthia was a heroic figure known by her codename &quot;Gypsy&quot;. She received martial arts training from Bronze Tiger and, over time, their relationship evolved into a romantic one.
* Red Hood (Jason Todd): Bronze Tiger played a role as one of Jason&#x27;s instructors during his training within the League of Assassins, alongside Lady Shiva. He imparted martial arts techniques and skills suitable for a mercenary to Jason. In contrast to Shiva, Jason expressed a deeper connection, considering himself not only a teacher but also his friend.
* Batgirl (Cassandra Cain): Bronze Tiger was one of Cassandra&#x27;s numerous trainers prior to her becoming Batgirl.

==Powers and abilities==
Bronze Tiger does not possess any inherent superhuman abilities but is highly proficient in various martial arts styles, renowned for his lightning-fast reflexes. Throughout his training, he has studied under esteemed martial arts masters such as Kirigi, O-Sensei, and Sensei. While specializing in Taekwondo, he has attained expertise in a diverse range of disciplines, including Boxing, Hapkido, Jeet Kune Do, Silat, Jujutsu, Judo, Karate, Kung Fu, Muay Thai, Wing Chun, and Vale Tudo. It is also worth noting that he has developed defensive techniques for each style, showcasing his comprehensive understanding of martial arts principles. Bronze Tiger also possesses knowledge in harnessing his own qi energy, which allows him to accelerate his healing process.

In addition to his combat skills, Bronze Tiger is recognized as an effective field leader within the Suicide Squad. He has the ability to gather and utilize available resources to his advantage, displaying his leadership prowess. Moreover, Bronze Tiger is regarded as an expert spy, having been a member of the Syndicate, a council composed of renowned spies. He serves as a valuable informant in the mercenary community, leveraging his extensive knowledge and experience in espionage.

=== Equipment ===

* Magic talisman: In the New 52 and subsequent iterations, the character possesses a magical talisman that grants him the ability to transform into a humanoid tiger.
* Tekkō-kagi&quot;:&quot; In the New 52 and subsequent iterations, Bronze Tiger is occasionally depicted wielding clawed gauntlets. These gauntlets serve a dual purpose, enabling him to both attack and defend. With natural hand motions, he can slash and block opponents, utilizing them for offensive and defensive maneuvers. Furthermore, when employed skillfully, the gauntlets can be used to ensnare and disarm weapons.

<text>Philip Wells Woods (November 2, 1931 – September 29, 2015) was an American jazz alto saxophonist, clarinetist, bandleader, and composer.

==Biography==
Woods was born in Springfield, Massachusetts. After inheriting a saxophone at age 12, he began taking lessons from Harvey LaRose at a local music shop. His heroes on the alto saxophone included Benny Carter and Johnny Hodges. He studied music with Lennie Tristano at the Manhattan School of Music and at the Juilliard School. His friend, Joe Lopes, coached him on clarinet as there was no saxophone major at Juilliard at the time and received a bachelor’s degree in 1952. Although he did not copy Charlie Parker, Woods was known as the New Bird, a nickname also given to other alto saxophone players such as Sonny Stitt and Cannonball Adderley.

In the 1950s, Woods began to lead his own bands. Quincy Jones invited him to accompany Dizzy Gillespie on a world tour sponsored by the U.S. State Department. A few years later he toured Europe with Jones, and in 1962 he toured Russia with Benny Goodman.

After moving to France in 1968, Woods led the European Rhythm Machine, a group which tended toward avant-garde jazz. He returned to the United States in 1972 and, after an unsuccessful attempt to establish an electronic group, he formed a quintet which was still performing, with some changes of personnel, in 2004. As his theme, Woods used a piece titled &quot;How&#x27;s Your Mama?&quot;

Woods earned the top alto sax player award almost 30 times in &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual readers&#x27; poll. His quintet was awarded the top small combo title several times.

In 1979, Woods recorded the album &quot;More Live&quot; at Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin, Texas. Perhaps his best known recorded work as a sideman is a pop piece, his alto sax solo on Billy Joel&#x27;s 1977 &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;. He also played the alto sax solo on Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Wu&quot; from their 1975 album &quot;Katy Lied&quot;, as well as Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Have a Good Time&quot; from the 1975 album &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot;.

Although Woods was primarily a saxophonist, he was also a clarinet player and solos can be found scattered through his recordings. One particular example is his clarinet solo on &quot;Misirlou&quot; on the compilation album, &quot;Into the Woods&quot;.

Woods, along with Rick Chamberlain and Ed Joubert, founded the organization Celebration of the Arts (COTA) in 1978 late one night in the bar at the Deer Head Inn in Delaware Water Gap. The organization would eventually become the Delaware Water Gap Celebration of the Arts. Their initial goal was to help foster an appreciation of jazz and its relationship to other artistic disciplines. Each year, the organization hosts the Celebration of the Arts Festival in the town of Delaware Water Gap in September.

In 2005, Jazzed Media released the documentary &quot;Phil Woods: A Life in E Flat – Portrait of a Jazz Legend&quot;, directed by Rich Lerner and produced by Graham Carter.

Woods was married to Chan Parker, the common-law wife of Charlie Parker, for seventeen years and was the stepfather to Chan&#x27;s daughter, Kim. On September 4, 2015, he performed a tribute to &quot;Charlie Parker with Strings&quot; at the Manchester Craftsmen&#x27;s Guild and announced at the end of the show that he would be retiring. He died a little more than three weeks later of emphysema on September 29, 2015, at the age of 83.

<doc id="896893" wikidata="Q1680829" url="?curid=896893" title="James Miller (filmmaker)">
<text>James Henry Dominic Miller (18 December 1968 – 2 May 2003) was a Welsh cameraman, producer, and director, and recipient of numerous awards, including five Emmy Awards. He was killed by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) gunfire while filming a documentary in the Gaza Strip. Miller worked regularly with Saira Shah for several years, and they formed a business partnership to operate an independent production company called Frostbite Productions in 2001.

The Israeli Military Police investigation into Miller&#x27;s death closed on 9 March 2005 with an announcement that the soldier suspected of firing the shot would not be indicted as they could not establish that his shot was responsible, though he would be disciplined for violating the rules of engagement and for changing his account of the incident. On 6 April 2006, the inquest jury at St Pancras Coroner&#x27;s Court in London returned a verdict of unlawful killing, finding that Miller had been &quot;murdered.&quot; Forensic experts from London Metropolitan Police concluded that the bullets were consistent with those used by the IDF. After meetings with the Miller family, the Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, sent a formal request to his Israeli counterpart in June 2007 for prosecution proceedings to be enacted within six weeks against the soldier responsible for firing the shot. The requests were ignored by the Israeli government and prosecution proceedings have never been held.

== Early life and family ==
James Miller was born in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, Wales the younger son of Geoffrey Miller, an army officer who later rose to the rank of colonel, and his wife, Eileen, a headmistress. He grew up in the West Country, but from ages six to eight lived in the Outer Hebrides, where his father was posted. Raised as a Roman Catholic, he maintained that faith for the whole of his life. He was educated at Downside and later at the London College of Printing, where within a few weeks his tutors promoted him to the postgraduate course in photo-journalism. He worked as a photographer before moving to television.

In 1997, he married Sophy Warren-Knott, with whom he had a son, Alexander, and a daughter, Charlotte.

==Career==
Miller started his working life as a freelance cameraman, and in 1995 joined the Frontline News collective as cameraman, producer, and director. He reported from the civil war in Algeria and from most of the world&#x27;s major trouble spots from 1995 onwards, working for CNN, and for all the leading news broadcasters in Britain.

In 1999 he made his first film for Hardcash Productions, &quot;Prime Suspects&quot;, about a massacre in Kosovo for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme. This film won the Royal Television Society (RTS) award for International Current Affairs in 1999. Almost every film he made for Hardcash won major awards. &quot;Prime Suspects&quot; was followed by &quot;Dying for the President&quot; about the Second Chechen War and &quot;Children of the Secret State&quot; about Korea, both also for &quot;Dispatches&quot;.

Miller then formed a professional association with television reporter Saira Shah, to make &quot;Beneath the Veil&quot;, about the life of women in Taliban-run Afghanistan. This film, shown on &quot;Dispatches&quot; and CNN, repeated the success of &quot;Prime Suspects&quot; by again winning the RTS International Current Affairs award. It also won an Emmy Award, a BAFTA, and the RTS &quot;Programme of the Year&quot; award. In addition, Miller won the RTS craft award for his outstanding photography. Miller and Shah&#x27;s second film, &quot;Unholy War&quot;, shot at the height of the Afghanistan war in 2001, won Miller his first Emmy as director and (together with &quot;Beneath the Veil&quot;) also the prestigious Peabody award. Miller and Shah almost died of sub-zero temperatures while crossing the Hindu Kush during the making of this film. Frostbite Films was the name of the independent film production company set up by Miller and Shah in 2001 after this experience.

Miller and Shah were working on a documentary for the American cable network HBO at the time of his death. The resulting film, &quot;Death in Gaza&quot;, was released in 2004, and won three Emmys and one BAFTA TV award in 2005. Miller received posthumously the Rory Peck Award for Features in 2004 for &quot;Death in Gaza&quot;, having been a finalist on three previous occasions.

After Miller&#x27;s death, his friend Fergal Keane wrote: &quot;James Miller was one of the finest journalistic talents I have ever known. Had he lived he would undoubtedly have come to be recognised as one of the greatest documentary makers of his generation. As it is he leaves a journalistic legacy of immense worth.&quot;

==Death==
The documentary which Miller was making on the day of his death (&quot;Death in Gaza&quot;, released by HBO in 2004) depicts Miller and his colleagues leaving the home of a Palestinian family in the Rafah refugee camp after dark, carrying a white flag, towards two IDF armored personnel carriers manned by nine soldiers of the Desert Reconnaissance Battalion, a unit of Bedouin Arab-Israeli soldiers. They had walked about 20 metres from the veranda when the first shot rang out. For 13 seconds, there was silence broken only by Shah&#x27;s cry: &quot;We are British journalists.&quot; Then came the second shot, which killed Miller. He was shot in the front of his neck. The soldier who shot him was identified as First Lieutenant Hib al-Heib. According to a forensic expert, the fatal shot was fired from less than 200 metres away. Immediately after the shooting, the IDF said that Miller had been shot in the back during crossfire. It later retracted the assertion that he had been shot in the back. According to witnesses there was no crossfire and none can be heard on the APTN tape.

An IDF spokesperson made the following statement after Miller&#x27;s death: &quot;The IDF expresses sorrow at the death of the cameraman who entered a combat zone. Cameramen who knowingly enter a combat zone endanger themselves as well as the troops, and clearly run the risk of being caught in the crossfire.&quot; An IDF spokesperson described the circumstances of his death as occurring during &quot;an operation taking place at night, in which the [Israeli] force was under fire and in which the force returned fire with light weapons.&quot;

IDF spokesman, Captain Jacob Dallal said, &quot;Our forces found a tunnel at the house in question, when an anti-tank missile was fired on them. They shot back at the source of the attack ... James Miller was apparently hit during that exchange. The Israeli military expresses sorrow at a civilian death, but it must be stressed that a cameraman who knowingly enters a combat zone, especially at night, endangers himself.&quot;

==Aftermath==
On 9 March 2005, the IDF closed the Miller case, announcing that the soldier believed responsible for the shooting would not be indicted. Military Advocate General Avichai Mandelblit ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. The army said Military Police had carefully investigated the incident but had been unable to establish the soldier&#x27;s guilt. &quot;The findings of the military police show that an Israel Defense Forces lieutenant, the commanding officer of the IDF force at the site, allegedly fired his weapon in breach of IDF Rules of engagement,&quot; a statement said. &quot;However, it is not legally possible to link this shooting to the gunshot sustained by Mr. Miller.&quot; The army did say that the soldier would be disciplined for violating the rules of engagement and for changing his account of the incident. It did not elaborate. Heib was subjected to a disciplinary hearing before Brigadier General Guy Tzur, head of the IDF Southern Command. Despite advice from the Israeli Military Advocate General that he be disciplined for breaching the rules of engagement, illegal use of weapons, and misconduct during the investigation, he was cleared of wrongdoing. Military prosecutors appealed the acquittal, but he was cleared in a second hearing as well. Heib was subsequently promoted from First Lieutenant to Captain.

Miller&#x27;s family expressed disappointment at the decision. His widow Sophy said, &quot;Nothing can express our outrage that, waiting for two years and putting our faith in a system which has now failed to deliver, we still have prosecutors who suspect and continue to suspect a commanding officer and who will only bring disciplinary measures because of an initial flawed investigative process. The truth will come out and we hope the Israeli judicial system will mete out justice. This investigation does not serve the IDF, decent Israeli citizens, us, his family, and, above all, James.&quot;

British Foreign Office Minister Baroness Symons said she was &quot;dismayed&quot; by the decision. &quot;I deeply sympathize with James&#x27; family, who have worked so hard to secure justice for James. The British government will continue to raise James&#x27;s case with the government of Israel.&quot;

The Metropolitan Police opened an investigation into Miller&#x27;s death which was led by Detective Rob Anderson of the Specialist Crime Directorate. Anderson later told the inquest that the investigation was hampered by Israel&#x27;s unwillingness to cooperate. The Metropolitan Police was refused permission to send officers to Israel and the Gaza Strip in order to visit the site of the shooting and interview soldiers and witnesses to the incident and the Israeli government did not release vital documents to the Coroner. Based on the evidence available to the investigation, Anderson concluded that Miller could only have been killed by gunfire from Israeli soldiers.

=== Legal action against Israeli government ===
On 2 May 2005, the second anniversary of Miller&#x27;s death, his family initiated a lawsuit against the Israeli government. The family charge that the Israeli army did not act with reasonable caution when troops opened fire on Miller, who was holding a white flag. Miller&#x27;s widow Sophy said the family was determined to find justice and put an end to the &quot;culture of impunity&quot; within the Israeli army. &quot;It is our hope that as well as accountability for James&#x27; death a successful civil case will go some way towards changing this and in doing so may make Israeli soldiers think twice about shooting innocent civilians,&quot; she told The Guardian.

More than two years later, on 5 August 2007, the family&#x27;s lawyer, Michael Sfard, said, &quot;The family demands justice, both criminal and civil. They deserve that the man who shot their loved one for no reason whatsoever should be indicted and get what he deserves. As he left a widow and two children, they deserve to be compensated by the State of Israel. This is something the political and military echelons have promised time and again, but they have not fulfilled their promise so far.&quot;

On 1 February 2009 it was reported that James Miller&#x27;s family had accepted a £1.5 million payout from Israel. In a statement, the family did not confirm the amount paid but did say that it was &quot;probably the closest we&#x27;ll get to an admission of guilt on the part of the Israelis&quot;.

==Coroner&#x27;s inquest==
The inquest into Miller&#x27;s death opened at the St Pancras Coroner&#x27;s Court in London on 3 April 2006.

Giving evidence at the inquest, Miller&#x27;s wife Sophy named the Israeli soldier who shot her husband as First Lieutenant Heib from the Bedouin Desert Reconnaissance Battalion, who was commanding a unit at the time of the killing on 2 May 2003. She said that the IDF had given out misleading information from the moment her husband was shot, and that Lt. Heib had given six testimonies, all of which were conflicting.

Footage of Miller&#x27;s death was shown to an unnamed Israeli soldier who was quoted as saying that members of the IDF should not fire unless they felt they were under threat. He was quoted as saying: &quot;There is no chance that it was an accident – the soldier could clearly see him, it was a perfect shot. I do not know what to say, it looks like murder, it looks like he wants to kill him.&quot;

The court heard that an autopsy proved that Miller died from a &quot;classic sniper&#x27;s shot&quot;, and that the bullet was consistent with that used by the IDF. Independent investigator Chris Cobb-Smith, who had previously served in the British Army and as an Iraq weapons inspector, found there was no way the soldier fired by accident. He told the court, &quot;This was calculated and cold-blooded murder, without a shadow of a doubt.&quot; He added, &quot;These shots were not fired by a soldier who was frightened, not fired by a soldier facing incoming fire – these were slow, deliberate, calculated and aimed shots ... It is a soldier aiming and firing deliberately. He should not have been firing anywhere near a lit building, anywhere near where he knew there were women, children or foreign journalists.&quot;

Daniel Edge, Miller&#x27;s assistant producer, (who narrowly escaped being shot himself during the same incident) said Israeli soldiers put pressure on him to say that the shot came from Palestinians. He told the inquest: &quot;They personally tried to get me to say the sentence &#x27;James could have been shot by a Palestinian&#x27;, which I refused to say.&quot;

On 6 April 2006, the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing, finding that he had been &quot;murdered&quot;. Miller&#x27;s family asked that the British government ensure his killer is prosecuted, accusing the Israeli authorities of &quot;an abject failure to uphold the fundamental and unequivocal standards of international humanitarian and human rights law.&quot;

==Request for prosecution==
In June 2007, Lord Goldsmith, the then outgoing Attorney General for England and Wales, sent a request to his Israeli counterpart, Attorney General Menachem Mazuz, for legal proceedings to be enacted within six weeks to prosecute the soldier responsible for the killing, which included new analysis of audio evidence which confirmed that the shot that killed Miller was fired from an Israeli armored personnel carrier. The request stipulated that if Israel failed to respond within six weeks, British authorities would consider prosecuting Captain al-Heib in the UK.

Miller&#x27;s sister, Anne Waddington, was interviewed by the BBC on the morning of 7 August 2007, the day the six-week deadline was due to expire. She said, &quot;Unfortunately, we have had four and a half extremely painful years of experiencing the Israeli tactics, and they are the masters of delay – they have always played for time, and they have always failed to deliver.&quot; She added, &quot;The Israelis put out a lot of false and misleading statements immediately after my brother was murdered, and they did try to suggest he was killed by a Palestinian in the back and as a result of crossfire, but they put out many, many lies and false stories, which of course have been shown not only on the APTN video footage of the actual murder, but also through eyewitness testimony and the additional evidence which was very, very clear at the time.&quot; Asked whether she used the word &quot;murder&quot; very deliberately, she replied, &quot;Yes I do, and of course the jury in the inquest last year found, very unusually, that it wasn&#x27;t just unlawful killing, it was actually murder.&quot;

On 7 August 2007, Mazuz requested more information on the new analysis. After being informed of his response, Miller&#x27;s family issued a statement:

We are very pleased that General Mazuz has replied within the time limit set out in Lord Goldsmith&#x27;s letter. This information has for the most part been in the possession of the Israeli investigators for more than four years.
We will look on with interest to see whether Israel will seek to undermine the expertise of the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s acoustic examination, or perhaps this will be the first significant step towards Israel pursuing justice.

At the request of Miller&#x27;s family, Lord Goldsmith agreed to ask the UK Crown Prosecution Service to advise &quot;on whether there is enough evidence for a prosecution in the UK under the Geneva Conventions Act in which case the UK government could request extradition.&quot; Eventually, the Israeli government agreed to pay the Miller family £1.75 million, if the British government agreed to close the case, and not demand the extradition of the Israeli soldiers involved in his killing.

<doc id="896894" wikidata="Q1049360" url="?curid=896894" title="Castle Geyser">
<text>Castle Geyser is a cone geyser in the Upper Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park. It is noted for the particularly large geyserite sinter deposits, which form its cone. These deposits have been likened in appearance to a castle.

When the geyser was given this name in 1870, the top edges of the structure resembled the typical profile associated with the modern concept of a castle, having the appearance of a large keep, multiple turrets, and especially because of the crenellation along the top edges of what resembled its towers. As the drawing below shows the cone had distinctive appearance at the time. Over time the cone&#x27;s shape changes because of the layers of mineral deposited in successive eruptions.

==History==

On September 18, 1870, the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition entered the Upper Geyser Basin. Eventually, members of the expedition named seven geysers they observed in the basin. The appearance of this geyser led Lieutenant Gustavus Cheyney Doane to name it &quot;Castle Geyser&quot;. Nathaniel P. Langford gave this account in his 1871 Scribner&#x27;s article:

&quot;The Castle,&quot; situated on the summit of an incrusted mound, has a turreted crater through which a large volume of water is expelled at intervals of two or three hours to the height of , from a discharging orifice about in diameter. The architectural features of the silicious sinter surrounding it, which is very massive and compact, indicating that at some former period the flow of water must have been much greater than at present, suggested its name. A vent near it is constantly discharging a large stream of boiling water, and when the geyser is in action the water in this vent boils and bubbles with great fierceness.
==Eruption==
The Castle Geyser has a 16- to 17-hour eruption cycle. The geyser erupts hot water for about 20 minutes in a vertical column that reaches a height of before changing to a noisy steam phase that issues for 30 to 40 minutes.

The sinter cone for Castle Geyser has been dated to around 1022 using carbon-14 dating. This date is much younger than the originally-presumed age of 5,000 to 15,000 years. A 3-D laser scan made of the cone reveals evidence that this geyser has evolved through four to five distinct stages to reach its current configuration.

In November 2002, the Denali earthquake in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska caused Castle Geyser, as well as other geysers in Yellowstone, to decrease in eruption frequency. The affected geysers have returned to their previous pattern since that time, however.

<text>Presidential elections were held in São Tomé and Príncipe on 29 July 2001. They were the nation&#x27;s third presidential elections since the introduction of multi-party politics in 1990. Incumbent Miguel Trovoada was constitutionally barred from participating in the election having served the maximum of two five year terms. The two top contenders for the position were Fradique de Menezes, a wealthy businessman, and Manuel Pinto da Costa, former President and founder of the former single-party, the MLSTP/PSD. The elections, deemed free and fair by international observers, were won in the first round by Menezes. He was sworn in as the third president of São Tomé and Príncipe on 3 September 2001. Voter turnout was 70.7%.

<text>The planes of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; roleplaying game constitute the multiverse in which the game takes place. Each plane is a universe with its own rules with regard to gravity, geography, magic and morality. There have been various official cosmologies over the course of the different editions of the game; these cosmologies describe the structure of the standard &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; multiverse.

The concept of the Inner, Ethereal, Prime Material, Astral, and Outer Planes was introduced in the earliest versions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;; at the time there were only four Inner Planes and no set number of Outer Planes. This later evolved into what became known as the Great Wheel cosmology. The 4th Edition of the game shifted to the World Axis cosmology. The 5th Edition brought back a new version of the Great Wheel cosmology which includes aspects of World Axis model.

In addition, some &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; settings have cosmologies that are very different from the &quot;standard&quot; ones discussed here. For example, the &quot;Eberron&quot; setting has only thirteen planes, all of which are unique to &quot;Eberron&quot;.
== Publication history ==
The cosmology of the planes was presented for the first time, as part of the Great Wheel of Planes, in Volume 1, Number 8 of &quot;The Dragon&quot;, released July 1977. In the article &quot;Planes: The Concepts of Spatial, Temporal and Physical Relationships in D&amp;D&quot;, Gary Gygax mentions that there are 16 Outer Planes. The &quot;Basic edition&quot; of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; had a separate, though similar, cosmology from that of its contemporary &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game, which is a more open planar system that is less regulated than that of its counterpart.

The planes were further &quot;refined in the &quot;Players Handbook&quot; (1978) and &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; (1980)&quot;. The appendix of the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; included an abstract diagram of the planes, and mentioned the same 16 Outer Planes. Shannon Appelcline, the author of &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, highlighted that throughout the early 1980s &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine would continue to detail &quot;some of the planes in more depth&quot;, however, &quot;there was no overarching plan for the planes of D&amp;D other than a few increasingly old drawings&quot;. The multiverse of the &quot;Basic D&amp;D&quot; game was expanded with the &quot;D&amp;D Immortals Rules&quot; (1986) set. The Astral Plane runs through and links the rest of the Multiverse. Plane can range in size from the tiniest Attoplane (1/3 inch long), to the Standard Plane (.085 light-years long), up to the Terraplane (851 billion light years long), with stars and planets scaled to match the size of the plane.

Both Appelcline and Curtis D. Carbonell, in his book the &quot;Dread Trident: Tabletop Role-Playing Games and the Modern Fantastic&quot;, highlighted that information on the planes and the shared cosmology was codified in the &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (1987) and &quot;Tales of the Outer Planes&quot; (1988). Carbonell wrote that project leader and designer Jeff Grubb detailed &quot;the schematization of the planes&#x27; requisite five area: the Prime Material, the Ethereal, the Astral, the Inner, and the Outer planes. This basic structure is still used in 5e, with some changes that provide minor rearrangements and clarifications [...]. Grubb&#x27;s approach demonstrated a need to codify, while still remaining flexible, that has remained as a primary aim of the latest edition&quot;.

Carbonell also highlighted that the 1989 Spelljammer campaign setting added cosmology that &quot;allowed travel between the different settings&quot; such as &quot;Dragonlance&quot;, &quot;Greyhawk&quot;, and the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;. However, campaign settings such as &quot;Dark Sun&quot; and &quot;Ravenloft&quot; were inaccessible in this cosmology. Then in 1993, TSR wanted to do a series of books about the Outer Planes which Zeb Cook said led to the creation of the Planescape campaign setting released in 1994. This campaign setting provided a framework to create adventures across the planes with the city of Sigil acting as a hometown and starting point for players. Carbonell called this setting &quot;the most complex example of the multiverse created during the varieties of 2e&#x27;s AD&amp;D settings&quot; and wrote: &quot;A more nuanced and sophisticated attempt at harmonization, Planescape provided an alternate way to travel between the planes than Spelljammer&#x27;s science-fantasy-oriented approach&quot;. The 3rd edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (2001) detailed both the inner and outer planes. Kevin Kulp, for DMs Guild, wrote that &quot;the authors used an approach that said &#x27;here&#x27;s how it&#x27;s been done in the past, and here are other ways you can do it,&#x27; which allowed the book to avoid setting planar mechanics in stone. Instead it gave DMs a modular approach by presenting Options, a flexible strategy that pleased both 1e and Planescape fans. Vast amounts of new ideas and new locations were presented, dovetailing nicely with canon from earlier editions&quot;.

The 4th edition shifted the locations of the various planes to fit the new World Axis cosmology and added the Parallel Planes of the Feywild and the Shadowfell to the game; many of the changes were detailed in that edition&#x27;s &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (2008). However, the 5th edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2014) and &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2014) shifted most of the cosmology of the planes back to the Great Wheel model with some aspects of the World Axis model retained in the descriptions of the inner planes.

== Great Wheel cosmology ==
The cosmology outlined in the Great Wheel model contains sixteen Outer Planes which are arranged in a ring of sixteen planes with the Good-aligned planes (or &quot;Upper Planes&quot;) at the top, and the Evil-aligned planes (or &quot;Lower Planes&quot;) at the bottom. Depictions usually display the Lawful planes (or Planes of Law) to the left, and the Chaotic planes (or Planes of Chaos) to the right. Between all of these sit the Neutral planes, or the Planes of Conflict. The center contains the Inner and Material Planes.

One further plane sits in the center of the ring, the Outlands, being neutral in alignment. At the center of the Outlands is a Spire of infinite height; the city of Sigil floats above the Spire&#x27;s pinnacle.

Many Outer Planes were renamed in &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd Edition in the &quot;Planescape&quot; campaign setting, released in 1994. In the 3rd Edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (2001), the old and new names were combined, the Demiplane of Shadow was promoted to the Plane of Shadow, the Prime Material Plane was shortened to the Material Plane, and it was stated that each Material Plane is connected to its own unique Ethereal Plane.

The cosmology is usually presented as a series of concentric circles, with alternating spatial and transitive planes; from the center outwards, they are ordered as follows: Inner, Ethereal, Material, Astral, Outer Planes, and the Far Realm. The Shadow Plane and the Dimension of Time, if they are included, are separate from the others, and usually represented as being connected to the Material Plane. Demiplanes, although most commonly connected to the Ethereal Plane, can be found attached to any plane. All planes, save the demiplanes, are infinite in extent.

Planes may border (be coterminous) or may be coexistent. In particular, the Ethereal and Shadow planes are coexistent with the Material Plane. In effect, the &quot;boundary&quot; between the two extends through all of space. Thus a ghost in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, which is an ethereal creature, has a location on the Material Plane when it is near the border of the Material and Ethereal planes. It can &quot;manifest&quot; itself into the Material, and force attacks launched from the Material can hit it.

=== Inner Planes ===
The Inner Planes are made up of elemental matter and forces. They consist of the Elemental Planes of air, earth, fire and water, and the Energy Planes. Some descriptions also contain the Para-elemental (magma, ice, etc.) and Quasi-elemental planes (lightning, dust, etc.) linking them. The energy planes are the Positive Material Plane and Negative Material Plane.

In his review of the &quot;Planescape Campaign Setting&quot; boxed set, Gene Alloway felt that the set would provide players with a good sense of &quot;the sheer force of nature that drives all the Inner Planes. The Inner Planes don&#x27;t have anything against you—they&#x27;re hard on everyone.&quot; &quot;Backstab&quot; magazine reviewers Lord Winfield and Kaneda found the Inner Planes among the places in the Planescape setting least visited by player characters, which do not lend themselves to a prolonged stay.

While the 5th Edition returned to the Great Wheel model, the Inner Planes detailed in that edition &quot;retain aspects&quot; of the 4th Edition World Axis model: &quot;The four elemental planes are back, but they remain tightly integrated with the material plane as its creative foundation. The paraelemental planes have also returned for the first time since Planescape, but they have more evocative names. The Plane of Ash is known as the Great Conflagration, the Plane of Ice is the Frostfell, the Plane of Magma is the Fountains of Creation, and the Plane of Ooze is the Swamp of Oblivion. Additionally, the Elemental Chaos is the churning realm within which the Inner Planes are held&quot;. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; highlighted that the parts of the Inner Planes closest to the Material Plane will seem the most familiar to adventurers with features such as humanoid inhabitants and cities. However, the further adventurers venture &quot;out into the Inner Planes, things become less familiar. Each plane starts to resemble its purest form, making it harder to travel without powerful magical spells that protect the party from the environment. If a traveler goes far enough, they will reach the Elemental Chaos, where the boundaries of the Inner Planes start to break down – and where some truly alien monsters exist&quot;.

===Material Planes===
The Material Planes are worlds that balance between the philosophical forces of the Outer Planes and the physical forces of the Inner Planes—these are the standard worlds of fantasy RPG campaigns. The Prime Material Plane is where the more &#x27;normal&#x27; worlds exist, many of which resemble Earth. The 2nd edition &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; states there are several Prime Material Planes, but several other 2nd edition products say there is only one Prime Material Plane rather than several.

Introduced in the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; setting, the Phlogiston is a part of the Material plane. It is a highly flammable gaseous medium in which crystal spheres holding various Prime Material solar systems float, traversable by Spelljammer ships.

The Feywild and the Shadowfell, the Parallel Planes introduced in the 4th Edition World Axis model, were incorporated into the 5th Edition version of the Great Wheel model. In 2015, &quot;D&amp;D&quot; Creative Director Chris Perkins stated that 4th Edition sourcebooks on these planes were the best source of information for the 5th Edition. The adventure module &quot;The Wild Beyond the Witchlight&quot; (2021) is the first in-depth 5th Edition exploration of the Feywild and builds on the description included in the 5th Edition &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2014).

=== Outer Planes ===

Alignment-based planes. The home of gods, dead souls, and raw philosophy and belief.

=== Transitive planes ===
The transitive planes connect the other planes and generally contain little, if any, solid matter or native life.

==== Astral Plane ====
The Astral Plane is the plane of thought, memory, and psychic energy; it is where gods go when they die or are forgotten (or, most likely, both). It is a barren place with only rare bits of solid matter. The Astral Plane is unique in that it is infinitesimal instead of infinite; there is no space or time here, though both catch up with beings when they leave. The souls of the newly dead from the Prime Material Plane pass through here on their way to the afterlife or Outer Planes.

The most common feature of the Astral Plane is the silver cords of travelers using an astral projection spell. These cords are the lifelines that keep travelers of the plane from becoming lost, stretching all the way back to the traveler&#x27;s point of origin.

A god-isle is the immense petrified remains of a dead god that float on the Astral Plane, where githyanki and others often mine them for minerals and build communities on their stony surfaces. Tu&#x27;narath, the capital city of the githyanki, is built on the petrified corpse of a dead god known only as &quot;The One in the Void&quot;. God-isles often have unusual effects on those nearby, including causing strange dreams of things that happened to the god when it was alive. God-isles are also the only locations on the Astral Plane that are known to possess gravity or normal time flows.

Part of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot; takes place on the Astral Plane.

Trenton Webb for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine comments that &quot;A Guide to the Astral Plane&quot; &quot;breathes life into what had hitherto been little more than a planar motorway. Essentially infinite and filled with few &#x27;solid locations&#x27; or indigenous species, the Astral Plane should by rights be a dull place. Yet with some deft imaginative touches and sleight of logic, the guide transforms this dead zone into a wonderfully different &#x27;world&#x27;.&quot; He adds that &quot;By expanding the accepted &#x27;physics&#x27; of the Astral plane and applying classic Planescape thinking, the Silver Void is made solid and comprehensible.&quot;

==== Ethereal Plane ====
The Ethereal is often likened to an ocean, but rather than water it is a sea of boundless possibility. It consists of two parts: the Border Ethereal which connects to the Inner and Prime Material planes, and the Deep Ethereal plane which acts as the incubator to many potential demiplanes and other proto-magical realms. From a Border Ethereal plane a traveler can see a misty greyscale version of the plane from which they are traveling; however, each plane is only connected to its own Border Ethereal, which means inter-planar travel necessitates entering the Deep Ethereal and then exiting into the destination plane&#x27;s own Border Ethereal plane. Many demiplanes, such as that which houses the Ravenloft setting, can be found in the Deep Ethereal plane; most demiplanes are born here, and many fade back into nothingness here. Unlike the Astral Plane, in which solid objects can exist (though are extremely rare) anything and everything that goes to the Ethereal Plane becomes Ethereal. There is also something here called the Ether Cyclone that connects the Ethereal plane to the Astral Plane.

In the 3rd Edition, each Material Plane is attached to its own unique Ethereal Plane; use of the Deep Ethereal connecting these Ethereal Planes together is an optional rule.

==== Plane of Shadow ====

A fictional plane of existence in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, under the standard planar cosmology. A dimly lit dimension that is both conterminous to and coexistent with the Material Plane. It overlaps the Material Plane much as the Ethereal Plane does, so a planar traveler can use the Plane of Shadow to cover great distances quickly. The Plane of Shadow is also conterminous to other planes. With the right spell, a character can use the Plane of Shadow to visit other realities. It is magically morphic, and parts continually flow onto other planes. As a result, creating a precise map of the plane is next to impossible, despite the presence of landmarks. The Plane of Shadow is replaced by the Shadowfell in the 5th Edition.

In first edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, the Plane of Shadow was the largest Demi-Plane of the Ethereal Plane.

==== Mirror planes====
Mirror planes were introduced in the Third Edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; as an optional group of transitive planes. They are small planes that each connect to a group of mirrors that can be located in any other planes throughout the multiverse. A mirror plane takes the form of a long, winding corridor with the mirrors it attaches to hanging like windows along the walls. Mirror planes allow quick travel between the various mirrors that are linked to each, but each plane contains a mirror version of any traveler that enters it. This mirror version has an opposite alignment and will seek to slay their real self to take their place. All mirrors connect to a mirror plane, though each mirror plane usually has only five to twenty mirrors connecting to it.

==== Temporal Plane ====
The Plane of Time was known as the Temporal Prime in the 1995 book &quot;Chronomancer&quot;. It is a plane where physical travel can result in time travel.

In 3rd edition products, some of the detail of Temporal Prime became incorporated into the &quot;Temporal Energy Plane&quot; mentioned in the 3rd edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot;. &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; No. 353 associates it also with the &quot;Demiplane of Time&quot; that has appeared in various forms since 1st edition.

===Demiplanes===

Demiplanes are minor planes, most of which are artificial. They are commonly created by demigods and extremely powerful wizards and psions. Naturally-occurring demiplanes are rare; most such demiplanes are actually fragments of other planes that have somehow split off from their parent plane. Demiplanes are often constructed to resemble the Material Plane, though a few—mostly those created by non-humans—are quite alien. &quot;Genesis&quot;, a 9th level arcane spell or psionic power, and the 9th-level arcane spell &quot;Demiplane Seed&quot; are among the few printed methods for a player character to create a demiplane.

Among the most notable of demiplanes is the Demiplane of Dread, the setting of Ravenloft.

====Neth====
Neth, the Demiplane That Lives, was first presented in &quot;A Guide to the Ethereal Plane&quot;, a sourcebook for the &quot;Planescape&quot; setting of AD&amp;D Second Edition. It is a living, sentient plane of finite size that has an immense curiosity. The only access Neth has to the rest of the multiverse is through a single metallic, peach-colored pool on the Astral Plane. Those who look into the pool from the Astral Plane might notice a huge eye flash into focus on its surface, which quickly fades. The only thing native to Neth is the plane itself. Neth creates humanoid subunits of itself called Neth&#x27;s Children, sometimes for specific short-term purposes before reabsorbing them. At Neth&#x27;s center is a thick knot of membrane at least a mile across where all the folds come together. This serves as Neth&#x27;s brain. Other parts of the membrane also serve specific functions, which include areas where the membrane can be easily deformed for communication, encapsulation, and budding Neth&#x27;s Children.

The Visage Wall is an area of Neth&#x27;s membrane where Neth communicates with visitors. It contains thousands of head-shaped bumps that resemble the likenesses of those previously absorbed by Neth. Neth speaks to its visitors from about five or six of the heads simultaneously, questioning them to learn more of the outside universe. Sometimes, Neth will choose to encapsulate its visitors. Two folds of membrane will come together and ensnare and seal off the victims. Neth will then flood the compartment with either preservative or absorptive fluid. The preservative fluid will put the victim in temporal stasis, and the victim can be revived if the fluid is drained away. If the compartment is flooded with absorptive fluid, the victim will dissolve and be absorbed into Neth itself, including the victim&#x27;s memories.

Gravity on Neth is the same strength as that on the material world; however, Neth chooses the direction of gravity&#x27;s pull and may change it at will. Time is normal on Neth. Neth can move its interior membrane at will, creating or destroying fluid-filled spaces.

=== Other planes ===

====Far Realm====
The Far Realm is an alien dimension of cosmic horror. It is the home plane for many aberrations and strange monsters.

The Far Realm&#x27;s mix of horror, madness, and strange geometries was largely inspired by the work of American writer H. P. Lovecraft. It is particularly inspired by Lovecraft stories like &quot;Through the Gates of the Silver Key&quot;. It was created by Bruce Cordell, and introduced in the Second Edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventure module &quot;The Gates of Firestorm Peak&quot; (1996). James Jacobs later called Cordell&#x27;s work an &quot;adventure with a distinctly Lovecraftian feel&quot;, noting that &quot;Deep inside Firestorm Peak lies a portal to an insidious region beyond sanity and light known only as the Far Realm, and the unknowable but hostile entities of this hideous region prepare to pass through into the world.&quot; The adventure featured a magical portal that produced creatures and energies from the Far Realm.

In Third Edition, the Far Realm was incorporated into the Realm of Xoriat in the Eberron campaign setting. In Fourth Edition, the Far Realms were included in the new cosmology design of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. In this edition, members of the Warlock class can forge a pact (called the Starpact) with the entities from or near the Far Realm to gain power. The Far Realm&#x27;s association with the new setting has been detailed in various supplements. The Far Realm contains an infinite number of layers, these layers range from inches thick to miles, and it is often possible to perceive multiple layers simultaneously. These layers can grow, spawn further layers, breathe and possibly die. The Far Realm is home to many powerful and unspeakable beings ripped from the nightmares of the darkest minds of the waking world, beings so unfathomable that their very existence is a perversion of reality itself. These beings are governed by lords of unimaginable power and knowledge completely alien. The Far Realm is a plane far outside the others and often not included in the standard cosmology. It is sometimes referred to simply as &quot;Outside&quot;, because in many cosmologies it is literally outside reality as mortals understand it.

====Plane of Dreams====
The Plane of Dreams is a plane far outside the others and often not included in the standard cosmology. As its name suggests, all true dreams take place on the Plane of Dreams.

== The World Axis cosmology ==

4th edition uses a simplified default cosmology with only six major planes, each of which has a corresponding creature origin. The Astral Sea, Elemental Chaos, Feywild and Shadowfell are covered extensively in the &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot;, while the Far Realm and Sigil are covered briefly. Supplemental sourcebooks relating to the Elemental Chaos (&quot;The Plane Below&quot;) and the Astral Sea (&quot;The Plane Above&quot;) were released in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The Ethereal Plane has been removed entirely.

=== Fundamental Planes ===
The fundamental planes are two vast expanses from which the other planes were formed. It was the conflict between the inhabitants of each fundamental plane that constituted the Dawn War. The two Fundamental Planes are theoretically infinite; it is implied that if one departs the world of one campaign setting and sets out through either the Astral Sea or the Elemental Chaos, they will eventually reach the worlds of other campaign settings.

==== The Astral Sea ====
The corresponds to the Astral Plane of earlier editions. The &quot;Astral Dominions&quot;, counterparts to the Outer Planes of earlier editions, are planes which float within the Astral Sea. The majority of the gods dwell in Astral Dominions. The Astral Sea itself is spacially infinite, but the Astral Dominions are all finite. Creatures native to or connected with the Astral Sea (such as angels and devils) generally have the immortal origin. The plane is described in &quot;The Plane Above: Secrets of the Astral Sea&quot;, released in 2010. In the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting, the Astral Sea was formed from the collapse of the Outer Planes into the Astral Plane after Mystra&#x27;s murder, while in &quot;Eberron&quot;, the Astral Sea is equated with Siberys, the Dragon Above.

;Astral Dominions in the Points of Light setting
*&quot;Arvandor, the Verdant Isles&quot;: A realm of nature, beauty and magic similar to the Feywild. Home to Corellon and (sometimes) Sehanine.
*&quot;Baator, the Nine Hells&quot;: A place of sin and tyranny, a world of continent-sized caverns. Home to Asmodeus.
*&quot;Celestia, the Radiant Throne&quot;: A great mountain that drifts in a world of silver mists. Home to Bahamut, Moradin and, sometimes, Kord.
*&quot;Chernoggar, the Iron Fortress&quot;: The rust-pitted iron castle, where mighty warriors fight and die endlessly. Home to Bane and Gruumsh.
*&quot;Hestavar, the Bright City&quot;: a luminous metropolis which floats above sandy beaches and crystal-clear lagoons, the center of astral civilization. Home to Erathis, Ioun and Pelor.
*&quot;Kalandurren, the Darkened Pillars&quot;: A dominion that plays host to demons. It belonged to the god Amoth before he was killed by the demon lords Orcus and Demogorgon.
*&quot;Pandemonium&quot;: The former dominion of Tharizdun. The tower of the lich god Vecna is said to be hidden within it.
*&quot;Shom, the White Desert&quot;: The former dominion of the mysterious God of the Word. Astral giants loyal to the goddess Erathis fight for control of it.
*&quot;Tytherion, the Endless Night&quot;: A dark, arid wilderness where serpents and dragons lurk. Home to Zehir and Tiamat.

==== The Elemental Chaos ====
The Elemental Chaos corresponds to the Inner Planes of earlier editions (excluding the Positive and Negative Energy Planes), also containing some aspects of Limbo. The Elemental Chaos contains Elemental Realms, which are themselves planes; the Abyss is one such realm. The only god who dwells in the Elemental Chaos is Lolth, who resides on the 66th layer of the Abyss. The Elemental Chaos is spacially infinite, the Elemental Realms are not. Creatures native to or connected with the Elemental Chaos (including demons) generally have the &quot;elemental&quot; origin. The plane is described in &quot;The Plane Below: Secrets of the Elemental Chaos&quot;, released in 2010. In the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting, the Elemental Chaos was formed from the collapse of the Inner Planes after Mystra&#x27;s murder, while in &quot;Eberron&quot;, the Elemental Chaos is equated with Khyber, the Dragon Below.

=== Parallel Planes ===

==== The World ====
The equivalent to the Prime Material Plane or Material Plane of earlier editions. This plane lacks a formal name and is most often referred to as the World, although titles such as the Middle World and the First Work were also presented in &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot;. Creatures native to the world generally have the &quot;natural&quot; origin. The gods Avandra, Melora and Torog have their homes in the World. The god Vecna wanders the whole cosmos (Sehanine is prone to doing this as well). In the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting, the world is named Toril (there is another, inaccessible world called Abeir), while in &quot;Eberron&quot;, the world is equated with Eberron, the Dragon Between.

==== The Feywild ====
One of the two parallel planes, the Feywild is a more extreme and magical reflection of the world with some thematic links to the Positive Energy Plane and the Plane of Faerie of earlier editions and settings. Creatures native to or connected with the Feywild (such as elves and gnomes) generally have the &quot;fey&quot; origin. According to the 4th edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot;, this plane has some sort of unspecified connection to &quot;Arvandor&quot;, and is suspected that the Dominion of Corellon can be reached by here. Important locales within the Feywild are known as Fey Demesnes. Additional details on the Feywild were included in the 4th edition supplement &quot;Heroes of the Feywild&quot; (2011) which added storytelling and mechanics themed around the Feywild. The Feywild was next explored in-depth in the 5th adventure module &quot;The Wild Beyond the Witchlight&quot; (2021) and the corresponding &quot;Domains of Delight&quot; (2021) supplement (an official PDF by Wizards of the Coast released on the Dungeon Masters Guild). The 5th edition added the concept of Domains of Delight similar to Ravenloft&#x27;s Domains of Dread; each domain is ruled by an Archfey who can shape their region via their will. Chris Perkins, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Principal Story Designer, explained that &quot;the Feywild is described in the fifth edition &quot;Dungeon Master’s Guide&quot;, which builds on material from earlier editions. &quot;The Wild Beyond the Witchlight&quot; used the DMG’s description as a starting point and expanded from there. The concept of archfey – powerful Fey creatures who carve out domains for themselves – dates back to earlier editions, but this is the first time we’ve given these domains a name&quot;.

In the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting, the Feywild is also known as the Plane of Faerie and has come into alignment with Toril after countless millennia of drifting away, while in &quot;Eberron&quot;, the Feywild is equated with Thelanis, formerly known as the Faerie Court.

&quot;SyFy Wire&quot; highlighted that &quot;traditionally, the Feywild is an alternate plane of existence that mirrors and overlaps the material world. It&#x27;s a place of perpetual twilight that&#x27;s full of both enticing beauty and terrible dangers. Time works differently inside the Feywild, and those who leave may find what they thought was a brief venture instead lasted years — assuming they&#x27;re even able to leave at all. In short, it&#x27;s a good place for a magical and eerie adventure&quot;.

;Locations within the Feywild
==== The Shadowfell ====
The Shadowfell is a type of underworld, and the thematic successor to the Negative Energy Plane and Plane of Shadow from earlier editions. The Raven Queen makes her home here rather than the Astral Sea. It also incorporates the Domains of Dread, areas created by the shadows cast by great tragedies in the world. &quot;CBR&quot; highlighted that &quot;if the Feywild is the Prime Material&#x27;s dream reflection, the Shadowfell is a mirror of its darkness, drawing from the shadows and gloom in a way that makes it impossible to forget that, where there is light and life, there is also darkness and decay. [...] Home to numerous species, the most prominent entities who dwell in the Shadowfell are mysterious undead beings called shadows. Shadow dragons and shadow mastiffs can also be found there, along with a host of dark, terrifying creatures like wraiths, spectres, darkweavers and shadow demons. There are also a number of humanoid natives, including gnomes, humans, halflings and beings known as Shadar-Kai&quot;.

The plane is described in the boxed set &quot;The Shadowfell: Gloomwrought and Beyond&quot;, released in 2011. In the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting, the Shadowfell was formed from what was left of the Plane of Shadow after Mystra&#x27;s murder, while in &quot;Eberron&quot;, the Shadowfell is equated with Dolurrh, the realm of the dead.
;Locations within the Shadowfell
=== Demiplanes ===
Demiplanes are relatively small planes which are not part of larger planes. The most prominent demiplane is Sigil, the City of Doors, which is largely unchanged from earlier editions.

=== Anomalous planes ===
Anomalous planes are planes which do not fit into other categories. The most prominent of these planes are the Realm of Dreams, which can be reached via the Astral Sea, and the Far Realm, which breaks through into the remote parts of the Astral and the world.

==== The Far Realm ====
An anomalous plane, the Far Realm is a bizarre, maddening plane said to be composed of thin layers filled with strange liquids – at least, that is what the most coherent descriptions say, for though some escape the Far Realm with their lives, most do not do so with their sanity. Visitors to the Far Realm can only exist in one layer at a time, but large Far Realm natives can exist in multiple layers at once. Creatures native to or connected with the Far Realm generally have the aberrant origin. The Far Realm was originally sealed off from reality by a crystalline structure known as the Living Gate, which lay at the top of the Astral Sea. The Living Gate awoke and opened during the Dawn War between the gods and primordials, and was destroyed in the same war, thus enabling freer transit between the planes than should be allowed. Classic creatures such as aboleths, beholders, and mind flayers originate in the Far Realm. Distant stars have been driven mad by proximity to the Far Realm, resulting in the abominations known as starspawn. Natural humanoids tainted by the Far Realm are known as foulspawn. The Far Realm is occasionally referred to as &quot;Outside&quot;, because it seems to exist outside of reality as defined by the world, the fundamental planes and the parallel planes.

In &quot;Eberron&quot;, the Far Realm is equated with Xoriat, the Realm of Madness.

== Other fictional interpretations ==

Within the context of the game, there are many theories of the organization of the planes. For instance, in some lands it is believed that there are multiple Prime Material planes, rather than one containing all the worlds or planets. In these lands the Ethereal planes are believed to surround each Prime Material plane.

Additionally, other &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; cosmologies were developed after Greyhawk for various other campaign settings, however, &quot;they would be subsumed under 5e&#x27;s umbrella concept of the multiverse&quot;.

=== Dark Sun cosmology ===
One of the hallmarks of the &quot;Dark Sun&quot; setting was Athas&#x27; cosmological isolation, something that broke with the rest of the canonical &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragon&quot;″s universe. Many of &quot;Dark Sun&quot;&#x27;s &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; contemporaries are accessible via planar travel or spelljamming, but Athas, with very few exceptions, is entirely cut off from the rest of the universe. While it retains its connections to the Inner Planes, access to the Transitive Planes and Outer Planes is nearly impossible. The reason for the cosmological isolation is never fully explained.

=== Eberron cosmology ===
The &quot;Eberron&quot; cosmology, used in the original &quot;Eberron&quot; campaign setting, contained thirteen Outer Planes in 3rd edition, and gained at least two for 4th edition under the new cosmology. They exhibit traits similar to those of the &quot;standard D&amp;D cosmology&quot; but also some (Irian, Mabar, Fernia, and Risia) appear more like Inner Planes. The cosmology was unique in that the Outer Planes orbited around Eberron through the Astral plane. As they orbited, their overlap with the material plane changed and access to those planes became easier or restricted.

=== Forgotten Realms cosmology ===

The &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; cosmology was originally the same as that of a standard &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign. The cosmology for the 3rd edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; was altered substantially so that it contained twenty-six Outer Planes, arranged in a tree-like structure around the central &#x27;trunk&#x27; of the material plane of Toril. Unlike the Outer Planes of the standard D&amp;D cosmology which were heavily alignment-based, the Outer Planes of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; cosmology were faith-based.

The planes of the Forgotten Realms were retooled in the 4th Edition to match the new default cosmology, with many of the planes or realms being relocated to the Astral Sea, and a handful now located in the Elemental Chaos. Appelcline highlighted that the 4th Edition World Axis model &quot;had actually originated with the Forgotten Realms, which was planning a view of the heavens as early as 2005 or 2006. It was then co-opted by the SCRAMJET world design team for D&amp;D 4e&quot;.

==Fictional planar travel==
Portals, conduits and gates are all openings leading from one location to another; some lead to locations in the same plane, others to different planes entirely. Although the three terms are often used interchangeably, there are notable distinctions:

* Portals are bounded by pre-existing openings (usually doors and arches); the portal is destroyed when the opening is. Portals also require portal keys to open; a key is usually a physical object, but it can also be an action or a state of being. Naturally occurring portals will often appear at random (a common occurrence in the city of Sigil, &quot;City of Doors&quot;, in the &quot;Planescape&quot; campaign setting); some portals only exist for a brief period of time, or shift from one location to another. 
* Conduits are also naturally occurring, but they are natural phenomena, the planar equivalent of whirlpools and tornadoes. Conduits are only known to occur in the Astral and Ethereal Planes. A type of conduit known as a color pool is a common gateway from the Astral Plane to the Outer Planes. A vortex is a link from a Prime Material world to the Inner Planes, which begin in areas of intense concentration of some element (e.g., the heart of a volcano might be a vortex to the Plane of Fire). There also used to be living vortices which the sorcerer-monarchs of Athas have managed to maintain, like syphoning water through a hose, and use to empower their &quot;priests,&quot; the Templars. 
* Gates are portals that are not bounded by physical apertures; gates are rare, and usually appear as a result of magical spells and rare planar phenomena. Lastly, planar bleeding occurs when regions of two planes coexist; such phenomena are usually short-lived, and disastrous for their environments.

=== Planar pathways ===
Planar pathways are special landscape features appearing in multiple planes or layers of a plane. Travel along a planar pathway results in travel along the planes. Pathways are crucial tactically, because they are very stable compared to portals or gates, and do not require magic spells or portal keys. One notable planar pathway in the &quot;Planescape&quot; campaign setting is the River Styx, which flows across the Lower Planes and parts of the Astral Plane. Another is the River Oceanus, which flows through the Upper Planes.

====River Oceanus====
The first edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; describes the River Oceanus as one of the features of the Outer Planes, which &quot;links the planes of Elysium, Happy Hunting Grounds, and Olympus in much the same way that the Styx links the lower planes&quot;. The river disappears and reappears a number of times in different layers of the planes, but it seems to follow a course that begins in Thalasia, the third layer of Elysium, flows through the second and first layers of that plane, then across the topmost layer of the Happy Hunting Grounds, then into the topmost layer of Olympus to its final rest in the second layer of that plane, Ossa. The Oceanus is a more natural river than the Styx, and no harm comes to those who drink of it. The Oceanus does still pose all the normal dangers of a large river, and does not have the supernatural boatmen of the Styx.

The book goes on to describe how Oceanus appears on specific Outer Planes. The first four layers of the plane of Elysium &quot;are dominated by the River Oceanus, which begins in the fourth (outermost) layer of this plane and flows down to the innermost layer (the layer nearest the Astral). From there Oceanus meanders into the Happy Hunting Grounds and then into the innermost layer of Olympus.&quot; These three good planes are linked by the Oceanus in the same manner as the lower planes are linked by the River Styx. By contrast, the Oceanus is a slow, peaceful flow, navigable by mere mortals (though its peaceful flow is often broken by rapids, cascades, waterfalls, and occasional fallen trees). The river separates and recombines many times in its passage, so travelers often find themselves journeying down side channels that soon rejoin the main stream. A traveler on the Oceanus can usually reach another layer by traveling downstream (or upstream, for the flow doubles back several times). The Egyptian goddess Isis holds sway over a large realm of the layer of Amoria, including several paths of the Oceanus. The god Seker and his moveable realm Ro Stau spend most of their times adjacent to Isis&#x27;s realm on the Oceanus. The Sumerian moon god Nanna-Sin travels the Oceanus in a great barque that is shaped like a crescent moon; in passing he provides a moon-like radiance to all on the banks of the river. Krigala is the first layer of the plane of the Happy Hunting Grounds, closest to the Astral, and through it the Oceanus flows in a relatively straight course (compared to its winding through Elysium) into Olympus. Ossa, the second layer of the plane of Olympus, is the outflow of the river Oceanus. There are often reports of huge, funnel-like maelstroms that lead directly back to Thalasia in an unending circle.

====River Styx====
The first edition &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; mentions that the River Styx &quot;links the topmost layers of the Lower Planes, and its branches can be found anywhere from the Nine Hells to the Abyss&quot;. The river is a deep, swift, and unfordable torrent. Creatures coming into contact with the waters of the Styx instantly forget their entire past lives. The safest passage is by the skiff of Charon, boatman of the Lower Planes. Charon may be summoned only on the banks of the Styx, and he will appear with a large black skiff, and if requested he will ferry travelers to the topmost layer of any Lower Plane for a price. The charonadaemons are the servants of Charon, and pilot small skiffs along the Styx. Charonadaemons are normally found anywhere on the Styx and charge travelers a price to pilot their craft through the Astral and Ethereal planes as well as the Lower Planes. The first edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; describes the River Styx as a means to travel from one Outer Plane to another, noting that &quot;it flows through many portals in the lower planes and provides a regularly-used highway through these planes.&quot; The River Styx reappears in sourcebooks such as the &quot;Planescape Campaign Setting&quot; (1994), &quot;Planes of Chaos&quot; (1994), &quot;Planes of Law&quot; (1995), and the 3rd Edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (2001).

====Yggdrasil====
The first edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; describes Yggdrasil as an astral landmark, noting that it is normally encountered by travelers from worlds that worship the Norse mythoi, but travelers from other Prime Material worlds can encounter the tree. It is a long-standing conduit from the Outer Planes to alternate prime worlds that was created by a group of deities and worshippers in the Prime Material plane. Yggdrasil is the &quot;World Ash&quot; that links several outer planes to the Prime Material plane, in the Norse mythos. It runs from Gladsheim, home of most of the Norse mythos, to Nifflheim, the center layer of the three Glooms of Hades and the dwelling place of the goddess of the same name. Roots and branches of Yggdrasil wind through most of the Prime worlds where these deities are recognized. The tree is a solid and permanent conduit that weathers the waxing and waning of faiths in the Prime Material and the fortunes of gods in the outer planes. The traveler is confronted with a huge tree rising from the mist of the Astral and disappearing far into the distance. The traveler can then climb the tree to the appropriate outer plane, descend to the reachable lower planes, or explore the alternate Prime worlds that the conduits touch upon. At the true terminus, the tree ends in a color pool similar to that of a fixed portal. The traveler can then pass into the outer plane as if moving into an alternate Prime Material or the Astral plane. Yggdrasil and Mount Olympus are the best-known of the permanent conduits that link the outer planes with the Prime and with other nonlinear outer planes. Magical interplanar portals generally only appear in the top layer of the outer planes, although some free-standing portals that pass through the Astral, like the Yggdrasil, pierce the lower reaches of some planes. The apertures that the Yggdrasil causes in the Prime worlds are fixed and limited to those places where the Norse gods are known.

<doc id="896898" wikidata="Q7033306" url="?curid=896898" title="Night Force">
<text>Night Force is the name of three comic book series published by American company DC Comics. The first series, written by Marv Wolfman and illustrated by Gene Colan, debuted in a special insert in &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; #21 (July 1982). The second series began in 1996 was one of four books that made up DC&#x27;s Weirdoverse group of titles. The third series began in 2012 as a seven-issue miniseries. It was again written by Marv Wolfman, this time with artist Tom Mandrake.

The main character of all three series is Baron Winters, a sorcerer who would assemble a team of chosen individuals to fight supernatural threats. The Baron himself did not participate in the missions and would manipulate, sometimes unethically, others to do so for him. This was because, for reasons not revealed, he could not leave Wintersgate Manor, the labyrinthine mansion in Washington, D.C., where he lived. The mansion was located in a special juncture of time and space, allowing him to send his team to different places and times.

==Publication history==
The first &quot;Night Force&quot; series was launched in August 1982 in the midst of a collapse in the horror comics market, with most titles in the genre being either cancelled or on the verge of cancellation. Despite this, writer Marv Wolfman felt (and publisher DC Comics agreed) that &quot;Night Force&quot; could be a success: 

&quot;Night Force&quot; was the first collaboration between Wolfman and &quot;Tomb of Dracula&quot; penciler Gene Colan since Wolfman convinced him to join the staff at DC. Both Wolfman and Colan did extensive creative design work for &quot;Night Force&quot; before working on the actual issues, with Wolfman charting out the characters&#x27; astrology and Colan doing multiple drafts of each character&#x27;s visual design.

After only 14 issues, &quot;Night Force&quot; was cancelled due to an underestimating of the series&#x27;s sales. Wolfman explained, &quot;... DC wanted to have &quot;Night Force&quot; be one of the first direct-sales books, where I believed it should be newsstand only. I felt the comic shops appealed primarily to the superhero fans while &quot;Night Force&quot; would appeal more to the casual mainstream reader, who might not have bought comics otherwise. We got the comic-book shops&#x27; sales early and it was canceled based on those, but when the newsstand sales finally dribbled in we actually sold pretty well&quot;.

Thirteen years later, &quot;Night Force&quot; was revived as part of the Weirdoverse line. The creative team included Wolfman but not Colan, and did not carry over the plot threads from the original series.

==Characters==
The team had a rotating membership, but notable members included:
* Vanessa Van Helsing – granddaughter of Abraham Van Helsing and a powerful psychic.
* Jack Gold – Vanessa&#x27;s husband, a reporter.
* Donovan Caine – a professor of parapsychology who lost an arm and a leg on one of the missions.
* Zadok Grimm – apparently, an ancient warrior in the time of King David. He has an unexplained connection to Baron Winters.

==Other versions==
In issue three of the &quot;Tangent: Superman&#x27;s Reign&quot; series, a version of Night Force is featured. This group is a mystically-powered branch of the Nightwing organization, and its members are Hex, Black Orchid, and Wildcat.

==In other media==
* The character of Jasper Winters, mentioned in several episodes of &quot;Constantine&quot;, was loosely based on Baron Winters, although the look is modernized.

<doc id="896909" wikidata="Q6926039" url="?curid=896909" title="Mouse Trap (board game)">
<text>Mouse Trap (originally Mouse Trap Game) is a board game first published by Ideal in 1963 for two to four players. It is one of the first mass-produced three-dimensional board games. Players at first cooperate to build a working mouse trap in the style of a Rube Goldberg machine. Then, players turn against each other to trap opponents&#x27; mouse-shaped game pieces.

== Gameplay ==
=== Original version ===
The basic premise of &quot;Mouse Trap&quot; has been consistent over time, but the turn-based gameplay has changed. Its concept was first invented by Marvin Glass and designer Gordon Barlow from Marvin&#x27;s company, Marvin Glass and Associates, who were later granted a US patent in 1967. The original published version of the game in 1963 was then designed by Hank Kramer of Ideal Toy Company, filling in the details Glass had left open, and allows the players almost no decision-making, in keeping with other games for very young children such as &quot;Candyland&quot; or &quot;Chutes and Ladders&quot; (&quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot;). Players take turns rolling a die to advance their mouse piece along a path around the game board, from the start space to a continuous loop at the end. The Rube Goldberg-like mouse trap is assembled in the center of the board, with players adding one or more of its pieces when they land on specified &quot;build&quot; spaces. The trap is always assembled in a specified order, and is attached to the board by inserting tabs into holes and locking them into place.

Along the ending loop are additional &quot;build&quot; spaces (in case the trap is still not completed), a &quot;cheese pizza&quot; space positioned directly underneath the trap&#x27;s cage, and a &quot;turn crank&quot; space. If a player lands on the &quot;turn crank&quot; space when an opponent is on the cheese pizza space, the crank can be turned on the machine to launch it; if the machine works properly and the cage falls on the cheese pizza space, that opponent is eliminated from the game. The winner is then the last one remaining after all the other players are captured.

The mouse-trapping mechanism works as follows: One player turns a crank, turning two gears and pushing on a lever. The lever whacks a stop sign into a shoe, which kicks a small bucket holding a large ball bearing. The ball bearing rolls down some crooked stairs and into a rain gutter, and then follows the gutter to bump into the bottom of a vertical rod. The top of the rod has a &quot;helping hand&quot; that bumps another ball bearing, making it fall through a &quot;thing-a-ma-jig&quot; and into a bathtub, then out of the bathtub and onto a diving board. This catapults a diver on an arc up and into a washtub, knocking loose a cage suspended from the top of a bumpy rod. The cage rattles down the rod and onto another player&#x27;s mouse, trapping it.

=== Revised versions ===
In 1975, the board game surrounding the trap was redesigned by Sid Sackson, adding the cheese pizza pieces and allowing the player to maneuver opponents onto the trap space. Players collect cheese-shaped tokens during the game, and if the trap space is vacant when they land on the &quot;turn crank&quot; space, the tokens can be redeemed for a die roll to move an opponent.

A modified version was released in the United Kingdom in 2004, featuring three mousetraps (with a specialized trigger working at random) and a completely different board and plastic components. Among the changed trap components in this version is the inclusion of a model toilet (which serves as the random trigger) instead of a model bathtub.

A version of the game featuring characters from the &quot;Elefun and Friends&quot; universe was introduced in 2014. Among the changes in this version, the trap is built before the start of the game, a spin wheel is used instead of dice, and the cheese pizza pieces and their relevant rules are not included. Also, there are three mice named Sneakers, Nacho and Pepper.

Also in the 2010s, Hasbro introduced &quot;Classic Mousetrap&quot; with several major changes from the previous versions. The object in this game is to collect six cheese pizza pieces. Instead of being eliminated from the game when caught by the trap, a player only forfeits cheese pizza pieces to the opponent. The trap machine was modified, such as with the elimination of crank gears in favor of launching the trap by directly pulling the lever with the plastic stop sign.

==Similar games==
Game designer Marvin Glass (and his company, Marvin Glass and Associates) acknowledged that &quot;Mouse Trap&quot; had obviously been greatly influenced by Rube Goldberg&#x27;s illustrations, though they refused to pay licensing or royalty fees. Glass later developed two lesser-known games based on Goldberg designs, Crazy Clock Game (&quot;Crazy Clock&quot;) (1964) and Fish Bait Game (&quot;Fish Bait&quot;) (1965), neither of which credit Goldberg&#x27;s influence. Elderly and near retirement, Goldberg declined to take legal action against Glass, primarily because inspiration and ideas are not intellectual property that can be protected with a copyright, trademark, or patent. He instead chose to sell licensing rights for his drawings to another toy company, Model Products, to help secure the rights to specific intellectual property that he could own and receive royalties from.

In &quot;Crazy Clock Game&quot;, players race to build a Rube Goldberg machine. The game comes with a pack of cards, each illustrating how one piece of the machine fits in. The deck is dealt out to the players. The player starts with the first card, card 1; players then play as many cards (install as many machine components) as they can, then pass to the next player. After fully assembling, they take turns trying to operate the machine, starting with the player who installed the last component; the winner is the one who first succeeds.

&quot;Fish Bait Game&quot; is simpler than &quot;Mouse Trap&quot;. Players play as fishermen and build a contraption to catch a man-eating fish. Each time a player lands on an empty white space, the player must build a part of the contraption. Other spaces can either give the player an extra turn, take a turn, or go back a space. The game keeps going until the contraption is fully built and a player lands on the &quot;FISH BAIT&quot; space, when the player must take their piece on the plastic dock and hook the rubber band inside of the fish&#x27;s mouth around the legs. Players keep moving until someone lands on the &quot;CATCH FISH&quot; space and starts the contraption to catch the other player&#x27;s piece. Once caught, the player is out of the game (although if the trap fails, the one getting caught and the one catching the fish have to switch places until there is a successful catch) and the game continues; the winner is the last one standing.

==Legacy==
In the 1990s, &quot;Mouse Trap&quot; was adapted into a game show within the British children&#x27;s television show &quot;Motormouth&quot;. Child contestants take the place of the mice in a life-size board game.

&quot;Mouse Trap&quot; has been lampooned by Mark Perez of San Francisco in the form of a giant traveling spectacle called Life Size &quot;Mouse Trap&quot;. KRON4 described it at Maker Faire of 2014 as &quot;a fantastically hand crafted, 16 piece, 50,000-lb. interactive kinetic sculpture set atop a 6,500-square-foot game board ... complete with a Vaudevillian style show, original musical score by the one woman band Esmerelda Strange, Sexy Mice can-can dancers, clown workers, acrobatic hijinks, and other spectacular scenes dedicated to the pursuit of spectacle-laden fun!&quot; It is hauled to fairs and events by 25 tons of cranes and equipment in a semi truck, it has a bowling ball instead of a ball bearing, and it ends in the destruction of a real automobile. &quot;The Mercury News&quot; said in 2016 &quot;instead of trapping a rodent — they drop a huge old bank safe on a car. Sweet. ... It&#x27;s all very awesome, a masterpiece of engineering. But kind of a bummer you can&#x27;t actually play on it — as the ball.&quot; &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot; reported the exhibit&#x27;s merit in teaching physics and simple machines.

<text>Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s War on Journalism is a 2004 documentary film by filmmaker Robert Greenwald about Fox News Channel&#x27;s and its owner&#x27;s, Rupert Murdoch, promotion of conservative views. The film says this bias belies the channel&#x27;s motto of being &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot;.

The documentary had a limited theatrical release, was distributed in DVD format by the political action committee MoveOn.org, and was sold online through Internet retailers such as Amazon.com. MoveOn.org had helped promote the DVD release by taking out a full-page advertisement in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Following the release of &quot;Outfoxed&quot;, Greenwald and Brave New Films produced a related series of anti-Fox viral videos, collectively entitled &quot;Fox Attacks&quot;. In an interview, Greenwald stated his goal in making the film: &quot;What we set out to do was to show that, in fact, the entire Fox News was not a news organization. The goal was not just to change that narrative but to change the impact that Fox News often had on legitimate journalists.&quot; Fox News criticized the film, saying that it constituted &quot;illegal copyright infringement&quot; for using clips of its shows and said that the film misrepresented the employment of four people identified as former Fox News employees.

==Synopsis==
The film examines the global growth of Murdoch&#x27;s media enterprise in the context of concentration of media ownership considerations, and evaluates the effect of having one person in control of a large media conglomerate on freedom of the press.

Some of &quot;Outfoxed&quot;″s coverage includes:
* Review of Fox News&#x27;s coverage during the lead-up to, and the aftermath of, the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
* Interviews with former Fox News journalists, discussing incidents where Fox News allegedly pressured journalists to slant their reports towards support for the Republican Party.
* Instances where Fox News commentators such as Bill O&#x27;Reilly intimidate guests with whom they disagree, such as author and activist Jeremy Glick.
* Studies which claim more airtime and coverage is consistently given to Republican politicians, particularly those in the George W. Bush administration, than to Democrats.
* Examination of whether Fox News&#x27; premature result-calling of the 2000 presidential election contributed to George W. Bush officially being elected.
* Scrutiny of Fox News management, including Murdoch and president Roger Ailes, both conservatives, in allegedly controlling the network&#x27;s content, and editorial control from Murdoch on down allegedly ensuring which stories and issues are covered and the strongly conservative perspective of such coverage.

Former Fox News journalists appear in the film critiquing the methods and perceived integrity of their former employer. Jon Du Pre, a former reporter for Fox News&#x27;s West Coast bureau, said that he had been suspended by Fox News management because his live shots from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Ronald Reagan&#x27;s birthday — which Du Pre described was like a &quot;holy day&quot; to Fox News&#x27;s hierarchy — were not &quot;celebratory enough.&quot; A former Fox News military contributor, Larry C. Johnson, said that he was in high demand to give on-air analysis on the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;, until he called into question on &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot; whether or not the United States could fight two wars (in Afghanistan and Iraq) simultaneously, an incident after which Johnson says he was ignored as a potential Fox News contributor.

==Participants==
* Eric Alterman
* David Brock
* Richard A. Clarke
* Jeff Cohen
* Walter Cronkite
* Al Franken
* John Nichols
* Bernie Sanders

==Reception==
&quot;Outfoxed&quot; received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 85% based on reviews from 60 critics.

Variety reviewer David Rooney wrote that the film &quot;provides stimulating evidence of how thoroughly news can be skewed, political agendas served and a climate of fear created by a news net selling itself as an objective information service.&quot; He compares it favorably to Michael Moore&#x27;s documentary &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, adding that without the &quot;media spotlight&quot; that surrounded Moore&#x27;s film, &quot;Outfoxed&quot; &quot;appears unlikely to reach beyond a liberal audience with an already vehement aversion to Fox News&#x27; partisan coverage.&quot;

Howard Kurtz of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised Greenwald&#x27;s uncovering of &quot;...a handful of memos from a top Fox executive&quot;, which he argued suggested network bias over the war in Iraq and the investigation of the September 11 attacks. Kurtz was critical of how Greenwald&#x27;s allegations relied on &quot;orders, or attitudes, of an unnamed &#x27;they&#x27;...&quot;, and was critical of the filmmaker for making &quot;...no effort at fairness or balance himself.&quot;

In the &quot;New York Post&quot;, a newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation, Megan Lehmann called the film a &quot;narrowly focused, unapologetically partisan documentary&quot; that &quot;is so one-sided, it undermines its own integrity.&quot;

==Fox News&#x27; response==
Fox News called the film &quot;illegal copyright infringement&quot; for its use of clips from Fox News Channel programs.

Fox News also said that the film misrepresented the employment of four people identified as former Fox News employees. Fox News said Alexander Kippen and Frank O&#x27;Donnell had actually been employees of WTTG, the Fox owned-and-operated station in Washington, D.C., and not employees of Fox News Channel. It said that Jon Du Pre, identified as a former anchor in the film, had actually been a reporter, and that his contract had not been renewed because he was &quot;a weak field correspondent and could not do live shots.&quot; It said that Clara Frenk, identified as a former producer in the film, had actually been a &quot;pool booker&quot; who &quot;expressed no concern about the editorial process&quot; while employed there. Fox also pointed out that Frenk had been a volunteer for Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1992 Presidential campaign.

Fox News challenged any news organization that thought this was a major story to &quot;put out 100 percent of their editorial directions and internal memos [and] Fox News Channel will publish 100 percent of our editorial directions and internal memos, and let the public decide who is fair.&quot;

<doc id="896929" wikidata="Q5661976" url="?curid=896929" title="Harold Parker (sculptor)">
<text>Harold Parker (27 August 1873 – 23 April 1962) was a British-born sculptor, raised in Queensland, Australia, and subsequently worked in the United Kingdom.

== Early life ==
Harold Parker was born in 1873 in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England. His family moved to Brisbane, Australia in 1876.

== Artistic career ==
He studied at the Brisbane Technical College under John A Clarke and Godfrey Rivers, then in 1896 left for London where he studied under William Silver Frith, then worked as assistant to Thomas Brock, Hamo Thornycroft and Goscombe John.

He rented a studio near that of fellow sculptor John Tweed, and from 1903 to 1929 regularly exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, and occasionally at the Old Salon, Paris. He was commissioned to portray Queensland expatriates and became a rival of Bertram Mackennal. In 1906 he was elected a member of the Royal Society of British Sculptors. The triumph of his career came in 1908 when for £1000 the Chantrey Bequest purchased his &#x27;Ariadne&#x27; for the Tate Gallery. In 1910 his &#x27;Prometheus Bound&#x27; received a &#x27;mention&#x27; at the Salon.

In March 1911, at St James&#x27; Church Sussex Gardens in Paddington, London, he was married to Janet Robinson, the daughter of Major Sir Thomas B. Robinson, then the Agent-General for Queensland in London.
In 1911 the newly married Harold Parker visited Brisbane and was received enthusiastically, but apart from his &quot;First Breath of Spring&quot; to the Queensland National Art Gallery, sold none of his work. Back in London he received a major commission, two groups of figures outside Australia House: &quot;The Prosperity of Australia&quot; and &quot;The Awakening of Australia&quot;.

In 1929, his work was being shown at Paris Salon, the Royal Academy, and the Royal Scottish Academy.

In 1930, he and his wife settled in Brisbane where, overlooked for major commissions, he withdrew from public life, virtually abandoning sculpture for painting. He did, however, submit a number of designs for the reverses of the proposed coinage of Edward VIII in 1936. His image of a wren was selected for the farthing, where it remained for the rest of the coin&#x27;s existence, becoming a firm and recognised favourite in Britain.

In 1937, Parker became a foundation member of, and exhibited with, Robert Menzies&#x27; anti-modernist organisation, the Australian Academy of Art.

In 1993, a retrospective of his work entitled &quot;Harold Parker, Sculptor&quot;, was held at the Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane. Artworks by Harold Parker are held at the Queensland Art Gallery.

== Later life ==
Parker died in Brisbane on 23 April 1962. He was buried in South Brisbane Cemetery.

== Legacy ==
A circa 1907 portrait of Parker by James Peter Quinn hangs in the National Library of Australia.

His personal papers, sketchbooks, photographs and other items are held by the Fryer Library at the University of Queensland.

<text>The term programming domain is mostly used when referring to domain-specific programming languages. It refers to a set of programming languages or programming environments that were written specifically for a particular domain, where &quot;domain&quot; means a broad subject for end users such as accounting or finance, or a category of program usage such as artificial intelligence or email. Languages and systems within a single programming domain would have functions common to the domain and may omit functions that are irrelevant to a domain.

Some examples of programming domains are:

*Expert systems, computer systems that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert and are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge.
*Natural-language processing, handling interactions between computers and human (natural) languages such as speech recognition, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation. 
*Computer vision, dealing with how computers can understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do and extracting data from the real world.

Other programming domains would include:
*Application scripting
*Array programming
*Artificial-intelligence reasoning
*Cloud computing
*Computational statistics
*Contact Management Software
*E-commerce
*Financial time-series analysis
*General-purpose applications
*Image processing
*Internet
*Numerical mathematics
*Programming education
*Relational database querying
*Software prototyping
*Symbolic mathematics
*Systems design and implementation
*Text processing
*Theorem proving
*Video game programming and development

<text>The Jeep CJ models are a series and a range of small, open-bodied off-road vehicles and compact pickup trucks, built and sold by several successive incarnations of the Jeep automobile marque from 1945 through 1986. The 1945 Willys &quot;Universal Jeep&quot; was the world&#x27;s first mass-produced civilian four-wheel drive car.

In 1944, Willys-Overland, the primary manufacturer of the World War II military Jeep, built the first prototypes for a commercial version – the CJ, short for &quot;civilian Jeep&quot;. The design was a direct evolution from the war jeep, but the most obvious change was adding a tailgate, and relocating the spare wheel to the side. Also, besides adding basic civilian amenities and options and legally-compliant lighting, the CJ required a sturdier drivetrain than the war jeep, because the targeted rural buyers would work the vehicles hard and expect years of durability, instead of mere weeks as during WWII.

From then on, all CJ Jeeps consistently had a separate body and frame, rigid live axles with leaf springs both front and rear, a tapering nose design with flared fenders, and a fold-flat windshield, and could be driven without doors. Also, with few exceptions, they had part-time four-wheel drive systems, with the choice of high and low gearing, and open bodies with removable hard or soft tops. A few stand-out changes during 42 model years were the introductions of round-fendered vs. flat-fendered bodies (1955 CJ-5), straight-6 and V8-engines, automatic gearboxes, and different 4-wheel drive systems. The 1976 CJ-7 stretched the wheelbase by 10 inches (25 cm), and made &quot;doors&quot; and a removable hardtop common items.

After remaining in production through a range of model numbers, and several corporate parents, the Jeep CJ line was officially ended after 1986. More than 1.5 million CJ Jeeps were built, having continued the same basic body style for 45 years since the Jeep first appeared. Widely regarded as &quot;America&#x27;s workhorse&quot;, the CJs have been described as &quot;probably the most successful utility vehicle ever made.&quot; American Motors VP Joseph E. Cappy said the end of &quot;CJ production will signal an end of a very important era in Jeep history.&quot; In 1987, the Jeep CJ-7 was replaced by the first-generation Jeep Wrangler. Looking very similar and riding on the same wheelbase as the CJ-7, it carried over some important components, including its use of leaf springs.

The similar model the DJ &quot;Dispatcher&quot; was introduced in 1956 as a two-wheel drive version with open, fabric, or a closed steel body in both left- and right-hand drives for hotel, resort, police, and later United States Postal Service markets.

==CJ-1==
In 1942, the US Department of Agriculture tested the MB. By 1944, the Allies were confident the war would be won, and wartime production looked to be winding down. This allowed Willys to consider designing a Jeep for the postwar civilian market. Documentation is scarce, but in early 1944, Willys seemed to have found time to start drawing up plans, and one or two prototypes dubbed CJ(-1), for &quot;Civilian Jeep&quot;, were running by May of that year. The first CJs had apparently been created by quick modification of the regular military MB, adding a tailgate, lower gearing, a drawbar, and a civilian-style canvas top. The first CJ served as a quick proof-of-concept test, and when a further design evolution materialized, probably became the CJ-1 by default. They were manufactured until the CJ-2s appeared, and they were the first Jeeps built from the ground up for civilian use.

No CJ-1s built have survived, and how many were made is unknown.

==CJ-2==
Although at least 40 were built, the Willys-Overland CJ-2 was not available for retail sale. The CJ-2s, also known as &quot;AgriJeeps&quot;, were the second-generation prototypes for the first production civilian Jeep, and were used solely for testing purposes. Although their design was directly based on the military Willys MB, using the same Willys Go Devil engine — they were not only stripped of all military features, particularly the blackout lighting, but also the CJ-2s had many significant differences in body features and construction versus the military Jeep. They had tailgates, power take-offs, engine governors ($28.65), column-shift T90 manual transmissions, 5.38 gears, 2.43:1 low-range transfer cases, and driver&#x27;s-side tool indentations. Rear wheelwells were redesigned so that seats could be enlarged, improved, and moved rearward, and new, more weathertight top designs were tried. A canvas half-top with roll-down doors was one of several top designs tried before production. The CJ-2 Go-Devil L-head engine was largely the same as the wartime Jeep, but used a different carburetor and ignition system.

 Later models were stamped &quot;JEEP&quot; and were painted in a few civilian colors that translated into the &quot;WILLYS&quot; stamping and the colors that appeared on the first production CJ-2A Jeeps built from 1945. The spare tire was mounted forward of the passenger-side rear wheel on the earlier models and aft of the rear wheel on later ones. The CJ-2s were likely distributed to &quot;agricultural stations&quot; for evaluation purposes.

Of the 40–45 CJ-2s built, serial numbers CJ2-03, CJ2-04, CJ2-06 (X30), CJ2-09 (X33), CJ2-11, CJ2-12, CJ2-14, CJ2-16, CJ2-26, CJ2-29, CJ2-32 (X56), CJ2-37 (X61), and CJ2-38 (X62) have survived, although some in very rough condition. CJ2-06 and CJ2-09 have been restored.

==CJ-2A==


The lessons learned with the CJ-2 led to the development of the first full-production CJ, the 1945-1949 Willys-Overland CJ-2A, or Universal Jeep. A trademark for &quot;AGRIJEEP&quot; was granted in December 1944, but was not used. The CJ-2A looked very much like a civilianized MB with a tailgate and side-mounted spare wheel. A distinct difference between the MB and the CJ-2A lay in the grilles of the two vehicles. Where the MB had recessed headlights and nine-slot grilles, the CJ-2A had larger, slightly bulging headlights, flush-mounted in a seven-slot grille. While still powered by the reliable L-134 Go-Devil engine, the CJ-2A replaced the MB&#x27;s T-84 transmission with a beefier T-90 three-speed.

Production of the CJ-2A started on 17 July 1945, sharing production time with the MB – roughly 9000 more MBs were produced through September 1945. Many of the early CJ-2As were produced using remaining stock of the military jeep components such as engine blocks, and in a few cases, modified frames. Up to serial no. 13453, the MB-style full floating rear axle was fitted. Once they were used up, the CJ got a stronger Dana / Spicer model 41. Sometimes the use of MB parts was due to strikes at suppliers, such as Autolite. Since Willys produced few parts in-house and relied heavily on suppliers, it was vulnerable to strikes. Unfortunately for Willys, strikes were common after the war, and this likely contributed to low production totals in 1945 and early 1946.

Since the CJ-2A was primarily intended for farming, ranching, and industrial applications, stock CJ-2As only came with a driver seat and driver side mirror, and a wide variety of options was available, such as: front passenger seat, rear seat, center rear-view mirror, canvas top, front power take-off (PTO), rear PTO, belt pulley drive, capstan winch, governor, rear hydraulic lift, snow plow, welder, generator, mower, disc, front bumper weight, heavy-duty springs, dual vacuum windshield wipers (stock CJ-2As were equipped with a manual wiper on the passenger side and a vacuum wiper on the driver side), dual taillights (stock CJ-2As had a taillight on the driver side and a reflector on the passenger side), hot-climate radiator, driveshaft guards, heater, side steps, and radiator brush guard.

The CJ-2As were produced in lively color combinations that in some ways symbolized the hope and promise of postwar America. True to their intended purpose, the combinations also resembled those used by the most popular farm equipment manufacturers of the day. From 1945 to mid-1946, CJ-2As were only available in two color combinations: Pasture Green with Autumn Yellow wheels and Harvest Tan with Sunset Red wheels. Additional color combinations added in mid-1946 were: Princeton Black with Harvard Red or Sunset Red wheels, Michigan Yellow with Pasture Green, Sunset Red or Americar Black wheels, Normandy Blue with Autumn Yellow or Sunset Red wheels, and Harvard Red with Autumn Yellow or Americar Black wheels. The Pasture Green and Harvest Tan combinations were dropped later in 1946. The Harvard Red combinations were dropped in 1947 and replaced with Picket Gray with Harvard Red wheels, and Luzon Red with Universal Beige wheels. In 1948, these color combinations were also added: Emerald Green with Universal Beige wheels, Potomac Gray with Harvard Red or American Black wheels. For 1949, the Picket Gray, Michigan Yellow, and Normandy Blue combinations were dropped. Olive drab was also available for export models.

On early CJ-2As, the front seats were covered in olive-drab vinyl. Around mid-1947, Slate Gray vinyl became available for certain color combinations. Later, Barcelona Red was added to the mix.

A total of 214,760 CJ-2As were produced. Because of the use of military production parts on the earliest CJ-2As, and the many changes made during its early production, restorers and collectors refer to CJ-2As up to around serial no. 34,530 as &quot;Very Early Civilian&quot; and from mid-1946 to about mid-1947 as &quot;Early Civilian&quot;. Only minor changes were made after the mid-1947 models.

==CJ-3A==

The Willys-Overland CJ-3A was introduced in 1949, and was in production until 1953, when replaced by the CJ-3B. It was powered by Willys&#x27; L-134 Go-Devil four-cylinder engine, with a T-90 transmission and Dana 18 transfer case, a Dana 25 front axle and Dana 41 or 44 rear axle. It featured a one-piece windshield with a vent, and wipers at the bottom. The CJ-3A had beefed-up suspension (10 leaf) to accommodate the various agricultural implements that were being built for the vehicle. Another difference was a shorter rear wheelwell (the wheelwell from the top front edge to the rear of the body is on the 3A compared to on the 2A) and moving the driver&#x27;s seat rearward. As of 1951, a Farm Jeep and a Jeep Tractor version were offered; the latter was very bare-bones, for field use only, and featured a power takeoff.
In total, 131,843 CJ-3As were produced before the series ended in 1953. About 550 of the CJ3-As were assembled by Mitsubishi as the J1/J2 in late 1952 and early 1953, exclusively for the Japanese police and forestry agency.
The CJ-3A-derived military jeep was the Willys MC (or M38), and it began complementing the Ford and Willys World War II jeeps starting in 1949.

The CJ-3A, along with the later CJ-3B and CJ-5 models, was used as a platform for early Zamboni ice resurfacers produced from 1950 until 1964, which were mounted on top of the Jeeps to clean and smooth the surface of ice rinks. Zamboni resurfacers would be constructed using original chassis designs starting in 1964, eliminating the need to source Jeep parts.

==CJ-4==

The Willys-Overland CJ-4 or &quot;X-151&quot; was only built as an experimental concept in 1950 or 1951. It used the new Willys Hurricane engine and had an wheelbase. The CJ-4 body tub was an intermediate design between the straightforward raised hood from the CJ-3B and the all new curved body style of the CJ-5. The design was rejected and the vehicle was eventually sold to a factory employee.

Evidence has surfaced, that derived prototypes called CJ-4M and CJ-4MA (XM170) have also been seriously considered, as precursors to the 1951 M38A1 and M170 military Jeeps. Although the CJ-4M prototype may not have been actually built, the stretched wheelbase ambulance prototype with registration &quot;CJ-4MA-01&quot; turned up in 2005.
==CJ-3B==

The Willys CJ-3B replaced the CJ-3A in 1953, the same year Willys-Overland was bought by Kaiser Motors. The Kaiser parent company removed &quot;Overland&quot; from the Willys Motors subcompany name. The CJ-3B introduced a higher grille and hood to clear the new Willys Hurricane engine. A four-speed manual transmission became optional in 1963, at an extra cost of $194 (~$ in ). The turning radius was . Until 1968, about 196,000 CJ-3Bs were produced, of which 155,494 were assembled in the U.S.

The CJ-3B was turned into the M606 military jeep (mostly used for export, through 1968) by equipping it with commercially available heavy-duty options, such as larger tires and springs, and by adding black-out lighting, olive drab paint, and a trailer hitch. Shipments of the M606 militarized version of the Jeep CJ-3B, exported for military aid under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program, accounted for a substantial percentage of the limited CJ-3B production in the 1960s.

===International licenses and derivatives===

The CJ-3B design was also licensed to a number of international manufacturers, which produced a civilian and military variants long after 1968, including Mitsubishi of Japan and Mahindra of India. Mitsubishi&#x27;s version was built from 1953 until 1998, while Mahindra continued to produce vehicles based on the Willys CJ-3B until October 1, 2010. The CJ-3B was also built by Türk Willys Overland in Tuzla county of Kocaeli city. It was the first off-road vehicle plant to be opened in Turkey, in 1954. It was produced under &quot;Tuzla 1013&quot; brand. Mahindra&#x27;s &quot;Mahindra CJ&quot; produced in two versions: four-seater CJ 340 and six-seater CJ 540. Both were equipped with Peugeot-sourced engines.


===Mitsubishi Jeep===
The Jeep was introduced to the Japanese market as the Jeep J3 in July 1953 after Willys agreed to allow Mitsubishi to market the car, competing with the Nissan Patrol and the Toyota Land Cruiser. The name wasn&#x27;t in reference to &quot;CJ3&quot;, but rather denoted the fact that 53 &quot;J1&quot;s (CJ-3A with 6-volt electrics) had been built for the Japanese regional forest office and around 500 &quot;J2&quot;s (CJ-3A with 12-volt electrics) were built for the National Safety Forces. Mitsubishi continued knock-down production of vehicles derived from the CJ-3B design until August 1998, when tighter emissions and safety standards finally made the Jeep obsolete. In total, about 200,000 units were built in this 45-year period. Short, medium, and long wheelbases were available, as well as a variety of bodystyles, and gasoline and diesel engines. In Japan, it was sold at a specific retail chain called Galant Shop. The Japanese GSDF refers to them as Type 73 light truck.
The original J3 was a basic, doorless, and roofless version, with steering on the left, rather than the right, despite Japan having left-side traffic. The first right-hand drive versions did not appear until nearly eight years later (J3R/J11R). The original J3 and its derivatives were equipped with the F-head &quot;Hurricane&quot; (called JH4 by Mitsubishi, for Japanese Hurricane 4-cylinder) inline four-cylinder, originally producing at 4,000 rpm. In 1955 a slightly longer wheelbase J10 which could seat six was added, and in 1956 the J11 appeared, a two-door &quot;delivery wagon&quot; with a full metal body. This was considerably longer, at versus for the J3.

Local production of the JH4 engine commenced in 1955. A locally developed diesel version (KE31) was introduced for the JC3 in 1958, originally with at 3,500 rpm but with at 3,600 rpm a few years later. Later versions used 4DR5 and 4DR6 (J23 turbo) 2.7 liter overhead-valve diesel engines. The final military version J24A produced 135PS from an improved 4DR5 engine with front-mounted air-to-air intercooler.

By 1962, the output of the gasoline JH4 engine had crept up to . By the time of the introduction of the longer J20 in 1960, a six-seater like the J10, but with a differently configurated (more permanent) front windshield, as well as available metal doors, Mitsubishi had also added small diagonal skirts to the leading edge of the Jeep&#x27;s front fenders. This remained the last change to the sheetmetal up front until the end of Mitsubishi Jeep production in 1998.

Later models include 2-L, short-wheelbase, soft-top J58 (J54 with a diesel engine), and the J38 gasoline wagon on the longest wheelbase. The last iteration of the Japanese Jeeps was the J53 with diesel turbo engine.

==CJ-5==

The Willys CJ-5 (after 1964 Jeep CJ-5) was influenced by new corporate owner, Kaiser, and the Korean War M38A1 Jeep. It was intended to replace the CJ-3B, but that model continued in production. The CJ-5 repeated this pattern, continuing in production for three decades while three newer models appeared. &quot;The CJ-5 has the distinct honor of being a vehicle that was hard to kill off... equaling the longest production run of note.&quot;
From 1961 until 1965, optional for the CJ-5 and CJ-6 was the British-made Perkins Diesel I4 with at 3,000 rpm and at 1350 rpm.

In 1965, Kaiser bought license to produce the Buick V6 Dauntless engine, to offer the new option on the CJ-5 and CJ-6, countering complaints that the 75 hp four-cylinder Willys Hurricane engine was underpowered. Power steering was an $81 option. The V6 engine proved so popular, by 1968, some 75% of CJ-5s were sold with it.
Kaiser Jeep was sold to American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1970, and the Buick engine was retired after the 1971 model year. (GM&#x27;s Buick division repurchased the engine tooling in the early 1970s which served as the powerplant in several GM vehicles.) The &quot;Trac-Lok&quot; limited-slip differential replaced the &quot;Powr-Lok&quot; in 1971, and PTOs were no longer available after that year. AMC began marketing the Jeep less as a universal utility vehicle, and more as a sporty one, notably increasing its performance and features.

1972 Revamp&lt;br&gt;
The 1972 model year brought significant changes to the CJ-5. American Motors began fitting their own engines, which also required changes to both body and chassis. The base Willys 4-cylinder was replaced by AMC&#x27;s Torque Command straight-6 engines, giving the entry-level CJ-5 the power of the previously optional Buick V6. Standard became the , and optional the , which was standard in California. Both engines used a one-barrel Carter YF carburetor. Also in 1972, AMC&#x27;s V8 engine became available, which upgraded the power-to-weight ratio to a level comparable to a V8 muscle-car. Other drive-train changes included a new front axle - a full-floating, open-knuckle Dana 30, which was both 25 lbs lighter and reduced the turning circle by 6 ft.

To accommodate the new engines, the wheelbase was stretched by , and the fenders and hood were stretched by . A new box-frame was fitted, featuring six cross-members for more rigidity. Also, a larger fuel tank was mounted, moved from under the driver&#x27;s seat to under the rear, between the frame rails.

A dealer-installed radio became available in 1973, air conditioning became available via dealership in 1975. Electronic, breakerless distributors replaced breaker-point Delco distributors for the full engine line-up, and a catalytic converter was added to models equipped with the 304 V8.

In 1975, for the 1976 model year, the tub and frame were modified from earlier versions. The frame went from a partially open channel/boxed frame with riveted crossmembers, to majoritively boxed with welded crossmembers, and from parallel rails to widening fore to aft to benefit stability. and the body tub became more rounded. The windshield frame and windshield angle were also changed, meaning that tops for the 1955 through 1975 model years are different from the 1976 through 1983 CJ-5 versions. The rear axle was also changed in 1976 from a Dana 44 to an AMC-manufactured model 20 that had a larger-diameter ring gear, but used a two-piece axleshaft/hub assembly instead of the one-piece design used in the Dana.

For 1977, the frame was modified again to a completely boxed unit. Power disc brakes and the &quot;Golden Eagle&quot; package (which included a tachometer and clock) were new options, as well as air conditioning.

In 1979, the standard engine became the I6 that now featured a Carter BBD two-barrel carburetor.

From 1980 through 1983, the CJ-5 came standard with a &quot;Hurricane&quot;-branded version of the GM Iron Duke I4 with an SR4 close-ratio, four-speed manual transmission. The AMC straight-6 engine remained available as an option, but the transmission was changed from the Tremec T-150 three-speed to a Tremec T-176 close-ratio four-speed. The Dana 30 front axle was retained, but the locking hubs were changed to a five-bolt retaining pattern versus the older six-bolt.

The demise of the AMC CJ5 model has been attributed to a December 1980 &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment where the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) staged a demonstration to illustrate that the CJ5 was apt to roll over &quot;in routine road circumstances at relatively low speeds.&quot; Years later, it was revealed the testers only managed to achieve eight rollovers out of 435 runs through a corner. The IIHS requested the testers implement &quot;vehicle loading&quot; (hanging weights in the vehicle&#x27;s corners inside the body, where they were not apparent to the camera) to generate worst-case conditions for stability.

===Special CJ-5 versions===
*1961 Tuxedo Park
*1962 Tuxedo Park Mark II
*1963 Tuxedo Park Mark III
*1964 Tuxedo Park Mark IV
:The early Tuxedo Park models were trim lines designed to make the CJ &quot;more comfortable and appealing to the general public.&quot; However, the Tuxedo Park Mark IV was claimed as a separate model from the other CJ series (marked in 1965 as the &quot;Universal&quot;), with more differences than past models. The Tuxedo Park Mark IV was an attempt to crack the mass market; it was, according to Jeep, “a new idea in sports cars ... the sportiest, most FUNctional car on the automotive scene.&quot; It added to the standard CJ chrome-plated bumpers, hood latches, gas cap, mirror, and tail lamp trim. Two wheelbases, and , were available, with a variety of convertible top and seat colors, and front bucket seats upholstered in &quot;pleated British calf-grain vinyl&quot;. Sales of this model, introduced in 1965, were low.
*1969–1970 Camper
:From 1969 Kaiser-Jeep offered a camper for the CJ-5 as a factory option, but also available separately, as it would fit any CJ-5 made since 1955. The camper mounted in the &quot;bed&quot; of the CJ-5, extended well beyond the back of the car, and had another axle of its own, that carried most of the weight. It also extended above the front seats of a CJ-5, which is where the main sleeper was located. When AMC bought Kaiser-Jeep in 1970, they ended the Jeep camper option. With only 336 produced, the Jeep Camper is one of the rarest commercial RV models ever.
*1969 462
:The 1969 Universal offered a &quot;462&quot; performance package. It was a limited-production model that featured the V6 engine, front bucket seats and a rear bench, roll bar, heavy-duty frame and springs, a locking differential, oil-pan skid plate, rear swing-out tire carrier, full wheel covers, ammeter, and oil pressure gauges; padded visors were optional.

*1970 Renegade I
:The 1970 &quot;Renegade I&quot; models continued the features of the &quot;462&quot; package, along with special hood trim stripes and limited colors. Renegade I production for 1970 is estimated between 250 and 500 units equipped with all of the previous performance upgrades along with a simple black stripe on the sides of the hood, new 8-inch wide white road wheels with G70x15 tires, and offered in only two bright colors: Wild Plum and Mint Green. Note that there may have been other colors produced including a pale yellow produced in October of 1969.
*1971 Renegade II
:The 1971 &quot;Renegade II&quot; continued the previous year&#x27;s features with bright alloy road wheels (replacing the painted steel units), the addition of a black center hood stripe, and new color selections: about 200 were painted Baja Yellow, 200 Mint Green, 50 Riverside Orange, and 150 finished in Big Bad Orange, the same paint as available on the &quot;Big Bad&quot; AMC AMX and Javelin. The AMC design studios proposed a striping scheme for a Renegade III model for the 1972 model year, but because of their popularity, the Renegade became a regular production appearance package option. 
*1972–1983 Renegade
:The 1972 &quot;Renegade&quot; was available from 1972 until 1983 with AMC&#x27;s V8 engine, alloy wheels, and a Trac-Lok limited-slip differential.
*1973 Super Jeep
:Only produced in 1973, the Super Jeep was an appearance package created because of a shortage of aluminum wheels needed for the CJ-5 Renegade versions. Only a few hundred were built.
*1977-1983 Golden Eagle
:From 1977 through 1983, the Golden Eagle package came with a soft-top or hard-top option, power disc brakes, power steering, tachometer, 304 CID V8, air conditioning, side steps, and Golden Eagle decals.
*1979 Silver Anniversary
:The 1979 Silver Anniversary edition was a limited-edition version (1000 units) of the Renegade model marketed to celebrate 25 years of the CJ-5. Features included a special &quot;Quick Silver&quot; metallic paint, black to silver accent body striping and special Renegade decals on the hood sides, black soft top, special spare tire cover, black vinyl bucket seats, and a dashboard plaque noting the CJ&#x27;s production from 1954 until 1979.
*1980 Golden Hawk — a 1980-only sticker package for CJ-5, CJ-7 and Cherokee.
*1980-1983 Laredo

=== Australia ===
In Australia, a unique variant of the CJ5/CJ6 was produced in limited numbers. In 1965, when the CJ was given the all-new Buick V6, Jeep saw the need for something similar in Australia. So, they began to fit Australian Ford Falcon 6-cylinder engines to them at their Rocklea factory in Queensland. The Jeep was fitted with an engine, pedal box, and clutch/brake system corresponding to the equivalent Falcon at the time; a 1965 CJ5 would be fitted with 1965 Falcon engine/clutch components. Combat 6 jeeps were also fitted with Australian Borg Warner differentials, and Borg Warner-brand gearboxes. Very little documentation about these Jeeps remains, and often the only way to conclusively identify them is by owner history.

===Brazil===
While most foreign assemblers focused on the CJ-3B, Brazil received the CJ-5, instead. After having closed their market to imported cars in 1954, assembly of the &quot;Willys Jeep Universal&quot; (as it was known in Brazil) from CKD kits began in 1957. By 1958, production relied on locally sourced components, with the vehicles equipped with a 2.6 liter I6 engine (also used by Willys do Brasil for passenger cars). The Universals came with a three-speed manual transmission. The Brazilian-built vehicles are easily recognized by their squared-off rear wheel openings. In 1961, a long-wheelbase version, similar to the CJ-6, was added to the line. Called the &quot;Willys Jeep 101&quot;, it shared the chassis of the local Rural, a redesigned Willys Jeep Station Wagon. Like the Brazilian-made CJ5s, the 101 has square rear-wheel openings. This version was introduced in 1961, but was not retained after Ford&#x27;s takeover in the fall of 1967.
On 9 October 1967, Ford do Brasil bought the Brazilian Willys subsidiary and took over the production of the CJ-5, the Willys Jeep Station Wagon-based &quot;Rural&quot;, and its pick-up truck version. Ford kept the line with no modifications except for some Ford badges on the sides and on the tailgate. In 1976, Ford equipped the CJ-5 and the Rural with the locally built version of the 2.3-L OHC four-cylinder engine used in the Ford Pinto (also used in the Brazilian Maverick) and a four-speed manual transmission. This engine produced (SAE) at 5000 rpm. In 1980, the engine was modified to run on Neat ethanol fuel (E100); this option lasted until 1983, when Ford ended the production of the CJ-5 in Brazil.

==CJ-6==
Introduced in 1953 as the M170 military version, the civilian CJ-6 made its debut in 1955 as a 1956 model. It was stretched version of the CJ-5 with a longer-wheelbase (101 in, 1955-1971 / 103.5 in, 1972–1981). The extended chassis allowed a variety of configurations, including adding a second row of seats. The M170 military version shared many of the features of the M38A1 (Military CJ-5), but had the passenger-door opening extended back to the rear wheel well. As in the CJ-5, the V6 and V8 engine choices appeared in 1965 and 1972.

The U.S. Forest Service put CJ-6 Jeeps into use. American sales ended after 1975, with the introduction of the CJ-7. A total of 50,172 were produced when the series went out of production in 1981.

Never very popular in the United States, most CJ-6 models were sold to Sweden and South America. It was also assembled in South Africa, by Volkswagen&#x27;s local subsidiary, and in Israel by Kaiser in Haifa and later by Israel automobile industries in Nazareth.
In Brasil, a local 4 door option existed for the 1963 model, called &quot;Jeep Universal 101 Bernardão 4 portas.&quot;


==CJ-5A and CJ-6A==
From 1964 until 1968, Kaiser elevated the Tuxedo Park from a trim package to a separate model for the CJ-5A and CJ-6A. A Tuxedo Park Mark IV is signified by a different prefix from a normal CJ-5 with a VIN prefix of 8322 and a CJ6a is 8422, while a normal CJ-5 VIN prefix is 8305 from 1964 through 1971.

==CJ-7==

The Jeep CJ-7 featured a wheelbase 10 inches longer than that of the CJ-5, with its curved side entry cutouts partially squared up to accommodate hinged doors. The other main difference between CJ-5 and CJ-7 was to the chassis, which consisted of two parallel longitudinal main c-section rails. To help improve vehicle handling and stability, the rear section of the chassis stepped out to allow the springs and shock absorbers to be mounted closer to the outside of the body. It was introduced for the 1976 model year, with a total of 379,299 built during eleven years of production.

Transmission options included the standard part-time two-speed transfer case, automatic, and an optional new automatic all-wheel drive system called Quadra-Trac. Other features included an optional molded hardtop and steel doors. The CJ-7 was also available in Renegade and Laredo models. Distinguished by their different body decals, the Laredo model featured highback leather bucket seats, a tilting steering wheel, and a chrome package that included the bumpers, front grill cover, and side mirrors. An optional Trak-Lok rear differential was available, too.

The final drive ratios of the CJ-7 were different for each type of engine: the diesel was mated to the 4.10 ratio axle (in both Renegade and Laredo), while the 258 cubic-inch straight six and 150 cubic-inch four-cylinder used 3.73 and AMC V8 304-powered models (produced 1976–1981, which became part of the Golden Eagle version) used the 3.55 ratio axles.

A diesel-powered version was made in the Ohio factory for export only. The engines were provided by General Motors, the owners of Isuzu Motor Cars. Production of this diesel version was between 1980 and 1982. This model had the Isuzu C240 engine, T176 transmission, and Dana 300 transfer case, although reports of some being produced with the Dana 20 exist. Typically, they had 4.1-ratio, narrow-track axles.

From 1976 through 1980, the CJ-7 came equipped with a Dana 20 transfer case, Dana 30 front axle (27- or 31-spline), and a 29-spline AMC 20 rear axle, while in later years, Laredo packages added a tachometer, chrome bumpers, tow hooks, and interior upgrades including leather seats and clock. In 1980, the Laredo was first fitted with an AMC 20 rear axle until mid-1986, when it was equipped with a Dana 44, and all 1980 and newer CJ-7s came with the Dana 300 transfer case.

The Canadian Army took delivery of 195 militarized versions of the CJ-7 in 1985. These were put into service as a stop-gap measure between the retirement of the M38A1 and the introduction of the Bombardier Iltis. They were codified by the Canadian Forces with the Equipment Configuration Code number 121526.

The CJ-7 continues to be used in the sport of mud racing, with either the stock body or a fiberglass replica. CJ-7 has been successfully and widely used as a favorite for rock crawling, through simple and complex modification. These last Jeeps produced were also highlighted with a factory dash plaque that read, &quot;Last of a Great Breed - This collectors-edition CJ ends an era that began with the legendary Jeep of World War II&quot;.


During 11 years of production, the CJ-7 had various common trim packages:
*1976-1986 Renegade (2.4D L6-2.5-4.2-5.0 AMC 304 V8)
*1977-1980 Golden Eagle (5.0 AMC 304 V8)
*1980 Golden Hawk (5.0 AMC 304 V8)
*1980-1986 Laredo (2.4D-4.2 I6)

Jeep also produced two special edition CJ-7 packages:
*1982-1983 Limited (2,500 units were built as a limited-production luxury model; 4.2 L I6 with T5 or automatic transmissions)
*1982 Jamboree Commemorative Edition (630 numbered units built for the 30th anniversary of the Rubicon Trail; 4.2L).  with only 630 units produced (560 Topaz Gold Metallic and 70 Olympic White), the CJ-7 Jamboree is the rarest CJ-7 ever built and one of the rarest Jeeps of all time. The Jamboree is in the same production rarity class as the 1971 CJ-5 Renegade-II. It is the most heavily optioned CJ ever built; it was the Rubicon of its day. All units were uniquely numbered via a dash plaque; it is the only AMC Jeep to have been numbered.

==Scrambler (CJ-8)==

The CJ-8, officially referred to as the Jeep Scrambler, was a long-wheelbase version of the CJ-7, introduced in 1981 and manufactured through 1986. It featured a wheelbase and a removable half cab, creating a small pick-up style box instead of using a separate pickup bed. Scramblers used the traditional transfer case with manual front locking hubs to engage the four-wheel drive. Most had either a four- or five-speed manual transmission, but a three-speed automatic transmission was an option. The Scrambler would be discontinued in 1986 and effectively replaced by the Cherokee-based Comanche. Former President Ronald Reagan owned a Scrambler and used it on his California ranch.

=== Alaska Postal Service ===
A full-length steel hardtop Scrambler was made for the Alaskan Postal Service, using right-hand drive and automatic transmissions. Instead of the rear tailgate, the steel hardtop used a hinged barn-door opening to the back. Only 230 were produced and sold in the U.S. It was also widely sold in Venezuela and Australia as the CJ8 Overlander, with small differences, including full-length rear windows on the Overlander. Steel hardtops used on these postal Scramblers and Overlanders were known as &quot;World Cab&quot; tops.

===Production===

&quot;There is some debate as to whether 1986 models were leftover units from the previous model year.&quot;

==CJ-10==
The Jeep CJ-10 was a CJ-bodied pickup truck based on a heavily modified Jeep J10 pickup truck. Produced from 1981 until 1985, it was sold and designed for export markets, Australia in particular. They featured rectangular headlights mounted in the fenders and a ten-slot grille, where all other CJ Jeeps had a seven-slot grille. The CJ-10 could have either a hard or soft top. The truck could be equipped to handle either a or GVW. Three engines were offered; a six-cylinder Nissan-built diesel engine, a four-cylinder AMC-built engine, or a six-cylinder AMC-built engine. The driveline was largely from the larger J series pickups, consisting of either a four-speed Tremec T177 manual transmission or a three-speed TorqueFlite A727 automatic transmission, a New Process 208 transfer case, a Dana 44 front axle, and either a semi-floating Dana 44 or Dana 60 rear axle, depending on GVW rating. Importation of the CJ-10 into Australia ended in 1985 with the drop of the Australian dollar&#x27;s value, causing the vehicle to be significantly more costly than its competitors.

==CJ-10A==
The Jeep CJ-10A was a CJ-10-based flightline aircraft tug. Produced in Mexico from 1984 until 1986, it was used by the United States Air Force as an aircraft-tug. It was a 4x2 bobtail design. About 2,300 were produced.

<text>Joseph Born (born May 5, 1969), better known as Joe Born, is an American inventor and businessman. As CEO of Aiwa and previously Neuros Technology and contributing inventor to many of its products, Joe Born has advocated on behalf of open source hardware, digital rights, and generally on the subject of the global maker movement, and open source.

==Professional accomplishments==
In 1995, after receiving a patent for a CD repair device, later named the SkipDoctor, Joe Born founded Digital Innovations, LLC. With an original investment of $15,000, the company was created to commercialize the skipdoctor invention. Joined in 1996 by Collin Anderson, they brought the invention to market in 1999, and, as of December 2013, had sold 10 million units of the SkipDoctor globally.

In September 2001, the Neuros division was started within Digital Innovations to develop open digital media products. In December 2003, Neuros was spun off into a separate entity, Neuros Technology, LLC. Influenced by its developer community, Joe Born, as Chief of Neuros, has become a pioneer in the field of open source hardware, helping to influence many of its partners to become more open, including successfully lobbying Texas Instruments to release a free compiler for a previously closed Digital Signal Processor

In March 2011, Joe Born and David W. Phillips founded Hale Devices (previously called Sonr Labs, Inc,) as a provider of Android audio peripherals.

After helping to bring his then 10-year-old daughter, Lily Born&#x27;s Kangaroo Cup invention to market in October 2012, Born has become an advocate for young inventors including advising the SEE/Dig-8 program at Nettlehorst Elementary School, a program created to teach product development and entrepreneurship to middle school students

Speaking engagements are typically focused on student entrepreneurship, open source and the maker movement and include: Ohio Linux Fest, LinuxWorld, LugRadioLive, Various Linux User Groups &amp; University of Chicago China Immersion program and Kellogg&#x27;s Masters of Management in Manufacturing Program.

In addition to consumer electronics, Born has also received patents in areas ranging from internal combustion engine components to cosmetic accessories.

<doc id="896950" wikidata="Q8022646" url="?curid=896950" title="Willys Hurricane engine">
<text>The Willys F4-134 Hurricane was an inline-4 F-head piston engine that powered the M38A1 military Jeep in 1952, followed by the famous Jeep CJ in the CJ-3B, CJ-5, and CJ-6 models. It was also used in the Willys 473 and 475 pickups, wagons, and sedan deliveries. It replaced the Willys Go Devil engine that was used in the MB Jeep and other early Jeep-based models like the Jeepster. This engine was also built by Mitsubishi for their license-built Jeep, for other applications.

== Design ==
The Hurricane was based on the earlier Go-Devil flathead engine. To enhance power from the engine, the induction system was changed from the Go-Devil&#x27;s side-valve configuration to an inlet-over-exhaust configuration, or &quot;F-head&quot;. This allowed the valves to be larger and the combustion chamber to be smaller, improving flow and increasing the compression ratio. The compression ratio rose from 6.5:1 in the Go-Devil engine to 7.5:1 in the Hurricane engine, although a version of the Hurricane engine was made with a 6.9:1 compression ratio.

==F134==
The L134 Go Devil was updated with the F-head to become the F134 in 1950. This engine produced a gross output of at 4000 rpm and of torque at 2000 rpm with a 7.5:1 compression ratio. The gross power and torque outputs decreased to and , respectively, when the engine had a 6.9:1 compression ratio. Bore and stroke dimensions were the same as the L-head engine at x inches, giving .

The F4-134 was introduced in 1950 in the Jeep Truck. Willys vehicles with this engine were designated 4-73 model. This engine was unavailable in the CJ series until the introduction of the CJ-3B version in 1953, which had a distinctive high hood to accommodate the much taller engine. Production of this engine continued through 1971, which was after American Motors Corporation (AMC) purchased Kaiser Jeep in 1970.

Applications:
* 1950–1961 Willys Jeep Truck
* 1950–1961 Willys Jeep Wagon
* 1950 Willys-Overland Jeepster
* 1952–1971 Willys M38A1
* 1953 Willys 475A Lark
* 1953–1968 Willys CJ-3B
* 1955–1971 CJ-5
* 1956–1971 CJ-6
* 1965-1967 DJ-5
* 1966–1971 Jeepster Commando

==F161==
The F6-161 Hurricane is an F-head version of the L6-161 Lightning flathead straight six. It was available in the Model 685 Station Wagon.

BF-161
The BF-161 has a inch bore and a inch stroke, a one-barrel carburetor, and an output of at 4400 rpm and of torque at 2000 rpm. Its displacement features a compression ratio of 7.6:1.

2600
The 2600 was the same BF-161 engine made in Brazil by Willys-Overland&#x27;s subsidiary, but it had two one-barrel carburetors (simultaneously opened) and had an output of at 4400 rpm and of torque at 2000 rpm. The compression ratio remained 7.6:1.

3000
The 3 L version is almost identical to the BF-161 engine, with the stroke increased to , giving it a displacement of . With a two-barrel carburetor, it produced at 4400 rpm and of torque at 2000 rpm. It also had a slightly higher compression ratio of 8:1. It initially used a different head with a removable intake manifold. 

After Ford acquired Willys-Overland do Brasil, they reverted the engine to its former head design with an integral intake manifold. Ford also improved the cooling between cylinders 5 and 6 as well as incorporating a side-mounted oil filter instead of the front-mounted, hose-connected system designed by Willys.

Applications:
* 1951–1952 Willys Aero
* 1960–1971 Willys Aero 2600
* 1960-1974 Willys-Overland Jeep and Rural Willys
* 1968–1971 Willys Itamaraty 3000
* 1972-1974 Ford Maverick six-cylinder version in Brazil

==Super Hurricane==

The 6-226 &quot;Super Hurricane&quot; was an L-head 6-cylinder from Continental with a bore of  inches and stroke of  inches, giving a displacement of . Horsepower rating is at 3600 rpm or at 3650 rpm, as well as a torque rating of at 1400 rpm or at 1800 rpm, depending on the year of production.

==Mitsubishi versions==
Mitsubishi built a version of the Hurricane from 1954 as the JH4 (69 hp), primarily for use in their license-built version of the Jeep. They later developed a overhead-valve diesel version of the same, called KE31. This was also turned into a 3.3 L six-cylinder version with the same internal dimensions, producing , which was named KE36. These diesel engines were used in the Jeep, but also in many light to medium-weight trucks and buses.

==Stellantis engine==
The 3.0-liter inline-6, called Hurricane turbo engine, developed in 2022 for use in Ram, Jeep, and Dodge vehicles, is unrelated to the original Willys Hurricane versions.

<doc id="896953" wikidata="Q263324" url="?curid=896953" title="William Hanna">
<text>William Denby Hanna (July 14, 1910 – March 22, 2001) was an American animator, voice actor, and occasional musician who is best known for co-creating &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; and providing the vocal effects for the series&#x27; title characters. Alongside Joseph Barbera, he also founded the animation studio and production company Hanna-Barbera.

Hanna joined the Harman and Ising animation studio in 1930 and steadily gained skill and prominence while working on cartoons such as &quot;Captain and the Kids&quot;. In 1937, while working at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hanna met Joseph Barbera. In 1957, they co-founded Hanna-Barbera, which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, creating or producing programs such as &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, and &quot;Yogi Bear&quot;. In 1967, Hanna-Barbera was sold to Taft Broadcasting for $12 million, but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company until 1991. At that time, the studio was sold to Turner Broadcasting System, which in turn was merged with Time Warner in 1996; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors.

&quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; won seven Academy Awards, while Hanna and Barbera were nominated for two others and won eight Emmy Awards. Their cartoons have become cultural icons, and their cartoon characters have appeared in other media such as films, books, and toys. Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s shows had a worldwide audience of over 300 million people in their 1960s heyday, and have been translated into more than 28 languages.

== Early and personal life ==
William Hanna was born to William John (1873–1949) and Avice Joyce (née Denby) Hanna (1882–1956) on July 14, 1910, in Melrose, New Mexico Territory. He was the third of seven children. Hanna described his family as &quot;a red-blooded, Irish-American family&quot;. His father was a construction superintendent for railroads as well as water and sewer systems throughout the Western United States, requiring the family to move frequently.

When Hanna was three years old, the family moved to Baker City, Oregon, where his father worked on the Balm Creek Dam. It was there that Hanna would develop his love of the outdoors. The family moved to Logan, Utah, before moving to San Pedro, California, in 1917. During the next two years they moved several times before eventually settling in Watts, California, in 1919.

In 1922, while living in Watts, he joined the Boy Scouts. He attended Compton High School from 1925 through 1928, where he played the saxophone in a dance band. His passion for music carried over into his career; he helped write songs for his cartoons, including the theme for &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. Hanna became an Eagle Scout as a youth and remained active in Scouting throughout his life. As an adult, he served as a Scoutmaster and was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with their Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 1985. Despite his numerous career-related awards, Hanna was most proud of this Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. His interests also included sailing and singing in a barbershop quartet. Hanna studied both journalism and structural engineering at Compton City College, but had to drop out of college with the onset of the Great Depression.

On August 7, 1936, Hanna married Violet Blanch Wogatzke (July 23, 1913 – July 10, 2014), and they had a marriage lasting over 64 years, until his death. The marriage produced two children, David William and Bonnie Jean, and seven grandchildren. In 1996, Hanna, with assistance from Los Angeles writer Tom Ito, published his autobiography—Joe Barbera had published his own two years earlier.

== Early career ==
After dropping out of college, Hanna worked briefly as a construction engineer and helped build the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. He lost that job during the Great Depression and found another at a car wash. His sister&#x27;s boyfriend encouraged him to apply for a job at Pacific Title and Art, which produced title cards for motion pictures. While working there, Hanna&#x27;s talent for drawing became evident, and in 1930 he joined the Harman and Ising animation studio, which had created the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series. 

Despite a lack of formal training, Hanna soon became head of their ink and paint department. Besides inking and painting, Hanna also wrote songs and lyrics. For the first several years of Hanna&#x27;s employment, the studio partnered with Pacific Title and Art&#x27;s Leon Schlesinger, who released the Harman-Ising output through Warner Bros. When Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising chose to break with Schlesinger and begin producing cartoons independently for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1933, Hanna was one of the employees who followed them.

Hanna was given the opportunity to direct his first cartoon in 1936; the result was &quot;To Spring&quot;, part of the Harman-Ising &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot; series. The following year, MGM decided to terminate their partnership with Harman-Ising and bring production in-house. Hanna was among the first people MGM hired away from Harman-Ising to their new cartoon studio. During 1938–1939, he served as a senior director on MGM&#x27;s &quot;Captain and the Kids&quot; series, based upon the comic strip of the same name (an alternate version of the &quot;Katzenjammer Kids&quot; that had resulted from a 1914 lawsuit). The series did not do well. Consequently, Hanna was demoted to a story man and the series was canceled. 

Hanna&#x27;s desk at MGM was opposite that of Joseph Barbera, who had previously worked at Terrytoons. The two quickly realized they would make a good team. By 1939 they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years. Hanna and Barbera worked alongside animation director Tex Avery, who had created Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed &quot;Droopy&quot; cartoons at MGM.

== &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; ==

In 1940, Hanna and Barbera jointly directed &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best (Cartoon) Short Subject. The studio wanted a diversified cartoon portfolio, so despite the success of &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, Hanna and Barbera&#x27;s supervisor, Fred Quimby, did not want to produce more cat and mouse cartoons. Surprised by the success of &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, Hanna and Barbera ignored Quimby&#x27;s resistance and continued developing the cat-and-mouse theme. By this time, however, Hanna wanted to return to working for Ising, to whom he felt very loyal. Hanna and Barbera met with Quimby, who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, he never actually worked on it. Quimby, who had wanted to start a new animation unit independent of Ising, then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat-and-mouse idea. The result was their most famous creation, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;.

Modeled after the &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot; characters with slight differences, the series followed Jerry, the rodent who continually outwitted his feline foe, Tom. Hanna said they settled on the cat and mouse theme for this cartoon because: &quot;We knew we needed two characters. We thought we needed conflict, and chase and action. And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good, basic thought.&quot; The revamped characters first appeared in 1941&#x27;s &quot;The Midnight Snack&quot;. Over the next 17 years Hanna and Barbera worked almost exclusively on &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, directing more than 114 highly popular cartoon shorts. During World War II they also made animated training films. 

&quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; relied mostly on motion instead of dialog. Despite its popularity, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; has often been criticized as excessively violent. The series won its first Academy Award for the 11th short, &quot;The Yankee Doodle Mouse&quot; (1943)—a war-time adventure. &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; was ultimately nominated for 14 Academy Awards, winning 7. No other character-based theatrical animated series has won more awards, nor has any other series featuring the same characters. Tom and Jerry also made guest appearances in several of MGM&#x27;s live-action films, including &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; (1945) and &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot; (1956) with Gene Kelly, and &quot;Dangerous When Wet&quot; (1953) with Esther Williams.

Quimby accepted each Academy Award for &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; without inviting Hanna and Barbera onstage. The cartoons were also released with Quimby listed as the sole producer, following the same practice for which he had condemned Ising. When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM&#x27;s animation division. As the studio began to lose more revenue due to television, MGM soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones. In 1957, MGM ordered Hanna and Barbera&#x27;s business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call. Hanna and Barbera found the no-notice closure puzzling because &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; had been so successful.

== Television ==

During his last year at MGM, Hanna branched out into television, forming the short-lived company Shield Productions with fellow animator Jay Ward, who had created the series &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot;. Their partnership soon ended, and in 1957 Hanna reteamed with Joseph Barbera to produce cartoons for television and theatrical release. The two brought different skills to the company. Barbera was a skilled gag writer and sketch artist, while Hanna had a gift for timing, story construction, and recruiting top artists. Major business decisions would be made together, though each year the title of president alternated between them. 

A coin toss determined that Hanna would have precedence in the naming of the new company, first called H-B Enterprises but soon changed to Hanna-Barbera Productions. Barbera and Hanna&#x27;s MGM colleague George Sidney, the director of &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, became the third partner and business manager in the company, and arranged a deal for distribution and working capital with Screen Gems, the television division of Columbia Pictures, who took part ownership of the new studio.

The first offering from the new company was &quot;The Ruff &amp; Reddy Show&quot;, a series which detailed the friendship between a dog and cat. Despite a lukewarm response for their first theatrical venture, &quot;Loopy De Loop&quot;, Hanna-Barbera soon established themselves with two successful television series: &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot; and &quot;The Yogi Bear Show&quot;. A 1960 survey showed that half of the viewers of &quot;Huckleberry Hound&quot; were adults. This prompted the company to create a new animated series, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. 

A parody of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, the new show followed a typical Stone Age family with home appliances, talking animals, and celebrity guests. With an audience of both children and adults, &quot;The Flintstones&quot; became the first animated prime-time show to be a hit. Fred Flintstone&#x27;s signature exclamation &quot;yabba dabba doo&quot; soon entered everyday usage, and the show boosted the studio to the top of the TV cartoon field. The company later produced a space-age version of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, known as &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. Although both shows reappeared in the 1970s and 1980s, &quot;The Flintstones&quot; was far more popular.

By the late 1960s, Hanna-Barbera Productions was the most successful television animation studio in the business. The Hanna-Barbera studio produced over 3,000 animated half-hour television shows. Among the more than 100 cartoon series and specials they produced were: &quot;Atom Ant&quot;, &quot;Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy&quot; (an imitation of the earlier &quot;Spike and Tyke&quot; MGM cartoons), &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;, &quot;Magilla Gorilla&quot;, &quot;Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks&quot;, &quot;Quick Draw McGraw&quot;, and &quot;Top Cat&quot;. &quot;Top Cat&quot; was based on Phil Silvers&#x27;s character Sgt. Bilko, though it has been erroneously reported that Sgt. Bilko was the basis for Yogi Bear. The Hanna-Barbera studio also produced &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; (1969–91) and &quot;The Smurfs&quot; (1981–89). The company also produced animated specials based on Alice in Wonderland, Jack and the Beanstalk, Cyrano de Bergerac, as well as the feature-length film &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; (1973).

As popular as their cartoons were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios to go out of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry out of work. Hanna-Barbera was key in the development of limited animation, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but also reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques in the early days of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;. 

To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation. The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Reviewers criticized the change from vivid, detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna–Barbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work. Limited animation became the standard for television animation, and continues to be used today in television programs such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, and &quot;South Park&quot;.

In 1966, Hanna-Barbera Productions was sold to Taft Broadcasting (renamed Great American Communications in 1987) for $12 million. Hanna and Barbera remained at the head of the company until 1991. At that point, the company was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System for an estimated , which itself merged with Time Warner, owners of Warner Bros., in 1996. This began a close association with the Cartoon Network. Hanna and Barbera continued to advise their former company and periodically worked on new Hanna-Barbera shows, including &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot; series and hit silver screen versions of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1994) and &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; (2002).

==Death==
Hanna died of esophageal cancer at his home in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California on March 22, 2001, at the age of 90. After his death, Cartoon Network aired a 20-second segment with black dots tracing Hanna&#x27;s portrait with the words &quot;We&#x27;ll miss you – Cartoon Network&quot; fading in on the right-hand side. This same type of tribute happened for Chuck Jones in 2002 and Hanna&#x27;s partner, Joseph Barbera in 2006, when each of them died. However, Barbera, unlike the other two, had an audio clip of his voice playing in his Cartoon Network promotional tribute. Hanna is buried at Ascension Cemetery in Lake Forest, California.

==Legacy==
Most of the cartoons Hanna and Barbera created revolved around close friendship or partnership; this theme is evident with Yogi Bear and Boo Boo, Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble, Ruff and Reddy, &quot;The Jetsons&quot; family, and the friends in &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;. These may have been a reflection of the close business friendship and partnership that Hanna and Barbera shared for almost 60 years. Professionally, they balanced each other&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses very well, but Hanna and Barbera traveled in completely different social circles. Hanna&#x27;s personal friends primarily included other animators. Barbera tended to socialize with Hollywood celebrities. 

Their division of work roles complemented each other but they rarely talked outside of work, since Hanna was interested in the outdoors and Barbera liked beaches, good food and drink. In their long partnership, in which they worked with over 2,000 animated characters, Hanna and Barbera rarely exchanged a cross word. Barbera said: &quot;We understood each other perfectly, and each of us had deep respect for the other&#x27;s work.&quot;

Hanna is considered one of the all-time great animators and on a par with Tex Avery. Hanna and Barbera were among the most successful animators on the cinema screen and successfully adapted to the change television brought to the industry. Leonard Maltin says the Hanna–Barbera team &quot;[may] hold a record for producing consistently superior cartoons using the same characters year after year—without a break or change in routine. Their characters are not only animated superstars, but also a very beloved part of American pop culture&quot;. They are often considered as Walt Disney&#x27;s only rivals as cartoonists.

Hanna and Barbera had a lasting impact on television animation. Cartoons they created often make &quot;greatest&quot; lists. Many of their characters have appeared in film, books, toys, and other media. During the 1960s their TV shows had a worldwide audience of over 300 million people and have since been translated into more than 20 languages. The works of Hanna and Barbera also have been recognized for their music, such as &quot;The Cat Concerto&quot; (1946) and &quot;Johann Mouse&quot; (1952), called &quot;masterpieces of animation&quot; in part due to their use of classical music.

In all, the Hanna–Barbera team won seven Academy Awards and eight Emmy Awards, including the 1960 award for &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot;, which was the first Emmy awarded to an animated series. They also won these awards: Golden Globe for Television Achievement (1960), Golden IKE Award—Pacific Pioneers in Broadcasting (1983), Pioneer Award—Broadcast Music Incorporated (1987), Iris Award—NATPE Men of the Year (1988), Licensing Industry Merchandisers&#x27; Association Award for Lifetime Achievement (1988), Governors Award of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (1988), Jackie Coogan Award for Outstanding Contribution to Youth through Entertainment Youth in Film (1988), Frederic W. Ziv Award for Outstanding Achievement in Telecommunications—Broadcasting Division College—Conservatory of Music University of Cincinnati (1989), stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (1976), several Annie Awards, several environmental awards, and were recipients of numerous other accolades prior to their induction into the Television Hall of Fame in 1994. In March 2005, the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences and Warner Bros. Animation dedicated a wall sculpture at the Television Academy&#x27;s Hall of Fame Plaza in North Hollywood to Hanna and Barbera.

Hanna&#x27;s audio of Tom Cat&#x27;s screams and various vocal effects he provided for the cat and mouse from the original &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons were reused in the 2006 direct-to-video film, &quot;Tom and Jerry: Shiver Me Whiskers&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry Tales&quot; (2006–2008 TV series, several season 1 episodes), and &quot;The Tom and Jerry Show&quot; (2014–2021 TV series). Outside of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, his screams were modified for the Critters in &quot;Critters 2&quot; and &quot;Critters 3&quot;, and were also used in the James Bond film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; and for the caveman in the video game &quot;Prehistorik Man&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, ACEP participated in a number of efforts to promote the uptake and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, including as a participant in the COVID-19 Vaccine Education and Equity Project led by the Alliance for Aging Research, HealthyWomen and the National Caucus and Center on Black Aging.

In early 2021, ACEP received an $8,000 grant from Pfizer to fund a public service announcement on vaccine confidence. On March 19, 2021, ACEP published a joint statement in support of COVID-19 vaccines alongside the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine.

<text>James Larkin (28 January 1874 – 30 January 1947), sometimes known as Jim Larkin or Big Jim, was an Irish republican, socialist and trade union leader. He was one of the founders of the Irish Labour Party along with James Connolly and William O&#x27;Brien, and later the founder of the Irish Worker League (a communist party which was recognised by the Comintern as the Irish section of the world communist movement), as well as the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (ITGWU) and the Workers&#x27; Union of Ireland (the two unions later merged to become SIPTU, Ireland&#x27;s largest trade union). Along with Connolly and Jack White, he was also a founder of the Irish Citizen Army (ICA; a paramilitary group which was integral to both the Dublin lock-out and the Easter Rising). Larkin was a leading figure in the Syndicalist movement.

Larkin was born to Irish parents in Toxteth, Liverpool, England. Growing up in poverty, he received little formal education and began working in a variety of jobs while still a child. He became a full-time trade union organiser in 1905. Larkin moved to Belfast in 1907, where he was involved in trade unionism and syndicalist strike action including organising the 1907 Belfast Dock strike. Larkin later moved south and organised workers in Dublin, Cork and Waterford, with considerable success. He founded the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union after his expulsion from the National Union of Dock Labourers for his taking part in strike action in Dublin against union instructions, this new union would quickly replace the NUDL in Ireland. He later moved to Dublin which would become the headquarters of his union and the focus of his union activity, as well as where the Irish Labour Party would be formed.

Larkin is perhaps best known for his role in organising the 1913 strike that led to the Dublin lock-out. The lock-out was an industrial dispute over workers&#x27; pay and conditions as well as their right to organise, and received worldwide attention and coverage. It has been described as the &quot;coming of age of the Irish trade union movement&quot;. The Irish Citizen Army was formed during the lock-out to protect striking workers from police violence. Not long after the lockout Larkin assumed direct command of the ICA, beginning the process of its reform into a revolutionary paramilitary organisation by arming them with Mauser rifles bought from Germany by the Irish Volunteers and smuggled into Ireland at Howth in July 1914.

In October 1914 Larkin left Ireland and travelled to America to raise funds for the ITGWU and the ICA, leaving Connolly in charge of both organisations. During his time in America, Larkin became involved in the socialist movement there, becoming a member of the Socialist Party of America. Larkin then became involved in the early communist movement in America, and he was later jailed in 1920 in the midst of the Red Scare after being found guilty of &quot;criminal anarchy&quot;. He then spent several years in Sing Sing, before he was eventually pardoned by the Governor of New York Al Smith in 1923 and later deported. Larkin then returned to Ireland where he again became involved in Irish socialism and politics, both in the Labour Party and then his newly formed Irish Worker League. Connolly by this time had been executed for his part in the Easter Rising and Larkin mourned the passing of his friend and colleague. 

After he lost control of the ITGWU, Larkin formed the Workers&#x27; Union of Ireland (WUI). The WUI was affiliated to Red International of Labour Unions (Profintern) soon after its formation. Larkin served as a Teachta Dála (TD) on three occasions, and two of his sons (James Larkin Jnr and Denis Larkin) also served as TDs. Jim Larkin served as Labour Party deputy in Dáil Éireann from 1943 to 1944, leaving Dáil Éireann for the last time in 1944, and dying in Dublin in 1947. Catholic Archbishop of Dublin John Charles McQuaid gave his funeral mass, and the ICA in its last public appearance escorted his funeral procession through Dublin to his burial site at Glasnevin Cemetery.

Larkin was respected by commentators both during and after his lifetime, with George Bernard Shaw describing him as the &quot;greatest Irishman since Parnell&quot;, his friend and colleague in the labour movement James Connolly describing him as a &quot;man of genius, of splendid vitality, great in his conceptions, magnificent in his courage&quot;, and Vladimir Lenin noting him as &#x27;a remarkable speaker and a man of seething energy [who] performed miracles amongst the unskilled workers&#x27;. However other commentators have noted that Larkin was &quot;vilified as a wrecker by former comrades&quot;, with anthologist Donal Nevin noting that some of Larkin&#x27;s actions, including his attacks on others in the labour movement, meant Larkin had &quot;alienated practically all the leaders of the movement [and] the mass of trade union members&quot; by the mid-1920s.

&quot;Big Jim&quot; Larkin continues to occupy a position in Dublin&#x27;s collective memory and streetscape, with a statue of him unveiled on O&#x27;Connell Street in 1979.

==Early years==
Larkin was said to have been born on 21 January 1876, and this was the date that he himself believed was accurate. However, it is now believed that he was actually born on 28 January 1874. He was the second eldest son of Irish emigrants, James Larkin, from Drumintee and Mary Ann McNulty, from Burren, County Down. The impoverished Larkin family lived in the slums of Liverpool during the early years of his life. From the age of seven, he attended school in the mornings and worked in the afternoons to supplement the family income, a common arrangement in working-class families at the time. At the age of fourteen, after the death of his father, he was apprenticed to the firm his father had worked for but was dismissed after two years. He was unemployed for a time and then worked as a sailor and docker. By 1903, he was a dock foreman, and on 8 September of that year, he married Elizabeth Brown.

From 1893, Larkin developed an interest in socialism and became a member of the Independent Labour Party. In 1905, he was one of the few foremen to take part in a strike on the Liverpool docks. He was elected to the strike committee and, although he lost his foreman&#x27;s job as a result, his performance so impressed the National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL) that he was appointed a temporary organiser. He later gained a permanent position with the union, which, in 1906, sent him to Scotland, where he successfully organised workers in Preston and Glasgow. Larkin campaigned against Chinese immigration, presenting it as a threat that would undercut workers, leading processions in 1906 in Liverpool with fifty dockers dressed as &#x27;Chinamen&#x27;, wearing faux-&#x27;pigtails&#x27; and wearing powder to provide a &#x27;yellow countenance&#x27;.

==Organising Irish labour movement (1907–1914)==
===Belfast Dock Strike===
In January 1907, Larkin undertook his first task on behalf of the trade union movement in Ireland, when he arrived in Belfast to organise the city&#x27;s dock workers for the NUDL. He succeeded in unionising the workforce and, because employers refused to meet the wage demands, he called the dockers out on strike in June. The Belfast Dock strike was soon joined by carters and coalmen, the latter settling their dispute after a month. With active support from the Independent Orange Order and its Grand Master, R. Lindsay Crawford, urging the &quot;unity of all Irishmen&quot;, Larkin succeeded in uniting Protestant and Catholic workers and even persuaded the local Royal Irish Constabulary to strike at one point, but the strike ended by November without having achieved significant success. Tensions regarding leadership arose between Larkin and NUDL general secretary James Sexton. The latter&#x27;s handling of negotiations and agreement to a disastrous settlement for the last of the strikers resulted in a lasting rift between Sexton and Larkin.

===Formation of Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union and founding of the Irish Labour Party===

In 1908, Larkin moved south and organised workers in Dublin, Cork and Waterford, with considerable success. His involvement, against union instructions, in a dispute in Dublin resulted in his expulsion from the NUDL. The union later prosecuted him for diverting union funds to give strike pay to Cork workers engaged in an unofficial dispute. After trial and conviction for embezzlement in 1910, he was sentenced to prison for a year. This was widely regarded as unjust, and the Lord-Lieutenant, Lord Aberdeen, pardoned him after he had served three months in prison. Also in 1908, Arthur Griffith during the Dublin carter&#x27;s strike described Larkin as an &quot;Englishman importing foreign political disruption into this country and putting native industry at risk&quot;.

After his expulsion from the NUDL, Larkin founded the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (ITGWU) at the end of December 1908. The organisation exists today as the Services Industrial Professional &amp; Technical Union (SIPTU). It quickly gained the affiliation of the NUDL branches in Dublin, Cork, Dundalk, Waterford and Sligo. The Derry and Drogheda NUDL branches stayed with the British union, and Belfast split along sectarian lines. Early in the new year, 1909, Larkin moved to Dublin, which became the main base of the ITGWU and the focus of all his future union activity in Ireland.

In June 1911, Larkin established a newspaper, &quot;The Irish Worker and People&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, as a pro-labour alternative to the capitalist-owned press. This organ was characterised by a campaigning approach and the denunciation of unfair employers and of Larkin&#x27;s political enemies. Its columns also included pieces by intellectuals. The paper was produced until its suppression by the authorities in 1915. Afterwards, the &quot;Worker&quot; metamorphosed into the new &quot;Ireland Echo&quot;.

In May 1912, in partnership with James Connolly and William O&#x27;Brien Larkin formed the Irish Labour Party as the political wing of the Irish Trades Union Congress. Later that year, he was elected to Dublin Corporation. He did not hold his seat long, as a month later he was removed because he had a criminal record from his conviction in 1910.

Under Larkin&#x27;s leadership, the union continued to grow, reaching approximately 20,000 members in the time leading up to the Dublin lock-out. In August 1913 during the lock-out, Larkin was described by Vladimir Lenin as a &#x27;talented leader&#x27; as well as &#x27;a remarkable speaker and a man of seething energy [who] has performed miracles amongst the unskilled workers&#x27;.

==Dublin Lockout, 1913==

===Build up to the lock-out, and its proceedings===
In early 1913, Larkin achieved some successes in industrial disputes in Dublin and, notably, in the Sligo Dock strike; these involved frequent recourse to sympathetic strikes and blacking (boycotting) of goods. Two major employers, Guinness and the Dublin United Tramway Company, were the main targets of Larkin&#x27;s organising ambitions. Both had craft unions for skilled workers, but Larkin&#x27;s main aim was to unionise the unskilled workers as well. He coined the slogan &quot;A fair day&#x27;s work for a fair day&#x27;s pay&quot;. Larkin advocated Syndicalism, which was a revolutionary brand of socialism. Larkin gained few supporters from within, particularly from the British Trade Union Congress who did not want strike action such as the lock-out to lead to a growth in radicalism.

Guinness staff were relatively well-paid and enjoyed generous benefits from a paternalistic management that refused to join a lockout of unionised staff by virtually all the major Dublin employers. This was far from the case on the tramways.

The chairman of the Dublin United Tramway Company, industrialist and newspaper proprietor William Martin Murphy, was determined not to allow the ITGWU to unionise his workforce. On 15 August, he dismissed 40 workers he suspected of ITGWU membership, followed by another 300 over the next week. On 26 August 1913, the tramway workers officially went on strike. Led by Murphy, over 400 of the city&#x27;s employers retaliated by requiring their workers to sign a pledge not to be a member of the ITGWU and not to engage in sympathetic strikes.

The resulting industrial dispute was the most severe in Ireland&#x27;s history. Employers in Dublin engaged in a sympathetic lockout of their workers when the latter refused to sign the pledge, employing blackleg labour from Britain and from elsewhere in Ireland. Guinness, the largest employer in Dublin, refused the employers&#x27; call to lock out its workers but it sacked 15 workers who struck in sympathy. Dublin&#x27;s workers, amongst the poorest in the whole of what was then the Great Britain and Ireland, were forced to survive on generous but inadequate donations from the British Trades Union Congress (TUC) and sources in Ireland, distributed by the ITGWU.

For seven months, the lockout affected tens of thousands of Dublin workers and employers, with Larkin portrayed as the villain by Murphy&#x27;s three main newspapers, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; and the &quot;Evening Herald&quot;, and by other bourgeois publications in Ireland.

Other leaders in the ITGWU at the time were James Connolly and William O&#x27;Brien; influential figures such as Patrick Pearse, Constance Markievicz and W. B. Yeats supported the workers in the generally anti-Larkin Irish press. &quot;The Irish Worker&quot; published the names and addresses of strike-breakers, and the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; published the names and addresses of men and women who attempted to send their children out of the city to be cared for in foster homes in Belfast and Britain. However, Larkin never resorted to violence. He knew it would play into the hands of the anti-union companies, and that he could not build a mass trade union by wrecking the firms where his members worked.

A group including Tom Kettle and Thomas MacDonagh formed the Industrial Peace Committee to attempt to negotiate between employers and workers; the employers refused to meet them.

Larkin and others were arrested for sedition on 28 August, and he was released on bail later that day. Connolly told the authorities &quot;I do not recognise the English government in Ireland at all. I do not even recognise the King except when I am compelled to do so.&quot; On 30 August, a warrant for Larkin&#x27;s arrest was put out, claiming he had again been seditious and had incited people to riot and to pillage shops. When a meeting called by Larkin for Sunday 31 August 1913 was proscribed, Constance Markievicz and her husband Casimir disguised Larkin in Casimir&#x27;s frock coat and trousers and stage makeup and beard, and Nellie Gifford, who was unknown to the police, led him into William Martin Murphy&#x27;s Imperial Hotel, pretending to be her stooped, deaf old clergyman uncle (to disguise his instantly recognisable Liverpool accent). Larkin tore off his beard inside the hotel and raced to a balcony, where he shouted his speech to the crowd below. The police – some 300 Royal Irish Constabulary reinforcing Dublin Metropolitan Police – savagely baton-charged the crowd, injuring between 400 and 600 people. MP Handel Booth, who was present, said that the police &quot;behaved like men possessed. They drove the crowd into the side streets to meet other batches of the government&#x27;s minions, wildly striking with their truncheons at everyone within reach ... The few roughs got away first, most respectable people left their hats and crawled away with bleeding heads. Kicking victims when prostrate was a settled part of the police programme.&quot; Larkin went into hiding, charged with incitement to breach the peace. Larkin was later re-arrested, charged with sedition and was handed a 7-month imprisonment. The Attorney General claimed Larkin had said: &quot;People make kings and can unmake them. I never said &#x27;God Save the King&#x27;, but in derision. I say it now in derision.&quot; to a crowd of 8,000 people from the windows of Liberty Hall. The sentence was widely seen as unjust. Larkin was released about a week later. As the lock out continued Larkin continued to speak out about the conditions being faced by workers and their families. On 4 October 1913 Larkin spoke at the lock out Tribunal of Inquiry:
===Formation of the Irish Citizen Army===
The violence at union rallies during the strike prompted Larkin to call for a workers&#x27; militia to be formed to protect themselves against the police, so Larkin, James Connolly, and Jack White created the Irish Citizen Army. The Citizen Army for the duration of the lock-out was armed with hurleys (sticks used in hurling, a traditional Irish sport) and bats to protect workers&#x27; demonstrations from the police. Jack White, a former Captain in the British Army, volunteered to train this army and offered £50 towards the cost of shoes to workers so that they could train. In addition to its role as a self-defence organisation, the Army, which was drilled in Croydon Park in Fairview by White, provided a diversion for workers unemployed and idle during the dispute.

===End of the lock-out===

The lock-out eventually concluded in early 1914 when calls by Connolly and Larkin for a sympathetic strike in Britain were rejected by the British TUC. Larkin&#x27;s attacks on the TUC leadership for this stance also led to the cessation of financial aid to the ITGWU, which in any case was not affiliated with the TUC.

Although the efforts of the ITGWU and the smaller UBLU did not succeed in securing significantly better pay and conditions for the workers, they represented a turning point in Irish labor history. The principle of union action and workers&#x27; solidarity was firmly established. Perhaps even more importantly, Larkin&#x27;s rhetoric condemning poverty and injustice and urging the oppressed to stand up for themselves left a lasting impression.

Not long after the lockout Jack White resigned as commander and Larkin assumed direct command of the ICA. Beginning the process of its reform into a revolutionary paramilitary organisation by arming them with Mauser rifles bought from Germany by the Irish Volunteers and smuggled into Ireland at Howth in July 1914. A written constitution was established stating the Army&#x27;s principles as follows: &quot;the ownership of Ireland, moral and material, is vested of right in the people of Ireland&quot; and to &quot;sink all difference of birth property and creed under the common name of the Irish people&quot;.

==In the US - Socialist, Irish Republican and Communist activism (1914–1923)==
===After the lock-out===
Exhausted by the demands of organising union work, Larkin fell into bouts of depression, took a declining interest in the now crippled ITGWU, and became increasingly difficult to work with. Speculation had risen during the lock-out that he was planning to leave for America. A speaking tour of the New World had been suggested to Larkin by Bill Haywood in November 1913 and the following month. The growing speculation prompted the New York Times to publish an editorial simply titled &#x27;Larkin is coming&#x27;. This dismayed colleagues in the ITGWU and Larkin felt obliged to deny that he was planning on running away. However, noting the effect of the strain of the lock-out on Larkin, union officials reluctantly concluded that a break would probably be of great benefit to him. Following the advice given by &#x27;Big Bill&#x27;, &#x27;Big Jim&#x27; therefore left for America. His decision to leave dismayed many union activists, including a large number of his colleagues in the ITGWU. In addition to recuperating from the strain of the lockout and undertaking a tour of the United States, Larkin also intended to raise funds for the union and the fledgling ICA, and to rebuild their headquarters Liberty Hall. Many in the union assumed that Larkin&#x27;s trip would be a short one and that he would soon return. However, it quickly became clear that this would not be the case. Shortly before his departure, he declined a request by the Irish Trades Union Congress to join a two-man mission to raise funds for the Labour Party, replying that if he went he would be &#x27;going alone and freelance&#x27;. His intention was to agitate in America rather than organise, but it is unclear whether he intended to return. Larkin set sail for America on 25 October 1914, leaving long-time associate James Connolly in charge of the ITGWU and the ICA, the latter of which he would soon utilise as a revolutionary force.

===Arriving in America - activism and links to espionage===
Larkin arrived in New York on 5 November 1914. Following his arrival there were positive initial prospects. The lock-out had been widely reported in America and he was well received by socialists there. He found support from both socialists and Irish-Americans, who were eager to hear his position on the World War which was by now raging throughout Europe. Opposition to the war was intended to be his main position whilst in America. Upon presenting his credentials to the Socialist Party of America and John Devoy, the Irish leader of Clan na Gael (the leading Irish republican supporting organisation in America), his services were quickly taken up by both and he also became involved in the Industrial Workers of the World union (the Wobblies). 

Within days of arriving in the country, he addressed a crowd of 15,000 people gathered at Madison Square Garden to celebrate the election of Socialist candidate Meyer London to the United States House of Representatives. Soon after his speech at Maddison Garden, he was invited by Devoy to speak to a combined audience of German Uhlans and Irish Volunteers in Philadelphia, where he enthusiastically called for money and arms for the Republican cause in Ireland to a cheering crowd. During this speech, Larkin showed one of the rifles that had been smuggled into Ireland at Howth, which he noted could be better but still worked. (He added that better weapons could be obtained with more money.) He compared it with a rifle given to the Irish Volunteers by John Redmond, which was an obsolete weapon for which no new ammunition could be procured, using this to vilify Redmond as a traitor to the Irish people and who had had no intention of arming the movement effectively for Irish independence. He also claimed that in the process of receiving and protecting the guns, 100 of his men from the ICA with no ammunition or bayonets had faced and routed 150 of the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, whom he disparagingly said had been referred to as &#x27;England&#x27;s best&#x27;. He went on to attack the First World War directly, particularly the efforts of the British to get men from Ireland to join their war effort, going on to say that if Ireland was to fight it would be against the British in an effort to create an Irish republic: &#x27;Why should Ireland fight for Britain in this war? What has Britain ever done for our people? Whatever we got from her we wrested with struggle and sacrifice. No, men and women of the Irish race, we shall not fight for England. We shall fight for the destruction of the British Empire and the construction of an Irish republic. We shall not fight for the preservation of the enemy, which has laid waste with death and desolation the fields and hills of Ireland for 700 years. We will fight to free Ireland from the grasp of that vile carcase called England&#x27;. 

In a speech to Clan na Gael in November 1914, Larkin promoted his Irish Republican ideals stating &#x27;I assure you that the workers of Ireland are on the side of the dear, dark-haired mother, whose call they never failed to answer yet ... again will the call ring out over hill and dale to the men who have always answered the call of Caithlin-ni-Houlihan. For seven hundred long, weary years we have waited for this hour. The flowing tide is with us ... [and we must be] ready for the Rising of the Moon&#x27;. He went on to say, in the same speech, that &#x27;The time is ripe for an active movement. We have waited years for this opportunity, and it could not come at a better time. We have the men and the plans, but only have 5000 rifles and no ammunition. Give us more guns and ammunition and we will not fail you. We have got something better than England ever had—destiny&#x27;. His speech was received well by the Clan and other nationalists, and his initial time with the clan was successful being asked to attend other speaking engagements.

Divisions began to appear, however, largely stemming from his anti-capitalist socialist ideals and pro-worker ideology, which were fundamentally at odds with many of the views of those in the clan and the Irish-America movement. Larkin&#x27;s religious ideals were also at odds with the largely secular American left, so he effectively alienated himself from both movements and speaking engagements began to dwindle. His speeches had attracted interest from the German embassy and he had been approached by military Attachés shortly after his speech in Philadelphia and offered $200 per week to undertake waterfront sabotage work. Larkin refused on humanitarian grounds and informed them that he was already engaged in organising strikes that would effectively hamper the Allied war effort by restricting American war-related industry, and that he had established the Four Winds Fellowship a society open to all trade unionists and socialists born in the British Empire and who were opposed to the war. Elsewhere, he was reported as having said that he did not want a German victory, instead preferring a military deadlock, leading to workers&#x27; revolts in the belligerent countries, a desire which came partly true, following the Russian Revolution of 1917. This perceived association with German agents further distanced him from American socialists, and his reputation as a syndicalist and association with the Industrial Workers of the World was looked down on by the right wing of the Socialist Party of America.

Larkin was reported as having helped to disrupt Allied munitions shipments in New York City during World War I. In 1937, he voluntarily assisted US lawyers investigating the Black Tom explosion by providing an affidavit from his home in Dublin. According to British Army Intelligence officer, Henry Landau:

Larkin testified that he himself never took part in the actual sabotage campaign but, rather, confined himself to the organising of strikes to secure both higher pay and shorter hours for workmen and to prevent the shipment of munitions to the Allies.

Larkin, however, had first-hand knowledge of German sabotage operations, supplied them with intelligence and contacts and was involved in the transfer of monies from the Germans to Irish Republican causes. He maintained communication with his German contacts. However, they began to tire of his refusals to cooperate with violence and broke contact with him after a rendezvous in Mexico City in 1917.

===Communism and arrest for &quot;criminal anarchy&quot;===
Following this, Larkin briefly worked with the IWW in San Francisco, before settling in New York and becoming involved with the Socialist Party of America again. He took advantage of the growing support for left-wing politics, and also of the increasing support for Irish republicanism amongst Irish Americans to gain influence amongst its ranks. Larkin was instrumental in the establishment of the New York James Connolly Socialist Club on St Patrick&#x27;s Day, 1918. Whilst in America, Larkin had become an enthusiastic supporter of the Soviets and, following an address at the club by Jack Reed, who had recently returned from Russia, interest in the Bolsheviks was revitalised. Larkin decided to put all his efforts into reforming the SPA into a communist party. This meant that he had to turn down an offer to lead the St Lawrence Mill Strike in March 1919. The Connolly Club became the national hub of the new communist project, housing the offices of Larkin&#x27;s SPA faction&#x27;s &quot;Revolutionary Age&quot; and Reed&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Labour&quot;. In June 1919, Larkin topped the polls for elections to the national left-wing council. He supported the view that the left of the SPA should attempt to take control at its national convention in August. A minority faction favoured the immediate creation of a new communist party and left in protest. Larkin, along with numerous other sympathisers of the Bolsheviks, was expelled from the Socialist Party of America at its national convention during the Red Scare of that year. As a result of this exodus, two new parties were formed from the ranks of the SPA&#x27;s communist former members, namely the American Communist Party and the Communist Labor Party of America. Favouring the latter, as he believed it to be more &#x27;American&#x27; (something which he believed was crucial), Larkin joined their ranks.
Larkin&#x27;s speeches in support of the Soviets, his association with founding members of both the American Communist Party and Communist Labor Party of America, and his radical publications made him a target of the &quot;First Red Scare&quot; that was sweeping the US and he was arrested on 7 November 1919 during a series of anti-Bolshevik raids. Larkin was charged with &#x27;criminal anarchy&#x27; due to his part in the publishing of the SPA&#x27;s &#x27;Left-wing manifesto&#x27; in &quot;Revolutionary Age&quot;. Larkin was released on 20 November, after $15,000 bail was paid, of which John Devoy paid $5,000. He resumed his political activities but was under no illusion of what was to come, expecting to be handed a lengthy jail sentence. New York State Prosecutor Alexander Rourke took advantage of a query from Scotland Yard as to whether Larkin would be allowed to travel to South Africa to turn his allies in the Irish nationalist movement, including Devoy, against him. In reality, this request did not stem from any association with figures of authority in Britain, but rather a request by Archie Crawford, President of the South African Federation of Labour who wanted Larkin for a speaking tour of the country. A trial took place in which Larkin represented himself, presenting his view that his own beliefs rather than his deeds were on trial, and exhibiting a philosophy incorporating his new-found Bolshevism as well as his Christianity, Socialism, Syndicalism, Communism and Irish nationalism. Despite many onlookers being of the opinion that he had gained enough sympathy to divide the jury, Larkin&#x27;s fears were instead realised: he was found guilty and sentenced to five to ten years, to be served in the notorious Sing Sing prison.

===Time in prison===

While most of his sentence was served at Sing Sing, Larkin also spent time in other prisons in America, briefly moving to Clinton prison (Dannemora) after only one month at Sing Sing. This move was in order to discourage visitation. A journalist from the New York Call managed to gain an interview with Larkin whilst he was incarcerated there, and the reported deterioration of Larkin&#x27;s condition led to international protests which ultimately resulted in him moving back to Sing Sing later that year. Whilst at Sing Sing, Larkin was supplied with books and the means to write and communicate with the outside world. Keeping a keen eye on Irish affairs, Larkin sent a &#x27;thunderous denunciation of the Anglo-Irish Treaty&#x27; to Dublin on 10 December 1921. Larkin&#x27;s most famous visitor whilst he was imprisoned was Charlie Chaplin who noted that he was &#x27;diffident&#x27; and &#x27;concerned for his family&#x27;, about whom he had heard nothing since his incarceration. Chaplin sent presents to Larkin&#x27;s wife Elizabeth and their children. Larkin was later moved to Great Meadow, a comfortable, open prison, where he was visited by Constance Markievicz who, whilst noting his apparent appreciation of his conditions, also sensed his fretfulness at being cut off from politics. On 6 May 1922, Larkin was released before being rearrested shortly afterwards for another charge of criminal anarchy and served with a deportation warrant. Larkin appealed and, during his time out of jail, he was cabled by Grigory Zinoviev President of the Communist International (Comintern) who gave their &#x27;warmest greetings to the undaunted fighter released from the &quot;democratic&quot; prisons&#x27;. In February of that year, Larkin had been elected to the Moscow Soviet to represent the Moscow International Communist Tailoring Factory by a union of tailors, most of them returnees to Russia from the USA. Larkin&#x27;s court appeal failed and he was back in custody by 31 August, despite various plans being discussed, including a potential escape plan raised by Thomas Foran of the ITGWU and numerous legal challenges. Larkin decided to bide his time. During this time it was also arranged for Larkin&#x27;s son, James, to visit him in prison.

===Release and departure from the United States===
The election of Irish-American Al Smith to the position of Governor of New York in November 1922 represented a change in circumstances and was also a clear indication that the Red Scare had largely abated. Smith granted Larkin a pardon hearing which was set for January 1923, the pardon was granted and he was released from prison. Foran cabled Larkin to convey the ITGWU&#x27;s satisfaction with the events and to seek the date of his return to Ireland. Although Larkin had his mind set on a return to Ireland, he had grander plans than a return to union work. The Comintern wrote to Larkin on 3 February to express their &#x27;great joy&#x27; at his release and to extend an invitation to visit Soviet Russia at his earliest opportunity, to &#x27;discuss a number of burning questions affecting the international revolutionary movement&#x27;. Larkin made a number of financial requests to the ITGWU, including asking them to cover the costs of purchasing passage on a steamer ship, although he, in characteristic fashion, did not reveal the reason. The union&#x27;s new leadership began to see him as out of touch, and that if allowed to do so he would attempt to restore his previous near-total command over the union. The union had also already spent large sums of money on Larkin&#x27;s behalf—making sure his wife Elizabeth was taken care of, covering his medical expenses and covering the costs of James Jnr&#x27;s visit to see him in America. For these reasons, the additional financial requests were denied, a decision which begat what would become an intense split in the union movement in Ireland. After lobbying the Secretary for Labor for a deportation order, which was granted, he was arrested and charged with being an alien activist. He was then taken to the British consulate where he was given a passport to travel by ship first to the United Kingdom and then to Ireland. Although Larkin had hoped to have been allowed to travel to Germany, Austria and Russia on business matters, this request was denied. On 21 April, he boarded a ship bound for Southampton and left America for good.

==Return to Ireland - communist activity and split in Irish trade union movement==
. However, he soon found himself at variance with William O&#x27;Brien, who, in Larkin&#x27;s absence, had become the leading figure in the ITGWU and the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress. Larkin was still officially general secretary of the ITGWU. The ITGWU leaders (Thomas Foran, William O&#x27;Brien, Thomas Kennedy: all colleagues of Larkin during the Lockout) sued him. The bitterness of the court case between the former organisers of the 1913 Lockout would last over 20 years.

===Formation of the Irish Worker League and involvement with Soviet Union===
Larkin agreed with British and Soviet communists to take on the leadership of communism in Ireland and, in September 1923, Larkin formed the Irish Worker League (IWL), which was soon afterwards recognised by The Communist International (Comintern; a Soviet Union controlled international organisation that advocated world communism) as the Irish section of the world communist movement. The IWL enrolled 500 members on its inauguration and, following the death of Lenin on 21 January 1924, Larkin led a march of 6,000 people to mourn his passing. In March 1924, Larkin lost his battle for control of the ITWGU and, in May, the army prevented his followers from seizing Liberty Hall. In June 1924, Larkin attended the Comintern congress in Moscow and was elected to its Executive Committee. 
The League&#x27;s most prominent activity in its first year was to raise funds for imprisoned members of the Anti-Treaty IRA.

During Larkin&#x27;s absence from Ireland at the 1924 Comintern Congress in Moscow (and apparently against his instructions), his brother Peter took his supporters out of the ITGWU, forming the Workers&#x27; Union of Ireland (WUI). The new union quickly grew, gaining the allegiance of about two-thirds of the Dublin membership of the ITGWU and of a smaller number of rural members. It was affiliated to the Soviet Red International of Labour Unions (Promintern).

With Soviet support, Larkin sought to remove British unions from Ireland, seeing them as &#x27;outposts of British imperialism&#x27;. It was also agreed that Irish sections of the communist movement would deal directly with Moscow and would have permanent representation there, rather than going through Britain. Larkin later launched a vicious attack on Tom Johnson who was now leader of the Labour Party and who like Larkin, was Liverpool-born. Johnson had been born to English parents but had spent much of his life in Ireland. Larkin, although born to Irish parents, had spent as long in the US as he had in Ireland. Larkin said that it was &quot;time that Labour dealt with this English traitor. If they don&#x27;t get rid of this scoundrel, they&#x27;ll get the bullet and the bayonet in reward. There&#x27;s nothing for it, but a dose of the lead which Johnson promises to those who look for work.&quot; This implied incitement to murder Johnson in a still-violent post-Civil War country resulted in the court awarding Johnson £1000 in libel damages against Larkin. In his 2006 biographical anthology, Donal Nevin noted that his attacks on colleagues in the labour movement, including those the subject of this libel action, meant that Larkin &quot;alienated practically all the leaders of the movement [and] the mass of trade union members&quot;.

In January 1925, the Comintern sent Communist Party of Great Britain activist Bob Stewart to Ireland to establish a communist party in co-operation with Larkin. A formal founding conference of the Irish Worker League, which was to take up this role, was set for May 1925. A fiasco ensued when the organisers discovered at the last minute that Larkin did not intend to attend. Feeling that the proposed party could not succeed without him, they called the conference off as it was due to start in a packed room in the Mansion House, Dublin. Larkin perceived certain actions undertaken by Stewart as attempts to circumvent his authority, including sending a republican delegation to Moscow and directing £500 sent by the Russian Red Cross intended to aid the Irish famine relief effort to George Lansbury a left-wing British Labour M.P., rather than to the WUI.

Under pressure from Comintern to operate as a political party or risk losing affiliation, Larkin fielded three candidates at the September 1927 Irish general election; himself, his son James Larkin Jnr, and WUI President John Lawlor. Larkin ran in Dublin North and, in circumstances that surprised many, was elected, becoming the first and only communist to be elected to Dáil Éireann. However, as a result of a libel award won against him by William O&#x27;Brien, which he had refused to pay, he was an undischarged bankrupt and could not take up his seat. Between November of that year and March 1928, six students including Larkin&#x27;s son James Larkin Jnr were sent to Moscow to attend the International Lenin School. In February 1928, Larkin made what would be his penultimate visit to Moscow for the ninth plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International. Here he departed from his usual subject matter. His public speeches in Russia were usually and almost exclusively centred on the need for trade union solidarity and largely avoided comment on communist politics. However, he now delivered a lecture on &quot;Ireland, trade unions and the peasantry&quot; at the Moscow Soviet, and asked the audience to support Josef Stalin. He also endorsed the Comintern line that the Communist Party of Great Britain should adopt a hostile rather than fraternal attitude towards the British Labour Party as well as denouncing the CPGB&#x27;s refusal to back the removal of British unions from Ireland and their record on trade unions in general. Before leaving, Larkin warned Solomon Lozovsky (General Secretary of Profintern) that the WUI executive wanted to break with Profintern unless their promises were made good. 

Relations between Larkin and Moscow would ultimately continue to strain, despite occasional apparent promise, and, in the time building up to the 1930s, the final break was fast approaching. In 1929, in a letter to Moscow, Larkin announced his retirement from active political work. However, he asked that the Irish at the Lenin School be supported, noting that James Jnr was &quot;his own man and an earnest communist&quot;. Larkin would, in fact, continue to be politically active for all of his life and used the League as a political platform into the 1930s. He did, however, sever ties with Profintern, declaring that they had not given the WUI proper financial support and accusing Lozovsky of intriguing against him. In September 1929, a new communist group became active in Dublin but had orders not to &quot;disturb the big noise&quot;, with Moscow fearing that Larkin would smash its initiatives in the city, whilst also secretly still hoping that Larkin would provide the mass base it desired in Ireland. Ultimately, Larkin would neither support communist activity nor oppose his successors.

Larkin&#x27;s unsuccessful attempts to gain a position as a commercial agent in Ireland for the Soviet Union may have contributed to his disenchantment with Stalinism. The Soviets, for their part, had been increasingly impatient with what they saw as his ineffective leadership. From the early 1930s, Larkin drew away from the Soviet Union entirely. In the 1932 general election, he stood, without success, as a communist and, in 1933 and subsequently, he ran as &quot;Independent Labour&quot;. The reasons for the eventual collapse in relations between the Soviet Union and Larkin can, to some extent, be put down to his underlying motivations. According to Emmet O&#x27;Connor, his aims were to &quot;discredit the ITWGU, and Labour Party leadership, drive the British unions out of Ireland, and build an anti-imperialist front with republicans&quot;. His Syndicalist ideology was also largely out of place in a Leninist context, eventually being regarded by Comintern as a &quot;first generation communist leader&quot; whose ideology had been formed during the period prior to 1914. It is also claimed that he had, by this time, fallen into a degenerated state of egomania, was &quot;violently&quot; averse to being accountable to anyone but himself and consequently suspicious of anything that was outside of his own personal control. It could be said that some of Larkin&#x27;s suspicions and apparent paranoias were justified, as it was clear that the Communist Party of Great Britain frequently attempted to circumvent him in liaising with the IRA and the Worker&#x27;s Party behind his back. Additionally its Minority Movement blatantly ignored Profintern instructions and refused to honour the agreement on the withdrawal of British unions from Ireland, which resulted in Larkin directing much of his irritation on the matter towards Profintern. 

One of Larkin&#x27;s primary ambitions from his association with the Soviet Union was to finance his new trade union, and thus many of the same issues that had arisen from his time with James Connolly arose again. That being the hyperfocus on union activity, with political mobilisation an after thought, the Labour Party had suffered from this diversion of attention and so consequently did the IWL. Larkin had advocated revolutionary socialism. However, neither Larkin nor Connolly had focused on building a revolutionary party, frequently seeing political developments as only &quot;an echo&quot; of the industrial battle, and played down the need for a party that had a consistent and clear ideology and view of the world, thinking mass unionisation would be enough. At the height of the 1913 lock-out, when the men were at the height of their popularity, they made no particular concerted effort to recruit workers to a socialist party. This allowed other political parties to take advantage of much of their work, despite not having supported workers during the lock-out. Through a combination of a lack of cohesion and co-operation, an opportunity for a successful communist movement in Ireland, in a time where a revolutionary mentality still remained, was missed. This was perhaps a movement which only Larkin could have achieved, as an obvious figurehead who still remained widely popular amongst the Irish left, and with an Irish Labour movement which had swung towards Syndicalism. Communism in Ireland at this time also had a distinct lack of controversy surrounding it, with the IRA sending delegations to Moscow and maintaining a widespread and open association with Profintern. Following the Catholic Church&#x27;s rallying against Communism from 1929 onwards, the mood quickly changed.

In 1934, Larkin gave important evidence on the 1916 Black Tom explosion to John J. McCloy, allowing a case for damages against Germany to be reopened, presumably because of Germany&#x27;s new Nazi government.
During this period, he also engaged in a rapprochement with the Catholic Church, from whom he had become distant after the Church&#x27;s vehement ostracisation of communism, which had followed a resurgence of Catholic social power, stemming from the centenary celebrations of Catholic emancipation in 1929, and the publishing of Quadragesimo anno in 1931. In 1936, he regained his seat on Dublin Corporation. He then regained his Dáil seat at the 1937 general election but lost it again the following year. In that period, the Workers&#x27; Union of Ireland also entered the mainstream of the trade union movement, being admitted to the Dublin Trades Council in 1936, but the Irish Trades Union Congress would not accept its membership application until 1945.

===Return to Labour Party===
In 1941, a new trade union bill was published by the Government. Inspired by an internal trade union restructuring proposal by William O&#x27;Brien, it was viewed as a threat by the smaller general unions and the Irish branches of British unions (known as the &quot;amalgamated unions&quot;). Larkin and the WUI played a leading role in the unsuccessful campaign against the bill. After its passage into law, he and his supporters successfully applied for admission to the Labour Party, where they were now regarded with more sympathy by many members. In response, O&#x27;Brien disaffiliated the ITGWU from the party, forming the rival National Labour Party and denouncing what he claimed was communist influence in Labour. Larkin later served as a Labour Party deputy in Dáil Éireann from 1943 to 1944.

==Death==
In late 1946, Larkin fell through a floor whilst supervising repairs to the Worker&#x27;s Union of Ireland&#x27;s Thomas Ashe Hall in Dublin. He suffered serious internal injuries and was rushed to hospital. He survived the accident but he never recovered from his injuries and died in his sleep in the Meath Hospital on 30 January 1947. Fr Aloysius Travers, OFM (who had administered last rites to James Connolly in 1916) also administered extreme unction to Larkin. His funeral mass was celebrated by the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, John Charles McQuaid, who had visited him in the hospital before he died, and thousands lined the streets of the city as the hearse passed through on the way to Glasnevin Cemetery, escorted by the Irish Citizen Army in its last public appearance.

==Religion and personal life==
Larkin is said to have been a Christian socialist. Larkin remained a Catholic throughout his life, and asserted there was no inherent conflict between his religious views and his politics:
Larkin was married to Elizabeth Brown, with whom he had four sons; James Larkin Jnr, Denis Larkin, Fintan Larkin and Bernard Larkin. Two of whom (James Jnr and Denis) followed their father into socialist politics and trade unionism, serving in political parties and unions established by their father and serving terms in Dáil Éireann. James Larkin Jnr represented both Dublin South and Dublin South-Central, and Denis Larkin represented one of his fathers&#x27; previous constituencies Dublin North-East and also later served a term as Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1955 to 1956. Larkin&#x27;s sister Delia Larkin was also a prominent trade unionist and a founder of the Irish Women Workers&#x27; Union. Larkin separated from his wife Elizabeth, and did not live with her again following his return from America, although her death in 1945 is said to have affected him a great deal.

===Allegations of antisemitism===
Allegations of antisemitism have been levelled at Larkin, and he has been accused of running antisemitic verses in the &quot;Irish Worker&quot; paper. One told of a &quot;Jewess&quot; (female Jew) who was demanding back the price of her pushy son&#x27;s theatre ticket when, rushing to get the best seat in the house, he fell to his death from a balcony. He soon republished the same caricature. Larkin ran a cartoon aimed at a particular group of Jewish immigrants which were described as &quot;foreigners masquerading under Irish names&quot;. The cartoon used stereotypical physical characteristics, as well as mock-immigrant pronunciation and &quot;ikey&quot;, said to be regarded as a derogatory nickname for Jews. Larkin&#x27;s &quot;The Jew&#x27;s Shilling&quot; has been provided as another example by Colum Kenny.

==Commemorations==

===Literature===
Larkin has been the subject of poems by Brendan Behan, Patrick Kavanagh, Frank O&#x27;Connor, Donagh MacDonagh and Lola Ridge; his character has been central in plays by Daniel Corkery, George Russell (Æ), and Seán O&#x27;Casey; and he is a heroic figure in the background of James Plunkett&#x27;s novel &quot;Strumpet City&quot; and Lyn Andrews&#x27; &quot;Where the Mersey Flows&quot;. &quot;Strumpet City&quot; was later developed into a television mini-series of the same name, in which Larkin was portrayed by British-Irish actor Peter O&#x27;Toole.

===Songs===
James Larkin was memorialised by the New York Irish rock band Black 47, in their song &quot;The Day They Set Jim Larkin Free&quot;. Donagh MacDonagh&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of James Larkin&quot; was recorded by Christy Moore, The Dubliners and The Buskers. Paddy Reilly sings a song simply entitled &quot;Jim Larkin&quot; that describes the lot of the workers and their appreciation of the changes made by Larkin and Connolly. The song &quot;The Lockout&quot; by Joe O&#x27;Sullivan describes Larkin&#x27;s organisation of workers which led to the Dublin Lockout of 1913.

===Monuments===
Today a statue of &quot;Big Jim&quot; stands on O&#x27;Connell Street in Dublin. Completed by Oisín Kelly, and unveiled in 1979, the inscription on the front of the monument is an extract in French, Irish and English from one of his famous speeches:
&quot;Les grands ne sont grands que parce que nous sommes à genoux: Levons-nous.&quot;
&quot;Ní uasal aon uasal ach sinne bheith íseal: Éirímis.&quot;
The great appear great because we are on our knees: Let us rise.

The slogan, first used on the 18th-century French radical paper &quot;Révolutions de Paris&quot;, also appeared on the masthead of the &quot;Workers&#x27; Republic&quot;, founded by James Connolly in Dublin in August 1898. Originally the organ of the Irish Socialist Republican Party, this periodical later became the official organ of the Communist Party of Ireland, which was founded in 1921. The original slogan is usually attributed to Camille Desmoulins (1760–1794), the French revolutionary; but it appears, only slightly modified, in an essay written by Étienne de La Boétie (1530–1563) and first published in 1576.

On the west side of the base of the Larkin monument is a quotation from the poem &quot;Jim Larkin&quot; by Patrick Kavanagh:

On the east side of the monument, there is a quotation from &quot;Drums under the Windows&quot; by Seán O&#x27;Casey:

... He talked to the workers, spoke as only Jim Larkin could speak, not for an assignation with peace, dark obedience, or placid resignation, but trumpet-tongued of resistance to wrong, discontent with leering poverty, and defiance of any power strutting out to stand in the way of their march onward.

A life-sized statue of Larkin is located in Donegall Street Place, Belfast.

===Roads and buildings===
A coastal road in Raheny, north Dublin, is named after him. A road in L4 1YQ, Kirkdale, in his home city of Liverpool, just off Scotland Road, is called James Larkin Way. James Larkin House, flats in the North Strand of Dublin takes his name.

===Liverpool Irish Festival 2008===
To celebrate Liverpool&#x27;s year as European Capital of Culture, the Liverpool Irish Festival held a James Larkin Evening at the &#x27;Casa&#x27; bar — the dockers&#x27; pub in central Liverpool. This was attended by Francis Devine who wrote the general history of the trade union movement in Dublin and the formation of SIPTU. It was introduced by Liverpool Irishman Marcus Maher, who travelled from Dublin to present a specially commissioned painting by Finbar Coyle to James Larkin&#x27;s last remaining Liverpool nephew, Tom Larkin. The painting reflects on one side Dublin and on the other side the Liver Bird and his home city of Liverpool.

===People===
The Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union activist Jack Jones, whose full name was James Larkin Jones, was named in honour of his fellow Liverpudlian.

<text>The Federal Court of Canada, which succeeded the Exchequer Court of Canada in 1971, was a national court of Canada that had limited jurisdiction to hear certain types of disputes arising under the federal government&#x27;s legislative jurisdiction. Originally composed of two divisions, the Appellate Division and the Trial Division, in 2003 the Court was split into two separate Courts, the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal. 
The court used facilities as the Supreme Court of Canada Building as well as Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee Building and registry office at 90 Elgin Street.

==History==
===Pre-Confederation to Confederation===
Prior to Confederation, the predominantly English-speaking Canada West (which succeeded Upper Canada) and the predominantly French-speaking Canada East (which succeeded Lower Canada) each had a separate system of courts. During pre-Confederation negotiations, the creation of a national court had been contemplated to deal with matters relating to federal law. The &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; thus provided under s. 101 that:

The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from Time to Time provide for the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the Establishment of any additional Courts for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada.

Despite the language in the constitution, a national court was not established until 1875. Prime Minister John A. Macdonald made several attempts between 1869 and 1873 to create a national court under the powers granted to Parliament under s. 101 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. However, these early attempts were rebuffed due to concerns over jurisdiction, particularly because the early proposals would have established a federal Supreme Court exercising both original (trial) jurisdiction and concurrent appellate jurisdiction potentially in conflict with existing courts administered by Ontario and Quebec.

While no court &quot;&quot; was created, provision was made for the appointment of Official Arbitrators, whose decisions soon became subject to a final appeal to a Board of Arbitrators, until a further right of appeal to the new Exchequer Court was created in 1879.

===Exchequer Court===
In 1875, the Liberal government of Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie passed &quot;The Supreme and Exchequer Court Act&quot; (introduced by Minister of Justice Telesphore Fournier), which was based on Macdonald&#x27;s earlier unsuccessful bill of 1870. This act created both the Supreme Court of Canada and the Exchequer Court. The jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court was provided under sections 58 and 59 of the Act:

&quot;The Supreme and Exchequer Court Act&quot; made it clear that the Exchequer Court of Canada was inspired by the Court of Exchequer in England, both in name and in jurisdiction, focusing as it did on matters of revenue. In the same year, however, England abolished the Court of Exchequer, merging its jurisdiction into the High Court of Justice. Nonetheless, the jurisdiction provided to the Exchequer Court of Canada initially consisted of:

:* concurrent original jurisdiction over all cases relating to the enforcement of the revenue laws;
:* exclusive original jurisdiction over any demand or relief sought in like manner as the English Court of Exchequer in its revenue side; and
:* concurrent original jurisdiction over all civil cases where the Crown is the plaintiff or petitioner.

The independence of the Exchequer Court was not immediately established. Indeed, justices of the Supreme Court also sat as justices of the Exchequer Court in the early years. The two Courts were not separated until 1887, at which time the functions of the Official Arbitrators were subsumed into the Exchequer Court. George W. Burbidge, a lawyer from New Brunswick, was the first Exchequer Court judge appointed under this new arrangement. At the same time, the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction was expanded to include exclusive original jurisdiction over all claims against the Crown.

===Jurisdiction over railway insolvency===
Beginning in 1901, railways gained the ability under the &quot;Railway Act&quot; to apply to the Court to secure a scheme of arrangement in the event of insolvency.

===Acquisition of admiralty jurisdiction===
While s. 96 of the &quot;BNA Act, 1867&quot; constituted the superior courts in the provinces, admiralty law jurisdiction was not conferred on them, which continued to be vested in the vice-admiralty courts under the British Vice Admiralty Courts Act 1863 (26 &amp; 27 Vict. c. 24 (UK)). Separate courts existed in British Columbia, Lower Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The absence of such a court for Ontario led to the Parliament of Canada, exercising its power under s. 101, to create the Maritime Court of Ontario through the passage of the &quot;Maritime Jurisdiction Act 1877&quot;. This was held to be a valid exercise of federal jurisdiction by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1879.

This mix of courts was rationalized after the British Parliament passed the &quot;Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890&quot;, where British possessions were authorized to create their own courts of admiralty jurisdiction. This was followed shortly with the passage of the &quot;Admiralty Act 1891&quot;, which consolidated such jurisdiction throughout Canada in the Exchequeur Court of Canada, which under the British Act could &quot;exercise such jurisdiction in like manner and to as full an extent as the High Court in England, and shall have the same regard as that Court to international law and the comity of nations.&quot;

The extent of this jurisdiction was held to be only that which existed on 1 July 1891, in an appeal decided in 1927 by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. This situation only changed after the &quot;Statute of Westminster 1931&quot; came into force, after which Canada passed the &quot;Admiralty Act 1934&quot;, which broadened Canadian admiralty jurisdiction to match that of the High Court of England at that time:


===Federal Court of Canada===
In 1971, the Federal Court of Canada was established, consisting of two divisions (the &quot;Federal Court – Trial Division&quot; and the &quot;Federal Court – Appeal Division&quot;), inheriting much of the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court. The Federal Court of Canada gained the jurisdiction to hear judicial reviews from federal agencies and tribunals. With respect to maritime jurisdiction, the Trial Division was declared to have:

On July 2, 2003, the Court was split into two separate Courts, with the &quot;Trial Division&quot; continued as the Federal Court and the &quot;Appeal Division&quot; continued as the Federal Court of Appeal.

Until 1976, there was substantial judicial support for the view that Parliament could give a federal court jurisdiction over any matter (even a matter not regulated by federal statute law), on the basis that &quot;the Laws of Canada&quot; meant not only federal statutes, but provincial ones as well. However, in &quot;Quebec North Shore Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific&quot;, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected this notion, as:

:* provincial law is not &quot;pro tanto&quot; federal law, nor can it be transposed into federal law for the purposes of giving jurisdiction to the Federal Court.
:* judicial jurisdiction of the Federal Court is not co-extensive with legislative jurisdiction of Parliament, as &quot;the Laws of Canada&quot; carries the requirement that there be applicable and existing federal law

==Organization==
The Court consisted of a first-level trial court, known as the Federal Court of Canada – Trial Division, and an appellate Court, known as the Federal Court of Canada – Appeal Division (more commonly referred to as the Federal Court of Appeal).

The Trial Division had jurisdiction to hear judicial review of decisions of federal boards and tribunals, including most immigration matters, as well as jurisdiction in admiralty, intellectual property, and disputes involving the federal government.

The Appeal Division had jurisdiction to hear appeals of decisions of the Trial Division, as well as to determine applications for judicial review of decisions made by specific boards and tribunals, set out in section 28 of the Federal Court Act. Decisions of the Appeal Division could be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, but only if leave (permission) was granted by either court.

The court did not use juries so all matters were decided by judge alone: a single judge in the Trial Division and a panel of three judges at the appeal level. Some pre-trial steps such as motions were decided by prothonotaries, a role similar to a master in other courts. The judges and prothonotaries were appointed by the Cabinet of the federal government.

==Jurisdiction==
Unlike the general courts set up by each province, matters could not be brought before the Federal Court of Canada unless a law explicitly allowed the proceeding. The docket of the court primarily consisted of judicial reviews of immigration, intellectual property, and federal employment disputes. The court could also deal with incidental aspects of a dispute that fell outside its jurisdiction if the primary dispute was within its jurisdiction.

The court was a national court so trials and hearings occurred throughout Canada. Any orders rendered by the court were enforceable in all the provinces and territories. This contrasts with the provincial superior courts which are organized by each province and require additional steps to enforce decisions in other provinces.

===Presidents of the Exchequer Court of Canada===

The position of President of the Court was not created until 1923. Before that time, justices of the Supreme Court of Canada sat as judges of the Exchequer Court from 1875 to 1887, at which time George Wheelock Burbidge was appointed as the first full-time judge of the Court. He served until 1908. when Walter Cassels was appointed. In 1912, authority was given to appoint an associate judge to the Court, and Louis Arthur Audette was appointed to that position. In 1945, authority was given to appoint more judges to the Court.

From 1923, the Presidents of the Court were:

* Sir Walter Gibson Pringle Cassels, 19201923
* Alexander Kenneth Maclean, 19231942
* Joseph Thorarinn Thorson, 19421964
* Wilbur Roy Jackett, 19641971 (subsequently Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Canada)

<doc id="896980" wikidata="Q552446" url="?curid=896980" title="Spittoon">
<text>A spittoon (or spitoon) is a receptacle made for spitting into, especially by users of chewing and dipping tobacco. It is also known as a cuspidor (which is the Portuguese word for &quot;spitter&quot; or &quot;spittoon&quot;, from the verb &quot;cuspir&quot; meaning &quot;to spit&quot;), although that term is also used for a type of spitting sink used in dentistry.

== United States in the 19th century==

In the late 19th century, spittoons became a common feature of pubs, brothels, saloons, hotels, stores, banks, railway carriages, and other places where people (especially adult men) gathered, notably in the United States, but allegedly also in Australia.

Brass was the most common material for spittoons. Other materials used for mass production of spittoons ranged from basic functional iron to elaborately crafted cut glass and fine porcelain. At higher class places like expensive hotels, spittoons could be elaborately decorated.

Spittoons are flat-bottomed, often weighted to minimize tipping over, and often with an interior &quot;lip&quot; to make spilling less likely if they tip. Some have lids, but this is rare. Some have holes, sometimes with a plug, to aid in draining and cleaning.

Use of spittoons was considered an advance of public manners and health, intended to replace previously common spitting on floors, streets, and sidewalks. Many places passed laws against spitting in public other than into a spittoon.

Boy Scout troops organized campaigns to paint &quot;Do not Spit on the Sidewalk&quot; notices on city sidewalks. In 1909 in Cincinnati, Ohio, scout troops together with members of the Anti-Tuberculosis League painted thousands of such messages in a single night. A mass-produced sign seen in saloons read:

Spittoons were also useful for people suffering from tuberculosis who would cough up phlegm. Public spittoons would sometimes contain a solution of an antiseptic such as carbolic acid with the aim of limiting transmission of disease. With the start of the 20th century medical doctors urged tuberculosis sufferers to use personal pocket spittoons instead of public ones; these were jars with tight lids which people could carry with them to spit into. Similar devices are still used by some with tuberculosis.

After the 1918 flu epidemic, both hygiene and etiquette advocates began to disparage public use of the spittoon, and use began to decline. Chewing gum replaced tobacco as the favorite chew of the younger generation. Cigarettes were considered more hygienic than spit-inducing chewing tobacco. While it was still not unusual to see spittoons in some public places in parts of the US as late as the 1930s, vast numbers of old brass spittoons met their ends in the scrap drives of World War II.

A large public collection of spittoons can be found at Duke Homestead State Historic Site Durham, North Carolina. In 2008, the site&#x27;s tobacco museum added 282 spittoons—claimed to be the world&#x27;s largest collection—to its holdings of over 100.

==In Chinese society==

Spittoons have been used in China for a long time; the earliest porcelain spittoon was found in a tomb dating to Emperor Xianzong&#x27;s reign during the Tang dynasty. During the Qing dynasty and later in Japan, a golden spittoon would be among the numerous objects displayed in front of the emperor at major ceremonies.

After China became a Communist state in 1949, the spittoon became much more prevalent: spittoons were placed at every conceivable public place, and were commonplace in homes as well. The mass introduction of spittoons was no doubt a public hygiene initiative, motivated by a desire to curtail the still common Chinese practice of spitting onto the floor. The spittoons used in China were typically made of white porcelain, sometimes with traditional Chinese art painted onto the exterior.

Spittoons were used even during official functions by the political leaders of China; especially when Deng Xiaoping had a frequent use of spittoon with other political leaders. This eventually became a source of ridicule by the mass media outside China. As a response, the spittoons have largely been withdrawn from public spaces in China since the late 1980s.

In May 2015, the Spittoon Collective came into being, probably the largest English-language literary collectives in China. They publish the Spittoon literary magazine.

While spittoons are still made, they are no longer commonly found in public places (except as decorations). There are a few companies that currently make spittoons for users of smokeless tobacco, such as MudJug, Spitbud, and Mud Bud by DC Crafts Nation. Professions in which spittoons are commonly used are coffee, tea and wine tasting. A taster will sip samples and then spit them into a spittoon in order to avoid intoxication. Makeshift spittoons, such as large mixing bowls, can be used by people with a cold who are frequently coughing up phlegm.

Spittoons remained in use in the Southern United States in public buildings at least until the 1970s. For example, the Georgia Capitol Museum in the Georgia Capitol Building in Atlanta, Georgia, has on display a spittoon of the type that was used in legislative sessions into the 1970s.

The United States Senate also has spittoons spread across the Senate Chamber as they are considered a Senate tradition. Similarly, each Justice on the United States Supreme Court has a spittoon next to his or her seat in the courtroom. However, the spittoons function merely as wastebaskets; the last time the spittoon was used for its customary purpose was in the early 20th century.

<doc id="896986" wikidata="Q339403" url="?curid=896986" title="Erik Per Sullivan">
<text>Erik Per Sullivan (born July 12, 1991) is an American former actor. He is best known for his role as Dewey on the Fox series &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;.

==Early life==
Sullivan was born on July 12, 1991, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the only child of his mother, Ann, born in Sweden and naturalized as a US citizen in 2007, and Fred Sullivan, of Irish descent, who owns a Mexican eatery called The Alamo. He speaks a little Swedish and his family visits Sweden almost every year. At a young age, he began studying piano and the saxophone. He has a first-degree black belt in Taekwondo.

Sullivan studied at the Mount Saint Charles Academy, in Rhode Island, and Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire. Beginning in 2009, he attended the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

==Career==
From January 9, 2000 to May 14, 2006, Sullivan played Malcolm&#x27;s younger brother Dewey in the Fox sitcom &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;. In 2005, along with &quot;Malcolm&quot; co-star Jane Kaczmarek, he wrote the afterword to the children&#x27;s book &quot;Together&quot;, which is about farming and was inspired by the nonprofit organization Heifer International.

Sullivan had a starring role in the 2004 movie &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot; and has played a variety of characters in film and on television, including the title role in the independent film &quot;Mo&quot; (2007), as well as voicing Sheldon the Seahorse in both the animated film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and its video game tie-in.

Sullivan&#x27;s last acting credit was an appearance in the 2010 film &quot;Twelve&quot; when he was 18 years old. He has since kept a low profile, and was absent from several &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; cast reunions.

<doc id="896988" wikidata="Q927434" url="?curid=896988" title="Drew Bledsoe">
<text>Drew McQueen Bledsoe (born February 14, 1972) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons, primarily with the New England Patriots. He played college football for Washington State Cougars, winning Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year as a junior, and was selected by the Patriots first overall in the 1993 NFL draft. Considered the face of the Patriots franchise during his nine seasons with the team, Bledsoe helped improve New England&#x27;s fortunes from 1993 to 2001. Under Bledsoe, the Patriots ended a seven-year postseason drought, qualified for the playoffs four times, clinched their division twice, and made a Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXXI. He was also named to three Pro Bowls and became the youngest quarterback to play in the NFL&#x27;s Pro Bowl game in 1995.

Following a period of declining success and two consecutive seasons in which the Patriots missed the playoffs, Bledsoe suffered a near-fatal injury early in the 2001 season that led to backup Tom Brady becoming the team&#x27;s starter. He was unable to regain his starting position for the remainder of the season due to Brady&#x27;s success, which led to the Patriots winning their first championship in Super Bowl XXXVI and began a dynasty for the franchise. He then spent three seasons with the Buffalo Bills, where he made a fourth Pro Bowl appearance, and his final two with the Dallas Cowboys.

While his tenure with the Patriots would be eclipsed by Brady, Bledsoe is recognized for helping rebuild the franchise and his role during their first Super Bowl-winning season when he relieved an injured Brady to help win the 2001 AFC Championship. For his accomplishments in New England, he was inducted to the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2011.

==Early life==
Bledsoe attended Walla Walla High School and was a letterman in football, basketball, and track. In football, he was named a first-team All-State selection by the &quot;Tacoma News Tribune&quot;. In track, he competed in the throwing events, recording top-throws of in the discus throw and in the javelin throw.

==College career==
Bledsoe spent his college career at Washington State University playing for the Cougars. After gaining the starting job at the end of the 1990 season as a true freshman (joined later by Jeff Tuel and Jayden de Laura as the only three in school history), he quickly became the face of the Cougars&#x27; offense. In 1992, Bledsoe led WSU to a 9–3 record (ranking #17 in the coaches poll and #15 in the AP) and a 31–28 win over Utah in the Copper Bowl in which Bledsoe completed 30 of 46 passes for 476 yards and two touchdowns. He also established WSU records in single-game passing yards (476), single-season pass completions (241), and single-season passing yards (3,246). He was named the Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year.

Following an impressive junior year in 1992, Bledsoe decided to forgo his senior season and enter the 1993 NFL draft. In the 34 starts of his collegiate career he amassed 7,373 yards, 532 completions, and 46 touchdowns.

Statistics
==Professional career==
===New England Patriots: 1993–2001===
Bledsoe was the first overall selection in the 1993 NFL draft, taken by the New England Patriots. He started right away for the Patriots in 1993, as they improved from two to five wins. As a rookie, he passed for 2,494 yards, 15 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions in 13 games.

On November 13, 1994, the Patriots had won just three of their first nine games and were losing, 20–3, to the Minnesota Vikings at halftime. Bledsoe led a comeback victory in which the Patriots won, 26–20, in overtime, as he set single-game records in pass completions (45) and attempts (70). The win sparked the beginning of a new age for the Patriots, as they rallied behind Bledsoe and won their final six games to finish with a 10–6 record and capture the wild card spot. Bledsoe passed for 4,555 yards, 25 touchdowns, and 27 interceptions. The Patriots lost to the Cleveland Browns (led by future Patriots head coach Bill Belichick) in the wild-card round 20–13. Due to his performance, Bledsoe was selected to his first Pro Bowl as an alternate.

In the 1995 season, Bledsoe passed for 3,507 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions as the Patriots went 6–10. Following the difficult 1995 season, Bledsoe turned it around in 1996, ranking among the top passers in the league with the help of wide receiver Terry Glenn, pushing the Patriots to reach the playoffs again and winning the AFC championship over the Jacksonville Jaguars, 20–6. This led to an appearance in Super Bowl XXXI, where they lost to the Green Bay Packers, 35–21. Bledsoe completed 25 of 48 passes for 253 yards, two touchdowns, and four interceptions in the loss. He was also named a starter for the Pro Bowl that season, the second of his career.

During the 1997 season, Bledsoe helped the Patriots win five of their final seven games to once again qualify for the playoffs, the fourth time in eight years as a Patriots starter he would lead the team to a postseason appearance. The Patriots lost in the Divisional Round to the Pittsburgh Steelers; however, Bledsoe built a career-high 87.7 passer rating, passed for 3,706 yards, tossed 28 touchdowns, and earned his third Pro Bowl invitation.

In 1998 he became the first NFL quarterback to complete game-winning touchdown passes in the final 30 seconds of two consecutive games. In doing so, he propelled New England into the postseason for the third straight year. He completed these come-from-behind efforts while playing with a broken index finger on his throwing hand, an injury that would later sideline him for the postseason.

Bledsoe started the 1999 season very strong, with 13 touchdowns and only four interceptions as the Patriots held a 6–2 midseason record. However, Bledsoe subsequently threw only six touchdowns and 17 interceptions, and the team finished with an 8–8 record, while Bledsoe was sacked a career-high 55 times. The team&#x27;s slide continued into the 2000 season as the Patriots ended with a 5–11 record. Bledsoe threw a then-career low thirteen interceptions that year but was sacked 45 times.

In March 2001, Bledsoe signed a then-record 10-year, $103 million contract. During the second game of the 2001 season on September 23, Bledsoe was racing toward the sideline on third-and-10 when New York Jets linebacker Mo Lewis leveled him with a hard, but clean hit. Bledsoe was about to dive for the first down marker, but defensive end Shaun Ellis clipped Bledsoe&#x27;s ankles as he was about to dive, resulting in Lewis hitting Bledsoe while he was standing straight up. With Bledsoe appearing to have suffered a concussion, backup Tom Brady came in to finish the game. After the game, team trainer Ron O&#x27;Neill suspected Bledsoe did not look right and asked him to come to the medical room for evaluation. Team doctor Bert Zarins ran some tests and discovered Bledsoe&#x27;s heart was racing. Zarins realized that this was something much more serious than a concussion; normally, concussed people have their heart rates tail off dramatically. Bledsoe was rushed to the hospital, where it was discovered that Lewis&#x27; hit sheared a blood vessel in his chest, causing a hemothorax that had him bleeding a pint of blood an hour.

Brady took the starting job and led New England to the playoffs. Bledsoe would never regain his starting role (Brady played 19 seasons in New England), although he proved integral to his team&#x27;s playoff run when he replaced an injury hobbled Brady in the AFC Championship Game against Pittsburgh. Bledsoe, starting from the Steelers&#x27; 40-yard line, capped a scoring drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to David Patten to give the Patriots a 14–3 lead, as well as all of the momentum going into halftime. With the Steelers trailing by four points in the fourth quarter, Bledsoe put together a 45-yard drive to put the Patriots in field goal range where Adam Vinatieri converted to make the score 24–17. Bledsoe later drove New England into Steelers territory to set up a 50-yard kick to seal the game, however Vinatieri missed and the ball went back to Pittsburgh. The Patriots defense held, and with a final score of 24–17 the upset was complete and the Patriots moved on to the Super Bowl. In winning the conference championship game, Bledsoe completed 10 of 21 passes for 102 yards, a touchdown, and no interceptions. It was the second time in six years (1996 and 2001) that Bledsoe was an integral part in leading the Patriots to a Super Bowl appearance, and during the on-field trophy presentation Bledsoe tossed his father a game ball. Brady started as quarterback as the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVI, with kicker Adam Vinatieri hitting a game-winning 48-yard field goal as time expired.

With Brady entrenched as the starter, Bledsoe was traded in the offseason to the Patriots&#x27; division rival, the Buffalo Bills. Patriots fans appreciated Bledsoe&#x27;s lengthy tenure and his role in improving the team, and cheered him in each of his three returns to New England as a visiting player.

===Buffalo Bills: 2002–2004===
Being sent to the Bills seemed to give Bledsoe a bit of rejuvenation in 2002. He had one of his best seasons ever, passing for 4,359 yards and 24 touchdowns and making his fourth trip to the Pro Bowl. In Week 2 against the Minnesota Vikings, Bledsoe set a team record with 463 yards passing in an overtime win. He led the Bills to an 8–8 record, which did not qualify for the postseason. He continued his strong play in 2003 as the Bills began the year 2–0. However, a flurry of injuries stymied the Bills offense; they failed to score a touchdown in three consecutive games en route to a 6–10 season. In 2004, they fell one game short of making the playoffs; a late season winning streak was wasted when Bledsoe and the Bills did poorly against the Pittsburgh Steelers backups in the season finale, finishing with a record of 9–7.

Bledsoe was released by the Bills after the 2004 season to make way for first-round draft pick J. P. Losman to become the starter. When Bledsoe later signed to the Dallas Cowboys, he expressed bitterness with the Bills for the move, stating &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to go home and dress my kids in little stars and get rid of the other team&#x27;s [Buffalo&#x27;s] stuff.&quot;

===Dallas Cowboys: 2005–2006===
Bledsoe went on to sign with the Dallas Cowboys, where he was reunited with former coach Bill Parcells and wide receiver Terry Glenn. Bledsoe was intended to be a long-term solution as quarterback for the Cowboys. Said Bledsoe on the day he signed with Dallas, &quot;Bill [Parcells] wants me here, and being the starter. I anticipate that being the case and not for one year.&quot; He signed for $23 million for three years.

During his tenure with the Cowboys, he threw for over 3,000 yards in a season for the ninth time in his career, tying Warren Moon for fourth in NFL history. That season, Bledsoe led five 4th-quarter/OT game-winning drives to keep the Cowboys&#x27; playoff hopes alive until the final day of the season. Though the team ultimately failed to reach the playoffs, Bledsoe led them to a 9–7 record, an improvement over the 6–10 mark that Vinny Testaverde had finished with in 2004.

However, in 2006, his final season with the Cowboys, Bledsoe&#x27;s play became erratic, so much so that six games into the season he was replaced by future Pro Bowler Tony Romo. Shortly after the end of the 2006 season, Bledsoe was released by the Cowboys. Unwilling to be relegated to a backup position, Bledsoe announced his retirement from the NFL on April 11, 2007.

===Retirement===
When Bledsoe retired in April 2007, he left fifth in NFL history in pass attempts (6,717) and completions (3,839), seventh in passing yards (44,611), and thirteenth in touchdown passes (251).

===Legacy===
On May 16, 2011, Bledsoe was voted by Patriots fans into the Patriots Hall of Fame. He was formally inducted in a public ceremony outside The Hall at Patriot Place on September 17, 2011. Bledsoe beat former head coach Bill Parcells and defensive lineman Houston Antwine in a fan vote.

In July 2012, Bledsoe was named the 30th-greatest quarterback of the NFL&#x27;s post-merger era by &quot;Football Nation&quot;.

In January 2018, Bledsoe was named honorary captain of the New England Patriots as they hosted the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game. Bledsoe&#x27;s Patriots had beaten the Jaguars 20–6 in the 1996 AFC Championship Game to advance to their second Super Bowl. Patriots owner Robert Kraft said in a statement &quot;Drew Bledsoe played such an integral role in our efforts to rebuild the Patriots. He gave fans hope for the future by providing many memorable moments during his record-breaking career. For a franchise that had only hosted one playoff game in its first 35 years, winning the AFC Championship Game at home in Foxborough and taking the Patriots to the playoffs for three consecutive years were unimaginable goals prior to his arrival.&quot; The Patriots defeated the Jaguars 24–20 to advance to their tenth Super Bowl appearance and Bledsoe presented the Lamar Hunt Trophy to Kraft.

==Personal life==
Bledsoe&#x27;s parents were schoolteachers in Ellensburg, Washington. His mother was a teacher at Lewis &amp; Clark Middle School, located in Yakima. His father was a coach who ran a football camp in Washington state, and Drew was able to interact with the professional players and coaches who helped his father run the camp. He is the fourth cousin once removed of actor Neal Bledsoe.

The Bledsoe family moved five times before Drew was in sixth grade. They finally settled in Walla Walla, where Bledsoe&#x27;s father coached football at the high school. The only time Drew played a whole season of football without ever starting at quarterback was in seventh grade at Pioneer Junior High. In high school, with his father as his coach, he won numerous awards, including selection to the Western 100 and Washington State Player of the Year. Heavily recruited by colleges such as Miami and Washington, he decided to attend Washington State, which was a two-hour drive from home.

Drew and his wife Maura live in Bend, Oregon, where Maura (née Healy) has family ties. They have four children: sons Stuart, John, Henry, and daughter Healy. He coached Stuart and John at Summit High School in Bend, where he served as offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach. John was a walk-on player on the Washington State football team in 2017.

While playing for the New England Patriots, Bledsoe lived in Bridgewater and Medfield Massachusetts; his Medfield house was later purchased by former Major League Baseball player Curt Schilling.

After his retirement in 2007, Bledsoe founded the Doubleback Winery along with close friend Chris Figgins. After the 2014 vintage, Figgins left Doubleback and handed his interest in the business to his protege Josh McDaniels (not related to the Patriots assistant coach of the same name). The company&#x27;s grapes, mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay, are harvested from McQueen Vineyards and Flying B Vineyards, located in and around Walla Walla, Washington. The wine saw some critical success and placed 53rd overall in &quot;Wine Spectator&quot; Top 100 wines in 2010. His first vintage, 2007, quickly sold out of its initial 600 cases. In 2012, &quot;Wine Spectator&#x27;s&quot; publisher Marvin R. Shanken invited Ernie Els, Greg Norman, Tom Seaver, and Bledsoe to introduce his wines, despite Shanken&#x27;s disdain for the New England Patriots. Bledsoe also recorded a message to both Tony Romo and Dak Prescott in 2017 in his home, which also showed his red wine collection.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Postseason===
==Accomplishments==

* His 4,452 pass attempts in his first eight seasons rank second to Brett Favre whose 4,456 attempts are the most by a quarterback during any eight-year period in NFL history.
* His 70 pass attempts in a single game is still an active league record.
* He passed for 3,291 yards in 2000, his seventh consecutive season with at least 3,000 yards passing.
* Bledsoe was durable during his career, playing in 126 of his first 132 games since entering the league in 1993, and never missing a start after leaving NE until benched in 2006.
* In 2002, his first season in Buffalo, he set single season records for yards, attempts, completions on an offense that had 7 other franchise records.
* In 1998, he directed the Patriots to the playoffs for the fourth time in six seasons.
* In 1994, he set Patriots franchise single-season passing records for attempts (691), completions (400), and yards passing (4,555; surpassed by Tom Brady in 2007).
* In 1995, he set a franchise record by attempting 179 consecutive passes without an interception (10/23/95 to 11/26/95; since surpassed by Tom Brady).
* At the age of 23, he became the youngest player in NFL history to surpass the 10,000-yard passing plateau when he connected with Ben Coates on a 6-yard completion just before the half vs. the Jets (12/10/95).
* Prior to 1994, the Patriots&#x27; single-season record for passing yards was 3,465 yards. Bledsoe eclipsed that mark six consecutive seasons.
* At the age of 22, he became the youngest quarterback in NFL history to play in the Pro Bowl.
* Led 31 career 4th-quarter or OT game-winning drives and holds the record for most TD passes in overtime with 4.

While Bledsoe has thrown for a high number of yards and attempts, a frequent criticism is that they are based on volume (attempts, completions, yards) rather than efficiency (passer rating, TD-to-INT ratio, yards per attempt) proving only that he has thrown a great number of times, not that he has thrown well. According to sports writer Don Banks, Bledsoe&#x27;s large career totals &quot;reveal more about his longevity than about his excellence&quot;.

Bledsoe ranks fifth all time in completions (3,839), seventh in passing yards (44,611), and thirteenth in touchdown passes (251). Bledsoe&#x27;s passer rating of 77.1 was 46th all-time in league history when he retired in 2006. As of 2022, he ranks 109th in league history. His 57.2% completion percentage is tied for 99th in league history. Bledsoe&#x27;s 37 regular season 300-yard passing games ranks ninth in league history. He also ranks sixth in most career regular-season 400-yard passing games by an NFL quarterback, having done it six times. He was selected to the Pro Bowl four times (in 1994, 1996, 1997, 2002). Bledsoe was eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011.

<doc id="896990" wikidata="Q2962435" url="?curid=896990" title="Ozark Trail (hiking trail)">
<text>The Ozark Trail is a hiking, backpacking, and, in many places, biking and equestrian trail under construction in the Missouri Ozarks in the United States. It is intended to reach from St. Louis to Arkansas. Over of the trail have been completed as of 2008, and the estimated length when finished will be at least . When joined to the Ozark Highlands Trail in Arkansas, the full hiking distance from end to end will be at least , not including a large loop through the St. Francois Mountains in Missouri.

== Description ==
The trail is currently composed of thirteen sections, most of which are joined to other sections, though some gaps exist. The sections vary in length from . The longest continuous stretch available for hiking in is , from Onondaga Cave State Park to the Eleven Point River. The exact routes for incomplete sections have not been established, so the total length of the trail when completed remains undetermined.

Some sections have restrictions on their use in order to be compatible with the goals and purposes of the various public and private landholders whose property the trail crosses. Horseback riding, mountain biking, or trail side camping may be restricted in certain environmentally sensitive areas.

== Development ==
The Ozark Trail had its beginnings in the 1970s when a group of public land managers, land owners, and trail users met to discuss the concept of a long-distance hiking trail. A comprehensive state outdoor recreation plan prepared by the state of Missouri in 1975 showed a need for an addition of of hiking trails. It was determined that a trail spanning the Ozarks from suburban St. Louis southwest to Arkansas could be routed over mostly existing public lands with a minimum amount of right-of-way needing to be obtained from private landowners. A first meeting in 1976 at Meramec State Park lead to the first draft of the trails proposal in February 1977 and in 1981 the first sections of the trail were under construction.
The general route of the Ozark Trail is determined by the Ozark Trail Council, which was formed by seven governmental agencies including the United States Forest Service, the Missouri State Parks Department, the Missouri Conservation Commission, &quot;et al.&quot;, plus several environmental groups and a private landowner with significant holdings. The land manager for each parcel held by these constituents is responsible for the trail within its holdings.

This unique decentralized arrangement is conducive to work progressing on many fronts at once and is partly responsible for the rapid initial progress in building the trail — 170 (275 km) miles within the first decade and over by 1991. In 2008, the mileage stands at over . As the route over contiguous public lands is completed further progress will likely be slowed by the arduous process of acquiring private land and easements.

Volunteers formed the Ozark Trail Association in 2002 to work with the Ozark Trail Council to develop and maintain the Ozark Trail. The Ozark Trail was designated a National Recreation Trail in 2008

== Damage ==

=== Taum Sauk reservoir failure ===
The upper reservoir of the Taum Sauk pumped storage plant failed in December 2005, causing a flood that devastated Johnson&#x27;s Shut-ins State Park and destroyed a part of the Taum Sauk section of the Ozark Trail at the shut-ins. The Ozark Trail Association and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources mapped out a new route to replace the damaged section, which was completed in mid-2009.

=== May 2009 storms ===
An unusually strong May 2009 windstorm devastated 44 miles of the trail within the Mark Twain National Forest, and all or parts of several sections of the Ozark Trail were closed because of downed trees. Within months several sections were repaired and reopened through the work of both volunteer and paid forest service crews.
 All access was eventually restored, though as of May, 2013, conditions on some sections of trail may be of concern to bikers or to those on horseback.

<text>Judith Chapman (born Judith Shepard on November 15, 1951) is an American actress, best known for soap opera roles, particularly as Natalie Bannon Hughes in &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (1975–1978), Charlotte Greer on &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; (1983), Ginny Blake Webber on &quot;General Hospital&quot; (1984–1986), Sandra Montaigne on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1987), Anjelica Deveraux on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; (1989–1991, 2018), and Gloria Abbott Bardwell on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (2005–2018, 2020–).

==Life and career==
Chapman was born in Greenville, South Carolina. She is the daughter of retired United States Air Force brigadier general Leland C. Shepard Jr. Her older sister Patty Shepard also worked as an actress. She debuted at the age of 16 in the Spaghetti Western &quot;Up the MacGregors!&quot; (1967). After getting a degree in theater from Stephens College, she headed to New York, where she joined the Actors Studio and began working in commercials and theater. In 1977, she made her American big screen debut in the psychological horror film &quot;False Face&quot;.

Chapman has appeared on several daytime dramas since the mid-1970s. Her first soap role was scheming Natalie Bannon (one of Tom Hughes&#x27; wives) on CBS soap &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from 1975 to 1978. She guest-starred on prime time series include &quot;Kojak &quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Galactica 1980&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, and two times on &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;. She had a recurring roles on &quot;Flamingo Road&quot; and &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;. In 1977, she tested for the role of Pam Ewing on CBS primetime soap opera, &quot;Dallas&quot;.

A four-month stint as the mysterious Charlotte Greer on &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; in 1983 brought Chapman critical acclaim. Her role had her character as part of a revenge plot against the Ryan family after lying to the press that she was Frank Ryan&#x27;s ex-wife. She joined the cast of &quot;General Hospital&quot; the following year as the devious Ginny Blake who was the biological mother of Mike Webber, adopted by Rick and Lesley. After Lesley&#x27;s &quot;death&quot;, Rick and Ginny married in an attempt to share custody and fell in love after Ginny was found to be the killer of D.L. Brock. She received Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Daytime Drama nomination for her performance. After that stint ended, she had a brief role on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as Sandra Montaigne, a con-artist out to scam ex-boyfriend Jonathan Russell. She was the third former &quot;General Hospital&quot; actress to play the role of Anjelica Devereaux Curtis on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, playing that part from 1989 to 1990 and briefly in 1991.

Chapman had supporting roles in films &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; (1988), &quot;Dead Space&quot; (1991), &quot;Fire on the Amazon&quot; (1993), &quot;Night of the Running Man&quot; (1995), &quot;28 Days&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot; (2002). She appeared in three episodes of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, and five times on &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot; as different characters. She starred in the LGBT comedy film &quot;Saugatuck Cures&quot; (2015), and in 2021 played Nancy Reagan in the biographical drama &quot;King Richard&quot;.

Chapman made her first appearance on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; after that, briefly subbing for Jess Walton as Jill Abbott. She joined the cast of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; full-time in January 2005, replacing Joan Van Ark in the contract role of Gloria Fisher. In March 2011, it was announced that Chapman had been taken off her contract and bumped to recurring. In October 2014, it was announced that she would make a guest appearance as Gloria on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. She appeared in a few more episodes of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in 2015 and 2016. She played Diana Cooper on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; for two months in 2019, then returned to Y&amp;R.

<text>Coolie Ranx (born Obiajula Ugbomah; 9 March 1965) is a British-American actor and singer best known for his membership in the third wave ska bands the Toasters and Pilfers. He is a long-time resident of New York City.

==Biography==
Ranx was born in London on 9 March 1965 and was raised in New York City. His mother is from Jamaica and his father is from Nigeria. He was discovered in 1990 when the lead singer and guitarist of the Toasters, Rob &quot;Bucket&quot; Hingley, heard Ranx&#x27;s dancehall reggae EP. Joining the Toasters in the early 1990s, he toured and recorded two albums with the band, including &quot;Dub 56&quot;, which features two songs he wrote.

After leaving the Toasters, Ranx co-founded a band called Pilfers. In Pilfers, he shared vocal duties with Vinny Nobile. Pilfers played a combination of third wave ska music, punk rock, and reggae that they called &quot;raggacore&quot;. After self-releasing their first album, the band signed to Mojo Records, who released the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Chawalaleng&quot;. He made frequent guest appearances on the albums of other third wave ska bands, such as Spring Heeled Jack, Metro Stylee and Mojo labelmates Reel Big Fish.

After a lineup change, which saw the replacement of the rhythm section, Pilfers disbanded in 2001. Ranx began a solo career, recording and playing shows around the world with Fear Nuttin&#x27; Band as his new backup band. In November 2005, he and the other four original members of Pilfers, reunited at the Knitting Factory in New York City for a sold-out performance.

Ranx provided the voice of Little Jacob in the 2008 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;.

<text>Sam Smith (born 1937) is an American journalist and political activist who was an early pioneer in alternative media. He was also involved in the establishment of the Green Party of the United States. Several times a week, Smith publishes an email news digest, &quot;Undernews&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Smith was born in Washington D.C. in 1937, into an Episcopalian and Quaker family. He grew up in Philadelphia, where he was educated in Quaker schools. Smith attended Harvard University, where he became news director of the college radio station, a drummer on the college dance circuit. He graduated in 1959.

==Career==
Following his graduation from Harvard University, Smith went to work in radio news in Washington, D.C. In 1961, Smith joined the United States Coast Guard, where he served three years as an officer.

In 1964, Smith returned to Washington, D.C., where he started an alternative monthly, &quot;The Idler&quot;. At the time, there were only a handful of such journals being published. 

In 1965, Smith, then working in radio, was offered a job as assistant to James Reston, the Washington correspondent of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and later was offered a position at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, which he turned down because he preferred to pursue alternative journalism. The following year, he took part in a day-long SNCC boycott of Washington D.C.&#x27;s transit buses, giving rides to boycotters with his car. After his article on the action appeared, Smith was visited by the local chair of SNCC who was seeking help with public relations. Thus began a long relationship with Marion Barry, who later became mayor of the city.

That same year, in 1966, Smith launched a community newspaper called the &quot;Capitol East Gazette&quot; to serve a largely poor, black neighborhood of Washington DC. Aided by a $2,000 grant from a local Lutheran church, the &quot;Gazette&quot; went on to cover such issues as plans to build a huge network of freeways in the city, the war on poverty, public education, neighborhood battles, and urban planning. Smith also became a vociferous advocate of statehood for the District of Columbia. In 1969, the paper was renamed the &quot;DC Gazette&quot; and became a citywide alternative newspaper. In subsequent years, contributors would include James Ridgeway, Jim Hightower, Eugene McCarthy, and Paul Krassner, and the publication became an articulate voice opposing the Vietnam War.

In 1974, Indiana University Press published Smith&#x27;s first book, &quot;Captive Capital: Colonial Life in Modern Washington&quot;. In 1980, he became a guest commentator on the local NPR radio station and Washington correspondent for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;.

In 1984, the &quot;Gazette&quot; was renamed &quot;Progressive Review&quot; and evolved into a bimonthly format. Smith&#x27;s articles on the savings and loan scandal, the problems of urban America, the first Gulf War, the Bush family, and scandals surrounding the Clintons were widely cited.

== National Green Party ==
In 1993, Indiana University Press published Smith&#x27;s book on Bill Clinton&#x27;s first year. Because of his opposition to Clinton and his work at reforming the liberal mainstay, Americans for Democratic Action, he was purged as a vice president of the organization. He then turned his energies to helping create a national Green Party and his home was an occasional gathering spot for Green organizers up until the founding of the party on November 17, 1996. In subsequent years, Smith found he was banned from the local NPR station as well as listed on &quot;de facto&quot; blacklists at C-SPAN and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; for what he believes was too aggressively pursuing the Clinton scandals.

In 1994, Smith started sending out email updates. The following year, he launched a website, prorev.com, which subsequently grew to be one of the most popular websites for progressive politics on the Net.

In 1997, &quot;Sam Smith&#x27;s Great American Political Repair Manual&quot; was published. His fourth book, &quot;Why Bother? Getting a Life in Locked Down Land&quot; appeared in 2001. In 2003, Smith wrote a 2000-word history of the Iraq War for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; lifted entirely from &quot;verbatim&quot; statements by Bush administration officials.

In 2004, Smith stopped publishing the &quot;Progressive Review&quot; in hard copy edition, continuing &quot;Undernews&quot; in email format with regular updates to his website. In its current form, &quot;Undernews&quot; consists of an entertaining and idiosyncratic selection of news excerpts from a wide variety of sources together with pithy commentaries by Smith himself.

<text>Eurocurrency is currency held on deposit outside its home market, i.e., held in banks located outside of the country which issues the currency. For example, a deposit of US dollars held in a bank in London, would be considered eurocurrency, as the US dollar is deposited outside of its home market.

The &quot;Euro-&quot; prefix does not refer exclusively to the &quot;euro&quot; currency or the &quot;eurozone&quot;, as the term predates the creation of the euro. Instead, it can be applied to any combination of deposits in a foreign bank outside of its home market e.g. a deposit denominated in Japanese yen held in a Swiss bank is a Euroyen deposit.

Eurocurrency is used for short-to-medium term financing by banks, multinational corporations, mutual funds, and hedge funds. Eurocurrency is generally seen as an attractive source of global funding due to its ease of convertibility between currencies as well as typically lower regulatory measures compared to sources of funding in domestic markets. Eurocurrency and eurobond markets avoid domestic interest rate regulations, reserve requirements and other barriers to the free flow of capital.

The relevance of eurocurrency deposits has been disputed ever since its inception in the 1950s by notable economists including Ronald McKinnon, yet it remains a prevalent aspect of the global financial system.

== History ==

=== Background Information ===
The emergence of Eurocurrency is closely tied to the origins of the Eurodollar as it was the first type of Eurocurrency. Eurodollars began from large quantities of US dollar-denominated deposits being held in European, namely London, banks during the 1950s. Over several decades, economists have produced several explanations of how eurocurrency came about, why it occurred in London, and how London managed to maintain a competitive advantage in the market as eurocurrency expanded globally. Environmental and political factors commonly underpin most theories, influencing the decisions of nations during this period known as the Bretton Woods Era.

The Bretton Woods Era spanned from 1944 to 1973 and saw national policymakers, notably those of Britain and the US, agree to a fixed or pegged exchange rate system. Under this system, national currencies were &quot;pegged&quot; against the US dollar which itself was now convertible into gold. This was done to promote freer world trade in response to a sharp decline in imports and exports after the 1930s financial crises and World War 2 (WW2). As a result, national governments had raised their barriers to trade in an attempt to boost their domestic performance, causing major declines in world trade.

=== Drivers of Eurocurrency in the 1950s ===
By mid-1955, US and foreign businesses and nations were regularly using Eurodollars to hold US-dollar balances or obtain US-dollar denominated loans outside of the US. The eurocurrency market was birthed organically from the rise of the Eurodollar. Ultimately, there was multiple causes for the rise of the Eurodollar which lead to the creation of Eurocurrency.

Firstly, large holdings of US dollars entered Europe shortly after WW2. This was a result of the fixed exchange rate system that lead to more countries using US dollars for trade, as well as increased imports into the US itself from Europe. Moreover, the US provided economic aid to European nations after WW2 in the form of damage assistance under the US governments&#x27; Marshall Plan. Secondly, after WW2 communist governments including the Soviet Union and China transferred their holdings held in the US over to European banks. This is believed to have been done for two primary reasons; (1) over fears that US authorities will seize their assets, and (2) to accumulated goodwill with Eurobanks as a strategy to nurture a future source of loans and funding. Thirdly, the 1957 sterling crises forced the UK&#x27;s strongest movement toward alignment with the Bretton Woods plan. Here, the Bank of England banned sterling-financed trade for non-sterling countries as a result of a sharp increase in the bank rate to 7%, compelling London-based banks to join the rest of the world and use dollars for trade. This alongside the demand for other types of eurocurrencies outside of their home markets lead to the innovation of the eurocurrency market.

=== Competitive Advantage of London ===
The inception of eurocurrency occurred in London with the introduction of the Eurodollar in 1955. Even after eurocurrency had expanded globally however, London maintained its position as the centre of the Eurodollar market which is still true of today.

Economists provide disputed explanations for why London was able to gain and maintain this competitive advantage. Ronald McKinnon theorised that it was attributed to London&#x27;s pre-existing foreign financing expertise retained from Britain&#x27;s dominant trade history in the 19th Century and servings as the centre of the sterling when it was a major international currency. However, criticisms of this theory deemed it &quot;rather static and deterministic&quot; and lacking any archival evidence. McKinnon also emphasised the regulatory freedom provided to commercial banks in London by the Bank of England, aligning with recounts of the Treasury questioning whether financial institutions in London had excessive influence on decisions made by the Bank of England. Nonetheless, both the Treasury and Bank of England agreed that London should remain an important financial centre even after the sterling was no longer a major international currency. Therefore, imposing restrictive regulations would have been counterintuitive, leading to London&#x27;s permissive environment. In reality, eurocurrency market centres in general enjoyed freedom from supply side restrictions such as reserve requirements and interest rate ceilings which allowed them, in particular London, to gain a competitive advantage by providing high and low rates of interest according to the class of the borrower and lender. Additionally, London&#x27;s competitive advantage was enhanced by tight restrictions throughout the rest of Europe due to possible risks of &quot;hot money&quot;, increased bank liquidity, and potential reliance on reserves in the case of bank runs.

==Currencies==
The four main Eurocurrencies are the US dollar, the Euro, the sterling and the Japanese yen; the currencies of the major economies of the world.

=== Eurocurrency Markets ===
A eurocurrency market is the money market for any currency deposited outside of its home market. The key participants in these markets includes banks, multinational corporations, mutual funds, and hedge funds. Eurocurrency markets are generally chosen as a source of finance over domestic banks for their ability to offer lower interest rates of borrowers and higher interest rates for lenders situationally. This because eurocurrency market have less regulatory requirements, tax laws, and typically no interest caps. Nonetheless, there are higher risks, particularly when banks experience periods of poor solvency which can lead to a run on the banks.

There are several eurocurrency markets, with the two most widely used being the Eurodollar market and the Euroyen market. There are also various smaller eurocurrency markets including the Euroeuro market and the Europound market.

==== Eurodollar Market ====
The Eurodollar market involves holdings of US dollars outside of the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve System, the US central bank. These holdings may arise via two primary ways. Firstly, from purchases of goods and services made in US dollars to suppliers who maintain European bank accounts - these suppliers may be European or non-European. Secondly, Eurodollar deposits arise from investments of US dollars in European banks, generally for more favourable returns on interest.

Today, the Eurodollar market is the largest source of global funding for businesses and nations, estimated to be financing over 90% of international trade deals. It is the most widely used eurocurrency. Accounting for approximately 75% of all eurocurrency accounts held worldwide. This prevalence is often attributed to economic and political factors. Firstly, the economic power of the US, particularly its influential position in the world economy and steady deterioration of the other currencies during the inception of Eurocurrency in the 1950s. Secondly, the lack of interest caps and limited regulation in the Eurodollar market enables favourable rates of interest for both lenders and borrowers.

==== Euroyen Market ====
The Euroyen market involves deposits of yen in banks outside the jurisdiction of the Bank of Japan, the Japanese central bank. The market emerged in 1984, at the beginning of the Japanese asset price bubble that saw Japan pursue financial liberalisation and internalisation. During the 1990s, interest rates in Japan experienced substantial declines, making the relatively high rates of interest paid by Euroyen accounts attractive investments. Today Euroyen deposits are used by non-Japanese companies to efficiently obtain investments from Japanese investors. Euroyen bonds allow foreign companies to avoid the regulations enforced by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and in bond registration with the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE).

==== Euroeuro Market ====
The Euroeuro market involves deposits of euros outside of the jurisdiction of the European Central Bank.

==== Europound Market ====
The Europound market involves sterling deposits outside of the jurisdiction of the Bank of England.

== Eurocurrency Network ==
The concept of eurocurrency can have two implications.

Firstly, it can be the accumulation of all the currencies and banking facilities worldwide that are participating of the offshore banking network. This is not limited to the four eurocurrencies (US dollar, euro, yen, sterling) or the home markets of those eurocurrencies. For example, a bank in Denmark that chooses to keep holdings of Swiss franc in London would also be considered a part of the eurocurrency network.

Secondly, it can refer to the sum of all the technologies i.e. data processing and communication lines, used to enable stakeholders around the world to interact and participate in the eurocurrency market. Eurocurrency marks function within the global financial system with market centres spread across the global. Therefore, powerful financial technologies and information systems are required to connect market centres to enable communications and transactions to occur. For example, technologies such as high-speed communication lines link market centres enabling fast eurobanking transactions, and also giving rise to the overnight market.

== Regulations and Domestic Policy ==

=== Regulatory History ===
In the 1970s, regulating the eurocurrency market became a key priority for policymakers globally. This was because the growth of Eurodollars forced domestic banks to participate in offshore banking in order to stay competitive against rapidly growing foreign banks. Offshore banking allowed domestic banks to avoid the rising costs and restrictions resulting from national banking regulations. National governments struggled to monitor money supply and accurately predict economic outcomes in the global financial system due to unregulated and regulated financial markets existing in parallel. Since this realisation, governments have attempted various regulatory measures such as imposing reserve requirements, ceilings on interest rates and extending supervisory authority into the unregulated eurocurrency market. Overall, critics today maintain that regulation in offshore banking as a whole remains largely insufficient.

==== Usage of Reserve Requirements ====
Reserve requirements refer to a particular predetermined amount of cash which banks must have on-hand for the purpose of meeting liabilities in the case of sudden withdrawals. In the case of eurocurrency, this is a crucial regulatory measure with the high risk of bank runs. Typically, the central banks of individual nations enforce reserve requirements for its commercial banks. For example, the US central bank - The Federal Reserve, requires commercial banks to retain money in reserves against their commitments to depositors under the Monetary Control Act 1980. However, little progress has been made in imposing reserve requirements on eurocurrency deposits as nations continually fail to reach consensus over eurocurrency reserve amounts. Thus, it is the extension of national reserve requirements to the eurocurrency markets that has some level of mitigation between eurocurrency deposits and domestic bank balances.

=== Eurocurrency and Interest Rates ===
A key attraction for eurocurrency deposits are favourable interest rates for both lenders and borrowers relative to domestic interest rates. However, studies including the Granger causality test show that the “stickiness” of eurocurrency interest rates only exists with respect to the Eurodollar market. Interest rates for other eurocurrencies often move in parallel with corresponding domestic interest rates, seen as a control used by national governments to limit international capital flows.

==Eurobanks==

A eurobank is a financial institution anywhere in the world which accepts deposits or makes loans in any foreign currency.

==Eurocredits==
Eurocredit is a loan whose denominated currency is not the lending bank&#x27;s national currency. A eurocredit loan would be made by a U.S. bank to a lender requiring a denominated currency which differs from the bank&#x27;s local currency (USD) for specific reasons, most likely some sort of business operations or trade requirements. Despite the inclusion of the word &quot;euro,&quot; a eurocredit is not immediately derived from the euro.

Eurocredits are short- to medium-term loans of Eurocurrency extended by Eurobanks to corporations, sovereign governments, nonprime banks, or international organizations. The loans are denominated in currencies other than the home currency of the Eurobank. Because these loans are frequently too large for a single bank to handle, Eurobanks will band together to form a bank lending syndicate to share the risk.
The credit risk on these loans is greater than on loans to other banks in the interbank market. Thus, the interest rate on Eurocredits must compensate the bank, or banking syndicate, for the added credit risk. On Eurocredits originating in London the base lending rate is LIBOR. The lending rate on these credits is stated as LIBOR +X percent, where X is the lending margin charged depending upon the creditworthiness of the borrower. Additionally, rollover pricing was created on Eurocredits so that Eurobanks do not end up paying more on Eurocurrency time deposits than they earn from the loans. Thus, a Eurocredit may be viewed as a series of short-term loans, where at the end of each time period (generally three or six months), the loan is rolled over and the base lending rate is repriced to current LIBOR over the next time interval of the loan.

<doc id="897047" wikidata="Q132172" url="?curid=897047" title="Arc-fault circuit interrupter">
<text>An arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) or arc-fault detection device (AFDD) is a circuit breaker that breaks the circuit when it detects the electric arcs that are a signature of loose connections in home wiring. Loose connections, which can develop over time, can sometimes become hot enough to ignite house fires. An AFCI selectively distinguishes between a harmless arc (incidental to normal operation of switches, plugs, and brushed motors), and a potentially dangerous arc (that can occur, for example, in a lamp cord which has a broken conductor).

In Canada and the United States, AFCI breakers have been required by the electrical codes for circuits feeding electrical outlets in residential bedrooms since the beginning of the 21st century; the US &quot;National Electrical Code&quot; has required them to protect most residential outlets since 2014, and the &quot;Canadian Electrical Code&quot; has since 2015.

In regions using 230 V, the combination of higher voltage and lower load currents lead to different conditions being required to initiate an arc fault that does not either burn clear or weld to a short circuit after a short time, and there are different arc characteristics once struck. Because of this, in Western Europe (where in many countries a domestic supply may be 400V 3 phase) and the UK (where domestically a single phase 230V supply is common), adoption is slower, and their use is optional, only being mandated in specified high risk locations. The Australian and New Zealand regulations – Wiring Rules (AS NZS 3000:2018) do not require installation of AFDDs in Australia. However, in New Zealand all final sub-circuits with ratings up to 20 A will require protection by an AFDD if they supply locations with significant fire risk, locations containing irreplaceable items, certain historic buildings, and socket-outlets in school sleeping accommodation. Most sockets in these countries are on circuits rated at 20 A or less.

In the US, arc faults are said to be one of the leading causes for residential electrical fires. Each year in the United States, over 40,000 fires are attributed to home electrical wiring. These fires result in over 350 deaths and over 1,400 injuries each year.

Conventional circuit breakers respond only to overloads and short circuits, so they do not protect against arcing conditions that produce erratic, and often reduced current. AFCIs are devices designed to protect against fires caused by arcing faults in the home electrical wiring. The AFCI circuitry continuously monitors the current and discriminates between normal and unwanted arcing conditions. Once detected, the AFCI opens its internal contacts, thus de-energizing the circuit and reducing the potential for a fire to occur.

==Operating principle==
The electronics inside an AFCI breaker detect electrical current alternating at characteristic frequencies, usually around 100 kHz, known to be associated with wire arcing, which are sustained for more than a few milliseconds. A &quot;combination AFCI breaker&quot; provides protection against parallel arcing (line to neutral), series arcing (a loose, broken, or otherwise high resistance segment in a single line), ground arcing (from line or neutral to ground), overload, and short circuit. The AFCI will open the circuit if dangerous arcing is detected.

When installed as the first outlet on a branch circuit, AFCI receptacles provide series arc protection for the entire branch circuit. They also provide parallel arc protection for the branch circuit starting at the AFCI receptacle. Unlike AFCI breakers, AFCI receptacles may be used on any wiring system regardless of the panel.

==Electrical code requirements==
===US and Canada===

Starting with the 1999 version of the &quot;National Electrical Code&quot; in the United States, and the 2002 version of the &quot;Canadian Electrical Code&quot; in Canada, the national codes require AFCIs in all circuits that feed outlets in bedrooms of dwelling units. As of the 2014 NEC, AFCI protection is required on all branch circuits supplying outlets or devices installed in dwelling unit kitchens, along with the 2008 NEC additions of family rooms, dining rooms, living rooms, parlors, libraries, dens, bedrooms, sunrooms, recreation rooms, closets, hallways, laundry areas, and similar rooms and areas. They are also required in dormitory units. This requirement may be accomplished by using a &quot;combination type&quot; breaker—a specific kind of circuit-breaker defined by UL 1699—in the breaker panel that provides combined arc-fault and overcurrent protection or by using an AFCI receptacle for modifications/extensions, as replacement receptacles or in new construction, at the first outlet on the branch. Not all U.S. jurisdictions have adopted the NEC&#x27;s AFCI requirements so it is important to check local code requirements.

The AFCI is intended to prevent fire from arcs. AFCI circuit breakers are designed to meet one of two standards as specified by UL 1699: &quot;branch&quot; type or &quot;combination&quot; type (note: the Canadian Electrical Code uses different terminology but similar technical requirements). A branch type AFCI trips on 75 amperes of arcing current from the line wire to either the neutral or ground wire. A combination type adds series arcing detection to branch type performance. Combination type AFCIs trip on 5 amperes of series arcing.

AFCI receptacles are an alternative solution to AFCI breakers. These receptacles are designed to address the dangers associated with both types of potentially hazardous arcing: parallel and series. AFCI receptacles offer the benefit of localized &quot;test&quot; and &quot;reset&quot; with such buttons located on the face of the device. This can save a journey to the breaker panel but can also encourage simply resetting by a user without investigating the underlying fault, as would presumably happen if someone with access to the electrical panel was notified.

In 2002, the NEC removed the word &quot;receptacle&quot;, leaving &quot;outlets&quot;, with the effect that lights and other wired-in devices such as ceiling fans within bedrooms were added to the requirement. The 2005 code made it clearer that all outlets must be protected despite discussion in the code-making panel about excluding bedroom smoke detectors from the requirement. &quot;Outlets&quot; as defined in the NEC includes receptacles, light fixtures and smoke alarms, among other things. Basically, any point where AC electricity is used to power something is an outlet.

As of January 2008, only &quot;combination type&quot; AFCIs meet the NEC requirement. The 2008 NEC requires the installation of combination-type AFCIs in all 15 and 20 ampere residential circuits with the exception of laundries, kitchens, bathrooms, garages, and unfinished basements, though many of these require GFCI protection. The 2014 NEC adds kitchens and laundry rooms to the list of rooms requiring AFCI circuitry, as well as any devices (such as lighting) requiring protection.

As of January 2023, there are a total of 6 means of protection covered as part of 210.12(A). These include the following:

1. A listed combination-type AFCI which is the primary method used to meet these requirements.

2. A listed branch/feeder-type AFCI that is installed at the origin of the branch circuit working in combination with the listed outlet branch-circuit-type AFCI (OBC AFCI) installed at the first outlet box which must also be marked that it is the first outlet box of the branch circuit.

3. This option includes a listed &quot;Supplemental Arc Protection Circuit Breaker&quot; which does not exist. There is no standard for this device and so this is not an option that can be used.

4. This option does have a single manufacturer who has a solution on the market. This option includes a listed outlet branch-circuit-type AFCI that is installed on the branch circuit at the first outlet in combination with a listed branch-circuit overcurrent protective device when the following four conditions are met:
(a) The &quot;Home Run&quot; circuit must be continuous from the branch circuit overcurrent device to the OBC AFCI.
(b) Maximum length for a 14 AWG conductor is 50 ft and the maximum length for a 12 AWG conductor is 70ft.
(c) The first outlet box has to be marked as such.
(d) The circuit breaker and the OBC AFCI must be listed to meet the requirements of a system combination-type AFCI.

Options 5 and 6 are the same options as we&#x27;ve seen in this section in the past but just included as positive text instead of being an exception.

These options are required for the following areas in dwelling units:

(1) Kitchens

(2) Family rooms

(3) Dining rooms

(4) Living rooms

(5) Parlors

(6) Libraries

(7) Dens

(8) Bedrooms

(9) Sunrooms

(10) Recreation rooms

(11) Closets

(12) Hallways

(13) Laundry areas

(14) Similar areas

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the Wiring Regulations 18th edition (BS 7671:2018) is the first edition to make any mention of arc fault devices, and indicate they may be installed if the design has an unusually high risk of fire from arc faults. The annexes relating to testing indicate that when AFDDs are installed, their correct operation must be verified before completion, but the method of testing is not described. This is in contrast to RCDs where a number of trip times at different fault current levels must be verified.
===Germany===
The German Wiring rules VDE 0100, recommend AFDDs for high-risk situations and give as examples rooms with sleeping accommodation, rooms or places with a particular fire risk, rooms or places made of building components with combustible building materials, if these have a lower fire resistance than fire-retardant (&lt; F30), and rooms or places with hazards for irreplaceable goods.

===Australia and New Zealand ===
The Australian and New Zealand regulations – Wiring Rules (AS NZS 3000:2018) do not require installation of AFDDs in Australia. However, in New Zealand all final sub-circuits with ratings up to 20 A will require protection by an AFDD if they supply locations with significant fire risk, locations containing irreplaceable items, certain historic buildings, and socket-outlets in school sleeping accommodation. Most power circuits in these countries fall under this clause as the common sockets are 10 A and 15 A rating. The Australian standards are used in Argentina, Fiji, Tonga, Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea.

==Limitations==
AFCIs are designed to protect against fires caused by electrical arc faults. While the sensitivity of the AFCIs helps in the detection of arc faults, these breakers can also indicate false positives by identifying normal circuit behaviors as arc faults. For instance, lightning strikes provide voltage and current profiles that resemble arc faults, and vacuum cleaners and some laser printers trip AFCIs. This nuisance tripping reduces the overall effectiveness of AFCIs. Research into advancements in this area is being pursued.

AFCIs are also known to be sensitive (false tripping) to the presence of radio frequency energy, especially within the so-called &quot;high frequency&quot; (HF) spectrum (3–30 MHz), which includes legitimate shortwave broadcasting, over-the-horizon aircraft and marine communications, amateur radio, and citizens band radio operations. Sensitivities and mitigation have been known since 2013.

AFCI circuit breakers include a standard inverse-time circuit breaker but provide no specific protection against &quot;glowing&quot; connections (also known as a high resistance connection), high line voltages, or low line voltages.

An AFCI does not detect high line voltage caused by an open neutral in a multiwire branch circuit. A multiwire branch circuit uses both energized wires of a 120–240 V split phase service. If the neutral is broken along the return path to the circuit breaker panel, devices connected from a 120 V leg to the neutral may experience excess voltage, up to twice normal.

AFCIs do not detect low line voltage. Low line voltage can cause electromechanical relays to repeatedly turn off and on, or &quot;chatter&quot;. If current is flowing through the load contacts, it causes arcing across the contacts as they open. The arcing can oxidize, pit, and melt the contacts. This process can increase the contact resistance, superheat the relay, and lead to fires. Power fault circuit interrupters are designed to prevent fires from low voltage across loads.

==Interference with power line networking==
AFCIs may interfere with the operation of some power line communication technologies.

<doc id="897049" wikidata="Q442207" url="?curid=897049" title="Gillian Welch">
<text>Gillian Howard Welch (; born October 2, 1967) is an American singer-songwriter. She performs with her musical partner, guitarist David Rawlings. Their sparse and dark musical style, which combines elements of Appalachian music, bluegrass, country and Americana, is described by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as &quot;at once innovative and obliquely reminiscent of past rural forms.&quot;

Welch and Rawlings have collaborated on nine critically acclaimed albums, five released under her name, three released under Rawlings&#x27; name, and two under both of their names. Her 1996 debut, &quot;Revival&quot;, and the 2001 release &quot;Time (The Revelator)&quot;, received nominations for the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Her 2003 album, &quot;Soul Journey&quot;, introduced electric guitar, drums, and a more upbeat sound to their body of work. After a gap of eight years, she released a fifth studio album, &quot;The Harrow &amp; the Harvest&quot;, in 2011, which was also nominated for a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album. In 2020, Welch and Rawlings released &quot;All the Good Times (Are Past &amp; Gone)&quot;, which won the 2021 Grammy Award for Best Folk Album. In 2024, Welch and Rawlings released &quot;Woodland&quot;, which would win the 2025 Grammy Award for Best Folk Album, currently making Welch and Rawlings the only duo to win the award more than once. 

Welch was an associate producer and performed on two songs of the soundtrack of the Coen brothers 2000 film &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, a platinum album that won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2002. She also appeared in the film attempting to buy a Soggy Bottom Boys record. Welch, while not one of the principal actors, did sing and provide additional lyrics to the Sirens song &quot;Didn&#x27;t Leave Nobody but the Baby.&quot; In 2018 she and Rawlings wrote the song &quot;When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings&quot; for the Coens&#x27; &quot;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs&quot;, for which they received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

==Early life==
Welch was born on October 2, 1967, in New York City, and was adopted by Mitzie Welch (née Marilyn Cottle) and Ken Welch, comedy and music entertainers. Her biological mother was a freshman in college, and her father was a musician visiting New York City. Welch has speculated that her biological father could have been one of her favorite musicians, and she later discovered from her adoptive parents that he was a drummer. Alec Wilkinson of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; stated that &quot;from an address they had been given, it appeared that her mother ... may have grown up in the mountains of North Carolina&quot;. When Welch was three, her adoptive parents moved to Los Angeles to write music for &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. They also appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

As a child, Welch was introduced to the music of American folk singers Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, and the Carter Family. She performed folk songs with her peers at the Westland Elementary School in Los Angeles. Welch later attended Crossroads School, a high school in Santa Monica, California. While in high school, a local television program featured her as a student who &quot;excelled at everything she did.&quot;

While a student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Welch played bass in a goth band, and drums in a psychedelic surf band. In college, a roommate played an album by the bluegrass band The Stanley Brothers, and she had an epiphany:

The first song came on and I just stood up and I kind of walked into the other room as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo. It was just as powerful as the electric stuff, and it was songs I&#x27;d grown up singing. All of a sudden I&#x27;d found my music.

After graduating from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in photography, Welch attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, where she majored in songwriting. During her two years studying at Berklee, Welch gained confidence as a performer. Welch met her music partner David Rawlings at a successful audition for Berklee&#x27;s only country band.

==Career==

Upon finishing college in 1992, Welch moved to Nashville, Tennessee. She recalled, &quot;I looked at my record collection and saw that all the music I loved had been made in Nashville—Bill Monroe, Dylan, the Stanley Brothers, Neil Young—so I moved there. Not ever thinking I was thirty years too late.&quot; Rawlings soon followed. In Nashville, after singing &quot;Long Black Veil,&quot; the two first realized that their voices harmonized well and they started to perform as a duo. They never considered using a working name, so the duo were simply billed as &quot;Gillian Welch.&quot; A year after moving to Nashville, Welch found a manager, Denise Stiff, who already managed Alison Krauss. Both Welch and Stiff ignored frequent advice that Welch should stop playing with Rawlings and join a band. They eventually signed a recording contract with Almo Sounds. Following a performance opening for Peter Rowan at the Station Inn, producer T-Bone Burnett expressed interest in recording an album. Burnett did not plan to disturb Welch&#x27;s and Rawlings&#x27; preference for minimal instrumentation, and Welch agreed to take him on as a producer.

===&quot;Revival&quot;===
For the recording sessions of Welch&#x27;s debut, &quot;Revival&quot;, Burnett wanted to recapture the bare sound of Welch&#x27;s live performance. Welch recalled, &quot;That first week was really intense. It was just T-Bone, the engineer, and Dave and myself. We got so inside our little world. There was very little distance between our singing and playing. The sound was very immediate. It was so light and small.&quot; Later, they recorded several more songs and played with an expanded group of musicians: guitarist and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee James Burton, bassist Roy Huskey, Jr., and veteran session drummers Jim Keltner and Buddy Harman.

The album was released in April 1996 to mostly positive reviews. Mark Deming of Allmusic called it a &quot;superb debut&quot; and wrote, &quot;Welch&#x27;s debts to artists of the past are obvious and clearly acknowledged, but there&#x27;s a maturity, intelligence, and keen eye for detail in her songs you wouldn&#x27;t expect from someone simply trying to ape the Carter Family.&quot; Bill Friskics-Warren of &quot;No Depression&quot; praised the album as &quot;breathtakingly austere evocations of rural culture.&quot; The Arlington Heights, Illinois &quot;Daily Herald&quot;″s Mark Guarino observed that &quot;Revival&quot; was &quot;cheered and scrutinized as a staunch revivalist of Depression-era music only because her originals sounded so much like that era.&quot; He attributed this to the biblical imagery of the lyrics, Burnett&#x27;s threadbare production, and the plainly-sung bleakness in Welch&#x27;s vocals. Ann Powers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave &quot;Revival&quot; a lukewarm review and criticized Welch for not singing of her own experiences, and &quot;manufacturing emotion.&quot; Robert Christgau echoed Powers: Welch &quot;just doesn&#x27;t have the voice, eye, or way with words to bring her simulation off.&quot;

The song, &quot;Orphan Girl,&quot; from &quot;Revival&quot; has been covered by Emmylou Harris, Ann Wilson, Karin Bergquist of Over the Rhine, Mindy Smith, Patty Griffin, Linda Ronstadt, Tim &amp; Mollie O&#x27;Brien and Holly Williams.

Others who have recorded Welch&#x27;s songs include Joan Baez, Grace Porter, Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile, Punch Brothers, Mike Gordon, Bright Eyes, Calexico, Ani DiFranco, The Decemberists, Karl Blau, Jim James, and JD Pinkus.

&quot;Revival&quot; was nominated for the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, but lost to Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad.&quot;

===&quot;Hell Among the Yearlings&quot;===
The duo&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Hell Among the Yearlings&quot; continued the rustic and dark themes; the songs&#x27; subject matter varies from a female character killing a rapist, a mining accident, a murder ballad, and an ode to morphine before death. Like &quot;Revival&quot;, &quot;Hell Among The Yearlings&quot; featured a sparse style that focused on Rawlings and Welch&#x27;s voices and guitars.
The album also received favorable reviews. Robert Wilonsky of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; observed that Welch &quot;inhabits a role so completely, the fiction separating character and audience disappears&quot;. Thom Owens (Allmusic) stated that the album &quot;lacks some of the focus&quot; of &quot;Revival&quot;, but is &quot;a thoroughly satisfying second album&quot; and proof that her debut was not a fluke. &quot;No Depression&quot;&#x27;s Farnum Brown commended the live and &quot;immediate feel&quot; of the album, Welch&#x27;s clawhammer banjo, and Rawlings&#x27; harmonies. Similar to &quot;Revival&quot;, Welch was praised for reflecting influences such as the Stanley Brothers, but still managing to create an original sound, while Chris Herrington from Minneapolis&#x27;s &quot;City Pages&quot; criticized the songs&#x27; lack of authenticity. He wrote &quot;Welch doesn&#x27;t write folk songs; she writes folk songs about writing folk songs.&quot;

===&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;===

Welch sang two songs and served as the associate producer for the Burnett-produced soundtrack to the 2000 film of the same name. She shared vocals with Alison Krauss on a rendition of the gospel song &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away.&quot; Dave McKenna of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised their version: the singers &quot;soar together.&quot; Burnett and Welch wrote additional lyrics for the song &quot;Didn&#x27;t Leave Nobody but the Baby,&quot; sung by Welch, Emmylou Harris, and Krauss. The song is an elaboration of an old Mississippi tune discovered by Alan Lomax, and was nominated for the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. The platinum album won the 2002 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The surprise success of the soundtrack gave Welch a career boost. Welch also made a cameo appearance in the film.

===&quot;Time (The Revelator)&quot;===
When Universal Music Group purchased Almo Sounds, Welch began her own independent label, Acony Records (named for the Appalachian wildflower, Acony Bell, subject of the song of that name on &quot;Revival&quot;). Rawlings produced the first release on Welch&#x27;s new label, the 2001 album &quot;Time (The Revelator).&quot; All but one song on the album was recorded in the historic RCA Studio B in Nashville. &quot;I Want To Sing That Rock and Roll&quot; was recorded live at the Ryman Auditorium in the recording sessions for the concert film &quot;Down from the Mountain&quot;.

Welch has said the album is about American history, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, and country music. There are songs about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the Titanic Disaster, John Henry, and Elvis Presley. &quot;Time&quot; continues Welch and Rawlings&#x27; style of mellow and sparse arrangements. Welch explained, &quot;As opposed to being little tiny folk songs or traditional songs, they&#x27;re really tiny rock songs. They&#x27;re just performed in this acoustic setting. In our heads we went electric without changing instruments.&quot;

&quot;Time (The Revelator)&quot; received extensive critical praise, most of which focused on the evolution of lyrics from mountain ballads. For Michael Shannon Friedman of &quot;The Charleston Gazette&quot;, &quot;Welch&#x27;s soul-piercing, backwoods quaver has always been a treasure, but on this record her songwriting is absolutely stunning.&quot; Critics compare the last track, the 15-minute &quot;I Dream a Highway&quot;, to classics by Bob Dylan and Neil Young. Zac Johnson of Allmusic described &quot;I Dream ...&quot; as akin to &quot;sweetly dozing in the [river] current like Huck and Jim&#x27;s Mississippi River afternoons&quot;. &quot;No Depression&quot;″s Grant Alden wrote, &quot;Welch and Rawlings have gathered ... fragments from across the rich history of American music and reset them as small, subtle jewels adorning their own keenly observed, carefully constructed language.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; finished thirteenth in the 2001 &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop music critic poll. &quot;Time (The Revelator)&quot; appeared in best of decade lists of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Paste&quot;, &quot;Uncut&quot;, &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, and the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;. The album was nominated for the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, but lost to Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Love and Theft&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Independent Album chart.

&quot;The Revelator Collection&quot; DVD was released in 2002. It featured live performances and music videos of songs from &quot;Time&quot;, and some covers. The concert footage was filmed in 2001, and the music videos included Welch and Rawlings performing three songs at RCA Studio B. &quot;No Depression&quot;″s Barry Mazor praised the DVD as an accompaniment for &quot;Time&quot;, calling it &quot;one last exclamation point on that memorable and important project.&quot;

===&quot;Soul Journey&quot;===

For the 2003 release, &quot;Soul Journey&quot;, Welch and Rawlings explored new territory. Welch said: &quot;I wanted to make it a happier record. Out of our four records, I thought this might be the one where you&#x27;re driving down the road listening to it on a sunny summer day.&quot; Rawlings again produced the record. The album also reflected a change in the typically sparse instrumentation: Welch and Rawlings introduced a dobro, violin, electric bass and drums, and Welch later said, &quot;Everything&#x27;s not supposed to sound the same, you want it to reflect change and growth.&quot;
In three songs of &quot;Soul Journey,&quot; for the first time Welch and Rawlings recorded their own versions of traditional folk songs.

&quot;Soul Journey&quot; also garnered significant acclaim. John Harris of &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine described the album as &quot;pretty much perfect&quot;, and &quot;Uncut&quot;″s Barney Hoskyns favorably compared it to Bob Dylan and The Band&#x27;s &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;. Will Hermes of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that Welch has &quot;never sounded deeper, realer, or sexier.&quot; &quot;Soul Journey&quot; peaked at No. 107 on the Billboard charts, and reached No. 3 for Independent Albums.

=== David Rawlings Projects ===
In addition to their work released under the name “Gillian Welch,” Welch and Rawlings have continued to build upon their partnership with several releases under Rawlings’ name. The Rawlings releases generally feature a larger string band and more lush arrangements than their “Gillian Welch” material, and have usually been released under the band name Dave Rawlings Machine. Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; described the band’s 2009 debut album &quot;A Friend of a Friend&quot; as &quot;akin to one of Welch&#x27;s albums, but with the balance of their harmonies swapped to favour Rawlings&#x27; voice&quot;. Welch co-wrote five of the songs with Rawlings, and provided guitar and harmony vocals. Although ostensibly Rawlings&#x27; first solo album, Alex Ramon of &quot;PopMatters&quot; noted the similarities to Welch albums. &quot;Paste Magazine&quot;″s Stephen Deusner praised &quot;A Friend of a Friend&quot; for incorporating &quot;a wide swath of traditional American music,&quot; comments echoed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Will Hermes and in the &quot;PopMatters&quot; piece.

On September 18, 2015, the duo released their second album under the band title Dave Rawlings Machine, &quot;Nashville Obsolete&quot;. The band includes Willie Watson, Paul Kowert, Brittany Haas, and occasionally includes Jordan Tice.

Released on August 11, 2017, &quot;Poor David’s Almanack&quot; was the first Welch/Rawlings collaboration to be released under the name David Rawlings, dropping the previous Dave Rawlings Machine moniker. The song “Cumberland Gap,” which features on the album, was nominated for the 2018 Grammy Award for Best American Roots Song. It was also utilized in the opening sequence of the 2019 Guy Richie film, &quot;The Gentlemen.&quot;

===&quot;The Harrow &amp; the Harvest&quot;===
In a 2007 feature in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, critic John Harris expressed frustration that there had not been a Gillian Welch release in four years. Creation Records founder Alan McGee showed optimism about Welch and Rawlings testing out some new songs while opening some concerts for Rilo Kiley, and wrote in a 2009 blog entry &quot;the long gestation period signals nothing less than a perfect album&quot;. In 2009, Rawlings said that recording for the next Gillian Welch album has started, but did not give a release date.

&quot;The Harrow &amp; the Harvest&quot; was released on June 28, 2011. Welch attributed the long time period between releases to dissatisfaction with the songs they were writing. She explained: &quot;Our songcraft slipped and I really don&#x27;t know why. It&#x27;s not uncommon. It&#x27;s something that happens to writers. It&#x27;s the deepest frustration we have come through, hence the album title.&quot; The writing process involved &quot;this endless back and forth between the two of us,&quot; Welch said, stating that &quot;It&#x27;s our most intertwined, co-authored, jointly-composed album.&quot;

The album received praise from publications such as &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Uncut&quot;, and&quot; Rolling Stone&quot;. Thom Jurek of Allmusic wrote that the album &quot;is stunning for its intimacy, its lack of studio artifice, its warmth and its timeless, if hard won, songcraft&quot;.

The album peaked at No. 20 on the US Billboard 200 and No. 25 on the UK Albums Chart. It was nominated for a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album, as well as Best Engineered Album.

===&quot;Boots No 1: The Official Revival Bootleg&quot;===
&quot;Boots No 1: The Official Revival Bootleg&quot;, was released on November 25, 2016. It received the status of &#x27;universal acclaim&#x27;, receiving a Metascore of 79, based upon eight critic reviews of the album. The album celebrates the 20th anniversary of Welch&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Revival&quot;, and includes outtakes, alternate versions, and demos of the songs featured on the original, as well as eight new unreleased tracks.

=== &quot;All the Good Times (Are Past &amp; Gone)&quot; ===
In July 2020, Welch and Rawlings announced &quot;All the Good Times (Are Past &amp; Gone)&quot;, an album of covers and traditional songs recorded at their home during the COVID-19 lockdowns of 2020. &quot;All the Good Times&quot; is notably the first album in their decades-long history of collaboration to be released jointly in both of their names. The album won the 2021 Grammy Award for Best Folk Album.

=== &quot;Woodland&quot; === 
On July 19, 2024, Welch and Rawlings announced &quot;Woodland&quot;, to be released August 23, 2024 through Acony Records, and shared its first single, &quot;Empty Trainload of Sky.&quot; The album is the first collection of original material from Welch since 2011&#x27;s &quot;The Harrow &amp; the Harvest&quot;, and the first from Rawlings since 2017&#x27;s &quot;Poor David&#x27;s Almanack&quot;. The album won the 2025 Grammy Award for Best Folk Album, marking Rawling&#x27;s second win of the award and making him and Welch the only two people to have won the award more than once.

==Musical style==
Welch and Rawlings incorporate elements of early twentieth century music such as old time, classic country, gospel and traditional bluegrass with modern elements of rhythm and blues, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, jazz, and punk rock. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Alec Wilkinson maintained their musical style is &quot;not easily classified—it is at once innovative and obliquely reminiscent of past rural forms&quot;.

The instrumentation on their songs is usually a simple arrangement, with Welch and Rawlings accompanying their own vocals with acoustic guitars, banjos, or a mandolin. Welch plays rhythm guitar with a 1956 Gibson J-50 (or banjo), while Rawlings plays lead on a 1935 Epiphone Olympic Guitar. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Wilkinson described Rawlings as a &quot;strikingly inventive guitarist&quot; who plays solos that are &quot;daring melodic leaps&quot;. A review in &quot;No Depression&quot; by Andy Moore observed that Rawlings &quot;squeezes, strokes, chokes and does just about everything but blow into&quot; his guitar.

===Themes===
Many songs performed by Welch and Rawlings contain dark themes about social outcasts struggling against such elements as poverty, drug addiction, death, a disconnection from their family, and an unresponsive God. Despite Welch being the lead singer, several of these characters are male. Welch has commented, &quot;To be commercial, everybody wants happy love songs. People would flat-out ask me, &#x27;Don&#x27;t you have any happy love songs?&#x27; Well, as a matter of fact, I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve got songs about orphans and morphine addicts.&quot; To reflect these themes, Welch and Rawlings often employ a slow pace to their songs. Their tempo is compared to a &quot;slow heartbeat&quot;, and Cowperthwait of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; observed that their songs &quot;can lull you into near-hypnosis and then make your jaw drop with one final revelation&quot;.

===Reception===

Geoffrey Himes of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Welch as &quot;one of the most interesting singer-songwriters of her generation&quot;. In 2003, Tom Kielty of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; observed that she was &quot;quietly establishing one of the most impressive catalogs in contemporary roots music&quot;, and a 2007 piece in &quot;The Guardian&quot; by John Harris called Welch &quot;one of the decade&#x27;s greatest talents&quot;. Critic Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;At every turn, she demonstrates a spark and commitment that should endear her to anyone from country and folk to pop and rock fans who appreciate imagination and heart.&quot;

When Welch&#x27;s first two albums came out, critics questioned the authenticity of her music, as she was raised in Southern California, but performed Appalachian themed songs. For &quot;Revival&quot;, Welch was criticized for &quot;manufacturing emotion&quot;, and a review of &quot;Hell Among the Yearlings&quot; by Chris Herrington of &quot;City Pages&quot; stated, &quot;Welch is someone who discovered old-time music in college and decided that her own sheltered life could never be worth writing about&quot;, and that she is &quot;completely devoid of individuality&quot;. Other critics rejected the notion that her background affects the authenticity of her music. Music critic Mark Kemp defended Welch in a &quot;New York Times&quot; piece:

The first-person protagonist of Ms. Welch&#x27;s song (&quot;Caleb Meyer&quot;) may be a young girl from a time and place that Ms. Welch will never fully understand, but the feelings the singer expresses about rape, and the respect she displays for her chosen musical genre, are nothing if not poignantly authentic. Likewise, it matters not whether Ms. Welch has ever walked the streets of &quot;the black dust towns of East Tennessee&quot; about which she sings in &quot;Miner&#x27;s Refrain&quot; because the sense of foreboding that she expresses for the men who once labored in coal mines with futile hopes of a better life comes through loud and clear. 

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;&#x27;s Taylor Holliday echoed this: &quot;Stingy critics give Ms. Welch a hard time because she&#x27;s a California city girl, not an Appalachian coal miner&#x27;s daughter. But as Lucinda or Emmylou might attest, love of the music is not a birthright, but an earned right. Listen to Ms. Welch yodel, in a tune about that no-good &quot;gal&quot; Morphine, and you know she&#x27;s as mountain as they come.&quot;

On September 16, 2015, the duo was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting by the Americana Music Association.

===Influences and collaborations===


Welch emphasizes music from a previous era as her major influence. She said that &quot;by and large I listen to people who are dead. I&#x27;m really of the tried-and-true school. I let 50 years go by and see what&#x27;s really relevant.&quot; Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, the Louvin Brothers, and the Blue Sky Boys. She explained her relationship with traditional music by saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve never tried to be traditional. It&#x27;s been a springboard for me and I love it and revere it and would not be doing what I do without the music of the Monroe Brothers, the Stanley Brothers and the Carter Family. However, it was clear I was never going to be able to do exactly that; I&#x27;m a songwriter.&quot;

In addition to the strong country influence, Welch also draws on a repertoire of such rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll artists as Bob Dylan, Chuck Berry, Neil Young, the Grateful Dead and the Velvet Underground. She has noted alternative rock bands Throwing Muses, Pixies and Camper Van Beethoven &quot;don&#x27;t directly inform my music, but they&#x27;re in there.&quot; Her cover of Black Star by Radiohead became well-known and was released as a single in 2005.

Welch has recorded songs with a variety of notable artists, including Ryan Adams, Ani DiFranco, Emmylou Harris, Jay Farrar, Alison Krauss, Old Crow Medicine Show, Bright Eyes, Robyn Hitchcock, Steve Earle, Ralph Stanley, Sara Watkins, The Decemberists, Solomon Burke and Mark Knopfler. Welch and Rawlings&#x27; contributions on Hitchcock&#x27;s album &quot;Spooked&quot; was described by Christopher Bahn of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; as &quot;subtle but vital&quot;. She later created the cover art for Hitchcock&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;The Man Upstairs&quot;. Mark Deming of Allmusic wrote that their work on Ryan Adams&#x27; album &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; &quot;brought out the best in Adams&quot;.

Artists who have recorded songs written by Welch include Jimmy Buffett, Alison Krauss and Union Station, Trisha Yearwood, Joan Baez, Brad Mehldau &amp; Chris Thile, Allison Moorer, Emmylou Harris, Miranda Lambert, Madison Cunningham, Kathy Mattea and ZZ Top.

===Performances===

Welch and Rawlings have played many music festivals, including The Newport Folk Festival, Coachella Festival, The Telluride Bluegrass Festival, The Cambridge Folk Festival, Bonnaroo, MerleFest, The Austin City Limits Festival, and Farm Aid. They have toured North America extensively, and have played in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Concert reviews have praised the chemistry between Welch and Rawlings on stage. Tizzy Asher of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; wrote &quot;there was a startling unspoken intimacy between them. They anticipated each other&#x27;s movements and shifted when necessary to fit each other.&quot; On August 6, 2022, they performed on the Grand Ole Opry.

The Dave Rawlings Machine have toured North America, with the band originally composed of Rawlings, Welch and three members of Old Crow Medicine Show. The band is currently composed of Rawlings, Welch, Wilie Watson, Paul Kowert, and Brittany Haas. Welch and Rawlings also participate in group tours with notable musicians. In 2004, they were part of the Sweet Harmony Traveling Revue, a three-week US tour with Patty Griffin, Buddy Miller and Emmylou Harris. In 2009, The Dave Rawlings Machine joined Old Crow Medicine Show, the Felice Brothers and Justin Townes Earle for the Big Surprise Tour, a US tour described as a &quot;roots-music extravaganza&quot;. In 2011, Welch was a support act for Buffalo Springfield, who performed and toured that year.

<text>SUNY Online (known as Open SUNY before 2019) is an online program of the State University of New York.

== History of SUNY Online ==
=== SUNY Learning Network (before 2013) ===
In 2005, the State University of New York announced the nations&#x27; first online bachelor degree in electrical engineering with a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. 

SUNY Learning Network (SLN) was an initiative that made online learning at the 64 SUNY schools accessible. The SUNY Learning Network provided course design instruction and support from the SUNY Center for Online Teaching Excellence (COTE) as well as learning management system hosting and support with helpdesk and application services. 

=== Open SUNY (2013–2019) ===
In 2013, Nancy Zimpher, 12th Chancellor for the State University of New York, announced the launch of Open SUNY, shifting services and support of SLN under the name Open SUNY. This announcement expanded online course and degree offerings across the SUNY System. It also involved a partnership with Coursera. At its launch in 2014, Open SUNY included 10 online bachelor’s degree programs in high-demand fields. Since its launch, Open SUNY degree and course offerings swelled to nearly 500 degree programs and certificates and 20,000 online courses. Open SUNY has three degree designations: Open SUNY and Open SUNY+. According to the Open SUNY, an Open SUNY+ degree is one that offers the following:

* &quot;Personal Concierge
* HelpDesk and Tutoring
* Experiential Learning.
* Industry-Leading Teaching Practices
* High-Need Areas

=== SUNY Online (2019–present) ===
In 2019, Kristina M. Johnson, SUNY&#x27;s 13th Chancellor, at her second State of the University address, announced her vision for the university system with the launch of SUNY Online. 

The announcement, according to Johnson, would expand the online offerings and deliver specialized program pathways for non-traditional students who wish to either pursue or finish a degree online. SUNY Online worked with campuses to offer program pathways in high-demand fields. The innovative idea not only laid out a specialized program pathways for adult and graduate students but for the first time SUNY System provided system-level support for students with the SUNY Online Success Coach. The first series of program pathways offered by SUNY Online includes:

* Business and Accounting
* Crime Analysis and Security Studies
* Digital Security
* Engineering
* Healthcare Management
* Psychology 

SUNY Online students work with SUNY Online admissions coaches to apply, but all SUNY Online degrees are delivered and conferred by SUNY campuses. SUNY Online pathways allow students to complete a 4-year degree or pursue grad school in stages. Students can enter with some credits, no credits, or a degree already in hand. While SUNY Online students pursue a SUNY Online degree, their Success Coach stays with them through the transfer process, until graduation, and as they move on to grad school. 

Not only did SUNY Online commit to program pathways for adult learners, but the announcement initiated a merger with Open SUNY. Open SUNY began the process of merging with SUNY Online in the summer of 2020, prior to the departure of Kristina M. Johnson, who left SUNY to become the president of Ohio State University. 

Open SUNY played an important role during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when Governor Andrew Cuomo announced all State University of New York campuses would go remote for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester. During the pandemic, SUNY Online offered coaching support, expanded helpdesk services to SUNY campuses, drop-in hours for students and faculty who required technical assistance, and COVID-19 resources on its COVID-19 response page.

<doc id="897058" wikidata="Q678598" url="?curid=897058" title="Johnny and the Dead">
<text>Johnny and the Dead (1993) is the second novel by Terry Pratchett to feature the character Johnny Maxwell. The other novels in the &quot;Johnny Maxwell Trilogy&quot; are &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind&quot; (1992) and &quot;Johnny and the Bomb&quot; (1996). In this story, Johnny sees and speaks with the spirits (they object to the term &quot;ghost&quot;) of those interred in his local cemetery and tries to help them when their home is threatened.

&quot;Johnny and the Dead&quot; is a feature of some schools&#x27; English curriculum.

==Plot summary==
The story starts with Johnny Maxwell, a 12-year-old boy, taking a shortcut through the local Blackbury cemetery to reach his home. In the cemetery, Johnny meets the spirit of Alderman Thomas Bowler and realizes that he can interact with the spirits of the dead. Later, Johnny meets all the deceased occupants of the cemetery and discusses with them the council&#x27;s sale of Blackbury&#x27;s neglected cemetery to a faceless conglomerate, who plan to build offices on it. Various dead citizens, led by a former town councillor, ask Johnny to help stop it.

While Johnny (helped by his semi-believing friends) tries to find evidence of famous internees and speaks out at community meetings, the dead begin to take an interest in modern-day life and realise they are not, as they once believed, trapped in the cemetery.

Finally the council is forced to back down, but the dead are no longer interested; they have decided that instead of waiting for the Day of Judgement, they will make the decision themselves. Most of them depart the cemetery to continue their journey into the afterlife but, thanks to the campaigning of the Blackbury Volunteers, the town&#x27;s living residents have rediscovered the cemetery as a link to their past. As one of the dead puts it before leaving: &quot;The living must remember, and the dead must forget.&quot;

==Ideas and themes==
The book is loosely based on real events in Westminster in the 1980s, when the council sold three cemeteries as building land for 15p (Pratchett was working as a journalist at this time).

Part of the story deals with the last surviving member of the Blackbury pals, a Pals battalion with obvious parallel to the Accrington Pals. This man is called Tommy Atkins, the name given to the generic British soldier of the day.

A running joke in the book is that most of the Dead are &quot;nearly famous&quot;, often being recognisable as very similar to a famous Briton. It is possible that Pratchett intends Blackbury Cemetery to be &quot;nearly Highgate&quot;, especially as one of the most prominent ghosts (William Stickers) is described as &quot;The man who would have invented communism if Karl Marx hadn&#x27;t.&quot;

==Adaptations==
The book was made into a TV serial of the same name for CITV on ITV in 1995. It starred Andrew Falvey as Johnny, and featured Brian Blessed as William Stickers and George Baker as Alderman Bowler.

It was also adapted as a play by Stephen Briggs.

<doc id="897064" wikidata="Q753127" url="?curid=897064" title="Topological sorting">
<text>In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge &quot;(u,v)&quot; from vertex &quot;u&quot; to vertex &quot;v&quot;, &quot;u&quot; comes before &quot;v&quot; in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. Precisely, a topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node &quot;v&quot; is visited only after all its dependencies are visited&quot;.&quot; A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there are linear time algorithms for constructing it. Topological sorting has many applications, especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set. Topological sorting is also possible when the DAG has disconnected components.

== Examples ==
The canonical application of topological sorting is in scheduling a sequence of jobs or tasks based on their dependencies. The jobs are represented by vertices, and there is an edge from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; if job &quot;x&quot; must be completed before job &quot;y&quot; can be started (for example, when washing clothes, the washing machine must finish before we put the clothes in the dryer). Then, a topological sort gives an order in which to perform the jobs. A closely-related application of topological sorting algorithms was first studied in the early 1960s in the context of the PERT technique for scheduling in project management. In this application, the vertices of a graph represent the milestones of a project, and the edges represent tasks that must be performed between one milestone and another. Topological sorting forms the basis of linear-time algorithms for finding the critical path of the project, a sequence of milestones and tasks that controls the length of the overall project schedule.

In computer science, applications of this type arise in instruction scheduling, ordering of formula cell evaluation when recomputing formula values in spreadsheets, logic synthesis, determining the order of compilation tasks to perform in makefiles, data serialization, and resolving symbol dependencies in linkers. It is also used to decide in which order to load tables with foreign keys in databases.

== Algorithms ==
The usual algorithms for topological sorting have running time linear in the number of nodes plus the number of edges, asymptotically, formula_1

===Kahn&#x27;s algorithm===

One of these algorithms, first described by , works by choosing vertices in the same order as the eventual topological sort. First, find a list of &quot;start nodes&quot; that have no incoming edges and insert them into a set S; at least one such node must exist in a non-empty (finite) acyclic graph. Then:

 &quot;L&quot; ← Empty list that will contain the sorted elements
 &quot;S&quot; ← Set of all nodes with no incoming edge
 while &quot;S&quot; is not empty do
 remove a node &quot;n&quot; from &quot;S&quot;
 add &quot;n&quot; to &quot;L&quot;
 for each node &quot;m&quot; with an edge &quot;e&quot; from &quot;n&quot; to &quot;m&quot; do
 remove edge &quot;e&quot; from the graph
 if &quot;m&quot; has no other incoming edges then
 insert &quot;m&quot; into &quot;S&quot;
 if &quot;graph&quot; has edges then
 return error &quot;(graph has at least one cycle)&quot;
 else 
 return &quot;L&quot; &quot;(a topologically sorted order)&quot;

If the graph is a DAG, a solution will be contained in the list L (although the solution is not necessarily unique). Otherwise, the graph must have at least one cycle and therefore a topological sort is impossible.

Reflecting the non-uniqueness of the resulting sort, the structure S can be simply a set or a queue or a stack. Depending on the order that nodes n are removed from set S, a different solution is created. A variation of Kahn&#x27;s algorithm that breaks ties lexicographically forms a key component of the Coffman–Graham algorithm for parallel scheduling and layered graph drawing.

===Depth-first search===
An alternative algorithm for topological sorting is based on depth-first search. The algorithm loops through each node of the graph, in an arbitrary order, initiating a depth-first search that terminates when it hits any node that has already been visited since the beginning of the topological sort or the node has no outgoing edges (i.e., a leaf node):

 &quot;L&quot; ← Empty list that will contain the sorted nodes
 while exists nodes without a permanent mark do
 select an unmarked node &quot;n&quot;
 visit(&quot;n&quot;)
 function visit(node &quot;n&quot;)
 if &quot;n&quot; has a permanent mark then
 return
 if &quot;n&quot; has a temporary mark then
 stop &quot;(graph has at least one cycle)&quot;
 mark &quot;n&quot; with a temporary mark
 for each node &quot;m&quot; with an edge from &quot;n&quot; to &quot;m&quot; do
 visit(&quot;m&quot;)
 mark &quot;n&quot; with a permanent mark
 add &quot;n&quot; to head of &quot;L&quot;

Each node &quot;n&quot; gets &quot;prepended&quot; to the output list L only after considering all other nodes that depend on &quot;n&quot; (all descendants of &quot;n&quot; in the graph). Specifically, when the algorithm adds node &quot;n&quot;, we are guaranteed that all nodes that depend on &quot;n&quot; are already in the output list L: they were added to L either by the recursive call to visit() that ended before the call to visit &quot;n&quot;, or by a call to visit() that started even before the call to visit &quot;n&quot;. Since each edge and node is visited once, the algorithm runs in linear time. This depth-first-search-based algorithm is the one described by ; it seems to have been first described in print by Tarjan in 1976.

===Parallel algorithms===
On a parallel random-access machine, a topological ordering can be constructed in &quot;O&quot;((log &quot;n&quot;)2) time using a polynomial number of processors, putting the problem into the complexity class NC2.
One method for doing this is to repeatedly square the adjacency matrix of the given graph, logarithmically many times, using min-plus matrix multiplication with maximization in place of minimization. The resulting matrix describes the longest path distances in the graph. Sorting the vertices by the lengths of their longest incoming paths produces a topological ordering.

An algorithm for parallel topological sorting on distributed memory machines parallelizes the algorithm of Kahn for a DAG formula_2. On a high level, the algorithm of Kahn repeatedly removes the vertices of indegree 0 and adds them to the topological sorting in the order in which they were removed. Since the outgoing edges of the removed vertices are also removed, there will be a new set of vertices of indegree 0, where the procedure is repeated until no vertices are left. This algorithm performs formula_3 iterations, where is the longest path in . Each iteration can be parallelized, which is the idea of the following algorithm.

In the following, it is assumed that the graph partition is stored on processing elements (PE), which are labeled formula_4. Each PE initializes a set of local vertices formula_5 with indegree 0, where the upper index represents the current iteration. Since all vertices in the local sets formula_6 have indegree 0, i.e., they are not adjacent, they can be given in an arbitrary order for a valid topological sorting. To assign a global index to each vertex, a prefix sum is calculated over the sizes of formula_6. So, each step, there are formula_8 vertices added to the topological sorting.

In the first step, PE assigns the indices formula_9 to the local vertices in formula_10. These vertices in formula_10 are removed, together with their corresponding outgoing edges. For each outgoing edge formula_12 with endpoint in another PE formula_13, the message formula_12 is posted to PE . After all vertices in formula_10 are removed, the posted messages are sent to their corresponding PE. Each message formula_12 received updates the indegree of the local vertex . If the indegree drops to zero, is added to formula_17. Then the next iteration starts.

In step , PE assigns the indices formula_18, where formula_19 is the total number of processed vertices after step . This procedure repeats until there are no vertices left to process, hence formula_20. Below is a high level, single program, multiple data pseudo-code overview of this algorithm.

The communication cost depends heavily on the given graph partition. As for runtime, on a CRCW-PRAM model that allows fetch-and-decrement in constant time, this algorithm runs in formula_22, where is again the longest path in and the maximum degree.

==Application to shortest path finding==
The topological ordering can also be used to quickly compute shortest paths through a weighted directed acyclic graph. Let be the list of vertices in such a graph, in topological order. Then the following algorithm computes the shortest path from some source vertex to all other vertices:

* Let be an array of the same length as ; this will hold the shortest-path distances from . Set , all other .
* Let be an array of the same length as , with all elements initialized to . Each will hold the predecessor of in the shortest path from to .
* Loop over the vertices as ordered in , starting from :
** For each vertex directly following (i.e., there exists an edge from to ):
*** Let be the weight of the edge from to .
*** Relax the edge: if , set
**** .

Equivalently:
* Let be an array of the same length as ; this will hold the shortest-path distances from . Set , all other .
* Let be an array of the same length as , with all elements initialized to . Each will hold the predecessor of in the shortest path from to .
* Loop over the vertices as ordered in , starting from :
** For each vertex into (i.e., there exists an edge from to ):
*** Let be the weight of the edge from to .
*** Relax the edge: if , set
**** .

On a graph of vertices and edges, this algorithm takes , i.e., linear, time.

==Uniqueness==
If a topological sort has the property that all pairs of consecutive vertices in the sorted order are connected by edges, then these edges form a directed Hamiltonian path in the DAG. If a Hamiltonian path exists, the topological sort order is unique; no other order respects the edges of the path. Conversely, if a topological sort does not form a Hamiltonian path, the DAG will have two or more valid topological orderings, for in this case it is always possible to form a second valid ordering by swapping two consecutive vertices that are not connected by an edge to each other. Therefore, it is possible to test in linear time whether a unique ordering exists, and whether a Hamiltonian path exists, despite the NP-hardness of the Hamiltonian path problem for more general directed graphs (i.e., cyclic directed graphs).

==Relation to partial orders==
Topological orderings are also closely related to the concept of a linear extension of a partial order in mathematics. A partially ordered set is just a set of objects together with a definition of the &quot;≤&quot; inequality relation, satisfying the axioms of reflexivity (&quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;), antisymmetry (if &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; then &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;) and transitivity (if &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;z&quot;, then &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;z&quot;). A total order is a partial order in which, for every two objects &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in the set, either &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; or &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;. Total orders are familiar in computer science as the comparison operators needed to perform comparison sorting algorithms. For finite sets, total orders may be identified with linear sequences of objects, where the &quot;≤&quot; relation is true whenever the first object precedes the second object in the order; a comparison sorting algorithm may be used to convert a total order into a sequence in this way. A linear extension of a partial order is a total order that is compatible with it, in the sense that, if &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; in the partial order, then &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; in the total order as well.

One can define a partial ordering from any DAG by letting the set of objects be the vertices of the DAG, and defining &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; to be true, for any two vertices &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, whenever there exists a directed path from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;; that is, whenever &quot;y&quot; is reachable from &quot;x&quot;. With these definitions, a topological ordering of the DAG is the same thing as a linear extension of this partial order. Conversely, any partial ordering may be defined as the reachability relation in a DAG. One way of doing this is to define a DAG that has a vertex for every object in the partially ordered set, and an edge &quot;xy&quot; for every pair of objects for which &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;. An alternative way of doing this is to use the transitive reduction of the partial ordering; in general, this produces DAGs with fewer edges, but the reachability relation in these DAGs is still the same partial order. By using these constructions, one can use topological ordering algorithms to find linear extensions of partial orders.

==Relation to scheduling optimisation==
By definition, the solution of a scheduling problem that includes a precedence graph is a valid solution to topological sort (irrespective of the number of machines), however, topological sort in itself is &quot;not&quot; enough to optimally solve a scheduling optimisation problem. Hu&#x27;s algorithm is a popular method used to solve scheduling problems that require a precedence graph and involve processing times (where the goal is to minimise the largest completion time amongst all the jobs). Like topological sort, Hu&#x27;s algorithm is not unique and can be solved using DFS (by finding the largest path length and then assigning the jobs).

<text>New Navarre () was at first an informal name given to the silver-mining region north of Sinaloa. Just before his death in 1711, the Jesuit Eusebio Kino drew a map of the area with that name. New Navarre would have included the Pimería Alta, where Kino spent 24 years establishing missions, along with the Navarrese Juan Matheo Manje. Later Nueva Navarra was a province in the Provincias Internas, one of the frontier provinces of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Brigadier Pedro de Rivera, who visited the northern presidios from 1724 to 1728, suggested to the viceroy Juan de Acuña, Marquis of Casafuerte, the political and administrative reorganization of the northwest provinces. The viceroy supported the idea, and it was approved by Philip V of Spain in 1732, and executed the following year with the appointment of the first governor, Manuel Bernal de Huidobro, at that time mayor of Sinaloa. In the branches of government, finance and war, the governor was directly subject to the viceroy, while the field of justice was under the jurisdiction of the Royal Audience of Guadalajara (&quot;Real Audiencia de Guadalajara&quot;) of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. By 1806, the province was generally recognized as Sonora or Nueva Navarra, with the capital in Arizpe, and including the area comprising Sinaloa (de Iriarte, 1806). After Independence Sonora y Sinaloa became one of the constituent states of the Mexican Republic. The Sonoran Desert ecoregion covers much of the state.

In the early years of European migration to Nueva Navarra, the Basques became a significant proportion of the population. The Basque immigrants reached 6% of total migrants in the first 15 years of colonization, the same percentage as those from the Castile or Extremadura, most populated regions. More specific data shows ratios between 8% and 16% of Basques in the nuclei urban settlements of those first decades, indicating a trend which would persist in the future: the Basque-Navarre preference for urban settlement (Boyde-Bowman, 1964).

<text>Thy Majestie is an Italian power metal band that formed in 1999. Their music is typically cinematic, epic, symphonic, progressive and darker than typical power metal with symphonic influences. They have released five full-length albums.

==Biography==
The band was started by Giuseppe Bondì and Claudio Diprima with the desire to create their own music after playing in a cover band. Maurizio Malta, Giovanni Santini, Dario D&#x27;Alessandro and Dario Grillo joined them to form Thy Majestie. After releasing &quot;Sword, Crown and Shields&quot;, a 3-track demo, Thy Majestie composed new material which was recorded in March 1999 titled &quot;Perpetual Glory&quot;. It was highly praised by Italian metal magazines and they were able to sign a contract with Scarlet Records. In March 2000 they began working on their debut album &quot;The Lasting Power&quot; which was finished in April 2000.

In September 2001 Limb Music (who produced Rhapsody of Fire) took notice of Thy Majestie but could not sign a deal with them because they were already signed to &quot;Scarlet Music&quot; to record two albums. In January 2002 Thy Majestie was contacted by Thomas Youngblood to support him on his European tour with his band Kamelot but they could not afford travel expenses and had to record another album 2 months later.

In 2002, they released the album &quot;Hastings 1066&quot; which is based on the Battle of Hastings.

In November 2003, vocalist Dario Grillo left the band to pursue a solo career (as leader of the band Platens). In December 2003, Gabriele Grilli (who has also played in Doomsword) joined as his replacement. But in October 2004 he left as well &quot;due to personal reasons&quot;, one of them being the distance between Grilli&#x27;s hometown, Varese, and Palermo, where the other members of the band live. One song was released with Gabriele on vocals, namely a demo version of &quot;The Siege of Paris&quot;, later to appear on the &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; album. Shortly thereafter, Giulio Di Gregorio (also in Irencros) was announced as the new singer.

2005 saw the release of the third Thy Majestie album, &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot;, which is a concept album about the French heroine Jeanne d&#x27;Arc. The album was released through Scarlet Records. Its style has been compared to that of the Italian band Labyrinth.

The 3 of May 2005, Giulio Di Gregorio was expelled from the band due to his poor knowledge of the English language and his numerous health problems which kept him from performing live with the band. After a short period when USA-based singer Matt Aub (from Timelord) had been singing for the band, it was announced that Thy Majestie&#x27;s first vocalist, Dario Grillo would be returning to the band. His return, however, caused the same problems experienced four years earlier and lead to a definitive separation. Dario Grillo was replaced by Fingerbang singer Dario Cascio. At the same time guitarist Giovanni Santini decided to leave the band and was replaced by Simone Campione. During the end of year 2007, the other founding member, Giuseppe Bondi, left Thy Majestie for personal reasons.

A new keyboarder, Valerio Castorino, was taken in and the band signed with a new record label, Dark Balance Records. Thy Majestie performed at the Immortal Metal Fest in Finland on 19 April 2008 as well as at Fear Dark in Zwolle, the Netherlands on 24 May 2008 and in Stuttgart, Germany on 1 June 2008. The group released the album &quot;Dawn&quot; on 1 September 2008, which has been compared to the Swedish metal scene, namely Axenstar and Dragonland.

Valerio Castorino, who toured with Thy Majestie during their last gigs in Europe, and Dario Cascio left the band because of private matters. Giuseppe Carrubba, who also plays with Inner Quest, an Italian Progressive metal band, and Alessio Taormina replaced him. The band released their 5th full-length album, &quot;ShiHuangDi&quot;, in 2012 for Scarlet Records.

<doc id="897080" wikidata="Q1965741" url="?curid=897080" title="Nash Metropolitan">
<text>The Nash Metropolitan is an American automobile assembled in England and marketed from 1953 until 1962.

It conforms to two classes of vehicle: economy car and subcompact car. The Metropolitan is considered a &quot;subcompact&quot;, but this category was not yet in use when the car was made. At that time, it was categorized as a &quot;small automobile&quot; as well as an &quot;economy car&quot;.

The Metropolitan was also marketed as a Hudson model when Nash and Hudson merged in 1954 to form the American Motors Corporation (AMC). The Nash and Hudson lines were phased out in favor of the Rambler line, and in 1957, the Metropolitan became a standalone brand and was badged with a stylized &#x27;M&#x27; on hubcaps and grille. The cars were also sold in the United Kingdom and other markets.

==Design==
While most domestic automobile makers were following a &quot;bigger-is-better&quot; philosophy, Nash Motor Company executives were examining the market to offer American buyers an economical transportation alternative. The Metropolitan was designed in Kenosha, Wisconsin. It was patterned from a concept car, the &quot;NXI&quot; (Nash Experimental International), that was built by Detroit-based independent designer William J. Flajole for Nash-Kelvinator. It was designed as the &quot;second car in a two car family&quot;, for Mom taking the kids to school or shopping or for Dad to drive to the railroad station to ride to work: the &quot;commuter/shopping car&quot; with resemblance to the big Nash, but the scale was tiny as the Met&#x27;s wheelbase was shorter than the Volkswagen Beetle&#x27;s.

The NXI design study incorporated many innovative features and attempted to use interchangeable front and rear components (the symmetrical door skins were the only interchangeable items used in production). Although more complex, the new vehicle also incorporated Nash&#x27;s advanced single-unit (unit body) construction. It was displayed at several &quot;surviews&quot; (survey-previews), commencing on 4 January 1950, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York, to gauge the reaction of the American motoring public to a car of this size. The result of these &quot;surviews&quot; convinced Nash that there was a market for such a car if it could be built at a competitive price.

A series of prototypes followed that incorporated many of the improvements from the &quot;surviews&quot; that included roll-up glass side windows, a more powerful engine, and a column-mounted transmission shifter with bench seat (rather than bucket-type seats with floor shift fitted in the concept car). The model was named &quot;NKI&quot; (for Nash-Kelvinator International), and it featured revised styling incorporating a hood blister and rear wheel cutouts.

Nash was positioning this new product for the postwar market for &quot;personal use&quot; autos. These specific use vehicles were as a second car for women or an economical commuter car. The Metropolitan was also aimed at returning Nash to overseas markets. However, Mason and Nash&#x27;s management calculated that building such a car from scratch in the U.S. would be impossible because the tooling costs would have been prohibitive. The only cost-effective option was to build overseas using existing mechanical components (engine, transmission, rear end, suspension, brakes, electrical), leaving only the tooling cost for body panels and other unique elements.

With this in mind, Nash Motors negotiated with several European companies. On 5 October 1952, they announced that they had selected the Austin Motor Company (by then part of BMC) and Fisher &amp; Ludlow (which also became part of BMC in September 1953, later operating under the name Pressed Steel Fisher), both English companies based in Birmingham, England and vicinity. Fisher &amp; Ludlow would produce the bodywork, the mechanicals would be provided, and the Austin Motor Company would perform the final assembly. This was the first time an American-designed car was exclusively marketed in North America and had been entirely built in Europe. It became a captive import – a foreign-built vehicle sold and serviced by Nash (and later by American Motors) through its dealer distribution system. It is believed that Austin completed the first pre-production prototype on 2 December 1952. In all, five pre-production prototypes were built by Austin Motors and tested before the start of production. The total tooling cost amounted to US$1,018,475.94 (Austin: US$197,849.14; Fisher &amp; Ludlow: US$820,626.80), a fraction of the tooling cost for a U.S.-built vehicle.

The styling for all Nash vehicles then was an amalgam of designs from Pinin Farina and his design house of Italy and the in-house Nash design team. The Nash models, from the Ambassador to the Metropolitan, utilized similar design features, including fully enclosed front wheels, notched &quot;pillow&quot; style door pressing, bar-style grille, etc.

The new Metropolitan was made in two body designs: convertible and hardtop. All came with several standard features that were optional on most cars of the era. Among these factory-installed benefits for customers were a map light, electric windshield wipers, cigar lighter, and even a &quot;continental-type&quot; rear-mounted spare tire with cover. To give a &quot;luxury&quot; image to the interior, &quot;Bedford cord&quot; upholstery trimmed with leather was used (similar to larger Nash vehicles). An AM radio, &quot;Weather Eye&quot; heater, and whitewall tires were offered as optional extras for the U.S. market. (It is unlikely that a Metropolitan could have been purchased without a heater and radio, as all vehicles left the factory with both items fitted.)

The Metropolitan was the first postwar American car that was marketed specifically to women. The Dodge La Femme was introduced one year later. The first spokesperson for the car was Miss America 1954, Evelyn Ay Sempier. The car was prominently advertised in &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;. American Motors&#x27; marketing brochures described the new model as &quot;America&#x27;s entirely new kind of car&quot; (1955), &quot;Luxury in Miniature&quot; (1959), and &quot;crafted for personal transportation&quot; (1960).

==First reviews==
Compared with the typical American car of the 1950s, the Metropolitan was considered &quot;remarkably nimble&quot; by many early testers, and &quot;the consensus is that the Metropolitan isn&#x27;t just fun to look at, it&#x27;s fun to drive too.&quot; Owners of the cars reported that the &quot;Metropolitan is a good thing in a small package&quot;.

Automotive industry veteran and the largest publisher of automotive books at the time, Floyd Clymer, took several Metropolitans through his tests. He &quot;abused&quot; a 1954 Metropolitan convertible and &quot;got the surprise of my life&quot; when its &quot;performance was far better than I expected&quot;, that he &quot;felt very safe in the car&quot;, and that &quot;it may well be that Nash has started a new trend in American motoring. Perhaps the public is now getting ready to accept a small car&quot;. Clymer also took a 1957 Metropolitan hardtop through a grueling road test that even took him up Pikes Peak. He summed up his experience that &quot;I can not praise the Metropolitan too highly. It is a fascinating little car to drive, its performance is far better than one would expect, and the ride is likewise more than expected&quot;.

According to &quot;Collectible Auto&quot; magazine, the car was described in &quot;Car Life&quot;″s review as &quot;a big car in miniature&quot; that was &quot;fun to drive&quot; and &quot;ideal for a second car in the family,&quot; while &quot;Motor Trend&quot; was not alone in regarding the rear &quot;utility&quot; seat as &quot;a joke&quot;.

&quot;Motor Trend&quot; praised the car&#x27;s economy: its test Metropolitan returned:
: at ,
: at , and
: &quot;in traffic&quot;.

&quot;Mechanix Illustrated&quot; editor Tom McCahill wrote: &quot;It is not a sports car by the weirdest torturing of the imagination but it is a fleet, sporty little bucket which should prove just what the doctor ordered for a second car, to be used either for a trip to the movies or for a fast run to a penicillin festival.&quot; He added that it was a &quot;nice-handling car with plenty of control and amazing dig, considering it is powered by a small Austin A-40 engine&quot; and that the finish was &quot;very nice&quot;, although having no trunk opening except by pulling down the back of the rear seat &quot;poses a problem&quot;. His test car accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 19.3 seconds and could exceed .

A &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; road test recorded acceleration from 0–60 mph in 22.4 seconds, &quot;almost half of the VW&#x27;s 39.2&quot;. However, the magazine noted that at , a typical American cruising speed at the time, the Metropolitan was revving at 4300 rpm, which shortened engine life, whereas the Volkswagen could travel at the same speed at only 3000 rpm. &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;″s testers also said that the car had &quot;more than its share of roll and wallow on corners&quot; and there was &quot;little seat-of-the-pants security when the rear end takes its time getting back in line&quot;.

&quot;Road Test&quot; magazine wrote in 1954 that &quot;on roadability and responsive handling, the Met shines. It also offers easy maintenance and downright stinginess when it comes to gasoline consumption. Also, it&#x27;s literally a brute for punishment. On several occasions I took familiar corners at speeds half again what I would dare to use in some cars of twice the weightproof that proper weight distribution, low center of gravity and well engineered suspension have more to do with roadability than massiveness, weight and long wheelbases. Admittedly, the short wheelbased Met does pitch moderately on very rough roads, but the sensitivity and ease of steering make driving a pleasure.&quot;

==Production for U.S.==

===Series I===


Production at Austin&#x27;s Longbridge factory started in October 1953 (Commencing VIN1001). Nicknamed the &quot;baby Nash&quot;, the cars were tiny. They had an wheelbase, overall length of and a gross weight of only for the convertible and for the hardtop, thus making the Metropolitan smaller than the Volkswagen Beetle. The two models, a convertible and a hardtop, were powered by the OHV straight-4 Austin &#x27;A40&#x27; series engine (as used in the Austin A40 Devon/Dorset) driving the rear wheels through a three-speed manual transmission. The initial order was for 10,000 units, with an option to increase the order if sales were sufficient.

The new car underwent rigorous testing at the Nash Proving Grounds, but the first assignment for newly hired Assistant Technical Advisor, Carl Chakmakian, was to conduct supervised testing to achieve advertising and sales training objectives. In December 1953, two new NKI-branded (serial numbers 1009 and 1013) were driven from their arrival port to the new Raleigh Speedway in North Carolina to conduct two days of speed endurance and fuel economy evaluation. The tests were run and certified by NASCAR officials that included Bill France. With two drivers from Shreveport, Louisiana, Roxy Dancey and Herschel Buchanan, one car finished the 24-hour endurance run achieving at an average speed of and overall. It had eleven pit stops to change drivers, add fuel and oil, and make tire changes because of the track&#x27;s abrasive aggregate surface and fast corners. The car did not need any service or parts other than the tires. The second car was subjected to a non-stop 24-hour fuel economy test with drivers changing every three hours while the car was in motion, and refueling was also accomplished in motion three times by attaching a gas can to the side window drained into the car&#x27;s tank. The car averaged .

The new model was initially to be called the &quot;NKI Custom&quot;, but the name was changed to &quot;Metropolitan&quot; just two months before its public release. New chrome nameplates with the &quot;Metropolitan&quot; name were made to fit into the same holes as the &quot;NKI Custom&quot; script on the passenger side front fender. Nash dealers had to rebadge the early cars that came with the &quot;NKI Custom&quot; name. Still, some factory manuals had already been prepared and distributed to service departments with the NKI name. The first examples badged as Nash went on sale on 19 March 1954 in the U.S. and Canada. &quot;Autocar&quot; said that &quot;at a production rate of less than 400 cars a week ... it was hardly going to be a runaway best seller.&quot;

In surveys, Americans had affirmed a desire for economy cars, but in practice, they bought the Metropolitan in relatively small numbers. Although Nash merged with Hudson in 1954 and marketed the car as a Hudson Metropolitan in 1955, &quot;demand never took off from the original level&quot;, primarily because the Metropolitan was slow by North American standards. In the first month of sales, 862 Metropolitans were sold in U.S. and Canada, while in the first six months, a total of 7,042 were sold. A further order was placed with Austin.

Available exterior colors were P903 &quot;Spruce Green&quot;, P904 &quot;Canyon Red&quot;, P905 &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot;, or P906 &quot;Croton Green&quot;, with P907 &quot;Mist Grey&quot; as a contrast color for the hardtops. P906 &quot;Croton Green&quot; was dropped as a color option in April 1954. Cars incorporated the Nash logo on their grille badge, hubcaps, horn button, and spare wheel cover. The suggested retail price (MSRP) for Series I (also known as NK1) models was US$1,445 (hardtop) and $1,469 (convertible). Adding a radio and a heater pushed the price above $1,500: at the time, the Volkswagen Beetle was priced at $1,425.

In May 1954, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation announced that it had merged with the Hudson Motor Company to form American Motors Corporation (AMC). Thus, by August 1954, Metropolitans become available through Hudson dealers. These Hudson Metropolitans carried a Hudson grille badge, hubcaps incorporating an &quot;M&quot; logo, a &quot;bulls-eye&quot; horn button design, and a plain spare wheel cover. Braking performance was from to a full stop.

===Series II===
After the first 10,000 cars were built, the engine was changed to a B-Series, but still of , (as used in the Austin A40 Cambridge). Other modifications included a new gearbox and hydraulic actuation for the clutch (Series I models used a mechanical clutch linkage). The change to a new engine and gearbox added to the weight. This model is referred to as Series II or NK2 (Commencing with Vehicle identification number (VIN) E11001 on 19 August 1954).

===Series III===


November 1955 saw the start of Metropolitan Series III (NK3) production (Commencing with VIN E21008 on 28 November 1955). The design also included the B-Series engine increase in capacity to (as used in the Austin A50 Cambridge). Polished stainless steel sweep-spears on the body sides allowed a new two-tone finish to be incorporated, which had the cosmetic effect of lowering, slimming, and lengthening the car. The new exterior colors were P905 &quot;Caribbean Green&quot;, P910 &quot;Sunburst Yellow&quot;, and P911 &quot;Coral Red&quot; with P909 &quot;Snowberry White&quot; as a contrast. The grille was also redesigned, and the hood had its non-functional hood scoop removed. American Motors changed the designation to &quot;Metropolitan 1500&quot; to differentiate it from the earlier models. The interior was also changed to incorporate a &quot;houndstooth&quot; check material for the seats trimmed with white vinyl. The dashboard was also painted black, rather than the body color, just like the Series I and II Metropolitans.

The MSRP for Series III models was $1,527 (hardtop) and $1,551 (convertible). After VIN E35133 (16 April 1957), the exterior colors were changed to P910 &quot;Sunburst Yellow&quot;, P912 &quot;Berkshire Green&quot;, and P913 &quot;Mardi-Gras Red&quot; with P914 &quot;Frost White&quot; as a contrast. After VIN E45912 (9 January 1958), the color P910 &quot;Sunburst Yellow&quot; was replaced by P915 &quot;Autumn Yellow&quot; and P908 &quot;Classic Black&quot; was added to the available exterior colors.

In September 1957, AMC announced the discontinuation of the historic Nash and Hudson brand names. The Metropolitan was subsequently marketed under the &quot;Metropolitan&quot; name only and sold through Rambler dealers. The Nash and Hudson Grille medallions were believed to have been discontinued around October 1956 (VIN E28326); they were replaced with the &quot;M&quot; style grille medallion.

===Series IV===


January 1959 saw the start of Metropolitan Series IV (NK4) production (Commencing with VIN E59048 on 12 January 1959). This major redesign saw the addition of an external decklid (previous models only allowed access to the trunk through the rear seatback), one-piece rear window, and vent windows. By this time, the engine had been upgraded by increasing the compression ratio from 7.2:1 to 8.3:1 (Commenced VIN E43116 — 15 October 1957), rated at (as used in the Austin A55 Cambridge). The additional features added to the weight. Exterior color options were the same as for Series III. The interior used a diamond pattern for the seats, with white vinyl trim. The MSRP for Series IV models was $1,672.60 (hardtop) and $1,696.80 (convertible).

Sales rose to 22,209 units in 1959, the Metropolitan&#x27;s best-selling year, promoting it to second place behind Volkswagen in sales of cars imported to the U.S. American Motors&#x27; advertising made much of this ranking while not mentioning that the Volkswagen Beetle outsold the Metropolitan by 5 to 1.

For the 1960 model year, American Motors prepared a Metropolitan convertible for the Easter Parade in New York City. Named the &quot;Metropolitan Fifth Avenue&quot;, the car was finished with 15 hand-rubbed coats of pearl-pink lacquer outside and featured pink-and-white cowhide upholstery and pink fur carpeting. Rear fender sides had Fifth Avenue lettering while the front fenders featured triangular badges that combined American and British flags. The car was filled with large plush bunnies that were given away every hour. The Fifth Avenue was displayed on the 1960 auto show circuit and ultimately sold to an AMC dealer in Boston. Three other Metropolitan convertibles were prepared with unique region-inspired features by AMC&#x27;s styling department: &quot;Westerner&quot;, &quot;Cape Cod&quot;, and the &quot;Royal Runabout&quot; a black-and-gold one-off built for and presented to Britain&#x27;s Princess Margaret.

Production ceased in April 1961 (final VIN — E95981, built 19 April 1961). Sales of the existing inventory continued until March 1962.

A drawing attributed to Richard Arbib, dated 17 January 1956, shows a Metropolitan station wagon with additional fins and sharp edges. American Motors contemplated a station wagon version. Two prototypes were built and displayed at car shows, but the project was abandoned. One of the two prototypes has been restored and is on display at a Metropolitan restoration facility in North Hollywood, California.

Approximately 95,000 Metropolitans were sold in the United States and Canada, making it one of the top-selling cars to be imported into those countries at the time, and its sales in 1959 helped to spur the introduction of the Big Three (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) new compact models.

===Yearly shipments===

===Production dates===
To establish the production date for a Metropolitan (U.S. and Canadian models only), check the VIN or Serial number on a data plate affixed to the firewall. Chassis numbers after 4781 are prefixed by the letter &quot;E&quot;. The number on the list below can provide an approximate production date. NB. Since the cars took at least six weeks to be shipped from the Longbridge factory to the U.S. distribution network, the actual titled date will be different from the production date.
==Production for foreign markets==

In October 1956, Austin Motor Company obtained permission from American Motors to sell the Metropolitans in overseas countries where AMC did not have a presence. The early brochures for the Austin Metropolitans used a reversed photograph to show a right-hand drive (RHD) car parked in an English country town (Chipping Campden) because only left-hand drive vehicles were available at the time the photos were taken.

From December 1956, production of Austin Metropolitans began, and from 2 April 1957, approximately 9,400 additional units were sold in overseas markets that included the United Kingdom and New Zealand. List prices for the UK Series III models were £713 17s 0d for the hardtop and £725 2s 0d for the convertible. An estimated 1,200 Metropolitans were sold there in four years, according to several published sources. However, one British journalist estimated the figure to be around 5,000. Markedly American, the styling was considered outlandish compared with the more sober British-styled models in the British Motor Corporation lineup.

Only Series III and Series IV Metropolitans were produced for sale in the UK. (The first Metropolitans sold in the UK were sold only to American and Canadian service members stationed in the UK.) Series III models carried the prefix HD6 (convertible) or HE6 (hardtop). Some early Series III models carried the prefix HNK3H or HNK3HL (L=Left-Hand Drive). The prefix is thought to indicate &quot;Home Nash Kelvinator Series 3 H=1400-1999cc (Metropolitan=1500cc)&quot;. UK Series III sales ran from April 1957 to February 1959. Series IV models, which carried the prefix A-HJ7 (convertible) or A-HP7 (hardtop), were sold from September 1960 to February 1961. The Metropolitan was unavailable for UK sales between February 1959 and September 1960 since all production was destined for U.S. and Canadian dealers. When sales in the UK resumed, they were sold through Austin dealers at listed prices of £707 6s 8d for the hardtop and £732 2s 6d for the convertible. Austin was dropped from the name, which became simply &quot;Metropolitan,&quot; and the cars carried no Austin badges, although they had Austin Company chassis plates. Despite this, the car remained known, by trade and public alike, as the Austin Metropolitan, often shortened to Austin Metro in common parlance. British Motor Company (BMC and later, British Leyland) adopted the&#x27; Metro&#x27; tag as a house name, re-emerging in 1980 on the Austin (mini) Metro.

In May 1960, Car Mart Ltd. (a large Austin dealership in London, UK) presented Princess Margaret as a wedding present with a specially prepared Metropolitan finished in black with gold trim and gold leather interior. It was stolen in London in February 1961.

As a result of low sales, production of the Austin Metropolitan ended in February 1961. Two additional &quot;one-offs&quot; were built in March and April after serial Metropolitan production ended. The final car had a VIN of A-HP7 150301. Total Austin Metropolitan production has been estimated at between 9,384 and 9,391 vehicles.

Metropolitans were sold new in right-hand-drive in New Zealand as a Nash. The models were not available in Australia.

==Epilogue==
The Metropolitan lost market appeal due to increasing competition from AMC&#x27;s own Rambler American models and newly introduced compact cars from the Big Three. The last Metropolitan body was made by Fisher &amp; Ludlow on 10 April 1961. US-bound Metropolitan production ended in April 1961, as a result of its &quot;marginal sales plus the fact that a four or five-passenger Rambler American could be purchased for only about $100 more&quot;.

The Metropolitan &quot;was a car that appealed to an eclectic mix of Americans&quot; because it was &quot;economical, yet a joy to drive,&quot; and it has been described as &quot;pure automotive whimsy.&quot; It also &quot;swam against nearly every current of American car design.&quot;

==Police market==
AMC marketed right-hand drive models to U.S. police departments for use in parking enforcement and other urban duties. Comparing the car to police motorcycles, an AMC brochure advertised superior all-weather protection, cost-effectiveness and storage space, and also the safety of single-unit construction.

The Franklin Mint produced a die-cast toy model of a 1956 Metropolitan in a police car version. Among its features are a police hat and handcuffs on the passenger&#x27;s seat, as well as a fire extinguisher on the floor.

==Astra-Gnome==
Industrial designer Richard Arbib designed the Astra-Gnome &quot;Time and Space Car,&quot; a design concept influenced by space travel forms. The vehicle was featured on the 3 September 1956 cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine and exhibited at the 1956 New York International Auto Show. Arbib modified a 1955 Nash Metropolitan and it was his vision of what an automobile would look like in the year 2000. Among the features were a &quot;celestial time-zone clock permitting actual flight-type navigation&quot;. The car is restored and kept at a museum in California.

==Metropolitan Club (AMC)==
Almost from the beginning of sales of the Metropolitan, American Motors received many letters and photographs from Metropolitan owners with stories of their good experiences with their cars. Some of these comments were used in later brochures for the Metropolitan. In January 1957, James W. Watson (AMC&#x27;s Sales Manager for the Metropolitan) initiated a &quot;Metropolitan Club&quot; to channel this enthusiasm and hopefully increase Metropolitan sales. He reasoned that personal recommendation was a powerful marketing tool.

All owners of Metropolitans could apply to join the club, and members received a membership card, membership certificate, and a metal badge to attach to their vehicle. Beginning in May 1957, a magazine called &quot;The Met Letter&quot; was sent out to members. Sixteen issues were produced from May 1957 (Volume 1, Number 1) to January 1962 (Volume 4, Number 3). The magazine consisted of articles and photographs submitted by members, as well as maintenance and editorial comments from American Motors. Members who recruited additional Metropolitan buyers were rewarded with a special gold anodized &quot;Metropolitan Club&quot; badge.

The club was disbanded around May 1962, when the supply of new Metropolitans was exhausted. Floyd Clymer, the motoring journalist and passionate supporter of the Metropolitan concept, attempted to keep the original Metropolitan Club active after that time.

==Legacy==


The &quot;Metropolitan&#x27;s staying power and its never-ending cuteness&quot; have earned it &quot;a place among the Greatest Cars of All Time&quot; in the opinion of automotive writer Jack Nerad, a former editor of &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine: &quot;No, the Metropolitan didn&#x27;t come from a top-of-the-line manufacturer. No, it doesn&#x27;t have a proud racing history. And, no, it wasn&#x27;t built in huge numbers. But [it] possesses an ageless, cuddly quality that has made it a perennial favorite of car lovers and car agnostics alike.&quot; Nerad added: &quot;If you wanted to ... wring the Met through its paces, you would be rewarded with a 0–60 miles per hour acceleration time of nearly 30 seconds. The Met was reasonably light at approximately 1800 pounds, but that weight was squared off against 42 horsepower.&quot;

In the opinion of syndicated auto journalist and author Bill Vance, the Metropolitan &quot;was quite a stylish little car&quot; that was &quot;ahead of its time&quot; and performed well against its competition.

Brian Sewell cites the version as the one &quot;now perversely recognized as a collector&#x27;s car&quot;. He wrote that the Metropolitan is &quot;worth a moment&#x27;s consideration, for in the history of the post-war American car industry it was the only genuine attempt to provide the market there with a mass-produced small, cheap car that could hold its own in urban traffic and slot into parking spaces far too small for even the smallest Ford or Chevrolet ... [but] the steering, dreadfully hampered by the enclosure of the front wheels, is so insensitive, and the turning circle so wide, that parking is a wretched business, the slack response of the huge steering-wheel a feature common in lumbering U.S. cars of the period.&quot;

By British standards, it looked &quot;awful&quot;, according to &quot;Autocar&quot;, but Nash was &quot;very pleased with it&quot;.

In 1961, the British auto magazine &quot;The Autocar&quot; tested a 1959 model whose odometer showed , and recorded a &quot;reasonable&quot; cruising speed of 60 mph, &quot;fairly high&quot; oil consumption of 125 miles per pint, &quot;adequately good&quot; road-holding, &quot;pronounced understeer&quot; in cornering, &quot;good directional stability,&quot; &quot;decidedly vague steering,&quot; a turning circle that was &quot;stately for such a small car,&quot; brakes that were &quot;effective,&quot; and remarked on the &quot;unnecessarily high position of the steering-wheel,&quot; which interfered with the driver&#x27;s view of the road. The test car accelerated from 0–60 mph in 22.4 seconds, and its time for the standing-start quarter-mile was 21.9 seconds.

Metropolitans have the very soft ride preferred by Americans at the time instead of the firmer suspension preferred in Europe. Markedly American, the styling was considered outlandish compared with the more sober British-styled models in the British Motor Corporation lineup. Brian Sewell commented in 2007 that the car was &quot;damned&quot; in England &quot;as a preposterous aberration incorporating the worst of everything American&quot;.

One marque enthusiast says that Nash&#x27;s subcompact was &quot;the Smart car of the &#x27;50s&quot;. Although his Metropolitan is unsuitable for long journeys owing to &quot;a lot of wind noise and really poor suspension,&quot; it can cruise at and has a top speed of . Parts are &quot;relatively easy&quot; to obtain, and the car is &quot;easy to work on&quot;.

Ken Gross, a director of the Petersen Automotive Museum, noted that &quot;the softly sprung Met wallows like most larger American cars of its day,&quot; and he has warned against &quot;rust, especially in the floor pan and lower fenders,&quot; and &quot;electrical gremlins&quot;. British-made mechanical parts were available on the unspecified date of his article&#x27;s publication, but he said that sheet metal was &quot;a challenge&quot;.

Sewell advises buying the open version in &quot;as late a model as you can (it ceased production in 1961)this has slightly more panache, and with the hood down, it&#x27;s much easier to load [at the supermarket]&quot;.

&quot;While there are still good deals to be had on Metropolitans, their values have quietly but sharply escalated in the last five years while other 1960s American collector cars have leveled off or simply remained flat ... Parts and support are not a problem with these cars; returning all the waves and smiles you&#x27;ll get driving a Met can be tiring.&quot;

There are active clubs for Metropolitan owners and enthusiasts. New, used, and reproduction examples of various parts and accessories are available. Some owners modify their Metropolitans. More extreme modifications have included conversion into a pickup truck, station wagon, stretch limousine, and installation of a V8 engine. A conversion into a &quot;Metro-Sled&quot; features a rear-mounted snowmobile engine driving twin tracks. Some cars that were initially hardtops have been converted to convertibles; however, cars built as convertibles had chassis stiffeners as well as a different wedge and secondary catch for the doors.

<doc id="897091" wikidata="Q249083" url="?curid=897091" title="Asteroid family">
<text>An asteroid family is a population of asteroids that share similar proper orbital elements, such as semimajor axis, eccentricity, and orbital inclination. The members of the families are thought to be fragments of past asteroid collisions. An asteroid family is a more specific term than asteroid group whose members, while sharing some broad orbital characteristics, may be otherwise unrelated to each other.

==General properties==
Large prominent families contain several hundred recognized asteroids (and many more smaller objects which may be either not-yet-analyzed, or not-yet-discovered). Small, compact families may have only about ten identified members. About 33% to 35% of asteroids in the main belt are family members.

There are about 20 to 30 reliably recognized families, with several tens of less certain groupings. Most asteroid families are found in the main asteroid belt, although several family-like groups such as the Pallas family, Hungaria family, and the Phocaea family lie at smaller semi-major axis or larger inclination than the main belt.

One family has been identified associated with the dwarf planet . Some studies have tried to find evidence of collisional families among the trojan asteroids, but at present the evidence is inconclusive.

==Origin and evolution==
The families are thought to form as a result of collisions between asteroids. In many or most cases the parent body was shattered, but there are also several families which resulted from a large cratering event which did not disrupt the parent body (e.g. the Vesta, Pallas, Hygiea, and Massalia families). Such &quot;cratering families&quot; typically consist of a single large body and a swarm of asteroids that are much smaller. Some families (e.g. the Flora family) have complex internal structures which are not satisfactorily explained at the moment, but may be due to several collisions in the same region at different times.

Due to the method of origin, all the members have closely matching compositions for most families. Notable exceptions are those families (such as the Vesta family) which formed from a large differentiated parent body.

Asteroid families are thought to have lifetimes of the order of a billion years, depending on various factors (e.g. smaller asteroids are lost faster). This is significantly shorter than the Solar System&#x27;s age, so few if any are relics of the early Solar System. Decay of families occurs both because of slow dissipation of the orbits due to perturbations from Jupiter or other large bodies, and because of collisions between asteroids which grind them down to small bodies. Such small asteroids then become subject to perturbations such as the Yarkovsky effect that can push them towards orbital resonances with Jupiter over time. Once there, they are relatively rapidly ejected from the asteroid belt. Tentative age estimates have been obtained for some families, ranging from hundreds of millions of years to less than several million years as for the compact Karin family. Old families are thought to contain few small members, and this is the basis of the age determinations.

It is supposed that many very old families have lost all the smaller and medium-sized members, leaving only a few of the largest intact. A suggested example of such old family remains are the 9 Metis and 113 Amalthea asteroid pair. Further evidence for a large number of past families (now dispersed) comes from analysis of chemical ratios in iron meteorites. These show that there must have once been at least 50 to 100 parent bodies large enough to be differentiated, that have since been shattered to expose their cores and produce the actual meteorites (Kelley &amp; Gaffey 2000).

== Identification of members, interlopers and background asteroids ==
When the orbital elements of main belt asteroids are plotted (typically inclination vs. eccentricity, or vs. semi-major axis), a number of distinct concentrations are seen against the rather uniform distribution of non-family background asteroids. These concentrations are the asteroid families &quot;(see above)&quot;. Interlopers are asteroids classified as family members based on their so-called proper orbital elements but having spectroscopic properties distinct from the bulk of the family, suggesting that they, contrary to the true family members, did not originate from the same parent body that once fragmented upon a collisional impact.

=== Description ===
Strictly speaking, families and their membership are identified by analysing the proper orbital elements rather than the current osculating orbital elements, which regularly fluctuate on timescales of tens of thousands of years. The &quot;proper elements&quot; are related constants of motion that remain almost constant for at least tens of millions of years, and perhaps longer.

The Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama (1874–1943) pioneered the estimation of proper elements for asteroids, and first identified several of the most prominent families in 1918. In his honor, asteroid families are sometimes called Hirayama families. This particularly applies to the five prominent groupings discovered by him.

==== Hierarchical clustering method ====
Present day computer-assisted searches have identified more than a hundred asteroid families. The most prominent algorithms have been the hierarchical clustering method (HCM), which looks for groupings with small nearest-neighbour distances in orbital element space, and wavelet analysis, which builds a density-of-asteroids map in orbital element space, and looks for density peaks.

The boundaries of the families are somewhat vague because at the edges they blend into the background density of asteroids in the main belt. For this reason the number of members even among discovered asteroids is usually only known approximately, and membership is uncertain for asteroids near the edges.

Additionally, some interlopers from the heterogeneous background asteroid population are expected even in the central regions of a family. Since the true family members caused by the collision are expected to have similar compositions, most such interlopers can in principle be recognised by spectral properties which do not match those of the bulk of family members. A prominent example is 1 Ceres, the largest asteroid, which is an interloper in the family once named after it (the Ceres family, now the Gefion family).

Spectral characteristics can also be used to determine the membership (or otherwise) of asteroids in the outer regions of a family, as has been used e.g. for the Vesta family, whose members have an unusual composition.

==Family types==

As previously mentioned, families caused by an impact that did not disrupt the parent body but only ejected fragments are called &quot;cratering families&quot;. Other terminology has been used to distinguish various types of groups which are less distinct or less statistically certain from the most prominent &quot;nominal families&quot; (or &quot;clusters&quot;).

=== Clusters, clumps, clans and tribes ===

The term &quot;cluster&quot; is also used to describe a small asteroid family, such as the Karin cluster. &quot;Clumps&quot; are groupings which have relatively few members but are clearly distinct from the background (e.g. the Juno clump). &quot;Clans&quot; are groupings which merge very gradually into the background density and/or have a complex internal structure making it difficult to decide whether they are one complex group or several unrelated overlapping groups (e.g. the Flora family has been called a clan). &quot;Tribes&quot; are groups that are less certain to be statistically significant against the background either because of small density or large uncertainty in the orbital parameters of the members.

== List ==

=== Prominent families ===

Among the many asteroid families, the Eos, Eunomia, Flora, Hungaria, Hygiea, Koronis, Nysa, Themis and Vesta families are the most prominent ones in the asteroid belt. For a complete list, &quot;see &quot;.

; Eos family
:The Eos family (&quot;adj. Eoan&quot;; 9,789 members, named after 221 Eos) 
;Eunomia family
:The Eunomia family (&quot;adj. Eunomian&quot;; 5,670 known members, named after 15 Eunomia) is a family of S-type asteroids. It is the most prominent family in the intermediate asteroid belt and the 6th-largest family with approximately 1.4% of all main belt asteroids.
;Flora family
:The Flora family (&quot;adj. Florian&quot;; 13,786 members, named after 8 Flora) is the 3rd-largest family. Broad in extent, it has no clear boundary and gradually fades into the surrounding background population. Several distinct groupings within the family, possibly created by later, secondary collisions. It has also been described as an asteroid clan. 
; Hungaria family
:The Hungaria family (&quot;adj. Hungarian&quot;; 2,965 members, named after 434 Hungaria) 
;Hygiea family
:The Hygiea family (&quot;adj. Hygiean&quot;; 4,854 members, named after 10 Hygiea)
; Koronis family
:The Koronis family (&quot;adj. Koronian&quot;; 5,949 members, named after 158 Koronis)
; Nysa family
:The Nysa family (&quot;adj. Nysian&quot;; 19,073 members, named after 44 Nysa). Alternatively named Hertha family after 135 Hertha.
; Themis family
:The Themis family (&quot;adj. Themistian&quot;; 4,782 members, named after 24 Themis)
; Vesta family
:The Vesta family (&quot;adj. Vestian&quot;; 15,252 members, named after 4 Vesta)

=== All families ===
In 2015, a study identified 122 notable families with a total of approximately 100,000 member asteroids, based on the entire catalog of numbered minor planets, which consisted of almost 400,000 numbered bodies at the time &quot;(see catalog index for a current listing of numbered minor planets)&quot;. The data has been made available at the &quot;Small Bodies Data Ferret&quot;. The first column of this table contains the family identification number or &quot;family identifier number&quot; (FIN), which is an attempt for a numerical labeling of identified families, independent of their currently used name, as a family&#x27;s name may change with refined observations, leading to multiple names used in literature and to subsequent confusion.

<doc id="897095" wikidata="Q7572561" url="?curid=897095" title="Space and survival">
<text>Space and survival is the idea that the long-term survival of the human species and technological civilization requires the building of a spacefaring civilization that utilizes the resources of outer space, and that not doing this might lead to human extinction. A related observation is that the window of opportunity for doing this may be limited due to the decreasing amount of surplus resources that will be available over time as a result of an ever-growing population.

The earliest appearance of a connection between space exploration and human survival appears in Louis J. Halle, Jr.&#x27;s 1980 article in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, in which he stated colonization of space will keep humanity safe should global nuclear warfare occur. This idea has received more attention in recent years as advancing technology in the form of reusable launch vehicles and combination launch systems make affordable space travel more feasible.

==Risk to humanity==
Existential risk are risks of human extinction or similarly severe and irreversible outcome. According to the Future of Humanity Institute, &quot;humanity&#x27;s long track record of surviving natural hazards suggests that, measured on a timescale of a few centuries, the existential risk posed by such hazards is rather small. The great bulk of existential risk in the foreseeable future is &quot;anthropogenic&quot;; that is, arising from human activity.&quot; Toby Ord argues in &quot;The Precipice&quot; that some such risks include unaligned artificial general intelligence, pandemics (notably from bioterrorism), catastrophic climate change, and global nuclear warfare. He views these as more likely than natural existential risks, such as from supervolcano eruptions or meteor impacts.

Some such catastrophes would ruin Earth&#x27;s biosphere as well. Although many have speculated about life and intelligence existing in other parts of space, Earth is the only place in the universe known to harbor life. Eventually the Earth will become uninhabitable, at the latest when the Sun becomes a red giant in about 5 billion years. Humankind, or its intelligent descendants, if they still exist at that point, must leave the Solar System long before that to ensure survival of the human species.

==Space settlement==
Human extinction can be prevented by strengthening the physical barrier, or increasing the mean distance, between people and the potential extinction event. For example, pandemics are controlled by placing exposed people in quarantine and evacuating healthy people away. The human lineage of genus &quot;Homo&quot; has reduced from several species co-existing on Earth to just one — all others became extinct before the end of the last Ice age. This illustrates that &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; is not immune to planetary disaster and that human survival may be better assured through the colonization of space.

Although space colonies do not yet exist, humans have had a continuous space presence since 2000 in the form of the International Space Station. Life support systems that enable people to live in space may also allow them to survive hazardous events.

===Multiple locations===
Expanding the living area of the human species increases the mean distance between humans and any known hazardous event. People closest to the event are most likely to be killed or injured; people farthest from the event are most likely to survive. Increasing the number of places where humans live also helps to prevent extinction. For example, if a massive impact event occurred on Earth without warning, the human species could possibly become extinct; its art, culture and technology would be lost. However, if humans had previously colonized locations outside Earth, the opportunities for the survival and recovery of the species would be greater.

===Objections===
Many challenges arise when travelling in outer space. One of the biggest issues that may affect the human body is interstellar radiation. While the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and atmosphere protects all living forms on the planet, this cannot be said for outer space. According to researchers from the University of Rochester Medical Center, a radiation equivalent to a mission to Mars can cause serious brain damage such as cognition problems and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Space science==
The observation and study of space protects Earth, as space hazards can be seen in advance and, if discovered early enough, acted against.

===Near-Earth objects===
Near-Earth objects (NEOs) are asteroids, comets and large meteoroids that come close to or collide with Earth. Spaceguard is the collective name for some of the efforts to discover and study NEOs, though these efforts are not sufficiently funded.

==Critique==

Some more contemporary reasons for space as a solution to survival have been identified as imperialist reasoning for space exploration, only relocating collective shortcomings and not solving them.

<text>Arica ( ; ) is a commune and a port city with a population of 222,619 in the Arica Province of northern Chile&#x27;s Arica y Parinacota Region. It is Chile&#x27;s northernmost city, being located only south of the border with Peru. The city is the capital of both the Arica Province and the Arica and Parinacota Region. Arica is located at the bend of South America&#x27;s western coast known as the Arica Bend or Arica Elbow. At the location of the city are two valleys that dissect the Atacama Desert converge: Azapa and Lluta. These valleys provide citrus and olives for export.

Arica is an important port for a large inland region of South America. The city serves a free port for Bolivia and manages a substantial part of that country&#x27;s trade. In addition it is the end station of the Bolivian oil pipeline beginning in Oruro. The city&#x27;s strategic position is enhanced by being next to the Pan-American Highway, being connected to both Tacna in Peru and La Paz in Bolivia by railroad and being served by an international airport.

Arica has an extremely dry climate, with almost no rainfall. Even so, the frequent maritime winds from the cold waters nearby renders a moderate desert climate. Its mild weather has made Arica known as the &quot;city of the eternal spring&quot; in Chile while its beaches are frequented by Bolivian society. The city was an important port already during Spanish colonial rule. Chile seized the city from Peru in 1880 during the War of the Pacific, being recognized as Chilean by Peru in 1929. A substantial part of African Chileans live in or trace their origins to Arica.

==History==
Archaeological findings indicate that Arica was inhabited by different native groups dating back 10,000 years. These people are the first known culture to mummify their dead, predating the Egyptians by 2,000 years, and their mummies have been discovered as recently as 2004 and buried as shallow as &lt;1 meter beneath the city&#x27;s surface.

===Colonial period===
Spaniards settled the land under captain Lucas Martinez de Begazo in 1541, and in 1570, the area was grandly retitled as &quot;La Muy Ilustre y Real Ciudad San Marcos de Arica&quot; (the very illustrious and royal city of San Marcos of Arica). By 1545, Arica was the main export entrepot for Bolivian silver coming down from Potosí, which then possessed the world&#x27;s largest silver mine. Arica thus held a crucial role as one of the leading ports of the Spanish Empire. These enviable riches made Arica the target for pirates, buccaneers, and privateers, among whom Francis Drake, Thomas Cavendish, Richard Hawkins, Joris van Spilbergen, John Watling, Baltazar de Cordes, Bartholomew Sharp, William Dampier, and John Clipperton all took part in looting the city.

===Peruvian period (1821–1880)===
Following the collapse of Spanish rule, in 1821, Arica was part of the recently independent Peruvian Republic. The Peruvian Constitution of 1823 regards it as a province of the Department of Arequipa. In 1855, Peru inaugurated the Arica-Tacna railroad (53 km long), one of the first in Latin America. The rail line still functions today.

The earthquake of August 13, 1868 struck near the city with an estimated magnitude of 8.0 to 9.0 Estimates on the death toll vary greatly, some estimates have the number at 25,000 to 70,000 people. Others estimate that the population of Arica was less than 3,000 people and the death toll was around 300. It triggered a tsunami, measurable across the Pacific in Hawaii, Japan and New Zealand. As Arica lies very close to the subduction zone known as the Peru–Chile Trench where the Nazca Plate dives beneath the South American Plate, the city is subject to megathrust earthquakes.

===Chilenization period (1880–1929)===
Chilean forces occupied the region following the War of the Pacific. The Treaty of Ancón in 1883 formally acceded the region to Chilean control. The 1929 Tacna-Arica compromise in the Treaty of Lima subsequently restored Tacna to Peru but Arica remained part of Chile.

===Modern Arica (1929–present)===
In 1958, the Chilean Government established the &quot;Junta de Adelanto de Arica&quot; (Board of Development for Arica), which promulgated many tax incentives for the establishment of industries, such as vehicle assembly plants, a tax-free zone, and a casino, among others.
Many car manufacturers opened plants in Arica, such as Citroën, Peugeot, Volvo, Ford and General Motors, which produced the Chevrolet LUV pickup until 2008.

In 1975, together with Chile&#x27;s new open economy policies, the &quot;Junta de Adelanto de Arica&quot; was abolished.

The Arica and Parinacota Region was created on October 8, 2007, under Law 20.175, promulgated on March 23, 2007, by President Michelle Bachelet in the city of Arica.

===Promel toxic waste dumpsite===
In 1984-1985, the Swedish metal company Boliden Mineral AB paid a local mineral extracting company, Promel Ldta., 10 million SEK ($1.2 million, $3.15 million in 2021 dollars) to receive, treat and confine around 20,000 tonnes of smeltery sludge from Rönnskärsverken in Skellefteå, containing among other things high levels of lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury and iron and smaller amounts of gold and silver. To earn additional income, Promel planned to extract various substances from the waste at its processing plant at Sitio F in the outskirts of Arica. The end products were mainly raw arsenic and iron-silver-gold oxides. The first shipment arrived in Arica in August 1984 and the processing of 500 kg test batches in October 1984 gave positive results with oversight from an official from the Chilean Health Authority in Santiago. After the sludge processing had begun at large scale and the third and last shipment of sludge arrived to Promel&#x27;s plant in Arica in July 1985, contact between Boliden and Promel ceased.

In the late 1980s, Promel ceased all activities at Sitio F for unknown reasons and abandoned the remaining 10,000 tons of the highly toxic smelting sludge out in the open exposed to the elements. The area surrounding the plant was later used by the local authorities to build state-sponsored social housing aimed at low-income families. No physical barrier between the former plant and the residential area existed at the time. Residents of the new neighborhood had no knowledge about the contents of the sludge at the site, which became used as a playground by children.

In the 1990s, many residents around the former plant began to show symptoms of lead and arsenic poisoning. In 1998, the Chilean authorities ordered Promel to move the toxic waste. Promel moved the sludge to a walled area on the other side of a nearby hill and covered the material with a plastic mat. It was supposed to be a temporary storage site, yet the material remains there to this day. Cleanup of the remaining parts of Sitio F finished as late as 2010. Even after the removal of the sludge, the health effects on the local population continue to be devastating. Almost 8,000 residents were tested for toxic substances in 2010. Of the 6600 people that got results back from the Chilean Health Authority, 12.9% showed arsenic in their urine samples. Studies have found very high rates of arsenic related lung cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer and skin cancer in the local population. Other health effects include non-cancerous heart and lung diseases and fertility problems such as low birth weights and spontaneous miscarriages.

In 2013, 796 Arica residents, including human rights defenders, started legal action in Sweden against Boliden. The Court of Appeal for Northern Norrland held that the claims of the victims were time limited, and the Swedish Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

==Demography==

According to the 2017 census by the National Statistics Institute, Arica spans an area of and has 222,619 inhabitants (110,115 men and 112,504 women). The population grew by 20% (37,351 people) between the 2002 and 2017 censuses. Arica is home to 97.7% of the total population of the region.

The population of Arica is made up of various long-established groups in the region, and other more recent arrivals settled at differing times. Among the long-established groups, the oldest consists of indigenous Amerindians, such as the Aymara, whose presence in the region is of several millennia. These are followed by the second oldest, the local colonial-era groups, which includes local mestizos (of mixed Spanish-Amerindian origin), local criollos (whites of colonial Spanish origin), and local afrodescendants of colonial-era slaves. The third oldest group consists of early post-colonial Chinese Chileans who first arrived as miners and rail workers in the 1890s.

These long-established groups of Ariqueños have been augmented by various later settlers, mostly other criollos and mestizo Chileans from elsewhere around Chile, but also numerous Europeans, who arrived in the 1900s, including more Spaniards arriving from Spain, as well as Italians, Greeks, British, and French. These arrived at different times during the last century.

Some Ariqueños, primarily the indigenous Amerindians, but also the afro-descendants, share cultural affinities to counterpart populations in neighbouring border areas of Peru, and more distantly, Bolivia.

The urban area of Arica has 175,441 inhabitants in an area of 41.89 km2. Arica in 2007 had more than 185,000 inhabitants (not counting the inhabitants of the valleys and Lluta Azapa, with that reach almost to the 194.000 inhabitants). The growing city of Arica spreads outward into the desert and the Peru-Chile border. The Azapa Valley has developed a year-round agricultural economy due to improvements in irrigation and transportation of its products.

The villages that make up the commune are Villa Frontera and San Miguel de Azapa. Some hamlets are Poconchile, Molinas, Sora, Las Maitas and Caleta Vitor.

Arica was made famous in 1970 by the spiritual master Oscar Ichazo when he held a 10-month training there for 50 North Americans from the Esalen Institute in California. The Arica School, based in the United States of America, has influenced thousands of people all over the world.

The commune of Arica is composed of 19 census districts.


===Notable residents===

== Economics ==
Arica is the economical powerhouse of its region. It is an enormous trade and shipping point and vital for the maritimal access of Bolivia.

==Features==
The &quot;Morro de Arica&quot; is a tall, nearly-vertical rock formation and hill located in the city, situated approximately 139 meters above sea level. It was the last bulwark of defense for the Peruvian troops who garrisoned the city. It was attacked and captured on 7 June 1880 by Chilean troops, as the final effort of their &quot;Campaña del Desierto&quot; (Desert Campaign) during the War of the Pacific.

Near to the city center is the Azapa Valley, an oasis where vegetables and, famously, Azapa olives are grown. Economically, it is also an important port for Chilean ore. The semi-tropical latitude, combined with the low humidity and the city&#x27;s beaches, have made Arica a popular tourist destination. It is also a center of Chilean rail networks with Bolivia. For air travel, the region is serviced by Chacalluta International Airport.

Arica has strong ties with the city of Tacna, Peru. Many people cross the border daily as they travel between the two cities, partially due to the many services (for example, dentists, doctors, etc.) that are cheaper in Peru. Arica is connected to both Tacna and to La Paz via separate railroad lines.
==Climate==

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Arica has a hot desert climate, abbreviated &quot;BWh&quot; on climate maps. Unlike many other cities with arid climates, Arica seldom sees extreme temperatures throughout the course of the year and it is also relatively overcast. Arica is also known as the driest inhabited place on Earth, at least as measured by rainfall: average annual precipitation is 0.76 mm (0.03 inches), as measured at the airport meteorological station.
==Administration==
As a commune, Arica is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008–2012 alcalde is Waldo Sankán Martínez (Independent).

Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Arica is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Mr. Vlado Mirosevic (Partido Liberal) and Mr. Luis Rocaful as part of the 1st electoral district, which includes the entire Arica and Parinacota Region. The commune is represented in the Senate by José Miguel Insulza (PS, 2018–2026) and José Durana (UDI, 2018–2026) as part of the 1st senatorial constituency (Arica and Parinacota Region and Tarapacá Region).

==Sports==
Arica was one of the four host cities of the 1962 FIFA World Cup, and it was the venue for a Rip Curl Pro Search surfing event that took place from June 20 to July 1, 2007.
Arica plays host to a leg of the International Bodyboarding Association&#x27;s world tour event every year at the notorious &quot;el flops&quot; surf break. The event has been running since 2004.

==Tourist attractions==
#Morro de Arica: the prominent mount rising above the city, affording sweeping views.
#Catedral de San Marcos de Arica: the magnificent church designed by Gustave Eiffel was built in the 1870s. 
#Plaza Colón: the civic heart of the city, the public square is where its residents congregate for celebrations, diversions or just being a part of the community.

Other attractions include the former house of the Governor, the Former Arica Custom House, railway station Arica-La Paz, the Archaeological and Anthropological Museum of San Miguel de Azapa, Sea and Historical Arms and Arica. For evening entertainment there is the Casino de Arica.

===Beaches===
More than 20 km of beaches, many known for the quality of surfing, span across the Coastal Range in the northern sector. The harbored location makes these beaches unique from other cities in Chile in terms of topography.

From north to south the beaches are located Las Machas, Chinchorro, del Alacrán, El Laucho, La Lisera, Brava, Arenillas Negras, La Capilla, Corazones and La Liserilla.

===Other tourist sites===

*Chungará Lake: Arica is the main access road to the lake, the 29th highest in the world (and the 10th highest in South America), with an approximate height of 4517 metres. It is located within the Lauca National Park.
*Pucará de Copaquilla: about 3,000 metres above sea level, dates from the 12th century, declared National Monument, located on a promontory that serves as the defence has a double stone wall, which protects a series of internal spaces. From this point it is possible to observe the pre-and streams.
*Termas de Jurasi a few miles southeast of Putre, by Ruta 11-CH, turning off a dirt road. Underground waters are home to temperatures above which are reputed to have medicinal properties.
*Surf Arica is a world-famous spot for surfing. The wave known as &quot;El Gringo&quot; hosts surfing and bodyboarding world championships every year. In 2007, Arica was the site for an ASP world tour contest. Others stops on this tour include Hawaii, Tahiti, Fiji and South Africa.

== Transport ==

Passenger train services on the Arica–La Paz railway ceased in 1996, but as of 2017 there were proposals to restart services from Arica as a tourist attraction (and for freight).

In 2011, Chile announced plans to privatise the Port of Arica. These were opposed by Bolivia, as Arica is its main sea port.

Chacalluta International Airport is the main airport in Arica and is located 18.5 km north of the city. LATAM Chile, Amaszonas, JetSmart, and Sky Airline have scheduled commercial service to several Chilean airports.

<text>A fill trestle or filling trestle is a temporary construction trestle that is built to provide a scaffolding for the placement of fill or an earthen dam. Typically, the trestle is built across the valley and a railway is laid across the trestle. Specially designed side-dumping railroad cars filled with earth or gravel are pushed onto it and dumped, burying the trestle. Typically, a fill trestle is constructed out of wood which remains buried in the fill and eventually decomposes. Advances in construction technology, particularly the development of the dump truck, have rendered the fill trestle technique obsolete.

<text>The Latter Day Church of Christ (LDCC) or Davis County Cooperative Society (DCCS) is a Mormon fundamentalist denomination within the Latter Day Saint movement. The DCCS was established in 1935 by Elden Kingston, son of Charles W. Kingston, and in 1977 members of the DCCS organized the Latter Day Church of Christ. Media outlets often refer to the organization as the Kingston Group, and internally it is known as &quot;the Order&quot; or &quot;the Co-op&quot;.

There are approximately 3,500 members, some of whom are known to practice polygamy. The current leader is Paul Elden Kingston.

==Establishment==

Historians and other scholars who have studied the group have identified several doctrinal and socio-economic factors leading to its establishment. These factors originated in the family of Elden Kingston, his father Charles Kingston, and other family members or closely-affiliated people, many of whom were originally members of the LDS Church. Doctrinally, they fell out with the Church on two issues: the consecration of wealth, and plural marriage.

According to his autobiography, Charles W. Kingston became disenchanted with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1926 because it abandoned plural marriage. Kingston began preaching polygamy amongst fellow members of the LDS Church and distributing pamphlets and the book he had co-written, &quot;Laman Manasseh Victorious: A Message of Salvation and Redemption to His People Israel, First to Ephraim and Manasseh&quot;. This resulted in his excommunication from the LDS Church in 1928.

Charles W. Kingston eventually converted his son Elden to his beliefs and on January 1, 1935, Elden along with his two wives, Ethel Gustafson and Afton Brown took steps to officially begin the cooperative in Bountiful, Utah. From 1935 to 1940, Elden Kingston&#x27;s followers, including his father Charles W. Kingston, began to move to Bountiful, Utah, intending to live under a United Order communal program as defined by Joseph Smith in the Doctrine and Covenants.

On September 19, 1941, the community founded by Elden Kingston officially filed for recognition with the State of Utah as the Davis County Cooperative Society Inc. The corporation produces goods and services that are used by members, and sold or traded to other cooperatives and to the public. In 1977, Elden&#x27;s brother Ortell Kingston began to file for legal recognition of the church later organized as The Latter Day Church of Christ.

The Latter Day Church of Christ is based in Salt Lake City, Utah, with a presence in Bountiful, Utah.

==Business activities==

The organization owns an extensive portfolio of business and land assets throughout the western United States, including a dairy farm in Davis County; a farm in Tetonia, Idaho; a coal mine in Emery County; in Terreton, Idaho; discount and grocery stores; Desert Tech Firearms; and a restaurant supply company. A 2004 estimate put the value of these assets at more than $200 million, while ethnographer Janet Bennion estimated a value of $150 million in 2011.

The organization is tight-lipped about their business activities. Some of their secrecy might be attributed to a fear of arrest for living in plural marriages, as had happened in 1959–1960 when being investigated by the Davis County Grand Jury, which some members claimed was organized by LDS Apostles Mark E. Peterson and Spencer W. Kimball. The Grand Jury was described as &quot;The polygamist hunting Davis County Grand Jury&quot; by the Ogden Standard-Examiner in 1959. That same year, Ardous Kingston Gustafson, a mother of four and founding Co-op member, was jailed on Christmas Eve when she could not produce membership lists used to further the court&#x27;s investigation into charges of cohabitation.

The Cooperative had its birth during the Great Depression when many families struggled immensely to provide for their families. For many years, members of the Cooperative lived in poor conditions, and had no legal way to apply for assistance. 

Long-time leader John Ortell Kingston lived in a small one-story clapboard house in Salt Lake City up until the time of his death in 1987. J. Ortell Kingston aggressively pursued a financially-expansive agenda for the Davis County Cooperative Society Inc. in the hopes of improving the financial condition of his followers.

Since the mid-1990s, many members have become college-educated and live in middle-to-upper-middle-class homes throughout their communities. Currently the group claims that although different skillsets bring different financial outcomes, there is no homelessness within the DCCS, and internal programs exist for those experiencing financial poverty.

==Beliefs==
The Latter Day Church of Christ is based on a belief in Jesus Christ and the restoration of his gospel in these latter days. It is not affiliated with the mainstream LDS Church. Doctrinally, members of the LDCJC try to adhere to the teachings of the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Members of the Latter Day Church of Christ are also members of the Davis County Cooperative Society (a separate organization and legal entity) which practices the law of consecration and United Order. Some members had begun the practice of plural marriage years before the establishment of the cooperative.

During the first years of the Davis County Cooperative Society, Elden Kingston and his followers wore unique blue denim outer garments that led to people referring to them as &quot;blue-coats.&quot; Men and boys wore blue coverall-type suits tied with strings; women and girls wore plain blue denim dresses. As a symbol of their renunciation of worldly goods, the outer clothing contained no pockets in which possessions could be carried, although later an inside pocket was provided for the sanitary measure of carrying a handkerchief. All went bareheaded and barefoot. This practice was abandoned sometime before 1940. Members today wear normal modern clothing, although they are encouraged to be modest and keep a high standard of dress.

According to a 2011 document prepared by attorneys general Mark Shurtleff and Tom Horne, members of the DCCS describe it as emphasizing family values, education, self-sufficiency, and the belief that every child is a priceless blessing. Children are allowed to attend public school and many go on to college. Former members leaving the group in the 1980s and 1990s allege that some were paid in &quot;units&quot; instead of money and that many of their life decisions were made for them. Some members also claim there is an &quot;inner circle&quot; who are entitled to more wives and better jobs.

In 2016, some members of the LDCC helped start Vanguard Academy charter school in West Valley, which continues to operate today. Many high school aged children from the LDCC are believed to attend the school.

==Controversies==

===Consanguineous marriages===

Plural marriage is practiced by some members of the LDCJC and &quot;members are free to choose their marriage partner or partners, as marriage is considered an individual&#x27;s or family&#x27;s personal choice,&quot; according to author Craig Foster in his book &quot;American Polygamy&quot; (2019). After two decades of raids from law enforcement from 1935 to 1957, it is believed some members of the church began to practice consanguineous marriage between relatives. This practice has been attributed to &quot;endogamous preference and the small size of the group’s population&quot; according to active members and recent research from the University of Santa Clara California (2019). The group claims no preference for any particular family or surname stating members join every year &quot;from a variety of different backgrounds and surnames.&quot;

In the late 1990s, three members of the LDCJC faced scrutiny for entering into incestuous relationships.

These cases included:
* Jason Kingston had a relationship with his half-sister Andrea Johnson, who became pregnant in 1992. She suffered from preeclampsia before being brought in for medical treatment. A C-section was performed to save the baby, but Andrea died. Salt Lake County officials opened an investigation into the possibility that obstetrical care was withheld to conceal the relationship.
* Jeremy Kingston was sentenced to a year in prison in 2004 for entering a relationship with LuAnn Kingston, his cousin and aunt, as his fourth wife in 1994; their relationship began when he was 24 and she was 15.
* David Kingston married his 16-year-old niece Mary Ann Nelson, who attempted to run away but was apprehended and beaten by her father, John Daniel Kingston. He was arrested and pleaded &quot;no contest&quot; to the charge of child abuse and served seven months in jail. David Kingston was convicted of incest and unlawful sexual conduct and sentenced to a 10-year prison term, of which he served four years. Mary Ann later filed a $110-million lawsuit against other members of the Cooperative, alleging intentional sexual abuse of a child and intentional infliction of emotional distress, but the lawsuit was eventually dropped without any settlement.
These relationships are defined as incestuous according to Utah&#x27;s Criminal Code 76-7-102 (2021).

Kathrine Nichols filed a federal lawsuit in January 2025 against the church, the Davis County Cooperative, her parents, grandparents, great-uncle, as well as her uncle who is also her ex-husband. Nichols alleges that they &quot;brainwashed and coerced her into an underage, abusive and bigamous marriage to her uncle&quot;. The lawsuit accuses the group of being a &quot;racketeering enterprise, hate group, and corrupted polygamous cult&quot;.

===Underaged marriage===
Members of the LDCC have faced two lawsuits, one in 2006 and one in 2022 accusing members of sexual abuses and underaged marriages. The 2022 complaint was filed by attorney and TV producer Roger Hoole. In 2009, the then-Attorney General of Utah, Mark Shurtleff, claimed that child marriages within polygamous societies in Utah, such as the Latter Day Church of Christ, had &quot;effectively stopped&quot;. The latest suit takes issue with alleged marriages as young as 16 within the Latter Day Church of Christ. Current Utah law allows individuals 16 and 17 years of age to marry with court approval. In February 2023, the 2022 lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed in State Court with attorneys for the plaintiffs promising to re-file a similar case in Federal Court. Attorney Roger Hoole re-filed a similar case in federal court in March 2024 alleging racketeering in addition to some of the same allegations in the previously dismissed lawsuit from State Court.

The LDCC continues to publicly denounce the practice of child marriage, and maintains that marriages within the group are not coerced. In 2007, the group told &quot;Deseret News&quot; that it was encouraging its members to wait until their partners were 18 to marry them, with one member reporting that &quot;we do encourage them to be 18&quot;. Responding to child marriage allegations in September 2022, the organization told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;current policy prohibits plural marriage for members under 18&quot; and &quot;once an individual has made a decision on who to marry, members are encouraged to seek the blessing of their parents, family and/or church leaders, but to say that one individual chooses or heavily influences who will marry who is entirely inaccurate&quot;.

===Financial fraud===
In 2016, the State of Utah with federal law enforcement raided various properties in connection with the Kingston family or Davis County Cooperative Society with the intention of finding welfare fraud. The State of Utah stated: &quot;It was a specific investigation that we were approached by [federal law enforcement] to participate in.&quot; After two years of investigating, they did not find any welfare fraud. &quot;State investigators found no wrongdoing among members of the Davis County Cooperative Society, also known as the Kingston Group.&quot; Members claim they have been broadly and unfairly targeted by authorities for the negative actions of a small few. Members allege to have been targeted for audit at a rate over nine times the published IRS average for the general population, with no pattern of fraud being found outside of a couple of bad-actors.

In July 2019, Jacob Kingston, Isaiah Kingston, and two others pled guilty to participating in a fraud scheme masterminded by Lev Dermen, a non-member and Armenian national. The scheme included filing for $512 million in federal renewable-fuel tax credits from 2010 to 2016 through a company named Washakie Renewable Energy LLC. One of the guilty pleas states they &quot;cycled&quot; fraud proceeds through a number of international partners and then back to Washakie&#x27;s bank accounts, falsely claiming them as loans or profits. A small portion of the funds (less than 6%) were also used to purchase legitimate goods and services from businesses who provided them in &quot;good faith&quot;. Legitimate businesses, including those in the Cooperative, argued that Jacob hid the scheme from business partners as well as Co-op leadership. The remainder of the transactions (over 94%) were to entities associated with Lev Dermen, who prosecutors allege was the mastermind of the scheme. Dermen was found guilty of masterminding the scheme in March 2020. As part of the plea deal and restitution, the company forfeits rights to a number of assets including their bio-fuel plant in Plymouth, Utah. WRE has since become defunct.

Davis County Cooperative leadership and members swiftly condemned the fraudulent behavior stating that &quot;[Jacob] broke from tradition in many ways&quot; and stressing &quot;to members and non-members alike that this behavior is not in line with our beliefs or principles.&quot; And, &quot;We cannot and will not condone or support anyone found to be engaged in any fraudulent behaviors.&quot; In a recent lawsuit, ex-members allege that the WRE case was an example of the concept of &quot;bleeding the beast.&quot; However, the group reiterated its belief that &quot;bleeding the beast&quot; was &quot;abhorent&quot; and was &quot;never a tenet&quot; of its organization.

In April 2023, Jacob, Isaiah and two other members were sentenced to federal prison with their sentences ranging between 6 and 18 years. Lev Dermen was sentenced to 40 years.

<doc id="897110" wikidata="Q381143" url="?curid=897110" title="Aeritalia G.222">
<text>The Aeritalia G.222 (formerly Fiat Aviazione, later Alenia Aeronautica) is a medium-sized STOL military transport aircraft.

It was developed to meet a NATO Basic Military Requirement 4; accordingly, it was originally designed with lift engines for a V/STOL capability, but these were never fitted to production aircraft. No wider NATO production contact were emerged, but Italy was keen to support its homegrown transport aircraft and issued an order for it in a more conventional configuration. Following its introduction to Italian Air Force service in April 1978, the type soon proved itself to be capable for conducting operations from compact and austere airstrips, particularly humanitarian missions.

Various export customers emerged for the type during the 1980s and 1990s. Libyan efforts to purchase 20 G.222s were initially vetoed by United States; Libya later procured a version of the aircraft without US-made equipment present instead. The United States purchased 10 G.222s in the 1990s, designating the type C-27A Spartan. During the 2000s, as the Italian Air Force withdrew their original G.222s due to their advancing age, these aircraft were commonly refurbished and subsequently sold onto other nations; via this approach, several G.222s were dispatched to Afghanistan during the War in Afghanistan.

A modernised variant, the Alenia C-27J Spartan, has been developed during the early 21st century. While it retains many aspects of the original aircraft, the C-27J adopts the same engines and many of the systems used on the larger Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules. Several G.222 operators, including the Italian Air Force, have opted to retire their fleets in favour of new-built C-27Js.

==Development==

===Origins===
In 1962, NATO issued a specification for a V/STOL transport aircraft (NATO Basic Military Requirement 4), capable of supporting dispersed V/STOL fighters. Fiat&#x27;s design team, led by Giuseppe Gabrielli, produced a design to meet this requirement, designated &quot;G.222&quot;; it was to be powered by two Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines and with six to eight Rolls-Royce RB162 lift engines to give VTOL capability. According to Aeritalia, the G.222 designation is derived from the first letter of the aircraft&#x27;s chief designer; the first &#x27;2&#x27; referring to the twin-engine arrangement, and the final &#x27;22&#x27; referring to the revised NATO Basic Military Requirement 22 to which it had been submitted.

None of the submissions resulted in a production contract; however the Italian Air Force (AMI), who was at the time seeking a replacement for the Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar, felt that the Fiat Aviazione proposal had merit, and placed an order for two prototypes and a ground-test airframe in 1968. The G.222 was substantially redeveloped from the NATO submission, the V/STOL lift engines having been omitted completely and the conventional Dart engines replaced by a pair of General Electric T64s; the twin-boom tail featured on the V/STOL concept was also eliminated and replaced by a more conventional single tail configuration; subsequently the new aircraft had no V/STOL capability but retained considerable short take-off/landing (STOL) performance.
On 18 July 1970, the first prototype performed the aircraft&#x27;s maiden flight with test pilot Vittorio Sanseverino at the controls. By late April 1971, the prototype had reportedly conducted a total of 22 flights and accumulated 50 hours of flight time, during which its performance was claimed to have been highly close to predictions. In December 1971, the Italian Air Force, who had placed a provisional order for the developing type, formally began evaluating the G.222 and the performance of the two prototypes then in service. Following a successful testing period, the AMI contract for 44 aircraft was issued to Aeritalia (of which Fiat Aviazione had since become a part). In December 1975, the first production aircraft conducted its first flight. In April 1978, this same aircraft formally entered service with the AMI. Following on from its introduction by the AMI, the G.222 was procured as a tactical transport aircraft by various international customers, including Argentina, Nigeria, Somalia, Venezuela and Thailand.

In December 1978, Aeritalia elected to transfer final assembly of the G.222 from Turin to Naples, at which point a total of 44 firm orders had been obtained for the type and one aircraft per month was being manufactured. Manufacturing of the G.222 was broken down into various companies; construction of the fuselage was performed at Naples, the center-section of the wing was produced by Piaggio, the wing panels were made by Macchi, the tail surfaces were built by SIAI-Marchetti, the engine nacelles by IAM, and the T64 engines were license-manufactured by Alfa Romeo and Fiat.

===Further development===
In 1977, Libya sought the purchase of 20 G.222s; this was vetoed by the U.S. Government, who had imposed an embargo on military arms and equipment to Libya, which included the G.222&#x27;s T64 engines. To get around this restriction, Aeritalia developed a version of the G.222 powered by the Rolls-Royce Tyne engine and other US supplied equipment was replaced by European equivalents; the more powerful Tyne engine also reportedly gave this variant superior &quot;hot and high&quot; performance. The provision of alternative powerplants was viewed by Aeritalia as a measure to widen the overall appeal of the G.222; the Tyne engine also reportedly possessed greater growth potential than the T64 engine. In May 1980, the first G.222 equipped with the Tyne engine performed its maiden flight. Libya placed an order for 20 Tyne-powered aircraft instead, with deliveries commencing from 1980.

In order to extend the effective operational lifespan of the type, some operators have carried out extensive upgrade programs of the G.222. In the aftermath of Italian humanitarian missions in Bosnia and Somalia, in 1996 the AMI began undertaking a major update program on their G.222 fleet; modifications include cockpit lighting changes for compatibility with Night Vision Goggles to enable night operations, increasing the aircraft&#x27;s self-defense capabilities, new communications and navigation systems, and the removal of obsolete equipment. In July 2005, the Nigerian Air Force signed a $74.5 million contract with Alenia Aeronautica for the refurbishment of a total of five G.222s, as well as the purchase of a retired AMI G.222.

In 1990, the United States Air Force selected the G.222 as the basis of a &quot;Rapid-Response Intra-Theater Airlifter&quot; (RRITA). Operated under the designation &quot;C-27A Spartan&quot;, ten G.222s were purchased and underwent avionics upgrades by Chrysler Aerospace. These aircraft were stationed at Howard AFB, Panama. The USAF would later dispose of their C-27A fleet, partly due to shifting priorities between the Army and the Air Force and partly because of the impending introduction of a newer variant, the Alenia C-27J Spartan.
==Design==
The G.222 is a twin turboprop-engine tactical military transport aircraft, and is designed to be capable of transporting equipment or troops in combat zones and operating with minimal ground support. Early production aircraft were exclusively fitted with the General Electric T64-GE-P4D turboprop engine, the licence-built Rolls-Royce Tyne was made available as an alternative powerplant for the type from 1980 onwards, while the Allison T56 was another proposed powerplant for the type. Due to features such as double-slotted flaps, stacked brakes, and reversible propellers, the G.222 has excellent short landing capabilities and is able to land in as little as 1,800 feet. It was designed to be integrated with the larger, commonplace Lockheed C-130 Hercules.

The G.222&#x27;s cargo deck can carry up to 9,000 kg (19,840 lb) of cargo, or alternatively up to 53 troops, or 32 paratroopers, or a maximum of 36 stretchers with six attending medics in a medevac capacity. The cargo deck has a large rear ramp, allowing the loading of palletised goods and vehicles, as well as sliding doors on either side of the fuselage, which are capable of being used to deploy paratroopers. Various pallet-based special mission equipment could be readily installed to enhance the aircraft&#x27;s capabilities for diverse roles such as VIP transport, maritime patrol, aerial firefighting, and calibration functions; this equipment could also be removed quickly in order for aircraft to be returned to conventional transport missions. To easily facilitate the loading of a wide range of cargos, the height of the landing gear can be manually controlled.

In part due to the austere maintenance requirements of the G.222 and its capability of operating from short unprepared airstrips in remote regions, it has seen heavy use for performing various humanitarian missions across Africa, East Asia, Europe and Central America.

The cockpit provides excellent external visibility for pilots, most of the key controls are centrally placed between the two pilots, enabling the aircraft to be flown by a single pilot under certain circumstances. The standard G.222 is equipped with various avionics, such as a nose-mounted Doppler radar, navigational computers, radio systems, and a Rockwell Collins-built autopilot. Electronic receiver equipment and up to ten control consoles were installed upon a number of G.222s for performing electronic reconnaissance missions. Some aircraft were fitted with aerial refuelling probes and associated equipment. Some Italian G.222s have been equipped with a self-protection suite, which uses multiple forms of sensors to warn against identified threats, this suite also includes several countermeasures such as chaff and flare dispensers.

==Operational history==
In 1978, the 98th Group of the 46th Transport Air Wing became the first squadron of the Italian Air Force to receive the G.222. The type was promptly placed into a support capacity, not only to the Italian Air force but also for humanitarian and civil protection.

The G.222 has seen considerable service in air relief and military supply operations. From 1979 onwards, Italy, along with other Western nations, provided considerable military aid to Somalia, part of the Italian contribution was four G.222s. In 1982, three Ejército Argentino G.222s were operational during the Falklands War, and may have participated in a logistical capacity. In 1983, a single Italian Air Force G.222 was outfitted for fire suppression duties, alongside an existing C-130 in the same role.

On 3 September 1992, an Italian Air Force (&quot;Aeronautica Militare Italiana&quot;) G.222 was shot down when approaching Sarajevo airfield while conducting a United Nations relief mission. It crashed from the airfield; a NATO rescue mission was aborted when 2 USMC CH-53 helicopters came under small arms fire. The cause of the crash was determined to be a surface-to-air missile, but it was not clear who shot it. Everyone on board – four Italian crew members and four French passengers – died in the crash.
In November 1999, the Italian Air Force placed an initial order for twelve new-build aircraft of an upgraded G.222 derivative, designated as the C-27J, as a replacement for their existing G.222s. In December 2002, Alenia Aermacchi agreed to purchase a total of 39 G.222s that had been previously operated by the Italian Air Forces under a trade-in arrangement as part of the agreed C-27J purchase. In 2005, the Italian Air Force started the phased retirement of their G.222 fleet. Several of the former Italian Air Force G.222s have been refurbished to operational conditions and resold by Alenia Aermacchi, the Nigerian Air Force became the first customer for these refurbished aircraft.

In September 2008, Alenia North America was awarded a USAF contract to upgrade and refurbish 18 G.222s, to be transferred to and used by the Afghan Air Force. Ballistic protection, adaptations for serving in the conditions of Afghanistan, and many new avionics systems, including a digital auto-pilot, were installed; two aircraft were also configured for VIP transport duties. On 28 April 2010, the first two of the Afghan Air Force&#x27;s recently delivered G.222s made their first public display during the Mujahideen Victory Day. In January 2013, the USAF decided not to renew the support contract for the Afghan fleet due to claimed serviceability issues and operational difficulties; Alenia responded, stating that the fleet was exceeding the requirements laid out by the USAF, with 10–12 aircraft available for operations against the requirement for six.

The 16 G.222s delivered to Afghanistan were scrapped in the summer of 2014 by the Defense Logistics Agency. After the U.S. spent $486 million to buy 20 C-27As, 16 were sold as scrap to an Afghan construction company for about $32,000; the planes were reportedly scrapped &quot;to minimize impact on drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.&quot; The four remaining aircraft are stored at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, with the U.S. seeking other interested buyers. From January to September 2012, the Afghan C-27A fleet flew only 234 out of 4,500 required hours. The C-17A fleet had been procured for their keep attributes to enable them to operate in Afghanistan terrain, they were former Italian G.222. However, they ended up being replaced by C-130H after maintenance difficulties.

<doc id="897118" wikidata="Q1466543" url="?curid=897118" title="Panicum virgatum">
<text>Panicum virgatum, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial warm season bunchgrass native to North America, where it occurs naturally from 55°N latitude in Canada southwards into the United States and Mexico. Switchgrass is one of the dominant species of the central North American tallgrass prairie and can be found in remnant prairies, in native grass pastures, and naturalized along roadsides. It is used primarily for soil conservation, forage production, game cover, as an ornamental grass, in phytoremediation projects, fiber, electricity, heat production, for biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and more recently as a biomass crop for the production of ethanol and butanol.

Other common names for switchgrass include tall panic grass, Wobsqua grass, blackbent, tall prairiegrass, wild redtop, thatchgrass, and Virginia switchgrass.

==Description==
Switchgrass is a hardy, deep-rooted, perennial rhizomatous grass that begins growth in late spring. It can grow up to high, but is typically shorter than big bluestem grass or indiangrass. The leaves are long, with a prominent midrib. Switchgrass uses C4 carbon fixation, giving it an advantage in conditions of drought and high temperature. Its flowers have a well-developed panicle, often up to long, and it bears a good crop of seeds. The seeds are long and up to wide, and are developed from a single-flowered spikelet. Both glumes are present and well developed. When ripe, the seeds sometimes take on a pink or dull-purple tinge, and turn golden brown with the foliage of the plant in the fall. Switchgrass is both a perennial and self-seeding crop, which means farmers do not have to plant and reseed after annual harvesting. Once established, a switchgrass stand can survive for ten years or longer. Unlike corn, switchgrass can grow on marginal lands and requires relatively modest levels of chemical fertilizers. Overall, it is considered a resource-efficient, low-input crop for producing bioenergy from farmland.
==Habitat==
Much of North America, especially the prairies of the Midwestern United States, was once prime habitat to vast swaths of native grasses, including switchgrass, indiangrass (&quot;Sorghastrum nutans&quot;), eastern gamagrass (&quot;Tripsacum dactyloides&quot;), big bluestem (&quot;Andropogon gerardi&quot;), little bluestem (&quot;Schizachyrium scoparium&quot;) and others. As European settlers began spreading west across the continent, the native grasses were plowed under and the land converted to crops such as corn, wheat, and oats. Introduced grasses such as fescue, bluegrass, and orchardgrass also replaced the native grasses for use as hay and pasture for cattle.

== Distribution ==

Switchgrass is a versatile and adaptable plant. It can grow and even thrive in many weather conditions, lengths of growing seasons, soil types, and land conditions. Its distribution spans south of latitude 55°N from Saskatchewan to Nova Scotia, south over most of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, and further south into Mexico. As a warm-season perennial grass, most of its growth occurs from late spring through early fall; it becomes dormant and unproductive during colder months. Thus, the productive season in its northern habitat can be as short as three months, but in the southern reaches of its habitat the growing season may be as long as eight months, around the Gulf Coast area.

Switchgrass is a diverse species, with striking differences between plants. This diversity, which presumably reflects evolution and adaptation to new environments as the species spread across the continent, provides a range of valuable traits for breeding programs. Switchgrass has two distinct forms, or &quot;cytotypes&quot;: the lowland cultivars, which tend to produce more biomass, and the upland cultivars, which are generally of more northern origin, more cold-tolerant, and therefore usually preferred in northern areas. Upland switchgrass types are generally shorter, at ≤ tall, and less coarse than lowland types. Lowland cultivars may grow to ≥ in favorable environments. Both upland and lowland cultivars are deeply rooted, &gt; in favorable soils, and have short rhizomes. The upland types tend to have more vigorous rhizomes, so the lowland cultivars may appear to have a bunchgrass habit, while the upland types tend to be more sod-forming. Lowland cultivars appear more plastic in their morphology, produce larger plants if stands become thin or when planted in wide rows, and they seem to be more sensitive to moisture stress than upland cultivars.

In native prairies, switchgrass is historically found in association with several other important native tallgrass prairie plants, such as big bluestem, indiangrass, little bluestem, sideoats grama, eastern gamagrass, and various forbs (sunflowers, gayfeather, prairie clover, and prairie coneflower). These widely adapted tallgrass species once occupied millions of hectares.

Switchgrass’ suitability for cultivation in the Gran Chaco is being studied by Argentina&#x27;s Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria (INTA).

==Establishment and management==
Switchgrass can be grown on land considered unsuitable for row crop production, including land that is too erodible for corn production, as well as sandy and gravelly soils in humid regions that typically produce low yields of other farm crops. No single method of establishing switchgrass can be suggested for all situations. The crop can be established both by no-till and conventional tillage. When seeded as part of a diverse mixture, planting guidelines for warm-season grass mixtures for conservation plantings should be followed. Regional guidelines for growing and managing switchgrass for bioenergy or conservation plantings are available. Several key factors can increase the likelihood of success for establishing switchgrass. These include:
* Planting switchgrass after the soil is well warmed during the spring.
* Using seeds that are highly germinable and planting 0.6 - 1.2 cm deep, or up to 2 cm deep in sandy soils.
* Packing or firming the soil both before and after seeding.
* Providing no fertilization at planting to minimize competition.
* Controlling weeds with chemical and/or cultural control methods.
Mowing and properly labeled herbicides are recommended for weed control. Chemical weed control can be used in the fall prior to establishment, or before or after planting. Weeds should be mowed just above the height of the growing switchgrass. Hormone herbicides, such as 2,4-D, should be avoided as they are known to reduce development of switchgrass when applied early in the establishing year. Plantings that appear to have failed due to weed infestations are often wrongly assessed, as the failure is often more apparent than real. Switchgrass stands that are initially weedy commonly become well established with appropriate management in subsequent years.
Once established, switchgrass can take up to three years to reach its full production potential. Depending on the region, it can typically produce 1/4 to 1/3 of its yield potential in its first year and 2/3 of its potential in the year after seeding.

After establishment, switchgrass management will depend on the goal of the seeding. Historically, most switchgrass seedings have been managed for the Conservation Reserve Program in the US. Disturbance such as periodic mowing, burning, or disking is required to optimize the stand&#x27;s utility for encouraging biodiversity. Increased attention is being placed on switchgrass management as an energy crop. Generally, the crop requires modest application of nitrogen fertilizer, as it is not a heavy feeder. Typical nitrogen (N) content of senescent material in the fall is 0.5% N. Fertilizer nitrogen applications of about 5 kg N/hectare (ha) applied for each tonne of biomass removed is a general guideline. More specific recommendations for fertilization are available regionally in North America. Herbicides are not often used on switchgrass after the seeding year, as the crop is generally quite competitive with weeds. Most bioenergy conversion processes for switchgrass, including those for cellulosic ethanol and pellet fuel production, can generally accept some alternative species in the harvested biomass. Stands of switchgrass should be harvested no more than twice per year, and one cutting often provides as much biomass as two. Switchgrass can be harvested with the same field equipment used for hay production, and it is well-suited to baling or bulk field harvesting. If its biology is properly taken into consideration, switchgrass can offer great potential as an energy crop.

== Uses ==
Switchgrass can be used as a feedstock for biomass energy production, as ground cover for soil conservation, and to control erosion, for forages and grazing, as game cover, and as feedstock for biodegradable plastics. It can be used by cattle farmers for hay and pasture and as a substitute for wheat straw in many applications, including livestock bedding, straw bale housing, and as a substrate for growing mushrooms. Additionally, switchgrass is grown as a drought-resistant ornamental grass in average to wet soils and in full sun to part shade.

===Moth host plant===
It is the preferred larval host plant of &quot;Dargida rubripennis&quot;. It is also a larval host for the Delaware skipper and the Hobomok skipper.

===Bioenergy===
Switchgrass has been researched as a renewable bioenergy crop since the mid-1980s, because it is a native perennial warm season grass with the ability to produce moderate to high yields on marginal farmlands. It is now being considered for use in several bioenergy conversion processes, including cellulosic ethanol production, biogas, and direct combustion for thermal energy applications. The main agronomic advantages of switchgrass as a bioenergy crop are its stand longevity, drought and flooding tolerance, relatively low herbicide and fertilizer input requirements, ease of management, hardiness in poor soil and climate conditions, and widespread adaptability in temperate climates. In some warm humid southern zones, such as Alabama, it has the ability to produce up to 25 oven-dry tonnes per hectare (ODT/ha). A summary of switchgrass yields across 13 research trial sites in the United States found the top two cultivars in each trial to yield 9.4 to 22.9 t/ha, with an average yield of 14.6 ODT/ha. However, these yields were recorded on small plot trials, and commercial field sites could be expected to be at least 20% lower than these results. In the United States, switchgrass yields appear to be highest in warm humid regions with long growing seasons such as the US Southeast and lowest in the dry short season areas of the Northern Great Plains. The energy inputs required to grow switchgrass are favorable when compared with annual seed bearing crops such as corn, soybean, or canola, which can require relatively high energy inputs for field operations, crop drying, and fertilization. Whole plant herbaceous perennial C4 grass feedstocks are desirable biomass energy feedstocks, as they require fewer fossil energy inputs to grow and effectively capture solar energy because of their C4 photosynthetic system and perennial nature. One study cites it takes from 0.97 to 1.34 GJ to produce 1 tonne of switchgrass, compared with 1.99 to 2.66 GJ to produce 1 tonne of corn. Another study found that switchgrass uses 0.8 GJ/ODT of fossil energy compared to grain corn&#x27;s 2.9 GJ/ODT. Given that switchgrass contains approximately 18.8 GJ/ODT of biomass, the energy output-to-input ratio for the crop can be up to 20:1. This highly favorable ratio is attributable to its relatively high energy output per hectare and low energy inputs for production.

Considerable effort is being expended in developing switchgrass as a cellulosic ethanol crop in the USA. In George W. Bush&#x27;s 2006 State of the Union Address, he proposed using switchgrass for ethanol; since then, over US$100 million has been invested into researching switchgrass as a potential biofuel source. Switchgrass has the potential to produce up to 380 liters of ethanol per tonne harvested. However, current technology for herbaceous biomass conversion to ethanol is about 340 liters per tonne. In contrast, corn ethanol yields about 400 liters per tonne.

The main advantage of using switchgrass over corn as an ethanol feedstock is its cost of production is generally about 1/2 that of grain corn, and more biomass energy per hectare can be captured in the field. Thus, switchgrass cellulosic ethanol should give a higher yield of ethanol per hectare at lower cost. However, this will depend on whether the cost of constructing and operating cellulosic ethanol plants can be reduced considerably. The switchgrass ethanol industry energy balance is also considered to be substantially better than that of corn ethanol. During the bioconversion process, the lignin fraction of switchgrass can be burned to provide sufficient steam and electricity to operate the biorefinery. Studies have found that for every unit of energy input needed to create a biofuel from switchgrass, four units of energy are yielded. In contrast, corn ethanol yields about 1.28 units of energy per unit of energy input. A 2008 study from the Great Plains indicated that for ethanol production from switchgrass, this figure is 6.4, or alternatively, that 540% more energy was contained in the ethanol produced than was used in growing the switchgrass and converting it to liquid fuel. However, there remain commercialization barriers to the development of cellulosic ethanol technology. Projections in the early 1990s for commercialization of cellulosic ethanol by the year 2000 have not been met. The commercialization of cellulosic ethanol is thus proving to be a significant challenge, despite noteworthy research efforts.

Thermal energy applications for switchgrass appear to be closer to near-term scale-up than cellulosic ethanol for industrial or small-scale applications. For example, switchgrass can be pressed into fuel pellets that are subsequently burned in pellet stoves used to heat homes (which typically burn corn or wood pellets). Switchgrass has been widely tested as a substitute for coal in power generation. The most widely studied project to date has been the Chariton Valley Project in Iowa. The Show-Me-Energy Cooperative (SMEC) in Missouri is using switchgrass and other warm-season grasses, along with wood residues, as feedstocks for pellets used for the firing of a coal-fired power plant. In Eastern Canada, switchgrass is being used on a pilot scale as a feedstock for commercial heating applications. Combustion studies have been undertaken and it appears to be well-suited as a commercial boiler fuel. Research is also being undertaken to develop switchgrass as a pellet fuel because of lack of surplus wood residues in eastern Canada, as a slowdown in the forest products industry in 2009 is now resulting in wood pellet shortages throughout Eastern North America. Generally speaking, the direct firing of switchgrass for thermal applications can provide the highest net energy gain and energy output-to-input ratio of all switchgrass bioconversion processes. Research has found switchgrass, when pelletized and used as a solid biofuel, is a good candidate for displacing fossil fuels. Switchgrass pellets were identified to have a 14.6:1 energy output-to-input ratio, which is substantially better than that for liquid biofuel options from farmland. As a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy, switchgrass pellets were found to be an effective means to use farmland to mitigate greenhouse gases on the order of 7.6–13 tonnes of CO2 per hectare. In contrast, switchgrass cellulosic ethanol and corn ethanol were found to mitigate 5.2 and 1.5 tonnes of CO2 per hectare, respectively.

Historically, the major constraint to the development of grasses for thermal energy applications has been the difficulty associated with burning grasses in conventional boilers, as biomass quality problems can be of particular concern in combustion applications. These technical problems now appear to have been largely resolved through crop management practices such as fall mowing and spring harvesting that allow for leaching to occur, which leads to fewer aerosol-forming compounds (such as K and Cl) and N in the grass. This reduces clinker formation and corrosion, and enables switchgrass to be a clean combustion fuel source for use in smaller combustion appliances. Fall harvested grasses likely have more application for larger commercial and industrial boilers. Switchgrass is also being used to heat small industrial and farm buildings in Germany and China through a process used to make a low quality natural gas substitute.

Bai et al. (2010) conducted a study to analyze the environmental sustainability of using switchgrass plant material as a feedstock for ethanol production. Life cycle analysis was used to make this assessment. They compared efficiency of E10, E85, and ethanol with gasoline. They took into account air and water emissions associated with growing, managing, processing and storing the switchgrass crop. They also factored in the transportation of the stored switchgrass to the ethanol plant where they assumed the distance was 20 km. The reductions in global warming potential by using E10 and E85 were 5 and 65%, respectively. Their models also suggested that the “human toxicity potential” and “eco-toxicity potential” were substantially greater for the high ethanol fuels (i.e., E85 and ethanol) than for gasoline and E10.

In 2014, a genetically altered form of the bacterium &quot;Caldicellulosiruptor bescii&quot; was created which can cheaply and efficiently turn switchgrass into ethanol.

=== Biodegradable plastics production ===
In a novel application, US scientists have genetically modified switchgrass to enable it to produce polyhydroxybutyrate, which accumulates in beadlike granules within the plant&#x27;s cells. In preliminary tests, the dry weight of a plants leaves were shown to comprise up to 3.7% of the polymer. Such low accumulation rates do not, as of 2009, allow for commercial use of switchgrass as a biosource.

=== Soil conservation ===

Switchgrass is useful for soil conservation and amendment, particularly in the United States and Canada, where switchgrass is endemic. Switchgrass has a deep fibrous root system – nearly as deep as the plant is tall. Since it, along with other native grasses and forbs, once covered the plains of the United States that are now the Corn Belt, the effects of the past switchgrass habitat have been beneficial, lending to the fertile farmland that exists today. The deep fibrous root systems of switchgrass left a deep rich layer of organic matter in the soils of the Midwest, making those mollisol soils some of the most productive in the world. By returning switchgrass and other perennial prairie grasses as an agricultural crop, many marginal soils may benefit from increased levels of organic material, permeability, and fertility, due to the grass&#x27;s deep root system.

Soil erosion, both from wind and water, is of great concern in regions where switchgrass grows. Due to its height, switchgrass can form an effective wind erosion barrier. Its root system, also, is excellent for holding soil in place, which helps prevent erosion from flooding and runoff.
Some highway departments (for example, KDOT) have used switchgrass in their seed mixes when re-establishing growth along roadways. It can also be used on strip mine sites, dikes, and pond dams. Conservation districts in many parts of the United States use it to control erosion in grass waterways because of its ability to anchor soils while providing habitat for wildlife.

===Forages and grazing===
Switchgrass is an excellent forage for cattle; however, it has shown toxicity in horses, sheep, and goats through chemical compounds known as saponins, which cause photosensitivity and liver damage in these animals. Researchers are continuing to learn more about the specific conditions under which switchgrass causes harm to these species, but until more is discovered, it is recommended switchgrass not be fed to them. For cattle, however, it can be fed as hay, or grazed.

Grazing switchgrass calls for watchful management practices to ensure survival of the stand. It is recommended that grazing begin when the plants are about 50 cm tall, and that grazing be discontinued when the plants have been eaten down to about 25 cm, and to rest the pasture 30–45 days between grazing periods. Switchgrass becomes stemmy and unpalatable as it matures, but during the target grazing period, it is a favorable forage with a relative feed value (RFV) of 90–104. The grass&#x27;s upright growth pattern places its growing point off the soil surface onto its stem, so leaving 25 cm of stubble is important for regrowth. When harvesting switchgrass for hay, the first cutting occurs at the late boot stage – around mid-June. This should allow for a second cutting in mid-August, leaving enough regrowth to survive the winter.

=== Game cover ===
Switchgrass is well known among wildlife conservationists as good forage and habitat for upland game bird species, such as pheasant, quail, grouse, and wild turkey, and song birds, with its plentiful small seeds and tall cover. A study published in 2015 has shown that switchgrass, when grown in a traditional monoculture, has an adverse impact on some wildlife. Depending on how thickly switchgrass is planted, and what it is partnered with, it also offers excellent forage and cover for other wildlife across the country. For those producers who have switchgrass stands on their farm, it is considered an environmental and aesthetic benefit due to the abundance of wildlife attracted by the switchgrass stands. Some members of Prairie Lands Bio-Products, Inc. in Iowa have even turned this benefit into a profitable business by leasing their switchgrass land for hunting during the proper seasons. The benefits to wildlife can be extended even in large-scale agriculture through the process of strip harvesting, as recommended by The Wildlife Society, which suggests that rather than harvesting an entire field at once, strip harvesting could be practiced so that the entire habitat is not removed, thereby protecting the wildlife inhabiting the switchgrass.
